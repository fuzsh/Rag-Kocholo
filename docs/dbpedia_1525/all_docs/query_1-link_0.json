For her portrayal of Aria Montgomery, Hale won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Actress in 2014; she was nominated for the same award the following three years. She has also won seven Teen Choice Awards for Choice TV Actress/Star, and she was presented with the 2013 Gracie Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Rising Star. The seventh and final season of the show aired on June 27, 2017.\n\nLauren Keyana \"Keke\" Palmer was born on August 26, 1993, in Harvey, Illinois, and raised in Robbins, Illinois, to Sharon and Larry Palmer, both former actors. Palmer showed vocal promise as a five-year-old when she belted out \"Jesus Loves Me\" in her church choir. A year later, the singer-actress had a solo in her kindergarten play but, to her mom's dismay, the mic had not been adjusted to suit her daughter's height.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Palmer lowered the mic and moved the crowd with her heavenly voice. At that very moment, her family knew there was something special about Keke (a nickname given to her by her sister).\n\nAlthough music was still her passion, Palmer's first big break came via her acting skills, making her big-screen debut in Barbershop 2 - Krass frisiert! (2004) as Queen Latifah's niece. Immediately recognizing her star potential, the film's producers encouraged her parents to take their daughter to California to explore other acting opportunities. Relocating required that Palmer's parents leave behind the security of their jobs, a newly purchased home, and uproot their other three children. However, it didn't diminish the family's support of Palmer's aspirations.\n\nOnce settled on the West Coast, Palmer did not waste any time. Within six weeks she had booked an episode of the critically acclaimed CBS series Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003), a national K-Mart commercial, and was chosen from a nationwide search to play opposite William H. Macy in a TNT movie, Der Schutzengel (2004). Her performance was so amazing that it earned her a Screen Actors Guild nomination - to date, she is the youngest actress (then at age 10) ever to receive a nomination in a Lead Actress Category.\n\nIn 2006, Palmer appeared as the lead character \"Akeelah Anderson\" in the critically acclaimed, award-winning film Akeelah ist die Größte (2006). The film, about a young South Los Angeles girl who attempts to win a national spelling bee, won the hearts of audiences everywhere. Her breakthrough performance has received praise from many film critics and organizations. Among the list of nominations received, \"Akeelah and the Bee\" was listed as one of NBR's 2006 Top Independent Films of the Year, as well as four nominations from the NAACP Image Awards. Palmer, alone, won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture, as well as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture by the Black Movie Awards. She has also received nominations for Most Promising Newcomer by the Chicago Film Critics, Best Actress by the Black Reel Awards, and Best Young Actress by the Broadcast Film Critics Association. Keke held her own in scenes with veteran co-stars Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nThat very same year, Palmer appeared in Tyler Perry's Das verrückte Familienfest (2006), which was #1 at the box office for two consecutive weeks. Palmer went on to win a 2007 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her breakout role in \"Akeelah and the Bee\". She also received a ShoWest Award for Rising Star of the Year. Shortly after, Palmer lit up the small screen starring in the Disney Channel's hit movie, Jump In! (2007). This one-two punch of big-screen success coupled with small screen ratings power made Keke Palmer a household name in Hollywood.\n\nPalmer contributed her first recording, which was featured on the \"Akeelah and the Bee\" soundtrack, titled \"All My Girlz\", and followed it up with the ever popular \"My Turn Now\" on the \"Jump In!\" soundtrack.\n\nAs if two soundtracks were not enough, she was also asked to sing \"Tonight\", an end-title song from the smash-hit Ben Stiller movie Nachts im Museum (2006). Her Atlantic Records debut album, \"So Uncool\", is jammed with up-tempo R&B tracks, inspirational moments, and love songs. In 2008, Palmer starred in the Weinstein Co. feature, The Longshots (2008). The film was based on the true story of a young female quarterback, played by Palmer, that makes Pop Warner history; she starred opposite Ice Cube, for first-time director and Limp Bizkit front man, Fred Durst.\n\nPalmer also starred as the title character in the hit Nickelodeon series, True Jackson, VP (2008), for 68 episodes. She played a high-school student who becomes the head of a major fashion label. In the fall of 2008, True Jackson bowed with over 4.8 million viewers, setting a record for Nickelodeon's largest audience for a live-action premiere. She has received four NAACP Awards for Best Actress in Children's Television for her role as True Jackson. In 2011, Keke joined the voice cast of Nickelodeon's The Winx Club - The Winx Club (2004). She played Aisha, the Fairy of Waves. For her voice work on Winx Club, she received another NAACP Award nomination, this time for Outstanding Performance in a Youth/Children's Series or Special.\n\nKeke starred in the movie, Abducted: The Carlina White Story (2012), for the Lifetime Network. She had a voice role in the 20th Century Fox animated film, Ice Age 4 - Voll verschoben (2012), as the character Peaches. Her co-stars include Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Jennifer Lopez, and Queen Latifah.\n\nPalmer was seen on the big screen in the Alcon/Warner Bros movie, Joyful Noise (2012), singing alongside legendary Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton; however, it was Palmer who the critics singled out for her \"young and inspiring\" rendition of the Michael Jackson song, \"Man in the Mirror\".\n\nPalmer resides in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nMadison Pettis got her big break at 8 years old with her very first film, playing the daughter of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in Disney's hit family comedy, \"The Game Plan.\" Now all grown up, Madison has an extensive list of acting credits and over 20 million followers on social media.

Her father was Dominican and her mother is Puerto Rican. She was raised in Queens, New York. When she was 10 years old, she and her family moved to the Dominican Republic, where they would live for the next seven years. While living there, Zoe discovered a keen interest in performance dance and began her training at the prestigious ECOS Espacio de Danza Dance Academy where she learned ballet as well as other dance forms. Not only did her training provide an excellent outlet for the enthusiastic and energetic youngster, it would also prove to be a fortunate precursor for the start of her professional acting career. At age 17, Zoe and her family moved back to the United States where her love for dance followed and an interest in theater performance became stronger.\n\nShe began performing with the Faces theater troupe which put on plays geared to provide positive messages for teens with themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and sex. These performances not only gave her valuable experience but also a source of great pride knowing that she was making a difference in the lives of young people like herself. While performing with the Faces troupe and also the New York Youth Theater, Zoe was recruited for a talent agency and her dance training years before coupled with her acting experience greatly helped her land her first big screen role as Eva Rodriguez, the talented and headstrong ballet dancer in the film Center Stage (2000). Since her professional career began several years ago, Zoe's talent and determination have allowed her to be involved in blockbuster films and act with major actors, actresses and industry insiders at a pace that very few young professionals have experienced.\n\nZoe has not only held her own in major motion picture productions but gained the respect and praise from industry insiders such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg and actors/actresses such as Tom Hanks, Bernie Mac, Keira Knightley, Ashton Kutcher, Kirsten Dunst and Orlando Bloom. According to many of her co-stars, producers and directors, the sky is no limit for this young star who has incredible range, intense concentration, and a steely determination to be involved with projects that challenge her professionally with wide-ranging subject matters and characters. Just to ask practically anyone who she has worked for or with about her, glowing comments abound and earned friendships and respect are readily revealed. A star has been born, and growing every day."
