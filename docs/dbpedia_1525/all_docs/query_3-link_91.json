        "text": "Johnny Brown, who is remembered for his two-season stint on variety hour Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In and as building superintendent Nathan Bookman on 1970s sitcom Good Times, passed away on Wednesday, March 2. He was 84.\n\n\"Our family is devastated,\" wrote his daughter Sharon Catherine Brown on Instagram. \"We respectfully ask for privacy at this time because we need a minute to process the unthinkable.\"\n\n\"He was literally snatched out of our lives. It’s not real for us yet. So there will be more to say but not now,\" his daughter said. \"Dad was the absolute best. We love him so very much.\"\n\nBorn June 11, 1937 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and raised in Harlem, Johnny Brown began his career as a singer, touring with Sam “The Man” Taylor beginning in 1958. His first release was \"Walkin', Talkin', Kissin' Doll\" from Columbia Records in 1961. And he made early TV show guest appearances on The Leslie Uggams Show, Julia and Love, American Style and had a cameo role in theatrical comedy The Out of Towners in 1970 before joining the ensemble cast of Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In in 1972.\n\nPrior to joining the cast of Good Times in 1975, Brown guest-starred in series like Night Gallery, Maude, The Rookies, Lotsa Luck, Get Christie Love!, and Chico and the Man, among others.\n\nAfter Good Times, Brown peppered his resume with more guest appearances on TV series like Gimme A Break!, Archie Bunker’s Place, The Jeffersons, Fantasy Island, Moonlighting, 227, Family Matters and Touched By an Angel. And he was a voice actor in numerous animated series including Plastic Man and Alvin & the Chipmunks.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Sharon, Brown is survived by June, his wife of 61 years, and his son, John Jr."
