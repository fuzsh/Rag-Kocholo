Her mother, Patricia Ramsey, noticed that JonBenét was missing and later found a ransom note demanding that a large sum of money be delivered in return for her daughter. After a extensive search, the Boulder, Colorado Police Department suggested that JonBenét 's father and family friends return to the house to look for anything unusual that may lead to his daughter's whereabouts. JonBenét's body was discovered covered in a blanket in the family's home. According to the autopsy, JonBenét was strangulated and suffered severe cranial trauma.
