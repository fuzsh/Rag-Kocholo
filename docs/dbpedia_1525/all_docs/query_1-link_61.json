Other stars, like \"Game of Thrones\" alum Sophie Turner and \"Riverdale's\" KJ Apa, have altered their hair hues specifically for roles.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nHere are 32 celebrities and their natural hair color.\n\nAnjelica Oswald contributed to a previous version of this article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Stone is known for her red hair, but the actress sometimes goes back to her natural blonde.\n\nShe's known for transforming her hair often, but the actress told Refinery29 that red is her favorite.\n\n\"My hair grows out blonde, but my coloring is similar to that of a redhead,\" she said. \"So... I really like having red hair. I'm a natural blonde, but I really like the red.\"\n\nKristen Stewart often rocks brown locks, she's a natural dirty blonde.\n\nStewart is no stranger to changing her hair, from shaving it off to dyeing it different colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlett Johansson is known for her blonde hair, but she's naturally a bit darker brown.\n\nJohansson has shown off a number of looks over the years, but has most recently rocked short hair.\n\nWhen she first cut her hair short back in 2014, she told Refinery29, \"I think I just got tired of wearing a ponytail all the time. I [was] always stuffing it under a wig, so I just cut it off. Everybody kept saying, 'Don't cut your hair! You might hate it!' But, then I thought, 'Why am I letting other people tell me what to do?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarlie Kloss went blonde in 2014 and hasn't looked back to her brunette days.\n\nHer colorist explained to Allure back in 2014 that Kloss wanted a natural look.\n\n\"We talked about how she was a towhead as a child and how she didn't want traditional hair color — single process and highlights — that would force her back to the salon every four weeks for a root touch-up,\" Alexis Unno said.\n\n\"With her schedule, that's impossible,\" she continued. \"Plus, she wanted something more subtle, like the color her hair would turn after spending time at the beach. She also wanted to keep the cool-girl factor of embracing her natural hair color — it was very important to Karlie that it looked natural.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeighton Meester had to dye her blonde hair brown for \"Gossip Girl.\"\n\nJosh Schwartz, co-creator of \"Gossip Girl,\" told The Hollywood Reporter that they made her dye her hair when she auditioned.\n\n\"Leighton was a blonde when she came in to read, but Blake was the blonde, so we asked her to color her hair,\" he said. \"A risky move on her part in the middle of pilot season, but she did a sink-rinse dye job to audition as a brunette.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSophie Turner dyed her natural blonde hair a reddish shade for her role as Sansa Stark on \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nShe told Vogue that changing her hair color was initially a difficult experience.\n\n\"It was difficult, especially being in an all-girls school,\" she said. \"There seemed to be a bad connotation with red or ginger hair, so I was nervous, but it was nice to transform my look for my first role. Plus, it spurred my appreciation for how hair can change one's look and personality.\"\n\nShe added that her hair color affects how she feels and what she wears.\n\n\"I wouldn't wear bright clothes because I wanted the [red] hair to speak for itself, but now as a blonde, I wear whatever I want,\" she said. \"It affects everything from clothing to how I walk and talk and hold myself. It kind of felt like coming home, there was a comfort in it for sure.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" fans know Emilia Clarke as the platinum-haired Daenerys Targaryen, but the actress is a natural brunette, though she does sometimes add some blonde ombré and highlights to her hair.\n\nTo achieve her look on \"Game of Thrones,\" the actress wore a bald cap and a mesh cap before the wig was put on. Kevin Alexander, the man in charge of getting Clarke's hair right, told Time that there were four \"character wigs\" for Daenerys.\n\nAs Cersei on \"Game of Thrones,\" Lena Headey rocked golden locks, but she's naturally a dark brunette.\n\nBecause her hair is dark, Headey wore a bald cap under the blonde wig she wore on the show. She did actually cut her hair short, like Cersei, in real life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSofia Vergara may rock the brunette look, but she's a natural blonde.\n\nShe first went brunette to land roles.\n\n\"I'm a natural blonde, but when I started acting, I would go to auditions, and they didn't know where to put me because I was voluptuous and had the accent — but I had blonde hair,\" she told Self magazine in 2010. \"The moment I dyed my hair dark, it was, 'Oh, she's the hot Latin girl.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLady Gaga is another artist who chooses to wear her hair blonde, sometimes with wigs, instead of her natural brown.\n\nShe has rocked every sort of color out there. During a 2013 concert, BBC reported that Gaga took off her wig and said that she had used \"wigs and make-up\" to \"cover up the pain.\"\n\nShe continued: \"When I didn't feel strong enough to be me, I created someone else. And it worked.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Riverdale\" star KJ Apa dyes his dark brown hair red to play Archie Andrews.\n\nApa goes to the salon every two weeks to get his hair bleached and dyed to maintain the color while filming. They also have to dye his eyebrows to match.\n\n\"It's not my favorite thing to do, but obviously I've got to do it because the roots keep coming up and my hair grows really fast,\" he told Vulture. \"I'm sitting there for at least two-and-a-half hours, so I'm on my iPad and I read some scripts and stuff.
