        "text": "Recently, a concerning crime trend known as \"jugging\" has been making headlines. I first learned about it after an alarming number of cases were reported in Maryland in June and July. The more I learn about jugging, the more instances I find around the country. I don't know of any specific cases of jugging here in Southern Indiana, but the FBI is reminding us that it's important to be aware and vigilant, especially since trends like this can sometimes spread.\n\nFirst of All, What is Jugging?\n\nSimply put, \"jugging\" is armed robbery, but it's focused on a specific type of victim. Here's what the FBI has to say about it.\n\n“Jugging” refers to a crime in which a suspect, or group of suspects, targets customers believed to have large amounts of cash. The perpetrators either rob customers while in the parking lot of a bank, credit union, or ATM or follow them to their next location.\n\nFBI Tips for Protecting Yourself\n\nWhile there may not be any cases of \"jugging\" in Evansville, it never hurts to take a moment to remind ourselves of the best ways to stay safe, or at least greatly reduce the chance of being a victim. Here are some practical tips the FBI hopes you will keep in mind:\n\nBe Aware of Your Surroundings: When withdrawing or depositing money, always be mindful of who and what is around you. If something feels off, trust your instincts.\n\nConceal Your Cash: Don’t make it obvious that you’re carrying money. Secure it discreetly in a bag or pocket.\n\nVary Your Routine: Change up the times and locations you visit the bank. Routine makes it easier for criminals to predict your actions.\n\nDrive Straight to Your Next Destination: If you feel like you're being followed, head to a police station or a crowded area and call for help.\n\nAvoid Distractions: Stay off your phone and stay alert until you are safely inside your car or another secure location.\n\nWhat to Do If You See Something Suspicious\n\nIf you notice anything unusual or feel unsafe, report it immediately. You can contact local law enforcement or provide tips anonymously to the FBI. Remember, staying informed and cautious is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones."
