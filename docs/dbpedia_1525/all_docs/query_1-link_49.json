        "text": "Many people in Texas collect a lot of valuable items, such as antiques, while others search for those valuable antiques. That's why reality TV shows about this sort of thing are so popular. One TV show in particular, put this hobby on the map.\n\nAmerican Pickers\n\n\"American Pickers\" is a reality show on the History Channel that has been on the air for 25 seasons. The show follows Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz (who left the show in 2020) as they travel across the US, visiting homes and businesses in search of unique and rare items from the past. Essentially, they search through other people's \"junk\" to find treasures, and then negotiate with the owners to agree on a price for the items they find. While most of the items they find are valuable, they occasionally come across individuals who have hoarded decades of items, leaving them scattered or stored away.\n\nHere's a clip of when \"American Pickers\" came to the Texas/Oklahoma border to an old service station.\n\nGuess What? \"American Pickers\" is Coming Back to Texas!\n\nIf you have ever wanted to be a part of the show here's your chance. Do you have a lot of stuff the pickers could go through? Do you have those one-of-a-kind items that will catch the eye of Mike? Here's your chance to have your items picked through.\n\nThe \"American Pickers\" plan to film episodes of the show in the area in October.\n\n\"American Pickers\" are looking for large, rare collections and things they have never seen before. If you have any of these items and can tell a story about your stuff then it's time to reach out today. If you would like to have a chance for \"American Pickers\" to come to your location you can contact them at:\n\nEmail: americanpickers@cineflix.com\n\nPhone: (646) 493-2184\n\nFacebook: @GotAPick\n\nYou will need to share the following information in your inquiry:\n\nYour Name\n\nCity, State\n\nWhere your collection is located\n\nDescription of your collection and items\n\nPlease note that the American Pickers will not pick at stores, flea markets, malls, auction businesses, museums, or anything open to the public.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Contact them today! We'd love to see \"American Pickers\" in the area."
