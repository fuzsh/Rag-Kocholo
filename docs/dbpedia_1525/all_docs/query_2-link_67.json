        "text": "After days of teasing its release on social media, actress Sharon Stone is back with Ratched, a new Netflix show airing tonight, starring Stone, alongside actress Cynthia Nixon and Sarah Paulson.\n\nWhile her onscreen character set in the 1940's is wearing a full face of make-up, take a closer look at Stone's raw and unedited Instagram page and her face seems unaffected by age, or by surgery, though there's no telling what good work she may or may not have had.\n\nThere's certainly no denying that Sharon looks darn good for her age. At 62, she has the body of a 30 year old and the skin of a woman in her 40's - if not better.\n\nApart from a few endearing crinkles around her eyes, the mousy blonde actress has barely changed since her break out role in Basic Instinct in the 1990's.\n\nWhile it's obvious from her toned limbs, evident in The Telegraph's exclusive photo shoot with the actress (above) that Stone prioritises healthy eating and exercise, there's no signs of over-inflated lips or heavy-handed fillers.\n\nOn the contrary, her youthfulness is down to the cleverest trick of all: a healthy lifestyle and signature beauty formula.\n\nThese are the five reasons why Sharon Stone looks so good at 62.\n\n1. Blonde (but not too blonde)\n\nIf you're not careful, your hair colour will gradually get lighter, brighter and less natural-looking as you age, which can have the opposite effect to the one you're chasing. Without realising it, we can over compensate for a lack of what we can't control (our age) with what we can (our hair colour).\n\nWhile there's no need to go grey these days if you don't want to, unless you've always been a trend setter, a subtle, flattering hair colour that's close to your natural shade will give you an understated edge. Stone's dark blonde base covers greys, while a few lighter pieces frame her face and lift her complexion. Genius.\n\n2. A signature haircut\n\nEstablishing a haircut early on that suits your style and facial features provides a staple shape to adapt as you age. While the actress has tweaked her haircut slightly throughout the years, she has remained faithful to a style that never dates.\n\nStone graduates from a one-length bob that frames her face and defines her jaw line to a slightly shorter style with a long, sweeping fringe that she recently had cut immediately after lockdown. This allows her to scrape it back off her face for a chic evening look or leave it relaxed and tousled for day.\n\n3. Timeless make-up\n\nOne thing you won't catch Sharon Stone doing is caking on her make-up. With the exception of a classic red lipstick, which she wears occasionally with a chic boyish trouser suit (as seen above) or black evening dress, Sharon's neutral make-up palette is a masterclass in applying 'just enough' to look polished without covering up her skin's natural luminosity.\n\nShe favours taupe and brown shades of eyeshadow to softly define and compliment her blue eyes, with a smattering of bronzer across her forehead and cheekbones to warm up her skin tone, and finishes with a wearable nude lip colour.\n\nCrucially, Sharon doesn't darken or over pencil her eyebrows, which would only drag her face down and drown her delicate features. Instead, she keeps to a natural eyebrow shape (not too thin) in a youthful mousy blonde shade.\n\n5. The never too-done hair texture\n\nIt's not uncommon for A-list actresses to lean on regular salon blow outs and hidden hair extensions to add volume, shine and thickness to lacklustre hair. Whereas, Stone's hair is as glossy and youthful looking as it was 20 years ago, never appearing overly-styled (an instant age accelerator).\n\nIn fact, as the hair shaft becomes less soft and flexible (hair naturally gets more coarse with age) the older you get, the more focus you should put on hair treatments to replenish moisture and resume as much shine and movement (swish) as possible. We suspect Sharon knows her way around a hair mask."
