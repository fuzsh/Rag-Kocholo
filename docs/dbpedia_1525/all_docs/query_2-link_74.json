        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nSharon Stone, 65, recently shared her favorite shampoo and conditioner combination.\n\nThe actress uses The Shampoo and The Conditioner from Augustinus Bader\n\n“All the hair I had lost,” she said “grew back.”\n\nSharon Stone is a force to be reckoned with. The 65-year-old actress always looks flawless—whether she’s posing topless or showing off her abs in a string bikini on Instagram. And like the style icon she is, Stone loves to let her fans in or her favorite beauty tips, tricks, and products from time to time. Recently, the actress revealed her go-to shampoo and conditioner: The Shampoo and The Conditioner from Augustinus Bader.\n\nWhile everything changed for Stone when she suffered a stroke in 2001, she continues to be open about how she overcame the challenge. In a recent interview with Byrdie, Stone discussed everything from the life-altering event to her super simple beauty and skincare routine. “I’ve always been very, very plain,” she said of her routine. “I’ve always felt that the K.I.S.S. (keep it simple, stupid) principle is basically real. I believe in that for everything.”\n\nGiven Stone’s philosophy that less is more, we know that what she does use must be worth it. Luckily, she shared her favorite shampoo and conditioner combo that she says helped with the hair loss she faced after her stroke.\n\n“I started using this Augustinus Bader shampoo and conditioner and after-shampoo leave-in conditioner….all the hair I had lost under here, on the sides from the stroke, grew back,” she said in the interview. “And I have hair!” (Note: While stroke side effects are vast, there isn’t currently evidence that suggests hair loss is one of them.)\n\nBoth The Shampoo and The Conditioner claim to reduce shedding and “support natural hair growth” while keeping hair hydrated. The brand states that both products are suitable for all hair types and textures.\n\nMore shoppers love the products, too. The Shampoo “has brought my hair back to its normal texture!” wrote one five-star reviewer on Sephora. “My hair was brittle and damaged, but now it’s healthier and thicker!” Another five-star reviewer on Sephora wrote that The Conditioner “completely stops shedding,” adding, “I have never seen such a visible difference from a conditioner before.”\n\nStone has always been open about her ideas regarding beauty. While she loves keeping things simple in her routine, she also seems to enjoy being exactly where she is now. “This idea that being youthful is the only thing that’s beautiful or attractive simply isn’t true. I don’t want to be an ‘ageless beauty,’” Stone previously said. “I want to be a woman who is the best I can be at my age.”\n\nWe can all appreciate that!
