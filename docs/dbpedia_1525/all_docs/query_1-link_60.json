Behind the scenes at a recording of their successful podcast, Titting About, itâs clear theyâre still sparking off each other to create comedy.\n\nimagineâ¦ charts their journey from the game-changing Comic Strip team, which helped launch the new Channel 4 in 1982, to their domination of BBC schedules over the decades and their recent ventures on the stage, the page and in film.\n\nDawn and Jennifer revisit the former site of the Comic Strip Club in Soho where a group of young comedians revolutionised the comedy scene. Alongside interviews with Comic Strip comedians Alexei Sayle, Adrian Edmondson and Nigel Planer, Dawn and Jennifer tell the story of being the women in a team that would change the face of television. Just five years after Dawn and Jennifer met, they would be part of The Comic Strip Presentsâ¦ Five Go Mad in Dorset, shown on the launch night of the new Channel 4.\n\nAt the start of French and Saundersâ career comedy was still firmly a male domain.

From hidden forests, and turbulent coasts, to vast unexplored deserts\n\nWe begin in the oldest desert on earth â the Namib, in SW Africa. A pair of ostriches raise their family in the searing heat to keep them safe from predators â but time is ticking as the chicks begin to hatch.\n\nAway from the tropics, in the cold waters off North America, the sun fuels forests of giant kelp. It is a dangerous place for young horn sharks â giant sea bass and large sharks patrol through the kelp, but the real danger is buried beneath. A little horn shark unwittingly stumbles into an ambush set by an angel shark. With a lightning strike, it is swallowed whole, but it is not over yet â the little horn shark has a secret weapon.\n\nFrom kelp forests to rainforests, animals must develop remarkable strategies to survive and in the Amazon jungle, alien-like treehoppers form surprising alliances to keep their young safe and fight off deadly assassin bugs. Here it pays to work together.\n\nLeopards are the most adaptable of big cats, and a handful of special individuals have learnt to hunt by hiding and leaping from treetops - some higher than the roof of a two storey house. Their lives depend on them getting this unique game of hide and seek right, and when they do, their prey doesnât see them coming.\n\nIn Botswana, nestled amongst flowering water lilies, newly hatched âlily-trotterâ chicks learn a vital lesson â how to âwalk on waterâ.\n\nSouth Africaâs Robberg Peninsula, is a treacherous place to start life. Thousands of Cape fur seals are squeezed onto a small ledge. In recent years, this coast has been home to unprecedented numbers of great white sharks and to protect themselves the seal colony so something extraordinary - band together to see off the worldâs most notorious predator.\n\nMany animals must now rise to a new challenge â¦.living alongside us. Some animals are meeting this challenge head on and thriving. In Bali, long-tailed macaques have learned to steal touristsâ most valued items, and then use them to barter with temple staff for their favourite food.\n\nA lucky few can succeed in a human world, but our impact now extends to even the most remote corners of our planet.\n\nPlanet Earth III is a BBC Studios Natural History Unit (1x60) for BBC One and BBC iPlayer co-produced by BBC America, ZDF, FTV and The Open University.

Co-writers Henry Normal and Phil Mealy, and fellow cast members Sue Johnston, Ricky Tomlinson and Ralf Little recall the remarkable writing and acting talent at the heart the series - a sitcom playing out in near-real time, devoid of studio laughter, punchlines, or anything much happening at all - but that built huge audiences and garnered multiple awards.\n\nAs her star rose, the realities of living with her own fame came to define Aherneâs life, as she became a fixture of tabloid speculation about her personal life, something she would struggle with throughout her career.\n\nTragically Caroline died of cancer in 2016. Her friends recall not just the lasting cultural and creative legacy she left behind, but of the joy she found in human life, her inimitable sense of mischief and the happiness she brought those closest to her.\n\nProduced and Directed by Claire Whalley and Hannah Lowes.\n\nCaroline Aherne - Comedy Queen is a Passion Pictures production (1 x 70) for BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.
