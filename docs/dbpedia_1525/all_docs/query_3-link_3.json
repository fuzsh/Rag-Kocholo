        "text": "One essential ingredient to any actors career is experience. It allows us to develop our craft and hone our skills over time. With each performance, we refine techniques, learn from mistakes, and develop greater emotional and psychological depth in our performances. But this growth in credibility and authenticity in acting comes as much from our offstage lives as it does from our onstage experiences. And todayâs guest shares both personal and professional challenges that have shaped her not only into a great actress, but an amazing person as well.\n\nSharon Catherine Brown has appeared in films like A Chorus Line and Sister Act 2, in soap operas like Generations, and sitcoms like The Jeffersons, Good Times, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But theater is where she got her start and remains her first love. From Broadway productions of Dreamgirls and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat to the national tours of The Wiz, Rent, and Jekyll & Hyde, ShayCat (as sheâs known to friends) has the kind of experiences and resume that any actor would love to have. She and I met this past year doing a new musical version of the classic novel, Anne of Green Gables. And in part one of our conversation, she shares with us the long line of performers in her family (namely Johnny Brown, her father), a harrowing experience in her first Broadway show (Maggie Flynn), and the moment she knew she was born to be a drama queen.\n\nSTORY #1 - Coming from a long line of Broadway performers\n\nSTORY #2 - The moment she knew she was a drama queen\n\nEXTRAS - Performing difficult scenes with children as well as adults and Productions needing to cast big names to get an audience\n\nListen to PART 2 of my conversation with Sharon.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO WINMI\n\nGet access to Audition Stories, the Final Five questions, and other bonus content by becoming a monthly or yearly subscriber to Why Iâll Never Make It.
