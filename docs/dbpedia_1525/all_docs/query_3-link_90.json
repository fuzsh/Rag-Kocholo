        "text": "Great post Domestic Abuse Education üôè THIS IS money PERPETRATORS of Domestic Abuse are costing all of us. GLOBALLY üëá Before anyone assumes this is spent on victims eg refuges, DA organisations etc this is HOW it costs society financially. For reference, Serious Organised Crime costs half this amount at ¬£37 billion per year yet has dedicated units, task forces etc. Our UK fiscal black hole was less than this and warranted immediate Government action. The human costs are off the scale every day, but even if that's not enough as it seems not to be, the breakdown below, which highlights the fiscal costs that come from, not to, victims of domestic abuse even without the fiscal fraud by perpetrators figures, the civil court costs perpetrators force victims and courts into etc, should trigger action. The question is, why isn't it? The costs to business often out strips their profits. IT IS ASO TAXPAYER MONEY. In the UK the current Home Office estimate is ¬£78 billion per year in England and Wales alone. And rising. In the EU, it‚Äôs ¬£366 billion per year. And rising. In 2014, Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated the cost of violence against women in Australia at $21.7 billion a year, with VICTIMS BEARING THE PRIMARY BURDEN OF THIS COST . Governments bear the second biggest cost burden, estimated at $7.8 billion a year, comprising health, administration and social welfare costs PwC also stated that if no further action is taken to prevent violence against women, they estimated that costs will accumulate to $323.4 billion Australian dollars over a thirty year period from 2014-15 to 2044-45. In the US, in 2014, their government broke it down for us - the estimated population economic burden was nearly $3.6 trillion. This estimate included $2.1 trillion in medical costs - , $1.3 trillion in lost productivity among victims and perpetrators, $73 billion in criminal justice activities, and $62 billion in other costs, including victim property loss or damage. Government sources pay an estimated $1.3 trillion of the lifetime economic burden. #domesticabuseiseverybodysbusiness For more information on what you and your organisation can do üëáüëáüëá Employers' Initiative on Domestic Abuse Surviving Economic Abuse (SEA)"
