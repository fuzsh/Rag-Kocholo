This study provides detailed description of a newly-discovered Callicarpa yongshunensis Wen B. Xu, Xiao D. Li &amp; Yan Ling Liu (Lamiaceae) species from Hunan, China. The species shares similarities in the inflorescence, glandular colour and leaf shape features with C. luteopunctata H. T. Chang and C. giraldii Hesse ex Rehd., while its white fruits are similar to those of C. longifolia Lamk. However, its procumbent, evergreen shrub and white fruits are distinctly different from those of C. luteopunctata and C. giraldii, while its procumbent, scarless nodes and stellate pubescence free fruits distinguishes it from C. longifolia. Images, distribution, morphological features, molecular phylogenetic classification and conservation assessment of this new Callicarpa species are explored.
