        "text": "Abstract\n\nInformation on chromosomes and estimation of genome size could be applied to study the evolution and classification of a genus. In our study, the conventional pressing method was applied to prepare microscope slides for counting the chromosomes, and the chromosome numbers of all surveyed species were 2n=32, 34, 36, 38. The first-time determination of chromosome counts for 12 taxa and karyotypes for 16 taxa in Callicarpa were conducted. It exposed all the species with a higher ratio of m chromosomes and a lower ratio of sm chromosomes, and only C. macrophylla contained st chromosome pair. The minor differences between the karyotypes of all species revealed that the karyotype diversity of this genus evolved from a tiny variation of chromosome structure. Meanwhile, the genome size of 23 samples from 16 taxa of Callicarpa has been estimated by flow cytometry. The genome size ranged from 0.96 pg (C. pedunculata) to 1.26 pg (C. nudiflora), averaged out at 1.12 pg, and the variation of genome sizes was fine among the investigated species. Hence, it could also be referred from the viewpoints of cytology that Callicarpa was a group in Lamiaceae that evolved earlier and independently.\n\nCallicarpa is one of the new members of Lamiaceae. Approximately, 140 species were found worldwide (Chen and Gilbert 1994, Bramley 2011, 2013), mainly in the tropical and subtropical areas, especially in the Asia, America, Australia, and some Pacific Islands of the temperate zone (Fang 1982, Chen and Gilbert 1994, Bramley 2011, 2013). Fourty-eight species and 13 varieties of them grow in China, commonly in the Southern provinces of the Yangtze River and Taiwan, and the individual case could spread to North China or even further (Chen and Gilbert 1994, Ma 2013). As a traditional medicinal plant group, the genus harbors significant economic and pharmacological importance (Tu et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2021, Zheng et al. 2021, Pu et al. 2022). Besides, some species of this genus are well-received ornamental plants, such as C. dichotoma, C. japonica, and C. americana (Bir and Conner 1997, Greer and Dole 2009, Bramley 2009, 2013). Callicarpa was assigned to Verbenaceae for a long time, and then Harley et al. (2004) proposed transferring it into Lamiaceae based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence. Except for numerous phytochemistry and pharmacological studies, the taxonomy and systematic evolution of this genus were mainly based on morphology (Bramley 2009, 2011, 2013, Ma and Su 2016), palynology (Ma et al. 2016) and molecular phylogeny (Li et al. 2016, Cai et al. 2021, Zhao et al. 2021, Liu et al. 2022). In addition, leaf geometric morphometric analyses were also applied as a new approach to identify the species within the genus (Danila and Alejandro 2021). In the recent two or three decades, the systematic position of Callicarpa in Lamiaceae was controversial (Harley et al. 2004). With the in-depth development of molecular systematics, it has been proved that there was a sister relationship between Callicarpa and the subfamily Prostantheroideae endemic in Australia, and both formed a basal clade in Lamiaceae (Ma 2013, Li et al. 2016, Cai et al. 2021, Zhao et al. 2021). Recently, more comprehensive phylogenic studies on the framework of Lamiaceae suggested establishing a new monotypic subfamily Callicarpoideae (Zhao et al. 2021).\n\nThe size of the chromosome is correlated to the evolutionary degree of species (Mehra and Bawa 1969). Besides, research on chromosome number can be an important basis for breeding workers (Fehr 1991). In a bid to make a profound study on angiosperm, focusing on its chromosome number and ploidy level is vital in plant classification and systematic evolution (Levin and Wilson 1976, Guerra 2008, Bennett and Leitch 2011, Jang et al. 2013, 2018). Cytological analysis of Callicarpa, however, was only confined to chromosome number, and there was short of research on the karyotype of this genus (Sugiura 1936, Lewis 1961, Sharma and Mukhopadhyay 1963, Santamour 1965, Mehra and Bawa 1969, Mehra 1972, Ono 1975, Contreras and Ruter 2011). So far, the chromosome number of 14 species of Callicarpa has been recorded in the online Chromosome Counts Database (CCDB, version.1.60, http://ccdb.tau.ac.il/home; Supplementary file 1, Table S1). In recent years, there were lack of reports on the chromosomes of Callicarpa, and the related reports began with C. japonica (2n=32, Sugiura 1936), and this improper result seemed to have been quoted on many occasions. Subsequently the quotation from Sugiura (1936) published result led to a confusion regarding the basic number of Callicarpa. Until Lewis (1961) worked out the correct conclusion that 2n=18 was the counts of C. japonica, and provided the chromosome counts of C. americana, 2n=36. But it’s worth paying attention to that the basic number of this genus were mainly x=9, 16, 17, 18, 68 in the current reports. Meanwhile, it has been reported the multiple chromosome numbers in the same species, such as C. glabra, 2n=32, 34; C. subpubescens, 2n=30, 34 (Ono 1975); C. macrophylla, 2n=32, 34 (Sharma and Mukhopadhyay 1963) and C. tomentosa, 2n=136, 170 (Mehra and Bawa 1969). All these indicated that the aneuploidy likely existed in this genus. In the reports of cytological research, C. macrophylla (2n=68) and C. salicifolia (2n=68) were confirmed as tetraploid plants, and polyploidy was discovered in the genus, after the genome size of 14 species estimated by flow cytometry (Contreras and Ruter 2011).\n\nThe statistics of variation of genome size are conducive to better understanding the phylogenetic relationships of plant groups and delimiting affine groups (Ohri 1998, Bottini et al. 2000, Mishiba et al. 2000, Zonneveld 2001). Considering there is always a very high similarity between C-values of the related species, the acquisition of genome size is of great significance for building a phylogenetic tree, identifying the hybrids, and analyzing the interspecific relationship, ulteriorly contributes to the studies of genomics, physiological ecology, and evolutionary biology (Grotkopp et al. 2004, Greilhuber et al. 2005, Pellicer et al. 2018). The variations in genome size and chromosome numbers are usually regarded as the important basis for plant classification and systematic evolution (Suda et al. 2003, Bennett and Leitch 2011, Jang et al. 2016). There were sparse reports on the chromosomes and C-values of Callicarpa. Thus, this study is (1) to specify the chromosome numbers of 16 taxa of Callicarpa in China, (2) to establish the statistics of karyotype, (3) and to estimate the genome size of the investigated species, so as to lay a foundation for the cytological study and to shed some light on the taxonomic study of Callicarpa from the perspective of cytology.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPlant material\n\nTo conduct karyotype observation, the living plants were collected from the fields in Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan provinces, China (Table 1) and cultivated in pots in the greenhouse of Guangxi University, China. All the examined and certificated voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Agriculture College, Guangxi University (GAUA).\n\nTable 1.

Afterward, root tips were stained with 1% aceto-orcein, flattened and placed under the microscope for observation and photographing. The karyotype formula was based on the measurement of chromosomes at mitotic metaphase gained from photographs, karyotype classification standard of Stebbins (1971) was adopted and the symbols for describing the chromosomes by Levan et al. (1964) were followed: m=median centromeric chromosome with arm ratio of 1.0–1.7; sm=submedian centromeric chromosome with arm ratio of 1.7–3.0; st=subterminal centromeric chromosome with arm ratio of 3.0–7.0; t=terminal centromeric chromosome with arm ratio of 7.0–∞.\n\nThe mean length (ML), total length (TKL), and other information about the chromosomes were adopted to conduct the karyotype analysis. Karyotype asymmetry was evaluated respectively by chromosomal asymmetry index A1 and interchromosomal asymmetry index A2 (Zarco 1986). The adopted formulas were A1=1−[∑(b/B)/n] and A2=s/x, where, b was the average length of the short arm in each group of homologous chromosomes, B was the average length of the long arm in each group of homologous chromosomes, n was the number of chromosome group, s and x were the standard deviation and average value of chromosome length respectively. In addition, the karyotype asymmetry coefficient (Arano 1963) was quoted to evaluate the karyotype asymmetry.\n\nGenome size measurements\n\nSolanum lycopersicum L. (900 Mb/1C, Sato et al. 2012) was referred to as the internal standard to determine the genome sizes of 23 plants of Callicarpa. About 20 to 50 mg of fresh tissues were chopped by using a razor blade in 1 mL of LB01 buffer (15 mM Tris, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 0.5 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, adjust to pH 7.5 with 1 M NaOH, add mercaptoethanol to 15 mM.). The cell culture was collected by gentle pipetting and filtered through a 400-mesh nylon strainer. The samples, before the analysis by using a MoFlol-XDP flow cytometer (Beckman), were stained with 100 µg mL−1 propidium iodide (PI) simultaneously with 100 µg mL−1 RNase in an ice bath for 10 min. The fluorescence of the nucleus was measured by using the MoFlol-XDP high-speed flow cytometer with a 70-µm ceramic nozzle at 60 psi sheath pressure. PI fluorescence was performed by a solid-state laser (488 nm) and a 625/26 nm HQ band-pass filter. The FL3-Height/SSC-Height gate method was used to eliminate debris, cell fragments, and dead cells. Single cells and double cells were distinguished by using FL3-Height/FL3-Area. Each sample was measured three times and their average values were taken. The coefficient values (CVs) of the measured samples were lower than 5% and never exceeded 10% (Jang et al. 2018).\n\nResults\n\nChromosome numbers and karyotypes of Callicarpa\n\nThe chromosome numbers were counted in 20 populations representing 16 taxa of Callicarpa, and the chromosome counts of 12 taxa in the genus were observed for the first time, with the basic number: x=16, 17, 18, 19. Mitotic metaphase chromosomes were shown in Fig. 1. For the chromosome numbers, C. rubella f. angustata was 2n=32; C. macrophylla, C. pedunculta, C. cathayana, C. longipes, C. nudiflora, C. longifolia var. floccosa, C. kwangtungensis and C. integerrima were 2n=34, respectively; C. rubella, C. rubella f. crenata and C. kochiana were 2n=36; C. bodinieri and C. tingwuensis were 2n=38. The occurrence of B-chromosome was found in C. rubella var. subglabra and C. dichotoma, i.e., 2n=34+B (Table 1, Fig. 1N). There was no polyploidy discovered while conducting the chromosome counts for three populations of C. macrophylla. However, a few endopolyploid cells were found when observing the chromosomes at the metaphase of cell division of this species.\n\nFig. 1. Mitotic metaphase chromosomes in Callicarpa.

The karyotype formulas and parameters of each species were shown in Table 2, and their karyotype models were shown in Fig. 2. Our results indicated that the karyotypes of species surveyed in this genus were symmetrical. Except that C. macrophylla had a pair of st chromosomes (Fig. 2E), the chromosomes of all species were almost m and sm, and were very small with an average length of 1.69 µm. C. kochiana was with the shortest average chromosome length (1.42 µm) in the somatic cells. While C. nudiflora was with the longest average chromosome length of 2.04 µm. The total length ranged from 48.68 µm (C. longipes) to 71.46 µm (C. bodinieri). The karyotypes were classified as 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, all of which were relatively symmetrical karyotypes. In addition, satellites were observed in the short arm of chromosomes of some species, for instance, in the short arm of the first pair of chromosomes of C. nudiflora, the 10th of C. rubella, and the third of C. rubella var. subglabra (Fig. 2).\n\nTable 2.

Except for C. rubella, C. pedunculata and C. macrophylla, the genome sizes of the remaining 13 taxa were reported for the first time. Additionally, the nuclear DNA content of plants from 23 populations was determined, and the samples used here were the same as the individuals from which the chromosome numbers (Table 1) were obtained. Using internal standards to analyze DNA content, clear peaks were found, and CVs were less than 5%. The estimated values of haploid genome size ranged between 0.48 pg (C. pedunculata) and 0.63 pg (C. nudiflora) with an average value of 0.56 pg, indicating the small differences in haploid genome sizes between species.\n\nFig. 3. Representative flow cytometry results for Callicarpa. (A) C. rubella f. angustata (2n=32, 2C=1.18 pg), (B) C. macrophylla (2n=34, 2C=1.14 pg), (C) C. kochiana (2n=36, 2C=1.11 pg), (D) C. bodinieri (2n=38, 2C=1.23 pg).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe basic number of 16 taxa analyzed in this study were mainly x=17 (most) and x=16, 18 (rare), and it was proposed for the first time that the basic number x=19 occurred in C. bodinieri and C. tingwuensis, i.e., 2n=2x=38 (Table 1, Fig. 1). According to the chromosome records of the genus available in CCBD among 14 species, the basic number of C. japonica was x=9, and the remaining C. acuminata, C. macrophylla, C. nishimurae, C. psilocalyx were x=17; C. americana, C. dichotoma, C. pedunculata, C. longifolia were x=18; C. tomentosa was x=68. That, Contreras and Ruter (2011) reported the existence of diploid (2n=2x=34) and tetraploid (2n=4x=68) populations in C. macrophylla. However, in our study, the chromosome numbers of the three populations of C. macrophylla were 2n=2x=34, and no polyploidy was found either. Further, our chromosome counts of C. rubella (2n=2x=36) and C. pedunculata (2n=2x=34) differed from that of C. rubella (2n=34) and C. pedunculata (2n=36) that Contreras and Ruter (2011) reported, and perhaps there were different basic number occurring in these two groups, i.e., C. rubella (2n=34, 36) and C. pedunculata (2n=34, 36). Herein, our study also supported the existence of aneuploidy in Callicarpa. Moreover, it turned out that chromosome studies, to a certain extent, could help us to distinguish related species. During field observation, the complex C. rubella group (proposed in this study), composed of C. rubella, C. rubella var. subglabra, C. rubella f. crenata and C. rubella f. angustata always brought great trouble for botanists. Morphologically, it was a headache to distinguish C. rubella f. crenata and C. rubella f. angustata from their original variant C. rubella as they shared very short petiole or subsessile and cordate leaf base (Fang 1982, Chen and Gilbert 1994, Leeratiwond et al. 2009). Furthermore, the pollen morphology among them was also extremely similar. For example, they all had tricolpate and raised, coarsely granulate pollen (Ma et al. 2016). C. rubella and C. rubella f. crenata had equal chromosome numbers (2n=36). But, a pair of satellite chromosomes were observed in C. rubella; C. rubella f. angustata (2n=32) and C. rubella var. subglabra (2n=34+B) had different chromosome numbers, which could be used as the supplementary characters for distinguishing them from each other (Table 1, Fig. 1). Similarly, it was tough to distinguish C. longipes from C. rubella f. crenata due to their similar leaf size and shape, and floral traits (Fang 1982), which could be achieved through identifying their chromosome numbers, i.e., C. longipes (2n=34), C. rubella f. crenata (2n=36). Besides, C. cathayana (2n=34) and C. bodinieri (2n=38) were all with red glands on the whole plant (Fang 1982) and it was hard to differentiate them from each other. Nevertheless, chromosome counts could also be applied as the basis for their classification. Furthermore, according to the data from CCDB, the chromosome of C. longifolia was 2n=2x=36, and the chromosome of its variety C. longifolia var. floccosa surveyed in this study was 2n=2x=34, which might be used as the cytological evidence for sub-specific taxonomy of C. longifolia.\n\nStebbins (1971) pointed out that the karyotype evolutionary trend in the plant kingdom was from symmetry to asymmetry. Therefore, in phylogeny, relatively ancient or primitive plants tended to have more symmetrical karyotypes, while the asymmetrical karyotypes were usually found in derivatives or more advanced plants. According to the karyotype classification system of Stebbins (1971), the karyotypes observed in this study could be classified as 1A, 2A, 1B, and 2B, such as the karyotype of C. kwangtungensis was 1A, C. macrophylla was 2A, C. bodinieri, and seven other species were 1B, and the karyotypes of C. cathayana and five other species were 2B (Table 2). In Callicarpa, species had different As.K% values, while the differences were not significant, which ranged from 54.89% (C. nudiflora) to 62.57% (C. integerrima) (Table 2). In addition, the chromosomes were almost median centromeric or submedian centromeric, which indicated these species were comparatively primitive in the terms of overall phylogeny. Shortly, to sum up, we concluded from the perspective of cytology that Callicarpa was a relatively primitive group in Lamiaceae, which has been proved by previous studies of palynology and molecular phylogeny (Ma et al. 2016, Li et al. 2016, Cai et al. 2021, Zhao et al. 2021).\n\nThis study reported the variations ranged from 0.96 to 1.26 pg of genome size for 16 taxa of Callicarpa from China (Table 1). The fine variation of haploid genome size, combined with the close basic number of chromosomes (x=16, 17, 18, 19), sufficiently revealed that there was a minute difference in chromosome sizes between various groups in Callicarpa. However, the 2C-values of C. pedunculata from two different populations were the lowest, which might be applied to its potential taxonomic characters. As far as we know that the estimated genome size ranged from 1.34 to 3.48 pg with an average of 1.74 pg, particularly the polyploidy occurred in C. salicifolia and C. macrophylla (Contreras and Ruter 2011). The polyploid plants have never been found in this study, and the 2C-values of 16 taxa (0.96–1.26 pg) were universally lower than that of Callicarpa reported in previous studies (1.34–3.48 pg, Contreras and Ruter 2011). Leitch et al. (2005) suggested that the genome size of terrestrial plants in the evolutionary trend was to become larger, and the more primitive the plant was, the smaller its genome size would be. Furthermore, according to the genome size of 107 species from 39 genera in Lamiaceae obtained from the Plant DNA C-values Database (https://cvalues.science.kew.org/, Supplementary file: Table S2), their 2C-values fell within the range from 0.72 pg (Ocimum tenuiflorum) to 12.90 pg (Eremostachys laciniate), with a mean of 2.52 pg. The genome size of Callicarpa studied here was small, which to some extent supported the previous speculation that Callicarpa was a relatively primitive group in Lamiaceae (Ma 2013, Li et al. 2016, Cai et al. 2021, Zhao et al. 2021). When observing some individuals such as C. kochiana and C. macrophylla, different ploidy (2n=ca 68) was found in some cells, which suggested there might be endopolyploidy existing in these cells. For having a better understanding on this phenomenon, further studies with flow cytometry will be urgently needed in the future.\n\nIn brief, our study conducted basic research on the karyotypes and the genome sizes of Callicarpa in China, providing the chromosome numbers of 12 taxa, the genome sizes of 13 taxa, and the karyotypes of 16 taxa for the first time. The diversity of chromosome numbers of species could be the potential evidence for interspecific classification in this genus. The chromosome karyotypes of the genus were comparatively symmetrical, which were almost m and sm chromosomes. Compared to the existing statistics of Lamiaceae, the genome sizes of Callicarpa were lower than the average, and the 2C-values were small. In view of both cytological data, our study also supported that Callicarpa evolved earlier and independently in the family Lamiaceae. However, because the chromosome of Callicarpa is small, it is considerable difficulty to analyze with traditional cytological methodology. To better understand the evolution of the number of chromosomes in this genus, it is necessary to apply 5S and 35S rDNAs FISH and other novel methods for in-depth research (Weiss-Schneeweiss et al. 2012, Rosato et al. 2015, Jang et al. 2018).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31760045, 31970220, and 32060098), Guangxi Science and Technology Program (Grant No. AB19259010), Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province (Grant No. 2018GXNSFAA281132) and Foundation of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Sugarcane Biology (Grant No. GXKLSCB-202004).\n\nNotes\n\nWith Supplementary files.\n\nFigures & tables\n\nSupplementary materials\n\nResult List"
