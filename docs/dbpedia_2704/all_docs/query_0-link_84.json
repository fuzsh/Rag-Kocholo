This province was the origin of various medicinal plants such as tabat barito, akar kuning, pasak bumi and some other medicinal plants that were useful for human health. Methods: This paper explain about inhibitory test extracts etanol of Hati Tanah (Angiotepris Sp) tubers and Sangkareho leaves (Callicarpa longifolia Lam.) in Staphylococcus aureus bacteria with concentration 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15%. Both plants has been utilized by the community as a traditional medicine to treat minor to moderate injuries such as postpartum. Results: The results for extract Hati Tanah was 15.63 mm, 16.97 mm, 25.42 mm, 28.40 mm and the results for and Sangkareho leaves was 1 mm, 2.68 mm, 3.9 mm, 6.2 mm. Inhibitory test studies have also been performed on the N-Butanol fraction from ethanol extract Hati Tanah tubers of the soil at the same concentrations and bacteria. The inhibited zone results was 15.65 mm, 23.20 mm, 24.15 mm, 26.25 mm. Conclusion: Medicinal forest plants origin of Central Kalimantan is Hati Tanah tubers and Sangkareho leaves has potential as a traditional medicine in inhibiting and killing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria."
