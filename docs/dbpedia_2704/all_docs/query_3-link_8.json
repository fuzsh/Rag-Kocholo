        "text": "Foliage Leaves are ovate (egg-shaped) to elliptical (oval) or oblong-lanceolate (intermediate between elongated with parallel sides to lance-shaped). The leaf tip is wedge-shaped or narrowing to a short tip. The leaf underside is yellowish brown with a velvety texture. Flowers Small, light to medium purple flowers (2.5 mm long) are arranged in a 2-3 cm long inflorescence known as a cyme (3-4 cm wide). The petals are surrounded by 4 triangular sepals which form a cup-like structure covered in greyish yellow matted hairs. Each flower has 5 stamens which are about twice as long as the petals (5 mm long). The peduncle (stalk of the inflorescence) is longer than the petiole (leaf stalk). Fruit Purple, violet or pink fleshy berry-like fruits (2 mm wide) are actually drupes (fleshy fruits that contain hard pits with seeds inside). Round fruits (2-4 mm wide) are densely arranged in small clusters in or slightly above the leaf axil (the angle between the upper leaf surface and stem). Etymology The genus Callicarpa is derived from the Greek words 'kalli' meaning beautiful and 'karpos' meaning fruit. The species name refers to the attractive, often brightly coloured fruits produced by members of this genus. Ethnobotanical Uses Medicinal: According to folk medicine, the whole plant can be used to reduce pain and inflammation, as well as control internal bleeding."
