        "text": "Genus of flowering plants\n\nThis article is about the genus of flowering plants. For other genera with this name, see Dianella.\n\nDianella Dianella sp. Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae Clade: Tracheophytes Clade: Angiosperms Clade: Monocots Order: Asparagales Family: Asphodelaceae Subfamily: Hemerocallidoideae Genus: Dianella\n\nLam. ex Juss.[1] Synonyms[1]\n\nDiana Comm. ex Lam.\n\nDianella is a genus of about forty species of flowering plants in the monocot family Asphodelaceae, commonly known as flax lilies.[2] Plants in this genus are tufted herbs with more or less linear leaves and bisexual flowers with three sepals more or less similar to three petals and a superior ovary, the fruit a berry. They occur in Africa, South-east Asia, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nSeveral species of this genus, or the whole genus, are sometimes referred to by the common name blue flax lily, particularly in Australia.[3][4]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nPlants in the genus Dianella are tufted perennial, rhizomatous herbs with fibrous or fleshy roots, more or less linear leaves with their bases overlapping, bisexual flowers with three sepals more or less similar to three blue, purple or white petals and a superior ovary, and the fruit a berry.[5][6][7][8]\n\nTaxonomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Dianella was first formally published by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1786 in his Encyclopédie Méthodique,[9] but this did not validly establish the name because Lamarck did not include a description of the new genus.[10] Antoine Laurent de Jussieu made it a correct name in 1789 when he published a description in the first edition of his Genera Plantarum.[11][12] The name Dianella is a reference to the Roman goddess Diana with the suffix ella meaning \"small\".[13]\n\nThe genus Dianella is closely related to Thelionema and Herpolirion.[14]\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\n[edit]\n\nPlants in the genus Dianella occur in Africa, South-east Asia, the Pacific Islands including Hawaii, New Zealand and Australia. About half of the species are native to Australia.[15]\n\nSpecies list\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a list of Dianella species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at October 2020:\n\nUses\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral species of Dianella are grown for their attractive foliage and shiny, blue to purple berries.[16]\n\nReports of the edibility of the fruit range from very poisonous[17][18] to sweet and nutty (such as D. caerulea),[19] and the beach flax lily (D. congesta) is reportedly the best-tasting.[20]\n\nThe leaves are used to weave dillies and baskets by Indigenous Australians.[20]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of plants known as lily\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
