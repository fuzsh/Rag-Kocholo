        "text": "Physicochemical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Callicarpa macrophylla was carried out. Physicochemical values such as moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash and water soluble ash were determined as 73.8, 2.6, 1.5 and 0.4 % respectively. Extractive values were also determined and the percentage yield of petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and aqueous extracts were 0.8, 2.6, 3.4 and 9.20% respectively. Phytochemical screening of different extracts showed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and steroids in petroleum ether extract; flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids and glycosides in chloroform extract; flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, glycosides and saponins in methanol extract and flavonoids, tannins, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, glycosides and saponins in aqueous extracts. The study provides the phytochemical basis of various pharmacological activities of the plant.\n\nCallicarpa species Family: Verbenaceae has been a source of antimicrobials. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the hydro-alcoholic (70% alcohol in water) extract of its leaves. The zone of inhibition by cup plate method was determined at concentrations (100, 200, and 300 mg/ml) and compared to that of the standards-Amikacin (0.01mg/ml) for antibacterial and Fluconazole (0.01mg/ml) for antifungal. The test organisms used were Gram Positive bacteria -Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Gram Negative bacteria- Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungal strains: Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium chrysogenum.Fluconazole exhibited a zone of inhibition of 51-52 mm and the extracts: 29-34 mm against fungal strains. Amikacin exhibited a zone of inhibition of 42 mm in gram negative organisms and 45 mm in gram positive organisms, whereas the extracts exhibited a zone of inhibition of 24-28 mm. From the above results, it can be concluded that the hydro alcoholic extract of the leaves of Callicarpa arborea exhibited significant antifungal activity and, antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria, in a dose dependant manner as compared to that of the standard.\n\nObjective: The main objectives of this study was to analyze the phytochemicals, determine the total flavonoid content, brine shrimp toxicity, antibacterial activity, evaluate the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic activities of nine medicinal plants Callicarpamacrophylla, Bauhinia purpurea, Plumeriarubra, Girardiniadiversifolia, Acacia nilotica, Woodfordiafruticosa (Bark) Woodfordiafruticosa (flower), Terminaliaalata, and Premnabarbata. Methods: The cold percolation method was adopted for the extraction of secondary metabolites in methanol. The preliminary phytochemical analysis was performed by colour differentiation methods. The radical scavenging activity was evaluated by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method. The antidiabetic activity was performed by α-amylase enzyme inhibition activity. The chemical constituent was isolated by column chromatography from the biologically active plant fraction. Results: The phytochemical investigation has shown plants are the rich s...\n\nPresent communication deals with the study of Pharmacognostical, phytochemical screening and antihepatotoxic activity prediction of compounds isolated from Callicarpa macrophylla Linn in order to search lead compound. Dried leaves and bark powder material was used for determination of ash value, extractive value, and phytochemical constituents. fifteen compounds from the whole plant of Callicarpa macrophylla were subjected to molecular properties prediction and drug-likeness by Lipinski rule of five & Molinspiration software. Phytochemical screening proved the presence of chemical constituent like tannins, alkaloids, proteins, starch, flavanoids, and glycoside. 12 compounds of the plant fulfill the requirements of Drug likeness were taken for biological activity calculation with the help of Molinspiration software and compared with standard drug Silibinin. Calliterpenone monoacetate almost fulfills the Lipinski rule of five and showed good bioactivity score than Silibinin. Out of 15 compounds Calliterpenone, Ursolic acid, Crategolic acid, β-Sitosterol, Betulinic acid, Luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, Apigenin-7-O-glucuronide and Calliterpenone monoacetate has good bioactivity score as compared to Silibinin which is potent hepatoprotective drug. So these compounds can be considered as lead compounds with hepatoprotective activity from Callicarpa macrophylla.\n\nTriterpenoids extracted and preliminary identifed from raw bark extract of Callicarpa arborea Roxb by applying phytochemical screening test and high performance l iquid chromatography (HPLC) identification have bee n done. Triterpenoids found that contained in the extract h ave a semi-polar polarity direction. One dominant t riterpenoid compounds were observed in the observation by HPLC. Application for the use of preparative HPLC can be suggested for the next stage of structure elucidati on\n\nThe present study is aimed at development of physicochemical parameters and to investigate the active principle present in Caesalpinia bonduc. Caesalpinia bonduc (Cucurbitaceae) commonly known as Ivy Gourd is an important plant used against various disorders in indigenous system of medicine such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, laxative , used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and immune system modulator. Thus from the extensive literature survey it was revealed that no reports were available on microscopic evaluation, standardization parameters and chemo profile of Caesalpinia bonduc and to check the identity and purity of the drug. The present work embodies the investigations carried out to establish methods for quality control of drugs as per who guidelines which includes macroscopical features, physicochemical parameters like loss on drying, foreign matter, extractive value, ash value and to investigate the phytochemical present in the extract in the preliminary level with r...\n\nThe essential oil from the leaves of Callicarpa arborea Roxb. growing wild in Vietnam, was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry. The major constituents of leaves of C. arborea were β-selinene (23.9%), ar-turmerone (17.5%) and α-copaene (8.9%), with lesser concentrations of caryophyllene oxide (4.9%) and ar-turmerol (3.9%). The chemical composition of this essential oil sample is being reported for the first time."
