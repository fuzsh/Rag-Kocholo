        "text": "Physicochemical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Callicarpa macrophylla was carried out. Physicochemical values such as moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash and water soluble ash were determined as 73.8, 2.6, 1.5 and 0.4 % respectively. Extractive values were also determined and the percentage yield of petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and aqueous extracts were 0.8, 2.6, 3.4 and 9.20% respectively. Phytochemical screening of different extracts showed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and steroids in petroleum ether extract; flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids and glycosides in chloroform extract; flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, glycosides and saponins in methanol extract and flavonoids, tannins, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, glycosides and saponins in aqueous extracts. The study provides the phytochemical basis of various pharmacological activities of the plant.\n\nThe physico-chemical and spectroscopic characterization of five selected medicinal plants viz., Acalypha indica, Senna tora, Euphorbia hirta, Physalis angulata and Ziziphus mauritina are the essence and has been carried out to assess bioactive potential and to establish traditional belief in the light of scientific interpretation. Fresh leaves were collected from Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal, India, dried and powdered for Proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and compositional analysis, FTIR and GCMS. The study revealed that the highest concentration of Volatile matter (75.452%), Bulk density (0.256 %), Swelling index (1.456 %), Cellulose content (61.727 %), Hemicellulose content (4.372 %) and Tannins (0.635 g/ 100g) was observed to occur in Acalypha indica leaf than other experimental plants. In Physalis angulata the percentage composition of fixed carbon (15.251%) and extractive content (1.974 %) was higher than others. Ash content (12.327 %), hemicellulose content (4.372 %), and lignin content (5.531 %) were observed to be higher in the Senna tora leaf than others. Total carbohydrate concentrations (9.619 gm/100 gm) and nitrogen content (2.050 %) were observed to be higher in Euphorbia hirta than others. Total protein (2.321 gm/100 gm), total fat (0.655 gm/100 gm), oxygen content (34.222 %) and Higher heat value (HHV) (16.546 %) were higher in Ziziphus mauritina than others. The existence of functional groups and the relevance of the presence of a specific bioactive component were determined using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) of the leaves of five plant samples. According to GCMS (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy), five different medicinal plants contain significant bioactive chemicals. By using GC-MS analysis, a total of 10 bioactive compounds (Acalypha indica, Senna tora) and 8 bioactive compounds (Ziziphus mauritina, Euphorbia hirta, Physalis Angulata) were found in the peaks of methanolic extracts of five potential medicinal plants. The bioactive compounds like Cyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyl-, Dodecane, 1-Fluoro-, Myo-Inositol, 4-C-Methyl obtained from Acalypha indica leaf extract, Palmitic Acid, Phthalic Acid, Cyclopentadecanol obtained from Senna tora leaf extract and 4-Tert-Octylphenol, TMS Derivative obtained from Euphorbia hirta leaf extract has no records of individual bioactivity as per Dr. Duke’s ethnobotanical and pharmaceutical database and are considered as novel bioactive compounds. Isolation of these compounds and successive bioactivity studies should be the thrust area for future researchers. Also, the current study confirms that specific plant leaves are a great source of important phytochemicals and can be used to make herbal formulations, practical medications, and complementary medicines.\n\nObjective: The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the antioxidant activity of (EA and E) ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of (CM) Callicarpa macrophylla. Methods: The physiochemical parameters were assessed according to guidelines given by the world health organization. The total content of phenols and flavonoids was assessed by Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride methods. In vitro, antioxidant activity was screened by (DPPH) 1, 1-diphenyl-2picrylhydrazyl and(H 2 O 2) hydrogen peroxide scavenging and reducing power assay. Results: The physicochemical parameters fulfilled the standards of WHO guidelines. Total phenol and flavonoid content were more in ethanol extract as compared to ethyl acetate extract of CM. The antioxidant activity of ethanol extract was further high as compared to ethyl acetate extract of Callicarpa macrophylla. The IC 50 of Callicarpa macrophylla ethanol extract was less than the ethyl acetate extract. So, more antioxidant activity of ethanol extract compared to ethyl acetate extract of CM. Conclusion: Overall, both the extracts showed antioxidant activity and can be used further for diseases that can be managed using antioxidants. Ethanol extract possessed significant antioxidant effects than the ethyl acetate extract.\n\nMedicinal plants make many chemical compounds for biological functions including defense against bacteria, fungi and viruses. The phytochemicals on the human body in exactly the same way as pharmaceutical drugs, herbal medicines can be beneficial and have harmful side effects just like conventional drugs. In the present investigation suggested that the analysis of qualitative and quantitative phytochemicals of medicinal plants with aqueous and methanol solvent extract were performed and the medicinal plant was collected from kalrayan hills, Villupuram district, Tamilnadu. The selected medicinal plants such as Acalypha indica, Chloroxylon swietenia, Cipadessa baccifera, Eupatorium odoratum, Dodoniea viscose, Glycosmis pentaphylla, Mallotus philippensis, Mukia madasapatana, Ocimum gratisimum, Stachyarpheta jamaicenis, Solanum trilobatum, and Vitex trifolia were investigated and analysis of phytochemicals like alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols,reducing sugar saponnins, steroids, terpenoids, and triterpenoids represented in various aspects of strongly presented and some of the phytochmicals also observed. The quantitative phytochemicals such as alkaloids, flavonoids, reducing sugar, saponins, steroids, terpenoids, and triterpenoids were performed from the twelve medicinal plants. Among the twelve medicinal plants, the Eupatorium odoratum was excellent indicative of phytochemicals in qualitatively as well as quantitatively recorded when compared with other medicinal plants with aqueous extract. The medicinal plants are used for discovering and screening of the phytochemical constituents which are very helpful for the preparation of new drugs.\n\nObjectives: Despite the great advances observed in modern medicine in recent decades, plants still make an important contribution to health care. The objectives of this study were to determine the moisture content and antioxidant capacity of the selected medicinal plants. Methods and Materials: The medicinal plants (20) were collected from Kanyakumari district of Tamilnadu. The moisture content of the medicinal plants was analyzed using Infra red moisture analyzer. For the analysis of antioxidants by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl assay) & FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), phenol by Folin-ciocalteau method and flavonoids by aluminium chloride method the leaves was shade dried, powdered and stored in brown bottle containers. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of the medicinal plants were evaluated for their antioxidant capacity All recorded values of Moisture and Antioxidant analysis are mean of triplicates. Results and Discussion: The moisture content of the selected medicinal plants ranged from 36.00 to 89.86%. Blepharis Maderaspatens had highest DPPH activity in both aqueous (8.870) and ethanolic extracts (71.82) expressed in mg of GAE/g dry weight. The antioxidant activity AOA was 5.6 times higher in ethanolic extracts. The Mean DPPH activity of the selected medicinal plants was found to be 3.402±2.22 in aqueous extract and 19.114±17.01 in ethanolic extract. In FRAP, Blepharis Maderaspatens (633.76) had the highest AOA in ethanol extracts and Valarai (300.70) in water extracts expressed in μM of (Ascorbic Acid Equivalence Capacity) AAEC/g. The Mean FRAP value of the selected medicinal plants was found to be 145.44±129.53 in ethanolic extract and 117.96±79.17 in aqueous extracts. Blepharis Maderaspatens had the highest phenolic content in both aqueous (12.8) and ethanolic extracts (35.6). Conclusion: The study concluded that there was a wide difference in antioxidant content among the medicinal plants. The ethanolic extracts revealed the presence of high concentrations of AOA, Total Phenol Content (TPC), and Total Flavanoid Content (TFC) in the medicinal plants than water. Further investigation in quantification of individual antioxidant components in these medicinal plants possessing good free radical scavenging ability is needed.\n\nThe nutritional composition of Calluna vulgaris flowers as well as the phytochemical profile, antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP assays), antimicrobial and cytotoxic (in human immortalized non-tumorigenic keratinocyte and fi-broblasts) activities of aqueous, hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts were evaluated. A high content of fiber and carbohydrates (75%) and the prevalence of α-tocopherol as vitamer deserves attention. Linolenic (35%), linoleic (27%) and palmitic (21%) acids were the most abundant fatty acids. Qualitative and quantitative analysis by LC-MS and 1 NMR indicated high levels of quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin derivatives as well as procyanidins. The hydro-alcoholic extract displayed the highest antioxidant activity and total phenolics (TPC) and flavonoid contents (TFC). No adverse effects on cells were observed until a concentration of 100 μg/mL and a good antimicrobial activity was reported against S. epidermidis and S. aureus with the hydro-alcoholic extract. The data obtained demonstrated that wild plants like heather, although not being a common nutritional reference , can be used in an alimentary base as a source of bioactive compounds, namely antioxidants.\n\nPresent communication deals with the study of Pharmacognostical, phytochemical screening and antihepatotoxic activity prediction of compounds isolated from Callicarpa macrophylla Linn in order to search lead compound. Dried leaves and bark powder material was used for determination of ash value, extractive value, and phytochemical constituents. fifteen compounds from the whole plant of Callicarpa macrophylla were subjected to molecular properties prediction and drug-likeness by Lipinski rule of five & Molinspiration software. Phytochemical screening proved the presence of chemical constituent like tannins, alkaloids, proteins, starch, flavanoids, and glycoside. 12 compounds of the plant fulfill the requirements of Drug likeness were taken for biological activity calculation with the help of Molinspiration software and compared with standard drug Silibinin. Calliterpenone monoacetate almost fulfills the Lipinski rule of five and showed good bioactivity score than Silibinin. Out of 15 compounds Calliterpenone, Ursolic acid, Crategolic acid, β-Sitosterol, Betulinic acid, Luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, Apigenin-7-O-glucuronide and Calliterpenone monoacetate has good bioactivity score as compared to Silibinin which is potent hepatoprotective drug. So these compounds can be considered as lead compounds with hepatoprotective activity from Callicarpa macrophylla."
