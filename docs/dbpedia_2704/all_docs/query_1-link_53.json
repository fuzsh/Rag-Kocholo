        "text": "Sea urchins (Diadema setosum) are marine animals belonging to phylum Echinodermata which are often found in the Wakatobi's waters. Although Indonesia is one of the exporters of sea urchins, the use of sea urchins as medicinal and health food products has not been widely used. This is due to the limited information about the potential active compounds contained in sea urchins from Indonesian waters. This study aimed to determine the bioactivity and antioxidant activity of gonad extract of sea urchin (Diadema setosum). The sample test consisted of several stages, namely extraction by maceration using 96% ethanol solvent, phytochemical test and antioxidant activity testing. The results showed that the ethanol extract of the gonads of sea urchin (Diadema setosum) contained alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids and tannins. The results of the antioxidant activity test of the ethanol extract of the gonads of sea urchin (Diadema setosum) showed that the extract had no potential as an antioxidant because it had IC50 value of > 250 ppm. The IC50 value was 4460.1505 ppm. The novelty of this study resulted in data of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of sea urchin gonads Diadema setosum that are useful for different herbal formulations as anti-tumour, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-fatigue, anti-Parkinson effect, and anti-hypoglycemic.\n\nKeywords: Diadema Setosum, Bioactive Compounds, Antioxidant Activity\n\nDOI：https://doi.org/10.35741/issn.0258-2724.57.1.13\n\nDAHURI, R.
