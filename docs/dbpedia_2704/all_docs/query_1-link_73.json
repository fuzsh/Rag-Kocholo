        "text": "Camp Kulaqua: My First FNPS Retreat\n\nby Mark Kateli, Tarflower Chapter\n\nI thought I knew my FNPS tribe! We were the rough riders of the Florida landscape that understood natural beauty in a manufactured civilization. But here in Camp Kulaqua (run by Seventh Day Adventists) I found pillows, pressed sheets, and (gasp!) Wi-Fi.\n\nAccommodations\n\nBeing a city boy this was certainly a welcomed sight as we are all accustomed to so many amenities that are taken for granted every day. That being said, this was certainly not the retreat I had envisioned in my head- chilly nights, encircled around a campfire in the middle of nowhere, listening to coyotes howling away, and cold showers in the morning. This was, comparatively, upscale living.\n\nOpening Night\n\nFriday was an informal social gathering in the evening by the entrance lobby. I did, as usual, hobnob with some other local chapter members. In particular, I had a long conversation with Ina Crawford of Sweetbay Chapter.It was as though the heavens were listening to my prayer as I was hoping for a very long time to connect with chapter member on the far west coast of Florida where things (including the weather) are a bit different from the rest of us in the peninsular area. Ina mentioned that her chapter is but 35 members strong but they still have monthly presentations and field trips. When asked if it was difficult for her to gather\n\nIan Crawford, an observant, enthusiastic,\n\nand cheerful teacher\n\npresenters to come out to her chapter, she mentioned that her chapter actually has more trouble organizing field trips than anything else. We talked about a lot of various subjects including our love for the wildflower blooms along SR 65. We spoke about getting more kids involved with plants at great length and making inexpensive craft projects to help them develop an ongoing interest with nature.\n\nA Great Idea\n\nSimple and to the Point\n\nI also met with Gail Taylor of Crystal River’s Citrus Chapter. This chapter is in the middle of a total revamp and she had some great ideas for advertising such as buttons which cost her just $30 for 100 buttons Gail was a fountain of new ideas ranging from ideas on yard signage, clear table cloths for plant sales, to attracting “snowbird” memberships.\n\nThe Brochure is Alive & Well, Thank you\n\nSaturday was packed with presentations- including Richard Brownscombe of Broward County’s Coontie Chapter. Donna Bollenbach of Suncoast Chapter, Richard, the Chapter of Council Landscape 101 Committee, and many others, worked together to create a beautiful folded brochure on native landscaping. The first of six versions is for the West Coast Region (Pasco through Collier counties). This has been\n\nRichard Brownscombe presents the \"nearly\" final version of the\n\nnative landscape brochure for the West Coast region\n\nsent to selected FNPS members for final review, and if all goes well, Donna will be putting together the other 5 regions (which are delineated on the FNPS forum webpage) in the next few months.\n\nCraig Huegel has written an introduction in the brochure and there will be tips for native plant landscaping. There will be on-line references, such as our the FNPS website, that will motivate interested readers to further resources.\n\nThese brochures will cost FNPS about $0.30 each to print. Richard has recommended that the chapters sell the final product at $1 per brochure to pay for future printing. Andy Taylor (FNPS Director of Development) and Richard will seek out $20K in funding to do 60,000 copies statewide.\n\nData for Dollars\n\nJuliet Rynearspoke briefly on some data collected on the state and chapter level. As most of you know, FNPS has been driving\n\nJuliet Rynear is a lady\n\non a fact-finding mission.\n\nan initiative for members to track their volunteer hours and report them back to the state. Fifteen chapters replied out of 36 regarding volunteering hours. Of the 15 chapters, 7 of them tracked actually track their volunteer hours. Of these 7 chapters, it was reported they have 4200 accrued volunteer hours! Those 4200 hours are currently valued at $97K! Volunteer hours are worth money to the organization, especially when FNPS is seeking for sponsors and grants.\n\nShirley Denton (Chair of the Communications Committee) has been looking into a software program for an automated system for logging volunteer hours. Everything that we invest in volunteering (from driving to an event, to a board meeting, to working at home individually for FNPS tasks) is valued at $23/hour!\n\nJuliet went on to cite some other data:\n\nFNPS Chapters were involved with 16 pieces of native plant local legislation that were ratified on the county level, with 15 others that are still outstanding.\n\nThere were 91 outreach events with 2400 people attending, 33 education workshops, and 16 school-related activities (Pine Lilly chapter was mentioned as being most heavily invested in school programs).\n\nMost of this information was put together thanks to members who responded to a survey, or by information gathered from the FNPS website calendar. Juliet hopes that these facts help members prepare a “Two-minute elevator conversation” to spread the word and scope of what our society is achieving. She hopes that similar data in the future will help all chapters to grow.\n\nMembership Matters\n\nJonnie Spitler from Nature Coast Chapter presented some additional data put together by Cammie Donaldson’s (FNPS Administration) team. In 2014-2015, the Villages Chapter got 113 members, however FNPS as a whole only gained 56 memberships in total.\n\nJonnie emphasized enthusiasm,\n\nJonnie Spitler-an embodiment\n\nof the go-getter spirit.\n\ninclusion of novices, and being persistent on getting new members to join chapters. Her own chapter has seen rapid growth due to her efforts- from 30 members to about 65 members total. At her chapter meetings, she said everybody begins the meeting by saying FNPS mission statement akin to an anthem. Jonnie mentioned that it’s very important to validate newcomers in front of the entire crowd every single month. When renewals are due, her chapter sends 3 courtesy reminder emails. This strategy has successfully worked for her chapter- Jonnie has reported new members joining her chapter almost every single month.\n\nJonnie also emphasized in her presentation how important it is to have a fun meeting by engaging with people and encouraging happiness. She mentioned that even though FNPS can be science-driven, we should not forget the fun element in a meeting because that’s what will gain the most memberships from “common folks.”\n\nIn the future, Jonnie will be in closer communication with other chapters on membership. She will be giving away prizes for the chapters that have risen most in percentage or numbers. She will keep pushing and focusing on membership at the chapter level, and if the chapter does not have a membership point of contact, she will start reaching out to each chapter president.\n\nGail Taylor, in her revitalization efforts for Citrus Chapter, mentioned that she hands out a welcome packet to new members. Each packet contains a Chapter Newsletters, native plant articles, resources, places to find natives, and more. Gail also sends out a ‘Thank You’ card to new members, as well as people that bring refreshments at the meetings. Just like Jonnie, Gail validates new members in front of her own audience but she also gives new members first choice on plants that are presented for the plant drawings. She hopes that through this visual cue, visitors will be encouraged to return.\n\nShirley Denton is busy gathering data on membership through the CiviCRM program. She hopes that through understanding our members more, we will be able to efficiently gather and connect with the right resources needed for any given project. For example, Shirley mentioned that she has gathered some information on who in the membership is a Master Naturalist, or a Master Gardener through the data, but it is based on an outdated 1998 membership survey. Members who would like to share information about themselves to help the society can reach out to Shirley Denton directly.\n\nAndy Taylor and his undying passion\n\nfor the political theater\n\nPolitical Fineness\n\nAndy Taylor, FNPS Director of Development, did a presentation on elected officials and policy. He mentioned Google Alerts which can be found at google.com/alerts. Basically, you search for any name of your local or state elected official, or a subject, and google alerts will email you current news and articles about that subject. For members who are leery of clogging their email inboxes with multiple google alerts, they can set it up once a day (such as at the end of the day when things have quieted down) in a single lump sum notification.\n\nAndy also gave the following tips when dealing with local and state officials:\n\nLet officials know that you support them (or vice versa) and that you would be happy to provide them more information on native plants. Invite them to an FNPS meeting to a chapter field trip.\n\nKeep the initial emails to politicians short (4 paragraphs or less) and establish yourself as an independent expert in this email, and offer resources for them to research our organization.\n\nAdditionally, Andy noted that almost everything in an email to your policy maker in Florida is classified as a public record and therefore is traceable. He recommends to be careful in your word choice and the content of your email if you support or oppose policies- never bribe elected officials with votes or other favors. This may give developers reason to sue the city or county for a legal challenge in court which is counterproductive to our efforts.\n\nWhen policies are approved or rejected, state and local governments have notification requirements for these decisions to the general public. For more information, you can visit MyFloridaHouse.gov or FLSenate.gov. You can sign up to get email alerts when anything happens on a specific bill.\n\nIf your chapter finds it hard to organize a group during working hours to visit government office, consider inviting the County or City Attorney to your chapter board meeting to present on the progress of a bill.\n\nMany chapters want to influence ordinances to include more natives. But as far as ordinances are concerned, Andy said that unless you have a specific expertise in writing them, it is best not to write your own. County and City attorneys are paid lots of money and no matter what you do, they will have to review for the ordinance for compliance with state law, and revise your work for proper format and preferences.\n\nParting Words of Wisdom\n\nIn conclusion, I did enjoy my time at the camp and extended my native plant family even further.\n\nIf you do make it out to Camp Kulaqua (this is at least the third time FNPS has used this facility), please be advised that due to their religious policies, no caffeinated products (coffee, tea, or soda) are offered. If you are a coffee drinker first thing in the morning like myself, please plan ahead by bringing your own supplies- including your own coffee mug. It will also be wise to locate the nearest hot water outlet or coffee pot in the vicinity before your crabbiness gets the better of you come morning time.\n\nThe meals were above average, with a healthy assortment of fruit, vegetables (fresh and steamed), starch, and protein (fish for lunch, chicken for dinner). I also recommend planning ahead with some additional snacks as dinner was too early for me (5:30 pm), and meals were only available from Saturday morning until breakfast Sunday.\n\nDo attend presentations and meetings, and take notes, but try to go out of your way to connect with other chapter members- after all, we are on the same journey and only together will we be able to make ever-bigger strides.\n\nPosted by Donna Bollenbach\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFind your \"AWESOME\" on a Conference Landscape Tour\n\nSubmitted by Sonya Guidry\n\nThe Pawpaw Chapter of the Florida Native Plant Society recently held a South Volusia Landscape Tour that included many of the native landscapes that will be featured on FNPS Conference Fieldtrip \"K\" Landscape Bus Touron Thursday, May 19th.

I know because I used to ask them myself. Maybe you’ve wondered about the conference as I did.\n\nThere are many people in my group who know so much about plants. They are “experts” and I’m not.\n\nVisit the Park of Honor 755 Olive Street, South Daytona. The Pawpaw\n\nChapter maintains a section in exchange for a meeting place at the\n\nnearby Piggotte Community Center. Just enter the park,\n\nturn right and look for the pollinators!\n\nWhile it is true the Florida Native Plant Society is a scientific based organization (and aren’t we glad it is?), the rest of us get the benefits of all the science based information out there. With the help of FNPS, we can make decisions about our yards, our neighborhoods, and our general community based of facts. The conference is the best place to learn from the real experts!\n\nIt is a huge time commitment and I have other obligations.\n\nThis was also part of my hesitation to attend a conference. So, I started in small bits. I attended one conference for a day and was hooked with all the excitement of learning so many new things all at one time. On other occasions, I was only able to attend one field trip per conference, rather than two. This year the basic field trips are free. Each trip is included in a day’s conference fee. The field trips are unique to the area, but you learn so much about our state by just being there!\n\nDo I really want to attend the socials?\n\nSome people think skipping the socials is a way to cut down on the cost of the weekend. But, in reality, the socials are a way to “unpack your brain” after a day filled with information and meet new, like-minded folks from around the state. Also, the socials provide a way to showcase the area of the convention. In Daytona Beach’s case, we get to enjoy the beautiful beach atmosphere at two of our venues. The Saturday venue features our newest attraction: The Cici and Hayatt Brown Museum of Art, adjacent to the Museum of Arts and Sciences. The MOAS tells us this collection is the largest collection of Florida-based art in the world. All this is included in the cost of the social!\n\nThe Cici Brown Museum of Art is located in a natural habitat and has recently been landscaped with many native plants. The Tuscawilla Preserve is open to the public and features boardwalks and nature trails. You may want to arrive a bit early to enjoy this beautiful area. (Art featured below building, From left to right: Louis Comfort Tiffany; Natural Limestone Bridge at Arch Creek, Miami, 1920, Emmett John Fritz; Keys Shrimper, J. Ralph Wilcox; South Beach Street, Daytona)\n\nThe cost of the conference seems high.\n\nThis is a big factor for many folks and takes a bit to get over. But, think about how good and refreshed you feel just spending the day on a chapter field trip, or maybe after hearing an inspirational speaker at a meeting; and that is how you will feel after an entire weekend (or day). You get value for the event because you are learning from the best. You can off-set ½ of a daily fee by volunteering at the conference for ½ a day. Contact sadehab@aol.com for more information on this. Volunteer spaces are filling up quickly, so act soon!\n\nSo, is the Florida Native Plant Society Conference for me?\n\nThese Suncoast Members said \"Yes\" to the Conference in 2014\n\nand have returned year after year.\n\nThe answer is, “yes!” Now I look forward to this special weekend every May. I return to my Chapter with new enthusiasm, new knowledge, new friends, and new commitments and maybe a few new plants I didn’t know I “needed.” It is like a mini-vacation! And also feel good about knowing money goes back into the FNPS mission for Conservation, Preservation, and Restoration.\n\nSign up today and see if you don’t feel the same way! Oh. And by the way… I am still no expert, but I am a life-long learner!\n\nThe conference offers you a great rate to stay at the Daytona Beach Resort and Conference Center, so you can consider\n\nyour time there like a \"mini-vacation.\"\n\n↧\n\nRain gardens for Florida\n\nFlorida's 5-month wet season produces\n\n50% to 70% of annual rainfall. (Data from NOAA)\n\nby Ginny Stibolt\n\nToo much rain or not enough\n\nFlorida's 5-month wet season (aka hurricane season), from June through October, accounts for almost 2/3 of our rainfall. In general, the more southern counties experience the more dramatic differences between their wet and dry seasons. In contrast, New York City's rainfall is more evenly distributed from about 3.5\" to 4.5\" each month.\n\nOur weird patterns of rainfall help make the case for using Florida's native plants in our landscapes. Also we receive huge amounts of rain all at once on a regular basis. In most cases, all that excess water is rushed from our properties out to the streets where our stormwater then ends up in the nearest waterway. At that point it's no longer just water, but it will have collected pollutants from our landscapes and the streets. This is called nonpoint source pollution, which is not regulated and not monitored.\n\nNonpoint source pollution (NPS)\n\nIn addition to rainfall, over-irrigation is a common cause of NPS in Florida.\n\nRainbows of pollution headed toward the nearest\n\nbody of water.\n\nSome people think that NPS is the most significant cause of water quality deterioration because it cannot be monitored effectively. This may be true, but I think that we can make a difference by sequestering as much rain water as possible through the use of rain barrels, cisterns, and rain gardens. We can reach out to others to help them do the same.\n\nThe EPA webpages on NPS include definitions, solutions, success stories, outreach tools, information about grants, and events. One of the solutions that homeowners and communities can implement is rain gardens.\n\nRain gardens\n\nThe downspout delivered water to the lawn, which became\n\na muddy, soggy mess throughout the wet season.\n\nBecause of Florida's long dry season, the selection of plants that can withstand both flooding and drought are quite limited. For instance, suggested rain garden plants for the Mid-Atlantic states and northward, often include the cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis), but it won't work for Florida's rain gardens, even though it's native down through Central Florida, because it is not drought-tolerant.\n\nRain gardens can be small like this downspout garden, which was expanded over a few years. First, I took out a few feet of lawn and created a small dry well by digging an 18\" cube under where the tray dumps the water and filling it with coarse gravel topped in with some fake river rock I planted some blue eyed grass, soft rush, and some ferns in the area. A couple of years later I expanded it by digging a good sized swale beyond the original dry well and overflow drainage through a French drain to a larger dry well near our front pond.. You can see details of this effort in this series of posts.\n\nAfter a couple of expansions, this downspout rain gardens\n\ncan handle any amount of rain.\n\nRain gardens can be large community projects which are designed to absorb all the runoff from parking lots or roads. The Lasalle Bioswale Project in Jacksonville is a good example of how various members of the community came together to build a highly visible rain garden to handle the stormwater runoff beautifully.\n\nA likely spot for some rain garden plants to better absorb the parking lot runoff. At this point the lawn maintenance is skinning the roots of the trees, but groupings of good rain garden plants such as rushes, sedges, shrubs would do a better job of absorbing the water.\n\nWhite-topped sedge (Rhynchospora colorata) is a beautiful addition to rain gardens.\n\nThe 2016 FNPS conference\n\nThe 2016 FNPS conference will be in Daytona Beach.\n\nI will be giving a presentation on rain gardens at the FNPS conference in Daytona Beach on Saturday May 21. I will provide details on siting and sizing rain gardens, a plant list for Florida rain gardens, and ideas for community rain garden projects.\n\nAfter my talk I'll walk through the native plant vendors to talk in more detail about good rain garden plants and rain garden designs.\n\nIn addition, University Press of Florida will be a vendor for the conference and I'll be signing books during the lunch breaks on Friday and Saturday. I've dedicated whole chapters to rain gardens and rain barrels in \"Sustainable Gardening for Florida,\" which include even more details and ideas for sequestering rain water on your property.\n\nWe all live in a watershed!\n\nGinny Stibolt\n\n↧\n\nCENTRAL FLORIDA NATIVE AND WILDLIFE FRIENDLY YARDS TOUR\n\nProduced and Submitted by Mark Kateli, Tarflower Chapter\n\nThis was yet another great year with the \"sister society\" collaboration for the Central Florida Native and Wildlife Friendly Yards Tour.\n\nFlorida Native Plant Society Tarflower and Cuplet Fern chapters, and the Orange Audubon Society,\n\nhost this event annually. It's a great exercise to help strengthen our bond around a common mission. This year, we had well over 100 attendees.\n\nA special thanks to noted environmental journalist Kevin Spear that published an article in the Orlando Sentinel that promulgated the event to people outside our usual sphere of influence.\n\nBeing Tarflower chapter Treasurer, I firmly believe that as we prosper, so will our neighboring chapters.\n\nI look forward to hearing from chapters that border Orange County- Lake, Osceola, Brevard, Volusia, and Polk chapter Treasurers- for more collaborative ideas that amplify attention to Central Florida and it's unique native plants.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWhere Have All the Pygmy Pipes Gone?\n\nBy Carmel van Hoek\n\nI haven’t heard any mention of pygmy pipes in quite a while, and the last collections, according to the USF Plant Atlas, were made in 2012 in Pasco and St. Johns Counties. I wonder if these little endemic, state endangered obscurities are taking another sabbatical as they have sometimes done since the late 1800’s when they were first discovered.\n\nPhotograph by Betty Wargo. Courtesy of The Atlas of Florida Plants\n\nPhotograph by Rita Lassiter\n\n. Courtesy of The Atlas of Florida Plants\n\nIn December of 1884, in east Florida near St. Augustine, Mary C. Reynolds found several small plants that obviously lacked chlorophyll as they displayed no hint of green. They looked somewhat like Indian Pipes, Monotropa uniflora, except that these plants were smaller, some barely visible above the leaf litter. And they were suffused with colors of pink and pale lavender instead of being ghostly white. Instead of a single flower atop the stem as in Indian Pipes, these stems held a cluster of flowers.\n\nPhoto by Rita Lassiter\n\nCourtesy of The Atlas of Florida Plants\n\nMary made a collection of the different-looking species and had them seen by Dr. Asa Gray, a well-known botanist of that period. Dr. Gray recognized the plants as a new species thought to be related to other achlorophyllous herbs of Ericaceae or Heath Family. His description of the species was subsequently published as Monotropsis reynoldsiae, named in honor of the collector. This first ever collected specimen of pygmy pipes is vouchered at the Smithsonian Institute and can be viewed online.\n\nI assume that as the Florida weather began to warm from winter into late spring Mary Reynolds’ little plants gradually disappeared, never to be seen again...Until December of 1977, that is, 93 years later!\n\nBotanist Rita Lassiter was the first one to rediscover pigmy pipes in a hardwood hammock in Hernando County, and it created quite a stir in botanical circles. Frequent sightings were reported during the winters of 1977-79, all in Hernando County, and several collections were made for further study of the fungus on which the plant feeds as well as of the plant itself. Gradually the range of Pygmy pipes has spread as collections have since been made in Pasco, Marion, Volusia and St. Johns Counties.\n\nPhoto by John Kunzer\n\nCourtesy of The Atlas of Florida Plants\n\nMonotropsis reynoldsiae is found usually in rich woods of oak hammocks and flowering dogwoods. They have been found as early in the year as November until late February. Its stems can be 1.5 to almost 5” long, and some of their length can be buried in leaf litter. A thick cluster of flowers, pale pink and white-mottled, top the stem, nodding bell-like at first and later straightening in age. Be looking for them until spring.\n\nFor more information on Montoropsis reymoldsiae, visit the species page on the USF Atlas of Florida Plants.\n\nCarmel van Hoek is a member of the Suncoast Chapter of the Florida Native Plant Society and recipient of the the FNPS Mentor Award in 2015.\n\n~~~\n\nPosted by Donna Bollenbach\n\n↧\n\nBiocontrol: A Success Story!\n\nMexican Petunia is a Category 1 invasive species in Florida.\n\nby Megan Weeks, Cuplet Fern Chapter of FNPS\n\nFlorida’s biodiversity is made remarkable by the plants and animals that depend on one another for survival. This delicate yet imperative relationship maintains a healthy natural environment, where the population of plants and animals are balanced. When new species are introduced, natives can be outsourced and the natural balance risks being disrupted[1]. Biocontrol is one method to help restore a balanced environment.\n\nExotic species have been introduced to Florida both accidentally and intentionally. Most threatening to the natural balance are plants from tropical and sub-tropical regions which are suited to Florida climate and often “take root” in this foreign land[1]. These non-native species do not serve as a significant food source for Florida organisms and are able to outcompete native plants for resources[1]. When an exotic species that is not affected by predators or pathogens becomes established, then the population will grow uninhibited and can potentially become invasive. Approximately one-third of vegetation found in Florida’s natural lands is exotic, and roughly 11% of those species are considered invasive[2].\n\nThe air potato beetle is released into an area overrun\n\nby the invasive vine .\n\nBiologists have long struggled to prevent the exotic populations from encroaching on endemic habitats. Manual methods, such as applying chemicals, hand pulling and burning, may help tame invasive populations but are often not a reliable long term solution[3]. As an alternative, scientists spend years researching predators (insects, pathogens, and fish) to target specific invasive species in a method called Biocontrol. This method relies on the predator to consume or destroy the exotic species, restoring ecological balance[1].\n\nAir Potato Beetle. Photo by Mary Keim\n\nIn 1905 Dioscorea bulbifera, the air potato, was introduced to Florida and with no natural predators the exotic vine quickly became a threat to native plants[2]. The infamy of this invasive species grew almost as rapidly as the plant itself and is a major concern for the Department of Agriculture[2]. A biocontrol program was launched to find a predator that would consume or destroy the air potato. Scientists returned to Asia where D. bulbifera is endemic and found a small beetle that could survive by eating the invasive plant[4]. Extensive research was performed to ensure that the beetle would not further disrupt the ecological balance.\n\nIn 2012 the air potato leaf beetle was finally released to feast on the air potato. Scientists note that the beetle mostly consumes the soft tissues found on the leaves and growing tips which creates difficult growing circumstances and can hinder the plant’s biological processes[5]. Every year between May and October, during peak air potato growth, new batches of the beetle are released[1].\n\nLarva of the Air Potato Leaf Beetle eating air potato leaves.\n\nPhoto by Donna Bollenbach\n\nThe air potato leaf beetle is very selective in its diet and only consumes D. bulbifera even excluding all other species of Dioscorea[3]. Research done by the University of Florida has found that beetle establishment in release sites has led to “reduced height of vines, decreased bulbil production, and most importantly, an increase in native vegetation”[3].\n\nSeminole county is one of the release sites for this remarkable and successful form of biocontrol. Through this biocontrol program, professionals were able to contribute to the restoration of Florida’s ecological balance. The air potato leaf beetle is an investment for our future and a vital part of the preservation and conservation of our natural lands.

Cayo Costa is a barrier island off the coast of southwest Florida, an hour by ferry from the hamlet of Bokeelia, accessible only by boat. It is a state park, one of 161 in our great state, and this one has camping, cabins for rent, miles of empty beaches, hiking trails, plenty of wildlife and native vegetation but no electricity, hot dog stands or hot water.\n\nThis is one place where you don’t want to forget anything.\n\nDonna Bollenbach\n\nTo get there, several concessions offer daily round-trip transport for around $45, camping gear included. We took the Tropic Star ferry, which takes you past Little Bokeelia Island (population, two caretakers). It was previously owned by Charles Burgess, of the dry-cell battery fame (Burgess Battery Company eventually became part of Duracell), though it recently sold to the highest bidder for $14.5 million.\n\nOnce on Cayo Costa we were greeted by a lovely New Hampshire couple who weren’t sure if they had discovered paradise or purgatory. They had started a six-week campground host position in March, and the spring weather quickly descended into summer, bringing with it the trifecta of heat, humidity and human blood-suckers.\n\nThe couple operated the shuttle, ferrying camping equipment, coolers, air mattresses, umbrellas, lanterns, and everything essential to surviving — and then some. While some go to Cayo Costa to hunt shells, escape the city or run away from life for a while, our group came to see the native habitat.\n\nI had been to Cayo Costa 20 years earlier and encountered the removal of the Australian pines that were dominating the island at that time. Although they provided terrific shade, they were an exotic species that crowded native plants, taking over.\n\nDonna Bollenbach\n\nIt was thrilling to see the transformation of native trees, such as the gumbo limbo and sea grape, growing to 30 feet tall and shading campsites that used to be surrounded by Australian pines. Some massive stumps still remain as stark reminders of their past reign, like footprints from a past empire.\n\nDonna Bollenbach\n\nThe exposed west coast is windswept and sparsely populated by sea oats and railroad vine, but as you travel inland, you encounter dense growths of cocoplum, myrsine, wild coffee, wax myrtles, cabbage palms and necklace pods, all growing on the remains of old sand dunes. You can see areas where the waves washed over land in storms, depositing their salt in shallow areas.\n\nDonna Bollenbach\n\nThe prickly pear cacti were in full bloom with their bright yellow blooms covered with beetles seeking pollen. Coral bean were triangular spikes of tubular red blossoms, resembling Asian structures. Moving further east you enter a pinewoods forest with slash pines, oaks and the healthiest poison ivy I have ever encountered. If I were to live on the island, this is where you would find me.\n\nDevon Higginbotham\n\nThe island was inhabited long before it became a park. Approximately 20 fishing families lived on Cayo Costa in the early 1900s, where they established a school, post office and grocery store.

Four Places to Visit North of Daytona Beach\n\nSubmitted by Donna Bollenbach\n\nIf you are like me, if you are travelling to Daytona Beach for the FNPS Conference, you may plan to stay a few extra days, or make a few stops on the way there or home. Here are a few parks and preserves, a short distance North of Daytona Beach that you may want to check out. Click on the name of the park for more information and fees.\n\nTomoka State Park\n\n8 Miles N\n\nSunset over the Tomoka River. Photo by Donna Bollenbach\n\nTomoka State Park is only 8 miles north of the Daytona Beach Resort. The 900-acre peninsula offers several short hiking trails, including a mile long paved multi-use trail and a one and a half mile interpretive trail that winds its way through a hardwood hammock.\n\nLegend of Tomokie monument\n\nPhoto by Donna Bollenbach\n\nWhen we camped there one winter, my husband and I really enjoyed exploring the park's lagoons and rivers, and spending evenings watching the sun go down over the river.\n\nA short walk takes you to a legendary 45 foot high concrete monument. It was made in 1955 by sculptor Frederick Dana Marsh who called it the “Legend of Tomokie.”\n\nAccording to the park website \"the legend has Chief Tomokie taking a “golden cup” and using it to commit the forbidden act of drinking from a sacred spring. as once inhabited by Timucuan Indians. According to the legend this particular spring water had fountain-of-youth-like powers but actually Tomokie had doomed himself and his tribe. Use of the sacred water and theft of the cup was avenged by other natives and specifically by the female warrior Oleeta (center), who in turn was slain by Chief Tomokie’s warriors.\"\n\nBulow Creek State Park\n\n12 miles N\n\nBulow Creek protects nearly 5,600 acres, more than 1,500 of which are submerged lands. The highlight of Bulow Creek is one of the largest remaining stands of southern live oak forest along Florida's east coast. The reigning tree is the Fairchild Oak, one of the largest live oak trees in the South.\n\nThe Majestic Fairchild Oak. Photo by Donna Bollenbach\n\nAs the park website describes it: \"For more than 400 years, the Fairchild Oak has been a silent witness to human activities along Bulow Creek, including the destruction of the neighboring Bulow Plantation during the Second Seminole War in 1836.\"\n\nVisitors can picnic in a shady pavilion or at a table on the lawn within view of the Fairchild Oak.\"\n\nor hike the seven mile Bulow Woods Trail to the Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park.\n\n17 miles N\n\nWhile camping at Tomoka State park, I discovered this piece of paradise on the fringe of Flagler Beach, a breath of fresh in a busy beach community. If I were to recommend one place to visit off the beaten path in this part of Florida, this would be it.\n\nTwilight at Betty Steflik Memorial Preserve by Donna Bollenbach\n\nBetty Steflik Memorial Preserve protects more than 200 acres of mangrove marsh, mudflats, and coastal uplands. Opened in 1995, the preserve was named in honor of Betty Steflik, a Flagler Beach City Commissioner who dedicated the last 25 years of her life to preserving Flagler County’s fragile coastline and wetlands.\n\nThe preserve has an extensive network of boardwalks that curve through estuarine creeks and out to the Intracoastal Waterway, offering panoramic views and excellent wildlife viewing. A descent off the boardwalk envelopes you in a sun dappled loop trail through a maritime hammock and a coastal scrub.\n\nIntracoastal from boardwalk by Donna Bollenbach\n\nIt offers everything a naturalist would desire: bird watching, pristine coastal plant communities, stunning landscapes and wildlife views.\n\nOpen from dawn until 11:00 pm, the preserve is located in Flagler Beach and lies along the eastern side of the Intracoastal Waterway south of State Road 100.\n\nWashington Oaks Gardens State Park\n\n30 Miles N\n\nPlaced between the Atlantic Ocean and the Matanzas River, this property was once owned by a distant relative of President George Washington. The gardens were established by Louise and Owen Young who purchased the land in 1936 and built a winter retirement home. They named it Washington Oaks and, in 1965, donated most of the property to the State. The gardens make remarkable use of native and exotic species, from azaleas and camellias to the exquisite bird of paradise, sheltered within a picturesque oak hammock.\n\nThe roses come in all colors at the formal gardens.\n\nPhoto by Donna Bollenbach\n\nAlthough the formal gardens are the centerpiece of this park, Washington Oaks is also famous for the unique shoreline of coquina rock formations that line its Atlantic beach. A number of short trails provide opportunities for hiking and bicycling.\n\nIf you are travelling north along the east coast, this would be a good stop for a picnic lunch.\n\nCoquina rock formations at Washington Oaks.

At the time I was drawn to the blooms alone (not realizing the many benefits this one plant would soon provide). It was not long before the female Monarch butterfly flew in to lay her eggs on the Milkweed. Suddenly, my entire outlook on gardening changed.\n\nIf this one plant could bring in so much life, imagine what would happen if more native plants were added. I began by incorporating butterfly larval host plants and adult butterfly nectar plants. Implementing both host and nectar sources allows the butterflies to complete their entire lifecycle in my small urban garden.\n\n(Top left to right: Black Swallowtail on Cirsium horridulum, White Peacock on Bidens alba, Horace's Duskywing on Callicarpa americana, Cassius Blue on Heliotropium angiospermum)\n\nA good starting point was planting the larger shrubs first: Walter’s Viburnum (Viburnum obovatum), Simpson’s Stopper (Myrcianthes fragrans), Privet Senna (Senna ligustrina), and Firebush (Hamelia patens). These shrubs provide food for birds, nectar for ollinators and shelter for all kinds of wildlife. I also added Wild Lime (Zanthoxylum fagara), the host plant for our largest butterfly, the Giant Swallowtail, and for several species of Sulphur butterflies.\n\nEastern black swallowtail, Papilio polyxenes asterius\n\nUnderneath the shrubs I planted Corkystem Passionflower Vine (Passiflora suberosa), which attracts Zebra Longwings and Gulf Fritillaries. Maypop (Passiflora incarnata) is also a great host for both of these butterflies and has fragrant, showy flowers.\n\n(Top left to right: Queen on Conoclinium coelestinum, Horace's Duskywing on Gaillardia pulchella, Cassius Blue on Salvia coccinea, Fiery skipper on Heliotropium angiospermum)\n\nFor ground cover, I planted Frogfruit (Phyla nodiflora). Frogfruit is the host plant for the White Peacock, Phaon Crescent as well as the Common Buckeye. Sunshine Mimosa (Mimosa strigillosa) is another wonderful ground cover that attracts the Little Sulphur butterfly.\n\nCollage of Native Wildflowers\n\nWildflowers are interspersed throughout the garden to provide nectar. Some of these include Indian Blanketflower (Gaillardia pulchella), Blue Mistflower (Conoclinium coelestinum), Spotted Beebalm (Monarda punctata), Seaside Goldenrod (Sempervirens solidago) and Scorpion Tail (Heliotropium angiospermum).\n\nQueen butterfly (Danaus gilippus)\n\nThe next reasonable step was to certify my yard as a wildlife habitat and a safe haven for Monarchs and other butterflies. This can be done by providing food (seeds and berries from native plants), water (small pond or even a birdbath works) and shelter while using sustainable garden practices such as no fertilizers or pesticides.\n\nRyan's Yard is a Certified Wildlife Habitat and a Waystation for Monarchs\n\nButterfly gardening was just the beginning of my journey. As I continue to remove existing exotic plants and replace them with natives, I envision my native garden, full of insects, birds and other animals.\n\nGulf Fritillary Caterpillars and Passion Vine leaf\n\nRyan Inskeep is a member of the Serenoa Chapter of the Florida Native Plant Society. He believes that conserving our Florida starts in our own yards to attract butterflies, birds and other wildlife. He also enjoys sharing his knowledge and educating others about the importance of using native plants in our landscapes. Ryan currently writes about his native wildlife garden experiences at the Florida Native Plants Facebook group page.\n\nPosted by DBollenbach\n\n↧\n\nIt’s a Jungle Out There…and it smells like licorice!\n\nStory and Photos by Donna Bollenbach\n\nDespite the warnings of “DIFFICULT” and “YOU WILL GET WET”, my decision to go on the Mormon Branch/Ocala National Forest conference field trip in May, was based on two things:\n\nFirst, it was led by Scott Davis. I have been on a few adventures with Scott and have enjoyed every one of them. Even though I don’t think I am going to remember every plant and botanical detail Scott rattles off, I always go home knowing more than I thought I would. I think this is because Scott impresses upon the what's interesting and important.\n\nSecond, I wanted to see where the Large-leaf grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia grandiflora) blooms. Though I knew I would not see the flower because it is a fall bloomer, I still wanted to see the plant. I read that the presence of Parnassia, along with the Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), is an indicator of high plant diversity and rare species. In other words, it would be pristine habitat.\n\nPristine it was! So pristine that there were no trails. We worked out way down the slope to Mormon Creek through a forest of loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), laurel oaks (Quercus laurifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum). As we approached the bottom of the slope the passage became more difficult, but not unpleasant. There was thick understory of fragrant and fruitful evergreen shrubs. Fetterbush (Lyonia lucida), swamp azalea (rhododendron viscosum) pipestem (Agarista Populifolia), high bush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and the sweetest of all, the yellow anise (Illicium parviflorum), which filled the forest with the a sweet smell of licorice.\n\nTaller shrubs and small trees grew in mass near the edge of the creek. There we encountered Wax Myrtle (Myrica cerifera), Dahoon Holly (Ilex cassine), Needle Palm (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), and the occasional Florida Willow (Salix floridana). The vegetation was so dense there, we had to walk in the creek to continue our journey.\n\nThe soil in this area is mostly acidic peat, or commonly called “muck,” and muck was exactly what we found while navigating the creek. Occasionally someone’s leg would sink knee deep in the soft and muddy creek bottom, and they could only hope to still have their shoe on when finally pulled free of the sludge. Others stepped in deep holes, and were baptized in the Mormon Branch. But, we just pulled up our boots and marched on.\n\nMuck, or acidic peat is what defines this ecosystem. The Atlantic White Cedar, which has its southernmost strand in Mormon Branch, prefers to rest its roots in moist, peaty soil. A narrow band of these evergreens with ash gray to reddish brown, smooth to ridged bark, rise to nearly 60 - 80 feet tall not far from the creek bed. Underneath its canopy of feathery, needle-like leaves the vegetation is thin, due to the deep shade it creates. The canopy provides cover for birds and small mammals, while the forest glades under the trees provide passage for black bear, whitetail deer and other animals.\n\nThe large-leaved Grass-of-Parnassus also likes acidic soil and wet, shady habitats. We saw many of the plants along the stream bed in Mormon Branch. The oblong, nearly heart-shaped leaves are bright green and prominent. While we didn’t see the flowers because they bloom in the late fall, I read that they stand on stalks up to two feet above the leaves. The flower, white veined in olive green, with red capped pistils, is much admired.\n\nWhile Mormon Branch is an ecosystem in itself, I couldn’t help but notice the little ecosystems within the ecosystem. Each rock In the creek bed was home to a plethora of ferns and moss. The fallen logs give birth to even more plants, animals and fungus. The mossy bark of the live trees were alive in epiphytes, and bugs. The hardest part of the hike was not getting too distracted by the surroundings that you step into a hole or trip over a log, so I was thankful I brought my walking stick.\n\nScott and I navigating the creek..photo by S.Denton\n\nIn closing, I should mention that Scott and our young guides on this hike, were more than accommodating. They held branches out of the way as we passed, picked us up if we fell, led the way, and left no one behind.\n\nBecause of them, it wasn't just a fieldtrip...it was an adventure!\n\nDonna\n\n↧\n\nThe Saints of Hillsborough County: The Genus Hypericum\n\nSubmitted by Carmel vanHoek\n\nPhotos courtesy of the Florida Plant Atlas\n\nAll Saints\n\nOf the thirty-one species of the genus Hypericum that have been vouchered for the state of Florida according to the USF Plant Atlas, twelve may be found in Hillsborough County. The genus has been known world-wide since pre-Christian times for its healing properties and each people group has given it common names of their choosing. One of the beliefs of the Romans and Greeks was that the flowers were sent by the gods to provide a holy sacrifice to repel evil, the Greeks naming it Hupereicon and the Romans, Hypericum, meaning perhaps the plant had power over evil. A sacrificial ritual would take place annually during Summer Solstice, also known as Midsummer’s Day, the flowers being thrown on fires to appease the gods. With the advent of Christianity pagan rituals were incorporated with church-based festivals. Thus, because St. John’s birthday was near to Midsummer’s Day, the European species, Hypericum perforatum, which usually bloomed at this time, was given the common name of St. John’s-wort in his honor; “wort” meaning “plant”. As new species were discovered in the New World, other Hypericum species were also called St. John’s-wort of one adjective or another. St. Peter’s-wort and St. Andrew’s Cross were also named in honor of these respective saints.\n\nOur St. John’s-worts have so much in common that they are not easily identified as to species, but recognizing the genus Hypericum is almost half the battle. They all have leaves and branches that are placed on opposite sides of each other. Their leaves and green sepals and sometimes even their petals and stems are dotted with translucent sunken glands or colored dots. Their flowers are yellow to yellow-orange and they bloom from summer to fall, some as early as spring. Their fruit is a capsule with many small seeds. They are to be found growing mostly in wet or moist acid soils and a few in dry sandhills and coastal scrubs. Most are perennial evergreen shrubs and a few are annual or perennial herbs.\n\nFour Petals\n\nThree of our species have 4 petals instead of the usual 5; the petals are placed to look like the letter X. Hypericum hypericoides or St. Andrew’s Cross is the one shrub we most often see on field trips. It’s a bit funny that its name actually translates to mean a Hypericum that looks like a Hypericum. It’s a medium-sized shrub with many small, very leafy branches. With magnification one may see the 2 styles atop the developing fruit capsule. The styles connect the pollen on the stigmas to the ovary or seed pod. The flower has 2 large outer sepals and 2 very small inner sepals, with a pair of tiny bractlets just beneath the flower.\n\nHypericum crux-andreae, whose name seems to translate to St. Andrew’s Cross, is instead named St. Peter’s-wort. Like H. hypericoides it is a medium-sized shrub but has several differences. It has fewer branches making it look less dense; its leaves are a bit longer and broader, and it has usually 3 but sometimes 4 styles instead of 2. It is found in seasonally wet woods throughout our state but is more prevalent in north Florida and the Panhandle.\n\nOur third species of 4 petals is Hypericum tetrapetalum or Fourpetal St. John’s- wort. Its leaves are heart-shaped just like its 2 larger sepals. The 2 lobes of the leaves clasp the stem just as the large outer sepals clasp the developing fruit; the 2 inner sepals are narrower than the outer ones. This species also has 3 styles.\n\nFive Petals\n\nThe remainder of Hillsborough County Hypericum shrubs will have 5 petals, 5 sepals and 3 styles and can be divided by their leaf types. We have 3 species with needle-like leaves.\n\nHypericum fasciculatum, so called because its needle-like leaves appear to be in fascicles or bundles,\n\ncan be over 5 ft. tall. Sandweed, as it is commonly called, has midstem leaves 13 mm long or longer; it is often found surrounding the margins of ponds and swamps, and will sometimes develop prop roots if inundated for long periods.\n\nThe stem leaves of Hypericum brachyphylum are 11 mm. long, and its height is a bit shorter than H. fasciculatum. Its common name, Coastalplain St. John’s-wort tells me it can be found in dry as well as wet sites. “Brachy” means short and “phylum” means leaf.\n\nHypericum tenuifolium was previously named H. reductum. Its new name translates to slender\n\nleafed. It’s quite easy to identify because of its low height, less than knee-high, and its branches that often lie on the ground and take root.\n\nThree shrub species in our county with 5 petals have broad leaves.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't mention Hypericum galioides, Bedstraw St. John’s-wort. It is common in north Florida, but Hillsborough County has only one record of a specimen collected in 1843.\n\nHypericum cistifolium is striking for its combination of colors, bright yellow flowers and glossy, mahogany-brown capsules. It has simple stems with stiff, oblong leaves, each pair of leaves at right angles to the next pair, with the stems terminating into branched inflorescences. It grows in wet woods to about waist-high.\n\nHypericum myrtifolium is another beauty about waist-high, leaves with somewhat heart-shaped bases lightly clasping the stems, flower buds pink-tinged and petals that bend backwards to expose a large, rounded cluster of yellow to yellow-orange stamens. It can be found in wet woods and pond margins.\n\nThe remaining three Hypericum species in our county are herbaceous plants with 5 petals and sepals and 3 styles.\n\nHypericum mutilum, Dwarf St. John’s-wort, is a perennial not more than 10“ tall. Its sessile leaves\n\nare thin, about one inch long with rounded tips. The solitary stems branch at the apex into a leafy inflorescence. It grows in wet, sandy areas.\n\nHypericum gentianoides, Pineweed or Orange-Grass, is so called because its flowers are yellow-orange in color that gives the plant an orange aura. It’s about knee-high and can be found in pond margins as well as disturbed dry soil. Its scale-like leaves appressed closely to the stem gives the plant a wiry look. Its tiny flowers are on terminal branches.\n\nHypericum setosum is either an annual or biennial. Its common name is Hairy St. John’s-wort. I’ve\n\nnever seen it before but I may be able to recognize it in wet flatwoods or bogs for its mostly solitary stems, 1-3.5 ft. tall, and very hairy leaves growing straight up the stems. It’s more commonly found in northern counties but has been vouchered in Pasco and Hillsborough counties.\n\nDan Austin has a lot of information on the history of Hypericum in his book Florida Ethnobotany\n\nbook. Godfrey & Wooten’s Aquatic and Wetland Plants of Southeastern United States book has wonderful line drawings. The USF Plant Atlas has photographs, maps, and specimen photos with a lot of information on the plant labels as to where, when, how often and by whom they were found. Plant keys by Wunderlin & Hansen as well as Clewell help to determine arrangement of plant characteristics. And Walter Taylor has photos with descriptions in non-scientific language. Thankfully there are many avenues available for help in identifying our many beautiful and interesting native plants.\n\nAll images reprinted with permission from theAtlas of Florida Plants\n\n↧\n\nLICHENS – A TAPESTRY OF LIFE\n\nby Donna Bollenbach\n\nThe tiny moss has been the theme of many a gifted poet; and even the despised mushroom has called forth classic works in its praise. But the Lichens, which stain every rock, and clothe every tree, which form:\n\nNature’s livery o’er the globe\n\nWhere’er her wonders range\n\nHave been almost universally neglected, nay despised.\n\nLauder Lindsay\n\nChristmas Lichen on a fallen tree, Florida.\n\nPIONEERS\n\nImagine our continent after the last ice age: Glaciers cut deep gorges in the land and miles of granite boulders, silt and the bones cover the hills and plains of North America. Life has all but disappeared, but there is hope for new life in a simple living entity that is neither plant nor animal, the lichens.\n\nLichens on a rock in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nLichens, a partnership of a fungus and an alga, are able to survive in the most extreme temperatures. The lichens that partner with cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, produce their own nitrogen, so they are able to grow on nitrogen-poor substrates. They form colonies on the surface of the rocks and bare soil. The chemicals in these lichens are capable of penetrating and breaking down the rock. As the lichens die the debris becomes thicker and nitrogen rich. Mosses began to grow. The decay of the mosses and lichens make the soil even richer, allowing other vegetation to take hold and a new habitat evolves.\n\nFor this reason, lichens and mosses are considered pioneers of succession. Today, they are still the primary plant-like species of the deserts and tundra where they thrive in conditions that are inhospitable to most other plants. They are also an important source of food for animals in those extreme climates where other vegetation is scarce.\n\nFruiticose lichen in the Florida Scrub\n\nTAPESTRY\n\n– from the Greek word tapis for carpet; a fabric with a woven design resembling tapestry, varied entwined and intricate (i.e. the tapestry of life).\n\nLichen, a living organism that is neither plant nor animal, is one of nature’s true tapestries.A fungus and a suitable green alga or cyanobacteria (blue-green alga), intricately woven together in a symbiotic union, lichens carpet trees, rocks, soil and other substrates with their rich colors and textures.\n\nThere are over 14,000 species of lichen living in nearly every habitat in the world. In addition to rocks, lichen grows on an array of natural and manmade substrates, including bark, stone, wood, soil, leaves, moss, bone, human artifacts and even some living creatures. Unlike the pioneer lichens that break down rocks, lichens found on living substrates are not parasitic, they simply use the host as a place to live.\n\nFORM & BEAUTY\n\nYet lovely was its pleasant shade;\n\nLovely the trunk will moss inlaid;\n\nLovely the long-haired lichens grey;\n\nLovely its pride and its decay.\n\nMary Russell Mitford\n\nCrustose Lichen on a Palm Tree\n\nThe task of defining and classifying lichens is a daunting one for scientist. The international Association for Lichenology defines lichen as “an association of a fungus and photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure.” Noted Lichenologist, Trevor Goward, went further to describe lichen as “fungi that have discovered agriculture.”\n\nScientifically, lichens are classified by one of four general growth forms: Foliose (leafy, lobed and most often with an upper and lower cortex), Fruiticose (hairy, tubular, multi-branching strands or lacey balls with a single cortex), Crustose (crusty, flat patches that can be somewhat smooth or thick and bumpy) and Squamulose (an intermediate between the Crustose and Foliose, with thick, scaly shingles).\n\nA combination of lichen forms and mosses on tree bark.\n\nWhile these scientific terms do suggest the general shape of the lichen classes, they do little justice to the lichen’s true beauty.\n\nThe Foliose lichens have a leaf-like form. They have many lobes., often curling slightly inward and layered on top of each other.\n\nFoliose lichens on a tree.\n\nThe Fruticose lichens are highly branched. They can be thin and stringy, or round, lacy and soft in appearance. Some of the Fruticose lichens found in the scrub look like puffy greenish gray clouds.\n\nFruiticose lichens, or powder puff lichens in the Florida Scrub.\n\nThe Crustose lichens are flat, often circular patches, tightly adhered to their substrate. Colorful fruiting bodies adorn their cortex.\n\nCrustose, or flame lichen growing on a rock.\n\nWhile many lichens are white to greenish-grey to brown, many are bright red, yellow or orange. Even a green or gray lichen may be adorned with a bright red fruiting body. Some of the fruiting bodies are mere dots, while others are more like little mushrooms. The combination of color and texture in lichens are as varied as the substrates they live on, and have given many a painter or photographer a reason to pause and admire nature's finest fabric.\n\nFoliose lichen (British soldiers) with an Earth Star (fungus) in the center.\n\nAnd these are all the reasons I Love Lichens!\n\nDonna Bollenbach\n\nIf you also love Lichens, check out this great book: \"Lichens of North America\" by Brodo, Sharnoff & Sharnoff.

It looks like no other flower shape — daisy, tulip or rose.\n\nNot only is it spectacular to behold but it’s huge, measuring about 4 inches across, and it smells like a sorority house on formal night.\n\nI had to have one!\n\nSometimes called the maypop or May apple, this perennial vine is native to Florida and the southeastern United States. It grows well in zones seven to 10, climbing on fences trellises or as a ground cover in sunny locations. It spreads underground, sending out shoots some distance from the parent plant. It is attractive to zebra longwing and gulf fritillary larvae, which keep it in check. Thus, supplying your garden with a steady stream of butterflies.\n\nGulf fritillary caterpillar_D Higginbotham\n\nJust when you think you’ve found the perfect garden plant, one of your flowers will go to seed, yielding a 2- to 3-inch passion fruit, which taste much like a crunchy kiwi when ripe.\n\nFor those of you living in dry areas, coastal beaches or dune communities, the passion vine will prosper along with your sea oats, saw palmettos and seaside goldenrod. Mine sprawls across a picket fence, gets watered when it rains and is not particularly fond of being over-watered.\n\nThe passion vines have special glands that produce nectar at the base of the leaves which attract ants. The ants roam all over the plants and carry away butterfly eggs or young caterpillars they find. But with a few gulf fritillaries flitting about laying eggs, the butterflies keep up a steady supply of larvae, and some manage to elude the ants to grow to maturity.\n\nCross, nails & crown of thorns?_D Bollenbach\n\nThere is much speculation as to why Carl Linnaeus, the renowned Swedish botanist, named it Passiflora incarnata some 250 years ago. Incarnata means flesh colored. There is nothing flesh colored about the passion vine. One theory is the significance of the flower pattern to God. In 1610, Jacoma Bosio, an Italian monastic scholar, heard reports of a wonderful flower in Mexico. The design of was said to have been created by God as a sign the native people of Mexico should convert to Christianity.\n\nThe theory was the three stigmas represent the three nails used on the cross, the five anthers count the wounds in Jesus, the corona of the flower recalls the crown of thorns, the ten petals equal the disciples (minus Paul and Judas) and the whip-like tendrils represent the whips used on Jesus, thus, the “Passion of Christ.”\n\nWhatever your theory on Linnaeus’ mindset so long ago, the passion vine is a plant any Florida gardener would be passionate about.\n\nRead Devon's entire article published in the Plant City Observer here.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nTen Ways of Looking at a Passionflower\n\nBY DONNA BOLLENBACH\n\nI\n\nAmong a thousand bees,\n\nThe only fragrance they desire\n\nIs the passionflower's.\n\nII\n\nI was of three hearts,\n\nLike a vine,\n\nIn which there are three passion flowers.\n\nIII\n\nThe scent of the passion flower fills the meadow.\n\nThe bees and butterflies dance together.\n\nIV\n\nA bee and a butterfly\n\nAre one,\n\nA bee and a butterfly and a passion flower\n\nAre one.\n\nV\n\nI do not know which I prefer\n\nThe complexity of the flower\n\nOr the complexity of the vine\n\nThe passion flower in bloom\n\nOr the fruit left behind.\n\nVI\n\nThe butterfly lays its eggs,\n\nIn the shadow of the passionflower\n\nThe caterpillar cuts swaths\n\nThrough the leaves,\n\nIt is sacrificial love.\n\nVII\n\nAt the sight of a thousand passion flowers\n\nGrowing in the meadow,\n\nThe pauper and the king\n\nAre equal.\n\nVIII\n\nThe worker bees lie drunk\n\nIn the purple fringes of the passionflower\n\nWhile the queen paces the hive.\n\nIX\n\nThe passionflower spreads its vines,\n\nTracing many paths\n\nThrough the meadow.\n\nX\n\nThe bees are buzzing.\n\nThe passionflower must be blooming.\n\n↧\n\nMy Quest for Milkweeds\n\nStory and photos by Janet Bowers, Suncoast Chapter of the Florida Native Plant Society\n\nAt the beginning of my ‘Natives’ life, I learned a lot from working on the plant sale plant profiles, so I thought the only milkweeds in our area were Asclepias incarnata, A. tuberosa and A. perennis. Apparently those are the ones that nurseries have grown for a while. If I had known better, I might have checked out the USF Plant Atlas where I could have looked up genus Asclepias and would have seen that there are many more species in our area.\n\nButterflyweed,Asclepias tuberosa, Lake Blue Scrub\n\nI have seen 9 milkweed species so far this year in relative proximity to our area, and I have now done the USF Plant Atlas search so I know there are more out there. An advance search in Hillsborough County lists twelve species.Oddly enough (at least to me), two of the species I have never seen in the wild are the swamp milkweeds that we sell at our plant sale. They are at the top of my list to find.\n\nCurtiss' milkweed, Asclepias curtissii, Lake Blue Scrub\n\nThe most recent milkweeds I saw were at Lake Blue Scrub (Auburndale) in early July. There I added A. curtissii to my list and saw some reddish A. tuberosas that were gorgeous. I was thrilled to find A. lanceolata at Hillsborough River State Park recently. I had seen it before but not in our county, so it seemed like a big deal to me but of course other people were well aware that they grew there.\n\nFewflower Milkweed, Asclepias lanceolata, Hillsborough River State Park\n\nMy favorite milkweed, A. longifolia, I first saw in the Green Swamp, and I got to revisit it on our way home from Cayo Costa in April. We stopped to see a mass of bladderworts and Devon saw the milkweed. I was tired, dirty and cranky, but that milkweed made me very happy. I have noticed that some of the paler milkweeds are easy to miss if you’re not looking closely. The others I have seen this year include - A. humistrata that has the gorgeous pink veined leaves, A. pedicellata , A. feayi (quite a few on our May fieldtrip to Triple Creek Preserve), A. verticillata and A. amplexicaulis (in Hernando county). Last year I saw A. tomentosa.\n\nSavannah Milkweed, Asclepias pedicellata, Blackwater Creek Preserve\n\nI used to feel bad when we told people to buy native milkweed and they couldn’t find any, but now they are becoming more available. I noticed that both Green Isles and Sweetbay nurseries now have whorled milkweed on their list of plants, so now there are more kinds of milkweed for sale.\n\nSwamp Milkweed, Asclepias incarnata, Sweetbay Nursery\n\nFNPS member and St Mark’s NWR ranger, Scott Davis, is executing his plan to support monarchs by sourcing local ecotypes of milkweeds for the Big Bend area. A year ago FANN (Florida Association of Native Nurseries) launched Phase I of the Florida Milkweed Project, an effort to expand the production and use of native Asclepias species with funding and support from the Florida Wildflower Foundation and our state wildflower license plate. I can tell you from personal experience that I have seen a big difference in the availability and quality of these milkweeds for sale in the past 5 years or so, and look forward to more availability.\n\nIf you can’t get out to see the wild milkweeds, plant some in your yard and watch the Monarch Butterflies come to you!\n\n↧\n\nCarol's Corner\n\nby Carol Hebert, Conradina Chapter of the Florida Native Plant Society\n\nThe following is a collection of Carol's Corner from the first half of 2016 reprinted in part from the Conradina chapter newsletter.

Simpson Stopper (Myrcianthes fragrans) is categorized as a small tree. I guess you can recognize why the species name is fragrance in Latin. It grows slowly with very little need to prune. I enjoy seeing it used as hedges for commercial businesses. We even have it as a hedge in front of my work place at Dr. Martin Luther King Library on University Boulevard. I loved making my co-workers smell the flowers. It grows on the mainland and beach-side also. Plant native! C\n\nLupine (Lupinus diffusus) Photo by Carol Hebert\n\nApril 2016\n\nCarol’s Corner: Lupine in Bloom!\n\nWe had an enjoyable walk at Turkey Creek Sanctuary, and we saw wonderful plants. There was Conradina grandiflora in bloom—the plant our chapter is named after. Blueberry (Vaccinun myrsintes) and Deerberry (Vaccinum stamineum) were also wonderfully in bloom. We took a walk on a boardwalk done by a Scout recently to see huge Giant Leather Ferns. Toward the end of our walk, we enjoyed the sight of many bunches of Lupine (Lupinus diffusus). They were drop dead beautiful! Plant native! C\n\nShiny Lyonia (Lyonia lucida) Photo by Carol Hebert\n\nMarch 2016\n\nCarol’s Corner: Spring Has Arrived!\n\nWe enjoyed a wonderful walk through Cruikshank Sanctuary in February with Vince Lamb and saw Shiny Lyonia (Lyonia lucida) in bloom. It is a beautiful shrub that likes full sun. Rusty Staggerbush (Lyonia ferruginea) was also in bloom. We enjoyed about six to seven Scrub Jays. It was a fun walk through sandy soil and the best season to enjoy the scrub. I personally also enjoyed Adam's Needle (Yucca filamentosa) with fiber swirling out from its leaves. Scrub is an enchanting habitat and is wonderful to walk through to see its vast diversity. Plant native! C\n\nAcer rubrum(Red Maple) Photo by Carol Hebert\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nCarol’s Corner: Autumn Colors\n\nFall is almost over and there are still a few autumn colors there to enjoy. Red Maple (Acer rebrum) is showing its display of how wonderfully its leaves change color and contribute to the soil. There are several other leaves changing color and falling such as the deep red of Virginia Creeper and the yellow leaves of the Grape vines (Vitus sp.) and the American Elm (Ulmus americana). I have already seen the Laurel Oaks showering their leaves! This is the best time to leave all those leaves in your yard to enrich the soil. Since Melbourne is about four inches above the average rain fall, spring is on it's way. Plant native! C\n\nPhoto Skyblue Clustervine by Carol Herbert\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nCarol’s Corner: Winter Blooms\n\nDecember 21st was Winter Solstice and the beginning of the winter season. It’s almost hard to believe we are in this season since we have hit (or close to) a record high temperature on each day. Plants are wonderful how they bloom in different seasons. Fall brings us so many colors such as yellow with Goldenrod (Solidaga sp.), Coreopsis, and Silkgrass (Pityopsis graminifolia). A nice variety of purple blooms contrast beautifully such as Gayfeather (Liatris sp.), Ironweed (Vernonica gigantea), and Stokes’ Aster (Stokesia laevis). Currently, my favorite fall blooming purple flower plant is Skyblue Clustervine (Jacquemontia pentanthos). This vine grows nicely on the north side of my house so it receives partial sun and shade all day. The flowers are small, about an inch wide and have the “morning glory” look. No fragrance but they are so pretty to see everyday because they open just for a day so flowers are in different places on the vine each day. Find a fence or trellis and decorate it with this evergreen vine named Skyblue Clustervine. This plant will give a wonderful display of lavender flowers at the end of each year. Plant native!

Surf temp was a warm 78 degrees. There were Least Terns on the beach.\n\nTom Hoctor. Photo by Vince Lamb\n\nDr. Tom Hoctor, Director of the University of Florida Center for Landscape Conservation Planning, updated us on the status of the Florida Wildlife Corridors and habitat preservation.\n\nWith the loss in oversight of growth management at the state level, we need to step in with science to help local governments understand the impact of decisions in new building projects and sprawl. He quoted Frank Egler: Ecosystems not only are more complex than we think, but more complex than we can think.\n\nPanthers need a population of 240 individuals to be delisted by the Federal Government as an endangered species. The Florida Black Bear was delisted four years ago but it still needs corridors for connectivity and exchange of genetic information for healthy offspring. They have an expanding population, but a shrinking habitat. The Panther would do well in the Florida Panhandle, but females’ offspring stay in the home range of their mothers, so it would take many generations to expand there on their own.\n\nSee the Conservation Trust for Florida, Inc. for more on protection and connecting Florida’s wild and working landscapes.\n\nTim Rumage of spaceshipearth.orgsupports E.

With our 20 million population and 100 million tourists each year, he still has hope for the female panther offspring moving themselves (eventually) into rich habitat in the panhandle. He told us of work with Lykes Brothers at Fish Eating Creek to provide a crucial 355,000 protected acres (plus a buffer of 68,000) for movement up a narrow corridor (through Lykes) to a traditional panther Caloosahatchee River crossing. His equation for panther survival in Florida is 4 million acres. With the 2.25 million that is the Everglades, Big Cypress, Panther Conservation core and the 1.75 million acres (on 90 individual properties) between Lykes and Disney Wilderness Area, he believes we have what they need.

Journal Drawings by Marjorie Shropshire\n\nThere is no better way to connect with nature than by keeping a nature journal: a collection of observations, interpretations and feelings that describe or illustrate your personal view of the natural world.Nature journals are most commonly in the form of writing, drawing or photographs, or a combination of these. Nature Journaling is rewarding for both children and adults. It is a great a learning tool, as well as a way to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of nature by recording and sharing memories.\n\nWhat is a Nature Journal?\n\nMarjorie Shropshire, 2012\n\nA Nature Journal is a personal record, but it is not a diary. A diary is generally about you and your relationships to other people, while a Nature Journal is about your relationship to the natural world-animals, plants, seasons and climates.\n\nWhile you may not want anyone to read your diary, many people enjoy sharing their nature journals with others. Most group members find it fun and educational to read each other’s interpretations of what they saw, especially when studying the same subject. It is amazing to see the different perspectives people have on a single flower, insect or bird!\n\nThe tools to keep a Nature Journal are as simple as paper and pencil. While most journals include both writing and drawings, some people prefer to do more of one than the other. If drawing is to be a large part of your recordings, you will want to use unlined paper, such as a sketchbook, and drawing pencils. If you will be writing more than drawing, than a comfortable pen and a lined composition book or loose-leaf binder may be all you need. Whichever you chose it should be compact enough to carry easily and have a sturdy, weather resistant cover. Children could be allowed to make their own journal books with a handful of paper bound between two pieces of white cardboard that they decorate themselves.\n\nOrganizing Your Journal\n\nfrom the journals of Marjorie Shropshire\n\nWhile the content of your journal is a personal choice, it is helpful to state a purpose for your journal, and to keep your entries organized by date. The purpose of your journal may be as broad as “recording my observations of nature while kayaking in the swamp,” or as focused as “observing native plants that grow in my yard,” but each journal entry should start with a quick note of the following:\n\ntime of day\n\ndate\n\ntemperature (cold/hot/warm)\n\nweather (windy/calm/rainy).\n\nYou will find those details very useful when interpreting your observations later.\n\nStarting Your Journal\n\n“But I can’t draw…or write.” These are the most common obstacles to overcome when starting a nature journal. If you draw a line and a circle, you have the ability to do simple sketches of plants and animals. By making written notations next to your drawings, you will develop a complete picture of what you observed. With practice, both your drawing and writing will improve. Here is a suggestion to get you started:\n\nLearning to observe…the purpose of this lesson is to learn to focus on details while not losing sight of the whole and its relationship to its surroundings.\n\nVisit the edge of a river, stream or pond. Find an interesting plant or flower, and a dry, comfortable spot to sit while you study it. Begin by making a simple sketch of one of its leaves. Is the leaf is long and skinny? Heart-shaped? Or mostly round or oval? Are the edges smooth or toothed? Sketch the basic shape and make written notes next to the drawing. After focusing on the leaf for a while, turn your focus to the whole plant. Note how the leaves are arranged on the stem. If it has a flower, focus on it with all your senses: What color is it? Describe its shape. How does it make you feel? Does it have a scent that reminds you of something else? Record your observations and feelings freely. Draw the flower if you wish. Next, move your focus out even further to the surrounding vegetation. Are there more of the same plants, or is it a loner? Does it seem to have a relationship with its surroundings? Is it taller or shorter? Ask yourself “why?” Write down your thoughts. Don’t worry about being right or wrong. These are your observations, so there is no right or wrong. Your observations may change, and they most certainly will evolve as you spend more time in the field writing and drawing in your journal.\n\nfrom the journals of Marjorie Shropshire\n\nSharing Your Observations\n\nWhile the act of journaling is a very personal one, sharing nature journals is very enlightening. Perhaps on your next chapter field trip you can provide a pencil and paper to each participant, and when you find something particularly interesting stop and let everyone “journal” about it for 15 -30 minutes. After the field trip you can share your observations. You will be astonished to see how different each observation is, and how much you can learn from each other.\n\n↧\n\nExciting Things are Happening at FNPS...\n\nIn case you missed it, the FNPS Board Meeting and Council of Chapters Meeting was on August 13 at the FFS Leadership Training Center in Haines City. If you want to know more about what the Society is doing on the state level to support chapters and further our mission, or if you want to make a meaningful contribution to the society, please consider attending one of the quarterly retreats. Here are some of the highlights of what we discussed and accomplished. To read the complete summary, along with additional topics, click here.\n\nSubmitted by Donna Bollenbach\n\nFNPS Meets the Wild West….\n\nThe venue for the 2017 FNPS conference (May 17-21, 2017) was unveiled and approved by the board, and the winner is Westgate River Ranch Resort & Rodeo. In a secluded location just south of US Hwy 60 on the Kissimmee River, Westgate River Ranch is centrally located between the Atlantic and Gulf beaches within Polk County, Florida.\n\nLodging options include everything from rustic lodge suites with full or partial kitchens, to glamping (completely furnished air-conditioned tents) to RV and tent camping. There are also more expensive options, such as luxury teepees, cottages and cabins, but these are not part of the FNPS block or rooms. This venue was chosen for its availability in May, excellent lodging and food options, and its ability to accommodate our various space needs for meetings, vendors, plant sales and socials. While there are no nearby towns, stores or alternative lodging, it is surrounded by conservation lands and state parks for excellent fieldtrip opportunities. The lodging rates will be good for 3 days before and 3 days after the conference, so our members can take advantage of the venue’s other activities, such as airboat rides, fishing, horseback riding, hayrides, swamp buggy rides and more. Mark your calendars and dust off your cowboy boots.\n\nYou spoke, we listened: The New FNPS Conference Protocol:\n\nPhoto by Vince Lamb\n\nThe new conference protocol was revealed by the Conference Committee. Based on the input of FNPS members, FNPS conferences will be handled by a state committee and regional chapters, rather than individual chapter. Basically, one chapter will no longer be responsible for hosting the conference, but a state conference committee will take care of finding the venue, negotiating contracts (lodging, food, socials) and final scheduling. Since conferences will be planned by regions instead of individual chapters, several chapters in the region will be asked to take on one or two other tasks, such as registration, social activities, exhibit area, silent auction and program assistance. Chapters in and around the region may host field trips.\n\nLandscaping or Education: Make a difference and have fun doing it!\n\nThe next big topic of discussion was a need for a chair and members for the FNPS Landscape Committee and Education Committee. In my opinion these committees are not only two of the most important to the mission of FNPS, but probably the most creative and fun. Many ideas for projects that these committees could develop on the state level, then introduce to the chapters for distribution were discussed, such as:\n\nCreating a “Good Neighbor” program to educate people who live adjacent to state parks and preserves so they are made aware of the problems with planting or disposing of invasive plants in or around a natural public land.\n\nPick a native plant of the year and work all year to “inject” it into mainstream landscaping (in other words, create a demand and a market for it.)\n\nCreate a native plant “starter pack” with plants, care instructions and other materials and to make it easy for people to pick and a purchase a set of plants for a “butterfly garden,” a “coastal area” or a “the edge of a pond.”\n\nWork with local garden centers to create a once-a-month native plant sale/event.\n\nSo, if you are interested in being a chair of either of these committees, please contact Juliet Rynear or Catherine Bowman today.\n\nWhat do Craft Beers and Native Plants have in Common?\n\nRichard Brownscombe mentioned that we should marketing native plants as the “craft beers” of landscaping. “Craft beers,” he stated, “have taken a big share of the beer market and have traditional beer retailers and distributors jumping on the bandwagon.” Craft beers did not do this by trying to be the same, but they achieved this status by being different, independent and innovative. They take the traditional beer ingredients and add down-to-earth flavors, such as pumpkin, spice, cocoa, fruit and nuts. They transformed beer from merely a happy hour drink to a social experience. People seem to feel better about themselves when they choose a craft beer from an independent brewery vs a mass produced product. We want to make them feel the same way about native plants. We want to people to feel good about buying natives from our independent native nurseries. One day, we want to be able to say: “Native plants have taken a big share of the landscaping market and have traditional distributors and retailers jumping on the bandwagon.”\n\nFlorida Native Plant Month, the proclamations are coming…\n\nAttending a proclamation of Florida Native Plant month for your locality is another way to get FNPS in front of your legislatures. Andy Taylor will be contacting each chapter as the proclamations dates roll out. Please plan to send as many representatives to the proclamation as possible. While only one personal needs to speak, the presence of several people from your chapter is important. Also, it is nice to take a gift of native plant or native plant seed, along with an informational package) to give each of your commissioners. Speaking of Native Plant Month, please advertise all of your events in October on your Facebook page, website and in the FNPS calendar, then copy Andy on the details so he can promote it on the state level. Also, follow up by sending Andy photos of your proclamations and events.\n\nClearing the right-of-way for native plants…\n\nJuliet Rynear, speaking as the chair of the conservation committee, mentioned that monitoring natives in the right-of-way does not mean “no mowing.” What needs to be developed is a prescription for mowing that first defines what plants are in the right-of-way, then when is it ok to mow, and when not to mow. Just like we have developed prescriptions for fire to sustain plant populations, we need to develop prescriptions for mowing for the DOT.\n\nMembership…the road to 4000 members...\n\nThe other side has a detachable membership card.\n\nCurrently the FNPS membership stands at 3700. Jonnie Spitler, membership chair and president of the Nature Coast Chapter, introduced a new membership postcard/membership card to be sent to all new members. The Nature Coast Chapter generously donated the money to have these cards printed. Jonnie says our goal should be to have 4000 members by January of 2017. We should be pushing for more sustaining memberships. Sustaining members are those the that give $10.00 a month through an automatic payment. Are you a sustaining member?\n\nThe donor policy has passed…\n\nYou would think taking money would be a no-brainer: Someone offers it, you take it. Not so, especially for political candidates, environmental organizations, and people with a conscience. After a full year of committee involvement in writing and re-writing a donor policy, Devon Higginbotham, "
