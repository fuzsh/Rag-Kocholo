I'd photographed this flower earlier in Sikkim in Eastern India in May 2009, but did not know the name then.  Callicarpa longifolia is a species of beautyberry. It ranges from the Himalayas, Japan to Australia. It is grown in yards and gardens as an ornamental plant. The roots are used as an herbal medicine to treat diarrheas.
