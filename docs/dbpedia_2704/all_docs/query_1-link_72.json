He can be contacted at:\n\nPO Box 107, Stawell Vic 3380\n\nPhone: (03) 5356 2404\n\n>> Send email\n\nDuring extreme bushfire events neither these nor other plant types will protect your property.\n\nGood design and use of the plants listed will, however, reduce the chance of being burnt out.\n\nSimple test to gauge the fire vulnerability of the trees and shrubs in your garden:\n\nWhen fire restrictions permit burning off, throw a small sample of foliage from each tree and shrub onto a fire and see how much it flares up.\n\nConsider removing plants with foliage which flares fiercely.\n\nFire Resistant Plants. Plants that will not burn in the face of continued flame:\n\nFire Retardant Plants. Plants that will not burn in the first wave of a bushfire, but may burn once dried out:"
