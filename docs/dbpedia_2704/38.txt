INTRODUCTION

Callicarpa L. (Linnaeus, 1753: 111, Lamiaceae) with her nickname “beauty berry” is mainly distributed in tropical, subtropical, and temperate Asia, America, Australia, and some Pacific Islands (Bramley, 2009, 2013; Harley et al., 2004). There are about 140 species of Callicarpa recorded around the world, with 33 species recognized in the New World, particularly in the Caribbean Islands (24 species in Cuba). Obviously, the genus is more species-rich in the Old World, which was inferred as the origin center by the newest molecular phylogeny (Liu et al., 2022). Specifically, ca. 48 species were recognized in Temperate Asia, particularly in China (45 species and 12 varieties, Bramley, 2009, 2013; Ma, 2013). In addition, there were ca. 51 species recorded in Malesia, seven species in Australia (Munir, 1982), three species in the Pacific, and one species in Madagascar (Moldenke, 1950). Callicarpa has a long history as a member of Verbenaceae after being assigned by Robert Brown ( 1810). Based on numerous morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies, Callicarpa was transferred to Lamiaceae, along with several other genera, such as Premna L. (Linnaeus, 1771: 154) and Tectona L. (Linnaeus, 1753: 151) (Harley et al., 2004). Recently, evidences from palynology (Ma et al., 2016) and molecular phylogeny (Li et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2021) further corroborated the sister relationship between Callicarpa and the Australian endemic subfamily Prostantheroideae, and then, a new subfamily Callicarpoideae was established (Li et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2021).

Attempts to make a more scientific infrageneric classification for Callicarpa have been based on various morphological characters. According to calyx characters, Briquet ( 1895) divided the genus into two different groups: section Tubulosae, defined by tubular calyx with deeply 4-fid rim, and long, generally foliaceous lobes; section Cyathimorphae, characterized by campanulate or cyathiform calyx with a subtruncate and entire or only shortly 4-(or 5-) toothed rim. Subsequently, Chang ( 1951) found some examples that fell between Briquet's groups during his investigation of Chinese species. Then, he divided Callicarpa into two sections based on stamen features: section Eucallicarpa and section Verticirima. The former was characterized by small, ovate, longitudinally dehiscent anthers, with filaments twice or more than twice as long as the corolla. The latter was defined by its larger oblong anthers and filaments that are not longer than the corolla. Afterward, when compiling Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae, Fang ( 1982) divided Callicarpa into two subgenera based on hair types: Subgen. Peiantha, composed of a single taxon, C. peichieniana (1982: 78), which was characterized by strongly curved stem hair; while other species with various hair types were assigned to Subgen. Callicarpa. In recent years, evidences from morphology, palynology, and molecular phylogeny have proved that there was a sister relationship between Callicarpa and subfamily Prostantheroideae endemic in Australia and both formed a basal clade in Lamiaceae (Cai et al., 2021; Li et al., 2016; Ma, 2013; Ma et al., 2015; Ma & Su, 2015; Ma & Zhang, 2012; Zhao et al., 2021). Recently, more comprehensive phylogenic studies on the framework of Lamiaceae suggested establishing a new monotypic subfamily Callicarpoideae (Zhao et al., 2021). Liu et al. ( 2022) combined the analysis of phylogeny, biogeography, and statistics, and revealed that the fruit color of Callicarpa was strongly associated with geographical distribution. Besides, they also suggested all fruit colors of the genus were involved in dispersal events, and inferred violet fruit promoted diversification in Callicarpa and drove the evolution and diversity of different fruit colors between regions. In Asia, a number of Callicarpa are valued traditional medicinal plants and several of them, such as C. formosana (Trimen et al. 1882: 358), C. macrophylla (Vahl & Forssk, 1794: 13), C. kwangtungensis (Chun, 1934: 302), and C. nudiflora (Hooker et al. 1841: 206) have been intensively studied and included in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition). Furthermore, drug products of them are widely used in clinical (eg. Luo Hua Zi Zhu Pian, Kang Gong Yan Pian, Fu Yan Ning Jiao Nang, Wu et al., 2018). Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, ( 2020).

As part of our ongoing taxonomic revision of Callicarpa in China, some interesting specimens were collected from Neikengkou, Nanjing County (Fujian Province, China). After examination of the floras or monographs from China and the adjacent Asian regions (Bramley, 2009, 2013; Chen & Gilbert, 1994; Fang, 1982; Leeratiwong et al., 2009; Ma, 2013), as well as analysis of herbarium specimens, our discovered plants cannot be placed in none of the current known species of Callicarpa. Based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic data, we decided to propose the newly collected plants as a new species.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Morphology

Field surveys of the putative new species were carried out in Neikengkou, Nanjing County, Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, during the period of June–December 2021. Syndromes of the habitat, life form, hairs, leaves, cyme, and fruit were surveyed with naked eyes or a hand magnifier and photographs were taken in the field. Detailed characters of glandular, hair, floral anatomy, ovary, and seed were observed with stereomicroscope (NIKON SMZ25) in the laboratory. Examination of specimens was also made for morphological comparison with the related species (herbaria visited: GAUA, IBSC, PE, CSH, IBK, NY, G, E, A, P, TI, and K; acronyms according to Thiers, 2022). The size of leaves, cymes, flowers, and fruits was measured with a vernier caliper in the laboratory. All voucher photos of the putative new species were deposited in the “Chinese Field Herbarium” (https://www.cfh.ac.cn/album/ShowSpAlbum.aspx?spid=94377).

Molecular phylogeny

A total of 14 species representing the main sections, subsections, and series of Chinese Callicarpa were selected for molecular phylogenetic analyses with two species from Prostantheroideae: Dasymalla teckiana (Conn et al. 2011: 6) and Dicrastylis parvifolia (Mueller, 1861: 160) as the outgroups. Total DNA was extracted from fresh leaves dried with silica gel using a modified CTAB method (Doyle & Doyle, 1987). Two nuclear [internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS)] and five chloroplast (matK, rpl32-trnL, trnH-psbA, psbJ-petA, and trnS-trnG intergenic spacer) regions were chosen for phylogenetic analyses. PCR amplification, sequencing, sequence editing, and sequence assembly were performed according to Katoh and Standley ( 2013) and Kumar et al. ( 2016). The primer pairs used for PCR were shown in Table 1. Detailed information on the DNA regions and GenBank accession numbers of the species investigated in this study were shown in Table 2.

TABLE 1 Primers used for phylogenetic analyses.

TABLE 2 Information of voucher and GenBank accession numbers for sequence data.

Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) were conducted for the phylogenetic analyses by IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015) and MrBayes (Ronquist et al., 2012) in Phylosuite v1.2.2 (Zhang et al., 2020) and MrBayes on XSEDE3.2.7a as implemented in CIPRES (http://www.phylo.org/) (Miller et al., 2010) respectively. The bootstrap (BS) percentage for each branch was estimated by running 1000 bootstrap replicates. For BI analysis, ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017) was used for the selection of the most appropriate evolutionary model (nucleotide substitution model) (Edge-linked) using BIC criterion. The best partition models with BIC criterion were as follows: for ETS and ITS, HKY + F + G4; for matK, psbJ-petA, rpl32-trnL and trnG-trnS intergenic spacer, GTR + F + G4; for trnH-psbA intergenic spacer, F81 + F. The run with 1,000,000 generations was conducted. Four Markov chains with two runs were implemented and sampled every 100 generations, and the first 25% of all trees were regarded as “burn-in”. The majority consensus of the remaining trees was generated to show posterior probability (PP) support for clades. Stationarity was determined in Tracer v1.7.1 (Rambaut et al., 2018) and was considered to be attained when ESS > 200 or when the average standard deviation of the split frequencies was <0.01.

RESULTS Morphology

The putative new species is similar to Callicarpa hainanensis Ma & Zhang ( 2012: 573) and C. basitruncata Merrill ex Moldenke ( 1951: 406), and their detailed morphological comparison from life form, stem, leaves, cymes, calyx, corolla, and fruit were list in Table 3. The new species is most similar to C. hainanensis, and both share lots of common characteristics in branchlets, indumentum, leaf base, filament length, and the way of anther opening. Even so, it can be distinguished from C. hainanensis by its unique life form, adventitious roots at nodes, the morphology of calyx, calyx lobes, and the size of fruits (Table 3, Figures 1–3). In addition, the putative new species also resembles C. basitruncata, and they all have similar leaf shapes, cymes, and calyx, but it can differ from the latter by its procumbent life form, terete branchlets with adventitious roots at nodes, apparent linear lenticels, and leaf morphology (Table 3, Figures 1–3). In terms of leaf blade base, the putative new species is slightly similar to C. rubella and C. longipes, which all have cordate leaf bases. Obviously, it has filaments slightly shorter or as long as corolla, with larger oblong anthers, while the latter two species all have filaments twice or more than twice as long as the corolla, with small, ovate anthers.

Molecular phylogeny

The cpDNA dataset comprised an aligned matrix of 3958 base pairs (bp) with 814 bp for matk, 1046 bp for psbJ-petA intergenic spacer, 791 bp for rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer, 742 bp for trnG-trnS intergenic spacer, 565 bp for trnH-psbA intergenic spacer, and the nrDNA dataset comprised an aligned matrix of 1165 base pairs, with 461 bp for ETS and 704 bp for ITS. The topologies of Callicarpa phylogeny generated on the base of combined nrDNA (two loci) and cpDNA (five regions) separately from the ML and BI analyses are not obviously conflict with each other. Here, we present the analysis results based on the combined nrDNA + cpDNA dataset for a better-solved relationship among the related species investigated. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the genus Callicarpa is monophyletic (posterior probability, PP = 1.00; bootstrap percentage, BP = 100%) with two outgroups from Prostantheroideae. The putative new species forms a clade with C. rubella Lindl. (Lindley, 1825: 883), C. longipes Dunn ( 1908: 363), and C. japonica Thunb. (Thunberg, 1784: 153), and they form a sister clade with the remaining species of Callicarpa (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION Morphology

The new species is morphologically similar to Callicarpa hainanensis Ma & Zhang by sharing a series of similar features. Specifically, both have terete branchlets with stellate tomentum when young (becoming glabrous when old), and obvious linear lenticels. They have cordate leaf blade bases, slender cymes, with filaments slightly shorter than or as long as corolla, and oblong anthers, opening by an apical pore. However, C. stoloniformis can be easily distinguished from C. hainanensis due to its procumbent shrub (vs. erect shrub), which make it distinctive from the whole genus. Furthermore, C. stoloniformis has adventitious roots at nodes (vs. no adventitious roots at nodes), papery leaves (vs. subcoriaceous), cup-shaped or campanulate calyx (vs. long cup-shaped or subtubular), and truncate or shallow fissure calyx lobes (vs. sharply triangular, dehisced as fruits mature) and smaller fruits (1.5–2 mm vs. 4 mm in diameter; Table 3). In addition, the new species is also likely to be confused with C. basitruncata Merrill ex Moldenke, a species only known from the original description and a photograph of the holotype. Both species have oblong lanceolate leaf blades, abbreviated cymes, glabrous calyx, truncate or rare shallow fissure calyx lobes. However, it can be distinguished from C. basitruncata by its procumbent shrub (vs. erect shrub), terete branchlets (vs. obtusely tetragonal), with adventitious roots at nodes (vs. no adventitious roots at nodes), apparent linear lenticels on stem (vs. lenticels inconspicuous), and papery larger leaves (vs. membranous) with prominently cordate leaf base (vs. truncate) (Table 3). C. stoloniformis has a cordate leaf base, which to some extent makes it slightly similar to C. rubella and C. longipes, but its shorter filaments (as long as corolla) and larger oblong anthers differ it from the latter two species which have filaments twice or more than twice as long as the corolla, with small, ovate anthers.

Molecular phylogeny

The combined analysis indicated that Callicarpa is monophyletic (PP = 1.00, BP = 100%, Figure 4) with respect to the groups considered. Two main clades are formed and our phylogenetic result seems not being consistent with Chang's ( 1951) traditional classification system based on the length of filament, and morphology of anther, which is widely recognized (Bramley, 2009, 2013; Fang, 1982). The putative new species forms a well-supported sister clade with the clade composed by members of section Eucallicarpa: C. rubella and C. longipes (PP = 1.00, BP = 98%), and then, these three species form a weakly supported sister clade with C. japonica (section Verticirima) (PP = 0.63, BP = 48%, Figure 4). Although it forms a sister clade with C. rubella and C. longipes and shares few common characteristics in morphology, such as cordate leaf base, it can be obviously distinguished from the latter two species by its unique procumbent life form, adventitious roots at nodes, and shorter filaments or as long as corolla (typical characters of section Verticirima). Moreover, it also can be easily identified from C. japonica by its procumbent life form, adventitious roots at nodes, stellate hairs on the young branchlets and inflorescence, and cordate leaf base. It is strange that C. hainanensis which we think the most morphologically similar species with C. stoloniformis (mentioned above), firstly forms a clade with C. brevipes (Benth.) Hance ( 1886: 233) and C. giraldii Hesse ex Rehd. (Rehder, 1914: 629), subsequently form a moderately supported sister clade with the clade including C. stoloniformis, C. japonica, C. rubella, and C. longipes (Figure 4).
