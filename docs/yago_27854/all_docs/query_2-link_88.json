She was the sixth child and second daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Her godfather was the chronicler Robert of Torigny, who had a special interest in her and recorded her life as best he could. She received her first name as a namesake of her mother, whose name \"Eleanor\" (or Alienor) had previously been unrecorded though may have been related to the Greek Helen or the Italian Elena. Another view holds that in the Occitan language, Eleanor simply meant \"the other Aenor,\" since Eleanor of Aquitaine was named for her mother, called Aenor.\n\nEleanor was a younger maternal half-sister of Marie de Champagne and Alix of France.

She was also an older sister of Joan of Sicily and John of England.\n\nWhen she was eighteen years old, in September 1180, she was married to Alfonso VIII. The marriage was arranged to secure the Pyrennean border, with Gascony offered as her dowry.\n\nOf all Eleanor of Aquitaine's daughters, her namesake Eleanor (who was called Leonor by her Spanish subjects) best inherited her mother's political influence. She reigned alongside her husband, who specified in his will that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death.

Fue hija del rey Enrique II de Inglaterra y de su esposa, la reina Leonor de Aquitania.\n\nFue madre, entre otros, de los reyes Enrique I de Castilla y Berenguela I de Castilla.\n\nFue hija del rey Enrique II de Inglaterra y de su esposa, la reina Leonor de Aquitania. Por parte paterna fueron sus abuelos Godofredo V de Anjou y su esposa Matilde de Inglaterra, hija del rey Enrique I de Inglaterra. Por parte materna fueron sus abuelos Guillermo X de Poitiers, conde de Poitiers, y su esposa Leonor de Châtellerault, duquesa de Aquitania.\n\nFueron sus hermanos, entre otros, los reyes Ricardo Corazón de León y Juan sin Tierra, monarcas de Inglaterra.\n\nNació en 1160 y en septiembre de 1170 se desposó en la ciudad de Tarazona con Alfonso VIII de Castilla, quien había sido coronado en la ciudad de Burgos un año antes, y antes del matrimonio, sus padres, los reyes de Inglaterra, concedieron como dote a su hija el ducado de Aquitania, que pertenecía a su madre, la reina Leonor de Aquitania. Alfonso VIII de Castilla concedió como dote a su esposa los castillos de Burgos y Castrojeriz, Amaya, Avia, Saldaña, Monzón de Campos, Carrión de los Condes, Dueñas, Tariego de Cerrato, Cabezón, Medina del Campo, Astudillo, Aguilar y Villaescusa, y las rentas del puerto de Santander, Cabedo, Besgo de Santillana, Tudela, Calahorra, Arnedo, Vigera, Metria, las del castillo y ciudad de Nájera, Logroño, Grañón, Belorado, Pancorbo, Piedralada, Poza de la Sal, monasterio de Rodilla, Atienza, Ciudad de Osma, Peñafiel, Curiel de Duero, Hita, Zurita y Peñanegra, y para su cámara la ciudad de Burgos y la villa de Castrojeriz, con todos sus derechos y rentas, y le donaría además la mitad de los territorios que conquistase a los musulmanes desde que su matrimonio fuera celebrado.\n\nEl matrimonio sirvió para reforzar la frontera pirenaica, y Leonor Plantagenet aportó además como dote de boda el condado de Gascuña que Alfonso VIII nunca pudo anexionar a la corona de Castilla. Sin embargo, numerosos caballeros gascones vinieron a la península para ayudar a su señor en la lucha contra los almohades. Hacia 1180 el monarca castellano y su esposa decidieron fundar un monasterio de monjas cistercienses, el monasterio de las Huelgas de Burgos. Aquella fundación, dependiente en principio del Monasterio de Santa María de la Caridad de Tulebras, en (Navarra), se convirtió desde 1187, por deseo de los reyes, en casa madre de todas las abadías femeninas cistercienses en territorio de Castilla y fue elegido por Alfonso VIII y su esposa como panteón real para ellos y sus descendientes.\n\nLa reina ordenó edificar en la catedral de Toledo una capilla dedicada a Santo Tomás Becket o Tomás Canturiense (de Canterbury), como era conocido entonces, que fue la primera dedicada al santo británico fuera de las Islas Británicas. La capilla no se conserva en la actualidad porque fue destruída y su espacio pasó a formar parte de la capilla de Santiago de la Catedral de Toledo, que fue edificada por el condestable Álvaro de Luna para construir su propia capilla funeraria. Asimismo en 1183, sobre el solar de la mezquita de Cuenca ordenó que se comenzase a construir una catedral para la ciudad manchega, que había sido reconquistada recientemente.\n\nLa reina Leonor Plantagenet falleció el día 31 de octubre de 1214, varias semanas después de que falleciera su esposo, el rey Alfonso VIII de Castilla, quien falleció el día 6 de octubre de 1214.\n\nSources: See those of her descendants.\n\nQueen Leonora (October 13, 1162 – October 31, 1214), was born as Princess Eleanor of England (and Aquitaine) and became Leonora, Queen of Castile as wife of Alfonso VIII of Castile.\n\nShe was born in the castle at Domfront, Normandy, and was baptised by Henry of Marcy. She was the sixth child and second daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Her godfather was the chronicler Robert of Torigny, who had a special interest in her and recorded her life as best he could. She received her first name as a namesake of her mother, whose name \"Eleanor\" (or Alienor) had previously been unrecorded though may have been related to the Greek Helen or the Italian Elena. Another view holds that in the Occitan language, Eleanor simply meant \"the other Aenor,\" since Eleanor of Aquitaine was named for her mother, called Aenor.\n\nEleanor was a younger maternal half-sister of Marie de Champagne and Alix of France. She was a younger sister of William, Count of Poitiers, Henry the Young King, Matilda of England, Richard I of England and Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany. She was also an older sister of Joan of Sicily and John of England.\n\nWhen she was eighteen years old, in 1180, she was married to Alfonso VIII. The marriage was arranged to secure the Pyrennean border, with Gascony offered as her dowry.\n\nOf all Eleanor of Aquitaine's daughters, her namesake Eleanor (who was called Leonor by her Spanish subjects) best inherited her mother's political influence. She reigned alongside her husband, who specified in his will that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death. It was she who persuaded him to marry their daughter Berenguela to the king of Leon in the interest of peace.\n\nWhen Alfonso died, his queen was reportedly so devastated with grief that she was unable to preside over the burial. Their daughter Berenguela instead performed these honors. Leonora then took sick and died only twenty-eight days after her husband, and was buried at Las Huelgas abbey in Burgos.\n\nChildren of Leonora and Alfonso Berenguela, Queen of Castile (August 1180 - 8 November 1246), married King Alfonso IX of Leon Sancho of Castile (born & died 1181) Sancha of Castile (1182 - 3 February 1184) Henry of Castile (born & died 1184) Urraca, princess of Castile (1186-1220), married King Alfonso II of Portugal Blanca of Castile (4 March 1188 - 26 November 1252), married King Louis VIII of France Fernando of Castile (29 September 1189 - 1211) Mafalda of Castile (1191-1204) Constance of Castile (1195-1198) Leonor of Castile (1200-1244), married King James I of Aragon Constanza, nun at Las Huelgas (1201-1243) Henry I, King of Castile (14 April 1204 - 1217)\n\nEleanor of England (also known as Leonora de Ingleterra) was Queen of Castile as wife of Alfonso VIII of Castile.

Casada con Alfonso VIII de Castilla con solamente nueve años de edad, su dote fue el condado de Gascuña (lo que aseguraría el borde de los Pirineos), aunque su marido nunca lo pudo anexionar al reino de Castilla. Tuvo gran influencia política y reinó interviniendo junto al rey castellano, el cual especificó en su testamento que sería ella quien gobernaría Castilla durante la minoría de edad del heredero.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPedigree Resource File Ver a la persona en el modo de cuadro genealógico\n\nname:\n\nEleanor Plantagenet Princess of England (AFN: 4HX7-LVH)\n\nsexo: female\n\nnacimiento: 13 October 1162 , Domfront, Normandy\n\ndefunción: 25 October 1214\n\nLas Huelgas, Burgos, Burgos, Spain\n\nbautismo en otra Iglesia: , Domfront, Normandie\n\nentierro: , Monasterio De Las Huelgas, Burgos, Spain\n\nmatrimonio: 22 September 1177 , Burgos, Burgos, Spain\n\nmatrimonio: 22 September 1177 , Burgos, Burgos, Spain\n\nnúmero de CD: 43\n\nPadres\n\nPadre: Henry Plantagenet II, King of England (AFN: 4HWC-9XS)\n\nmadre:\n\nEleanor d' Aquitaine Princess of Aquitaine, Queen of England (AFN: 4HWC-F3B)\n\nMatrimonios (2) (NOTA: Es el mismo Alfonso VIII)\n\ncónyuge: Alfonso VIII, King of Castile (AFN: 4HX7-L2J)\n\nmatrimonio: 22 September 1177 , Burgos, Burgos, Spain\n\nOcultar hijos (2)\n\nhijo 1:\n\nBerenguela de Castilla (AFN: 4HX6-JK5)\n\nsexo: female nacimiento: aproximadamente 1180\n\nof, Burgos, Castile defunción: 8 November 1246\n\nBurgos, Castile entierro: Las Huelgas Monastary\n\nhijo 2:\n\nBlanca de Castilla (AFN: 4HX9-ZG6)\n\nsexo: female nacimiento: antes de 4 March 1188\n\nChãateau de Palencia, Valencia, Valencia, Almohadi defunción: 27 November 1252\n\nPalais du Louvre, Paris, France\n\ncónyuge: (NOTA: es el mismo, sólo con su patronímico)\n\nAlfonso SANCHEZ VIII, King Of CASTILE (AFN: 4J29-ZQ7)\n\nmatrimonio: 22 September 1177 , Burgos, Burgos, Spain\n\nEnvío identificador de envío:MM9R-JWJ persona que aporta los datos:sboylan3765059fecha:lunes, 03 de septiembre de 2001 persona que aporta los datos:sboylan2710652fecha:lunes, 03 de septiembre de 2001 recuento de personas:43801\n\nNotas (1) Born 13 Oct 1162 at Domfront, Normandy; died 25 Oct 1214 and buried at the Abbey of Las Huelgas, which she had founded.\n\nFuentes (3) 1.
