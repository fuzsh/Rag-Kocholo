She was a daughter of Henry II of England and his wife, Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nEleanor was born in the castle at Domfront, Normandy, and was baptised by Henry of Marcy. She was the sixth child and second daughter of King Henry II and Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine. She received her first name as a namesake of her mother, whose name \"Eleanor\" (or Alienor) had previously been unrecorded though may have been related to the Greek Helen or the Italian Elena. Another view holds that in the Occitan language, Eleanor simply meant \"the other Aenor,\" since Eleanor of Aquitaine was named for her mother, called Aenor.\n\nEleanor was a younger maternal half-sister of Marie de Champagne and Alix of France. She was a younger sister of William IX, Count of Poitiers, Henry the Young King, Matilda, Duchess of Saxony, Richard I of England and Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany. She was also an older sister of Queen Joan of Sicily and King John of England.\n\nWhen she was 14 years old, before 17 September 1177, she was married to King Alfonso VIII of Castile in Burgos.[1][2] The marriage was arranged to secure the Pyreneean border, with Gascony offered as her dowry.\n\nOf all Eleanor of Aquitaine's daughters, her namesake Eleanor best inherited her mother's political influence. She was almost as powerful as her husband, who specified in his will that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death. It was she who persuaded him to marry their daughter Berengaria to the King of Leon in the interest of peace.\n\nWhen Alfonso died, his Queen was reportedly so devastated with grief that she was unable to preside over the burial. Their eldest daughter, Berengaria, instead performed these honours. Eleanor then took sick and died only twenty-eight days after her husband, and was buried at Las Huelgas Abbey in Burgos.\n\nShe and her husband had the following surviving issue:[2][3]\n\nInfanta Berenguela (Berengaria) Burgos born 1 January/\n\nJune 1180 Las Huelgas near Burgos to 8 November 1246. Married firstly in Seligenstadt on 23 April 1188 with Duke Conrad II of Swabia, but the union (only by contract and never solemnized) was later annulled. Married in Valladolid between 1/16 December 1197 with King Alfonso IX of León as her second wife.[6] After their marriage was dissolved on grounds of consanguinity in 1204, she returned to her homeland and became regent of her minor brother King Henry I. Queen of Castile in her own right after the death of Henry I in 1214, immediately abdicated in favor of her son.\n\nInfante Sancho Burgos, born 5 April 1181 to 26 July 1181 Heir of the throne since his birth, died aged three months.\n\nInfanta Sancha 20/28 March 1182 to 3 February 1184/\n\n16 October 1185 Died in infancy.\n\nInfante Enrique (Henry) 1184 to 1184? Heir of the throne since his birth, died either shortly after being born or in infancy. His existence is disputed among sources.\n\nInfanta Urraca 1186/28 May 1187 Coimbra to 3 November 1220. Married in 1206 to Prince Alfonso, who succeeded his father in 1212 as King Alfonso II of Portugal.\n\nInfanta Blanca (Blanche) Palencia, 4 March 1188 Paris to 27 November 1252. Married in the Abbaye de Port-Mort near Pont-Audemer, Normandy on 23 May 1200 with Prince Louis, who succeeded his father in 1223 as King Louis VIII of France. Regent of the Kingdom of France during her son's minority (12261234) and during his absence on the Seventh Crusade.\n\nInfante Fernando (Ferdinand) Cuenca born 29 September 1189 Madrid to\n\n14 October 1211. Heir of the throne since his birth. On whose behalf Diego of Acebo and the future Saint Dominic travelled to Denmark in 1203 to secure a bride.[7] He died soon after returning from campaigning against the Moors.\n\nInfanta Mafalda Plasencia born 1191 Salamanca, died 1211. Betrothed in 1204 to Infante Ferdinand of Leon, eldest son of King Alfonso IX and stepson of her oldest sister.\n\nInfanta Constanza (Constance) born 1195 Las Huelgas, died 1243. A nun at the Cistercian monastery of Santa María la Real at Las Huelgas in 1217, she later became Abbess of her community.\n\nInfanta Leonor (Eleanor) born 1202 Las Huelgas, died 1244. Married in Ágreda on 6 February 1221 with King James I of Aragon. After her marriage was dissolved on grounds of consanguinity in April 1229, she became a nun at the Cistercian monastery of Santa María la Real at Las Huelgas.\n\nKing Enrique I (Henry I) of Castile Valladolid born 14 April 1204 Palencia, died 6 June 1217. Only surviving son, he succeeded his father in 1214 aged ten under the regency firstly of his mother and later his oldest sister Berengaria. Married in Burgos before 29 August 1215 with Infanta Mafalda of Portugal, the union was unconsummated and dissolved in 1216 on grounds of consanguinity. Soon after his divorce was betrothed with Infanta Sancha of León, eldest daughter of King Alfonso IX and stepdaughter of her oldest sister, but died when a tile came off a roof before the marriage could be solemnized.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 ENGLAND KINGS 1066-1603\n\n2 a b Weir, 64.\n\n3 CASTILE\n\n4 New international encyclopedia, Vol.13, (Dodd, Mead and Company, 1915), 782.\n\n5 Vicaire. pp 8998.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nFraser, Antonia.
