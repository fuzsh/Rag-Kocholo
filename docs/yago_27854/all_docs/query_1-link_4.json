        "text": "Edward I (17/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots, was King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1272 to 1307.[1] Concurrently, he ruled the duchies of Aquitaine and Gascony as a vassal of the French king. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as the Lord Edward.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England\n\nEleanor of Castile (1241 – 28 November 1290) was Queen of England as the first wife of Edward I, whom she married as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony.\n\nThe marriage was known to be particularly close, and Eleanor travelled extensively with her husband. She was with him on the Ninth Crusade, when he was wounded at Acre, but the popular story of her saving his life by sucking out the poison has long been discredited. When she died, at Harby near Lincoln, her grieving husband famously ordered a stone cross to be erected at each stopping-place on the journey to London, ending at Charing Cross.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Castile\n\nTomb Effigy of Eleanor at Lincoln Cathedral:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipe...nor_of_Castile_-_geograph.org.uk_-_356028.jpg\n\nMargaret of France (c. 1279 – 14 February 1318) was Queen of England as the second wife of King Edward I. She was a daughter of Philip III of France and Maria of Brabant.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_France,_Queen_of_England\n\nEdward's children with Eleanor were:\n\nKatherine (1261 or 1263 – September 1264)\n\nJoan (1265 – before 7 September 1265)\n\nJohn (10 July 1266 – 3 August 1271)\n\nHenry (6 May 1268 – 14 October 1274)\n\nEleanor (18 June 1269 – 19 August 1298)\n\nUnnamed daughter (1271 – 1271 or 1272)\n\nJoan (1272 – 23 April 1307)\n\nAlphonso (24 November 1273 – 19 August 1284)\n\nMargaret (c.15 March 1275 – after 11 March 1333)\n\nBerengaria (May 1276 – between 1277 and 1278)\n\nUnnamed child (January 1278 – 1278)\n\nMary (11 March 1278 – before 8 July 1332)\n\nElizabeth (August 1282 – c. 5 May 1316)\n\nEdward II (25 April 1284 – 21 September 1327)\n\nHis children by Margaret of France were:\n\nThomas (1 June 1300 – 4 August 1338)\n\nEdmund (5 August 1301 – 19 March 1330)\n\nEleanor (4 May 1306 – August 1311)\n\nKing Louis IX of France had been planning a new crusade.\n\nThe future King Edward I was trying to get money to fit out a crusader army.\n\nHe took a seventeen thousand pound loan from King Louis IX, repayable from the revenues of Bordeaux.\n\nEdward was on the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land in 1270,he had to return to England following the death of his father,Henry III.\n\nIn June 1272 he was almost assassinated"
