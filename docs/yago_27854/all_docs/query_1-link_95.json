        "text": "In agreement with the statement above, Edward the VI did inherit a flawed kingdom through his father Henry the VIII. Firstly, Europe was divided by Reformation which caused conflict lasting over a hundred years. Catholicism was strongest in southern countries, for instance, Spain and Italy whilst Protestantism was more prominent in northern countries, such as Scandenavia. However, some countries i.e, Belgium, Netherlands, Poland and France suffered from mixed beliefs which caused tension. However, conflict was still high under the reign of Edward whom took a great interest in religious\n\nGodwin's rise to power was rapid. In 1017, when King Cnut created the English Earldoms, Godwin became the Earl of Wessex. Two years later he went with Cnut on a visit to Denmark, where Cnut was so impressed by Godwin that he arranged for him to marry Gytha, sister of Ulf.They had several children: Swegen, Tostig, Harold, Gyrth and Edith. By the time Edward the Confessor became king in 1042 he was the most powerful Earl in Anglo-Saxon England. King Edward married Edith in order to keep Godwin loyal to him and his sons became Earls (Swegen became the Earl of Hereford, Gloucester and Oxford and Harold became the Earl of East Anglia). He also had a nephew (Beorn) who was Earl of Hertforshire\n\nHe used the Burghal Defense started by his father, to conquer lands and accomplish this. He built new burghs and extended the ones that his father put in place. When he died, he had the most powerful kingdom in the British Isles. Edward the Elder expanded modern English territory by using his military strategies to bring Danelaw and South of the Humber River back under English control. After he died, Edward’s son Athelstan took control of Northumbria and continued his father’s plan to unite England and expand English territory. Edward the Elder was largely responsible for a unified modern day\n\nHis leadership skills and military prowess set a benchmark for all future English Kings during the war to try and live up to and improve on. In his first major victory, a naval battle at Sluys in 1340, Edward demonstrated his leadership ability when he seized the moment and launched a surprise attack that destroyed the French fleet. A major factor in the victory was the style of the English attack. ‘Edward sent his ships [...] two ships crammed with archers and one full of men-at-arms. The English ships with the archers would come alongside a French ship and rain arrows down on its decks, the men-at-arms would then board and take the vessel’ .\n\nKing Henry V, son of Henry IV, forged his legend in a little over nine years. He made England one of the strongest kingdoms in Europe and academic KB McFarlane even described him as “the greatest man who ever ruled England”. Even though Henry V was said to be brave, fair, likeable and a great warrior, he was also arrogant, ruthless, cruel on campaign and organised massacres. So, how did such a man come to be a national hero?\n\nThere are many things that all occurred that had allowed for Edward I of England to achieve the overlordship of Scotland. From the controlling of Wales and Ireland, he eventually gained control of Man. The fact that the Church of Scotland was not completely recognised by the papacy meant that the kings of Scotland were not real kings in the eyes of Edward I. The surprise death of Alexander III, quickly followed by the death of the Maid of Norway led to a succession crisis and the potential for a civil war for the right to rule in Scotland.\n\nNovember 12, 1272 was a day that a great man became ruler over England. Shortly before this day, on November 16, 1272, King Henry III died from injuries that he got from an ambush. Before King Henry III past away he gave his throne to Edward I. On November 12, 1272 King Edward I took the place of his father, and did not want to disappoint him. His dad had given lands in Wales, Ireland and the Channel Islands\n\nEdward III got proclaimed warden of the kingdom because of his father’s absence (Luminarium). Edward III ascended to the throne on the 13th of January 1327, after his father, Edward II was forced to abdicate from the throne (Soud, p. 96). The parliament recognized Edward as king, and he was crowned a couple of days later. Edward II had been an indisputably bad king, and never developed a strong core and got persuaded by stronger personalities around him (Soud, p. 95). He was in reality the puppet of Isabella of France, his wife and her lover, Roger Mortimer, the Earl of March, who both ruled England through him and planned Edward II’s downfall (English Monarchs). Edward II agreed to abdicate in favor of his 14-year-old son to restore the power and prestige of the weakened England (Soud, p. 95). During Edward III first few years of his reign, his matters of state remained in the hands of his mother and Mortimer (Soud, p.\n\nKing Edward VIII, known as ‘David’ to the family, was the eldest child of King George V and his wife, Queen Mary of Teck. While growing up, Edward did not have a close relationship with his father which created a lack of sympathy and understanding between the two. Due to their different perspectives, they were not able to relate on issues concerning the Crown as “(King George V was) strict and self-disciplined… who sought to imbue their children with a strong sense of duty”1. Whereas Edward would grow bored of the formalities of royal occasions. Although Edward disliked the work of the Crown, he did multiple tours on behalf of Britain to establish the seriousness of the Monarchy’s role. From 1919 to 1922, he travelled to almost every continent including South America, Australia and the Far\n\nIn April, 1483, King Edward VI tragically passed away leaving his two sons Edward aged twelve and Richard aged ten behind. England needed another King but unfortunately during the time both sons were too young to rule over England on their own. In the meantime King Edward had chosen a protector to protect the country which was Richard the boy's uncle. Once the boys grew older they moved to the Tower of London as he was getting ready for his coronation. Just before the coronation in June rumours went around about King Edward VI being married to another women at the time he was married to the boy’s mother. That then made Edward illegitimate and as a result that made the boy’s uncle Richard King of the United Kingdom. The boy's continued on living\n\nIt was 1307 and Edward I who was sixty eight at the time of his death would now pass the throne to his son Edward II. Edward II who was “Lord of Caernarfon, prince of Wales, duke of Aquitaine, earl of Chester and count of Pontheiu” would now inherit a war with Scotland from his father. Edward II was rather a particular fellow with unusual hobbies that he showed throughout his reign. Evidence points that Edward II may have had a relationship with Piers Gaveston, but also he had been banished from the kingdom by his father Edward I. This incident or should I say interest in men would become one of the biggest problems throughout all of his reign. Piers Gaveston was disliked very much by parliament and several times was banished by Edward I during his reign. Edward II would also come to marry Isabella the “daughter of Phillip IV” , which in the end led to the end of his reign, but before we get to that, there was also a man named Hugh Despenser that would become an affectionate friend for Edward II after Piers Gaveston death. Piers Gaveston caused much trouble for Lancaster and Warwick. He was hated by them significantly that in 1312 he was captured and executed by them and it caused much pain for the king who loved Gaveston much."
