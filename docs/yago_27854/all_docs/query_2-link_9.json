        "text": "Following the marriage the couple travelled to Gascony where they set up their own household, not returning to England until 1255. It was during this time that, it is believed, Eleanor gave birth to her first child, a stillborn girl. Eleanor was to go on to have another (probably) fifteen children, many of whom failed to reach adulthood.\n\nCrusades, childbirth and coronations\n\nLittle detail is available of Eleanor’s life during her first few years in England. She was, however, known for supporting her husband in several conflicts, especially the Second Barons War (1264-1267) between Henry III and the barons led by Simon de Montfort. During this time and in the few years preceding her next military excursion with Edward, Eleanor had a further five children with only one surviving beyond six years of age, a daughter named Eleanor (yet another one!) who lived to be 29 years old.\n\nIn 1270 Eleanor embarked with her husband on what is now known as the Ninth Crusade. They arrived in Acre, a city at the centre of the kingdom of Jerusalem, to find it under siege. By May 1272 a truce between the factions had been agreed, but in the following month Edward was the victim of an assassination attempt when he was was struck in the arm by a dagger believed to be dipped in poison. Myth would have it that Eleanor saved her husband’s life by sucking the poison from the wound, though this is now believed to be apocryphal. What is certain is that during their time on the crusade Eleanor gave birth to her sixth child Joan, who became known as Joan of Acre after her place of birth.\n\nIn September 1272 the couple arrived in Sicily to be given news of Henry’s death. One may have expected the royal couple to have hastened back to England but, given the political stability that now existed in the country, they were in no rush to return, stopping off in Gascony to put down a rebellion! They finally arrived in England on 2nd August 1274, with Edward’s coronation being held seventeen days later.\n\nAt this point Eleanor must have been acutely aware of her declining health as she started to plan for the marriages of three of her children, Margaret, Joan, and Edward.\n\nShe intended to review her estates in the North when the couple embarked on their final journey in late July 1290. Progress was gradual and the cortege reached Harby on the border of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire in November. Eleanor was now too unwell to travel back to London. She passed away on 28th November, with Edward as always, by her side. It is not known with any certainty what caused Eleanor’s death; one view is that she suffered from the effects of an infection after contracting malaria in Gascony, another is that she was suffering from some form of congenital coronary disease."
