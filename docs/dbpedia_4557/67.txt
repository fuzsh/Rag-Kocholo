Early Origins of the Burckhardt family

The surname Burckhardt was first found in Swabia, where the name was closely identified in early medieval times with the feudal society which would become prominent throughout European history. The name would later emerge as a noble family with great influence, having many distinguished branches, and would become noted for its involvement in social, economic, and political affairs.

Saint Burchard (d. 754), was the first bishop of Würzburg and it believed to have been from a noble English family, "but beyond this fact there is nothing authentic known respecting his origin. He was one of the most active associates of his countryman, St. Boniface, Archbishop of Mayence. In the autumn of 741 he was consecrated bishop of Würzburg by Boniface, who at the same time established two other bishoprics, Buraburg and Eichstädt, to which he appointed his friends Witta and Willibald.
