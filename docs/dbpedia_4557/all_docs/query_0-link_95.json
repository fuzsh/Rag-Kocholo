        "text": "Charles Simic (1938-2023)\n\nMy mother was a braid of black smoke.\n\nShe bore me swaddled over the burning cities.\n\nThe sky was a vast and windy place for a child\n\nto play.\n\nWe met many others who were just like us.\n\nThey were trying to put on their overcoats with\n\narms made of smoke.\n\nThe high heavens were full of little shrunken\n\ndeaf ears instead of stars.\n\nBorn in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia and witness to atrocities of both Nazis and Stalinists, experiences which naturally echoed repeatedly in his work, the poet, essayist and translator Charles Simic was taken by his mother when he was fifteen first to Paris and then to rejoin his father in the USA. Drafted into the Vietnam era US Army, he completed a B.A. at NYU in 1966, though his first poems appeared already in 1959. For most of his professional life he was a professor at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nSince his death due to complications of dementia on January 9, I have been reading/re-reading his poetry and translations, re-connecting with his unique voice and both lamenting his passing and celebrating his career. Over the decades I have amassed quite a shelfful of his books indeed, so an overview of nearly sixty years of his fecund gifts is out of the question. Instead, I shall focus on The World Doesn’t End (1989), winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1990.\n\nOrdinarily, I am not an aficionado of prose poetry – a most unfortunate oxymoron for a hybrid form of literature which usually fails to convince me of the utility of its existence. However, occasionally the rare poet can pull it off, and, for me, Simic does so in The World Doesn’t End.\n\nOften delivered with a deceptive playfulness and offhandedness, Simic’s poetry ranges from the surreal metaphysical to pointed, often dark humor, generally expressed with brief and unembellished sentences whose seeming credibility contrast mightily with the outrageous scenes he is portraying.\n\nIn the fourth year of the war, Hermes showed\n\nup. He was not much to look at. His mailman’s\n\ncoat was in tatters; mice ran in and out of its pock-\n\nets. The broad-brimmed hat he was wearing had\n\nbullet holes. He still carried the famous stick that\n\ncloses the eyes of the dying, but it looked gnawed.\n\nDid he let the dying bite on it? Whatever the case,\n\nhe had no letters for us. “God of thieves!” we\n\nshouted behind his back when he could no longer\n\nhear us.\n\nNonetheless, some strike me as enormously evocative.\n\nO witches, O poverty! The two who with a\n\nsidelong glance measured the thinness of my neck\n\nthrough the bars of the birdcage I carried on my\n\nshoulder…\n\nThey were far too young and elegant to be\n\nstorybook witches. They wore low-cut party\n\ndresses, black seams in their stockings, lips thickly\n\npainted red.\n\nThe big-hearted trees offered their leaves by\n\nwhispering armfuls over the winding path where the\n\ntwo eventually vanished.\n\nI was left with my cage, its immense heaviness,\n\nits idiotic feeding dish, the even more absurd vanity\n\nmirror, and the faintly sounding silver bell.\n\nPerhaps you will, too.\n\nI toppled next to him, the body flipped,\n\nstiff already, as a gut string snaps.\n\nShot in the nape. “You’ll end like this as well,”\n\nI whispered to myself, “Lie still, relax.\n\nNow, Death’s the rose they say that patience makes.”\n\n“Der springt noch auf,” rang out above me.\n\nOn my ear the muddied blood was caking.\n\nPicture Postcards 4, translated by John M. Ridland and Peter V. Czipott\n\nMiklós Radnóti (born Glatter) was born in Budapest to a family of assimilated Jewish textile manufacturers and vendors but was able to resist his family’s pressures to enter the family business and instead studied philosophy and languages at the University of Szeged, where he submitted his doctoral thesis in 1934. In 1935 he married Fanni Gyarmati (1912–2014!); by all reports (including Radnóti’s moving love poetry), the marriage was very happy, if heedlessly curtailed by Hungarian fascists some time in November, 1944, as Radnóti and more than 3,000 other Hungarian Jews who constituted a slave labor brigade for the Hungarian army were driven back to Hungary from the mountains of Serbia as the Axis forces retreated before the vengeful partisans of Marshall Tito. From the above quote (just one of many such to be found in his poetry), Radnóti knew that if he evidenced too much weakness, his Hungarian guards would shoot him where he lay. Shortly before the Hungarian border the injuries he suffered from a vicious beating by a guard who objected to his scribbling in his notebook were too much for him, and he was finally gunned down in the snow.\n\nHis corpse was thrown into an unmarked mass grave but was disinterred after the war; the notebook, containing the texts he wrote during the last of three conscriptions into a labor battalion between 1940 and 1944, was found in the remains of his pocket – much of it still legible – and posterity was graced with a great poet’s witness of, for ordinary human beings, unspeakably cruel circumstances.\n\nThe final poems – the Picture Postcards – are achingly laconic and brief, as if he knew that he had to prevent the reader turning away from the horror, or perhaps because his own mind shied away from what he experienced.\n\nNine kilometers from here\n\nhaystacks, houses burn,\n\nfrom the meadow margin watch\n\nshaken peasants, silent, smoking.\n\nOnto rippling lake waters\n\nsteps a tiny shepherd girl\n\nand the ruffled flock\n\nbends, drinks clouds.\n\nPicture Postcards 2, translated by Jack Roberts\n\nEarlier in his unwilling service to the Fascist masters he wrote less laconic poems about his time in the labor camps, but they are too lengthy to quote here.\n\nIt would be a great mistake, though, to imagine that the poetic interest in Radnóti’s work is limited to that time of extreme trial or that he was a one-note author. Consider this poem written in the Spring of 1930, where he writes of irrepressible joy with almost haiku-like concentration and care:\n\nAs happy, with a woman on my chest,\n\nas when the sun shines after April rain,\n\nI shout! and straight away, clean-rinsed in light,\n\nmy voice rings, like that bird’s up to his middle,\n\nnow, in the crystal puddle.\n\nAfter April Rain, translated by John M. Ridland and Peter V. Czipott\n\nAnd the many love poems he wrote to his wife before the bad times (and during) give the lie to my long-set belief that there was no way to write a love poem that hadn’t already been written countless times. Here is one from February, 1942:\n\nFor so long I’ve been hiding you\n\nas among bough’s leaves slowly\n\nripening fruit’s concealed,\n\nas the unperturbed ice-flower\n\non a winter window pane\n\nyou blossom in my mind.\n\nAnd I know what it means when\n\nyour hand flutters to your hair,\n\nand in my heart I also keep\n\nyour ankle’s little tilt,\n\nyour ribs’ fine curve\n\nso coolly I admire,\n\nas one already at home\n\nwith living wonders.\n\nAnd often in my dreams\n\nI have a hundred arms\n\nand like a dreamed-of god\n\nin my hundred arms I enfold you.\n\nI’ve Been Hiding You, translated by Jack Roberts\n\nThough Radnóti’s work encompasses many other topics (many more than I can exemplify here), it is not surprising that a sensitive poet with his eyes on the world and not just on himself would sense the coming dangers(*) and return again and again to the foul dread emerging from the Fascist caverns in men’s souls. Even with the limited selection of his work available to me in translation, I saw him writing about the coming war at least by 1936.\n\nIt appears that his most extensive and ambitious work are the (incomplete) Eclogues (1938-1944), fashioned after the style of Virgil’s famous series and anything but bucolic. Since Hungarian is even more “Greek” to me than Greek itself (if you are familiar with the old saying), I have no idea if it is written in dactylic hexameter. I can see that dialogues and narrative poems alternate (mostly), and if I were more familiar with Virgil’s Eclogues(**) I expect I would see a richly entwining set of allusions. But instead I see that the war infuses the Eclogues from the very first one, a dialogue between a “shepherd” and a poet, which is about that warm-up to the Second World War, the Civil War in Spain and the death of Federico Garcia Lorca.\n\nFor those who might wonder why he would continue writing under such inhuman circumstances, I close with the following excerpt from the Second Eclogue, a dialogue between a fighter pilot and a poet.(***)\n\nI wrote; what else can I do? The poet writes, the cat\n\nmeows, the hound-dog howls, and the little female sprat\n\ndeposits its roe flirtatiously. I write down everything\n\nperhaps for you, so you’ll know, up there, how I cling\n\nto life, when the blood-veined moon’s light lurches between\n\nthe rows of houses exploding and leaning in,\n\nand the Squares all buckling, absolutely terrified;\n\nthe breath stops, and even the sky feels nauseous inside,\n\nand the aircraft keep coming, fly out of sight, come again, like\n\nthe drone of insanity, and again all goes down that they strike!\n\ntranslated by John M. Ridland and Peter V. Czipott\n\n(*) Just consider Joseph Roth’s first novel, Das Spinnennetz, written in 1923 before Hitler’s failed Munich Putsch, where he clearly anticipated the threat to Germany of the rising black and brown tide. I tell you frankly, we are one election away from the three greatest Powers on the planet being ruled by autocrats. If Trump or one of his ilk wins in 2024, I do not expect to experience another free election in my lifetime. This state of affairs can already begin if the Republican Party takes back the Congress next month. Can you imagine Ukraine’s fate if Trump were President now? And what do you think awaits Europe when it is caught between a triumphant Trump released from his Constitutional restraints and a vengeful Putin freed from Biden’s lash? Do you think you will be able to stop all the black and brown cockroaches darting out of the walls by yourselves?\n\n(**) I’m afraid that when I read them quite a while ago I didn’t particularly enjoy them and so haven’t picked them up again in order to deepen my appreciation. At this point I see that I would also have deepened my appreciation of Radnóti’s version, which I have enjoyed reading.\n\n(***) By the way, two books provided me with this look into Radnóti’s life and work: Eclogues and Other Poems (2015), translated by Jack Roberts, and All That Still Matters At All (2013), translated by John M. Ridland and Peter V. Czipott. Both volumes are bilingual; the latter collection offers a more generous selection. Though I cannot speak to the accuracy of the translations, the versions of the poems common to both books do not disagree on their meanings. I enjoyed both volumes greatly, if one can use the word “enjoy” when speaking of such stark subject matter.\n\n« L’enfer c’est les autres »: The most famous line in Jean-Paul Sartre’s (1905-1980) most famous play, Huis Clos, written in the Autumn of 1943 and premiered on May 27, 1944, at the Vieux Colombier Theater in Paris. When I read this play (in translation then) a half-century ago (I kid you not), I was fully in the throes of my Sartre idolatry and read everything I could get my hands on. After all, a politically engaged philosopher who could write novels and plays – how I admired him! (Even though I was firmly set on entering a career of the purest science.) And his basic philosophy of creating one’s own values and self against the Regard of the others – how that appealed to the insecure, energetic, yet-forming youth just then active in George McGovern’s futile campaign against the then Devil, Richard Nixon, and his “secret plan” to end the war in Vietnam.(*)\n\nThough I have moderated my view of Sartre since then, I have never joined the ranks of those who condemned his politics, his philosophy and his literature to the poubelles of history. Indeed, I am re-reading his plays now, again, and enjoying myself greatly. Looking over my GR reviews I note that I haven’t yet published a review of Huis Clos, an oversight to be remedied forthwith.\n\nSince it is so famous (infamous in some circles), I expect everyone knows that it is about three dead people (they agree to use the euphemism “absent” early in the play) in Hell. But this Hell isn’t the arcanely elaborate Inferno of Dante – it is simply a Second Empire salon in which three strangers find themselves for the rest of eternity. This astonishing fact is only slowly revealed to the reader (or viewer). In this Hell there is no sleeping, no drinking, no eating, no nothing except a few pieces of furniture and the other two people in the room with the occasional appearance of what Sartre ironically calls a garçon d’étage. There are also no physical torments, aside from the rather elevated temperature in the room. Hence, “L’enfer c’est les autres”.(**)\n\nThat, as it turns out, is more than enough as they slowly warm to slicing each other up verbally (and, at one point, literally, though that was, of course, quite futile) and obliging each other to reveal their most shameful secrets. An Existentialist Jerry Springer Show!\n\nI joke (partly), but that is because Sartre’s mordant humor throughout this play naturally inclines me to; it is bitterly funny. And it is bitterly hopeless: after a frenetic rise to a climax of mutual excoriation and despairing laughter as they realize this is the way it will be for the rest of time, there is a shocked pause as they eye each other. One rises and says “Eh bien, continuons.” What a stunning ending!\n\nI found a most interesting article by Ingrid Galster(***), in which she provides a great deal of context and back story for the composition, performance and reception of this play and Les Mouches. You might be interested in some of the most salient points.\n\nApparently, Huis Clos was written to provide two unemployed friends with something to do: the husband of one of them proposed to finance a tour of the play through Vichy France (the Germans occupied the northern half and left the southern half to their Vichy lackeys, at least until D-Day). Though the German censors were primarily concerned with political matters, the Vichy censors were more concerned with (very Catholic) moral matters. Deciding to prod the Vichy government at its most sensitive point, Sartre selected his three “guests” of Hell to be a lesbian who “needs the suffering of others to exist”; a serial adulterer and deserter who loved to torment his faithful and loving wife; and an adulteress who killed her baby in front of its father, her illicit lover. These truths are only slowly revealed as the characters initially dissemble mightily their natures.\n\nThe original project collapsed when the wife of the financier (and one of the stars of the show) was arrested during a raid on the home of a member of the Resistance. So real life took a cue from the play’s deeply set ironies: the Germans had no objections to the play (Nazi morals being just a bit tenuous), and it premiered in Paris. The French fascists made a huge scandal, but before they could make any headway in their attempt to ban the show, a little disturbance on the Normandy coast very early on the morning of June 6, just over a week after the premiere, re-aligned their priorities… When the Allies rolled into Paris a few months later, Jean-Paul Sartre was with Les Mouches and Huis Clos the star of the French theatre.\n\nMany plays only come to life on stage, but this one reads very, very well. It reads so well on the page that I have never even bothered to see a performance.\n\n(*) Oh how Nixon pales beside the orangely-glowing orangutan pulling his vindictive strings in Mar-a-Lago!!\n\n(**) In a much later interview Sartre revisited the significance of this line:\n\n« “ L’enfer c’est les autres ” a été toujours mal compris. On a cru que je voulais dire par là que nos rapports avec les autres étaient toujours empoisonnés, que c’était toujours des rapports infernaux. Or, c’est tout autre chose que je veux dire. Je veux dire que si les rapports avec autrui sont tordus, viciés, alors l’autre ne peut être que l’enfer. Pourquoi ? Parce que les autres sont, au fond, ce qu’il y a de plus important en nous-mêmes, pour notre propre connaissance de nous-mêmes. Quand nous pensons sur nous, quand nous essayons de nous connaître, au fond nous usons des connaissances que les autres ont déjà sur nous, nous nous jugeons avec les moyens que les autres ont, nous ont donné, de nous juger. Quoi que je dise sur moi, toujours le jugement d’autrui entre dedans. Quoi que je sente de moi, le jugement d’autrui entre dedans. Ce qui veut dire que, si mes rapports sont mauvais, je me mets dans la totale dépendance d’autrui et alors, en effet, je suis en enfer. Et il existe une quantité de gens dans le monde qui sont en enfer parce qu’ils dépendent trop du jugement d’autrui. Mais cela ne veut nullement dire qu’on ne puisse avoir d’autres rapports avec les autres, ça marque simplement l’importance capitale de tous les autres pour chacun de nous. »\n\n— Sartre, Entrevue avec Moshé Naïm, 1964\n\n(***) « Le théâtre de Sartre devant la censure (1943-1944) », Cahiers de l’Association internationale des études francaises,‎ 2010, p. 395-418\n\nI’ve had a particular interest in the Late Roman Empire for over a decade now – partly motivated by my sense that the Euro-American Empire is itself stumbling towards its demise, a process that has only been accelerating since 2016 – and because the without a doubt most engaging and, in some passages, actually exciting text on the subject was written by a witness, Ammianus Marcellinus (ca. CE 333 – ca. 400), towards the end of the 4th century. Generally referred to as the Res Gestae, only the last eighteen of thirty-one books have survived to our day, but precisely those eighteen books cover 26 years that overlap with Ammianus’ adult life and treat events at which he was either present or could find living witnesses to question at length. So, with the disappearance of the volumes covering CE 96 – 352, the text we have before us closely compares with Thucydides’ remarkable contemporary history of the Peloponnesian War.\n\nThough Edward Gibbon had some reservations about his style (“the vices of his style, the disorder and perplexity of his narrative”, “his love of ambitious ornaments [that] frequently betrayed him into an unnatural vehemence of expression”), he recognized Ammianus as an “accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices which usually affect the mind of a contemporary” as he wrote his chapters on the Roman Empire in the 4th century. Ernest Stein declared him to be the greatest literary genius the world had seen between Tacitus and Dante.\n\nAs I already pointed out in my reviews of Ammianus’ text(*), Ammianus was born into a high ranking family in Antioch(**) – the third city of the Empire after Rome and Alexandria – and was taken into the Emperor’s personal guard – the protectores domestici – as a teenager, probably because his father was an officer of the guard. He was taken under the wing of Ursicinus, the magister equitum orientalis (the commander of all the cavalry in the eastern Empire), and personally witnessed the future emperor Julian’s rise in Gaul and later participated in the then emperor’s ill-fated Persian campaign. Though his mother tongue was Greek, Ammianus wrote his history in Latin; purportedly, the text is shot through with Graecisms (indeed, an entire book is dedicated to the topic!), but however it may read in the original, even the rather stolid German translation(***) I read had me on the edge of my seat whenever Ammianus was reporting his own experiences, particularly his multiple brushes with death in Mesopotamia. Indeed, five years after finishing the text many of his masterfully evoked images remain crystal clear in my mind’s eye.\n\nShortly after finishing Res Gestae I resolved to read John Matthews’ (literally) weighty The Roman Empire of Ammianus (1989), but distracted by so many other competing texts I finally read the book in these first weeks of 2021.\n\nMatthews offers a detailed investigation of the text, the author and his historical milieu that extends, corrects and tempers, while trying to resolve lacunae and contradictions in Ammianus’ narration and discursive asides. In the first part Matthews does this while reading the text chronologically and expanding upon it in varied response to its changing foci, with the exception of Chapter 7, where he describes the competing schools of Neo-Platonism – the “philosophical” represented by Plotinus and the “theurgical” upheld by Iamblichus – and Julian’s unfortunate adherence to the latter, material tacitly assumed by Ammianus throughout his history. Notable here is the conflict that ensued between the traditional haruspices – the official omen readers of the Roman culture – and the theurges who accompanied Julian everywhere he went. On a number of occasions during the Persian campaign the haruspices advised Julian against continuing, in particular on the morning of Julian’s demise. The theurges and Julian believed that their rites had the power to force the gods to their will. That evening the theurges were instead gathered at Julian’s deathbed meditating upon the immortality of the soul.\n\nAmmianus himself was a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, upper-class Roman, so was neither a Christian nor followed Julian’s inclinations to magical Platonism. In fact, he was critical both of Julian (“superstitious, rather than a legitimate observer of divine matters”) and his predecessor, the Christian Constantius, whose obsessive concern with the theological disputes of the early Christian church he found to be “old woman’s superstition”. He disapproved of Julian’s law forbidding Christians to teach Greek culture, particularly philosophy, but did not mention the “martyrs” Christian apologists ascribed to Julian’s responsibility after his death when they mixed truth with calumny in an early example of “canceling”.\n\nIn the second part, Matthews continues this thematic, rather than chronological approach. Among the topics covered in these more topically organized chapters are a presentation and assessment of Ammianus’ views of the qualities of a good emperor and to which degree the emperors covered in his history manifested same; a discussion of the political structure and function of the empire; and the physical setting and social structure of the empire. The longest chapter of the book is “Barbarians and Bandits”, a generous discussion, with much added literary and archaeological material, of the “barbarians” most fully treated by Ammianus: the Alemanni and Goths, Huns and Alans, Saracens, Isaurians and Moors. In the last two chapters Matthews turns to an analysis of what Ammianus’ text reveals about his own viewpoint on religion and philosophy, on the one hand, and on historiography, on the other, and argues that despite the choice of language of composition of his history and his likely choice to have set its beginning where Tacitus left off, Ammianus placed himself primarily in the tradition of Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius and Cassio Dio rather than in the Roman tradition, for multiple reasons including the “need to place a narrative in nothing less than its entire geographical and cultural context.”\n\n(*) These I have recently posted here in WordPress.\n\n(**) That, in any case, is the most wide-spread view; G.W. Bowersock has mounted a cogent argument for Alexandria as Ammianus’ birthplace.\n\n(***) As I don’t read Latin; the Loeb library translation is clumsy and, according to experts, unreliable; the Penguin Classics translation is an abridgement; and the Landmark edition has been progressing at a snail’s pace for at least the last six years, I read a complete and reliable translation in German.\n\nLionel Gossman is a (now emeritus) professor of Romance languages and literatures at Princeton, so one would not expect him to produce a 600 page history of the second city in the German speaking portion of Switzerland. Not only are most of the sources in German, but historians have a professional preparation which goes well beyond learning historical facts. Nonetheless, Basel in the Age of Burckhardt is, in my view, a very professional piece of historical work, and it is evident from the lengthy endnotes and bibliography that he did a good deal of original grunt work modern historians must do – he does not merely summarize the work of other historians.\n\nThe book is primarily a history of ideas in Basel in the late 19th century (along the lines of Carl Schorske’s excellent book on Vienna), with particular focus on the historian/journalist/newspaper editor Jacob Burckhardt and the jurist/judge/anthropologist/historian/classical philologist Johann Jakob Bachofen. As he explains, Gossman initially intended to treat Friedrich Nietzsche and the theologian Franz Overbeck in equal detail, but the book grew out of bounds, so the latter two are discussed much more briefly in a single chapter. One of the primary tasks this book sets itself is to demonstrate how the thought of Bachofen and Burckhardt was influenced by and reflected the specific milieu into which they were born. Mission accomplished, Lionel.\n\nGossman really dug into the historian’s task and provided an overview of Basel’s social, economic and political development from the 15th century to the end of the 19th and great detail about the founding and history of the University of Basel, where all four main characters were professors. In the process the reader learns much about the economic and political evolution of the entire Rhine valley, as well as the history of Switzerland in general. The many notes and references have (unfortunately) drawn my attention to a huge number of books I’d like to read. This background material constitutes the first one-fourth of the text.\n\nThe second fourth is dedicated to Bachofen (1815–1887), not exactly a household name. He (like Burckhardt) was born into the interbred oligarchy running Basel and was extremely wealthy. Intellectually, Bachofen was in the second (or third?) generation of anti-Enlightenment-rationalism “historicists”, whose worldview has been described as “reverence for the old, the ancestral, the product of organic evolution; sympathy for the truly popular, for tradition and national culture; recognition of the privilege of everything that has developed organically or has come to be historically over what has been artificially constructed; preference for the authentic and the original; love of the individual and particular; delight in diversity and plurality.”\n\nAs a jurist and professor of law at the University of Basel, Bachofen “opposed the natural law theories of the Enlightenment and denied both the need and the possibility of a codification of German civil law…” To his teacher and one of the leaders of this historicist school, Friedrich Karl von Savigny, “a rationally grounded code of law was an impossibility, since law is an organic historical development and, like language, custom and political constitution, an integral part of a people.” Because Bachofen remained close to Savigny for life and interacted with the leading proponents of Savigny’s views across Europe, the reader is afforded a glimpse into the ideas and activities of a circle of influential men.\n\nBut Bachofen is remembered primarily as a theorist of primitive societies and matriarchy, as the coiner of the notion of Mutterrecht, and as an historian of ancient Greece and Rome, where instead of 5th century Athens and late Republican/Imperial Rome he was drawn to Argos and Mycenae, respectively the origins of Rome. In the former role he interacted with the founders of anthropology, but Gossman left me with no idea of the significance of that interaction. However, it does seem from the internet that some feminists refer to Bachofen with respect. (Certainly, he was full of praise for his idealized matriarchy.) In the latter role he, well before Nietzsche, vituperated against the historians and philologists who used “critical” methods in their study of Greco-Roman times; moreover, he wrote some books about Greco-Roman history and culture I now want to read. Although Gossman tells me that Bachofen was widely read for nearly a century, it appears that is no longer the case; getting my hands on Bachofen’s Griechische Reise is clearly going to be difficult.\n\nThough Bachofen was mildly reformist as a young man, the revolutions of 1848 assured that he was stock conservative for the second half of his life (he even inveighed against critics of superstition, because he felt that convincing the “simple folk” that their superstitions were unfounded was just a step away from convincing them that their religion – Bachofen was a Calvinist – was unfounded). Capitalism, revolution and democracy were all signs of decay for him. Nonetheless, he perceived very clearly and wrote against the reactionary consequences of the uprisings of ’48, and he despised the “robber state” of Prussia.\n\nJacob Burckhardt (1818-1897) is surely better known. A few of his books are still read by nonspecialists and are in print. Burckhardt and Bachofen have a great deal in common, Romantic elitists to the core, stricken by the ’48 revolutions and clamoring against materialism, socialism, triumphant progressivism and optimism; but Burckhardt rejected Christianity (Bachofen’s fervent Christianity informs all of his writings) holding onto a notion of the divine, and, because he had a model before his eyes in a former teacher and lifelong friend, he refused to let disappointments and setbacks make himself bitter and withdraw, as did Bachofen.\n\nLike Bachofen and Nietzsche, Burckhardt depised the professional academic cliques and specialization. After he returned to the University of Basel in 1858, he effectively stopped writing for publication, concentrating instead on his lectures and his public speaking series (a tradition in Basel). Most of his books were cobbled together posthumously from his lecture notes; over 100 pages of this book are given over to a discussion of these books. According to Gossman, it is Burckhardt’s correspondence which is “perhaps his masterpiece.”\n\nNowhere is the writing more lively, the language more racy and concrete, the imagination more rich and inventive, the wit sharper, or the observation more keen than in these texts intended for a privileged and intimate audience.\n\nThis is something to be looked into. As I plan to read/re-read a number of Burckhardt’s books, I won’t lengthen this review any further in this regard.\n\nMost of the second half of this book is dedicated to Burckhardt, but there is a brief chapter on Nietzsche and Overbeck. Since I have written much about Nietzsche recently, and shall do so again in the near future, let me turn to Franz Camille Overbeck (1837-1905), the theologian and church historian.\n\nAs did Bachofen, Burckhardt and Nietzsche in philology, history and philosophy, Overbeck did in theology: he wrote vociferously against the prevailing currents. He was a nonbelieving theologian, a scholar and critic. Nevertheless, he wrote against the liberal theology then dominant in Germany, which was performing cartwheels in order to accommodate the contradictions between Christianity and the modern world. But the Pietists and orthodox Calvinists did not find much satisfaction, for Overbeck challenged all theology (an interesting position for a professor of theology) and “the very possibility of reconciling authentic Christianity with authentic modernity.” But Gossman offers little of Overbeck’s thought in this book.\n\nGossman closes the book by making the case that the four were much more than eccentric contrarians; they were the primary counterpole in the German speaking world to the dominant German school of historiography/political philosophy which provided the ideology for the second and then the third Reich. This was even explicitly recognized by a Nazi historian, Christoph Steding, who in 1938 published a 770 page diatribe against the Baslers, Das Reich und die Krankheit der europaeischen Kultur. It was also recognized by Friedrich Meinecke, the last great representative of that dominant school, who slowly went from tolerance of a minority position in 1906 to quasi-conversion in 1946.\n\nAll four Baslers saw the alliance of power and culture as a threat to genuine culture. And we have seen the laboratory of actual history confirm their fears to a degree they surely could not have anticipated…\n\nBachofen, Burckhardt, Overbeck and Nietzsche lamented “the disappearance of individuality and the banalization of moral and intellectual life under modern democracy and the modern centralized state.” What would they say to our nearly global culture of uniformizing consumerism and video games, not to mention communication reduced to texting and tweeting?\n\nWith Benjamin Constant I affirm “La variété, c’est la vie, l’uniformité, c’est la mort.”\n\nWhile Basel in the Age of Burckhardt may not be of general interest, those with an interest in 19th century thought or an interest in the Confoederatio Helvetica will certainly find this well written book worth reading.\n\nConstantine the Great\n\nThe Roman Empire and its neighbors during the third and fourth centuries of our era, with an emphasis on the half century from the rise of Diocletian to the death of Constantine – such is the general topic of Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen (1853), which was the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt’s (1818-1897) first major work and one of the relatively few books he published before renouncing the writing of books for publication altogether.(*) Early though the book was in his career, his inimitable prose style is already present, as is the (then) idiosyncratic view of history Burckhardt had already developed.\n\nUnlike most historians at that time,(**) Burckhardt did not focus on “great men” and “important events,” which he saw as exceptional one-offs no science of history could incorporate (only record), but rather on the matters he viewed as amenable to a science of history – culture in the broadest sense, including social and economic relations.\n\nNonetheless, Burckhardt did not avoid the discussion of great men and important events. Indeed, Diocletian and Constantine the “Great” come in for a lot of attention in this text, though Burckhardt’s primary interest in Diocletian is his unique attempt to solve the recurring problem of how to replace an emperor without an empire-convulsing period of warfare between rival pretendants to the throne and musing on how Diocletian was able to keep his co-rulers in line, even convincing his co-emperor Maximian to retire with him after their 20 year co-rule. (Constantine put a quick end to Diocletian’s idea, but more about him later.) Otherwise, Diocletian is portrayed as a particularly successful exemplar of a long string of former generals made emperor by their essentially private armies. Burckhardt’s real focus is on which structural aspects of third century Roman politics/power centers made this chain of emperor/generals possible.\n\nAlongside this focus on political/social/cultural structures instead of on individuals/events, Burckhardt’s discursive style admits extended passages revealing what was then known about social, political, economic and cultural life in the major Roman provinces in the third and fourth centuries (Burckhardt holds that the city of Rome’s political, economic and cultural significance was minimal at this time, when the rulers had their residences in York, Trier, Split, Antioch, etc., the Senate was toothless, and the armies were no longer raised on the Italian peninsula but in the provinces, often among the newly re-settled “barbarians”), and even a little of the same about the Empire’s neighbors. The sections on Egypt were particularly fascinating.\n\nModel reconstruction of Diocletian’s palace in Spalato (now Split, Croatia); portions are still standing today.\n\nBurckhardt examines at length the evidence for the state of Greco-Roman religion and concludes that the life had gone out of the old beliefs, that philosophy had placed the gods to the side to endlessly regard their own perfection or had abstracted them away altogether, that Greco-Roman mythology had been reduced to a conventional ornament for art and literature, that serious drama had disappeared leaving only the crudest kinds of comedies and farces, and that a syncretism consisting primarily of religions and superstitions originally to be found in the North African and Near Eastern provinces, as well as Persia, occupied the spiritual energies of the Roman people. Christianity was just one of these, but Burckhardt argues that it had the advantage of promising a very simple way to eternal bliss, whereas its competitors required more complicated exertions to attain their heavens.(***)\n\nA particularly striking example of this syncretism was provided by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (now better known as Heliogabalus), who was a priest of Elagabalus, an aspect of the Semitic god Baal. He had Jupiter replaced by Elagabalus in the official pantheon, had the huge slab of black stone which was the god’s manifestation brought from Emesa, built him an enormous temple in the center of Rome, then brought the corresponding relics of the Isis/Astarte/Venus/Demeter/Urania goddess(4*) from Carthage and married the two gods in an elaborate ceremony. He even moved the Ur-Roman fire of Vesta into the new temple of Baal and Isis. Apparently, this was a bit too syncretic for some – the priestly emperor was murdered and the stone shipped back to Syria.(5*)\n\nBut to return to the promise of immortality, Burckhardt argues at length that the Greco-Roman view of an afterlife as joyless shadows in Hades with a few heroic exceptions on the Isle of the Blessed had changed during the crises of the third century into an obsession with “the other side.” Increasingly, “real life” was moved from the here and now to a blissful afterlife that was not part of the traditional religion but was an important component of the Eastern religions pouring into Rome. Interestingly, Burckhardt portrays Neo-Platonism as a symptom of this shift in the Zeitgeist. In fact, with the exception of Plotinus and Porphyrius, he sees Neo-Platonists in the third and fourth centuries as fabulists and frauds occupied with magic and demonology.\n\nThere is so much else packed into this book, including an insightful overview of all aspects of late imperial art and literature and an examination of what could have brought Diocletian in the eighteenth year of his reign to let loose a terrible scourge against the Christians, but I must try to end this review. So let me say a few words about the eponymous figure, Constantine.\n\nIn direct opposition to the picture drawn in hagiographies of Constantine by Eusebius (whom Burckhardt calls der widerlichste aller Lobredner – the most repulsive of all panegyrists; later he calls Eusebius the first throughly dishonest history writer of ancient times) and other Christian propagandists, Burckhardt’s Constantine is an unprincipled opportunist with one purpose in mind: sich und seine Herrschaft zu behaupten – to assert/maintain himself and his rule. When his father, who had moved up to Imperator Augustus when Diocletian and Maximian retired, died in York, his army declared Constantine Augustus. This was the beginning of a typically complicated and lengthy civil war out of which Constantine emerged as last man standing, and in the process of which he turned on his ally and brother-in-law, Licinius. All of the contenders and their families were killed, including the widow and daughter of Diocletian, who himself committed suicide rather than respond to a probably fatal summons from Constantine and Licinius. Such was his thanks for giving up the reins of power. A few years after the end of the civil war, Constantine had his own son, Crispus, and his own wife, Fausta, killed. So it could hardly startle that he also had his sister’s eleven year old son killed. But do let Burckhardt tell you the story of a ruthless man without any hint of moral conscience. It makes quite a contrast with the received notions.\n\nAt Constantine’s death another bitter civil war erupted in which the rest of his family killed each other and a significant percentage of the empire’s population, leaving one son, the new emperor, Constantius, and the young nephew, Julian, who was the last in Constantine’s line. Now he is an emperor who greatly interests me…\n\nThis lively and richly detailed picture of the late Roman Empire has replaced Burkhardt’s classic on the European Renaissance as my favorite book from his hand. Be sure to read the second, corrected and expanded edition first published in 1880. The large-format, beautifully printed edition I read, published by Phaidon-Verlag (Vienna) in 1935, is particularly generously provided with 200 full-page illustrations. This enrichment is quite likely unique to this edition.\n\n(*) This book has been translated into English under the title The Age of Constantine the Great. I discuss this renunciation in my review of Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen, which is one of the posthumous paste-ups Burckhardt’s executor put together.\n\n(**) There do seem to be more exceptions now than then – in fact, there are entire schools of such exceptions now – but these seem to be restricted to the academic ghetto.\n\n(***) Burckhardt makes the case that the Romans viewed the monotheisms like Christianity and Judaism or dualisms like Zoroastrianism as too foreign to readily incorporate into their syncretism. Judaism and Zoroastrianism held themselves strictly apart from the melting pot, while Christianity was busy digesting large chunks of Neo-Platonism as it became increasingly sophisticated (and hierarchical).\n\n(4*) The second century Syrian-Greek Lucian of Samosata wrote a biting satire, Of the Syrian Goddess, about the worship of the Syrian version of this goddess. An equal opportunity heretic, Lucian did a number on the entire Greco-Roman pantheon in his satires. Curiously, the Romans (via the Greeks) had much earlier incorporated another version of this goddess – Cybele, magna mater – into their pantheon. The same is true of the worship of Isis, which was known in Rome since the times of Sulla. But the Roman people wanted a version that was not domesticized, that was still surrounded by the trappings of the “mystical East” (which, often enough, included drunken orgies, quite thoroughly excluded in the domesticized Cybele and Isis cults).\n\n(5*) Supposedly the young emperor had a real gift for causing outrage – it is reported that he prostituted himself in the imperial palace, but it is probable that many of the stories told about the young man are slanders used to justify his murder. One cannot be sure exactly why he was murdered at the ripe old age of eighteen.\n\nReflections on World History\n\nShortly after Jacob Burckhardt (1818-1897) returned from the ETH in Zürich to the University of Basel, he stopped writing books for publication. He gave a number of reasons for this, but the primary was that he wanted to decouple himself entirely from the world of professional historians. He was unhappy with the development of academic history in the German speaking world away from the neo-humanism of Herder and Goethe (of which he approved) to the worship of the notion of state evinced by the apologists for the second German empire (which he detested). So he stopped writing for professional journals, refused all invitations to lecture at other universities, declined all offers of professorships (including the offer to be Ranke’s successor at the University of Berlin – by far the most prestigious academic position for a historian in the German speaking world). And he stopped writing books, for publishing books would generate criticism from professional historians which he would feel obliged to answer, thereby ensnaring him in a dialogue he refused to entame. He wrote only for his courses and for the public lecture series which were part of the cultural tradition in Basel. After his death, his nephew Jacob Oeri cobbled together books from his lecture notes.\n\nThe Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen (Reflections on World History) is one of these posthumous paste jobs and first appeared in 1905. Burckhardt’s biographer, Werner Kaegi (who wrote an interesting postscript to this edition), makes the point that Burckhardt would not have approved of the title. Burckhardt rejected the then current notions of universal history, of teleological and speculative history, and “Weltgeschichte” evokes precisely those connotations. Indeed, Burckhardt writes in the Introduction\n\nWir verzichten ferner auf alles Systematische; wir machen keinen Anspruch auf “weltgeschichtliche Ideen”, sondern begnügen uns mit Wahrnehmungen und geben Querdurchschnitte durch die Geschichte, und zwar in möglichst vielen Richtungen; wir geben vor allem keine Geschichtsphilosophie.\n\n(We further renounce all systematics; we pretend to no “world historical ideas”, but rather content ourselves with perceptions and give cross sections through history in as many directions as possible; above all, we give no philosophy of history.)\n\nBurckhardt also rejected Great Man history and the history of events, as he viewed both great men and events as highly singular and accidental – one-offs which may influence the course of history but are incapable of shedding light on the why’s of history. For Burckhardt, the heart of history was to be found in the (nearly) “constant, the typical, that which repeats itself.”\n\nThe text itself consists of six parts, of which three are foreign bodies. The introduction is a text written more than a decade before the lectures, and the last two parts were related talks Burckhardt gave in the public lecture series. Chapters 2 through 4 are taken from the lecture notes of one of his courses. What we have here is not a thematically unified book but something analogous to our contemporary collections of related journal articles well known academics can sometimes publish. Moreover, Burckhardt’s lecture notes, like those of most professors, are not written out completely – they consist often enough of fragments of sentences, quotes, keywords, etc. So Oeri completed the fragments, not Burckhardt.(*) Moreover, Oeri dropped some of the politically hot items shortly before publication; these were restored in the edition I’ve read.(**)\n\nDespite all this, Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen was heavily read (after World War I, and particularly after World War II), and it is still in print in many languages. As so often for books of history, much of this success had political, not intellectual, grounds (does the book tell a story that fits in with the dominant political opinions?). Burckhardt’s explicit warnings about the upcoming wars and the subservience of culture and religion to the state all came true to a degree even he could not have imagined. This kind of prescience must come from insights still of value for the future, no?\n\nThe sources of this prescience, insofar as they are revealed in this text, prove themselves to be a modest humanism girded with a powerful skepticism, yielding a clearsightedness which was still somewhat clouded (in my view) by 19th century idealism – the word “Geist” arises often, though Burckhardt explicitly rejects the boundlessly overblown “Weltgeist” Hegel fantasized about – and by a social and cultural conservatism that expressed itself as elitist and antidemocratic.\n\nIn Chapter 4 he discusses “historical crises,” including the advantages and disadvantages of war. Here he addresses his view of the Franco-German war of 1870/71 and predicts in this chapter and again in the last chapter a new series of European wars.\n\nIn Chapters 2 and 3 Burckhardt is primarily interested in the interactions and mutual influences of State, Religion and Culture – die drei Potenzen, as he calls them. In his view, the State and Religion are static, while Culture is mobile and developing. He begins by “defining” the three, which here means discussing in a very discursive manner some of the various forms each has taken. This taxonomy of states, religions and cultures seems deliberately tentative (and some of his remarks about non-European cultures raise my hackles). But he takes quite deliberate care to kick the 19th century in the shins as often as possible; like Nietzsche, he doesn’t seem to like anything about it.(***)\n\nThroughout the text Burckhardt wanders and digresses, throwing out interesting remarks right and left without supporting argument. But in some sections he focuses his mind and succeeds in doing more than intriguing (or annoying) the reader. I particularly appreciated the section entitled Zur geschichtlichen Betrachtung der Poesie, where he explains the historical significance and role of poetry.\n\nJust briefly, since this review is long despite all the remarks I’ve cut out, I’ll mention that in this curious Sammelsurium there is a chapter on the individual and greatness and another on happiness and unhappiness in world history… This is a very idiosyncratic book.\n\n(*) However, several of Burckhardt’s students have written approvingly of Oeri’s ability to recall for them Burckhardt’s manner of speech in lectures and private conversations.\n\n(**) This edition also signals other changes Oeri made in Burckhardt’s notes. By the way, the edition I read was published in the dtv-bibliothek in 1978.\n\n(***) He also exercises his ire on the American upper classes, who renounced history and reduced art and poetry to a luxury. What would he say now, when history is a filmed costume drama, poetry is an irrelevance, and art is a “longterm investment”?\n\nEmperor Julian\n\nOnce again, the Roman Empire in the 4th century; this time as seen by a contemporary witness.\n\nIn this review I report on the second of four volumes of the German edition of Ammianus Marcellinus’ history of the late Roman Empire I chose to read. For general background, information about English translations, and a discussion of the first volume, please see Römische Geschichte, Erster Teil.\n\n3. Volume 2: Books 18-21\n\nBook 17 ended ominously with the Persian King of Kings’ demand that the Romans return Armenia and Mesopotamia to Persian suzerainty. That wasn’t going to happen without a fight. Book 18 opens with further successful military actions of Caesar Julian against the Alemannic tribes east of the Rhine and with his efforts to reintroduce a just rule of law in Gaul and to rebuild and reprovision the cities and fortifications along the Rhine which had been destroyed, but most of Books 18 and 19 provide a first hand report of one season of the war with the Persians. For Ammianus was on the staff of the Roman supreme commander in the East, Ursicinus, and gives us in these Books one of his most gripping, detailed and extensive “I-passages,” as I shall briefly explain below.\n\nUrged on by a Roman deserter, the Persian Shah, Sapor, sent a large army across the Tigris into Roman territory, an army that at least partially disintegrated into roving bands of plunderers. For complicated reasons Ursicinus (who had just been relieved of command through an intrigue at Constantius’ court) and Ammianus rode into one of these bands unsuspectingly and then had to ride for their lives, having the kind of adventures told in the Flashman series (though these men were definitely not cowards). With too many side stories(*) to tell here, let me focus on the following story concerning events that occurred after the Romans withdrew to the west bank of the Euphrates.\n\nAfter an ambush by the Persians effectively destroyed the small troop under Ursicinus’ command, Ammianus barely made it back to the fortified town of Amida after further Flashman-like adventures. The Shah soon invested Amida with a large portion of his army, and the reader is treated to a very detailed account of a 4th century siege, including the Shah’s headwear when Ammianus saw him before the city from his vantage on the walls – a golden helmet in the shape of a ram’s head covered with precious gems. The Shah came too close and was almost struck by the barrage of missiles the Romans shot at him. Though his traitorous Roman adviser urged him to move around the city and continue further incountry, the Shah was outraged at the near misses and demanded that the city be taken and razed. The resolve of the Persians was fortified when the son of one of the Shah’s vassal kings was killed before the walls. (Ammianus describes the battle for the prince’s corpse and the seven day funerary rites.) His father swore not to leave the field until the city was burned. So the Shah concentrated all his troops there, including a corps of elephants, and a long and bloody struggle ensued.\n\nI have read eyewitness accounts of sieges of fortified cities before, but none from such ancient times and, above all, none anywhere near so detailed, including arguments among the Romans about which tactics to use at various critical moments. And I had no idea that 4th century siegecraft was so advanced – the Persians used every machine and means employed in the European Middle Ages before the introduction of gunpowder from China. Ammianus is full of respect for the Persians’ intelligence, resolve and bravery; the Shah, overcome by the martial spirit, is once again spotted in the front lines and narrowly escapes death.\n\nAfter seventy-three days of this, the numeric advantage of the Persians began to tell, and then an unfortunate circumstance(**) permitted the Persians entry to the city, where they began to kill everything that breathed. The night falling and the battle lost, Ammianus and two companions managed somehow to get out of the city and through the encircling army. This began another adventure as they crossed a desert and then mountains to get to a city still held by the Romans.\n\nThe oncoming winter put an end to the Persian campaign, and Ammianus turns to problems in the rest of the Empire at the end of Book 19. As if the reader hadn’t read enough adventures yet, he finds a detailed account of a near miss attempt by a Balkan tribe to lure Constantius to peace talks in order to attack and kill him. Constantius narrowly escaped, and the Romans wrought a terrible vengeance.\n\nBook 20 is full of strife; from Hadrian’s Wall to the Rhine and then to the Tigris the Empire is beset with armed conflict on the borders. Perhaps the most significant event in this Book is when Caesar Julian is proclaimed by his troops in Paris to be Augustus. Concerned by Julian’s successes and growing stature, Constantius commanded a large portion of Julian’s troops to be sent to the Near East in order to meet the Persians (and to weaken Julian). There he made a serious mistake, because the Gauls and Germans in Julian’s army were not willing to fight the Persians on the other side of the known world under any set of circumstances.\n\nIn the late Empire, when an army declared its general to be Emperor, one of the Emperors had to die. Julian tried to defuse the situation by making clear to Constantius that it was not his intent to replace him. The latter commanded Julian to be satisfied with the title Caesar, but again Julian’s troops forcefully insisted that he be recognized as co-Emperor. Though the preceding Books were full of stories of Constantius having high-standing Romans executed because of mere rumors that they might consider the possibility of maybe thinking about becoming Emperor, here Constantius backed down temporarily because the Persians were pushing hard again. His campaign against the Persians resulted in a draw this season.\n\nAnd in Book 21? What else? War. Julian defeated another Alemmanic king and then prepared for a civil war against Constantius. Most of the Book is given over to the military and political moves both Emperors made to bind parts of the Empire and various armies to them personally. Julian defeated the few armies that came against him, and turncoats and opportunists were crawling out of the woodwork. While Julian was fighting turncoats in the city of Aquileia at the head of the Adriatic, Constantius was moving westwards through Anatolia to confront him. However, Constantius died of a fever in a small town in Cilicia, sparing the Empire a more protracted and bloody civil war. Ammianus ends the Book with an examination of Constantius’ strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNow Julian is the last of Constantine’s line and the sole Emperor of the Romans. For a short time.\n\n(*) One of the many fascinating little side stories Ammianus tells us: During the initial confused contact with the Persians, Ammianus rode into a village empty of all but one soldier attempting to hide himself. After some extended questioning, this soldier confessed that he was born in Paris, had served in the Roman cavalry, but had gone over to the Persians (there were many deserters from both sides trying to maximize their personal advantage), where he had married a Persian woman and started a family. He had been sent back into Roman territory to spy and had unfortunately ended up in Ammianus’ hands. After telling Ammianus all that he knew about the Persians’ activities, his adventurous life came to a sudden end in that little Mesopotamian village – Ammianus had the Parisian executed.\n\nAlong with such stories, Ammianus also makes intriguing or surprising side remarks. For instance, he reports that when the Romans burnt the fields between the Tigris and the Euphrates to deny the grain to the Persians, many wild lions were caught in the fires, leading him to detail how blind lions were such a pest in that region.(!)\n\n(**) To overcome the advantage of the city walls, the Persians constructed ridges of earth higher than the walls themselves from which to fight. The Romans then built corresponding ridges of earth to counter that move. However, one of the Roman ridges collapsed forward across the wall, filling part of the moat and offering the Persians a way into the city.\n\nLate Roman mosaic from the Antioch area\n\nOnce again, the Roman Empire in the 4th century; this time as seen by a contemporary witness.\n\n1. General Background for all four volumes(*)\n\nWhile I was reading Jacob Burckhardt’s excellent cultural history of the 3rd and 4th century Roman Empire, Die Zeit Constantins des Großen, the names of two contemporary sources appeared again and again with Burckhardt’s approbation. One of these was Ammianus Marcellinus (ca. 333 – ca. 400), offspring of a family in the highest classes of nobility, already at 20 years of age in the personal guard of the Emperor, and high-ranking officer in campaigns in both Asia and Europe. Born and raised in Antioch – with Rome and Alexandria, one of the three largest cities in the empire – Ammianus’ native tongue was Greek, and though he was very well read in Latin literature, the translator and commentator of these four volumes, Wolfgang Seyfarth, asserts that Ammianus not infrequently violates Latin usage in ways that reveal he is trying to express Greek thoughts in a foreign tongue.\n\nNevertheless, Ammianus’ history is vivid, detailed and opinionated in a very engaging manner. What is more, he takes the unusual step of inserting lengthy “I-passages” – descriptions of his own personal experiences, particularly in the wars in Asia and Gaul – into the text, which add a touch rivalled only by Julius Caesar’s narratives. Though of Greek descent, Ammianus was an exemplary Roman and product of his elevated class: he was highly educated, believed unquestioningly in all the traditional Roman virtues, and therefore felt that family and service to the empire were the center of life. He also viewed the newer, upward striving arrivistes and philistine opportunists with deep disdain, which he freely displays again and again in his history.\n\nIntending his history to be a continuation of Tacitus’, Ammianus began with the year 96 and the ascent of Emperor Nerva to power and ended in the year 378 with the disastrous Roman defeat at the hands of the Goths outside of Adrianopolis. Unfortunately, the first thirteen books have been lost, though it might not be quite as great a loss as might first appear. In fact, the first thirteen books deal with the period 96-352, while the remaining 18 books cover the remaining 26 years. Though I wish we had at least Liber XIII, it is clear that Ammianus provided significantly more detail about the history of the empire during his own lifetime than he did for earlier times. In other words, it is likely that we have the choicest bits of his work; most of the rest is probably distilled from previously written histories.\n\nNo less than 11 of the extant books are devoted to 10 years of the life of Julian (the so-called Apostate), who is for me one of the most interesting figures of the late Roman Empire. Ammianus admired Julian greatly, both as a man and as an emperor, but he nonetheless criticized what he saw as Julian’s defects. As a deeply traditional Roman, Ammianus, too, was a “pagan;” however, he viewed Julian’s stance towards Christians as sometimes unnecessarily repressive. But more on Julian later.\n\nThough Ammianus had no understanding for the urban plebs (or often for those, like the Caesar Gallus, who tried to protect them from the upper classes, of which Ammianus was a proud member), he was disturbed by the increasing power of the Emperors now unchecked by the Senate and the senatorial class or the army – the classic checks in the early Empire.(**) As Burckhardt and Ammianus indicate, from Constantine onwards the only check on the Emperors was the Christian church, which, while feuding within itself for the power to settle theological matters and more worldly concerns, had left behind its origins as a kind of revolutionary movement of the little man and had become a strictly hierarchical entity that viewed a firm support of the Emperor as the best protection of its own interests. Though Ammianus wanted a return to the checks and balances provided by a noble and altruistic Senate, it is clear that he, like Tacitus, was pessimistic about this possibility and therefore about the future of the Empire.\n\nThe edition of Res gestae that I read consists of four volumes. Because of the exceptional nature of this text, I intend to say a few words about each in the subsequent reviews.\n\n2. Volume 1: Books 14 – 17\n\nBook 14 begins in media res during the civil wars Constantine’s son, Constantius, had to fight in order to stay on the imperial throne. Constantius wasn’t much better than his father when it came to killing relatives and other possible or actual rivals. Along with the intramural warfare and relatively minor problems with the Persians and Isaurians and larger problems with the Alemannic tribes, Ammianus occupies himself in Book 14 with demonstrating in great detail the degree to which the Senate and people of Rome had degenerated. In the 4th century, Rome had become politically insignificant and a great economic drain on the empire, since every registered citizen of Rome was fed and entertained at the cost of the rest of the empire. Ammianus’ description of the contemporary mores in Rome drips with vitriol and is sufficiently detailed to provide a real glimpse of life there. There is also a very interesting excursion about the nature and customs of the Arabic tribes at that time, with whom Ammianus had some personal experience. Indeed, there are too many interesting passages for me to mention. Just one more from Book 14, because it is representative of many similar passages: Due to his many connections with the aristocracy and the various imperial courts, Ammianus was able to obtain the story of the final voyage of Caesar Gallus in great and moving detail, where Constantius lured his cousin Gallus to his ignominious death. This kind of insider information gives a view of events that few ancient histories provide.(***)\n\nAfter a long excursus about the police state methods approved by the increasingly paranoid Constantius, the incompletely preserved Book 15 reports on the rise of Gallus’ younger brother, Julian, who barely escaped his brother’s fate. He, too, was the object of the envy and intrigue of the snakepit of opportunists which was the court of every absolute ruler, from China, Japan, Korea and imperial Rome to Stalin’s Kremlin. But a crisis in Gaul – among other things, Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Cologne) was invested and then destroyed by Germanic tribes – moved Constantius instead to declare Julian, his last remaining relative, Caesar and to send him off to fight the “barbarians.” Ammianus mentions that a persistent rumor held that Constantius hoped that the very young and inexperienced Julian would not survive the experience.\n\nThis Julian did, and quite successfully, as Ammianus describes in great detail in Books 16 and 17. He was still a member of the leading general Ursicinus’ military staff and witnessed some of the campaign himself. The rest was witnessed by fellow officers whom he knew personally. Julian’s actions and successes during this campaign brought Ammianus to believe that Julian was a late embodiment of all the old Roman virtues, sharing Cato’s spartan lifestyle, Titus’ cleverness, Trajan’s strategic insight, Antoninus Pius’ mercy and Marcus Aurelius’ drive for understanding. Aware that his presentation of Julian “approaches that of a panegyric,” Ammianus hastens to assure the reader that he is employing reliable witnesses.\n\nAfter the first year of the campaign in Gaul, trouble arose in Asia with the Persians and others; Ursicinus was posted back to Asia as the supreme commander and was again accompanied by Ammianus. Despite Ammianus’ absence from Europe, the details of the Gaul campaign become no fewer, with the reader being informed about strategy, tactics, logistics and politics. One side note: just as Julius Caesar did in his memoirs, Ammianus reports without blinking that as the Roman troops landed on islands in the Rhine held by the Alemanni, “they slaughtered, without making a distinction for gender or age, men and women like cattle.”\n\nAfter defeating the Franks, regaining Cologne and clearing the lower Rhine valley in the first year, in the next Julius defeated the Alemanni, regained Strasbourg and cleared both sides of the upper Rhine valley. Ammianus recreates the decisive battle outside of Strasbourg in such detail – even reporting on the history and character of some of the Alemanni leaders – that one feels one was there. With that victory ends Book 16. A large portion of Book 17 is occupied with Julian’s third campaign season, where most of the fighting takes place east of the Rhine, and the Germanic tribes are beaten into submission – for a while. However, part of Book 17 reports on Constantius’ campaigns in the Balkans, where the totally outclassed Balkan tribes were basically massacred. At the end of Book 17, the Persian king demands the return of Armenia and Mesopotamia…\n\n(*) Ammianus’ history, which has come down to us with the title Res gestae (or also Rerum Gestarum), is also available in a somewhat abridged Penguin edition and in a complete version as part of Harvard’s estimable Loeb series. (There are also English translations from earlier centuries, but I did not seriously consider them.) Since the first is abridged and the second is written in the usual stiff Loeb prose, I chose to read this complete and somewhat more felicitously expressed German edition (it is bilingual, like the Loeb), which also is provided with a very useful introduction and explanatory endnotes.\n\n(**) Oversimplifying, there was no “army,” only many, many armies, and the Emperors had learned how to prevent any one general from getting too powerful, as Ammianus illustrates again and again.\n\n(***) Which provides me with the opportunity to muse: Though the efforts made by Herodotus and Ammianus to get to the truth do not come up to the standards of our contemporary historians, they both made real exertions to find witnesses and, occasionally, documents for the events in question. But I am struck by the difference in their style. Herodotus’ style was that of a fabulist, of a storyteller – he told stories of wonder and moment – while Ammianus’ style is that of a novelist – he is interested in the motivation, emotion and intention of his main characters along with the events."
