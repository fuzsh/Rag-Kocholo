        "text": "(b. Göppingen, Germany, 30 September 1550; d. Tübingen, Germany, 20 October 1631)\n\nastronomy.\n\nEarthshine was correctly explained for the first time in print by Mästlin.1 He matriculated at Tübingen University on 3 December 1568 and received the B.A. (30 March 1569) and M.A. (1 August 1571) before entering the theological course.2 To his reprint of Erasmus Reinhold’s Prussian Table, Mästlin added a brief appendix in 1571, and his 1573 essay on the nova of 1572 was impressive enough to be incorporated in its entirety into the Progymnasmata of Tycho Brahe.3 Lacking observational instruments, Mästlin stretched a thread through the nova and two pairs of previously known stars. He took the celestial longitude and latitude of these four fixed points directly from the star catalog of Copernicus, of whose Revolutions he had acquired a copy in 1570. (Mästlin’s heavily annotated copy of the Revolutions is preserved at Schaffhausen, Switzerland.) The intersection of the arcs of the great circles passing through the two pairs of his reference stars gave Mästlin the position of the 1572 nova, and its nondisplacement from them convinced him that it was indeed a new star; thus, coming-into-being could occur in heaven as well as on earth, contrary to the traditional dogma.\n\nHaving served as the assistant to Philipp Apian (1531–1589), professor of mathematics at Tübingen, Mästlin replaced him when Apain went on leave in 1575. This arrangement was not renewed, however, for on 24 October 1576 Mästlin was appointed to a Lutheran pastorate in Backnang. In April 1577 he married Margaret Grüinger, who bore him three daughters and three sons.4 Ludwig became a physician after enrolling at Tübingen on 26 February 1594 and obtaining the B.A. on 5 April 1598 and the M.A. on 13 February 1600.5 In that year Michael, Jr., a painter, ran away from home and was later said to be hiding among the Jesuits.6 Margaret married Tobias Olbert (M. A., Tübingen, 15 February 1598) on 7 December 1602; Anna Maria also married a Lutheran clergyman, Johann Wolfgang Mügling; and Sabina married Burckhardt Rümelin, a Tübingen law student in 1606 and court attorney in 1624.7.\n\nMästlin was designated professor of mathematics at Heidelberg University on 19 November 1580.8 In discussing that year’s comet he declared that the unsoundness of the Aristotelian cosmology had been revealed to him by three great celestial events occurring over a period of eight years: the 1572 nova and the comets of 1577 and 1580.\n\nHaving failed to detect any perceptible parallax in the comet of 1577, Mästlin concluded that it was not a sublunar but, rather, a supralunar body. Remarking that “according to Abū Ma’shar, who flourished about A.D. 844, a comet was seen above the sphere of Venus,” he asked, “What would have been the physical cause of this [phenomenon], if we are to believe that comets have no place other than the region of the [four] elements?”9 Rejecting the conventional classification of comets as metrological phenomena, he located the comet of 1577 in the sphere of Venus.\n\nNevertheless, in his Epitome of Astronomy, an introductory textbook begun while he was still a student at Tübingen and so popular that it ran through seven editions between 1582 and 1624, Mästlin expounded the traditional view as easier for beginners to understand. He advised Protestant governments to reject the Gregorian calendar as a papal scheme to regain control over territories that had escaped from its grasp. All of his books and writings appeared on the Index of Pope Sixtus V in 1590.10\n\nIn a public address at Tübingen University on 22 September 1602,on the basis of his chronological researches Mätlin put Jesus’ birth more than four years before the conventional date.11 On 23 May 1584 he had replaced Apain, who had been dismissed for refusing to sign the oath of religious allegiance; he later bought Apian’s library from the latter’s widow.12 Mästlin, a man of slight build, unlike the massive ancestor from whom his surname was derived,13 was elected dean of the Tübingen Arts Faculty eight times between 1588 and 1629. He taught there for forty-seven years, until his death in 1631.\n\nHis first wife having died on 15 February 1588, on 28 January 1589 Mästiln married Margaret Burckhardt (19 March 1564–18 February 1622), who bore him nine children.14 Sabina, the second Mästlin daughter to bear this name, was buried on 9 July 1596, before attaining the age of seven, and a third Sabina was born on 22 June 1599.15 A Second Margaret, christened on 16 December 1604, died on 31 August 1609.16 Augustus, born on 13 January 1598, died on 16 February 1598.17 Anna Dorothea married a Lutheran clergyman, Andrew Osiander (M.A., Tüngen, 1610), in 1614.18 Gottfried, baptized on 12 October 1595, received his B.A. at Tübingen on 31 March 1612, his M.A. on 16 August 1615, and became a professor of languages there in 1627.19 Matthew acquired his B.A. at Tüingen on 17 March 1619 and the M.A. on 20 February 1622. He married on 24 November 1622; taught school at Gerlingen; and worked as a caretaker in Knittlingen, where he was buried on 6 February 1661.20\n\nIn his 1578 discussion of the comet of 1577, Mästlin announced his “adoption of the cosmology of Copernicus, truly the foremost astronomer since Ptolemy.” In 1632 Galileo attributed his acceptance of Copernicanism to two or three lectures, delivered shortly after he had completed his philosophy course, by a foreign professor whose identity (or very existence) in uncertain.21 Hence in 1650 Gerhard Johann Voss (1577–1649) posthumously initiated the legend—which has been uncritically repeated by influential writers for centuries—that the foreigner responsible for Galileo’s Copernicanism was Mästlin.22 The latter, however, was really responsible for the Copernicanim of Johannes Kepler, who attended Mästlin’s classroom lectures at Tübingen and heard him expound the superiority of the Copernican astronomy over the Ptolemaic.23 The pupil-teacher relationship between Kepler and Mästlin ripened into a lifelong affectionate friendship, each sincerely acknowledging the other’ valuable assistance. No finer example of the educational process at its best can be found in the entire history of science.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.

Zinner, Entstehung und Ausbreitung…, 435, no. 151); “Horologiorum solarium sciotericorum in superficiebus planis descriptionis et delineationis universalis informatio,” which, although it has been listed as a book printed at Tübingen in 1590, is actually an unpublished MS written by the hand of Gottfried Mästlin, dated 20 July 1613, and preserved in the library of Erlangen University: Katalog der Handschriften der Universitätsbibliothek Erlangen, Hans Fischer, ed., II (Erlangen, 1936), 485, no. 838; and “De cometa anni 1618” (Tübingen, 1619) or “Astronomischer Discurs, von dem Cometon, so in Anno 1618 im November zu erscheinen angefangen und bis Februar dies 1619.

The Latin original of this trans. into German by Matthew Beger was misattributed to Mästlin by J. C. Houzeau and Albert Lancaster, Bibliographie gènèrale de l’astronomie, I, pt. 1 (Brussels, 1887; repr. London, 1964), 603, where the work of Beger (miscalled Begern) is incorrectly listed as a translation of Mästlin’s Tres disputationes… Actually, Beger translated from Adriaan Metius’ Astronomiae universae institutiones (Franeker, 1606–1608) an excerpt in which Metius discussed Mästlin’s method of observing without the aid of any instruments.\n\nII.
