        "text": "Friederick Nietzsche foresaw his fate: ‘I know my fate…One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful – of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified. I am not a man, I am dynamite.’\n\nHis name has become inextricably associated with Hitler and the Nazis, as has that of his one-time great friend Richard Wagner. The association of the Nazis with Wagner is not wholly unjust as Wagner was a fervent German nationalist and strongly antisemitic. Nietzsche was neither of those things: indeed, he opposed both. He was also anti-war.\n\nHitler, who visited the shrine created for Nietzsche by his self-promoting sister, might have thought of himself as an Übermensch, a superman. But he was in most ways the opposite of how Nietzsche thought of the Übermensch –“as a man at peace with himself, finding joy in his earthly purpose, rejoicing in the sheer magnificence of existence and content with the finitude of his mortality.”\n\nAlthough I have read about Nietzsche’s philosophy, I too made the mistake of associating him to some degree with Hitler and the Nazis (and he was an inspiration for both), but after reading Sue Prideaux’s marvellous biography I know better.\n\nNietzsche was full of contradictions and is perhaps best thought of as “a tremendous stimulus to thought” rather than as a philosopher with a positive message, a lesson on how to live. A “philosopher of perhaps,” he was more interested to destroy ideas and fictions like god, science, and belief in progress. We cannot understand the world and we must find our own way to live.\n\n“Awareness of ourselves and awareness of the world around us both depend on the conception that we ultimately do not understand either ourselves or the world.”\n\n“No one can construct for you the bridge on which you must cross the stream of life, no one but you alone.”\n\nBorn in 1844 one of the most important events in Nietzsche’s life was his father dying of “brain softening” in his 30s when Nietzsche was five. He feared that he would also go mad; and he was left with his dim mother and clever but deluded sister. An indisputably brilliant man he went to a severe school, became a professor at 21, and fell under the spell of Wagner and his mistress, later wife, Cosima. Prideaux points out that Nietzsche in his writings quoted Wagner more often than Christ, Plato, or Goethe. The power of Wagner’s music entranced him as it has entranced many, but eventually he turned against Wagner.\n\nAfter fighting in the Franco-Prussian War, an experience that made him passionately anti-war, for much of his life he walked and wandered from country to country, often unwell, writing books. Many of these books he published himself, and he did not become famous until later in life—shortly before he went mad aged 45.\n\nHis experiences with women were not good. He wrote terrible things about them (“You go to women? Do not forget the whip!),” and was besotted with several but never married. “Two things a real man wants,” he wrote, “danger and play. That’s why he wants woman – the most dangerous plaything.” At age 21 he was taken to a brothel in Cologne, where scared he played the piano like a madman. But it may have been there that he may have caught syphilis, which may have been the cause of his madness (lots of mays in that sentence, you notice). Thomas Mann used the brothel incident in Dr Faustus, his novel about Nietzsche, as the moment when Faustus/Nietzsche made his bargain with the devil.\n\nAfter Nietzsche went mad he fell into the clutches of his sister, whom he had tried to disown. She exhibited him in a kind of shrine in Weimar and controlled his works, reputation, and legacy. She was an antisemitic, German nationalist, and an ardent supporter of both Mussolini and Hitler. She gave Hitler Nietzsche’s walking stick, and he attended her funeral in 1935. In a highly symbolic gesture she arranged for herself to displace Nietzsche in the centre of the family grave.\n\nNietzsche had another thought on how he might be remembered: “I have a terrible fear that one day I shall be pronounced ‘holy’. I do not want to be a saint, rather a buffoon … perhaps I am a buffoon.” He had a spell when some thought him a saint, and some these days will surely think him a buffoon. He might well agree that we are all buffoons, and as such should enjoy being so.\n\nI took many quotes from Prideaux’s book:\n\n‘All things considered, my youth would have been intolerable without Wagner’s music,’\n\n‘Absolute freedom of will would make man into a god; the fatalistic principle would make him into an automaton.’\n\nHere the ways of men divide. If you want to achieve peace of mind and happiness, then have faith; if you want to be a disciple of truth, then search.’\n\nHe headed the essay with the line from one of Pindar’s Pythian Odes that he would treasure all his life: ‘Become what you are, having learned what that is.’\n\nKant’s principle of the sublime; ‘a function of the extreme tension experienced by the mind in apprehending immensity and boundlessness, transcending every standard of sense and which rouses a sort of delightful horror, a sort of tranquillity tinged with terror which, accomplished through a transcendent scale of reference, a greatness comparable to itself alone … its effect is to throw the mind back upon itself – and thus we soon perceive that the sublime is not to be looked for in the things of nature but in our own ideas.’\n\nBurckhardt’s view that European culture was falling to a new barbarism in the form of capitalism, scientism and the centralisation of the state.\n\nBurckhardt believed in nothing, but saw this as no bar to behaving ethically. He heartily disliked the French Revolution, the United States, mass democracy, uniformity, industrialism, militarism and railways. Born in the same year as Karl Marx, Burckhardt was an anti-capitalist who raged against what he called ‘the whole power and money racket’, but he was also an anti-populist, a conservative pessimist who earnestly believed that the masses should be saved from themselves, particularly from their own inclination to enthrone mediocrity and to cheapen taste, bringing everything down to what he and Nietzsche agreed was the vulgarity and confusion of popular culture.\n\nRhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten. Plato. [Think Schubert and Led Zeppelin.]\n\nBan compromise and live resolutely in that which is whole, full and beautiful. Mazzini\n\nSocrates instigated the ‘unimaginable, universal greed for knowledge, stretching across most of the cultured world, and presenting itself as the true task for anyone of higher abilities. [Socrates] led science on to the high seas, from which it could never again be driven completely … for the first time, thanks to this universality, a common network of thought was stretched over the whole globe, with prospects of encompassing even the laws of the entire solar system.’ 3 People are held fast by the Socratic delusion that pleasure in understanding can heal the eternal wound of existence. ‘Anyone who has experienced the intense pleasure of a Socratic insight, and felt it spread out in ever-widening circles as it attempted to encompass the entire world of appearances, will forever feel there can be no sharper goad to life.’\n\nThere also exists the Dionysian, the Will. And so, ‘In this late period of Socratic culture, man … remains eternally hungry.’ Reduced to rationality, Alexandrian man is basically ‘a librarian and proof-reader, sacrificing his sight miserably to book-dust and [printing] errors’. 5 Is our flight into science and scientific proof perhaps a kind of fear, an escape from pessimism, a subtle, last resort against truth? Morally speaking, is it a sort of cowardice and falsity?\n\nThe problem of science must be faced. Science was a post-Socratic problem in Greece, Nietzsche observes, as it remains a problem in post-Darwinian Europe. By faith in the explicability of nature and in knowledge as a panacea, science annihilates myth. As a result, ‘We fall into a senile, unproductive love of existence.’\n\nOpera, in short, with its marriage of words and music presents the new tragic art form in which the Dionysian and Apollonian are the reunited.\n\nHe joined, in his words, the chlorotic and weak-nerved folk from all over the world as they shuffled around from spa to spa. He read medical and physiological texts voraciously and yet, for all the miracle cures he tried, and which he knew did him no good, it was the one area in which he suspended his analytical rigour. He was as credulous as a newspaper reader believing in horoscopes.\n\n[Nietzsche hated being] ‘photographically executed by the one-eyed Cyclops … I try, each time, to prevent the disaster, but the inevitable always occurs – and out I come, eternalised anew as a pirate or a prominent tenor or a boyar …’\n\n‘An aphorism, properly stamped and moulded, has not been “deciphered” when it has simply been read; rather, one then has to begin its exegesis.’\n\nVoltaire: ‘When the populace becomes involved in thinking, all is lost.’\n\n‘If you want to improve the people, give them better food instead of declamations against sin. Man is what he eats.’ Feuerbach\n\nLou Salome: “All her life, she preferred to live with two men at a time. She did, in fact, marry five years later but only because her suitor stabbed himself in the chest and threatened to finish the job if she refused. They remained married for forty-five years, devoted to each other throughout, though the marriage was never consumated and she was perfectly happy for the housekeeper to be her husband’s long-term mistress while Lou imported her own devoted admirers into the marriage.”\n\nHow could they cope with the unexpected and shocking proximity of god and beast? ‘There’, he concluded perspicaciously, ‘one has tied a psychic knot that may have no equal.’\n\nShe placed enormous importance on his illness as a creative source. He needed no flamboyance, no outward proof of genius, so long as he had his illness. It enabled him to live numberless lifetimes within the one.\n\n‘Falling ill through thoughts and recuperating through thoughts’; Lou had no doubt that ‘he is the cause of his own self-induced illness’.\n\nIn his next book he was to pursue the idea that all philosophy (not only his own) was autobiography.\n\nPhilosophy as I have understood and lived it, is voluntary living in ice and high mountains – a seeking after everything strange and questionable in existence, all that has hitherto been excommunicated by morality.\n\nWhat do we take for truth? The lofty edifices of European thinking. But they rest on the cornerstones of dogmatists who from time immemorial based their theories on a mixture of folk superstition – such as the superstition about souls – and some daring generalisations from very limited human, all-too-human, experiences.\n\nMan cannot live without such untruths. He cannot bear life without measuring reality by purely invented fictional systems such as philosophy, astrology and religion. These three monsters have roamed the earth through the ages, and we have shaped the architecture of our superstitious beliefs in their image. Man had originally been free, but he had bricked himself into beliefs, madly constructing Zoroastrian observatories, Greek and Roman temples, Egyptian tomb pyramids and Christian cathedrals. He chose to erect an architecture of fear and awe, whose very foundation is the terror that death might lead to nothing more than oblivion. We have enslaved ourselves to priests, astrologers and philosophers. Their influence is grievous, and dangerous to man’s psychology.\n\nAwareness of ourselves and awareness of the world around us both depend on the conception that we ultimately do not understand either ourselves or the world.\n\nHe made a list of the transfigural states that confirm our lust for life. It was headed by the sexual drive, after which came intoxication, meals and springtime.\n\n‘To greatness belongs dreadfulness: let no one be deceived about that.’\n\nThe little band of angry nationalists was composed of peasants, artisans and small tradesmen who felt left behind, their lives devalued by relentless industrial, economic, social and political progress. None was an artist or an intellectual.\n\nElisabeth’s talent for self-delusion was bottomless.\n\nMy ambition is to say in ten sentences what other people say in a book – what other people do not say in a book.\n\n‘I was born on October 15, 1844, on the battlefield of Lützen. The first name I heard was that of Gustavus Adolfus. 9 My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Niëzky) … Abroad I am usually taken for a Pole; this very winter the visitors’ list at Nice entered me comme Polonais [as Polish]. I am told my head occurs in Matejko’s pictures … In the winter of 1868– 1869 the University of Basel offered me a professorship; I was as yet not even a Doctor … From Easter 1869 to 1879 I was at Basel; I was obliged to give up my rights as a German subject, since as an officer (Horse Artillery) I should have been called up too frequently and my academic duties would have been interfered with. I am none the less master of two weapons, the sabre and the cannon … from the earliest days of my Basel existence an indescribably close intimacy sprang up between me and Richard and Cosima Wagner, who were then living on their estate of Tribschen, near Lucerne, as though on an island, and were cut off from all former ties. For some years we had everything, great and small, in common, a confidence without bounds … As a result of these relations I came to know a large circle of persons (and “personesses”), in fact pretty nearly everything that grows between Paris and Petersburg. By about 1876 my health became worse … till it reached such a climax of habitual suffering, that at that time, I had 200 days of torment in the year. The trouble must have been due entirely to local causes, there is no neuropathic basis for it of any sort. I have never had a symptom of mental disturbance; not even of fever, nor of fainting. My pulse was at that time as slow as that of the first Napoleon (= 60) … The report has been put about that I was in a madhouse (and indeed that I died there). Nothing is further from the truth … After all, my illness has been of the greatest use to me. It has released me; it has restored to me the courage to be myself … I am a brave animal, a military one even. Am I a philosopher, do you ask? – But what does that matter!’\n\n‘There attaches to my name a quantity of doom that is beyond telling.’\n\nIs man God’s mistake? Or is God man’s mistake?\n\nHow little is required for happiness! The sound of a bagpipe.\n\nThey acknowledge the fact that, however authors dress it up, autobiography is probably the most monstrous act of conceit that exists.\n\nHe would rather be a satyr than a saint. He would rather knock over idols than set them up.\n\nI have a terrible fear that one day I shall be pronounced ‘holy’. I do not want to be a saint, rather a buffoon … perhaps I am a buffoon.\n\nShipwrecked souls desperately seeking resolution between scepticism and a longing for peace, the generation clung to Nietzsche’s removal of meaning from its illusory position outside of life, replacing it back into life itself. They venerated Nietzsche as a truly free spirit, a solitary voice extolling individualism, offering an alternative both to the decline of faith and to the steady assault of science upon the anthropomorphic assumption of the human ego. Nietzsche had created for them the possibility of meaning as something completely personal rather than, as Johann Fichte put it, ‘a lifeless household item one can put aside or pick up as one wishes’. If faith was dead, philosophy remained worthwhile in its ability to justify the very soul of the person who adopted, and adapted, it.\n\nIt captured the zeitgeist as nothing else: Munch had produced the definitive icon of existential terror on contemplating the consequences of the death of God, and the subsequent responsibility of man to find meaning and significance to life.\n\nIt was the painterly equivalent of the powerful effect of the half-glimpsed, the suggestive quality of the aphorism that Nietzsche had first seized upon in Sorrento, and upon which he built the powerful and extraordinarily modern strategy of ‘the philosopher of perhaps’, a position which gave him the power to end an aphorism, a train of thought or even an entire book with an ellipsis, putting the reader in charge of the conclusion while, at the same time, acknowledging that objective truth is not even conceivable for humans, the striving for it mere illusion.\n\nTo take such a select crop of youth and energy and power and then to put it in front of cannons – that is madness.’\n\nIt remains a thoroughly modern challenge. Perhaps part of Nietzsche’s enduring appeal lies in his unwillingness to provide us with an answer. We are meant to find the meaning and the answer, if there is one, for ourselves: this is the true accomplishment of the Übermensch. One might reject science as faith; one might reject religious faith itself but still retain moral values. First, man must become himself. Secondly, amor fati; he must accept what life brings, avoiding the blind alleys of self-hatred and ressentiment. Then finally man can overcome himself to find true fulfilment as the Übermensch, the man at peace with himself, finding joy in his earthly purpose, rejoicing in the sheer magnificence of existence and content with the finitude of his mortality.\n\n‘I know my fate,’ he had written. ‘One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful – of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified. I am not a man, I am dynamite.’\n\nMan is a rope fastened between animal and superman – a rope over an abyss.\n\nThe objective of all human arrangements is through distracting one’s thoughts to cease to be aware of life.\n\nMy formula for human greatness: amor fati, love your fate. Want nothing different, neither backwards or forwards for all eternity. Not just to tolerate necessity – but to love it\n\nToday as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.\n\nNo one can construct for you the bridge on which you must cross the stream of life, no one but you alone.\n\nThoughts are the shadows of our feelings – always darker, emptier, simpler.\n\nTwo things a real man wants: danger and play. That’s why he wants woman – the most dangerous plaything.\n\nToday as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.\n\nNever trust a thought that occurs to you indoors."
