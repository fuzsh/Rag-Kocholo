        "text": "The Lamb & Flag, Oxford\n\nIf only walls could talk, we know these walls would have a thing or two to say. Being so close to Oxford gives the SOLID crew a chance to explore buildings steeped in history and our resident listed building specialist, David Girling, gets more than his fair share! Last week David was appointed to inspect a wall within the historic Lamb and Flag pub in central Oxford. Like many pubs, the Lamb and Flag was forced to close after 408 years of trading due to the adverse conditions of the pandemic.\n\nThe Inklings\n\nHaving existed for centuries as an integral part of Oxford city life, particularly for students at Oxford University, the community were devastated by the closure and the prospect of losing so much rich history. Residents formulated a plan to ensure the reopening of the pub. Led by Chairman Kate O’Brien, the Inklings Group was established. The Inklings Group consists of several hundred people who have joined together with a common motive, to keep the Lamb and Flag at the centre of Oxford City Life.\n\nIf the name ‘Inklings’ rings a bell, you are not wrong. The group are named in honour of the original Inklings, the literary discussion group associated with some of the finest writers Oxford have to offer. With the most famous members being J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis the Inklings met weekly to conduct readings and discussions of member’s unfinished work. They encouraged fantasy and narrative in fiction, as well as critiquing other fiction on the market. The original Inklings were patrons of the Lamb and Flag Pub. Whilst not their original haunt, that being the Eagle and Child, the group favourited the Lamb and Flag following the Eagle’s modernisation in 1962. It is said that the Inklings were not the only writers to favour this pub, local gossip has it that Thomas Hardy wrote his book ‘Jude the Obscure’ here too.\n\nOxford’s new Inklings group have secured funding and the pub is currently undergoing a renovation before it reopens this Autumn. During renovation work a leaning wall became a cause for concern, particularly as it was found to have damp and halted the replastering process. David inspected the wall and discovered that there were indeed signs of decay and recommended EBS, a timber specialist, were engaged to determine the extent. EBS found the truss bearings and wall plate to be decayed in several locations. SOLID are now scheduling timber repairs to address the issue, in-keeping with the building’s Grade II status. We have also recommended a French drain at the base of the wall to address the damp issue and a check of the roof coverings to keep the weather out on dreary Oxford days.\n\nSOLID wish the Inklings Group and the Lamb and Flag pub the very best of luck with their reopening and we will certainly be popping in for a drink or two.\n\nIf you have a listed building that requires a renovation, why not contact the SOLID team for advice."
