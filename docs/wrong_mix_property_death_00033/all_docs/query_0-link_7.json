        "text": "Programme details\n\nSeminars meet each weekday morning, with afternoons free for course-related field trips, individual study, or exploring the many places of interest in and around the city.\n\nMonday\n\nUnlikely Allies\n\nRanging across favourite reading, schools, youthful friendships, personal lives, early religious outlooks, and First World War soldiering experiences, we learn what Lewis and Tolkien had in common when they met in 1925, and what they did not. We join their conspiracy to revolutionise the Oxford English School.\n\nTuesday\n\nMythopoeia, Allegory, and Inklings\n\nSampling their poetry, we read Tolkien’s epic romance of Beren and Lúthien through Lewis’s eyes. We listen in on the late-night conversation that turned Lewis to Christianity in 1931, and ponder whether it changed Tolkien too. We join the thinking, drinking Inklings and find what Owen Barfield, Charles Williams and others brought to the brew.\n\nWednesday\n\nGiant Steps\n\nWeighing up two radically different attempts to see through medieval eyes, we pitch Tolkien’s Hobbit against Lewis’s academic and allegorical output. As we reach the zenith of their friendship, we witness their pact to write science fiction. We pursue Lewis powering through his space trilogy and examine the inspirations it shares with Tolkien’s Númenor.\n\nThursday\n\nAtlantis and Mars\n\nWe see what we can salvage from the flotsam of Tolkien’s unfinished time-travel experiment, The Lost Road and measure how much of him went into Lewis’s interplanetary hero, Elwin Ransom. Glancing forward to the 1940s, we ponder Tolkien’s Notion Club Papers as a portrait of the Inklings.\n\nIn the afternoon we follow the friends’ footsteps across Oxford and its colleges with a walking tour to Merton and Magdalen Colleges.\n\nFriday\n\nThe Lion, the Witch, and the War of the Ring\n\nUnrolling our maps, we explore two remarkable worlds as attempts to reconsecrate nature and refill the wells of the imagination. We trace Lewis’ impact on Middle-earth and Tolkien’s on Narnia. Finally, we watch them drift apart in life, only to leave an inextricably interwoven legacy.\n\nField Trip\n\nDestination: Merton and Magdalen Colleges, Oxford\n\nWebsite:\n\nwww.merton.ox.ac.uk\n\nwww.magd.ox.ac.uk\n\nExcursion Rating: Moderate - up to two hours' walk on even ground or up to an hour's walk on rough and/or steep ground or up lots of stairs and steps.\n\nAll fees are charged on a per week, per person basis.\n\nPlease be aware that all payments made via non-UK credit/debit cards and bank accounts are subject to the exchange rate on the day they are processed.\n\nPayment terms\n\nIf enrolling online: full payment by credit/debit card at the time of booking.\n\nIf submitting an enrolment form: full payment online by credit/debit card or via bank transfer within 30 days of invoice date.\n\nSupplementary costs\n\nExtended stay fee: Participants staying multiple, consecutive weeks are offered bed and breakfast accommodation for the Saturday night between their courses.

In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, an administration fee of £50 will be charged.\n\nAny ticketed activities, as outlined in the Social Programme.\n\nCancellations and refunds\n\n1. Cancellation by you\n\nParticipants who wish to cancel must inform the Programme Administrator in writing: by email to oxfordexperience@conted.ox.ac.uk, or by post to The Oxford Experience, OUDCE, 1 Wellington Square, OXFORD, OX1 2JA, UK.\n\nThe following cancellation and refund policy applies in all cases:\n\nCancellation within 14 days of online enrolment / payment of fees – full refund of all fees paid.\n\nCancellations received up to and including 30 April 2024 – OUDCE will retain an administration fee of £100 per week booked; all other fees paid will be refunded.\n\nCancellations received between 1-31 May 2024 – OUDCE will retain 60% of the fees paid; the remaining 40% of fees paid will be refunded.\n\nCancellations received on and after 1 June 2024 - no refunds will be made under any circumstances.\n\nWhere course fees have been paid in currencies other than pounds sterling, refunds will be subject to the exchange rate on the day they are processed.\n\n2. Cancellation by us\n\nWhere there is good reason, OUDCE reserves the right to cancel a course by giving you notice in writing at any time before the course is due to start. In these cases, we will endeavour to offer a transfer to another available course if practical and acceptable to you, subject to payment or refund of any difference in course fees. Alternatively, we will refund the course fees that you have already paid. If we cancel a course, our liability is limited to the fees that we have received from you; this means that we will not compensate you for any pre-booked travel costs or any other expenses incurred. The status of this course will be reviewed on 1 May 2024. If it is likely that the course may be cancelled, anyone affected will be notified by email within 7 days; if you have not heard from OUDCE by 8 May 2024, you should assume that your course will be running. You may wish to delay finalising your travel arrangements until after this date.\n\nOUDCE reserves the right to cancel a course at short notice in exceptional circumstances that would prevent the course from being delivered e.g. tutor illness. In these rare instances, and if we are unable to find a replacement tutor, we will notify you as soon as possible and arrange a transfer to another available Oxford Experience course. If we cancel a course, our liability is limited to the fees that we have received from you; this means that we will not compensate you for any pre-booked travel costs or any other expenses incurred.\n\nWhere course fees have been paid in currencies other than pounds sterling, refunds will be subject to the exchange rate on the day they are processed.\n\n3. Travel insurance\n\nAll participants must purchase travel insurance to cover the programme fee, travel costs, and any other expenses incurred. OUDCE cannot be held responsible for any costs you may incur in relation to travel or accommodation bookings as a result of a course cancellation, or if you are unable to attend the course for any other reason."
