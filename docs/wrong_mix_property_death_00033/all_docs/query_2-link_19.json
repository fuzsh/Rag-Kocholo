        "text": "So \"Aslan\" is the creator of Narnia and a magical powerful lion. When I was reading the books I didn't realize that Aslan was actually the real name of this lion because \"Aslan\" means \"lion\" in Turkish and I was reading the books in my native language (which is Turkish) , so I just thought it was direct translation.\n\nAfter I watched the movies in their own language,I realized the word and searched for it to see if it has a meaning in English. But both wikipedia and narnia.wiki.com state that the word is indeed from Turkish and no further explanation is given.\n\nI tried to find an explanation on why C.S. Lewis used a Turkish word for this character and only found that he never visited Turkey or Ottoman Empire and there is a debate going on whether it is just coincidentally or not. The character is also believed to represent Jesus and it sounds odd to me to choose the name from a non-christian country (whether it is odd or not is not part of the question).\n\nOn the question given above (represent Jesus), I have also found this comment saying that Lewis used other Turkish objects too.\n\nAslan means \"lion\" in Turkish. Lewis also used \"Turkish delight\" in his books. In the movie, the tents at Aslan's soldiers' camp bear a great resemblance to Ottoman and Turkish war tents. Peter is known as Peter the Magnificent just like the Ottoman Sultan Suleyman. Lewis used many things from other cultures (mostly Turkish and Middle Eastern), it wouldn't be surprising if Aslan was based on Jesus Christ.\n\nIs there any connection or info on why C.S. Lewis chose a Turkish word or on his interest in Turkish culture?\n\nYou are starting from flawed assumptions. Turkey is most notable to most of us for Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, named after Constantine, ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire and made into its capital. Constantine is known for \"Christianizing\" Rome. So there is your \"why use Turkey/Turkish\"\n\nWhy the Lion? Lions are a common symbol of royalty and symbol of Christianity, specifically Jesus, so it makes perfect sense to use a Lion.\n\nThis doesn't say why he used Aslan absolutely. Only he knows, but what may have been going through his mind? As someone in the same position as Lewis I can tell you that a lot of the names I choose are chosen by simply thinking of a meaning or symbol in English and then checking in various languages to see what the word for that thing is and if I like the sound I go with it. Lewis was into Christian mythology so it is likely that he came across Turkish at some point, liked it and so when he had to come up with the name used it.\n\nNullâ™¦\n\n70.1k2222 gold badges299299 silver badges381381 bronze badges\n\nanswered Jul 23, 2016 at 2:53\n\nDurakkenDurakken\n\n4,9431717 silver badges3434 bronze badges\n\nI suggest this Quora answer to shed light on the several references to Turkic culture, he makes in his books: https://qr.ae/prXaHt\n\nAccording to these, he has a deeper interest in Turkic culture other than seeing the word in the Arabian Tales (Which is odd in the first place, One Thousand and One Nights have mostly Arabic, Persian, Ancient Anatolian/Mesopotamian and Indian tales. At this time and when these folk tales were set Turkic culture would have been considered young and barbaric, Turks are originally Central Asian nomads after all. I have read the book in Turkish and have seen no content related to Turks)\n\nAnd why wouldn't he be, really? Why is anyone interested in any culture? Many references are made to other cultures in other works and they are considered normal, I guess Turkic culture is not really known very well by most people so it creates some questions. He could have also made the relation of Turkic words= language spoken in ancient Anatolia, which is home to Orthodox Christianity, although Turks migrated there from Central Asia MUCH later. I have seen some authors make the same wrongful relation such as in a manga called Red River where the prince of the ancient Hittite people is called Aslan.\n\nanswered Nov 29, 2022 at 18:58\n\nhiraethhiraeth\n\n111 bronze badge"
