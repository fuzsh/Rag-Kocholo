        "text": "CS Lewis as a child\n\nClive Staples Lewis (CS Lewis) was born in Belfast, Ireland, on November 29, 1898. His grandfather Richard Lewis was born in Wales. His mother Florence Augusta Hamilton was a daughter of the Church of Ireland as a priest. The church would later become heavily influential to Lewis’s life. As a child, Lewis was interested in the Beatrix Potter series and had a fascination to write his own stories with anthropomorphic animals. His parents’ house was filled with books and finding a new one to read he said was as easy as \"finding a new blade of grass\" in a field.\n\n'Little Lea', childhood home of CS Lewis\n\nLewis was home schooled before being sent to a school in Watford, Hertfordshire, at the age of 10, just after his mother’s passing from cancer. Strangely, the school was closed soon after and the headmaster was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis went on to Campbell College, in eastern Belfast which was closer to his home, but had to leave early due to a respiratory illness. Lewis continued his education in the health-resort town of Malvern, Worcestershire, attending the prep school Cherbourg House and what he referred to as \"Chartres\". During this time, he questioned many things and abandoned Christianity. His interest in mythology and legend would usurp his spiritual beliefs. At 15, he enrolled at Malvern College, but again left before finishing with a private tutor William T. Kirkpatrick, whom his father knew and was a former headmaster.\n\nThrough his teen years, he delved further into the ancient sagas of Scandinavia, and spent more time outside appreciating the natural world. His writings of the time reflect this departure and use of epic poetry. Also, Kirkpatrick inspired his love for Greek literature and later Irish Mythology. Lewis was awarded a scholarship at the University of Oxford, but was sidetracked by WWI where he saw the horrors of his Godless imagination.\n\nOver time, Lewis looked for the companionship of fellow Irishmen living in England. He also made a point to visit his homeland on a regular basis.\n\nDuring the war he was led in the Third Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry and fought on the front lines in Somme Valley, France. In April of 1918, Lewis was wounded by a friendly shell’s misfire, while his two trench mates were killed. Depressed, tired, and recovering he was released and returned to his studies.\n\nLewis received many awards while at Oxford for his literature merit.\n\nIn his thirties, Lewis relocated with his brother, and a Mrs. Jane Moore and her daughter Maureen (whom he looked after for a fallen comrade) to the outskirts of Oxford in a house they called ‘The Kilns’. They put their money together for its purchase.\n\nThe Kilns in Oxford\n\nIn time, Lewis embraced again a version of the Christianity he knew as a child, primarily out of the arguments he had with fellow Oxford writer J.R.R. Tolkien, discussions with Hugo Dyson and by the book The Everlasting Man by G.K. Chesterton. He writes that his conversion was not easy though and by 1931, he felt committed mostly to the Anglican theology.\n\nLewis and Tolkien went on to serve on the English faculty at Oxford University, and were both members of the “Inklings” literary group that met every Tuesday morning at the Eagle and the Child Pub.\n\nPublisher Lorin Morgan-Richards stands in front of the Eagle and Child Pub\n\nAt the outbreak of the war in 1939, ‘The Kilns’ became a place for evacuees of London. Lewis tried to reenter military life, but was rejected instead to write columns for the Ministry of Information. He decided against it and served honorable in the Home Guard in Oxford. During the war, Lewis also spoke on BBC religious programs over the radio while the city struggled under air raids.\n\nAt the age of 51 Lewis released his most famous works for children, in the Chronicles of Narnia, a series of seven fantasy novels. The books have been widely distributed in at least 41 different languages and have sold over 100 million copies. Narnia is known for its Christian themes and conflicts he endured in his life.\n\nMembers of the Inklings\n\nIn 1954, Lewis was granted a chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University where he finished his career. At the age of 65, Lewis died of renal failure in his bedroom of ‘The Kilns’ homestead.\n\nStatue honoring CS Lewis in Belfast, Ireland"
