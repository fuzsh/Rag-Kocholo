        "text": "Both C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien arrived at Oxford University through different paths but eventually found themselves in the same academic and literary circles, leading to one of the most famous friendships in literary history.\n\nLewis, born in Belfast, was awarded a scholarship to University College, Oxford, in 1917. Despite initially struggling with the transition to university life, Lewis quickly found his academic footing, earning a double first in Greats (classical philosophy and history) by 1922. Tolkien, on the other hand, attended Exeter College, Oxford, where he also excelled academically, specializing in languages and philology.\n\nTheir paths converged when both Lewis and Tolkien became faculty members at Oxford University. Lewis was a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College, while Tolkien held the position of Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College. Their shared interests in literature, language, and mythology naturally drew them together, and they soon became friends.\n\nA love of language and imagination, nourished by a profound and extensive reading of northern myth and fairytales, was the foundation of their friendship. They were both romantics who avoided contemporary poetry. They had both lost their mothers when they were young and had lost the majority of their pals to the horrors of the trenches. Both of them were devout Christians. Tolkien remained constant while Lewis fell in and out of faith. Their most successful writing was founded on their Christian faith.\n\nIn terms of literary taste, Tolkien and Lewis were at odds. Narnia was “beyond the realm of my sympathy,” Tolkien conceded, “as much of my writing was outside his.” “An unpleasant and in places terrible piece,” he said of Lewis’ Letters to Malcolm. He gently chastised Jack for using Middle-earth terminology in his own stories. “Lewis was a highly impressionable man,” he said, describing Lewis’ writing as “creaking” and “stiff-jointed,” and suggesting it was unoriginal.\n\nTheir friendship was deep and meaningful, yet their disagreements and rivalries were legendary. While they frequently praised each other’s published works in public, they were hesitant to do so in private. Tolkien was critical of Lewis’ Narnia books, particularly the religious aspects. He believed the Christian archetypes were far too overt and evident, and that the works’ popularity would encourage heresy."
