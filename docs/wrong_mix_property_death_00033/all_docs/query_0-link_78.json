        "text": "Is there at least a little value in mistakenly taking a wrong turn? C.S. Lewis thought so.\n\nIn 1916, long before he wrote classics like “The Chronicles of Narnia,” Lewis traveled by train to Oxford to take a scholarship exam. He was 18.\n\nYoung Lewis exited the train station and was increasingly disappointed by what he encountered as he walked. Where were the “dreaming spires” of Oxford? All he saw were shops and, eventually, open country.\n\nThen Lewis stopped, turned around and looked.\n\n“There, behind me, far away, never more beautiful since, was the fabled cluster of spires and towers,” Lewis recalled years later in “Surprised by Joy,” his spiritual memoir.\n\nLewis had been on the right road. He had just turned the wrong way from the train station and started out in the wrong direction.\n\n“I did not see to what extent this little adventure was an allegory of my whole life,” he wrote.\n\nBut he did see the connection later, especially as he traced the path by which he had possessed, then lost, then regained his Christianity. It took some time, but he eventually looked back, saw the truth of his faith and set out in the right direction — toward the beauty.\n\nNo one wants to travel in the wrong direction, whether in life or just while taking a trip. And it’s silly to romanticize a mistake or to imbue one with undue meaning.\n\nStill, the act of taking a wrong turn isn’t without its benefits.\n\nFor one thing, the joy of spotting our destination is enhanced when we have worked a bit harder to find it. Perhaps that’s why, for Lewis, Oxford was “never more beautiful” than it was that day. And maybe that’s why his religious faith was stronger for having been hidden behind an intellectual fog for so long.\n\nAnother advantage is that going the wrong way, on a road or in life, reduces our fear of going the wrong way. We learn to find our way back, and in the process build confidence. We will need that confidence the next time — and there usually is a next time — that we stray.\n\nIt’s also comforting, with the benefit of hindsight, to look back on our lost moments and realize the way out wasn’t too far beyond our grasp, after all. Like Lewis, we probably are on the right road, just going in the wrong direction, and the beauty that we seek is within sight once we turn around.\n\nThe GPS generation probably takes a lot fewer wrong turns (on the road, anyway) than my generation does. But there’s a satisfaction, a sense of both strength and humility, that comes from finding your way.\n\nContact Jim Ross at jim.ross@starbanner.com"
