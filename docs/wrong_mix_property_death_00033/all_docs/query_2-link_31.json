        "text": "The Inklings were a group of Oxford professors and residents who met in the 1930s and 40s to discuss literature, philosophy, and culture. Bibliophiles know the group for its two most famous members, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Together, the Inklings changed the way we think about imagination and religion in the 20th century and beyond.\n\nAs I write this, it’s September and at last we’re getting the first delicious stirrings of fall. (I kept my windows open last night!) In the spirit of fall and all the back-to-school associations that brings, today’s post is an introduction to an academic group of literature enthusiasts who met in the most quintessential scholarly setting in the world: Oxford University. Not Yale, not Harvard, not Ca– well, you get the point, it’s clear I have my favourite!\n\nThe group called themselves “the Inklings.”\n\nActive in the 1930s-40s, the Inklings met regularly for fellowship and to discuss their latest compositions. Although plenty of scholarly groups like this existed in Oxford and Cambridge and other university towns, the Inklings is remembered because among its members were two of the most famous authors of the twentieth century: J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis.\n\nIf you know even a little about the authors J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, you’ll know that they knew each other–perhaps even that they were friends for most of their adult lives. This friendship was crucial to their writings, and it’s incredible to think that without it, Lewis’s books would’ve been wholly different; Tolkien’s might not be published at all!\n\nTolkien wrote that “The unpayable debt that I owe to [C. S. Lewis] was not ‘influence’ as it is ordinarily understood, but sheer encouragement. He was for long my only audience. Only from him did I ever get the idea that my ‘stuff’ could be more than a private hobby. But for his interest and unceasing eagerness for more I should never have brought The L. of the R. to a conclusion.”\n\nBy “The L. of the R.” he means The Lord of the Rings, of course. Can you imagine? Can you imagine not having these books, and their influence on popular culture and literally every fantasy novel published since? I’m not sure we can!\n\nFor many of us fans, the roots of our love for Tolkien’s world go deep. There was already a Tolkien Society begun in Tolkien’s lifetime, and the books exploded in popularity with college students and young adults during the counter-culture of the mid ’60s and ’70s. When those fans (among them my dad) grew up, they read Tolkien’s books to their kids (among them, me). We were the lucky ones who got to watch those stories of our childhood come to life with Peter Jackson’s film trilogy. And now, as hopefully a new generation of Tolkien fans emerges, we have The Rings of Power series.\n\nSimilarly, Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia series is part of the fabric of our childhood imaginations. They made us realise literature’s power to move us deeply–to feel heroism, suspense, longing, even virtues like prudence and temperance (would I have known to leave the wardrobe door open? Would I have gorged myself on Turkish delight? Struck the bell on Charn?).\n\nThe Tolkien-Lewis friendship predated the unofficial “official” Inklings group. Both professors at Oxford, they already met often for conversation, and adopted the Inklings moniker after a university group of the same name disbanded in 1933. Increasingly, they began inviting other colleagues to join them, and soon had regular gatherings.\n\nIf you could time travel back to Oxford in the 1930s on a Tuesday morning (almost any Tuesday will do), and make your way to St. Giles’ Street, it’s very likely you’d see Lewis, Tolkien, and several of their friends enter the Eagle and Child pub. You’d see them head straight to a back room, closed off from the rest of the pub, where they’d lunch, drink beer, and enjoy the type of hearty or mundane conversation that happens in the current of a busy, typical day.\n\nThe real “business,” so to speak, happened on Thursday nights after the day’s business was done, when the group could linger late into the night, deep in discussion or listening to each other’s scribblings–scribblings that would later become their lectures, published poems, novels, radio broadcasts, or plays.\n\nFor these Thursday meetings the Inklings met in C. S. Lewis’s rooms at Magdalen College. Lewis had a house outside of Oxford, but as a university professor he had private rooms within his college where he could work and conduct tutorials with students. There were couches and chairs, and a fireplace to keep things cozy on frosty nights, and many of the men would light pipes as they settled in.\n\nLet’s take a look round the room and see who might’ve been there…\n\nInklings Members (Besides Tolkien and Lewis)\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis are the most well-known of the Inklings, but about twenty additional participants came and went over the years. The numbers were fluid, and World War II shuffled things up as some members left Oxford and others arrived. A typical Thursday gathering could see anywhere from three to seven men, sometimes more.\n\nOwen Barfield\n\nOwen Barfield met C. S. Lewis when the two were undergraduates at Oxford and they remained close friends for over four decades, until Lewis’s death. One of the customs they maintained throughout the years was to take long, rambling walking tours around the English countryside during school holidays, sometimes joined by Tolkien or other friends. (If you’ll recall, Lewis’s novel Out of the Silent Planet begins with the protagonist taking a walking tour.)\n\nBarfield had a tremendous influence on both Lewis and Tolkien in their conversations about the significance of imagination, truth, myth, the history of language, and other themes that would recur throughout their writings. Lewis said that Barfield helped cure him of “chronological snobbery”; the assumption that past ages are inferior for lack of our modern answers. I doubt Lewis ever would’ve written a fantasy series if it hadn’t been for Owen Barfield.\n\nCharles Williams\n\nCharles Williams joined the Inklings when his employer, the Oxford University Press, relocated from London to Oxford to avoid bombing during World War II. Williams and C. S. Lewis had already exchanged letters of mutual admiration for each other’s work, and Lewis was only too happy to invite him into the group. Tolkien, on the other hand, while he enjoyed Williams’s company, remarked later that they “had nothing to say to one another at deeper (or higher) levels” and that their minds were “poles apart.”\n\nBesides Lewis and Tolkien, Williams was the other major novelist of the Inklings group, publishing seven novels–the last of which, All Hallows Eve, was written and read aloud during his time with the Inklings. Williams’s novels are metaphysical thrillers that blend Christianity with occult themes and symbolism, and take place in modern England rather than an invented fantasy world. (The final book in Lewis’s Space Trilogy, That Hideous Strength, is certainly influenced by Williams’s style.)\n\nIn addition to novels, Williams wrote plays, biographies, literary criticism, theology, and poetry. He considered his most important work to be his complex Arthurian poetry cycles Taliessin Through Logres, and The Region of the Summer Stars. His book on Dante inspired Dorothy L. Sayers to leave off writing detective novels in order to translate The Divine Comedy. (Not sure if Peter Wimsey fans can thank him for that.)\n\nYou can read the novels of Charles Williams online for free.\n\nWarren “Warnie” Lewis\n\nOlder brother to C. S. Lewis, Warren was one of the few Inklings who was not an Oxford don. Although both Jack and Warren fought in World War I, Warren continued his military career after the war, serving in postings around the world and coming out of retirement to serve in World War II (he was one of the soldiers evacuated at Dunkirk).\n\nDr. Robert Havard\n\nDr U.Q. Humphrey\n\nMade poultices of comfrey\n\nIf you didn’t pay his bills\n\nHe gave you doses of squills\n\n– J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nA medical doctor who attended Lewis (and later Lewis’s wife, Joy Gresham), Lewis invited him to come to the Inklings meetings because of Havard’s interest in literature. Harvard became one of the most faithful attendees of the Inklings, and garnered the most nicknames including “Humphrey,” “Useless Quack” (or simply “U. Q.”, and “The Red Admiral.” He later became neighbors with the Tolkien family and attended the Catholic church with them. Lewis’s book Prince Caspian is dedicated to Havard’s daughter.\n\nHugo Dyson\n\nHugo Dyson was an English literature professor who specialized in Shakespeare, Neoclassical authors, and the Romantics. Known as the most colorful of the Inklings, Dyson was voluble and witty, always preferring conversation at the Inklings meetings over listening to compositions. During one meeting, at the prospect of hearing from The Lord of the Rings, Christopher Tolkien recalls Dyson “lying on the couch, and lolling and shouting and saying, “Oh God, no more elves.'” (Except that others have reported Dyson’s language was a bit stronger!)\n\nWarren Lewis described Dyson as “being made of quick silver,” and after one particularly lively meeting, C. S. Lewis called him a “roaring cataract of nonsense.” But one thing Dyson took seriously was his deeply-held faith. Along with Tolkien, Dyson was instrumental in converting C. S. Lewis to Christianity. They had many conversations on spiritual matters, including a memorable late-night talk in Addison’s Walk that Lewis credited for moving him to believe not just in God, but in Christ and Christianity. If you’re not a fan of Lewis this won’t mean much, if you are, it’s providential: Lewis was the greatest Christian apologist of the twentieth century, and without his faith the Narnia chronicles couldn’t have been written.\n\nLord David Cecil\n\nNevill Coghill\n\nMr. Neville Judson Coghill\n\nWrote a deal of dangerous doggerill.\n\nPractical, progressive men\n\nCalled him Little Poison-pen\n\n– J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nAn Irishman like the Lewis brothers, Coghill specialized in drama, serving as director and producer in the Oxford University Dramatic Society. During his career he directed Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and co-wrote several plays including the pageant The Masque of Hope in honor of Princess Elizabeth’s visit to Oxford in 1948, and the West End and Broadway musical Canterbury Tales.\n\nAdam Fox\n\nJack A. W. Bennett\n\nBennett was the youngest Inklings member and the only New Zealander. Bennett specialized in Middle English literature, lecturing and editing volumes on Chaucer and Malory. He was elected Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University after C. S. Lewis retired from the position in 1963.\n\nChristopher Tolkien\n\nSon of J. R. R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien began attending Inklings meetings at his father’s invitation when he was twenty-one. Christopher Tolkien had grown up hearing his father’s tales of Middle Earth, and he was often the one to read aloud sections of The Lord of the Rings during gatherings of the Inklings.\n\nOther Inklings Members and Occasional Guests\n\nThere are a number of other men who attended the Inklings at one time or another. I will add their biographies here as I’m able! Meanwhile, in bullet form:\n\nColin Hardie (Lewis’s The Silver Chair is dedicated to his son Nicholas)\n\nFr. Gervase Matthew\n\nCharles Leslie Wrenn\n\nC. E. Stevens\n\nJames Dundas-Grant\n\nR. B. McCallum\n\nPercy Bates\n\nWalter Hooper\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nMartin Gilbert\n\nJohn David Arnett\n\nJon Fromke\n\nE. R. Eddison (author of the fantasy novels The Worm Ouroboros and the Zimiamvia trilogy)\n\nRoy Campbell\n\nJohn Wain (although he attended some Inklings meetings, Wain didn’t identify himself as part of the group)\n\nWas Dorothy L. Sayers an Inkling?\n\nThe Inklings was a boys’ club, and Dorothy L. Sayers wasn’t in it. Nor were any other women. Sayers wasn’t actually living in Oxford when the Inklings were active. However, as an Oxford alumna and friend of several Inklings members, her name has often been associated with the group. For the purposes of our Classics Reading Challenge, you can consider Sayers an “honorary Inkling” and read one of her books for this month’s theme, if you like!\n\nWorks by Clive Staples Lewis (“Jack”)\n\nFiction\n\nThe Pilgrim’s Regress – A modern retelling of Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress.\n\nThe Space Trilogy (Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, and That Hideous Strength)\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia series (7 books)\n\nThe Screwtape Letters – A collection of “letters” written by a senior demon to his mentee.\n\nThe Great Divorce – An allegorical novella about Heaven and Hell.\n\nTill We Have Faces – A novel retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth.
