Lewis once trod, philosophy major Sierra Volmar (‘26) spent a semester abroad soaking in the rich history of the “charming little city” of Oxford. \n\nSierra relished the experience of “learning from the actual place” and “soaking up the history” of Oxford alongside her more formal academic learning. \n\nSierra spent her time studying the Philosophy of Aesthetics and Augustinian Philosophy and said that during her time there she “became a better writer and defender of my ideas.”\n\nHowever, even more than her studies, Sierra was deeply formed by the faith traditions of England. One of her most cherished traditions while studying at Oxford was attending Evensong at Christchurch and partaking in sung liturgy. “I would recommend anyone going to Oxford to find a church and have that rich liturgical experience.” \n\nSlide through to see Sierra’s list of Oxford ‘Must-Sees!’\".",
