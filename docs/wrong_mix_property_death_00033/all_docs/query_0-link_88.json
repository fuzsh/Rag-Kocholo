Lewis scholar Dabney Hart will present a lecture “Myth: The Master Key,” on Monday, Jan. 17, at 8 p.m. in Brooks-Rogers Recital Hall. In the lecture she will explore Lewis’ idea of how myth became fact in the incarnation of Christ.\n\nC.S. Lewis was a novelist, poet, and Oxford scholar best known for his “Chronicles of Narnia” children’s’ books. The Narnia series includes seven books on the adventures of the Pevensie children and has sold over 100 million copies since “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” was published in 1950.\n\nLewis began his writing career as a literary critic and by his early thirties, had published several book reviews, including his breakout work, “The Allegory of Love,” in 1935. By the end of his life, Lewis had written 38 books in all, including the novels “Till We Have Faces” and “Out of the Silent Planet;” the satire, “The Screwtape Letters;” and several volumes of Christian apologetics, including “Mere Christianity” and “The Problem of Pain.” He is widely regarded for his ability to simplify intellectual and philosophical concepts.\n\nDabney Hart is an associate professor emerita at Georgia State University, focusing on the work of C.S. Lewis. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1959, the first person ever to write a doctoral dissertation on the work of Lewis, and a friend of his from 1956 until his death in 1963. Since her retirement from the University in 1993, where she had been an associate professor of English since 1980, Hart has remained active as a lecturer.\n\nHart is featured in an interview for the PBS documentary on Lewis, “The Magic Never Ends,” broadcast in 2001. She also spoke last November at the C.S. Lewis Festival in Michigan and was the Scholar Guest of Honor at Mythcon XXXIV in 2003, focusing on wise women in Mythopoetic fiction.\n\nIn addition to several articles on Lewis, Hart has written the book, “Through the Open Door: A New Look at C.S. Lewis,” published in1984. The book explores the importance of myth in Lewis’s imaginative and critical writing. Her doctoral dissertation has long been recommended as the best introduction to Lewis’s literary work.\n\nThe lecture is sponsored by the Winter Study Committee, the Chaplain’s Office and the Williams Christian Fellowship.\n\n***\n\nFor building locations on the Williams campus, please consult the map outside the driveway entrance to the Security Office located in Hopkins Hall on Main Street (Rte. 2), next to the Thompson Memorial Chapel, or call the Office of Public Affairs (413) 597-4277.
