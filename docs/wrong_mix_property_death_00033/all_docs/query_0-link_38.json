It was said he enjoyed wandering here while writing his children's book series about Narnia which includes The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. With the A40 nearby and surrounded by houses, it is a surprise that the reserve has kept its sense of stillness.\n\nFun for children\n\nIt is not just the literary associations which have brought countless children back here time and time again. This BBOWT community nature reserve has been used for field study trips and pond dipping by young people since 1969."
