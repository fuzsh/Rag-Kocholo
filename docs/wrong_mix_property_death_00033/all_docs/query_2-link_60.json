        "text": "Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in 1898. Though educated in England, the landscape and culture of Northern Ireland always held a special place in his heart. In 1917 Lewis volunteered for the British Army and served in the trenches in World War One. Six months later he was wounded and returned to England. There he studied at Oxford University and in 1925 he became Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College.\n\nLewis became friends with fellow tutor and novelist J. R. R. Tolkien, whose influence led him to a conversion from atheism to Christianity. This became an important part of his life and he is almost as famous a theologian as he is an author. His most well-known works are The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy.\n\nIn 1956, life-long bachelor Lewis married Joy Davidman. She died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis himself died in 1963, one week before his 65th birthday.\n\nHow well do you know the life and works of C.S. Lewis? Test yourself in this fun quiz!"
