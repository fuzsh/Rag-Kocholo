        "text": "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. (1 Corinthians 13:12)\n\nOverly ambitious, I recently read C. S. Lewis’ Till We Have Faces aloud to my 6th grade Literature class, and I was dismayed to hear one student reflect that he thought the book was profanely irreverent since it discussed other deities and just, well, didn’t seem as biblical as the Narnia series. C. S. Lewis is a household name in American evangelical circles for his fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia (published 1950-1956) and his nonfiction essays, speeches, and popular apologetics materials such as The Abolition of Man (1943, based on radio addresses from 1941-1944), and Mere Christianity (1952). While the Narnia series positively oozes with Christian symbolism and biblical allusion, in this, his final work of fiction, Lewis effectually communicates what so many thoroughly orthodox theology textbooks tirelessly aim to do: Till We Have Faces (1956) gently coaxes the reader to come to terms with both the futility of quarreling with the Almighty, and the resplendent beauty of the thrice-holy King.\n\nThe Original Myth of Eros (Cupid) and Psyche: Prolegomena\n\nMost fairy tales introduce, follow, and largely feature the brave and charming boy or the beautiful and resourceful girl as the lead protagonist of the story, and the story naturally unfolds from that character’s perspective. Till We Have Faces is a retelling of the Greek myth of Eros (better known as the Roman Cupid) and Psyche with a twist. Before considering Lewis’ retelling of the story, one must become acquainted with the original story to appreciate the novelty and beauty of what story Lewis so desired to tell.\n\nThe original myth of Cupid and Psyche stars Psyche, a mortal princess born with such uncanny beauty that she rivaled the goddess Aphrodite. Psyche was so beautiful that her countrymen began to venerate her instead of Aphrodite. In envious rage, Aphrodite cursed Psyche, such that she should only desire and eventually marry the most hideous of beasts. However, when Aphrodite delegated this curse to her son Cupid, he was stunned by Psyche’s pure beauty. Accidentally pricked to the heart with his love-poisoned arrows, at once he fell in love with Psyche and snatched her away to betroth her to himself in secret. Rather than Psyche suffering the goddess’ intended curse which would have abased the princess below the most common of women, Psyche instead is enraptured by her doting husband and whisked away from society. The singular rule her mysterious husband (Cupid) gave her is that Psyche is never to know her husband’s identity, for fear that they would be found out by Aphrodite and for fear of what that revelation would do to them if Psyche were to discover the truth that she was married to divinity. For a long time, Psyche is satisfied with this arrangement, given that her husband thoroughly provided for her every need: he furnished her a lavish palace (complete with invisible spirit servants), tenderly nourished her every desire, and enjoyed her love upon their marriage bed at night.\n\nLater, Psyche’s sisters visited at her request, and in their envious rage at their sister’s good fortune, they instructed Psyche to take a lamp and a dagger to bed that night, to expose and slay the beast. They reason: no person chooses to remain secret and hidden if they are true and good and beautiful. Her husband must be a hideous beast, a lying scoundrel, or worse. They sowed seeds of doubt in Psyche’s mind regarding her husband’s rule of anonymity, and eventually Psyche succumbed to their temptations to doubt her husband’s goodness, beauty, and the integrity of his love towards her. Psyche naively obeyed, but her treachery revealed that her beloved is no monster or rogue as her sisters suspected, but he was actually beautiful beyond comprehension. The wax from the lamp dripped on Cupid’s slumbering form as Psyche gazed with rapture at her lover bareface. Startled by the wax, Cupid fled from his beloved Psyche, knowing that she had broken his rule which now endangered them from Aphrodite’s wrath.\n\nGodforsaken, Psyche was doomed to wander in mourning the rest of her life, until she was captured by Aphrodite and tasked (read: cursed) with several herculean tasks by which she might regain her freedom and status. Along her journey, she is miraculously helped with these herculean labors such that she was able to fulfill them one by one. In the end, a merciful Cupid himself interceded for her and won not only her freedom and redemption from Aphrodite’s wrath, but also divine immortality and the right for Psyche and Cupid to be legally married. They married and they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThe reader will likely recognize several elements of this story from recent retellings of fairy tales, whether in print by such storytellers as the Brothers Grimm or more recently popularized in the English speaking world by musical theater in animation by Disney princesses. Disney’s Beauty and the Beast (1991) is the closest parallel—the pivotal song in the Disney animated film, “Tale As Old As Time” even heavily features Cupid imagery to solidify the connection. Disney’s Cinderella (1950) also suffers and triumphantly fulfills (by the help of compassionate animals and faeries) the same kinds of herculean chores to which Psyche is subjected in order to reach her beloved.\n\nBut Lewis’ story packs quite a bit more punch than your average Disney princess story (or Greek myth), and has a more powerful (if more subtle) message that every believer shall enjoy: God in Christ by the Spirit has loved unlovely and ungodly rebels, that they might lovely be. I will summarize and analyze this story in Part Two.\n\n©Joseph Pollard.
