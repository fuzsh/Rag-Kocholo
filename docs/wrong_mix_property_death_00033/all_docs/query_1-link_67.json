        "text": "One person whose faith was greatly encouraged by the writings of C.S. Lewis is Professor Alister McGrath. Both men were raised in Northern Ireland, studied at Oxford University and went on to become professors there. They also both came to faith from atheism slightly later in life. Alister has written numerous books on C.S. Lewis, including a seminal biography C.S. Lewis – A Life.\n\nListen to new episodes every Monday, where Ruth Jackson and Professor Alister McGrath will focus on the profound and challenging ideas from C.S. Lewis, providing thoughtful insights that answer questions that impact culture today.\n\n” I owe C.S. Lewis immeasurably, for he took me from “half-convinced” wanderer to full-fledged Christian. Now, thirty years later my faith has endured, and I want to give others that gift. If I could I’d give much more, but for now please take this small donation. I’m loving the dynamic between Ruth Jackson and Professor Alister McGrath. One idea – start responding to the big Twitter/YouTubers who have big influences. We need to meet this culture where it is and then take them back to faith! “\n\nA listener of C.S Lewis\n\nAbout Alister McGrath\n\nProfessor Alister McGrath is the Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and Religion at Oxford University. He holds three Oxford doctorates: a doctoral degree in molecular biophysics, a Doctor of Divinity degree in theology and a Doctor of Letters degree in intellectual history.
