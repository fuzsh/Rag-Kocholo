        "text": "Belgium's King Philippe on Tuesday begins a historic visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, in a region cruelly exploited by his ancestors, as tensions rise in the volatile east.\n\nThe six-day trip, at the invitation of President Felix Tshisekedi, has strong symbolic significance, coming two years after Philippe expressed to the Congolese leader his \"deepest regrets\" for the \"wounds\" of colonization.\n\nThe visit, the monarch's first to the DRC since ascending the throne in 2013, has been billed as a chance for reconciliation after the atrocities and other abuses committed under Belgian colonial rule.\n\nThe visit had originally been scheduled to take place in June 2020 to mark the DRC's 60th anniversary of independence but was rescheduled to 2022 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt was then postponed from March to June because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhilippe will be accompanied by his wife, Queen Mathilde, and members of the Belgian government, including Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.\n\nThree stops are planned, and the sovereign will deliver a speech at the first two: in Kinshasa on Wednesday during a ceremony with Tshisekedi at the Congolese parliament, then Friday before students at the University of Lubumbashi in the south of the country.\n\nHistorians say millions of people in the Belgian Congo were killed, mutilated or died of disease as they worked on rubber plantations belonging to Leopold II, Belgium's monarch from 1865 to 1909 and the brother of Philippe's great-great-grandfather.\n\nThe growth of Black Lives Matter, initially a reaction to police violence in the United States but now a broader anti-racist movement, has seen several colonial-era statues removed in Belgium."
