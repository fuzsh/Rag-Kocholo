        "text": "Belgium's King has expressed regret for the violence carried out by the country when it ruled over what is now Congo.\n\nLater in the day, the bust of a former monarch held responsible for the death of millions of Africans was taken off public display.\n\nAs Belgium marked the 60th anniversary of the end of its colonial rule in Congo, King Philippe became its first monarch to express remorse over the bloodshed.\n\nIn a letter to the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, Philippe stopped short of issuing a formal apology, but proclaimed his \"deepest regrets\" for the \"acts of violence and cruelty\" and the \"suffering and humiliation\" inflicted on Belgian Congo.\n\nThe removal of King Leopold II's statue took place only hours after Philippe's letter was published.\n\nThe monarch, who ruled Belgium from 1865-1909, plundered Congo, forcing many of its people into slavery to extract resources for his own profit.\n\nThe early years after he laid claim to the African country are especially infamous for killings, forced labour and other forms of brutality that some experts estimate left as many as 10 million Congolese dead.\n\nFollowing a short ceremony punctuated by readings, Leopold's bust in Ghent was attached to a crane with a strap, amid applause, and taken away from the small park where it stood.\n\nIt will be transferred to a warehouse of a Ghent city museum pending a further decision from a city's commission in charge of decolonisation projects.\n\n\"Removing statues does not erase history, it rectifies history and makes new history that rightly calls into question dominant narratives,\" said Mathieu Charles, an activist from the Belgian Network for Black Lives.\n\nBelgium has in the past focussed on the so-called positive aspects of the colonisation.\n\nBut the international protests against racism that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd in the United States have given a new momentum to activists fighting to have monuments to Leopold removed.\n\nEarlier this month, about 10,000 people gathered in Brussels despite the social distancing measures implemented to fight the spread of COVID-19, with many protesters chanting anti-colonialist slogans.\n\nThe Leopold statue in Ghent was vandalised several times in the past and again after Mr Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.\n\nSeveral other monuments of the former king scattered across Belgium were defaced over the past few weeks and a statue of the monarch in the port of Antwerp was removed from a marketplace by local authorities.\n\nBelgium to formally investigate colonial past\n\nMeanwhile, regional authorities also promised history-course reforms to better explain the true character of colonialism while the federal Parliament decided that a commission would look into Belgium's colonial past.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes has called for \"an in-depth\" debate conducted \"without taboo\".\n\n\"In 2020, we must be able to look at this shared past with lucidity and discernment,\" she said.\n\nAfter Leopold's claimed ownership of Congo ended in 1908, he handed it over to the Belgian state, which continued to rule over the colony 75 times Belgium's size until the African nation became independent in 1960.\n\nIn his letter Philippe stressed the \"common achievements\" reached by Belgium and its former colony, but also the painful episodes of their unequal relationship.\n\n\"At the time of the independent State of the Congo, acts of violence and cruelty were committed that still weigh on our collective memory,\" King Philippe wrote, referring to the period when the country was privately ruled by Leopold II from 1885 to 1908.\n\n\"I want to express my most deepest regrets for these wounds of the past, the pain of which is today revived by discrimination that is all too present in our societies.\"\n\nKing Philippe also congratulated Tshisekedi on the anniversary of Congo's independence, ruing that he was not able to attend the celebrations to which he had been invited due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLoading..."
