        "text": "Menu dated 10th March 1870\n\nDinner at the Château Royal de Laeken, Brussels, hosted by Their Majesties King Léopold II and Queen Marie-Henriette of the Belgians\n\n​\n\nWhen a young 34 year-old Léopold II sat down to this royal dinner in 1870, he was only into the fifth year of his four and half decade reign as King of the Belgians.\n\nThis amazing 20 course banquet, shared with his wife Queen Marie-Henriette, gives a telling insight into how King Léopold II became distinguished by his portliness as he progressed through his reign.\n\nDelicacies including partridges stuffed with foie-gras and set in sherry jelly accompanied a spread of roast woodcocks and roast snipe with a refresing stomach-soothing Champagne sorbet making a timely appearance halfway through the dinner.\n\nKing Léopold’s love of fine food caused gastronomic ripples in the early 1900s when his unlimited budget allowed him to secure the chef from the famous Jockey Club in Paris after the King appreciatively devoured the chef's offering of duckling with turnips.\n\nEach morning while the King read his papers a Court officer would arrive to take his orders for the day and present the King with a draft dinner menu of up to 30 courses. Léopold, who enjoyed an impressive apetitie, would then cross-out those that did not tempt his royal palate that day."
