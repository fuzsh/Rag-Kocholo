He inherited a\n\ncountry not much bigger than New\n\nHampshire, wedged between the old\n\nworld power of France and the\n\nrising might of a new and unified\n\nGermany. While across the English\n\nChannel, Leopold's cousin-- Queen\n\nVictoria-- a constitutional monarch\n\nlike himself, reigned over Great\n\nBritain-- the most powerful empire\n\nof the period.\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth\n\ncentury, King Leopold was\n\nbeleaguered by a Europe that was\n\nconfidently entering the modern\n\nage. A time of intense industrial\n\ngrowth and personal enrichment -for\n\none in the appropriate position….\n\nKing Leopold felt anxious when\n\nmonarchs and profiteers had cut\n\ntheir deals for colonies and\n\nfortunes.

But it's interesting to dig\n\ndeeper and to see- at what price.\n\nPRT 1-01:07:05:22\n\nNARRATOR\n\nBy 1838, Great Britain had severed\n\nthe long chains of slavery\n\nthroughout her empire, and by 1870,\n\nmost of the “unclaimed territories”\n\naround the world had been colonized\n\nby Leopold's European rivals.

It was ripe for conquest, or\n\n“Protection” as Leopold learned to\n\nput it.\n\nJAMES NEWMAN\n\n(GEOGRAPHER, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY)\n\nThe event that captured Leopold's\n\nattention was Stanley's crossing of\n\nAfrica from 1874 to 1877.

A colonial grab by Leopold\n\nwould require a cunning\n\n“humanitarian” veneer. To engineer\n\na charade of philanthropy, he\n\nrecruited Stanley, and financed\n\nwhat, to the world, was promoted as\n\na scientific expedition.\n\n6.\n\n(MORE)\n\nStanley's contract ran for five\n\nyears, at an annual salary equal to\n\na quarter of a million in today’s\n\ndollars. Leopold had begun to cut\n\nhis deal.\n\nJAMES NEWMAN\n\n(GEOGRAPHER, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY)\n\nStanley's job was to create at key\n\npoints along the Congo River a\n\nseries of stations that would\n\nconnect the east coast with the\n\nwest coast.\n\nMONTAGE: COLORFUL INDIGENOUS CONGOLESE PAINTINGS\n\nNARRATOR\n\nHe built not only a chain of\n\ntrading stations but also a road\n\naround the dangerous rapids of the\n\nCongo River - precursor to a\n\nrailway line.\n\n15 EXT: SATELLITE VIEW OF CONGO, MATADI - DAY 15\n\nJACQUES DEPELCHIN\n\n(HISTORIAN/ALLIANCE FOR PEACECONGO)\n\nIf you look at the map of Congo\n\ntoday, if you look at the structure\n\nof transport, it hasn't changed\n\nsince colonial rule. You can see\n\nthat it’s sort of heading toward\n\neither the east coast and then the\n\nwest, Matadi. So the entire\n\ninfrastructure was built, in a way,\n\nto ship out things, not to make the\n\nCongo a first rate industrial\n\npower.\n\nMONTAGE: SEQUENCE FROM 1939 FILM “STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE”\n\nWITH SPENCER TRACY\n\nADAM HOCHSCHILD\n\n(AUTHOR, KING LEOPOLD’S GHOST)\n\nStanley has been glamorized in\n\nbooks and by Hollywood as “an\n\nintrepid explorer”, “a great\n\nadventurer”, “a great builder”, but\n\nhe was no builder.

The army\n\nswept through the country, shooting\n\nelephants, buying tusks from\n\nvillagers or … just taking them.\n\nKING LEOPOLD II\n\nYou should purchase as much land,\n\nas you will be able to obtain\n\nwithout losing one minute... from\n\nall the chiefs from the mouth of\n\nthe Congo to Stanley Falls. I will\n\nsend you more people and more\n\nmaterial...perhaps Chinese Coolies?\n\nLetter to Stanley, 1881\n\nNARRATOR\n\nLeopold was adamant that his colonymaking\n\nbe perceived as\n\nphilanthropic. Leopold- the\n\nredeemer of a savage people. He\n\norganized his interests under the\n\nguise of charity and benefactions -\n\noften employing deceptive and\n\nmisleading Association names.\n\nM. LENAIN\n\n(COLONIAL ROYALIST, AFAC)\n\nHe asks of Stanley “You will\n\nadvance step by step and every time\n\nyou run into an indigenous chief\n\nyou sign a treaty with him. You'll\n\nbe under the flag of the\n\nIndependent State. Not the flag of\n\nBelgium.”\n\nPRT 1-01:12:14:00\n\n9.\n\nNARRATOR\n\nTo sign over one's land was\n\nunthinkable. But the Congo Chiefs,\n\nwith no written language, had no\n\nidea what they were signing. In\n\nreturn for cloth, trinkets, beads\n\nand gin, the Chiefs gave up rights\n\nto all land, waterways, game,\n\nfishing, forestry, mining...\n\nessentially everything.\n\nM.

Over\n\n900,000 square miles had become the\n\nprivate estate of King Leopold.\n\nCOLONEL MAXIMILIEN STRAUCH (KING’S AIDE)\n\nThere is no question of granting\n\nthe slightest political power to\n\nNegroes. That would be absurd. The\n\nwhite men, heads of the stations,\n\nretain all the powers.\n\nLetter to Stanley, undated\n\nMONTAGE: INDIGENOUS PAINTINGS\n\nNARRATOR\n\nLeopold maintained a complete\n\nmonopoly-even as he insisted that\n\nhe was opening up Africa to free\n\ntrade, and that his venture had no\n\ncommercial interest.\n\nCard:\n\n10.\n\n20 “INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE CONGO” 20\n\nHenry Shelton Sanford, U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, 1883\n\nPRT 1-01:14:00:02\n\nNARRATOR\n\nThe 1880s, in general, were\n\nprosperous times for the United\n\nStates. A time of accelerated\n\nproductivity and national\n\nindustrialization.

There are too many\n\nforces who have big stakes into\n\ngetting their hands onto those huge\n\nwealths which are there into the\n\nCongo.

The people who are\n\nthe victims are forced to bear the\n\nprovisioning of the armies who are\n\ntheir victimizers.
