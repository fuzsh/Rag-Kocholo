A society lady is quoted as describing the marriage of Leopold to Maria Henrietta as being 'like the marriage of a stable-boy to a nun', and by 'nun' she was not referring to the wife. It is said that, on a visit to London, the couple sought sex advice from Leopold's cousin Prince Albert and his wife Queen Victoria, who, we understand, were well-versed in conjugal happiness.  You can find more memorials to this much reviled royal at our Brussels website.
