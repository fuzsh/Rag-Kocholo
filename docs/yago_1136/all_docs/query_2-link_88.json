        "text": "Brussels, December 7, 1907.\n\nS ir: I have the honor to report that the treaty signed on November 28 by the representatives of the Government of Belgium and, on the other hand, by the representatives of the Independent State of the Congo was on December 3 laid before the Belgian House of Representatives, and was immediately referred by it to the special committee of seventeen, with instructions to examine the same in connection with the colonial law which this committee is now framing for submission to Parliament.\n\nI inclose herewith three copies of a pamphlet containing the “Exposé des Motifs “of the ministry, and the treaty with the project of law for its adoption, and the provisional arrangement.\n\nI also inclose an English translation of the three latter documents, and am outlining in what follows the substance of the “Exposé des Motifs.”\n\nThe minister opens his “Exposé des Motifs “by reference to the previous movements for the annexation of the Congo to Belgium; gives the history in detail of the various projects for annexation, and the apparently insurmountable difficulties which had prevented a solution of the problem, placed before a democratic State like Belgium, of exercising a beneficent sovereignty over vast, undeveloped territories and millions of uncivilized people, in a manner which would meet the approval of international and domestic opinion.\n\nThe minister then goes on to say that however truthful these views may have been in the past, they are not applicable to the present situation; that Belgium is now fully equal to the task of governing the Congo in such manner as will redound to the welfare of the native population, the development of the country, the prosperity of Belgium, and the approval of international opinion.\n\nHe then recalls and quotes at length from the report of the commission of inquiry appointed by the King in 1905 to investigate the conditions in the Congo.\n\nThis report has been made the subject of former dispatches from this legation, and is doubtless in the possession of the department.\n\nThe minister states that the Government of the Congo acted promptly upon the recommendations of the commission of inquiry, and gives specific instances of the reforms which had been carried out.\n\nAttention is then called to the very interesting and remarkable report of the special representatives of Belgium who were designated to study all questions relating to the transfer of the Congo sovereignty to Belgium.\n\nThis report deals with the economic, financial, and international situation, and also with the question of Crown Domain, or, as it is called, Foundations.\n\nIn the study made of the economic situation an examination is made of its real and personal assets. It finds that 170,000,000 francs ($34,000,000) have been invested in the country, and that the general trade in 1906 amounted to 106,483,058 francs ($21,290,000), of which 67,781,358 francs ($13,500,000) were exports and 29,700,700 francs ($5,900,000) were imports. Special trade amounted to 79,755,000 francs ($15,900,000), of which 58,278,000 francs ($11,600,000) were exports and 21,477,000 francs ($4,300,000) were imports.\n\nThe report then gives a summary of the organization and working of railway companies and of the proprietary corporations (Campagnie Bruxelloise pour le Commerce du Haut Congo, Compagnie du Katanga, Société d’Agriculture et de Plantations au Congo, Compagnie Anversoise de Plantations du Lubefu, and American Congo Company) and the concessionary societies (Compagnie du Kasai, Compagnie du Katanga, Abir, Société Anversoise, Société d’Agriculture et de Plantations, Comptoir Commercial Congolais, Compagnie du Haut Congo, Société Equatoriale Congolaise, American Congo Company, Société Forestière et Minière, Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the Great Lakes Railway, the Railway from the Lower Congo to the Katanga, the Whitely Concession, and the Forkel Concession).\n\nThis part of the report is supposed to be a complete exposition of the workings of the economic organization.\n\nAnother part of the report deals with the international questions of boundaries and neutrality and the modifications of the fiscal system growing out of various treaties.\n\nThe assets of the Congo State are found to be 120,000,000 francs ($24,000,000) and its liabilities 114,000,000 francs ($22,800,000).\n\nThe annual revenue resulting from proprietary concessions, bonds, stocks, etc., exceeds the liabilities, interest, and redemption charges by about 500,000 francs ($100,000).\n\nThe report sets forth that the Crown Domain, in common with the other territories subject to the sovereignty of the Independent State and to its laws, should, after annexation, be made subject to the sovereignty of Belgium and its laws.\n\nThe arrangements made in December, 1906, between the Congo State and the Crown Domain will insure to Belgium — in the event of annexation — property valued at 29,000,000 francs ($5,800,000), which, however, will carry with it the obligation of providing for the erection of hospitals, schools, and churches, and carrying on hygienic and philanthropic works.\n\nThe treaty is accompanied by numerous annexes containing an inventory of the assets, liabilities, and engagements of the Congo State. These have not yet been printed, as time is required for their examination and verification. They will eventually be transmitted to the department.\n\nHenry Lane Wilson.\n\nTranslation of treaty.\n\nThe sovereign king of the Congo having made known, by his letter of August 5, 1889, to the minister of finance of Belgium that if it were satisfactory to Belgium to conclude before the time fixed more close ties with his possessions in the Congo, His Majesty would not hesitate to place them at its disposal; and the two high contracting parties being found in agreement,\n\nThe following treaty has been concluded between the State of Belgium, represented by Mr. Julian Davignon, minister for foreign affairs; Mr. Jules de Trooz, minister of interior; Mr. Jules Renkin, minister of justice; Mr. Julien Liebaert, minister of finance; Baron Descamps, minister of sciences and art; Mr. Armand Hubert, minister of Industry and labor; Mr. Auguste Delbeke, minister of public works; Mr. George Helleputte, minister of railways, posts, and telegraphs, temporarily charged with the portfolio of agriculture; and Lieutenant-General Hollebaut, minister of war, acting under reserve of legislative approval,\n\nAnd the Independent State of the Congo, represented by Chevalier de Cuvelier, secretary-general of the department for foreign affairs; Mr. Hubert Droogmans, secretary-general of the department of finance; and Mr. Charles Liebrechts, secretary-general of the department of interior.\n\nArticle I.\n\nHis Majesty King Leopold II, sovereign of the Independent state, hereby cedes to Belgium the sovereignty of the territories composing the Independent Congo State, together with all the rights and obligations appertaining thereto. The Belgian State hereby accepts this cession, takes over and accepts the obligations of the Independent State as set forth in Schedule A, and undertakes to respect the existing interests in the Congo, together with the legally acquired rights of third parties, native and nonnative.\n\nArticle II.\n\nThe cession comprises all real and personal estate of the Independent Congo State, and particularly:\n\n1.The properties and all the lands belonging to its public and private domain, with reservation of the dispositions and obligations indicated in Schedule A of the present convention.2.All the shares and bonds and founder or interest shares mentioned in Schedule B.3.All the buildings, constructions, installations, plantations, and appropriations whatsoever, established or acquired in Africa and in Belgium by the Government of the Independent Congo State, personal goods of all kinds, and the cattle it possesses there, together with its pontoons and boats with their fittings and its military material, as described in Schedule B, Sections II and IV.4.The forests, rubber, and other African products which are the property of the Independent Congo State, as well as the provisions and other merchandise belonging to it, as described in Schedule B (I and III).\n\nArticle III.\n\nOn the other hand, the cession includes all the liabilities and all the financial engagements of the Independent State, as set out in Schedule C.\n\nArticle IV.\n\nThe date upon which Belgium will begin to exercise her right of sovereignty over the territories mentioned in the first article will be determined by royal decree. The revenue obtained and the expenses incurred by the Independent State from January 1, 1908, will be taken over by Belgium.\n\nIn witness whereof the plenipotentiaries have signed the present agreement and have affixed thereto their seals.\n\nDone in duplicate at Brussels this 28th day of November, 1907."
