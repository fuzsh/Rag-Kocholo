        "text": "King Leopold III, who was forced to abdicate to his son Baudouin in 1951 for surrendering to invading Nazi forces during World War II, died today after a heart attack, the royal palace announced. He was 81 years old.\n\nThe palace said the King died a few hours after emergency heart surgery by a team of Belgian and American doctors at a Brussels university hospital.\n\nThe royal palace communique said: ''His Majesty King Leopold III was urgently taken to the Louvain University Hospital in Brussels. He had a coronary bridging performed, aiming at correcting insufficient irrigation of the myocardium.'' The myocardium is the muscular substance of the heart.\n\n''A few hours after the operation, a failure of the myocardium occurred leading to death the same day,'' it said.\n\nLife Marked by Misfortune\n\nThe life of Leopold III, King of the Belgians, was marked by misfortune, from the early deaths of his father and first wife to his abdication because of alleged Nazi sympathies.\n\nKing Leopold ascended the throne in 1934 at the age of 32 after his father, King Albert I, was killed while mountain climbing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
