        "text": "Lesson 3 - The Scramble for Africa - Case studies in genocide - The Belgian Congo and German South West Africa\n\nThe Berlin conference of 1884-5 was to be a triumph for Leopold's colonial ambitions and his diplomacy. What happened next is the subject of a brilliant piece of 'journalistic' history writing by Adam Hochschild, 'King Leopold's Ghost'. ​\n\nLeopold's reign provided him with a vast personal fortune derived from rubber, ivory and minerals, which he used to build palaces and grand monuments in Brussels and other Belgian towns. Until fairly recently, his reputation amongst Belgians was still relatively positive, he is known as the 'builder king'. Until recently, when I first taught in Brussels in 2009, the city's African Museum was still largely a celebration of Belgium's colonial past. (see this NY Times article). Adam Hochschild's book has done much to upset that, the following short film extract is a useful summary of some of his main conclusions. And perhaps most importantly as we have already seen, the events of 2020 have changed things forever.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Leopold's mis-governance of the Congo was subject to one of the first successful international human rights campaigns. Believing in the king's humanitarian goals, many Christian missionaries were attracted to the 'mission' of the Congo. It was these missionaries who first raised the alarm about the atrocities being committed.\n\nIn 1890, the black American activist George Washington Williams wrote an open letter to Leopold condemning his rule, but it took the work of the Anglo-French journalist E. D. Morel to launch a campaign. In the late 1890s, Morel had investigated the imports and exports in to the Congo and had concluded that Leopold's Congo was a mere front for economic exploitation and slave labour. In 1903, the British government commissioned the civil servant Roger Casement to investigate the accusations, which he was able to confirm.\n\nThe Congo Reform Association.\n\nTogether in 1904 Morel and Casement established ​Congo Reform Association (CRA). The group carried out the first modern global publicity campaign that highlighted the abuses of Leopold's regime and called for international intervention. A number of famous writers helped in the campaign including Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness) and Mark Twain (Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn) who were in turn able to make use of the photographs of the English missionary Alice Seeley Harris (1870-1970).\n\nThis infamous photograph taken by Seeley Harris shows the severing of hands. In 1904, two native men arrived at her mission explaining that their village had been attacked by the Belgian rubber company for failing to produce enough rubber. One of the men, Nsala, showed her the severed hand and foot of a child. Sentries had killed and mutilated his wife and daughter. Seeley Harris persuaded Nsala to pose with his child's remains on the veranda of her home for a picture. She was to take many more pictures of the mutilations.\n\nBy 1908, public and diplomatic pressure led to Leopold II being forced to give up control of the Congo to the Belgian state. He received significant financial compensation, was never put on trial and died the next year.\n\nActivity 2 - A source analysis activity\n\nSource A - International Bulletin of Missionary Research published in 2002\n\nMonthly quotas were set for each village. Failure to meet these quotas would lead to sanctions of varying severity. First there was beating with the chikoti, a painful whip made of hippopotamus hide; then women were held hostage and sometimes raped to ensure that their husbands harvested rubber.. Since European company officials seldom ventured far beyond the main towns, a grotesque culture grew up for ensuring both that the requisite punishments had been carried out and that the forest guards had used their bullets \"officially\" on humans, rather than for shooting game for their own pots*. To be certain about the use of bullets, the guards were instructed to cut off the right hand of each person they killed and return it to the European officials, who would tally the hands against the number of bullets used….In fact, as many of Alice Harris's photographs later showed, clever forest guards would simply cut off the hands from living people and save their cartridges for other purposes.\n\n1. According to Source A why did the Belgian 'forest guards' cut off the hands of living people? Hint to 'save their cartridges for other purposes.' is not a full explanation.\n\n*Game refers to wild animals that are hunted for food and put in cooking 'pots'.\n\n4. Compare and contrast Sources C and D as evidence about King Leopold's motivation. It is important that you find similarities as well as differences between the sources.\n\nCase study 2 - German South West Africa.\n\nThis is even less well known than the atrocities committed in the Congo Free State.\n\n​German interest in south west Africa dated back to missionary settlements established in the 1840s. The German claims on this land were confirmed during the Conference of Berlin in 1885 and a private company was established to mine for mineral deposits, including diamonds gold, copper and platinum. In 1890 the colony was declared a German Crown Colony and troops were sent. German South West Africa was the only German colony in which Germans settled in large numbers. In 1902 the colony had 200,000 inhabitants, although only 2,595 were recorded as German, there were in addition smaller numbers of Afrikaans and British. There were probably around 80,000 Herero, 60,000 Ovambo, and 10,000 Nama, who were referred to as Hottentots.\n\nThe first phase of the genocide was characterized by widespread death from starvation and dehydration, due to the prevention of the Herero from leaving the Namib Desert by German forces. Once defeated, thousands of Hereros and Namas were imprisoned in concentration camps, where the majority died of diseases, abuse, and exhaustion.\n\nActivity 3\n\nRead the text above and ideally also watch the (excellent) documentary which is a very powerful presentation about a little known event. Write a short set of revision notes that you would be able to use in an oral exam when asked to give an example of the negative consequences of imperialism in Africa. Think about the main causes, events and consequences of the German colonisation of South West Africa."
