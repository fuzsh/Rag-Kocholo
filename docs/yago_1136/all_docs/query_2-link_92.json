        "text": "By JOHN CHAMBERLAIN\n\nLEOPOLD THE UNLOVED\n\nBy Ludwig Bauer\n\nention the name of Leopold II of Belgium to those who were old enough to read the newpapers of 1903 and you will doubless get a single universal answer: \"Oh, yes the Congo atrocities.\" Such is the epitaph in the minds of living men for the subject of Ludwig Bauer's remarkable biography, \"Leopold the Unloved\". And Leopold fully deserves the opprobrium of such and epitaph.\n\nBut if Leopold was a hateful creature, he cannot be righteously dismissed as an inexplicable monster who, out of sheer malice, capriciously ground the Negro population of the Belgian Congo under his heel that he might extract colossal wealth form the wild rubber of darkest Africa. Leopold was not a \"sport\" of nature; he was a typical man of his century, one in where dominant characteristics of an epoch were heightened and caricatured. Many men who hated him, who saw him a moral leper, shared all of his fundamental beliefs, were unconscious perpetrators of all the hypocrisies by which Leopold openly profited. The difference between Leopold and many other men of his time was, mainly, one of intellectual ruthlessness; Leopold did not compartmentalize his mind; he was not a Friday skinflint and a Sunday deacon. Although fate and persistence of his Coburg father, the first Leopold, had made him King over a tiny buffer country, he wanted to be rich and powerful, and the means by which he as to attain both riches and power were immaterial. Materialist and cynic, he believed in the solid substance of property and the rule of the strong.\n\nMaintaining Leopold.\n\nVirtually all of the creative forces of the nineteenth century combined to help Leopold in his quest. That he might entertain his mistresses in his palm garden by the North Sea and build his solid, tasteless buildings in Brussels and elsewhere, Christian missionaries took the Bible to deepest Africa, explorers such as Henry Morton Stanley risked life and health to fill in the blank spaces on the map, the lower middle classes saved their pennies, and the savage population of the Congo region was cut in half during the twenty-five-odd years of Leopold's exploitation of the wild rubber trees of equatorial Africa. the missionaries had no professed interest in four hundred gold millions that Leopold took out of the Congo fifteen years, and the explorers, most of them naive men of science, did not foresee the atrocities that their disinterested enterprise would make possible. And while the savages sometimes callously ate each other before Leopold forced them to work for Belgian masters, they managed to remain alive in larger numbers in the days when the missionary and the rubber gatherer were unknown in the Congo forests.\n\nLeopold II, Herr Bauer tells us , was the most dangerous of men, the genius who was willing to have his abilities remain anonymous. Leopold managed to pick up the Congo by making a virtue of weaknesses. He began by operating in a twilight zone, by organizing a sort of philanthropical society know as the Association Internationale Africaine. He hired Stanley, the first man to follow the Congo from source to mouth, to work for this society. All of this officially had nothing to do with Belgium, but the fact that Leopold was Belgium's King invested the A.I.A. with a sanctity, none the less. Leopold got France to recognize the sovereignty in the Congo of the A.I.A. by promising the territory to France should the A.I.A. decamp. And he hung on to the Congo because Bismark didn't want France to get it, and because England, with her hands full in Egypt and elsewhere, wasn't ready to take it when Stanley first came out of the jungle.\n\nEnds Agains the Middle.\n\nHow the A.I.A. eventually shed it philanthropic skin and became a company for the exploration of the rubber resources of the region, and how Belgium, which didn't want the Congo, was eventually compelled to inherit the \"Congo Free State\" from Leopold, all goes to make up a fascinating story of intrigue, duplicity, invisible manipulation and the playing of all ends and sides against the middle, Leopold sent out no explorers of his own , no colonists of his own, raised no money to outfit expeditions , maintained no colonial armies and no navies, had no nation actually behind him, yet he got the Congo, made a fortune out of the Congo and compelled the unwilling Belgian nation to take the Congo after he had sucked it dry.\n\nWhile \"Leopold the Unloved\" is in bulk the story of a phase of the nineteenth century \"partition of Africa\" with all that this implied, it is also important for the light it brings to bear on the remarkable rise of the House of Coburg in the nineteenth century. When the Napoleonic era was in full insurgence, the Coburgs were petty German princes. Before the century had ended, the Coburgs had had a hand in ruling over many, many square mile. The mother of Queen Victoria of England was a Coburg ; Prince Albert was one too, and Charlotte, wife of the ill-fated Maximillion of Mexico, was Leopolds II's sister. Stephanie, one of Leopold's daughters, was married to the Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Dynastic ambitions brought many of the Coburgs no happiness, but Leopold I, who had been made sovereign of the newly independent Belgium in 1820 because of his \"availability,\" was not a man to think in terms of happiness. Leopold I believed in family, in influence; he saved money, he cultivated his friends, he pushed into crevices here and bluffed his way there. Herr Bauer, although he does not give his biography and psycoanalytic trappings, makes one believe that Leopold II's carving for power and influence was chiefly due to and emotional need to eclipse his father.\n\nStanley and the Congo.\n\nIt would not be too much to say that the reader who masters the many implications of \"Leopold the Unloved\" will know all there is to know, fundamentally, about the nineteenth century. But \"Leopold the Unloved\" doesn't have to be read for its sociological import; it may also be read, in part for pure excitement. The story of how Henry M. Stanley traveled from Zanzibar to the Atlantic Coast will always be a classic of exploration, and Herr Bauer, ably assisted by his translators, Eden and Cedar Paul, does not let the reader down in this latest version of the exploit."
