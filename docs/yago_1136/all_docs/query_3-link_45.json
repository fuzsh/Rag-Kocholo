        "text": "Belgian literature is inherently multilingual and multicultural. The majority of works are written in either Dutch or French, however, some are published in other regional languages and dialects like Walloon. Books from Belgium continue to have a powerful influence on both the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities worldwide. When researching the country of Belgium using the collections at the Library of Congress, the selected books listed below are a great place to start. Reference assistance can be found by visiting the European Reading Room, part of the Latin American, Caribbean & European Division (LAC&E).\n\nThe following selection of books in French, Dutch, and English offers general reference to the study of the history and culture of Belgium. It includes, but is not limited to, works that focus on domestic politics, colonialism and post-colonialism, gastronomy, art, World War I and II, medieval history, celebrated cultural figures, and Flemish and Wallonian identity. A selection of contemporary and award-winning novelists are included to round out the coverage- from memoirs to thrillers-demonstrating the unique talents of Flemish and French authors such as Annelies Verbeke and Marguerite Yourcenar. They are grouped into the categories of History & Politics, Art & Culture, Biography & Memoir and Fiction. More books about Belgium, and by Belgian authors can be found in the section on Francophone Studies under Europe. Although most of these books are in English or are translations of Belgian books, searching with a limit by \"language\" can retrieve these and other books in French or Dutch. Books, newspapers and serials are all considered part of the General Collections at the Library of Congress. The General Collections are housed in all three buildings of the Library: the Thomas Jefferson building, the John Adams building, and the James Madison building. Monographs can be ordered from any reading room in the Library, but newspapers and serials must be ordered in the Newspaper and Current Periodical Reading Room located in the James Madison building."
