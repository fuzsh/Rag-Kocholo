But his great thoughts, when he wielded money as an instrument, were more often than not for himself, but for his country. The Congo, no matter what Morel thought, brought him nothing personally. He drew money from the Congo, but he used it almost exclusively to enrich the national heritage, through real estate acquisitions, monumental constructions, and urban planning.

In Congo, brutal and extensive forced labor started under King Leopold II in the last century. So many Congolese were killed and maimed by Leopold’s officials and police that this earned European disapproval even in the midst of the general pattern of colonial outrages. When Leopold handed over the “Congo Free State” to the Belgian government in 1908, he had already made a huge fortune; and the Belgian government hardly relaxed the intensity of exploitation in Congo.\n\nWalter Rodney, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa.

In Belgium there is still a taboo on that subject, the place of Leopold II is in the museum, provided with the necessary explanation.\n\nPrincess Esmeralda: Leopold II belongs in the museum\n\nThe colonial past has never been discussed in a transparent and systematic manner in Belgium. Many historians have certainly studied the subject, but at the political level the theme has been very little addressed, if not avoided. And the biggest gap is in education. Our 21st century multicultural society needs to know the facts, not the myths passed down from generation to generation. The detachment of the statues of Leopold II is part of a desire to purge a past partisan by the settlers, without regard for the colonized population and their suffering.\n\nPrincess Esmeralda: Leopold II belongs in the museum\n\nThe economic crisis which weighs on Europe since the industry took such a big development, carries the nations towards the colonial companies.

The first official acknowledgment of the new State came from the United States in the spring of 1884. It was afterwards formally recognised by other nations, and it entered the Berlin Conference on equality with the other Powers. It has never placed itself under the guardianship of any Power or collection of Powers. It has no connection with Belgium except that King Leopold II happens to be king of each of them.\n\nMr. James G. Whiteley (member of the Institute of International Law) Quoted from \"Glance at the Past, Page19, MÉMOIRES DU CONGO Asbl, Chaleroi\n\nThere have been cases in which the natives have been maltreated by minor officials, but these are isolated cases, and are severely punished by the authorities. Such cases have occurred in all public services where an attempt has been made to govern inferior races. Such things have happened in the Philippines, in British Africa, and in India. No colonising nation can cast a stone at King Leopold on that score. Among a large number of officials scattered over a vast territory there will often be one or two wicked stewards who despitefully use the natives. All that any State can do is to keep vigilant watch and to punish the wrongdoers, and this the Congo State has done. It has even established a Commission for the protection of the natives. By the decree of 1896, this Commission consisted of seven members, three being Catholic priests and four Protestant missionaries.\n\nMr. James G. Whiteley (member of the Institute of International Law) Quoted from \"Glance at the Past, Page20, MÉMOIRES DU CONGO Asbl, Chaleroi\n\nThe committee is to travel throughout the country into all the districts covered by Mr Casement in his recent tour of inspection, besides visiting many places Mr Casement never saw. In brief, the committee is to hold inquiry wherever evidence can be obtained. Where native witnesses give evidence of a nature prejudicial to white men, the committee will see that such witnesses are protected from the possibility of suffering at the hands of officials against whom they may bear witness. The Government of the Congo holds itself responsible for the safety and well-being of such witnesses. On the latter point King Leopold has expressed himself in the strongest possible terms.\n\nMr. Henry Wellington Wack (American attorney) in 'The Story of the Congo Free State' 1905, Quoted from \"Glance at the Past, Page32, MÉMOIRES DU CONGO Asbl, Chaleroi\n\nThere were severed hands in the Congo, at the time of the Independent State... by the Officers of the Force Publique, to prevent the waste of ammunition to which their soldiers willingly let go, demanded that they provide proof that they had used their cartridges correctly. The proof was the severed hand of the killed enemy ... Severed hands, it will be noted, never constituted a form of punishment. ... By emphasizing, as they did, on the theme of severed hands - a theme which, we realize, easily provoked emotion -, Morel and his friends gave birth to the ambiguity which finally spread and lasted until our days: the idea that Leopold II had his hands cut off in the Congo, that it was a question of torture inflicted on the population, and even of torture most characteristic of the regime.\n\nMr. Jean Stengers (history teacher) in 'Congo - Mythes et Réalités' ISBN:9782873865177 2007, Quoted from \"Glance at the Past, Page 41, MÉMOIRES DU CONGO Asbl, Chaleroi\n\nI did not fail to refer to the \"abuses and other undeniable deficiencies that this report rightly stigmatizes. Leopold II, of course, also carefully read this report. He reacted to it very quickly, with an honesty, insight and efficiency worthy of this visionary King. Despite the damning conclusions, he did not hesitate to have it published - in extenso - in the Official Journal of the EIC (Independent State of Congo). He had the perpetrators of the abuses prosecuted and, above all, taken a series of radical measures to put an end to them, by issuing no less than 24 Decrees to this effect.\n\nMr. André de MAERE d’AERTRYCKE (former Territory Administrator) Quoted from \"Glance at the Past, Page 44, MÉMOIRES DU CONGO Asbl, Chaleroi\n\nSeldom has such a character assassination been committed in Belgium, seldom has the press reached such lows as in the time of Leopold II.\n\nProf. Idesbald Goddeeris in a review of the new biography of Leopold II.

No state would be willing to spend the money spent by the King of the Belgians and Belgium in the most dark places of darkest Africa. When I consider the few years that have passed since the Congo became a state, I believe that the work accomplished is a great honor to Belgium. You can be sure that the King of the Belgians is interested in every detail of his administration. I do not claim that he can monitor all the actions of each individual, what Government could? The stories of the atrocities that have been spread are almost all gossip. The English note of month of August is based on biased reports. I am convinced that Leopold II has been doing his best to prevent any crime in the Congo, he is not responsible for the crimes anymore that could be committed there than those that are sometimes committed in Belgium. The reason of all these slanders? Jealousy! The Congo is doing better than any other African state. Those stories of atrocities will not stop, they will persist with the little basis they had, this was never anything but pure invention.\n\nPierre Vercauteren: A king unjustly maligned.

That action should tend to close all foreign slave markets and should also result in putting down slave hunting in the interior. The great work undertaken by the King of the Belgians, in the constitution of the Congo State, and the lively interest taken by His Majesty in all questions affecting the welfare of the African races, lead Her Majesty's Government to hope that Belgium will be disposed to take the initiative in inviting the Powers to meet in Conference at Brussels, in order to consider the best means of attaining the gradual suppression of the slave-trade on the Continent of Africa and the immediate closing of all the outside markets which the slave-trade daily continues to supply.\n\nNew Africa; an essay on government civilization in new countries, and on the foundation, organization and administration of the Congo Free State, THE BRUSSELS CONFERENCE, Page 141.

The Short Colonial Careers of Jules Greindl, Eugène père Beyens, Eugène Napoléon Beyens and Maximilien Strauch, Eugène Napoléon Beyens (1855-1934) Eugène Napoléon Beyens himself had a modest share in the creation of the Congo Free State. Shortly after 1883 he was in charge of private correspondence about the Congo. As a youngster he received this assignment, perhaps because Leopold II realized that the advisers associated with his 'Maison Civile' had little interest in those adventures. “Souvenirs sur Léopold II et la cour de Belgique.”, 545.\n\nBy the end of 1892, all the King's collaborators during the first and second phases of Belgian work in the Congo had therefore ceased to participate.

He gave Congo its shape and dimensions, as well as a financial-capitalist structure. However, the debt burden that had become too heavy meant that the king handed over his colony to Belgium, a gift that the parliament was hesitant about but did not dare to refuse.\n\nManu Ruys' far-reaching view of Congo over the period 1958-2000.

The borders that have been, since 1894, the crucible of Congolese identity were acquired, by treaty, by Leopold II. Thus, Congo has absolutely no debt to Belgium for its international existence. Later, it was through a bilateral treaty, between two sovereign states, regularly ratified, that the Kingdom of Belgium became the metropolis of the Belgian Congo (1908-1960). The little-known truth is that in 1960, Belgium did not grant Congolese independence, but it returned it.\n\nThe Greatest Fake News of All Time: Leopold II, the Genius and Builder King of Lumumba, Chapter: A Story never told before, page 28, Marcel Yabili, Lubumbashi, AFNIL, 2021.

While the conference was still in session, Leopold invited Stanley to Belgium for a week. Stanley spoke to the delegates,and Leopold presented him with the Grand Cross of the Congo, arranged a banquet and a gala opera performance in his honor,and put him up in the gilt and scarlet rooms at the Royal Palace normally reserved for visiting royalty. In return, Stanley praised his host to the Belgians in a speech.\n\nAs a constitutional monarch, Leopold II had no possibility of becoming a tyrant in Belgium. He could dismiss Parliament, but had to sign the bills it submitted to him, and to rule in consultation with his ministers. He did not even have a coronation, but an inauguration where he swore before Parliament to obey the Constitution. Yet Leopold had tremendous ambitions. He dreamed of a Belgium that could stand among the European powers, and for that he deemed colonies a necessity. By clever and stealthy means, he managed to gain control of a vast realm in Africa, the Congo, much of which became his personal property. Here, he indulged his desire for profit by exploiting the native population more ferociously than anyone before him. His excesses finally became so notorious that Belgium took control of the colony, giving the country the empire Leopold desired, but also blackening his memory.\n\nClive Foss, The Tyrants: 2500 Years of Absolute Power and Corruption, London: Quercus Publishing, 2006, ISBN 1905204965, p. 116\n\nBy 1891, six years into the attempt to build the EIC, the whole project was on the verge of bankruptcy. It would have been easy for Léopold to raise revenues by sanctioning imports of liquor that could be taxed or by levying fees on the number of huts in each village, both of which would have caused harm to the native population. A truly “greedy” king, as Hochschild repeatedly calls him, had many fiscal options that Léopold did not exercise.\n\nProf. Bruce Gilley, King Hochschild’s Hoax, The American Conservative, 17 april, 2023.\n\nThe abuses were first reported by an American missionary in The Times of London in 1895 and quickly brought Léopold’s censure: “If there are these abuses in the Congo, we must stop them,” he warned EIC officials in 1896. “If they continue, it will be the end of the state.” For the next ten years, reforming the Congo’s rubber industry absorbed an inordinate amount of attention in the British and American press and legislatures, not to mention within Belgium and the EIC itself, leading to formal Belgian colonization in 1908. Hochschild thus takes a very limited, unintentional, unforeseen, and perhaps unavoidable problem of native-on-native conflict over rubber harvesting and blows it up into a “forgotten Holocaust” to quote the subtitle given to the French edition of his book. Inside this great invention are many more perfidious Russian dolls.\n\nProf. Bruce Gilley, King Hochschild’s Hoax, The American Conservative, 17 april, 2023.\n\nHow can we explain the fact that Leopold II distinguished between his personality as the assignee of the removed Crown Foundation assets and the Free State, to the point that he felt he had to transfer all or part of these assets to the Free State, by a subsequent formal provision of the decree? In the simplest way in the world. By the fact that the King, who had only rather vague notions on the exact legal scope of his sovereignty, believed in the possibility of a disjunction, a duality between the absolute state that was the Congo Free State and the personality of his sovereign, whereas such a disjunction was contrary to the most elementary principles of public law.\n\nCour d’appel [CA] [Court of Appeals] Bruxelles, Plaidoirie de Me Eugène Hanssens, avocat de la cour d’appel de Bruxelles pour l’état belge intimé, contre S.A.R. la princesse Louise de Belgique et S.A.R. la princesse Stéphanie de Belgique, Comtesse Lyonay appelantes at 60 (Belg.)
