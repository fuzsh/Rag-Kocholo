        "text": "Queen of the Belgians as the wife of King Leopold II, Marie Henriette Anne (1836-1902) was Archduchess of Austria. She was born in Buda Castle, Buda, Kingdom of Hungary, in the Austrian Empire. She married Leopold II of Belgium in 1853 one day before her 17th birthday when he was aged 18.\n\nThe marriage was arranged to strengthen the status of the Belgian Monarchy. Henriette was a vivid and energetic person interested in riding horses. She is said to have had a terrible temperament resulting in an unhappy marriage. The marriage resulted in the couple living more or less separate lives. She became queen in 1865 and four years later when their son died, the couple separated completely.\n\nHer main interest in life was her Hungarian horses since she lived most of her life unhappy and discontented. In 1895, she retreated to Spa, a Belgian town located in the Liege Province, a town where the word spa originated.\n\nHer youngest daughter Clementine replaced her as the first lady of the Court in Brussels for the remainder of her husband’s life. She died at the ‘Hotel du Midi’ (English: Hotel South) in Spa.\n\nHer husband later married his mistress Caroline Delacroix, although this was illegal under Belgian law."
