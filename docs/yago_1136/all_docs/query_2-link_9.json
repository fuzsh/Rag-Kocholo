        "text": "(1835–1909). King of Belgium from 1865 to 1909, Leopold II was interested above all in acquiring colonies in Africa. In 1885 he became the ruler of the Congo Free State, a vast territory in the Congo River basin of central Africa. His regime aroused international outrage for its brutal treatment of the Congolese.\n\nLeopold was born in Brussels, Belgium, on April 9, 1835. He was the eldest son of Leopold I, the first king of Belgium, and his second wife, Marie-Louise of Orléans. The younger Leopold became duke of Brabant in 1846 and served in the Belgian army. In 1853 he married Maria Henrietta, daughter of the Austrian archduke Joseph, palatine (imperial governor) of Hungary. He became king of the Belgians on his father’s death in December 1865.\n\nIn 1876 Leopold founded the International African Association to encourage exploration of the African continent. After hearing the explorer Henry Morton Stanley tell of the Congo region, Leopold eagerly commissioned Stanley to survey the area and sign treaties with the local peoples. The king then claimed the territory, known as the Congo Free State, and made himself sovereign. The chief industry was wild rubber production, which depended on forced labor from the Congolese people. The abuses of the Congolese were eventually brought to public attention, and as a result the area was annexed by the government and made a Belgian colony in 1908. Today this land makes up the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
