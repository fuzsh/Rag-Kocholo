        "text": "(ABC 6 News) — Applications are now open for a $24 million emergency aid package aimed at bolstering rural ambulance services across Minnesota.\n\nThe package targets providers making 30 or fewer trips per square mile in their primary service area.\n\n“Our rural EMS services cover large but sparsely populated areas. This means fewer ambulance calls and longer ambulance rides leading to persistent sustainability challenges. Outstate services have struggled for years to recruit and retain staff, and service directors told us that they were not earning enough revenue to cover costs.” Senator Carla Nelson (R-Rochester) said via a press release. “This funding is a step in the right direction to keep these crucial services up and running for everyone.”\n\nThe funding, approved by legislators in the final days of the 2024 legislative session, offers a lifeline to struggling providers facing a deepening crisis in the state’s rural areas. Some of the providers eligible for this funding are as follows:\n\nCity of Altura\n\nCity of Blooming Prairie\n\nCity of Bricelyn\n\nCity of Caledonia\n\nCity of Cannon Falls\n\nCity of Chatfield\n\nCity of Dodge Center\n\nCity of Elgin\n\nCity of Freeborn\n\nCity of Grand Meadow\n\nCity of Harmony\n\nCity of Hayfield\n\nCity of Kiester\n\nCity of Lake City\n\nCity of Lewiston\n\nCity of Mabel\n\nCity of Minnesota Lake\n\nCity of New Richland\n\nCity of Preston\n\nCity of Red Wing\n\nCity of Rushford\n\nCity of Spring Valley\n\nCity of Wabasha\n\nAdams Area Ambulance Service Joint Powers Board\n\nEllendale Ambulance Service\n\nEyota Volunteer Ambulance Service Inc.\n\nFrost Area Ambulance\n\nGundersen Lutheran Health System Inc.\n\nHouston Community Ambulance\n\nLeroy Area Ambulance Council\n\nNorth Memorial Health Care\n\nNorthfield Hospital & Clinics\n\nSpring Grove Ambulance Inc.\n\nWells Community Ambulance Service\n\nWest Concord Fire and Ambulance Service\n\nWinona Health\n\nZumbrota Area Ambulance Association\n\nThe EMS aid package also includes a sprint medic pilot program. The program will help connect Minnesotans to care more quickly and ensure the correct level of care is provided.\n\nEligible ambulance services have until September 16, 2024, to apply."
