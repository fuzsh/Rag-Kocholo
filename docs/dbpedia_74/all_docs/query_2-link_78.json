        "text": "Supercell thunderstorms developed across southern Minnesota during the afternoon of Thursday June 17th producing tornadoes and large hail initially. These storms then developed a line of damaging wind gusts that moved through parts of Rochester, MN and eventually grew to produce strong to severe winds across much of southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and into western Wisconsin into the evening hours. There were numerous reports of 60 to 80 mph winds with trees down, power lines down, and building damage.\n\nThe worst wind damage occurred in two swaths. The first went from near Rochester (or Byron, MN) east to Winona and into rural areas of Buffalo and Trempealeau Counties in western Wisconsin. Another path of strong to damaging winds moved across northern Iowa and into southwest Wisconsin that led to sporadic damage and winds up to 70 mph.\n\nNational Weather Service staff members surveyed damage and determined there were at least four tornadoes.\n\n1) The first tornado was on the ground in eastern Steele Co., MN north of Blooming Prairie and crossed briefly into Dodge County southwest of Claremont. It was rated an EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Damage about 2 miles southeast of Claremont was caused by this same storm but was determined to only be downburst related (straight-line wind).\n\n2) The second tornado also formed in Steele County and tracked into rural parts of southwestern Dodge County, MN, northeast of Blooming Prairie. It was rated an EF2 in Steele County but only produced EF1 damage in Dodge County. Damage near County Roads 3 and 4 included partially torn off roofs and blown down trees. The width of the small tornado was less than 100 feet.\n\nMap showing EF1 tornado path in rural Dodge County, MN. (Click on image to enlarge)\n\n3) Another tornado struck northwest Rochester, MN around 9:00 p.m. CDT as the thunderstorms transitioned into a line of damaging wind. The tornado, rated an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, produced intermittent damage starting near 50th Ave NW and traveled northeast behind the Wal-Mart shopping center near 55th Street NW. It tracked across Highway 52 and hit a Menards building before continuing northeast and dissipating a few minutes later. The path length of the tornado was around 2 miles long with a maximum width of 150 yards. This was the first tornado to hit the city of Rochester since 1995.\n\nMap showing EF1 tornado path in northwest Rochester, MN. (Click on image to enlarge)\n\n4) A brief tornado touched down just west of Cream, WI (Buffalo County) and produced EF1 damage (95-100 mph) with a path width of about 75 yards. Numerous trees were sheared off and there was building damage in the area. The tornado tracked for about 2 miles, lifting about a mile east of Cream with a bulk of the speeds in the EF0 range (less than 88 mph).\n\nMap showing EF1 tornado path near Cream, WI.
