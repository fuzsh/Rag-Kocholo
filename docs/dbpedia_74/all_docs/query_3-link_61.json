The project, known as the Midwest Carbon Express, is the main pipeline in the overall project proposed by Summit Carbon.\n\nRegarding Docket No. HLP-2021-0001, over 34 months the IUC:\n\nconducted 33 public informational meetings\n\nreceived approximately 50,000 pages of prefiled testimony and exhibits from hundreds of witnesses and landowners\n\nheld a public hearing over 25 days\n\naccepted more than 150 intervenors into the docket\n\nheard testimony at hearing from more than 200 witnesses and landowners\n\nreviewed nearly 7,500 pages of hearing transcript, and\n\nreviewed almost 4,200 written comments, including 600 filed after the deadline set by Iowa law.\n\nFinal Decision and Order issued\n\nHaving reviewed the record, the IUB issued its Final Decision and Order in Docket No. HLP-2021-0001 on June 25, 2024. Read the complete order.\n\nThe order begins with an executive summary:\n\nOn January 28, 2022, Summit Carbon Solutions, LLC (Summit Carbon), filed its petition, as revised, to construct, operate, and maintain approximately 688.01 miles of hazardous liquid pipeline through 29 Iowa counties. The hearing regarding Summit Carbon’s petition occurred in Fort Dodge, Iowa, beginning on August 22 and concluding on November 8, 2023. During the hearing, the Board admitted tens of thousands of pages of testimony and exhibits, heard testimony from more than 200 witnesses, and admitted approximately 4,180 comments, objections, and letters of support filed in the docket, including approximately 600 comments filed after the deadline set by Iowa law.\n\nAfter weighing numerous factors for and against Summit Carbon’s petition, the Board found that the service to be provided by Summit Carbon will promote the public convenience and necessity. The Board found Summit Carbon could be vested with the right of eminent domain and, based upon this finding, the Board examined each of the 859 outstanding parcels subject to a request for eminent domain to determine, based upon the record, whether to approve, deny, or modify each request.\n\nAdditionally, as part of the order, Summit Carbon will be required to submit numerous revised exhibits as compliance filings for the Board’s review, prior to the Board issuing the permit or Summit Carbon commencing construction. Several conditions will be attached to the permit as well, including but not limited to requiring Summit Carbon to obtain and maintain at least a $100 million insurance policy, comply with certain construction methods, and ensure landowners and tenants are compensated for damages that may result from the construction of Summit Carbon’s hazardous liquid pipeline.\n\nIncluded with the order, Board Chair Helland issued a concurrence in part and dissent in part in which he agreed with all of the findings and conclusions except for a condition that prohibits Summit Carbon from beginning construction until it has obtained agency-level approval for a route and sequestration site in North Dakota and a route in South Dakota. Board Chair Helland stated he would not have placed this condition on the permit as it gives away the Board’s authority to another jurisdiction, contrary to the duties assigned to the Board by the Iowa Legislature.\n\nBoard Member Byrnes issued a concurrence in part and dissent in part in which he agreed with all of the findings and conclusions except for the approval of the lateral between the Quad County Corn Processors, Inc., facility in Ida County, Iowa, and the Green Plains Shenandoah facility in Fremont County, Iowa. Board Member Byrnes stated he does not find that portion of the route to be just and proper after weighing the evidence.\n\nThe concurrences in part and dissents in part do not impact the findings and conclusions of the order as all three Board members find the proposed service provided by Summit Carbon is in the public convenience and necessity and vest Summit Carbon with the right of eminent domain.\n\nNOTE: The purpose of the executive summary is to provide readers a brief summary of the decision. While the executive summary reflects the order, it shall not be considered to limit, define, amend, or otherwise affect in any manner the body of the order, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPipeline Permit Process\n\nThe IUC has authority over the routing and siting of hazardous liquid pipelines in Iowa. When a company wants to build a pipeline to transport a hazardous liquid, it must first get a permit from the IUC. Requirements can be found in Iowa Code chapter 479B. Public informational meetings are the first step in the process. A company cannot file an application until at least 30 days after an informational meeting has been held in the affected county.\n\nComments, objections, and letters of support\n\nYou may submit information in any open docket by one of these methods:\n\nOnline - Use the IUC’s Open Docket Comment Form.
