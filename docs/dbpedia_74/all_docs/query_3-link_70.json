        "text": "Olsson announced today that it will build a 4-story office building in west Omaha. The engineering and design firm will be the anchor tenant of The Row, part of the 500-acre Heartwood Preserve development near 144th & West Dodge Road. The project is being developed in partnership with Lanoha Real Estate Company.\n\n“This building is a testament to Olsson’s long record of growth in Omaha,” said Brian Chaffin, Olsson’s North Central geography leader. “It’s an exciting step forward and a symbol of our commitment to the Omaha community.”\n\nThe Row will be a national-caliber, 40-acre, mixed-use center featuring Class-A office space, luxury multifamily residential, walkable retail and dining experiences, a full-service hotel, and structured parking.\n\nMost of Olsson’s 300-plus Omaha employees are currently based in its Aksarben Village office. The firm has more than 2,000 employees in offices throughout the United States. Olsson expects to move its Omaha workforce into the new office in summer 2026.\n\n“Olsson’s move to The Row at Heartwood Preserve shows business growth and development has great momentum in Omaha,” said Jean Stothert, mayor of Omaha. “I am excited to see Olsson and Lanoha partnering to accelerate that momentum with this important project in one of the city’s premier west Omaha locations.”\n\nAs the centerpiece of Heartwood Preserve, The Row is sited strategically within the larger master plan with convenient connections to 80 acres of parks and open space, eight miles of paths and trails, single-family and multifamily homes, additional retail and office, and an assisted living facility.\n\nOlsson will occupy the second and third floors of its four-story building. The first floor will be reserved for retail. Olsson may eventually expand to the fourth floor. Employees will have access to attached parking via a skywalk.\n\n“Our move will create an even better work environment for our employees,” said Scott Tricker, Olsson’s Omaha local area leader. “The new building will help us showcase our welcoming culture and allow us to continue to attract and retain top talent.”\n\nNelsen Partners is the architect for the building, with Olsson delivering the full complement of engineering services. More details and renderings will be released as the building’s design is finalized. Groundbreaking is planned for this fall."
