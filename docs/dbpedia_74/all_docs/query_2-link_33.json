        "text": "Original article: The Trump campaign has decided to move its rally previously scheduled for Friday in Rochester to the nearby town of Dodge Center, Rochester Mayor Kim Norton confirmed Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe mayor, who also sits on the city’s Airport Commission, said the Trump campaign notified the airport of its decision earlier in the morning.\n\nGlenn Sylvester, chief operating officer at McNeilus Steel, Inc, later confirmed his company plans to host the president on Friday. He made the announcement in an email to staff, adding that employees will be paid for the day and are encouraged to attend the rally.\n\n“Expectations are for 25,000 people to attend,” wrote Sylvester.\n\nThat estimate would be well above the state’s Covid guidelines, which call for events of no more than 250 people. The president’s campaign, however, has repeatedly shunned the restrictions by holding large rallies, including ones in other Minnesota cities that have been linked to outbreaks.\n\n(In an interview Thursday with MPR News, Sylvester stated the company “would enforce social distancing requirements as best they can,” but declined to say whether they would put a limit on crowd size.)\n\nMayor Kim Norton said the decision to move venues came as a surprise. City officials had been under the impression that an agreement had been reached with the campaign to stay within the state guidelines.\n\nAs part of a unique partnership, the airport is owned by the city and managed by a wholly owned subsidiary of Mayo Clinic.\n\n“I think it is safe to say that we were all on the same page in wanting to provide a place for the president — and any campaign — to be able to fly into our community,” Norton said.\n\nAsked whether she felt the Trump campaign decided to move locations to skirt having to reach an agreement with the city, Norton said: “I can’t say for certain, but we are making our decisions and we are asking them to abide by the state guidelines so we could protect people on city property.”\n\nTrump still plans to fly into Rochester International Airport before being escorted to Dodge Center, a small town about 20 minutes west of Rochester.\n\nThe rally is one of three scheduled the same day across the Upper Midwest, a region that — particularly in rural areas — is now experiencing a spike in Covid-19 cases.\n\n“I still have concerns, as I have from the beginning, about the spread of Covid,” said Norton. “Having it at another venue doesn’t change the fact that we are at an all-time high for Covid in the area and it could spread.”\n\nThe Friday rally will mark the president’s second visit to southern Minnesota since 2018, when he campaigned in Rochester on behalf of Republican congressional candidates."
