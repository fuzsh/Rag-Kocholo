        "text": "NEW REGULATIONS FOR 2024\n\nNew Statewide Regulations\n\nTurtle harvest regulations: Both a recreational turtle license and angling license are required to harvest turtles. Traps are no longer allowed to take turtles.\n\nKeep it Clean Law: Ice anglers should be aware of a new law to minimize littering â many items (including fish) may not be left directly on the ice while fishing.\n\nFishing with 2 lines is now allowed on portions of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers.\n\nNew and Modified Experimental Regulations\n\nGull Chain (Crow Wing and Cass Counties): A new slot limit for northern pike (all from 30-40\" must be immediately released, possession limit 2, only 1 over 40\") is in effect.\n\nPearl Lake (Stearns): The experimental regulation on northern pike has expired. The north-central zone regulations are now in effect.\n\nNew and Modified Special Regulations\n\nClearwater Lake (Wright County) and connected waters: A new special regulation has reduced daily limits for crappie (5 per day) and sunfish (10 per day).\n\nMaple Lake (Wright County): A new special regulation has reduced daily limits for crappie (5 per day) and sunfish (10 per day) (page 45).\n\n1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Crow Wing Lakes (Hubbard County): The connected lakes are now regulated as one water where a special regulation for sunfish restricts anglers to 5 fish per day.\n\nLake Winnibigoshish (Itasca): A new special regulation reduces the daily limit for sunfish to 5 (to be consistent with connected Cut Foot Sioux and Little Cut Foot Sioux Lakes).\n\nBalsam, Haskell, and Scrapper lakes (Itasca County): A special regulation for northern pike (fish from 24-36\" must be immediately released, only 1 over 36\") on Balsam Lake will be expanded to Haskell and Scrapper Lakes.\n\nBig Sand Lake (Hubbard): The special walleye regulation has been repealed. Statewide regulations are now in effect.\n\nAQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES\n\nAquatic invasive species (AIS) are nonnative animals and plants that do not naturally occur in our waters and may cause ecological or economic harm.See images below of some AIS that have been found in Minnesota.\n\nYou can help prevent the introduction and spread of AIS by following both the required and recommended actions listed on page 9 before moving your boat, bait or other equipment from one waterbody to another.\n\nReport new infestations: If you suspect a new infestation of an AIS, note the exact location, take a photo or keep the specimen, and call 888-MINNDNR.\n\nInvasive carp captures must be immediately reported to the DNR, call 651-587-2781 or email [email protected]. Please take a photo, keepcarcass cool but do not freeze, and make arrangements with the DNR to transport the carp to the nearest area fisheries office. You may keep invasivecarp for personal use with a special permit, which is available on the DNR website at mndnr.gov/invasive-carp.\n\nRed swamp crayfish\n\n2 to 5\" long. Raised bright red spots on claws.\n\nZebra and quagga mussel\n\nThe only freshwater mollusks that attach to objects with byssal threads (up to 1Â½\"); larvae float in water and are too small to see.\n\nBighead and silver carp\n\nEye located at lower part of head below the mouth; Silver can jump more than 10 feet high.\n\nStarry stonewort\n\nGrass-like algae with a small, star-shaped structure called a âbulbilâ less than Â¼-inch in diameter.\n\nFaucet snail\n\nUp to Â½\" long, light brown to black, 4-5 whorls.\n\nNew Zealand mudsnail\n\nUp to 1â5\" long, light to dark brown, cone-shaped shell, 5-6 whorls.\n\nRound goby\n\nSingle scallop-shaped pelvic fin, fish is usually 3-6\" long.\n\nSpiny waterflea\n\nLong tail, white with black spots, looks like gelatinous globs on fishing line, small (up to 3â8\").\n\nEurasian watermilfoil\n\n12 to 21 leaflet pairs per leaf.\n\nRuffe\n\nSpots between rays of dorsal fin, no gap between fins.\n\nRequired ActionsâItâs the Law!\n\nMost anglers and boaters follow Minnesotaâs Clean, Drain, Dispose laws to help prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species:\n\nClean all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers and other water-related equipment before leaving any water access or shoreland.\n\nIt is illegal to transport prohibited invasive speciesâincluding zebra musselsâwhether dead or alive.\n\nYou can find a complete list of prohibited invasive species by visiting dnr.state. mn.us/invasives/laws.html#prohibited\n\nDrain water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait container, motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving any water access or shoreland property.\n\nKeep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft.\n\nDispose of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches and worms, in the trash.\n\nIt is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another.\n\nIt is illegal to release worms in the state; worms are not native to Minnesota.\n\nIf you want to keep your live bait, on shore before leaving, you must always drain all water from your bait container and refill it with bottled or dechlorinated tap water.\n\nRecommended ActionsâProtect Your Waters\n\nTo further decontaminate your watercraft and equipment, itâs important to spray, rinse or dry everything before going to another waterbody, especially ifyour boat has been in the water or moored for more than 24 hoursâor if you have recently been in zebra mussel or spiny waterflea infested waters. Do1 or more of the following:\n\nDry for at least 5 days.\n\nSpray with high-pressure water.\n\nRinse with very hot water. To reduce the risk of spreading zebra mussels, use water that is 120 Â°F at the point of contact and spray each area for atleast 2 minutes, or use 140 Â°F water for at least 10 seconds on each area.\n\nLakes and Rivers Listed as âInfestedâ\n\nWhat do I need to do when I visit a lake or river on the infested waters list?\n\nYou should follow the same aquatic invasive species regulations: Clean, Drain, Disposeâ every time you visit any lake or river, infested or not.\n\nIf you are harvesting bait, commercial fishing, or diverting or taking water, you need to follow special regulations in infested waters.\n\nHow do I know which waters are listed as infested?\n\nFor the most complete and current infested waters list, visit mndnr.gov/AIS or request a copy from [email protected] or call 651-259-5100.\n\nYou can use LakeFinder to find out if a particular lake is listed as infested: mndnr.gov/lakefind.\n\nInfested waters are posted with orange Invasive Species Alert signs at the public access.\n\nWatercraft Inspections\n\nThe Minnesota DNR has had a watercraft inspection program since 1992 to help prevent the spread of AIS. With the help of our partners, today nearly1,000 authorized watercraft inspectors are working at lakes and rivers across Minnesota. The information below will help you prepare for a watercraft inspection. In 2021, 95 percent of boaters surveyed by inspectors arrived while following Minnesotaâs Clean, Drain, Dispose laws.\n\nWhat should I expect from an inspection?\n\nInspectors are trained to:\n\nIntroduce themselves as a watercraft inspector.\n\nProvide tips on how to inspect your own equipment.\n\nPhysically inspect your boat, trailer and any other water-related equipmentâ meaning they may touch your boat or trailer to feel for tiny attached zebra mussels or other invasive species.\n\nPhysically inspect compartments that may hold water, such as live wells or bilge areas.\n\nDeny launch if: 1) the inspector finds invasive species or any plants attached, and until the invasive species or plants are removed; or 2) you refuse an inspection.\n\nâº Although inspectors have the authority to deny launch, they will work with you to try to bring your watercraft into compliance.\n\nâº Inspectors will not deny launch based solely on where, or when, you last used your watercraft.\n\nAsk questions to help improve the DNRâs inspection program. You are not required to answer these questions.\n\nHow should I prepare for an inspection?\n\nWhen entering an access:\n\nAlways follow all state laws regarding AIS and arrive in compliance with Clean, Drain and Dispose laws.\n\nOpen the lids of closed compartments that could hold water, like live wells, so the inspector can see they are drained. Your drain plugs should all be open while you transport your boat.\n\nRemember to install the drain plug after the inspection and before launching.\n\nWhen exiting an access:\n\nRemove any plants, mud, and invasive animals.\n\nPull all drain plugs.\n\nOpen water-holding compartments to allow inspection.\n\nWhat about on-site watercraft decontamination?\n\nAn inspector may require your watercraft to be decontaminated prior to launching or before leaving an access, if a unit is on-site. Most decontaminations can be done quickly. Trained inspectors use hot water to target areas to kill AIS. An inspector may also use high-pressure water. The DNR performs watercraft decontaminations free of charge.\n\nHow do I find a decontamination station?\n\nThe DNR posts decontamination unit locations online at mndnr.gov/decon.\n\nAt these sites, inspectors will perform a courtesy inspection and determine if any decontamination is required.\n\nTell us how weâre doing at: [email protected]\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nCulling (sorting)\n\nThe act of replacing one fish with another fish. See border waters with North Dakota.\n\nDaily versus possession limits (collectively called bag limits)\n\nA possession limit is the number of a particular species allowed in an anglerâs possession, including any and all locations such as a livewell or freezer at home. A daily limit is the number of a particular species an angler is allowed to keep in a calendar day, including those that are gifted or consumed. Daily and possession limits are most often the same with the exception of statewide perch limits and special regulations for sunfish and crappie which reduce a daily limit but retain the statewide possession limit. While on or angling in a water with a daily limit that is lower than the possession limit, a person may not have more than the daily limit of that species in their immediate physical possession.\n\nDesignated stream trout lakes\n\nThese waters have been listed in Minnesota Rule and have been stocked with trout that are typically found in streams: rainbow, brown, or brook trout. Some also have splake,\n\na cross between a lake trout and a brook trout.\n\nGame fish\n\nIncludes the following and their hybrids: American eel, bass (includes rock, white, and yellow), burbot, catfish, cisco (tullibee), crappie, muskellunge, northern pike, paddlefish, salmon, sauger, sturgeon, sunfish, trout, walleye, whitefish, and yellow perch.\n\nImmediately released or returned to the water\n\nImmediately released fish are only retained long enough to unhook, measure and photograph. Fish not immediately released are counted as part of an angler's daily and possession limit.\n\nInland waters\n\nLakes and rivers within Minnesota not bordering Canada or another state.\n\nMinimum size limit\n\nProhibits harvest of fish less than a specified length.\n\nMinnows\n\nAll sizes of true minnows (excluding carp and goldfish), leeches, mudminnows, tadpole madtoms, stonecats; the following if 12\" or less: suckers, redhorses, buffalo, carpsuckers; the following if 7\" or less: bullhead, cisco (tullibee), lake whitefish, goldeye, and mooneye. Border water regulations may vary.\n\nOne-over the size limit\n\nAllows the harvest of one fish over a set size limit as part of the daily or possession limit.\n\nProtected slot limit\n\nProhibits harvest of fish from a designated size range. Fish within this size range must be immediately released.\n\nRough fish\n\nCarp, buffalo, sucker (including redhorse and carpsuckers), freshwater drum (sheepshead), bowfin (dogfish), gar, goldeye and bullhead. Border waters regulations may vary.\n\nGENERAL REGULATIONS\n\nTACKLE AND LINES\n\nHow many lines can I fish with?\n\nYou may use only one line during the open water season.\n\nYou may use two lines through the ice except on designated trout lakes and streams.\n\nOn designated trout lakes and streams, only one line is allowed at any time.\n\nMore than one line may be allowed on border waters and Lake Superior.\n\nHow many hooks can I use on the end of my line?\n\nOnly one artificial bait/lure or one single tackle configuration can be used at the end of your line for it to be considered a single line.\n\nUp to three single- or multiple-pronged hooks may be used as a single tackle configuration but the total distance between hooks cannot exceed 9\"(see below).\n\nâUmbrellaâ style rigs may be used provided only one wire contains hooks. The other wires may include lures/baits but cannot contain hooks.\n\nYou may use up to three artificial flies on one fishing line when you are fishing for bass, crappie, rock bass, sunfish, or trout. There are no restrictions on distance between the flies.\n\nUnless fishing on a designated trout stream or lake, you may add one additional âstingerâ hook on a line as part of a single artificial lure or bait. Theâstingerâ hook must be within 3\" of the artificial lure/bait.\n\nSingle Tackle Configuration Example\n\nArtificial Lure/Baits Examples\n\nBAIT\n\nCan I use bait in Minnesota waters?\n\nYou can fish with a variety of live or dead bait including worms, night crawlers, insects and larvae. If you are fishing with minnows or leeches, a number of restrictions apply.\n\nIf you choose to keep your bait when done fishing, you must exchange water in bait buckets with tap or bottled water prior to leaving any water body, except when you are fishing through the ice. The exception for ice fishing does not apply when fishing on Lake Superior.\n\nDispose of unwanted bait in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into Minnesota lakes and rivers. All earthworms are non-native and can damage forests if released.\n\nYou canât use whole or parts of game fish, goldfish, carp, or salamanders (including mudpuppies) for bait.\n\nWhat are the rules for taking and transporting live minnows and leeches?\n\nYou can't import live minnows or leeches into Minnesota.\n\nDead bait may only be imported if it comes from a waterbody tested negative for Viral Hemmorhagic Septicemia (VHS) with a negative fish health certification or has been preserved under a DNR bait preservation permit issued to a commercial license. All imported dead bait must be labeled and the labeling kept on your person while angling (see website for examples).\n\nYou can take an unlimited number of minnows and leeches with an angling license for personal use; however you may not transport more than 12 dozen at one time without a commercial minnow license. All minnows and leeches must be transported in tap/well or bottled water.\n\nWhere can I harvest minnows and leeches?\n\nYou can take them from all waters of the state where you can legally access the water except:\n\nWithin the boundaries of state parks.\n\nWithin designated trout waters, except under permit.\n\nMost aquatic invasive species infested waters. See mndnr.gov/AIS for a current list.\n\nAll streams and connected waters in Lincoln, Pipestone, Murray, Rock and Nobles counties south of U.S. Highway 14 and west of U.S. Highway 59 to the South Dakota border.\n\nA harvest permit is required to take madtoms and stonecats in Dodge, Freeborn and Mower counties.\n\nCan I harvest bait from infested waters?\n\nMinnows and leeches may be taken for personal use from waters infested solely with Eurasian watermilfoil using a cylindrical trap not exceeding 16\" in diameter and 32\" long. At these waters, harvested bait may only be used on the water where taken. The harvest and use of bait from other infested waters is prohibited.\n\nWithin infested streams and rivers (except for the St. Louis River Estuary), bullhead, sucker, mooneye, goldeye, and freshwater drum may be taken by hook and line for personal use as bait on the same water. Harvested bait may not be transported live from the river or stream. Where a river or stream is divided by barriers such as dams, fish for bait must be caught and used on the same section.\n\nYou can obtain a DNR permit at mndnr.gov/fishing to take gizzard shad by cast net for personal use as bait for fishing from Minnesota portions of theMississippi River downstream of St. Anthony Falls, the Minnesota River downstream of Granite Falls, and the St. Croix River downstream of the dam at Taylors Falls.\n\nHow can I take minnows and leeches?\n\nYou can use dip nets, seines and traps. See restrictions below:\n\nSeines may not be longer than 25 feet nor have bar mesh greater than 1â4\". If the bar mesh is between 3â16\" and 1â4\", the seine may not be taller than 37\",otherwise the seine may not be taller than 48\".\n\nTraps dimensions may not exceed 30\" in length, 30\" in width, nor 15\" in height. The diameter of the opening may not exceed 11â2\", and the mesh size may not exceed 1â2\" bar measure. Traps must have a waterfproof tag bearing the name and address of the owner.\n\nYou cannot use throw nets (cast nets) without a DNR permit.\n\nWhen do I need to get a commercial license to take and sell minnows and leeches?\n\nIf you want to transport more than 12 dozen.\n\nIf you want to sell minnows or leeches at retail or wholesale.\n\nWhat are the rules for live suckers?\n\nSuckers 12\" and shorter are considered minnows and regular bait rules for minnows apply. However, suckers longer than 12\" may only be transported alive if they are in containers that are not livewells or other parts of a boat and only if bought from a licensed commercial vendor. You must have a valid sales receipt from the vendor on your person.\n\nWhat are the rules for live bullheads?\n\nLive bullheads may not be transported north of Minnesota Highway 210.\n\nBullheads less than 7\" in length are considered minnows and may be possessed in any quantity south of Minnesota Highway 210. Bullheads must be transported in a container with a locking lid.\n\nYou may take and possess bullheads, 7-10\" in length, for use as live bait. They are counted as part of your daily and possession limit of 100.\n\nLegal methods of taking bullheads are dip net, angling or minnow seines.\n\nWhat is restricted bait and can I harvest and use it?\n\nRestricted bait includes cisco (tullibee) less than 7\", smelt, and VHS-susceptible species (such as fathead minnows, bluntnose minnows, spottail shiners, and emerald shiners).\n\nFor restricted bait rules on Lake Superior and tributaries se below.\n\nLive restricted bait must have been purchased from a licensed retailer (retain proof of purchase) or come from a VHS-free source.\n\nDead restricted bait can only be used if it was harvested from a waterbody tested for VHS with a negative fish health certification, a VHS free zone (see mndnr.gov/bait/dead), or has been preserved and labeled under a bait preservation permit issued to a commercial license.\n\nAll restricted dead bait must be labeled and the labeling kept on your person while angling (see www.dnr.state.mn.us/bait/dead.html for examples).\n\nFreezing is not a bait preservation method because freezing doesnât kill VHS.\n\nWhere can I get more information about bait?\n\nCheck the Other Species section of the online regulations or contact the Minnesota DNR Information Center at 888-MINNDNR, or go to mndnr.gov/bait\n\nMETHODS\n\nWhat if people are fishing together from a boat or on shore?\n\nA party is two or more people fishing together from a single watercraft or on shore while maintaining unaided visual and vocal contact.\n\nThe number of fish your party possesses canât be more than the combined limits of all party members. You may not transport more than your individual daily or possession limit.\n\nWhat fishing methods are illegal?\n\nIntentionally fishing for a species during its closed season.\n\nUsing an artificial light to lure, attract or spot fish. However, you may use a lighted artificial lure. Batteries used in lighted fishing lures must not contain mercury.\n\nLeaving your fishing line with hooks attached in the water unattended. Receiving electronic notifications is not considered attending your fishing line.\n\nUsing explosives, firearms, chemicals (not including a scented bait), spring (or automatic hook setting) devices that impale or hook fish, or electricity to take fish.\n\nTaking fish by hand (noodling) or by snagging.\n\nPOSSESSION\n\nHow many fish can I keep?\n\nYour daily and possession limits are the same unless otherwise noted. Some lakes have reduced daily limits but statewide possession limits which means an angler can keep one limit per day from that lake but can't exceed the statewide possession limit at any time.\n\nA fish is in your possession once you have caught and kept it. Your possession limit includes any fish you have kept that day plus any fish in storage from a previous day.\n\nProcessed fish (e.g. pickled, smoked) still count towards your limit.\n\nCulling is allowed in most waters except North Dakota border waters and Mille Lacs (except bass may be culled), until you reach your daily or possession limit.\n\nOnce you reach your daily or possession limit for a species, you may keep fishing but all fish of that species must be immediately released and no culling is allowed. If fishing is good you may want to stay below your limit to accommodate keeping a deeply hooked, legal sized fish.\n\nWhat are length limits?\n\nSome waters have fish length restrictions, such as slot limits, minimum size limits, or one-over the size limit.\n\nYou canât possess any fish outside the legal length limits of the waters on which you are traveling or fishing, unless all of the following conditions are true: 1) The fish was legally taken from a connected water body or packaged by a licensed fish packer; 2) You are traveling back to your lodging or docking and taking the most direct route; and 3) You are not fishing while you are in transit.\n\nWhat if Iâve caught fish on waters with size restrictions different from statewide regulations?\n\nUnless you are in the act of preparing the fish for a meal, any kept fish with size restrictions different than statewide regulations may not be filleted. Kept fish must still have their heads, tails, fins, and skin intact so they can be measured and counted. Carcasses count toward your possession limit until you dispose of them.\n\nYou may eat legal sized fish while on the ice, docked, or moored to shore but you must retain the carcass including the head, dorsal fin, and tail. Any fish caught and eaten on the same day count toward your daily limit.\n\nCan I give away fish that Iâve kept?\n\nIf you have kept a fish and want to transfer it as a gift, it must be accompanied by a receipt that must remain with the gift. The person receiving the gift canât possess more than the statewide limit including your gift.

Unless otherwise stated, all general regulations, seasons, limits, border water regulations, possession, and transportation regulations apply to these waters. If you want to keep fish with special or experimental size restrictions, the fish must remain intact to verify it is of legal size until you are preparing to eat the fish. Regulations are posted at access sites but be sure to also check other sections of this booklet and other statesâ regulations when on border waters. Note: some regulations specify a daily limit for the lake and others specify a possession limit.\n\nThese regulations are intended to improve fishing quality or provide unique opportunities.
