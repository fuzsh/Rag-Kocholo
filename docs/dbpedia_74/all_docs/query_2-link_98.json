        "text": "What's the capacity of a 20 yard roll-off bin?\n\n20 yard boxes are a common choice due to their versatility.\n\nThey suit most types of cleanups, including renovations, home cleanouts, roofing repairs, demolition projects and and deck removal.\n\nA 20 yard container can typically hold about 3 tons of debris, although some rental companies may allow more weight than that.\n\nThe dimensions of these containers may vary but is generally about 22 ft x 8 ft x 4.5 ft (LxWxH).\n\nSince a standard refrigerator measures about two cubic yards, a 20 yard container can hold the equivalent of 10 refrigerators.\n\nBecause densities of debris varies, the volume of waste you can fit in a 20 yard can will also vary.\n\nFor example, concrete weighs at least three times more than general household junk, so you can place far less concrete in the dumpster compared to household junk.\n\nDiscuss your project with your rental provider to make sure a 20 yard is the right size dumpster for your project.\n\nThis is important to avoid incurring overage fees or having to rent a second container in cases where a 20 yard bin wasnât big enough.\n\nRead more:"
