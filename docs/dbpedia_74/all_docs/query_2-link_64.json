We service the Twin Cities Metro Area and Pine County with our CSA/subscription service. Our CSA is fully customizable each week, runs for 20 weeks and has multiple add-on options for eggs, chicken, and beef. We have drop sites in Pine City, Anoka, Crystal, Edina, Falcon Heights, and South Minneapolis. Shares are generous and geared towards people who are serious about cooking at home. We value relationships and run our farm in a way that builds, strengthens, and protects bodies, families, communities and the Earth.\n\nOur farm is a small family farm. We farm with a team of four, who are all paid livable wages. We are dedicated to soil health as a foundation for nutritious food that can build and sustain healthy human bodies. We choose to sell through a small and committed CSA program because we value the long-term relationships and community that it nurtures and we believe that meals cooked and shared in homes are sacred. Because those relationships are so vital to the ongoing success of our farm, care of the Earth, and health of our bodies, we seek to nurture our member relationships through personal interactions, consistent media content to update our members, and regular opportunities for our community to visit and get involved on the farm.\n\nOur farm is for people who are serious about nutrition, want to personally know their farm and farmer, and who cook and eat at home regularly.\n\nAmador Hill Farm & Orchard\n\nDelivery area: Twin Cities Metro Area\n\nContact:\n\nJerry Krier\n\nNorth Branch, MN\n\n651-583-0705 • e-mail\n\nWebsite:\n\namadorhillfarm.org\n\nThe Women’s Environmental Institute runs an organically certified demonstration and education farm which supports a CSA, cultural heritage projects, an active internship program, community visitors, and volunteers.

Our stewardship practices include growing vegetables free of chemicals using crop rotations, limited tillage, green manures, animal manure, and mulching.\n\nIn 2017, Julie’s mother, who started the CSA 14 years ago, passed the farm down to Julie. As the owner and operator, this is Julie’s seventh season growing food on the land she grew up on. Main season shares run for 17-18 weeks, June through October. A full-share is a bushel each week and feeds a family of four. Half-shares are a half-bushel every week — great for a family of two. There are options for additional shares as well — fall shares in November and December, spring shares in April and May, and add-on boxes for processing vegetables throughout the main season. We offer a sliding scale fee to make fresh produce available to everyone.\n\nPick-up is on Thursdays. You can come to the farm to pick up your share or pick up in the Midtown Phillips neighborhood in Minneapolis. We grow a large variety of produce with 8 to 16 different vegetables, herbs, and occasional berries available each week.\n\nWe have a work requirement so our members can become more familiar with the farm.

We offer both small and large produce shares; our small shares contain 6-8 veggies per week and our large shares contain 8-10 veggies per week.\n\nOur farm is rooted in the idea of reciprocity. We base many of our farming practices on the give-and-take relationships we have with our food, our soils, and our community. This mission grounds us and has allowed us to implement many regenerative practices on our farm. We support our vegetable crops and the soil microbiota with compost and compost teas, and we plant a diverse array of crops to maintain a healthy ecological system. We also use an intensive cover cropping system to return organic matter back to the soil. All of these practices allow us to raise the most nutrient-dense produce possible so we can nourish our community to the fullest.\n\nTC Farm\n\nDelivery area: Twin Cities Metro Area\n\nContact:\n\nJack McCann\n\nMontrose, MN\n\n612-217-1770 • e-mail\n\nWebsite:\n\ntc.farm\n\nTC Farm is the most customizable pasture-raised meat and organic produce CSA in Minnesota.
