        "text": "County in Minnesota, United States\n\nThis article is about the county in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. For the community in southeast Minnesota named Dakota, see Dakota, Minnesota.\n\nCounty in Minnesota\n\nDakota County is the third-most populous county in the U.S. state of Minnesota, located in the east central portion of the state. As of the 2020 census, the population was 439,882. The population of Dakota County was estimated to be 447,440 in 2023.[2] The county seat is Hastings.[3] Dakota County is named for the Dakota Sioux tribal bands who inhabited the area.[4]\n\nThe name is recorded as \"Dahkotah\" in the United States Census records until 1851.[5] Dakota County is included in the Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington, MN–WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, the sixteenth largest metropolitan area in the United States with about 3.71 million residents. The largest city in Dakota County is the city of Lakeville, the ninth-largest city in Minnesota and fifth-largest Twin Cities suburb. The county is bordered by the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers on the north, and the state of Wisconsin on the east.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county was the site of historical events at Mendota that defined the state's future, including providing materials for the construction of Fort Snelling across the river and the signing of the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux which ceded land from the native Dakota nation for the Minnesota Territory. The county's history was initially tied to the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, both strategically important for United States expansion and as the convergence of the Dakota and Ojibwe nations who regarded the site as sacred. Influence shifted westward during the post-World War II settlement boom when Interstate 35 connected the western half of the county to Minneapolis and Saint Paul and bedroom communities grew. Most work outside the county but like many metro counties, Dakota continues to absorb industry and jobs from the core cities.[4][7]\n\nIn the 1600s, Mdewakanton Dakota fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in northern Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation.[12] According to Dakota tradition, their ancestors pushed out the Iowa who were found settled at the mouth of the Minnesota River.[13] In 1680, the Mdewakanton Dakota were contacted by French explorer Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, and the Mendota (mdo-TE) band of the Mdewakanton south of the Minnesota River were contacted by Joseph Nicollet in the 18th century.[14] While Taoyateduta (a.k.a. Little Crow) led the Mendota in northern Dakota County, upstream to the southwest, Chief Black Dog established his village of 600 people around 1750 at the isthmus between Black Dog Lake (which is named after him) and the Minnesota River, near the present site of the Black Dog Power Plant.[12][15]\n\nFollowing the published expeditions of explorers, in 1805, Zebulon Pike negotiated for military territory with the Mendota band which included land in Dakota County at the Mississippi River confluences with the Minnesota and St. Croix Rivers.[16] In 1819, on what is now Picnic Island on the south bank of the Minnesota River, Colonel Henry Leavenworth built a stockade fort called \"St. Peter's Cantonment\" or \"New Hope,\" where materials were assembled for the construction of Fort Snelling to be built on the bluff on the north bank.[17] Permanent settlement on the island was impossible due to annual flooding. Alexis Bailey built some log buildings nearby to trade in furs in 1826. Henry Hastings Sibley later built the first stone house in Minnesota in 1836, overlooking Fort Snelling. Sibley was a partner in the American Fur Company, and considerable fur trade occurred at Mendota due to the accessibility of the confluence.\n\nOngoing United States expansion into the then \"Northwest Territory\" led to government purchase of land from the Dakota people (the Mdewakanton, Wahpekute, Wahpeton, and Sisseton bands) via the Treaty of St. Peters, the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux,[18][19] and the Treaty of Mendota in 1851.[20] After the Minnesota Territory was established in 1849, Dakotah County (later Dakota County) spanned from the Mississippi River to the Missouri River.[21] By the time Minnesota achieved statehood in 1858, power and influence had shifted from Mendota, across the rivers to Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nHastings and South St. Paul\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1900, the hub of activity in the county was in Hastings, the county seat, and a focal point of transportation, communication, and commerce. St. Peter's, now Mendota, had lost out to Fort Snelling. Hastings is located on the Mississippi River at the confluence of the St. Croix River and on the Vermillion River, which provided ample water power. Lumber, milling, and railroads provided good incomes. During this time, the stockyards and meat-packing plants in South St. Paul, Minnesota became the world's largest stockyards.[22] Ranchers in the west shipped their livestock to St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans.[23] These plants were worked by immigrants from Romania, Serbia, and other Eastern European countries.[24] The rest of the county remained agricultural during the boom of milling activity north of the Minnesota River due to lack of bridge connections. Rail access came in 1866 via the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Omaha Railroad which shipped grain to millers.[25] The Minneapolis St. Paul Rochester and Dubuque Electric Traction Company line in 1905 (now the Dan Patch Corridor), was primary for passengers going to resorts in Burnsville and Lakeville.[26]\n\nSuburban growth\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the 1950s, population growth shifted to western Dakota county, which had been predominantly Irish and Scottish extending southward toward the Scandinavians of Southern Minnesota.[27][28] As population pressures expanded south from Minneapolis and Bloomington, the completion of Interstate 35W and 35E brought about major construction in the post-World War II period, turning villages into cities within 20 years. Burnsville, Apple Valley, Eagan, and Lakeville brought over 200,000 people into the county by the end of the century. The Western and Northern Service Centers were constructed in the early 1990s each with an additional courthouse location. License centers were subsequently set up in Burnsville and Lakeville. Though pressure remained since the postwar boom to move the county seat to a larger community, the Dakota County Board maintained the seat in Hastings, while providing government services across the county.[29]\n\nHistoric sites\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Registered Historic Places in the county include the settlement at Mendota, the homes of well-heeled residents of Hastings, the ethnic gathering places in South Saint Paul, and other sites related to life on the prairie.\n\nPolitics and government\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government\n\n[edit]\n\nDakota County is governed by the Board of Commissioners. The members of the Board as of May 7, 2023, are:\n\nMike Slavik, District 1\n\nJoe Atkins, District 2\n\nLaurie Halverson, District 3\n\nWilliam Droste, District 4\n\nLiz Workman, District 5\n\nMary Liz Holberg, District 6\n\nMary Hamann-Roland, District 7\n\nDakota County has an elected Sheriff (Joe Leko) and an elected County Attorney (Kathryn M. Keena). There are appointed boards for the library system, community development agency, and several advisory boards. Dakota County is served by an elected board of the Soil and Water Conservation District.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nDakota County voters tend to vote Democratic. Since 1960, the county has selected the Democratic Party candidate in 71% of national elections (as of 2020).\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Dakota County, Minnesota[30] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 109,638 41.81% 146,155 55.73% 6,466 2.47% 2016 99,864 43.07% 110,592 47.70% 21,404 9.23% 2012 109,516 47.45% 116,255 50.37% 5,050 2.19% 2008 104,364 46.29% 116,778 51.79% 4,330 1.92% 2004 108,959 50.48% 104,635 48.48% 2,252 1.04% 2000 87,250 47.87% 85,446 46.88% 9,553 5.24% 1996 57,244 37.11% 77,297 50.11% 19,725 12.79% 1992 52,312 33.30% 63,660 40.53% 41,108 26.17% 1988 61,606 49.45% 61,942 49.72% 1,032 0.83% 1984 55,119 52.54% 49,125 46.83% 667 0.64% 1980 40,708 42.96% 43,433 45.84% 10,614 11.20% 1976 37,542 44.65% 44,253 52.63% 2,285 2.72% 1972 34,967 53.96% 28,479 43.95% 1,350 2.08% 1968 19,290 38.65% 28,416 56.94% 2,202 4.41% 1964 13,856 32.73% 28,391 67.07% 81 0.19% 1960 15,032 42.62% 20,150 57.13% 91 0.26% 1956 13,112 50.74% 12,672 49.04% 55 0.21% 1952 11,871 49.71% 11,890 49.79% 118 0.49% 1948 6,819 34.75% 12,487 63.63% 317 1.62% 1944 7,731 47.13% 8,562 52.20% 110 0.67% 1940 8,339 47.00% 9,327 52.57% 77 0.43% 1936 4,043 26.26% 8,890 57.73% 2,465 16.01% 1932 4,439 32.56% 8,958 65.70% 238 1.75% 1928 6,019 45.18% 7,215 54.15% 89 0.67% 1924 3,931 42.34% 929 10.01% 4,424 47.65% 1920 5,373 66.45% 2,190 27.08% 523 6.47% 1916 1,881 41.73% 2,373 52.64% 254 5.63% 1912 609 14.20% 1,777 41.42% 1,904 44.38% 1908 2,481 55.07% 1,778 39.47% 246 5.46% 1904 2,685 68.69% 1,078 27.58% 146 3.73% 1900 1,904 47.64% 1,878 46.99% 215 5.38% 1896 2,147 46.41% 2,310 49.94% 169 3.65% 1892 1,481 37.95% 1,989 50.97% 432 11.07%\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county terrain consists of low rolling hills, sloping to the river valleys. Its highest point is at Buck Hill in Burnsville, at 1,168 feet. ASL.[31][32] The county has a total area of 587 square miles (1,520 km2), of which 562 square miles (1,460 km2) is land and 25 square miles (65 km2) (4.2%) is water.[33]\n\nRivers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe northern and eastern boundaries of Dakota County are marked by the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. Management and jurisdiction of the rivers falls into multiple local, State and Federal agencies. Most of the Minnesota River bank is under the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge with fish, wildlife, and parkland managed collectively by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

At Mendota, the Treaty of Mendota was signed, opening Southern Minnesota to settlement, and prominent Saint Paul businessmen built their mansions there. Though linked with the state's capital for much of history via rail, Dakota County owes much of its current growth to the expansion of Minneapolis' population which accelerated during the post-World War II boom era of the 1960s. This demand for housing along with two major interstate highways linking Minneapolis (I-35W) and St. Paul (I-35E) to the county, concentrated major growth and demand along the northern end. Today, the cities of Burnsville, Eagan, Apple Valley, Lakeville, Rosemount, Hastings, Inver Grove Heights, Mendota Heights, West St. Paul, and South St. Paul are synonymous with the Twin Cities, as being part of \"the Cities.\" Both Burnsville and Eagan are nearly developed and have become more like independent cities attracting major development than mere residential bedroom suburbs.[47][48]\n\nIn contrast, the southern part of Dakota County reflects the rural past with small towns such as Farmington, Coates, Vermillion, Hampton, Randolph, and Miesville where street grids and housing dating from the early 20th century can be found. Much of the county is self-contained except for two examples. The City of Hastings, the county seat, lies on both banks of the Mississippi River and was linked historically and physically by rail to the growing influence of the state's capital, Saint Paul. On the south border, the City of Northfield, technically in Rice County, has expanded north into Dakota however the city itself is allowed into the municipal sewer boundary.[clarification needed]\n\nThough all of Dakota County is considered part of the metropolitan area and open to major development, the county government has steadily preserved farmland and continues to acquire new permanent natural lands in the southern townships.[49] This has further defined the boundaries between urbanized and rural which is starkly visible in the outskirts of the developed cities. While the center of population still lies north with more cosmopolitan residents, culturally Dakota County is a rural community and the Dakota County Fair is still a largely agricultural event, held annually in Farmington.\n\nMost of northern Dakota County is referred to as \"South of the River\" for its location being south of the Minnesota River.[50][51][52][53]\n\nCities (2021 population estimate)\n\n[edit]\n\nApple Valley 55,638\n\nBurnsville 63,943\n\nCoates 142\n\nEagan 68,642\n\nEmpire 2,444\n\nFarmington 23,534\n\nHampton 736\n\nHastings (partly in Washington County) 21,925\n\nInver Grove Heights 35,541\n\nLakeville 72,812\n\nLilydale 800\n\nMendota 183\n\nMendota Heights 11,665\n\nMiesville 134\n\nNew Trier 83\n\nNorthfield (mostly in Rice County) 20,709\n\nRandolph 464\n\nRosemount 26,642\n\nSouth St. Paul 20,536\n\nSunfish Lake 523\n\nVermillion 439\n\nWest St. Paul 20,822\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nGhost towns\n\n[edit]\n\nLewiston\n\nNininger\n\nTownships\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nPierce Butler, United States Supreme Court justice\n\nIgnatius Donnelly, politician\n\nSteven Engler, politician\n\nDavid Knutson, Minnesota State Senator of District 37, 2003-2004[54]\n\nWilliam Gates LeDuc, pioneer, politician, brevet brigadier general\n\nHenry Hastings Sibley, first Governor of Minnesota\n\nHarold Stassen (R), Former Governor of Minnesota, Aide to Adm.
