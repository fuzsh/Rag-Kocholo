The Division is staffed by senior deputies that are very familiar with our local criminal offenders thereby improving the security of the building by their experience and expertise which helps to minimize issues that may arise. The deputies of the GCS Division screen hundreds of people and thousands of bags each year. The amount of prohibited items located by the deputies is staggering in number and uniqueness.\n\nThe Transport Division does exactly what their name says, they move people every day and log thousands of miles per year doing so.

The benefit of a multi-jurisdictional task force is that it allows law enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions to work together as a single enforcement entity with the ability to share intelligence and coordinate enforcement activities. The formation of the SEMVCET has allowed more efficient use of resources and targeting of offenders whose activities cross jurisdictional boundaries.\n\nTelephone - 507-328-6762\n\nFax - 507-328-6781\n\nDrug Tip Line: 888-345-0131\n\nDrug Tip E-mail: drugs@co.olmsted.mn.us\n\nSEMVCET Agencies"
