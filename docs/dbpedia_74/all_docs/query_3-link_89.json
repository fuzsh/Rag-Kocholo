        "text": "(WTAQ-WLUK) — Authorities have opened an investigation into what they’re calling a “large-scale deer poaching scheme” spanning three counties over the last 12 months.\n\nAccording to a news release, the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Office received a tip earlier this month, which led a deputy to “uncover what is believed to be a large scale deer poaching scheme.”\n\nDue to the alleged offenses, the deputy contacted a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources conservation warden and the agencies initiated a joint investigation.\n\nOfficials believe the scheme covered a range of approximately 200 square miles in Fond du Lac, Dodge and Washington counties throughout the past year. General boundaries targeted by the suspects fall within a perimeter outlined between Campbellsport, Waucousta, Lomira, Theresa, West Bend and Kewaskum.\n\nAnyone with information that may be related to this investigation is asked to contact law enforcement. Relevant information may include:\n\nHearing gunshots during overnight hours.\n\nObserving a suspicious vehicle shining deer, stopping in the roadway, and/or shooting from a vehicle.\n\nLocating dead deer carcasses, on public or private land, with bullet wounds. Bucks would have the full head removed and does would be fully intact.\n\nObserving deer, alive or deceased, with what appear to be gunshot wounds, especially outside of deer hunting season.\n\nInformation can be provided to Conservation Warden Zachery Feest (Washington County) at 262-237-0904 or Conservation Warden William Hankee (Fond du Lac County) at 920-904-2653.\n\nYou can also leave an anonymous tip on the Fond du Lac County Law Enforcement Tip Line by calling 920-906-4777."
