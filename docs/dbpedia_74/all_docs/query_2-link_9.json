This has attracted a wide range of related businesses and services, making healthcare a significant part of the local economy. Besides healthcare, the city also benefits from industries like technology, manufacturing, and education, contributing to a stable job market and making Rochester an attractive place for professionals.\n\nWhen it comes to voting patterns, Rochester exhibits a mix of conservative and liberal ideologies.
