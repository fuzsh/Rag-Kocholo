        "text": "FOND DU LAC COUNTY, Wis. (CBS 58) -- According to the Fond du Lac Sheriff's Office, in mid-July, a tip led to them to uncover what is believed to be a large-scale deer poaching scheme. A joint investigation with the Wisconsin DNR was initiated.\n\nThe range covers around 200 square miles over Fond du Lac, Dodge, and Washington counties. Authorities say they have information to believe that it has been happening in the area for the last 12 months.\n\nThe Fond du Lac Sheriff's Office asks anyone with any information to contact law enforcement. The information may include:\n\nHearing gunshots during overnight hours.\n\nObserving a suspicious vehicle shining deer, stopping in the roadway, and/or shooting from a vehicle.\n\nLocating dead deer carcasses, on public or private land, with bullet wounds. Bucks would have the full head removed and does would be fully intact.\n\nObserving deer, alive or deceased, with what appear to be gunshot wounds, especially outside of deer hunting season.\n\nAny other information that may be relevant to an investigation of this nature.\n\nAnyone with any information is asked to contact conservation Warden Zachery Feest (Washington County) at 262-237-0904 or Conservation Warden William Hankee (Fond du Lac County) at 920-904-2653. You can also leave an anonymous tip on the Fond du Lac County Law Enforcement Tip Line by calling 920-906-4777."
