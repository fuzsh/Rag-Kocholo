        "text": "This resource is also available in Spanish.\n\nTheÂ Great Pacific Garbage PatchÂ is a collection ofÂ marine debrisÂ in the North Pacific Ocean. Marine debris isÂ litterÂ that ends up inÂ oceans,Â seas, and other large bodies of water.\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also known as the Pacific trashÂ vortex, spans waters from theÂ West CoastÂ of North America to Japan. The patch is actuallyÂ comprised of the Western Garbage Patch, located near Japan, and the Eastern Garbage Patch, located between the U.S. states of Hawai'i and California.\n\nThese areas of spinning debris are linked together by the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone, located a few hundred kilometers north of Hawai'i. ThisÂ convergence zoneÂ is where warm water from the South Pacific meets up with cooler water from theÂ Arctic. The zone acts like aÂ highwayÂ that moves debris from one patch to another.\n\nThe entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch isÂ bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a gyre as a large system of swirling ocean currents. Increasingly, however, it also refers to the garbage patch as a vortex of plastic waste and debris broken down into small particles in the ocean . The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is formed by four currents rotating clockwise around an area of 20 million square kilometers (7.7 million square miles): the California current , the North Equatorial current , the Kuroshio current , and the North Pacific current .\n\nThe area in the center of a gyre tends to be very calm andÂ stable. The circular motion of the gyre draws debris into this stable center, where it becomes trapped. A plastic water bottleÂ discarded off the coast of California, for instance, takes the California Current south toward Mexico. There, it may catch the North Equatorial Current , which crosses the vast Pacific. Near theÂ coast Â of Japan, the bottle may travel north on the powerful Kuroshiro Current . Finally, the bottle travels eastward on the North Pacific Current . The gently rolling vortexes of the Eastern and Western Garbage Patches gradually draw in the bottle.\n\nThe amount of debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch Â accumulates because much of it is notÂ biodegradable. ManyÂ plastics , for instance, do not wear down; they simply break into tinier and tinier pieces.\n\nFor many people, the idea of a âgarbage patchâÂ conjures up images of anÂ islandÂ of trash floating on the ocean . In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic , calledÂ microplastics. Micro plastics canât always be seen by the naked eye. EvenÂ satellite imageryÂ doesnât show a giant patch of garbage. The micro plastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes.\n\nThe seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap.Â Oceanographers andÂ ecologists recentlyÂ discovered that about 70 percent of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nWhile oceanographers andÂ climatologistsÂ predicted the existence of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it was a racing boat captain by the name of Charles Moore who actually discovered the trash vortex. Moore was sailing from Hawai'i to California after competing in aÂ yachtingÂ race. Crossing the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Moore and his crew noticed millions of pieces of plastic surrounding his ship.\n\nMarine Debris\n\nNo one knows how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists toÂ trawl. In addition, not all of the trash floats on the surface.Â Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortex âs area nearly impossible toÂ measure.\n\n80 percent of plastic in the ocean is estimated to come from land-based sources, with the remaining 20 percent coming from boats and other marine sources. These percentages vary by region, however. A 2018 study found that synthetic fishing nets made up nearly half the mass of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , due largely to ocean current dynamics and increased fishing activity in the Pacific Ocean .\n\nWhile many different types of trash enter the ocean , plastics make up the majority of marine debris for two reasons. First, plastic âsÂ durability, low cost, andÂ malleabilityÂ mean that itâs being used in more and moreÂ consumerÂ andÂ industrialÂ products. Second, plastic goods do not biodegrade but instead, break down into smaller pieces.\n\nIn the ocean , the sun breaks down these plastics into tinier and tinier pieces, a process known asÂ photodegradation. Most of this debris comes from plastic bags, bottle caps, plastic water bottles, and Styrofoam cups.\n\nMarine debris can be very harmful toÂ marine Â life in the gyre. For instance, loggerhead sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellies, their favorite food. Albatrosses mistake plastic Â resinÂ pellets for fish eggs and feed them to chicks, which die ofÂ starvationÂ orÂ rupturedÂ organs.\n\nSeals and otherÂ marine mammals are especially at risk. They can getÂ entangled inÂ abandoned plastic fishing nets, which are being discarded largely due to inclement weather and illegal fishing. Seals and other mammals often drown in these forgotten netsâa phenomenon known as âghost fishing.â\n\nMarine debris can also disturb marine Â food webs in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. As micro plastics and other trash collect on or near the surface of the ocean , they block sunlight from reachingÂ planktonÂ andÂ algae below. Algae and plankton are the most commonÂ autotrophs, orÂ producers, in the marine food web . Autotrophs areÂ organisms that can produce their ownÂ nutrients from carbon and sunlight.\n\nIf algae and plankton communities areÂ threatened, the entire food web may change. Animals that feed on algae and plankton , such as fish and turtles, will have less food. IfÂ populations of those animalsÂ decrease, there will be less food forÂ apex predators such as tuna, sharks, and whales. Eventually,Â seafood becomes less available and more expensive for people.\n\nThese dangers areÂ compounded by the fact that plastics both leach out andÂ absorbÂ harmful Â pollutants. As plastics break down through photodegradation , they leach out colorants and chemicals, such asÂ bisphenol A (BPA), that have been linked toÂ environmental and health problems. Conversely, plastics can also absorb pollutants , such asÂ PCBs, from the seawater . These chemicals can then enter theÂ food chainÂ whenÂ consumed by marine life.\n\nPatching Up the Patch\n\nBecause the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is so far from any countryâs coastline , no nation will takeÂ responsibilityÂ or provide theÂ fundingÂ to clean it up. Charles Moore, the man who discovered the vortex , says cleaning up the garbage patch would âbankruptÂ any countryâ that tried it.\n\nMany individuals andÂ international organizations, however, are dedicated to preventing the patch from growing.\n\nCleaning up marine debris is not as easy as it sounds. Many microplastics are the same size as small sea animals, so nets designed to scoop up trash would catch these creatures as well. Even if we could design nets that would just catch garbage, the size of the oceans makes this job far too time-consuming to consider. The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administrationâs Marine Debris Program hasÂ estimated that it would take 67 ships one year to clean up less than one percent of the North Pacific Ocean.\n\nManyÂ expeditions haveÂ traveled through the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . Charles Moore, who discovered the patch in 1997, continues to raise awareness through his own environmental organization , the Algalita Marine Re search Foundation. During a 2014 expedition , Moore and his team usedÂ aerialÂ drones, toÂ assessÂ from above theÂ extentÂ of the trash below. The drones determined that there is 100 times more plastic by weight thanÂ previously measured . The team also discovered more permanent plastic features, or islands , some over 15 meters (50 feet) in length.\n\nAll the floating plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch inspired National GeographicÂ Emerging ExplorerÂ David de Rothschild and his team at Adventure Ecology to create a largeÂ catamaranÂ made of plastic bottles: theÂ Plastiki. The sturdiness of the Plastiki displayed the strength and durability of plastics , the creative ways that they can be repurposed, and the threat they pose to the environment when they donâtÂ decompose. In 2010, the crew successfullyÂ navigated the Plastiki from San Francisco, California, to Sydney, Australia.\n\nScientists and explorers agree that limiting or eliminating our use of disposable plastics and increasing our use of biodegradable resources will be the best way to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Organizations such as the Plastic Pollution Coalition and the Plastic Oceans Foundation are using social media and direct action campaigns to support individuals,Â manufacturers, andÂ businesses in theirÂ transitionÂ fromÂ toxic,Â disposable plastics to biodegradable or reusable materials."
