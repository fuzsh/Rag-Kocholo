        "text": "About speed limits\n\nSpeed Limits One Page Info Sheet (PDF)\n\nWhy we have speed limits\n\nA uniform speed of vehicles in a traffic flow results in the safest operation. Posted speed limits can help keep the traffic flowing smoothly provided the majority of drivers find the speed limits reasonable. This is called “voluntary compliance.” To best achieve voluntary compliance, the speed limits must be consistent throughout the state. Speed limits also give motorist an idea of a reasonable speed to drive in an unfamiliar location.\n\nWhen established properly, speed limits are essential for law enforcement to identify excessive speeds and curb unreasonable behavior.\n\nSpeed and safety\n\nLower speed limits don't reduce speeds\n\nStudies show that there is little change in speed patterns after posting a lower speed limit. Drivers are much more influenced by changes to the roadway, its environment and conditions.\n\nLower speed limits don't reduce crash frequency\n\nLower speed limits are often viewed as a quick fix to traffic safety, but this is not the case. Crashes are most often the result of other factors. In many cases, posting a lower speed limit creates a greater speed variance between the slowest and fastest-moving vehicles. This speed variance, also called “speed differential,” can contribute to crashes and make the roadway less safe.\n\nHow we set speed limits\n\nBy statute\n\nMinn. Statute 169.14 establishes statutory speed limits on most typical roadways under ideal conditions. Unless otherwise posted:\n\n10 mph in alleys\n\n30 mph on streets in urban districts\n\n55 mph on other roads\n\n65 mph on expressways\n\n65 mph on urban interstate highways\n\n70 mph on rural interstate highways\n\nBased on a traffic study\n\nAll other speed limits are set by the Commissioner of Transportation based upon an engineering and traffic investigation. These factors are considered:\n\nTest drive results speed study\n\nRoad type and condition\n\nLocation and type of access points (intersections, entrances, pedestrian access, etc.)\n\nSufficient length of roadway (1/4 mile minimum)\n\nExisting traffic control devices (signs, signals, etc.)\n\nCrash history, traffic volume, sight distances (curve, hill, etc.)\n\nTravel speed samples\n\nTypes of speed limits\n\nRegulatory\n\nA black and white sign shows the maximum speed that a motorist may travel under ideal conditions. It can be a statutory value or else it must be authorized by the Commissioner of Transportation.\n\nAdvisory\n\nA black and yellow speed sign is used with a hazard warning sign to advise motorists of a comfortable speed to navigate certain situations. For instance, when traveling on a winding road, the curve warning sign would be used with an advisory speed sign.\n\nSchool zone\n\nEnsuring the safety of children who cross public streets near schools is the responsibility of drivers, parents, school officials and road authorities. When combined with proven safety strategies, school zone speed limits can be effective.\n\nA Guide to Establishing Speed Limits in School Zones â 2023 Edition (PDF)\n\nA Guide to Establishing Speed Limits in School Zones â 2012 Edition For Refence Only (PDF)\n\nMnDOT’s Safe Routes to School program has more information on school zone safety.\n\nWork zone\n\nMnDOT outlines the guidelines, proper layouts and procedures for implementing various speed limit types to be used in work zones. Get more information in the Work Zone Speed Limits guide. Â\n\nQuestions\n\nState highways, U.S. highways, and interstates\n\nContact the district traffic engineer at your MnDOT district office.\n\nCounty roads and county highways\n\nContact the appropriate Minnesota county.\n\nCity streets"
