        "text": "LAKE SUPERIOR\n\nLake Superior looks like an ocean, living up to its status as the largest freshwater lake in the country — bigger than the other four Great Lakes combined. Start your North Shore adventure in the popular port-city of Duluth or explore the 154-mile stretch one of Minnesota's top vacation destinations in towns like Two Harbors, Tofte, Lutsen, Grand Marais, and more.\n\nBOUNDARY WATERS CANOE AREA WILDERNESS\n\nHome to more than 1,000 bodies of water, with canoes as the primary mode of transportation, this bucket list destination is a true wilderness. There are no cars, hotels, restaurants, electricity or other modern conveniences within its boundaries. The lakes range from tiny to vast, with portages, hiking trails, abundant wildlife and campsites available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nCHAIN OF LAKES\n\nEssentially five lakes in one, Bde Maka Ska, Harriet, Cedar, Brownie and Lake of the Isles offer a taste of the great outdoors in the heart of Minneapolis. Three of the four are connected and can be paddled as one; in some spots, you can't even tell you're in the city. Biking and running along the shores, dining at the lakeside eateries, and hitting the beaches are popular summer activities, with ice skating and hockey taking over in winter.\n\nLAKE MINNETONKA\n\nMade famous by Prince's iconic movie \"Purple Rain\", this large lake west of Minneapolis draws crowds seeking summertime fun, from sunbathing to sailing to wake surfing — a mash-up of wakeboarding and surfing. In winter, it plays host to ice fishing, snow kiting and the Chilly Open, an on-ice golf tournament.\n\nMILLE LACS LAKE\n\nThe state’s second largest lake, Mille Lacs, lies just 75 miles north of the Twin Cities. In addition to hiking shoes, be sure to pack tackle and pick up a fishing license beforehand as Mille Lacs Lake is home to excellent fishing and boating. Year-round fishing guides with equipment to spare are available for those who'd rather pack light without missing the action.\n\nGULL LAKE\n\nThe Brainerd Lakes area is a popular vacation destination in central Minnesota, and one of the biggest reasons is its biggest lake. Gull Lake is a draw for anglers, families and anyone looking for some fun on the water. Hop on a jet ski, pontoon, paddleboard or boat cruise, or come for the massive Ice Fishing Extravaganza that takes over the lake every January.\n\nLAKE VERMILION\n\nRaw and mostly untouched, this vast lake is dotted with 365 islands, many of them peppered with centuries-old pine trees. For the true Lake Vermilion camping experience, bring a canoe, kayak or boat and check out Hinsdale Island, which features boat-in campsites right on the shore.\n\nDETROIT LAKE\n\nWith more than 400 lakes within 25 miles, the town of Detroit Lakes is your go-to basecamp for summer fun. Find flea markets, giant trolls, lakeside dining, cozy cabins, lakeside hotels, and more.\n\nOTTER TAIL LAKE\n\nOtter Tail County is one of the state’s largest counties, and it’s filled with two things that define Minnesota: charming small towns and vibrant lake culture with its 1,048 lakes, more than any county in the United States.\n\nLAKE OF THE WOODS\n\nThe state's second-largest border lake is known for four seasons of great fishing for walleye, saugers, northerns and other species. In fact, winter fishing is even more popular than summer here, with resorts renting ice houses that have all the amenities of a deluxe cabin out on the frozen lake. Lake of the Woods is also home to the Northwest Angle, the northernmost point in the continental U.S., which can only be reached by boat or by driving through Canada.\n\nLAKE PEPIN\n\nGeographically, Lake Pepin is one of the state’s most interesting lakes. On the Mississippi River, near the charming town of Lake City, the lake is part of a valley carved by the melting of a glacial lake at the end of the most recent Ice Age.\n\nVOYAGEURS NATIONAL PARK\n\nRainy Lake is the gateway to Voyageurs National Park on the Canadian border and can be explored on guided boat tours, via personal canoe, kayak or motorboat, or on a houseboat, which serves as transportation and lodging in one. Once frozen, the lake is a haven for ice fishing and snowmobiling, and an ice road is plowed for cars and trucks. Rainy is one of four large (and dozens of smaller) lakes that make up Minnesota's uniquely water-based national park.\n\nFISHING\n\nMinnesota offers some of the country's best freshwater fishing in our many lakes. There are endless opportunities for charter fishing on Lake Superior, Lake Mille Lacs, and Lake of the Woods or contact a fishing guide to outfit you with the gear and show you the best spots. Find plenty of places to go fishing from the shoreline, including Minnesota’s largest fishing pier (612-feet to be exact) on Dower Lake in Staples, the new Panoway Lakewalk on Lake Minnetonka in Wayzata, and more.\n\nMake sure to get your fishing license from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources before you wet a line. A license is not required if you fish within Minnesota’s state park system.\n\nSWIMMING\n\nNearly all of Minnesota’s lakes are safe to swim in. Some of the most popular beaches in the state are Park Point in Duluth on Lake Superior (dubbed the \"world's largest freshwater sandbar\"), Hok-Si-La Municipal Park and Campground in Lake City on Lake Pepin, Father Hennepin State Park on Mille Lacs Lake, Zippel Bay State Park on Lake of the Woods, McCarthy Beach State Park on Sturgeon Lake, Detroit Lake Public Beach in Detroit Lakes, and Cedar Lake East Beach (known to locals as “Hidden Beach”).\n\nBOATING\n\nBoating is another popular pastime on Minnesota’s waterways. Motorized and non-motorized boats are available for rent on many lakes. Find some of the best places to kayak or canoe in Minnesota, paddle board, or paddle with kids. There are also great places to canoe or kayak in the middle of the city on one of Minneapolis’ beautiful lakes. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, Minnesota ranks second in the nation with a whopping 822,450 registered watercraft (over 10 feet) right behind Florida.\n\nDINING\n\nIf you would rather stay on shore and soak up the lake vibes, enjoy a meal and see spectacular views of the water in nearly ever corner of Minnesota. From small lakeside burger and pizza joints to more upscale spots with gorgeous decks, patios, and lakeside vibes, these waterfront dining spots can’t be missed."
