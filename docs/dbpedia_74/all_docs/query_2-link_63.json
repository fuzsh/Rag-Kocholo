        "text": "The ditty on gay cities\n\nGay cities are cities, big and small – size don’t matter – that are openly queer-friendly. From NYC to San Fran and Pitt to Port, if I can hold hands with my husband without fear, it’s a gay city. But some gay cities are more affordable than others. Find out which below.\n\nWhat you’ll find here:\n\nGay cities of the Northeast USA\n\nGay cities of the Southeast USA\n\nGay cities of the Midwest USA\n\nGay cities of the Northwest USA\n\nGay cities of the Southwest USA\n\nGay cities around the world\n\n10 best gay cities for gay singles\n\n8 best cities for gay couples\n\n5 best cities for LGBTQ millennials\n\nChecklist for moving out of state\n\nLive fabulously in affordable gay cities\n\nMigration to gay cities\n\nThere’s been a migration of corn-fed boys and small-town girls with big-city dreams to major (and expensive) LGBTQ-friendly cities for decades.\n\nBack in yore, gays and lesbians hid in these gay cities — like San Francisco, the queen gayborhoods — to live their lives in truth. We gathered in pockets of less desirable hoods in these larger cities.\n\nThe Castro today, though, isn’t The Castro of Harvey Milk. Chelsea and Boystown weren’t the exclusive enclaves they are today. Pre-Madonna, these hoods were dirty, crime-ridden places citizens forgot and governments tried to forget.\n\nThese were great sanctuaries for queer people to hide and thrive. It’s irony that our places of refuge made many marginalized residents marginally rich with their patience and DIY skills.\n\nLive fabulously in affordable gay cities\n\nAcceptance has improved in many parts of the country, and some still yearn to escape the phobia of smaller and rural towns. So, there’s still a draw to these now big-budget cities — one that poses a money problem for the average mo.\n\nMany seeking personal safety and acceptance now struggle with financial insecurity.\n\nWhile real estate and the cost of living has increased nationally since the 70s — exponentially in these first- and second-tier metros — many once-affordable gay locales are now million-dollar residentials Google employees can’t afford.\n\nFor gays and lesbians without six-figure incomes, that’s a problem.\n\nThat’s why we’re advocating for more people of “alternative lifestyles” to consider alternative cities to call home.\n\nBig gay cities, empty pockets\n\nWhile it’s fabulous living in a city with thousands of things to do seven nights a week with millions who look, act and vote like you, it’s also easy to become fabulously broke.

In addition, International Bear Week each September attracts gay bears, cubs and bear lovers from all over the globe, making it the high revenue-generating two-week period each year.\n\nSince 1996, when a few locals with anti-LGBTQ sentiments influenced the murder of a gay waiter, the City of Sitges has come out strongly condemning those actions and supporting a free and equal community for all in the area. Because of this, queer folks have become even more attracted to the beautiful beaches, low cost of living and the vibrant Catalan lifestyle.\n\n4. Dublin, IR\n\nThe Dublin of today is very different from that of U2 and the Cranberry videos of the 80s and 90s. Dublin saw a revival when taxes were lowered for both residents and corporations, the latter of which attracted jobs and job seekers from all over Ireland and Europe.\n\nIn 2015, roughly 4% of folks polled said they identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual. With LGBTQ rights since improving in Ireland, that’s likely higher now. Some neighborhoods in the gay city, such as Stoneybatter, Grand Canal Dock and Christchurch have over 8% of residents in same-sex couples. Holy moly!\n\nBecause of the high demand for nicer neighborhoods, jobs and the influx of money, prices in Dublin are not as low as many other European cities. But they’re much lower than NYC and many other US cities, with rents about 40% less and overall cost of living about 30% lower than the Big Apple.\n\n5. Johannesburg, SA\n\nDid you know that South Africa’s constitution is one of the few in the world that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation? That’s more progress than the US, many European countries and gay cities to which we flock for travel and living.\n\nNBC Out named South Africa as one of the 15 best countries for Expat Americans to move, too.\n\nIt’s roughly 70% cheaper to live in Johannesburg than NYC with rents running 83% cheaper. Your dollar will stretch further, too, especially if your earnings come from the US – taking advantage of geoarbitrage.\n\n6. Melbourne, AU\n\nMelbourne’s Australia’s second-largest city and the largest city in the state of Victoria, wherein the 2016 census showed that 27.1% of all same-sex couples lived. This makes it second only to New South Wales, Sydney’s home. Overall, roughly 3% of Australians identify as gay, lesbian or other, compared to just 2.6% in the US.\n\nMelbourne’s most expensive city on this international list because of its size and Australia’s booming economy. That being said, the cost of living in Melbourne is about 45% lower than NYC, with rents being a big chunk of that at about 63% below NYC.\n\n7. Bangkok, TH\n\nBangkok’s long been a draw for LGBTQ people because of its diversity and low cost of living. In 2017, the queer community, via a reader poll, named Bangkok the second most gay-friendly city in Asia, behind Tel Aviv.\n\nIn 2018, estimates of the LGBTQ population of Thailand was 8%, well above any other country on this list. Thailand enacted comprehensive anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity in 2015, although many locals still feel that discrimination exists.\n\nIncluding rent, living in Bangkok would cost you about 60% less than living in NYC. Rent’s approximately 75% cheaper.\n\n8. San Jose, CR\n\nSan Jose is the capital of Costa Rica and near the center of the country. It’s also the epicenter of LGBTQ activity in Costa Rica. 2019 was the first year that a president of Costa Rica marched in its annual Pride Parade, which attracts over 100,000 people. Same-sex marriage is set to become legal in 2020, as well.\n\nThe cost of living in San Jose would run about 61% lower than in NYC with rent coming in about 80% lower. This makes San Jose one of the most affordable international gay cities for queer Expats.\n\n9. San Juan, PR\n\nPuerto Rico’s a commonwealth of the United States and, thus, there many similar legal protections. Some protections, such as anti-discrimination employment laws, which the U.S. still doesn’t have, have been in place in Puerto Rico since 2013.\n\nSan Juan has a thriving gay scene, with many bars, restaurants, shops and hotels that are either LGBTQ-owned or are LGBTQ-friendly.\n\nLike many other cities on this list, rents in San Juan are much cheaper than in NYC. In fact, rents run about 76% lower, keeping San Juan’s overall cost of living about 52% below NYC’s.\n\n10. Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nThe queer capital of the Middle East, Tel Aviv, is full of great food, shopping, LGBTQ bars and clubs, beaches and festivals. In 2017, LGBTQ people named Tel Aviv the most gay-friendly city in Asia.\n\nRents in Tel Aviv run about 55% below NYC and overall costs are 33% lower.\n\n10 best gay cities for gay singles\n\n5 best expensive gay cities for gay singles\n\nSan Francisco CA – 44.7% of folks are single, 6.2% of folks are LGBTQ, Business Insider ranked it the 13th best city for LGBT singles\n\nBoston MA – 39.2% of folks are single, 4.8% are LGBTQ\n\nLos Angeles CA – 37.7% of residents are single, 4.6% of are queer, Business Insider named it the 12th best city for LGBTQ singles\n\nFt.

There are thriving arts, microbrew and outdoor enthusiast scenes, too.\n\nHow to finalize where you want to move\n\nThe American Moving and Storage Association says the average cost of to another state (moving 7,400 pounds 1,225 miles) is about $4,300 and the average cost of moving with your state (4 movers moving 7,400 pounds at $200 per hour) is about $2,300.\n\nWith that in mind, how do you budget and plan for a move? We share 15 steps below.\n\nChecklist for moving out of state\n\nThere’s more to moving than daydreaming or wanting to get out of Dodge. First, you want to be sure where you’re moving to is better than where you’re moving from. We like the places listed above but you might not.\n\nSecond, you’ll need to get your ducks in a row to make your move happen successfully. That’s what we spell out in the list below. Complete these 15 steps and it’ll be smooth sailing to the new gay city you’ll soon call home in no time.\n\n1. Visit new states or cities to move to\n\nOnce you picked the two or three cities you’d consider moving to, it’s time to decide which city wins your coveted crown. Here’s our 2-step plan to do just that.\n\nThe best part is that you get a mini-vacation with each visit and you’ll start funding your actual move.\n\nFirst, apply for a cash back rewards credit card. You’ll need a credit card from the start to the end of your move. It’ll make life easier and offer some protection. Examples include booking your Airbnb and flights to scope each city, as we recommend below, to hiring your moving company and buying your packing materials.\n\nSecond, schedule a trip to each city by booking both an Airbnb stay and, for cities that aren’t within driving distance, flights. We recommend staying in each city for three to five days, ideally including both week and weekend days. Try to book your Airbnb in the neighborhood(s) you’d most like to live in, if possible.\n\nUsing Airbnb rather than hotels will help you save money. Plus, if you get an Airbnb with a kitchen or kitchenette, you’ll save money by cooking most of your meals at the Airbnb.\n\n2. Find a place to live once you pick a state or city\n\nOnce you pick the new gay city you’ll call home, pick a place to live. If you’re buying a home, hire a real estate agent. The agent will assess your budget and needs, then find suitable homes for your review. Hopefully, from there, you find the perfect home and make an offer.\n\nThe right agent can make or break this experience. So, pick the right gal or guy.\n\nOf course, you may prefer or need to rent an apartment. Renting makes more sense than buying, too, until you’re 100% sure you want to live in your new city for more than five years.\n\nApartment hunting can be even harder than house hunting because so many apartments can feel the same, and like most guys on first dates, they can put on a good face until you make it your home and realize it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.\n\n3. Budget\n\nYou can now estimate that your move will cost between $2,300 to $4,300, and the sooner you start budgeting the better. This’ll ensure Dorothy doesn’t find herself broke before she clicks her heels. To avoid that, we’ve got two resources for you.\n\nSign up for our Budget Buster Bundle. With this bundle, we’ll walk you step-by-step with creating a dynamic budget that we and all our course members use. It’s super-detailed and will help you incorporate all your future moving expenses, so you aren’t caught off guard and aren’t stressed out.\n\n4. Prepare to move yourself\n\nIf you decide to physically move everything yourself to save even more money, you’ll need a truck. Gone are the days of throwing everything you own in the back of a VW.\n\nU-Haul has a great reputation and has proven itself to be easy and reliable to use. In fact, I used U-Haul to move from Central Pennsylvania to Denver Colorado after I decided to make my own move to my own gay city.\n\nIf you’d rather not drive your own truck, cause it can be kinda scary, hook yourself up with U-Pack once all your boxes are packed. U-Pack will deliver you a crate to put all your items, then you have three business days to load your crate before U-Pack returns to pick up your crate and move it to your new home.\n\nUpon arrival, you unpack everything yourself, and you save yourself a ton of money compared to hiring movers.\n\nRemember to use the credit card you sign up for in step 1 to book your reservation.\n\n5. Or, hire movers\n\nIf you choose to hire movers, do so ASAP so you have the flexibility to pick moving dates that work best for you. If you wait too close to moving day, you’ll have to be flexible with your dates. Fortunately, you can also hire U-Haul’s movers to move your stuff.\n\nAgain, remember to use the credit card you sign up for in step 1 to book your reservation.\n\n6. Buy moving insurance\n\nMoving’s not easy, things break and people can get hurt. So, protect yourself and your assets by purchasing moving insurance. It’s better to pay the small premium for insurance than to arrive at your new home with your dining room table broken into two.\n\n7. Clean house\n\nThe less you have to move, the cheaper and easier it will be to move. Here are four ways to downsize.\n\nGo all Marie Kondo and decide which of your belongings actually spark joy.\n\nTake the 12-12-12 Challenge: Pick 12 items to throw away, 12 to give away and 12 to be returned to their proper home.\n\nTry the 4-Box Method: Grab 3 boxes and a trashcan. Label the boxes “Put Away,” “Give Away” and “Sell.” Then, fill up each box and the trashcan accordingly.\n\nDo the Past/Future Exercise: Assess your emotions with every item you own (clothes, furniture, technology, art, etc.). If it generates a positive vibe, decide if it belongs in your new life in your new gay city. If not, donate it, sell it or trash it. If it generates a negative vibe, donate it, sell it or trash it.\n\nWhile you’re doing this exercise, remember that there are people in need. Before trashing anything, decide if you want to give it to a loved one or donate it to your local LGBTQ Center that has a donation program or Goodwill.\n\n8. Start packing\n\nOnce you’ve unloaded your non-essentials, start packing. Set a goal of packing one to two boxes a day over several weeks and packing won’t feel so painful.\n\n9. Update your utilities\n\nWhen you’re a month out from your move, start updating the utilities of yours that you’re moving with you.\n\nSome utilities, electric and landline phones, for example, depending on where you’re moving will follow you. Others, such as cable, you’ll have to cancel where you currently live and reconnect at your new home.\n\n10. Update homeowner’s/renter’s insurance\n\nAlso, a month before your move, update your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance, as appropriate. Even though you’re calling in advance of your official move, your insurance company or companies will be able to schedule the ending or starting or your insurance at the appropriate times.\n\n11. Say farewell\n\nMoving week will be hectic. If you wait until then to say goodbye to everyone, you’ll go crazy and you’ll forget someone. Start saying your goodbyes two weeks out. This way you won’t miss someone, and you reduce moving-week-stress.\n\n12. Update and forward your mail\n\nTwo weeks before your move, let everyone and everything, including the US Postal Service, know that you’re moving and what your new address is. Most of these updates, including the US Postal Service, can be made online to save a ton of time and hassle.\n\n13. Get your new driver’s license and vehicle registration\n\nOnce you’ve moved, update your driver’s license and vehicle registration. If you’re moving in-state, this can be updated online in most states. If you’re moving out of state, you’ll likely have to – UGH! – go to the DMV.\n\nSorry, but it’s true.\n\nBut busting this out sooner rather than later will make your life way easier to start. Plus, doing so will update your permanent residence for your voter registration. You don’t want to miss voting in an election, both local and national.\n\n14. Purchase pet license and tags\n\nIf you have a pet, update your pet’s license and tags as soon as you move. You don’t want Fido to get in trouble with the local authorities. That’s too scary for both of you.\n\n15. Update/buy pet insurance\n\nWhile you’re updating your pet’s license and tags, update or buy adequate pet insurance.\n\nLive fabulously in affordable gay cities\n\nThe leading spends in the LGBTQ community are travel, dining out, entertainment and personal hygiene – gurlz gotta have good hair.\n\nNone of these are cheap, and they’re made less affordable if rent, transportation and taxes eat up most of your income. So, what do most of us do when we’re confronted with high living expenses and the desire for a fabulous life?\n\nWe use our credit cards to support a lifestyle we can’t afford, rather than use them strategically and in our favor.\n\nThus, the reason why credit card debt is the leading financial concern of queer people. But personal security and financial security don’t need to be mutually exclusive. Living in one of the affordable gay cities above will give you the best of both.\n\nMore tips for preparing for a big move:\n\nWhy Nothing Will Change Until You Change Your Mind\n\nFreelance Writing Income Nets Gay Writers $60,000 a Year\n\nNote: This article contains affiliate links, meaning we’ll receive payment at no cost to you if you buy through these links.
