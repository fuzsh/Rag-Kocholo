        "text": "The Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Office is investigating what is believed to be a large-scale deer poaching scheme.\n\nIn mid-July they received a tip that led them to this discovery, and they contacted the DNR to aid in the investigation.\n\nThe area involved in the scheme covers approximately 200 square miles of land in Fond du Lac, Dodge, and Washington Counties.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Office also has information that they believe shows this operation has been occurring over the last 12 months.\n\nThe areas targeted by suspects fall within a perimeter between Campbellsport, Waucousta, Lomira, Theresa, West Bend, and Kewaskum. Anyone with information regarding the case is encouraged to speak out.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Office lists hearing gunshots overnight, locating deer carcasses with bullet wounds (Bucks would have the full head removed does would be intact), and observing deer alive or dead with bullet wounds outside of deer hunting season as possible information that could be key in finding the suspects.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing."
