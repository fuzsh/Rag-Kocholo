        "text": "The three-year Family Medicine Residency at Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota, offers an exceptional training experience. Despite being an internationally-known premier tertiary medical center, the program has a unique ability to provide community-based family medicine in a large academic environment. You will work alongside world-renowned physicians who have a passion for teaching and enjoy the close-knit feeling of our continuity clinic in Kasson, where we see a wide variety of patients. It's really the best of both worlds for training.\n\nAccreditation and certification\n\nThis program meets the training requirements as defined by the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) and is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).\n\nAfter successfully completing this residency, you are eligible to take the Family Medicine Certification Examination offered by ABFM.\n\nProgram history\n\nThe Family Medicine Residency at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, began training its first resident in 1978. Since then, nearly 270 residents have completed training in our program. Each year, nine residents are welcomed into our residency.\n\nThere is a well-established elective rotation in international travel medicine, during which you see patients for travel consultation, immunizations, and evaluation of recently returned travelers with travel-related illness.\n\nAdditionally, the Mayo International Health Program helps residents and fellows pursue elective rotations providing medical care to underserved international populations in well-planned and mentored settings. The program provides financial support to help defray travel and basic living expenses for those selected to participate."
