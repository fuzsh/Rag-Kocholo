        "text": "Description\n\nFDR shrewdly works on expanding Warm Springs: “There is no question in my mind that the Foundation should own this property”\n\nTLS, one page, 8 x 10.5, State of New York letterhead, May 15, 1929. Letter to his friend and business partner Basil O'Connor, written while at Warm Springs, Georgia. In part: \"I enclose correspondence…in regard to the purchase of the Bulloch property here, which gives us offer…I think the foundation should accept the offer and I am now trying to see if Mr. Bulloch will accept $1,000.00 or less in cash, turning over the land to us with the Federal mortgage on it…There is no question in my mind that the Foundation should own this property, and since you left I have been taking up the question of a possible Inn on that land for transients, tourists, and the local Manchester people—all on the basis of our putting up no capital.\" In fine condition, with two file holes to the left edge. Accompanied by an unsigned typed memorandum regarding Boy Scouts on adjoining land, dated November 29, 1929.\n\nIn 1924, FDR traveled to Warm Springs, Georgia, where he found that immersion in the area's mineral-rich warm water was one of the few things that provided relief from his polio-induced paralysis. Shortly thereafter he partnered with Basil O'Connor to purchase the resort and develop it into a world-class polio treatment center: the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Fine Autograph and Artifacts Featuring John F.
