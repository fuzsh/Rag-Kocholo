        "text": "As people around the globe engage in last-minute holiday gift shopping and search for the perfect Christmas tree, a plantation that once grew and sold the latter product lies idle, its history somewhat forgotten.\n\nBack in the 1930s and 1940s, local residents had the unique opportunity to purchase a Christmas tree from then sitting U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nFDR became interested in forestry while on his honeymoon in Europe in 1905 and six years later he directed Springwood’s employees to clear overgrown farmland on a portion of the family estate to prepare it for a massive tree planting initiative. From 1911-1938, Roosevelt purchased surrounding parcels that spanned from the east side of Route 9 at Springwood to Val-Kill, Eleanor Roosevelt’s home along Route 9G, following his death in 1945.\n\nIn effect, the multiple land purchases doubled the size of the original estate. FDR took an aggressive approach in attempting to replicate the beautiful forests he observed in Europe onto the newly acquired property.\n\nIn 1912, he ordered 5,000 white pine and 1,000 lots of Norway spruce, Scotch pine and red pine seedlings to start his operation. For the most part, Roosevelt repeated the large-scale ordering process every year from 1912 through his death in 1945 in Warm Springs, Georgia. Due to his constant support of his hometown state, the vast majority of the trees ordered originated in New York.\n\nFDR wasn’t the only person in the region who began to develop vast areas of their property into lush forests. In addition to fellow Hyde Park estate owners Archibald Rogers and Frederick Vanderbilt — and his predecessors — Millbrook’s Charles Dietrich and Samuel and Oakleigh Thorne, began to transform former farmland into tree plantations.\n\nFDR’s foresting initiative generated attention and high grades from a number of organizations. In 1931, he hosted a visit to Springwood with members of the New York and New England chapters of the Society of American Foresters, who marveled at all FDR had accomplished.\n\nDuring the mid-1920s, FDR started to focus on the production of Christmas trees, which resulted in his oversight of approximately 50,000 seedlings being planted annually on his property. The trees, which included Norway spruce, Canadian white spruce and Balsam fir, were sold to the public.\n\nFDR sent letters to New York City department stores, including Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, just prior to the holiday season, encouraging them to purchase trees from his plantation. Ever the perfectionist, he mandated that before being cut the trees had to be 3- to 7-feet in height, cone-shaped and bushy in order to support a good quantity of ornaments.\n\nThe trees were sold in the 50-cents to $3 range. Aside from commercial sales, in 1943 Roosevelt gifted Christmas trees to the Crown Princess of Norway and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, shipping them overseas so they would arrive in time for Christmas.\n\n“Eleanor Roosevelt mentioned selling Christmas trees in Manhattan in her ‘My Day’ newspaper column,” said Hyde Park Historian Shannon Butler. “She wrote that in 1948 she and her son Elliott visited a lot on 124th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, where their trees were being sold.”\n\nIn his lifetime, FDR planted a half-million trees on his property and cited the tulip poplar tree as his personal favorite; the leaf of that tree was adopted as the official logo of the Hyde Park trail system.\n\n“Sometime after FDR died, the property was sold by his heirs and eventually it was owned by a development company,” said Steve Rosenberg, senior vice president of Scenic Hudson. “We acquired it in 2004 to make it available to the public, and in 2007 we sold it to the National Park Service, which oversees it today.”\n\nToday, the public can walk Roosevelt Farm Lane, the woodland trails that FDR designed from an entrance just south of the Hyde Park Drive-In along Route 9, or along Route 9G, across from Val-Kill.\n\n“Dateline” appears Wednesdays.
