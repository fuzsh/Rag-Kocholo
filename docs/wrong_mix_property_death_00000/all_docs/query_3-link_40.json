        "text": "Warm Springs, health resort, Meriwether county, western Georgia, U.S. It lies about 20 miles (30 km) southeast of LaGrange, near Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park. The springs discharge about 800 gallons (3,000 litres) of water per minute at a temperature of about 88 °F (31 °C). The national prominence of the springs dates from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s visit there in 1924 following an attack of polio. Convinced that the warm waters would aid in the aftercare of polio victims who needed supported exercise, Roosevelt organized the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation in 1927. This nonprofit corporation developed a complete medical community there; its 940-acre (380-hectare) facility was purchased by the state of Georgia in 1973. The Little White House was built at Warm Springs in 1932 for Roosevelt to use while he was taking his treatments; he died there on April 12, 1945, and the house became a state historic site in 1948.\n\nThe city of Warm Springs, just southeast of the springs, developed as a railroad junction for the resort and was incorporated in 1924. Pop. (2000) 485; (2010) 425."
