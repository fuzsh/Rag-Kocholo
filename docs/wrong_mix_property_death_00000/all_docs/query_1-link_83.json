        "text": "When did Franklin D. Roosevelt become Governor of New York State and how long did he serve?\n\nFrankin D. Roosevelt was the 44th Governor of New York State and served two terms from 1929 to 1932 before being elected as President of the United States.\n\nHow many New York State Governors went on to become President of the United States?\n\nFour NYS Governors went on to become President of the United States: Martin Van Buren (1899), Grover Cleveland (1883-1885), Theodore Roosevelt (1899-1900), and Franklin D. Roosevelt (1929-1932).\n\nWhen did Franklin D. Roosevelt contract Polio?\n\nIn 1921, at the age of 39, Roosevelt was diagnosed with infantile paralysis known as polio.\n\nIs it true he made his own wheelchairs from everyday chairs?\n\nRoosevelt found the standard wheelchair of the 1920s to be too bulky and difficult to get around in so he designed his own wheelchairs by replacing the legs of modern dining chairs with bicycle-like wheels.\n\nWhat is the FDR Memorial Pool?\n\nIn 1929, a greenhouse at the NYS Executive Mansion was transformed into a heated therapy pool for Roosevelt that replicated the heated swimming therapy he received prior to his term as governor in Warm Springs, Georgia.\n\nIs the FDR Memorial Pool at the Executive Mansion still active today?\n\nIn 1988, Governor Mario M. Cuomo oversaw the pool’s restoration and rededication to Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the pool is functional today, it is used as a historical memorial and symbolic artifact of Roosevelt’s connection to Albany.\n\nHow did FDR go upstairs in the Executive Mansion?\n\nGovernor Roosevelt had an elevator installed in the Executive Mansion so he could go through the house with ease. The elevator still exists and is located near the kitchen. Roosevelt would be dropped by car at the back of the house and enter the home from the rear.\n\nHow was Theodore Roosevelt related to Franklin and Eleanor?\n\nTheodore Roosevelt was Eleanor Roosevelt’s uncle; his brother was Eleanor’s father. Franklin was Theodore’s fifth cousin."
