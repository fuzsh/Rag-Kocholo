        "text": "Our first stop back in Georgia was Frankin D Roosevelt SP (for a 2-night stay), which is Georgia’s largest State Park at 9,045 acres. Driving into the park you drive along the top of the ridge of Pine Mountain which has a 37 km hiking trail encircling it. Pine Mountain ridge is the southernmost mountain ridge in the Eastern US. Franklin D Roosevelt loved this area and as the creator of the CCC, they built a large stone building now used as the visitor centre for the park. The building was built in 1938 and they used native Hollis Quartzite from the area. After we dropped back down to the campground and got setup we did a 6.5 km hike on the Mountain Creek loop trail.\n\nThe next day we went on our most challenging hike of this trip. The total was 15 kms and the elevation gain was 402 metres. We left from the campground and followed Long Leaf Loop trail to the Liberty Bell Pool. This was another CCC project when building this park. It is a spring fed pool, and the rangers were doing some repair work on the stones so it could be opened for the summer. The trail took us right by the output from the spring that feeds the pool. From here the trail started to climb and we went up and over the mountain to the other side and then followed part of the Pine Mountain trail by the cottages and to the visitor centre. Then we carried on to the connector that would eventually take us back to the campground. A long hike on a warm day but very enjoyable.\n\nOn the day we left the park we decided to stop at Dowdell’s Knob and then travel on to the Little White House in Warm Springs. Franklin D Roosevelt was the 32nd President of the United States and he was the last President that served 4 consecutive terms. Later the legislation was changed so a President could only be in office for 2 consecutive terms of 4 years. He had polio and he made 41 trips (1924-1945) to the Warm Springs area so he could soak in the warm spring water to ease his polio. On these trips he would often go to Dowdell’s Knob to enjoy the view and have a fancy picnic lunch. The knob juts out from Pine Mountain and is at an elevation of 1395’ above sea level so has a great view of the valley.\n\nOur next stop was FDR’s Little White House in Warm Springs. I decided to try using Copilot which is an AI tool from Microsoft to write this section and it seems quite good so I will use that for the description with a few modifications and then add in key slides from the photos we took. Let us know what you think about this AI driven section?\n\nNestled in the pine-scented foothills of Georgia lies a modest yet historically rich cottage known as the Little White House. This unassuming abode in Warm Springs is not just any house; it was the personal retreat of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Today, it stands as a poignant museum, capturing a slice of American history and the enduring spirit of a leader who shaped the nation. The story of the Little White House begins with a personal quest for healing. Stricken by polio in 1921, Roosevelt sought the therapeutic mineral springs of Warm Springs, which he believed could aid his recovery. The warm, buoyant waters offered relief and a semblance of normalcy, leading him to purchase the land in 1926. Roosevelt was very conscious of his polio and did not want people to pity him, so he designed wheelchairs, braces, and car controls to mask his condition. He also made sure that any photos were staged such that it did not appear he had polio. The house, completed in 1932, served as a sanctuary where Roosevelt could escape the pressures of Washington and find solace in the tranquil Georgia landscape.\n\nWe started our visit with the Museum and then walked along the row of state flags with their unique stones from those states. Then we visited the Little White House cottage which is like stepping back in time. The six-room cottage is preserved almost exactly as it was on the day of Roosevelt’s passing in April 1945. The simplicity of the furnishings and the absence of grandeur reflect the personal side of a man more often associated with the weighty affairs of state. Here, one can imagine Roosevelt contemplating the New Deal policies or hosting dignitaries, all while gazing out at the serene forest from the patio. It was in this very house that Roosevelt developed key aspects of his New Deal, including the Rural Electrification Administration, which revolutionized life in rural America by bringing electricity to remote areas. The Little White House also bore witness to Roosevelt’s compassion for fellow polio sufferers, leading to his support for the March of Dimes, a pivotal organization in the fight against polio.\n\nOne of the most haunting exhibits is the unfinished portrait of Roosevelt by Elizabeth Shoumatoff. As Roosevelt sat for this portrait on April 12, 1945, he suffered a massive stroke and passed away shortly after. The incomplete painting is a stark reminder of the sudden end of an era. A trip to the Little White House is more than a historical excursion; it’s an intimate encounter with the past. The Little White House is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the indelible mark of a president who led a nation through some of its darkest times. It’s a must-visit for history buffs and anyone looking to understand the personal side of American leadership.\n\nWhen we left the Little White House, we decided to stop in Warm Springs to see the actual pools that FDR visited. A project has been approved to fully renovate the pools so they can be used again. There was a museum talking all about Polio but unfortunately, we were short of time to read everything. We did talk to the host for a bit and went out into the pools to feel the 88F water flowing from the spring. We could imagine what this would be like after it is restored based on our trip through Hot Springs Arkansas last year.\n\nOne of the camp hosts we met told us about Chattahoochee Bend SP, so we decided to check it out with a 3-night stay. The park covers 2,900 acres and is Georgia’s 5th largest state park. It is the youngest state park as it just opened in July of 2011, and this showed with how separated all the campsites were from each other. The Chattahoochee River flows from the Blue Ridge Mountains and acts as a border between Georgia and Alabama and then eventually flows through Florida to the Gulf of Mexico. On our first full day we did a 16.5 km hike to the Northern end of the park to the actual bend in the river that the park is named after. We had heard from another hiker that many of the trails were impassable due to flooding, and we could really see what had happened based on the mud surrounding the creek crossings. The ranger later told us that heavy rains had caused the river to overflow with a 20’ rise in depth! The first part of the trail was flat, and we even got to see a small deer swim across the river and climb up the bank on the other side. Eventually the trail started to twist and turn up through the forest and we saw some interesting rock outcroppings and some box turtle shells. Unfortunately, the trail markings were inaccurate, so the hike ended up being a lot longer than we had planned. We finally reached the bend and there were campsites there that in theory could be used by canoe campers but the ramp was completely covered with mud from the flooding so it would be difficult to get a canoe out. On the way back we decided to short cut some of the large trail bends and just go through the woods to the next section of the trail. This allowed us to cut just over 3 kms out of the return trip. A tiring but very enjoyable hiking day.\n\nThe next day we decided to do some of the MTB trails. We did 11.5 kms but the trail map of the biking trails wasn’t very good. At times it was difficult to figure out exactly where you were when trails crossed. The map would show two trails crossing but then you got there, there would be three trails. Eventually we found our way, just a bit frustrating as a few ‘you are here’ signs would make a world of difference. Maybe they are just developing the MTB trail system. Joel did enjoy the big downhill ride along the road, good thing he didn’t get a speeding ticket. Sharon thinks she’ll need new brakes when she gets home. Back at our campsite we saw an Armadillo foraging for food.\n\nOn our last morning, we tried to pack up quickly to avoid the rain. Unfortunately, Joel got a bit wet at the dump station, good thing he has a Gortex jacket. The rain was really coming down, making it hard to see. The town of Newnan has some historic houses, but we just viewed them while driving and tried to get a few pictures through the wet windows. We made a grocery stop and then another Mexican food lunch. Sharon had the usual Margarita, and I had the Negra Modelo beer. I had the spicy fish sandwich while Sharon had a blackened shrimp bowl. Seems like every town has a Mexican restaurant.\n\nOur next blog will continue to cover the Georgia state parks we are visiting in this segment of our trip as we gradually work our way home."
