        "text": "Biography\n\nBorn in the year 1954, Shri Sudhir Mehta, is the driving force behind the strong presence of ‘Torrent’ in Pharmaceuticals and Power sectors. Shri Mehta was instrumental in the diversification of the Torrent Group into the power sector. The foray into Power was marked by the acquisition of the ailing Mahendra Cables, now known as Torrent Cables Limited in late 80’s. This was followed by acquisition of The Ahmedabad Electricity Company and The Surat Electricity Company in the early 90’s; now part of Torrent Power Limited. Shri Mehta took over as the Chairman of the Torrent Group in 1998, after the demise of his father, late Shri U. N. Mehta. Under the able leadership of Shri Sudhir Mehta, Torrent Group grew from its humble roots into a leading business Group. Under his able guidance, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Torrent Pharma”) today has a strong presence in various therapeutic segments with three world-class operational manufacturing plants and a state-of-the-art research centre. Torrent Pharma’s global operations are spread across substantially in 28 countries with wholly owned subsidiaries in most major markets. The acquisition of the Indian branded generic formulation business of Elder Pharmaceuticals Limited is expected to strengthen Torrent Pharma’s position in the nutraceuticals and women healthcare segments in India. Alongside, Torrent Power today has a strong foothold in generation, distribution and transmission segments. The Company has a generation capacity of ~3252 MW. It distributes power to nearly 23 lacs customers in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat and Dahej SEZ area in Gujarat as a “distribution licensee” and to nearly 6 lacs customers in the cities of Agra and Bhiwandi as a “distribution franchisee”. It has also set up power transmission infrastructure in Gujarat."
