        "text": "Torrent Power is one of the leading brands in the Indian Power sector, promoted by the Rs 37,600-Crore Torrent Group – committed to its mission of transforming life by serving two of the most critical needs - healthcare and power. It is an integrated power utility and is one of the largest private sector players in India having interests in power generation, transmission, distribution and manufacturing and supply of power cables.\n\nTorrent Power foresaw the prospects in the power sector much before the liberalization, when it took-over and successfully turned around an ailing power cable company Mahendra Electricals, renaming it as ‘Torrent Cables Ltd.’ (now merged with Torrent Power Limited w.e.f. 1st April, 2014). The high points of Torrent’s foray into power however were the acquisitions of two of the India’s oldest utilities – The Surat Electricity Company Ltd and The Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. Torrent turned them into first rate power utilities, in terms of operational efficiencies and reliability of power supply.\n\nTorrent Power has a generation capacity of 4160 MW and distributes power to over 4 million customers in the cities of Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat, Dahej SEZ and Dholera SIR in Gujarat; Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Bhiwandi, Shil, Mumbra & Kalwa in Maharashtra and Agra in Uttar Pradesh."
