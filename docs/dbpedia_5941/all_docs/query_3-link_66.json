Prefer Weekdays\n\nPrices are usually cheaper during the week than at weekends or during holiday periods.\n\n3. Ski in the Low Season\n\nSkiing outside the peak season means saving money, benefiting from fewer visitors to the resort and shorter waiting times. More piste for less money!\n\n4. Compare Days"
