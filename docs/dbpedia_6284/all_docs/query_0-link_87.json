        "text": "Adventures by Morse\n\nAdventures by Morse was a 52-episode syndicated adventure series produced, written and directed by Carlton E. Morse shortly after NBC canceled his I Love a Mystery series.\n\nCaptain Bart Friday was a globe-trotting San Francisco-based private investigator, portrayed during the series by Elliott Lewis, David Ellis and Russell Thorson. Friday's sidekick from Texas, Skip Turner, was played mostly by Jack Edwards and occasionally by Barton Yarborough. The tales covered such areas as espionage, kidnapping and murder, along with secret Nazi bases, snake worshipers and voodoo.\n\nView Show\n\nAdventures of Dick Tracy\n\nDick Tracy had a long run on radio, from 1934 weekdays on NBC's New England stations to the ABC network in 1948. Bob Burlen was the first radio Tracy in 1934, and others heard in the role during the 1930s and 1940s were Barry Thompson, Ned Wever and Matt Crowley. The early shows all had 15-minute episodes.\n\nThe beginning of the 1 May 1945 episode (\"The Case Of The Empty Safe\") was interrupted on the Blue Network for a \"special news flash\" relating that Adolf Hitler had \"died of a stroke.\" Copies of this episode, complete with the mistaken news flash--Hitler had committed suicide the day before, not died of a stroke--still exist today.\n\nView Show\n\nAdventures of Superman, The\n\nSuperman came to radio as a syndicated show on New York City's WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942, to February 4, 1949, as a 15-minute serial, running three or, usually, five times a week. From February 7 to June 24, 1949 it ran as a thrice-weekly half-hour show. The series shifted to ABC Saturday evenings on October 29, 1949, and then returned to afternoons, twice-a-week on June 5, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.\n\nView Show\n\nAdventures of the Falcon, The\n\nThe Falcon radio series premiered on the Blue Network on April 10, 1943, continuing on NBC and Mutual until November 27, 1954. Some 70 episodes were produced.\n\n“Drexel Drake” (a pseudonym of Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a free-lance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, The Falcon's Prey. It was followed by two more novels (The Falcon Cuts In, 1937 and The Falcon Meets a Lady, 1938) and a 1938 short story. In 1941, RKO made a movie, The Gay Falcon, based on a 1940 short story, \"Gay Falcon,\" by Michael Arlen, rechristening Arlen's Gay Stanhope Falcon as Gay Lawrence aka the Falcon. It became a film series, and its popularity led eventually to the radio series. No explanation for the nickname was ever mentioned in any of the dramatizations. The Michael Waring Falcon was also the hero in three late 1940s movies starring John Calvert, and a television series starring Charles McGraw.\n\nLike the Falcon film series, the radio plots mixed danger, romance and comedy in equal parts. Each show began with a telephone ringing and Michael Waring, the Falcon, answering the phone. Speaking with a woman whose voice was never heard, Waring would explain that he had an urgent situation in which he had to deal with criminals. This led into the standard opening, followed by the week's tale of adventure. Often, incompetent police were unable to solve the mysteries without his help.\n\nView Show\n\nAnn of the Airlanes\n\nAnn of the Airlanes was a syndicated radio adventure drama series broadcast between 1932 and the 1950s.\n\nThe story focused on Ann Burton, an airplane hostess employed by Interstate Airlines. She also worked with the Secret Service, as did her romantic interest, pilot Jack Baker. Gerald Mohr portrayed Secret Service agent and co-pilot Art Morrison. Also in the cast was John Gibson who portrayed Pete.\n\nThere were more than a few radio aviation dramas during the 1930s, but this was the only one with a female lead.\n\nView Show\n\nBold Venture\n\nBold Venture was the first radio program staring Humphrey Bogart who resisted doing live radio shows because of the time involved. Since this series was transcribed he accepted the offer.\n\nHumphrey Bogart plays the part of Slate Shannon hotel owner and owner of a boat called the \"Bold Venture\". He was ready to rescue a friend in need or hunt down and enemy. The setting for the series is Havana, Cuba.\n\nOther regular cast members include his wife Lauren Bacall, who plays the part of Sailor Duval, and Jester Hairson who plays the part of King Moses, a calypso singer. Of the 78 episodes produced, 57 are in circulation today.\n\nView Show\n\nBox 13\n\nBox 13 was a syndicated radio series about the escapades of newspaperman-turned-mystery novelist Dan Holliday, played by film star Alan Ladd. Created by Ladd's company, Mayfair Productions, Box 13 premiered in New York City on December 31, 1947, on Mutual's New York flagship, WOR.\n\nTo seek out new ideas for his fiction, Holliday ran a classified ad in the Star-Times newspaper where he formerly worked: \"Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything -- write Box 13, Star-Times.\" The stories followed Holliday's adventures when he responded to the letters sent to him by such people as a psycho killer and various victims.\n\nSylvia Picker appeared as Holliday's scatterbrained secretary, Suzy, while Edmund MacDonald played police Lt. Kling. Supporting cast members included Betty Lou Gerson, Frank Lovejoy, Lurene Tuttle, Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten and John Beal. Vern Carstensen, who directed Box 13 for producer Richard Sanville, was also the show's announcer.\n\nView Show\n\nBuck Rogers\n\nIn 1932, the Buck Rogers radio program, notable as the first science fiction program on radio, hit the airwaves. Initially broadcast as a 15 minute show on CBS in 1932, it was on a Monday through Thursday schedule. In 1936, it moved to a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule and went off the air the same year. Mutual brought the show back and broadcast it three days a week from April to July 1939 and from May to July 1940, a 30 minute version was broadcast on Saturdays. From September 1946 to March 1947, Mutual aired a 15 minute version on weekdays.\n\nThe radio show again related the story of our hero Buck finding himself in the 25th century.\n\nView Show\n\nCalling all Detectives\n\nCalling All Detectives ran from 1945-1950, the shows format was a combination of Quiz show and Detective drama. The host Paul Barnes played all the characters in each episode. His primary role was that of Detective Browning. Barnes would start the short crime drama then during a commercial break he would dial a random telephone number from the phone book, the listener would then try to figure the answer to the mystery, then Barnes would finish the rest of the original drama. Some of the listeners were unaware of what was going on during the phone call part of the show, this resulted in Barnes only calling the numbers that had been sent into the show from listeners.\n\nView Show\n\nCaptain Midnight\n\nCaptain Midnight was developed at the Blackett, Sample and Hummert advertising agency in Chicago, Captain Midnight began as a syndicated show in 1938, airing through the spring of 1940 on a few Midwest stations, including Chicago's WGN. In 1940, Ovaltine, a product of The Wander Company, took over sponsorship. With Pierre Andre as announcer, the series was then heard nationally on the Mutual Radio Network where it remained until 1942. It moved to the Merchandise Mart and the NBC Blue Network in September 1942. When the U.S. Government broke up the NBC Red and Blue Networks, Ovaltine moved the series back to Mutual, beginning September 1945, and it remained there until December, 1949.\n\nView Show\n\nChallenge of the Yukon\n\nChallenge of the Yukon was a radio series that began on Detroit's station WXYZ (as had The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet), and an example of a Northern genre story. The series was first heard on February 3, 1938. The title changed from Challenge of the Yukon to Sergeant Preston of the Yukon in November 1951, and remained under that name through the end of the series.\n\nView Show\n\nCharlotte Greenwood Show, The\n\nThe Charlotte Greenwood was a situation comedy that originally aired as a replacement for the Bobo Hope Show, but after having a popular summer it would run for five years on the air. The show stared Charlotte Greenwood as Aunt Charlotte who raises three Barton children wile running a lunchroom and a not very productive farm. The show would also feature guest appearances by country musician Eddy Arnold as the Lawyer Mr. Reynolds.\n\nThese recordings are pretty rare and the sound quality for some episodes might be pretty poor.\n\nView Show\n\nDavid Harding Counterspy\n\nCounterspy was an espionage drama radio series that aired on the NBC Blue Network (later the ABC) and Mutual from May 18, 1942 to November 29, 1957.\n\nDavid Harding (played by Don MacLaughlin) was the chief of the United States Counterspies, a unit engaged during World War II in counterintelligenceagainst Japan's Black Dragon and Germany's Gestapo. United States Counterspies was a fictional government agency devised by the program's creator,Phillips H. Lord after Lord \"had a certain amount of difficulty with J. Edgar Hoover over story content in Gang Busters.\"Mandel Kramer played Peters, Harding's assistant.\n\nThe program's plots progressed through three phases. During World War II they involved \"threats from the Axis powers.\" After the war ended, Cold War threats took precedence. In the third phase, \"they addressed all manner of illegal activities.\n\nView Show\n\nDr. Christian\n\nDr. Christian practiced in the Midwest town of River's End with the assistance of Nurse Judy Price. The small-town physician's good humor, innate common sense and scientific training helped drive off a series of villainous types who tried to interfere with the peaceful lifestyle of River's End, as well as dealing with personal problems among his many patients and the majority of those who lived in town.\n\nThe program was also unique in that, by the mid-1940s, listeners contributed the majority of the scripts (some were \"professionally polished\" before they were used), and an annual script-writing competition introduced in 1942 was the highlight of every season-top prize: the $2,000 \"Dr. Christian Award\" {with several $500 \"runner-up\" prizes}; among the later winners were Rod Serling and Earl Hamner, Jr.. Produced by Dorothy McCann, the radio series became a popular success, continuing on CBS until January 6, 1954.\n\nView Show\n\nFibber McGee and Molly\n\nFibber McGee and Molly premiered on NBC April 16, 1935. Almost all stories took place at the McGee's Home 79 Wistful Vista. The show existed in world where money was never and issue and the McGees never had jobs. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes, antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends in and out of the quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.\n\nView Show\n\nFrontier Gentleman\n\nFrontier Gentleman was originally broadcast on the CBS network from February 2 to November 16, 1958.\n\nThe program opened with a trumpet theme by Jerry Goldsmith and this introduction:\n\nHerewith, an Englishman's account of life and death in the West. As a reporter for the London Times, he writes his colorful and unusual accounts. But as a man with a gun, he lives and becomes a part of the violent years in the new territories. Now, starring John Dehner, this is the story of J. B. Kendall, Frontier Gentleman...\n\nView Show\n\nGreen Hornet, The\n\nThe Green Hornet, premiered on January 31, 1936, on WXYZ, the same local Detroit station that originated its companion shows The Lone Ranger and Challenge of the Yukon. Beginning on April 12, 1938, the station supplied the series to the Mutual Broadcasting System radio network, and then to NBC Blue and its successors, the Blue Network and ABC, from November 16, 1939, through September 8, 1950. It returned from September 10 to December 5, 1952.[3] It was sponsored by General Mills from January to August 1948, and by Orange Crush in its brief 1952 run.\n\nView Show\n\nGunsmoke\n\nGunsmoke ran for nine seasons and was broadcast by CBS.

The programme started on 18 September 1939 and continued until 30 April 1945, when Hamburg was overrun by the British Army. This nickname, Lord Haw-Haw, generally refers to William Joyce, who was German radio's most prominent English-language speaker and to whom it gradually came to be exclusively applied.

Nazis suck.\n\nView Show\n\nMel Blanc Show, The\n\nThe Mel Blanc Show, which ran from September 3, 1946, to June 24, 1947.

The series promised stories from the greatest classical and contemporary mystery authors -- and production values to match. And it kept its promise. It was aided from the outset by the addition of an 'annotator'-- as it was described in the 1940s --named Geoffrey Barnes. The annotator served in the role of expositor, filling in on the plot development as necessary and providing a back-story when needed. The apparent distinction made between a narrator and an annotator, was a matter of degree. Mr. Barnes, a distinguished and celebrated amateur criminologist in his own right, was apparently on hand to help the listener analyze and understand the various mysteries and their underlying crimes within each script.\n\nView Show\n\nOur Miss Brooks\n\nOur Miss Brooks is an American situation comedy starring Eve Arden as a sardonic high school English teacher.

The syndicated series aired from 1939 to 1940 in 15-minute installments.\n\nThe plots of Rohmer's insidious figure and Smith and Petrie's attempts to thwart the archenemy formed a repetitive theme in the story line. A stunningly exotic Karamaneh became the slave girl of the evil doctor; an objective of the combatants was to secure her release. The series, though brief, is memorable, and focused on one of the most effective villains to surface in adolescent radio.\n\nView Show\n\nSix Shooter, The\n\nThe Six Shooter lasted only one season of 39 episodes on NBC (Sept. 20, 1953-June 24, 1954).

He is pals with Lieutenant Bill Miggs of the police force, who tips him off to hot crime news. Also in on the capers is Morgan's \"Gal Friday\", Carol Curtis, played by Adele Jurgens. The three meet all types -- mostly on the shady side of the street.\n\nIn real life, Glen and Adele were husband and wife, the two marrying in 1949. They had met on the movie set of The Treasure of Monte Cristo. On the show, the repartee between the two is strictly old school and quite enjoyable. The dialogue is solid and makes the most of the plots. Unheralded and left for dead, Stand By for Crime is well worth your time.\n\nView Show\n\nVic and Sade\n\nVic and Sade was an American radio program created and written by Paul Rhymer. It was regularly broadcast on radio from 1932 to 1944, then intermittently until 1946, and was briefly adapted to television in 1949 and again in 1957.\n\nThe central characters, known as \"radio's home folks,\" were accountant Victor Rodney Gook, his wife Sade and their adopted son Rush. The three lived on Virginia Avenue in \"the small house halfway up in the next block.\" The program was presented with a low-key ease and naturalness, and Rhymer's humorous dialogue was delivered with a subtleness that made even the most outrageous events seem commonplace and normal.\n\nView Show\n\nWhistler, The\n\nThe Whistler was an American radio mystery drama which ran from May 16, 1942 until September 22, 1955.\n\nThe stories followed a formula in which a person's criminal acts were typically undone either by an overlooked but important detail or by their own stupidity. On rare occasions a curious twist of fate caused the story to end happily for the episode's protagonist. Ironic twist endings were a key feature of each episode. The Whistler himself narrated, often commenting directly upon the action, taunting the criminal from an omniscient perspective.\n\nView Show\n\nWhitehall 1212\n\nWhitehall 1212, named after the then famous telephone number of Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police Force, the show was written and directed by Wyllis Cooper and broadcast by NBC. Whitehall 1212 told the story of a case entirely from the point of view of the police starting from the crime scene.
