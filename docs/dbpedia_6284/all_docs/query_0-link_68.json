        "text": "It's that time again. This has been a horrific year in many ways, but we certainly can't complain about the state of the Blu-ray industry. It may be tightening its belt in some ways - I recorded fewer audio commentaries this year than last - but the quality of the product coming out is nothing short of dazzling, opulent, fetishistic. As always, I can't see everything and I'm guided somewhat by my own interests and biases; this list is understandably limited to what I saw, some of which was provided to me (thank you!) and some of which was bought. I couldn't settle on a Top 10 or even a Top 20; the total number of films (and different versions of films) in my main list total 66 movies. And, as John Cassavetes says in HUSBANDS, that's as far as I go without a red spotlight! Titles are listed in the order of personal preference.\n\nAnd now, on with the show...\n\nVW'S BEST OF FANTASTIC & CULT CINEMA ON BLU-RAY 2020:\n\nTHE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Warner Archive), BRIDES OF DRACULA, CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL (Scream Factory), FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN (as FRANKENSTEIN SCHUF EIN WEIB, Anolis Entertainment GER)\n\nThese six releases offer much more than definitive presentations of the films themselves; they encompass the yeoman efforts of Constantin Nasr and Steve Haberman, whose audio commentaries and documentary shorts boast some of the finest scholarship and critical observation ever brought to bear on the collected work of a single director: in this case, Terence Fisher. Additional invaluable content from Richard Klemensen (whose BRIDES OF DRACULA profile of Fisher ranks high among the best BD bonus items of the year) and musicologist David Huckvale. Warner's CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is not only the year's best and most fulfilling restorations, but it is offered in three different ratios - 1.85, 1.66, and 1.37:1. I think the open matte presentation may be my favorite.\n\nUNIVERSAL HORROR COLLECTION, VOLUME 4, VOLUME 5 and VOLUME 6 (Scream Factory)\n\nConstantine Nasr was also the man responsible for organizing the extras for these sets of, shall we say, second-league Universal (and Paramount) horror titles from the 1930s and '40s. The films themselves look better than ever, but once again the real point of appeal is the research conveyed in documentaries and commentaries by the leading scholars in this niche: Tom Weaver, Greg Mank, Gary D. Rhodes, Kim Newman and Stephen Jones, Bruce G. Hallenbeck, and Scott Gallinghouse. It never quite hits the heights of the Karloff/Lugosi analyses contributed to the first two volumes, but these demand to be part of any serious collection.\n\nTHE WAR OF THE WORLDS (Criterion, also Via Vision Entertainment AU)\n\nAs far as single title releases are concerned, nothing beats this 4K restoration of Byron Haskin's 1953 science fiction classic for producer George Pal. It looks stunning, it sounds stunning. Pure adrenaline for the eyes and ears, and the extras are superb.\n\nROBOCOP: DIRECTOR'S CUT (Arrow Video)\n\nArguably the last great science fiction film of the 20th Century dusted off with a staggering 4K restoration of the unrated director's cut with a choice of three soundtrack options: 2.0 stereo, 4.0 surround, and 5.1 room-ripping mayhem. The 4.0 is the way to go. Three audio commentaries, one the vintage Paul Verhoeven track and the other two brand new, including one by noted historian Paul M. Sammon. And that is just the tip of the iceberg - basically every other supplement you could possibly want is here, and it can be yours for well under $25.\n\nTHREE EDGAR ALLAN POE ADAPTATIONS STARRING BELA LUGOSI: MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, THE BLACK CAT, and THE RAVEN (Eureka UK)\n\nThe aforementioned \"Karloff/Lugosi analyses\" from the likes of Tom Weaver, Greg Mank, Gary D. Rhodes, and Ted Newsom, which originally appeared on the first two Scream Factory UNIVERSAL HORROR COLLECTION sets, are ported into this belated British release, which benefits from its more specific focus on Lugosi. The set also includes an Easter Egg that leads to a re-edit of MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, following the suggestions first laid out by Yours Truly in VIDEO WATCHDOG #111, and subsequently modified by Gary Prange. I did it all in my head, so it was also revelatory to me to actually see the results put into action; the film really is made better by the adjustments we proposed. I may be biased, but this is my choice for Best Blu-ray extra of the year.\n\nSHINING SEX, BAHIA BLANCA, CRIES OF PLEASURE, NIGHT OF OPEN SEX (Severin Films)\n\nThe first of these four Jess Franco titles is one of his rare science-fiction outings, made the same year as Nicolas Roeg's THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, which not only suggests a distaff version of that story, but a mutation offspring of his own earlier THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z and SUCCUBUS, which would subsequently mutate again into the presently lost/unfinished AIDS: THE PLAGUE OF THE 20TH CENTURY. The other three titles are valuable retrievals from his 1980s output and a particular pleasure to see made available in English and quality presentations. CRIES OF PLEASURE is a return to de Sade territory told in lengthy sustained takes (à la ROPE), NIGHT OF OPEN SEX is a bastard entry in his Al Pereira series (with Antonio Mayans as \"Al Crosby\"), and BAHIA BLANCA (strictly limited to 600 copies and now SOLD OUT, so try eBay if you have the money) is a remarkable, even sui generis, achievement that infuses a haunting human drama with \"Bride Wore Black\" imagery decades before Tarantino's KILL BILL. David Gregory's short films following author Stephen Thrower on location visits to Franco's past locations are not only splendidly sentimental and informative, but really drive home the fact that Franco's gift for scouting locations worked miracles of production value.\n\nTHE OUTER LIMITS - THE COMPLETE SERIES (ViaVision Entertainment, AU)\n\nFor the OUTER LIMITS completist, this box set of the entire classic 1963-64 series contains everything found in the two Kino Lorber sets as well as three additional audio commentaries (David J. Schow on \"The Architects of Fear\", Craig Beam on \"The Man Who Was Never Born\", and yours truly on \"The Hundred Days of the Dragon\"), a new video essay by Mr. Schow on newly discovered revelations from a recently unearthed early teleplay of \"The Forms of Things Unknown\", and more.\n\nHAMMER: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION (Mill Creek)\n\nTwenty films on ten discs, including the must-have Constantine Nasr/Steve Haberman commentary for Terence Fisher's THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN, which, alas, does not make use of the 4K restoration released in the UK as part of Indicator's HAMMER VOLUME 4 collection. In fact, though no one is saying this set isn't quite a bargain, Mill Creek was unfortunately obliged to work with Columbia's existing masters of the US versions of some of these titles, which means that STOP BEFORE I KILL! is missing an important shower scene involving nudity by Diane Cilento and CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT (making its home video debut) is the PG cut. The disc also hosts what I believe is the US Blu-ray debut of William Castle's THE OLD DARK HOUSE, originally shipped out to US theaters in black-and-white prints, but preserved here in its original striking color palette, which restores a good deal of its Hammer ambience. In addition to the aforementioned commentary, we also get Nasr on NEVER TAKE SWEETS FROM A STRANGER, Haberman on SCREAM OF FEAR, Phoef Sutton/C. Courtney Joyner/Mark Jordan Began sharing a track on the underrated THE SNORKEL, Joshua Kennedy on THE GORGON, and THE OLD DARK HOUSE is defended by the members of the Monster Party Podcast. There are also some featurettes and retrospectives, which I've not yet looked into but am told are all original to this set. Whether or not you already own the Indicator sets devoted to this same crop of films, there is enough exclusive and valuable material here to make it an essential purchase, especially if you can find it for less than retail.\n\nDAWN OF THE DEAD: LIMITED EDITION (1978, Second Sight UK)\n\nThis one just came in the door, but it strikes me as a masterpiece of organization and presentation. Inside the box are three versions of the Romero classic (theatrical, extended Cannes cut, Argento ZOMBI cut), three soundtrack CDs (Goblin soundtrack, plus two discs devoted to DeWolf Library tracks sampled in the film), a 160-page hardcover book of new essays, and a new printing of the Romero/Sparrow novelization. I have issues with the actual 4K restoration of the theatrical cut, which has a jacked-up brightness and clarity that simply were not part of the film's theatrical experience, but it carries DP Michael Gornick's endorsement. I'm not saying it looks bad, just that it works on the viewer differently.\n\nMYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (Warner Archive)\n\nOne of the great pre-code horror classics of the 1930s, with its original two-strip Technicolor photography restored to its original richness and lustre. With two fine new audio commentaries by Scott McQueen and Alan K. Rode, a Fay Wray documentary featurette, and a closer look at the film's restoration.\n\nKISS OF THE VAMPIRE (Scream Factory)\n\nAnother outstanding Hammer disc from Scream Factory, albeit this time the work of director Don Sharp. Separate commentaries by Nasr and Haberman, plus Troy Howarth and Nathaniel Thompson, plus still another archive commentary with some of the film's surviving stars. The NBC-TV version KISS OF EVIL is also included.\n\nTHE THIRD LOVER and THE CHAMPAGNE MURDERS (Kino Lorber)\n\nUnfairly overlooked in this crazy year of releases were these two fantastic thrillers from Claude Chabrol's fascinating if highly erratic first decade. THE THIRD LOVER, from 1962, is a story of how a young journalist moves to a small town to finagle an interview with a famous writer who, with his wife, is one of its reclusive locals. He not only ingratiates himself into their friendship, but the more deeply he becomes involved with the wife (Stéphane Audran), the more he becomes committed to destroying their marriage and filling the void he anticipates will follow the writer's untimely demise. I really set out to learn more of Chabrol's work only this year, and THE THIRD LOVER is one of his best. THE CHAMPAGNE MURDERS is preserved on Kino's disc only in its English version, which is good for preserving Anthony Perkins' performance, though a reportedly different French version also exists. This movie plays a trick on the viewer that caught me absolutely off-guard, and it haunted me for days. Kino Lorber also released Chabrol's political thriller LINE OF DEMARCATION this year - outside the scope of this survey, but well worth seeing.\n\nWARNING FROM SPACE (Arrow Video)\n\nIn the Western consciousness, Japanese fantasy generally conjures up thoughts of giant monsters crushing Tokyo, but this disc preserves (and beautifully restores) the first color science fiction film make in Japan - directed by Koji Shima for Daiei Studios. The film has only ever been seen in English in a distorted recut distributed by AIP-TV, and that version is presented here looking better than it ever did on television, but the real eureka is the Japanese version, presented with optional English subtitles. Remarkably, the picture (scripted by Hideo Oguni, author of Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI!) has no real protagonist, its ever-moving eye focusing instead on the varied breadth of humanity as it responds to an ultimately well-meaning alien presence on Earth.\n\nTHE COMPLETE LENZI/BAKER GIALLO COLLECTION (Severin Films)\n\nThis comprehensive package of the four giallo films made in the late '60s and early '70s by Italian director Umberto Lenzi and starring his muse, the American actress Carroll Baker, is another impeccably illustrated study not just of its particulars but the larger arc of giallo cinema, which these films represent in the years between Mario Bava and Dario Argento's mastery. All four of the films, not previously available in very good presentations, are given revelatory presentations and audio commentaries by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, Kat Ellinger, Samm Deighan, and Troy Howarth and Nathaniel Thompson intensify their yield as sociology as well as entertainment. La Baker is conspicuous in her absence, but there are archival interviews with Lenzi, new interviews with screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi and author Stephen Thrower, as well as soundtracks for three of the four titles.\n\nTHE FU MANCHU CYCLE 1965-69 (Indicator)\n\nEach of the five films in this comprehensive collection (THE FACE OF FU MANCHU, THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU, THE VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU, THE BLOOD OF FU MANCHU, and THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU) has been impressively revitalized for this release - they look better, sound better, and they are as complete, as well organized and chronicled as they can possibly be. In some ways, this is a party for a series that never quite fulfilled its promise, and the party is the reason to get it. The festive analysis provided explains in meticulous detail why the films went downhill so quickly, and rather than seeing a sad decline over time, our eyes are keened to a greater appreciation of what was managed, and also of the inspired diversity of directorial approaches taken to the material at hand. A fun education.\n\nTHE PUPPETOON MOVIE VOLUME 2 (Puppetoon Productions)\n\nArnold Leibovit's long-awaited follow-up to 2013's Blu-Ray of THE PUPPETOON MOVIE contains another 18 fully restored HD presentations of George Pal's stop-motion animation gems from 1934-46 and additional programming in standard definition, including looks at Pal's commercial work for Shell Oil Company and Alka-Seltzer. Fascinating to watch, and at least as fascinating to step-through, frame by frame.\n\nFORBIDDEN FRUIT: THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE EXPLOITATION PICTURE (Kino Lorber, eight volumes to date)\n\nIn this age of 4K restorations and comprehensive box sets, it's easy to overlook this growing set of collaborations between Kino Lorber, Something Weird Video, and other providers, which sheds new light on various forms of exploitation during the early years of the sound era. Starting with William Beaudine's notorious 1945 \"birth of a baby\" movie MOM & DAD (with audio commentary by Eric Schafer, author of BOLD! DARING! SHOCKING! TRUE! A HISTORY OF EXPLOITATION FILMS 1919-59, and a John Ford-directed sex hygiene short among its supporting content), continuing with various fantasias of nudism (UNASHAMED: A ROMANCE) and tragedies concerning unwanted pregnancies (CHILD BRIDE) and marijuana addiction (SHE SHOULDA SAID NO!), and most recently culminating in the first-ever home video release of the legendarily long-lost INGAGI (a faux documentary about virgin sacrifices to gorillas in jungle cultures), these films are loaded with surprises (including appearances by Lyle Talbot, Jack Elam, and other familiar faces). Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, Bret Wood, and the late David F. Friedman are among the knowledgeable commentators.\n\nAMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON: COLLECTOR'S EDITION (Kino Lorber)\n\nJohn Landis produced this collection of comedy sketches - featuring bits by himself, Robert K. Weiss, and a wealth of terrific material from Joe Dante - and I find it one of the most enduring things he's ever done. Much in the same vein as his earlier THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, this potpourri has an emphatic focus on televised entertainment and the impact of technology on human relationships and interactions. Dante's contributions in particular have an often barbed edge to their confrontational comedy and, as I especially felt when seeing this film theatrically, delight in making the audience uncomfortable. As time has gone on, it's only grown better, with everyone exploring stylistic templates that range from 1930s James Whale horror and Dwain Esper sex education trash to 1950s Technicolor pirate and science fiction pictures, to the perky TV trends of its own time. This disc is the best way to see the film, as it includes a wealth of deleted material (originally described way back in VIDEO WATCHDOG #2) that for some reason didn't pass muster, though it certainly appealed to me!\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nTHE ELEPHANT MAN (Criterion)\n\nAL ADAMSON: THE MASTERPIECE COLLECTION (Severin Films)\n\nCRASH (Criterion)\n\nTHREE FANTASTIC JOURNEYS BY KAREL ZEMAN (Criterion)\n\nTEOREMA (Criterion)\n\nTHE FLESH AND THE FIENDS (Kino Lorber)\n\nLET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH (Scream Factory)\n\nULTRAMAN ACE, NEO ULTRA Q, ULTRAMAN R/B: THE SERIES/THE MOVIE, ULTRAMAN ORB: THE ORIGIN SAGA (Mill Creek Entertainment)\n\nTHE CREMATOR (Criterion)\n\nOUTSIDE THE LAW, DRIFTING and WHITE TIGER (Kino Lorber)\n\nTEX AVERY'S SCREWBALL CLASSICS VOLUME 2 (Warner Archive)\n\nTHE NIGHT MY NUMBER CAME UP (Kino Lorber)\n\nTHE YEAR'S BEST RESTORATIONS:\n\nTHE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Warner Archive)\n\nTHE WAR OF THE WORLDS (Criterion, ViaVision Entertainment AU)\n\nINGAGI (Kino Lorber)\n\nULYSSES (Kino Lorber)\n\nMYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (Warner Archive)\n\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH (Scream Factory)\n\nTHE GOLEM (Kino Lorber)\n\nWARNING FROM SPACE (Arrow Video)\n\nTRAIL OF THE SCREAMING FOREHEAD - DIRECTOR'S CUT (Hydraulic Entertainment)\n\nINNER SANCTUM MYSTERIES (Mill Creek Entertainment)\n\nPLAY MISTY FOR ME (Kino Lorber)\n\nTHE FU MANCHU CYCLE 1965-69 (Indicator)\n\nTHE WONDERS OF ALADDIN (Kino Lorber)\n\nORGASMO (in THE COMPLETE LENZI/BAKER GIALLO COLLECTION, Severin Films)\n\nWHEN WORLDS COLLIDE (ViaVision Entertainment AU)\n\nTHE THIEF OF BAGHDAD (as DER GAUNER VON BAGHDAD, Colosseo Film GER)\n\n20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA (Kino Lorber)\n\nLET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH (Scream Factory)\n\nCURSE OF THE UNDEAD (Kino Lorber)\n\nSUPERNATURAL (Kino Lorber)\n\nAnd finally...\n\nHaving generally left my own contributions outside the discussion, I will close with this complete list of the new work I generated this past year, in the order I recorded them, for those who want to know.\n\nTIM LUCAS BLU-RAY AUDIO COMMENTARIES OF 2020:\n\nTHE FLESH AND THE FIENDS (Kino Lorber)\n\nTHE GOLEM (with bonus short commentary; 1920, Kino Lorber)\n\nTHE OUTER LIMITS - THE COMPLETE SERIES (“The Hundred Days of the Dragon,” ViaVision, AU only)\n\nCANNIBAL APOCALYPSE (Kino Lorber)\n\nBRIGHTON ROCK (1948, Kino Lorber)\n\nSUPERNATURAL (1933, Kino Lorber)\n\nSECRET CEREMONY (Kino Lorber)\n\nNEUROSIS (Redemption/Kino Lorber)\n\nTHE BALCONY (Kino Lorber)\n\nULYSSES(1954, Kino Lorber)\n\nTHE CHALK GARDEN (Kino Lorber)\n\nDANGER: DIABOLIK (ViaVision, AU only)\n\nTHE WONDERS OF ALADDIN (Kino Lorber)\n\nPLAY MISTY FOR ME (Kino Lorber)\n\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS!\n\n(c) 2020 by Tim Lucas.

It is hard for me to imagine a more generous film in terms of its seemingly inexhaustible supply of stylistic facets and practical ideas. It is also true that sometimes a good film can teach us something worth knowing about another director's work; for example, it's unlikely that critics would have ever contrasted the works of Terence Fisher, for example, with those of Frank Borzage had Fisher not singled out this other director for his highest praise in a CINEFANTASTIQUE interview conducted by Harry Ringel back in 1973. And so it was to my own great surprise that I recently discovered such a connection - one that struck me as so obvious, I started acting like Paul McCartney when he had dreamed the song \"Yesterday\" and went around playing it for all his friends, unable to believe that no one had ever written it before.\n\nAs my interest in further exploring Claude Chabrol's work has continued, I recently had the opportunity to screen his first feature LE BEAU SERGE (1958), which is available from Criterion in a splendid Blu-ray edition. I was under the mistaken impression that I had seen it once before, as I had seen his second film LES COUSINS (1959) when Criterion first released the two films in tandem back in 2011; I loved LES COUSINS and had every intention of watching the earlier film but something apparently diverted my attention from it. My copy was still in its original shrink-wrap! Anyway, I was most impressed by LE BEAU SERGE, which is the story of a successful young author (Jean-Pierre Brialy) who returns to his hometown, a restful little village, to recover from tuberculosis. There, he discovers a fondly remembered old friend, Serge (Gérard Blain), who has become an alcoholic, trapped in an unhappy marriage with a young wife expecting a child - the second after the first was lost in childbirth and found to have had Down's Syndrome. Hating his life and circumstances, as well as the wife he knows he loves, and dreading that his new child will also be tainted with what was then called \"mongolism,\" the film builds to the child's healthy birth and the final image of its lead character laughing with joy. As he continues laughing, cameraman Henri Decaë diffuses focus until the handsome Serge's face becomes a blurred mess from which the likeness of a skull emerges. Sitting alone in my living room at 3:00am, I couldn't hold back a \"Whoa!\" at this bold revelation.\n\nThough the two films tell very different stories, both LE BEAU SERGE and PSYCHO end with the same basic image and frisson:\n\nNot only was the connection immediately obvious to me, but so was the most likely reason Hitchcock would have knowingly quoted it. In 1957, before either man became a director in his own right, Claude Chabrol and Éric Rohmer had collaborated on the first book ever written about Alfred Hitchcock and his films, a critical overview of his first forty-four films entitled simply ALFRED HITCHCOCK in French and ALFRED HITCHCOCK: THE FIRST FORTY-FOUR FILMS in English translation.\n\nPeter Bogdanovich's signed copy, which recently sold to a lucky collector for $2,500.\n\nChabrol was the first of the French Nouvelle Vague directors to make his own film, his first wife having inherited a good deal of money that the couple put toward the production of LE BEAU SERGE, saving him the trouble of having to find a sympathetic producer as his fellows had to do. NORTH BY NORTHWEST, Hitchcock's film of 1958, would have been made before Hitchcock read the book, which means that PSYCHO would have been the first Hitchcock film to have been made by a newly critically-explained, self-conscious Hitchcock. It makes sense that he would have expressed his gratitude for their close reading of his work by showing equal attention to theirs - by acknowledging this moment from Chabrol's maiden effort in his own with a characteristic wink.\n\nOf course, it is also possible that Hitchcock was concerned about whether or not this quotation might be too direct, as different prints of PSYCHO have turned up over the years without its chilling subliminal double exposure at the end. Just as it is also possible that the idea may have occurred to him without being fully aware of what had inspired it. Indeed, I'm assuming in saying all of this that the nearly subliminal PSYCHO double exposure was not originated in Joseph Stefano's screenplay adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel because stylistic touches such as this are traditionally the province of the director.\n\nAs LE BEAU SERGE reaches its conclusion, its title character finally becomes a father, a role he has tried to forget as someone like the living dead throughout the bulk of the film the duration of the film. The meaning of its closing shot is probably arguable, but I believe it shows the dawning of real parental terror at the moment of a child's birth, that first intimation of one's own life as being no more than a small and tentative link in a very long chain. Serge is no longer self-absorbed; he has become \"all father,\" much as Norman Bates in his cell has become \"all Mother.\"\n\nAnyway, I checked Claude Chabrol authority Guy Austin's LE BEAU SERGE audio commentary for further information; he acknowledged that the blurring of Serge briefly resembles a skull, but draws no comparison to the film that replayed this idea for greater chills in its closing moments. I also asked some Facebook friends (including fellow critic Adrian Martin) if they knew of anyone who had explored this connection before, and to the best of their pooled knowledge, it seemed to be a fresh observation.\n\nAnd so, to mark the moment and my eureka, I am sharing it now with you.\n\n(c) 2020 by Tim Lucas.
