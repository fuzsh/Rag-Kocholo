        "text": "Clark Gable 1901–1960\n\nJoan Crawford c. 1904–1977\n\nWith his roughneck charm and good looks, Clark Gable reigned as the “King of Hollywood” throughout the 1930s. Signed to a long-term contract by MGM, Gable was initially relegated to “tough guy” roles. He broke free from this typecasting in 1934, playing opposite Claudette Colbert in the delightful comedy It Happened One Night. For his engaging performance as a down-on-his luck newspaper man who aids a runaway heiress, Gable took home the Oscar for Best Actor. By the time he appeared as the roguish Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind (1939), Gable was MGM’s most popular leading man. In films that audiences flocked to see, he was teamed with the studio’s top female stars, including Jean Harlow, Myra Loy, and Joan Crawford.\n\nGable and Crawford appeared together in eight films between 1931 and 1940. Hurrell created this double portrait to promote their 1936 romantic comedy, Love on the Run.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1936\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nView the individual portrait of Joan Crawford for information about her career.\n\nLoretta Young 1913–2000\n\nFrom an early age Loretta Young set her sights on becoming a movie star. She made her film debut as a toddler. When she was eight, Young appeared with Rudolph Valentino in the silent film classic, The Sheik (1921). Although she was originally credited under her birth name, Gretchen Young, studio executives changed it to the more lilting “Loretta” in 1927. Advancing to adult roles while in her teens, she performed in a series of silent films before transitioning smoothly to talking pictures.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Young appeared opposite popular male stars including James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, and Clark Gable. Yet she was largely unhappy with roles offered to her while under contract to Twentieth Century Fox. She left the studio in 1940 and continued her career as a freelancer. This bold move was rewarded in 1947, when Young claimed the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in The Farmer’s Daughter.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1937\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nBill “Bojangles” Robinson 1878–1949\n\nCombining superb showmanship with a winning personality, tap dancing virtuoso Bill “Bojangles” Robinson was a hit with audiences for more than half a century. It was on the vaudeville circuit and as a popular nightclub performer that Robinson earned his reputation as “King of the Tap Dancers.” After performing on Broadway in the all-Black revue Blackbirds of 1928, he made his way to Hollywood, where he appeared in fourteen films between 1930 and 1943.\n\nDue to entrenched racism in Hollywood and American society at large, Robinson’s only starring roles were in Harlem is Heaven (1932) and Stormy Weather (1943), which featured all-Black casts. In other films, Robinson portrayed stereotypical characters, such as the faithful servant in the Little Colonel (1935), starring Shirley Temple. Robinson’s signature “stair dance” tap routine with Temple provided the movie’s most memorable moment. Yet when screened in the South, that interracial sequence was cut from the film.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1935\n\nPublished in Vanity Fair, June 1935\n\nRosalind Russell 1907–1976\n\nRosalind Russell was decidedly different from many of the stars of her generation. She did not fit the glamour girl mold, and during her early years in Hollywood she was consigned to supporting roles that made scant use of her talents. That changed when she landed the part of the incorrigible gossip Sylvia Fowler in director George Cukor’s 1939 hit, The Women. Russell’s antic performance showcased her flair for comedy and paved the way to her memorable role as the fast-talking newspaperwoman Hildy Johnson in His Girl Friday (1940). Thereafter, she appeared as the supremely competent career woman in more than twenty films.\n\nTo escape such typecasting, Russell relished the Broadway roles that also came her way. In 1953, she won the Tony Award for her performance in Wonderful Town. She claimed a second Tony as Auntie Mame in 1957, reprising that role in the 1958 film.\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1935\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nJimmy Durante 1893–1980\n\nJimmy Durante was just sixteen when he broke into show business by playing ragtime piano in honkytonks from Coney Island to Harlem. He found his true calling as a comedian in the early 1920s, when he joined two other performers to create a comic cabaret act. With the irrepressible Durante taking the lead, the madcap trio quickly progressed to Broadway. By 1927, they were playing to capacity crowds at vaudeville’s top venue, New York City’s Palace Theatre.\n\nSingled out by critics for his show-stealing antics in Florenz Ziegfeld’s musical Show Girl (1929), Durante launched his career as a solo performer by signing a five-year contract with MGM in 1931. He made twenty-nine films and often returned to Broadway, but it was on radio and television that he achieved his greatest success. There, his self-effacing humor, mangled syntax, and hoarse-voiced renditions of songs like “Inka Dinka Doo” endeared him to millions.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1931\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nMarlene Dietrich 1901–1992\n\nWith her world-weary sophistication, smoky voice, and icy allure, Marlene Dietrich brought a highly provocative glamour to the silver screen. The rapturous response to Morocco and The Blue Angel— the melodramas that introduced her to American audiences in 1930—marked Dietrich for stardom. She honed her magnetic public persona in each of the six films made with director and mentor Josef von Sternberg, exerting a commanding presence even in the weakest vehicle.\n\nDietrich began bringing a full-length mirror to her filmsets with von Sternberg to monitor both the lighting and her appearance on camera. She continued this practice during her portrait sittings with George Hurrell. By placing her mirror as closely as possible to Hurrell’s camera, she was able to position herself before the shutter clicked. Recalling that he had little agency during their sessions, Hurrell observed, “Those sultry, sexy poses were mostly her creation.”\n\nGelatin silver print, 1937\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nIrene Dunne 1898–1990\n\nFew performers could match the versatility of actor Irene Dunne. In a career that included more than forty films, she moved effortlessly from tear-stained melodramas to madcap comedies. A classically trained soprano, Dunne failed in her quest to join New York City’s Metropolitan Opera in 1920. Instead, she found steady work on the Broadway stage before winning the part of Magnolia in the touring company of the musical Show Boat (1929). Her success in that production led to a contract with RKO Pictures and starring roles in a string of romantic tearjerkers.\n\nDunne returned to musicals with featured roles in the film versions of Roberta (1935) and Show Boat (1936), before venturing into screwball comedy with her sparkling, Oscar-nominated performances in Theodora Goes Wild (1936) and The Awful Truth (1937). Also nominated for Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948), Dunne never received an Oscar but remained a Hollywood favorite.\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1935\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nSpencer Tracy 1900–1967\n\nAn actor with remarkable range, Spencer Tracy brought believability to each character he portrayed on screen. During a career notable for its longevity, he played everything from gangsters to priests. Best remembered by many for his nine films with Katharine Hepburn, including the comedies Adam’s Rib (1949) and Pat and Mike (1952), Tracy also shone in numerous dramatic roles. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, he cemented his standing as a bona fide Hollywood star by earning consecutive Best Actor Oscars for his performances in the dramas Captains Courageous (1937) and Boys Town (1938).\n\nRecalling his portrait sessions with Tracy, Hurrell observed that the often-impatient actor “disliked taking the time to be photographed for still shots. But once he settled into posing, I always thought he rather enjoyed the experience.” This portrait was created to publicize Libeled Lady, the 1936 comedy starring Tracy, Jean Harlow, Myrna Loy, and William Powell.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1936\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nMyrna Loy 1905–1993\n\nFor Myrna Loy, the breakthrough to stardom was slow in coming. Between 1925 and 1933, she appeared in more than sixty films, most often portraying femme fatales. That changed in 1934 when she was cast as the love interest of Clark Gable and William Powell in the box office hit Manhattan Melodrama. Loy’s performance caught the eye of MGM director Woodbridge Strong Van Dyke, who tapped her to costar with William Powell in the fast-paced murder mystery The Thin Man (1934). The Powell/Loy pairing as husband-and-wife crime solvers Nick and Nora Charles proved so successful that they were reunited in eleven more productions, including five Thin Man sequels.\n\nThough Loy chaffed at being typecast as “the perfect wife” in nearly two dozen films, her portrayal of the spouse of a struggling World War II veteran in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) was notable for its warmth and sensitivity.\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1936\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nClaudette Colbert 1903–1996\n\nThe star of more than sixty films, Claudette Colbert is most famous today for a film she had little interest in making. Brought to Hollywood by Paramount Pictures in 1932, she first turned heads as the wicked wife of Emperor Nero in Cecil B. DeMille’s lavish costume drama The Sign of the Cross (1932).\n\nAfter appearing in seven more productions at Paramount, Colbert was temporarily “loaned” to Columbia Pictures for a low-budget film with Frank Capra, a director she heartily disliked. Her reluctant costar was Clark Gable, whose “loan” to Columbia by MGM was seen as punishment for demanding higher pay. During four weeks of filming, Colbert and Gable delivered brilliant comedic performances that made It Happened One Night the surprise hit of 1934 and earned each of them an Oscar. Colbert subsequently won praise for her work in the dramas Private Worlds (1935) and Since You Went Away (1944).\n\nGelatin silver print, 1938\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nWilliam Powell 1892–1984\n\nOne of Hollywood’s most popular leading men throughout the 1930s and 40s, William Powell was the picture of suave sophistication with his trim moustache and debonaire demeanor. During the silent era, he was repeatedly confined to roles as a villain or cad. That changed with the introduction of sound pictures in 1927, when his resonant speaking voice became a powerful asset. With a distinct flair for comedy, Powell shone opposite leading ladies such as Jean Harlow and Carole Lombard. But it was his performance in the six Thin Man murder mystery romps that solidified his position as a top box office draw. Paired with Myrna Loy, who played his chic and spirited wife Nora, Powell was a delight as the charming, martini-fueled sleuth Nick Charles.\n\nTogether, Powell and Loy displayed an on-screen chemistry that perfectly matched the lively characters originally created by detective novelist and short story writer Dashiell Hammett.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1936\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nJames Wong Howe 1899–1976\n\nDuring a career that spanned five decades and included more than 120 films, James Wong Howe earned universal recognition as one of the movie industry’s most inventive and influential cinematographers. Born Wong Tung Jim in China, he came to the United States as a child in 1904. He could not, however, become a naturalized U.S. citizen until after the 1943 repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nHowe began his Hollywood career in 1917 as a low-level assistant to director Cecil B. DeMille’s top cameraman. After making his first feature film in 1922, he advanced rapidly, thanks to his creative camerawork and technical innovations. Howe’s skillful use of low light and dramatic shadows were essential components of his cinematic style in films such as MGM’s The Thin Man (1934) and Warner Bros.’s King’s Row (1942). Nominated for ten Academy Awards, he claimed the Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1956 and 1964.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1942\n\nDorothy Lamour 1914–1996\n\nDorothy Lamour had never set foot on a South Sea Island. That did not stop Paramount Pictures from wrapping her in a sarong for the title role in her first film Jungle Princess (1936). What Lamour later described as “that little scrap of cloth”—created by famed costume designer Edith Head—became her de facto uniform in five more films, including The Hurricane (1937) and Her Jungle Love (1938). The studio’s publicity department had no qualms about exploiting the actor’s physical appeal in ads pledging to reveal “as much of Lamour as the censors will permit—with or without the sarong.”\n\nLamour is remembered by many for her recurring role as the love interest in a series of antic comedies starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Known collectively as the “Road” pictures, they included The Road to Singapore (1940) and The Road to Morocco (1942) and were perennial hits with moviegoers.\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1937\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nGilbert Adrian 1903–1959\n\nAs MGM’s principal costume designer from 1928 to 1941, Gilbert Adrian (born Adrian Adolf Greenberg) brought high fashion glamour to the silver screen while influencing off-screen style trends as well. In his work for more than two hundred films, Adrian mastered the art of designing for the camera. Whether creating sensuous gowns or crisply tailored suits, he ensured that his designs would flatter the wearer and heighten their star power. He is credited with transforming Greta Garbo into “a goddess of glamour” while also creating signature looks such as Joan Crawford’s padded shoulders and Jean Harlow’s figure hugging, bias-cut satins. When the screen credits proclaimed “Gowns by Adrian,” audiences knew to expect the latest in eye-catching designs.\n\nAdrian is best remembered today for creating the costumes for The Wizard of Oz (1939)—from Dorothy’s iconic ruby slippers to the outfits worn by every other character in that memorable film.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1936\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nJoan Crawford c. 1904–1977\n\nDestined to become one of the screen’s most enduring stars, Joan Crawford was dancing in the chorus of a Broadway revue when an MGM talent scout discovered her in 1924. Born Lucille LeSueur, she became “Joan Crawford” thanks to a renaming contest orchestrated by studio head Louis B. Mayer as part of a publicity campaign. After appearing in a number of minor silent films, Crawford soared to stardom in 1928 with her tabletop performance of an exuberant Charleston in Our Dancing Daughters. She successfully navigated the changeover to talking pictures and starred throughout the 1930s with many of Hollywood’s top leading men, including Clark Gable.\n\nHurrell regarded Crawford as “the most photogenic of the Hollywood group of actresses.” “When I caught my first glimpse of her in the lens,” he recalled, “I felt an emotional tug of excitement. . . . Her large wide eyes and strongly molded features were perfect in the camera.”\n\nGelatin silver print, 1936\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nMerle Oberon 1911–1979\n\nMerle Oberon’s role as Anne Boleyn in the British film The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) thrust her into the spotlight. Although her appearance onscreen was brief, a fabricated biography was concocted to conceal her bi-racial origins (her father was white, and her mother was of South Asian heritage). This deception, which identified her parents as British and her birthplace as Tasmania, Australia, allowed Oberon to pass as white at a time when any hint of mixed-race parentage would have derailed her acting career. Claiming that her birth certificate had been lost in a fire, Oberon maintained this identity for the remainder of her life.\n\nAfter her leading role in another British production, The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), Oberon was brought to Hollywood in 1935 by MGM mogul Samuel Goldwyn. It was her performance as Cathy opposite Laurence Olivier’s Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights (1939) that cemented her stardom.\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1935\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nGypsy Rose Lee 1911–1970\n\nAs young children, Gypsy Rose Lee (born Rose Louise Hovick) and her sister were ushered onto stage by their ambitious mother. By the time she was seventeen, Lee was a celebrated strip tease artist. The wit and sophistication of her act set her apart from other burlesque performers, and her distaste for nudity meant she never revealed all.\n\nBelieving Lee could be filmdom’s next sex symbol, producer Darryl Zanuck brought her to Hollywood in 1937. Aware that her identity as a famed strip tease artist would not pass muster with Hollywood censors, she was credited as “Louise Hovick” in her first five films. It was not until her performance in Stage Door Canteen (1943) that she was billed as Gypsy Rose Lee.\n\nThough Lee’s movie career was fairly short-lived, Hurrell noted that she had “a bold, strong, natural kind of beauty” and “could turn on the dramatics at the drop of a handkerchief.”\n\nGelatin silver print, 1937\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nDouglas Fairbanks Jr. 1909–2000\n\nIn choosing to pursue a movie career, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. inevitably risked comparison with his father, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., the famous silent screen actor. Although he never achieved the level of stardom enjoyed by his swashbuckling namesake, the younger Fairbanks was an agreeable presence in a number of largely forgettable films from the 1920s to the 1940s.\n\nAfter an inauspicious screen debut at age seventeen, he initially found his footing when partnered with Joan Crawford (to whom he was married from 1929 to 1934) in several low-budget productions aimed at youthful audiences. Fairbanks’s talents were best showcased in his performances as a World War I pilot in Dawn Patrol (1930); a sword-wielding villain in The Prisoner of Zenda (1937); and a dashing British soldier in Gunga Din (1939). Arguably, his most important roles were performed off screen with his service as a decorated naval officer during World War II.\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1933\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nJean Harlow 1911–1937\n\nHollywood’s original “Blonde Bombshell,” Jean Harlow personified freewheeling sexuality in the movies that made her a star. Debuting in minor roles, she caught the attention of producer/director Howard Hughes, who cast her in his World War I epic Hell’s Angels (1930). Acquiring Harlow’s contract in 1932, MGM capitalized on her sex appeal and flair for comedy in hits like Red Headed Woman (1932) and Bombshell (1933). But after changes to the Production Code in 1934 led to increased censorship of sexual content, the studio was obliged to tone down Harlow’s screen persona.\n\nWhen Vanity Fair published this portrait in 1935, it noted that Harlow had “astounded her public by developing from the platinum blonde siren of Hell’s Angels into an expert comedienne who, in Red Dust and Dinner at Eight, became simultaneously a box office sensation and the critics’ delight.” Sadly, Harlow died two years later at the age of twenty-six.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1934\n\nPublished in Vanity Fair, January 1935\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nJohnny Weissmuller 1904–1984\n\nJohnny Weissmuller was not the first to embody Tarzan on the big screen. Yet it was his portrayal in twelve films from 1932 to 1948 that established him as the quintessential “King of the Jungle” for a generation of moviegoers.\n\nWeissmuller first gained fame as an international swimming sensation. Undefeated during eight years of competition, he won 52 national championships, set 67 world records, and earned gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics. Thereafter, he performed in water shows and promoted a line of swimwear before drawing the attention of Cyril Hume, the scriptwriter tasked with developing a Tarzan screenplay for MGM. Encountering Weissmuller at the Hollywood Athletic Club’s swimming pool, Hume was struck by the swimmer’s natural grace and athletic physique. He arranged a screen test, and despite Weissmuller’s limited acting ability, he became MGM’s Tarzan. Hurrell photographed Weissmuller to promote the film Tarzan Escapes, released in 1936.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1935\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor\n\nJohn Barrymore 1882–1942\n\nA member of one of America’s most storied theatrical families, John Barrymore won critical and popular acclaim as a star of both stage and screen. The charismatic and mercurial actor made his Broadway debut in 1903. For more than a decade, he appeared mostly in comedic roles before turning to serious drama. In 1913, he signed his first film contract and developed an enthusiastic following with his performances in silent classics such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920).\n\nToggling between stage and screen, Barrymore scored a triumph on Broadway with his moving portrayal of Hamlet (1922) before inking a multi-film deal with Warner Bros. His popularity continued unabated with the advent of talking pictures. In 1932, he moved to MGM where his films included the star-studded Grand Hotel (1932), costarring Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford, and Dinner at Eight (1933), featuring his brother Lionel Barrymore and Jean Harlow.\n\nGelatin silver print, 1932\n\nAcquired in part through the generosity of an anonymous donor"
