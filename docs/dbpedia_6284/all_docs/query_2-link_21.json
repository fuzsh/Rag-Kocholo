        "text": "This article consists of an analysis of the film work and career of director Rowland Brown, one of the first (if not the first) director-screenwriters in Hollywood. Brown pursued his career during Hollywood’s pre-Code era, but only directed three idiosyncratic films, all of which were linked to the gangster genre: Quick Millions (1931), Hell’s Highway (1932) and Blood Money (1933). There are many factors which explain why he was ousted from Hollywood and not allowed to direct again, one of which is the highly transgressive and critical nature of the discourse found in his cinema. Despite the uniqueness and originality of his film work, today he is an all but forgotten figure, only acknowledged by a prestigious group of film historians. His cinema has yet to be studied in depth. The ultimate purpose of this article is to contribute towards redressing this omission in the History of Film. KEY WORDS: Rowland Brown–Classical Hollywood cinema–Pre-Code period (1930–1934)¬–Quick Millions (1931)–Hell’s Highway (1932)–Blood Money (1933)–gangster genre\n\nFrom classic films such as \"Casablanca\" to anti-Nazi films, comedy, and film noir, American cinema in the 1930s and 1940s was a tool of political engagement and creative expression. German-speaking directors, actors, writers, and composers who fled Nazi Europe and found refuge in America helped to pioneer this Golden Age of Hollywood. Published to accompany a major traveling exhibition, \"Light & Noir: Exiles and Émigrés in Hollywood, 1933–1950\" explores the contributions of these visionary émigrés during these difficult times, when democratic ideals were fervently debated and defended. \"Light & Noir\" is inspired by the twin genres of comedy and film noir, illuminating both the hopes and challenges of adjusting to a new culture in the midst of a world in upheaval. The catalogue features an essay that connects the exhibition narrative with a broader history of émigrés in Hollywood, followed by highlights from the exhibition and poignant recollections by descendants of these luminaries in American moviemaking.\n\nMartin Halliwell refers to the fifties as a “period of puzzling paradoxes” that is often remembered through a mix of “myths and nostalgia,” however, I would argue that the fifties were consumed by the dialectic of their own myths and the stark reality of a changing world. The hero of 1950s American Western films embodies the hopes and dreams of a culture experiencing existential challenges and social evolution. The heroic character displays the internal complexities that society grapples with as well as exploring social commentary. As a window into the morality of the 1950s culture, the Western is a useful tool that enables examination into the dynamics of society during this formative and mythic time period.\n\nChapter 12 of Recovering 1940s Horror Cinema- Traces of a Lost Decade edited by Mario Degiglio-Bellemare; Charlie Ellbé And Kristopher WoofterThe 1940s is a lost decade in horror cinema, undervalued and written out of most horror scholarship. This collection revises, reframes, and deconstructs persistent critical binaries that have been put in place by scholarly discourse to label 1940s horror as somehow inferior to a “classical” period or “canonical” mode of horror in the 1930s, especially as represented by the monster films of Universal Studios. The book&#39;s four sections re-evaluate the historical, political, economic, and cultural factors informing 1940s horror cinema to introduce new theoretical frameworks and to open up space for scholarly discussion of 1940s horror genre hybridity, periodization, and aesthetics. Chapters focused on Gothic and Grand Guignol traditions operating in forties horror cinema, 1940s proto-slasher films, the independent horrors of the Poverty Row st..."
