        "text": "Digimon was created in 1997 as a series of virtual pet-raising toys similar to Tamagotchi. The toys became a smash hit in Japan and across Asia, eventually leading to an entire Digimon universe. In 1999 the franchise got its first animated series with Digimon Adventure – or Digimon: Digital Monsters for English-speaking countries. Use our guide below to find out where you can watch every Digimon series in order and where they are streaming online!\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters was the first in the franchise and followed a group of kids who are transported into the digital world. Once there, they meet a group of small Digimon in their infant (or “fresh”) form. Together, the group must fight to save the digital world. Luckily, the Digimon can digivolve into bigger, stronger, and cooler monsters to help the kids defeat even the strongest enemies.\n\nThe show was widely popular thanks to the success of Pokémon which set the stage for similar franchises to boom. However, within a year or two, most audiences lost interest in Digimon. But for the fans that did stick around, they discovered Digimon was no Pokémon clone and instead was a much deeper and ultimately more mature story that felt more like a proper anime than a kid’s cartoon.\n\nAfter the Adventure series, fans got Digimon Tamers. The show depicts Digimon being transported into the real world, but luckily a young Digimon fan playing the Digimon card game picks up a mysterious card that turns his card reader into a Digivice. Together with his friends he defends the city. The second incarnation received mixed reviews because of its obvious product-pushing plotline that felt more like an infomercial than a good story.\n\nMore Digimon series were released throughout the 2000s like Frontier and Data Squad, but unless you were a massive fan of the franchise, they pretty much flew under the radar outside of Japan. Then, in 2020 the franchise rebooted the original Digimon Adventure series. It was met with mixed reviews with many complaining that the elements of friendship and teamwork had been left out in favor of more battle scenes and a generic hero story. But fans who want a more action-packed series should check it out.\n\nThe most recent entry is Digimon Ghost Game, which aired from 2021-2023. The series took Digimon to its darkest (and arguably coolest) realm yet. The new series involves a type of ghost Digimon that can only be seen when using a special device. The show, along with the 2022 video game Digimon Survive, was both praised and criticized. Those looking for the nostalgic vibe of the original show felt no connection to the new series, but fans who were open to the new darker, creeper, and more edgy take found the show to be unique and fresh.\n\nHere’s the full list of the Digimon series in order:\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters Parts 1 & 2 (1999-2001)\n\nDigimon Tamers (2001-2002)\n\nDigimon Frontier (2002-2003)\n\nDigimon Data Squad (2006-2007)\n\nDigimon Fusion (2010-2012)\n\nDigimon Universe: App Monsters (2016-2017)\n\nDigimon Adventure (2020-2021)\n\nDigimon Ghost Game (2021-2023)\n\nWhere Can I Watch Every Digimon Series Online?\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where you can watch every Digimon series streaming online!\n\nBased on the hit comic of the same name, The Boys has become a smash hit for Prime Video. The series takes place in a world where superheroes are treated like celebrities…but some abuse their power and fame, often becoming egotistical and maniacal. The show is a darker take on the superhero genre, but it’s also slyly funny and incredibly smart. Its violence and humor make it more adult-oriented than other superhero shows, but it also gives it a unique edge in the genre.\n\nIf you love The Boys, check out these other great shows that are streaming on platforms like Max, Netflix and Disney+ right now!\n\nWatchmen\n\nJust as The Boys puts a more adult spin on the superhero genre, HBO’s Watchmen had tons of mature themes. But whereas The Boys is more for shock and humor, Watchmen uses superheroes to dig into the world’s history of bigotry, racism, and disenfranchisement. Though only lasting one season, the show was a smash hit, earning numerous awards including multiple Emmys and even a Peabody Award.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy\n\nAnother popular series that puts a unique twist on the superhero genre is The Umbrella Academy. The series follows a group of superpowered orphans who are adopted and become a family. The show is all over the place (in the best way possible) and involves everything from time travel to themes of trauma and found-families. But at its core, the show is loaded with heart and humor.\n\nGen V\n\nIf you love The Boys then why not check out the show’s spin-off series, Gen V? The show centers around a group of “Supes” attending Godolkin University as they seek to grow and become the best superheroes they can be. But the university has close ties with the corrupt Vought corporation, so the students need to decide if they want to give in to fame and influence, or do the right thing.\n\nHeroes\n\nLong before The Boys premiered, there was Heroes. Premiering in 2006, the show centers around a group of people who suddenly discover they have superpowers. The series had a great ensemble cast that included Ali Larter, Hayden Panettiere, and Masi Oka, and it’s been reported that a reboot series called Heroes: Eclipsed is currently in development.\n\nPeacemaker\n\nFans of The Boys will Love Peacemaker. The show is a spin-off of 2021’s The Suicide Squad movie and centers around John Cena’s character Peacemaker. Just like The Boys, the show takes a more adult approach to the superhero genre and is loaded with violence, comedy, and nudity. Fans can look forward to a second season, which is currently in development.\n\nThe Boys Presents: Diabolical\n\nAnother spin-off that fans of The Boys will love is The Boys Presents: Diabolical. The anthology series tells different side stories from The Boys universe, with each episode having its own plot. The animated series is also hilarious and each episode is written by comedians like Andy Samberg, Ilana Glazer, and Seth Rogen, among others.\n\nLEGO Marvel Avengers: Code Red\n\nIf you loved the way The Boys puts a new spin on the superhero genre, you’ll love LEGO’s Marvel adaptation. While The Boys went for a more Rated-R twist on the genre, LEGO goes for a more PG route, but its wacky silliness is enough to make superhero fans of all ages laugh. For a ridiculously fun time, you gotta check out the way LEGO puts its own humor on the Marvel universe.\n\nMarvel’s The Defenders\n\nIf you loved the superhero team in The Boys, then check out The Defenders. The Marvel series brought back all of its Netflix characters to star together in a miniseries. Fans can see Charlie Cox’s Daredevil unite with Krysten Ritter’s Jessica Jones and Mike Colter’s Luke Cage for their biggest adventure yet. The miniseries also had a great supporting cast like Rosario Dawson and Sigourney Weaver.\n\nInvincible\n\nBased on the comic of the same name, the animated series Invincible follows a teenage guy who begins to develop superpowers. But don’t let the fact that it’s animated make you think it’s a kid’s cartoon. The show is more targeted at teens and adults and has a lot of maturity and depth to it. Invincible wrapped its second season back in April and rumors are already swirling that the show has been renewed for a third season.\n\nMarvel’s Runaways\n\nGrowing up, everyone had days where they thought their parents were awful… but in Runaways, a group of teenagers find out their parents really are awful and run a supervillain group called the Pride. If you liked the way The Boys switched up the standard superhero formula, you’ll love the new twist that Runways adds to the genre.\n\nWhere Can I Watch Shows Like The Boys Online?\n\nUse our guide below to find out where you can watch shows like The Boys that are streaming in the United States right now!\n\nThe Jake Gyllenhaal-led Presumed Innocent recently became the most-watched drama on Apple TV+. Based on the novel of the same name, the legal thriller delves into the story of Rusty Sabich (Gyllenhaal), a prosecutor accused of killing his colleague, whom he also had an affair with.\n\nThe series' tense courtroom scenes and powerful performances earned it a second season. While viewers wait for season 2, they can check out 10 great legal thrillers and dramas like Presumed Innocent, which can be streamed online today on platforms like Apple TV+, Netflix, Hulu, and more!\n\nCandy\n\nLike Presumed Innocent, Candy combines murder with a complicated love triangle. Based on a true story, the series follows Candy Montgomery (Jessica Biel), a suburban housewife accused of killing her neighbor, Betty Gore (Melanie Lynskey), while having an affair with Gore’s husband. The show boasts powerful performances from Biel and Lynskey, a dark true crime premise, and plenty of family drama.\n\nDefending Jacob\n\nBased on the book of the same name by William Landay, Defending Jacob follows Assistant District Attorney Andy Barber (Chris Evans), whose 14-year-old son, Jacob Barber (Jaden Martell), becomes the prime suspect in the death of a fellow high school student. Similar to Presume Innocent, Defending Jacob sees a man in the legal profession torn between doing his job and loyalty to his family, and the show also features an A-list cast and a deep dive into a murder mystery.\n\nEric\n\nEric is a psychological thriller that follows Vincent Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch), a puppeteer who sets out to find his missing son. Meanwhile, Detective Michael Ledroit (McKinley Belcher III) navigates corruption in the New York Police Department to solve the case. Eric offers a more whimsical approach to crime than Presumed Innocent when Vincent begins conversing with his son’s imaginary friend. Still, it’s just as thrilling with its story of a family struggling under a crime case and deep corruption in the justice system.\n\nMare of Easttown\n\nThe critically acclaimed Mare of Easttown follows Detective Marianne \"Mare\" Sheehan (Kate Winslet), a woman hailed as a hero in her hometown, who cracks under the pressure of a homicide case and her family's turmoil. It’s an even more serious and female-focused series than Presumed Innocent, offering a career-best performance from Winslet and an unpredictable story that probes topics of abuse, addiction, and grief.\n\nReasonable Doubt\n\nBoth Reasonable Doubt and Presumed Innocent focus on flawed defense attorneys. Reasonable Doubt follows Jax Stewart (Emayatzy Corinealdi), a sharp and successful defense attorney who sometimes blurs the lines of work and personal life and has a penchant for drama. While the show has a more comedic tone than Presumed Innocent, both shows offer strong performances and a deep dive into the messy personal lives of two lawyers.\n\nSuspicion\n\nSuspicion is perfect for viewers who love the thrilling mystery at the center of Presumed Innocent. The series follows a group of four ordinary citizens who are suddenly accused of involvement in a high-profile kidnapping case. Like Presumed Innocent, the show is a fast-paced legal thriller that will leave viewers constantly second-guessing who is innocent.\n\nThe Crowded Room\n\nThe Crowded Room offers viewers a legal thriller with some intense courtroom scenes. The series follows investigator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried), who is tasked with acquitting her client, Danny Sullivan (Tom Holland), by using his dissociative identity disorder (DID) as a defense. It is a dark and thrilling legal drama about one man’s desperation to prove his innocence despite the odds against him.\n\nThe Undoing\n\nSimilar to Presumed Innocent, The Undoing takes advantage of its brilliant cast, with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant offering riveting performances. The series follows Grace Fraser (Kidman), a successful psychologist whose life turns upside down when her husband, Jonathan (Hugh Grant), is accused of killing his mistress. As a result, it’s almost like Presume Innocent but from the wife’s perspective and with plenty of its own unique twists and turns.\n\nUnder the Bridge\n\nUnder the Bridge is a true crime drama about Reena Virk (Vritika Gupta). Her small town is rattled when Reena disappears one day, but the case grows even more unsettling when the police realize the young ages of the main suspects. It boasts the same mystery and drama as Presumed Innocent but also offers a more nuanced look into crime and the factors that motivate it.\n\nYour Honor\n\nYour Honor follows Michael Desiato (Bryan Cranston), a father willing to do anything to protect his son, Adam (Hunter Doohan), after he’s involved in a hit-and-run accident. Presumed Innocent and Your Honor explore men willing to go to great lengths to protect themselves and their families. However, Your Honor also offers additional action as it frequently takes things outside the justice system.\n\nWhere to watch shows like Presumed Innocent online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where you can stream these shows like Presumed Innocent in the United States.\n\nSquid Game became a smash hit on Netflix, gripping audiences with its horrifying but impactful story and gruesome, macabre premise. The series centers around a nefarious game, where hundreds of money-stricken contestants compete for riches. But the losers don’t simply go home, they die. But the grim and terrifying tale is more than just horror, it’s a sharp and cutting critique of poverty in capitalist societies and the growing wealth gap in the developed world. If you loved Squid Game, check out our guide below to discover more shows and movies like Squid Game you’ll love!\n\nAnyone who loves Squid Game needs to go back to the original. The genesis for every deadly game plot is the 1924 short story The Most Dangerous Game. The story follows a reclusive and wealthy hunter who has grown bored of animals and decides he needs a bigger challenge – he wants to hunt humans. He equips his captives with food and weapons and sets them loose on a remote island, letting them know that in three hours, he’ll begin hunting them. The story has inspired countless films throughout history, including the iconic 1932 adaptation, which has been widely influential in Hollywood.\n\nFor a more sci-fi take on Squid Game, check out 2015’s Circle. The movie is sort of like Squid Game combined with The Weakest Link and follows a group of 50 people who suddenly awaken in a dark room, all standing in a circle. Every two minutes, someone is killed and the group quickly discovers that they can vote for who dies next. Bigotry, social status, ageism, and other factors all influence who the group decides to kill. The big question throughout the film is who put them in the room and why?\n\nBut the two most notable similar movies to Squid Game would be The Hunger Games and Battle Royale. Both center around a group of young people who are forced to fight to the death. In Battle Royale, it’s a pilot program by a fascist government to cut down on free thinking, and in The Hunger Games, it’s to keep the poorer districts living in fear and misery, preventing them from starting a revolution. Just like Squid Game, both films have an underlying message about inequality and corrupt governments.\n\nIf you’re looking for something a little less unsettling and more action-focused, check out The Condemned. The 2007 film follows a group of prisoners who are given a chance at freedom and wealth by competing in a secret life-or-death game. They’re all transported to a remote island and only one prisoner will be able to leave. To earn their freedom, they must kill everyone else. The movie has a WWE feel to it and is great for anyone who wants something that feels less sadistic and more like a typical action movie.\n\nWhere to watch shows and movies like Squid Game Online\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where you can watch even more shows and movies like Squid Game that are streaming online right now, like Cube, Saw, and more!\n\nThe Mission: Impossible films have been delighting viewers since 1996 with the thrilling and action-packed adventures of the intelligent and physically skilled agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise).\n\nAs viewers await the upcoming 2025 Mission: Impossible movie, they can check our guide to find 10 great films like Mission: Impossible that can be streamed online today on platforms like Max, Netflix, Hulu, and more!\n\nBridge of Spies\n\nFor viewers interested in the fictional espionage agency Hunt works for, Impossible Missions Force (IMF), Bridge of Spies offers insight into how real-life espionage works. The espionage thriller follows James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer determined to give a fair trial to an alleged spy from the Soviet Union, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). With spies, prisoner exchanges, and Cold War tension, Bridge of Spies is a true story as thrilling as the Mission: Impossible movies.\n\nBullet Train\n\nBullet Train will appeal to viewers who enjoy Mission: Impossible for its fast-paced, stunt-filled, and action-packed scenes. The movie follows assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt), whose latest mission sees him confronted with numerous deadly figures aboard the fastest train in the world. It’s a more comedic alternative to Mission: Impossible and offers numerous exhilarating action sequences.\n\nCasino Royale\n\nCasino Royale and all the movies in the James Bond franchise will appeal to Mission: Impossible fans. The British MI6 operative often garners comparisons to Hunt, as both are highly skilled and intelligent secret agents. Meanwhile, Casino Royale is often considered one of the best Bond movies as Daniel Craig reinvents the character in an intense spy thriller with a serious and haunting tone.\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4\n\nViewers who enjoyed Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One will be interested in John Wick: Chapter 4. Both movies received high attention for their nearly flawless execution of action sequences and massive stakes. John Wick: Chapter 4 sees Keanu Reeves’ titular assassin take on the most powerful criminal organization in the world, the High Table. Like the most recent Mission: Impossible movie, it boasts creativity and quality while making everything bigger and bolder than previous installments.\n\nSpy Game\n\nSpy Game is an underrated action thriller that follows CIA operative Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) as he utilizes all his skills and resources to free his protégé Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) from China’s custody. It’s a strong espionage movie with powerful performances and a clever storyline that strongly parallels Mission: Impossible III’s plot.\n\nThe Bourne Identity\n\nThe Bourne Identity and the Jason Bourne franchise as a whole will appeal to fans of Mission: Impossible, especially given the comparisons between Bourne (Matt Damon) and Hunt. The first movie is similar to the first Mission: Impossible story, as it is an origin story with an underlying mystery where Bourne is rescued from the Mediterranean Sea with amnesia and an uncertain connection to the CIA.\n\nThe Gray Man\n\nLike the Mission: Impossible movies, The Gray Man runs at a breakneck pace and keeps the adrenaline pumping with its action sequences. The film sees CIA agent Sierra Six (Ryan Gosling) uncover secrets about his agency that set a whole torrent of assassins after him. While it’s not as carefully crafted or serious as some of the Mission: Impossible movies, it still will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe Hunt for Red October\n\nThe Hunt for Red October is a film adaptation of Tom Clancy’s book of the same name. It follows Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), a CIA intelligence analyst, who is the only one who detects a subtle Russian threat to the U.S. and has limited time to convince his superiors of the plot. The film is perfect for viewers who love Cold War espionage thrillers and Mission: Impossible's suspense and sometimes outlandish plots.\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nBased on a true story, the film follows a black ops team secretly commissioned by Winston Churchill (Rory Kinnear) to disrupt Germany’s U-boat supply operation during World War II. The movie boasts nonstop action, a breezy pace, and a real-life mission as seemingly impossible as those tackled in Mission: Impossible.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nViewers who watch the Mission: Impossible movies for Cruise and the breathtaking stunts will be interested in Top Gun: Maverick. The Top Gun sequel sees Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Cruise) tasked with leading a group of Top Gun graduates on a dangerous mission. The movie features some of the most striking aerial stunts, and Cruise offers one of his best performances yet as the charismatic pilot who must face his past.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Mission: Impossible\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to watch these 10 great movies like Mission: Impossible online in the United States!\n\nGame of Thrones was one of the biggest shows in TV history, scoring impressive ratings and breaking records with its finale, which was watched by 19.3 million viewers in 2019. But what made the show such a huge hit? Was it the epic battles, the massive ensemble cast, the warring kingdoms, and the sneaky, conniving rivalries? If you loved all the action and scandal that made Game of Thrones so popular, check out these other similar shows that are streaming now!\n\nFirst up, all Game of Thrones fans need to check out the prequel series House of the Dragon. Based on George R.R. Martin’s book Fire & Blood, the series takes place 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and sees an era when the House Targaryen reigns supreme. But conflict and power struggles soon puts the powerful empire in peril. If you loved Game of Thrones, you’ll love HBO’s equally-praised new series.\n\nFans of Game of Thrones’ high fantasy and epic adventure will also love The Lord of the Rings (which is also based on an iconic book series). Just like House of the Dragon, Amazon’s The Rings of Power serves as a prequel to the iconic films. Inspired by the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, the series takes place thousands of years before The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, telling the story of how and why Sauron’s ring was created. Dueling factions, an evil emergence, and a great high fantasy world will be exactly what GOT fans are looking for.\n\nFor a more real-life take on Game of Thrones, check out The Tudors. If you think GOT was filled with drama, just wait ‘til you hear about the life of King Henry VIII. Not only did he have six wives (including the infamous and fan-favorite Anne Boleyn) but he also had two of them killed so he could marry someone else. On top of his lust and rage, Henry also had to deal with religious uprisings and diplomatic crises with Rome and France. They say fact is stranger than fiction, and The Tudors proves that’s absolutely true, serving up more real-life drama than GOT could ever imagine.\n\nAnother show GOT fans will love is Outlander. Also based on a book series, the show follows a woman who is suddenly transported to the year 1743 and gets wrapped up in a war between Scottish clans. Throughout the series, she’s thrust into historical conflicts throughout time, from French monarchies to exploring the New World and more. For a less war-focused and more adventure-centered story that GOT fans will still love, be sure to check out Outlander.\n\nWhere Can I Watch Shows Like Game of Thrones Online?\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where you can watch more series like Game of Thrones online, from classic hits like Deadwood to more recent releases like Mary & George, and more!\n\nBreaking Bad is one of the most critically acclaimed TV shows of all time, winning countless accolades and earning a cult following over its five-year run.\n\nViewers became enamored with the suspenseful and social commentary-filled story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a terminally ill family man who turns to drug dealing to ensure his family will be taken care of after his passing.\n\nIf you’ve missed Breaking Bad since it concluded, here are 10 other great crime dramas or shows with biting social commentary you can stream online today on platforms like Netflix, Max, Prime Video, and more!\n\nBarry\n\nBarry is a dark comedy that follows Barry Berkman (Bill Hader), a veteran and hitman who starts to question his life choices and criminal activity when he begins building a secret new life in Los Angeles. Like Breaking Bad, Barry follows a man constantly navigating moral dilemmas and probing whether one is ever too far gone to do the right thing. It also features strong performances and a good dose of dark humor.\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nOne can’t get much closer to Breaking Bad than the TV show’s official spinoff, Better Call Saul. The series largely serves as a prequel to Breaking Bad, examining the early career of Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), the corrupt lawyer who helped White build his drug empire. It offers viewers the same suspense and drama as Breaking Bad, as it tracks a good man’s slow descent into the world of crime and corruption.\n\nGotham\n\nViewers who love the crime drama aspects of Breaking Bad will especially enjoy Gotham. Based on DC’s Batman comics, the show offers a much more serious tone and delves far deeper into concepts of corruption while following Jim Gordon’s (Bob McKenzie) attempts to restore order in a city notorious for its crime. The show offers a fascinating, dark, and thrilling take on topics like systemic corruption and the meaning of justice.\n\nGriselda\n\nGriselda tells the story of the real-life female version of White: Griselda Blanco (Sofia Vergara). While Blanco isn’t terminally ill, she’s a woman who has been dealt a bad hand in life, growing up in a world of crime and abuse, so she feels she has no choice but to turn to the world of drug trafficking to provide a better life for her children. Like Breaking Bad, it offers a complex and emotional story of how some people feel forced to turn to crime due to a lack of resources and options.\n\nMad Men\n\nMad Men follows Don Draper (Jon Hamm), a man living a double life who tries desperately to maintain his carefully crafted image as an advertising genius and family man. Similar to how Breaking Bad subtly examines issues like the broken healthcare system and underpaid educators, Mad Men puts a magnifying glass on numerous social issues of the 1960s while examining the concepts of identity and happiness.\n\nNarcos\n\nViewers intrigued by White’s drug empire will be interested in Narcos, which tells the true story of Pablo Escobar’s (Wagner Moura) rise to power as a Colombian drug lord. The show offers a far grittier and more realistic take on drug lords and narcoterrorism, making it a great series for Breaking Bad fans who want to learn how much the show gets right about drug trafficking.\n\nOzark\n\nOzark follows Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman), a family man and former financial adviser who is forced into a money laundering scheme and must go deeper into the business to protect his family. The series echoes Breaking Bad’s masterful tracking of a character’s development and growth while learning to navigate the criminal underworld. Viewers may find it interesting to compare Byrde and White’s character arcs and how their stories diverge despite both being motivated by family and good intentions.\n\nPeaky Blinders\n\nPeaky Blinders is a period crime drama that follows the exploits of war hero Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) and his gang, the Peaky Blinders, following World War I. Like Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders is considered one of the best crime dramas, although they have very different tones. Both tackle moral dilemmas, scrutinize their time period, and boast an exciting pace and quality performances.\n\nThe Boys\n\nThe Boys isn’t a crime drama, but it’s one of the few shows that tackles controversial subjects as effectively as Breaking Bad. The series is a superhero dark comedy that follows a group of vigilantes on a quest to stop corrupt superheroes from ruling the world. Like Breaking Bad, it delves deep into the concept of good, evil, and justice while often viewing America through a dark, satirical lens.\n\nThe Sopranos\n\nThe Sopranos follows Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) as he tries to balance his life as a family man with his job as the head of a mob. Similar to Breaking Bad, it offers viewers a blend of family and crime and an iconic lead antihero who comes across as relatable and likable despite leading a corrupt lifestyle.\n\nWhere to watch shows like Breaking Bad online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream these 10 great shows like Breaking Bad in the United States!\n\nThere’s lots of reasons why The Fast and The Furious became a multi-billion dollar franchise. Whether you love the great ensemble cast, the cool cars, the speedy action, or the wild adventures, the series is undeniably one hell of a wild ride. If you enjoy the Fast & Furious franchise, check out our guide below to discover movies like Fast & Furious streaming right now that you’ll love!\n\nJoy Ride\n\nPaul Walker? Check. Speedy car action? Check. If you loved the Fast & Furious movies, you’re going to enjoy Joy Ride. In the film, a group of friends piss off a psychotic trucker while driving through the desert and are then forced to outrun him… or lose their lives. Joy Ride is great for anyone who wants a more suspenseful twist on a car movie.\n\nSpeed Racer\n\nLook, I know that Fast & Furious is “cool” and “manly”, but let’s be real here… it’s also campy AF. But that’s not a bad thing. Sometimes the best movies are the ones that are purely and absolutely chaotic. For an even campier and crazier movie about high-speed chases, check out the Wachowski’s take on Speed Racer. It’s fast, colorful, wacky, funny, and truly unique.\n\nGone in 60 Seconds\n\nA remake of the 1974 classic, Gone in 60 Seconds follows Nicolas Cage as he attempts to steal valuable cars for a crime boss who is holding his brother hostage. If you like all the action, explosions, guns, and crime of the Fast & Furious movies, you’re gonna love this cheesy 2000 hit.\n\nDeath Proof\n\nWhat happens when Quentin Tarantino crafts a movie centered around his love of classic cars? You get Death Proof. In the movie, a group of girls are speeding through Texas in a ‘71 Dodge Challenger… but they’re being stalked by a murderous stuntman driving an old-school stunt car designed for carnage. Car lovers and action fans will both love Death Proof.\n\nTwisted Metal\n\nSure, Twisted Metal is a TV series and not a movie, but if you’re a Fast & Furious fan, you need to watch it. The show is inspired by the iconic video game franchise and takes place in a post-apocalyptic America where warring factions drive tricked-out automobiles designed for bloodshed. If you thought Fast & Furious was full of wild cars, just wait until you see the auto madness of Twisted Metal.\n\nSpeed\n\nYou know the story: Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are trapped in a bus that’s been rigged with an explosive. The bomb will explode if the bus’ speed drops below 50 mph. Like all proper ‘90s action movies, Speed is truly ridiculous and stupid, but oh soooo much fun. If you love great action movies set in automobiles, this is a must-watch.\n\nNow You See Me\n\nNow You See Me isn’t a car movie, and oddly enough it’s actually about a team of magicians. But the film centers around a great heist and the way the team assembles and uses their various personalities and talents feels very much like the Fast & Furious movies. The film received great reviews and grossed over $351 million at the box office, becoming a surprise hit.\n\nI Am Paul Walker\n\nAll true Fast fans hold a place for Paul Walker in their hearts. The actor and star of the franchise tragically died in a car accident in 2013. The documentary I Am Paul Walker gives viewers a behind-the-scenes look at Walker’s life, including his childhood, his life off-camera, and his acting career from movies like Varsity Blues to his breakout role in The Fast and The Furious.\n\nUnstoppable\n\nLove the action and danger of all the speeding cars in the Fast movies? Then you’ll definitely enjoy Unstoppable, a movie about a runaway freight train that’s barreling down the tracks at full speed. Even worse, in a nearby city the track makes a hard turn that, at the speed it’s going, will derail the train, killing hundreds. A team of experts must race against time to stop the locomotive before it causes widespread destruction.\n\nDeath Race\n\nIn the future, a prison earns money by streaming “death races” online, where inmates compete in tricked-out cars for their freedom… or death. Starring Jason Statham, the movie is the kind of bonkers testosterone fest that Fast fans are looking for. Plus, it even has Fast star Tyrese Gibson in the cast.\n\nWhere can I watch movies like Fast & Furious online?\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where great movies like Fast & Furious are streaming online in the United States right now!\n\nThe Marvel antihero Eric Cross Brooks (a.k.a. Blade) is making a comeback. After the character was referenced in the hit movie Deadpool & Wolverine, anticipation has risen for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Blade reboot, which will see Academy Award-winning actor Mahershala Ali take up the mantle of Blade. While awaiting Blade’s return to the big screen, check out our guide to learn where to stream every Blade movie and TV show in order!\n\nIn the comics, Blade is a half-human, half-vampire who uses his unique physiology to become a vampire hunter and rid the world of all vampires. His first screen appearance was in the animated Spider-Man (1994) TV show as a supporting character. However, he gained much more recognition from New Line Cinema’s Blade franchise.\n\nThe franchise started in 1998 with the release of Blade, which saw Wesley Snipes in the titular role. In the film, Blade has all the strengths of a vampire but none of their weaknesses, which serves him well in his mission of vengeance against the species. Blade was a box office success and hailed as a worthy comic back adaptation, resulting in Snipes’ Blade and Kris Kristofferson’s Abraham Whistler returning for Blade II and Blade: Trinity.\n\nThe Blade series floundered with the release of Blade: Trinity, which also starred Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King and Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler. While the film saw Blade team up with rogue vampire hunters to fight Dracula (Dominic Purcell), critics panned it for its formulaic story and campy tone. Hence, New Line Cinema changed directions and released Blade: The Series. The live-action TV show takes place after Blade: Trinity and sees Blade aid Krista Starr (Jill Wagner) in getting vengeance for her brother’s death at the hands of vampires.\n\nBlade: The Series was praised for its action and story. However, many viewers were dissatisfied that Snipes didn’t return to the show, with Kirk \"Sticky Fingaz\" Jones taking over the role. The show was canceled after one season. Meanwhile, New Line Cinema wouldn’t have much time to explore Blade further as Marvel Studios reclaimed the rights to the character in 2012.\n\nSince gaining the rights to him, the MCU has begun developing its Blade reboot, which is set to premiere on November 7, 2025. In the meantime, Blade has appeared twice in other MCU works. Ali debuted as Blade in a voice cameo at the end of Eternals, while Snipes reprised his role as a variant of Blade in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nHow to watch the Blade movies and TV shows in order\n\nAs with most superhero movies, it is best to watch the Blade movies and shows by cinematic universes. The best order is to watch New Line Cinema’s Blade franchise first, followed by the MCU’s Blade projects. If viewers want more Blade content, they can also watch the animated works featuring Blade. See below for how to watch Blade by universe:\n\nNew Line Cinema’s Blade Franchise\n\nBlade\n\nBlade II\n\nBlade: Trinity\n\nBlade: The Series\n\nMCU\n\nEternals\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nBlade\n\nAnimated Shows\n\nSpider-Man\n\nMarvel Anime: Blade\n\nUltimate Spider-Man Season 2 Episodes 21 - 22\n\nMarvel’s Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.\n\nMarvel Disk Wars: The Avengers\n\nWhere to watch all Blade movies and TV shows online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to watch all the Blade movies and TV shows in the United States by the order of release date!\n\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise is making a comeback over a decade after Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series became two of the highest-grossing trilogies of all time.\n\nAmazon renewed interest in the franchise with its Middle-earth-inspired Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power TV show. Now, the franchise will return to the big screen with The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nWhile waiting for the highly anticipated movies to arrive, check out our guide for 10 other high fantasy and fellowship movies like The Lord of the Rings you stream online right now on platforms like Disney+, Paramount+, Hulu, and more!\n\nArmy of Darkness\n\nViewers who love the battle scenes and chilling monsters in the Lord of the Rings trilogy will enjoy Army of Darkness. Army of Darkness is the third installment in the Evil Dead franchise, in which Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported to medieval times. Although it’s a horror comedy, it boasts surprising similarities to Lord of the Rings, with Ash establishing a fellowship, the presence of a Gandalf-like wizard, and an epic castle battle scene reminiscent of Helm’s Deep.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\n\nSimilar to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves follows an unlikely band of adventurers who embark on an epic quest. The group, led by the charming thief Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine), is as lovable as any band of Hobbits or Dwarves, while the film effectively builds a fantasy world filled with elves and wizards. It’s a great film for anyone looking for a more light-hearted alternative to Lord of the Rings.\n\nEragon\n\nEragon is a fantasy movie that follows a farm boy, Eragon (Ed Speelers), who sets off on an adventure after discovering a coveted dragon egg. From the fictional fantasy world to the evil ruler to the unsuspecting central hero, Eragon echoes the main plot points of the Lord of the Rings. Its dragon-centered premise will also appeal to fans of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, although fans of the Eragon book may be disappointed by its divergence from the source material.\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story isn’t a fantasy movie but includes a sophisticated fictional universe and a group of heroes on a daring adventure. It’s a standalone Star Wars movie that tells the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who joins forces with resistance fighters to foil the Death Star plans. The group’s perilous journey to the realm of evil strongly parallels the Lord of the Rings fellowship’s trip to Mordor.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of few works to introduce a fictional world nearly as sophisticated as Tolkien’s Middle-earth. Both Tolkien and C. S. Lewis have been described as the “Fathers of Modern Fantasy,” so it’s not surprising the film adaptations of their work share similarities, including the ability to wholly transport viewers into a new realm with its own history, mythology, and forces of good and evil.\n\nThe Green Knight\n\nThe Green Knight is an epic medieval fantasy movie that follows Sir Gaiwan (Dev Patel) as he struggles with whether to accept the consequences of his battle with the Green Knight (Ralph Ineson). It will appeal to viewers who love the gorgeous cinematography, soundtrack, and honorable warriors in Lord of the Rings. Also, the film has a unique connection to Lord of the Rings, as it’s inspired by the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which Tolkien translated to English with E. V. Gordon.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nIf you’re looking for a kid-friendly alternative to The Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz is the film for you. The 1939 musical fantasy follows Dorothy (Judy Garland), a young woman from Kansas who is transported to the magical land of Oz, where she seeks help from a great wizard to return home. While it’s a light-hearted musical with flying monkeys and witches, it’s also a great introduction to fantasy with a simplified Lord of the Rings-esque story of a group of travelers in a magical land.\n\nTolkien\n\nTolkien isn’t a fantasy story, but the biopic will appeal to most Lord of the Rings fans. The film examines Tolkien's (Nicholas Hoult) early life, including how he came to love language and drew inspiration from his experiences in World War I for his trilogy. Viewers interested in The Lord of the Rings’ themes and parallels to real life will enjoy Tolkien.\n\nWarcraft\n\nViewers who loved the epic war scenes in The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies will be especially intrigued by Warcraft. The fantasy movie is based on the video game series of the same name and sees a war break out between humans and orcs when dark magic causes their worlds to collide. It’s an epic war movie filled with fantastical creatures, dark magic, and realms reminiscent of the world of Lord of the Rings.\n\nWillow\n\nWillow is a dark fantasy film with many similarities to The Lord of the Rings' tale of good vs. evil, although instead of a ring, the key to an evil ruler’s reign is a baby. Since it was released in 1988, many Lord of the Rings fans grew up watching Willow. The two films capitalize on a high fantasy premise, feature many archetypes in the fantasy genre, and both feature groundbreaking visual effects and costumes for the time, giving them a similar vibe.\n\nWhere to watch movies like The Lord of the Rings online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream these 10 movies like The Lord of the Rings in the United States!\n\nJames Bond is one of the longest-running film franchises of all time. Based on Ian Fleming’s book series of the same name, the franchise has produced 27 movies with seven different iterations of Bond at the time of writing. Since Daniel Craig retired from the role following No Time to Die, the film series has been on hiatus while the search for the next Bond continues.\n\nWhile you wait for the next era of Bond, check out our guide for 10 great movies similar to the James Bond series you can stream online today on platforms like Apple TV+, Peacock, and more!\n\nArgo\n\nThe James Bond movies and Argo feature a spy leading a high-stakes covert mission, but the main difference is that Argo is based on actual events. It tells the stranger-than-fiction true story of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA exfiltration specialist, who used the cover of a fake film production to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran. In addition to featuring a highly intelligent and pragmatic spy and a high-stakes mission, Argo’s incredible story and performances earned it several Oscars.\n\nArgylle\n\nViewers who love the campier early Bond films like Diamonds are Forever will enjoy the lighthearted spy comedy Argylle. The movie sees the novelist Ellie Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) pulled into an international spy scheme when her books seemingly start to predict real-life events. It’s a wild and off-kilter story, but Henry Cavill’s Bond-like Argylle and the underlying romance make it an enjoyable spy movie.\n\nAtomic Blonde\n\nAtomic Blonde’s Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is often considered a female Bond, given that both are mysterious, elite spies working for MI6. Theron effectively makes the character her own, though, in an adrenaline-pumping plot set before the collapse of the Berlin Wall. With a woman who gives Bond a run for his money as the most elite spy, John Wick-esque action scenes, and unpredictable plot twists, Atomic Blonde is even better than what most imagined a female 007 movie would look like.\n\nGhosted\n\nGhosted is another more playful alternative to the James Bond movies. The film follows Sadie Rhodes (Ana de Armas), a secret agent who unintentionally pulls her needy and clueless boyfriend, Cole Turner (Chris Evans), into one of her missions. Although it’s largely a hilarious, action-packed rom-com, it does borrow a few pages from Bond with major story twists and over-the-top villains.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service\n\nViewers who love Bond's dapper and gentlemanly charm will be interested in Kingsman: The Secret Service, which features a whole organization of gentlemen spies. Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is recruited into the secret service his father secretly worked for and quickly takes on a global threat in a stylish but brutal fashion. Kingsman: The Secret Service boasts more violence and humor than the typical Bond movie but capitalizes on its agents’ gentlemanly flair.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\n\nAll of the Mission Impossible movies are great for fans of Bond, with many considering Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) the closest thing to the American equivalent of Bond. Meanwhile, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is often considered the best movie in the franchise with its fast pace, high-quality action sequences, and intriguing plot of Hunt’s race against time to stop a nuclear terrorist attack.\n\nMunich\n\nMunich is a high-stakes spy drama based on historical events. It follows Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent tasked with assembling a team to assassinate the terrorists who carried out an attack on the Israeli Olympic team at the 1972 Olympics. The movie is a high-quality, nuanced spy thriller that will appeal to viewers looking for a more realistic depiction of the world of espionage than Bond.\n\nThe Bourne Identity\n\nLike Mission Impossible, the whole Jason Bourne franchise will appeal to Bond fans. The Bourne Identity tells the important origin story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a man suffering from amnesia who is skilled in combat and has mysterious ties to the CIA. It’s a great movie for fans seeking a more action-packed, mysterious alternative to James Bond.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a spy thriller that follows CIA agent Napoleon Soto (Henry Cavill) and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who are forced to team up and foil a criminal organization’s plot to spark a nuclear war between the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War. It’s a stylish and charming spy movie, which will be a real treat to Bond fans who have long wished to see Cavill as an iteration of Bond.\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a spy thriller that tells the true story of Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s off-the-books black ops team who secretly played a vital role in World War II by disrupting the German U-boat supply. In addition to offering viewers an intricate spy story and non-stop action, the film also features Bond author Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), as Fleming’s role within Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during WWII partially inspired his Bond novels.\n\nWhere to watch movies like James Bond online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream these 10 movies like James Bond in the United States!\n\nAiring from 2007-2012, Gossip Girl was one of the hottest teen dramas of the late 2000s. The show centered around a privileged group of teens in Manhattan’s Upper East Side who attend one of the city’s most affluent schools. Through their privilege, they live sordid, drama-fueled lives… and someone seems to know all about it and is publishing it all on a blog for the world to read.

You can enjoy the iconic 2004 original film or the 2024 musical remake starring Renee Rapp.\n\nWhere Can I Watch Movies and TV Shows Like Gossip Girl Online?\n\nThere are tons of other great movies and TV shows that fans of Gossip Girl will love, from the Yale-set secret society thriller The Skulls to Peacock’s One of Us is Lying, where the school gossip suddenly dies and everyone is a suspect.

With the release of Alien: Romulus, the upcoming Alien: Rogue Incursion video game, and the upcoming Alien: Earth TV series on FX… the franchise is arguably hotter than ever.\n\nIf you can’t wait for the next installment to be released, check out our guide below to discover other great movies like Alien that you can stream right now using platforms like Netflix, Disney+, Max, Prime Video and more!\n\nPredator\n\nNo, Alien and Predator were not made by the same people nor were they originally in the same cinematic universe. But the two franchises just blend together perfectly. So perfect in fact that they’ve even created an entire Alien vs. Predator franchise. If you love the Alien movies, trust me, you need to watch Predator. It’s an absolute must.\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nAlien’s famous tagline was “In space no one can hear you scream,” and the movie was lauded for creating great tension by utilizing the depths of space to make the crew of the Nostromo completely stranded and helpless. Event Horizon utilizes a similar setting, this time on a spaceship that’s literally been to hell and back…and it’s brought a few stragglers back with it.\n\nThe Thing\n\nOne of the best (and scariest) parts about Alien is the horrifying xenomorph. If you want some more terrifying (and totally gross) morphing alien carnage, you need to watch John Carpenter’s classic The Thing. In the movie, a group is stranded in an Antarctic base, but they discover they’re not alone. A parasitic alien is able to infect hosts and take their shape, or turn them into monstrous creatures. The Thing is 100% body horror, and will definitely make your skin crawl.\n\nThe Fourth Kind\n\nSet in Alaska, The Fourth Kind presents a first-contact movie where Milla Jovovich is victimized by extraterrestrial forces. The movie had a brilliant marketing campaign that purported the story to be true, even fabricating news articles online and claiming that the very real Chapman University had conducted the studies. For a totally unique take on an alien movie, you gotta watch The Fourth Kind.\n\nDead Space: Downfall\n\nBased on the popular video game series (which is partly inspired by Event Horizon which is also on this list), Dead Space: Downfall centers around a space crew that discovers a mysterious artifact on an alien planet. After bringing it aboard their ship, something evil comes with it and begins killing everyone. Yeah, it’s a lot like Alien and that’s exactly why you’re gonna love it. There was also a follow-up with Dead Space: Aftermath.\n\nNOPE\n\nOne of the more modern alien films is Jordan Peele’s NOPE. The movie has lots of undertones, like society’s obsession with filming everything and our determination to domesticate wild animals – but it’s also a terrifying alien movie about a giant flying creature that becomes territorial and feeds on humans. Yikes.\n\nSunshine\n\nLong before Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh became Oscar winners, they starred in Danny Boyle’s Sunshine. The movie focuses on a space expedition to the sun, where a group of astronauts need to deploy a bomb to reignite the dying star and save Earth. But someone (or something) begins killing off the crew one by one before they can complete their mission… but why? Sunshine was a sleeper hit that’s since become a cult classic thanks to its visceral setting and great story.\n\nUnderwater\n\nUnderwater is kind of like “Alien in the ocean”. In the movie, a team of aquanauts encounter Lovecraftian monsters at the bottom of the sea and they’re forced to fight for their survival. If you love the terror of deep space, you’ll also be terrified by the blackness and bleakness of the ocean’s depths.\n\nLeviathan\n\nBlending Underwater and The Thing together is 1989’s Leviathan. Complete with chest-bursting and all, the movie truly does feel like an underwater version of Alien. Plus, the movie used practical effects instead of CGI, so any practical effects fans will definitely love this undiscovered gem. That same year an almost identical film was released called DeepStar Six that Alien fans will also love.\n\nLife\n\nSet in the near future, Life centers around a crew of astronauts who discover the first proof of extraterrestrial life. Like all good alien movies, the creature is xenomorphic and parasitic, quickly utilizing the astronauts as a food source. The film also starred some surprisingly big names like Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nWhere Can I Watch Movies Like Alien Online?\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where all these movies like Alien are streaming right now!\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, the Alien franchise is returning to the big screen with Alien: Romulus. Before delving into the next installment, viewers may wish to catch up with the prior films in the horror sci-fi franchise. This guide will explain how to watch the Alien movies in order and where you can stream all the movies online!\n\nThe Alien franchise began in 1979 with the release of Alien from director Ridley Scott. It follows the crew of the spacecraft Nostromo, including warrant officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), and executive officer Kane (John Hurt), who are on their way home from a mission in deep space. However, they soon find themselves fighting for survival when an alien species (later identified as Xenomorphs) infiltrates their ship.\n\nAlthough Alien received mixed reviews upon release, it was reassessed and is now considered one of the greatest sci-fi horror movies ever. The blend of horror and sci-fi, the strong female lead in Sigourney Weaver, and the chilling and dreadful premise were groundbreaking. Additionally, the scene where the alien emerges through Kane’s chest is considered one of cinematic history's most iconic scenes.\n\nSigourney Weaver returned for the 1986 sequel, Aliens, with James Cameron signing on to direct. The film sees Ripley return to the original site of the attack on Nostromo after another ship goes dark while in the area. Aliens did what few sequels accomplish and came to be considered equal to or greater than Alien in quality, thrilling viewers with its exploration of a Queen Xenomorph and further character development of Ripley.\n\nWeaver returned for Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection, but the franchise started losing momentum. Alien 3 was criticized for undoing the Aliens' ending, while Alien Resurrection had a convoluted script. Hence, the next Alien film would diverge from the original movies and start a new crossover franchise with Predator.\n\nOriginal Alien director Ridley Scott was vehemently against the crossover and eventually received the green light to revive the franchise with two prequel films, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. The prequel introduced archeologists Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) and android David (Michael Fassbender), who run into a deadly alien species while attempting to track the origin of humanity.\n\nWhile the prequels didn’t entirely eclipse the original movie and its sequel, they received relatively positive reviews. They revitalized the franchise, raising excitement for Alien: Romulus, which will take viewers back to the time of the original films.\n\nHow to watch the Alien movies in order\n\nViewers can either watch the Alien movies in chronological or release date order. Chronological order is fairly simple, as it is the Predator vs. Alien movies, followed by the prequels and original series. The new film, Alien: Romulus, is set to take place between Alien and Aliens. The chronological order is:\n\nAVP: Alien vs. Predator\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem\n\nPrometheus\n\nAlien: Covenant\n\nAlien\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nAliens\n\nAlien 3\n\nAlien Resurrection\n\nWhere to watch the Alien movies online\n\nSee below for the release date order, as well as where to watch the Alien movies online in the United States!\n\nThe release of Netflix’s live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender has renewed interest in the critically acclaimed series.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender set itself apart from other TV shows with its meticulous world-building and tackling of mature topics through a kid-friendly animated series about a group of elemental benders. Although few shows can parallel the groundbreaking nature of the original series, there are other projects that come close to echoing the show's world-building, spirit, and fantasy elements.\n\nCheck out our guide for 10 more great TV shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender that you can stream online right now on platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and more!\n\nAvatar: The Legend of Korra\n\nYou can’t get much closer to Avatar: The Last Airbender than its spinoff series, Avatar: The Legend of Korra. The spinoff takes place 70 years after the original series, where a new Avatar, Korra (Janet Varney), has taken Aang’s place. It delves deeper into more obscure bending powers, such as metal bending and blood bending, and continues its sophisticated worldbuilding by examining a world steeped in political unrest.\n\nBlack Clover\n\nBlack Clover is a strong choice for viewers looking for a more expansive array of elemental powers than the four basic elements in Avatar: The Last Airbender. The anime series takes place in a complex fantasy world where most individuals boast some kind of power, such as wind magic, gravity magic, spatial magic, and many more. It’s a strong anime series that offers viewers a unique look into a society built on magic.\n\nFairy Tail\n\nFairy Tail is another series that offers a more expansive delve into a fantasy world filled with magic. The anime explores seven different types of elemental magic and how a magical world maintains order and peace through numerous wizard guilds. It’s perfect for viewers seeking a more comedic and lighthearted alternative to Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nKipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts\n\nLike Avatar: The Last Airbender, Kipo and the Age of Wondereasts is one of those rare series that appeals to all ages and probes surprisingly mature themes about race and class. It follows Kipo Oak (Karen Fukuhara), a young girl navigating a post-apocalyptic world where humans live underground due to tense relations with the surface-dwelling mutants. The show excels at world-building and has received critical acclaim for its diversity and LGBTQ+ representation.\n\nNaruto\n\nNaruto explores elemental powers like Avatar: The Last Airbender but includes a unique ninja twist. In Naruto, many individuals have a natural affinity for the five Chakra natures: fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. Viewers will find a protagonist similar to Aang in Naruto Uzumaki, as he boasts the rarest Wind Release powers and strives to become a great leader in his village.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians' exploration of the offspring of Greek gods means there is plenty of exploration of children with the power to manipulate elements like water, lightning, or plants. However, the show is most like Avatar: The Last Airbender in its story of a boy burdened with prophecies that he will save the world but who finds support and lifelong friendships on his journey.\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power is a reboot of the 1985 series She-Ra: Princess of Power. It follows She-Ra (Aimee Carrero), a young girl who joins the Rebellion to stop the evil tyrant Hordak (Keston John) from conquering the world. Like Avatar: The Last Airbender, it’s notable for its diversity and for tackling mature themes about corruption and imperialism.\n\nThe Dragon Prince\n\nThe Dragon Prince is created by Aaron Ehasz and Justin Richmond, who both worked as executive producers on Avatar: The Last Airbender. The show follows three children whose protection of the titular Dragon Prince is vital to restoring peace to the world. Its beautiful animation and deep dive into a world at war and steeped in magic derived from nature make it feel like a spiritual successor to Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nThe Owl House\n\nThe Owl House follows Luz Noceda (Sarah-Nicole Robles), a teenage girl whose life changes when she stumbles into the Demon Realm and begins pursuing her dream of becoming a witch. It has received high critical acclaim for its outstanding LGBTQ+ representation. In addition to its diversity, it boasts the same carefully crafted critique of colonialism as Avatar: The Last Airbender as well as the “found family” aspect.\n\nXiaolin Showdown\n\nSimilar to Avatar: The Last Airbender, Xiaolin Showdown is heavily influenced by Asian culture and examines a world filled with magic and martial arts. The show follows four young monks, Omi (Tara Strong), Kimiko (Grey DeLisle), Raimundo (Tom Kenny), and Clay (Jeff Bennett), as they search the globe for magical artifacts that will help maintain balance in the world. Xiaolin Showdown will especially appeal to viewers who enjoyed the epic fight scenes in Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nWhere to watch shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where these 10 TV shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender are streaming in the United States!\n\nA unique Alien race, gorgeous planets, underlying messages about real-world problems, and fighting for good – these all helped make Avatar and its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water not just successful movies, but two of the highest-grossing movies of all time. In fact, Avatar is the highest-grossing movie ever, with The Way of Water taking the #3 spot at the time of writing.\n\nIf you loved the Avatar movies and are looking for other films with a similar vibe and style, check out our guide below to find out where you can stream the best movies like Avatar online right now!\n\nPocahontas\n\nIn a nutshell, the first Avatar movie is basically Disney’s Pocahontas on a different planet – A group of settlers arrive in a new world and cautiously befriend the natives…all while secretly plotting to take their land and resources. There’s a reason Avatar was often called “Pocahontas in space”. But with great music, stunning colors, and a real message about humanity, Disney’s Pocahontas is a great movie, so Avatar should wear that title as a badge of honor.\n\nThe Time Machine\n\nIn The Time Machine, an inventor goes so far forward in time that he watches society crumble and later rebuild, with a new race of forest-dwelling humans called Eloi now inhabiting the Earth’s surface. Fans will definitely notice a similar visual style and vibe between the Eloi and the Na’vi from Avatar.\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire\n\nOne of the closest movies to Avatar is Disney’s Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Set in the 1910s with an awesome steampunk and Jules Verne aesthetic, the movie follows an expedition under the sea to uncover the lost city of Atlantis. Once there, they meet the Atlantians who harness an incredible power thanks to their symbiotic relationship with their environment. As always…the visitors then become invaders when it’s revealed they actually came for resources and treasures.\n\nDistrict 9\n\nOne of the themes Avatar touches on is the way that humans don’t value the Na’vi or their land because they’re perceived as the “other” and thus not worthy of any rights. Taking this idea to the extreme was District 9, where an alien race is held captive in South African internment camps. The movie was heavily inspired by the apartheid and if you loved Avatar’s underlying messages, you will appreciate the way District 9 comments on race, colonialism, and the abuse of civil liberties.\n\nStar Wars: Return of the Jedi\n\nIn Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, the Empire has invaded the remote moon of Endor to build a shield generator – taking over the Ewoks’ home planet and destroying the environment in the process. Luckily, the Rebellion teams up with the Ewoks to reclaim their planet and save the galaxy. Just like the Na’vi must save their planet from humans, viewers will find lots of similarities in the Battle of Endor.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nAt its core, Avatar is a first-contact film, where humans work to navigate their encounter with the Na’vi. For one of the most iconic first-contact movies ever, you need to watch Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The movie is suspenseful, but compelling, and even kind of scary because for much of the film, the audience is left unaware of the aliens’ intentions. There’s a reason it was nominated for 9 Oscars.\n\nFernGully: The Last Rainforest\n\nIn FernGully, a group of fairies and woodland creatures are suddenly disturbed by loggers who have come to chop down the rainforest. You can probably already see how this is similar to Avatar, and being an animated movie, it’s also loaded with lush colors and a great larger-than-life rainforest setting, making it feel even more similar to James Cameron’s epic films.\n\nThe Fountain\n\nJust as humans arrive on Pandora in search of “unobtanium” in Avatar, The Fountain tells of humanity’s search for The Tree of Life, echoing the way Europeans used to believe the Fountain of Youth was hidden somewhere in the Americas. Like the humans in Avatar, who are desperate for power and resources, The Fountain tells of the search for something even greater: Immortality.\n\nTarzan\n\nIn a lot of ways, Tarzan is kind of like the Na’vi in Avatar. He’s grown up living with nature, utilizing it as his home, instead of just as a place that can be mined and logged. When he finally makes human contact, many of the same scenarios in Avatar happen, and the movie ultimately asks who is the true savage – the person living with nature, or the people who wish to destroy it.\n\nStrange World\n\nIf you loved Avatar for its stunning colors and exotic planetary landscape, you’ll love Strange World. Heavily inspired by Journey to the Center of the Earth, the movie follows a family who must search for a new energy source… but in the process, they learn about the fragile balance that holds the environment in equilibrium. It’s a great and colorful adventure that has sadly and unfairly been overlooked.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Avatar online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where all these movies like Avatar are streaming online in the United States!\n\nDo you love the Transformers franchise and are looking for movies with similar vibes? Or maybe you’re just looking for more films with some giant robot action? Well, you’re in luck because we’ve got some movies that are perfect for Transformers fans, and they’re all available to stream and rent online.\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where you can watch movies like Transformers streaming online right now using platforms like Netflix, Paramount+ and more!\n\nPacific Rim\n\nIf you love Transformers for its giant robots, you’ll love Pacific Rim. In the movie, giant monsters (kaijus) rise up from the ocean and begin destroying the world. To fight back, humans build giant 10-story battle mechs known as Jaegers. Come for the giant mechs and stay for the epic action.\n\nPower Rangers\n\nIt’s morphin’ time! In the 2017 reboot of Power Rangers, the gang has to once again defeat the evil Rita Repulsa (this time played by Elizabeth Banks). Obviously, it wouldn’t be Power Rangers without a bit of morphin’ – and just like classic series, the Rangers combine their zords to create Megazord. It’s totally cheesy, but also super nostalgic, making it tons of fun.\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nOne of the most iconic scenes in Star Wars history (hell, in cinematic history as a whole) is the epic battle of Hoth. And what’s the main reason the scene is so damn cool and iconic? The AT-AT Imperial Walkers. The giant, hulking robotic war tanks that look like some kind of iron-plated mastodon are easily one of the coolest parts of the entire Star Wars universe. You can also check out Return of the Jedi for the Battle of Endor which features the smaller, bipedal “Chicken Walker” AT-STs.\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong\n\nIf you love the giant robot battles in Transformers, you’ll probably love the entire MonsterVerse franchise thanks to its giant monster madness. But if you want a robotic addition to the franchise, check out Godzilla vs. Kong, which reintroduced audiences to Mechagodzilla – a giant robotic kaiju designed to kill the others and reign supreme.\n\nCube\n\nOne of the coolest parts of Transformers is obviously the transforming. For a film that’s radically different, but with a cool transforming plotline, check out Cube. In the movie, a group of strangers wakes up trapped inside a giant mechanical cube that’s made of smaller ever-shifting cubes. As the cube constantly transforms its layout, the group must fight to escape.\n\nA-X-L\n\nA big part of Transformers is the bond that forms between the Autobots and the humans, especially in the original three films and the prequel Bumblebee. For a similar vibe, check out A-X-L, where a young guy finds a military-created robotic dog designed to be the ultimate weapon. But as the two become friends, they realize that A-X-L doesn’t need to be a killing machine and could be a useful resource and friend to the right owner.\n\nAtlas\n\nA perfect fit for fans of Transformers or Titinfall, Netflix’s Atlas sees J-Lo piloting a giant mech across an alien planet to save humanity. If you’re looking for a movie full of giant robot shenanigans (and a whole lotta’ Jenny from the Block), Atlas is a must-watch.\n\nReal Steel\n\nIf you watch Transformers to see robots fight each other, then you’ll love Real Steel… a movie starring Hugh Jackman that’s literally about boxing robots. The film currently has two potential continuations, with a planned sequel and an upcoming television series in the early stages of development. So fans can expect a lot more robot punches to come.\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\n\n2008’s The Day the Earth Stood Still is an adaptation of the 1951 film of the same name that was an adaptation of the 1940 short story, Farewell to the Master. In the movie, aliens come to Earth and are protected by a giant mechanical defender known as Gort (Genetically Organized Robotic Technology). Since it’s a classic sci-fi tale, all genre fans should watch the movie at least once.\n\nUltraman: Rising\n\nThe classic Ultraman series got a fun twist with Ultraman: Rising. In the movie, Ken can morph into the towering and iconic Ultraman… but this time he’s tasked with raising a baby kaiju. It’s a fun, lighthearted, and family-friendly monster movie that everyone will love.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Transformers online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where all these movies like Transformers are streaming online in the United States!\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is one of the most successful film franchises of all time, and with a sixth installment on the way, viewers may be interested in additional movies that take them to the sea.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean series follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on their daring nautical adventures, which have featured additional characters like Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).\n\nIf you loved the energetic, swashbuckling premise of Pirates of the Caribbean and its unique characters, here are 10 more great movies about pirates and sea adventures that you can stream today on platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and more!\n\nA Hijacking\n\nA Hijacking has a more serious tone than Pirates of the Caribbean and is set in the present day instead of the Golden Age of Piracy. However, it's an intense action movie for those interested in modern-day piracy, following a Danish merchant ship taken hostage by pirates. The film is both a pirate action movie and an adrenaline-pumping hostage story set against the beautiful backdrop of the ocean.\n\nCaptain Blood\n\nCaptain Blood premiered in 1935 and was one of several films that helped revive the swashbuckler genre. The film follows Peter Blood (Errol Flynn), a doctor imprisoned for completing his medical duties, who escapes and begins a new life of high-seas piracy. It boasts the same spirit and energy as Pirates of the Caribbean and is a must-see swashbuckling classic.\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nTom Hanks portrays the titular character in Captain Phillips, who is tasked with keeping his crew safe when his merchant ship is taken hostage by Somali pirates. The film earned high critical acclaim for its powerful and highly suspenseful tale based on a true story. It has a far more serious and mature tone than Pirates of the Caribbean but is the closest one can get to learning the exhilarating true story of modern-day pirates.\n\nHook\n\nHook is both a pirate adventure and a unique take on the classic tale of Peter Pan. In the movie, an adult Pan (Robin Williams) is forced to return to Neverland to save his kidnapped children from the pirate Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman). With a pirate as iconic as Jack Sparrow and a swashbuckling tale with a fairy twist, Hook is a solid alternative to Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea\n\nLike Pirates of the Caribbean, In the Heart of the Sea is a riveting nautical adventure focusing heavily on sea creatures. Based on the event that inspired Moby Dick, the film follows the Essex, a whaling ship helmed by Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth), as it's pursued by a vengeful whale. In the Heart of the Sea is perfect for viewers who especially loved the heart-stopping sea monster attacks in Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nJungle Cruise\n\nJungle Cruise isn’t a pirate or sea story, but it gives Pirates of the Caribbean a run for its money as the most swashbuckling tale in modern Hollywood. The film follows Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) and Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) as they journey down the Amazon in search of the Tree of Life. Similar to Pirates of the Caribbean, it boasts a larger-than-life adventure paralleled by few in energy and spirit.\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\nFor viewers who want a more accurate and detailed depiction of sailing than the Pirates of the Caribbean, Master and Commander is the way to go. The movie follows Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) of the Royal Navy, who is tasked with capturing a French vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. It’s a suspenseful sea adventure that also packs in quite a lot of history and insight into sailing.\n\nPeter Pan & Wendy\n\nLike Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pan and Wendy offers the perfect mixture of piracy and fantasy. It’s a mesmerizing reimagining of the tale of Peter Pan, and Jude Law shines as Captain Hook. With imagination, heart, and adventure, it’s a more kid-friendly alternative to Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Goonies\n\nThe Goonies is a pirate adventure from the imaginative and innocent perspective of children. When a group of young friends find a map leading to a buried pirate treasure, they embark on an adventure that soon brings them aboard a real pirate ship. It’s a kid-friendly version of Pirates of the Caribbean that centers more on heart and spirit than pirate references.\n\nThe Sea Hawk\n\nThe Sea Hawk is a must-see for Pirates of the Caribbean fans, as it's considered one of the greatest maritime adventure movies in cinematic history. The movie follows privateer George Thorpe (Errol Flynn), who serves his country by looting Spanish ships.

Given its enduring legacy, movies and TV shows about the Roman Empire and ancient Rome have fascinated viewers for decades. Hence, Ridley Scott’s upcoming Gladiator II and the new epic Those About to Die series have sparked much excitement.\n\nIf Those About to Die leaves you seeking more of Ancient Rome before Gladiator II, this guide will reveal the 30 best movies and TV shows on the Roman Empire you can stream right now on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, and more!\n\nOne of the movies that most frequently comes to mind regarding the Roman Empire is the original Gladiator. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film follows Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe), a man who becomes a skilled gladiator on his mission of vengeance. Gladiator delves deep into one of the most intriguing aspects of ancient Rome while capturing the galore of the Roman Empire through breathtaking cinematography, leading it to critical acclaim.\n\nSome of the best movies on the Roman Empire are much older than Gladiator, though, such as Ben-Hur (1959), Quo Vadis, and Spartacus (1960). Both religious epics Ben-Hur and Quo Vadis were released in the 1950s, making their enormous scale and innovative filmmaking techniques all the more impressive. Ben-Hur boasts one of the most iconic film sequences of all time with its chariot race, while Quo Vadis delves into the infamous reign of Nero. Meanwhile, Stanley Kubrick’s critically acclaimed Spartacus delves into the slave revolts that comprise the Servile Wars. Viewers may also enjoy The Fall of the Roman Empire, which many consider the 1964 version of Gladiator.\n\nSince Egypt was once a province of the Roman Empire, unique films like Cleopatra (1963) and Agora blend Egyptian and Roman history. A few filmmakers have gotten even more creative with Ancient Rome by tackling history through comedies like A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum and Monty Python's Life of Brian. Life of Brian is considered one of the greatest comedies of all time, as it explores a young man born in Ancient Rome who is mistaken to be the Messiah.\n\nViewers looking for a more expansive exploration of Ancient Rome may prefer TV shows to film epics. The Spartacus TV show offers a more detailed look into the slave revolts against Rome, while docuseries like Roman Empire provide a more accurate deep dive into figures like Commodus and Julius Caesar. Rome is one of the most large-scale TV shows to delve into Rome’s transition from a Republic to an Empire, and Barbarians is a strong choice for those looking for a bloody historical series.\n\nWhere to watch movies and TV shows about the Roman Empire online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to watch 30 of the best movies and TV shows about the Roman Empire!\n\nWith the release of Twisters, disaster movies are back in the spotlight, and why shouldn’t they be? Nothing says summer blockbuster quite like a giant disaster bringing out the hero in us all as we venture through seemingly unbeatable challenges and have wild adventures.\n\nIf you loved the new Twisters movie, here are 10 other films you’re sure to love. Best of all, they’re all streaming right now. Check out our guide below to discover 10 movies like Twisters and where to watch them!\n\nTwister\n\nIf you loved Twisters, you’ll obviously love the film that started it all, Twister. The movie follows dueling storm-chasing teams and centers around one very unlucky region of Oklahoma that is walloped by numerous tornadoes (including a massive F5) in the span of a few days. It also gave birth to the hilariously famous flying cow.\n\nThe Impossible\n\nSometimes fact is stranger than fiction, and no amount of drama and action from Twisters can compare to 2012’s The Impossible. The film centers around a real family who were vacationing at an oceanfront resort in Thailand when the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami occurred. The family got separated and was forced to fight for their lives in one of the worst natural disasters in history. Naomi Watts even received an Oscar nomination for her role in the movie.\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure\n\nIn The Poseidon Adventure, a tsunami causes a massive wave to crash into an ocean liner, tipping it upside down. As the ship slowly begins to sink, the passengers and crew inside are forced to race to the bowels of the ship (which are now above water) to escape. The Poseidon Adventure was a massive hit, scoring 9 Oscar nominations in 1973.\n\nSkyscraper\n\nHong Kong’s newest skyscraper is the tallest building in the world, standing 240 stories tall. Unfortunately, criminals are targeting the building and have set the 96th floor on fire, trapping everyone on the floors above in a towering inferno. Skyscraper starred The Rock and is certainly on the more wild and bombastic side, but sometimes that type of movie is exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow\n\n2004’s The Day After Tomorrow not only revived the disaster movie genre, but it was also one of the first mainstream movies to put climate change in the spotlight and show viewers the potential consequences of our actions. Though not scientifically accurate, the movie depicts what happens after climate change tips the scales and thrusts Earth into another Ice Age.\n\nVolcano\n\nIn Volcano, Los Angeles’ very real LaBrea Tar Pits are revealed to not be tar pits at all… but instead are the seepings of a previously undiscovered underground volcano. Sadly for the City of Angels, that volcano decides to finally erupt and destroy the metropolis. The premise is wild and silly, but it’s tons of fun. How could you not love a movie about a giant volcano suddenly bursting beneath America’s second-largest city?\n\nGeostorm\n\nCan’t decide which natural disaster you’re craving? Then check out Geostorm, which has them all! In the movie, a weather-controlling satellite is cyber-attacked, causing massive storms to destroy cities across the globe. From hail to lightning, tornadoes, squalls, tsunamis, and more, the entire planet must survive a variety of storms, each deadlier than the last.\n\nSharknado\n\nIf you’re craving more movies about tornadoes, why not check out Sharknado? In the movie, a hurricane and a series of tornadoes (totally unrealistic) pick up a bunch of sharks from the ocean (super unrealistic) and then drops them – still alive – onto the city of LA (unbearably unrealistic). The acting is horrible, the CGI is horrible, and the premise is absurd. But Sharknado is so bad you can’t stop watching. It’s like a trainwreck. A trainwreck filled with sharks. You’ll want to turn the movie off, but it’s so asinine that you won’t be able to. It’s simply too bad to be ignored.\n\n2012\n\nRemember the hype over the Aztec calendar? Or was it the Mayan calendar? I can’t even remember anymore, but back in 2012 the hysteria was so strong that some people literally ventured to mountaintops and pyramids to await the apocalypse. The movie 2012 capitalized on this fear by showing the world getting destroyed by a series of natural disasters… in the year 2012, with only a chosen few being saved by giant “arks”.\n\nInto the Storm\n\nInto the Storm very much feels like a spiritual sequel to Twister. The movie takes place in a small Oklahoma town where a cluster of tornadoes have touched down, creating the largest storm in the state’s history. There’s also fire tornadoes and even a massive mile-wide F-5 that flattens the town. The hyperactive storm makes the movie feel less believable than Twister, but a bigger storm means more chaos and more destruction…and isn’t that what a disaster movie is all about?\n\nWhere to watch movies like Twisters online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where all these movies like Twisters are streaming online in the United States!\n\nGlen Powell is one of the fastest-rising actors in Hollywood ever since his breakthrough role in Top Gun: Maverick. While some may think he’s an overnight sensation, he has been active in the industry for over 20 years and has starred in many hidden gems before the Top Gun sequel.

Not only does Powell shine as Lieutenant Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin, who strongly parallels a young Maverick Mitchell (Tom Cruise), but the movie also surpasses the original with its stronger storyline and breathtaking aerial cinematography.\n\nSince then, Glen Powell has proven he’s a leading man with Anyone But You and Hit Man. In Anyone but You, Powell and Sydney Sweeney mesmerize viewers as Ben and Bea, a couple whose electric connection with one another sours. Despite their ill feelings towards one another, they’re forced to vacation together in Sydney, Australia, to support their friends’ marriage. The film was a box office hit due to its raunchy rom-com premise and the palpable chemistry between Powell and Sweeney.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hit Man, Glen Powell portrays Gary Johnson, who poses as a hitman to catch those conspiring to commit murders. He truly shows his acting prowess by taking on numerous identities, accents, personalities, and disguises for the film. Although Anyone but You and Hit Man received the most fanfare, Powell also recently starred in the highly-rated Devotion and The Blue Angels.\n\nHowever, not all of Glen Powell’s best movies are new. One of his best pre-Top Gun: Maverick films is the 2018 rom-com Set It Up. In this movie, Powell takes on the role of matchmaker Charlie Young, who conspires with Harper Moore (Zoey Deutch) to set their bosses up so they can get some much-needed time off. Once again, Powell's chemistry with his co-star is wonderful, and the movie is a lighthearted and enjoyable rom-com.\n\nPowell also has a small role in the powerful biographical movie Hidden Figures, which highlights the contributions of three incredible women who helped win the space race.\n\nWhere to watch the best Glen Powell movies online\n\nCheck out our guide below to find the 10 best Glen Powell movies, ranked by Powell’s performance and the quality of the movie, and where to stream them!\n\nStranger Things is gearing up for its fifth and final season. The show became one of Netflix’s most-watched series of all time due to its unique blend of sci-fi and ‘80s vibes, which has drawn nostalgic comparisons to movies like E.T. and Stand By Me.\n\nIf you’re looking for more shows with retro charm, youthful characters, and quality sci-fi stories, this guide will reveal 10 more great TV shows like Stranger Things you can stream today on platforms like Netflix, Max, Prime Video, and more!\n\nCobra Kai\n\nCobra Kai isn’t set in the ‘80s, but its predecessor, The Karate Kid, was. As a result, the ‘80s nostalgia is almost as strong as in Stranger Things, with numerous references to ‘80s movies, cars, music, and more. Additionally, its story of a group of teens who join karate dojos and become involved in feuds and town secrets is almost as intriguing as Stranger Things, even without the supernatural elements.\n\nDark\n\nDark boasts several similarities to Stranger Things, especially since it is set in a fictional town where several teenagers begin investigating the disappearances of children. Although the show initially takes place in the present day, season 2 is set in the ‘80s. However, Dark also distinguishes itself from Stranger Things by delving into time travel rather than alternate dimensions and featuring more mature themes and content.\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nDead Boy Detective is set in the present day, but Charles Rowland (Jayden Revri), the ghost of a teenage boy who died in 1989, brings in some ‘80s vibes. With 1980s vibes, teen detectives, and plenty of grisly stories about demons and ghosts, Dead Boy Detectives will appeal to viewers who especially enjoyed the horror elements of Stranger Things season 4.\n\nDeadly Class\n\nSet in the 1980s, Deadly Class follows the adventures of Marcus (Benjamin Wadsworth), a"
