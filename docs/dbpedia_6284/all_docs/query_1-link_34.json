        "text": "Scientific research in film\n\nIn Pasteur, Arrowsmith, and Ehrlich, careful framing and misè-en-scène construct a fantastic space filled with laboratory paraphernalia that not only creates a spectacle of modern technology but also places the films within the familiar printed images of famous scientists. Because of the importance of scientific research to the new practice of medicine, the setting of the laboratory became a principle feature of the image of modern medical researchers and their breakthroughs (Hansen 2009, 258-259). In contrast, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde uses filmic techniques to demonstrate mad scientists as turning away from the rigor of modern science and, instead, embracing the mystery of the natural world. The microscope especially represented modern medicine as a symbol of technology that helped to demystify the body and aid diagnosis and ultimately became a symbol that defined physicians as a unique group distinct from the rest of society (Turow 1989, 5). Given the importance of laboratory glassware and the microscope as icons of science and medicine, they appear prominently in all of the films. This iconography is rapidly established in Pasteur, Ehrlich, and Arrowsmith. In all three films, during the opening credits, the first shot of the film is of glassware or paraphernalia. While they certainly act as convenient backgrounds, they also serve to place immediately the audience in the laboratory, within the setting of the modern physician, and to emphasize the importance of the laboratory and research to their image. The glassware is shown in a close-up shot, so it appears larger than life, again emphasizing its importance. This method of display is unique to film. Such a close-up shot is not possible in theater, nor would the bubbling of the flasks in Arrowsmith and Pasteur and the pouring of solutions in Ehrlich be appreciated in a printed image. The dynamic nature of the images also suggests that lab work continues and is not stagnant.\n\nWhile these techniques established Pasteur, Ehrlich, and Arrowsmith as being firmly rooted in science, in Dr. Jekyll, the icons of science are, often literally, blurred. Rather than opening on glassware, the film opens with an establishing shot on the church. When the laboratory is finally shown, rather than depicting glassware, it opens on shots of dead lab animals. The natural world, including death, is shot to dominate the laboratory. Far from the well-staffed laboratories of the other films, Dr. Jekyll’s laboratory has no assistants and is instead punctuated by gothic arches and architecture. Indeed, this spooky depiction of the laboratory has previously been appreciated, as the author Dr. Lilian Furst was described as explaining: “home laboratories as Dr. Jekyll’s were becoming a rarity in the latter 19th century, as research was organized into a group activity; this fact heightens the eeriness of the novel” (paraphrased in Alpert and Mathiasen 2011). Consider, for example, that in the other films, Drs. Pasteur and Ehrlich had laboratory assistants, and Dr. Arrowsmith worked in a large research institution, a great contrast from the lone scientist hidden away in a gothic space.\n\nJekyll’s denial of modern research science is also evident in the film’s use of microscopes and glassware. While a microscope does appear in the laboratory on several occasions, in contrast to the other three films, it appears in the same frame as Dr. Jekyll only one time when he is instead looking at Ivy’s girdle. He quite literally avoids the symbols of science for a much baser interest. Furthermore, while glassware does appear in the laboratory of Dr. Jekyll, it is often out of focus, behind other barriers (such as windows), or framed separately from Dr. Jekyll. For example, while in the laboratory contemplating the self-administrating of the elixir to transform into Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll sits in a chair facing away from the flasks and bottles of the laboratory. The scene is framed such that his head is bordered by the chair, and the laboratory equipment is outside the image of the chair, in a separate space. The lack of detail of the glassware in the laboratory not only separates the monster of the mad scientist from the growing image of the physician-scientist-hero but also helps build the horror of the man. As Toumey notes, “[…] mad scientists stories, as exercises in anti-rationalism, must challenge the belief that just because the stuff is scientific, it must be valuable. Yet they cannot claim that the equipment itself is evil, for anti-rationalism, especially Gothic horror, locates evil in the heart of man or in nature itself’ (1992, 414). Thus, the intentionally vague depictions of the scientific paraphernalia subvert the argument that science may be evil and, instead, places blame onto the nature of man. This distinction is essential for the definition of the mad scientist as separate from the medical researcher hero and correspondingly, that modern science itself is not ‘mad.’ Dr. Jekyll continues this denial of science more intentionally with an early close up shot of a laboratory bottle being broken. Breaking glass, albeit often of windows rather than laboratory equipment, becomes a prominent action through the film as Dr. Jekyll loses control of Mr. Hyde. The close up shot of breaking laboratory glassware early in the film is paralleled later, suggesting additional “breaks” with science through these similar shots.\n\nCareful camera movements also help to construct the film space itself as ‘scientific’ or uncivilized. Arrowsmith’s opening shot tracks through some of the glassware, thereby emphasizing the space and placing the audience within it, while Ehrlich’s opening cuts between various silhouettes of lab glassware being used, emphasizing the myriad of tools available. A long tracking shot in the middle of Pasteur best exemplifies this creation of the space of the laboratory. Forty minutes into the film, Pasteur is searching for the microbe that causes rabies. The camera opens on a shot of his assistant who must find Pasteur to tell him some news. Rather than immediately cut to a shot of Pasteur with the assistant entering the frame, as would be the fastest method to advance the scene, Dieterle decided to follow the assistant through the laboratory until ultimately reaching Pasteur in the back corner. The tracking shot lasts a total of thirty-two seconds, considerably longer than the shots immediately preceding and following, emphasizing its importance as a tool to impart the importance of the laboratory. While tracking through the lab, the viewer passes by numerous benches with other scientists looking through microscopes, filtering solutions, and otherwise working in the laboratory. With the long journey through the space of the lab, as well as the extended length of the shot, the laboratory space is greatly expanded, and the laboratory paraphernalia put on display. Thus, film establishes an image of the laboratory space in a manner consistent with the contemporary images of the laboratory but in such a way that is unique to film.\n\nIn other instances, the depictions of laboratories clearly recapitulate the descriptions first established by de Kruif. These parallels are best illustrated in Ehrlich with the depiction of his laboratory. In Microbe Hunters, Ehrlich’s “crammed and topsy-turvy laboratory” explodes with an “entire array of gleaming and glittering and shimmering dyes” in “ranks and ranks of bottles” (de Kruif 1926, 338-348). De Kruif’s description makes the reader almost scared to move for fear of knocking over such a precarious assortment, since his words contain such detailed and vivid imagery. The power of description to overwhelm the audience in the face of modern scientific determination appears in the film, Ehrlich, as well. Nearly an hour into the movie, Ehrlich finally has his own lab and is working toward more magic bullets. An establishing shot places the viewer inside his lab. While it is clear that Ehrlich is the person wearing the white coat, it is remarkable that, for a film about a particular person, he is not prominent within the establishing shot and relegated to a corner of the screen. Importantly, his figure appears smaller in opposition to the large bookcase stacked with glass bottles filled with fluid. This construction reinforces the prominence of the glassware within the film and the laboratory as part of the persona of the modern medical researcher. Interestingly, the window centers the image, bringing the natural world inside the laboratory, a poetic description of the motivation of basic science research. Critically, the natural world is part of the laboratory, not a replacement for it, as is seen in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The placement of stacks of paper in the foreground and around the room also establishes the space within the scene, providing depth to the image, thereby, enlarging the virtual space of the laboratory and making it more impressive. Thus, elements such as framing and editing expand on De Kurif’s words and images to espouse the grandeur and importance of science and the researcher hero.\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, however, uses similar film techniques to associate Dr. Jekyll with the darkness of the natural word, rather than the rising star of research-based medicine. Fifteen minutes into the film, Dr. Jekyll dances with his fiancé. The camera tracks them as they waltz from the house into the garden, cutting as they pass from the inside to the dark, natural space of the garden. The camera continues to follow them at a far distance and for a long take, thereby amplifying the natural space as they move through it. The camera soon switches to a medium distance, showing the two talking and, soon, kissing—a representation of the ‘dark’ urges of Dr. Jekyll, well before the audience meets Mr. Hyde. These hints at the desires of Dr. Jekyll form the core of the moral messages of the darkness of Hyde, as noted by the theologian Larry Kreitzer in his article comparing Stevenson’s story to the New Testament (1992, 135). Notably, far from being a sunny, bright garden, it is always a dark, foreboding place with large shadows. The association of Dr. Jekyll with the natural world, rather than within the civilized laboratory, is amplified by careful framing. While in the garden and speaking with his fiancé, Dr. Jekyll is surrounded by plants, both in the background and foreground. While his fiancé is placed in the same space, she does not have as large of plants in the foreground, so she is less embedded/at home in the natural world than Dr. Jekyll. Additionally, later in the same scene, Dr. Jekyll is speaking with the father of his fiancé. While shot at a medium distance such that both men are in the frame at the same time, a post boldly divides the frame between the two men. Furthermore, a gentle arch from the background places the ‘civilized’ father within the developed space defined by the classical architecture, while Dr. Jekyll remains separate, in the unrefined natural world. The importance of this earlier scene is reinforced at the end of the film, when Mr. Hyde assaults his fiancé and kills her father, both in the darkness of the garden. Additionally, at the start of this scene, prior to the transformation into Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll tries to speak with his fiancé. This far into the film, as Dr. Jekyll’s fate is sealed, he only stays in the garden, no longer passing into the house. Dr. Jekyll’s association with the darkness of the natural world is also seen in perhaps the most dramatic shots of the film when Dr. Jekyll strolls through a park on the way to an engagement party as well as when Mr. Hyde races through the city following his murder of another woman. In both of these scenes, the man is overwhelmed by the natural space, again at night. Dr. Jekyll disappears into the mist as he walks away from the camera, while Mr. Hyde threatens the audience, emerging from the dark and running toward the camera. Dr. Jekyll is poetically lost in the natural world, emerging as a monster. It is the natural world that defines Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, a sharp contrast from the emphasis on the laboratory space of Drs. Ehrlich, Pasteur, and Arrowsmith. By defining the ill-fated Dr. Jekyll as someone tied to the natural world rather than science, he is similar to a literary foil, providing a contrast to the protagonists of the physician-hero construction, thereby making their achievements and values increasingly remarkable and important.\n\nThe use of popular images of science and medicine as a starting point for the representation of research in medicine continued with Microbe Hunters and other media such as paintings. The image of Pasteur became one of the earliest archetypes of the modern medical researcher (Hansen 2009, 80-82). In 1885, the Finnish artist Albert Edelfelt painted an image of Pasteur in his laboratory. Hansen argues that the unique aspects of the painting include its depiction of a doctor at work in a heroic manner, an aura of contemplation focused on the results of his latest experiment, and a twinge of humility at the power to heal with the vial in his hand (2009, 82). Additionally, Hansen describes the importance of the “faraway look” as a scientist contemplates the great unknowns of nature (150). This characteristic image of a scientist in the laboratory considering the great mysteries of life became more than just an image of a great scientist, but, also, the iconography of “heroic scientific discovery” (169-170). In fact, it became so well established within the public’s consciousness, Hansen claims, that the image of a scientist in the lab holding a vial represented all of heroic medical progress (259). It is not surprising, then, that the film The Story of Louis Pasteur recreated this image within the film. This shot illustrates Pasteur as he began to develop his idea of a gradual inoculation of attenuated rabies vims to induce immunity to the full-strength vims. The viewer sees the laboratory space behind him, which has also been established through the preceding shots as he runs through his laboratory, excited with his new idea. He is focused on the vial containing the attenuated vims, while his assistants look to him for guidance. Importantly, they are not the ones looking at the vial, since, as Edelfelt’s painting established, only the medical researcher hero appreciates the power of what the vial holds.\n\nIf, as Hansen suggests, Edelfelt’s image of Pasteur became a universal symbol of heroic medical researchers than it should be found in other films as well. Indeed, both Ehrlich and Arrowsmith also recreate Edelfelt’s iconography. In Arrowsmith, Dr. Arrowsmith studies a bacterial culture in the familiar setting of the laboratory. Again, his wife looks to him, not the vial, since he is the heroic medical researcher in this image, and she may not grasp the magnitude of the discovery. The vial holds the key to one of his first discoveries in the film, which is heralded as a cure to all disease. While the discovery ends up being less novel than originally thought, it still marks a milestone in the film and the fictional Arrowsmith’s career. Ehrlich contains perhaps the most literal reproduction of Edelfelt’s portrait. Again, Dr. Ehrlich’s laboratory coat, the glass bottles in the back, and the flame in the foreground establish the setting of the laboratory. The glasses and beard of Ehrlich look remarkably similar to Pasteur’s in Edelfelt’s painting, and he focuses on a vial and its contents with the same contemplative intensity as Pasteur in Edelfelt’s work.\n\nIf the Edelfelt’s image is essential for defining the rising physician hero, then it follows that this imagery must be corrupted in the setting of a mad scientist to separate the terror of this personality from the hope of the new image. Indeed, in Dr. Jekyll, near the end of the film, Mr. Hyde produces an elixir that he drinks to return to Dr. Jekyll, all under the watchful eye of Dr. Jekyll’s friend. The image of Mr. Hyde mixing, then drinking, the elixir is reminiscent of Edelfelt’s portrait, as the man holds the glass container in his hand, staring intently at the contents. However, in contrast to the other depictions, the scene is shot as a close up. In the other images, the scientist is seen within his lab, but the framing in the shot in Dr. Jekyll is so tight that only vague shapes of black are visible around Mr. Hyde. Not only does this imagery continue to separate the mad scientist from modern science by excluding the laboratory space around him, but the close up shot also emphasizes the madness of Mr. Hyde: the hair is wild, his eyes fixated on the elixir, and his jaw thrust forward to reveal his teeth. The wise, elderly man depicted in Edelfelt’s portrait and reproduced in Pasteur, Ehrlich, and Arrowsmith is a far cry from the monster of Mr. Hyde. These careful constructions illustrate the power of the contemporary imagery of medical heroes and their research and the desire by directors to emulate their representation whether to construct the image of the physician hero or disfigure it to separate “witch doctors” from the growing modern institution of medical research (Fleming 1941).\n\nWhile Edelfelt’s painting certainly served as the source of the standard iconography for medical researchers, de Kruif’s Microbe Hunters provided much of the detail on personality and image that appeared in the films. Ehrlich best illustrates this similarity of print and film. De Kruif described Ehrlich as a “‘dynamo” whose “brain was in the grip of dreams” and who devoured books and cigars (1926, 334-343). The image of Ehrlich in the film parallels this image. Following the establishing shot previously discussed, the camera cuts to a medium length shot of Dr. Ehrlich in his laboratory. His eyes are bright and focused, looking at his assistant off screen, with a test tube in one hand and a cigar in the other. Interestingly, a counter shot of his assistant shows him on his knees, picking up sheets of paper off the floor. This angle results in the sensation that Ehrlich is larger than his assistant, thereby instilling a sense of vitality and power. In the background of the image, the familiar stacks of paper balance precariously on a bench. These are the journals and books that de Kruif describes as Ehrlich’s ultimate source of knowledge and genius. The similarity between the images created by de Kruif and those presented by Dieterle’s film of Dr. Ehrlich did not go unnoticed, as de Kruif himself allegedly believed that Warner Brothers had taken his ideas (Lederer and Parascandola 1998, 355-356). Nonetheless, de Kruif’s Microbe Hunters provided a rich source to filmmakers when they sketched the characters within their films.\n\nThus far, we have seen that film accurately translates images of medical research in art and literature to the medium, occasionally embellishing the image with careful use of editing and framing. However, the true power of film in the depiction of modern medical research lays within its ability to show the audience the miracles of modem medicine from the perspective of the hero-researcher and his patients.\n\nThrough the careful use of editing, both Louis Pasteur and Ehrlich construct point of view shots that illustrate the magic of modern science and medicine. The film critic Thomas Elsaesser argues that the spatial construction and continuity in Dieterle’s films differed from the normal Warner Brothers films such that Dieterle’s often appeared as a spectacle to the audience. However, he continues, because this style of framing dominates most of the film, a dramatic climax occurs when the audience no longer views the scene objectively and instead allies with the protagonist (1986, 28). The point of view shot dominates all other camera shots in its ability to ally the audience with a character, since the audience quite literally sees the world through the character’s eyes. In both of Dieterle’s films, the audience “shares the researcher’s view of the hidden microscopic dimension” through the careful use of editing that integrates video of a microscope’s view of microbes into the film (Babington 2005, 124). The ‘wow factor’ of seeing the microscopic organisms on a large movie screen cannot be denied, even today. The spectacle is exhilarating and breathtaking. Dieterle took the point of view shot even further in a spectacular image from Pasteur whereby a picture of microbes is superimposed on a shot of Dr. Pasteur looking through a microscope, which is itself superimposed on an intertitle slide, thereby elevating Pasteur’s fight against microbes above that of the war between France and Prussia during the Franco-Prussian War. This triple exposure places the audiences in three different viewpoints at once: Pasteur’s view of the microbe, a third person view of Pasteur looking into the microscope, and finally a dimension outside of the film, reading the intertitle. This parallelism can only be constructed in the media of film. Through this device, the wizardry of cinema contributes to the magic of medicine, as seen in the ability to study animals that cannot be visualized by the unaided eye. The energy of this complex shot sparkles, even as a still picture, but nearly explodes off the screen during the film. Indeed, it contributes to the aura of magic and builds to a climax of Pasteur’s work with hydrophobia (rabies).\n\nWhile the point of view shots from a microscope create a spectacle of the microscopic world and thereby an aura of awe toward medicine and science, to truly illustrate the miracles of modern medicine, Dieterle uses a point of view shot to bring the audience into the patient’s perspective. Nearly an hour and a half into the film, Dr. Ehrlich tests Salvarsan (arsphenamine/compound 606) in the first human volunteer, a man who suffers from syphilitic blindness. The camera immediately switches to a black screen with voices that seem to be from nurses and the head of the hospital. The voices come and go, asking how the patient is doing each day, which suggests the passage of time. There are also frequent cuts to close-ups of the patient that show him blankly staring off frame. The image slowly begins to lighten as shapes begin to take form. In the end, Dr. Ehrlich walks into frame, well in focus, surrounded by light and standing above the patient. Once the camera cuts away from the point of view shot, the camera rests on the crying patient, for he can see once again. The biblical imagery of making the blind see is not subtle, and the head of the hospital dispels any doubts about this biblical reference by stating that his hospital has “become a place of miracles” (Dieterle 1940; see Hansen 2009, 145). If this scene of healing had been shot in a third person perspective, the power of the transformation from blind to sighted would be much diminished. Thus, through the use of point of view shots, the audience sees what the physician or the patient sees whether it is microbes or the face of Dr. Ehrlich after years of blindness. These techniques and powerful images expand the medical researcher model first established by Edelfelt and de Kruif to new, heroic heights as miracle workers.\n\nRather than allying the audience with the physician hero or depicting the miracles of modern medicine and science, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde uses complex multiple exposures to demonstrate the loss of the good Dr. Jekyll to the basest human instincts manifest in Mr. Hyde. There are no examples of point of view shots in Dr. Jekyll, a stark contrast from some of the most exciting moments in the other films but a decision that is consistent with the goal to define Dr. Jekyll as ‘other’ and keep the audience at a distance from his madness. While there are no point of view shots, there are three separate instances of double or triple exposure montages: one while Dr. Jekyll is developing his elixir, and two separate occasions during the transformation of Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde. The first montage is a fascinating examination of the goals of the film as it is the only example of Dr. Jekyll devotedly working in his lab: he is seen furiously writing in his lab notebook as images of elixirs, animals, and sunsets are superimposed. However, unlike the multiple exposure sequences in the other films, Dr. Jekyll is visibly fatigued, a contrast from the determination seen in other films. While this devotion may initially be seen as a positive attribute, in the context of the mad scientist, it may hint at madness, as Grunzke argued with regards to the original novel: “We know from other film doctors (like Dr. Frankenstein) that over attentiveness to one’s scientific studies (even if they are under the auspices of helping one’s fellow man) is a marker of something potentially dangerous lurking in the heart of the scientist” (2015, 70). The key determinant of whether this devotion should be something of praise or suspicion is how it ends. In Dr. Jekyll, the montage ends with a close up shot of Dr. Jekyll emphatically closing his box containing glass vials and scientific paraphernalia. While he has apparently succeeded in the development of the elixir, he quite literally closes the door on science, just when true experimentation and testing should begin. This premature ‘completion’ of the scientific process again sets Dr. Jekyll as an antithesis to the heroes portrayed in the other films.\n\nWhile the depiction of Dr. Jekyll in his lab developing the elixir represented his ultimate abandonment of the modern scientific process, the montages following his consumption of this elixir dramatically describe his fall into madness with swirling water and mud superimposed on chariots led by galloping horses depicted as Dr. Jekyll’s two love interests. This surreal imagery jumps off the screen not only due to this rapid movement, double exposure, and high contrast but also its jarring subject matter. These scenes were widely understood to represent the release of Dr. Jekyll’s id, to borrow a Freudian term, a concept very contemporary to the release of the film (Kreitzer 1992, 125, 136). The carnal subject matter and rapid editing are intentionally jarring, thereby distancing the audience from Dr. Jekyll. Thus, as opposed to building up the physician hero, the film techniques in Dr. Jekyll act to define him as a man driven by his base, natural instincts, abandoning civilization and the promise of modern, scientific reasoning and processes. By defining the mad scientist as outside the space of the rising star of American medicine, these horror films paradoxically act to reinforce the good of modern science and its capability for its heroes to perform miracles.\n\nMedical researchers and religion\n\nAs medicine became more established in the tradition of science, its depictions began to borrow images and symbols from religion to establish a “temple of science” (Dans 2000, 84). Mass media constructed this temple by equating the miracles of modern science with medical practice (Burnham 1982, 1474). As physicians continued to perform these small miracles, their status in society climbed. The historian John Burnham suggests that physicians performed a new role in society, as “priests” that conducted “medical ceremonies and acted as wise and trusted personages” (1982, 1476). The holy aspirations of physicians in society are not just a product of historical analysis. Dr. Victor Vaughan, the physician discussed previously, again wrote to Science in 1912 where he poetically describes the goals of science to heal sickness, control the elements, and generally improve society (1912, 233). Thus, in Vaughan’s ideals, the goals of modern science and medicine replicated those of popular religion.\n\nThe parallels between modern medicine and religion quickly expanded to symbols in print media as well. Hansen analyzed the depiction of medical research heroes in Life magazine and notes that, by being photographed at a low angle, the viewer must gaze upward at the researcher, “like worshipers gazing at a statue in a church” (2009, 212). Furthermore, in a phenomenon that perhaps first emerged from the iconography of Edelfelt’s portrait, Hansen likens the depiction of scientists in Life to that of saints, who are identified by certain characteristic symbols (254). This visual representation of the scientist carefully equates the hero with sanctity, but to understand how religious symbols appeared in the movies, we must return to de Kruif’s Microbe Hunters, since it provided much of the material for many of the films.\n\nDe Kruif’s descriptions of Pasteur and Ehrlich established images of them as religious figures. De Kruif described Pasteur as a “mystic,” often humbled by nature, as well as Pasteur’s students as apostles, as if Pasteur were a priest (1926, 147, 156). Furthermore, Pasteur’s success at Pouilly-le-Fort, where he successfully demonstrated inoculation against anthrax in sheep, mimicked, according to de Kruif, an act from the Bible that helped convert men to his “faith” (162-163). In his description of the Pouilly-le-Fort experiment, de Kruif includes words such as “consecrate” and “Messiah” (162-164). To complete this holy image, de Kruif summarizes Pasteur’s legacy as “[… a tale] of the crown of thorns that madmen wear whose dream it is to change a world in the little seventy years they are allowed to live” (166). Clearly, the term ‘madmen’ here is meant as term of endearment, describing their devotion given the positive association with religious imagery, rather than the darkness of a mad scientist seen in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In de Kruif’s chapter on Pasteur, these religious images permeate the page, associating him and the rest of the medical community with holy men capable of miracles.\n\nDieterle’s film on Pasteur also contains similar images of religious symbols. Early in the film, Pasteur must leave Paris after antagonizing the old-fashioned French academy and thus, Napoleon III, with his publication blaming physicians and their unwashed hands for patient deaths. While talking to the academy and the emperor, Dr. Pasteur is told he must retract the pamphlet detailing his theories of the spread of disease or fall into displeasure with the emperor. Importantly, Pasteur decides to leave Paris rather than compromise on his beliefs. He, therefore, sacrifices his life in Paris for the greater good. The framing of the scene reinforces this religious message by placing a lit chandelier above his head, and his head only. The flames appear as a crown, perhaps as a halo. In contrast, on the right side of the frame, another chandelier hangs but remains unlit, further reinforcing the importance of the lit chandelier above Pasteur. If one may recall the miracle of curing the blind patient in Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet, one can appreciate how frequently Dieterle, like those before him, used religious imagery in his depiction of modern medical heroes in both Pasteur and Ehrlich.\n\nArrowsmith continues the use of religious symbols to expand the imagery from a holy person to a larger idea of a temple of science. Upon Dr. Martin Arrowsmith’s first introduction to the McGurk Institute, a representation of the modern medical research institution, Martin Arrowsmith’s figure is overwhelmed by the symbols of classical temples (this symbolism was also appreciated in Hansen 2009, 130). On arriving to the twenty-fifth floor of the McGurk Institute, Arrowsmith enters an empty frame from the bottom right. When the shot first opens, it is an empty antechamber with only two busts and a closed door. The door, walls, floor, and pedestals are in the art deco style and accentuated by the high angle shot of the scene, a great contrast to the close-up, bustling shot at the bottom of the elevator immediately prior. The emptiness of the space emphasizes its vastness, while the closed door its exclusivity. Prior to Arrowsmith’s entrance, the light from his elevator illuminates the door of the institute, as if a ‘holy light’ marks the way. As he enters the frame from the right, the enormous doors and high angle scene consume his diminutive figure. Arrowsmith is shrunken by the massive institute around him. A cut to the next shot moves into the large greeting room, as empty as the first shot, with a single desk at the back of the large room. The camera has moved down to eye level and behind Arrowsmith as he walks to the back of the room. From this angle, the ceiling to the room shines, displaying chandeliers that resemble stars within a massive dome as if the temple is open to the sky, like classical atria. Columns line the room, again constructing the image of the classical temple. In the next shot, the camera angle, slightly below shoulder level, amplifies the size of Arrowsmith, thereby restoring his power within the space.\n\nWith Ford’s careful use of camera angles and framing, he constructs a vast temple for the McGurk Institute, an institution of science. After arriving in his laboratory, Arrowsmith completes the scene by reciting a scientist’s prayer in the same construction as the prayer of St. Francis (Dans 2000, 88). Thus, Arrowsmith’s journey takes him from the common area of the lobby through the antechamber and to the altar, the laboratory, where he prays, all within the vast temple of science. With such powerful religious imagery in print and film, one can understand how physicians began to be identified as a new priesthood capable of miracles from their studies in the temple of science.\n\nThat is not to say, however, that modern science and medicine were to replace religion. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde uses religious imagery to demonstrate the danger of the denial of religion and its constructs of morality. While religion plays a prominent role in the narrative, as eloquently discussed in Kreitzger’s comparison of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’s warnings on the nature of man to the comments of St. Paul in his letters to the Romans, religious iconography and filmic techniques were again used to reinforce the message that mad scientists are separated from religion, just as they so effectively described the rising power and miracles of modern science in Ehrlich, Pasteur, and Arrowsmith. For example, the film opens on an establishing shot of a church steeple then cuts to the interior of a grand church. The camera stays focused on the priest as he gives his sermon, but the audience soon hears, off camera, a man shouting about the ‘true nature’ of man. Soon, the film cuts to a medium shot of the back of a man who turns around (presumably to see the man yelling) to reveal Dr. Jekyll. He alone has turned around—all the other parishioners remain facing the front. The framing of this sequence is such that Dr. Jekyll is quite literally turning away from the alter and pulpit, which is visible in the background. Several minutes later, Dr. Jekyll is again seen, speaking with the crazed man, this time in a hallway with a stained-glass window apparently depicting an image of Saint Peter with the traditional symbols of a gray beard, open book, and halo. Dr. Jekyll is carefully framed such that he faces the same way as St. Peter, creating a parallel between the two men. However, critically, in this particular representation of St. Peter, he is not holding the keys to the kingdom of heaven, instead using both hands to open the book. This particular representation of St. Peter focuses on knowledge, not heaven. Of course, we must also consider that St. Peter famously denied Christ during the Passion, only to redeem himself later. This particular representation of Peter, then, suggests a Peter that has not yet been redeemed and is therefore not holding the keys to heaven. The parallel framing with Dr. Jekyll foreshadows a man who will deny religion, the surrogate for morality in this film, in the selfish, destructive pursuit of knowledge—just as Peter cannot hold the keys because his is holding the book. Thus, Dr. Jekyll is again defined as the foil to the physician heroes presented in the other films; instead of being celebrated as saintly and good, the mad scientist is depicted as irredeemable and unholy.\n\nThe damnation of Dr. Jekyll is poetically foreshadowed through additional film techniques. During Dr. Jekyll’s passionate speech to dinner guests about the ability of his research to “separ[ate] the facets of the brain,” not only is Dr. Jekyll framed at the boundary of the image, suggesting his ideas are at the boundary of civilized discourse, but he is flanked in the background by candles, noticeably absent above his head (Fleming 1941). This lack of a halo is inverted to the depiction in Pasteur. Here, a man is explicitly discussing his work and the morality of man, but he lacks any symbol of holiness. In addition to this subtle display of areligiosity, Dr. Jekyll’s decent into evil is reinforced by the descending movements on screen. The vast majority of stairs in the film are traversed down. That is, of the many episodes of people using stairs, only a few have people explicitly walking up them. In these situations, the movement is suggested by a cut from the bottom of the stair to the top. However, when people go down the stairs, the audience nearly always watches them step down. Both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde continually descend the stairs either into the laboratory or into Ivy’s apartment, respectively. Most dramatically, after Mr. Hyde assaults and presumably kills Ivy, Mr. Hyde is seen jumping down the banister, skipping the stairs altogether. A relatively far away shot allows the audience to watch Mr. Hyde jump down two different levels, then, in a following shot, jump down the stairs to the back door to the laboratory. Thus, just as Mr. Hyde has cemented Dr. Jekyll’s damnation by killing another human, his descents become, quite literally, uncontrollable. Near the end of the film, as Mr. Hyde returns to assault his fiancé and, ultimately, kill her father, the camera cuts to a close up of Mr. Hyde’s feet, again descending into the garden. When considering the previous discussion of the use of the garden to symbolize man’s wild nature, the close up shot of the feet emphasizes the final decent into man’s basest desires. These dark images are dramatic contrasts from the ‘holy’ men presented as physician heroes in Pasteur, Ehrlich, and Arrowsmith. Through this contrast to the other three films, Dr. Jekyll demonstrates that any danger from science is due to the man, not the enterprise itself, a concept also appreciated by Toumey and Krietzer. Thus, great physician heroes like Pasteur, Ehrlich, and Arrowsmith are even more extraordinary and worthy of idolization, further building the model of the physician hero."
