        "text": "Mystery dramas were massively popular with American listeners during the Golden Age of Radio. The Whistler, which ran on CBS from 1942 to 1955 with 692 episodes, was one of them. I’ve never heard of it, even though I’m a fan of vintage radio shows, notably The Saint (1947-1951), which starred Vincent Price (of course) as Leslie Charteris’s ‘devil-may-care Robin Hood’ Simon Templar.\n\nAnd just as RKO adapted The Saint for a series of feature films (1938-1943) with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair taking on Templar’s mantle, Columbia Pictures did the same with The Whistler – as part of their series of B-movie crime programmers like Boston Blackie. Between 1944 and 1948, eight B-features, running just 60 minutes each, were produced. Oscar-nominated actor Richard Dix, who was picked based on his performance in Val Lewton’s The Ghost Ship, starred in seven, and Michael Duane played the lead in the last one as Dix had decided to retire from acting.\n\nThe Whistler (voiced by Otto Forrest, who reminded me of American psychic Criswell) acted as the host/narrator, emerging as a shadow with a haunting whistle and heavy footsteps to introduce and comment on the action in each twisted tale of crime and punishment in which Dix would play different characters that were either heroic, villainous or everyman besieged by fate.\n\nFuture gimmick showman William Castle cut his filmmaking teeth directing four of the features, bringing an eerie air with some low-key lighting effects and inventive camera angles (that would inform his later work), and by bringing them under budget, Castle became an in-demand director throughout the 1950s until he decided to go independent and scare the pants off America with such classics as House on Haunted Hill and Strait-Jacket.\n\nFor Indicator’s sixth release in their Columbia Noir collection, all eight films have been brought together in a four-disc Blu-ray box set. Each disc has two features alongside an array of extras, including commentaries, critical appreciations and image galleries, and a 120-page booklet which includes new and archival essays, including a great one from Tim Lucas (I especially liked how he connected these films to David Lynch’s Blue Velvet). If you have never seen these films, I recommend reading Tim’s article and tuning into Kim Newman’s essential primer, A Whistle-Stop Tour, on the first disc beforehand.\n\nDISC ONE\n\nThe Whistler (1944, dir William Castle)\n\nAfter failing to save his wife (Gloria Stuart, of The Old Dark House and Titanic fame) from drowning at sea, guilt-stricken industrialist Earl C. Conrad (Dix) hires a contract killer (House of Frankenstein’s J. Carrol Naish) to end his life – but when his wife turns up alive, he discovers he can’t renege on the deal.\n\nThe Mark of the Whistler (1944, dir William Castle)\n\nIn this tale, scripted by The Devil Bat‘s George Bricker, based on pulp fiction author Cornell Woolrich’s short story, Dormant Account, homeless drifter Lee Nugent (Dix) swindles $30,000 from an abandoned bank account by impersonating someone with the same name. But he’s soon targeted by the rightful owner’s sons (one of whom is played by famed US magician John Calvert).\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Josh Nelson on The Whistler (2024)\n\n• A Whistle-Stop Tour (2024, 25 mins): an in-depth overview of the film series by critic and author Kim Newman\n\n• It’s Your America (1945, 36 mins): a dramatised documentary focusing on soldiers returning from World War II, directed by John Ford and featuring J. Carrol Naish.\n\nDISC TWO\n\nThe Power of the Whistler (1945, dir Lew Landers)\n\nFortune teller Jean Lang (Janis Carter) is determined to help amnesiac William Everest (Dix) uncover his name and past using the items he carries in his pockets – but gets the shock of her life when he turns out to be an escaped maniac from a mental hospital. Director Landers worked on over 100 features throughout his 50+ year career, including the classic Bela Lugosi/Boris Karloff 1935 horror, The Raven.\n\nVoice of the Whistler (1945, dir William Castle)\n\nLoneliness is the key theme in this entry as the wealthy John Sinclair (Dix), who has six months to live, makes a deal with his nurse, Joan (Lynn Merrick), that they marry, and she will inherit his fortune after his death. Seven months after settling into a refurbished lighthouse, John is still very much alive, Joan wants out, and her ex-fiancé Fred (James Cardwell) returns to claim her back… Cue some deadly action as Fred and John try to bump each other off.\n\n• Audio commentary with film scholar Professor Jason A Ney on The Power of the Whistler (2024)\n\n• Audio commentary with the late film historian Lee Gambin (who tragically died, aged just 44, in May, on Voice of the Whistler (2024)\n\n• The Noir City Interview with Robert Dix (2010, 19 mins): an interview with the son of Richard Dix, recorded in LA following a screening of The Power of the Whistler\n\n• Stuart Holmes Oral History (1958, 69 mins): archival audio recording of the prolific character actor in conversation with historian George Pratt\n\nDISC THREE\n\nMysterious Intruder (1946, dir William Castle)\n\nUnscrupulous private detective Don Gale (Dix) gets mixed up in murder and mayhem when he’s hired to find a missing girl whose family inheritance contains two rare collectable song recordings from real-life Swedish singer Jenny Lind. This one features Barton MacLane, who famously played General Peterson in I Dream of Jeannie and professional wrestler/Hollywood heavy Mike Mazurki. It was also Castle’s final feature in the series as he would head off to work with Orson Welles on The Lady from Shanghai.\n\nThe Secret of the Whistler (1946, dir George Sherman)\n\nDix plays ‘kept husband’ Ralph Harrison, who poisons his wealthy wife Edith (Mary Currier), who suffers from bouts of heart attacks, so he can marry artist model Kay (Leslie Brooks). But Edith soon becomes suspicious. A well-acted, well-paced entry from director George Sherman, best known for low-budget Westerns in the 1930s and 1940s, and also the 1971 John Wayne classic, Big Jake, which marked his final feature.\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Jeremy Arnold on Mysterious Intruder (2024)\n\n• Working in the Shadows (2024, 22 mins): Kim Newman looks over William Castle’s early career as a studio-contracted director\n\nDISC FOUR\n\nThe Thirteenth Hour (1947, dir William Clemens)\n\nHere, Dix plays Steve Reynolds, a trucking company owner who can’t get a brake as a rival firm wants him out of the picture. Framed for running down a police officer, Steve, with the help of his fiancé Eileen (Karen Morley) and her son Tommy (Mark Dennis), is determined to prove his innocence armed with a crucial piece of evidence – a glove containing diamonds in the thumb. It was a tremendous final stint from Dix and well-directed by William Clemens, who had previously helmed three Falcon films (RKO’s The Saint imitations). Karen Morley had a burgeoning career in the 1930s and 1940s (check her out in 1932’s The Mask of Fu Manchu), but her career floundered after being blacklisted by the Un-American Activities Committee. Little Mark Dennis also appeared in 1947’s Secret Beyond the Door and 1968’s Targets.\n\nThe Return of the Whistler (1948, dir D. Ross Lederman)\n\nAnother Cornell Woolrich story, All At Once, No Alice, forms the basis for this final entry in the series. Helmed by another actioner director, D. Ross Lederman, it stars Michael Duane as a man whose fiancée Alice (Lenore Aubert, best known for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein) is abducted on the eve of their wedding. As he – and a dogged PI (Boston Blackie regular Richard Lane) – investigate, it turns out Alice is the heir to an estate, and her murderous in-laws are determined to be rid of her.\n\n• Audio commentary with academic Eloise Ross on The Thirteenth Hour (2024)\n\n• It’s Murder (1944, 9 mins): dramatised documentary produced for the war effort directed by Edward Bernds (who helmed 1959’s Return of the Fly and 1958’s Queen of Outer Space)\n\nTake a walk through the shadowy streets of American film noir in four atmospheric classics courtesy of Arrow.\n\nIn The Suspect (1944), a genial shopkeeper, Philip Marshall (Charles Laughton), is constantly nagged by his shrewish wife, Cora (Rosalind Ivan), while secretly yearning for a pretty young stenographer Mary Gray (Ella Raines). When Cora falls to her death, the police are suspicious, and Marshall’s neighbour (Henry Daniell) sees a chance for blackmail. This superb Edwardian-set thriller is a fascinating character study, especially Laughton’s performance in which he reigns in his usual scenery-chewing to give a subtle, compelling turn as the film’s unlikely ‘villain’. You can also see that director Robert Siodmak was beginning to hone his noir credentials here, which he’d perfect with 1946’s The Killers.\n\nThe Sleeping City (1950) sees an undercover policeman (Richard Conte) investigating a murder and narcotics racketeering at New York’s Bellevue Hospital with the help of a nurse (Coleen Gray) whom he finds falling in love with. Directed by George Sherman, this tense, semi-documentary thriller remains one of the few films of the era to be shot entirely on location, including many scenes in and around Bellevue.\n\nIn Thunder on the Hill (1951), convicted murderer Valerie Carns (Ann Blyth) is being transported for execution when a flood strands her and her guards at a convent hospital, where Sister Mary Bonaventure (Claudette Colbert) becomes convinced of Valerie’s innocence and sets out to find the real killer. Three years shy of becoming the King of Hollywood melodramas, Douglas Sirk made a number of noir thrillers, and this is one of the best. Although it’s a bit studio-bound and the killer’s identity pretty obvious from the outset, it does boast nice turns from Colbert as the sleuthing nun, the wonderful Gladys Cooper as the Mother Superior, and making his Hollywood debut, Australian actor Michael Pate, who’s servant character is key in solving the whodunnit.\n\nIn Six Bridges to Cross (1955), streetwise delinquent Jerry Florea (played by Sal Mineo) is shot and wounded by rookie policeman Eddie Gallagher (George Nader) while fleeing the scene of a robbery. Despite this, the two develop a friendship as Eddie and his wife (Julie Adams) take Jerry under their wing, trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. As an adult, Jerry (now played by Tony Curtis) marries and seems to settle down until an armoured security company across the street from him is robbed of $2.5m dollars. Directed by Joseph Pevney with cinematography by Oscar-winner William H Daniels, this crime noir, inspired by the 1950 Great Brink’s Robbery in Boston, Massachusetts, marks Sal Mineo’s screen debut and gives Tony Curtis a meaty character to play (although his accent reminded me of the cartoon character Top Cat at times).\n\nThis showcase of lesser-known noir classics features sterling performances from a host of screen greats, as well as taut direction, stunning cinematography, and superb screenwriting from the likes of Oscar Saul (A Streetcar Named Desire), Jo Eisinger (Gilda, Night and the City), Andrew Holt (In a Lonely Place) and Sydney Boehm (The Big Heat).\n\nLIMITED EDITION CONTENTS\n\n• High Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of all four films\n\n• Original lossless mono audio on all films\n\n• Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing on all films\n\n• Audio commentaries by scholars and critics Farran Smith-Nehme (The Suspect), Imogen Sara Smith (The Sleeping City), Josh Nelson (Thunder on the Hill) and Samm Deighan (Six Bridges to Cross)\n\n• It Had to be Done, author and scholar Alan K. Rode on the career of director Robert Siodmak\n\n• The Real Deal, author and critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas looks at realism and reality in The Sleeping City\n\n• José Arroyo on Thunder on the Hill, a new appreciation by the esteemed film scholar and critic\n\n• Style and Place, film critic Jon Towlson examines the work of cinematographer William H. Daniels\n\n• Vintage radio play versions of The Suspect and Thunder on the Hill starring Charles Laughton, Ella Raines, Claudette Colbert and Barbara Rush\n\n• Theatrical Trailers\n\n• Poster and stills galleries\n\n• Reversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Scott Saslow\n\n• Double-sided fold-out posters for each film featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Scott Saslow\n\n• Hardback collector’s book featuring new writing on the films by film critics Kat Ellinger, Philip Kemp and Jon Towlson\n\nI have seen every incarnation of Batman on the big and small screen ever since I became a fan of the 1960s Adam West/Burt Ward TV series as a kid. I have enjoyed them all – some more so than others (psst! I’d rather watch those overblown Joel Schumacher ones than sit through the dire Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ever again). After Christopher Nolan’s incredible, seemingly unmatchable, Dark Knight trilogy, however, I was wondering why Batman should be resurrected yet again? But of course, there’s money to be made – and there’s a whole new generation of fans waiting in the ‘bat’ wings.\n\nNow I’m a HUGE fan of the original Planet of the Apes films and absolutely loved the recent reboots. So when I read that producer Dylan Clark was on board, as well as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War of the Planet of the Apes director Matt Reeves, I suspected that The Batman would be something to look forward to. And it is!\n\nIn his second year as Gotham’s masked avenger, Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is still finding his way as The Batman when he comes up against terrorist serial killer the Riddler (Paul Dano), who is striking fear in the city’s corrupt political elite as he takes them out one by one. But what is his real agenda and what does it have to do with Bruce’s murdered parents?\n\nHaving shown his acting chops in Robert Eggers’ psychological horror The Lighthouse (2019) and Christopher Nolan’s spy film Tenet (2020), I knew that Pattinson would do the character justice. He does, though his impassive presence might be read as bland by some critics. Then there’s his hairstyle when he’s out of costume.\n\nI just wanted to get a pair of scissors and trim those bangs. Oh, and is it just me or does he look like he’s channelling Crispin Glover in the 2003 Willard remake when he’s playing Bruce? As for the suit, I thought it fantastic – especially the pointy ears that I’m certain pay homage to the ones seen in Columbia’s 1940s serials.\n\nThe supporting cast assembled here is amazing and The Batman is an ensemble piece that works brilliantly. Paul Dano is downright disturbing as the Riddler, while Peter Sarsgaard, John Turturro and Rupert Penry-Jones are all decidedly nasty in their roles; but it’s Colin Farrell as rising mobster Oswald Cobblepot (AKA Penguin) that steals the show. Having gone into the press screening blind, I had no idea it was Farrell behind the prosthetics and fat suit. He’s terrific – no wonder he’s in line for a stand-alone film.\n\nZoë Kravitz also impresses as cat-burglar Selina Kyle, and I just loved how she and the writers have made her Catwoman such a sympathetic, heroic character. Then there are some familiar faces in Jeffrey Wright as Batman’s ally James Gordon and Andy Serkis as Alfred, while twins Charlie and Max Carver supply the much-needed eye candy as a couple of bouncer types.\n\nIf you have never seen or read a Batman film, comic, TV show or cartoon, then you will certainly miss a lot of what makes this new entry so special – while lifelong fans will get a huge buzz. It’s a wild dark noir ride that might be a tad too long for some (near on three hours), but well worth returning to the cinema for.\n\nOh and so too are the film’s locations, including Liverpool’s St George’s Hall (standing in for Gotham City Hall), County Sessions House, the Royal Liver Building, the Walker Art Gallery, the Wellington Memorial Statue and much more, plus Glasgow’s Necropolis Cemetery, and Two Temple Place in London. I see a walking tour in the making.\n\nCHECK OUT THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE: https://www.thebatmanmovie.net/\n\nThe final feature by Sidney Gilliat, 1972’s Endless Night capped a career that encompassed screenplays for Alfred Hitchcock and Carol Reed, the anarchic St Trinian’s comedies, and his own directorial gems such as mystery-thriller Green for Danger.\n\nTold in flashback, the thriller centres on 20-something chauffeur Michael (Hywel Bennett) who gets the chance to build his dream home when he falls in love with wealthy American heiress Ellie (Hayley Mills). But following their marriage (in secret), a series of bizarre events begin to upset their new life on Gypsy’s Acre… Could they have something to do with the land being cursed or could Ellie’s greedy relatives and interfering best friend be causing them?\n\nAdapting Agatha Christie’s 1967 novel of the same name (one of her favourites), the 1972 thriller reunites some of of the team of 1968’s Twisted Nerve, including co-stars Bennett and Mills, cinematographer Harry Waxman, and composer Bernard Herrmann (who conjures up another impressive score), and boasts a great supporting cast including Britt Ekland (as Ellie’s suspect friend), George Sanders (who was making Pyschomania at the same time), Ann Way (fantastic as an old gypsy woman) and Lois Maxwell (playing a right bitch). Plus, there’s a host of familiar faces from classic British TV, including Peter Bowles, Windsor Davies and Nicholas Courtney. Uncredited is Shirley Jones (yes, of The Partridge Family fame) who dubs Hayley Mills’ singing voice, while character actor Leo Glenn plays the psychiatrist.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The ultra modernist house that is also one of the major characters in the film, was designed by the film’s production designer Wilfred Shingleton, but was not actually real: just a clever combination of matte paintings and a pre-fabricated front for the exteriors (which took place on Brighstone Down in the Isle of Wight), while the interiors were all created on a set at Shepparton Studios. Still it looks fantastic and worthy of being a Bond villain’s lair (especially the moveable floor that reveals a swimming pool)! Meanwhile, the house that stands in for the mental hospital and a restaurant is actually Grim’s Dyke in North London, the former home of the dramatist WS Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame that was used in the late-1960s horrors, Cry of the Banshee and Curse of the Crimson Altar.\n\nFilled with lots of Hitchcockian elements (especially that score), mysterious, untrustful characters, and an unsettling twist ending, Endless Night is a great little mystery thriller to revisit and it’s out now on Blu-ray from Indicator with the following special features (most of which lovingly concentrate on Bernard Herrmann)…\n\n• New restoration from a 4K scan (from StudioCanal)\n\n• Original mono audio\n\n• The BEHP Interview with Sidney Gilliat (1990, 100 mins): archival audio recording\n\n• The John Player Lecture with Bernard Herrmann (1972, 53 mins)\n\n• A Full House (2020, 8 mins): interview with Hayley Mills (this was my highlight)\n\n• Endless Notes (2020, 13 mins): composer Howard Blake recalls working with Herrmann\n\n• Emotional Turbulence (2020, 16 mins): Author and historian Neil Sinyard explore Herrmann’s late career and his enduring legacy\n\n• Image gallery\n\n• Original theatrical trailer\n\n• New and improved English subtitles\n\n• Collector’s booklet with a new essay by Anne Billson, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat on Endless Night, an archival interview with Gilliat, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits"
