        "text": "Woman in Distress vs. Femme Fatale\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe table below is based on the filmographies in the following three books. This means that the films that are cited are crime noirs; spy noirs aren’t represented. The number of film noirs in each of these three books is enormous, although their respective filmographies are not at all uniform.\n\nMichael F. Keaney, Film Noir Guide: 745 Films of the Classic Era, 1940-1959 (McFarland & Company, Inc., 2003)\n\nSpencer Selby, The Worldwide Film Noir Tradition (Sink Press, 2013); 796 films\n\nAndrew Spicer, Historical Dictionary of Film Noir (The Scarecrow Press, 2010). In his filmography, there are eight films for which he gives two titles, such as “Gangs Inc. (aka Paper Bullets).” By counting those films only once, his total is also 796.\n\nThe table demonstrates that the outstanding refutation of the legitimacy of the hardboiled paradigm rests on the equal if not greater presence of the woman in distress compared with the femme fatale in American film noir.\n\nOn the other hand, the success of the hardboiled paradigm in dominating the literature, to say nothing of public consciousness, about film noir is shown by the absence in the published literature of any studies of the woman in distress in film noir. This is shameful. For my presentation on this topic, see the page Significance of The Woman in Distress.\n\nThe following 26 film noirs feature both a femme fatale and a woman in distress:\n\nThe Accused; Alias Nick Beal; The Blonde Bandit; Cop Hater; The Dark Mirror; The Glass Alibi; Hit and Run; Jealousy; Johnny Angel; The Last Crooked Mile; The Madonna’s Secret; Mildred Pierce; The Mysterious Mr. Valentine; Niagara; No Man’s Woman; Quiet Please, Murder; Railroaded!; Roadblock; Shadow on the Wall; Shock; Sleep, My Love; So Evil My Love; Strange Impersonation; The Last Crooked Mile; The Velvet Touch; Vertigo.\n\nIn Roadblock and Vertigo, the film begins with a woman who is a femme fatale and ends with her being a woman in distress. The opposite occurs in The Last Crooked Mile.\n\nPresentation"
