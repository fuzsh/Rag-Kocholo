        "text": "As we look back at the Batman character‚Äôs storied 75-plus year history, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that there was a time when he truly was a ‚Äúnew‚Äù character. And one of the biggest Batman events that took place when he was new was the release of his first celluloid appearance, the 1943 Columbia black-and-white 15-chapter serial simply entitled The Batman.\n\nThe Batman is an odd but fascinating mixture of Batman comic mythos, World War II propaganda and cheaply crafted cliffhanger clich√©s. Like most all serials of its time, each of serial‚Äôs chapters ended with a scene showing our hero facing seemingly inescapable mortal danger. Of course, Batman always managed to escape this danger in the next chapter, but the only way 1940‚Äôs moviegoers could know this for sure was to spend their money on a ticket for next week‚Äôs show.\n\nBatman starred Lewis Wilson as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Douglas Croft as Robin/Dick Grayson, and J. Carrol Naish as the diabolical Japanese criminal mastermind Dr. Daka. Daka was Batman‚Äôs only villain ‚Äì all 15 chapters of the serial revolved around Batman and Robin‚Äôs efforts to find him and bring him to justice. The villain had never appeared in Batman comic stories ‚Äì he was created specifically for the serial in order to reflect the United States‚Äô preoccupation with World War II.\n\nObviously, Batman was trying to bridge a rather uncomfortable gap between real-life threats to America and escapist entertainment. This combination might have seemed appropriate in the heat of the World War II years, but it certainly does not work for modern audiences ‚Äì many of the anti-Japanese sentiments found in Batman‚Äôs scenes involving Daka come across now as bigoted and hysterical.\n\nTo make matters worse, like most other serials of its time, Batman was filmed quickly and very cheaply ‚Äì so not surprisingly, it left much to be desired in terms of its production values. For example, Batman and Robin‚Äôs costumes were ill-fitting and badly designed, and they were not even given a Batmobile to drive ‚Äì they were forced to drive Bruce Wayne‚Äôs rather modest-looking convertible around Gotham City while they were fighting crime! Also, many of the serial‚Äôs action sequences were unimaginatively staged and unconvincingly executed.\n\nObviously, Batman is no cinematic masterpiece ‚Äì in fact, quite a bit of it is not even remotely good! Still, the serial did have its moments, and even more importantly, it was responsible for introducing a number of elements into the Batman mythos that became as vital to the character as his cape and cowl.\n\nFor example, the Batcave was entirely an invention of Batman‚Äôs screenwriters. It was actually referred to as the ‚ÄúBat‚Äôs Cave‚Äù in the serial, but its name was just about the only element of it that would be changed from the screen to the comic page. In Batman‚Äôs first scenes, the ‚ÄúBat‚Äôs Cave‚Äù was established as Batman‚Äôs secret base of operations located under Bruce Wayne‚Äôs residence in Gotham City.\n\nBatman was also responsible for creating one of Batman‚Äôs most memorable supporting characters ‚Äì Alfred, Bruce Wayne‚Äôs faithful English butler. Alfred, played by William Austin, was an essential but slightly bumbling member of Batman‚Äôs crimefighting team and the only person who knew that Bruce and Dick were actually Batman and Robin. Many times during the course of the serial he was called into service to assist them.\n\nBatman not only featured these Batman ‚Äúfirsts,‚Äù it also featured a strong performance by Lewis Wilson as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He brought the character to the screen for the first time in a straightforward, square-jawed action hero manner that at times transcended his ill-fitting Batman costume. And Douglas Croft was equally good as Robin. Croft had one major advantage over every other actor who would play the role ‚Äì namely, he was closer in age to the character than they were. To date, Croft has been the screen‚Äôs only true ‚ÄúBoy Wonder‚Äù ‚Äì he was about 16 years old when Batman was filmed, and his youthful exuberance was perfectly suited for the role.\n\nWhen all is said and done, The Batman simply is what it is ‚Äì not a particularly good serial, but still a huge milestone in the character‚Äôs history. Consequently, I will always have quite a bit of affection for it, warts and all.\n\nColumbia produced a second and final Batman serial in 1949 entitled Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin starred Robert Lowery as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Johnny Duncan as Robin/Dick Grayson. Like Batman, the serial was a black-and-white, 15-chapter film presented in weekly installments. Also like Batman, each of Batman and Robin‚Äôs chapters ended with a scene showing its heroes facing seemingly inescapable mortal danger.\n\nUnfortunately, Batman and Robin had something else in common with Batman besides its 15-chapter cliffhanger serial format ‚Äì it was also every bit as poorly realized as its predecessor. Almost every element of Batman and Robin was sorely lacking in quality ‚Äì it suffered from bad writing, stale acting, unconvincing special effects, shoddy costuming and props, and wildly inappropriate shooting locations. In the serial, Batman and Robin were again realized in very poorly designed costumes, and they were still not even given a Batmobile to drive. Also, many of Batman and Robin‚Äôs action sequences were as unimaginatively staged and unconvincingly executed as the ones in 1943.\n\nAnd like The Batman, Batman and Robin also chose to ignore all of Batman‚Äôs classic comic book villains such as the Joker and the Penguin in favor of creating a villain specifically for the serial. The villain they came up with was an appallingly bland character called ‚ÄúThe Wizard,‚Äù who wore a dark mask that covered his entire face and a long dark cape. The Wizard was Batman and Robin‚Äôs only villain ‚Äì all 15 chapters of the serial revolved around Batman and Robin‚Äôs efforts to find him and bring him to justice. The villain concealed his identity from everyone in Batman and Robin, including all of the members of his own gang. Part of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of Batman and Robin for audiences was to try to figure out which other character featured in the serial was actually the Wizard.\n\nIt would probably be unfair to say that Batman and Robin was all that much worse than Batman was, but it was certainly not any better. In fact, there has never been a clear consensus amongst Batman fans as to which serial was superior. To put it bluntly, both serials are on the whole so bad that neither one has a noticeable advantage over the other. In other words, Batman fans, choose your poison.\n\nRobert Lowery as Batman and Johnny Duncan as Robin in Batman and Robin (1949)\n\nI am of the opinion that it is the worse poison. I cannot give The Batman a wholehearted thumbs-up, but I feel it still has considerably more style and spirit than Batman and Robin does. Plus, Batman and Robin was made a full decade after the character‚Äôs comic book debut, by which point most every key element of his mythos was firmly established. Columbia should have treated Batman with more respect when making Batman and Robin than they did when making The Batman, because by 1949 he had become a character that possessed a certain degree of ‚Äúlongevity.‚Äù But instead, the studio treated him every bit as offhandedly as they had six years earlier, and basically doomed Batman and Robin to failure even before the cameras started rolling.\n\nRobert Lowery‚Äôs portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne and Johnny Duncan‚Äôs portrayal of Robin/Dick Grayson made matters worse. While Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft gave energetic performances in The Batman that at times managed to rise above the serial‚Äôs many faults, Lowery and Duncan blandly delivered most of their lines as if they were reading them for the first time. Duncan‚Äôs performance was probably the more unconvincing of the two, because he was simply far too old for his role ‚Äì he was 26 years of age when the serial was filmed!\n\nBatman and Robin did include a few ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù that will be of interest to longtime Batman fans. The serial offered the first screen portrayal of Commissioner Gordon ‚Äì he was played by Lyle Talbot, who turned in a likable, low-key performance. And the Batsignal made its screen debut ‚Äì it was kept in Gordon‚Äôs office, and when he wanted to summon Batman and Robin he would shine it out of his window and into the sky."
