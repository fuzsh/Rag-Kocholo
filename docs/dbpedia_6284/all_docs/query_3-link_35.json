        "text": "Yes, If I had a time machine, one of the things I would is travel to 1940s to help Bob Kane pitch the Batman movie. My idea is a combination of the Horror movies from the 30s and a Detective story. I would use visuals similar to \"The Bat\" and \"The Bat Returns\" two movies that where an inspiration to the creation of Batman. Also the type of visuals of horror movies of the 30s played a lot with the shadows that would be perfect for a Batman movie and basically I would use all of the horror techniques from that era, they all fit him. I want a Batman that doesn't speak much and stays mostly in the shadows (using stealth attacks) except for a few brief fight scenes.\n\nProbably I would use Batman and Bruce Wayne scenes, The Batman scenes is him beating up the criminals and Bruce Wayne scenes would be with the commisioner Gordon, whose more interested in catching Batman than the other criminals. Bruce Wayne would be an old friend of the commisioner who is bored and wants to go with him in interesting cases (He would invest in tons of charity and would be known good guy unlike Batman). Their dynamic would play like this, the Commisioner would try to find clues to catch Batman but Bruce would lead him into solving the actual crime. I want Batman's identity to be unknown until the end of the movie. In the final fight against the criminal mastermind (I am not sure who I want for the villain), the villain would grab a bottle of acid a throw it in part of Batman's mask, then Batman knocks him out and rips part of his cowl. Sirens, coming from everywhere, he tries to escape (the audience doesn't get a direct shot of his face) and Gordon spots him and follows him into a near alley. Gordon says Freeze! and an injured Batman turns around showing to Gordon and the audience that he is Bruce Wayne. Gordon shocked lowers the gun and Batman walks into the night.\n\nYes, If I had a time machine, one of the things I would is travel to 1940s to help Bob Kane pitch the Batman movie.
