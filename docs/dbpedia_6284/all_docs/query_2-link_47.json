        "text": "Bobby Madden has run the rule over four big decisions on the opening Premiership weekend - with Celtic's non-penalty against Kilmarnock one of two 'mistakes' highlighted.\n\nThe Premiership returned with its standard dose of VAR, handball and penalty drama this weekend and former top ref Madden has had plenty to say on his Instagram page. On Monday, he spoke out on Connor Barron's alleged 'handball' against Hearts as well as Luke Graham's similar incident in the Dundee derby, neither of which were given due to new UEFA guidance on relaxing handball decisions.\n\nHe voiced a frustration at the lack of transparency from the SFA on the new regulations, with no public announcement forthcoming that officials would be taking a different approach. And he's doubled down on that stance with a new rundown of four of the big decisions, also ripping into the decision not to award Kyogo a penalty after being taken out by Robby McCrorie late on against Kilmarnock. Here's what Madden had to say.\n\nBarron 'handball' - Hearts vs Rangers\n\nOn field decision - No penalty\n\nVAR - No intervention\n\nFinal decision- Correct\n\nWith the relaxation of the handball criteria only being shared with clubs and media (still baffles me why the SFA don’t share examples on their own platforms or partner with a media outlet for fans) there is still a lot of doubt regarding what is punishable.\n\nThe distance is short and the movement isn’t unnatural, my understanding is that this is not punishable. I would go as far to say that if this was awarded I would expect VAR intervention to correct it. Hopefully this standard is maintained after the quite ludicrous guidance on-hand that has been issued in recent years.\n\nDundee United penalty conceded - Dundee derby\n\nOn field decision - No foul\n\nVAR - On-field review recommended. Penalty awarded\n\nFinal decision- Correct\n\nVery tight offside and assistant correctly delays flag. The challenge is made and the attack stops. The assistant then raises flag and offside is given. If the referee had believed this was a penalty it should have been awarded and then the flag should have followed. VAR correctly requests an OFR having identified there was no offside. The foul itself is quite clear and doesn’t require much discussion.\n\nLuke Graham 'handball' - Dundee derby\n\nOn field decision - No penalty\n\nVAR - No Intervention\n\nFinal decision- Incorrect\n\nWith limited information being shared there is still a degree of uncertainty. What we can say about this is that the ball travels a long way, it strikes the outstretched elbow of a defender and I would have expect a penalty to be awarded last season. Having spoken to some foreign referees that seems to be the case again this season.\n\nKyogo 'penalty' - Celtic vs Kilmarnock\n\nOn field decision - No penalty\n\nVAR - No Intervention\n\nFinal decision- Incorrect\n\nWith limited information being shared there is still a degree of uncertainty. What we can say about this is that the ball travels a long way, it strikes the outstretched elbow of a defender and I would have expect a penalty to be awarded last season.
