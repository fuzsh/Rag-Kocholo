        "text": "#10: “Memento” (2000)\n\nChristopher Nolan’s breakout film is anything but straightforward. And we mean that part of it is literally structured backwards. In this thriller, Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man with memory issues trying to solve the death of his wife. With little more than Polaroid photos and tattoos to guide him, Leonard is both haunted and perplexed. You’ll need to pay close attention to follow all the twists and turns of this mystery. Based on a short story by his brother Jonathan, Nolan's script and direction make you feel like you’re right there in Leonard’s shoes, as does Pearce's intense performance. You might not understand everything the first time you see \"Memento.\" But you will never forget it.\n\n#9: “The Long Goodbye” (1973)\n\nRaymond Chandler is one of the most renowned authors in detective fiction, and Philip Marlowe is his most well-known creation. The observant and witty Marlowe is the perfect man to crack seemingly unsolvable mysteries. And \"The Long Goodbye\" is a fascinating look at this iconic character. Directed by Robert Altman, the film takes the character, associated with the 30s and 40s, and drops him into the then-modern era of the 70s. Though some took issue with the film's revisionist take on Marlowe and Elliott Gould's slovenly portrayal, appreciation for the film and how it examines detective movies from a complex angle has grown. While it might not be the Philip Marlowe you remember from “The Big Sleep,” “The Long Goodbye’ is still a fantastic neo-noir.\n\n#8: “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” (1988)\n\n“Who Framed Roger Rabbit” is fondly remembered for its memorable characters and seamless blending of animation and live-action. But we should remember that it’s also just a great detective story. After excitable Toon Roger Rabbit is implicated in a grisly crime, he teams up with hardboiled detective Eddie Valiant, who learns that Toontown isn’t all fun and gags. A great homage to both classic cartoons and detective stories, “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” is one that viewers of all ages can love. Even after countless viewings, we’re still amazed and delighted by it.\n\n#7: “Seven” (1995)\n\nIn some whodunits, finding the culprit ensures a tidy, satisfying conclusion. That’s not the case in “Seven,” David Fincher’s haunting thriller about two detectives trying to track down a serial killer with a twisted sense of morality. Using the seven deadly sins for reference, the deranged John Doe tests the resolve of both the energetic Detective David Mills and the weary Detective Lieutenant William Somerset. This leads to a climax that redefines the meaning of the word “shocking.” With great performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and uncompromising direction by Fincher, “Seven” is a grim, upsetting, and highly thoughtful examination of what it means to live in an unpredictable world.\n\n#6: “Gosford Park” (2001)\n\nDirector Robert Altman worked in a variety of genres. But he had a real knack for mysteries, as shown by “The Long Goodbye” and “Gosford Park.” A mystery in the style of Agatha Christie, \"Gosford Park\" brings together a massive ensemble without ever feeling overloaded. In the film, a group of British elites in the 1930s find their weekend getaway spoiled by a gruesome death. Both a compelling mystery, a beautifully shot period piece, and a sharp satire of the upper-class, “Gosford Park” might seem old-fashioned in some regards, but its message and overall quality are timeless.\n\n#5: “Scream” (1996)\n\nThe first “Scream” is both a great satire of slasher film tropes and an excellent murder mystery overall. When a masked killer who’s seen one too many horror movies is on the loose, high schooler Sidney Prescott needs to use all of her determination and intelligence to survive. By thoughtfully critiquing the slasher genre, “Scream” managed to revive it. But without horror legend Wes Craven’s sharp direction, Kevin Williamson’s witty script, and Neve Campbell’s sympathetic starring performance, they can’t compare. “Scream” is likely to have you both screaming and laughing without ever feeling tonally off.\n\n#4: “Murder on the Orient Express” (1974)\n\nWe couldn’t possibly make a list of the best whodunits without mentioning at least one Agatha Christie adaptation. And this is arguably the best of the bunch. Directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring a stacked cast, including Albert Finney as mustachioed detective Hercule Poirot, “Murder on the Orient Express” is everything you’d want from a Christie adaptation. And Christie herself agrees, calling it one of the few adaptations of her work she actually liked. If you loved the 2017 adaption, we highly recommend checking out the 70s version to see another great take on this author’s work.\n\n#3: “Knives Out” (2019)\n\nAnother whodunit indebted to Agatha Christie, “Knives Out,” is as sharp as its titular weaponry. When a famous mystery author is found dead, renowned sleuth Benoit Blanc (played by Daniel Craig) believes it’s not as straightforward as it seems. Meanwhile, the author’s spoiled family is less in mourning and more eyeing their inheritance. It’s hard to discuss “Knives Out” without potentially giving away key plot elements. But its clever and unpredictable narrative, social commentary, and great ensemble - with a standout performance by Ana de Armas - make the film a must-see for mystery fans.\n\n#2: “L.A. Confidential” (1997)\n\nIt’s one thing to be able to recreate a time and place as well as this film does with 1950s Los Angeles. It’s another to go further than just great cinematography and production design. In this modern take on classic noir, based on James Ellroy’s novel, law enforcement and Hollywood collide for one complicated but engrossing story. There are many characters and plot elements to keep track of, but it's a pleasure to follow both aspects. With an incredible cast including pre-stardom Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, as well as an Oscar-winning Kim Basinger, it's no secret that \"L.A. Confidential\" is amazing.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Witness for the Prosecution” (1957)\n\nAn Excellent Agatha Christie Adaptation from Billy Wilder\n\n“Zodiac” (2007)\n\nAnother Great Mystery from David Fincher\n\n“Charade” (1963)\n\nThis Caper Is Considered by Many to Be the Best Hitchcock Movie Alfred Hitchcock Never Made\n\n“Brick” (2005)\n\n“Knives Out” Director Rian Johnson Brought Noir to High School in His Excellent Debut\n\n#1: “The Maltese Falcon” (1941)\n\n“The Maltese Falcon” isn’t just the best whodunit movie; it’s also arguably the most important one. The third and by-far best adaptation of Dashiell Hammett’s novel, the film launched the careers of director John Huston and star Humphrey Bogart and, to some, the genre of noir as a whole. Bogart plays Sam Spade, a now-archetypal film detective, who finds himself wrapped up in a case of murder and a bird statuette. With its ingenious plotting, great cast, and brilliant cinematography, “The Maltese Falcon” became a surprise hit upon release and still endures as a classic. To quote the film, it’s “the stuff that dreams are made of.”"
