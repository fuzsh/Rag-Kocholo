        "text": "Last Update 4/30/07\n\nNight at the Museum (2006)\n\nI never quite found the time to go see this in the theaters although I wanted to. Possibly that's because I also sort of didn't want to. In my stacks of notes for novels I have yet to write is a brief outline of one set in a museum where the exhibits come to life at night, designed to be a humorous light fantasy. The previews of this present film convinced me that I'd probably never get to write the duel between the protagonist and the animated stegosaurus. So it goes. Anyway, I overcame my subliminal resistance at last and sat down to watch it and I'm glad I did. Ben Stiller's style of humor doesn't always work with me, but it's perfect this time. There's also an impressive cast of supporting actors including Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Anne Meara, Owen Wilson, and Robin Williams.\n\nStiller plays a divorced dad with an unsettled life and uncertain future who is feeling as though events are conspiring to drive him and his son apart. He somewhat reluctantly accepts a job as night watchman in a museum, unaware that the other guards share a secret they're not revealing to him. During his first night he discovers the truth and has to play fetch with a dinosaur, escape from Attila the Hun, survive being caught in a Civil War battlefield, avoid the hungry lions, and generally run for his life. Things get even worse when Dexter the monkey tears up his list of instructions.\n\nDespite his initial intention to quit, he returns better prepared for the second night, but that ends in disaster as well and he is almost fired, setting up the climax for night number three. To prove himself to his son, he invites the boy to join him for the experience of his life. Unfortunately, the three ex-guards have stolen the magical talent responsible for the transformation and in the confusion, several of the animated exhibits escape from the museum. Stiller rallies the exhibits to defeat the villainous threesome and proves himself to his son. It's more than a little silly and the end is a bit too pat, but in general it's lots of fun, and the special effects are great. 4/30/07\n\nIce Age (2002)\n\nIce Age 2: Meltdown (2006)\n\nI finally got around to watching these. In the original, a sloth and a mammoth attempt to return a human baby to his tribe, accompanied by a sabertooth tiger who intends to lure them to their deaths at the hands of his pack mates. Their tribulations bring them closer together despite their inherent differences and the villainous tiger finds his allegiances shifting as the trap is sprung. Excellent animation and a cute if obvious story. The little character with the acorn is my favorite. Hes back in the sequel, which follows the further adventures of our three friends as the Ice Age comes to an end. The melting ice is causing a flood and the inhabitants of a valley have to find high ground before theyre all drowned. The thaw is also releasing some carnivorous sea creatures with healthy appetites. Our mammoth friend finds a lady mammoth raised as a possum. Lots of fun and one great line when the friends first discover that the lady mammoth thinks shes a possum. The branches dont go all the way to the top of her tree. 4/29/07\n\nHaeckels Tale (2006)\n\nAnother installment of the Masters of Horror cable television series, this one directed by John McNaughton from a story by Clive Barker. Haeckel is an 18th Century medical student who is fascinated by the supposed work of Victor Frankenstein but who has fallen short of restoring the dead to life. When he sees a traveling necromancer apparently bring a dead dog to life, he is torn between disbelief, curiosity, and hope, but the necromancer is not interested in explaining his secrets to the inquisitive, no matter what their motives.\n\nWhen his father takes ill, he undertakes to walk home and shelters one night with a man and his oddly seductive wife. She disappears in the night and he follows, where he finds her having sex with the reanimated corpse of her dead lover. Lots of death and dismemberment follow but rather aimlessly, and the surprise that the baby is the son of the corpse rather than the living husband is no surprise at all. The resolution of the frame story is rather funny but doesnt fit the tone of the rest, and it wanders off toward the end as well. Acutely disappointing. 4/28/07\n\nBlackhawk (1952)\n\n\"The Blackhawks! With no weapons but their strong fists and alert minds!\"\n\nTime for another cliffhanger serial, this one featuring aviators equipped with super-planes who venture out from their secret base to help people in distress. They are pitted against an organization of evil saboteurs commanded by a sinister woman, Laska. As the story opens, one of the Blackhawks is replaced by his evil twin brother, although the ruse doesnt last long and the double fails to prevent them from heading off a major sabotage attempt against an industrial plant. Turnabout is fair play, and the good brother manages to infiltrate the gang. Both impersonations are painfully bad to watch.\n\nNext a scientist is menaced.\n\nIs this the secret device that youve been secretly working on for the government? Yes, and somehow the secret has gotten out.\n\nIts a raygun that fires a beam three times the speed of light and disintegrates whatever it is focused on. The saboteurs have been sending threatening messages so he calls the Blackhawks. Why the saboteurs would show their hand and give warning, and why the scientist doesnt contact the government are two mysteries that are not solved. Much running around, wringing of hands, issuing of threats, and reckless driving follows. Eventually the Blackhawks are hit with the ray, but instead of blowing up, they just collapse with no breath or pulse. Later they revive, because the ray apparently just induced some kind of suspended animation. In order to save on sets, all of the gangs hideouts are built exactly the same, supposedly so their captives wont know which hideout theyve been held at.\n\n\"These places all look the same inside.\"\n\n\"There must be a reason for that.\"\n\nThe next plot involves an attempt to steal the secret of a fuel that never needs to be replenished  neat trick that one. There's a battle in an oil field that is surprisingly impressive visually, the first sign in the entire film that some actual money had been spent on sets and effects. On the other hand, the cartoon flying saucer weapon is downright silly. Chases and traps ensue. \"There's some of that sabotage crowd!\"\n\nThen there's the airplane chase. The good guys are trailing Laska, but one of her henchmen leans out the cockpit window, fires two shots from his handgun, and not only hits but disables the Blackhawk plane, forcing it to land. Fortunately, they hitch a ride with no trouble. After more hijinks in Mexico, they return to the US for the action packed conclusion. Not one of the better serials. 4/27/07\n\nMr. Moto in Danger Island (1938)\n\nMr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939)\n\nThe Return of Mr. Moto (1965)\n\nDanger Island, though it involves Moto, is based on a novel by someone named John Vandercook which presumably did not. Moto and a dimwitted professional wrestler defeat an attempt to kill Moto, who has arrived on Puerto Rico in the employ of diamond merchants who want to expose a ring of smugglers. Theres an entire room full of suspects when Moto tries to figure out how the gang learned of his arrival, after which he sets off to explore a haunted swamp. All the evidence points to the Chief of Police as a smuggler and killer, but we know hes innocent because he has a beautiful daughter and hes too obvious. Then Moto is framed as an impostor and has to go into hiding, but not all is what it appears. The comic sidekick could have been left out as far as I was concerned, but otherwise its a suspenseful thriller.\n\nMr. Moto Takes a Vacation was the last Moto film Lorre did. The outbreak of World War II made it impossible to continue with a Japanese hero even before Pearl Harbor. The title is an obvious misnomer as this time he is helping guard a priceless archaeological treasure recently unearthed in Egypt. A bumbling Englishman thwarted the first attempt to steal it, more through happenstance than planning, but the criminals arent discouraged so easily. There are too many jokes this time around, fatally diluting the tension of the central plot. A disappointing end to an otherwise fine series.\n\nMr. Moto returned for one last adventure in The Return of Mr. Moto, this time with Henry Silva playing the part of the oriental detective. The opening theme is reminiscent of James Bond, but that's about the only similarity. It's shot in black and white and involves a plot to influence the sale of oil in the Middle East. A lot of the shots look like television from the 1950s, and the acting is less than scintillating, as is the dialogue. \"I dislike killing the wrong person. Professional pride.\" There's no attempt to make Silva look or sound Oriental, so he looks Puerto Rican.\n\nMoto is dining with an old friend who is concerned about a burning oil well and who is the target of a grumpy assassin. When his friend is murdered in front of him, Moto doesn't take too kindly to the act, and when try to kill him as well - after one of the most tediously slow chases I've ever seen by some of the most incompetent hitmen I've ever seen - he tricks one into killing the other. The assassin then confers with his superiors in a comically inept conference that concludes with the urgent task of killing Moto, although there's no reason why they should do so. Moto neither saw nor heard anything which puts them at risk. On several occasions, there is an odd pause after one or another actor utters a line of dialogue, as though everyone concerned paused to contemplate just how inane the words really were.\n\nThere's another tediously slow pursuit and murder attempt, which Moto shrugs off almost without comment. If anything the dialogue gets progressive worse, particularly the first conversation between Moto and Lennox, an oil executive. This Moto doesn't know martial arts either, which leads to his being captured rather easily. He is tied and bagged and thrown into the ocean, after which we find that he has escaped somehow - we never find out how - but that he and the authorities are reporting him dead to lure out the bad guys. The movie stumbles rather than rushes toward its unconvincing conclusion. 4/26/07\n\nMysterious Mr. Moto (1938)\n\nMr. Motos Last Warning (1939)\n\nPeter Lorres fifth outing as Mr. Moto starts with him helping a man escape from Devils Island, then impersonating a personal servant in order to get information about an international gang of criminals. He is trying to unmask the leader of the organization, while simultaneously protecting a businessman whose innovative steel process has made him a target of this organization. Unfortunately, the businessman suspects Motos identity and motives and wont tell him everything. A car chase, bar fight, and a battle in a loft follow in one of the better entries in the series.\n\nThe sixth appeared as World War II was beginning, a development that would soon bring the series to an abrupt end. George Sanders, who would later be the Saint and the Falcon, appears along with John Carradine. Already political tensions were obvious. Foreign spies are hoping to sabotage elements of the French fleet and throw the blame on the British, but Moto is on the job. Sanders is the heavy who kidnaps and murders Motos associate, believing him to be Moto. A ventriloquist is head of the bad guys and Carradine is a British agent working undercover. Uncharacteristically, the villain has a gentler, better side, and several of the characters are portrayed with more depth than in previous installments in the series. 4/25/07\n\nMr. Motos Gamble (1938)\n\nMr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938)\n\nThe first of these two titles was originally meant to be a Charlie Chan movie (Charlie Chan at Ringside), but it was rewritten when Warner Oland died. There is a very different feel to it, lighter, more inclined to be humorous and Keye Luke is clearly meant to be Charlie Chans son. Moto is in the US, teaching a course at the police academy, when he witnesses a boxing match in which one of the fighters dies under mysterious circumstances. The predictable byplay involving two rivals for the hand of the surviving fighter and the often ludicrous humor surrounding a kleptomaniac police detective detract from what might otherwise have been a reasonably good mystery, although I did figure out who was responsible even before Moto did.\n\nIn the second and much better film, Moto is posing as an archaeologist in a remote part of southeast Asia when a female aviator crash lands just in time to get involved in a murder, blamed on a television crew that films despite the objections of the high priest. Moto finds a poisoned dart but bides his time, then openly and also disguised as a mystic, he thwarts two plots, one by the high priest, one by the local ruler who wants to marry the aviatrix and overthrow French rule. Theres a nice touch when Motos carrier pigeon is served to him for dinner, message still attached. Theres a major battle with machineguns at the climax. The most violent of the series to date, which was itself much more inclined toward violent death than most of the rival mystery series of the 1930s and 1940s. 4/24/07\n\nThink Fast, Mr. Moto (1937)\n\nThank You, Mr. Moto (1937)\n\nThese were the first two of eight films to star Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto, based on the novels by John P. Marquand. The first opens with a disguised Moto attempting to sell a stolen jewel to a shady shop keeper, an arrangement broken up by the intercession of a policeman. Undisguised he books passage on a luxury ship and gets trapped into attending a party being held for the son of the owner of the liner. A variety of subplots unfold aboard ship, including Motos awareness that one of the crew is a murderer, whom he throws overboard in retribution. The unsophisticated son of the magnate is romantically involved with a woman, who is apparently an agent for a crook. Theres a smuggling ring involved and attempts are made, unsuccessfully, to kill Moto. A lot happens in a rush at the end, but a fairly intricate story is well resolved.\n\nTheres a fragmented treasure map leading to the hoarded wealth of Genghis Khan in the second. Moto is in Beijing, mixing with diplomats and spies, one of whom is particularly interested in the missing parts of the map, six scrolls held by an ancient Chinese family who refuse to part with them. When the importuning diplomat is found dead, the logical suspect is the impoverished Chinese aristocrat whom he was attempting to pressure, but it was actually Moto who killed him, to prevent a different murder. A crooked antiquities dealer (John Carradine) helped to steal the seventh scroll, but he is killed before Moto can get him to identify his employer. A nice bit of intrigue and Lorre is great in the part. 4/23/07\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n\nYes, I know I should have watched this one a long time ago, but I was oblivious when it first appeared and it slipped through the cracks afterward. The good side of that is that I bought the brand new DVD for a ridiculously low price. In a magical version of ancient China, a warrior plans to surrender the Green Destiny, the sword he has used in many past battles, in order to mark his break with a violent past. Chow Yun Fat plays the warrior and Michelle Yeoh his friend and partner in a quest to recover the sword when it is stolen. The thief is transparently the young noblewoman we have met shortly before, a frustrated romantic who is being forced into a marriage of convenience. She and Yeoh have one of those stylized, magical fight and flight scenes in which they defy time and gravity.\n\nThe plot thickens with the revelation that a famous thief and killer, Jade Fox, has been residing within the governors household, but a battle with her has unexpected results when the thief intervenes, using martial skills that suggest she has been trained by some unknown master. Michelle Yeoh uses a clever test to prove to herself that the bride-to-be is in fact the masked warrior. There is an extensive flashback in which we discover her relationship to a desert bandit, apparently her true love though their relationship is rather stormy. She disappears from her wedding chamber, apparently to be with him again and the two warriors set out to find her, in order to locate Jade Fox. Some wonderfully choreographed swordfights  one of my weaknesses  and an intricate and fascinating plot. 4/22/07\n\nRobots (2005)\n\nIm not usually a big fan of animation. I hadnt even watched an episode of South Park until last year and I still havent seen The Simpsons. Animation has changed so much over the past few years, however, that Ive started watching selective films and great movies like Shrek and Monsters Inc. have gradually changed my attitude. And this one has robots, so how could I resist.\n\nIn a world of robots, a young couple decide to assemble a baby robot. Twelve hours of labor but it was worth it. The kid is a bit older by the time the credits are done, and the jokes have already come thick and fast already. The young robot is inspired by a business magnate, Big Weld, to become an inventor but his early efforts go predictably awry. In due course he travels to Robot City looking for a job and discovers that the image he remembers from childhood has changed to a closed system not interested in new ideas.\n\nThe plot doesnt matter a whole lot. Big Weld has been supplanted by a young robot, directed by his devilish mother, who want to stop making replacement parts and force everyone to upgrade. Our young hero is instrumental in foiling the plot and bringing back Big Weld. The animation is great, of course, as weve come to expect, but the backgrounds and settings are a lot of the charm, detailed, crisp, inventive, and colorful. The frequent Star Wars references are also amusing. Voices by Mel Brooks, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Amanda Bynes, and others. This is one youll want to watch more than once because theres so much going on you cant possibly see it all in a single sitting. Fun for kids of all ages, six to six hundred. 4/21/07\n\nTerry and the Pirates Volume 4 (1952)\n\nFour more light weight stories of intrigue and adventure. In Chinese Coffin, Terry is supposed to transport the coffin bearing the body of a prominent financier, but the man who arranged the shipment is a conman who says he wants the Dragon Lady to steal the coffin and ransom it back to the family. Terry smells a rat and eventually recovers the booty, which proves to hold no body at all, and exposes the con. In a nice touch, the man who was supposed to be in the coffin has a heart attack and ends up in it after all. Deadly Species anticipates the recent film, Snakes on a Plane. Its another of the better episodes, with a murdered stowaway who turns out to be an undercover agent, missing crates, the Dragon Lady in another plot, captures and escapes and ultimately revelations.\n\nBurma, a recurring character normally working as a night club performer, is investigating criminals and gets into trouble, so she stows away on Terrys plane in Extra Cargo, while the Dragon Lady is in hot pursuit. Theres also an assassination attempt and an abduction, though the action is comparatively slow moving this time. Finally we have The Maitland Affair, which involves the theft of a cargo of contaminated rice and abduction of an inspector to allow its sale. The Dragon Lady comes across as admirable this time, repeating a recurring theme that she wasnt as bad as she seemed, although at other times she seems indifferent to the taking of human life. All in all, this is the best of the four available selections from this show. 4/21/07\n\nCaptain Video (1951)\n\nCaptain Video is a superhero who lives in a kind of Fortress of Solitude, helped by a group of assistants called Video Rangers scattered around the world who function as his version of the Baker Street Irregulars. His super-scientific devices come in handy when he has to fight crime, or more dangerous menaces. One of the Rangers is being pursued by criminals working for Dr. Tobor (spell it backwards) who is plotting for world domination. Using scientific doubletalk at breakneck speed, Captain Video uses devices designed to eavesdrop on the conversations taking place in moving cards, a remote viewer, an x-ray spy device, and a jetmobile. All of this takes place in less than the first five minutes!\n\nHe eventually subdues one of the henchmen with his cosmic vibrator, an oversized hand weapon that hums. Still in the first installment, we see miniaturized radio transmitters, an electronic wave detector, a projector that remotely stops automobile engines, a cloak of invisibility, a paralysis ray gun, an electric ray weapon, a weather control device, matter transmission, and a few other gadgets. Tobors men try to rescue their captured companion, but Captain Video anticipates them. Meanwhile, someone is tampering with the weather, causing storms of unprecedented intensity. Captain Video traces the interference to Dr. Tobors laboratory and decides to confront him. It is possible that these disturbances could be caused by forces from another planet. An interesting leap of logic, but hes right.\n\nTobor contacts Vultura, dictator of the planet Atoma, his secret ally who plans to conquer the Earth. Tobor boards the interplanetary space projectile, which is a bad cartoon when in flight. The scenes on planet Atoma are tinted red rather than the usual black and white, which is as close as this comes to being innovative. Vultura is at war with yet another planet, and every scene that takes place there is tinted green. Captain Video also has a spaceship, fortunately, so he and one of his rangers (always called Ranger) launch in a clip identical to the one showing the launch of one of Vulturas warships, en route to Atoma although theyve never heard of it before. Vultura also has a squad of the funniest looking robots Ive ever seen (they have metal top hats and skirts), even though his guards carry spears. Their ship is endangered by a pair of remotely controlled comets, also cartoons, which is a problem because the spaceship cant change course at this speed. All of this in Chapter 1 and there are fourteen more to go!!!\n\nVarious adventures in space result in Vulturas immediate plot being foiled so he turns his attention to Earth and initiates a series of natural disasters. Despite their suspicions of Tobor, they allow him to roam about unsupervised in their headquarters, with predictable sabotage resulting. More clashes on Earth follow, with Tobor still evading detection, but never quite succeeding either. Captain Video always has a device that enables him to bypass a problem, whether it be a heat ray to neutralize a freezing ray, or a mind reading device to discover secret codes. They return to Atoma where they discover that fire has no effect on their bodies because of their different chemical properties. Thanks to the cosmic vibrator, those guards never knew what jarred them.\n\nTheres a falling out between Vultura and Tobor, the latter of whom has just developed a disintegrator ray. The plot gets sillier and the science stupider. Captain Video is thrown off a space platform, so they use one machine to increase the Earths gravity in order to guide him down, then cushion the stop with a sonic air cushion. Another device allows them to take pictures of people who arent in the room any longer by interpreting the vibrations they left behind. The villains eventually get their comeuppance, thanks to the psychosomatic weapons developed by Captain Video.\n\nAn interesting sidelight is that there is not a single female actress in any of the fifteen chapters. Everyone on both of the alien planets speaks English and both planets are located in our solar system, which is apparently two billion light years wide. Captain Video was previously a comic book and a television program but there is little similarity between them and this cliffhanger. One of the silliest and worst acted of the serials, but it is frequently funny for exactly that reason. 4/20/07\n\nMirrorMask (2005)\n\nThis unusual fantasy film was written by Neil Gaiman so its not surprising that its clever, witty, and intelligent. A young girl, Helen, working in a carnival is unhappy with what she perceives as the difficulties of her life and longs to run away to the real world, as opposed to running away with a circus. During one performance, her mother collapses, adding another level of pressure to her life, and shortly thereafter she finds herself in an altered version of the world, filled with magical creatures and odd characters. This is the dream world, a combination of CGI effects and live action.\n\nIn this other reality, which clearly parallels our own, the queen (her mother) is magically incapacitated and Helen also has a counterpart. A mysterious doom hangs over the world and Helen has to save the day by finding a specific charm. There follows a kind of grand magical tour like that of Labyrinth or The Wizard of Oz, but with a very distinctive artistic style (thanks to Dave McKean) and much cleverer dialogue. They follow a series of clues in order to reach their goal, confront the black queen, bring her doppelganger back where she belongs, and save the day. The visuals and the story are nicely balanced; when youre not caught up in the scenery and effects, youre engage by the interplay among the characters. I can understand why this had a limited theatrical release, but it would be a shame if it doesnt reach the many viewers who would enjoy it. 4/19/07\n\nThe Last Starfighter (1999)\n\nThis is one of those movies that seemed better in retrospect than it was when I actually decided to watch it again. Alex is a young man obsessed with arcade games and the need to get out of his trailer park, so hes a prime candidate for alien abduction to fight in an interstellar battle that requires very similar skills. The abductor, Centauri, comes in a spaceship that looks like a fancy car, asking for the identity of the person who broke the record on a video game, runs off with Alex and leaves a rather imperfect duplicate in his place. Okay but unexceptional special effects as they travel to a base on a distant planet while his girlfriend back on Earth deals with the replacement.\n\nAlex finds himself among a group of alien recruits, all of which are rubber faced humanoids, but given the less than serious tone, the corny costumes seem right in place. The bad guys, apparently led by a renegade although he is actually just a tool, are threatening to overwhelm the good guys, but Alex just wants to go home. While hes en route, the base is destroyed by treachery and all of the starfighters except Alex are killed.\n\nAlex and his duplicate have an amusing encounter, but a bad alien has arrived, hunting for Alex. Centauri returns, kills the assassin, and convinces Alex that he has to return to the stars or risk luring more of the killers to Earth. Accompanied by a reptilian friend, Alex sets off in his ship to battle the alien armada  singlehanded. Back on Earth, his double is preparing to fend off alien hitmen. CGI space battles follow, and a number of shots and screen elements are clearly copied directly from the Star Wars movies. Through a subterfuge, they avoid the main enemy fleet and target the command ship and you can pretty well figure out what happens from here. Amusing and inoffensive, but theres not much depth or charm to this one. Theres a big inconsistency at the end when Alex and his alien friend visit Earth and everyone there can understand him without wearing a translator. 4/18/07\n\nPick Me Up (2006)\n\nAnother installment in the Masters of Horror series from cable television, this one directed by Larry Cohen, the source of a large number of B horror films, and based on a 1991 short story by David J. Schow, one of my favorite horror writers. Two separate maniacs have intersecting, and complementary, careers in this one. The first is a truck driver who has a habit of killing people who take him up on the offer of a ride; the second a hitchhiker who likes to murder the people who stop for him. When a bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere, several people fall into their sphere. Michael Moriarty is his usual charming self as the homicidal trucker; Warren Kole is the ambulatory serial killer.\n\nIn short order, the only survivor is Fairuka Balk, who left the others to hike to a motel. The two killers now know about each other but their paths have not directly crossed. Balk, unfortunately, is less fortunate, ends up in a room next to Kole and his most recent victim, and who should show up shortly afterward to rent the other adjacent room but Moriarty. The killers subsequently meet and recognize each others nature, and a bizarre little mind game ensues. The set up is pretty good, but the pacing slips a bit even though technically quite a bit happens. Balk leaves the motel and is picked up by Moriarty, and we learn that he considers Kole a poacher. After revealing himself to Balk, he picks up Kole and the final confrontation is set to unroll. The mildly surprising ending youll have to see for yourself. One of the weaker entries in the series despite the good story line and acting. 4/17/07\n\nTerry and the Pirates Volume 3 (1952)\n\nAnother four episodes of one of my favorite childhood television shows. Terry is a commercial pilot working for shady Chinese businessman Chopstick Joe, usually involved in a conflict with the likable villain, the Dragon Lady. Compound C3 Theft is the usual mixture of humor and adventure. This time part of the cargo on a recent flight is some stolen military explosives disguised as a string of sausage. Chopstick discovers the truth but cannot reach the plane by radio. Terry and his sidekick Hotshot are captured by a band of criminals, but the situation is complicated by the fact that Hotshot ate some of the explosive. They use this to bluff the bad guys, but of course he didnt really eat the explosives and theyre in hot water again. Hotshot is the focus of the problem again in Diplomatic Passport when a thief puts a dead mans passport in his pocket, hoping to retrieve it later.\n\nThe Dragon Lady takes a more active role in Little Mandarin, sending her fighter planes after Terrys ship because one of his passengers is the young son of a local warlord. After the usual complications, they outsmart her, rescue the kid, and make their escape in an ok but not scintillating adventure. Last up was The Randall Affair, which involves a treasure hunt. The story takes too long to develop and is the weakest of this set. Yes, its a kids show and mostly interesting as an exercise in nostalgia, but there was also a kind of naïve optimism about programs of this type that give them lasting charm. 4/17/07\n\nThe Black Widow (1947)\n\nSax Rohmer was robbed for this one, which is transparently stolen from the Fu Manchu books. An Asian supergenius, Hitomu (who doesnt look remotely Asian), sends his daughter Sombra (who doesnt look remotely Asian) to the United States to steal military and scientific secrets, with which he hopes to dominate the world. She is equipped with a variety of mechanical and electronic devices to further her ends, and in the opening chapter we discover that she has already murdered several people using spider poison, hence the title. A mystery novelist and a feisty female reporter are investigating the murders, unaware of the more sinister plot that lurks behind the killings.\n\nAlmost by chance, the two investigators stumble into Sombras fortune telling parlor on their very first try. Due to the incredible incompetence of one of Sombras underlings, they find evidence linking the last victim to the site. Sombra gets orders from her father, who appears in some sort of mystical teleportation, to secure the secret of a new atomic rocket fuel. Through a ruse, the scientists assistant is kidnapped and Sombra impersonates her and steals the formula, which is hidden in a tube of explosive gas. The villains have this neat car that can repaint itself a different color while its moving and they use this ploy to fool their pursuers.\n\nFrustrated by her inability to open the tube, Sombra continues the impersonation, hoping to learn the secret. She is successful, but the neutralizing gas is available from only one company. Entanglements, fist fights, chases, ambushes, and subterfuges follow, including the inevitable car chase, although this time its the good guy trying to warn the reporter that theres an explosive in her car. Much of the action results from obvious stupidity on the part of our heroes, and one does wonder what happened to the government, which seems unconcerned with the potential loss of military secrets and equipment. Even the police seem to have disappeared from the world, leaving the reporter and the writer to battle alone. In fact, the newspapers routinely print sensitive information which, naturally, the Black Widow and her allies read. At one point, our hero gets a clue that the Black Widow is a fortune teller, and it never occurs to him to go immediately to the fortune teller where he found the first clue to the murders!\n\nThe dialogue is pretty bad, stilted and corny, and theres even one point where one of the characters uses ingenuous when he means ingenious. When the disguised Black Widow is arrested, even though they know shes in disguise, they decide to find out which fortune teller is missing rather than simply remove her disguise. And they lock her up without taking away her bag, which contains a communication device. The plot stumbles its way to a conclusion with both Sombra and her father apprehended, their henchman eliminated, and the military secrets safe once again. Not one of the better serials. 4/16/07\n\nThe Prestige (2006)\n\nThe novel by Christopher Priest, upon which this is based, was one of my all time favorites, so I approached this movie with some trepidation despite the good reviews. The opening sequences, though beautifully filmed, are a bit difficult to follow, I suspect even more so if you arent familiar with the book, and the movie jumps around among three different time frames from that point onward. A stage magician is murdered and another is found guilty of the crime. We then travel back through time to find out what caused the animosity.\n\nBorden and Angier are two aspiring late 19th Century stage magicians, friends initially, who work in tandem with an engineer named Cutter (Michael Caine) who designs their tricks. Borden is impatient, wanting something entirely new, even if it means taking risks, while Angier is more cautious. Borden alters a trick involving Angiers wife as a result of which she dies a tragic death, thereby ending the friendship and starting a string of increasingly nasty efforts to sabotage each others act. These scenes alternate with a later sequence in which Angier attempts to convince Nikola Tesla to build him a duplicate of a device he previously created for another magician. His early encounter convinces him that Tesla has stumbled on real magic, rather than technology. Borden is also interested in Teslas work, which intensifies their rivalry.\n\nBorden begins performing a new trick in which he enters one cabinet and emerges from another in plain sight and much too quickly to involve a journey under the stage. Cutter insists that hes using a double, but Angier is convinced that it is the same man entering and leaving. They decide to duplicate his trick, but to do so, they need to find a double for Angier. It works, but Angier isnt satisfied because he still doesnt know how Borden manages the same effect without using a double. To this end, he asks his assistant to quit and take a job with Borden in order to steal his secret, but she tells Borden the truth.\n\nThe sabotage continues on a grander scale. It is only then that Angier realizes that he is more interested in Bordens secret than in avenging his wife. Borden adds Teslas visual pyrotechnics to his show, but are they responsible or just window dressing? And elsewhen, Angier is given a demonstration that boggles his mind. I cant say much more about the plot without revealing the multiple surprises, but trust me, your head will be spinning before its over. An excellent adaptation of a superb novel. 4/15/07\n\nThe Jack Benny Show Volume 4 (1953)\n\nFour episodes of the Jack Benny comedy show, starting with one dominated by a New Years skit thats considerably below his usual quality level. The second episode is considerably better, no monologue but some good jokes sprinkled throughout the show. Theres also a nice dose of Rochester, one of my favorite supporting actors. Mary Livingston, Bennys wife in the real world, plays his girlfriend and in this episode Jack has a dream of married life with their relationship considerably different. More jokes about Jacks legendary cheapness, some of them still funny. The remaining two episodes are similarly undistinguished. Theres a fairly amusing bit about a really cheap suit which Jack wears, and wears out, during a musical number with Giselle MacKenzie. The musical number itself is pretty good. Last comes a skit about the theft of Jacks car and his experiences at the local police station. The jokes about the classiness of the Beverly Hills police would be echoed years later by Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop movies, but theyre actually funnier here. 4/14/07\n\nFeast (2006)\n\nThis low budget horror film has an amusing opening. Were introduced to each of the characters by a freeze frame and textual overlay that includes commentaries on their life expectancy in the film, not quite up to the savvy self analysis of the Scream movies but still way ahead of most of these direct to video releases, which take themselves entirely too seriously. Theyre all drinking or working in a seedy bar apparently in the middle of nowhere one night when bad things start happening. Dont be fooled, however. They lie.\n\nThe hero arrives almost immediately, followed by toothy monsters who kill him in the middle of his rousing speech and deal considerable carnage within a couple of minutes. Theres blood and gore aplenty, mixed with a couple of visual jokes before the initial attack is done and the siege is underway. The plot confounds expectations. The cute kid gets gobbled up early on, and the man drowned in slime doesnt dissolve. More insanity follows. Monster tongue stuck in the door! The motivational speaker was probably my favorite character. The blood and gore  even though its comic  will turn off many even though its so over the top that its not remotely believable. If you can get past that, this is a surprisingly good spoof of modern monster movies. 4/13/07\n\nPelts (2006)\n\nI became an instant fan of Dario Argento when I saw two of his films many years ago, Suspiria and Creepers (aka Phenomena), although Ive been more or less disappointed with most of his subsequent work. This is one he did for the Masters of Horror cable television series, based on the story by F. Paul Wilson. A father and son harvest trapped raccoons from traps they planted among ruins in a part of the woods that most people avoid. They plan to sell the pelts, which are of unusually high quality, to another man who is incidentally obsessed with a local stripper. Sounds like trouble brewing.\n\nSure enough, the son brutally murders his father that very night, our first clear suggestion that possession of the pelts is a curse. Then the son commits suicide by bear trap and the pelts pass into the hands of the lustful dealer. He wants to make a coat for the stripper to wear, but the first one of his employees to work on the pelts later uses a pair of shears on his own body. Another worker sews his eyes, nose, and mouth shut and suffocates. Finally the coat is finished and the stripper falls under the spell, promising anything in order to keep it, after which our repulsive protagonist skins himself alive. It would have been more effective if any of the characters involved had been even remotely likable, but theyre all pretty horrible and deserve everything that happens to them. 4/13/07\n\nMr. & Mrs. North Volume 8 (1954)\n\nFour episodes from the 1950s mystery show featuring Gerry and Pam North, who keep falling into mysterious situations. In Busy Signal, a change of telephone number gets them into trouble with bookies, double crosses, and murder. The byplay with crossed telephone lines and mistaken identities makes this one of the best of their adventures. They cross paths with a confidence man in Hot Mink, and although the plot is advanced by a rather large coincidence, its still better than average. Theres murder at a birthday party in Surprise. One of the guests is knifed while the lights are out and the murder weapon is missing. Not one of the better installments; the murderers identity is obvious even before it is revealed and his attempts to cover up the crime are ludicrous at best. The Norths befriend a woman accused of murder in Suspected, and outwit an avaricious heir and a disreputable journalist to clear her name. The half hour format limits the plots to simple story lines, but at its best the program presented interesting puzzles, and these four are among their better efforts. 4/12/07\n\nFlash Gordon (1936)\n\nBuster Crabbe did three Flash Gordon serials. Id already seen the other two so I had a pretty good idea what to expect from this one, the first in the series. Earth is subjected to a series of natural disasters thanks to the approach of the planet Mongo, home of Ming the Merciless. The story opens with astronomers concluding that the two planets will collide and both will be destroyed, but Dr. Zharkov believes otherwise and is determined to prove it. Quite by chance, Flash and Dale Arden bail out of a damaged airplane and land beside Zharkovs experimental spaceship, then decide to become his crew as he sets off to try to deal with the wild planet. Their trip is successful and they land on a barren world populated by giant lizards and, fortunately, a breathable atmosphere.\n\nThey are promptly captured by Mings soldiers, who speak English, of course. Ming is planning the conquest of Earth, but he immediately falls for Dale and condemns Flash to the arena. Mings daughter, however, has simultaneously become infatuated with Flash, and when she intervenes, the two of them are plunged into a pit but escape. Flash is off (in the charmingly cornball spaceship) to join Mings enemies while Mings daughter is off to kill Dale Arden and remove her rival. Some of the sets in Mings palace are surprisingly good and the lobster monster is good for quite a few laughs. There are quite a few interesting if not particularly convincing models revealed during the course of the film including ray guns and other futuristic equipment, an animated statue, the submarine used by the Shark Men, and others.\n\nThe king of the hawk men, Voltan, deliciously overplays his part as a villain while the other actors utter such memorable lines as Our resisto force will soon be overpowered by those melting rays. Dales skimpy outfit attracts more evil admirers as well as Flash, and Mings daughter doesnt react well to being second best. More battles follow, sword fights, a duel with a cross between a gorilla and a unicorn called an orangopoid, and some really awful specials effects involving a floating city. Dale gets to do a lot of screaming and fainting. At the mystic midnight hour the fire monster will be asleep and only the sacred gong can rouse him. They just dont write great stuff like that any more. This whole thing was a lot of fun if you are capable of not only suspended your disbelief but of sending it off on a separate vacation. 4/11/07\n\nMacGyver Season 7\n\nI never saw a single episode of this show when it was being televised, and about five months ago I started watching the first series. It took that long to watch the first six seasons because although most of the episodes have a pretty good formula, its the same formula. This is the seventh, and last season, truncated to only 14 episodes rather than the usual 22. MacGyver uses his ingenuity to get out of traps, foil criminals, steal secrets, help people in trouble, and so forth. Originally he worked for the government, reporting to Dana Elcar, but they both switched to the Phoenix Foundation somewhere along the way. There were a few other recurring characters including his arch-nemesis Murdock, who returns from the dead with alarming frequency, a disreputable pilot/adventurer, the staff of a community youth center, a scatterbrained young woman with a penchant for getting into trouble, a cantankerous grandfather who dies in the fifth season, and a young girl who frequently needs to be rescued. There were signs that the writers began to tire of the formula as well, with episodes in which MacGyver dreamed that he was back in the Old West.\n\nAnyway, season 7 opens with a pretty obvious self parody, Honest Abe. MacGyver gets involved with a semi-rogue CIA agent who steals a stealth helicopter in order to kidnap a South American dictator he helped put in power. The supporting cast is actually pretty good in this one, but not enough to save what was obviously never meant to be taken seriously in the first place. The Hood is a little more typical, although it involves our hero giving up his houseboat (thanks to a fire) and moving to new digs. One of his new neighbors overhears a criminal conspiracy and is pursued by a pair of killers, so MacGyver is off to the rescue. This ones a bit contrived and only works because the various characters fail to call the police when they should. The fake voodoo scene is particularly corny. MacGyver begins to dream that his old enemy Murdock is still alive in Obsessed and Pete puts his reputation on the line when he refuses to inactivate him. Pete was played by Dana Elcar, who began to lose his vision during season 6, which handicap was subsequently written into the script. No one else believes Murdock is alive, but of course he is, until he gets killed again. The Prometheus Syndrome pits our hero against a serial arsonist, but the plot suffers from some very clumsy dialogue, a contrived obtuseness on the part of the fire inspector in charge of the case, although the identity of the arsonist is surprising.\n\nThe Colton brothers, bounty hunters who appeared in several earlier episodes, return to hunt down a witness to a murder in Chinatown in The Coltons, with MacGyver making little more than a token appearance. The surprise revelation of the man secretly working for the crooks isnt much of a surprise. Theres a nasty voodoo priest in Walking Dead, so one of MacGyvers new neighbors, the voodoo priestess, gets a major part in this one. Our hero gets partially zombified but eventually unmasks the Haitian criminals posing as Baron Samedi and company. Theres another surprise revelation that was obvious early on. Good Knight MacGyver is a two parter, and further evidence that the writers were getting tired. Knocked unconscious, MacGyver finds himself in Camelot just in time to save Sir Galahads life and meet King Arthur (Dana Elcar). There he discovers that his ancestor is believed to be in league with Morgan Le Fay. Merlin declares that he must be a sorcerer because he claims to know the future but eventually becomes his unhappy ally when Sir Duncan frames him for an attempt to murder Arthur. They rescue a prisoner from Morgana and end the threat of her revolutionary new weapon. A fairly entertaining version of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court.\n\nHenry Gibson does a great job in Deadly Silents as a silent film star who wants MacGyver to help him recover his collection of old films, stolen by armed men. This is another self referential spoof, but a reasonably clever one. Split Decision is more serious, bringing back Dick Butkus, an ex-con who turned his life around in an earlier episode and who now wants custody of his daughter, but who gets involved with a fixed prize fight. Bubba Smith is a henchman, always a treat for me because I knew him slightly back in my college days. Sarah Koskoff, whom Id never heard of, does a great job as the daughter. Gunz n Boyz is another episode involving street gangs and the Challenger Center, with an ex-gang member accused of murder until MacGyver finds the real killer. Not one of the more stellar episodes. Oversimplified, preachy, and implausible.\n\nThe social commentary continues in the livelier but still unrealistic Off the Wall, pitting MacGyver against developers who force poor people out of an apartment building that doesnt mean minimal standards. The fact is, they should have been evicted given the horrible living conditions, which invalidates much of the plot. Even making allowances for that, MacGyver agrees to meet, alone, the same man whose minions tried to kill him only a day earlier, with no safeguards and taking a young kid with him. He arrives to find the caller dead, designed to look like an accident. By this point, it was obvious the writers were just going through the motions. The Mountain of Youth (nice title) brings back his recurring buddy, Jack Dalton, with another hair brained scheme, this one to find the fountain of youth in Asia. They end up defending some independent mountain people from a band of nasty government soldiers guarding a secret heavy water plant in this okay but unexceptional episode. The remote, primitive mountain people all speak unaccented English, of course. The final episode was The Stringer (although two made for tv movies followed later on). MacGyver is trying to expose illegal labor camps in China when he meets a young man who turns out to be his illegitimate son. Its one of the better episodes and probably the best of the final season. Likeable as the show was, it very nearly overstayed its welcome. 4/9/07\n\nThe Illusionist (2006)\n\nThis unusual blend of suspense and alternate history is set in Vienna during the time of Prince Leopold, son of Queen Victoria. Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is a stage magician who is arrested in the opening scene for crimes against the state, the nature of which we do not immediately learn. Instead, we witness a recap of the mans youth, his discovery of the art of magic (though whether real or trickery we are not quite sure), and his friendship with a young noblewoman whose family disapproves of the familiarity of the couple. They run away together, but not very successfully. Years later, now known as Eisenheim, he returns to Vienna and gives extraordinary performances as a stage illusionist. One evening, Prince Leopolds presumed fiancé volunteers to participate in one of his effects, and thence the plot thickens.\n\nThe tension builds slowly as we learn that Leopold is prone to beating women, and receive confirmation that the young woman, Sophie (Jessica Biel), is in fact his childhood love. Perhaps because of this, he is driven to irritate Leopold during a private performance, and the angry prince orders the police to shut down his show and drive him from the city. He has more reason than he realizes, because Eisenheim and Sophie are driven into each others arms by the mini-crisis. Sophie informs a drunken Leopold that she will not marry him. Enraged, he pursues her and the next day her dead body is found in the river.\n\nEisenheim buys a theater and changes his act, now acting as a spiritualist. Leopold wants him arrested and applies pressure, but the spirits he conjures onto stage seem to be genuinely supernatural. Fortunately for Eisenheim, he has attracted a large, popular following that partially protects him from governmental oppression. One night, Leopold appears incognito in the theater and Eisenheim conjures Sophies ghost, who accused Leopold of killing her. Finally the police attempt to arrest him during his next performance, with surprising results. Edward Norton is superb as the magician, and the supporting cast are all excellent. I guessed what was really going on but I almost think it works better knowing the truth. 4/9/07\n\nSpy Smasher (1942)\n\nIt felt like time for another serial. This one was released in 1942, so unsurprisingly the bad guys are Nazis. The Spy Smasher is a costumed hero based on a comic strip series who, in the opening sequence, is caught by the Nazis in occupied France, whipped in a Gestapo dungeon, but who refuses to admit that he works for the US government even when he is sentenced to death. He has been trying to track down his arch enemy, the Mask, a Nazi superspy. He escapes death thanks to a subterfuge by a French officer and subsequently returns to the US. We also learn that he has a twin brother and that he faked his own death some time before in order to more effectively function as a spy. The possibilities for mistaken identities and, conversely, a verifiable secret identity are obvious.\n\nThe plot moves very quickly even for a cliffhanger. During the first chapter alone, we have the battle with the Nazis, a fistfight on a train, an attack by a gang of thugs on the home of the twin brothers fiancé with subsequent gunfight (her father happens to have a mine chart in his safe), mistaken identity, a secret Nazi submarine landing on the American coast to offload counterfeit money, some clandestine eavesdropping and another fistfight at a secret base, a boat chase with guns blazing, and finally a desperate flight through a mine tunnel to escape a flash fire. And we still have 11 chapters to go!!\n\nSpy Smasher is back in France for more fights, chases on horseback through a landscape that looks more like the American west, and encounters with almost comically inept Nazis and their stooges. One has to wonder why a spy, who presumably wants to avoid being noticed, would wear goggles and a cape, but its probably some mysterious spy stuff I never knew about. The usual hijinx follow, back in France for a while, then back to the US. I cant figure out why the Mask was necessary, since the villain reveals his true identity in chapter three (and its revealed in the credits as well). The Nazi agents try to steal military secrets using a futuristic flying machine, but our masked and cloaked hero thwarts them again. Just once Id like to see the hero get the drop on someone and not have the gun knocked out of his hand, precipitating a fistfight.\n\nSubsequent sequences involve the kidnapping of a military officer (who doesnt seem to ever wear a uniform), a plot to reveal Spy Smashers real identity, a ray gun that knocks planes out of the air, a car chase, and naturally a collection of last minute escapes from near death. 4/8/07\n\nTamara (2005)\n\nAnother teenaged revenge story borrowing heavily from Carrie at the beginning, and also another one where the teenagers are all played by actors in their twenties. Tamara was never popular to start with, but when her paper on teenaged drug use becomes public just as the school suspends several athletes, shes the target of abuse and eventually a fatal prank. But Tamara practiced witchcraft, and shes back from the dead and looking for a little payback, although since she wasnt above trying to curse the wife of the teacher she has a crush on, its hard to be entirely sympathetic. Theres the usual  we didnt kill her it was an accident  conversation and the conspirators, including two innocents who were dragged into it without knowing what was going on, dispose of the body.\n\nThe next day, Tamara is back in school, self confident and sexy, much to the consternation of the conspirators. She also has the power to make anyone do anything she wants merely by touching them, a bit of omnipotence that takes most of the suspense out of the film. She forces one to commit suicide with a razor, another to become a compulsive eater, two jocks to have sex together, and her father to eat broken glass. Unlike most horror films released direct to DVD, the acting is reasonably good, the dialogue isnt awful, the special effects are minimal but convincing, and the plot moves crisply and logically given the initial premise. It would have been better if there had been narrower and more discreet limits to Tamaras powers. As it is, her eventual defeat is unconvincing. And why do the fugitives always end up on the roof? 4/8/07\n\nThe Last Stand (2006)\n\nAlthough I was a Marvel Comics fan for many years, X-Men ranked right with Doctor Strange as the least interesting title in their line for me, and the first two movies didnt do much to rehabilitate them for me, particularly since Wolverine was probably my least favorite of the X-Men. So I didnt go see this in the theaters and havent watched the DVD until today. After a couple of brief flashbacks, were back with the usual crew and the usual animosities, as tiring in the film as they were in the comics. Jeanne is still dead  killed last time  but we know shes going to be back because shes in the credits.\n\nA drug company has come up with a cure for mutation, disabusing us of any notion that the writers are scientifically literate. Obviously this causes a crisis in the mutant community and Magneto is quick to capitalize on the growing fear. Theres also a young boy with the ability to temporarily suppress mutant characteristics in others, obviously the source of the supposed cure. Sure enough, Jeanne is restored to life with a little help from Cyclops, and pretty much no explanation, and all the pieces are in place for the battle to come. Paradoxically, although a lot happens in a short period of time, it seems very drawn out, the individual scenes either too long or their meaning too murky, although Magnetos ambush of the convoy is nicely done.\n\nThings finally start to pick up when Jeanne, corrupted by her power, becomes the Phoenix and apparently kills Cyclops and Xavier, leader of the X-Men, then joins Magneto and the evil mutants. Most of the mutant powers are well done, but Juggernaut is unconvincing. The final battle is full of nice special effects, but the plot is so dull and predictable that it was hard to remain interested. This wont do anything to improve my interest in this particular subset of Marvel, and I suspect it will also be the last of the movies. 4/7/07\n\nThe Buccaneers Volume 2 (1956)\n\nFour more episodes of this kids adventure story featuring Robert Shaw as reformed pirate Dan Tempest in the Caribbean. Before the Mast involves a plot by Spanish pirates to impress several British sailors and attack a supply ship. Shaw impersonates one of their number to find out the details of their plans while a young boy over zealously attempts to help. Eventually they both sabotage the pirate ship and escape. In Conquistador Tempest and his friends are captured by another Spanish pirate, who frames them for a series of attacks. Captain Dan Tempest was the first episode in which Shaw appeared. Through a technicality, he isnt covered by the general pardon for pirates and he is arrested. The governor puts him on furlough and tries to reform him, leading to an unlikely confrontation with Blackbeard in which two men successfully fight off a pirate vessel. He also acquires a fiancé, although I dont think she ever showed up again. The Spanish conquer Tempests home island in Conquest of New Providence, and then capture most of Tempests crew as well. Roger Delgado makes a suitably sinister villain and the subsequent sword fighting melee isnt bad. A fair collection of light adventures stories. The rousing theme song is stuck in my head. 4/7/07\n\nZombies of the Stratosphere (1952)\n\nThis Republic serial has the best title of them all, and Leonard Nimoy has a bit part in it as well, playing one of the aliens who have come to Earth to knock it out of orbit with a hydrogen bomb and make room for Mars. Theyre not zombies though, despite the title. Rocket Man, like Commando Cody, has an individual flying suit which he uses during the not too bad flying sequences. The aliens land and contact their human allies  crooks no doubt  then take off again before our hero can arrive. The spaceship is also borrowed, right out of the Flash Gordon serials.\n\nThe conflict begins as the Martians and their human allies attempt to build the bomb. No telling why they didnt just bring one with them in their ship. The villains try to hijack a train full of uranium but are foiled because there just happens to be an operational tank (!) at the railroad station, which our hero knows how to drive (!!), and which can travel as fast as a speeding locomotive (!!!). There are some pretty good cliffhangers in the first few installments of this one including a train running off a collapsed bridge, a motor boat going over a dam, a car driven over a cliff, dropped into the ocean chained to a weight, and a runaway coal shuttle in a mine shaft. Lots of speedboat sequences as well, a nice switch from the usual car chases.\n\nThwarted in their quest for uranium, the conspirators have also run out of money, so they build a remote controlled robot (a pretty silly one) to rob banks, smash things up, and menace the good guys and the heroine. It lumbers around for awhile until they eventually electrocute it. The next effort to smuggle in uranium is aboard a submarine, so our heroes requisition some depth charges (!), attack it without identifying the vessel as unfriendly (!!), and manage to sink it with their second charge (!!!), which they launch from a speedboat (!!!!). Unfortunately, while theyre doing that, other henchmen kidnap their female colleague, but only for a little while. More near death experiences follow, but in the end the collaborators are identified, the bomb is disarmed, and the Martians are foiled. I particularly enjoyed the sequence where our hero stands easily on top of a hurtling rocket without even having his hair tousled. Nimoy is the Martian who turns coat and tells the hero how to save the world, so I guess he deserved to be reborn as a Vulcan. In the closing moments, we first hear the Martians referred to as zombies, for no apparent reason. Good title though. 4/6/07\n\nTerry and the Pirates Volume 2 (1953)\n\nTheres a healthy dose of the Dragon Lady as chief villain in all four episodes in this installment of the popular 1950s kids adventure show. Terry and Hotshot are pilots working for Chopsticks Joe, a Chinese businessman whose business can be found on either side of the law. In Black Market for Death, a plague has affected a remote area of China and when Terry flies in the serum to treat it, he has to thwart a gang of hijackers working at the behest of the Dragon Lady, who appears to be interested in hijacking the medicine for her own use but who turns out to be involved in a less dishonorable brand of criminality. The Dragon Lady helps a bandit leader cheat Chopstick Joe and coerces Terry and Hotshot to train pilots for him in Loaded Dice Affair, but they have to fight their way out when they discover they are prisoners. Two average episodes.\n\nDifferent actors fill in for Chopstick Joe and singer Burma in Macao, which involves a consignment of gold bullion and some fast paced double crossing. I was surprised by the substitutions because I believe the show lasted less than 20 installments. The Dragon Lady wants to steal the gold and kidnaps Hotshot to apply pressure. Keye Luke guest stars as a police official in one of the better episodes. Finally we have Tee Hee, in which the Dragon Ladys smuggling operation puts an innocent, elderly woman in jeopardy until Terry unmasks the plot. Surprisingly good for a kids show, and some of the fascination I felt for the Dragon Lady as a kid lingers yet.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006)\n\nI was never a particular fan of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, although I did recognize the powerful imagery in the movie. Frankly, during the second half the constant taunting of the imprisoned girl and the parade of grotesqueries became boring rather than horrifying. But it does have its following, and has spawned at least fur more movies including this latest, the prequel, which opens with an even more grotesque sequence, a woman giving birth in a slaughterhouse. Years pass and the slaughterhouse is closing, but that child  adopted informally and now an adult  seems to be disturbed by the loss. He, obviously, will later be known as Leatherface, the masked killer from the original film, and in short order he has committed his first murder and stolen a chainsaw.\n\nMeanwhile, two soldiers about to leave for Vietnam are on their last vacation trip with their girlfriends and obviously theyre about to cross paths with Leatherface. Theyre attacked by a biker, who is killed by Leatherfaces adopted father, now playing the part of sheriff. Three of the four are immediately captured by the crazy family, with only Jordana Brewster managing to hide. What follows is both predictable and redundant, a tepid rehash of the last film in the series, and since we know that the bad guys survive to kill again, theres not much point in hoping to see them get their just desserts. Add in unconvincing gore effects and a surfeit of screaming and shouting, a climax that is an obvious imitation of the end of the first film, and you have 90 minutes of wasted time.\n\nCry Wolf (2005)\n\nThe opening scene of this horror film is one of those too-dark-to-see-anything sequences that I normally despise, a young girl running through the woods pursued by someone with a flashlight. On the other hand, she does the smart thing for once, hiding in heavy foliage rather than giving away her location by continuing to flounder through the brush. Unfortunately, her cell phone goes off at the wrong time. Another good reason not to carry one.\n\nThe story is set at a prep school and has some superficial resemblance to The Assassination Game  one of my favorites, which also involved an elaborate game that takes a deadly twist. As usual the youngest of the high school kids is actually 23 and one is 28, and the female lead looks every bit her age. If youre using college age actors, why not set the story at a college? Anyway, the initial set up is a little muddled, but once were past that the story moves well. The new kid gets initiated into the game, which involves lying, manipulation of other players, and general unpleasantness. The next day, police find the body of the girl killed during the opening sequence, and the tenor of the game changes. The kids hatch a plot to pretend that the murderer is a serial killer on campus, even describing how he dresses, and as you might expect, their guesswork is uncomfortably close to the truth. And the truth will come closer as they pattern the killers fictional victims after each other.\n\nThe plot thickens quickly. Threatening emails begin to show up from an unknown source. A dorm room is trashed. A bloody tongue stud turns up. The friends still suspect one another, but evidence is mounting that someone else is involved as well. Theres a nice scene in the library. The lack of overt violence in favor of slow, deliberate, well designed suspense is a pleasant change from the usual style of slasher movies, and the first appearance of the actual killer, who fails to claim his victim, is cleverly done because its set in the middle of a Halloween dance which features a variety of people wearing the killers costume. Some nice twists and surprises ensue and we find out that a lot of what we suspect to be true is just as wrong as what the characters believe.\n\nThen one of the girls decides to take a shower and tells us the whole dorm is empty, which is an unfortunate lapse into blatant cliché, although theres a nice touch as one of the other characters see the masked killer through her cellphone camera. They find the body of their missing friend a short while later. The campus police refuse to believe the call, which I found implausible, so the survivors decide to leave campus together, a sensible precaution, but separate first, which is not. What follows appears at first to be a descent into the ordinary, but there are layers of surprise yet to be revealed. I did guess the truth, but only near the end. Not a great movie, but a good one.\n\nThe Jack Benny Show Volume 5 (1954)\n\nFour episodes of the first show by one of my favorite comedians during my childhood. Jack Benny, master of the slow burn, starts most of these with a short standup routine, after which the skits vary considerably, but the first episode is predominantly one long monologue. Benny is interrupted by singer Bob Crosby, during which his reaction is classic. A second interruption comes when a talkative taxi driver shows up, played by Mel Blanc, who apparently adlibs a line about Bugs Bunny, breaking up everyone on stage. The rest of the show is mostly music including a hillbilly skit that is one of the few times Ive actually heard Benny prove that he really could play the violin well. This was one of his best shows and I actually remembered the skit from having seen it more than fifty years ago.\n\nEpisode 2 is just okay, despite having George Burns, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope as guest stars. Theres a vaudeville spoof that goes on too long and jokes about Benny being too cheap to pay reasonable rates to his guest stars. Guest stars in the next were Dan Duryea and singer Dennis Day, who feature in a moderately funny spoof of mystery thrillers. Day gets the best lines. The last episode is taken up primarily with Jack and Rochester preparing for a trip and his rather unorthodox methods of renting out his house while hes gone. The humor is a bit out of fashion and not always crisp, but Benny is a delight.\n\nDemon Hunter (2004)\n\nThis horror film from the producer of Silk Stalkings is a kind of low budget vs of Constantine. Sean Patrick Flanery is a demon killer, called in by the Church when exorcism isnt enough to kill the bodies infested by demons. We see a not very convincing example of his handiwork before the opening credits, which have an oddly inappropriate, bouncy soundtrack. This most recent posession has convinced Flanery that it isnt mere demons involved but a fallen angel (Billy Drago) impregnating prostitutes to spread his tainted seed. Drago is assisted by a horned woman who, in addition to being a poor actress, is graced by ridiculously corny looking wings and horns, and who attempts to seduce Flannery in his dreams.\n\nThe church sends a nun (Colleen Porch) to be his moral compass while he searches for the big bad evil, although shes nonsensically naïve at times. They run into a uniformed police officer in a scene so badly written that I almost stopped watching at that point, but inertia triumphed and I left it running. Weve also learned at this point that Flanery is only half human and has superhuman strength and that he has no compunctions about casually killing innocent people who inconvenience him. After following some clues, Flanery and the cardinal he works for have another inane conversation in which we discover that all prostitutes by definition have lost their souls, which makes it puzzling that Drago is preying on them instead of the innocent. Flanery has a list of women, all of whom have been possessed except for one, whom they cannot locate. The cardinal announces that this means she is either dead or married, apparently reaching this conclusion through the miracle of bad scripts.\n\nMeanwhile, the missing woman is burying her dead husband and being seduced by Drago while the mediocre soundtrack switches to actively awful. For reasons unknown, she is accompanied by five martial arts trained bodyguards, allowing us to watch an inept fight scene while the nun, unarmed and untrained, chases the now demonically possessed woman into a mausoleum. More stupid dialogue follows as Flanery tries to convince Porch to go away and she tells him that when she was a child the nuns used to frighten her with stories about him. Which, of course, makes no sense since he was working for the Church. The cardinal, incidentally, has sent for inquisitors from all over the world, all of whom apparently are expected to arrive within a few hours. Must be another one of those pesky miracles. Theres eventually a confrontation and final battle, more dreadful soundtrack, and a stupid surprise ending, but I had long since stopped caring by then.\n\nIm not half the man you think I am.\n\nNo, youre more than that.\n\nIts hard to believe that the people who produced, directed, and acted in this film didnt know how bad it was. I suppose any work is better than no work, but when the end result is a movie in which Billy Drago has one of the more convincing parts, maybe its time to consider another line of work.\n\nPulse (2006)\n\nYou have to get past the unlikely premise to really enjoy this movie, which is otherwise reasonably well done, with some creepy scenes, competent acting, acceptable dialogue, and fairly decent production values overall. We know something creepy is going on right from the outset because the opening follows an obviously frightened young man through a series of scenes which are photographed with some kind of dark blue filter to keep things indistinct. Hes apparently planning to meet someone in a library, but things dont go as arranged. Something scary and obscure attacks him and apparently drains away his substance.\n\nSwitch to a group of young friends engaged in the usual banter and sexcapades. Kristen Bell is puzzled by the sudden reclusiveness of her friend Josh, who appears strangely transformed when she finally locates him. Moments later, he hangs himself and the blue filter is back for most of the rest of the film. All of his friends begin receiving emails from him asking for help after hes dead and one, who goes to his apartment, is attacked by a mysterious figure after which he begins to act in the same manner. Elsewhere, bizarre images of suicide and odd figures begin appearing on the dead mans computer screen, and news reports indicate that there has in fact been a rash of suicides throughout the city.\n\nThe blue filter was intentional, but I think it was a mistake, at least used for so much of the film. The effect of the abnormal on the normal world is much less effective when the latter looks so alien to start with. The following day, Bell sees an apparition on a bus, watches one man nearly commit suicide, and another jump to his death from a tower. She consults her psychiatrist, whose response even when presented with verifiable facts is unprofessional and unconvincing and a horror film cliché. Meanwhile, friend #2 is absorbed into a wall and friend #3, who saw it happen, freaks out.\n\nThe weird events are sufficiently random to be a bit frustrating, as is the sequence when the psychiatrist begins to realize the truth, cut short so that we dont see the smug bastard eating his own words. Nor is it clear why the apparitions are content with tormenting Bell rather than just forcing her to commit suicide as they have with everyone else theyve encountered. Panic is spreading as more people are affected by the apparitions, and the internet is troubled by what appears to be a new virus.\n\nPulse is an okay but not great horror film that could have been better if theyd foregone the filter except for specific scenes, made the story more consistent and easier to follow. The menace is so random and so powerful that there is very little suspense, and the only glimpse we get of the wider crisis is a newcast that stops in mid-word. One of her friends tells Bell that the figures are the dead, who want to steal life from our world. Her new boyfriend finds a virus that might stop the incursion if they can find a missing hacker in time. It also needed a much different ending, not another recursion of the heroes outrunning the apparitions (who were previously too fast to avoid), to load the virus that can thwart them into just the right computer system in the basement of a shadowy building. Good acting cant overcome a mediocre script.\n\nReincarnation (2005)\n\nThis Japanese horror film, presented here with English subtitles, opens with three young girls joking about reincarnation. The subtitling isnt great; I can understand that with dubbing but it seems like laziness when you have the freedom to have your work checked by a native English speaker. The awkward phrasing suggests a cheap production, which is unfair to the film, whose other production qualities are quite high. Anyway, there are a couple of very quick, creepy scenes involving an elevator, a rest room, and elsewhere, suggesting that something serious is starting to happen, presumably connected with a new film being produced based on a series of brutal killings at a hotel. The film crew is in fact visiting that very place and each actor is supposed to take the part of one of the actual people killed.\n\nOne of the actresses has been having strange visions, usually but not always of a little girl and her doll, who corresponds to one of the victims. The directors obsession with re-enacting certain parts of the crime provokes more episodes. With no gore and refreshingly little blood, the viewer is dragged along with the protagonist into a series of increasingly disturbing visions of past events impinging on the present. The abduction of a young woman from a library by spirits of the dead is visually effective, but doesnt seem to fit with the rest of the movie.\n\nThe actress, who reveals that she has had dreams of the hotel as a child, investigates further, discovers that the killer was a professor who believed in reincarnation. She also finds more links between herself and the little girl whose image we keep seeing, which suggests that the other actors are also the returned spirits of the dead. Then the living people begin acting strangely, eventually appearing to die in the same manner as their predecessors, only to be revived for the climax. Theres a surprise ending here that I guessed before it was revealed, but only shortly before it was revealed, and I wont spoil it here. The final scenes contain almost no dialogue so the subtitles have no bearing. Decidedly creepy, even though ultimately we really don't know what was going on exactly.\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother (1975)\n\nGene Wilder stars as Sigerson Holmes, the third and youngest of the Holmes brothers, whose efforts to outdo Sherlocks exploits invariably end up in failure. When Sherlock leaves England, Sigerson rises to his greatest challenge, accompanied by a detective, played by Marty Feldman, who has a photographic sense of hearing. The female lead is Madeline Kahn, reuniting three veterans of Young Frankenstein, and had the script been a little better, this would have been a comedy classic. As it is, the film is merely very good and very funny.\n\nSecret crown documents are missing and if they arent recovered quickly, England could find itself at war. He also has a new client, Kahn, who claims that shes being blackmailed, and their initial interview is one of the highlights of the film, and their constant interplay as she tells lies and he sees through them is a clever parody of the Holmes story. They are being watched by minions of the chief villain, Leo McKern as Moriarty, who manages to deliberately chew the scenery almost as ravenously as does the rest of the cast. The musical numbers are also excellent.\n\nWith Sigersons sometimes dubious help, they avoid multiple attempts to assassinate Kahn, who is obviously linked to the missing documents. Wilders seduction of Kahn in order to extract the identity of her father (Foreign Secretary to the Queen) is another great scene; the chemistry between the two is excellent. The bits with McKern and his cronies dont work as well. Wilder and Feldman eventually are captured by Kern and imprisoned in a deathtrap, which they narrowly and comically escape. The farcical climax comes as the villains attempt to transfer the document during the performance of an opera, whose cast has been infiltrated by our heroes. Theres even a decent sword fight.\n\nThe Adventures of Captain Africa (1955)\n\nThis is without doubt the worst of the cliffhanger serials that Ive seen. Captain Africa is transparently the Phantom, given a new name to avoid having to pay royalties for the character. In fact, some of the footage from earlier serials which is patched into this came from the Phantom serial. Even more depressing is that the old cuts are far and away the best. The acting in the new material rarely rises to the level of mediocrity and is usually lifeless, inane, and delivered in a monotone. The plot, such as it is, involves efforts to claim the throne of an Arab African kingdom, with good and bad Arabs fighting for their factions, although the real villains are the Europeans who are trying to manipulate events for their own good. The photography is dreadful; even the outdoors scenes feel claustrophobic. I picked up a book in installment two and finished it before the last episode concluded without missing a bit of the overly redundant, simple minded, and uninteresting plot.\n\nThe Gabby Hayes Show Volume 1 (1950)\n\nAlthough I remember Gabby Hayes as a constant sidekick in early westerns, to Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry, John Wayne, and Roy Rogers among others, I had no recollection of his having his own television show at all, but it all came back the first time he said durn tootin. It was a western anthology series which he hosted, featuring a variety of guest stars including, in the first episode here, Buster Crabbe, who has to prove that a man accused of murder is innocent and bring the real culprits to justice. The plots and action were very reminiscent of the cliffhanger serials of the 1940s, even using some of the same music. This was a kids show so theres plenty of scenes of racing horses, fistfights, and gunfights, and not a whole lot of story. Episode 2 seems to start in the middle. Apparently another innocent man has been jailed as part of a conspiracy between a local businessman and the sheriff. A visiting lawman confronts him, gets into a fight, and eventually is knocked cold and locked up. A not very plausible stories with unconvincing action and clichéd dialog.\n\nTex Ritter adds some class to the last two stories, playing Tex Haines in both. In the first, he has to unmask a mysterious figure who is coercing the local ranchers and in the second he stops a range war. In the former, the villain is known as the Whispering Skull, even more reminiscent than ever of the serials. There are some amusing but contrived false unmaskings before the real villain is identified. The last segment is less noteworthy. Gabbys tall stories are cute but overall the show doesnt hold up well at all.\n\nDark Ride (2006)\n\nPart of the After Dark Horrorfest. Two young girls take a ride through a haunted house and are attacked by someone posing as one of the exhibits. The opening sequence is pretty scary, but then we jump forward to the present and a group of typical Hollywood college students, including the mandatory nerd and the two babes, are brought together for an unauthorized excursion to the very same amusement park, where they hope to spend the night. Unbeknownst to them, two sadistic guards at an asylum unwisely provoked a deformed inmate and met a rather over the top bloody end resulting in his escape and, unsurprisingly, move to the amusement park.\n\nThe prospective victims engage in the usual inane dialogue, although at least they are better actors than most of those gracing direct to dvd horror flicks. They pick up a hitchhiker  what a surprise!  who turns out to be yet another gorgeous young woman  what a surprise!!  though shes a bit of a psycho. They break into the horror ride and make the usual jokes, then swap scary stories. One of them tells of the murders of the two girls and that Jonah, the killer, is still alive and rather clumsily explains that Jonah was mimicking the exhibits. Not very subtle foreshadowing is it?And this phase of the movie goes on a bit too long with dark sets, odd sound effects, but not much happening.\n\nEventually they discover that theyre locked in. Boy was that a surprise. And then they find one of their friends, who has been killed and turned into a puppet, and the fun and games finally begin. Theres the obligatory bare breasts and sex scene and we know that the body count is going to rise again. If youll believe that a guy can not notice that the woman hes having sex with has just had her head cut off, youll believe anything. They separate, of course, with the usual results. The surprising ending isnt. Although uninspired plotwise, this is a much better production than the majority of horror films that show up at Hollywood Video, and it does have some good photographic effects, when its not too dark to see anything, and a low key but not bad soundtrack. Tobe Hooper did the same basic story, much better, in The Funhouse.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm (2005)\n\nMatt Damon and Heath Ledger take the parts of the Grimm brothers, who travel through French occupied Germany telling stories and helping with problems that verge on the supernatural. They come to Karlstadt to deal with a witch, which they do, except that its all an elaborate con game theyve arranged beforehand. We then cut to a young girl walking through the woods, wearing a red cloak and hood, menaced by the sound of wolves and carried off mysteriously. The two fakes suddenly find themselves faced with a genuine supernatural opponent when the local governor, who knows that they are con artists, coerces them into search for the children who have disappeared in recent days.\n\nTheir initial investigation involves the disappearance of Gretel, reported by her brother Hansel. With a woman as their guide and a deranged Frenchman as their companion, they penetrate an enchanted forest and find a presumably abandoned tower. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious figure enchants one of their horses and when they return to the village, the enchantment goes with them and another child is stolen. They battle animated trees while the woman fights a werewolf. After various adventures, they decide to break into the tower, which they believe still holds a cursed queen, as well as the explanation about the kidnappings.\n\nUltimately they defeat the plot to revive the queen at the cost of the children, but only after dealing with an ax wielding masked man and showing up the French, led by Jonathan Pryce. There is some gorgeous photography in this and some of the plot is quite well done, but the acting is only competent, not inspired, and the pace is frequently slow enough that my attention wandered. Most of the special effects are just okay, but the tar baby in the well is particularly clever and well done.\n\nThe Mysterious Mr. M (1946)\n\nThis is one of the lesser known cliffhanger serials. It opens with a more mysterious air than most. Several small time criminals have been found dead in the river, each bearing the insignia of Mr. M, but theyve been killed by a chemical that paralyzes the brain. The mystery dissipates quickly as we see Mr. M. using hypnotism in his quest to apply pressure on a scientist who has developed a revolutionary new submarine. The scientist dies of a heart attack after providing the location of his secret plans. The opening scenes advance the plot even faster than normal, but the very poor acting robs it of any sense of urgency.\n\nMr. M turns out to be a conspiracy of three people, but the tables are turned when a fourth party assumes the role and pressures them to work for him. Now we dont know the chief villains real identity, but we do know that his suddenly reduced minions have several people under hypnotic control. Some of the cliffhangers are innovative, however, as our hero attempts to spy on the criminal organization while they in turn try to lure him to his death. He is particularly motivated because his brother, under hypnosis, committed crimes that have darkened his reputation, and then died from wounds he received sabotaging an industrial facility.\n\nMeanwhile, the conspirators are feuding among themselves, as well as resenting the new Mr. M. Lots of big explosions follow, with our hero escaping every time, and with more of his allies falling under the influence of the hypnotic drug. The frequent conversations among the characters reprising all of the events that have already taken place might have been useful when the chapters were shown at one week intervals, but viewed together they are awkward and stilted and after a while, positively annoying. The real villains identity becomes obvious about halfway through, which doesnt help either.\n\nFreaks and Geeks (1999)\n\nI just finished watching the entire run of eighteen episodes of this blend of comedy and drama, a few of which Id been able to see when it was originally on television. If ever there was a program that illustrated the fact that quality is no guarantee of success, this was it. Cut short before it could really establish its audience even though it was highly regarded by critics, it is still one of the high points of television history, and the existing episodes are of uniformly high quality.\n\nFor those who never saw it, the program was basically split between two overlapping groups of students at a typical high school, more specifically through the eyes of Lindsay and her younger brother Sam. Lindsay has always been an honor student, a member of the Mathletes, a perfect daughter, well behaved and conventional. Following the death of her grandmother (although we never know if there is a connection), she lost interest in her old life and began hanging around with four freaks, rebellious but unfocused, self centered, unrealistic, and preoccupied with pot, sex, rock music, and other things the adult world frowns upon. Her young brother and his two best friends are the geeks, boys interested primarily in academic subjects, science fiction, and similar things, although there is a dawning recognition that girls might be interesting too.\n\nFirst of all, the casting is great. Most of the recurring characters remind me of people I knew in high school. Lindsays parents, though they are exaggerated into caricatures, are also perfectly portrayed by Joe Flaherty and Becky Ann Baker. Second, the scripts are without exception superb. They blend comedy and tragedy, parody and pathos, and the delivery is crisp and riveting. One of the funniest scenes Ive ever watched is the episode in which Lindsay discovers that one of her friends is a con artist and spontaneously bursts out in hysterical laughter. This was Linda Cardellinis first significant role and its not surprising that her subsequent career has been very successful. Most of the rest of the cast have remained active as well.\n\nThere are too many great scenes and lines to describe here. The party where everyone gets drunk on non-alcoholic beer, Sams first exposure to a pornographic film, Lindsays first (and only) attempt to smoke pot, the breakup of the garage band, the fake IDs, the school mascot, the missing diary, Sam streaking through the corridors, and many many more. The various story lines were taking interesting turns as the series ended, with Lindsays parents becoming less caricatures and the other parents taking an increasingly significant role. One of the frustrations of a program like this is that once its cancelled, we never get to find out how things work out. Freaks and Geeks doesnt leave us hanging the way Surface and Invasion did a year ago, but its still annoying that the network didnt give this lovely bud turn into a full flower. The final episode does provide some hints of the futures of its various characters, which just makes it that much greater a loss that we'll never see where that road leads.\n\nThe Red Skelton Show Volume 1 (1951)\n\nThe clownish type of humor for which Red Skelton was famous appealed to me as a kid but not so much as an adult, which made me apprehensive that I wouldnt care for this show, which I hadnt seen in fifty years. The humor of Freddie the Freeloader and Clem Kadiddlehopper is more akin to circus clowns (Skeltons father was a professional clown) than to modern standard comics or sitcoms. The first of the four episodes gathered here starts with a monologue that demonstrates the best and worst of Skelton. Most of his jokes were less than scintillating, even by 1950s standards. On the other hands, his impersonations and characterizations  almost always silent  are great. He had a very expressive face and a skilled eye at picking out peoples mannerisms.\n\nThe first skit, Skelton as a British newscaster, is pretty lame as is the lecture on a new sport, Pedestrian Polo, although it may be the origin of the joke about scoring points for running down various kinds of pedestrians. Like Ernie Kovacs, Skelton makes fun of his sponsor, in this case Tide laundry detergent, Pet Milk, Johnsons Wax, and Geritol. The second monologue is much better, with Skelton demonstrating how different professions applaud. Ed Sullivan is the guest star, laconic as always, doing a fairly serious version of his own show, ending with the introduction of Skelton as a stereotyped prizefighter. It is interesting to see how many celebrities were in the audience but otherwise its very dull. The western skit is considerably better but goes on a bit too long. Some of the flubs (this was live television) are funnier than the material.\n\nGeorge Raft is the guest star for the third episode, which opens with a short but much funnier monologue than the others. Skelton plays a man fascinated with his sons toys. He stumbles on a formula that dissolves fog and decides it will make him rich but a bunch of gangsters, led by Raft, want to steal his discovery. Most of the fourth episode is spent on an extended skit in which Skelton is searching for a hobby and encounters a pair of flim flam artists, but the laughs are few and far between. The set has its ups and downs, but more of the latter than the former.\n\nCrank (2006)\n\nI overheard a conversation a while back discussing the film, The Transporter, making it sound interesting enough that I picked up a cheap copy. I watched it three times in the next two months and the day Transporter 2 came out on DVD, I bought it and watched it. The star is Jason Statham, who does martial arts with complete seriousness, even when the fight sequences are ridiculously stylized, and somehow he made me believe them. With a less than stellar supporting cast, which improved with the sequel, he foiled the criminal, never quite got the girl, and entertained me immensely. In both films, hes a likable criminal, a man who drives the getaway car but doesnt participate otherwise. Hes a crook this time as well, a hitman who is injected with a poison in retribution for his last job. The drug will kill him within an hour and he decides to use that time to get some payback.\n\nTheres a lot of ground to cover quickly, so the opening stages of the movie are a bit jerky, but convey considerable background, his girlfriend, his job, his presumed fate, and his initial reaction. The time limit gives this something of the feel of 24, although its concentrated on a single character. The catch is that the drug affects his adrenal glands, so the only way to stay alive is to stay excited and active, on an adrenaline high that overcomes the drugs. In a scene reminiscent of The Blues Brothers, he leads the police through a mall  his car ends up on an escalator  then escapes in a cab and stocks up on stimulants. The jerky camera action is a bit disorienting at times, but is appropriate for what is actually happening.\n\nThings accelerate rapidly, with an encounter with his nemesis brother, a raid on a hospital, and his subsequent escape. Theres also quite a bit of, sometimes crude, humor that works surprisingly well in this context. Statham suspects that the killer might go after his girlfriend (Amy Smart), so he goes to her apartment, where she refuses to leave with him until he fixes the clock on her microwave A gang of killers shows up before they get away and she seems oblivious to the danger, even when he is killing two of the opposition. The dead parakeet is a nice touch. Later he tries to tell her the truth about what he does for a living, and she refuses to believe him.\n\nThen the plot changes when we discover the truth about the hit. Statham discovers that his former friends want him dead as well and his ditzy girlfriend keeps getting in the way. Theres a nifty car chase after which he gets the final word. There is no cure; hes going to die. But hes determined to take his killer with him, so he sets up a meeting, knowing that there will be a small army waiting for him. Violent, simple minded, and with no redeeming social value, but still fun.\n\nAlthough the movie lacks some of the charm of the Transporter films, in large part because the protagonist is a lot less likable, there is certainly no shortage of action. His patron has already written him off, but a doctor friend tells him to steal some epinephrine, while another friend spies on the man who injected him. Statham has more presence than almost any other actor Ive ever seen, which makes up for his relatively unsophisticated delivery.\n\nBrick Bradford (1947)\n\nBrick Bradford is a typical cliffhanger serial hero, a man of many skills who is contacted by an envoy from the United Nations. It seems that a Dr. Tymak has invented a futuristic anti-missile system and the authorities are concerned that it will be stolen, specifically by a gang of men led by Laydron, an arch-criminal, who knows that the invention could be the most devastating weapon of war the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, the weapon can only be powered by lunarium, an element found exclusively on the moon and a handful of meteorites. In order to secure more lunarium, Tymak has built the crystal door, a matter transmission portal that leads through the fifth dimension to the moon. The fact that this is far more significant than the anti-missile defense apparently never occurred to the writers. He also has an electric force field that surrounds his laboratory.\n\nWhen the bad guys penetrate the shield and accost Tymak, he uses the portal to escape to the moon, which has a breathable atmosphere, gravity identical to Earth, and is inhabited by a race resembling ancient Romans who fortunately speak English!They throw him in the dungeon and remark that hes the first Earthling to arrive for fifty years. Meanwhile, Laydron decides to impersonate Tymak, although hes unmasked fairly early and flees. Bradford and friends then follow Tymak to the moon, hoping to rescue him, nearly losing their own lives as the moon men trap them repeatedly.\n\nThey escape and contact the democratic opposition to the queen and her ruthless supporters. After engineering a revolt, they return to Earth to thwart the villains again, now using new weapons including a device that allows them to become invisible. Tymak is kidnapped again, however, and after being rescued, he reveals that he has built a time machine. This guy is obviously a real genius! But Bradford and friend are not; they travel back to the past and are immediately captured by a primitive tribe. While theyre trying to survive in the past, Tymak comes up with a new weapon, a disintegra"
