        "text": "From Air Conditioning to Jaws to Marvel: How Summer Blockbusters Changed Hollywood Forever\n\nGrowing up, going to the movies was a rare treat, and summer was pretty much the only time we usually went to the movie theater, at least regularly. Matinees were relatively cheap, and sitting in a dark theater for a few hours was a cool way to beat the heat. One of the movies I specifically remember watching as a little kid was The Lion Kingâ€”we saw that movie several times at our local theater.\n\nSeeing The Lion King on the big screen for the first time was a truly unforgettable experience, and it quickly became a widely celebrated sensation. One of our favorite toys from the summer of 1994 was a puzzle of the film's theatrical poster. I spent my afternoons obsessed with recreating \"The Circle of Life\" on our back porch via cassette tape and cringey interpretive dance. I constantly held up the ever-patient family cat over my head like baby Simba. I was invited to more than one The Lion King-themed birthday party in the following months. Even thirty years ago, the Burger King Kids' Meal toys and color-changing cereal spoons were highly coveted collector's items.\n\nThe Lion King was a massive pop culture phenomenon that captivated audiences worldwide with its stunning animation, powerful storyline, and unforgettable characters. This timeless classic continues to resonate with audiences of all ages and remains one of Disney's most successful films. The 2019 live-action adaptation had a global debut of $446 million, the ninth-largest of all time and the biggest opening for an animated film. After its debut on July 9, 2019, The Lion Kingpassed the $1 billion mark at the global box officein just 19 days, making it the:\n\nhighest-grossing animated film of all time\n\nhighest-grossing musical film of all time\n\nhighest-grossing remake of all time\n\nsecond-highest-grossing film of 2019\n\nninth-highest-grossing film of all time\n\nIn fact, when adjusting for inflation, the original animated The Lion King is still thesixth highest-grossing summer blockbuster of all time,raking in $778.85 million domestically. But what exactly are summer blockbusters, and how did they come to be?\n\nWhat is a Summer Blockbuster?\n\nA blockbuster is typically a very popular and financially successful feature film with a wide appeal, often leading to extensive merchandising and franchising opportunities. Specifically, a summer blockbuster is a highly anticipated, big-budget production released in May, June, July, or August. These movies often feature a lot of action and special effects, are released when many people are on vacation or have more free time, and are more likely to spend money.\n\nBlockbusters may seem like a summer tradition for modern audiences, but that hasn't always been the case. Throughout the evolution of cinema, major Hollywood studios dreaded summer because it was historically their least profitable season. It was a challenging period for the fledging film industry, which struggled to maintain a consistent cash flow and keep moviegoers in theaters. At a critical crossroads, Hollywood needed a significant shift to sustain its growth. This pivotal change came about thanks to a cool invention and some PR magic.\n\nThe Sweltering Beginnings of Early Cinema\n\nIn the film industry's early days, cinemas were pretty miserable, especially during the summer when they could feel like saunas. Most people took the opportunity to travel and enjoy the great outdoors and didn't want to spend their vacations inside a hot theater.It wasn't until 1925 that the first theater installed modern air conditioning.\n\nCarrier Corp. founder Willis Carrier knew that if he could make it in New York, he could make it anywhere and installed a \"refrigerating plant\" in the Rivoli Theater in Times Square. The \"centrifugal chiller\" made its debut on Memorial Day. Despite some initial hiccups, theater-goers were impressed by the technology. Adolph Zukor, a film producer and one of the founders of Paramount Pictures, was particularly impressed with the invention's potential. Allegedly, at the end of the film, Zukor announced in the lobby, \"Yes, the people are going to like it.\"\n\nAfter its success on Memorial Day, the Rivoli announced, \"We have invested over $100,000 in a refrigeration plant to keep you cool and comfortable when the world is sweltering.\" Adjusting for inflation, that's over $1.8 million today. By 1930, more than 300 theaters followed suit and advertised that their buildings were \"cooled by refrigeration.\" As patrons started choosing cinemas as an entertaining way to beat the heat, the air conditioning had the dual purpose of keeping the expensive and often unstable equipment from overheating as sound, lighting, and projection technology continually improved throughout the 1930s.\n\nDespite finding ways to make theaters more comfortable in the summer months, theaters still had trouble getting patrons in seats. The summer season was often a waste for film studios, as most people still spent their spare time and expendable cash traveling. Theaters would usually resort to reruns or what we would call today \"indie films\" in hopes of a sleeper hit. However, that would all change with the introduction of the \"blockbuster\" in the 1940s.\n\nBlockbuster Beginnings: How the 1940s Defined a Genre\n\nThe etymology of this everyday summertime staple is actually pretty dark. During World War II, newsreels shown at the beginning of a feature film would detail the war efforts, including the strategic aerial bombings throughout Europe and Asia. This bombing technique could literally \"bust up\" full residential and city blocks.\n\nHowever, the first time the term \"blockbuster\" was used to describe a film was Richard Wallace's 1943 war drama Bombardier. Trade magazines Variety and Motion Picture Herald called the film, which featured the training program for the United States Army Air Forces bombardiers, \"The block-buster of all action-thrill-service shows!\" Advertisements in 1944 described Louis Hayward's war documentary With the Marines at Tarawa as \"hitting the heart like a two-ton blockbuster.\" Additionally, the term was used to describe hits like the war drama Bataan (1943), the romantic comedy No Time for Love (1943), and the musical Brazil (1944).\n\nThere are several theories regarding the origins of the term \"blockbusters\" to describe films, but the most likely explanation is a PR strategy. Publicists in trade magazines wanted to draw on readers' familiarity with blockbuster bombs from WWII as an analogy to describe the potentially huge commercial impact these films could have on the market. Hey, I said the etymology was dark!\n\nHowever, while Hollywood finally had a term for films with commercial potential with a broad audience, it still had a problem: Putting butts in seats during the summer. Studios were still reluctant to produce and distribute big-budget films during such a financially risky season. It wasn't until Universal took a leap of faith with an up-and-coming director and his ambitious plans to adapt Peter Benchley's 1974 novel Jaws. This decision would ultimately redefine the landscape of summer cinema and solidify the concept of the blockbuster film.\n\nThe Modern Blockbuster: A Cultural Phenomenon\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) is considered the first true summer blockbuster. Not only did people physically queue up around the block to see the movie, but it also became the first film to earn $100 million at the box office. And, thanks to a wildly successful marketing campaign where Universal spent an unprecedented $700,000 on television advertising, moviegoers, particularly teens with expendable income, were willing to line up to see Bruce in action two or three times throughout the summer of 1975. Jaws became a cultural phenomenon and laid the foundation of what a true summer blockbuster entails: big-budget thrills with merchandising and franchising potential.\n\nIn 1977, George Lucas tested Universal's strategy with his own production: Star Wars, the first summer blockbuster based on an original screenplay. This departure from the norm proved groundbreaking as Star Wars set box office records and enjoyed an unprecedented theatrical run that spanned over a year. Star Wars' massive success followed the trail initially blazed by Jaws, and the industry took notice of the potential for profitability in producing large-scale, franchise-worthy productions.\n\nWith Jaws and Star Wars as prototypes, film studios embraced a strategy of green-lighting ambitious, large-scale productions with the potential to create lucrative franchises. Hollywood sought to replicate the seemingly lightning-in-a-bottle success of these two films that captured the imaginations of audiences worldwide.\n\nThe Rise of the Franchise: Blockbuster Hits of the '80s and '90s\n\nWhile Jaws' three sequels haven't been nearly as successful, the original film's impact extended beyond the screen. It launched a popular attraction at Universal Studios theme parks and revitalized the creature feature subgenre, influencing numerous monster movies that followed. Jaws set a precedent for the modern summer blockbuster with its thrilling storytelling, suspenseful direction by Steven Spielberg, and innovative marketing strategies.\n\nSimilarly, George Lucas's Star Wars franchise established a multimedia empire, leading to sequels, prequels, spin-offs, novels, television shows, merchandise, and even a themed land at Disney theme parks. Star Wars redefined cinematic world-building and franchising, becoming a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdjusting for inflation, Star Wars and Jaws still hold the top two spots for highest-earning summer blockbusters of all time, raking in $2.076 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively. And yes, those are billions with a \"b.\"\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, film studios continued to release big-budget, high-production movies with widespread appeal during the summer season. This approach not only maximized box office potential but also solidified the summer blockbuster as a staple of the movie industry. Several new film series emerged during this era, including:\n\nAlien: In 1979, Ridley Scott's Alien scared the pants off everyone with its new sci-fi horror vibes. Then, in 1986, James Cameron's Aliens kicked things up a notch with hardcore action and suspense. After that, we got Alien 3 (1992) and Alien: Resurrection (1997), maintaining its influence on the genre.\n\nIndiana Jones: Created by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, the Indiana Jones series brought adventure and archaeology to the big screen. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) introduced the iconic character, followed by Temple of Doom (1984) and The Last Crusade (1989), each delivering thrilling escapades.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Starring Eddie Murphy, Beverly Hills Cop (1984) blended comedy and action, becoming a defining film of the genre. The original's success led to two sequels, Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) and Beverly Hills Cop III (1994), further establishing Murphy as a major box office draw.\n\nGhostbusters:Ghostbusters (1984), directed by Ivan Reitman, was a massive hit with its mix of comedy and spooky elements. Ghostbusters II (1989) kept the fun going, making the franchise a cult-classic favorite.\n\nBack to the Future: Robert Zemeckis directed Back to the Future in 1985, blending time travel, humor, and heart to create an instant classic. The sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990), expanded the story's scope and creativity, solidifying the trilogy as a beloved part of cinematic history.\n\nBatman: Tim Burton's Batman (1989) redefined the superhero genre with its dark, gothic aesthetic and Michael Keaton's portrayal of the Caped Crusader. The sequel, Batman Returns (1992), continued to explore the character's complex world, influencing future superhero movies.\n\nJurassic Park: Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) revolutionized special effects and brought dinosaurs to life in unprecedented ways. The film's success led to sequels like The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001), cementing the franchise's status as a summer blockbuster staple.\n\nThese movie franchises not only dominated the box office but also influenced popular culture, leading to many imitations and setting high standards for future blockbuster films. The summer season became synonymous with high-octane entertainment, captivating audiences with cutting-edge visuals, compelling stories, and unforgettable characters.\n\nBuilding Cinematic Universes: Multi-Film Projects in the 21st Century\n\nWhile the latter part of the twentieth century focused on science fiction and comedies, with the arrival of the 21st century, there has been a significant shift towards fantasy and action genres, particularly within the superhero subgenre. This transition is a reflection of the evolving preferences of global audiences and the remarkable advancements in CGI and special effects technology. These technological developments have enabled filmmakers to craft visually stunning and imaginative cinematic worlds previously unimaginable in Hollywood.\n\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, studios started green-lighting multi-film projects, capitalizing on the success of world-building and layered storytelling techniques that had been popular in the 1980s and 1990s. This approach allowed filmmakers to create expansive 'cinematic universes' with interconnected storylines and characters across multiple films. Some of the most successful franchises of this period include:\n\nWhile the last part of the twentieth century focused on sci-fi and comedies, the twenty-first century has focused on fantasy and action, especially within the superhero subgenre.\n\nX-Men: The X-Men series set the stage for the modern superhero subgenre. Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000) was a game-changer, successfully bringing Marvel's beloved mutants to the big screen and paving the way for hit sequels X2 (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). These films proved that superhero movies could be both critically acclaimed and commercially successful.\n\nSpider-Man: Directed by Sam Raimi, Sony's original Spider-Man Trilogy starring Tobey Maguire set new standards for superhero movies. Spider-Man (2002) was a massive hit, breaking box office records and receiving recognition for its heartfelt storytelling and impressive action sequences. The sequels, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), continued the trend, with Spider-Man 2 often cited as one of the best superhero films ever made.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, starting with The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), brought swashbuckling adventures back into the mainstream. Johnny Depp's iconic portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow captivated audiences, and the series' mix of fantasy, humor, and action made it a global phenomenon. The sequels, including Dead Man's Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007), maintained the franchise's popularity, leading to further installments in 2011 and 2017.\n\nThe Dark Knight Trilogy: Christopher Nolan's Dark KnightTrilogy redefined the superhero genre with its dark, realistic take on the Batman mythos. Batman Begins (2005) introduced a more grounded and complex Bruce Wayne, while The Dark Knight (2008) became a cultural touchstone, mainly thanks to Heath Ledger's unforgettable Academy Award-winning performance as the Joker. The trilogy wrapped up with The Dark Knight Rises (2012), cementing its legacy as a critical and commercial success.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code: Based on Dan Brown's bestselling novels, this series combined mystery, history, and adventure. The Da Vinci Code (2006), starring Tom Hanks as Harvard Professor Robert Langdon, was followed by Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016). Each movie delves into intricate puzzles and conspiracies that kept audiences hooked and earned director Ron Howard the biggest box office numbers of his career.\n\nTransformers: Michael Bay's series brought the beloved 1980s toy line of Autobots and Decepticons to life with groundbreaking visual effects and explosive action. The franchise kicked off with Transformers (2007) and continued with sequels like Revenge of the Fallen (2009) and Dark of the Moon (2011). Despite mixed reviews, the series maintained its popularity, with later installments like Age of Extinction (2014) and The Last Knight (2017).\n\nThe Conjuring: James Wan's The Conjuring Universe revitalized the horror genre by blending supernatural scares and compelling storytelling. The Conjuring (2013) and its sequels, The Conjuring 2 (2016) and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021), introduced audiences to the paranormal investigations of Ed and Lorraine Warren, spawning a successful franchise that includes spin-offs like Annabelle and The Nun.\n\nMarvel's The Infinity Saga: Throughout the 2010s, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) absolutely dominated the box office and transformed blockbuster filmmaking with its interconnected series of superhero films. Of the top 10 highest-grossing superhero films of all time, eight were produced by Marvel from 2012-2021. Specifically, the 23-film The Infinity Saga, spanning from Iron Man (2008) to Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), reached its peak with the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame (2019), earning a worldwide gross just under $2.8 billion.\n\nCharacters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers became household names, and Marvel's strategic release schedule during this period, with many of its films launched during the summer season, ensured ongoing high audience engagement and commercial success.\n\nThese franchises not only brought in massive box office returns but also redefined what summer blockbusters could achieve, emphasizing serialized storytelling, expansive world-building, and viral marketing campaigns that appealed to an international audience. They reflect the broader trends and technological advancements in cinema, shaping the movie-going experience for contemporary audiences and setting new standards for future blockbusters.\n\nThe Future of Cinema: Reimagining the Summer Blockbuster Season\n\nIt's interesting to note that the summer months were considered the kiss of death for theaters and film studios in the early twentieth century. However, with technological advancements and the rise of blockbuster movies and their marketing, summer has become Hollywood's most profitable season. However, it's clear that audiences are feeling the franchise fatigue.\n\nDuring the summer, big-budget movies dominate the market, but there's still room for these types of films to be released throughout the year. Even the MCU is planning to release 40% of its upcoming movies outside the summer months.Some experts believe that movie studios should move away from the traditional seasonal release strategy and opt for a year-round approach. Currently, blockbusters are mainly released in the summer, award season films from November through January, and the rest of the calendar months are typically left for movies that are not expected to generate massive profits. This system often creates a bottleneck in the market during these months, and without better pacing and planning, these less popular months are a missed opportunity.\n\nAlthough current summer seasons have felt very different from usual because of the COVID-19 pandemic, feature films are a summer staple trying to make a comeback. Regarding consumer trends, summer is the biggest spending season, with 51% of polled consumers reporting spending more than they should. Capitalizing on these spending trends, studios often spend as much as a film's production budget on marketing alone to get moviegoers to the theaters. Even in a post-Covid market, the highest-grossing films were summer blockbusters grossing more than $1.4 billion.\n\nBreakdown of the Highest-Grossing Films Post-COVID\n\nAnticipating a future beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth reflecting on the position of summer blockbusters in the evolving landscape of cinema. Personally, I believe that blockbuster movies, especially during the summer season, will continue to appeal to audiences and perform well at the box office. However, this doesn't mean that film studios shouldn't consider having a more consistent schedule for releasing their high-budget movies throughout the year to reduce audience fatigue and for the market's overall stability.\n\nAs the film industry gradually recuperates from the impact of the pandemic, we are witnessing a shift in audience behavior, with many people choosing to return to theaters while others opt for at-home digital releases and exclusive content on streaming platforms. This complex dynamic presents an opportunity for film studios to rethink their traditional approach to scheduling blockbuster releases. It will be interesting to see how these scheduling practices change over the next few years ge to adapt to evolving audience preferences and habits.\n\nLooking toward the film industry's future, I'm curious how the current summer blockbuster concept might change or evolve. With shifts in audience habits, technological advancements, and emerging global trends, the landscape of blockbuster films could undergo another significant shift in the coming years. How do you think it might change or evolve moving forward? Share your thoughts in the comments!\n\nI'd also love to hear about your favorite blockbuster memory! For me, it's a toss-up between seeing The Lion King for the first time or lining up with my friends to catch a midnight showing of a Harry Potter movie on my birthday."
