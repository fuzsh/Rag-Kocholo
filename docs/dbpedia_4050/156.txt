Poet and novelist Charles Bukowski was a Los Angeles author who represented some major facets of the twentieth century counterculture. Time magazine once called him the “laureate of American lowlife.” He did not receive much scholarly attention in his lifetime, but instead garnered a cult following which has grown tremendously over the decades. Readers appreciate his confessional poetry and prose twinged with abrasiveness, self-loathing, lust, drunkenness, and all sorts of base desires. While it is fair to say that much of his work satirizes errant behavior and machismo, it is also true that Bukowski was deeply problematic, a misogynist and an alcoholic. Yet this combination and the bluntness of his works are part of his appeal. In Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame, he presents some of his most quintessential poetry, collected from the earlier half of his career (1955 to 1973). It was a period of incredible artistic productivity for him. This volume is one of his many sought-after Black Sparrow Press editions, a publishing partnership between Bukowski and the press that allowed him to become a full-time writer. For any Bukowski collector, it is an essential volume.

This first trade edition, first printing is in fine condition. It is inscribed with an original drawing by Charles Bukowski on the title page. In the original orange wrappers, very nearly fine with only lightest fading and miniscule bump to spine. Text block fine. This first trade issue in wrappers was published simultaneously with two signed limited first editions, one of only 50 copies and the other of only 300 copies. The only differences between these separate issues are the bindings and limitation pages.

A fine inscribed Bukowski title, scarce in original wrappers.
