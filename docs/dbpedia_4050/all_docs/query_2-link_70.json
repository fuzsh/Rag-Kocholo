        "text": "Charles Bukowski – what a guy. The guy who ‘starved for a 24hr day unintruded upon by other people’. The German-American poet, novelist and short story writer was influenced by his surroundings of his home in L.A, at a time where there was a lot of cultural, social and economic changes going on around him.\n\nFor aspiring writers, poets and artists alike, Bukowski no doubt offers a wealth of inspiration and motivation to pursue what they love.\n\nI gave up food, I gave up everything. I was a nut, I was dedicated\n\nIt wasnt until 1954, when Charles Bukowski had an internal haemorrhage, with the pursuing 9 days living life on a knive edge , that his poetry would win him a place in history as one of the most icconic and influential writers of 20th century American poetry.\n\nCharles Bukowski – Go All The Way\n\nIf you’re going to try, go all the way.\n\nOtherwise, don’t even start.\n\nIf you’re going to try, go all the way.\n\nThis could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs and maybe even your mind.\n\nIt could mean not eating for three or four days.\n\nIt could mean freezing on a park bench.\n\nIt could mean jail.\n\nIt could mean derision, mockery, isolation.\n\nIsolation is the gift.\n\nAll the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it.\n\nAnd, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.\n\nAnd it will be better than anything else you can imagine.\n\nIf you’re going to try, go all the way.\n\nThere is no other feeling like that.\n\nYou will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire.\n\nDO IT. DO IT. DO IT. All the way\n\nYou will ride life straight to perfect laughter.\n\nIt’s the only good fight there is."
