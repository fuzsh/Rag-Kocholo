        "text": "Underground poet Charles Bukowski posed this addressed this ironic question to all those who, like him, want to transit the uncertain path of writing.\n\nBetween the damned names in literature, few are as significant as Charles Bukowski, the man who turned alcohol, sex and the precarious lifestyle of the outsider into the imperishable (and sublime, it’s true) material of which books are made of.\n\nHowever, to assume that the praise of these circumstances is the very raison d’être of Bukowski’s work would be quite reductionist. Bukowski aligned himself to this headcount of writers that begun mainly with the 19th century Russian writers (Dostoyevsky, Gogol and Chekhov, who plunged into the depths of society’s dirty pearls to discover the heroism of hasty bureaucrats in dirty coats looking for a daily vindication and even perhaps redemption) only to be transformed by the route of literature.\n\nAt the same time, leaving aside for a moment these accidents (in the Aristotelian sense of the term), it’s possible to trace a common zone where Bukowski binds himself to other writers through their shared, urgent need to write in order to survive the day. They write in order to live, nothing more.\n\nProof of this is the following poem in which the author of Love is a Dog from Hell examines the task of writing. “So you want to be a writer”, Bukowski says ironically and with a certain defiant contempt for others who, like him, are bound by their profound and authentic vocation and who would dare to respond to him with an absolute Yes, rendering the issue settled.\n\nso you want to be a writer\n\n.\n\nif it doesn’t come bursting out of you\n\nin spite of everything,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless it comes unasked out of your\n\nheart and your mind and your mouth\n\nand your gut,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you have to sit for hours\n\nstaring at your computer screen\n\nor hunched over your\n\ntypewriter\n\nsearching for words,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re doing it for money or\n\nfame,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re doing it because you want\n\nwomen in your bed,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you have to sit there and\n\nrewrite it again and again,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif it’s hard work just thinking about doing it,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re trying to write like somebody\n\nelse,\n\nforget about it.\n\n.\n\nif you have to wait for it to roar out of\n\nyou,\n\nthen wait patiently.\n\nif it never does roar out of you,\n\ndo something else.\n\n.\n\nif you first have to read it to your wife\n\nor your girlfriend or your boyfriend\n\nor your parents or to anybody at all,\n\nyou’re not ready.\n\n.\n\ndon’t be like so many writers,\n\ndon’t be like so many thousands of\n\npeople who call themselves writers,\n\ndon’t be dull and boring and\n\npretentious, don’t be consumed with self-\n\nlove.\n\nthe libraries of the world have\n\nyawned themselves to\n\nsleep\n\nover your kind.\n\ndon’t add to that.\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless it comes out of\n\nyour soul like a rocket,\n\nunless being still would\n\ndrive you to madness or\n\nsuicide or murder,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless the sun inside you is\n\nburning your gut,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\n.\n\nwhen it is truly time,\n\nand if you have been chosen,\n\nit will do it by\n\nitself and it will keep on doing it\n\nuntil you die or it dies in you.\n\n.\n\nthere is no other way.\n\n.\n\nand there never was."
