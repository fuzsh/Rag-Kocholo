        "text": "I love Charles Bukowski’s poetry because he writes in a way that makes his poems accessible. This one has a lot of depth to it, but also has a few spots that make you smile.\n\nCharles Bukowski was 73 when he died. He was a prolific writer and published 60 books of his poems and short stories, in addition to his 6 novels. He was born in Germany but lived in Los Angeles almost all of his life.\n\nBelow is a poem that illustrates Bukowski’s ability to tell a whole story in very few words while conveying his thoughts, feelings, attitudes, values, and even work habits.\n\nAbout My Very Tortured Friend, Peter\n\nhe lives in a house with a swimming pool\n\nand says the job is\n\nkilling him.\n\nhe is 27. I am 44. I can’t seem to\n\nget rid of\n\nhim. his novels keep coming\n\nback. “what do you expect me to do?” he screams\n\n“go to New York and pump the hands of the\n\npublishers?”\n\n“no,” I tell him, “but quit your job, go into a\n\nsmall room and do the\n\nthing.”\n\n“but I need ASSURANCE, I need something to\n\ngo by, some word, some sign!”\n\n“some men did not think that way:\n\nVan Gogh, Wagner—”\n\n“oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him\n\npaints whenever he\n\nneeded them!”\n\n“look,” he said, “I’m over at this broad’s house today and\n\nthis guy walks in. a salesman. you know\n\nhow they talk. drove up in this new\n\ncar. talked about his vacation. said he went to\n\nFrisco—saw Fidelio up there but forgot who\n\nwrote it. now this guy is 54 years\n\nold. so I told him: ‘Fidelio is Beethoven’s only\n\nopera.’ and then I told\n\nhim: ‘you’re a jerk!’ ‘whatcha mean?’ he\n\nasked. ‘I mean, you’re a jerk, you’re 54 years old and\n\nyou don’t know anything!’”\n\n“what happened\n\nthen?”\n\n“I walked out.”\n\n“you mean you left him there with\n\nher?”\n\n“yes.”\n\n“I can’t quit my job,” he said. “I always have trouble getting a\n\njob. I walk in, they look at me, listen to me talk and\n\nthey think right away, ah ha! he’s too intelligent for\n\nthis job, he won’t stay\n\nso there’s really no sense in hiring\n\nhim.\n\nnow, YOU walk into a place and you don’t have any trouble:\n\nyou look like an old wino, you look like a guy who needs a\n\njob and they look at you and they think:\n\nah ha!: now here’s a guy who really needs work! if we hire\n\nhim he’ll stay a long time and work\n\nHARD!”\n\n“do any of those people,” he asks “know you are a\n\nwriter, that you write poetry?”\n\n“no.”\n\n“you never talk about\n\nit. not even to\n\nme! if I hadn’t seen you in that magazine I’d\n\nhave never known.”\n\n“that’s right.”\n\n“still, I’d like to tell these people that you are a\n\nwriter.”\n\n“I’d still like to\n\ntell them.”\n\n“why?”\n\n“well, they talk about you. they think you are just a\n\nhorseplayer and a drunk.”\n\n“I am both of those.”\n\n“well, they talk about you. you have odd ways. you travel alone.\n\nI’m the only friend you\n\nhave.”\n\n“yes.”\n\n“they talk you down. I’d like to defend you. I’d like to tell\n\nthem you write\n\npoetry.”\n\n“leave it alone. I work here like they\n\ndo. we’re all the same.”\n\n“well, I’d like to do it for myself then. I want them to know why\n\nI travel with\n\nyou. I speak 7 languages, I know my music—”\n\n“forget it.”\n\n“all right, I’ll respect your\n\nwishes. but there’s something else—”\n\n“what?”\n\n“I’ve been thinking about getting a\n\npiano. but then I’ve been thinking about getting a\n\nviolin too but I can’t make up my\n\nmind!”\n\n“buy a piano.”\n\n“you think\n\nso?”\n\n“yes.”\n\nhe walks away\n\nthinking about\n\nit."
