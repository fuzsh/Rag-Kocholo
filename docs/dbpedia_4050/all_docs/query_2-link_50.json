        "text": "International conference\n\n6-7 June 2024\n\nReading, Readings… and Loving Bukowski: an invitation to a subjective interpretation\n\nUniversité Bordeaux Montaigne\n\nIn August 2020, Charles Bukowski would have celebrated his centennial. Because of the pandemic, the event took place on the social network Facebook. People around the world shared texts, videos, and memories. This event was the result of a joint effort from members of two Bukowski fandoms, active on and offline. This global online event, endorsed by friends or family of the author such as his daughter Marina Bukowski, reminds us of a frequent finding when researching the author: Bukowski is read and appreciated, and his poetry is shared by many, well beyond his state of California, where he has made his mark.\n\nCharles Bukowski is a prolific writer, and his work is polymorphous. He has more than sixty books published and or? reprinted, from novels such as Post Office (1971) and Women (1978) to volumes of poetry such as The Roominghouse Madrigals (1988) and Love is a Dog From Hell (1977) and collections of stories like Notes of a Dirty Old Man (1969).\n\nCharles Bukowski received support to become a famous writer. This support arose from independent publishers and their little magazines. With the littles,he developed a network of fellow poets such as Steve Richmond, Douglas Blazek or editors like John Bryan (Open City) and Jon Webb (The Outsider). He engaged in correspondence with them in the 1960s. From the start of his publishing in underground magazines, Charles Bukowski refused to be labeled and did not want to be associated with any poetry group or movement.\n\nYet, he influenced American poetry, and beyond. His work has been published in the rest of the world, translated into many languages, starting with German and French from the early 1970s. Bukowski is celebrated in countries such as Greece, Brazil, and the Netherlands, where readings of his poems are frequently organized in cafés and bars.\n\nHis distribution expanded after the publication of his first works by Loujon Press and City Lights, then Black Sparrow Press. Lawrence Ferlinghetti introduced the writer through poetry readings in his San Francisco bookstore, City Lights. Bukowski continued these readings in universities’ lecture halls, theaters’ stages, and bars, to make ends meet. The image of the “dirty old man” was developed both in his texts, at these readings, and when Charles Bukowski talked to journalists. He transformed himself into the alcoholic poet his editors and journalists loved.\n\nThis image, which has never left him, has brought upon a form of intermediality in Bukowski’s work, since the latter and his image intermingle. Artists and readers use the texts as well as the author’s image, to draw inspiration from them, pay homage to them, or use them for commercial purposes. Bukowski is a poet represented in comic strips, musicals (Bukowskical!), amateur videos posted on the YouTube sharing platform, but also quoted or mentioned in TV series (Bojack Horseman, The Simpsons, or even Beverly Hills 90210) and represented in movies (Factotum, Barfly, among others).\n\nFor this conference, we would like to invite fans and readers of Charles Bukowski’s work, aficionados from all over the world, to discuss Charles Bukowski with the aim to understand why this author gathers so many people around the world, and in such a singular way. Why and how do people read and love Bukowski?\n\nWe aim to discuss the author’s reception chronologically, starting with his work before his worldwide success, the literary intermediaries and mediators who supported him, enabling his circulation. Then we would like to look at the author’s reception as he became known in various countries, and to explain the reasons for his continuing success, even after his death, 30 years ago. Finally, we will look at the “re-presentation” of the author after becoming a success, and the use of hisimage in a variety of media.\n\nWe hope to welcome testimonies and papers relating to the reception of Charles Bukowski from a variety of angles: his influence on various literary scenes, his publishing, the role of his translators, the choices made by his editors, but also and above all the way readers read Bukowski, why they appreciate the author’s texts and sometimes appropriate his work, to renew it in other media forms.\n\nProposals\n\nProposals for papers, in English or French, consisting of a title, an abstract (max. 300 words), and a short bio note should be submitted to colloque.bukowski2024@gmail.com by October 15, 2023.\n\nThe participants will be notified of their proposal’s acceptance by November 2023.\n\nOrganizing committee\n\nAmélie Macaud and Sophie Rachmuhl\n\nScientific committee\n\nIrandokht Dina Moinzadeh (Professeur agrégée, Lycée Newton Enrea, Paris)\n\nPeggy Pacini (MCF, CY Cergy Paris Université)\n\nAnne-Marie Paquet-Deyris (Professeur des Universités, Université Paris Nanterre)\n\nAlexandre Thiltges (Senior Lecturer, Baylor University, Texas)\n\nBibliography\n\nCharles Bukowski's work and further reading:\n\nBURGOS, Martine, EVANS, Christophe, BUCH, Esteban.
