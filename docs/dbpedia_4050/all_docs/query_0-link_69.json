        "text": "“The unexamined life is not worth living,” Socrates used to mumble after a long night of throwing back hemlock. A readerly crawl through the booze-babe-and-brawling saga of Henry Charles Bukowski Jr. tempts similar skepticism about the examined life.\n\nA half-century’s worth of scrutiny — most of it from Bukowski himself, but more recently from a succession of biographers and scholars — has dissected what seems like every moment of the writer-poet’s 73 years until his death from leukemia in 1994: his childhood thrashings by a brutish father; his decades of willfully impoverished rooming-house life in the Los Angeles underbelly; his nearly constant drunkenness; his bar-fights; his arrests; his whoring; his volcanic feuds with editors, friends and the women who dared take up with him; his liquor-induced hemorrhages and vomiting spells and apartment-smashing rampages; his years of nocturnal drudgery as a postal worker; his self-loathing and his often suicidal despair.\n\nWas this life worth living? Perhaps only if one reckons with what Bukowski’s examinations of it produced: the brutal, profane and darkly hilarious art that held redemptive power for legions of his readers. Bukowski’s skeletal, self-referential poems and stories, barren of metaphor but crackling with hard truth told in American barroom vernacular, brought him adulation from people who scarcely read what Bukowski called “lacy” poetry (he used a noun other than “poetry”). But the adulation came late: he did not enjoy fame beyond the Los Angeles demimonde until he was 47; his work did not begin to earn him significant money for another 12 years.\n\nWhen the spotlight finally found him, “Hank” Bukowski became a worldwide celebrity to poets and scholars of the craft, as well as to the dispossessed and would-be dispossessed who gorged on his isolato spleen. His published poems, a fraction of the tens of thousands he scribbled through his squalid decades, sometimes on newsprint, were collected in more than 40 volumes and translated into several European languages — “Notes of a Dirty Old Man,” “Love Is a Dog From Hell,” “South of No North,” “The Last Night of the Earth Poems” and others. Norman Mailer and, later, Sean Penn hung with him. Women flew to Los Angeles from around the world to bed him, ignoring (or digging) his beer-belly and pockmarked simian face that “hung down between his shoulders, giving him the appearance of a massive troglodyte,” as one acquaintance described him. He has been the subject of a dozen-odd biographies and critical studies, and has been portrayed twice in movies: by Mickey Rourke in 1987’s “Barfly,” and by Matt Dillon in last year’s “Factotum,” based on one of Bukowski’s five novels."
