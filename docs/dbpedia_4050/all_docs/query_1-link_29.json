        "text": "(1920–1994),\n\nAmerican poet and novelist, born in Andernach, Germany, and brought to Los Angeles as a child. A prolific writer in the Beat tradition, his work depicts the low‐life underside of the American Dream. The most significant of his many poetry volumes are Crucifix in a Deathhand (1965), Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955‐73 (1974), Love is a Dog from Hell (1977), and The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992). His novels and stories are similarly characterized by hard‐bitten yet humorous observations on love, drinking, and work, notably in Post Office (1971), Factotum (1975), and Ham on Rye (1982)."
