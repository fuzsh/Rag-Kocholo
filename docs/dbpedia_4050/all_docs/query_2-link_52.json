Written off by critics as a drunken blowhard, his work was a slashing rebuke to polite academic formalism, cutting through the labyrinthine indulgent difficulty of much modern verse; his poems are poems anyone can understand.  The self-proclaimed \"dirty old man\" profiled by this film, was possibly a misunderstood romantic, and defiantly a major American poet.  With rare footage, photos, readings, and interviews with friends, ex-lovers, and celebrity admirers, the film paints a straightforward introductory portrait of Bukowski, the patron saint of skid row poetry.",
