        "text": "Born in 1920 in Germany and having later migrated to the United States in 1923, Charles Bukowski was a 20th-century German-American writer and a poet known for his unfiltered, potent and often crude takes on life.\n\nAs a German immigrant, Bukowski was condemned and ridiculed for his clothing and accent during his childhood, ostracised as an outcast. Often beaten by his father, the circumstances of abuse and loneliness imposed onto him laid the groundwork for his perspective on life and his desire to express himself as a writer.\n\nBukowski tried being a writer all his life, writing thousands and hundreds of stories, most of which often found little to no success. Bukowski worked various blue-collar jobs for several years and he continued writing all those years. Even with no real sight of success or even just creating a living from writing, Bukowski continued writing nearly every day before work for years.\n\nBukowski started getting recognition for his writings when he was in his fifties. It was at this time that he started making a living out of writing. On the tail end of a traditional career, at 50 years old Bukowski started his career. He finally became successful as a writer. It took years and years of undying effort and writings to work in his favor so he could gain traction and find success.\n\n. . .\n\nIt is ironic that his tombstone today reads “Don’t try.”\n\nHow could a man who became his idea of himself; a man who, although it took a while found immense respect and recognition for his craft, all because of his relentless trying; how could this man leave the words “Don’t try” as his final offering?\n\nIn a letter to his friend William Packard, Bukowski writes-\n\n“Too many writers write for the wrong reasons. They want to get famous or they want to get rich or they want to get laid by the girls with bluebells in their hair…\n\n…When everything works best it’s not because you chose writing but because writing chose you. It’s when you’re mad with it, it’s when it’s stuffed in your ears, your nostrils, under your fingernails. It’s when there’s no hope but that…\n\n…We work too hard. We try too hard.\n\nDon’t try. Don’t work. It’s there. It’s been looking right at us, aching to kick out of the closed womb.”\n\nBukowski implies that if you have to try to try, if you have to try to care about something, to try to want something, perhaps you don’t care about it, perhaps you don’t want it. It’s not that Bukowski didn’t try, he never tried to be something he wasn’t. He tried to be a writer, but he didn’t try to want to be a writer.\n\nIf the pain and endurance of the process of becoming something do not feel worth it and if you are not compelled to do it even in the face of rejection, it is here that Bukowski would say “Don’t try”. But if it does, if the thought of not doing it hurts more than suffering through the process, if the thought of life without it, or not having tried it at all terrifies you. If it comes to you, through you, out of you, almost as if you are not trying, perhaps Bukowski might say here, “Try” and “If you are going to try, go all the way.”\n\n. . .\n\nso you want to be a writer?\n\nif it doesn’t come bursting out of you\n\nin spite of everything,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless it comes unasked out of your\n\nheart and your mind and your mouth\n\nand your gut,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you have to sit for hours\n\nstaring at your computer screen\n\nor hunched over your\n\ntypewriter\n\nsearching for words,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re doing it for money or\n\nfame,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re doing it because you want\n\nwomen in your bed,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you have to sit there and\n\nrewrite it again and again,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif it’s hard work just thinking about doing it,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re trying to write like somebody\n\nelse,\n\nforget about it.\n\nif you have to wait for it to roar out of\n\nyou,\n\nthen wait patiently.\n\nif it never does roar out of you,\n\ndo something else.\n\nif you first have to read it to your wife\n\nor your girlfriend or your boyfriend\n\nor your parents or to anybody at all,\n\nyou’re not ready.\n\ndon’t be like so many writers,\n\ndon’t be like so many thousands of\n\npeople who call themselves writers,\n\ndon’t be dull and boring and\n\npretentious, don’t be consumed with self-love.\n\nthe libraries of the world have\n\nyawned themselves to\n\nsleep\n\nover your kind.\n\ndon’t add to that.\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless it comes out of\n\nyour soul like a rocket,\n\nunless being still would\n\ndrive you to madness or\n\nsuicide or murder,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless the sun inside you is\n\nburning your gut,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nwhen it is truly time,\n\nand if you have been chosen,\n\nit will do it by\n\nitself and it will keep on doing it\n\nuntil you die or it dies in you.\n\nthere is no other way.\n\nand there never was.\n\n-Charles Bukowski"
