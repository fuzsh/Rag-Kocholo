        "text": "Kelly Corbett\n\nCharles Bukowski is considered to be either one of the most famous, or one of the most infamous American writers of the 20th century. The view you adopt is most likely related to what side of the “tracks” you are from. His writing represents the under-privileged people and shoves them in the faces of the upper echelon. He gives “voice” to these people, he is a witness to their lives, and he is one of them as well. Scholar Russell Harrison has said the following about Bukowski’s writing:\n\nI think it is the working class content of much of Bukowski’s work, rather than any so called “banality,” that is the sticking point for many academic critics as well as others.\n\nThis statement is an accurate one. I will prove this by providing samples of his work. I am only able to show you a glimpse into the immense body of his work. Bukowski was born in Germany, and he moved to America when he was 2. He endured an abusive childhood that was a source of torment and pain throughout his life. His writings are non-fiction, biographical, and are born from pain, the pain of his childhood, and the pain of surviving his life as one of the downtrodden members of American society. In 1986, Time magazine named him the “laureate of the America low-life.” He was a hero to the working class. His writing is transparent; it comes with no frills, it comes in whatever form it wants, and it says whatever he wants. The Bukowski reader does not have to “work” to decipher meaning. This may be why academia considered his work to be amateurish and banal. Bukowski had no concerns about what others may think about him or his work. I think this gave him freedom in his writing, and it is also was one of the many reasons his fans love him so fiercely. He was a survivor, and there was nothing that could stop his writing; not alcoholism, not whores, and certainly not working menial jobs. Through his sheer will, determination, and persistence he became a cult hero to the working class of America.\n\nIn his poem the trash men, Bukowski writes about a mundane working class job that many an American would love to have. Being a trash man requires little education and can provide some of the material goods that are “requirements” of the great “American dream.”\n\n…it’s quite exciting:\n\nshirts open\n\nbellies hanging out\n\nthey run out to the trash bins\n\nroll them out to the forklift\n\nthen the truck rolls them upward\n\nwith far too much sound…\n\n…they had to fill out application forms\n\nto get these jobs\n\nand they are paying for homes and\n\ndriving late model cars\n\nthey get drunk on Saturday night….. (lines 6-17)\n\nIn trash men, Bukowski shares his observations on the banality of every day life in America. He rejects the American dream by mocking these trash men and by telling them that they get drunk on Saturday nights; therefore they are no different than him.\n\nThe next poem I have selected is trashcan lives. In trashcan lives Bukowski compares democracy to dictatorship, and he makes no secret of his disdain for it. He also writes about the people that democracy has forgotten and neglected, these are the people that live on skid row.\n\n….it’s when you’re on the row\n\nthat you notice that\n\neverything\n\nis owned\n\nand that there are locks on\n\neverything.\n\nthis is the way a democracy\n\nworks:\n\nyou get what you can,\n\ntry to keep that\n\nand add to it\n\nif possible.\n\nthis is the way a dictatorship\n\nworks too\n\nonly they either enslave or\n\ndestroy their\n\nderelicts.\n\nwe just forgot ours.\n\nin either case\n\nit’s a hard\n\ncold\n\nwind. (7-21)\n\nBukowski lives among the people of skid row; he knows what it is like to be one of them. Through this poem he files his complaint with the people in power, better known as the “government”. He brings to light the plight of the poor.\n\nIn having the flu and nothing else to do Bukowski shames Dos Passos for hanging up his “political radical” hat and joining the masses. Dos Passos gave up the\n\n“good fight” in his older years and became one of “them.”\n\nI read a book about Dos Passos and according to this\n\none\n\nD.P. ended up in the Hollywood Hills reading the\n\nWall Street Journal.\n\nthis seems to happen often with many.\n\nwhat hardly ever happens is\n\na man going from being a young conservative to a\n\nwild-ass radical in old\n\nage.\n\nyoung conservatives become old\n\nconservatives\n\nbut when a young radical continues on to become an\n\nold radical\n\nhe is looked upon much like a man from a mental\n\ninstitution.\n\nsuch is politics and you can have\n\nit\n\nkeep it\n\nsail it in between the cheeks of your\n\nass. (1-20)\n\nIf politicians or any member of society view Bukowski as a mental case, he clearly does not care one fig. Bukowski stayed true to himself until the very end of his life; and I think he believes Dos Passos should have as well.\n\nIn How Is Your Heart? Bukowski examines how he has survived his hard-living lifestyle thus far and he asks the reader how they are surviving theirs.\n\nduring my worst times\n\non the park benches\n\nor living with\n\nwhores\n\nI always had this certain\n\ncontentment-\n\nI wouldn’t call it\n\nhappiness-\n\nit was more of an inner\n\nbalance\n\nthat settled for\n\nwhatever was occuring\n\nand it helped in the\n\nfactories\n\nand when relationships\n\nwent wrong\n\nwith the\n\ngirls…\n\nhow is your heart\n\nand to walk across the floor\n\nto an old dresser with a\n\ncracked mirror-\n\nsee myself, ugly\n\ngrinning at it all\n\nwhat matters most is\n\nhow well you\n\nwalk through the\n\nfire (1-19, 32-40)\n\nBukowski closes this poem with his now famous lines “what matters most is/how well you/walk through the/fire”; these are certainly words that will aim straight into the hearts of some readers. These lines offer some reasoning behind hard living, and they offer hope. Bukowski held his head high, he believed in himself, and he kept pressing forward with dogged determination.\n\nIn the poem Safe Bukowski rejects suburban life and again the idealization of the perception of the American dream.\n\nthe house next door makes me\n\nsad.\n\nboth man and wife rise early and\n\ngo to work……\n\nby 9 p.m. all the lights in the house\n\nare out…….\n\nthe house next door makes me\n\nsad.\n\nthe people are nice people, I\n\nlike them.\n\nbut I feel them drowning.\n\nand I cant save them.\n\nthey are surviving.\n\nthey are not\n\nhomeless.\n\nbut the price is\n\nterrible.\n\nBokowski chose his own way of surviving. He survived by using booze and whores, and by writing about it all every single day. I think Bukowski is sad for the people that are the subject of this poem. I also think it is arrogant of him to believe everyone should be sharing his path of survival.\n\nIn the poem Finished? Bukowski lets his readers know that even though he has acquired wealth and fame he is not finished. He begs us to ignore the critics, and even to please keep reading his poems, to please take the poems for what they are.\n\nthe critics now have me\n\ndrinking champagne and\n\ndriving a BMW\n\nand also married to a\n\nsocialite from\n\nPhiladelphia’s Main Line\n\nwhich of course is going to prevent me\n\nfrom writing my earthy\n\nand grubby stuff.\n\nand they might be\n\nright,\n\nI could be getting to be\n\nmore like them,\n\nand that’s as close to\n\ndeath as you can\n\nget.\n\nwe’ll see.\n\nbut don’t bury me yet.\n\ndon’t worry if I drink with\n\nSean Penn.\n\njust measure the poems\n\nas they come off the\n\nkeyboard.\n\nlisten only to them.\n\nafter this long fight\n\nI have no intention of\n\nquitting short.\n\nor late.\n\nor satisfied.\n\nThis poem also gives testimony to the unstoppable power of words that continued to burst forth from him until his death in 1994. Sheer will and his tenacity of spirit kept him writing day after day, despite the self-destructive lifestyle he led.\n\nI don’t think a Bukowski analysis would be complete without including some lines from Dinasouria, We. This poem is more commonly known by its’ line\n\n“born into this” that is repeated throughout the poem. Born Into This is also the title given to the documentary of his work and life.\n\n…Born like this\n\nInto this\n\nInto these carefully mad wars\n\nInto the sight of broken factory windows of emptiness\n\nInto bars where people no longer speak to each other\n\nInto fist fights that end as shootings and knifings\n\nBorn into this\n\nInto hospitals which are so expensive that it’s cheaper to die\n\nInto lawyers who charge so much it’s cheaper to plead guilty\n\nInto a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed\n\nInto a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes…\n\n…Made inhuman\n\nBy this\n\nThe heart is blackened\n\nThe fingers reach for the throat\n\nThe gun\n\nThe knife\n\nThe bomb\n\nThe fingers reach toward an unresponsive god\n\nThe fingers reach for the bottle\n\nThe pill\n\nThe powder\n\nWe are born into this sorrowful deadliness\n\nWe are born into a government 60 years in debt\n\nThat soon will be unable to even pay the interest on that debt\n\nAnd the banks will burn\n\nMoney will be useless…\n\n…Nuclear power will be taken over by the many\n\nExplosions will continually shake the earth\n\nRadiated robot men will stalk each other\n\nThe rich and the chosen will watch from space platforms\n\nDante’s Inferno will be made to look like a children’s playground\n\nThe sun will not be seen and it will always be night\n\nTrees will die\n\nAll vegetation will die…\n\n…The last few survivors will be overtaken by new and hideous diseases\n\nAnd the space platforms will be destroyed by attrition\n\nThe petering out of supplies\n\nThe natural effect of general decay\n\nAnd there will be the most beautiful silence never heard\n\nBorn out of that.\n\nThe sun still hidden there\n\nAwaiting the next chapter. (10-20, 34-49, 54-61, 67-74)\n\nIn this well-known poem Bukowski expresses his anger at this country, and this world. He feels it is unfair, but it’s simple fact that we are “born into this.” We are here; we all need to figure out how to survive this sometimes very cruel life while we are here. He shows how insignificant human life really is.\n\nI have shown through examples of his work that Charles Bukowski’s writing was not in the least banal. It may not be pretty, it may not be flowery, or it may be too vulgar. Vulgarity and transparency are excuses for those who say his writing is not of good quality. Bukowski’s poems are relatable, honest, raw, painful, and many more things. Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder; his fans love him with a deep passion. Bukowski was the voice and was the “laureate of the American lowlife” every day of his life. Harrison has also said “Bukowski’s work everywhere embodies, explicitly or implicitly, a rejection of the ideology of success and power.” That statement couldn’t possibly be more truthful; Charles Bukowski’s poems reject the glorification and ideology surrounding the way society defines success and power. He also rejected it by they ways he chose to survive his life."
