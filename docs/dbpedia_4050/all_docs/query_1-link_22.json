        "text": "Since the sixties, American academics have either dismissed or ignored the controversial American author Charles Bukowski (1920-1994), despite the fact that he is a counterculture hero in America as well as in Europe - especially in Germany, where he was born. Bukowski was an incredibly prolific author: his current works in print include ten volumes of poetry, six short-story collections, six novels, a travel book, a screenplay for the cult favorite Barfly, and a volume of letters, much of which has been translated into over a dozen languages. Obviously, he has a large and significant audience, yet not until his death over a decade ago did a critical book on him appear, Against the American Dream: Essays on Charles Bukowski (1994), by Russell Harrison. As Harrison's title indicates, Bukowski criticizes the American Dream, but that is probably not the reason for the dearth of criticism, since many writers join him in that. What makes him different, a persona non grata in academia, is that his work runs counter to what many American academics hold dear. His oft-noted vulgarity in form and content is one obstacle to acceptance, and another may be his \"tamer\" subject matter.\n\nThis last statement needs elaboration. Besides writing about the sexual and scatological, Bukowski often protests from first-hand knowledge the working-class life that so many must lead, so his writing can seem banal or even boring to many serious readers. Harrison says, \"It is the working-class content of much of Bukowski's work, rather than any so-called 'banality,' that is the sticking point for so many academic critics as well as for others\" (12).\n\nFor those who may not know much about Bukowski, the first part of this thesis first gives a detailed overview of the life and work of this intriguing man. Next, it discusses some of the writers who preceded him and whose work figures into his, including Ernest Hemingway, the lesser-known John Fante, and others. Finally, it attempts to place his work in context with that of four of his contemporaries: Raymond Carver, Kurt Vonnegut, Frederick Exley, and Hunter Thompson. In general, this thesis will focus upon Bukowski's prose; however, since the form and content of his poetry and prose are quite similar, as Bukowski himself occasionally noted, I will also call upon the poetry to support various points.\n\nWhether poetry or prose, much of Bukowski's work is autobiographically based; consequently, part two of this thesis investigates the persona of this persona non grata. Persona non grata translates into \"unwelcome person,\" yet it was Bukowski himself who prevented his welcome into many people's lives by writing a weekly column early in his career called \"Notes of a Dirty Old Man.\" The columns gained him fame, or infamy, and the \"dirty old man\" label stuck. The essential question of part two is whether it is Bukowski or the man represented by the persona who is non grata for some. The answer in brief is that both are often misunderstood."
