        "text": "In my latest post about Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock, I briefly alluded to my favorite poem of all time, “The Tragedy of the Leaves,” by Charles Bukowski:\n\nI awakened to dryness and the ferns were dead,\n\nthe potted plants yellow as corn;\n\nmy woman was gone\n\nand the empty bottles like bled corpses\n\nsurrounded me with their uselessness;\n\nthe sun was still good, though,\n\nand my landlady’s note cracked in fine and\n\nundemanding yellowness; what was needed now\n\nwas a good comedian, ancient style, a jester\n\nwith jokes upon absurd pain; pain is absurd\n\nbecause it exists, nothing more;\n\nI shaved carefully with an old razor\n\nthe man who had once been young and\n\nsaid to have genius; but\n\nthat’s the tragedy of the leaves,\n\nthe dead ferns, the dead plants;\n\nand I walked into a dark hall\n\nwhere the landlady stood\n\nexecrating and final,\n\nsending me to hell,\n\nwaving her fat, sweaty arms\n\nand screaming\n\nscreaming for rent\n\nbecause the world has failed us\n\nboth\n\nI remember reading this in my AP English class in twelfth grade and immediately being drawn into its dejected, hopeless tone (angsty teenager, I know) and the vivid, unromanticized imagery. My classmates didn’t seem to have the same response to this rather depressing poem, and, to be honest, I’m still not sure why I love it so much. But, at the end of the year, we were given an assignment to analyze our favorite piece of work. Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to further delve into the world of Charles Bukowski and develop a better understanding of the man behind this poem I love so much and, in turn, learn more about the depth of the poem itself.\n\nBelow is my essay. Reading it now, I cringe a little at the writing. However, I am still proud of it and this was actually lauded by my English teacher when he awarded me the best English Student of the Year award at graduation. It’s a small accomplishment, and I’m somewhat embarrassed to seemingly brag about it, but as a lover of all things literature and writing, it still is one of my proudest moments. A moment in which my passion for the subject was recognized and appreciated.\n\nJune 1, 2015\n\nKnown as the “laureate of the low-life,” Charles Bukowski served as the voice of the underprivileged, lower half of the socio-economic spectrum for four decades. His work ranges from angry reflections on his shambled love life to cynical advice for aspiring writers. With his unique blend of vulgarity and vulnerability, the author and poet developed a potent portfolio of work that resonates with individuals from all backgrounds. In the poem “The Tragedy of the Leaves,” Charles Bukowski’s relatable source of inspiration and style of writing convey the universality of suffering in the world and the overwhelming capabilities of the misery that permeates all people.\n\nGrowing up in the Depression Era, Bukowski observed and experienced first-hand the despair of the working class and applied these memories in poems such as this one. A series of tragic events built upon each other to render the writer we know today. Born to parents who attempted to mask their poverty with a veneer of elegance, Bukowski faced humiliation and failure at an early age, attending a school of wealthy children in which he did not fit in due to his economic status and his dyslexia. To further his emotional frailty, Bukowski’s father began abusing him and his mother when he was a young boy. The author had a poisoned relationship with his parents, including his mother, which lent itself to his subpar opinion of women. Furthermore, he had a terrible case of acne vulgaris during his teen years, a formative time period for self-esteem and character development. Bukowski described it as “all the withheld screams- spouting out in another form” (Sounes 12). Having such emotional and physical turmoil must have resulted in making Bukowski the antisocial, self-loathing, and reckless individual who felt that the world is out of his control- the same character portrayed in his pieces. Like the narrator of “The Tragedy of the Leaves,” Bukowski felt as though the universe had repeatedly disappointed him. The poet failed numerous times to become successful but ultimately blossomed in a time when “beat poetry” was the new literary revolution. The name “beat poetry” comes from the idea of these writers being “beaten” down by society but also gifted with the talent to depict the rundown lifestyle in their writing (Matterson). Charles Bukowski was not officially a beat poet, but his style matched some of the characteristics of these artists. The concentration on the lower class can be seen in the description of the apartment the narrator of the poem lives in. Surrounded by “dead ferns” and “dark hall[s],” the narrator clearly lives in a dilapidated residence (ll. 16-17). Poverty and hopelessness drifts through the corridors as it does through the lines of the poem. Like beat poets, Bukowski explored the lives of the marginalized, such as himself, and embodied the thousands of individuals of the proletariat otherwise unrepresented in poetry.\n\nIn representing the lower class, Bukowski applies a simplistic style of writing that opens poetry up to the masses and moves away from the elitist sentimentalities that previously devoured the art style. According to literary critic John Corrington, “Bukowski’s work represents a renewal of interest in the poet as something other than thinker and civilized representative of the University Establishment.” Bukowski stands as the forefront of the movement away from complex, intellectual poetry towards more simple poetry that everyone can understand. Over the years, poetry has followed a trend of becoming complicated and verbose, seeking intellectual praise rather than general praise. It has ostracized the general population from poetry. Bukowski acts as the doorway between poetry and the average man that, for so long, has been closed off by symbol-seekers and thesaurus addicts. His style can be defined as surface poetry which focuses on the immediate, tangible parts of life- “the flesh, the surface of the human condition” (Corrington). Rather than delving into analyses of the human psyche, his poems concentrate on giving a picture of the world he knows. In this poem, Bukowski does not attempt to explain why he believes that suffering is “absurd” or why there is suffering in the world; there just is (l. 10). He simply provides a detailed, unnerving image of poverty. He renders a raw, gritty picture of life as a struggling artist. This style of poetry- unpolished and untainted- reflects the humanity of the very humans he aims to portray in his writing.\n\nIn this poem, Bukowski constructs the all-encompassing characteristic of misery and, in doing so, suggests that the source of all suffering is human nature itself. Ambition and expectations play a central role in this work. Looking into the mirror, the narrator sees a broken man who was once “said to have genius” (l. 14). Similar to the once lush green leaves wilting on the branches and falling to the ground as tattered corpses, the artist, once disconnected from his fountain of inspiration is left lifeless and purposeless. The more devastating factor for the artist is not his failures but his expectation of success. In the final lines of the poem, Bukowski reveals that the suffering the reader observes in the narrator is not contained within this single being. Rather, the pain encompasses everyone in the poem, including the landlady who had been previously painted as the villain. The narrator relates to the landlady who expected rent on time so she could make ends meet, admitting that “the world has failed us both” (ll. 24-25). Bukowski unveils the prevalence of sorrow in society. By using the first person personal plural pronoun “us,” the poet implies that this suffering is mutual-that no one is left undamaged by the struggles of life.\n\nThus, through the abrasive yet soothing blend of a complex source of inspiration and a simple style, Charles Bukowski conducts a thorough meditation on the roots of suffering in humanity and uncovers the omnipresence of misery in the world in the poem “The Tragedy of the Leaves.” The piece reflects on the negative aspects of aspiration- the side that most people fail to acknowledge but Bukowski was fully aware of through his experiences in life. However, it also brings into question our behavior towards one another. When suffering is mutual, when misery is universal, there exists an invisible bond between all of humanity- a bond that should be held sacred but is most often dismissed. It questions whether those we despise or treat with contempt truly deserve our behavior or, if we listen to their stories, we will find that they are suffering just like us.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBukowski, Charles. “The Tragedy of the Leaves.” It Catches My Heart in Its Hands: New and Selected Poems 1955-1963.
