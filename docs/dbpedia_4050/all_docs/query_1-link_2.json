        "text": "Ever since I was able to read I did so, that's why I chose to go to college and study British Literature. Having read the classics served a good purpose, but it wasn't until I deviated from the orthodox ways of academia that I really found a niche of authors that seemed to be writing exactly what I had in mind but couldn't express with eloquency. I do believe that Bukowski is the highest point in American lit, not to say that many other writers have not been quintessential to the development of literature in this country, but somehow Hank epitomizes the feeling of hopelessness and despair that Sartre so well described in his essays and stories. What are your opinions?\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>His novel \"The Wasp Factory\" was recently voted by The Times as one of the top 100 novels ever written. <P> <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks for the heads-up. I will have to check him out once/if I have some real reading time. Ugh, tech manuals will drain the soul right out of a person. View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_frown.gif <P>Oh, I forgot to mention Henry Miller. Tropic of Cancer is one of my favorite literary works. I will never forget reading Miller's desciption of himself, half starved, dressed in rags and completely devoid of pride as he \"wandered the streets of Paris like a ghost\".\n\nGood choices indeed! On the subject of Iain Banks, most of his work is hard to get since no American publisher is too keen on the controversial nature of Banks' books. <P>However, The Wasp Factory is one of the titles that is available in the US. Another title by Banks available as a domestic edition is The Bridge, which blew my mind. <P>He also writes sci-fi under the name Iain M. Banks (not too creative there, just added his middle initial), and if you like that genre he's the most awesome writer I've ever read. He begins where everyone else left off.<P>Literature and musi and tech are my life support system.\n\nI used to love reading Bukowski. I used to love drinking and tapping on a manual typewriter too. Ham on Rye is probably the only prose of his I would read again. I think I read every single book that Black Sparrow published. I tried re-reading Factotum a few years ago, but there really wasn't anything new for me in it. His poetry is superb, and now that I think about it I am going to find some tomorrow.<P>He is not the highest point in american lit. by any means, not even the highest since WWII. Kesey's Sometime a Great Notion is certainly better than any of Bukowski's novels, in my opinion. If you want to read a moody piece about urban nightlife, try Wm. Kennedy's \"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game.\"\n\nThat was a cool letter, and funny too! Thanks .<P><BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>As for the high point in American lit, Buk ain't it. In fact, his prose is probably some of my least favorite on my shelf. (or in my boxes, if you want to get technical) He's right up there with Pynchon in \"most overrated American authors\"<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I agree that his prose is not pretty. As part of the Realist movement he really didn't care as much for the surface as he did for the content and overall meaning of his works.<BR>Reminds of another writer that had a horrific prose, H.P. Lovecraft, but that throughout the years has been recognized as having a volume of work superior to Poe's in the same genre.<P><BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>On Iain Banks, if you like Banks but are not up to being kicked in the guts (Wasp Factory, Song of Stone) you might try Whit and The Crow Road which are both available from Abacus<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yes, I'm aware of that. I have all his books, both as Iain Banks as well as his sci-fi works as Iain M. Banks. The titles that were unavailable in the US I had them sent by friends in the UK.<BR>I enjoyed \"Espedair Street\", \"Complicity\", and particularly \"Walking on Glass\" tremendously as well.<P>I do have some of his CD's and sometimes as I type I listen to Buk's voice it reminds me of how many obstacles he had to deal with to keep himself faithful to his unveering desire to write whatever the hell he saw fit. Although born in Germany, I see Buk as the prototype American hero.\n\nA comment on this thread. British literature, post Chaucer of course, saw a vast amount of great writers go unrecognized because their private lives greatly interfered with the customs and the approved behavior dictated by arbitrary standards.<P>Therefore real genious was shunned when the private life didn't meet the requirements of a non forgiving society. Authors like DeQuincy, Marlowe, even Lord Byron and Percy Shelley were practically ignored at the time (mercifully the historic revision brought them back to where they belonged in the first place), simply because they indulged in opium and homosexual activities.<P>A perfect example of this ridiculous approach is Oscar Wilde, who went from being l'enfant terrible of the literary scene all the way to an infamous prisoner solely due to his relationship with the son of Lord Quensberry.<BR> This article is quite interesting and gives an idea of the depth of obtusiveness prevalent in British society at the time.<P>\"Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught\".<BR>Oscar Wilde.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR> Therefore real genious was shunned when the private life didn't meet the requirements of a non forgiving society <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Sometimes, society is full of \"Morons\"<P>I have met many people along this road called life. It seems to me (anyway) that most people never \"meet the requirements of a non forgiving society\".<BR>If you do? Someone is waiting in the wings to take you down a notch.<P>Everyone has a story, that should be told.<BR>We all have a bit of \"real genious\" in us, that's dieing to get out.<P>(my .002)\n\nlike in a chair the color of the sun<BR>as you listen to lazy piano music<BR>and the aircraft overhead are not<BR>at war.<BR>where the last drink is as good as <BR>the first<BR>and you realized that the promises<BR>you made yourself were<BR>kept.<BR>that's plenty.<BR>that last: about the promises:<BR>what's not so good is that the few<BR>friends you had are<BR>dead and they seem<BR>irreplaceable.<BR>as for women, you didn't know enough<BR>early enough<BR>and you knew enough<BR>too late.<BR>and if more self-analysis is allowed: it's<BR>nice that you turned out well-<BR>honed,<BR>that you arrived late<BR>and remained generally<BR>capable.<BR>outside of that, not much to say<BR>except you can leave without<BR>regret.<BR>until then, a bit more amusement,<BR>a bit more endurance,<BR>leaning back<BR>into it.<BR>like the dog who got across<BR>the busy street:<BR>not all of it was good<BR>luck.<P>Charles Bukowski.\n\nA few points in response. Though victorian england had a habit of destroying their young gneius writers, I find that we have the exact opposite habit in this era. The crazy, the drunk, the fool, and the womanizer are all held to be naturally better writers, and I find that a bit irritating. Hunter Thompson, Thomas Pynchon, Vonnegut, David Foster Wallace. I prefer a bit of insight, mixed with a strong bit of writing ability. <P>In starting the newer thread, I had just hoped we could post favorites that stepped a bit outside the high school/English 101 canon. I want someting a bit newer. As that post has died, unfortunately, I will post my list here.<P>As I said before--Cormac McCarthy, especially Blood Meridian and The Crossing. William Kennedy's Albany novels. Lampedusa's The Leopard, for amusement--Matt Ruff's Sewer Gas Electric. Durrel's Justine (but only get it used--he was a evil wife beating bastard). Steven Millhauser's Little Kingdoms. Helprin's Winters Tale. <P>\"He took up her stiff head out of the leaves and held it or he reached to hold what cannot be held, what already ran among the mountains at once terrible and of a great beauty, like flowers that feed on flesh. What blood and bone are mode of but can themselves not make on any altar nor by any wound of war. What we may well believe has power to cut and shape and hollow out teh dark form of the world surely if wind can, if rain can. But which cannot be held never be held and is no flower but is swift and a huntress and the wind itself is in terror of it and the world cannot lose it.\"<P>Last lines of page 127 of the crossing. Those 127 pages are my favorite pieces of writing, ever. Fierce and wonderful.<P>B\n\nI will definetely look into your recomendations as I liked that excerpt a lot.<P>Have you read Boris Vian? Fantastic French writer (among other things, he was also a jazz musician), his work is not that extensive since he died very young, but I've always had him as a true genious. His prose is poetry in motion.<P>If you read French I'd recomend \"L'ecoume du jours\" Or \"The foam of the Days\" as it translates to English.<P>I do think that everyone who posts in this thread will benefit from each other's experience and will discover new things.<P>As Andre Gide once wrote:<P>\"No-one has ever discover new lands without losing site of the shore\".\n\nI used to be fluent in four languages: English, French, Italian, and Spanish. I'm down to two at the time simply because I can't practice my French and Italian enough.<P>I was pondering the issue of writers and how much the content means, as opposed to beautiful prose that goes on and on for pages describing something to saturation.<P>Marcel Proust is a fine example of the latter. Although I won't criticize his \"A la Recherche du Temps Perdu\", I think that all those volumes could have been reduced quite a bit. Of course, the rococo style ans melifluous innuendo were his way of communicating.<P>I much rather read Mikhail Bulgakov and leave some room for my own imagination when it comes to characters and situations. Hence my love for Buk: he was able with just a few lines to summon the most incredible visions and feelings out of me.<P>Still waiting for a nice compilation of American writers. As I grew up and attended a British school, my formative years were filled by the most recognized british writers, and it wasn't until later on that I picked up on American artists.<P>I do remember though, being totally taken by Robert Sheckley, Theodore Sturgeon, and a slew of sci-fi writers when I first ventured into American literature.\n\nJane Anne Phillips--Shelter<BR>Nelson Algren--Man with the Golden Arm. <P>I have had greatluck with the National Book award--the choices are typically excellent. Though I tend to try the nominees as well. Unforutnaltely, my taste runs towards language first--which is why I tend to like Marquez and Dylan Thomas (and magical realism of all sorts, too, and not a Buk fan (as much). Oddly, I found \"A remembrance of things past\" a bit too irritating--instead of evocative language, I found it endlessly dull and repetitive. I think too much is lost in translation. I wish I spoke french and spanish. <P>If you can find a good translation--I really enjoyed Aus Dem Lebens Eines Fauns. I can't quite recall the author. I also enjoyed Der Man Ohne Qualitaten--Robert Musil. The English translation of the latter is quite good. Perfum (Susskind) is excellent as well. <P>Unfortunately, I have lost what german I had, and can no longer really appreciate the literature. If you want to practice you Italian, The Leopard (Lampedusa) is Italian originally. <P>B\n\nWell, as several friends and I just started a book club, this is both topical and enlightening. I especially appreciated hiphink's link, as such value on pretense over content prevades many graduate programs (including science). Some of the authors listed sound like very heady reading, but I'm intrigued to learn a bit more about some of your favorites. Any chance you could give a short bio on the style of some of the writers you all have listed. I also appreciated the included passages and poems. It's been a while since I've delved into poetry, but it on our club list for this summer, so a couple of recommendations would be greatly appreciated. What collection is the Bukowski poem from, I believe I would like to read more of that. <P>Thanks for an interesting discusion which has completely avoided the normal SB conflicts.<P>Cheers,<P>MHTH\n\nJust a short reply as I'm pressed for time now. MHTH and Infopro. The book where that Bukowski poem appears is \"What matters most is how well you walk through the fire\"<P>These are poems written between 1970 and 1990, and are part of an archive that Charles Bukowski left to be published after his death.<P>This book was published on 1999, 5 years after his death.<P>I will get back to this thread with more information and details after I come back home tonight. Cheers."
