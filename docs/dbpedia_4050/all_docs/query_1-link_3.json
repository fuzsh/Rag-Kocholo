        "text": "Charles Bukowski was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer, born in 1920. Bukowski, who was also called “Hank” or “Buk“ is often associated with the “Dirty Realism” literary movement and is considered as one of the most influential poets of the 20th century.\n\nBukowski’s works are characterized by a straightforward style, describing the harsh reality of existence, raising subjects such as alcoholism, addictions, authenticity, fulfillment, poverty, love, or sadness.\n\nCharles shares a specific rebellious and unconventional spirit, questioning society’s norms and pushing boundaries of raw authenticity. Additionally, he wasn’t afraid of confronting the darker aspects of life, human conditions, and overstepping authorities.\n\nBukowski’s writing style, marked by a rejection of traditional poetic conventions, made him a pioneer of a more accessible and relatable form of poetry that touches upon the harsh realities of life. And that raw honesty and authenticity is something that resonates with many readers.\n\nEven though Bukowski was far from a perfect example of moral life, his works reflect a deep understanding of human nature and a celebration of the human spirit in all its flaws. His ability to capture the essence of everyday life and present it unapologetically left a lasting impact on modern poetry.\n\nAnd this resilient Bukowski's works offer various life lessons that we can take, such as embracing authenticity, and uniqueness, pursuing passions, not settling for a life devoid of meaning or fulfillment, and embracing the imperfections and power of self-belief.\n\n1. Roll The Dice\n\nOne of Bukowski's most popular and inspiring poems is \"Roll The Dice\". In this poem, he encourages readers to take risks because the pursuit of freedom and dreams outweigh the consequences of it, such as suffering and humiliation. The title itself refers to gambling, a sport where many are likely to take a loss.\n\nBukowski advises against going the safe route and settling for a comfortable, stable, and predictable life. True fulfillment can only be achieved by taking bold actions.\n\n“if you’re going to try, go all the\n\nway.\n\notherwise, don’t even start.\n\nif you’re going to try, go all the\n\nway. this could mean losing girlfriends,\n\nwives, relatives, jobs and\n\nmaybe your mind.\n\ngo all the way.\n\nit could mean not eating for 3 or\n\n4 days.\n\nit could mean freezing on a\n\npark bench.\n\nit could mean jail,\n\nit could mean derision,\n\nmockery,\n\nisolation.\n\nisolation is the gift,\n\nall the others are a test of your\n\nendurance, of\n\nhow much you really want to\n\ndo it.\n\nand you’ll do it\n\ndespite rejection and the\n\nworst odds\n\nand it will be better than\n\nanything else\n\nyou can imagine.\n\nif you’re going to try,\n\ngo all the way.\n\nthere is no other feeling like\n\nthat.\n\nyou will be alone with the\n\ngods\n\nand the nights will flame with\n\nfire.\n\ndo it, do it, do it.\n\ndo it.\n\nall the way\n\nall the way.\n\nyou will ride life straight to\n\nperfect laughter,\n\nit’s the only good fight\n\nthere is.”\n\nOne of the most powerful and resonating with people lines is the first one: “If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start.“ In my opinion, this is the essence of Bukowski’s poem, in which he stated that the consequences of going through paved paths and conventional routes are unfulfilling and limiting.\n\n“Huk”, who himself lived as an outsider, encourages individuals to question society’s norms to find real freedom. Additionally, he acknowledges that the pursuit of dreams requires commitment and the acceptance of hardships, criticism, and isolation. But you must be willing to follow the uncertain path to experience the reward, just like in gambling. All the prices to pay are incomparable to the possibility of attaining personal happiness and fulfillment.\n\nIn the motivational \"Roll the Dice\", Bukowski inspires people to overcome their fears and embrace uncertainty with a high amount of determination. His powerful words encourage readers to live on their own terms and take advantage of every opportunity.\n\n2. The Laughing Heart\n\nAnother inspirational and empowering poem by Bukowski is “The Laughing Heart“, in which he, as in “Roll The Dice“ encourages readers to embrace life on their own terms and resist conformity. He begins poems with powerful lines, urging us to avoid the influence of external pressures and social expectations.\n\nThis poem is about not ending up in uninspired existence and actively seeking opportunities to escape the rat race, but also pursuing growth and freedom. The motivational message encourages us to embrace opportunities even in dark times.\n\n“your life is your life\n\ndon’t let it be clubbed into dank submission.\n\nbe on the watch.\n\nthere are ways out.\n\nthere is light somewhere.\n\nit may not be much light but\n\nit beats the darkness.\n\nbe on the watch.\n\nthe gods will offer you chances.\n\nknow them.\n\ntake them.\n\nyou can’t beat death but\n\nyou can beat death in life, sometimes.\n\nand the more often you learn to do it,\n\nthe more light there will be.\n\nyour life is your life.\n\nknow it while you have it.\n\nyou are marvelous\n\nthe gods wait to delight\n\nin you.”\n\n“There is a light somewhere“ - Bukowski suggests that opportunities will always arise, and these chances presented by the universe or gods might occur in various forms. Our task is to actively seek and recognize opportunities. After recognition, we have to seize them without hesitation because it can beat the limitations of our lives and allow us to experience a feeling of victory over the inevitability of our mortality.\n\nAnd this somehow reminds me of a famous quote by Steve Jobs:\n\n“When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is everything around that you call life was made up by people who were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. […] Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.“\n\nAdditionally, “Hank“ emphasizes the importance of optimism because even in hard times, there may be a little spark of hope and light that can guide us toward a more fulfilling existence.\n\nWhat’s inspiring about that poem is the message about hope and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It’s a powerful reminder to live authentically and fully by taking risks and pursuing passions. The awareness of fleeting nature and death in this poem is not depressing. It's quite the opposite. Bukowski presents it as something encouraging to overcome obstacles and possessing qualities that allow us to live on our terms and strive for what is authentic.\n\nThe message this poem carries is full of hope and resilience. Even if there’s not much that we can do about existence and death, we can at least beat deaths in our lives.\n\n3. The Genius of the Crowd\n\nBukowski, who lived outside of society, wrote a thought-provoking poem that touches upon darker aspects of human nature and the paradoxes of society. He exposes the hypocrisies of community and highlights the importance of critical thinking, questioning society’s norms, and avoiding following those who claim to have all the answers.\n\nAs in previous poems, Bukowski offers a critical perspective on society, conformity, and blindly following others. The poem encourages readers to be more aware and self-conscious, especially as individuals in society’s structure and hierarchy.\n\n“there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average\n\nhuman being to supply any given army on any given day\n\nand the best at murder are those who preach against it\n\nand the best at hate are those who preach love\n\nand the best at war finally are those who preach peace\n\nthose who preach god, need god\n\nthose who preach peace do not have peace\n\nthose who preach peace do not have love\n\nbeware the preachers\n\nbeware the knowers\n\nbeware those who are always reading books\n\nbeware those who either detest poverty\n\nor are proud of it\n\nbeware those quick to praise\n\nfor they need praise in return\n\nbeware those who are quick to censor\n\nthey are afraid of what they do not know\n\nbeware those who seek constant crowds for\n\nthey are nothing alone\n\nbeware the average man the average woman\n\nbeware their love, their love is average\n\nseeks average\n\nbut there is genius in their hatred\n\nthere is enough genius in their hatred to kill you\n\nto kill anybody\n\nnot wanting solitude\n\nnot understanding solitude\n\nthey will attempt to destroy anything\n\nthat differs from their own\n\nnot being able to create art\n\nthey will not understand art\n\nthey will consider their failure as creators\n\nonly as a failure of the world\n\nnot being able to love fully\n\nthey will believe your love incomplete\n\nand then they will hate you\n\nand their hatred will be perfect\n\nlike a shining diamond\n\nlike a knife\n\nlike a mountain\n\nlike a tiger\n\nlike hemlock\n\ntheir finest art”\n\nBukowski urges to disrupt the conventional understanding of society, authorities, and morality. He encourages and invites us to recognize hidden brilliance within our contradictions and find inspiration in unconventional and thought-provoking realms of our own minds.\n\nHis observations show that those who claim to advocate for peace often do not possess true peace within themselves. Similarly, those who preach about God or religion are often the ones who are most in need of a spiritual foundation.\n\nBukowski invites readers to reflect on the artificial qualities of society as well as dwell on our minds, flaws, and imperfections as a source of creativity. He suggests that true art and profound understanding arise within us, and the ones who are in power may often reject that vision.\n\nWhat’s interesting in “The Genius of the Crowd” is that we can view it not only as a simple warning against conformity but embracing the complexity of the human condition, which should motivate us to avoid people or leaders who claim to have answers because our nature is way too much complex.\n\nBukowski challenges the conformity of the crowd and encourages a deeper exploration of our own uniqueness.\n\n4. Style\n\n“Style“, similarly to the above-mentioned poems reflects on the importance of individuality. In this poem, Bukowski encourages us to find our unique voice and way of expressing ourselves. He invites individuals to embrace their style and not be swayed by external expectations or judgments.\n\nBukowski explores the concept of style and its importance. He presents style as a means to approach and transform mundane activities into art. “Hank“ suggests that adopting a unique approach and a distinctive manner of doing things, can enhance even the most ordinary or dangerous tasks.\n\n“Style is the answer to everything\n\nA fresh way to approach a\n\nDull or dangerous thing\n\nTo do a dull thing with style is preferable\n\nTo doing a dangerous thing without it\n\nTo do a dangerous thing with style\n\nIs what I call art\n\nBullfighting can be an art\n\nBoxing can be an art, Loving can be an art\n\nOpening a can of sardines can be an art\n\nNot many have style not many can keep style\n\nI have seen dogs with more style than men\n\nAlthough not many dogs have style\n\nCats have it with abundance\n\nWhen Hemingway put his brains to\n\nThe wall with a shotgun, That was style\n\nOr sometimes people give you style\n\nJoan of Arc had style, John the Baptist\n\nChrist, Socrates\n\nCaesar, García Lorca\n\nI have met men in jail with style\n\nI have met more men in jail with\n\nStyle than men out of jail\n\nStyle is the difference, a way of doing\n\nA way of being done\n\nSix herons standing quietly in\n\nA pool of water\n\nOr you walking out of the bathroom, naked\n\nWithout seeing me”\n\nBukowski implies that style is a rare quality possessed by few individuals. Humorously, he suggests that he saw dogs with more style than men, although not many dogs have style. “Buk“ provides examples of individuals throughout history who exhibited style in their actions, such as Hemingway, Joan of Arc, or Jesus.\n\nAdditionally, what’s common in Bukowski’s poem, he challenges conventions like he did in “Roll the Dice“ or “The Genius of the Crowd“, in this case, he questions the conventional notion of style. He states that he encountered more men with style in jail than outside of it. “Hank“ thinks that people who experienced hardships and struggles may develop a unique and authentic sense of style.\n\nThe end of this poem highlights the essence of naturalness and individuality by describing a final image of someone walking naked out of the bathroom without noticing the presence of another person. As we previously noticed in Bukowski’s works, he often emphasizes the importance of individuality and possessing unique qualities. In “Style“ Bukowski suggests that true style is not concerned with society’s norms.\n\nCharles highlights the rarity of true style, the variety of its manifestations, and the ability to give life a sense of uniqueness and beauty.\n\nSummary:\n\nBukowski shared a rebellious and unconventional nature, each of these poems explores distinct themes and perspectives, but together they offer a multifaceted exploration of life, individuality, and the challenges and joys of existence.\n\n“If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start.“ You must be willing to follow the uncertain path to experience the reward, just like in gambling.\n\n“There is light somewhere“. Avoid the influence of external pressures and social expectations. Escape rat race and pursue growth by actively seeking opportunities.\n\n“And the best at hate are those who preach love”. Be aware of society’s hypocrisy and contradictions. Those who speak out against negative traits are exempt from them.\n\n“Style is answer to everything“. Find your own unique voice and way of expressing yourself. Don’t let your style be swayed by external expectations and social judgments."
