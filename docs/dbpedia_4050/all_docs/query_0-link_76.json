Couldn't help but wonder what the old Buk would think of his arrival; arriv√© at last, or more in line with the previous commentator: power to the people?\n\nFrom the correspondence on display in the exhibit it was clear that Bukowski had an extraordinary relationship with his publisher, craved and received and thrived on the attention from his readership. Just like any of us, intoxicated or not.\n\nTo listen and see him read about reading at a university drives home the message that Bukowski indeed wrote for the common man while he knew how to reach The Other.\n\nLoved reading about his love for classical music and how that was triggered, not by upbringing, or a music teacher in school, but by hearing something that grabbed him from the next listening booth over at his fave music store and how with the help of the store's owner he made his way through the whole classical collection.\n\nHave enjoyed Bukowski's voice since I laid hands on his work in the 80's, and have renewed interest in reading his whole oeuvre thanks to this show.\n\nWish it could/ would/ will travel, or at least that the Huntington Library will digitalize the whole lot. Got to love that institution!"
