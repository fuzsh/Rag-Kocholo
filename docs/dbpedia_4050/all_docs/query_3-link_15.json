        "text": "His persona dominates the voice in his work. Not fair to separate the persona from the work. And what makes his work compelling is truly subjective, but for me it's his deadpan confessional style, his fatalism, his \"bad\" attitudes, his functional & unrepentant alcoholism, his bravado, his humour, his willingness to show his soft sides and weaknesses, his confessions of loss & rejections, and his overall misanthropic view of humanity.\n\nHis actual writing style, the craft of how he laid down the lines, is known as workman-like. Simple, direct, and un-pretentious. Like a security-related incident report with colourful feelings & remarks allowed to remain.\n\nBuk really did not belong to any movement other than the Cult of Bukowski.\n\nHe can be classified as a mid to late 20th Century, non-academic writer, poet, and novelist, and that's about it, really. He didn't join any particular wave with regards to style & substance. He wasn't doing the Beat thing (Jazz, mysticism, enlightenment, skiving, etc). He was a working-class alcoholic agnostic who was usually employed full time until the age of 50. His biggest influence was Fante and that dude weren't no literary darling or beatnik, he was in fact an outsider, an independant, a dude with heart writing with spirit and doing it unpretentiously; laying it down without trying to appear clever or fancy.\n\nYes.\n\nIn summary, Bukowski's work is unique because Bukowski was unique. Only 1 Bukowski per temporary world regardless of how long that world may last. Only 1 Kinision. Only 1 Bogosian or Hicks or Hendrix or Vai. And only 1 Newport, too.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nCheck out this up & coming axeman from Mexico:\n\nok, let's put it as simple as possible. most of you say that his most compelling factor is his simplicity. what about that simplicity? how do you think he achieved that? do you actually think his style is simple?\n\nLook, when it comes to books & writing you either like the ideas someone is expressing or their persona. Most of us gravitate to Bukowski because of his persona; we like his sense of humour and honesty; we like that he has an above average intelligence but doesn't write like William F. Buckley, Jr; we like the fact that he unashamedly enjoys alcohol, smoking, calling in sick to workhell, playing the horses, not giving a fuck about the Establishment or politics, and so on.\n\nHis simple lines were relative to the way he thought: slowly and carefully. He wrote about it somewhere...It had to do with his dad. He had to be careful how he spoke lest he got hit.\n\nIf you look at his earlier writings they already had simple lines but contained novice-writer's fat. As time went on, and he has wrote more & more, he gained the wisdom to think lines without fat and thus write the same.\n\nHis style was simple because he was simply writing the way he thought. Most writers seem to think you have to do anything but that. Anyone here can do it but most don't like their results because there is no persona shining through---or the one that is, is unattractive.\n\nHe wasn't reallly \"Cat In The Hat\" simple, as you so elegantly put it. He really wasnt that simple. Simple yes, as in you don't have to look real deep into his work to find an underlining meaning. All of it is really cut and dry. As for the words, they can be hard to understand to somebody whos vocabulary isnt really that wide.\n\nBut as to why Bukowski is so unique, I would say it's because of his pure love for the word. The fact that he never really gave up no matter how bleak it all looked. Yes, the spark I saved still has a chance...as he said in an interview. He never gave up.\n\nHe figured out how to let one simple line flow right after the other and never grew tired as he wrote so it didnt wear thin.\n\nPlus his writing appeals to everybody. No matter who you are in this life, you can always find something in Bukowski to relate to. It's that simple.\n\nOh, this is 'beautiful'. Let's put him in the conventional straightjacket of how most forgettable writers develop and say that he sat down one day and said to himself all self-consciously and all: \"Gee, how am I going to be? What style should I use? Who should I imitate? What f**kin' impression should I try to make? How should I try to impress people?\"\n\nDo you realize how few writer's lives and work meet on the same plane? A pitiful handful! It's a miracle that it's done at all, considering the usual pressure from publishers and the crass/mass commercial market. He stepped completely away from that because he knew it wasn't him. His style came because he wasn't trying to develop a style, or be anything, or try to impress. And yet there a people who propose to understand him who understand not that he did none of those things. Genius is coming from your own unique voice, and when you're reading him, you are not reminded of any outside influence, or the influence of another writer on his creative outpourings, other than what comes from within Bukowski himself.\n\nSo make it complicated then rather than organic. He was organic. His process of writing came to him. He didn't deliberately set out to say or be anything. It was \"Don't try.\" His life and work meet on the same plane, and that's why his voice is one powerful and unified whole. Try being simple sometime if you think it's so easy. But instead people want to complicate and obscure his creative process and say that it was because he deliberately and self-consciously set out to come up with a unique style or voice. Are we talking about the same Bukowski, or is there another one who wasn't simple at all and set out to deliberately imitate Hemingway, Celine, etc. and artificially create himself like a Frankenstein??because we can't be talking about the same B.\n\nPoptop\n\nWhat I've been wondering all along is: where does his style come from?\n\nAre you trying to stir up trouble like a troll?:D\n\nHis motherfucken style came from his motherfucken self!!!\"?$%^!!!!\n\nIt came from his personality, mind, imagination, memories, preferences.\n\nIt came from him, dig?\n\nFactory installed---stock.\n\nIt was a default style---no airs or graces or affectations. No attempts or immitations.\n\nWhere the hell do you think it could've possible come from? A can? A tree? A dog? A bicycle? A creative writing class? A poetry workshop? A box of crackerjacks?\n\nYou keep glossing over the persona thang and therefore gloss over the answer to your question.\n\nIf you're merely asking about the physical look/style of how the words are laid down and how the chapters are relatively short, then I would say: Out of all the various books I skimmed or redd by authors mentioned by Bukowski, none of them came closer to Buk's style than John Fante. Next in line, but not too close, would be Hemingway. After him, maybe Catullus.\n\nJust my two cents. Not better or worse than anyone else's. Just spot on. And, come to think of it, much better than everyone else's. Yea...that's right. What are you gonna do about it? :cool:\n\nmaybe I should re-type here my earlier question:\n\nI'm not trying to define his style. What I've been wondering all along is: where does his style come from?\n\nDear Cirerita,\n\nPlease don't take any of the following discussion personally. I may joke around and be challenging on this newsgroup, but I'm here to get to know everyone and stay on good terms.\n\nVariation #2\n\nAnswering such a standard literary question?which is what it is, and it can lead to false conclusions?is like trying to express the inexpressible or like trying to explain the sea to the fish who live in it. It cannot effectively be done, imo; only experienced.\n\nIt seems to me that you are trying to define his style by looking for some concrete reasons, methods or techniques you think are probably behind it (from \"where does his style come from?\"). You're looking for reasons behind his persona that he doesn't consciously have, imo. It wasn't a mask or persona; what you saw was essentially what you got. That is extremely rare among writers who last and why there are so few of them. (I consider Henry Miller and Anais Nin, her diaries, among them...but for me, Hemingway, no.)\n\nHis \"style\" comes from deliberately not having a style. It's not about incorporating any kind of an outside influence, but about avoiding them and allowing what's left to express itself naturally from deep within this wellspring of feeling, organically through the simple line, devoid of any extraneous pressure, influence or affectation.\n\nThis usually comes after reading a hell of a lot of other writers and finding out what you don't like about them, the literary tricks they're using, or what they're not saying that needs to be said. So you shed influences or find that you were never deeply influenced by them in the first place, in what I feel was the case with Mr. B.\n\nWhat's then left over becomes yours?or is you?and the \"style\" is not consciously performed or prefabricated; instead it's the product of the natural creative act of self-discovery. It's pure expression without the conscious mind standing in the way and blocking the source of inspiration. His style was the absence of style?or so it seems to me?and this is why his writing \"style\" is unmistakably identifiable as his. But just try to do it and it ain't so easy! And yet, he was still able to express complex emotions and complex thoughts, but they were organic and they came naturally out of the feelings of the moment. He didn't shape what came to him by use of what writers normally view as a style; he just got out of the way of it and put it directly down on paper like the champ he was. This is what I meant by stating that his life and work met on an equal plane. That is hardly an ordinary accomplishment, and let's not reduce this man's stature by comparing him to how most writers consciously try to develop their style through imitation, literary slight-of-hand, and contrived personas that are not a true reflection of their outer life or inner emotions. It's possible you underestimate how profound it is for the inner and outer life of this man, or any man or woman, to come together in such powerful creative harmony. It's a miracle.\n\nSincerely, Poptop\n\ndear poptop,\n\ndon't worry about joking, that's just fine. otherwise, this would be way tooo boring...\n\nanyway, your explanation as to where his sytle comes from may be right or not -subjective stuff is hardly right or wrong anyway- but you're dead wrong as to my approach to this question. you probably have forgotten the very first post where I said these are the questions I made to all the people I interviewed in the US while doing my research into B.'s poetry. When you make a question you obviously are somehow pinpointing where you want to go, but you don't usually answer the question, do you? So when I'm asking where does B.'s style come from I'm NOT excluding how important is his persona or his being or his brain or his heart or his dick in the creation of the morning line. I'm not looking for reasons nor for techniques. You may think I'm looking for that, but that's not the case. I just want to hear you out on this issue, that's all. If you think there's no technique at all, fine. If you think there's no reason, fine. If you think there are a million reasons, fine as well. I was just making a question and saying what B said regarding his own style. As far as I know, I haven't said what I think about this, have I? ;)\n\nanyway, just a final note. when you make a broad question such as \"Where do you think B.'s style comes from?\", you may get answers such as Brother's one: \"It comes from Bukowski himself, you moron\" ;) or you may get a lot of different answers: \"his discipline,\" \"his readings,\" \"alcohol,\" \"sex\", \"all that\", \"none of that,\" etc. but if you make very specific questions such as: \"do you think B.'s style is the outcome of his readings\", then you're narrowing everything down.\n\nwhen I was in the US I learnt it's much better to make broad questions because people tend to ramble on and on, but you usually get a lot of interesting info. Specific questions are normally used for very specific situations. so there :D"
