        "text": "No matter where you ask, all you'll ever get are opinions, so in some respect, there's not much point in asking.\n\nThat said, clearly I put Bukowski near the top of all writers, and there are a few main reasons why:\n\n1. His words are a brutally clear, yet complex reflection of who he was;\n\n2. His humor is spot on and well-placed;\n\n3. His facility with the poem, the short story and the novel cannot be overlooked in any assessment of prowess; and\n\n4. His best poems rank up there with the best works ever put to paper.\n\nSo how do I even go about comparing Buk to other writers I like - writers that are generally considered to be among the more popular \"classic\" writers, if not among the best? Let's consider Kafka, Solzhenitsyn, Steinbeck and Camus from the 20th century and even throw in Dosto(y)evsky for good measure. Where to begin? I get next nothing of Bukowski from these other writers, except for some broad similarity between Buk's sense of alienation from society and Kafka's portrayal of The System, Camus' portrayal of isolation, and Dos' underground. But these relationships are very tenuous, if they exist at all. If anything, I get more of Kafka, Solzhenitsyn, Steinbeck, Dos and Camus from Buk, but then again, I don't get much there either.\n\nSo Buk belongs with the best for me because he is a singular voice, not just prolific but often brilliant, and more than anything else, he speaks to me.\n\nok here is my criticism of bukowski's writing:\n\n1) bukowski does not challenge the reader : i'm not talking about his writing style per se. but most bukowski novels are easy reads. i personally have no problems with this.\n\nbut look at this quote by norman mailer: \"Great writers are not easy to read, and shouldn't be.\"\n\ni think bukowski's themes are repetitive. bukowski doesnt make the reader work hard. for example, in FACTOTUM nearly every chapter is the same with chinaski finding a new job. in women, every chapter finds chinaski with a new woman.it is the same thing repeated over and over again but its fun to read because of his craftsmanship and humor.\n\n2) bukowski was not an ambitious writer: you could argue that he knew what he knew and wrote only that. but bukowski is not someone who seemed to be interested in social inquiry (remember what he wrote about immigrants in HOLLYWOOD? - yes it was very honest but he didn't bother to find out why they were like that.) or who would go to great lengths to study history or a new profession to add variety to his repertoire. does anybody think he was pretty one dimensional?\n\nmore later.\n\ni don't really have a problem with the two points i mentioned in my post above. bukowski is my favorite writer. but i just put those arguments out there to find out what other people think.\n\nSo how do I even go about comparing Buk to other writers I like - writers that are generally considered to be among the more popular \"classic\" writers, if not among the best?

I truly have no idea what the responses will be. He was/is one of a kind, if that helps. Forgive any sarcastic tone, beerbelly666, enjoy reading your postings here.\n\ncheers. i agree, he was one of a kind. i think of bukowski as this boxer. a boxer with a pot belly and bad technique. he walked into a ring full of other great boxers (hemingway, mailer, burroughs, updike, steinbeck etc). and he sneered at them all. he out boxed them all. he landed punches which the other boxers took years to perfect. he did not work as hard as they did. but boy, when he nailed it he nailed it like no other. he hated boxing. but when he landed those punches of his, they rang true. somehow, they rang truer than the other boxers punches.\n\nwhat he did not have in terms of curiosity, knowledge and experience, he made up with audacity, guts and heart.\n\na truly unique writer. almost like a people's writer. a writer for the people. calling it like it was without any of the pompous bullshit.\n\nok here is my criticism of bukowski's writing:\n\n1) bukowski does not challenge the reader : i'm not talking about his writing style per se. but most bukowski novels are easy reads. i personally have no problems with this.\n\nbut look at this quote by norman mailer: \"Great writers are not easy to read, and shouldn't be.\"\n\ni think bukowski's themes are repetitive. bukowski doesnt make the reader work hard. for example, in FACTOTUM nearly every chapter is the same with chinaski finding a new job. in women, every chapter finds chinaski with a new woman.it is the same thing repeated over and over again but its fun to read because of his craftsmanship and humor.\n\n2) bukowski was not an ambitious writer: you could argue that he knew what he knew and wrote only that. but bukowski is not someone who seemed to be interested in social inquiry (remember what he wrote about immigrants in HOLLYWOOD? - yes it was very honest but he didn't bother to find out why they were like that.) or who would go to great lengths to study history or a new profession to add variety to his repertoire. does anybody think he was pretty one dimensional?\n\ncheers. i agree, he was one of a kind. i think of bukowski as this boxer. a boxer with a pot belly and bad technique. he walked into a ring full of other great boxers (hemingway, mailer, burroughs, updike, steinbeck etc). and he sneered at them all. he out boxed them all. he landed punches which the other boxers took years to perfect. he did not work as hard as they did. but boy, when he nailed it he nailed it like no other. he hated boxing. but when he landed those punches of his, they rang true. somehow, they rang truer than the other boxers punches...\n\nYou can say the same for Hemingway and he won the Nobel Prize. While I like him, he was all but redundant with endless metaphors and romantic descriptions that go on for pages and pages that nearly take you away from the story at hand, but nonetheless, an easy read. As a matter of fact, I find that annoying at times because I think HE lacked ambition in his writing for using the metaphor as a crutch instead of revealing himself as a writer as Bukowski did. Buk gave you HIMSELF, which is rare in what most of what these great writers have done throughout the centuries and that is the difference. Using plain language is not easy when crafting it together from a writers perspective. It might wind up an easy read for the reader, but it is not easy to pull off in actuality. Why don't you give it a try sometime?\n\nAmbition? Ha! Why don't you compare. Pile up the works side by side to Steinbeck, or anyone who won the Pulitzer and you will find Bukowski wrote just as many volumes if not more. This is about recognition and just because Bukowski did not receive the same recognition as Grapes of Wrath or Of Mice and Men doesn't mean he wasn't a great American writer. He was just an underdog. We here like to root for the genius underdog, so your argument won't sit well with some of us and you're going to get a counter argument, from me at least.\n\nYou have to understand that Buk could have written in a way that was difficult for you to read if he wanted to because he was smart enough to do that, but he was anti-academia. That was one of his stances in all of this - don't you get that? He thought about doing that on many occasions, but refused to do it because it rubbed him so wrong. He could have gone that route, but he stood firm and stuck to his style and knew all about what got attention, yet he stayed poor for many years as to not knock off EASY prose like that. I don't think you get how difficult it is to write in a way that appears effortless.\n\nI remember coming across an obituary in The Independent (UK) and I think he sums it up himself the best..\n\n'Poetry has always bothered me, right through the ages. I look at it and think, 'This isn't right, it's a fraud. It doesn't express things the way they are.' I want to open it up, make it clear. That doesn't mean it has to be nonsense, or not 'intelligent' - just more readable.'\n\nIt isn't clear whether that is a quote from an interview they had with him, and I'm not very good at remembering quotes, but i think in the context of the discussion going on here, it fits. One quote which they state was from the interview is...\n\n'It may sound egotistical, but I think I'll be a 'late discovery'. I think people will see the clarity and simplicity in my work, and appreciate it for those qualities.'\n\nAgain, quite befitting of the argument here.\n\nthe link is here http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-charles-bukowski-1429003.html\n\nPersonally, I never put things in lists. My girlfriend does all that. If she didn't we'd have two metric tons of toilet roll, 50 liters of water, two bags of prawn crackers, and nothing to feed the baby. However, I will say that it is a crying shame that film critics keep overlooking Speed 2: Cruise Control in favour of that silly Russian film Battleship Pokemon (that is it, isn't it?) when compiling the 100 greatest films.\n\nWhere does Bukowski stand among writers of the previous century?\n\nBukowski fares badly in terms of sales, a long way behind Chairman Mao, J. R. R. Tolkien and late-to-the-party J. K. Rowling.\n\nHe's omitted from most lists where critics try to compile the century's greatest writers, too. I often wonder why that's so.\n\nJoseph Conrad, Katherine Mansfield, Franz Kafka, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Vladimir Nabokov, Graham Greene, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, George Orwell, Henry Miller, Christopher Isherwood, Jean-Paul Sartre, Raymond Chandler, Flannery O'Connor, Philip Larkin, Raymond Carver, Haruki Murakami, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Auster. I love all these writers, and they're all more likely to find critical acceptance than Bukowski.\n\nEven Jim Thompson, William S. Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson are often more likely to find critical acceptance than Bukowski (I love them all too). That said, he's a firm favourite of academics and critics who place these kinds of writers above, say, Evelyn Waugh, which is more than you can claim for J. K. Rowling or Ayn Rand. He does often turn up in alternative versions of the literary canon.\n\nWriters' work is sometimes dismissed as genre fiction. Bukowski's problem is obviously something else. People can overlook Lester Bangs' stuff because they think of it as specialist (yep, love Bangs too), and Bukowski's work is sometimes damned as \"just for drunks\". He's dangerous and deceptively simple. You can say that about people more likely to get on the big critic lists, though.\n\nYour criticism, Mr beerbelly666, addresses some of the reasons his work struggles to find serious recognition. It struggles to challenge the reader, or rather the lazy reader. The repetitive nature of his work is positive, though. That's how I see it personally and the themes of plenty of \"officially great\" writers are repetitive.\n\nThe lack of ambition expressed as lack of social enquiry is a problem. That's a fault of some writers who appear in the literary cannon, though.\n\nHis peculiar combination of dangerous and deceptively simple is the biggest factor in the imbalance between his reputation and his work. Critics too often see him as facile, a misogynist etc. More important, they assume this defines his readership and that this combination of simple form and dangerous content is what most people will see.\n\nEven if they like him, they'll keep quiet because they know others see him only as an idiotic misogynist or whatever.\n\nWhat other writers give is indispensible. Bukowski is indispensible too, and he's also my favourite."
