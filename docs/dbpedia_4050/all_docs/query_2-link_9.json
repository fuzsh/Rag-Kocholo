        "text": "Charles Bukowski, a name synonymous with the gritty reality of life, was a 20th-century poet and novelist whose work continues to be a resonant voice for the more marginalized groups of society. Bukowski’s poems tell the story of the mundane aspects of life but also are highly relatable.\n\nDespite being heavily linked to LA and American poetry, Bukowski was originally from Germany. His life would be turbulent, and he would work menial jobs and not see much success in his efforts. It was after his death that he started to get the attention his works deserved.\n\nCharles Bukowksi’s poetry, prose, and fiction were known for their rawness, and ability to not conform to traditional elements. He did not sugarcoat his writing with flowery language or idealistic themes. Instead, he would center his work around the more unglamorous aspects of life.\n\nHis narrative works were filled with an endless supply of anecdotes, from visiting dingy motels to going to a horse race. He would write works based on his experiences with alcoholics and those on the outskirts of society, He took an unfiltered approach whilst giving an insight into life on the margins of society. He would garner great adulation from readers who felt they were isolated and misunderstood.\n\nEarly Life\n\nCharles Bukowski was shaped by his upbringing, which was filled with hardship, a common occurrence during the early 20th century. He was born on August 16, 1920, in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother. Bukowski’s full name was Henry Charles Bukowski, Jr., and his friends knew him as Hank.\n\nWhen Bukowski was only two years into his life, his parents would get up and move to the United States of America, from Europe. They would settle in Los Angeles, where he would start his poetic journey.\n\nHis father, Henry Bukowski, formally Heinrich, had served in the U.S. Army after the end of World War I. Despite being an American, he decided to stay in Germany. His mother was Katharina Bukowski.\n\nHis relationship with his father was heated, as he had a reputation for being an abusive man. Young Charles would often be at the wrong end of his father’s anger, beating him regularly. In Bukowski’s later writings, the impact of his father on his outlook is evident, becoming a recurring theme.\n\nThe family’s financial situation was often dire, and the Great Depression further forced them into poverty. Living in such conditions left a lasting dent in Bukowski’s psyche, fueling his future writings.\n\nEducation\n\nAlong with a hard life at home, his time at school would give him no respite, as the scarring from his adolescent acne was often mocked. No doubt, this bullying had a part to play in Bukowski’s life path.\n\nHowever, it was literature that he discovered at an early age, studying some of the greats. He would look to the likes of Dostoevsky and Hemingway for inspiration. He would go on to write fiction throughout his teenage years.\n\nBy starting at such a young age, he was able to express the sense of alienation and isolation that he felt within the world. By chronicling his everyday struggles and turning them into relatable pieces, his work would connect with his readers on a fundamental level. Much of his audience felt aligned with Bukowski’s worldview. In this sense, Bukowski’s early life was not just a formative period but the very foundation of his unique voice in American literature.\n\nLiterary Career\n\nCharles Bukowski’s literary career was a slow burn, filled with ups and downs, reflecting his turbulent life. After leaving school, his writing took a backseat, as he took on various low-paying jobs to make ends meet.\n\nIt was during this time that he would move away from Los Angeles and begin his education at Los Angeles City College. This occurred as America entered World War II. He then moved to New York City, where he began pursuing his writing career. He would later go on to live in other cities, such as Philadelphia and New Orleans.\n\nIn the 1940s, his writing career began to progress, as in 1944, he published his first short story, Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip. He would then go on to release 20 Tanks from Kasseldown in 1946. Despite the momentum building, he was met with rejection and failure, which led him to give up on his writing career for nearly a decade.\n\nDespite these early setbacks, Buskowski could not resist the urge to create. In the mid-1950s, Bukowski would make a return, developing his unique style, which would hone in on the day-to-day human experience. With the help of Jon and Louise Webb, publishers of the literary magazine The Outsider, he would regain his love for the art of writing.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, after a return to Los Angeles, Bukowski’s reputation grew rapidly, particularly within the underground literary scene. His first poetry collection, Flower, Fist, and Bestial Wail, was published in 1960.\n\nHe started to gain momentum, featuring in various small literary magazines. His portrayal of the human condition resonated with his audience. He would go on to publish all of Cold Dogs in the Courtyard, Crucifix in a Deathhand: New Poems, and Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live with Beasts in 1965.\n\nAfter persisting for decades, Bukowski would finally get his big break. The founder of Black Sparrow Press, John Martin, would end up offering a monthly salary to write full-time. This would mean Bukowksiu would have to give up his job at the post office. This was a proposal that was too good for him to turn down. In 1971, Bukowski took the leap, and his first novel, Post Office, was published, chronicling his years as a postal clerk. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nOnce he had a platform to build from, Bukowski would gradually turn into a prolific storyteller. He would write and publish poems, short stories, and novels. His 1972 poetry collection Mockingbird Wish Me Luck increased his fame, and his 1975 novel Factotum depicted his struggles with various menial jobs.\n\nThe subject matter of his semi-autobiographical series Women in 1978, which delves into his complex relationships with women over the course of his life, and Ham on Rye in 1982, which provided a brutal account of his childhood.\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nIt was in the later stages of his career that Bukowksi would finally find the success and stability that his work deserved. He would finally achieve fame and riches from his writing, which was a stark contrast to his early life of menial jobs. Despite this occupational upturn, his personal life was still turbulent.\n\nBukowski continued to live in Los Angeles, often drawing from his immediate surroundings and experiences for his literary work. He would remain humble despite his fame and live a simple lifestyle. Going to bars and drinking, along with writing, stayed central to his life.\n\nHe went on to marry his long-term girlfriend Linda Lee Beighle in 1985, whom he had met years earlier, and she became an essential part of his later life. They lived together in San Pedro, California, where Bukowski continued to write prolifically.\n\nIn 1987, the movie Barfly was released, a production in which Bukowski wrote the screenplay. The film gave a role to Mickey Rourke, who was the main star.\n\nAfter years of heavy drinking, health problems began to rear their head in Bukowski’s life. In 1988, he was diagnosed with leukemia, but he continued to write, even as his health deteriorated. His last novel, Pulp, was published in 1994, offering a surreal take on the detective genre.\n\nUnfortunately, on March 9, 1994, Charles Bukowski died of leukemia in a hospital in San Pedro, California. Bukowski’s gravesite in Green Hills Memorial Park bears the simple epitaph: “Don’t Try,” a phrase that encapsulates his philosophy of life.\n\nFamous Poems\n\nCharles Bukowski’s poems were integral to his literary reputation and was responsible for a wide array of critically acclaimed works. Here are some of his most famous poems:\n\n‘Bluebird‘\n\n‘Alone with Everybody‘\n\n‘Friendly advice to a lot of young men‘\n\n‘Like A Flower In The Rain‘\n\n‘Love & Fame & Death‘\n\n‘no help for that‘\n\n‘The Crunch‘\n\n‘The Laughing Heart‘\n\nInfluences\n\nCharles Bukowski’s poetry was heavily inspired by some of the poetic greats of the past. These included the likes of Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Ezra Pound. He would also look to literary figures such as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, and Henry Miller for inspiration."
