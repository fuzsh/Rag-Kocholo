Shamley\n\nPublished for the National Archives and Records Administration\n\nBy the National Archives Trust Fund Board\n\n1990\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface\n\nIntroduction\n\nProgram Descriptions\n\nAppendix A: Guests\n\nAppendix B: Co-Editors\n\nIndex of Topics\n\nPreface\n\nThe holdings of the National Archives include a wide variety of donated documentary materials that supplement official records of the U.S. government. Many of these donated materials are the products of broadcast journalism: newsreels, documentaries, and radio and television news programs. Among the latter materials is a collection of kinescopes of the television interview series, Chronoscope, which was broadcast on CBS-affiliated television stations from 1951 to 1955. This publication, \"Television Interviews, 1951-1955: A Catalog of Longines Chronoscope Interviews in the National Archives\", is a finding aid to the Chronoscope interviews in the custody of the Motion Picture, Sound, and Video Branch of the National Archives. The catalog includes a brief description of each program, identifying the participants and the major topics they discussed.\n\nGuests on Chronoscope were the newsmakers of the era: congressmen, diplomats, senators, statesmen, and national leaders in a variety of fields. The topics they discussed were those considered newsworthy in the 1950s, including: agriculture, atomic energy, communism, the economy, elections, foreign relations, Korea, labor, McCarthyism, nuclear weapons, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, taxation, and the United Nations. The index illustrates the full range of research or documentary possibilities. It is our hope that this publication will make a unique historical resource more accessible to the research and educational communities.\n\nIt is a primary goal of the National Archives' publication program to increase the visibility and accessibility of its archival holdings. Finding aids such as this one have been prepared at the National Archives since 1940 when the first general \"Guide to the Material in the National Archives\" was published. Over time, new editions of this general guide have been published, and supplementary guides have been prepared focusing on specific subsets of documentary materials. In this latter category are three of our most recent publications: \"A Guide to Pre-Federal Records in the National Archives\" (1989),\"The Holocaust, Israel, and the Jews: Motion Pictures in the National Archives\" (1989), and \"War and Conflict: Selected Images from the National Archives, 1795-1970\" (1990). A listing of in-print National Archives publications appears in General Information Leaflet 3, \"Select List of Publications of the National Archives and Records Administration\".\n\nWhile \"Television Interviews\" is intended to provide access to the Chronoscope interviews, it could well serve as a starting point for more extensive research in the records of newsworthy federal programs. We hope users of this guide will explore the rich visual heritage of our nation that is part of the National Archives.\n\nDON W. WILSON\n\nArchivist of the United States\n\nIntroduction\n\nLongines-Wittnauer, a company well known for its watches and clocks, donated to the National Archives motion picture kinescopes of its television interview series, \"Chronoscope,\" which was broadcast on CBS-affiliated television stations from 1951 to 1955. The National Archives accepted this offer because of the collection's historical significance and because of its research potential unlimited by restrictions on access, duplication, or use.\n\nAlthough the chief purpose of the National Archives is the preservation of the permanently valuable records of the United States government, donations of private papers or audiovisual materials closely related to federal government activities may also be accepted when they have sufficient historical value. Such gifts are placed in the National Archives Gift Collection, which contains extensive holdings of news programs, newsreels, documentaries, and radio news and public affairs broadcasts from organizations such as ABC News, Mutual Radio, CBS News, and National Public Radio. Recordings donated by these organizations provide audiovisual coverage of speeches, press conferences, interviews, and events that supplement the official documentation created by federal agencies that have not systematically made audiovisual recordings of their press appearances.\n\nThe donation of the \"Chronoscope\" series takes on considerable importance in view of the scarcity of television materials showing early news programs or public affairs coverage. In the era before videotape, many news programs were broadcast live and were never copied. Kinescopes or filmed recordings were rarely used to record news programs. Indeed, only the introduction of the 3/4-inch videocassette into the broadcast industry has made the systematic recording of news programs practical and cost-effective.\n\nCopyright protection still governs access to almost all early television news programs, a restriction unlikely to be changed even if the materials are donated to a public archives or library. Longines-Wittnauer, however, both the sponsor and copyright owner, has donated its rights in its programs, making them available for research and duplication for any purpose.\n\nLike the press interview programs \"Face the Nation\" or \"Meet the Press,\" \"Chronoscope\" featured people in the news who could speak with authority on the issues of the day or who were the center of the news themselves. Hubert H. Humphrey, J. William Fulbright, Robert A. Taft, John F. Kennedy, and many others, including Joseph R. McCarthy, discuss political and economic topics during their \"Chronoscope\" interviews. Dean Rusk, John Foster Dulles, Paul G. Hoffman, W. Averell Harriman, Clare Boothe Luce, and many other diplomats discuss American foreign policy, particularly with reference to the Korean war and U.S.-Soviet relations in the cold war. Many foreign leaders are also interviewed and share their perspectives on such issues as \"the two Chinas,\" world trade, communist insurgency, mutual defense treaties, the Arab-Israeli conflict, petroleum resources, and fishing rights. There is much discussion of domestic issues in the United States by important spokespersons including George Meany on labor, Ezra Taft Benson on national farm policies, Eleanor Roosevelt on the American image, Norman Thomas on civil liberties, and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., on civil rights. Among the other issues discussed are immigration, American culture and civilization, political campaign practices, civil defense, housing, national defense, juvenile delinquency, mental health, status of women, and illegal drug traffic. In short, the \"Chronoscope\" series is an audiovisual gallery of many of the principal personages of the early fifties.\n\nOriginating in New York, Chronoscope was telecast weekly on Mondays from 11:00 to 11:15 p.m. on the CBS network. From June 11, 1951, the date of the earliest surviving issue, the show was broadcast Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings through April 29, 1955, with one hiatus from June to August 1953.\n\n\"Chronoscope\" closely followed the format of other early television interview programs such as \"Meet the Press,\" \"Keep Posted\", and \"Face the Nation.\" The guest changed with each program. (Appendix A contains a guest list.) The programs, each 15 minutes in length, were produced and directed by Alan Cartoun under the aegis of CBS. Frank Knight was the host and announcer, and David Ross occasionally substituted. The host narrated the Longines-Wittnauer commercials that concluded each broadcast. Two interviewers called \"co-editors\" were present for each program. Appearing as coeditors most frequently were William Bradford Huie, publisher and editor of \"American Mercury\" magazine; Henry Hazlitt, a political economist, contributing editor of \"Newsweek,\" and publisher of \"Freeman\" magazine; and Larry Lesueur, a reporter for CBS News. The second interviewer changed each week throughout the series; many of the interviewers were journalists, editors, reporters, or television correspondents. (Appendix B contains a list of coeditors)\n\nThe show was telecast live, and kinescopes subsequently were sent to stations around the country for local broadcasts. The kinescope recordings were made on 16mm black-and-white film by a modified camera aimed at a picture tube while the live program was in progress. This accounts for the film's relatively flat, two-dimensional appearance. The programs were visually static, utilizing two or three cameras in a book-lined studio with the Longines emblem prominently displayed in the background.\n\nMore than 600 programs were broadcast, but the collection contains only 482 shows. Heat from a fire at a Longines-Wittnauer storage facility damaged some films before their transfer to the National Archives. Some programs were destroyed; others were not received with the donation.\n\nThe programs are listed in this publication by broadcast date. Names of the guests and interviewers for each program are given, and the main topics discussed are indicated. Only the extant programs are described.\n\nThe CBS program library in New York maintains a log of all programs telecast and related press releases. Beyond this documentation, neither CBS nor Longines-Wittnauer retains any records of \"Chronoscope\" or its production.\n\nReproductions of the programs listed are available for purchase in film, video, or audio formats. A current price list can be obtained by writing to the Motion Picture, Sound, and Video Branch (NNSM), National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC, 20408.\n\nWilliam T. Murphy wrote the introduction; Sarah Shamley, Valerie Meehan, and Leslie C. Waffen researched and described the programs in this list; and Maxine Piper prepared the index.\n\nProgram Descriptions (Arranged By Date)\n\n1951\n\nJUNE 11, 1951 Participants: Adm. William H. P.
