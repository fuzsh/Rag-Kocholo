        "text": "The reputation of a soldier-diplomat was made at Mudania as day was breaking on Wednesday morning, when the agreement that insured peace between Turkey and the Allies was signed by ISMET Pasha for the Kemalists and by General HARINGTON and General CHARPY for the British and French Governments. The man whose sagacity , alertness and patience had saved a critical situation was Lieut. Gen. Sir CHARLES HARINGTON. A single error of judgement in conference or a precipate order to his troops, and the soldier whom England expected to do his duty might have been the cause of a conflict with far-reaching and deplorable consequences.\n\nSeldom has a military commander called upon to display qualities of statesmanship had a more difficult task. Sir CHARLES HARINGTON was under instructions to avoid war, but to show firmness in negotiating with the Turkish nationalists, whose demands were likely to be high because their army had overwhelmed the Greeks and driven them out of Asia Minor. He had to preserve order in Constantinople, where the Turkish population was in a state of excitement and the Christians were panicky; he had to land troops, dig trenches, place guns and extend his barbed-wire entanglements at Chanak in face of the Turks, who threatened to hem in his position; he had to strengthen the Asiatic defenses of Constantinople; he must be in frequent consultation with the British naval authorities in the Straits and Sea of Marmora; with the French it was necessary to be tactful under trying conditions; he was at the call of his Government by telegraph at all hours of the day and night; and he was expected to negotiate an acceptable understanding with MUSTAFA KEMAL and his National Assembly at Angora while standing on guard as a soldier to defend the interests of Great Britain and save her prestige in Asia as well as in Europe. General HARINGTON'S ordeal really began a year ago, when the Greeks were restive in Thrace, impinged on the Neutral Zone there, and were tempted to march on Constantinople. There has scarcely been a moment since he took command of the British land forces in 1920 without its problems and anxieties. All through his troubles to the last he had authority to issue orders with the understanding that he must not blunder in letter or spirit. The Government at home was \"behind him\" but he had to walk warily.\n\nWith the last nerve-racking night at Mudania over and ISMET Pasha brought to terms, General HARINGTON was done with ultimatums, and could say: \"I believe peace is now assured. We got everything we asked, and our patience has been finally rewarded.\" Chanak had been made impregnable, a great British fleet was ready in Turkish waters, reinforcements had poured into Constantinople. Preparedness for the work had a good deal to do with the consummation, but the clear-headed and resolute HARINGTON rose to the occasion. He was the man for the emergency. A regimental officer when the World War began, he was a major general when it ended. As Chief of Staff of the Second British Army in France he is said to have made staff work \"a perfect science.\" At 50 he is famous, although three months ago people were asking, Who is HARINGTON?"
