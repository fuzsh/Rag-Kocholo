        "text": "In Flanders Fields Museum (Ypres), the Turkey Studies Network in the Low Countries (TSN) and Power in History: Centre for Political History (University of Antwerp) are jointly organizing a three-day interdisciplinary conference* on the experiences and aftermath of the First World War in the Middle East. We will discuss new perspectives on how this global war unfolded in the Ottoman lands and its borderlands, the cataclysmic consequences it engendered in the making of a new geopolitical order, and how its many legacies reverberate up to the present day. Invited speakers will present papers that provide new narratives on the course, meaning, and legacies of the First World War in the Ottoman lands and beyond. *This conference forms part of a broader programme that In Flanders Fields Museum is organizing on WWI and the Ottoman lands. It includes, among others, the temporary exhibition 'For\n\nMode of publication: Worldwide periodical, published annually every December Note to contributors: YILLIK: Annual of Istanbul Studies accepts submissions in English and Turkish. Articles should conform to the usage of The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS), 17th edition, and to the style guides published on the journal's website. Articles in Turkish conform to a customized CMOS style available at the website. Research articles are subject to review by two anonymous reviewers and the editorial board. All other submissions are reviewed by the editorial board.\n\nAbstract: The British Department of Antiquities (DOA) in Palestine intentionally constructed historical discontinuities to distance British rule from its Ottoman predecessor and tie it instead to earlier periods in the history of the land. To do this, however, the DOA had to unwittingly rely upon, and revalidate, political and cultural patterns laid by the Ottomans in the age of reforms. The article exposes this dynamic by delving into the written and visual record of the DOA in one of its first preservation projects in the \" Tower of Ramleh. \" The case of the tower as a multifaceted ruin shows that the \" post-Ottoman \" historical framing for the twentieth-century Middle East is not merely a matter of analytic investigation in hindsight, but a reality acknowledged and shaped by historical actors. It reveals thus far hidden agendas of the British rule in Palestine and enables the re-introduction of the history erased by it."
