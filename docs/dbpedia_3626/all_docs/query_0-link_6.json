        "text": "Introduction\n\nRecently I have featured two former Fenerbahçe footballers by the names of Alaattin Baydar and Zeki Rıza Sporel for my One Club Men Blog series.\n\nAlaattin Baydar (left)\n\nZeki Rıza Sporel (right)\n\nWhilst carrying out my research into both of these Turkish football legends, I came to learn about a one off game that took place in 1923 by the name of The General Harington Cup. I was intrigued by what I had found and wanted to learn more about this historic match – here is what I discovered which I hope you will enjoy reading.\n\nOverview\n\nThe General Harington Cup was a single game that took place on 28th June 1923 between the Turkish Club, Fenerbahçe and a team that was selected by General Charles Harington which was made up by a mixture of soldiers and professional footballers.\n\nGeneral Charles Harrington – Who was he?\n\nGeneral Sir Charles Harington Harington was born on 31st May 1872 in the Cathedral City of Chichester, England. During his 46 year military career, he was most known for his service during the First World War and the Chanak Crisis. As well as this he also served in the Second Boer War, held the position of Deputy Chief of the Imperial Staff for two years between 1918 to 1920, was in command of occupation forces in both the Black Sea and Turkey and was to later become the Governor of Gibraltar in the early 1930’s. The General retired from his duties in 1938 after serving for five years as Gibraltar’s Governor.\n\nHistory and Build up to the Game\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the First World War, the lands of the Ottoman Empire had been invaded by Italian, French, Greek and British forces. The British troops made their way into Istanbul on 13th November 1918 which is the date that was given for the official invasion. As the invasion progressed the British arranged football matches with a whole host of local clubs, one such club to take part in games was Fenerbahçe. The club played a total of 50 games during the occupation and ended with a great record of 41 wins, 4 draws and only suffering 5 defeats.\n\nDuring this period, Fenerbahçe were also actively transiting guns from their club building near Kurbağalıdere to Anatolia by the use of small boats to aid the effort against the occupying forces. Added to this, some of the clubs players were making their way to the frontline to combat the invaders then returning to Istanbul to participate in football matches and to move more guns and ammunition. Before too long the British forces found out what was going on at the club and duly raided the Fenerbahçe club building. However, club officials heard about the raid before it had begun and promptly transferred all guns and ammunition to various sites in the area. Following the raid the British troops were unable to locate anything but stayed on at the club building for several days to prevent any would be action.\n\nTo say that General Charles Harington was annoyed at the activities of his opponents would be an understatement. The Turkish resistance was fighting back against the invading troops and they were gradually pushing the invasion back. The invasion was now subsiding and the treaty of Lausanne (the treaty of Lausanne was a peace treaty that was negotiated and agreed during the Lausanne conference of 1922-1923, signed on 24th July 1923 it officially concluded the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the invading forces) was fast approaching, all of this meant that along with the other invading troops, the British were preparing to leave Istanbul.\n\nWith all of this at the forefront of his mind, General Harington wanted to depart Turkey with some kind of victory, albeit on the football pitch. Therefore he called forward the top players from the Irish Guards Grenadier Guards and the Coldstream Guards together with four professional footballers from the British Isles. As soon as the team was assembled it was given the name of Coldstream Guards. The General then issued the following broadcast in several newspapers:\n\n“Gardler Muhteliti Türk kulüplerine meydan okuyor. Galibine, Başkumandanın adını taşıyan büyük bir kupa verilecek bu maça Türk kulüpleri diledikleri gibi takviye de alabilirler.” (“Guards Joint is challenging the Turkish clubs. The Turkish clubs can gather any reinforcements to their clubs for this game whose winner will be awarded a trophy which will be named after the Head Commander.”)\n\nAfter reading this announcement Fenerbahçe penned a brief but to the point response which was also published in the newspapers:\n\n“Fenerbahçe Kulübü yalnız kendi kadrosuyla bu maçı şartsız olarak kabul eder.” (“Fenerbahçe Club accepts this proposal with only its own squad, unconditionally.”)\n\nThe General accepted the challenge from Fenerbahçe and the match arrangements were finalised.\n\nThe Match\n\nThe date of the game was agreed to take place on 29th June 1923 at the Taksim Stadium in Istanbul. The Taksim Stadium was the first ever football stadium in Istanbul and had a seating capacity of 8,000. The stadium was originally the home of all of the major football clubs in Istanbul – Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş. The stadium closed in 1939 and the following year it was demolished which coincided with the formation of Taksim Square.\n\nThe Taksim Stadium in 1923.\n\nThe match itself was a closely fought encounter. The opening goal came in the 30th minute and went to the Coldstream Guards with the scorer being the future Chelsea outside left – Willie Fergus on, to the delight of General Harington and Lord Herbert Plummer, the then governor of Gibraltar.\n\nThe score was still 1-0 in favour of the Guards as the referee blew his whistle for half time. The second period however saw Fenerbahçe taking control of the match and through two goals scored by their goal machine Zeki Rıza Sporel they won the game by 2 goals to 1. The captain of Fenerbahçe, Hasan Sporel lifted the one metre high General Harington Cup which still takes pride of place in the club’s museum nearly one hundred years later.\n\nIt is also worth noting that during the same year, Fenerbahçe won the Istanbul Cup Championship without losing a game, scoring 53 goals and amazingly conceding 0!!!\n\nRemembered Today\n\nThe victory secured by Fenerbahçe on that June day in 1923 is still talked about today in Turkey. It is seen as an important point of how one football club fought off occupation and guided and helped an entire country too independence. The players that played in the historic game and who will always be remembered for their efforts are listed as follows.\n\nŞekip Kulaksızoğlu\n\nHasan Kamil Sporel (below)\n\nAli Cafer Çağatay\n\nKadri Göktulga\n\nFahir Yeniçay\n\nİsmet Uluğ (below)\n\nSabih Arca\n\nAlaattin Baydar\n\nZeki Rıza Sporel\n\nÖmer Tanyeri\n\nBedri Gürsoy (below)\n\nMustafa Elkatipzade – Head Coach\n\nThe Team\n\nFor the final part of this piece I want to share with you some information on several of the players that played for Fenerbahçe and who were victorious in the historic General Harington Cup. Of course, I have already spoken about Alaattin Baydar and Zeki Rıza Sporel in my two previous One Club Men episodes, these can be found by entering the search term – one club men or by using the players names. Lets now take a look at some of the other players from that great Fenerbahçe team.\n\nHasan Kamil Sporel\n\nBorn in 1894, Hasan Kamil Sporel was the elder brother of Zeki Rıza Sporel and just like his younger sibling he spent his entire career with Fenerbahçe. The defender made his debut for his club in 1911 and went onto to be the first ever captain of the Turkish National Team. Another record that he holds is that he was the first player to score for Fenerbahçe in their derby game with fierce rivals Galatasaray. After retiring from football he left his homeland to live in the USA to pursue graduate studies.\n\nAli Cafer Çağatay\n\nCafer was born in Kadıköy in 1899 and as well as playing for Fenerbahçe he also played for İstanbul Altınordu İdman Yurdu (no longer in existence) and the Turkish National Team. The left back first played for Fenerbahçe in the 1915/1916 season before moving onto play for İstanbul Altınordu İdman Yurdu. He rejoined Fenerbahçe in 1922 and remained with the club until 1927. Cafer is also known for being the son of the Turkish Composer, Ali Rıfat Çağatay who’s most notable work was arranging the musical composition for the original Turkish National Anthem used from 1924 – 1930.\n\nİsmet Uluğ\n\nİsmet Uluğ was born in 1901 and as well as being a top player for Fenerbahçe and later in his career Galatasaray, he was also a very accomplished boxer. A midfielder or a winger, he played for Fenerbahçe from 1919 to 1928 and also captained the club for a period of time. Long after his retirement he became the president of Fenerbahçe in the 1960’s.\n\nBedri Gürsoy\n\nBedri Gürsoy was born in Kadıköy in 1902 and played for Fenerbahçe as a left forward between 1921 – 1928. He is considered to be one of the greatest left forwards in Turkish football history. In total he played 134 games for the club and scored 34 goals. After he had retired from playing the beautiful game he worked for the club and served as a member of the board.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are now at the end of my blog looking back at the General Harington Cup match from 1923. From my research I have come to the conclusion that this encounter was so much more than a normal football match and much rather a time of national pride and honour.\n\nI hope that those of you who have been kind enough to read this piece have enjoyed the content and have been able to learn about this historic game of football – I know that I certainly have!\n\nIf you have any comments or feedback then please leave a comment in the relevant section of my blog or feel free to contact me via twitter @Gareth19801."
