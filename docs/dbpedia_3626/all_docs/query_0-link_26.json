I can add but little to what he has written. But I deem it a privilege to be allowed in this Foreword to commend the record of a noble life and to give my own testimony to the inspiring example of a friend for whom, in common with all who knew him, I had a very real admiration and affection.\n\nOur friendship began at York when he was appointed to the Northern Command. I well remember how on the outbreak of the War he strained at the leash which bound him to his duty at home, and how eager he was when the summons came to him to go to the front—attired in sudden brightness like a man inspired. When for some weeks in the summer of 1917 I visited all the British Armies in France and Flanders, I was his guest at Cassel. It was shortly after the battle of Messines—perhaps the most complete single victory in the long struggle. I felt at once the atmosphere of trust and of devotion to himself which he had created around his Staff. They seemed, indeed, one proud and happy family, of which he was in his quiet and decisive way the centre. In many talks with his men, in hospital or trench, I realized that in the Second Army the ordinary soldiers not only knew who their Army Commander was, but had a personal feeling of loyalty towards him. They knew that his one thought was for his men. When I accompanied him over the battlefield, the relationship between him and them was evident in his words of simple unaffected greeting and in the smile of response which even the correctness of attention could not conceal. When he spoke about the battle with thankfulness and pride it was always of his Staff, of his officers and men, never of himself that he spoke.\n\nWhen the War was over, and he had reached an age when most men would have been glad to retire and rest, he was eager for further service. In the field of administration in Malta and Palestine he showed the same qualities which had distinguished him on the field of battle—the qualities of the man,\n\n\"Who comprehends his trust and to the same\n\nKeeps faithful with a singleness of aim.\"\n\nHe was just and accessible to all, always ready to listen and never afraid to decide, helped by his own directness of mind and sense of humour to see things in their right proportion, imperturbable in temper, yet inflexible in will. Few men surely have ever achieved so much with so little regard for popularity or publicity, with such simplicity of manner and mind and heart.\n\nOn the deeper sources of this quiet strength it is needless to dwell. All who knew him at all knew that his religion was the abiding basis of his life, that he was a man who walked humbly with his God. He went about his work, whatever it was, with quiet confidence as one who had commended it to God in prayer. I remember standing at his side on the spot whence he had looked out anxiously on the Messines Ridge at the hour of zero—3.10 a.m.—on the morning of the battle. I did not know what Sir Charles Harington here records that immediately thereafter he was kneeling by his bedside praying for those gallant officers and men who were at that moment attacking. That is a picture well worth remembering. His life-long service for his King and Country was inspired and guided by a constant remembrance of the higher service which he owed as a loyal soldier and servant of Christ.\n\nThis book will be of special interest to his fellow soldiers who will feel that\n\n\"This is he\n\nThat every man in arms should wish to be,\"\n\nand to the large company of his friends. But I trust that it will reach a far wider circle of readers. For in a straightforward way, perhaps the more impressive because there is no trace of mere literary artifice, it portrays the life of a great soldier, a great Englishman, and a true-hearted Christian.\n\nCOSMO CANTUAR.\n\nPREFACE\n\nI AM greatly honoured at having been invited by Lady Plumer to write the memoir of her late husband. I may say at once, that I have no literary qualifications for such a task and I would ask my readers to remember throughout that I have only attempted to present a picture of a great, straightforward, God-loving soldier, in the hope that his every action through life may be a help to the younger generation.\n\nI was privileged to serve under him as Major-General, General Staff, of the Second Army for a considerable period of the Great War in the defence of the Ypres Salient, and in that position I learned the secret of his method of command which I have tried to present in simple language.\n\nHe kept no diary and but few records. Fortunately his wife had kept his letters for many years and from these it has, I think, been possible to trace the earnest and loyal devotion to duty throughout all his service which in his last years was to make him an Army Commander, beloved and trusted by all who were privileged to serve under him. After the War he might well have been entitled to rest, but he had no idea of resting whilst he could do service for his King and Country. He did five years as Governor of Malta during difficult times and proved himself such an able administrator that he was offered the post of Governor-General of Australia. He was forced to decline this as he could not afford it, but he became High Commissioner in Palestine shortly afterwards.\n\nHis splendid work in that capacity is dealt with elsewhere.\n\nIn 1930, he became President of the M.C.C., a position which he thoroughly enjoyed. During his year of office he endeared himself to all at Lord’s and proved himself to be a most able President.\n\nDuring the years since the War he took an active part in the organization of Toc H, the Ypres League, the British Church at Ypres, the British School at Ypres, the Soldiers’ Daughters’ House at Hampstead, the Village Centres at Enham, etc., etc.\n\nHe had a firm conviction that it was the bounden duty of everyone to work for his country as long as he was physically able to do so.\n\nIn this memoir I have tried to show that what he accomplished in life is possible to all soldiers. His career was founded on being a good regimental soldier. In that capacity he learnt the feelings of a soldier which he never forgot. Later he became Adjutant and passed through the Staff College and proved himself a good Staff Officer. He never pretended to be a man with what may be termed a brilliant brain, or a genius in any way. He just went through life doing everything thoroughly. Every action of his was based on sound common sense. He gained the confidence of those above, around and under him, looking a long way ahead and making sound and firm decisions.\n\nHe was never known to utter an unkind word against anyone nor would he allow anyone else to do so.\n\nHe was a very strict disciplinarian with an intense sense of loyalty. He had his set-backs in life, but he was such a true sportsman that he knew well how to take knocks and accept decisions in the right spirit.\n\nThe story of how he left the Army Council is told in these pages for the first time. It was a bitter blow to him.\n\nThat he accepted that decision and never breathed a word, never complained, never asked for anything in life, showed again his true character and did much to endear him to the Army as a whole.\n\nHe had a great sense of humour, he always had a cheery word for everyone, he was at his best when things were really bad, he was always thinking of others and never of himself and he hated every form of advertisement.\n\nThose of us who were privileged to serve under him know well what we owe to him. In the chapters dealing with the Great War, it will be shown how he moulded us into a team. He expected nothing but the best from each one of us. As long as he was sure that we had given of our best he was always ready to forgive our faults and we knew it.\n\nI am greatly indebted to the hundreds of kind people ranging from field-marshals to transport drivers and private soldiers who have sent me stories by which, owing to some words or action, they will ever remember their old Chief. I only wish that space permitted me to publish more of them. I am sure that it has been given to few men to be able to say some kind or cheery word which has sunk in to such a depth, that the recipient has never forgotten the man who said it. He certainly possessed that gift.\n\nThe story of Passchendaele from the point of view of the Second Army is told in Chapter VIII. I have presented the problem exactly as it appeared to Lord Plumer at the time and I have given an account of the way in which he dealt with it. One must remember that he, unlike many post-war critics, did not know what was the other side of the hill, although our information turned out subsequently to have been amazingly correct. It has been anticipated in certain quarters that I should take this opportunity directly to refute certain charges that have been made against the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Haig, with regard to the Passchendaele operations. I have purposely not done so. That will no doubt be done by the able pen of Lord Haig’s biographer. I am only concerned with relating the actions and views of Lord Plumer as I knew them, from my close association, and in correcting any misrepresentations which have been made.\n\nMy one purpose has been to present the life of a great and very lovable soldier in the hope that his example may be of use to others and especially to the younger generation.\n\nI am sure that all my readers will agree that he played a great innings and always with a straight bat and a modest mind. He was a devout Churchman. His religion meant a very great deal to him as to other great Commanders. He was always able to go to bed every night and thank God that he had been enabled to do something during the day to help others and had never said an unkind word about anyone else, and this, I always think, is a good example for others to follow. That was his secret of success. He made nothing but friends and no enemies. The compiling of this book has, therefore, been nothing but a labour of love.\n\nIt does not, I hope, contain one unkind word of either the living or the dead. That would have been his wish and is certainly the wish of Lady Plumer.\n\nI think one can safely say that he gained not only the trust and affection of all ranks of the British Army who served under him but also that of the troops of our great Dominions, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. They were all very fond of him and I have some wonderful letters testifying to this.\n\nOne of the objects of this memoir is to bring out the attributes in his character which contributed chiefly to his success. The few words on the Eton Memorial, written by the Provost, seem to sum them up—\n\nThroughout his life, in peace and in war, he was distinguished and beloved.\n\nHe inspired love in all with whom he came in contact. It is hoped that the story of his life may serve as a help and inspiration to the coming generation in whom he took such a true interest.\n\nIt will be shown how, by his policy of Be fair he gained in later years the trust and confidence of the Maltese and subsequently of the Arabs and Jews in Palestine. All parties and denominations were the same to him. He recognized the points of view of all of them and his one purpose was to be fair and just to all. His send-off both from Malta and Palestine leaves no doubt upon this point.\n\nThe strain of his work in Palestine told on him, coming as it did after many years of very hard and continuous work and anxiety. He really worked himself out physically, but his brain remained active to the end.\n\nIt has, I am sure, been given to few men in our history to have given more faithful and devoted service to his King and Country than the man whom I was privileged to call my Chief.\n\nC. H. HARINGTON.\n\nCHAPTER I—EARLY DAYS. REGIMENTAL LIFE\n\nTHE family of Plumer all came from Yorkshire.\n\nThe first authentic record is of one Thomas of Bedale who married Dorothy Bidihell of Bedale in 1638. They had a son William who, in his turn, had a son called Thomas who married in December, 1716, as his second wife, Alice, youngest child of Francis Hall of Lilling, Co. Yorks., by Mary, daughter of Thomas Romeby. They had a son, Thomas of Lilling Hall who had, with other issue, Sir Thomas, Kt., Master of the Rolls, who was born on 10th October, 1753, and married 26th August, 1794, Marianne, daughter of John Turton, and died 25th March, 1824, leaving with other issue, Thomas Hall Plumer of Canons, Co. Middlesex, who married in May, 1822, Anne Headland, and died December, 1852.\n\nHis second son, Hall Plumer of Malpas Lodge, Torquay, born 15th September, 1827, married on 18th May, 1854, Louise Alice Hudson, daughter of Henry Turnley of Kensington, and died 14th June, 1888, leaving by her, with other children, Herbert Charles Onslow Plumer, born 13th March, 1857.\n\nHe was born in London in Sussex Place and was sent to a preparatory school at Brighton, Mr. King’s, in Upper Brunswick Place, where he stayed until he went to Eton in 1870. He was at Mr. Mitchell’s House (always known as Mike’s).\n\nThroughout his life, his love for his old school never faltered. After the battle of Messines, amongst the many telegrams of congratulations which he received, the one he prized most was from one of his contemporaries (Streatfield) at his old House—Well played Mikes.\n\nThis cannot be better illustrated than by quoting from a letter received by his wife after his death:\n\nHe and I were at Mike’s together and there we all loved him and in after-years watched his splendid career and were so proud of him. I shall never forget when he was in the Chair at our Old Boys’ Dinner soon after the War. At the end of his speech as Chairman he stated that of all the letters and telegrams he received congratulating him on his victory at Messines, the one that pleased him most ran thus ‘Well played Mike’s.’ He was such a loyal Etonian and never forgot his old School and House throughout his strenuous life.\n\nHe left Eton in 1876, when he was in the Sixth Form.\n\nHe was gazetted to the 65th Foot (York and Lancaster Regiment) in the autumn of 1876 and went out to join the battalion at Lucknow in the spring of 1877. His letters of those days are typical of the young officer joining a Regiment. Everything new and fresh. He soon entered into the life.\n\nHe writes later:\n\n\"The great game in the Regiment is Polo.\n\nEverybody goes in for it. I expect I shall be a great muff at it.\"\n\nHe soon got very keen and played for the first team.\n\nIn the autumn of 1877 the Regiment moved to Dinapore.\n\nFrom there he attended a Garrison Course of eight months at Ambala and obtained a First Class, passing second out of all the candidates and being specially mentioned in four subjects out of five. He was then just over twenty-two and became Adjutant in the spring of 1879.\n\nThe Regiment left Dinapore for Morar in the autumn of 1880 and moved to Aden in July, 1882.\n\nHe talks in his letters of living in a perpetual duststorm. How well I can picture it as I joined my Regiment at Aden nearly ten years later.\n\nHe got six weeks’ leave to England in the summer of 1883 and became engaged to his second cousin, Annie Constance. Her father, George Goss, was Hall Plumer’s first cousin.\n\nAmong the letters of congratulation which he received on his engagement was one from his great friend, Major Wolseley (afterwards General Sir George Wolseley), who had been very good to him all the time he had been in the 65th. After abusing him for getting married so young he ended up: I will forgive the future Mrs. Plumer if she makes you go through the Staff College.\n\nOn 17th November, 1883, he describes the visit of H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught to Aden and his appreciation of the Guard of Honour furnished by the Regiment.\n\nFor weeks they had been expecting to leave Aden and on 24th February the Regiment embarked on H.M.S. Serapis. On Saturday the 26th he writes:\n\n\"We are now again in a state of excitement. When we left Aden we thought we were coming straight home, but just before lunch we were stopped by the Carysfort and told to follow her to Trinkitat, we do not know if we are to disembark.\"\n\nLater:\n\nJust a line to say we have orders to disembark.\n\nOn 2nd March he writes from the camp at Tokar:\n\n\"Just a line in pencil to let you know I am all right. We have had a very rough time since we left the ship and a pretty hot fight the day before yesterday, February 29th. I was not touched. The Regiment suffered 7 killed and 32 wounded. Littledale was wounded but I hope is doing well. He behaved splendidly.\n\n\"I have not attempted to tell you about the fight at El Teb. It was, as you know, my first experience. I could not give you any description of it because I was rushing about all the time. It seemed to be about half-an-hour, but I believe it really lasted about four hours or more. We marched back from Tokar on Tuesday, and did the whole march to Trinkitat that day, some 16 or 17 miles, and the last part we walked with bare feet through a swamp. We stayed at Trinkitat all Wednesday and then came on to Suakin in the Carysfort.\n\nBefore we left Trinkitat our Brigadier paraded us and made us a most flattering speech. General Graham too rode up to us and said all sorts of nice things.\n\nOn the 15th March he writes:\n\nWe had an awful battle on Thursday. I hope I may never see a scene like that again. We lost poor, dear old Ford. His body was horribly marked about when we got it, but I trust he was shot dead. Dalgety was badly wounded and I am afraid will lose his arm. We were very lucky not to have lost more officers, but we lost a lot of men, 32 killed and 22 wounded. Some of our best men. One longed to see active service, but I have seen enough to last me some time.\n\nOn board ship on his way to England he writes on the 7th April: I have just seen General Graham’s dispatch after the battle of El Teb. He speaks very flatteringly of the Regiment.\n\nThe Regiment disembarked at Portsmouth on the 21st April and was quartered at Dover in the Citadel barracks. He was mentioned in dispatches and given medal with clasp, 4th Class Medjidie and Khedive’s Star.\n\nOn 22nd July, 1884, he was married by special licence at St. Andrew’s Church, Wells Street.\n\nIn April, 1885, the Regiment left Dover for Sheffield. He came up in May for the Staff College examination, but broke his compasses and came back very depressed as he was quite sure he had not got through. Therefore the following letter which he received in August from Colonel O’Grady Haly (a brother officer in the Regiment who had a Staff appointment in London), was a great relief.\n\nI have this moment learned and hasten to let you know with great pleasure that you have qualified in the obligatory subjects at the Staff College examination.\n\nAfter a few months in Sheffield they took a small house in Camberley, just opposite the gates of the Staff College. Two very happy years followed.\n\nThe Commandant-General, Clive, and his charming wife made all around them happy and contented. Amongst the instructors were Colonel Rothwell, Colonel Maurice and Colonel Richards.\n\nMany were the lifelong friendships made during those happy two years. The Drag in winter and cricket in summer. There was never a match missed in the latter, and just before the first year’s examination—which in those days was decisive as, if a man did not pass satisfactorily, he was not allowed to complete the two years—he was offered various mounts and had about four days’ hunting before the examination.\n\nThe Commandant, meeting his wife, remarked with a twinkle in his eye: Well at any rate you have sent him fit to the post.\n\nAfter the two years at Camberley they spent four months at Aldershot.\n\nIn August, 1888, he rejoined the 65th at York where they had a very happy time, living in a small house in Heslington Lane. In August, 1889, the Regiment was sent to Cork and he was sent on detachment to Tullamore. In the following January he was told he had been selected for the appointment of D.A.A.G. in Jersey, to date from the 7th May, 1890, for three years.\n\nGeneral C. B. Ewart was there then as Governor.\n\nThe kindness and consideration that he and Mrs. Ewart always showed to him and his, began a lifelong friendship.\n\nThe life in Jersey was very pleasant. A nice little house with a charming garden, and a great many agreeable people. The Drag in winter and lots of cricket in the summer made the days pass by very quickly.\n\nOn the 31st October, 1892, General, Mrs. and Miss Ewart left and the following day the new Governor-General Markham and Mrs. Markham arrived.\n\nHe was indeed fortunate in the two Generals under whom he served in his first Staff appointment. No better comment can be made on the relations which existed between him and his General than the offer made by the General (afterwards Sir Edwin Markham), of the Government Secretaryship of Jersey which was in his gift. Tempting as this offer was to a poor man with four children, it was declined because he felt he was too young to take a billet with so little to do.\n\nBoth his"
