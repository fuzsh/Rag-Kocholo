        "text": "Forty-five years spent as an officer in\n\nthe British Army have provided ample\n\nmaterial for Sir Charles Harington\n\nbook of reminiscences. Although he occupied\n\nseveral important military posts,\n\nhe only once occupied a conspicuous\n\nplace in the world's news. This was\n\nin 1922. when as commander-in-chief\n\nof the Allied forces in Turkey, he succeeded\n\nin staving off war over the Chanak\n\ncrisis by a narrow margin of 75 minutes.\n\nWriting from his retirement, Sir\n\nCharles reviews the incident at length,\n\nand claims, not without justification, that\n\nBritain is gathering the fruits of his\n\npolicy to-day in Turkey's friendship. He\n\ntells a dramatic story of how, with\n\nthree orders In his pocket from the\n\nCabinet to open hostilities, he succeeded\n\nin coming to terms with the Turks. He\n\nreveals that Lloyd George and a section\n\nof the Cabinet were determined on war.\n\nWhen the news of the settlement he had\n\narranged reached London, only the Inter-\n\nvention of Lord Curzon prevented puni-\n\ntive action against him. Lloyd George's\n\npersonal displeasure cost Sir Charles the\n\nrank of field-marshal.\n\nOne feature of Sir Charles Harding-\n\nton's military life that will surprise the\n\nlay reader is his intense preoccupation\n\nwith games. To him cricket was almost\n\na religion, and cricket runs through\n\nhis book from cover to cover. In the\n\nstory of his life as a regimental officer\n\nit is difficult to see how he found time\n\nto allow his military duties Co interfere\n\nwith cricket and other games. On at\n\nleast one occasion he relates that he received\n\na broad hint from above to the\n\neffect that the Army also had some right\n\nto his attention.\n\nBut Sir Charles is not alone. Almost\n\nall of the officers he mentions suffered\n\nfrom the same obsession for sport and\n\ngames. One incident he relates justifies\n\nthe Continental impression that the\n\nBritish, as a race, are mad. At one\n\nEton v. Harrow match at Lord's Sir\n\nCharles saw the then Secretary' of State\n\nfor War Lord Hailsham, looking for a\n\nseat. Sir Charles drew Lord Hailsham\n\nattention to Mr. Baldwin, who was sitting\n\nin the second row. The only answer\n\nhe got away, \"I don't care where Mr. Baldwin\n\nis sitting. I don't speak to him on\n\nthis occasion.\" The Prime Minister and\n\nthe War Minister did not wear the same\n\nschool tie!\n\nOn another occasion Field-Marshal\n\nLord Plumer became, to use an appropriate\n\nschoolboy term, quite \"shirty\"\n\nwhen Sir Charles expressed the hope that\n\nHarrow would win. He snapped. \"I don't:\n\nI hope they are beaten by on innings at\n\nlunch time on the first day. For his\n\nown part Sir Charles Harington seems to\n\ninfer that his term as president of the\n\nM.C.C. was the highest honour he received\n\nin his life, and the apex of his career.\n\nAlthough he was much in the thick\n\nof things and was behind the scenes\n\nwith those in high authority. Sir Charles's\n\naccount of the Great War years is a\n\nmeagre and lacking in dramatic Interest, i\n\nHere and there the curtain is drawn back\n\nan inch or two. One day Sir Henry,\n\nWilson burst in on Sir Charles demand-\n\ning to know if there was a man named\n\nRolls or a man named Royce in England.\n\n\"The\" procured someone connected\n\nwith the mystic: names. The upshot was\n\nthat Sir Henry ordered, straight off, 1,000\n\nRolls-Royce cars for immediate delivery,\n\nto be used as armoured cars in Mesopo-\n\ntamia blessed word. Sir Charles con-\n\ntinues:-\"So we got the cars, but they\n\nwere to cost. I think, £2,000 each, with\n\nanother £1,000 for strengthening them\n\nfor service, so there was a sequel when\n\nSir Charles Harris, the financial head,\n\nheard of the deal that afternoon, but he\n\ntook is very well.\"\n\nNo wonder Sir Charles remarks that,\n\nwe dealt with some big problems in\n\nthose days when money was forthcoming.\"\n\nA £3 000,000 deal In motor-cars made in\n\nhalf an hour testifies to the truth of the\n\nstatement."
