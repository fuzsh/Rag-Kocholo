In the following, we inform you about the handling of your personal data when using our website. Personal data is all data with which you can be personally identified.\n\n1.2 The controller in charge for data processing on this website within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is Volker Bertelmann, Hauschka, Ronsdorfer Straße 75, 40233 Düsseldorf, Deutschland, Tel.: 0211 / 76063645, E-Mail: info@hauschka-net.de.

You can recognize an encrypted connection by the character string https:// and the lock symbol in your browser line.\n\n2) Data Collection When You Visit Our Website\n\nWhen using our website for information only, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise provide us with information, we only collect data that your browser transmits to our server (so-called “server log files”). When you visit our website, we collect the following data that is technically necessary for us to display the website to you:\n\nOur visited website\n\nDate and time at the moment of access\n\nAmount of data sent in bytes\n\nSource/reference from which you came to the page\n\nBrowser used\n\nOperating system used\n\nIP address used (if applicable: in anonymized form)\n\nData processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. The data will not be passed on or used in any other way. However, we reserve the right to check the server log files subsequently, if there are any concrete indications of illegal use.\n\n3) Cookies\n\nIn order to make your visit to our website attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, we use so-called cookies on various pages. These are small text files that are stored on your end device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after closing your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your terminal and enable us or our partner companies (third-party cookies) to recognize your browser on your next visit (persistent cookies). If cookies are set, they collect and process specific user information such as browser and location data as well as IP address values according to individual requirements. Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending on the cookie.\n\nIf personal data are also processed by individual cookies set by us, the processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR either for the execution of the contract or in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR to safeguard our legitimate interests in the best possible functionality of the website and a customer-friendly and effective design of the page visit.\n\nWe work together with advertising partners who help us to make our website more interesting for you. For this purpose, cookies from partner companies are also stored on your hard drive when you visit our website (third-party cookies). You will be informed individually and separately about the use of such cookies and the scope of the information collected in each case within the following sections.\n\nPlease note that you can set your browser in such a way that you are informed about the setting of cookies and you can decide individually about their acceptance or exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally. Each browser differs in the way it manages the cookie settings. This is described in the help menu of each browser, which explains how you can change your cookie settings. You will find these for the respective browsers under the following links:\n\nInternet Explorer: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies\n\nFirefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/websites/#cookies\n\nGoogle: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en\n\nSafari: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac\n\nOpera: https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies\n\nPlease note that the functionality of our website may be limited if cookies are not accepted.\n\n4) Contacting\n\nIn the context of contacting us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail), personal data is collected. Which data is collected in the case of a contact form can be seen from the respective contact form. This data is stored and used exclusively for the purpose of responding to your request or for establishing contact and for the associated technical administration. The legal basis for processing data is our legitimate interest in responding to your request in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR. If your contact is aimed at concluding a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR. Your data will be deleted after final processing of your enquiry; this is the case if it can be inferred from the circumstances that the facts in question have been finally clarified, provided that there are no legal storage obligations to the contrary.\n\n5) Use of Single Sign-on Procedures\n\nOn our website, you can create a customer account and/or register using the social plug-in, “Facebook Connect”, provided by the Facebook social network operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”), by means of so-called single sign-on technology, provided you have a Facebook profile. The “Facebook Connect” social plug-in on our website is identified by a blue button featuring the Facebook logo and the words, “Connect with Facebook” or “Log in with Facebook” or “Sign in with Facebook”.\n\nWhen you visit a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server. The content of the plug-in is transferred from Facebook directly to your browser and included on the page. As a result of this inclusion, Facebook is informed that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook profile or are not currently logged into Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted from your browser directly to a Facebook server in the US, where it is stored. These data processing processes are carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR based on Facebook’s legitimate interest in the insertion of personalized advertising on the basis of surfing behavior.\n\nUsing this “Facebook Connect” button on our website allows you to log in and/or register on our website using your Facebook user data. Only if you give your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point a GDPR prior to the registration process on the basis of a corresponding notice about the exchange of data with Facebook, we will receive the publicly accessible information stored in your profile when using the “Facebook Connect” button from Facebook, depending on your personal Facebook privacy settings. This information includes your user ID, name, profile picture, age and gender. We would like to point out that following changes to Facebook’s privacy and usage policies, your profile pictures, your friends’ user IDs and your friends list may also be transmitted, if these are marked as “public” in your Facebook privacy settings. The data transmitted by Facebook is stored and processed by us to create a user account using the necessary data (title, first name, surname, address details, country, e-mail address, date of birth), if you have shared this information on Facebook. Conversely, data may be transmitted by us to your Facebook profile; this may include information about your browsing and/or purchasing behavior.\n\nThe consent given can be revoked at any time by sending a message to the controller named at the beginning of this declaration.\n\nThe purpose and scope of the data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights and setting options for protecting your privacy in this regard, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php\n\nIf you do not wish Facebook to assign the data collected via our website directly to your Facebook profile, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. You can also completely prevent the loading of Facebook plug-ins using add-ons for your browser, e.g. “Adblock Plus” (https://adblockplus.org/en/).\n\n6) Use of Your Data for Direct Advertising\n\n6.1 If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will send you regular information about our offers. The only mandatory information for sending the newsletter is your e-mail address. The indication of additional possible data is voluntary and is used to be able to address you personally. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending the newsletter. This means that we will not send you an e-mail newsletter, unless you have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending of the newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive future newsletters by clicking on an appropriate link.\n\nBy activating the confirmation link, you give us your consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point a GDPR. When you register for the newsletter, we store your IP address entered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as the date and time of registration so that we can trace any possible misuse of your e-mail address at a later time. The data collected by us when registering for the newsletter will be used exclusively for the purpose of advertising by means of the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time via the link provided in the newsletter or by sending a message to the responsible person named above. After your cancellation, your e-mail address will immediately be deleted from our newsletter distribution list, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data in excess thereof, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration.\n\n6.2 Our e-mail newsletters are sent via the technical service provider, The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (https://mailchimp.com), to whom we pass on the data you provided when registering for the newsletter. This disclosure is made in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR and serves our legitimate interest in the use of an effective, secure and user-friendly newsletter system. Please note that your data is usually transferred to a MailChimp server in the USA and stored there.\n\nMailChimp uses this information to send and statistically evaluate the newsletter on our behalf. For evaluation purposes, the e-mails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which represent single-pixel image files stored on our website. This allows us to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). The data are raised exclusively in a pseudonymized format and are not linked with other personal data from you. A direct personal relationship is excluded. This data is used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.\n\nIf you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter.\n\nFurthermore, MailChimp can use this data according to Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR even on the basis of its own legitimate interest in the demand-oriented design and optimization of the service as well as for market research purposes, for example to determine from which countries recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address those recipients or pass that data on to third parties.\n\nTo protect your data in the USA, we have concluded a data processing agreement (“Data-Processing-Agreement”) with MailChimp on the basis of the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission to enable the transmission of your personal data to MailChimp. If interested, this data processing agreement can be viewed at the following Internet link: https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/\n\nMailChimp’s privacy policy can be viewed at: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/\n\n7) Use of Videos\n\nUse of Youtube Videos\n\nThis website uses the YouTube embedding function for display and playback of videos offered by the provider YouTube, which belongs to Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 ESW5, Ireland (“Google”).\n\nTo this end, the extended data protection mode is used to ensure, according to provider information, that user information will only be stored once the playback function of the video is started. When the playback of embedded YouTube videos is started, the provider sets “YouTube” cookies in order to collect information about user behavior. According to indications from YouTube, the use of those cookies is intended, among other things, to record video statistics, to improve user-friendliness and to avoid improper actions. If you are logged in to Google, your information will be directly associated with your account when you click on a video. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. Google saves your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. Such an evaluation takes place in particular according to Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR, on the basis of the legitimate interests of Google in the insertion of personalized advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact YouTube to exercise this right. When using YouTube, personal data may also be transmitted to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA.\n\nRegardless of whether the embedded video is played back, a connection to the Google network “double click” is established when visiting this website. This may trigger further data processing beyond our control.\n\nFurther information on YouTube data protection can be found in the provider’s data protection statement at: www.google.com/policies/privacy/\n\nTo the extent required by law, we have obtained your consent to the processing of your data as described in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point a GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. In order to exercise your right of withdrawal, please follow the procedure described above.\n\n8) Rights of the Data Subject\n\n8.1 The applicable data protection law grants you comprehensive rights of data subjects (rights of information and intervention) vis-à-vis the data controller with regard to the processing of your personal data, about which we inform you below :\n\nRight of access by the data subject pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR\n\nRight to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR\n\nRight to erase (“right to be forgotten”) pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR\n\nRight to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR\n\nRight to be informed pursuant to Art. 19 GDPR\n\nRight to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR\n\nRight to withdraw a given consent pursuant to Art. 7 (3) GDPR\n\nRight to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR\n\n8.2 RIGHT TO OBJECT\n\nIF, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSIDERATION OF INTERESTS, WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA ON THE BASIS OF OUR PREDOMINANT LEGITIMATE INTEREST, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THIS PROCESSING WITH EFFECT FOR THE FUTURE ON THE GROUNDS THAT ARISE FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION.\n\nIF YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO OBJECT, WE WILL STOP PROCESSING THE DATA CONCERNED.
