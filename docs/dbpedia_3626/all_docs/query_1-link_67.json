I am grateful to the staff of the London Library for locating and allowing me to keep for months books and periodicals I needed to consult and quote. I thank Ahmet Yüksel, the celebrated antiquarian bookseller, whose new premises in Ankara serve as a meeting place for historians in the Turkish capital. Once again I benefited from his rare ability to find out-of-print books. My friends in Turkey, with whom I discussed this book, have helped me with their suggestions and broadened my perspective. Finally, I apologise once again to Mary, who has put up with yet another postponement of my long-overdue retirement and the loss of a summer holiday.\n\nNote on Spelling and Pronunciation The names and spelling of people and places mentioned in this volume have undergone many changes over time. I have, on the whole, chosen the form currently used and, as such, recognisable to English-speakers today (who fly to Istanbul and not Constantinople, and spend their holidays in Kuşadası and not in the Italianate Scala Nova, and in Antalya and not Adalia). However, historical perspective requires reference to older names and spellings. For places, I have usually given the current name first, followed by the name used by contemporaries of the events described, and, in some cases, the official name in more than one language, e.g. Istanbul/Constantinople, İzmir/Smyrna, İskenderun/Alexandretta, and Meriç/Maritza/Evros for the river which forms the boundary between Greece and Turkey, which is called Meriç in Turkish, Evros in Greek and Maritza in Bulgarian and in Western documents at the time of the settlement after the First World War. However, where a place name occurs frequently, rather than repeat the current Turkish name and the old European form every time, I have sometimes opted for the one or the other, depending on context. Mustafa Kemal did not change the names of the principal cities when he established the Turkish Republic. Istanbul, İzmir, Ankara, Antalya etc. had long been the names by which these places were known to the Turks. What changed after 1923 was the insistence of the Turkish authorities that these forms should also be used by foreigners in their official dealings with Turkey. As a result, European ambassadors who were earlier accredited to the Sultan’s government in Constantinople were succeeded by consuls in Istanbul after 1923. Where names of Turks occur, I give the modern spelling of the given names by which they were known at the time, followed in brackets by the person’s surname which came into use when surnames became compulsory in 1934, e.g. Rauf (Orbay), Fethi (Okyar), İsmet (İnönü) etc. For the main hero of the book I have used Mustafa Kemal before 1934, and Atatürk thereafter. Modern Turkish uses the Latin alphabet and is spelled phonetically. Consonants have roughly the same values as in English, except that: C is pronounced as j in joy Ç stands for ch in chair Ğ is silent, but lengthens the preceding vowel H is never silent, and is pronounced as in he J is pronounced as in French jour Ş stands for sh as in shell Y is always a consonant as in yellow Vowels have ‘continental’ values (similar to those in German). Ö and Ü are pronounced as in German (or as eu and u) in French. The undotted I (I, ı) represents a sound which does not occur in Western European languages, but does in most Slav languages where it is usually represented by a y. The nearest English equivalent would be the phantom vowel in the second syllable of ‘rhythm’ (spelled in Turkish as ritım). I have followed modern Turkish spelling in\n\ndotting the capital İ as in İsmet, İzmir, etc., except for Istanbul, where a dotted capital İ looks pedantic. Most vowels are of uniform length. Where a vowel is long (usually in a word of Arabic or Persian origin) a circumflex (^) is sometimes used to indicate it. Where the vowel ‘a’ follows the consonants ‘k’ or ‘l’, the circumflex shows that the consonant is palatalised (softened), as in Talât (pronounced Taliat). One difficulty remains: there is no uniformity in the modern Turkish spelling of names of Arabic origin. I have used etymological spelling for the final consonant e.g. Reşad (not Reşat), but phonetic spelling in the middle of the name, e.g. Vahdettin (and not Vahdeddin or Vahiduddin, Wahid al-Din or any number of other variants, all of which look peculiar in Turkish today).\n\nI Sèvres\n\n1\n\nIllusions of Power The First World War destroyed the comfortable certainties of the ruling class throughout Europe. Like the aristocrats who had survived the French Revolution, the rulers of Europe were left with only nostalgic memories of the douceur de vivre of the old order. The mass slaughter on the Eastern and the Western Fronts gave the lie to widely-held illusions. Belief in the inexorable progress of civilisation died on European battlefields where the most advanced nations of the world fought each other with the most inhuman weapons and methods they could devise. Barbarians could have done no worse. But other illusions survived. One such was that not all empires were doomed, that while outmoded dynastic empires, like those of the Habsburgs, Romanovs and Ottomans, fell apart, the progressive empires of Britain and France, which had a democratic core, had emerged strengthened by the defeat of their rivals. When the war ended, Britain, France, Italy and the United States – known as the Principal Allies – thought they could dispose as they wished of the fates and possessions of their enemies. This illusion of omnipotence was disproved first in Russia, then in Turkey and finally and catastrophically in Germany. The emergence of the Bolshevik empire with its centre in Russia, of the Turkish national state and then of the truly evil empire of the Nazis in Germany marked the failure of Allied policies. They had hoped that the First World War would be the war to end all wars, and that it would make the world safe for democracy. These hopes were quickly disappointed. The post-war settlement was short-lived, except in one case. The emergence of a fully independent, stable Turkish national state within the community of civilised nations was a fortunate, if unintended, consequence of the policies of the victors of the War, which we can now see for what it was – a brutal civil war within the Western World. The Ottoman state entered the fray in 1914 in a reckless gamble by a group of adventurers, led by a triumvirate consisting of two young career officers, Enver and Cemal, and one civilian, Talât. Enver, the leading spirit, was 33 years old in 1914, Cemal was 42 and Talât 40. Enver became Commander-in-Chief (formally Deputy Commander-in-Chief, since the Sultan was nominal C-in-C), Cemal Navy Minister, Commander of the Southern Front and Governor of Syria (which included Lebanon and Palestine), and Talât Minister of the Interior and then Grand Vizier (Prime Minister). These leaders of the Young Turks, as they were known in the West, had risen to power and fame in Ottoman Macedonia in the first decade of the 20th century. Their character had been moulded by their experience in fighting the irregular bands of Balkan nationalists – Slav Macedonians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Serbs and, finally, Albanians. Nationalist irregulars were known in Turkish as komitacı (committee-men), a designation which became a byword for ruthlessness, violence and treachery, but also reckless courage. Such men were needed to carve nationally homogeneous states out of a multinational empire – a process which involved massacres, deportations and the flight of millions of refugees. Enver, Cemal and Talât were Turkish komitacıs in a literal sense too, as leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), whose members were known as Unionists (İttihatçı). They were initiated in quasi-Masonic ceremonies in which oaths were sworn on guns and holy books.\n\nThey conspired against the absolutist regime of Sultan Abdülhamid II, forced him to reintroduce constitutional rule in 1908, deposed him in 1909 and seized power in a coup in 1913. They believed initially that constitutional rule would reconcile all the ethnic communities of the Ottoman Empire and turn them all into loyal Ottoman citizens under the banner of freedom, fraternity and justice. It was their version of the ideals of the French Revolution, which they admired as the Great Revolution. But they admired Napoleon even more and also the German and Japanese militarists whose example confirmed their belief that might was right. THE CUP TRIUMVIRS Enver (1881–1922) became a leading member of the Committee of Union and Progress in Salonica, where he was serving as a staff major with the Ottoman Third Army, and won renown as the best-known of the military mutineers who secured the reintroduction of the constitution in 1908. He played a leading role in the suppression of the counter-revolution in Istanbul the following year and, after raising local resistance to the Italians in Cyrenaica, was the main author of the coup which brought the CUP to power in 1913. He married the Sultan’s niece in 1914, and became War Minister, Chief of the General Staff and (Deputy) Commander-in-Chief after pushing the Ottoman Empire into the First World War on the side of Germany later that year. Enver was seen as the leading pro-German triumvir, so much so that the Germans referred jokingly to Turkey as ‘Enverland’. He fled to Germany in 1918, and after a vain attempt to take over the Turkish resistance movement in Anatolia, moved to Central Asia where he was killed by the Red Army. Cemal (1872–1922) was the triumvir to whom Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) was closest. A member of the CUP central committee in Salonica, he restored order in Adana after a bloody anti-Armenian pogrom in 1909, served as Governor of Baghdad, and became Military Governor of Istanbul after the CUP seizure of power in 1913. He was Navy Minister and at the same time Military Governor of Syria and overall Commander of the Southern Front during the First World War. He fled the country in 1918 and was murdered by an Armenian terrorist in Tbilisi (Georgia) in 1922. Talât (1874–1921) was a lowly post office clerk when he joined the CUP, rising to a leading position within the movement in Salonica. He became Interior Minister in 1913, and was the main author of the deportation of Armenians from Anatolia in 1915. He rose to the top post of Grand Vizier (Prime Minister) in 1917. Along with the other two triumvirs, he escaped in a German warship in 1918, and was assassinated by an Armenian militant in Berlin in 1922.\n\nConstitutional rule did unite the nationalists of the Ottoman state – but it united them against the Turks. Sultan Abdülhamid II had preserved his dominions for 30 years by dividing his internal and external enemies. The advent to power of the Young Turks in 1908 prompted the neighbours of the Ottoman state to attack it both singly and jointly. First, nominal Ottoman suzerainty was repudiated in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Crete; then, in 1911, Italy invaded Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (known today as Libya), the Ottomans’ last directly administered territory in Africa; and finally, in 1912, the small Balkan states – Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece – joined forces to end Ottoman rule in Macedonia. The Young Turks scored their only success in 1913 when the Balkan allies fell out among themselves, allowing Enver to reclaim Edirne (Adrianople) and with it eastern Thrace up to the River Meriç (Maritza/Evros) as the last Ottoman foothold in Europe. In the West, the Ottoman Empire had long been known as Turkey. In 1914 the Sublime State (its official name in Turkish) had in fact become Turkey-and-Arabia, and even in its remaining territories its hold was uncertain. That year, it had been forced to promise special rule for the six so-called Armenian provinces in eastern Anatolia, where in fact the Armenians were outnumbered by Turks, Kurds and other Muslims. In the Arab provinces there were stirrings,\n\nfeeble but ominous, of indigenous nationalism, while Turkish troops had to be stationed in the remote (and useless) province of Yemen to keep its feudal ruler under control. The Turkish domestic opponents of the CUP had every right to describe its leaders as bunglers who had promised to safeguard the Ottoman state, but in fact hastened its disintegration. Like unlucky gambling addicts, Enver and his companions pinned their hopes on a new throw of the dice. Apologists for the Unionist triumvirate have advanced various justifications for their decision to join the Central Powers – Germany and Austria-Hungary. Cemal, they said, had been cold-shouldered when he sought an alliance with France. Britain, they argued, incurred the hostility of the Turks by seizing without compensation two battleships which were being built in British yards with the voluntary subscriptions of Ottoman subjects. But that was in August 1914 when the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, had solid grounds for believing that the CUP leadership had decided to side with Germany. The fact is that the leaders of the CUP wanted to win back some of their losses in the Balkan Wars, and in particular the Greek islands lying off the Turkish coast in the Aegean, that they sought compensation at the expense of Russia in the east for losses they could not retrieve in the west, and that they believed that the Ottoman state had to ally itself with one or the other of the two blocs in order to survive. The CUP leaders had wide-ranging military ambitions, but they lacked the resources to finance them. Germany promised the necessary cash, weapons and technical expertise. Throughout most of the 19th century the Ottoman state could rely on Britain to keep the Russians out of the Turkish Straits and the imperial capital, Constantinople/Istanbul. But in 1908 in order to counter the threat of German domination of Europe, Britain recruited Russia in support of its entente cordiale with France.1 On the eve of the war in 1914, a plan backed by Russia to appoint a Christian or European governor for an ‘Armenian province’ was blocked by Germany, thanks to whose mediation the governor became, less objectionably, an inspector-general. By entering the war on the side of Germany, the Young Turks got rid of the inspector-general.2 But Turkey could have achieved the same result, if not more, by playing off Germany against the Triple Entente without committing itself to either side. Instead, it concluded an alliance with Germany under the cloak of neutrality and then launched an attack on the Russian fleet in the Black Sea without a preliminary declaration of war, setting a precedent for Pearl Harbor. The Ottoman cabinet was not even informed of this act of aggression which was staged by the Unionist triumvirate. The Ottoman state thus became the eastern wing of the German-Austro-Hungarian alliance. Its communications with Germany were made safe when Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in order to make good its losses in the Second Balkan War, and when Serbia (whose nationalists had ignited the fuse of the conflict) was overrun at the end of 1915. But while the railway line from Berlin to Istanbul was adequate, communications between the Ottoman capital and its eastern and southern fronts relied on the unfinished single-track Baghdad railway built by the Germans. As the tunnels through the Taurus mountains were not completed until the end of the war, men and supplies had to cross the range on foot and on pack animals. The line ended at the northern edge of the desert between Syria and Mesopotamia, a long way from the Russian front. In the south too there were big gaps in the railway network between Aleppo and the Egyptian frontier, where the Ottomans faced British imperial forces.\n\nThere was little industry in the Ottoman state, which could just about manufacture uniforms for its troops, and simple small arms. In the 19th century, the Ottomans had entered the world economy as exporters of handicrafts, such as carpets, and of cash crops, mainly tobacco and dried fruit. Even in peacetime, Istanbul relied on imported Russian grain, sugar and tea. In wartime, as the country’s largely rural economy was disrupted by conscription and military operations, malnutrition was widespread and starvation a constant danger. According to official statistics, the total population of the state was 18.5 million, of whom 15 million were Muslims – Turks, Arabs, Kurds and others. British sources put the total higher – at 21.5 million for the Asian provinces alone. In the census, people were classified by religion and not by ethnic origin or mother tongue. However, an analysis of provincial statistics suggests that the number of Arabic-speakers was probably around six million, and of Kurds two to three million. Nomadic tribal Kurds and Arab Bedouin eked out a meagre subsistence by breeding sheep, goats and camels, and by extorting protection money from the state, from travellers and from settled populations generally. But even in the relatively advanced provinces, some 90 per cent of the Muslims were illiterate. Tuberculosis, malaria, and trachoma (an eye disease which causes blindness) were endemic. Average life expectancy was 30 years. In wartime malnutrition, typhus and typhoid took a heavy toll.\n\nHowever, the backwardness of the Asian provinces, which made up the bulk of the state, could be easily forgotten in the cosmopolitan centres – the capital, Constantinople/Istanbul, and the port cities of Smyrna/İzmir on the Aegean and of Trebizond/Trabzon on the Black Sea. In the capital, non-Muslims made up 40 per cent of a population of approximately one million, and dominated trade and the professions. In Smyrna, nicknamed ‘infidel İzmir’ by the Turks, there were more Christians than Muslims.3 Istanbul and İzmir were European cities, with good schools, theatres, electric trams and gas lighting. Istanbul was a world in itself, where magnificent monuments from the city’s past – mosques, palaces, but also rich mansions – fostered illusions of grandeur. These illusions were not confined to Turks and other Muslims. The Greeks who made up the second largest community in Istanbul, and were present in large numbers along the coasts of the Aegean and the Black Sea, had seen their numbers, prosperity and economic power rise throughout the 19th century. The more ambitious among them dreamt of replacing the Turks as rulers of a revived Byzantine Empire. Armenian nationalists disregarded the numerical weakness of their community, which numbered one and a half to two million,4 and set their hopes on restoring the mediaeval Armenian kingdom in eastern and southern Turkey. Of course not all the Greeks and Armenians were nationalists, but the Ottoman state could not rely on the loyalty even of those in the Christian communities who had prospered under its rule. Nevertheless the Ottoman state punched well above its weight. This was partly due to the hardihood and courage of Turkish conscripts. ‘The Turkish peasant will hide under his mother’s skirts to avoid conscription, but once in uniform he will fight like a lion,’ a Russian expert on Turkey wrote during the war.5 But there was another reason to which most Western observers were blind and which historians have come to notice only recently. While the rural masses were illiterate and ignorant of the modern world, there was an elite of experienced and well-trained Turkish civil servants and army officers. Although the reforms of the 19th century (known as the Tanzimat, meaning ‘the (re)ordering’) were routinely decried in the West as inadequate and a sham, by the beginning of the 20th century Ottoman administration compared well with that of other contemporary empires – so much so that many of its former subjects came to regret its eventual dissolution. A recent study suggests that in the Arab lands placed under British and French Mandates at the end of the First World War, there was little improvement for indigenous Muslims in such basic areas as average life expectancy, education, communications and public order.6 Ottoman civil administration was organised on French lines, while in the army French and British advisers were largely replaced by Germans from the reign of Abdülhamid II onwards. The efficiency of Ottoman governors and commanders was often overlooked by Western critics who decried their rule as backward and corrupt. Foreign observers also overlooked the fact that many of the Greeks, particularly along the Aegean coast, were immigrants from the newly-independent Greek kingdom who found life under Ottoman rule more rewarding than in their own country. Enver and his associates were poor diplomats and bad judges Mehmed V Reşad of the national interest. But after the disaster of the Balkan Wars (1844–1918) acceded they reorganised the army and turned it into an efficient fighting to the Ottoman force, if only to waste it in ill-planned operations. A symbolic\n\nexplosion marked the declaration of war: a monument erected by the Russians in the Istanbul suburb of San Stefano (today’s Yeşilköy, the site of the modern Atatürk airport) where the Tsarist empire had imposed a peace treaty on the defeated Ottomans in 1878, was blown up and its destruction filmed for Turkey’s first newsreel. As Caliph of the Muslims worldwide, the Sultan – the elderly Mehmed V who did as he was told by the CUP – proclaimed the jihad – a holy war against the Allies. There were doubts that fighting as junior partner of two Christian empires against three other Christian empires could count as a jihad. In any case, Muslims took little notice of the proclamation – Indian Muslims continued to fight in the ranks of the British army, Algerian and Senegalese Muslims in the French army, while the Tsar’s ‘wild cavalry’ depended as ever on Muslim horsemen. As for Arab Bedouins, they kept to their tradition of serving the most generous paymaster – and the British easily outbid the Ottomans. In the winter of 1914/15, Enver led an Ottoman army to destruction in the snows of the mountains of eastern Anatolia on the Caucasian front, which stretched far from the nearest Ottoman railhead, but lay conveniently close to the Russian broad-gauge rail network. In the south, Cemal pushed to the Suez Canal, which some of his units managed to cross, but the Egyptians failed to rise against their British overlords who drove the Turks back into Palestine. Unsuccessful in their attacks, the Turkish army then scored two notable victories in defensive battles. It beat back the British-Anzac and French attempt to break through the Gallipoli peninsula to Istanbul in 1915, and checked a British advance from Basra to Baghdad the following year, surrounding a British force and forcing it to surrender at Kut al-Amara. It was the high point of the Ottoman war effort, which had an effect on Allied perceptions. The British army came to respect ‘Johnny Turk’ as a good fighter, but Allied governments and diplomats vowed revenge: the Turks’ successful defence of Gallipoli and their dogged resistance in Mesopotamia (today’s Iraq) and Palestine had prolonged the war and vastly increased its cost in casualties and resources. Allied statesmen, whose miscalculations had been exposed, became determined to eliminate once and for all the danger which, they believed, the Turks posed to their empires. This difference in perceptions between soldiers and civilians was to play an important part in post-war developments, which showed that the soldiers had the more realistic view of Turkey’s strength. The bloody battles in Gallipoli, in which each side lost a quarter of a million men killed and wounded, laid the foundations of the career of a young Turkish officer with political ambitions. Staff Colonel Mustafa Kemal was 34 years old at the time and had with some difficulty secured the command of a Turkish division held in reserve on the peninsula when the British and Anzacs landed on 25 April 1915. Born in Salonica in 1881, he had taken an active part in military plots aimed at forcing Sultan Abdülhamid II to reintroduce the Ottoman constitution of throne in 1909, when his elder brother Abdülhamid II was deposed by the Young Turks. A pious and mild man, who sympathised with the Sufi Whirling Dervishes, he was the country’s first constitutional Sultan. Throughout most of his reign this meant that he did the Young Turks’ bidding. His only reported criticism of the Young Turk war leader Enver Pasha was a remark after a meal. ‘The Pasha drinks water when he eats leeks. It is unheard of.’\n\n1876. When the First World War broke out, he was known as an independent-minded Unionist and a critic of Enver and of the subservience of the Ottoman army to the Germans. Nevertheless his initiative and personal courage which helped contain the first Allied landings, impressed Field Marshal Liman von Sanders,7 the German commander of the Ottoman troops at Gallipoli, and when the British made a second landing on the peninsula at Souvla Bay, Kemal was appointed commander of the forces which held the line against them. Later legend has it that Kemal’s rising star was noticed immediately by friend and foe alike. In fact the British did not distinguish him from other Ottoman commanders, and Enver denied him publicity in Turkey. But he won appreciation where it mattered – among other Turkish commanders. Mustafa Kemal resisted German interference in Turkish military dispositions and left Gallipoli in a huff before the Allied withdrawal in December 1915. Promoted Brigadier – the highest rank he was to achieve during the War – he was given the command of an army corps which was being laboriously transferred to the Eastern Front in order to halt the Russian advance. He arrived in an area devastated by the fighting and by the deportation of the Armenians who had dominated it economically. Armenian nationalist revolutionaries had originally joined the Young Turks in the ranks of the opposition to Abdülhamid II. But after the reintroduction of the constitution in 1908 their ways parted. While the Young Turks’ ideal was equality in a centralised state, the demands of Armenian, as of other Christian nationalists, ranged from the recognition of special rights through autonomy to outright independence for their community. Unlike Ottoman Greeks and Bulgarians, Ottoman Armenians had no existing national state which they could join. But when the Russians conquered the Caucasus, and particularly after the Russian gains at the expense of the Ottomans in 1878, the number of Armenian subjects of the Tsar increased, as Armenians long resident in the Caucasus were joined by immigrants from Turkey, who found greater scope for their energies under Christian Russian rule. According to Armenian sources, in 1912 there were some 1.3 million Armenians in ‘Russian Armenia’ (the Caucasian provinces) against one million in ‘Turkish Armenia’.8 True, there were tensions between the Armenians and their Tsarist rulers who favoured their own version of Eastern Orthodox Christianity over the Armenian (Monophysite) Gregorian Church, and who fitfully pursued a policy of Russifying their subjects. Even so, as Christians, the Armenians had more in common with the Russians than with Muslim Turks, and although by the end of the 19th century they did well in both the Ottoman and the Tsarist empires, the latter was more advanced and opportunities in it accordingly more promising. The decision of the Young Turks to throw in their lot with the Germans against the Russians was a tragedy for the Armenians who found themselves divided between the two combatants. The majority kept their heads down. But for nationalist Armenian revolutionaries who had used terrorism first against their own kinsmen to gain control over them, then against the Ottoman state and occasionally against Tsarist officials they disliked, the Ottomans’ calamity was the Armenians’ opportunity. Disaster threatened to overwhelm the Ottoman state in 1915 when the Western Allies landed in Gallipoli and the Russians advanced deep into eastern Turkey. Armenian revolutionaries had been preparing for that day. They had infiltrated fighters and stockpiled arms in eastern Turkey; they had formed volunteer units to help the Russian army. As the Russians advanced, Armenian nationalist revolutionaries organised uprisings and acts of sabotage behind the Ottoman lines.9\n\nThis compromised the Armenian community as a whole. In April 1915, the Young Turk leadership – and Talât in particular – became convinced that the removal of all Armenians from the war zone and from the vicinity of the railways leading to it was a military necessity. It would also remove once and for all the threat of losing yet another portion of the Turkish homeland to local Christians who, as experience showed, would, if successful, get rid of their Muslim neighbours by fair means or foul. For centuries Muslims and Christian Armenians had lived in reasonable amity side by side to their mutual benefit. Now fear and hatred gripped both communities, many of whose members became convinced that they were faced with a stark choice: kill or be killed. Large-scale deportations have not been rare in history. The Ottomans had transferred their unruly kinsmen, the Turcoman tribesmen, from Asia to their new conquests in the Balkans; they had also moved Christian Armenians and others to repopulate Istanbul after the conquest. They had received Jews and Arabs deported from Spain after the reconquista, and then from the 18th century onwards, hundreds of thousands of Muslims forced out of the Balkans, southern Russia and the Caucasus.10 In the 19th century, more than a million Circassians were expelled by the Russians from the Caucasus. Hundreds of thousands of them perished before they could start a new life in the Ottoman Empire. Many of the survivors were resettled in eastern Anatolia, which Armenian nationalists were claiming for themselves. The Circassians were a martial people: some of the refugees preyed on settled Ottoman subjects, others found employment in the Ottoman army and gendarmerie. In 1915, as the Russians threatened them again in their new homes, discipline could not restrain the Circassian gendarmes. In some instances, instead of protecting Armenians during the deportation, they killed them. In any case, the best-trained gendarmes had been sent to the front and their duties in the Ottoman countryside had been taken over by raw recruits, including released convicts. There were instances where gendarmes escorting columns of deported Armenians sold them to Kurdish tribesmen who robbed, and then killed the Armenians and raped their women. Undisciplined gendarmes, Kurdish tribesmen and bandits of all sorts, whose numbers had been swollen by deserters, took a heavy toll of the deportees. Others died of malnutrition and disease, which affected even larger numbers of Muslims, for as Armenian civilians were driven south to Syria, at least as many Muslim civilians – Kurds and Turks alike – were fleeing west from the advancing Russians and their Armenian auxiliaries. In absolute numbers more Muslims than Armenians perished in Anatolia, but while Armenian deaths from all causes accounted for more than a third of their community, the Muslims lost one-fifth, and remained in possession of the land. Moreover, the sufferings of the Armenians were well documented. There were American missionaries and consuls in the area, as the United States was not at war with the Ottoman Empire; German officers and civilians also witnessed atrocities. But the sufferings of the Muslim population passed largely unnoticed by Western observers. Brigadier Mustafa Kemal was successful in the initial phase of the operation planned by Enver to attack the invading Russians from the north and the south. In the 1916 campaigning season Kemal’s troops recaptured two towns – Muş and Bitlis – south of Lake Van on the east Anatolian plateau. But Enver’s pincer operation failed, and the Russians retook Muş. As\n\nwinter set in, the Russian front stabilised, and Mustafa Kemal was given a command on the Syrian front against the British under the German commander Erich von Falkenhayn, who had been Chief of the General Staff when the German army launched its costly, unsuccessful assault on the French at Verdun. Kemal quickly decided that von Falkenhayn was serving German and not Ottoman interests. Once again he resigned his command and returned to Istanbul. He was then sent off out of harm’s way in the suite of the Ottoman heir apparent Mehmed Vahdettin who had been invited to visit the Germans’ western front in France. By then Russia was out of the war. Soon after the first Russian Revolution in February 1917, the Tsarist army disintegrated. On the Caucasian front, territory seized by the Russians, who had made some attempts to prevent inter-communal killings, was taken over by Armenian militias. The militias avenged themselves on local Muslims for the fate of their kinsmen deported two years previously. Then, after the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917, the Soviet government sued for peace and was forced to accept the loss of the western portion of the Tsarist empire (from Finland through Poland to the Ukraine), and, subject to a referendum, territory the Russians had gained from the Ottomans in 1878. The collapse of Russia, a full year before the collapse of Germany in November 1918, tempted Enver into another adventure. Ottoman troops had earlier been despatched to Galicia (now divided between Poland and Ukraine) to reinforce the Austro-Hungarians against the Russians. Just as the front held by the Ottomans against the British in Palestine and Mesopotamia was about to crumble, Enver withdrew more troops from it and ordered them to move into the Caucasus beyond the 1878 Russian frontier. He overrode the objections of the Germans who had their own plans for a puppet government in Georgia and for control of the oilfields in Baku (held precariously by a British force after the Russian collapse). As he pursued his dream of a Turkic empire stretching all the way to central Asia and eyed territories about which he was woefully ill-informed, Enver weakened the defence of the Turkish core of the empire – Anatolia and eastern Thrace. The elderly, weak-willed Sultan Mehmed V (Mehmed Reşad) died in July 1918. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the 57-year-old Vahdettin, who took the title of Mehmed VI. Mustafa Kemal had made a favourable impression on him earlier that year during their tour of the Western Front. They were both critical of the Unionist leadership and their conduct of the war. Vahdettin thought he could use Kemal, while Kemal banked on the favour of his new sovereign for his own designs. While Vahdettin was vacillating, suspicious, ill-informed, woolly-minded and fearful for the safety of his throne, Kemal was clear-headed and realistic. This allowed him to turn the relationship to his advantage. It was also Kemal who had the clearer grasp of the Ottomans’ military weakness, which he witnessed in August 1918 when he accepted a command on the Syrian front, this time under his old commander Liman von Sanders. A year earlier, when he had refused to serve under von Falkenhayn, Kemal had urged on the Ottoman high command in Istanbul the urgent need to withdraw troops from Galicia, renounce Enver’s Caucasian adventure, and concentrate all available forces for the defence of Anatolia. By the time Kemal returned to Syria, a month after Vahdettin’s accession to the throne, the position of the Ottoman forces had become desperate. Jerusalem had been lost to General Allenby’s British Imperial forces the previous December, and a weakened Ottoman\n\narmy was trying to hold a line in northern Palestine, with headquarters in Nazareth. The British broke through in September, a month after Kemal’s arrival on the front. Thereafter his main concern was to escape capture and to save as many of his troops as he could for the defence of Anatolia. By the autumn of 1918, out of the total of 2.85 million men conscripted in the Ottoman Empire during the war, only 560,000 still bore arms, and of these only a quarter were available for combat. Some of the best troops – eight well-equipped divisions at full strength – had been despatched to the Caucasus and northern Persia, where they could not affect the course of the war. Half a million deserters roamed the interior of Anatolia.11 As the military situation worsened, talk of a separate peace began to be heard in Istanbul. President Woodrow Wilson’s peace proposals seemed to offer a way out. In a speech to Congress in January 1918 Wilson had formulated the principles which, he believed, should inspire peacemaking. He set them out in the Fourteen Points, of which the Twelfth declared: ‘The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.’ This was not a bad bargaining offer to the embattled Ottomans. Moreover, the rhetoric of President Wilson and of the Young Turks coincided in one important respect: Disregarding the fact that they were fighting to save an empire, the Young Turks had posed as the champions of the peoples of the East against the imperialists. Wilson seemed to echo them. Although by then the United States was fighting on the side of the British and French empires, Wilson proclaimed loftily: ‘In regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right, we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the imperialists.’12 No wonder that as they tried to avert the impending catastrophe, many Ottoman patriots saw a lifeline in Wilson’s principles. Moreover, Wilson’s Twelfth Point echoed the statement made a few days earlier by the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. The Allies, he said, were not fighting ‘to deprive Turkey of its capital, or of the rich and renowned lands of Asia Minor and Thrace, which are predominantly Turkish by race’.13 PRESIDENT WILSON’S FOURTEEN POINTS, 8 JANUARY 1918 The program of the world’s peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, as we see it, is this: I. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view. II. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants. III. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.\n\nIV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety. V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined. VI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy. VII. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired. VIII. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all. IX. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality. X. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous development. XI. Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into. XII. The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees. XIII. An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant. XIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.\n\nIn a first response in February 1918, the Ottoman foreign minister agreed that the diverse nationalities in the empire should be granted their own institutions.14 In spite of reverses in the field and weakening morale, the Ottomans still wielded considerable bargaining power at the time. But the Unionist leadership was unable to make up its mind on how to end the disastrous war into which they had led the country. Enver still believed in a German victory and kept Talât Pasha’s cabinet in the dark about the worsening situation on the front. Even the defeat of\n\nthe last German offensive on the Western Front in July 1918 did not shake the government out of its indecision. The opportunity to make peace on favourable terms was lost. On 15 September, the Bulgarian army crumbled before the ‘If the Greeks crack assault of the Allied forces in Macedonia. Four days later we may expect to eat General Allenby scattered the Turkish troops holding the front in dirt to an unlimited northern Palestine. Talât Pasha had earlier gone to Berlin to extent and this is not discuss a united response of the Central Powers to Wilson’s a form of diet which peace terms. Unable to agree among themselves, the Central has ever agreed with Powers sued for peace separately. The first to collapse was me.’ Bulgaria. Passing through the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, on his way HORACE back home, Talât Pasha witnessed the disintegration of the army RUMBOLD which had guarded the western approaches to Istanbul. The game was up. Talât acknowledged this with characteristic bluntness, saying ‘We have eaten shit!’15 Four years later, Sir Horace Rumbold, British High Commissioner in the Ottoman capital, was to use the same image, in a slightly more polite form. ‘If the Greeks crack,’ he wrote, ‘we may expect to eat dirt to an unlimited extent and this is not a form of diet that has ever agreed with me, though Pellé [the French High Commissioner] and Garroni [his Italian counterpart] may flourish on it.’16 But no one, and least of all Lloyd George, expected such a reversal of fortune when the Allies emerged triumphant from the First World War. Talât’s cabinet finally resigned on 13 October. On the same day Enver sent a last message to all Ottoman forces urging them to prevent the loss of any more Turkish territory before the conclusion of an armistice.17 The CUP was finally out of office. But it still held the majority of seats in parliament, which could once again exercise its powers under the constitution. The CUP also controlled the security forces in the capital and dominated the provinces through its local organisations. In opposition, in power and then again in opposition, the CUP represented modernity. Nationalism was the dominant ideology in the world, and Wilson’s advocacy of the self-determination of nations confirmed its legitimacy. In the crumbling Ottoman state, it was the CUP which championed Muslim nationalism as it melded into Turkish nationalism. There were few men of experience in politics, the administration or the army who had not collaborated with the Unionists in the ranks of the opposition to Sultan Abdülhamid. Later, most of them had served Unionist governments or been members of the CUP. In the circumstances, it was the critics of the leadership within the party, and particularly of its decision to side with Germany in the war, who took over from the defeated Unionist triumvirate. Talât was succeeded by a distinguished soldier, Ahmed İzzet Pasha, an outspoken opponent of the war policy of the triumvirate, who had nevertheless served with distinction as overall commander of the Caucasian front before the Russian Revolution. Ahmed İzzet was a bluff German-trained officer of Albanian origin, born in Macedonia. His long-standing association with the Germans showed in his moustache in the style of Kaiser Wilhelm II. More importantly, he was attached to the Ottoman dynasty with all the strength of the Albanian ideal of besa – the tradition of total loyal commitment to a patron. When an Albanian state emerged in 1913 from the Ottoman defeat in the Balkan wars, he was offered the position of head of state as Prince of\n\nAlbania. Ahmed İzzet refused, saying that it would be a step down for a servant of the Ottoman Sultan. It was, as the Turkish saying had it, ‘to dismount a horse in order to ride a donkey’. Ahmed İzzet’s cabinet included three prominent Unionist critics of the triumvirate: Cavid, who as Finance Minister had extracted every penny he could from Enver’s German allies, Fethi (who later took the surname Okyar), an early political patron of Mustafa Kemal, and a naval officer, Rauf (later Orbay), who had risen to fame during the Balkan Wars as captain of the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye, evading capture as she raided the coasts of the Balkan allies. While German influence was strong in the army, the Ottoman navy, which had British advisers before the war, was traditionally pro-British, and Rauf felt, as it proved, an exaggerated confidence in British good intentions. Mustafa Kemal, who was busy reorganising the remnants of Ottoman forces on the Syrian front, had sensed that a change of government was necessary to end the hostilities. Presuming on his friendship with the new Sultan Vahdettin, he advised him to appoint Ahmed İzzet Pasha Grand Vizier, and asked for himself the post of War Minister. The telegram was delayed, and Ahmed İzzet was appointed without the benefit of Mustafa Kemal’s advice. As a professional soldier, the new Grand Vizier preferred to keep the post of War Minister for himself. The first job of the new Ottoman government was to establish contact with the Allies. The abject condition of the country showed through the high-flown Ottoman chancery rhetoric of the decree appointing Ahmed İzzet to the post of Grand Vizier: ‘Whereas it is our most particular wish that the effects produced by the present war, which has been waged with extreme violence for more than four years, on the general affairs of our dominions and their good order and discipline should be rectified, and that concord and general amity should be established among all classes of our people, it is our expectation that you apply your well-known zeal and devote the greatest care to the choice of powerful and efficient measures to obtain the means to bring to a successful conclusion the political initiatives we have undertaken in order to achieve these aims and, at the same time, to secure the supremacy of religious and civil law, the stability of safe and orderly government, to make perfect the condition of ease and well-being of our people, supplying them with the necessities of life without further delay and facilitating the satisfaction of general needs.’18 In other words, the country is prey to anarchy and lawlessness, people are at each other’s throats, they are at their wits’ ends with hunger and privation. Please do something about it quickly, and make sure that the Allies respond to our political overtures. At the beginning of October the Sultan had sent a personal representative to Bern who arranged that the agent of an Armenian Ottoman dignitary Boghos Nubar Pasha should communicate his peace terms to the British minister in Switzerland, Sir Horace Rumbold. Vahdettin proposed that the Arab provinces should become autonomous under his suzerainty, that the Greek islands off Turkey’s Aegean coast should be returned to the Ottoman state along with Bulgarian gains in the Balkan Wars, that the British should help him destroy the CUP and should maintain him on the throne. In exchange he offered an alliance with Britain and reforms under British control.19 In other words, if the British made good the territorial losses the Ottoman Empire had suffered under the rule of the Young Turks, he was prepared to place himself under British protection. What Vahdettin did not realise was that while he was ready to trade the independence of his state for its nominal territorial integrity and his survival as\n\nSultan, his subjects had other ideas. So too had the British who were already in possession of the Ottomans’ Arab provinces. Nubar Pasha, on whose good offices the Sultan relied, was soon afterwards to demand from the Allies a large slice of Ottoman territory for an independent Armenian state. A few days later, the British received a similar offer from an independent-minded Unionist, Rahmi, who had run İzmir and the surrounding country as his personal fiefdom during the war, had protected the large community of Allied subjects who lived and traded there and had prevented the deportation of Armenians from the area. Rahmi had one additional request – that Britain should replace Germany as Turkey’s paymaster by guaranteeing the Ottoman currency. Where the Sultan had used an Armenian, Rahmi had used a Greek as an intermediary.20 Neither realised that the days of the multi-ethnic Ottoman state were numbered, and that the employment of local Christians to represent the Ottoman state could no longer conciliate either the Allies or the local Christian communities. These two attempts to initiate peace talks failed. Ahmed İzzet had better luck. This time the intermediary was the British General, Sir Charles Townshend, who had surrendered to the Turks after a six-month siege at Kut al-Amara in Mesopotamia in the spring of 1916. While 70 per cent of the 3,000 British rank-and-file who surrendered in Kut died in captivity – many during death marches through the desert, others due to appalling conditions in POW camps21 – Townshend was held in a comfortable villa on the island resort of Prinkipo/Büyükada, the largest of the Princes’ Islands in the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul. He had even been invited to tea by Enver. When he heard that Ahmed İzzet was forming a new cabinet, Townshend offered to transmit the Ottoman peace proposals to Admiral Sir Somerset Calthorpe, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, who had his headquarters on the Greek island of Lemnos in the Aegean. On 16 October, the Ottoman cabinet decided to seek a separate peace, after hearing a report on the military situation. ‘We have six or seven thousand men left on each front [Syria, Mesopotamia and Thrace],’ the Ottoman General Staff told Ahmet İzzet’s cabinet. ‘It’s so bad you could invade the country with a handful of bandits.’22 The delay in facing military facts had bred an exaggerated pessimism which was to weaken the hand of Ottoman negotiators. The following day, Ahmed İzzet received Townshend and accepted his offer to go to Lemnos. But, first of all, the composition of the Ottoman delegation and its instructions had to be decided. This did not prove easy. The Sultan, fearful and suspicious as ever, complicated matters. On 23 October Admiral Calthorpe informed the Ottoman government that he had been authorised to sign an armistice on behalf of the Allies. On hearing this, Ahmed İzzet sought the Sultan’s approval for a delegation led by the Ottoman army commander in İzmir, the port from which the Ottoman emissaries would set off for Lemnos. The Sultan disagreed and asked that the chief of the delegation should be his brother-in-law, Damad Ferid Pasha. (Damad means son-in-law, and the title was conferred on Ferid when he became the second husband of Mediha, the daughter of Sultan Vahdettin’s father, Abdülmecid I.) ‘The man is mad,’ objected Ahmet İzzet.23 He was not the first to say so. Ferid’s highest job in the Ottoman civil service had been that of First Secretary at the Ottoman embassy in London. When in 1888 Mediha had asked the reigning Sultan Abdülhamid II (Vahdettin’s elder brother) to send Ferid back to London, this time as ambassador, he had replied: ‘Sister, the London embassy is not a school, it’s an important embassy and the\n\nappointment should go to somebody who has experience and understanding of international politics.’24 Later, when the CUP came to power, Ferid extolled it to the skies. But as he failed to win promotion, he joined the opposition Liberty and Concord Party (known in the West as Liberal Union). Here too he was unlucky. When the CUP was briefly out of power at the beginning of the Balkan Wars, the Sultan proposed that Ferid should head the delegation to the peace talks in London. Ferid refused, saying that he could not sign away any part of Ottoman territory, as this would violate the Constitution. ‘The man is mad’, said the elderly Grand Vizier Kâmil Pasha, who knew that territorial losses were inevitable. Ferid thereafter twiddled his thumbs in his wife’s mansion on the Bosphorus. Where in Britain politics often revolved round the country houses of the aristocracy, in the late Ottoman Empire political decisions were taken and plots hatched in yalıs, wooden seaside mansions of princes and pashas on the shores of the Bosphorus. In later years many of these yalıs were burned down. A few survive in the hands of business tycoons. Damad Ferid’s (or rather his wife’s) yalı now houses a restaurant patronised by university professors. At the Sultan’s insistence, Ahmed İzzet called on Damad Ferid and heard out his views on the armistice. ‘As soon as I see the Admiral [Calthorpe],’ Damad Ferid declared, ‘I shall propose an armistice treaty based on the territorial integrity of the [Ottoman] state. If the Admiral won’t accept this, I will ask for a cruiser immediately and go straight to London. On arrival, I will have an audience with the King and say “I was an old friend of your father’s. I expect you to accept my wishes.” Having thus ensured that our proposals are accepted, I’ll rescue the state from the catastrophe into which the Unionists have plunged it.’ However, he could not leave immediately as he had to pack his clothes. When he was ready, he would leave on the Sultan’s yacht, taking with him the secretary of the Greek Patriarch.25 A year later, the Patriarch was to sever all relations with the Ottoman state and demand that the Ottoman capital should come under Greek rule. This nonsense confirmed Ahmed İzzet’s original estimate of Damad Ferid’s capacity. Loyal to the Sultan as he was, Ahmed ‘I will ask for a İzzet insisted that the cabinet should be free to choose its own cruiser immediately chief negotiator. Sultan Vahdettin gave way with bad grace, but and go straight to insisted that the instructions to the Ottoman delegates should London. On arrival I specify that ‘the rights of the Sultanate, the Caliphate and of the will have an audience Ottoman dynasty should be protected’,26 and that the autonomy to with the King and say be given to some provinces should be administrative and not “I was a friend of political. Ahmed İzzet objected that these were matters to be your father’s. I expect settled in the peace treaty and not in an armistice agreement. Once you to accept my again the Sultan gave way, but asked that the armistice should at wishes.”’ least ensure the safe return of an Ottoman prince who was cut off DAMAD FERID PASHA in Libya. Having warded off – for a short period of time, as it proved – the Sultan’s interference, Ahmed İzzet’s cabinet chose Rauf, the patriotic naval officer, as chief negotiator. He was told that he could agree to the opening of the Straits and to the reduction in size of the Ottoman army to peacetime strength. However, no Greek warships should be allowed through the Straits, which would be defended by the Ottoman army. British control\n\nofficers would be allowed until the conclusion of peace, but no Allied forces should land anywhere in the territories which the Ottomans still controlled, and there should be no interference in Ottoman administration. Any conditions incompatible with the honour of the Ottoman state should be rejected. German and Austro-Hungarian troops and officials should be given at least two months to leave the country, but civilians from these countries should be allowed to stay on, if they wished, lest Germany and Austria-Hungary decide to retaliate by expelling from their territories Ottoman students, whose number was estimated at 15–20,000.27 The insistence on decent treatment of the Ottomans’ German and Austrian allies shows that, in spite of wartime friction between Turks and their German advisers, there was little animosity against them. On the military level, the alliance had worked well. True, the importance of German commanders in the Ottoman war effort was often exaggerated in Britain and France. Their most important help was in communications, staff work and, of course, supplies. The Germans worked hard to maintain and extend Ottoman railways; the AustroHungarians provided a motor transport unit on the Caucasian front.28 In Turkish popular tradition, the Germans stood for precision in everything. ‘How do you make a good pilaff?’ a German officer asks a Turkish army cook in a well known joke. ‘You need enough rice, enough fat, enough water, and cook the rice long enough’ the cook replies. But the German wants precise information. ‘What do you mean by enough?’ he asks. ‘It’s obvious, Sir,’ says the cook, ‘enough to make a good pilaff’. The Germans had their own stories of the happy-go-lucky attitude of Ottoman officers. One day, a German officer was horrified to see that his Ottoman companions were using a map of Gallipoli while fighting the British in Palestine. ‘It’s the wrong map,’ he cried. ‘What do you mean by wrong map?’ replies the Ottoman. ‘It served us well enough all through the campaign in Galicia.’ Later these good-natured stories gave way to angrier reminiscences, and today many Turks will tell you that in the First World War, the Germans evacuated their wounded by rail, but left the Turks to die in the desert. This was true, but there were many more Turks than Germans, and the Germans fought in a foreign country while the Turks were, at least theoretically, at home among the Arabs. The Germans left the Ottoman Empire in good time, but the other conditions on which the Ottoman armistice negotiators were to insist were sacrificed. Rauf and his fellow delegates were acutely aware of the weakness of the Ottoman state and of its urgent need for peace. They did not realise that, late as it was to conclude a separate peace under favourable conditions, there was still room for bargaining. Germany had not yet surrendered and the Allies wanted above all to send their navy through the Turkish Straits in order to cut off German troops in south-eastern Europe and the Caucasus. What is more, they had conflicting ambitions in the Near East. The instructions communicated to Admiral Calthorpe after difficult consultations in London and Paris defined a first bargaining position, but the Admiral was told that he could make concessions, provided the Straits were opened, its fortifications placed under Allied control, the Germans expelled and the Ottoman army demobilised. This Ahmed İzzet’s government was, in any case, prepared to concede. But it did not have to agree to peace at any price. There was no domestic pressure for unconditional surrender. In spite of widespread hardships, there were no military mutinies or civil disturbances in the areas under Ottoman control. The Istanbul government did not fear the disaffection of the Sultan’s Muslim subjects.\n\nWhat terrified it was the prospect of a rising by local Christians, above all by the numerous Greeks in the capital. In Turkish eyes, Greece was a Johnny-come-lately in the ranks of the Allies. Greece was still neutral when Allied troops under French command landed in Salonica in October 1916. It was under the protection of the Allies that the Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos formed a provisional government in that city and declared war on Bulgaria and the Central Powers. Greek troops thereafter fought under French command against the Bulgarians and Germans on the Macedonian front, and the Allies made use of Greek territory to prosecute the war with the Ottoman state. But there had been no fighting between Greek and Ottoman troops. Greece was not consulted when Admiral Calthorpe sat down to negotiate an armistice with the Ottoman delegation. However, the Ottoman government was well aware that Greek nationalists, who had found a champion in Venizelos, coveted Constantinople/Istanbul as well as Smyrna/İzmir and the surrounding area. The Turks knew that they had been defeated by the British and not by the Greeks, and resented the idea that the latter should figure among the victorious Allies, particularly in the streets of the imperial capital. The negotiations between Admiral Calthorpe and Rauf opened on 27 October on board HMS Agamemnon, which was anchored in Moudros Bay (Mondros in Turkish), a natural deep-water harbour on the island of Lemnos. The delegations met in the captain’s large day cabin, comfortably furnished with Persian rugs, which opened on to a pleasant stern walk. Both sides behaved with impeccable good manners. Calthorpe made some concessions to the Turks. But these concerned conditions on which he had not been instructed to insist. Only one concession was to prove important. Where the Turks had originally been asked to withdraw all their troops from former Tsarist territory in the Caucasus (and north-west Persia, whose neutrality had been violated by both sides during the war), the final text stipulated that ‘the remainder [of the Ottoman troops] [is] to be evacuated if requested by the Allies after they have studied the situation’. The Ottoman troops sent by Enver to the Caucasus and Persia had not affected the course of the war. But these fresh divisions, well-armed with weapons from Tsarist arsenals or handed over by the Germans, were to become the nucleus of the Turkish national army when the War of Independence started a year later. A condition in the armistice calling for consultations with the Turkish government to determine the strength and disposition of Ottoman troops which were to maintain internal order after the demobilisation of the bulk of the Ottoman army, allowed Turkish nationalists to keep this military nucleus in order to avert the final catastrophe – the occupation and partition of the whole of Turkey. The way had been opened for this by the insertion into the text of the armistice of Article 7 which read: ‘The Allies have the right to occupy any strategic points in the event of a situation arising which threatens Allied security.’ The condition that a threat should arise to justify occupation was included as a concession to the Turks. But it was of no practical effect, since it was the Allies who would decide whether they were threatened. Article 7 meant that the Allies could occupy any part or the whole of Turkey if they were so minded. Rauf had stood out against this clause, but he finally gave way when Calthorpe threatened to break off negotiations. The text of the armistice agreement was signed late in the evening of 30 October. Immediately after the signing, Calthorpe gave a letter to Rauf ‘I discovered that the promising that only British and French troops would be used to\n\noccupy the Straits and that a small number of Turkish soldiers would be allowed to remain when the forts were occupied. This promise was kept. Calthorpe said also that he had passed on the Turkish requests that no Greek warships should sail to Istanbul or İzmir, and that Istanbul should not be occupied unless the Turkish government failed to maintain order there. The request was indeed passed on. But as the Turks were to discover before long, the Allies turned a deaf ear to it. Calthorpe described the final ceremony in a letter to his wife: ‘I had champagne on ice in readiness as I knew that all was going to be well and there was hand-shaking, toasting and polite speeches. Raouf Bey made me a very graceful little speech thanking me for my hospitality and consideration to him as a technical enemy, and he delighted me, and I am sure you, by saying that our twins [whose photograph decorated the cabin] had also taken an important part in this historic event. He said that their cheery smiling faces had been a source of inspiration and encouragement to him in his most difficult and anxious hours. He had often come in and looked at them and they had told him what to do for the cause of humanity. Wasn’t that nice!’29 Rauf returned to Istanbul on 1 November, convinced that he had won the confidence of the British and had secured the best possible terms. ‘Our country’s rights and the future of the Sultanate have been wholly saved as a result of the armistice we have concluded’, he told journalists, adding: ‘First, I discovered that the British are not aiming at the destruction of the Turkish nation. Second, I saw that our country, contrary to what was expected, will not be occupied. I assure you that not a single enemy soldier will disembark in Istanbul … Yes, the armistice we have concluded is beyond our hopes.’30 The Grand Vizier, Ahmed İzzet, was pleased with what Rauf Tevfik Pasha (1845– had achieved. Rauf’s main concern now was to avoid inter1936), last Ottoman communal clashes, which would give the Allies grounds for Grand Vizier, was the occupying Ottoman territory. He insisted, therefore, that son of a general of irresponsible statements, likely to increase tension between Crimean origin. He Muslims and non-Muslims, and in particular between Turks and started his civil Greeks, should be avoided. One such statement was attributed to service career in Damad Ferid Pasha who was reported to have said that Ahmed 1865, and after İzzet’s government was plotting to massacre Greeks in Istanbul. serving as Ottoman Damad Ferid was clearly peeved at his exclusion from the ambassador in various armistice negotiations. But his behaviour was symptomatic of the countries, became antagonisms which broke out within the Ottoman ruling class. The Foreign Minister in CUP had made many enemies during its six years in power. There 1895 during the reign were dissensions within its ranks as well as between it and the of Abdülhamid II. He ramshackle opposition represented by the Liberal Union, which, held office as Grand disastrously for the fate of the monarchy, Sultan Vahdettin Vizier briefly after supported. British are not aiming at the destruction of our nation … I assure you that not a single enemy soldier will disembark in Istanbul … Yes, the armistice we have concluded is beyond our hopes.’ RAUF, CHIEF OTTOMAN DELEGATE AT ARMISTICE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nImmediately on his return, Rauf went to the palace to report on the results of his mission. But Vahdettin pleaded tiredness and said that he would receive him a few days later. When the Sultan finally granted an audience, Rauf took the opportunity to complain about Damad Ferid’s behaviour. ‘I love Ferid Pasha as a good husband to my sister,’ Vahdettin replied deceptively, ‘but I do not share his views. I am particularly opposed to his political opinions. That’s why we disagree strongly.’ Then he blurted out: ‘There is a nation out there, which is like a flock of sheep. It needs a shepherd to look after it. I am that shepherd.’31 Events were to show that no-one was less qualified to be a shepherd, and that the Sultan shared the illusion of Damad Ferid and the publicists of the Liberal Union that the Allies would allow the Ottoman state to survive and keep its territory if only it made friends with the non-Muslim communities and made room for foreign business, schools and missionaries. This illusion was fed by a nostalgia for the times of Abdülhamid II, when foreigners and local Christians, including the bulk of the Armenians, prospered. A return to the golden age of Abdülhamid, coupled with the abandonment of the late monarch’s pan-Islamism which had threatened Britain and France, was the bait that Vahdettin and the Liberal Union offered the Allies. But the Allies were not tempted. Before this became clear, the Istanbul press, which had been freed from censorship in June 1918, directed its anger at the CUP, including critics of the triumvirate who were now members of the cabinet. The attacks redoubled when the CUP leadership – Enver, Cemal, Talât and a handful of close associates, including the former police chief in the capital – slipped out of Istanbul in the night of 1/2 November on board a German U-boat.32 The following day they arrived in German-occupied Crimea. None of them was to see Turkey again. In Istanbul, Ahmed İzzet’s cabinet was accused by the opposition of collusion in the flight or, at least, incompetence in failing to prevent it. This gave the Sultan the opportunity to press for the exclusion from the government of former members of the CUP. Rather than comply with what he saw as an abuse of the sovereign’s prerogative, Ahmed İzzet submitted his resignation on 11 November 1918 after less than a month in office. He was succeeded by an even older man, Ahmed Tevfik Pasha, who had been the last Grand Vizier of Sultan Abdülhamid. As he saw monarchies tumble first in Russia, then in AustriaHungary and Germany, Vahdettin feared betrayal by his own ministers. In the case of Ahmed Tevfik, he thought that he could count, at least, on family loyalty, as the new Grand Vizier’s son was courting and was soon to marry Vahdettin’s daughter. Thus with a fearful and suspicious the 1909 counterrevolution, when he tried in vain to prevent the CUP-led troops from fighting their way into the capital. He was then posted as ambassador to London, and was considered sufficiently pro-Allies to be appointed as Grand Vizier shortly after the armistice of 1918. He was unsuccessful in persuading the Allies to moderate their demands at Sèvres. Known as a conciliator, he became Grand Vizier for the third and last time after Damad Ferid’s final departure in 1920. Mustafa Kemal did not need his services at the end of the War of Independence, allowing him to live undisturbed in his retirement in Istanbul.\n\nSultan on the throne, yesterday’s men – Enver, Cemal and Talât – were replaced by the men of the day before yesterday. It is in their company that Sultan Vahdettin presided over the demise of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n2\n\nBroken Promises The armistice agreement provided that all hostilities were to cease on 31 October 1918. This was clear enough. But there were clauses in the agreement which were open to wilful misinterpretation. One such clause gave the Allies the right to occupy any strategic points if their security was threatened. Other clauses listed the Arab provinces where any remaining Turkish garrisons were to surrender, and also areas which the Ottoman army had to evacuate. However, the lists were not based on existing administrative divisions. Turkish garrisons were to surrender in Mesopotamia; they had to withdraw from Cilicia. But these regions, named in classical antiquity, had no precise borders. On 1 November, the British commander in Mesopotamia ordered his troops to occupy Mosul. The local Ottoman commander protested that Mosul was not in Mesopotamia and that Allied security was not threatened. The Grand Vizier, Ahmed İzzet, instructed the Ottoman commander to comply, adding bitterly, ‘I fail to understand how the British can use the sophistry of one of their officers to break the word they gave two days ago.’1 The British occupied Mosul on 8 November. A report written in July 1918 by the oil expert of the Royal Navy, Rear Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, had stressed the importance of British control over the newly discovered oilfield in the province of Mosul.2 British proconsuls pondering the political future of Mesopotamia as British-Mandated Iraq, believed that the new state would be indefensible without the province of Mosul, which provided a natural northern rampart. A selfdenying interpretation of the armistice agreement was not going to stand in their way. On the borders of Syria, Mustafa Kemal ordered his troops to resist the British who wanted to occupy the port of Alexandretta (İskenderun) soon after the armistice was signed. Once again, the Istanbul government ordered him to give way. Alexandretta was the port of Aleppo, and its facilities were needed to supply British troops, which had occupied northern Syria and were about to cede it to the French. On 25 November a French officer arrived in Adana, the main Turkish city south of the Taurus range at the centre of the Cilician plain, and told the Ottoman governor that as French troops intended to occupy the area, Turkish troops should be withdrawn immediately. The French army duly arrived on 21 December, accompanied by Armenian auxiliaries. Armenians who had been expelled in 1915 began to return.3 It was only at this point that Turkish nationalist resistance became a threat to Allied security. Mustafa Kemal had by then left Adana. After the Ottoman war ‘Just as they have ministry had abolished his command, he made his way to Istanbul come, so too they will where he arrived on 13 November. When he stepped off the train, go.’ he saw 55 Allied warships steam into the harbour and prepare to MUSTAFA KEMAL, anchor off the Sultan’s palace at Dolmabahçe.4 Just as they have SPEAKING OF come, so too will they go, he is reported to have said.5 Soon ALLIED WARSHIPS afterwards, Vahdettin moved to Abdülhamid’s old palace at IN ISTANBUL Yıldız, up the hill from Dolmabahçe. Its seclusion suited the new Sultan’s secretive and suspicious nature, which he shared with his\n\nlong-reigning elder brother, Abdülhamid. But while Abdülhamid had an intelligent grasp of world affairs and knew how to safeguard his dominions, Vahdettin lived in a fog of misapprehensions. The heir apparent, Vahdettin’s cousin and discreet critic Abdülmecid, took up residence in Dolmabahçe with its panoramic view of the Allied warships. An initial group of British officers had arrived in Istanbul on 7 November on board an Ottoman torpedo-boat. They were met by a crowd shouting ‘Long live the Allies.’ As soon as the armistice was announced, Christians and foreigners in the capital put out Allied flags in their neighbourhoods. Greek flags were particularly prominent, reflecting the strength of the Greek community. The Muslims resented what they saw as the impertinence of the Sultan’s Greek subjects. Inter-communal friction grew, but neither then nor in the subsequent four years which were to pass before Istanbul came once again under Turkish rule, were there any clashes between the religious communities, let alone a rising by local Greeks. Allied security was not threatened. Nevertheless, Istanbul was placed under informal Allied occupation. Admiral Calthorpe became Allied High Commissioner, governing with the help of British, French and Italian commissioners. British troops which disembarked on 13 November were joined by a French brigade, sent by rail from Salonica, and then by an Italian contingent. Most galling of all to the Turks, the Greek Patriarchate, the office of the Greek High Commissioner and other Greek premises were guarded by Greek soldiers. The word ‘occupation’ was studiously avoided, but Allied General Sir (later control officers were attached to all Ottoman ministries and Field Marshal Lord) police. Public buildings and private residences were Edmund Allenby requisitioned to accommodate them. The Allies had their own (1861–1936), last courts, police and detention centres, as well as competing and great British overlapping intelligence services, employing a host of local commander of horsed informers. At one time the French alone had four separate cavalry, saw service intelligence agencies, all scrambling to supply political in the Boer War and information. Allied intelligence officers divided their attention on the Western Front between the CUP underground, to which they attributed the rise in in the First World Turkish nationalist feeling, and Bolshevik agents, whom they War, before being put suspected of colluding with Turkish nationalists to thwart Allied in command in June designs. 1917 of the Egyptian As Allied controls multiplied, so public security deteriorated Expeditionary Force, in the capital. A French journalist, who had known Istanbul before which had made no the War, wrote: ‘Murders, burglaries and kidnappings have never progress against been so frequent and gone so generally unpunished. It is easy to Ottoman troops for see why. Instead, or rather on top, of the Turkish police there is over two years. In a now an inter-allied police, whose commander is British and daring campaign of whose officers are British, Italian and French, roughly in equal rapid movement, he numbers. The job of fighting crime has thus been entrusted to fine captured the Ottoman fellows, who may be professionally well qualified, but who know fortress of Gaza and nothing of the country, its geography or the languages and customs entered Jerusalem – of its inhabitants. When two British officers stopped the motor car on foot as a sign of of the Grand Vizier for speeding and arrested its occupant, gossip\n\nin the European quarter had it that it was a devilishly clever plot to lay hands on documents in the car. My guess is though that the British policemen who arrested Tevfik Paşa did not know him, and that had they recognised him they would have let him through, as they would have let through Mr Lloyd George in similar circumstances.’6 The arrival in November 1920 of tens of thousands of White Russians, the remnants of the forces defeated by the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, compounded the confusion. The Russians were destitute. So too were thousands of Muslim refugees from the war zones. There were Armenian orphans whose families had perished during the deportations, and Greeks who sought their fortune in the capital. Western aid agencies, chief among them the American Near Eastern Relief, eased the lot of Christians. The Muslims, who filled the courtyards of mosques and other public buildings, had to rely on the charity of their compatriots. The Ottoman treasury was bankrupt and had to solicit foreign loans in order to pay the salaries of the military and the civil service which were the main employers of educated Turks. White Russian women found employment as hostesses in bars and night clubs. Russian theosophists, George Gurdjieff (who became notorious as the guru of the dying Katherine Mansfield) and Peter Ouspensky, made their appearance before moving on to Paris. Table-tapping and other forms of mumbo-jumbo popular in fin de siècle St Petersburg brought together locals and Allied officers, who were also fascinated by Whirling Dervishes and other quaint Oriental spectacles. General Allenby arrived in Istanbul on 7 February 1919 and presented a list of demands to the Ottoman government. The French, convinced as ever, that the British were trying to elbow them out, sent General Franchet d’Esperey, the commander of the Salonica-based Army of the Orient. He made a triumphal entry on 8 February, mounted on a white charger. Local Christians were delirious with pleasure. But far from safeguarding them – let alone making them top dog in a diverse city – Allied occupation endangered their survival in the face of Turkish resentment. Like the British, the French tried at first to build up the Sultan as a useful puppet. Addressing students at the Imperial Lycée, which educated the Turkish ruling class in French culture, Franchet d’Esperey described Vahdettin as ‘the best and most enlightened of Sultans’, who was labouring to bring peace and security to his country.7 The Turks, treated like colonial native subjects of the Emperor of Annam, were not impressed. But they noted the rivalry between the Allies and turned it to their advantage. First, however, the Turks had to deal with demands the Allies had made earlier that CUP leaders should be arrested and Ottoman war criminals should be tried. As parliament, in which the CUP still had a presence, resisted Allied pressure, Vahdettin dissolved it on 21 December. On 13 January Tevfik Pasha was asked to form a new and more compliant government. But this too failed to satisfy the Allies or the Sultan who wanted to have a free hand to steer the country into the safe harbour of British protection. Tevfik Pasha was forced to resign and on 4 March respect – in December 1917. After regrouping his troops, he shattered the remaining Ottoman forces, commanded by Mustafa Kemal, on the plain of Megiddo in northern Palestine. The Allenby bridge over the river Jordan perpetuates his memory. After the war, Allenby served as High Commissioner in Egypt, which was recognised as a sovereign state in 1922.\n\n1919, the Sultan’s brother-in-law, and first choice all along, Damad Ferid became Grand Vizier. The Allies, and particularly the British, thought they had found their man. Damad Ferid wasted no time in trying to satisfy their expectations. On 8 March a court martial was set up to try war General (later criminals, including the CUP leadership which, in the words of Marshal) Louis the new Minister of the Interior, was responsible ‘for the murder Franchet d’Esperey of 800,000 Armenians, the deportation of 400,000 Greeks and the (1856–1942) first saw service in North deaths of four million Turks’.8 Leading Unionists, including opponents of the leadership, and Africa, where he was Turkish nationalists, generally, both military and civilian, were born. Having failed to arrested. Journalists, who had fallen foul of the CUP, clamoured hold the Chemin des for revenge. ‘These men are not worthy of the gallows,’ wrote one Dames against the opponent of the CUP, ‘their heads should be wrenched off and German offensive of exhibited for days on chopping-blocks as a warning to the May 1918 on the public.’9 The violence of the language of pro-Allied journalists Western Front, he during the occupation has bequeathed the expression ‘armistice was appointed press’, used to this day in Turkey to stigmatise publications commander in May 1918 of the Army of deemed to damage the national interest. On 10 April, an Ottoman civil servant who had been deputy the Orient, the multigovernor of a province in central Anatolia during the Armenian national Allied force deportations was hanged in a public square. His funeral caused assembled in Salonica. such an explosion of nationalist anger that Damad Ferid’s He led it to victory government desisted from further executions and, fearing an against the Bulgarians attempt to free the arrested nationalists, asked the British High four months later, and Commissioner to deport them to Malta.

Finally, the CUP leaders who had fled remaining German the country were sentenced to death in absentia, but the verdict forces in southmade it clear that all this meant was that they would be re-tried if eastern Europe, and forced Hungary to they ever returned. The value of the testimony laid before the court is hotly surrender. disputed. Advocates of the claim that the deportations put into effect a project by the CUP government to destroy the Armenians as an ethnic community and should, therefore, be condemned as an act of genocide, cite the text of the indictment and extracts from witnesses’ statements which were published in the official gazette of the Ottoman government in Istanbul. Their opponents dismiss the courts martial as tools of victors’ justice, and point to shortcomings in their conduct, to the loss of documentation, and to instances of forgery by Armenian nationalists. They also cite the statement by Admiral Sir John de Robeck, who replaced Admiral Calthorpe in 1919 as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean and British High Commissioner in Istanbul, that the trials were a dead failure and that ‘their findings cannot be held of any account at all’.10 The British authorities subsequently decided not to put on trial any of the leading Turkish nationalists, associated with the CUP, whom they held in detention in Malta.\n\nSultan Vahdettin and his brother-in-law, the Grand Vizier, Damad Ferid, deluded themselves into thinking that by bending to the demands of the Allies they would secure the territory still controlled by the Ottoman army at the end of the hostilities. The British, in particular, did not help the men who had volunteered to be their puppets. Admiral Calthorpe, the first British High Commissioner in Istanbul, declared ‘it has been our consistent attitude to show no kind of favour whatsoever to any Turk …’ He added for good measure: ‘All interchange of hospitality and comity has been rigorously forbidden.’11 No wonder that Rauf, who had negotiated the armistice, and believed that he had won Calthorpe’s trust and friendship, resigned his commission in the Ottoman navy and warned Damad Ferid that his policy would cause a rebellion.12 Calthorpe may have been needlessly provocative, but he was ‘It has been our not responsible for policy. He had negotiated the armistice on consistent attitude to behalf of all the Allies. Then as British High Commissioner, he show no kind of chaired the meetings of Allied representatives in the Ottoman favour whatsoever to capital. The Allies had conflicting designs in Turkey. They were any Turk … All agreed on partitioning the country, but they disagreed on the interchange of distribution of spoils. hospitality and comity Britain’s traditional preoccupation was with the safety of the has been rigorously route to India. Having achieved political control over Egypt and forbidden.’ the shores of the Persian Gulf before the War, British governments LORD were not at first keen to rule other Ottoman territories. But as CALTHORPE, British armies moved north into Palestine, Syria and BRITISH HIGH Mesopotamia, the appetite grew for a more permanent presence in COMMISSIONER IN these lands. ISTANBUL Tsarist Russia had two traditional ambitions: to gain Constantinople and with it control of the sea lanes in and out of the Black Sea and to add to its conquest of the Caucasus. France had extensive investments in the Ottoman Empire and wished to buttress them with direct political control. In addition, it saw itself as the protector of Catholics, including Uniates (members of indigenous Christian communities which accepted the primacy of the Pope), particularly in Lebanon, where it had become the patron of the Maronite (Uniate) community. Italy, having wrested from the Ottomans Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and the Dodecanese Islands on the eve of the First World War, wanted to be rewarded with a zone of influence in Anatolia. At the same time, the Allies sought to protect themselves against each other. Britain looked for buffer zones between its possessions and those of its ally, and rival, Russia. The French were convinced that the British wanted to reduce to the minimum their political influence in the Near East, and the Italians had a well-founded suspicion that their ambitions did not enjoy the full-hearted support of their allies. As the war progressed, the Allies concluded and then revised agreements in order to reconcile their conflicting demands. It was the British attempt in 1915 to force a passage through the Straits in order to open up a supply route to the hard-pressed Russian armies that aroused the Russians’ fears that they might be done out of Constantinople, if the British got there first. This gave rise to the first partition agreement in March 1915 between Britain and Russia, to which France gave its assent the\n\nfollowing month. The Russians were promised Constantinople. What prompted Britain and France to enter unwillingly into this commitment was the fear that, if they did not, Russia might change sides in the war.13 Trust was in short supply in inter-Allied relations. It was Britain which called the shots in the intricate negotiations on the disposal of Ottoman lands; and Britain’s Near Eastern policy had been taken over by a bunch of young Conservatives, the ‘Neocons’ of the time, who were in cahoots with Liberal imperialists. The most active of these was Sir Mark Sykes, a Catholic baronet, heir to large estates on Humberside. As a young man, he had travelled in the Ottoman Empire soon after power had been seized by the Young Turks, to whom he took an instant dislike. In temperament he was a Young Turk himself, a young ambitious amateur. But he was well-born, and the Young Turks were in his eyes a bunch of parvenus manipulated by Jews and Freemasons. Sykes’s obsession with the Jews, whose hand he saw in every twist and turn of politics, had been fed by another Catholic, the Irishman Gerald Fitzmaurice, who, as Chief Dragoman (interpreter, the title given to the official who acted as intermediary between a foreign embassy and local authorities), was the local expert at the British embassy in Constantinople. Sir Aubrey Herbert, a friend of Mark Sykes and, like him, a young conservative MP, thought Fitzmaurice ‘cunning as a weasel and as savage’.14 But cunning as he was, the Chief Dragoman did not understand that the Young Turks were first and foremost Turkish nationalists, and not the instruments of a JudaeoMasonic conspiracy. The British government had a better expert in the person of Brigadier Sir Wyndham Deedes, a squire from Kent (and uncle of the distinguished journalist and Conservative junior minister Bill Deedes). Herbert and Deedes saw themselves as pro-Turkish, but after the CUP had thrown in its lot with the Germans, their knowledge of Turkey was deployed to no good purpose in the failed Gallipoli expedition, while Sykes became the leading member of a government committee set up in London to plan the future governance of the Near East. After the armistice, Deedes was posted to Istanbul, but his advice was disregarded. Wild exaggerations of the power of world Jewry had a paradoxical consequence in the issue of the Balfour Declaration on 2 November 1917, promising British support for ‘the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people’. For if the Jews were so powerful, it was essential to detach them from the Germans and enlist them for the Allied cause. In the words of the distinguished Middle Eastern scholar, Elie Kedourie, ‘it may well be that such fictions helped to persuade the British government to fall for and take up Zionism: Clio is indeed an ironic muse.’15 Sykes and Deedes became Zionists. Their feelings were shared by Lloyd George, whose Christian Zionism was rooted in the Biblical inspiration of Welsh Nonconformist Protestants. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, who was a member of the Liberal Party at that time, having started as a Conservative, and who was later to re-cross the floor and rejoin the Tories, was also sympathetic to the Zionist project. Churchill, who throughout his life demonstrated the truth of the saying that consistency is the mark of a small mind, had converted from a pro-Turkish to a virulently anti-Turkish stance (before becoming much more sensible about Turkey in 1923 after his policy had been thwarted by the Turks). Not surprisingly, the Turks had few friends in London during the First World War. Lord Curzon, former Viceroy of India and a leading member of the War Cabinet after 1916, who\n\nbelieved that he had mastered ‘the art of getting on with Orientals’,16 advocated firmness in dealing with them. His aversion to the Turks (and to foreigners generally) was shared by many British diplomats, including the young diplomat, snobbish recorder of contemporary events and political maverick, Harold Nicolson, the son of Sir Arthur Nicolson, the Permanent UnderSecretary at the Foreign Office. But the most determined – and least knowledgeable – opponent of the Turks was Lloyd George. His Nonconformist background predisposed him to follow in the steps of Gladstone who had taken up the cause of Christian communities in the Ottoman Empire and wished to see the Turks driven out of Europe ‘bag and baggage’. Lloyd George’s support for Greek nationalist ambitions at the expense of Turkey can be traced back to the Balkan War in 1912 when, as a practising solicitor in London, he became friends with a Greek expatriate solicitor (and political intriguer) John Stavridi. At a dinner at 11 Downing Street, at which both Stavridi and Lloyd George were present, Britain’s future wartime leader ordered champagne and proposed the following toast: ‘I drink to the [Balkan] allies, the representative of one of whom we have here tonight, and may the Turk be turned out of Europe and sent to … where he came from.’17 Stavridi was in contact with the Greek nationalist leader, the Cretan lawyer Eleftherios Venizelos, who first became prime minister in 1910, and who was to return to power in Athens at the end of the War after heading the breakaway pro-Allied government in Salonica. Lloyd George met Venizelos and fell under his spell. Venizelos was ably seconded by the wealthy and well-connected Greek community of expatriate merchants and shipowners who canvassed support for the Great Project (literally ‘Great Idea’, Meghali Idhea, a translation of the French journalistic cliché, la grande idée du 19ème siècle, when there were many such grand projects) – the recreation of the Byzantine Empire. However, Greek ambitions did not figure in the original partition plans. The inter-Allied agreement ceding Istanbul to the Russians was followed by the plan drawn up in London by Mark Sykes and a French representative, François Georges Picot, in May 1916, after the failure of the Gallipoli operation. This partition plan, with which first Russia and then Italy were associated, divided all Ottoman territories outside a small area in central and northern Anatolia between the four Principal Allies. Russia, having already been promised Istanbul, was to acquire Turkey’s Black Sea coast up to a point west of Trabzon (Trebizond) and a large tract of eastern Anatolia. The gains of the Western Allies would come in two forms: areas which were to be placed under their direct control and zones of influence. The Italians were to get western and south-western Anatolia, including İzmir and Antalya, as their fief and a further area north of İzmir as a zone of influence. The French were promised direct control of the coastal area from northern Palestine through to Cilicia, and a chunk of territory in inland Anatolia. In addition, their zone of influence was to extend from the Syrian coast eastwards as far as, and including, Mosul. They would thus separate Russian acquisitions from British gains, which included direct control of what is now southern Iraq, and a zone of influence from the River Jordan eastwards to the Persian frontier. The Holy Land was to become an international zone. The Sykes-Picot agreement assumed its final form in April 1917 after a meeting of British, French and Italian leaders at St Jean de Maurienne on the Franco-Italian border. Russia, which was in turmoil after the revolution in February that year and the fall of the monarchy, was not\n\nrepresented. In any case, all previous concessions to the Russians were cancelled when the Bolsheviks seized power in November and then negotiated a separate peace with Germany in March 1918. The Bolsheviks for their part repudiated all the secret treaties concluded by their predecessors and, to the embarrassment of the Western Allies, published their texts, which thus became known to the Turks. However this knowledge does not seem to have affected the expectations of the Ottoman representatives who negotiated the armistice at the end of October that year. In their minds, wartime arrangements had been superseded by President Wilson’s repudiation of secret treaties and his promise to satisfy legitimate national rights through open diplomacy. But as far as the Allies were concerned, the Sykes-Picot partition plan, as modified at St Jean de Maurienne and then by the collapse of Tsarist Russia, was, at least in theory, still the basis of a Near Eastern settlement. Nevertheless, the spirit of Woodrow Wilson brooded over the Peace Conference which opened in Versailles in January 1919. Its first product was the Covenant of the League of Nations which was approved the following month. Article 22 of the Covenant proclaimed in self-righteous terms: ‘To those colonies and territories which, as a consequence of the late war, have ceased to be under the "
