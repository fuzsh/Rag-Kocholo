        "text": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday March 27 2007\n\nGeneral Sir Charles Harington, who has died aged 96, won the Military Cross in a last-ditch stand near Dunkirk in 1940 and the Distinguished Service Order in the Normandy campaign four years later, and went on to hold a wide variety of staff posts. He came from a military family, went to school at Malvern, was an officer cadet at Sandhurst and joined the second battalion of the Cheshire regiment as a second lieutenant.\n\nThe second world war began for the British army very much as the first had done, with the dispatch of a British expeditionary force (BEF), initially of four divisions, to France under Field Marshal Lord Gort. Each division included an infantry battalion specialising in machine guns, a role assigned in General Harold Alexander's First Division to the second Cheshires.\n\nBy October 10 1939, the BEF was concentrated around Lille, between two French armies south of neutral Belgium's border. Unlike its 1914 predecessor, this BEF was poorly trained and poorly equipped in all areas, including communications, armour and artillery.\n\nLess than a month later, the \"phoney war\" was rudely ended by the German blitzkrieg invasion of northern France, Belgium and the neutral Netherlands on May 10 1940. As Winston Churchill supplanted Neville Chamberlain as prime minister back in London, the BEF moved north to the river Dyle, east of Brussels, as planned. It held its ground when attacked on May 14 and 15, but 72 German divisions overran Belgium, forcing the entire allied line south and west towards the English Channel. The British withdrew southwards, and with the French established a bridgehead round Dunkirk, surrounded by the Germans and with the sea at their back.\n\nIn a bitter fighting retreat from the river Dyle, Captain Harington's company was part of the rearguard of the First Division. His unit inflicted disproportionate damage on the enemy with its machine guns and escaped capture with the loss of just one section, about 10 men. This was the action that earned Harington his MC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royal Navy mounted Operation Dynamo. The man in charge, Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay at Dover, hoped to rescue 40,000 troops, but succeeded in rescuing a third of a million British and French soldiers; 40,000 were captured. The follow-up Operation Aerial lifted another 200,000 from further down the French coast.\n\nBack serving in England, Harington married Victoire Williams-Freeman in 1942. In spring 1944, as preparations were in full swing for the invasion of France, the by now Lieutenant-Colonel Harington was given command of the first battalion of the Manchester regiment. He had less than three months to turn this under-trained unit into an efficient fighting machine. That he succeeded beyond expectation was shown by the battalion's performance in the first six weeks after D-day on June 6 1944. For his leadership both in training and in the fighting that followed, he was awarded the DSO.\n\nAfter the war, Harington was appointed as an instructor at the staff college in Camberley, Surrey, before being assigned to the British military mission in Greece during the savage civil war, when Britain supported the ultimately successful campaign against the communist insurgency. In 1949 he took command of the first battalion of the Parachute Regiment. Two years later, he became military assistant to the chief of general staff and then served a term at Shape (Supreme HQ, Allied Powers, Europe).\n\nAs a brigadier, he was given charge of the 49th Infantry Brigade in 1955, which served in Kenya during the Mau Mau emergency. After commanding the school of infantry at Warminster for the usual two years, Harington was promoted to major-general in command of a home-based division in 1959, and headed the Camberley staff college from 1961.\n\nIn 1963 he was given his most difficult and delicate post as a lieutenant-general and commander-in-chief of combined British forces in the Middle East. This was a period fraught with the problems associated with the withdrawal from empire.\n\nAmong the crises Haringon had to deal with were the mutinies in the armies of the newly independent east African countries Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika - formerly members of the King's African Rifles. Small British army units were sent in to restore order. His greatest preoccupation, however, was the political quagmire of Aden, which the 1964 Labour government of Harold Wilson was resolved to leave.\n\nBefore that happened, Harington had sailed into calmer waters as deputy chief of the general staff in 1966. His last post in the army was as chief of personnel and logistics for all three services in the newly unified Ministry of Defence, a post he held from 1968 until his retirement in 1971. He was appointed CBE in 1957 and GCB in 1969.\n\nAfter his retirement General Harington held several honorary appointments associated with the services, including chairman of the Star and Garter home for disabled veterans at Richmond, Surrey. His wife died in 2000; he is survived by two daughters and a son."
