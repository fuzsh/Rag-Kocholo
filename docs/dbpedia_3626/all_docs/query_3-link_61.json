        "text": "§ 42. Mr. MARDY JONES\n\nasked the Secretary of State for War whether his attention has been called to the speech made by Lieut.-General Sir Charles Harington at York on 2nd December, in which he urged the issue of an ultimatum to China; whether this officer is General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Northern Command; whether, in expressing these views, General Harington is expressing official views; and, if not, whether he will take steps to restrain expressions of opinion such as these, which are likely to jeopardise our relations with China?\n\n§ Sir L. WORTHINGTON-EVANS\n\nI have not seen a report of the speech referred to, but Sir Charles Harington informs me that he expressed no such view as is attributed to him in the first part of the question.\n\n§ Mr. JONES\n\nMay I draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to the report in the \"Daily Telegraph\" to that effect, and if that report be correct, is it not desirable that the Government should make it clear that such expressions are not the official view of the Government?\n\n§ Sir L. WORTHINGTON-EVANS\n\nI have not called his special attention to that particular report, because I did not know of it, but Sir Charles Harington informs me that he expressed no such view as that attributed to him in this question."
