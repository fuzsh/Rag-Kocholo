        "text": "Biography\n\nCharlie Harrington graduated in Microbiology from Glasgow University where he developed an interest in chemical microbiology and the study of microbial cell walls. He completed his PhD working with Dr Julia Douglas on cell wall synthesis in yeast and followed with a one-year NIH-funded Fellowship with Dr Wilf Arnold in Kansas City, Missouri studying enzymes within the yeast cell envelope. After this, Charlie joined Professor Sir James Baddiley in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge as a Research Fellow, where he spent four years investigating the synthesis of bacterial cell wall polymers. Dr Harrington then spent over two years at Murex Medical Research Ltd., Cambridge, developing diagnostic tests for microbial diseases, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and sexually transmitted diseases. This combined monoclonal antibody technology with his knowledge of the microbial cell surface.\n\nIn 1988, he joined Claude Wischik working at the Medical Research Council’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Working in the Cambridge Brain Bank Laboratory over a period of 10 years. During this time, Wischik, Harrington and colleagues developed an assay for screening agents having the potential to prevent the tau pathology that is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Charlie moved with Professor Wischik, in 1998, to the University of Aberdeen, where he was appointed as a Senior Research Fellow.\n\nThe Alzheimer's research was translated to the clinic, through a spin-out company, TauRx Therapeutics, who are conducting phase 3 trials of hydromethylthionine. Dr Harrington is Chief Scientific Officer for TauRx Therapeutics Ltd responsible for the non-clinical activities of the company."
