        "text": "The Lausanne Peace Treaty was signed in 24 July 1923, after the War of Independence. Turkey began to recover quickly; a new country and state structure was born, based on contemporary, democratic, social and secular foundations, which affected fields ranging from education, law, social innovation to politics. However, Turkey was late to begin to modernize, and was unfortunately far behind the political, social and economic developments of the West. Thus, a wideranging effort was made in every field in order to develop economically, and to reach the level of the civilized nations. The struggle, under the leadership of Mustapha Kemal Atatürk, this time was not against a human enemy, but against ignorance and backwardness. This arguably involved a much greater effort than fighting the enemy at the front, as it is undoubtedly very difficult to overcome conventions, prejudices and stereotypes which evolved over centuries. However, Mustapha Kemal Atatürk perfectly understood the Turkish people, their needs and characteristics, and always took these as a starting point for his revolutions. With patience and determination, he was able achieved the modernization of Turkish society through constant revolutions. While trying to realize democracy and national sovereignty in the political field, he also attempted to apply his principles of freedom, justice, equality and respect for human rights in all other fields. Thus, the one-person rule of the Sultan was ended, the sultanate was abolished, and the republic was declared. The new understanding in the political field that put the individual at the centre of the society and led to many long-awaited gains for Turkish women. The idea of the Republic, which considers men and women as equal individuals forming society, had liberated Turkish women in every aspect of art, culture, and economy, social and political life. Undoubtedly, valuable gains were made by the republic in terms of women's rights, building on the innovations brought by the change in mentality of the Tanzimat and Constitutional periods, and education reforms for girls, which had been extremely effective in making cultural and social progress. This study sets out to compare the place of Turkish women in social life during the Ottoman state period with the progress brought by Ataturk's revolutions. Another important purpose of our study is to reveal how the British press perceived this process, and their role in promoting the position of Turkish women in the civilized\n\nThis article attempts to analyze the transnational dimension of a forgotten period of women’s activism in the 1950s. In the historiography of the Turkish women’s movement, these years have been depicted as an era of state feminism, which replaced the first-wave feminist movement represented by the Union of Turkish Women in the mid-1930s and would later be challenged by the second-wave feminism that emerged as a radical and independent movement in the 1980s. It was during the 1950s, however, that a transnational women’s network was revived since the convening of the Twelfth Congress of the International Alliance of Women in Istanbul in 1935. This article unearths the story of the establishment of the Turkish branch of the International Council of Women in the late 1950s and contextualizes this transnational encounter of activist women in a local and international setting, which was both heavily imbued with nationalist and Eurocentric concepts.\n\nThe thesis of “Atatürk as being the only liberator of Turkish women” has long been accepted by the public as an absolute truth, and has not been discussed or criticized. Having been subjected to a critical analysis of Atatürk’s adopted policy, the question of whether this policy was really aimed at the emancipation of women, or whether it was just a tool to advance foreign political and personal interests, becomes debatable. To find answers to these questions and to rediscover historical justice, it is necessary to make a historical excursion from the Tanzimat reforms to the first years of republican Turkey, analyzing the impact of Kemal Atatürk’s policy on the participation of Turkish women in public and political life.\n\nOne of the consequences of the First World War was the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the Allied occupation of Istanbul, leading to the Turkish ‘war of independence’ and ultimately the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923. This process of the birth of the new Turkish nation-state also required the birth of a new Turkish subjectivity, one which fitted with the visions of the new modernising nationalist elite and the search for a break from a ‘backward’ past. The focus of this chapter is on the depiction of this particular image of Turkish womanhood as it appears in The Shirt of Flame (1922), one of the most famous Turkish nationalist novels. The novel gives us a detailed picture of the period between the First World War and the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Thus, analysing a novel such as The Shirt of Flame helps us to develop insights into the Turkish experience of the War of Independence and, in particular, into the role that women were expected to play in the visions of new nationhood. The central argument of this chapter is that Ayșe, the heroine in the novel, is represented as the image of the New Woman and as a symbol of nation through which collective unity among male characters is generated, leading to the emergence of national sentiments in the nascent Turkish Republic."
