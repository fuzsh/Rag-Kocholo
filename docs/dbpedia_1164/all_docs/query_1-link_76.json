        "text": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit star Ice-T has opened up about his thoughts on his record breaking tenure on the show.\n\nThe actor, who plays Sergeant Odafin \"Fin\" Tutuola, has earned the title of longest running male actor in a TV series for his role on the show.\n\nHe joined the show in 2000, and has since appeared in over 400 episodes. Not a small feat in a world where shows get cancelled left and right.\n\nThe actor and rapper spoke to ET Online about this historic feat and what it means to him.\n\nRelated: Mariska Hargitay shares heartfelt tribute to David Graziano\n\n\"Mariska [Hargitay, who plays Captain Olivia Benson on the show] beat me but she’s an actress,\" he said.\n\n\"You've gotta be on the show that stays on the longest – [Law and Order] is the longest-running show, so to get that title you have to be on – it's all consecutive,\" he continued.\n\n\"There are people that have acted way longer than me, but to be on one show continuously for that long – it has never been done,\" he added.\n\nHargitay is the longest running actress on any TV series as she’s been playing Olivia since 1999.\n\nThe rapper also posted a little message alongside a picture of him on Twitter last month when he officially passed the mark, writing: \"Longest running male actor in TV history. Don’t tell me what CANT be done…\"\n\nRelated: Law & Order SVU losing longtime cast member in season 24\n\nMeanwhile, the latest season of Special Victims Unit will serve as a goodbye to longtime cast member Kelli Giddish, who is leaving the show after 12 years.\n\nGiddish, who plays Detective Amanda Rollins, said in a statement: \"Playing Rollins has been one of the greatest joys and privileges of my life. I've been so fortunate to be a part of the Law & Order family for the last 12 years. There is simply no other character on TV like Rollins.\n\n\"I'm so excited to take all the things I have learned in my time on SVU and put them toward everything that's next to come,” she added."
