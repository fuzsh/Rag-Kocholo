Blinken’s sprint across Asia last week — six nations in six days — ended with a neighborly gesture in Mongolia.\n\nDuring a traditional outdoor display of wrestling, archery and equestrianism in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s capital, the prime minister presented Mr. Blinken with a horse.\n\nMr. Blinken named his new companion Frontier, and the prime minister snapped a horse selfie. It appeared to be a sign of the country’s unalloyed bond with the United States, which officials in both countries call a “third neighbor” of Mongolia, an alternative to China and Russia next door."
