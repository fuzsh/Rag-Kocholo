        "text": "01 of 13\n\nLaw & Order episodes ripped from the headlines\n\nThe opening disclaimer of many episodes of the Law & Order franchise reads, \"The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.\" Despite these definitive words, as anyone who has ever marathoned the show knows, many of said stories take direct inspiration from real headlines. Ahead, 12 episodes from Law & Order, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent that referenced major news stories that had everyone talking.\n\n02 of 13\n\nSVU \"Patrimonial Burden\" (Season 17, Episode 7). Inspired by: Josh Duggar's molestation scandal\n\nJosh Duggar's scandal involving his alleged history of molestation inspired a Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode in 2015. Much like Duggar, the character on the episode is the star of a reality show about a large religious family—this time called 13aker's Dozen. The story line also included issues of molestation in the family and the attempt by the parents to handle the problems on their own.\n\n03 of 13\n\nSVU \"Devil's Dissections\" (Season 17, Episode 1). Inspired by: Robert Durst's murder allegations\n\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit opened its 17th season September 2015 by taking inspiration from real estate heir Robert Durst. The episode nodded to the happenings of the hit HBO series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, as the episode's alleged killer confessed to the crime in a bathroom, muttering, \"This is unfortunate. I think I killed that woman and cut her up.\"\n\n04 of 13\n\nSVU \"American Disgrace\" (Season 16, Episode 2). Inspired by: Jay-Z and Solange's elevator fight\n\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit worked in a reference to Solange and Jay-Z's famed 2014 post-Met Ball elevator fight in the beginning of the 16th season. While much of the story line focused on an athlete who had fallen out of favor, the two performers (Henry Simmons and Kelley Missal) were worked in with a scene in which the athlete was seen in an elevator's security footage, being attacked by one of his female associates after wronging her.\n\n05 of 13\n\nSVU \"American Tragedy\" (Season 15, Episode 3). Inspired by: Paula Deen's downfall\n\nIn Law & Order: Special Victims Unit's 15th season, the show combined the events of Trayvon Martin's death with the scandal involving Paula Deen's use of racial slurs.
