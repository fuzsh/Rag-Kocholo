        "text": "LEAGUES CUP 2024\n\nFor the second straight year, Major League Soccer and Liga MX will pause their regular seasons from late July to late August, allowing all 47 first division professional clubs in both leagues to compete in a World Cup-style tournament, officially sanctioned by Concacaf. The competition will see the top three finishers qualify for the Concacaf Champions Cup. Last year, Inter Miami CF won the inaugural edition of the event, while Nashville SC and the Philadelphia Union also earned berths in the Concacaf Champions Cup as part of an MLS sweep.\n\nThe competition began on Friday, July 26, and will feature a total of 77 games hosted at stadiums throughout the United States and Canada, with the final set for Sunday, August 25. Specifically designed to celebrate the rivalry between North America's top clubs, the tournament features a Group Stage made up of two regions (East and West), followed by knockout rounds, beginning with the Round of 32.\n\nGroups consisted of three teams, with regulation wins earning three points. There were no draws in the Group Stage, as games tied after 90 minutes saw both teams awarded one point, with a penalty shootout then deciding which team earned an additional point. The top two teams in each group have advanced to the Round of 32.\n\nFans in more than 100 countries and regions will be able to watch Leagues Cup on MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app.\n\nRECENT FORM VS. NEW YORK CITY FC\n\nThis will be the third meeting between the Revs and New York City FC this campaign as these Eastern Conference rivals have already completed their two-game regular season series, with NYCFC claiming a pair of shutout wins. Agustin Ojeda and Julian Fernandez were the goal scorers in NYCFC's 2-0 win at Yankee Stadium on April 13, while Keaton Parks bagged a late header in a 1-0 win for the visitors on May 25 at Gillette Stadium. New York City FC's sweep comes on the heels of a stalemate last year, as both meetings in 2023 ended in draws, including a 1-1 result in Foxborough.\n\nA third-minute goal from Bobby Wood and a series of stellar saves from AljaÅ¾ IvaÄiÄ helped the Revs to a 1-1 draw with Nashville SC on Tuesday night at Gillette Stadium, and IvaÄiÄ came up big again in the penalty shootout as New England claimed the extra point with a 5-4 victory. That left the Revs on top of East Group 5 in Leagues Cup 2024 with five points, following their 1-0 win over MazatlÃ¡n F.C. in the group stage opener on July 27. Including their 1-1 draw with FC Dallas in the final regular season game before Leagues Cup kicked off, the Revs are now unbeaten (1-0-2) in their last three.\n\nNYCFC, meanwhile, are actually winless in their last six games in all competitions (0-2-4) despite advancing to the Leagues Cup Round of 32. Nick Cushing's side went 0-1-3 in the last four regular season contests before Leagues Cup began, then opened the competition with a penalty shootout win over QuerÃ©taro F.C. following a 0-0 draw at Yankee Stadium. That was enough to see them through as second-place finishers in East Group 1, despite a 4-2 loss to FC Cincinnati in their second group game (after leading 2-0 into the 79th minute).\n\nShould the Revs advance on Friday night, they'd host the winner of the Liga MX showdown between Tigres and Pachuca in the Round of 16 on either August 12 or 13 at Gillette Stadium. Either way, they'll return to MLS action on August 24 when they'll visit CF MontrÃ©al at Stade Saputo.\n\nOverall Record vs. NYCFC: 10-10-7\n\nHome Record vs. NYCFC: 6-3-4\n\nLast meeting at Gillette Stadium: NYCFC 1, Revs 0 (May 25, 2024)\n\nLast meeting at Yankee Stadium: NYCFC 2, Revs 0 (April 13, 2024)"
