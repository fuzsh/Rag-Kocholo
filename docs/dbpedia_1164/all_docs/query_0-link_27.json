        "text": "Rollins made her way to the Manhattan SVU in the Season 13 premiere (\"Scorched Earth\"), but didn't receive the warmest welcome considering her introduction was preceded by the sudden departure of Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nHowever, she instantly got to work proving herself around the precinct, offering invaluable insight during investigations and extending empathy to whatever survivors entered the squad room. Benson and Rollins eventually became dear friends, with Benson even promoting Rollins to Detective 2nd Grade in Season 21.\n\nAs Rollins settled into the SVU beat, she was partnered up with Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) on several cases. Over time, a flirtatious chemistry emerged between the partners, prompting many viewers to question if something was going on between them.\n\nRollins and Amaro's entanglement was revealed in Season 15, Episode 22 (\"Reasonable Doubt\") after Amaro was seen coming out of Rollins' shower wearing nothing but a towel. While Rollins and Amaro slept together, they never got into a serious relationship — especially after Rollins met Sonny Carisi (Peter Scanavino).\n\nRollins's first daughter, Jesse Rollins, was born in Season 17 of SVU after Rollins' romance with then-Lieutenant Declan Murphy (Donal Logue). Murphy disappeared after getting Rollins pregnant, but reappeared in Season 23, Episode 10 (\"Silent Night, Hateful Night\") to admit that he felt guilty for not having an active role in his daughter's life. (Rollins noted it had been six years and he hadn't tried to contact them at all.)\n\nRELATED: The Most Beloved Law & Order Couples from All the Franchises\n\nHer second daughter, Billie Rollins, was born in Season 20 as a result of Rollin's romance with Al Pollack (George Newbern), a doctor who was never particularly faithful. Though he ultimately proposed marriage after Rollins went into labor, she turned him down.\n\nYes, Rollins and Carisi ended up together!\n\nAfter Carisi joined the SVU as a detective in Season 17, he became close friends with Rollins. Then, after the two became partners, they eventually veered into will-they-won't-they territory. Thereafter, anyone who laid eyes on Rollins and Carisi assumed they were dating, from family members to random onlookers.\n\nCarisi was Rollins' biggest shoulder to lean on during her two pregnancies, attending doctor visits with Rollins and generally stepping up to the plate after Rollins' exes failed to do so.\n\nRELATED: All the Details From Rollins and Carisi's Marriage Ceremony on SVU\n\nTheir relationship became complicated after he left the SVU to become an assistant district attorney, leaving Rollins without a partner and making her realize how much she valued having him around. She later visited him at the D.A. office and admitted she missed him and, soon enough, Carisi admitted his deeper feelings for Rollins.\n\nIn the Season 22 finale, Carisi and Rollins shared the first kiss of many to come.\n\nBy the Season 23 premiere (“And the Empire Strikes Back”), Rollins and Carisi were a couple, though they kept it on the down low out of a concern for how it might affect their shared workplace. After breaking the good news to their colleagues, though, \"Rollisi\" started to soar.\n\nThe couple got married in Season 24, Episode 9 (\"And a Trauma in a Pear Tree\") in a courthouse ceremony surrounded by their SVU loved ones.\n\nRollins was shot in the line of duty twice: once in Season 14, when she was shot by a sniper in front of the precinct; and once in Season 24, when she was monitoring a key witness at a safe house and the two were attacked by a group of gunmen.\n\nRELATED: See Kelli Giddish on SVU as a Different Character 4 Years Before She Played Rollins\n\nThankfully, Rollins woke up in the hospital after the second time to find Carisi standing at her bedside for support. They held hands and smiled at each other with relief — but Rollins was rocked by the event.\n\nRollins left the show in Season 24.\n\nHer journey to the end of her tenure started when she began substitute teaching criminology classes at Fordham University at Carisi's recommendation After after the trauma of the safe house shooting, teaching significantly improved Rollins' mood. Benson took note of Rollins' chipper demeanor, leading to a heartfelt catch-up between the two friends.\n\n“I’m in a good place,” Rollins told Benson. “Figuring things out.\"\n\nBenson smiled. “Whatever you’re doing, keep doing that,\" she said.\n\nAs expected, Carisi informed Rollins that she was being offered a full-time teaching position at Fordham and she accepted the job.\n\nRollins officially resigned from her post at the Manhattan SVU in Season 24, Episode 9 (\"And a Trauma in a Pear Tree), shortly after her surprise wedding with Carisi. She told Benson she was resigning during a girl's night of drunken confessions, much to Benson's dismay.\n\nHaving become close friends and confidantes after 12 years, Rollins's departure was hard for both women to process. Eventually, Benson realized that leaving the precinct was the best for Rollins, who assured her friend that nothing would change between them.\n\nRollins has returned to the Law & Order fold on several occasions since her emotional SVU exit.\n\nHer first post-departure episode came during Law & Order: Organized Crime in Season 3, Episode 21, (\"Shadowërk\") to help Detective Stabler on a high-stakes case. Though she had been killing it as a professor at Fordham, she admitted to Stabler that she'd missed the thrill of a good mystery.\n\nRELATED: Kelli Giddish is Back with the Entire SVU Cast in New Selfie After Her Return to Set\n\nRollins got to enjoy the thrill of the chase again in SVU's Season 25 premiere (\"Tunnel Blind\"). After celebrating the birth of her newborn boy, Benson asked her for an assist on a case. Rollins predictably dished some of the most valuable intel Benson had heard, proving yet again that Rollins is a rock star when it comes to understanding criminal behavior.\n\nFans got a major Rollins update in Season 25, Episode 11 (\"Prima Nocta\") after it was revealed that she'd turned down a 10-year contract and quit her teaching job at Fordham.\n\nRollins had grown bored as a professor and missed the adrenaline rush of the SVU.\n\nBenson called her up for help on a runaway bride case shortly after she left, and Rollins was re-certified as an NYPD cop, leading viewers (and Benson) to wonder if she wished to return to the squad room.\n\nAfter Benson returned the prized taxidermy squirrel that had lived on her squad desk for years, Rollins admitted she was still working on figuring out her purpose outside of the SVU."
