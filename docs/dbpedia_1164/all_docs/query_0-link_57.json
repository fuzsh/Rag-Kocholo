        "text": "Historical and Revision Notes\n\n1956 Act\n\nRevised section\n\nSource (U.S. Code)\n\nSource (Statutes at Large)\n\nThe definitions in clauses (3), (15), (18)–(21), (23)–(30), and (31)–(33) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. A choice has been made where established uses conflict.\n\nIn clause (2), the definition of “Territory” in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone.\n\nIn clause (4), the definition of “armed forces” is based on the source statute instead of 50:551(2), which does not include an express reference to the Marine Corps. The words “including all components thereof” are omitted as surplusage.\n\nIn clause (5), the term “Department” is defined to give it the broad sense of “Establishment”, to conform to the source statute and the usage preferred by the Department of Defense, instead of the more limited sense defined by 5:421g(a) and 423a(a), and 10:1a(d) and 1801(d).\n\nIn clause (6), the term “executive part of the department” is created for convenience in referring to what is described in the source statutes for this title as “department” in the limited sense of the executive part at the seat of government. This is required by the adoption of the word “department” in clause (5) to cover the broader concept of “establishment”.\n\nIn clause (8), the term “Secretary concerned” is created and defined for legislative convenience.\n\nIn clause (9), a definition of “National Guard” is inserted for clarity.\n\nIn clause (10)(A), the words “a land force” are substituted for 32:2 (as applicable to Army National Guard). The National Defense Act of 1916, § 117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the Act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, § 3, 43 Stat. 1081.\n\nIn clauses (10) and (11), the word “Army” is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.\n\nIn clauses (10) and (12), the words “unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires” and “as provided in this title”, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.\n\nIn clauses (10)(B) and (12)(B), the words “has its officers appointed” are substituted for the word “officered”, in 32:4b.\n\nIn clauses (11) and (13), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.\n\nIn clause (12)(A), the words “an air force” are substituted for the words “for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law”, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (as applicable to Air National Guard), to make the definition of “Air National Guard” parallel with the definition of “Army National Guard”, and to make explicit the intent of Congress, in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.\n\nIn clause (14), the definition of “officer” is based on the source statutes instead of 50:551(5), which excludes warrant officers. The reference to appointment in 10:1a(b) (2d sentence and 10:1801(b) (2d sentence), and the words “commissioned warrant officer”, “flight officer”, and “either permanent or temporary”, in 37:231(c) (1st sentence), are omitted as surplusage. 5:181–3(b) (1st sentence), 10:1a(b) (1st sentence), and 10:1801(b) (1st sentence) are omitted as covered by the definitions in clauses (14) and (16) of the revised section and by section 3062(c) and section 8062(d) of this title.\n\nIn clause (16), the words “unless otherwise qualified”, “permanent or temporary”, and “in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, including any component thereof” are omitted as surplusage. The word “person” is substituted for the word “officer”.\n\nIn clause (22), the definition of “active duty” is based on the definition of “active Federal service” in the source statute, since it is believed to be closer to general usage than the definition in 50:901(b), which excludes active duty for training from the general concept of active duty.\n\n1958 Act\n\nRevised section\n\nSource (U.S. Code)\n\nSource (Statutes at Large)\n\n101(25)\n\n50:1181(6).\n\nSept. 3, 1954, ch. 1257, § 102(6), 68 Stat. 1150.\n\nThe words “, other than a commissioned warrant officer,” are inserted to reflect 50:1181(1).\n\n[Clause (35).] The word “original” is defined to make clear that when used in relation to an appointment it refers to the member’s first appointment in his current series of appointments and excludes any appointment made before a lapse in service.\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nReferences in Text\n\nSection 125(d) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(12)(A), was repealed by Pub. L. 99–433, title III, § 301(b)(1), , 100 Stat. 1022.\n\nThe Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, referred to in subsec.
