What has Mehcad Brooks been in before 'Law & Order'?

TV viewers will most likely recognize the 41-year-old from The CW's Supergirl, in which he played the title character's friend, co-worker, and potential love interest, James Olsen. Mehcad was a series regular for the first four seasons and part of Supergirl Season 5, though he returned as a guest star in Season 6.

His film credits include playing Jax in the 2021 reboot of Mortal Kombat and starring as basketball icon Harry Flournoy in Disney's Glory Road.

Mehcad's breakout role came in 2005 when he played Matthew Applewhite in ABC's primetime soap Desperate Housewives, first as a guest star in Season 1 and then as a regular in Season 2.

While he hasn't led a crime drama before, he has appeared in a few. The actor guest-starred in episodes of Cold Case and K-Ville, and like many Law & Order actors, has a past with the Wolf Entertainment brand.

Who is Mehcad Brooks playing on 'Law & Order'?

While NBC confirmed that Mehcad is joining Law & Order, the network didn't release any information about his character. It's possible that details about his new role haven't been finalized yet and audiences will learn about the character closer to the season's fall 2022 premiere date.

What audiences do know is that Mehcad's hero will be the new partner for Frank Cosgrove, the prickly cop played by Jeffrey Donovan. Will he be able to balance out Frank's already legendary temper?

Law & Order likes to play different characters off one another, so it's likely that Mehcad's protagonist will be as different from Frank as one could possibly get. He might be more introspective, less confrontational or the new guy around the precinct, to go along with the new actor on the show.

Whoever Mehcad's character turns out to be, he's an excellent choice to follow in Anthony's footsteps and will give crime drama fans a big reason to tune into Season 22 this fall.
