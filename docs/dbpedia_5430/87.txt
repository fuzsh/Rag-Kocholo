The former James Bond has joined the cast of the upcoming Taylor Sheridan series.

Timothy Dalton, the renowned British actor who has played everything from a suave Nazi spy in The Rocketeer to a cold-blooded James Bond in The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill, has signed on to play a key role in 1923, Taylor Sheridan’s latest Yellowstone prequel series.

According to published reports, Dalton will portray Donald Whitfield, a character described as a powerful, self-confident man who reeks of wealth and the lack of empathy it requires to attain it. He is intimidating and nefarious and is used to getting what he wants.

1923 — which, of course, is a sequel to 1883 — stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as Jacob and Cara Dutton, owners of the Yellowstone ranch during an eventful period in American history.

According to Paramount, the series will “introduce a new generation of the Dutton family and explore the early 20th Century when pandemics, historic drought, the end of Prohibition, and the Great Depression all plague the mountain west, and the Duttons who call it home.”

Other cast members previously announced include James Badge Dale (13 Hours) as John Dutton Sr., Jacob’s oldest nephew and right-hand man; Robert Patrick (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) as Sheriff William McDowell, a friend of the Dutton family; and Brian Geraghty (Chicago P.D.) as Zane, a fiercely loyal ranch foreman.

1923 is currently filming on location in Montana, and will premiere on Paramount+ in December.
