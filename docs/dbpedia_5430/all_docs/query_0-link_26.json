        "text": "Landmarks in Club History\n\n1. The Commonwealth Club makes its debut in 1903, dedicating its work to promoting civic awareness and the common good\n\n2. The Club grows, taking on the concerns of the times: child labor (1906); Native American rights (1909); air pollution (1913); banking laws (1908); juror selection (1920), and more\n\n3. In 1932, The Commonwealth Club hosts one of Franklin Roosevelt’s “New Deal” speeches\n\n4. Home to the headquarters of the International Longshore Workers’ Union in 1934, the Club’s Embarcadero site becomes known for labor protests that eventually lead to advancements in worker rights\n\n5. June 11, 1931: Club President James A. Johnston announces the creation of the California Book Awards—a program that now receives more than 400 submissions a year\n\n6. Literary historians credit the Club’s Book Awards as among the first to recognize a young John Steinbeck, awarding him three Gold Medals between 1935 and 1939…and becoming embroiled in controversy for recommending The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck’s gritty epic of the Great Depression\n\n7. Herbert Hoover gives four formal speeches on the record and nine “off-the-record” question-and-answer sessions at Club dinner meetings between 1936 and 1947\n\n8. Civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King speaks at the Club in 1967\n\n9. The Club hosts former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in 1967, and again in 1968\n\n10. Women are finally permitted to join as Club members in 1971\n\n11. First Lady Rosalynn Carter speaks twice at the Club in the 1970s and again in 2010\n\n12.

In the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s, Club events are hosted as luncheons at San Francisco’s Palace Hotel; live radio coverage keeps hosts and guests on their toes!\n\n15. Until the 1980s, yearly Club membership rosters are printed, listing each member’s name, occupation, and city of residence\n\n16. See into the past! View a 1928 motion picture (silent, 8:36) of Club founder Edward Adams among his prized flowers; Earl A. Walcott, “watch dog of expenditures,” at work; and the gentlemen of the Luncheon Committee here\n\nFirsts and Foremosts\n\n17. Dedicated to presenting points of view from across the political spectrum, The Commonwealth Club is the only place in the Bay Area where you can hear from a liberal one night and a conservative the next!\n\n18. The Club’s Distinguished Citizen Award Gala begins in 1989, honoring more than 100 individuals to date\n\n19.

Dr. Lauren Silver, the Club’s first-ever Education Director, comes onboard in December 2019 to develop positive civics content for the K–12 teaching community\n\n28. Published continuously for more than 80 years, the Club’s award-winning magazine goes virtual: The Commonwealth Unbound features 116 pages filled with politics, arts, history, technology, and more; before the magazine, the Club published a newsletter\n\nClub Programs: Climate One\n\n36.
