        "text": "I'm with you, OP. I've mentioned this before, but when I was 12, my dad took me to see The Living Daylights and we agreed later that he was a good Bond and should have received more acclaim for it. Dalton and my dad kinda favor each other, too, so that's additionally amusing.\n\nWell boys (I'm not Mae)- he asked me out years ago- if my memory serves me right about 1981/2 when I worked in Andre Oliver on East 57th St. I can tell you he was (is) a classy guy, and was handsome, hot with a fabulous body- that is as much as I will tell you. So he is at least bisexual. I assumed at the time- gay. I expect the troll who \"trolls\" me on DL when I post these things will chime in.\n\nHe wouldn't know it was you. He's not even, like, on this site, probably. He probably has like ED, or something.\n\nWhy would you not let us live vicariously? Show us the buffet and shoo us away. Mmm hmm, just don't.\n\nR45, actually, there is speculation. Says Wikipedia:\n\n[quote]In the historiography of the second half of the 20th century, much interest was shown in Richard's sexuality, in particular whether there was evidence of homosexuality. The topic had not been raised by Victorian or Edwardian historians, a fact which was itself denounced as a \"conspiracy of silence\" by John Harvey (1948). The argument primarily drew on accounts of Richard's behaviour, as well as of his confessions and penitences, and of his childless marriage. Richard did have at least one illegitimate child (Philip of Cognac), and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns. Historians remain divided on the question of Richard's sexuality. Harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians, most notably John Gillingham (1994), who argues that Richard was probably heterosexual. Flori (1999) again argued in favour of Richard's homosexuality, based on Richard's two public confessions and penitences (in 1191 and 1195) which, according to Flori, \"must have\" referred to the sin of sodomy. Flori, however, concedes that contemporary accounts of Richard taking women by force exist, concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women. Flori and Gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bed-sharing do not support the suggestion that Richard had a sexual relationship with King Philip II, as had been suggested by other modern authors.\n\nSometimes I will give details on something I know about- not this. He is very much alive. I'm not in the habit of giving details on anyone I have dated or been involved with to anyone by my very closest friends who I trust. I think I speak for most in that respect. There are a number of celebrities that I know are gay or bisexual from first person experience. That is as far as I will ever go if they are still alive.\n\n\"I remembered no gay moment with Anthony Hopkins in Lion in Winter.\n\nI remembered it as being painful with drunken O'Toole shouting a lot and Nantucket Kate like a shag on a rock and not even pretending to be Spanish.\"\n\nR19 - Go watch the movie as IT IS THERE!\n\n\"I remembered no gay moment with Anthony Hopkins in Lion in Winter.\n\nI remembered it as being painful with drunken O'Toole shouting a lot and Nantucket Kate like a shag on a rock and not even pretending to be Spanish.\"\n\nKate was playing Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine. She was quite French.\n\nYou are thinking of the wife of Richard I, Berengaria of Navarre. She spoke Spanish.\n\nThe photo at OP's link is from the 1970 version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS, with Dalton as Heathcliff and Anna Calder-Marshall as Cathy. The first half of it is quite good (the latter half feels rushed, like the film had been trimmed by the studio). Both leads are fine, and Calder-Marshall is a big improvement over the prissy Merle Oberon.\n\nI can't figure him out. Thought I had till he had that baby at age 50 or whatever with the Russian person - he went home to Russia with her and some magazine/newspaper did a story about it.\n\nAnyhow, I understood why he'd be with Vanessa Redgrave - I mean, duh, the help for his career... And he must have put out for her because why would Redgrave bother to be a beard for a much lesser actor just for the bloody hell of it - though she was married to Tony Richardson and had two daughters with him so maybe some women just specialize in mating with gay men.\n\nBut like I said, a kid, at 50, with a Russian whore or whatever... Huh? At that point in your life, what's the point?"
