        "text": "Tag: Timothy Dalton\n\nThe Captain(s) of My Heart\n\nMy co-host for You Knew My Name: The Bond Not Bond Blogathon, the lovely Gill, nominated me for the Pick A Movie Tag. She invited me to write about my top five “hotties” wink, wink, and because I have a charitable heart and am not at all a person who enjoys talking about how handsome… Continue reading The Captain(s) of My Heart\n\nBlack Panther: Timothy Dalton in Charlie’s Angels\n\nAh Charlie’s Angels. The epitome of what was termed “jiggle TV” in the late 70s and early 80s. I think you can understand why it was given that rather dubious term if you think hard enough. But in my opinion, and for many women who watched the film at the time of its airing, it… Continue reading Black Panther: Timothy Dalton in Charlie’s Angels\n\nJane, Jane: Timothy Dalton in Jane Eyre (1983)\n\nThe Brontë Sisters are incredibly famous. I don’t think this point can be overstated. Their contribution to the English literary canon, especially Gothic literature, has influenced countless authors, filmmakers and musicians (I’m looking at you, Kate Bush.) They revolutionised a genre that had been seen as low brow, melodramatic trash for almost a century, and… Continue reading Jane, Jane: Timothy Dalton in Jane Eyre (1983)\n\nThe Man Who Loved the Lady with the Lamp: Timothy Dalton in “Florence Nightingale” (1985)\n\nOkay so Florence Nightingale is probably the most famous nurse to ever live, with good reason, as she pretty much revolutionised the field by introducing sanitation measures (seriously, wash your hands) in hospitals, and establishing the first secular nursing school in the world. A famous lithograph of Nightingale from a painting by Henrietta Rae. So,… Continue reading The Man Who Loved the Lady with the Lamp: Timothy Dalton in “Florence Nightingale” (1985)\n\nAnnouncing the You Knew My Name: The Bond Not Bond Blogathon\n\nYou knew his name. So It's been a while since I blogged. Life happens. But when one of my favourite bloggers, Gill from Realweegiemidget Reviews approached me about co-hosting a Blogathon dedicated to the six official Bond actors' non-Bond films, I knew that it was time to get back on the blogging wagon! I have… Continue reading Announcing the You Knew My Name: The Bond Not Bond Blogathon\n\nThe Art of Vengeance: A Love Letter to “Licence To Kill” (1989)\n\nLicence To Kill (1989) has suffered from a bad reputation for years. Many have wrongly asserted that it bombed at the box office and that the film was critically panned. While the film did not perform as strongly in the US as past entries, the film still earned $156 million dollars at the box office,… Continue reading The Art of Vengeance: A Love Letter to “Licence To Kill” (1989)\n\nPutting on the Hits\n\nSextette (1978) is based on Mae West's 1961 play of the same name, which was also her last stage performance. At the time of the film’s release, Mae was eight five years old, although for her entire professional career Mae had claimed she was seven years younger than she actually was; so there have been… Continue reading Putting on the Hits"
