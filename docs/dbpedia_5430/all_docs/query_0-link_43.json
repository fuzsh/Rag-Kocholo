        "text": "I guarantee there will be some people on this list who you didn’t know were Welsh actors. The small nation of Wales is known for being the land of song, but its inhabitants are also brilliant entertainers. There are so many Welsh actors who have made it big in Hollywood.\n\nFamous Welsh Actors\n\nThey are often categorised as a British actor. Boo! There are many famous people born in Wales. You don’t need to be a film critic or an expert in Welsh film or British film to know these famous people from Wales. Whether they are still living in the land of their fathers, the United Kingdom, New York, LA or London, here’s a list of Welsh actors.\n\nFamous actors born in Wales\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nSir Phillip Anthony Hopkins is the most decorated entry, and probably one of the most famous people of Wales. Anthony Hopkins grew up in Margam in Port Talbot and like many entrants on the list studied at the Welsh College of Music and Drama. He’s probably best known for playing Hannibal Lecter. Plus, his performance alongside Sean Connery in A Bridge Too Far. He has not let the fame get to his head, he keeps a photograph of his 10-year-old self on his mobile phone as a token of just how far he’s come since his childhood.\n\nChristian Bale\n\nArguably, Bale coined the phrase “I’m Batman!” in current pop culture. He was born in Haverfordwest, to English parents, and spent his childhood there. In an interview when promoting American Physco in 2000 he was asked; Is the drinking part of your Welsh heritage? He responded with, “I was born in Wales but I’m not Welsh – I’m English.” Mate, that still makes you Welsh! You would have experienced the people and cultures. The people of Wales are passionate, especially about their homeland, so with this one sentence, he has made a nation of enemies.\n\nJonathan Pryce\n\nTo modern audiences, he is known as Keira Knightley’s dad from Pirates of the Caribbean, and the High Sparrow from Game of Thrones. Jonathan Pryce was born and raised in Carmel, Flintshire. He told The Guardian “…I left home when I was 18,” he shrugs. “I’ve got fond memories of home and I’ve got negative memories of home. I don’t really get back there as much as I should.”\n\nIan Whyte\n\nStanding at a towering 7 foot 1 inches, Ian Whyte is an actor, stuntman and former professional basketball player from Bangor. He has starred in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Rogue One and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He is probably best known for various roles in Game of Thrones, including White Walkers and a giant in the opening episode of season 3. For these roles, he was unrecognisable under make-up and computer effects. In season 2, he also had a speaking role as Ser Gregor Clegane.\n\nMichael Sheen\n\nWelsh actor Michael Christopher Sheen OBE was born in Newport but is known from being from Port Talbot. He has a great acting CV, but American audiences will know him for The Twilight Saga and Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris. More recently he’s starred alongside David Tennent in the Amazon series Good Omens.\n\nSheen is from a theatrical family, and his father even worked as a Jack Nicholson lookalike. He was involved with the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and, later, the National Youth Theatre of Wales before moving to London to train at RADA.\n\nMichael Sheen and Welsh actress Catherine Zeta Jones (who married Michael Douglas) are often connected together. Both are the same age, grew up in the same town, attended the same drama school and their parents are friendly. However, they didn’t meet until working together on Fox’s Prodigal Son.\n\nSheen was also highly praised for directing and starring in a reading of Dylan Thomas Under Milk Wood at New York’s 92nd Street – the same stage where the work premiered in 1953.\n\nRhys Ifans\n\nRhys Owain Evans is from Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire but grew up in Denbighshire. His stage name is Rhys Ifans and he is known for several Hollywood movie roles. He has been in The Amazing Spider-Man, Harry Potter as Xenophilius Lovegood, The 51st State and Notting Hill. American audiences will also know him from starring in Neverland, Elementary, and Berlin Station.\n\nHe attended acting classes at Theatr Clwyd. Ifans studied acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he graduated in 1997. After leaving school presented Welsh-language television programmes on S4C, including narrating Sali Mali.\n\nKeith Allen\n\nIt may surprise you that Keith Allen is a Welsh actor. Keith Howell Charles Allen is one of the famous people from Llanelli. He is an actor and television presenter. He is the father of singer Lily Allen and actor Alfie Allen. As his father was a Royal Navy Submariner, at age 11 he was sent to Brentwood boarding school in Essex. He was expelled from the school at the age of 13 and at 15 he was sent to a Borstal (a youth detention centre) after repeatedly being caught stealing. He has recently starred in The Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Eddie the Eagle and Agent Cody Banks 2.\n\nLuke Evans\n\nPontypool born Luke Evans is an actor and singer and was brought up in Aberbargoed, before moving to Cardiff. He began his career on the West End before his breakthrough film, Clash of the Titans. Since then he has gone on to star in the Fast and the Furious franchise, Girl on the Train, The Hobbit, Wonder Woman and Disney’s Beauty and the Beast. He is always in the top 10 Welsh actors and hot Welsh actors lists.\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies\n\nInstantly recognisable, John Rhys Davies is a Hollywood star with Welsh blood running in his veins. He has been working in film and TV since the 1970s. He is known for his role as Gimli in Lord of the Rings – as well as voicing Tree Beard – and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. My personal favourite is the irritable Viscount Mabrey in the Princess Diaries 2: A Royal Engagement.\n\nHe was brought up in Ammanford in Carmarthenshire. In 2013 he took part in the BBC Wales programme, Coming Home, which is very similar to Who Do You Think You Are but concentrates on Welsh roots. He said; “I’m very proud of being a Welshman, I’m very proud of my Welsh heritage and yet these days I feel we do not treasure the past quite as much as we should.”\n\nPeter Wingfield\n\nOriginally from Cardiff, Peter Wingfield has appeared in Smallville, NCIS, Stargate-SG1 and CSI. Here in the UK, he is best known for his roles in Holby City and Highlander. Since 2011, he has significantly reduced his acting and has been concentrating on a medical career. As of September 2020, he is an Anaesthesiologist at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles CA.\n\nFREE Visit Cardiff Checklist & Guide\n\nGet your FREE Visting Cardiff Checklist and Guide with over 25 pages full of travel tips, how to get around, places to visit, food and drink, shopping, parks and green spaces, some Welsh phrases and a travel itinerary.\n\nMatthew Rhys\n\nThe Welsh Hollywood actor Matthew Rhys was born in Cardiff.

He has also appeared in Flash Gordon, Hot Fuzz and The Tourist, and even voiced the character Mr Pricklepants in Toy Story 3. Timothy was born in Colwyn Bay in Denbighshire.\n\nIn an interview with Great British Life, he said, “The truth is I was born in Colwyn Bay because my parents happened to be there at the time.

He has also had roles in Clint Eastwood’s Invictus, The Head Hunter and Zero Dark Thirty, and the Showtime television series The Tudors. Julian Lewis-Jones is from Anglesey and trained at the Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff.\n\nHis roots are still humble, and the way he found out he would be working with Clint Eastwood is a moment Julian will never forget, “I was in the car going to Llandeilo to get fruit and veg and my wife was driving as I was a bit hungover, having watched Wales beat Scotland in the Six Nations a day earlier. My phone went and it was my agent saying they had picked me. It cured my hangover straight away!”\n\nAndrew Howard\n\nAnother Cardiffian on the Welsh actor list is Andrew Howard, who is known for roles in Guy Ritchie’s Revolver alongside Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close.

He decides to help a homicide detective find the murderers so that they can be punished. (It is hilarious, I love it!)\n\nTom grew up in Cardiff, and often Tweets about being Welsh. In an interview with The Big Issue he said; “My twin sister and I were born in Cardiff at the University of Wales hospital, and word got out that these enormous twins were being born – we were basically the heaviest newborn twins on record in South Wales at that time. So there were about 25 medical students surrounding my mum’s nether regions when I popped out. I came out to an audience. And that’s where it (acting) all started.”\n\nTom Cullen\n\nThomas Cullen was born in Aberystwyth and spent his early years in Llandrindod Wells.

Plus BAFTAs, Tony Awards and a Golden Globe.\n\nRichard Burton was from Pontrhydyfen a small coal-mining village in the Afan Valley. His second marriage to Elizabeth Taylor made them Hollywood royalty. They starred on screen together in Cleopatra and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Liz even learnt the Welsh word ‘Cwtch’ from Richard, and used it publicly. Their personal life was often splashed over the tabloids, and he often tops the list of Welsh celebrities.\n\nBecoming Burton Exhibition\n\nI recently visited the Becoming Burton Exhibition at the National Museum of Wales.
