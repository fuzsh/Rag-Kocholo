        "text": "The 24th Bond film Spectre is in theatres and Daniel Craig is the current working James Bond. As we know that James Bond film series is a spy film series based on the fictional character of MI6 agent James Bond 007, being the longest running film series right from 1962 – till date. Also following are the number of actors who successfully carried the 007 brand to their name:\n\nSean Connery\n\nSean Connery was a nameless face before coming as James Bond in 1962 film Dr. No and then the film series of Bond films flung him to stardom. Connery was further seen as an established James Bond in films, From Russia With Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and the last one Diamonds Are Forever (1971).\n\nWoody Allen\n\nWoody Allen played the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale, based on Ian Fleming’s first James Bond novel with the same name. The film seldom matched other Bond films in any sense and was anticipated to be the critical spy spoof.\n\nGeorge Lazenby\n\nWhen Connery exited the Bond series franchise due to his fear of being typecast, George Lazenby covertly marked his entry in the opening scene of the film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969). However, he only appeared in one Bond film.\n\nRoger Moore\n\nRoger Moore brilliantly played the character of James Bond in the next Bond film Live And Let Die (1973). Moore further added a number of feathers in his Bond hat by doing The Man With The Golden Gun (1974), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983) and finally A View To A kill (1985). By this time Roger really began to reflect his age and then entered the next James Bond.\n\nTimothy Dalton\n\nThe character of James Bond now reprised into the handsome hunk Timothy Dalton, who awesomely gave his debut performance in The Living Daylights (1987). The more pragmatic Timothy was seen in the next Bond film Licence To Kill (1989) but failed to match the expectations of the audiences. And then Pierce Brosnan got his shot to play in the next James Bond flick.\n\nPierce Brosnan\n\nBrosnan made his appearance in Goldeneye (1995) and the film grossed over $350 million across the globe. After the huge hit of his former film, Brosnan next appeared in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002).\n\nDaniel Craig\n\nAfter Brosnan, franchise was looking for another Bond face for a whole new generation of fans. And Daniel Craig came into the picture who first appeared in Casino Royale (2006). He next featured in A Quantum Of Solace (2008) as a bitter Bond looking to take vengeance for the loss of the woman he loved. Craig continued his Bond journey in the next film Skyfall (2012) and then the latest released Spectre (2015).\n\nRecommended Read: http://filmynuts.blogspot.com/2015/11/top-5-reasons-to-watch-james-bonds-spectre.html"
