        "text": "@ClarkDevlin Good points though I guess we're moving a little further away from the plot topic. Rem Steele was way goofy and Brosnan likely benefitted from the time away from the character to establish himself as Bond. And I think you're right on Dalton giving AVTAK a bit more intensity early in the film. Zorin would have wrought psychological havoc on Dalton's Bond whereas Moore seems to take the blows like a seasoned pro.\n\nGet the feeling a '91 Dalton would have looked like Lethal Weapon 2 or one of those bad Van Damme movies. Would have liked to see he and Glen carry the franchise into the new decade, but the idea holds a lot less appeal to me than what Lazenby could have done 20 years earlier.\n\nIt depends on which draft of Bond 17 you're talking about. During pre-production of Bond 17 the story changed drastically with almost every draft.\n\nThe first draft had Sir Henry Lee Ching as the villain, with locations including Hong Kong, China, Japan, London and Scotland. Main plot points included an explosion in the Nanking Atomic Plant, a car chase between the DB5 and Rodin's car, a fight with the Kohoni brothers and the ending taking place beneath the sewers of Hong Kong.\n\nThe second draft had General Han and Sir Henry Furguson as the villains, with locations including Vanouver, Vegas, China, Hong Kong and Libya. Main plot points included a fight with a robot programmed by Colonel Al-Sabra of the LSSP, Aston Martin DB5 vs monster truck chase in Vegas, a fight with female body builders and a finale taking place inside the Hoover Dam. (Felt a lot like GE with TND mixed in)\n\nThe third draft (I don't know much about) had 006 (not name Alec) as a rogue agent. Similar to Goldeneye but with similar jokes to those in True Lies\n\nThe final draft would be Goldeneye as we know it in 1995.\n\nIf the first draft had been made (obviously with a bit of tweaking here and there) I think it would be one of the best of all the films and I would definitely prefer it to a Lazenby Diamonds are Forever. In fact, if I'm honest, I would have preferred Connery in OHMSS.\n\nDalton in a third Bond film would have been tremendous. If Dalton had come back for a third film in 1991, I suspect it would have been something akin to the first draft of Bond 17 which sounds great to me, and if he had done a third he probably would have gone on to do a fourth as well in 1993 which probably would have been GE. Now that sounds like a winning collection of Bond films.\n\nAs for Lazenby in DAF, although DAF is disappointing, I don't think they could have turned it into a revenge story. They had already messed up the Blofeld arc from the novels so it makes sense for them to just take it in a new direction. And even if they had found a way to make it work it seems unlikely the inexperienced Lazenby would have been able to handle the deeper emotions such a film would throw at him. I'd much rather have seen Connery in OHMSS.\n\nAnother one from Dalton. He might not have been the most charismatic Bond, but he sure as hell is a much better actor than Lazenby was. Also, if Lazenby had continued, I have a feeling that it would've killed the franchise.\n\nAnd yet Lazenby was the actor that was nominated for a Golden Globe after his performance in \"Majesty's\". No offence, but I think I'd rather take the recommendations of the 93 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association over your opinion, @Eyes.\n\nWell, of course, that's just my opinion. Nominations don't really relate to my point, though, and in fairness, Lazenby had issues with his colleagues (or his colleagues had issues with him) that Dalton didn't have.\n\nEDIT: He was voted for \"most promising newcomer\", and I agree - he's pretty promising for his lack of acting experience. I just don't think he would've taken the franchise in a sustainable and enduring direction, and how many nominations he received isn't really relevant to that. But again, this is just my opinion, and I'm not going to be upset over differences in opinion.\n\nThat could be it of course. Maybe Hunt was jealous.\n\nAccording to The Laz, he upset Hunt's entourage of gay friends on set, when he was asked by other members of the production crew to clear the sound stage of Hunt's friends larking around when they wanted to set-up the next shot. Lazenby admits his mistake, and everything had to be relayed via the Assistant Director after then. Also, with the exception of Tracy's death scene, Lazenby was mostly only ever given one take.... I will repeat that again... ONE TAKE to get a scene right!\n\nLazenby: \"Peter Hunt got me the job. If it wasn’t for him wanting to use me as James Bond, I wouldn’t have been there. But then we got on the set. Peter is gay as gay can be and I had no idea. I wasn’t sophisticated enough at the time, but there was a bunch of gay guys who were friends of Peter’s running around the set. Someone told me to clear the set and I said “How do I do that?” They said “Just pick up the speaker over there and say that you want the set cleared and if anybody’s not working on the scene to get of the set.” I did that and all these guys that were Peter’s friends had to leave. They told Peter that I had thrown them off the set, but I had no idea what I was doing. I was just doing the crew a favour. But Peter wouldn’t talk to me through the whole movie. He never spoke one word to me. I did that whole movie without speaking one word to the director after that day, and that was the second day on the set.\""
