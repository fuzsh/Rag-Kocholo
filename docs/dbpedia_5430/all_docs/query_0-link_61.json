        "text": "The University of Scranton’s ongoing efforts to support and welcome refugee communities in Scranton continued this fall semester, including providing and partnering on informational programming in relation to housing and health topics and in ways that offer connections to the refugee communities that now call Scranton home.\n\nProfessor of Physical Therapy, Dr. Lori Walton, Ph.D., DPT, MScPT, MPH(s), and her students in PT743 Psychosocial Aspects of Disability in Physical Therapy undertook a semester-long Community-Based Learning (CBL) project to provide health workshops to the Bhutanese refugee community in Scranton. Before engaging in this project, Dr. Walton first provided several training sessions for the students on how to improve access to care and health equity; appropriate, effective, and equitable work with culturally diverse populations and language translators; and working with newly resettled Americans with hearing and visual impairment.\n\nDr. Walton’s students also learned more about local resources and vulnerable populations, as well as the historical background of the Bhutanese refugee community, with class visits from Julie Schumacher Cohen, AVP for Community Engagement and Government Affairs and CBL Board Chair and Mr. Chandra Sitaula, from the Bhutanese Cultural Foundation of Scranton Association. Mr. Sitaula spoke with students in preparation for their presentations at the Bhutanese Cultural Community Center in South Scranton, particularly focusing on culturally appropriate communication. Mr. Sitaula and the Bhutanese community collaborated with Dr. Walton and her students to identify mutually agreed upon topics that aligned with the course information and student expertise and that would also be valuable to the Bhutanese community members in Scranton.\n\n\"We are so honored to have the opportunity to work with Mr. Chandra Sitaula at the Bhutanese Community Center to develop a partnership for promoting health and wellness in the community. Working together to help one another, embracing diverse human interaction and dialogue, and getting to know our neighbors in the Scranton Community was an honor that we continue to cherish with deep gratitude. This community-based experience with the Bhutanese Community was truly transformational for both faculty and students!\" said Dr. Lori Walton, Ph.D., DPT, MScPT, MPH(s), Professor of Physical Therapy.\n\nDr. Walton’s 3rd year Doctor of Physical Therapy Program, along with the support of second-year Graduate Assistants, completed two different two-hour sessions to the Bhutanese Community Center on Oct. 27 and Nov. 8 with the assistance of Mr. Sitaula's translation of presentations into Nepali. Presentations included: “Nutrition and Physical Activity for People with Diagnosis Diabetes Mellitus II”; \"Preventing High Blood Pressure\"; and \"Reducing Stress and Increasing Resiliency through Physical Activity.”\n\nReflecting on their experiences Nicholas Capobianco, SPT, Graduate Teaching Assistant; James Curley, SPT; Bryan Gorczyca; and Dan Passafiume shared the deep impact and inspiration that this experience provided them as they prepare for their profession:\n\n“To be welcomed into the Bhutanese Community Center (BCC) as a guest presenter this semester reminded me and my peers how important it is to connect with our diverse local population. As third-year physical therapy students, we understand that it is our social and professional responsibility to use our health literacy to teach and advocate for people who may not have the same background. Yet, our experience at the BCC gave us a glimpse of what this actually looks like in practice. All of the benefits — cultural immersion, education, healthy changes — occur with persistence, patience, an honest narrative, and commitment to understanding rather than just periodic visits, posters, and statistics. While it was rewarding to share information with new friends and be thanked on our way out, the real value of our visit was humbly realizing that it was just a start. In our future as healthcare professionals, it’s the relationships we will develop that will forge a lasting, positive impact.”\n\nDr. Walton’s students also provided hands-on assistance to members of the Bhutanese community during the events by providing blood pressure screenings and demonstrations on how to use at-home blood pressure cuffs. Additionally, the students submitted 40 original health education handouts on various public health physical therapy-related topics, to be translated into Nepali, for the community.\n\nIn addition to the CBL project, the University is also partnering with NeighborWorks NEPA and Congolese refugee community leader and University student, Ushu Mukelo, to offer a series of workshops to the Congolese community focused on different issues in relation to housing, especially relevant as this community looks to purchase homes or find stable and affordable rental properties. The three-part series that is taking place in December 2021 and January 2022 will offer informational presentations on topics related to: mortgage loans and public assistance, housing quality, and understanding housing rights with Neighborworks and other community partners providing up to date and relevant information that will be translated by Mr. Mukelo into Swahili.\n\n“As we see with this fall’s projects, health and wellbeing, language access, and affordable housing are salient issues for both the Bhutanese and Congolese refugee communities in Scranton. We are proud of our students and honored to partner with refugee community leaders and community partners to help provide relevant resources. To work with and accompany these communities – individuals and families who have had to flee situations of violence, extreme poverty and other traumas – is a source of mutual learning and directly ties to our mission as a Jesuit and Catholic institution,” said Julie Schumacher Cohen.\n\nAs we all work together to form a more equitable and inclusive community in Scranton, the University is deeply appreciative for all that our refugee communities bring to this city and plans to continue its engagement and efforts in alignment with the University’s mission and strategic plan’s focus on partnerships for the common good.\n\nThe University of Scranton is proud to report that student voting on its campus increased significantly in last year’s presidential election, rising to 73.1% in 2020 from a rate of 50.6% in 2016 and 7 points above the 66% 2020 student national average. The University also increased voter registration rates, with 86.7% of eligible voters registering compared to the 83% national average. The full campus report can be viewed here.\n\nIn addition to the national context of increased voter turnout amid high polarization, The University of Scranton implemented new non-partisan civic engagement initiatives aimed at spurring student voting. In 2020, the University launched a new “Royals Vote” initiative to help increase student voter turnout through voter engagement and education. This effort was a partnership between Student Government and the Office of Community and Government Relations and included programs such as in-class presentations by student government senators, voting office hours and a call-in line, an extensive social media campaign and the creation of a website to share the most up-to-date voting information as the election drew near. This information was especially important due to the increase of mail-in voting options during the COVID-19 pandemic and on election day 2020, student government organized outdoor campus tabling to provide information on polling locations.\n\n“This [initiative] was a way for us to foster civic engagement among our student body and learn more about our democracy. We found that Scranton students were engaged and excited about the election and appreciated the Royals Vote initiative for giving them direction on voter registration and education. Many students wanted to participate in the election but needed guidance on how, where and when to get involved. Royals Vote was able to answer these questions and more,” said Julia Hack ’21 who served as the chief of staff of Student Government for the 2020-2021 academic year.\n\nIn addition to launching the “Royals Vote” initiative, this year the University joined The ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, which empowers colleges and universities to achieve excellence in nonpartisan student democratic engagement. During the 2020 election cycle, The University of Scranton participated in the ALL IN Challenge 2020 by creating a civic action plan to further involve the campus community in the effort to increase voting rates and engagement. The Royals delivered this election cycle with 73.1% voting rate, earning the University a Gold Seal from the ALL IN Challenge. You can view the 2020 Action Plan and learn more about the ALL IN Challenge here.\n\n“It’s incredibly important that we engage with our peers and the campus community about the importance of voting in every election. Positioned in a swing region of the most important swing state in the country, our votes have the power to sway the outcomes of critical elections for Governor, U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and others in next year’s midterm elections” said Conor Nelon ’22 Political Science & Strategic Communication Major and Student Government Chief of Staff.\n\nAdditionally, the University’s Political Dialogues Working Group, begun in 2017, held a series of topical dialogues that connected voting, values and civic identity in the runup to the 2020 election.\n\n“The most powerful tool we have as citizens is our ability to vote. When we work together as a community to increase the number of people that vote in each election it means our community receives better representation, more funding and a better quality of life. As we make progress together it is imperative that we understand the history of voting and the availability of neutral informational resources in order to increase voter turnout,” said Sultana Rahman ’22, political science, criminal justice & Arabic minor and community and civic engagement intern with the Office of Community and Government Relations.\n\nThis report detailing University of Scranton voting data in the context of comes from the Institute for Democracy & Higher Education (IDHE), creators of the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement, or NSLVE. IDHE is located at Tufts University’s Tisch College of Civic Life.\n\nNationwide, the study’s authors report a record-breaking set of findings. On campuses across the country, students built on the momentum swing of 2018 and voted at high rates in the 2020 election, with voter turnout jumping to 66% in last year’s presidential election. The 14 percentage point increase, from 52% turnout in the 2016 election, outpaces that of all Americans, which jumped 6 percentage points from 61% to 67%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n“That students, often younger and first-time voters, turned out at rates commensurate with the general public is nothing short of stunning,” said IDHE director Nancy Thomas. “We attribute this high level of participation to many factors, including student activism on issues such as racial injustice, global climate change and voter suppression, as well as increased efforts by educators to reach students and connect them to the issues and to voting resources.”\n\nThe 2020 election cycle is one that will be long-remembered for the many political factors surrounding the election and with the unique challenges posed by the onset of the pandemic.\n\n“Despite the many personal challenges that University of Scranton students faced during the 2020 election, I am highly impressed with the level of engagement and civic concern expressed by our students as they participated in the civic process, many for the first time. I am hopeful that this experience will translate into our Royals becoming life-long voters,” said Carolyn M. Bonacci, community and civic engagement coordinator at the University.\n\nOne big step to continuing this momentum forward is for everyone to ensure that their voter registration is accurate and up-to-date. This can easily be done at vote.gov.\n\nIDHE’s National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement (NSLVE, pronounced n-solve) is the nation’s largest study of college and university student voting. Institutions must opt-in to the study, and at this time, nearly 1,200 campuses of all types—community colleges, research universities, minority-serving and women’s colleges, state universities, and private institutions—participate. The dataset reflects all 50 states and the District of Columbia and includes 49 of the nation’s 50 flagship schools. IDHE uses de-identified student records to ensure student privacy.

Well, I’ll give it a shot. What I thought would just be another uneventful weekend sitting in my room became a key moment in my faith journey with amazing new friends. In high school, I had such a great experience going on my home parish's Confirmation Retreat (as a retreatant and as a leader) that I knew that I had to go on retreats here at The University of Scranton with Campus Ministries. After going on the Connections Retreat as a first-year student, it was a no-brainer: I had to go on the Mystery Retreat!\n\nAt first, I had some doubts. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to focus on my faith journey since I didn't know some of the other retreatants except as being part of the University worshipping community. I met the other students coming on the retreat and the amazing leaders who had put this whole thing together. To my relief, this retreat brought me closer to God and solidified my values within my faith. We began these new friendships with endless laughs and the best stories and it felt like I had known them all my whole life. Not even ten minutes into unpacking we were already bonding over the adventures that lie ahead of us. The rest of the weekend was no different.\n\nThe conversations I had within my small group were eye-opening and spiritually fulfilling. One point that was made throughout the weekend was to reflect on our image of God and identify where some of those images need healing. Even though I always knew that God has no gender, I realized that I consistently think of God as \"male.\" But every time I feel that I am talking with God, I always get a response that seems like it is coming from a female. Once I allowed this – the feminine side of God – to be brought to my consciousness, it made so much sense and made my image of God so much clearer.\n\nHearing the retreat leaders’ witness talks really affected me spiritually and emotionally. On most retreats, I am able to connect in some way to the witness talk, but for some reason, this time around, they really hit home. It was almost like God knew that I needed to come on this retreat and hear these talks. I think She also knew that I had been struggling with a few things and needed some perspective. It was very refreshing to hear these stories from other people my age. Just having the reminder that I’m not alone was amazing. Listening to the witness talks and discussing them in our small groups truly helped me open up and talk about the hard questions about our faith. Being able to share this part of my life with friends is a huge blessing.\n\nI cannot stress enough how wonderful the Mystery Retreat was. This was a spiritually fulfilling and enlightening experience, and the student leaders were/are awesome. I could not have asked for a better weekend. I hope that other students have a chance to go on this retreat and that someday I can help lead it. And to anyone that reads this, please come on these retreats! It is one of the best ways to deepen your faith and connect with others who want the same thing!\n\nOn Nov. 1, the University president, Joseph Marina, S.J., sent a message to the University community celebrating both the Solemnity of All Saints and National Native American Heritage Month. Below is his note.\n\nToday, the Church celebrates the Solemnity of All Saints. This is a sacred day in which we not only remember the great men and women of the Catholic faith who continue to provide us with good and holy example but also a special time to invoke their aid for the graces we desire. Many of us tend to gravitate toward St. Ignatius and other Jesuit role models in our prayers and our actions. Nothing wrong with that! But the Communion of Saints is far more expansive. It is comprised of those in Heaven along with those who live on Earth, all held together by the love of God and the ardent desire to share that love. The Catechism of the Catholic Church puts it this way: “It is not merely by the title of example that we cherish the memory of those in heaven; we seek, rather, that by this devotion to the exercise of charity, the union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be strengthened (#957).\n\nAlso, November is National Native American Heritage Month. It is a time to celebrate cultures, traditions, histories, and to acknowledge the important contributions of the original inhabitants of our continent. This month is also a time to educate and raise awareness about the unique challenges and sufferings Native people and communities have faced historically and in the present.\n\nThe University of Scranton has officially adopted a Land Acknowledgment Statement to recognize and honor the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Lenape, the Munsee, the Shawnee and the Susquehannocks in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Statement reads:\n\nThe University of Scranton acknowledges the original inhabitants and nations of this land: the Lenape, the Munsee, the Shawnee and the Susquehannocks. May we be ever mindful of their legacy and contributions and commit ourselves to stewarding this land with care and compassion as we navigate our communities towards faith and justice.\n\nWhile some departments, clubs and other groups at the University already include a land acknowledgment as part of their events, the University now has a standard institution-wide statement that can be read at the start of all University-sponsored events. I believe this statement is an important step forward to help build awareness and generate opportunities that will enrich all our lives.\n\nI wish to recognize Dr. Adam Pratt and his research students, Peter Burke and Katia Ramirez, for assisting with the development of this statement. And I encourage faculty, staff and students to please read the statement at the start of their events whenever possible. The Land Acknowledgement Statement will be posted on the University’s Diversity Equity and Inclusion website and on the Office of Equity and Diversity’s website.\n\nAnd so we have more than one reason to celebrate as the month of November begins –first, an opportunity to pray in a special way with all the saints and, in so doing, grow stronger in God’s love. And second, to give thanks for the wonderful gift of our Native American sisters and brothers and to honor their legacy on the land on which our beloved University stands.\n\nIn today ’s first reading, from the Book of Revelation, St. John writes “I had a vision of a great multitude, which no one could count, from every nation, race, people, and tongue. They stood before the throne and before the Lamb, wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.” In other words, there ’s room for everyone in the Communion of Saints. May it always be so. Saints of God come to our aid. Hasten to meet us, angels of the Lord.\n\nMichael Fennie, Ph.D., Arthur Catino, Ph.D., and Nicholas Sizemore, Ph.D., all associate professors of chemistry at The University of Scranton, were awarded a $362,773 National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Instrumentation grant. The grant will allow the University to purchase a Bruker 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, which will be used by undergraduates, graduate students and faculty at Scranton in both chemistry courses and research projects. Professors from local colleges and researchers from area companies will also have access to the state-of-the-art equipment, as will area high school students through an outreach program included as part of the NSF funded proposal.\n\n“NMR spectroscopy is central to modern chemistry research. This instrument uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to determine the structures of molecules, giving us information about their physical properties and reactivity,” said Dr. Fennie, the principal investigator on the grant. “We need to train our students to be competent scientists once they enter graduate school, or start a career in industry or at a lab. Having hands-on research experience using real-world instrumentation at Scranton is what makes a difference in our outcomes.”\n\nNMR spectroscopy shares the same theoretical principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used in healthcare – only for molecules, explained Dr. Fennie, which he said also provides a good conceptual foundation for pre-med students. The new NMR equipment, with much-improved detection and throughput capabilities, will increase the productivity of faculty research and enhance the research-training of undergraduate and master’s students as they prepare for STEM careers in academia or industry.\n\nNMR spectroscopy, using older equipment, is already included in more than half a dozen chemistry courses at Scranton, including organic chemistry labs II and III, Instrumental Analysis Lab, Forensic Chemistry Lab, and Advanced Inorganic Lab. The new equipment will enhance the students’ exposure in courses as well as supplement their research projects.\n\n“Our current instrument allows for only a single sample to be loaded at a time for analysis, and each analysis takes a long time to complete, making it impractical to obtain individual NMR data for each student in larger lab courses, such as sophomore-level organic chemistry. The new equipment allows for auto-loading of multiple samples at a time, and the time required for each analysis is much shorter, enabling students in these labs to prepare their own samples, submit them to the NMR queue, and then receive their own data, which is getting closer to what it is like in an actual research setting,” said Dr. Fennie. “Getting that training early on is only going to be more helpful to our students’ development as scientists.”\n\nThe technology can also be used for broad research areas ranging from medicinal chemistry, such as studies pertaining to peptide folding and natural products, to experiments for the synthesis of molecules that can be used in OLED displays.\n\n“I couldn’t be more proud of Dr. Michael Fennie and his colleagues at The University of Scranton, and this investment in our students and promise it has to bridge the classroom to the work room,” said Rep. Matt Cartwright. “Giving industry partners access to this tool will serve as an enticement for them to stay in the region and grow our STEM-related job market. I also applaud the collaboration among our higher learning institutions and secondary schools, I look forward to what new research, new ideas and new scientists may come from it.”\n\nThe new equipment will be used for collaborative and independent research projects with faculty members at area colleges, such as King's College, Penn State Scranton and Keystone College, as well as for studies at area businesses, such as Schott Glass, The Azek Company and Process Technologies and Packaging.\n\nDr. Fennie is especially interested in how the new equipment can be used discover new reactions and better understand how these reactions actually work.\n\n“The NMR will allow us to collect data on how fast a reaction proceeds and the intermediates the reaction might go through. That is important for developing new chemical processes, and optimizing reactions so that we can use less resources in our experiments. In other words, making the chemistry more sustainable,” said Dr. Fennie.\n\nIn addition, the University will work with teachers at Scranton High School, West Scranton High School, Honesdale High School, Mid Valley Secondary Center and MMI Preparatory School to bring their students to campus to learn more about the scientific uses of NMR spectroscopy.\n\nThe NMR spectrometer will be installed during the University’s winter break and intersession. Faculty, and then students, would be trained in the use of the new equipment in late January and during the spring semester.\n\nDr. Fennie joined the faculty at Scranton in 2012. He earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Canisius College and his doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Catino joined the faculty at Scranton in 2013. He earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Franklin and Marshall College and his doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of Maryland. Dr. Sizemore joined the faculty at Scranton in 2015. He earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Case Western Reserve University and his doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of California, Irvine.\n\nJeffrey Colucci '21 recently embarked on his career in accounting. Here, he shares what he's learned on his first month on the job at KPMG as an audit associate.\n\nAs I reflect on my first month as an Audit Associate at KPMG in their New York City Metro practice, I am filled with excitement, nerves and gratitude. During my first week, the new associates had virtual training and we were warmly welcomed to the firm by countless friendly individuals from managers to partners. After I completed the first week of the virtual training, I jumped right into my first engagement and began auditing my first client. I worked on various tasks with my engagement team such as testing expenses, payroll, investments, revenue and more to ensure the financial statements were fairly stated. I had a bit of a heavy workload since it was “busy season” for the client I was assigned to, which has exposed me to various audit procedures and concepts and allowed me to learn more than I ever could have imagined, gaining invaluable technical skills to use on my future engagements. Some days have been challenging as I get acclimated to the new role and do many things for the first time, but the difficult days are the ones where we experience the most growth.\n\nDespite being in a virtual environment, I never feel alone as it couldn’t be easier to message my team and ask to hop on a phone call to answer all my questions (which I’ve had a ton of), regardless of how busy they are. I have been so impressed and grateful for my team’s support, patience and encouragement thus far and appreciate the knowledge they share with me every day.\n\nFor the second part of my training, I recently visited Lakehouse, KPMG’s new state-of-the-art learning, development, and innovation center in Florida, which is such an incredible facility that it is hard to put into words. Initially, I was so nervous to attend my first in-person event since I didn’t know anyone, but everyone was so friendly, and I was so grateful for the opportunity to meet other new hires and form relationships! It was priceless to attend this training in-person, especially in such a luxurious and innovative facility, to further develop my audit skills and foster new connections. KPMG’s enormous investment in this training facility and their people is impressive and reminded me that I chose the right firm that really cares about its people and their futures. I’m excited to go in the NYC office for the first time in the coming weeks for more technology training and for lunch to meet more individuals at the firm.\n\nI am so grateful for everyone who helped get me where I am today; my friends and family who are always supporting me, my accounting professors at Scranton for all the knowledge I absorbed from them, all my mentors along the way, and the Center for Career Development who connect students with opportunities such as this one. I’m so excited to see where my career takes me at such a prestigious firm with endless opportunities in front of me!\n\nThe University of Scranton Players will return to live performances in the Royal Theatre with a bill of three classic one-act plays that celebrate the nature of theatre: Catastrophe by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee’s The Zoo Story, and The Actor’s Nightmare by Christopher Durang. The evening will last around one hour and a half with an intermission. Performances will be held on Oct. 22, 23 & 24 and Oct. 29, 30, and 31. Performance times are at 8 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. All performances will be in person in the Royal Theatre on the campus of The University of Scranton. Actors will be unmasked while on stage. Reservations are required. There are no walk-up tickets that will be sold. The production will be directed by Michael O’Steen.\n\nReservations can be made at this link or by visiting us at thescrantonplayers.com.\n\nCatastrophe is written by Samuel Beckett, widely recognized as one of the greatest dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. Mr. Beckett is most renowned for his play Waiting for Godot. Like no other dramatist before him, Mr. Beckett’s works capture the pathos and ironies of modern life yet still maintain his faith in man’s capacity for compassion and survival, no matter how absurd his environment may have become.\n\nEdward Albee’s The Zoo Story was a theatrical phenomenon when it first appeared in the 1950s. In it, a man sits peacefully reading in the sunlight in Central Park. There enters a second man. He is a young, unkempt and undisciplined vagrant where the first is neat, ordered, well-to-do and conventional. The vagrant is a soul in torture and rebellion. He longs to communicate so fiercely that he frightens and repels his listener. He is a man drained of all hope who, in his passion for company, seeks to drain his companion. With provocative humor and unrelenting suspense, the young savage slowly, but relentlessly, brings his victim down to his own atavistic level as he relates a story about his visit to the zoo.\n\nThe Actor’s Nightmare is a comedic romp through the world of theatre by the acclaimed comic playwright Christopher Durang. Having casually wandered onstage, George is informed that one of the actors, Eddie, has been in an auto accident and he must replace him immediately. Apparently, no one is sure of what play is being performed but George (costumed as Hamlet) seems to find himself in the middle of a scene from Private Lives, surrounded by such luminaries as Sarah Siddons, Dame Ellen Terry and Henry Irving. As he fumbles through one missed cue after another the other actors shift to Hamlet, then a play by Samuel Beckett, and then a climactic scene from what might well be A Man for All Seasons—by which time the disconcerted George has lost all sense of contact with his fellow performers. Yet, in the closing moments of the play, he rises to the occasion and finally says the right lines, whereupon make-believe suddenly gives way to reality as the executioner’s axe (meant for Sir Thomas Moore) instead sends poor George to oblivion—denying him a well-earned curtain call.\n\nThe company of 3 for One-Act features: Keenan Beveridge, Katherine Carter, Geoff Pizzuto, Neely Rice, Wilmarr Saint Surin, Andrew Vizzard, and Grace Washney.\n\nIf you have any questions, email players@scranton.edu or visit us at thescrantonplayers.com.\n\nThe University of Scranton Players is an academic theatre program that brings exceptional theatre to Northeastern Pennsylvania every season.

He will present “Recovering the voices of our ancestors: preserving the world’s endangered manuscript heritage.”\n\nThe University will bestow an honorary degree upon Father Stewart at the lecture, which is open to members of the University community and invited guests.\n\n“Through his drive and initiative, Father Columba has rescued, saved, digitally archived and shared with the world ancient religious texts that were in jeopardy of being lost forever,” said Rev. Joseph G. Marina, S.J., president of The University of Scranton. “We are delighted to recognize his lifelong commitment both to the Church and to the preservation of the world’s religious history by bestowing upon him an honorary degree.”\n\nFather Stewart was named HMML’s sixth executive director in 2003. In that role, he travels extensively throughout the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and South Asia cultivating relationships with communities possessing manuscript collections from the early medieval to early modern periods. Although HMML’s original efforts targeted primarily Christian collections in various European locations, under Father Stewart’s leadership, HMML’s non-European manuscript preservation projects have increased from one project in Lebanon to projects located in more than a dozen countries. During this time, HMML has photographed tens of thousands of manuscripts in many of the world’s most dangerous and difficult-to-reach places and given priority to preserving the manuscript collections of persecuted or endangered minorities.\n\n“Father Columba believes it is important to preserve these early Christian and interreligious and intercultural documents, manuscript and artifacts from our past because they help us understand not only those specific societies and cultures, but also because they help us understand more fully our connectedness as human beings,” said Gretchen J. Van Dyke, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at The University of Scranton, who first met Father Stewart when she was a Resident Scholar at the Collegeville Institute for Ecumenical and Cultural Research in Collegeville, Minnesota, during the 2018-2019 academic year.\n\nSince 2003, Father Stewart has secured more than $11 million in funding from leading private foundations and government agencies, including the Arcadia Fund, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Henry Luce Foundation, Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. These funders have fueled HMML’s increased field operations and supported the creation and expansion of HMML’s online platform, the largest and most comprehensive digital collection of manuscripts ever created. The online collections are available to registered users to browse through tens of thousands of manuscripts at no cost. Under his leadership HMML also completed a record-setting capital campaign in 2017 that raised more than $20 million to support HMML’s digital manuscript preservation goals and renovate HMML’s facilities in Collegeville.\n\nUnder his leadership, HMML was awarded the 2011 National Medal of Honor from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the highest award a library can receive in the United States. Father Stewart was named by the NEH as the 2019 Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities, the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.\n\nFr. Columba has been featured on many national and international media outlets, including the CBS News program 60 Minutes, BBC World News, PBS’s Religion and Ethics Newsweekly as well as in The Economist, Harvard Magazine, Smithsonian Magazine, NEH’s Humanities Magazine, The Wall Street Journal and The Chronicle of Higher Education. In December 2019, he wrote a cover story for America specifically highlighting the long Benedictine determination to preserve ancient texts around the world.\n\nFather Stewart has published extensively in his research field of early Christian monasticism and is much in demand as a presenter and lecturer. He has received numerous grants and fellowships for his own scholarship, including being named a Guggenheim Fellow and a resident member of the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, among others.\n\nFather Stewart earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College and his master’s degree from Yale University. After further studies at Saint John’s University School of Theology, he earned his D.Phil. from the University of Oxford, England. He professed vows as a Benedictine monk of Saint John’s Abbey, Collegeville, in 1982 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1990. In 1989, he joined the faculty of the graduate School of Theology and undergraduate Department of Theology at Saint John’s University. He also currently serves as the Benedictine in residence at the Collegeville Institute.\n\nThe University of Scranton has awarded 18 students from its class of 2025 four-year, full-tuition Presidential Scholarships.\n\nPresidential Scholarships are awarded to incoming first-year students with outstanding records in high school and notable community involvement.

Tate, Esq. ’56 Collection of Aerospace Memorabilia” at 5 p.m. Oct. 14 on the first floor of Hyland Hall in the Department of Physics and Engineering Mechanical Engineering Facility.\n\nA native of Olyphant, Tate received his B.S. in Marketing from the University in 1956. From 1962 through 2003, he played a major role in the national aerospace program, working for government and industry on the Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle initiatives. In a career spanning more than four decades, he held positions with a private corporation, working at Rockwell International for 12 years; the federal government, serving on the House of Representatives’ Committee on Science and Technology for 15 years; and an advocacy group, working for the Aerospace Industries Association for 17 years.\n\nTate will also appear as a guest speaker at The Institute for Electronics and Electrical Engineering Seminar Series Oct. 14 at noon in Hyland Hall’s Room 102. In conjunction with this presentation, the “Tate Collection of Aerospace Memorabilia,” which Tate recently donated to the University, will have a permanent home in the department’s new Mechanical Engineering facility in Hyland Hall.\n\nThe Mechanical Engineering Program in the Physics and Engineering Department is a 5,300 square-foot, state-of-the-art learning and laboratory space. Using modern equipment and contemporary methods, students learn analysis, synthesis and evaluation for understanding solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, dynamics and thermodynamics, control, and vibration. They work with a wind tunnel, where they determine fluid characteristics by measuring aerodynamic pressures, forces and moments applied to aerodynamic models by the airflow in laminar and turbulent flows. They also investigate the behavior of engineering materials by performing tensile and compression tests to determine material properties such as strength, modulus of elasticity, yield, and failure stresses.\n\nThe exhibition of the “Tate Collection of Aerospace Memorabilia” will not only document an important phase of engineering history, but it will also convey to students the exciting careers and endless possibilities that a University of Scranton education provides.\n\nThrough the NASA memorabilia collection and his personal recollections of his time in the aerospace industry, Tate takes us on a spectacular journey through an age of discovery best exemplified by the moon landing. His pioneering spirit helped forge a new era of space exploration that future generations will continue to study for ages to come.\n\nTate was part of the space journey from the very beginning, when President Kennedy committed the nation to “landing a person on the moon before the end of the decade.” Tate’s Jesuit education at Scranton convinced him to listen to his calling and “go forth and set the world on fire.” He set out for California with his marketing degree from Scranton, and his confidence landed him a position testing, analyzing and synthesizing data for the NASA and Rockwell flight teams. His early work with spacecraft testing for Rockwell International at Edwards Air Force Base set the stage for his next two career paths: serving the House Committee on Science and Technology, and serving as Vice President of the Aerospace Industries Association.\n\nWhile the early NASA work was exciting and generously funded, shuttle setbacks and economic downturns ultimately grounded plans for continued spaceflight. Still, the aerospace program left a remarkable legacy, opening a universe of possibilities for those who care to enter. It continues to inspire innovation, exploration and discovery in children and adults worldwide. Some of its benefits range from current students’ interest in space education to the expanded role of private industry in aerospace activities and plans for visiting Mars. While the inventions that resulted from the program are too numerous to mention, their enormous impact on our civilization helps us study, save and preserve our planet for future generations.\n\nTate’s legacy with our space program is a powerful reminder of where a University of Scranton degree can take you. Tate traveled the world after graduation, and his love for The University of Scranton remained front and center in his life because of Scranton’s outstanding professors and the Jesuits who encouraged his curiosity and the Socratic method of learning.\n\n“My Jesuit education provided character building and self-discipline with rigorous leadership training from the military sciences,” he said. “The Jesuits taught me and continue to teach current students to look beyond what is in front of them. Throughout my life, I stayed connected to Scranton and The Alumni Society. Because of great professors and the Jesuit influence on my life, I established, endowed and continue to support The Tate Family Scholarship. I’ve also chosen membership in The Estate Society.\n\n“I know that with philanthropy comes promise and possibilities. I want the next generation of explorers to receive a Catholic and Jesuit education that takes them to discovering their great frontier. Together, our support can redirect their future in ways unimagined. I firmly believe in the scripture, ‘To whom much is given, much is expected,’ and I am honored to support my alma mater’s mission.”\n\nScranton is the hometown of the President of the United States, and the hometown of the father of a former First Lady. It is the location of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in NBC’s The Office. It’s the where the Pennsylvania Polka started. It is also the place where anthracite coal was mined and where a miner’s strike in 1902 led to national labor reforms. Scranton is like Boston - only without the clams, if the description mentioned in an episode of HBO’s Sopranos is accurate. Scranton makes cameo appearances in the movie Home Alone and in the Harry Chapin song, 30,000 Pounds of Bananas.\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 19, a program will examine “Scranton in the Popular Imagination,” and consider how and if Scranton in the popular and national imagination reflects the Scranton of today. The event is the first public event of “Scranton’s Story, Our Nation’s Story,” a multi-year project led by The University of Scranton in collaboration with community partners, and supported through a grant from The National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n“Scranton in the Popular Imagination” features a talk by author and Scranton native Jay Parini, Ph.D., followed by a panel discussion with community leaders and University humanities faculty. The event, which begins at 7 p.m. on Oct. 19 at the Scranton Cultural Center, is offered free of charge. Reservations are required to attend and can be made at: surveymonkey.com/r/ImagineScranton. Additional events around this theme include a Jane Jacobs inspired walking tour on Oct. 23 at 1 p.m. in downtown Scranton.\n\nAn award-winning poet, biographer, fiction writer and educator, Dr. Parini is the Axinn Professor of English at Middlebury College in Vermont. He has written is volumes of poetry and biographies of John Steinbeck, Robert Frost and William Faulkner. His books include “The Last Station” about the last year in the life of Russian author Leo Tolstoy that was made into a film in 2009, which received two Oscar nominations. His most recent book is “Borges and Me: An Encounter,” published in 2020.\n\nA graduate of West Scranton High School, Dr. Parini received an honorary degree from The University of Scranton in 2005 and was awarded the Weinberg Memorial Library’s Royden B. Davis, S.J., Distinguished Author Award in 2012.\n\nPanelists for “Scranton in the Popular Imagination” are Joseph Kraus, Ph.D., professor and chair of the English and Theatre Department at the University; Glynis Johns, founder and CEO of the Black Scranton Project; and Maria MacDonald, executive director of the Center for the Living City. Hank Willenbrink, Ph.D., Theatre Program director and associate professor in the Department of English and Theatre at the University will moderate the panel and audience discussion.\n\n“For the first set of events as part of this larger project, we thought we should begin at home and focus discussion around our identity. What makes Scranton unique? How does its portrayal match our lived experience? What does it mean to be a Scrantonian, as we look ahead to the 250th anniversary of the country? Authenticity and authentic portrayal are integral parts of any city’s ethos and our experience of where we live,” said Willenbrink, also a member of the project’s steering committee.\n\n“Scranton’s Story, Our Nation’s Story” seeks to capture the unique narrative of Scranton and relate it to the history of the United States prior to the commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the United States. The project incorporates eight themes, starting with how Scranton has been portrayed in the popular imagination, and continuing to its industrial era growth, Indigenous history, religious tapestry, diverse immigrant populations – past and present – and the role it played in the Underground Railroad and Black history. Throughout, civic engagement, founding debates, and local and national identity will be explored by considering how the Scranton, and American, story may be understood anew 250 years later and the roles and responsibilities of local citizens.\n\nThe programs, which begin in Oct. 2021 and end in fall 2023, will involve lectures with question and answer interactive sessions, panel discussions with audience responses, public facilitated dialogues, and story exchanges, as well as walking and bus tours, youth writing workshops, and an oral history story collection that will provide new humanities material for discussion.\n\nUniversity offices coordinating the project include: Office of Community Relations, Schemel Forum, Slattery Center for the Humanities, and the Weinberg Memorial Library. Community organizations collaborating with the University on the project include: Black Scranton Project, Center for the Living City, Lackawanna County Arts and Culture Department, The Lackawanna Historical Society, Lackawanna County Immigration Inclusion Committee, Narrative 4, the Scranton Area Ministerium, United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania and WVIA.\n\nThe University of Scranton has appointed 16 new full-time faculty members for the 2021-2022 academic year.\n\nWesam Alramadeen, was named lecturer in the Operations and Analytics Department.

Joseph G. Marina, S.J., as the 29th president of The University of Scranton, was evident throughout the address given by the new president at the ceremony. In his Inaugural Address, Father Marina referred to remarks of former Scranton presidents, words of Jesuit superior generals, the life of St. Ignatius and the accomplishments of students, faculty, staff, alumni and others, to illustrate the influence one person can have on others.\n\n“In his first inaugural address, Father Pilarz referred to our University as a miracle in the mountains. And that’s exactly what it is. But it didn’t take long for me to notice that Scranton is also a vineyard in the valley, a place where hard work, dedication, and an authentic commitment to the ideals and characteristics of Catholic and Jesuit higher education converge for the benefit of the students we serve,” said Father Marina. “This vineyard produces sweet and abundant grapes and our harvest is a harvest to be envied. … The credit goes to our wonderful students, our amazing faculty and staff, loyal trustees, alumni and benefactors who, year after year, have cultivated the soil of this vineyard to make it rich and nurturing.”\n\nFather Marina said the term “a fire that kindles other fires,” from the second decree of the 35th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus, “is a metaphor that every Jesuit work, and every member of that work, can take on in a personal and apostolic way. The University of Scranton is, without a doubt, a fire that kindles other fires – one that illuminates and warms rather than burns and destroys.”\n\nFather Marina referred to the University’s sense of community as its greatest asset.\n\n“The community that is Scranton is authentic, and you can feel it almost immediately when stepping onto our beautiful campus. We are a family,” said Father Marina. “Our community is not an insulated one. It is grounded in God’s love. Our university exists because of Jesus Christ. And our future will be stoked by the fire of the Holy Spirit for decades to come. This triune reality makes our community open to all, not despite their differences, but precisely because of them. We are made stronger by our diversity and by our love for one another.”\n\nFather Marina closed his remarks citing advice he received from Scranton’s 23rd president, Rev. Joseph McShane, S.J., currently the president of Fordham University: “If you love The University of Scranton, if you truly love it, then marvelous things are bound to happen.”\n\nFather Marina said that is “exactly” what he intends to do, and asked others to “please join me as we carry our mission forward, or, more rightly, may I join you? So that, together, we can cultivate this wonderful vineyard in the valley and be that fire that kindles other fires.”\n\nThe Inauguration occurred during the Ignatian Year, the 500th anniversary of the conversion of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus.\n\nNearly 1,500 members of the University community and invited guests attended the Inauguration, including representatives from more than 45 colleges and universities; Rev. Joseph M. O’Keefe, S.J., provincial of the USA East Province of the Society of Jesus, who presented the Missioning of the President at the ceremony; Scranton’s Mayor Paige Cognetti, who provided greetings from the city; and Most Reverend Joseph C. Bambera, D.D., J.C.L., Bishop of Scranton, who provided the Invocation, among others. Recorded greetings were given by U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright and U.S. Senator Bob Casey, a Scranton native. The Inauguration also featured the performance of an original work composed for the Inauguration by David Lantz III, titled “To the Ends of the Earth.”\n\nA recording of the ceremony is available for viewing. Photos from the event can be seen on the University’s Inauguration Flickr album.\n\nIn addition to the Inauguration Ceremony, an Inauguration Mass is planned for Saturday, Sept. 25, at 4 p.m. on campus.

The programming is intended to address student needs related to their resilience and self-compassion based on data gathered from their participation in the National Collegiate Health Assessment.\n\n“The Resilient Royals initiative seeks to normalize struggle and failure while helping students to understand the benefit of growth that can occur by overcoming challenges and for student to develop a greater awareness of resilience and self-compassion,” said Lauren Rivera, J.D., dean of students and assistant vice president for student life at The University of Scranton, who leads the initiative on campus.\n\nDean Rivera said national research suggests that the current generation of college students often struggles to view challenge or failure with a growth mindset. As a result, higher education professionals are helping students to develop a growth mindset as well as other healthy coping skills to successfully navigate academic and non-academic challenges of college life.\n\nScranton’s Resilient Royals programming included a 2019 Fail Forward panel discussion which was attended by 298 people. A survey conducted immediately following the program showed 98 percent of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the Fail Forward Panel helped them to realize that encountering challenges and experiencing failure is a normal part of life, and 94 percent of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the panel inspired them to reflect on how they have coped with and navigated setbacks and challenges in their own life. A survey conducted of attendees one month after the program showed 54 percent of respondents always or frequently viewed challenges, failures and setbacks in their life as opportunities to learn and grow, and 36 percent of respondents practiced self-compassion.\n\nResilient Royals programming also included interactive “Fai"
