        "text": "Timothy Dalton is an SAIIE alum from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who studied with us back in ‘97 when I was a student as well, and became what we say in Spanish “un amigo para toda la vida”.\n\nI remember when I first met him, his name straight away caught my attention, especially having been born and raised in Seville, Spain, we see many American films! So straight away I had associated him with the 007 film (James Bond). For all you 007 fans out there, one of the actors that played James Bond in this film was also called Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights and License to Kill).\n\nTo show you how studying abroad can change your life and help you in your future career, just take a look at the path that “mi amigo” Tim took.\n\nSince his time at SAIIE, he has gone on to conquer the world. In 2002, he began working as a Special Agent for the US Department of State, and still is till this day!\n\nHe has been working in places such as Caracas (Venezuela) as the Security Service at the U.S. Embassy and Hong Kong as the Assistant Regional Security Officer at the U.S. Consulate General. Currently he is posted as the Regional Security Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Wellington (New Zealand).\n\nAs you can see, SAIIE has its own 007 secret agent!\n\nTim has travelled the world, worked around the world, seen the world… and studying abroad at SAIIE was the beginning of his amazing adventure...\n\nWe always love to keep up with our alumni,and hear about their latest achievements and successes after their time studying abroad with us in Seville. We are proud to call Timothy an SAIIE alum!"
