        "text": "George Lazenby certainly looked the part. But could the 28-year-old, who had no acting experience and was more himbo than sophisticate, really play James Bond?\n\nProducers ran him through a series of tests to make sure the model could play the role. His acting was reviewed. His fighting ability was judged. Then, in another important consideration for the times, they made sure their hero wasn’t gay.\n\nThe producers put him up in an apartment and “tested” his sexuality.\n\n“A male employee brought up girls on separate occasions,” write Matthew Field and Ajay Chowdhury, authors of “Some Kind of Hero,” a comprehensive account of the James Bond series, “and stayed while Lazenby made love to them.”\n\nJames Bond today is bigger than any one actor. Pierce Brosnan breaks box-office records, and Daniel Craig breaks them all over again. It’s fun to speculate who will replace Craig, who has suggested that “Spectre” is his last time in the tux, but that choice is unlikely to shake or stir the juggernaut.\n\nThis wasn’t the case in 1967, after Sean Connery quit after his fifth go-round as Bond, “You Only Live Twice.”\n\nProducers faced an enormous challenge: Who could replace a man so associated with the iconic role?\n\nTheir choice was a puzzling one.\n\nAfter considering candidates such as Oliver Reed and “Batman” actor Adam West, as well as future Bonds Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton, they became fixated on Lazenby, a successful Australian male model who had bluffed his way into the room.\n\nBlessed with dashing good looks, Lazenby was the sort who excelled at everything he did. “Champion darts player, best shot in the army,” he said. “I didn’t show fear.”\n\nBefore Bond came calling, Lazenby was already living every man’s dream as a top model in London, later saying he had “more money and girls” before Bond than after.\n\n“I’d see something, I’d just go get it,” said Lazenby. “I’d walk up to [women] in the street and say, ‘Hey, you and me. Let’s go?’ And they’d say, ‘Get out of here,’ or they’d go. It was in the ’60s, when the pill came out and there was no deadly disease. It was great. It was OK to smoke and OK to drink — nobody looked down on you for anything.”\n\nHe was asked to audition for Bond by a casting agent he had dated. He noticed “the clean-cut look of the actors” and realized he’d need a makeover to win the role.\n\n“He went to Sean Connery’s barber, Kurt’s, then in the basement of the Dorchester. He asked for his hair to be cut like Bond,” write the authors. “Kurt then told him who was Connery’s tailor, and Lazenby went to get a suit. At Anthony Sinclair, no bespoke suit could be readied in time, but there was one Connery had rejected. It fit Lazenby like a sartorial Excalibur.”\n\nAnother casting director, Dyson Lovell, brought him to meet Bond producer Harry Saltzman, and Lazenby invented a fake acting biography on the way to the meeting.\n\nWhen Lazenby and the agent entered the powerful producer’s office, Lazenby pulled the ultimate James Bond power move.\n\n“Upon entering the offices, Saltzman, who was on the phone with his feet on the desk, motioned his guest to sit down by jerking his upturned shoes,” write the authors.\n\n“Lazenby was put off by both gestures and walked over to the window and looked out. ‘He told me later this really impressed him,’ [said Lazenby]. When asked to repeat his story, Lazenby motioned to Lovell and told Harry, ‘I just told him, “Let him tell you.” I thought I wouldn’t remember — as it was a bunch of lies. I was really afraid. There was a boardroom and these really aggressive people. I’d never met anybody like this before.’ ”\n\nBut Lazenby folded before the film’s director, Peter Hunt, when, driven by fear, he ignored his fake bio and blurted out the truth.\n\n“I don’t know what came over me,” said Lazenby. “I said, ‘Peter, I’ve never acted a day in my life. I’ve modeled but never spoken in front of a camera.’ And he’s looking at me, ‘What? And you say you can’t act? You’ve fooled two of the most ruthless men I’ve ever met in my life. Stick to your story, and I’ll make you the next James Bond.’ ”\n\nThe Eliza Doolittling of George Lazenby continued.\n\n“Lazenby had elocution lessons to remove his Australian accent and learned to ‘bagpipe the wind in your stomach so when you get nervous, it doesn’t show.’ Lazenby’s gait was also polished. ‘I used to sway. On CinemaScope, it would go all over the place, so I had to walk like Prince Philip.’ ” He was also tested, successfully, on his fighting skills.\n\n“Lazenby’s fighting prowess was auditioned in a fight sequence involving a number of stuntmen,” write the authors, “one of them being Yuri Borienko, who went on to play the chief henchman in the finished film. Lazenby recalled, ‘I only had a 20-minute practice to show me how to stage fight. I’d only been a real fighter before that.’ During the test, Lazenby punched Borienko, who fell down with a bloody nose. ‘That’s when Harry stepped over him,’ [said Lazenby,] ‘grabbed me and says, “We’re going with you. Tell anybody, and the deal’s off. Get out of town.” ’ ”\n\nWhen the actor was introduced to the press as the star of “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service,” he let them know exactly who he was.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to being Bond, for the bread and the birds,” he said. “It’s not that I’m a sex maniac. Forget my ego. I wouldn’t even care if they didn’t put my name on the marquee.”\n\nDuring filming, Lazenby’s swinging style ran afoul of co-star Diana Rigg, of “The Avengers” fame.\n\nToward the start of the shoot, she told him, “You know, if you don’t fool around with the other girls, maybe something can happen. We’d had a little bit of a kiss and cuddle one night. That’s as far as it got.”\n\nLazenby blew it when Rigg “caught him with a production secretary in the stunt tent.”\n\nSome of Lazenby’s biggest problems came in his failure to adapt to the stress, followed by immense boredom, that comes on film shoots. He had a set helicopter fly him to Geneva regularly for trysts, and he began bringing guns to the set and “fir[ing] them off around the crew, making them nervous.”\n\nHis ignorance of film also cost him credibility.\n\nComposer John Barry “remembered Lazenby ruefully.”\n\n“[He] came down to one of the sessions,” Barry recalled. “He stood at the back and listened to the score for one of the scenes. Then he came up to me and said, ‘It fits!’ as if it was the greatest compliment I could ever have hoped for. I thought, ‘Christ, we’ve got a real brain going here. What do you think I do for a living?’ ”\n\nOn the plus side, Lazenby quickly learned the kind of perks that came with the gig.\n\n“Lazenby recalled he used to ride a motorcycle to work, donated to him by Triumph and BSA, just because [he] was James Bond,” the authors write. “The actor was tailed in the car sent to convey him to the studio, the ‘chauffeur kind of watching me to make sure I get to work.’ Eventually, the producers prevailed upon him to commute by a safer vehicle; he was given an Aston Martin.”\n\nAs they shot the film, the producers tried to get Lazenby to sign a long-term contract. But no matter how good the offer, Lazenby, who was paid $50,000 for “OHMSS” and offered $75,000 plus points for the next one, wouldn’t sign.\n\nThe problem, the authors write, was Lazenby’s new friend, Ronan O’Rahilly, “the wealthy founder of the hugely popular counterculture pirate station Radio Caroline.”\n\nO’Rahilly “wasn’t into money. He was into changing the way people thought about things. He was a Kennedy fan.”\n\nLazenby would later say of O’Rahilly: “He was living through me vicariously by upsetting the establishment.”\n\n“O’Rahilly advised George that Bond was over, and that he should be part of the new youth-culture movement,” the authors write. “Lazenby, with his short, Bond hair and Savile Row suits, felt out of sorts with his peers.”\n\nSaltzman offered Lazenby “1 million [British pounds] anywhere in the world to do another Bond film,” but he just wouldn’t sign, with O’Rahilly telling him that “the new Bond could earn half a million for a few weeks work on European films like Clint Eastwood, with the benefit of not being typecast. Lazenby [later] admitted, ‘Ronan had a hold of my brain.’ ”\n\nBy the film’s release, it seemed like Lazenby was intentionally messing with the producers, including Albert “Cubby” Broccoli.\n\n“Lazenby had grown a beard and long hair so [he] could get laid,” the authors write. “Cubby ‘asked me not to come [to the premiere] with a beard,’ [said Lazenby,] but it was my way of saying, ‘I’m myself — I’m not James Bond.’ ” Lazenby felt Bond was exactly the wrong thing to be in the era of peace and free love.\n\n“People weren’t into James Bond,” he said. “Out of vogue, it wasn’t current. Make love not war. [People were] smoking marijuana on the streets in London. Even Wall Street had taken off their ties. I’d go into a restaurant and they’d say, ‘Waiter!’ ”\n\nHe felt so out of place in his finely tailored suits that he donated “three suitcases full of them to the Salvation Army, [with labels stating] ‘especially made for George Lazenby for “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.”’ ”\n\nFinally, in February 1970, the producers gave up. Connery was enticed back for one film, “Diamonds Are Forever,” with an unheard-of $1.25 million salary (Connery used the money to start a Scottish education trust), before the role was turned over to Roger Moore.\n\nThe authors write that Lazenby went on to “develop a real estate fortune.” Still, in time, he realized what a mistake he’d made.\n\n“I was getting bad advice,” Lazenby later said. “I learned a lot.” He even tried to return to Bond soon after, but by then, the producers had moved on. Broccoli said, “We’ll be in touch, George,” and showed him the door."
