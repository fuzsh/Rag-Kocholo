        "text": "What was Picker wrong about in ‘69?\n\nI get that Lazenby himself had decided he wasn't coming back. But unless my memory doesn't serve me well, it was Picker (among others, probably) who rejected the tone of OHMSS and therefore wasn't willing to have DAF be some sort of 'sequel' to OHMSS. Now, we see Bond get his revenge on Blofeld with a smile and some slapstick comedy. That's a mistake, in my opinion. Either way, he probably wasn't wrong from the POV of the chief of UA. OHMSS had not met their expectations after all.\n\nNever heard of that, I always understood it to be that Eon made the conscious choice to NOT make an overt sequel to OHMSS from the moment Lazenby left, and that bringing back Guy Hamilton and hiring Tom Mankiewicz was part of a concerted effort to return to the tone of GF for the early 70s. I honestly don’t blame them for making that decision. Trying to double down by making a direct follow up to one of the least popular Bonds wouldn’t have been wise.\n\nNow, regarding Picker, the only thing I know he had a direct involvement as far as DAF goes was the casting of Bond. In 1971, Eon had already picked American actor John Gavin to be the new Bond. He was all set to play it. But Picker had no confidence that this guy could help right the ship, so he came directly to Connery and asked what it would take to get him back for one more film and the deal was made. As far as I know, this is one of the rare times Picker involved himself in such an overt matter because he preferred to leave it to the filmmakers but this was one of those rare instance he asserted himself. This was also done at the very last minute too. Connery signed onto play Bond in March and was expected to start shooting in April. That would probably account for why Connery wasn’t in good shape because he had very little prep time to get back to that physique he had in his 30s, and he was already 40.\n\nIMO, I think Picker made the right call for both the short and long run. By getting Connery back, Eon was able to deliver another hit film and this would assure them to later recast this time with Roger Moore, and the rest is history.\n\nWould I have liked a OHMSS follow up? Sure, I think every Bond fan would. But the reality of the situation at the time just didn’t allow for that. Eon needed to rebound, not double down. But I may also be biased because I love DAF for the film it is as just another Bond film. The film was never meant to be a follow up to OHMSS, so why should I berate it for not being what it never was meant to be?\n\nAs for his third film, some things to consider. He needed new writers and a new director drastically. I think that’s why the box office numbers dropped off in the late 80s...Maibaum and Glenn really needed to go\n\nI think this is a bit hard on the pair. I think this up-thread explanation helps explain the sagging 80s grosses:\n\nA noticeable drop in box office receipts happened right after MGM bought UA. For various reasons, MGM’s marketing and distribution system in the 80s was no where as good as UA’s in the 60s and 70s.\n\nMaibaum can't be blamed for the final draft of LTK, since the writer's strike prevented him from bringing the ship into port (and it's not as if the final script was badly written). As for Glen, after five films he probably needed a break, but he also deserves some credit for guiding the series after its budget was frozen (post-MR) and UA lost its bearings. Only LTK came out looking like it was on a lowered budget, and that was partly because it had to be made in Mexico, again because of the squeezed budget. A different director would have still struggled with later films if the series's resources hadn't risen by the time of GE."
