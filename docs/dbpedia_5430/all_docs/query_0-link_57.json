        "text": "Nomination Summaries\n\nEmergency Management Exemplary Service Award\n\nAll information below is adapted from nomination material submitted for the Emergency Management Exemplary Service Award.\n\nYouth\n\nNew Brunswick River Watch coordinators\n\n(Samantha Grant, Brennen de Carufel)\n\nMs. Grant, Operations Officer with the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization (NB EMO), and Mr. de Carufel, Training Coordinator for NB EMO, volunteered to absorb the River Watch coordinating responsibilities. Recently joining EM, the duo committed to preparing themselves with diligent research in this field, all while completing their previously assigned tasks. They began by working collaboratively with departments and agencies, then modernized the Provincial River Watch Risk Assessment, organized the annual New Brunswick River Watch conference and presented their findings, and developed a training package for Duty Officers. Their commitment to succeed in their new roles was displayed with their long work days, efficiently answering calls, and providing guidance and feedback to different levels of government and the public. Ms. Grant and Mr. de Carufel have excelled in their first challenging EM role and have undoubtedly performed in an outstanding manner.\n\nMoira Hennebury\n\nMs. Hennebury is the Manager of Emergency Preparedness at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Over the past 4 years, Ms. Hennebury has greatly contributed to improving emergency preparedness within the organization. Her notable achievements include playing a pivotal role in developing Sunnybrook’s first-ever Corporate Emergency Operations Plan, leading the implementation of the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) for the organization and co-leading design of Canada’s largest health-sector focused mass casualty preparedness exercise. Ms. Hennebury’s dedication and passion have had a transformative impact on the EM program at Sunnybrook and have served to advance coordinated EM planning across the Toronto Region, where she co-chairs a regional committee of health sector organizations dedicated to this purpose. Her ability to grasp the complexity of the Ontario healthcare system in a short period of time is admired by her peers, who have been in the field for many years. Over the past several years, Ms. Hennebury has contributed her expertise to many initiatives, committees, and task forces, and has played key planning support roles in both Sunnybrook’s and Toronto’s emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nResilient Communities\n\nMunicipalité des Îles-de-la-Madeleine\n\nIn November 2018, les Îles-de-la-Madeleine had suffered through a natural disaster caused by heavy winds, and significant snowfall that turned into freezing rain, which managed to leave 80% of the population without power. Additionally, strong waves put a halt to maritime transportation, and severely damaged telecommunications between the island and the rest of Québec. With no possibility of contacting emergency responders outside of the region, all of the municipal government services banded together to tend to the island’s citizens. Local firefighters were dispatched to support the vulnerable population, during the storm. Once radio communication was established, emergency responders quickly strategize to ensure public safety, and to request additional support. Within the next few hours, the Municipal Director General declared a state of emergency, a shelter at the City Hall’s community centre welcomed the public, and the emergency operations centre opened. The resourcefulness and strategic thinking of the Municipal Government led to an overnight turnaround to address the aggressive storm and its damages.\n\nInterAide\n\nInterAide is an initiative of the Association des directeurs généraux des municipalités du Québec (ADGMQ) that aims to strengthen the solidarity of Quebec municipalities, MRCs, intermunicipal boards and First Nations communities in emergency preparedness, by sharing human, material and documentary resources, as well as expertise. Thanks to the work of a small team and a relatively modest budget, this free collaboration platform covering the four dimensions of emergency management was launched in spring 2019. InterAide is essentially a secure application accessible 24/7. As a result, organizations have signed up can post their available emergency preparedness resources on the site, as well as conduct a search according to their needs. A model agreement for the establishment of an intermunicipal mutual aid plan is also available, so that organizations can plan such a strategy as part of their emergency response plan. Born at the suggestion of ADGMQ members who lived through the 2017 floods in particular, InterAide builds on the camaraderie and solidarity between participating organizations, which is particularly reassuring in a crisis. In addition, this platform strongly advertises the need to strengthen and continually improve your emergency preparedness plan. Together with the Quebec government and many other supporting partners, InterAide plays a crucial role in the field of emergency management and preparedness.\n\nCity of Sherbrooke\n\nAs part of the Public Safety Week in 2018, the City of Sherbrooke’s Fire Protection Services and the Communications Services organized a grand-scaled awareness campaign. They had 4 main objectives to convey: inform the population about public safety and the actions taken by the City of Sherbrooke, make the population aware of disasters and inform them of their responsibilities, encourage the public to take preventive actions that may be useful during an emergency, and strengthen the public’s ability to cope with disasters when they occur. The dedicated teams worked tirelessly to have a strong social media presence with a variety of public safety content, developed a video to be shared on social media, local theaters and the City’s website, held a press conference to launch the week, and invested in paid promotions.\n\nCole Hunking\n\nMr. Hunking joined the Village of Teslin (VOT) in 2012 as a foreman to manage Teslin’s municipal operations and services. One initiative he took on was to create VOT’s long-term flood mitigation and emergency response measures, which served to protect the community against the 2022 floods. Seeing the highest water levels since 1962 due to climate change and heavy snowfall, Mr. Hunking leadership and expertise put in place temporary and permanent flood protection measures, with the collaboration of stakeholders, property owners from within and outside of Teslin. He played an integral role in managing a project and workforce of this magnitude and helped the community through the highest lake levels it has seen in almost 60 years.\n\nCity of Mississauga\n\n(Andra Maxwell, Andrew Whittemore, Ben Gallagher, Deryn Rizzi, Ezio Savini, Geoff Wright, Helen Chin-Donofrio, Jodi Robillos, Paul Mitcham, Robert Trewartha, Robyn Heibert, Shari Lichterman, Tim Lindsay)\n\nThe City of Mississauga’s Emergency Management Program (EMP) have been prioritizing improving infrastructure, particularly maintaining, improving, and constructing new stormwater infrastructure, with funding support provided by Canada’s Disaster Mitigation and Adaption Fund. Additionally, they’ve played an important role in educating the public regarding emergency preparedness with various campaigns, such as Fire Prevention Week and Emergency Preparedness Week. Their resiliency is demonstrated with their supportive response to various emergencies that occur in their city, and quickly adapting to unforeseen circumstances, as shown by developing the City of Mississauga’s COVID-19 Framework, within 2 months of the pandemic declaration. The City of Mississauga’s EMP, composed of the City’s senior staff, have been recognized for their commitments to public safety with many well-earned awards.\n\nTsuut’ina First Nation\n\n(Minor Chief Kelsey Big Plume, Jerry Simon, Leslie M Wells-Starlight, Jordan Sage Big Plume, Councilor Emmet Crowchild, Councilor Paula Big Plume, Jonathan Pace, Jodi Two Guns)\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tsuut’ina Nation Leadership, Chief and Council, departments, and citizens demonstrated organizational excellence to effectively overcome the challenges that arose. In a timely manner, Nation leaders and members formed an Emergency team, with the main objectives of protecting and supporting their community. They established a trusting relationship with the community by consistently circulating essential COVID-19 information, undertook the testing, and vaccination, and supported those who had ongoing health issues, while isolation measures were in place. Additionally, the COVID-19 sick leave that was implemented early in the pandemic significantly reduced the spread in public areas and the workplace, and avoided wage loss. The whole community banded together to support one another, while cultural and traditional needs were always respected. Their instrumental efforts in proactively preparing for the oncoming pandemic helped minimize the severe effects of COVID-19.\n\nAmanda J. Dalton\n\nAmanda Dalton has served in the public service for over 32 years, and 13 of those as the Director, Logistics Support with the Alberta Emergency Management Agency (AEMA).
