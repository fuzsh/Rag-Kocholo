Ranking artistry is never easy, if not downright impossible. It’s undeniably subjective, contentious, and almost sure to offend. Of course, that’s never stopped us before.\n\nRankings were made taking into account overall ability and range, strength of the roles taken, longevity, influence, and awards won. Listed alongside are each actor’s best works, also loosely ranked according to how each exemplifies their talents. Actors must have appeared in at least one 21st century feature film for consideration as “modern.”\n\nRobert De Niro (born 1943): Young Vito Corleone in The Godfather II, Michael in The Deer Hunter, James Conway in Goodfellas, Jake La Motta in Raging Bull, Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Louis Gara in Jackie Brown, Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy, Noodles in Once Upon a Time in America, Johnny Boy in Mean Streets, Neil McCauley in Heat, Max Cady in Cape Fear, Ace Rothstein in Casino, Harry Tuttle in Brazil, Mendoza in The Mission, Frank Sheeran in The Irishman, Jack Walsh in Midnight Run, Al Capone in The Untouchables, Lorenzo in A Bronx Tale, Pat Sr in Silver Linings Playbook, Bernie Madoff in The Wizard of Lies, Jack Byrnes in Meet the Parents, Sam in Ronin, Louis Cyphre in Angel Heart, Father Bobby in Sleepers.\n\nAl Pacino (born 1940): Michael Corleone in The Godfather II, Michael Corleone in The Godfather, Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Tony Montana in Scarface, Lt.
