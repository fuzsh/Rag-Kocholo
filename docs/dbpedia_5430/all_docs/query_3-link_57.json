        "text": "Parachuting? Did you do any of the parachute stuff?\n\n(smiles) Well, we dont talk about that. I think its safe to say now I wont tell anybody about how the stunts are done, how effects are made, because thats all part of the enjoyment. You remember, as I do, when we were all a lot younger and watching Dr. No for the first time and how you were on the edge of your seat when the tarantula crawls up his chest  if you knew there was a piece of glass between him and the tarantula, the moments blown!\n\nBut you did some actual scuba work?\n\nYes, I did learn to scuba dive. Its important. I am involved in all the action. I am involved in every single, whatever you want to call it, action sequence or stunt sequence, I am involved in it all. Because its an action-thriller. Youve got to know that Bond is there! Youve got to be with Bond in his moments of danger. Otherwise youre conning the audience. And youve got to be able to get a camera in there. So I get involved in everything. That isnt to say that there arent stuntmen. But nobody does anything dangerous  the skill is to make it appear dangerous. But I did get out of the helicopter on the wire.\n\nUnlike some of the other actors who have played Bond, like a true theatre craftsman, I can really sense that youre searching for and using the subtext. For example, your reading of the line shaken not stirred was so fresh\n\nOh thats right, he uses it as a put down to her.\n\nI mean, we know youre ordering a drink, but the subtext is get out of here, I want to be alone with this woman. Does the director, John Glen, work with the actors at all in `bringing out the subtext, or is that your own work?\n\nIts a collaborative effort. I mean, in the movies the director must be the most harassed, under pressure man on the entire set. He doesnt want to be telling people how to do their jobs, hes got to be responsible for the movie and for getting it organised and shooting it and making his movie. He doesnt want to be telling the lighting cameraman how to light it, you know, he wants people to come to him with ideas to choose from, with alternatives, with input.\n\nDo you get any rehearsal time?\n\nWe get a bit, but you dont rehearse films much.\n\nDo you wish you had more rehearsal time?\n\nWell, sometimes and sometimes not. It depends on the nature of the scene. But what we will generally do, as on any film, is something that Ive always insisted on  I mean, I havent had to insist on it, its just the way one should work  you take the scene and you work the scene  maybe briefly, maybe quickly, but youll explore the scene and then you do it bit by bit. You have to know where youre going, you have to know whats what. But real rehearsal, no theres not a lot, and sometimes, it depends on the actor, the spontaneity, as long as you know what the scene is about, as long as you know what youve got to achieve in the scene, as long as you understand its physicality, its sometimes good not to rehearse because providing the aim is in your head, the spontaneity is important in itself. In theatre what you always notice is that sometimes first rehearsals are marvellous, but then you always get stale after a while; but then after a further while as a result of the exploration youve done, as a result of the conclusions youve come to, it starts to come fresh again. But you do go through that stale patch. That mustnt happen on film  youve got to capture moments of truth, aliveness and spontaneity.\n\nDo you think Bond could work on stage? If the opportunity arose, would you be interested in playing James Bond in a stage play, if it was done the right way?\n\nI couldnt really see it being done on stage. I mean its very essence is not introspective.\n\nSomething low key like CASINO ROYALE?\n\nWell, CASINO ROYALE, other people have the rights of course, but to make a film like CASINO ROYALE properly, it would be so outside what is currently accepted as James Bond on film, but it would make a bloody good film. Done as written, it would make a great film.\n\nI see it black and white, 1953\n\nDone as a period piece, yes, Id love to do that film, but other people have the rights, and it would be so far outside what people would expect of James Bond, who knows how it would be received  but its a cracking good story. But on the theatre, I couldnt imagine a James Bond story in the theatre.\n\nHow has playing James Bond changed your life, positively and negatively?\n\nHardly at all negatively  Im very happy to say that. Positively  professionally, of course, because the nature of our world is a commercial world and if you can have a commercial success then youll get a lot more offers.\n\nWhat about the legions of fans wholl hound you for autographs for the rest of your life?\n\nWell, thats all bollocks, isnt it? Its all bullshit. That is not true. You get all that when youre in a publicity situation. There might be a few people outside the hotel, but those are the professional autograph bounty hunters, or the paparazzi. But you or I could walk down the street here or in London, and people would certainly recognise me, but nobody is going to bother me. Most people on the street are healthy, decent people with their own sense of self respect and integrity and theyll treat you regularly if you behave regularly. If on the other hand you behave like an asshole, and go around with battalions of bodyguards and limousines and press and photographers and all that, and make an issue out of it, then its a different story. The majority of people who go and see a movie or play, if they like it, they come out and say that was a bloody good film or play, and so on, but theyre not going to go around to the stage door; theyre not going to write and ask for an autograph. Only a tiny percentage of them will. And the bulk of that percentage are people who really just want to say that was great and would you mind if I had an autograph. The kind of thing youre talking about is the tiniest minority, and its a bit odd anyway.\n\nThe Bond world has that group, you know, like Star Trek and Batman  its got its legion of fans. Its going to last.\n\nFrankly, I love it from some. Someone in the airport the other day just said, I saw the film  terrific  thanks, and walked on. That felt great. Thats how I would react, thats how you would react, if you see a performance you love, and if you ever met the guy, maybe  but even if you did, even if you were in a restaurant you might not want to disturb him having his dinner, youd just think Oh, theres.... But some people make a profession of being a fan. Its on the edge of abnormality in a lot of ways. Its gone beyond genuine care and respect. And theres not many of them. The press tend to build up all the screaming hoards. Sure, if you go to a premiere its par for the course, its everybodys game. New rules are set. But just going down the street to the pub, the real world is not a problem.\n\nSo you dont get much of that?\n\nAnd Im very pleased. As an actor you cant cut yourself off from your roots; you cant cut yourself off from the foundations of your work, and they are people - its people who you act, its people you take parts in stories, life is about people. If youre stuck up on some hill surrounded by barbed wire and guards  how could you be in our business if you remove yourself from our world?\n\nWhat was your first initiation into Bond  the books or the early films?\n\nIt was the film Dr. No.\n\nCan you remember what really struck you about that?\n\nWell, I dont remember how old I was, 15 or 16  1962, I must have been 15 when it came out. And it was splendid, if you think about how things were at that time; I dont know about America, but what kind of movies were you watching? War stories, drawing room comedies out of the fifties, and this film Dr. No just came and took the cinema by the scruff of the neck and banged it right down into today. As well as giving us a whole new area of adventure story to explore. And it was terrific. And then they went on. The miracle is that theyre still as popular as they ever were. That is in great part due to the essence of the stories, because they are hero stories, and hero stories have crossed all cultures, all history; people need heroes. But theyve always been done bloody well. Mr Broccolis never attempted to cheaply exploit a previous success. Hes always tried to make sure that every single film is done better than the one before or absolutely as best as it can be. The money spent, the talent...\n\nObjectively how do you think you compare to other Bonds?\n\nI dont think about it. Its a futile exercise. It becomes so complex. Its true that Im acting in a public sense, and I would include myself in that, that over 27 years of Bond movies, everyone has their own idea of what a Bond movie is. The fact that every single movie is tremendously different from the other. I mean how can you look at a film like From Russia With Love, a Bond film and compare it with Moonraker? Its such a different story and its such a different style. Connery was in a certain kind of movie and even the style of those movies began to alter. The first movies, if you look at them now, they have a different effect than they had when we watched them originally. Theyre of their time, but they were in general wonderful adventure thrillers. The Moore movies were light-hearted and tongue in cheek technological extravaganzas. You cant compare Moore and Connery because they were in such different films. I leave it for other people to make comparisons. The other interesting thing is, of course, and the problem we all face, is that if nobody had ever heard of a James Bond movie, if there had been no James Bond movies ever, and The Living Daylights or Licence To Kill or any of the movies was just released as a movie in its own right, the public opinion and appreciation and reaction would be completely different! Its because one is carrying all this history. Its like going out and playing Hamlet. How can anybody do Hamlet these days? Everyone knows the bloody story, nobodys surprised. Nobodys been taken by spontaneous reaction.\n\nGiven that Bond is something of a role model for young people...\n\nA role model?\n\nSure, when I was a kid and saw Goldfinger, I was buying all the toys and running around with my eyebrows raised and all that...\n\nConnery didnt raise his eyebrow! (laughs)\n\nDo you think Bond should de-emphasise any of his traits? Do you think you have a responsibility as an actor to...\n\nI dont think that Bond is a role model or that he should be a role model. Hes only part of a particular kind of story. I dont think anyone should grow up wanting to go around killing people. I dont think anyone should grow up wanting to be a secret agent...\n\nI did! (laughs)\n\nWell, were in a different world now arent we? In those days we all had a sense of intrigue and mystery and a sense of justice and rightness about our countries. In this day and age, I dont think people have too much regard for the work of their own secret services, do they? I think its certainly well worth believing in some kind of truth and justice. But Bond is not a paragon of virtue; hes a man riddled with vices and weaknesses as well as strength. But that is the nature of the man, and the nature of the world he lives in, but I dont think he should be a role model.\n\nDo you think he should practice safe sex on screen?\n\nI dont think weve ever seen sex in a Bond movie.\n\nLicence To Kill is probably the most violent Bond film ever made. Do you have any comment on that. What would you say to critics who might attack the film for being too violent?\n\nI wouldnt say anything to the critics  they have every right to their opinion. I dont know that it is the most violent Bond film, because you must judge it in terms of its time. Dont forget that Dr. No created an outrage, not only for its violence, but for its sex. But theres no sex in Dr. No at all, so what were they talking about. What they were actually talking about in 62, although we think of the sixties  the sixties didnt really begin until the mid sixties, 62 was still the fifties  what they were talking about was Ursula Andress coming out of the waves in a bikini! It was the first time wed seen a bikini! That was an outrage sexually! As for the violence  it was given an A certificate (in Britain this classification meant you had to be accompanied by an adult to see the film) because Bond gunned down an unarmed, defenceless man, you know - Youve had your six, now that for its day was considered a) wrong, morally wrong and b) very violent. Now everything in our movie, first of all Im pleased that our movie is more violent, because that is the world that James Bond must live in, and if you dont like that, Im sorry, dont go and see the film. Were not making movies for kids, were making movies for adults  its an adult fantasy that kids will enjoy. Yes I agree that kids can see this and they should go and see it, but were not making the film for 11 year olds! Were making the film for the child in all of us adults. It is a violent world he inhabits  its the very nature of a Bond movie. But whether its more or less violent is relatively speaking; I mean everything is classic, isnt it? I mean, people getting fed to the sharks, to the piranha fish, people getting set on fire, people being shot with harpoon guns, people being shot with bullets, Bond killing people  theyre all classic elements of the genre! In a modern world you do them to the height of your skills, and is it violent? Yes, it is violent, but you dont see the violence. What the film makers do, which is brilliant is they create the tension, the extreme tension of violence. The violence is all in the mind.\n\nIf Ian Fleming was still alive today and you had some influence on how he was going to take the character in a certain direction, would you have anything you would say to him? Where would you like to see Bond go or happen to him?\n\nWell, if Ian Fleming was alive today, Id love to spend time talking with him about the character, and Id love him to be involved in making the film, as Im sure everyone in our organisation would be. But I think Id leave the creative ideas to him.\n\nWhere do you think 007s future lies as far as the nineties are concerned?\n\nI dont know. Its always important to remember that he doesnt really operate as a spy or a member of the secret service. At the end of CASINO ROYALE, Fleming did make him a hero, the man who does it virtually alone. And that theme is universal  the hero theme, no matter what sort of hero youve got, a white knight, or a man of many paradoxes, youve just got to make sure the stories have some modern relevance and they mean something to a modern audience, and then rely on creativity and imagination to create those stories."
