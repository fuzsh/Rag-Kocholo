        "text": "Bond returns to his suite…and Tatanya is waiting.\n\nIt should be noted that this classic scene was used as an audition for James Bond in the 80’s for Roger Moore’s replacement. Here’s Sam Neill of Jurassic Park fame (part of the audition exists on video; the Tatayna stand-in seems to be Fiona Fullerton, who had played Pola Ivonava in View to A Kill; other variations of the audions had Maud Adams and Mary’Am D’abo.)\n\nJames Brolin….\n\nAnd finally Brosnan, winning the James Bond role….8 years too early.\n\nAnd of course, Dalton.\n\nAfter a brief bit of flirtation-pretty much verbatim from the novel (Including the “Mouth” line!)she says she’ll tell Bond about it in the morning and the two start their romance….but SPECTRE is filming, setting up for the “humiliating” death that Blofeld wants for the agent.\n\nBond next arranges for her to drop plans for the Consulate where the LEKTOR is kept at the Haggia Sophia. Connery dons the sunglasses here, and is pretty much a natural with it, pretty much like Daniel Craig is….I’m pretty sure Lazenby never wore any, Moore and Dalton were kind of awkward with theirs (Mainly because they doubled as gadgets, and his second pair was mainly used to hide) and Brosnan, although he came close, just didn’t quite have the ‘cool’ that Connery and Craig have with the sunglasses. This scene also illustrates the “Guardian angel” aspect of Grant, as he once again stops a spy from interfering with SPECTRE’s masterplan-while keeping to the shadows.\n\nAfter a brief scene with Kerim and Bond, wondering who killed the guy and Bey questioning Tatanya and Bond’s motives (But in a playful way)Our next spot is the Bosphurus straight (or not-it’s quite clear that in the scene there’s some fake backdrop involved, so this was probably shot at least in part in studio) a kind of funny scene where Bond is asking her about the details of the device (using a camera that is in fact a tape recorder, another of the film’s gadgets-this and the later shoe would start an escalation of gadgets within the series as the films go on), but Tatainya can’t help but wander off-topic about how sexy Bond is. Back home in London, M and his staff listen to the recorded conversation, and Moneypenny’s expression is pretty hilarious….\n\n…..as is M’s nervous reaction when Bond mentions a prior mission in Tokyo (Which is referenced later on in the film as well; film-wise, Bond wouldn’t go to Tokyo until “You Only Live Twice”) in response to Tatanya asking about “Western girls”. Moneypenny of course still listens even after she’s excused, and M has her send a wire to Bond, which tells him to make a go for the Lektor…\n\nBond next arrives at the consulate, checking the time is correct despite the assurances of a strict receptionist. Bond’s expression when Kerim detonates an explosion, causing the consulate to panic and Bond able to steal the LEKTOR-and Tatanya-in the confusion, is pretty funny too, as is his mouthed “Thank you” to the running receptionist.\n\nThe three-with LEKTOR in tow-escape onboard the Orient Express-but unfortunately are spotted by a Russian security man who also boards the train-and Grant’s onboard too….and so we leave the Istanbul portion of the film…with the film now becoming a bit more hitchcockian.\n\nNext: Murder on the Orient Express as the he starts to realize what a bloody fool he’s been…..\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n1986. After “View to a Kill” ended the Roger Moore era, the search was on for a new James Bond to replace Moore. Several actors were screened, including Sam Neill (who would later star in the Jurassic Park films) Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, who was the husband of former Bond girl actress Cassandra Harris (From For Your Eyes Only).\n\nHowever, due to the attention Pierce was getting due to the announcement, his TV series Remington Steele was unexpectedly renewed, and Brosnan had to drop out of the film due to that. However, he’d get a chance again with 1995’s “Goldeneye” and would play a successful-if somewhat typical-Bond for the next 7 years.\n\nIn his place, they cast the older, more intense-looking , Shakespearean actor Timothy Dalton, originally considered for the role in the 70’s before they went with George Lazenby (Dalton felt he was too young at the time).\n\nDalton decided to bring a somewhat different approach to the role than Moore, sort of going back to the novel roots of the character, with Bond as a man who-while still possessing charm and taste-was more psychologically wounded and grumpy than the more quipish superspy of the films (especially the 70’s and early 80’s) and more dangerous. Granted, it wasn’t a complete break-Bond still did the quips (although it seemed to be the weakest part of Dalton’s acting in the role), and Bond still had his gadgets. This was after all, pretty much in the same continuity as the other films.\n\nCraig’s portrayal would take a similar approach but would break more with the continuity, although they’ve been pretty much progressing towards more traditional Bond tropes over the years. But that’s a topic for another review.\n\n“Living” opens with a skydive over Gibraltar, where three 00’s are doing a mock infiltration of the radar installation there. However, somebody else is watching the group, and Bond witnesses him off an 00 agent, as well as two SAS soldiers participating in the exercise.\n\nBond then gives chase by jumping over the suspect’s escape vehicle, eventually managing to subdue the driver, but the ordinance explodes. Bond however safely parachutes onto a yacht, and asked to use a bored woman’s 1980’s giant cellphone to give MI6 a heads up. He also of course gets to do his famous introduction and of course a quip as he joins the lady for ….champagne. 😉\n\nLiving Daylight’s opening sequence-by the British band A-Ha well known for the crossover hit “Take on Me”-has a song somewhat in the vein of “View to A Kill”, a sort of British pop number. However, like “View” the credits don’t have too much to do with the plot or settings of the films, mainly focusing on the traditional Bond opening stuff of girls and guns. The film-John Barry’s final film as Bond composer due to health issues (plus perhaps problems working with Duran Duran and A-Ha). The Pretenders also provide two tracks which along with the title theme are heard in instrumental form mainly in the film’s action and romantic scenes: “Where has Everybody gone” and “If I had a Man”.\n\nThe next sequence is pretty much an adaptation of the Bond short story The Living Daylights, from which the film gets it’s title. However, certain elements are different and tie into the earlier story. Aiding in the defection of a Russian general Koskov (Jereon Krabbe) in Brataslava, he notices the person (Mary’am D’abo) who seems assigned to kill him-who he had witnessed as a cello artist a few minutes before-“doesn’t known one end of the rifle from another”-and he spares her by only shooting her arm.\n\nAssisting in the defection, Bond’s suspicions begin to grow that something’s not quite right once everybody returns to Britain, and Koskov starts to give off of a story that the KGB director General Pushkin (Replacing Gogol from the Roger Moore films) has decided to pursue an anti-spy agenda; with the 00 killed at the beginning of the film the first casualty. Also, a search for the mysterious cello girl turns up nothing.\n\nSoon after, when Bond leaves, Koskov is kidnapped by the mysterious Necros, who even gets his own fight scene without Bond. Necros is in many ways similar to Red Grant from From Russia With Love, switching accents and disguises and using a garrote at his primary weapon. Like Grant, he’s also part of a larger plot that is more than it appears.\n\nAlthough ordered to go after Pushkin, Bond-widening his search for the girl to musicians-is able to find the mysterious woman, and sets off after her as his lead. There’s also a nice Q scene which shows off the film’s primary gadget, the key ring finder.\n\nArriving back at Bratislava, Bond soon realizes that the defection might have been a hoax-as the rifle the woman-Kara Milovy-had, had blanks and was therefore useless. They’ve both been played for fools, but Bond decides to befriend Kara-posing as a friend of Koskov-to find out what’s really going on somehow. Here we get the film’s main car action sequence, with the Volante V8 being one of the more gadget-loaded cars in the series-with laser cutters, headlight missiles, outriggers, tire spikes, a jet booster and finally a self-destruct sequence.\n\nAs for Kara, while I’ve criticized Bond girls in the past who were kind of portrayed as ‘ditzy’, or shown to be competent in some areas but sort of incompetent in others (Tifanny Case, Mary Goodnight and most recently Stacey Sutton), I think Kara ‘works’ better because she’s sort of caught up as a naive, innocent victim in this spy game, and I think Mary’am D’abo plays that well. She isn’t quite as proactive as some Bond girls, but I think she gets some decent character development, and actually towards the end does some decent fighting, although she still makes some goofy mistakes.\n\nHe ends up taking her to Vienna and romancing her a bit as well. There’s some impressive location work here, and some film fans might remember a similar setting in the film “The Third Man” with Orson Welles. This might’ve been intentional on the behalf of director John Glen, who worked on that film.\n\nMeanwhile, it turns out that Koskov is pals with Necros and crazed arms dealer Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker)-the defection and recapture was fake-and that Pushkin is actually investigating them for misusing the funds for some scheme.\n\nBond also starts to suspect things aren’t right when he gets a fellow British agent-Saunders-who accompanied him in the film’s opening-to trace some of Koskov’s spending, linking him with Whitaker. Unfortunately, Saunders is killed by Necros, but not before he uncovers the next link-In Tangier. It’s in Tangier where we get a tense scene where Bond questions Pushkin (Played by John Rhys-Davies of Indiana Jones and Lord Of The Ring’s fame) about what’s going on-and it turns out they’re pretty much on the same side, more or less-Koskov has been trying to misled MI6 into thinking Pushkin is the enemy, in order to keep him from discovering their operation.\n\nPretending to kill Pushkin with the aid of expert shooting and fake blood, Bond and Pushkin let Koskov make his next move, although Bond unwillingly attracts the attention of his old friend Felix Leiter, who has been monitoring the situation. There’s also one of the film’s best shots, a pseudo-gunbarrel with Bond in the literal spotlight.\n\nOn a side note, I feel that John Terry’s Felix Leiter is one of the weaker ones in the series. He doesn’t really get that much to do and his acting is pretty flat. Thankfully, Licence to Kill, Dalton’s next films would give us a much better Felix-and one we’ve had before in Live and Let Die-David Hedison.\n\nUnfortunately Kara contacts Koskov, and briefly is tricked by him into believing Bond is a bad guy-until Kara comes to her senses-but not before Bond is drugged and captured.\n\nBond is then taken to an Afghan Soviet air base, where the true extent of Koskov’s plan is revealed-he’s holding a gun and drug running operation with Whitaker’s help-and when Pushkin got too nosy he came up with the whole fake defection to get Pushkin out of the way. Bond and Kara are able to escape, and eventually storm the base with the help of the Afghan resistance, in the film’s largest action scene as Bond struggles to steal the Soviet plane full of drugs while Kara and the rebels attack the base. After getting the plane up, Bond still has to deal with a stowaway-ed Necros, and both find themselves hanging for their lives in the film’s best stunt.\n\nWhich, on a side note, I’m pretty sure inspired a similar scene in the video game Uncharted 3.\n\nIt was even used for the game of the year re-release!\n\nAnyway, Bond is able to get things under control but loses the plane, but manages to escape in the nick of time. He then returns to Tangier to take care of Whitaker, in a sort of lackluster final showdown. Whitaker’s far from a memorable Bond villain-he’s mainly campy bluster. Indeed Koskov isn’t either, and the villains and their plot is considered one of the weaker elements of the film (Which otherwise has a good Bond in Dalton and great action sequences that far surpass it’s predecessor View To A Kill). Baker of course would eventually play Jack Wade in the first two Pierce Brosnan Bond films.\n\nThen of course we get the happy ending-Kara gets a new job performing at Vienna, with many admirers including former KGB guy Gogol, and of course Bond gets her at the end.\n\nOverall, Living Daylights is a bit of fresh air and a return to Bond’s espionage roots after “View to A Kill” and the somewhat over the top plots and humor of many of the Roger Moore films. There’s still a bit of the Bond tropes-the gadgets, mostly-but at the time, this was pretty much a cool new direction for the series. Unfortunately, things didn’t quite work out as originally planned, as we’ll find out in the next review.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNote: Some plot spoilers for the latest Bond film, SPECTRE below.\n\nIn addition to the full Bond novels, Ian Fleming also composed a series of short stories, many of which were expanded and adapted into films, or at the very least shared their title (this is pretty much the case with “Quantum of Solace”, in which the short story shares the title and little else, except for pretty much the theme finding ‘solace’-in the film, Bond after bringing those partially responsible for Vesper’s death to justice, in the novel, it relates to a story Bond is told about a troubled couple). Apart from a partial French setting, From a View To A Kill and the film A View To A Kill only share the title (minus the “From” part in the movie). These were largely collected in two books-“For Your Eyes Only” (Which contains the title story and Risico, which were incorporated into the film of the same name, as featured in an earlier post)-and “Octopussy and the Living Daylights”. We’ll look at how some details of these stories relate to the films (With the exception of those already covered.)\n\nThe Hildebrand Rarity deals with a murder mystery onboard the yacht the Wavekrest, where a millionare, Milton Krest, has invited Bond on a fishing expedition. Krest is portrayed as a sort of unpleasent person, and is eventually murdered by someone on the ship.\n\nLicence to Kill featured Krest as one of the henchmen of Franz Sanchez, helping him maim Bond’s friend Felix Leiter (and also killing Bond’s other friend, “Sharkey” later on) and operating a cover operation for his smuggling. While investigating Krest, Bond is able to make away with Sanchez’s money being held by Krest, which becomes key to his revenge against Sanchez (and also used by Bond to implicate Krest later on). Krest is portrayed as even more unpleasant here, especially with him helping out Sanchez.\n\n“Octopussy” the novel, deals with Bond tracking down Major Dexter Smythe, a man who stole gold from an icy mountain during World War II and killed his German guide. Bond tracks down Smythe-as the guide killed-Hannes Oberhauser-was a man who taught Bond how to ski, hence giving Bond a personal interest in the case-but only intends to arrest him, until Smythe is killed by a poisonous fish, and then dragged under water by his own pet Octopus (Which is where the name comes from novel wise).\n\nHere’s where things get interesting. Not only was Smythe’s story incorporated into the plot of the film with the same name-as it served for backstory for the film’s main Bond girl, Octopussy (His pet name for his daughter, instead of an actual Octopus)….\n\n….but it also was worked into the backstory of the latest James Bond film, SPECTRE. In SPECTRE, we learn that Daniel Craig’s Bond was in fact, adopted by Hannes Oberhauser, and raised as a son, which left his biological son, Franz, neglected. Franz, like Smythe, killed Hans, faked his death and later reemerged to torment his stepbrother as the “Craigverse” version of Ernest Stravro Blofeld.\n\nThe next story, “Property of a Lady” also is part of the inspiration for the film Octopussy. Early in the film, Bond is attending an auction for a Faberge egg, trying to find it’s connection to the murder of a fellow OO agent in Berlin-a complicated plot involving not only Jewelry smuggling but also a rogue Russian general in cahoots with the film’s villain (With Octopussy and her all-female smuggler group being played). The short story deals with bidding for the egg being cover for the payment of a double agent.\n\nThe Living Daylights short story is the foundation for part of the plot of the film, with Bond assigned to be on the lookout for a sniper. In the novel, it’s to help a British agent escape from East Berlin. In the film, it’s to help a Russian general defect (Although things eventually turn out to be more complicated than that) in Bratislava.\n\nIn the novel, the sniper disguises herself as a cellist at a local orchestra. In the film, the woman-Kara Milovy-actually is a cellist being set up by her boyfriend (The general), and as Bond puts it, “Doesn’t know one end of the rifle from the other”-which raises’s Bonds suspicions that the defection might be phony.\n\nIn both cases, Bond hesitates and only wounds the sniper, upsetting Bond’s fellow contact and prompting the exchange from Bond.\n\n“Whoever she was, I must have scared the Living Daylights out of her!”\n\nFinally, we have 007 in New York, sort of a short, funny side story. The only major connection to the films is the name Solange, used for an ill-fated Bond girl in Casino Royale, who is killed by Le Chiffre after she lets Bond know the location of her husband, one of Le Chiffre’s henchmen.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service is an interesting sort of turning point in the Bond films. After Sean Connery left the series due to tiring of the role (and also due to the immense media coverage of You Only Live Twice damaging his privacy), it was decided to cast a new James Bond. The man they chose was Australian model George Lazenby, whose only acting job had been a Chocolate commercial.\n\n“This never happened to the other Fella”.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews, and Lazenby, due to several factors, quit after one film, leaving the producers to briefly re-cast Connery as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever before finding a more permanent replacement with Roger Moore. The legacy of Lazenby and the film adaptation of OHMSS have often been disputed; although it’s often agreed it’s fared better in the years since it’s release, and that Lazenby, while not an actor, does okay with the material. The film’s storyline and one-time director (Peter Hunt), as well as lack of a sung theme, instead using a classic orchestral piece by John Barry (Who scored most of the films up to 1987) also give it a fairly unique place in the Bond film canon.\n\nIn both the novel and film, Bond is in pursuit of Blofeld and SPECTRE (in the film, after the events of You Only Live Twice, in the novel, Thunderball), as part of “Operation Bedlam”-but the search for the criminal has reached a dead end, and M isn’t happy, putting Bond on temporary leave. Bond also tries to help a troubled young woman, Countess Teresa Di Vincenzo. Unexpectedly, her father, Draco, is a criminal himself, but more of a noble man who, in exchange for Bond courting his daughter, is willing to help him find Blofeld. (Although Bond is really interested in her, despite the incentive).\n\nBond eventually finds a clue to the villain, that he seems to be seeking to be declared a count by the coat of arms, but that those claims need to be confirmed. Bond goes undercover as Sir Hilary Bray, a Coat of Arms member. It’s also here that Bond learns his family motto “The World Is Not Enough” (Which became the name of the third Brosnan Bond film).\n\nBond goes to the mountaintop resort and clinic Piz Gloria, where he finds out that Blofeld is brainwashing young woman to try to ‘cure them’ of phobias (but in fact his real aim is far more devious). There’s a slight continuity error in the film here. In the novel timeline, Blofeld and Bond have not yet met each other face to face, and it makes sense that they don’t recognize each other.\n\nHowever, film-wise, they had already met each other in the previous film, You Only Live Twice. Although they both look different-Bond now looks like George Lazenby, and Blofeld now looks like Telly Savalas and lacks the scar over his eye (He’s still got that cat though!).\n\nBond’s cover is blown eventually in both cases. In the novel, it’s because a man-Shaun Campbell-another MI6 agent-is captured who recognized Bond. This same man appears in the movie, but he mainly is Bond’s backup, and Bond ignores him to maintain his cover. In both cases Shaun is killed by Blofeld.\n\nHowever, Bond’s cover is blown differently in the film, once it’s clear he’s not Sir Hilary Bray because respected Coat of Arms men don’t romance women, like he was doing at the clinic (Bond in other words, being Bond). Blofeld then monologues his plan to Bond, that the girls have been brainwashed to spread a deadly disease that will destroy livestock and grain products, and eventually humans if Blofeld doesn’t get his way. In the book, this is mainly discovered later during a debriefing at MI6 after Bond escapes.\n\nIn both cases Bond attempts to escape by ski, eventually making his way to the village below, but with SPECTRE in hot pursuit. Thankfully, Tracy shows up in the nick of time.\n\nHowever, whereas in the book she mainly helps him get to a local airport, the movie adds in more action, with a car chase which spills over into an actual race:\n\nand then, after proposing to Tracy, she is captured by Blofeld after a ski chase.\n\nBoth film and novel end with Bond, with the help of Draco, returning to Piz Gloria with an assault force to take down Blofeld’s operation, ending with Blofeld injured but able to escape….and then Bond and Tracy are married.\n\nBut their happiness is short-lived. Blofeld and his henchman drive-by and shoot up the Bonds’ car. Bond is unscathed, but Tracy is dead from a fatal bullet wound. As a shocked Bond cradles his dead wife, he says to an arriving police officer:\n\n“It’s all right. It’s quite all right, really. She’s having a rest. We’ll be going on soon. There’s no hurry, you see. We have all the time in the world.”\n\nThe credits then show the damaged window from the bullet.\n\nThe film series wouldn’t have this depressing an ending until “Casino Royale”. Bond’s wife would be mentioned in passing in future films, or alluded to many times. What’s worse, in License to Kill, Bond’s friend Felix is maimed (A similar thing happened in the novel of Live and Let Die) and his new wife killed by the villains as well-perhaps providing some of the impetus for Bond’s quest for revenge in the film.\n\nNext: The Spy Who Loved Me…which is *really* different.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
