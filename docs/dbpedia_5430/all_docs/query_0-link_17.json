Eighteen stakeholder societies were identified, and formal request-for-participation and member nomination letters were sent to those organizations. Participating entities selected panel members and an ad hoc steering committee selected preliminary questions, which were then revised by the full committee. Each question was assigned to a module composed of 4–5 members, who worked with the Subcommittee Lead and the Committee Chairs on preliminary versions, which were sent to the full committee after revisions. We used a modified Delphi method whereby the questions were sent to the committee en bloc and comments were returned in a non-blinded fashion to the Chairs, who incorporated the comments and sent out revised versions until consensus was reached. Before commencing, it was agreed that a recommendation would be noted with >50% agreement among committee members, but a consensus recommendation would require ≥75% agreement.\n\nResults\n\nTwenty questions were selected, with 100% consensus achieved in committee on 17 topics. Among participating organizations, 14 of 15 that voted approved or supported the guidelines en bloc, with 14 questions being approved with no dissensions or abstentions. Specific questions addressed included the value of clinical presentation and imaging in selecting patients for procedures, whether conservative treatment should be used before injections, whether imaging is necessary for blocks, diagnostic and prognostic value of medial branch blocks and intra-articular joint injections, the effects of sedation and injectate volume on validity, whether facet blocks have therapeutic value, what the ideal cut-off value is for designating a block as positive, how many blocks should be performed before radiofrequency ablation, the orientation of electrodes, whether larger lesions translate into higher success rates, whether stimulation should be used before radiofrequency ablation, how best to mitigate complication risks, if different standards should be applied to clinical practice and trials, and the indications for repeating radiofrequency ablation.\n\nConclusions\n\nCervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation may provide benefit to well-selected individuals, with medial branch blocks being more predictive than intra-articular injections. More stringent selection criteria are likely to improve denervation outcomes, but at the expense of false-negatives (ie, lower overall success rate). Clinical trials should be tailored based on objectives, and selection criteria for some may be more stringent than what is ideal in clinical practice.\n\nKeywords: analgesia, anesthesia, local, anticoagulants, injections, spinal, neck pain\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are few subjects in interventional pain and spine medicine as controversial as the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of neck pain. Neck and posterior head pain have a high prevalence rate in both developed and undeveloped regions, being particularly common in the USA, Western Europe, East Asia, Northern Africa, and the Middle East.1 A systematic review estimated the annual and lifetime prevalence rates to be 37.2% (range 16.7–75.1%), and 48.5% (range 14.2–71%), respectively.2 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study, spine pain (including neck and low back) is the most common cause of disability in North America and globally for people 25–64 years of age.3 Age is positively related to the risk of neck pain, obesity is probably unrelated, and women are more likely to experience neck pain.1 4 When prevalence is broken down by spine joint or segment, the cited frequency of atlanto–axial (AA) joint pain ranges from as low as 16% to as high as 60% in patients with suspected cervicogenic headaches.5 Cervical facet (also known as zygapophysial or zygapophyseal) joints are considered to be the primary source of pain in 26–70% of patients with chronic neck pain6–9 and 54–60% of neck pain following whiplash injury.10–12 The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most common clinically implicated levels in neck pain,12–14 with C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 being the most radiologically affected.15 16 The wide disparity in reported prevalence raises questions regarding the use and accuracy of historical and physical exam signs as non-interventional diagnostic reference standards. The poor correlation between facet joint pathology on imaging and neck pain provokes further debate17 and disagreements with insurance payers. For diagnostic and/or prognostic criteria, the literature on the ideal patient response for designating a block as ‘positive’ and the optimal number of blocks that should be performed before cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment is contentious and inconsistent, with no consensus emerging.18–23\n\nCervical spine joint interventions are commonly performed in interventional pain practices, with hundreds of thousands per year being performed in the USA alone.24 For cervical medial branch RFA, a recent review of the Medicare claims and encounters databases from 2000 to 2018 demonstrated a 112% overall increase in utilization (8.7% annually) over the past 9 years.24 Along with increased utilization, there was also a reciprocal increase in expenditures on cervical facet interventions of 53% from 2009 to 2018; however, the cost per patient declined 7% over this same time interval (0.8% annual reduction).25 The utilization of facet interventions is considerably higher than the most commonly cited prevalence rates.26 Although overall utilization of facet interventions is increasing at a rapid pace, there is a discrepancy in the growth of medial branch blocks (MBB) and intra-articular (IA) joint injections (0.5% annual growth) and cervical medial branch RFA (8.7% annual growth).24 This disconnect may reflect practice changes such as decreased use of cervical facet IA joint injections, a reduction in the number of diagnostic blocks used before medial branch RFA, or a higher rate of prognostic blocks designated as positive. Increasing utilization alters the risk to benefit ratio of treatments; this, along with inconsistencies in practice and the lack of widely accepted consensus guidelines, has led to increased scrutiny on the part of government regulatory agencies and insurance payers. The Spine Intervention Society (SIS) and the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) have published guidelines on the performance of cervical facet blocks and RFA,18 27 but these rigorous criteria have not been followed in recent randomized controlled and uncontrolled trials (RCTs).19 28 Whereas stringent selection criteria have been associated with high medial branch RFA success rates,21 the increased false-negative rate that inevitably accompanies strict diagnostic criteria and a host of other factors have resulted in an urgent need for guidelines to inform cervical joint interventions in clinical practice and trials. These factors include the absence of safer and more effective alternatives for neck pain (ie, spinal fusion and chronic opioid therapy were less scrutinized when many of the previous cervical facet studies were published), the publication of few high-quality clinical trials, rising utilization which alters the risk to benefit ratio, and questions surrounding the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic paradigms, which vary from country to country. We aimed to develop pragmatic guidelines that can be used to inform clinical care, improve the quality of research, and assist payers with clinical practice pathways and authorization decisions.\n\nMethods\n\nThe decision to convene a multispecialty and multinational Cervical Joint Working Group to develop atlanto–occipital (AO), atlanto–axial (AA), and cervical facet joint intervention guidelines was approved by the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA-PM) in August 2020. Fifteen stakeholder academies and societies as well as other organizations (eg, US Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs) with a vested interest in cervical spine joint interventions were identified, and formal request-for-participation and member nomination letters were sent to those societies who approved involvement in September 2020. A single pain society (US Association for the Study of Pain, USASP) declined to participate. Organizations were asked to consider a candidate’s expertise, clinical experience, academic interests, and diversity in their nomination process. Each sponsoring society (AAPM and ASRA-PM) nominated two members and participating organizations nominated one member (see online supplemental appendix A for a list of participating academies, societies, and respective representatives). The sole ad hoc member (MSW) had been preliminarily designated to represent USASP before their Board of Directors declined to participate. For the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs representatives, the Chairperson of the Department of Anesthesia at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and Director of the VA National Pain Management Program nominated individuals.\n\nSupplementary data\n\nrapm-2021-103031supp001.pdf\n\nThe Cervical Joint Working Group was charged with preparing guidelines on the use of AO, AA, medial branch and facet joint blocks, and medial branch RFA that spanned the entire spectrum of care to include patient selection, optimizing accuracy, interpreting results, and risk mitigation. Questions and formats were developed by the committee co-chairs (RWH, SPC) based on input from the working group and refined during the initial video-conference call. Guidelines for individual study questions were developed by subcommittees composed of 4–5 members, with one or two persons designated as the ‘leads’ responsible for task delegation. Once a subcommittee came to a consensus on an answer, the working group chairs assisted with editing and formatting, and the section was sent to the entire committee for open-forum comments and revisions. A modified Delphi method was used to tabulate comments, incorporate changes, and converge the answers towards consensus over rounds of teleconference or electronic correspondence. At the initial conference call, the working group decided that >50% panel agreement was sufficient to report a recommendation, but ≥75% agreement was required for consensus, consistent with the Lumbar Facet Intervention Guidelines.29 After the working group completed the guidelines, the document was sent to participating organizations’ boards of directors for approval, with only minor changes permitted at this stage. For organizational agreement, we determined that consensus required at least ≥75% agreement. At both the committee and organizational levels, dissensions and abstentions were tabulated for each question.\n\nSearch engines used during composition of the various sections included PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, in addition to examination of the reference sections of all manuscripts. Additional articles were identified by searching in topically related new journals that are not yet indexed by Science Citation Index or found within PubMed. There were no limitations on language or types of articles used to develop the guidelines, such that experimental studies were considered for the sections on physical examination, anatomy and technical parameters, and case reports were considered for sections pertaining to risk mitigation and complications. Keywords used to address guideline topics were tailored to individual questions and included ‘atlanto-occipital’, ‘atlantooccipital’, ‘atlanto-axial’, ‘atlantoaxial’, ‘cervicogenic’, ‘headache’, ‘facet’, ‘neck pain’, ‘zygapophysial’, ‘zygapophyseal’, ‘radiofrequency’, ‘denervation’, ‘ablation’, and ‘arthritis’, among others. In accordance with the Lumbar Facet Intervention Guidelines,29 conclusions for each topic were graded on a scale from A to D, or as insufficient, according to the US Preventative Services Task Force grading of evidence guidelines, with the level of certainty rated as high, moderate, or low ( ).30\n\nTable 1\n\nCertainty of net benefitMagnitude of net benefitSubstantialModerateSmallZero/negativeHighABCDModerateBBCDLowInsufficient\n\nTable 2\n\nGradeDefinitionSuggestions for practiceAOur committee recommends this treatment, test or strategy to improve outcomes.

The studies assess the effects of the treatment, test, or other intervention on treatment or other relevant outcomes. The conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studiesModerateThe available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as:\n\nThe number, size, or quality of individual studies\n\nInconsistency of findings across individual studies\n\nLimited generalizability of findings to individuals with suspected cervicogenic headache and/or cervical facetogenic pain\n\nHigh likelihood of bias\n\nLack of coherence in the chain of evidence\n\nAs more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and that change may be large enough to alter the conclusionLowThe available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on treatment and other outcomes of interest. Evidence is insufficient because of:\n\nThe limited number or size of studies\n\nImportant flaws in study design or methods\n\nInconsistency of findings across individual studies\n\nGaps in the chain of evidence\n\nHigh likelihood of bias\n\nFindings not generalizable to individuals with suspected cervicogenic headache and/or cervical facetogenic pain\n\nLack of information on important outcome measures\n\nMore information may allow estimation of effects on treatment outcomes\n\nThis system, which has been modified for use in interventional pain management guidelines drafted by the ASRA-PM, AAPM, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), ASIPP, and the International Neuromodulation Society (INS),31–34 was chosen over others because of its flexibility35 36 which permits high-grade recommendations in the absence of high-quality level I studies, which are challenging to conduct for invasive procedures.37\n\nQuestion 1: Can history and physical examination be used to identify painful AO or AA joints or to select people for prognostic blocks?\n\nAO and AA joint disease may be a source of both neck pain and headache. Accurate diagnosis and management of neck and head pain can be challenging. Pain may be referred from other cervical sources including cervical intervertebral discs, cervical facet joints, ligaments, fascia, and muscles. Detailed history and physical examination can be valuable to help distinguish the etiology of the pain and to target diagnostic and therapeutic injection targets.38 39\n\nRelevant anatomy of the AO and AA joints\n\nThe AO and AA joints are unique in the cervical spine. The AO and AA joint complexes allow for a significant range of motion (ROM) between the head and mid-cervical spine. The AO and AA joints are innervated by the ventral rami of C1 and C2, respectively.40–42 The AO joint is a synovial articulation between the occipital bone and the first cervical vertebra (the atlas). The joint is formed superiorly by the convex occipital condyle and inferiorly by the concave superior articular surface of the C1 lateral mass. The AA joint complex consists of three joints, two lateral and one median. The lateral AA joint is formed by the superior articular surface of C2 (the axis) and the inferior articulating surface of C1. The median (or middle) AA joint is a pivot joint that represents the articulation between the odontoid process and the posterior surface of the anterior arch of the atlas anteriorly and the transverse ligament posteriorly. In this document, the AA joint refers to the lateral AA joint, unless otherwise specified.\n\nC1 does not have a vertebral body and is not separated from adjacent levels by an intervertebral disc.43 In addition to the five main ligamentous structures of the spinal column (anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligament, and supraspinous ligament), the AO joint complex has additional overlying ligaments including the AO ligament, tectorial membrane, apical ligament, and the cruciate ligaments (comprised of the transverse ligament and a superior and inferior band) which provide stability and flexibility, but can also be a pain generator.43 The AA joint complex has additional ligaments as well, namely the anterior and posterior AA ligaments, transverse ligament of the atlas, apical ligament, alar ligaments, and tectorial membrane. These ligaments can become calcified in elderly people, leading to decreased ROM and increased neck pain.44\n\nThe AO and AA joints, as described above, provide mechanical strength to stabilize the head, while allowing for complex movements of the cervical spine. Approximately 50% of total cervical spine flexion and extension occurs at the AO articulation.45 46 Over 50% of all cervical spine rotation is provided by the dens of C2 which articulates with C1 and transverse ligaments.45 46 The synovial joints at C1 and C2 rely more on ligamentous stabilizers because they do not have intervertebral discs to provide stabilization.47 48 The weight from the occipital condyles transfers the load from the occiput to the C1 lateral masses and then onto the C2 lateral masses.46\n\nReferral patterns for pain arising from AO and AA joints\n\nThe diagnosis of pain arising from the AO and AA joints has been less well studied than C2–3 through C7–T1 cervical facet joint pain. As seen in , pain arising from C1–C2 most often occurs in the suboccipital region, commonly extending cephalad into the head or caudad into the upper neck. Referred pain patterns have been studied in healthy volunteers without neck pain as well as in those with proven cervical joint pain.49–51\n\nDreyfuss et al 50 studied pain referral patterns in asymptomatic patients from provocative testing of the AO and lateral AA joints via fluoroscopically-guided IA injections. The authors confirmed the nociceptive ability of the AO and AA synovial joints and found that AA injections resulted in consistent referral patterns whereas the AO referral patterns varied significantly.\n\nReferral patterns from asymptomatic patients based on pain provocation are consistent with those from symptomatic patients, based on pain relief after injection. AO-mediated pain has consistently been reported as suboccipital, but may extend to the frontal area, slightly anterior to the vertex.50 The referral zone approaches—but does not include—the ear in most cases. Other patterns that have been described are isolated suboccipital pain, suboccipital and supraorbital pain, and rarely the entire hemicranium.50\n\nThe spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve extends caudally to the dorsal horn of the first 3–4 cervical spinal nerves.38 52 53 The trigeminal nerve and the upper three cervical nerves provide afferent fibers to the trigeminocervical nucleus, which may account for the overlapping pain patterns described in AO and AA joint pain which include upper neck pain that spreads to the oculofrontotemporal area.38 54 55\n\nThe pain referral patterns of the AA joint reported by Dreyfuss et al 50 are consistent with prior studies.56 57 Pain emanating from the AA joint was described as discrete unilateral pain at the occipito–cervical junction, retro–mastoid area, and in the upper cervical region.50 56 57 This is in contrast to pain from the AO joint reported in the same study which tended to radiate more cephalad towards the vertex of the head, and occasionally into the temporal and posterior auricular areas.50 Cooper et al 49 reported that AA pain often encompassed the region of the posterior ear and orbit. It sometimes encompassed the ear itself and was rarely experienced in the temporoparietal area. The pain quality has been described as ‘deep’, ‘boring’, and ‘aching’.56 Patients with AA joint pain often report occipital headaches, suboccipital neuralgia, and sometimes pain radiating to the shoulder. Radicular pain or a history suggestive of myelopathy is an uncommon finding; however, these have been reported in rare cases of C1–C2 pseudoarticulation.58–61\n\nHistorical features suggestive of lateral AA joint pain include occipital or suboccipital pain, focal tenderness over the suboccipital area, focal tenderness over the transverse process of C1, and pain provoked by active or passive rotation of C1 on C2.62 Using these features, Narouze et al 62 treated 32 patients who were screened from a total of 115 patients referred with cervicogenic headache. Only 15 of those 32 patients experienced complete pain relief following an IA block, thereby confirming the diagnosis and yielding a positive predictive value (PPV) of 47% using historical and examination criteria. This low PPV may be explained by the fact that cervicogenic headache can be referred from any structure innervated by the upper three cervical spinal nerves including the AO joint, median AA joint, C2–3 disc, and C2–3 facet joints.63 The lateral AA joint may account for approximately 16% of patients with occipital headaches.5 Although clinical signs are consistently present, they are not specific enough to establish a definitive diagnosis and the authors recommend confirming the presumptive pain generator with a diagnostic IA block, especially before considering surgical options. Based on a cohort study involving 34 patients in which 21 responded to lateral AA joint injections, Aprill et al 5 concluded that the only way to confirm whether a joint is painful is by anesthetizing the joint. They found that history in conjunction with physical examination has a PPV of only 60% for pain stemming from the AA joint, meaning that without diagnostic blocks a substantial proportion of patients will be misdiagnosed ( ).\n\nTable 4\n\nAuthor, yearPatientsDesignResultsCommentsBusch and Wilson, 1989168 25 pts with head and neck pain of which 2 pts received LA and steroid AO and AA joints injectionsCase series/ retrospectivePain relief in both cases ranged from 3 weeks to 4 months (one patient received serial injections).

No quantification of pain relief was provided\n\nPhysical examination of the neck to diagnose AO and AA pain\n\nThe AA joint complex accounts for 60% of cervical rotational movement.64 The pivot articulation occurs between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the transverse ligament of the atlas and the anterior arch. Common historical and physical examination findings of AA dysfunction include limited ROM during rotation as well as flexion and extension depending on the extent of tectorial membrane impairment. In more advanced cases, examination signs can include severely restricted rotation and lateral flexion of the cervical spine to the affected side,65 crepitus, prominent tenderness at the occipito–cervical junction, craniocervical kyphosis, and torticollis.66 The presence of gait abnormalities, radicular symptoms, and audiovisual symptoms are unlikely to be related to isolated AO or AA dysfunction.\n\nAlthough the AO and AA joints can be visualized on imaging, including plain radiographs, imaging cannot confirm the origin of pain. Normal imaging does not rule out arthropathy and radiographic joint abnormalities are incapable of identifying a painful joint. For example, in a study involving 400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 45.8% had radiographic evidence of AA involvement but only 45.4% of those individuals had neck pain.67 Paradoxically, greater AA joint ventral subluxation was associated with less pain. Alternative imaging including bone window CT views of the AA joint, MRI, or cervical myelography may be needed to rule out concomitant alternative cervical spine pathology.57\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn summary, there are no pathognomonic historical signs or physical examinations that can reliably predict response to AA or AO joint blocks in individuals with chronic neck pain. AA and AO joint pain typically manifest in the C1, C2, or trigeminal nerve distribution, with AA pain having more reproducible and consistent symptoms than AO joint pain. We conclude that history and physical examination cannot reliably identify painful AO or AA joints, but can guide injection decisions which could confirm the AO and AA joints as pain generators: grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.\n\nQuestion 2: Can history and physical examination be used to identify a painful facet joint, or to select people for prognostic blocks?\n\nCervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most common clinically implicated in neck pain,12 68 69 while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration15 16; injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain (see below for whiplash). Frequently used criteria for considering patients for prognostic blocks include neck pain of moderate-to-severe intensity (score ≥4 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale) radiating to the head, shoulder, or upper arm for at least 6 weeks in the absence of focal neurological findings. The targeted facet joints are usually decided on based on patient report and tenderness on examination, sometimes performed under fluoroscopy. In patients who are postsurgical, adjacent segments are often affected after arthrodesis, and treated levels bear more force during extension following disc arthroplasty.70 Factors that decrease the probability of the cervical facet joints being pain generators include prominent pathology of other likely sources of neck pain such as markedly degenerated or herniated intervertebral discs and symptomatic spinal stenosis.20 In a study by Cohen et al 20 that evaluated historical and physical examination features associated with successful cervical medial branch RFA outcomes, pain radiating to the occiput and a history of headaches increased the probability of treatment failure. In this study, paraspinal tenderness, but not neck pain worsened by facet loading (extension and rotation of the cervical spine), was highly predictive of a successful outcome, with two-thirds of patients with paraspinal tenderness reporting a successful outcome versus the same proportion of those without tenderness failing RFA.\n\nImportance of whiplash as a cause of cervical facet joint pain\n\nMechanical injury is often an initiating factor for cervical facet joint pain.71 The cervical facet joints were identified as a source of neck pain in 54% (95% CI 40% to 68%) of individuals (as confirmed by dual diagnostic MBB) in a study performed in patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). However, the incidence of cervical facet joint pathology contributing to neck pain as calculated based on patients who completed this study was 71%.10 12 WAD represent a spectrum of symptoms arising from an initial whiplash injury that usually occurs as a result of a motor vehicle collision (MVC).72 Smith and colleagues73 enrolled patients with Quebec Task Force WAD grade II injury (ie, neck pain and associated symptoms in the presence of objective non-neurological physical signs such as decreased ROM and point tenderness)72 in a cross-sectional study comparing physical and psychological features of responders and non-responders to cervical IA facet injections or MBB. The authors found that both responders and non-responders with WAD experienced increased hypersensitivity, decreased ROM, and increased superficial muscle activity compared with controls, but there were no differences in outcomes-based response to facet blocks. Most individuals with WAD as a result of an MVC are reported to be either drivers or front-seat passengers, while other types of road accidents (bicycle or motorcycle crashes) usually involve an element of hyperextension injury. Neck pain is present in all patients with WAD, but headache is also a prevalent symptom (88%), especially in patients in whom the C2–3 facet joint is implicated as a cause of pain.10 68\n\nC2–3 facet joint\n\nThe C2–3 joint pathology is considered a valid etiology of cervicogenic headaches.74 The C2–3 facet joint is innervated by the third occipital nerve (TON); hence, headaches arising from C2–3 pathology were called third occipital headache in the past. Lord and colleagues75 evaluated the prevalence of TON headache among 100 patients with neck pain for at least 3 months following whiplash using history, physical examination, and diagnostic cervical MBB with local anesthetics (LA). The prevalence of TON headache in this cohort was 27% (95% CI 18% to 36%) and as high as 53% (95% CI 37% to 68%) among those with headache as the dominant symptom. No unique features on history or examination correlated with positive MBB results. Patients with a positive block were significantly more likely to be tender over the C2–3 facet joint, with a sensitivity of 85%.\n\nReports in the literature suggest available evidence is not definitive on any symptoms or signs being specific for the cervical facet joints as the cause of pain. The generally accepted reference standard for diagnosing the cervical facet joints as the primary cause of pain is relief of the pain following cervical MBB with LA of nerves that supply the putative painful joint(s).18 76 Diagnostic blocks are performed at segments suggested by matching the distribution of the patient’s pain with known referral patterns13 49 51 77 or by identifying tender areas under fluoroscopy.78\n\nReferral patterns of pain for pain arising from cervical facet joints\n\nThe referral patterns of pain arising from the cervical facet joints have been evaluated in volunteers77 and in patients with pain proven to arise from the cervical facet joints.13 49 51 Dwyer et al 77 performed IA facet joint injections in four volunteers and one patient with neck pain to map the area of pain produced by injection into each joint ( ). Stimulation of the C2–3 joint by capsular distension was associated with upper neck pain that extended into the head (often towards the ear, vertex, forehead, or eye). Stimulating the C5–6 joint resulted in pain radiating into the lower neck, top of the scapula, and shoulder above the level of the scapular spine that was distinguishable from pain extending caudally to the scapular spine from irritation of the C6–7 joint. Injections into the C3–4 joint resulted in pain in the neck extending from the suboccipital region to the lower neck without involving the shoulder, whereas injection into the C4–5 joint caused pain that was more caudal, in the top of the shoulder and lower part of the neck.\n\nCooper et al 49 conducted a study in 194 patients with neck pain who received dual LA diagnostic MBB. They reported the most common cervical facet joints associated with neck pain were C2–3 (36%), followed by C5–6 (35%), and C6–7 (17%). Joints at C1–2, C3–4, C4–5, and were each symptomatic in less than 5% of cases. Among patients with cervical facet joint pain, 52% had only 1 symptomatic joint. In the remainder, multiple symptomatic joints occurred in various combinations. These included bilateral joints at the same segment (eg, C2–3 or C5–6), adjacent joints on the same side (eg, C5–6, C6–7), and non-adjacent joints on the same side (C2–3 and C5–6). When C3–4 and C4–5 facet joints were symptomatic, it was usually in combination with an adjacent joint ( ).\n\nTable 5\n\nAuthor, yearPatientsDesignResultsCommentsDwyer et al 199077 4 asymptomatic volunteers and 1 patient with neck pain whose cervical facet joint capsules were ‘stimulated’ using 1 mL IA contrastProspective cohort studyPain referral maps produced for C2–3 (lower head, upper neck), C3–4 (upper neck), C4–5 (well localized to mid-neck below C3–4), C5–6 (top of scapula and shoulder above the scapular spine) and C6–7 (lower neck to inferior angle of scapula) jointsPain produced by injection in 9 out of 11 jointsAprill et al 199013 10 pts with neck pain received MBB with LA and steroidProspective cohort studyConcordance between painful joint level(s) predicted based on clinical evaluation and response to diagnostic blocks4 pts had undergone anterior cervical fusions. 3 pts had negative discography results for cervical discogenic painBarnsley and Bogduk, 199376 16 pts with chronic neck pain, with or without referred pain in the head or shoulder after MVC, received controlled MBB with LAProspective study11 of 16 pts had complete relief of neck pain with restoration of neck movements after cervical MBB; 4 of the remaining 5 pts had a positive cervical MBB at non-predicted levelsNo control group.\n\nLevels for cervical MBB chosen based on pain maps and sites of maximal tenderness.

Any single test was insufficient for diagnosis\n\nPhysical examination of the neck to diagnose facetogenic pain\n\nPhysical examination of the neck was found to have a high sensitivity but low specificity in a study in which 77% of subjects were identified as having primarily facet joint pain.79 However, other studies have suggested that specific physical examination maneuvers can identify cervical facet joints as the primary cause of neck pain (Box 1).80 81\n\nBox 1\n\nCervical spine range of motion (ROM)\n\nMeasurements of cervical ROM for flexion and extension in the sagittal plane, left- and right-sided lateral flexion, and rotation are taken with the patient seated. The patient is asked to report any pain response and these responses are categorized as increased, decreased, or resulting in no change in baseline cervical spine pain.\n\nExtension-rotation (ER) testing\n\nPatients are seated and asked to fully extend their head, followed by rotation to both sides. Subjects report any pain at the end of motion. A positive test for pain arising from the cervical facet joints is provocation of baseline cervical spine pain.\n\nManual spinal examination (MSE)\n\nThe patient is positioned prone with the cervical spine in a neutral position. The assessor applies a posteroanterior directed force over the articular pillars from C2–3 to C6–7 on each side. The subject reports any pain provocation, whereby a positive test is defined as worsening baseline or referred pain when the assessor perceives moderate or marked resistance to motion.\n\nPalpation for segmental tenderness (PST)\n\nPST is performed with the subject in the prone position. The assessor palpates the segmental muscles overlying the facet joints (C2–3 to C6–7) bilaterally. These muscles have the same nerve supply as the painful joint(s) and elicit tenderness and spasm. The test is considered positive if the patient reports an increase in baseline pain, either localized or referred. Paraspinal tenderness was reported to be predictive of a positive response to cervical medial branch RFA in one study.20\n\nIn a study involving 125 patients who received dual LA diagnostic cervical MBB, a protocol consisting of manual spinal examination, palpation for segmental tenderness, and extension-rotation testing was found to have a specificity of 84% (95% CI 77% to 90%) and a positive likelihood ratio of 4.94 (95% CI 2.8 to 8.2) for identifying cervical facet joints as the principal source of neck pain.80 summarizes the evidence for features on history and physical examination suggestive of cervical facetogenic pain.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn summary, there are no single pathognomonic historical symptoms or physical examination signs that can reliably predict the response to facet joint blocks in individuals with chronic neck pain, although a history of whiplash and the presence of paraspinal tenderness in the muscles overlying the facet joints appear to be associated with a positive response to facet joint interventions. Maneuvers associated with radicular signs may be predictive of negative diagnostic cervical MBB. There does not appear to be a difference between the psychological profiles of patients who respond and those who do not respond to interventions targeting the innervation to the cervical facet joints. When selecting targets for blocks, levels should be determined based on clinical presentation (tenderness on palpation (preferably performed under fluoroscopy), pain referral patterns); grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.\n\nQuestion 3: Is there any correlation between radiological findings and prognostic block or RFA outcomes?\n\nRadiological findings and painful facet joints\n\nIn order to correlate radiological findings with a painful facet joint, or outcomes of prognostic IA blocks, MBB or RFA, radiological findings must be compared with patient-reported pain outcomes. Degenerative changes noted in radiological studies may not always be symptomatic, and the presence of findings does not always correlate with clinical symptoms.\n\nPlain film radiographic examinations of the cervical spine represent a simple imaging modality for the evaluation of spine pathology. However, research to date has not found a strong association between the presence of cervical spondylosis on x-rays and clinical pain symptoms. Heller et al 82 described a retrospective case–control study in 653 patients referred for x-ray examination of the cervical spine for neck pain compared with 365 asymptomatic patients referred for barium studies. No significant differences were noted in the presence of cervical spondylosis between groups, and there were also no significant associations between pain in the arm, shoulder, scapula, neck, and back of the head, and neck stiffness with pathologic x-ray findings. Similar findings have been noted in other retrospective cohort studies, with a lack of association between longitudinal plain film changes and the presence or severity of pain 10 years after the onset of neck pain.83 The lack of association between facet joint osteoarthritis on cervical spine radiographs with reports of neck pain has been reported in larger population studies of women and men aged 20–65 years.17 More recently, a retrospective cohort study confirmed these earlier findings of the lack of association between facet or uncinate process hypertrophy and pain intensity, headaches, referred shoulder/hand pain, radiculopathy, or numbness.84 More high-quality prospective research is needed to understand the relationship between cervical spine x-ray findings and facet-mediated pain.\n\nCT represents a more sensitive imaging modality for the assessment of cervical facet pathology and may yield abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals, with one study finding a 33% prevalence of cervical facet arthritis in patients who underwent CT scans for non-spinal pain.85 Morishita et al 86 performed a retrospective study in 215 patients with cervical spine degenerative disease. Although the authors reported a significant association between hypertrophic changes on CT studies and the presence of neck pain, the statistical analysis was flawed in that it failed to control for important covariates such as age and gender known to affect the prevalence of facet degenerative changes and neck pain. Similar cross-sectional studies with limited numbers of patients report a weak association, but the lack of statistical power in describing small cohorts of patients represents a serious limitation.87 CT can demonstrate osteophytes and hyperostosis, but not changes in articular cartilage, which presents limitations in identifying painful facet joints.88 The high prevalence of asymptomatic cervical facet osteoarthritis (33%) decreases the prognostic value of this imaging modality.85 Given that CT evidence of cervical facet arthrosis is common among older patients with neck pain at the C2–6 levels, additional imaging techniques may need to be incorporated to differentiate the characteristics of painful cervical facet joints from those that are asymptomatic.88 At present, the limited research that has examined the association of CT findings with cervical facet-mediated pain is inconclusive.\n\nMRI represents an imaging modality that can identify the presence of edema in a degenerated facet joint. In a retrospective study composed of 173 patients, Nevalainen et al 15 found a significant correlation between the presence (vs absence) of neck pain and the presence of ipsilateral cervical facet bone marrow edema. However, the severity of neck pain did not significantly increase with the severity of bone marrow edema, raising questions regarding the utility of this finding for characterizing facet-mediated pain severity. Future research to confirm the presence of facet-mediated pain through prognostic blocks would build on these study findings.\n\nRadionuclide bone scintigraphy with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides functional imaging to assess microcalcification resulting from increased osteoblastic activity. This increased activity may reflect areas of mechanical stress and degenerative changes. SPECT alone as a diagnostic tool is limited by imprecise localization of affected spinal segments and low spatial resolution. The SPECT/CT modality combines the high sensitivity of SPECT with the anatomic localization of CT.89 The addition of CT corrects for soft tissue attenuation, thereby improving scan sensitivity. CT also increases specificity by demonstrating structural pathology that is causing increased tracer activity. Two small retrospective studies have examined the association between SPECT/CT findings and outcomes of cervical facet joint blocks. Neither study found a correlation, and each noted a large discrepancy between facet joint SPECT activity and the location of the cervical facet joint injection or MBB.89 90\n\nThere are more robust data investigating the use of SPECT to identify levels in the lumbar spine. Moderate evidence supports the use of SPECT for the identification of painful lumbar facet joints prior to MBB, and weak evidence supports the use of SPECT to identify painful lumbar facet joints prior to IA joint injections.29 Future research extending into these combined imaging modalities may elucidate a connection between radiological findings and facet-mediated pain ( ).\n\nTable 6\n\nAuthor, yearPatient populationDesignResultsCommentsRudy et al 201584 322 pts with neck stiffness, shoulder pain, arm pain and/or headache attending chiropractic teaching clinics with cervical radiographsRetrospective cross-sectional studySymptoms of neck pain, headaches, referral of pain to the shoulder, and upper extremity radiculopathy did not correlate with cervical facet joint degenerationConvenience sample with no asymptomatic comparison group.\n\nSmall association between neck stiffness and facet hypertrophyVan der Donk et al 199117 5440 volunteers 20–65 years of age enrolled in a national survey study stratified by presence of neck painCross-sectional survey studyOsteoarthritis of the facet joints noted on cervical radiographs was not associated with neck painMean age of participants was 46 years.\n\nAge was positively associated with neck painGore et al 198783 205 pts with neck pain >10 years durationRetrospectivePresence or severity of pain was not associated with the presence of degenerative changes including facet arthropathy, sagittal diameter of the spinal canal, or degree of cervical lordosis on initial or final cervical x-ray68 of 205 (33%) were involved in litigation.\n\nMean age at onset of neck pain was 43 years; mean age at final evaluation was 58 years.Heller et al 198382 653 case pts were referred for cervical spine x-ray. 365 control pts who were referred for barium studies received cervical spine x-raysRetrospective case–controlNo significant difference in the presence of cervical spondylosis between groups.

It can demonstrate foci of hypermetabolism in several inflammatory and infectious disease processes. Intense F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) activity has been noted in regions of facet joint arthropathy.91 Combining F-FDG PET with MRI allows for further accurate anatomic localization of metabolic information demonstrated through PET. Benefits of this technique over F-FDG PET/CT include lower radiation exposure. In a small case–control study performed in 10 patients with clinically diagnosed cervical facet syndrome, F-FDG PET/MRI localized CT-guided MBB resulted in significantly greater pain relief for up to 3 months compared with landmark-guided injections in patients with negative PET/MRI.92 However, the MBB technique was non-standard due to its high volume (3 mL) and inclusion of steroids (dose unmentioned).\n\nTo date, conventional MRI, plain CT, dynamic flexion films, and radionuclide bone scanning have not demonstrated reliable diagnostic utility for identifying suspected cervical facet-mediated pain generators.89\n\nRadiological findings associated with whiplash injury\n\nImaging findings immediately after whiplash illustrate the extent of injury to cervical facet joints. In a prospective study by Rydman et al 93 conducted in 121 patients presenting to the ED after MVC who underwent cervical CT scans within 10 days of admission, the authors found that mean pain intensity 6 months after MVC was significantly associated with baseline CT findings of facet joint degeneration. Overall, the prevalence of cervical facet joint degeneration was 45.5%, and those patients with a moderate degree of facet joint degeneration were significantly more likely (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.9 to 24.3) to self-report absence of recovery at 6 months. Facet joint degeneration on CT was graded by the presence of joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and irregularities of the articular surface. However, any specific correlation between the affected facet joints on CT and the suspected levels of pain was not analysed. In a longitudinal study by Daimon et al 94 comparing MRIs of the cervical spine obtained 2 weeks and 20 years after a whiplash injury, changes in clinical symptoms (eg, neck pain, shoulder stiffness, dizziness, and tinnitus) were not associated with the progression of degenerative changes on MRI. In another study by Gore et al 83 the presence or severity of neck pain was not related to the presence of degenerative changes on radiographs. However, postmortem studies performed in victims of fatal MVCs have identified lesions and small fractures undetectable on plain radiographs, which raises the possibility that more sensitive radiological studies may also fail to detect clinically significant injuries.71 95 More data are needed to understand the link between radiological findings and pain after a whiplash injury.\n\nRadiological findings and outcomes after prognostic blocks or RFA\n\nThe association of radiological findings with outcomes of diagnostic cervical facet joint blocks has rarely been examined. Among 37 patients presenting for single, unilateral or bilateral, one-level CT-guided cervical facet joint blocks, no significant difference in pain relief was noted based on the grading of cervical facet osteoarthritis.96 In a prospective observational study conducted in 121 patients referred for CT-guided cervical IA facet injections with steroid, a greater proportion of patients referred based on pain palpation compared with imaging (CT or MRI) reported improvement for up to 1 month.97\n\nMinimal research has examined the association between radiological findings and RFA outcomes. Cohen et al 20 performed a retrospective study evaluating factors associated with outcomes in 92 patients who underwent cervical medial branch RFA after positive diagnostic blocks. Although facet pathology was found on cervical MRI in almost half the patients, these findings were not predictive of treatment outcomes.\n\nRecommendations\n\nWe conclude that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of harms and benefits of radiological imaging modalities for the diagnosis of cervical facetogenic pain and as a prognostic indicator for the success of cervical facet blocks or RFA; Grade I recommendation. However, for the purpose of procedural planning, radiological imaging should be strongly considered when indicated; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.\n\nQuestion 4: Should physical therapy and/or conservative treatment be a prerequisite before prognostic facet blocks? If so, for how long should they be continued?\n\nConservative management of cervical facet joint pain typically involves a trial of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, physiotherapy (also known as physical therapy), and various other modalities (heat and/or ice, massage, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, traction, and spinal mobilization). Although supported by little evidence, these conservative treatments are frequently applied before consideration for interventional treatments.98 Many clinical studies68 99 100 evaluating cervical facet injections or radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy have required a course of conservative treatment, while others have not.101–103\n\nAlthough not well supported in the literature, the rationale behind the de facto use of conservative management is that it may assist the recovery process. The use of conservative management prior to prognostic facet blocks is based on pragmatism and to some extent insurance requirements, not empiric data. As with the majority of musculoskeletal conditions, neck pain generally is self-limiting. However, the clinical course of neck pain in the absence of formal treatment is not well-documented. One prospective cohort study describes the natural course of acute neck and low back pain (LBP) in the general population of Norway.104 The authors found that the course of pain declined rapidly within 1–2 months of onset in most subjects, with small changes over the follow-up year. These findings provide a general timeframe for the use of conservative management for most patients with acute, but not chronic, neck pain.\n\nThe efficacy of physiotherapy for acute neck pain was examined in a prospective cohort study by Vos et al 105 in which 187 patients with acute neck pain (mean duration at baseline was 16 days) were followed for 1 year. During that period, 118 patients were referred to a physiotherapist with 74% (87/118) reporting recovery at 1-year follow-up. Interestingly, the authors found that 79% (55/69) of control patients reported similar recovery at 1-year follow-up without any physiotherapy intervention. This again implies that most cases of acute neck pain resolve spontaneously without the need for further work-up and treatment. An RCT performed on 156 patients with neck pain found that the use of a multimodal approach containing self-management with coping skill training was more effective than individualized physical therapy over a 2-year follow-up.106 However, in another study, manual physical therapy and exercise were shown to be a more effective treatment strategy than advice on motion exercises for chronic mechanical neck pain.107 It is important to note that neck pain does not necessarily equate to cervical facet joint pain, as there are other causes of neck pain including myofascial or discogenic neck pain. However, cervical facet joint pain is known to make up a substantial portion of the patient population with neck pain, with a reported prevalence in a pain clinic population approaching 60%.6\n\nThe use of conservative treatments (which are often advocated for non-specific symptoms) prior to prognostic blocks may also be related to the absence of pathognomonic physical examination or radiological findings for facet joint pain. In the absence of any reliable means of clinically diagnosing facet joint pain, the treatment of mechanical or neuropathic neck pain often starts with less invasive treatments. The response to conservative treatments may prevent the need for further work-up and interventions. Of note, there is no evidence that conservative treatment guarantees functional improvement or pain reduction, nor does lack of response to conservative measures predict success or failure of procedural interventions. Confounding things further, responders and non-responders to prognostic facet blocks were found in one study to demonstrate similar presentation of sensory disturbances, motor dysfunction, and psychological distress.73\n\nIn a Cochrane Database systematic review of physical therapy for the treatment of non-specific chronic neck pain, there was moderate evidence supporting cervico-scapulothoracic and upper extremity strength training, endurance training, strengthening and stretching exercises, mindfulness exercise, and stabilization exercises to improve pain and function based on moderate-quality evidence.108 A meta-analysis evaluating physical therapy techniques found that therapeutic exercise had significant short-term and intermediate-term effects, but no long-term benefit on pain.109 Physical therapy did not provide significant short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term effects on disability. In a systematic review evaluating exercise programs for chronic non-specific neck pain, the authors found strong evidence for the effectiveness of muscle strengthening and endurance exercises.110 Moderate evidence supported the use of muscle endurance exercise in reducing disability attributed to neck pain. However, no physical therapy efficacy studies were found in the literature that included patients with MBB-proven cervical facet joint pain.\n\nMedications have been recommended as part of a conservative treatment regimen for patients with cervical facet-related pain, despite there being a scarce number of high-quality studies evaluating pharmacotherapy for chronic neck pain. Accurate extrapolation is even more challenging since most studies included individuals with non-specific neck pain. As noted in a review by Cohen,111 systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been found to be beneficial for spinal pain in general, but not specifically neck pain. The use of acetaminophen, topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intermediate doses of the muscle relaxant (cyclobenzaprine) were found to be useful in the treatment of acute and subacute neck pain symptoms.112–115\n\nThird occipital neuralgia/cervicogenic headaches\n\nAs with cervical facet joint-mediated pain, third occipital neuralgia and cervicogenic headaches can only be reliably diagnosed with IA injection or MBB. As per revised criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS),116 evidence of a cervical source of pain is required for the diagnosis of cervicogenic headache. However, the IHS notes that clinical features historically thought to be related to cervicogenic headaches are not unique and “they do not necessarily define causal relationships”. In a review by Bogduk and Govind,117 the authors concluded that diagnostic blocks are the only means of reliably establishing this diagnosis.\n\nThere have been several moderate quality studies exploring the use of conservative treatments including therapeutic exercises for third occipital neuralgia and cervicogenic headache.118–123 These studies have reported conflicting evidence regarding the effects of manipulative therapy on cervicogenic headaches. However, study results must be interpreted with caution since the diagnosis of cervicogenic headache was made clinically instead of by diagnostic blocks. In the only RCT that investigated the effects of exercise in the treatment of cervicogenic headache, Jull et al 121 found that either exercise or spinal manipulation provided statistically significant improvements relative to a control group through 12 weeks, with the combination treatment group faring no better than stand-alone treatments. For chronic cervicogenic headache, moderate-quality evidence supports static-dynamic cervico-scapulothoracic strengthening/endurance exercises including pressure biofeedback at long-term follow-up.108 In a review by Bogduk and Govind,117 the authors concluded that manual therapy (including physiotherapy) was no more effective than exercise alone. The authors further proposed a ‘pragmatic clinical approach’ involving exercises with or without manual therapy for clinically suspected cervicogenic headache, with the efficacy of most other treatments (eg, medications, transcutaneous electrical stimulation) being speculative at best.\n\nRecommendations\n\nDue to a generally favorable natural history of acute neck pain symptoms, our recommendation is for a 6-week trial of conservative management prior to prognostic cervical facet blocks to prevent unnecessary invasive procedures and associated healthcare costs. The use of conservative measures may prevent the need for prognostic blocks (or further interventions) but does not preclude the use of blocks for those patients who have failed conservative treatments. Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty for a requirement of conservative management before prognostic blocks in patients with at least 3 months of neck pain; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty for at least a 6-week trial of conservative therapy which may vary based on a personalized medicine paradigm; grade I recommendation for concomitant use of conservative measures to accompany prognostic blocks.\n\nQuestion 5: Is image guidance necessary for cervical facet blocks and RFA?\n\nGuidance versus no guidance: accuracy and safety\n\nWhereas no specific imaging modality has been identified as the reference standard, image guidance for cervical spine interventions has become an essential component in minimizing patient harm and optimizing results.124 For cervical facet procedures including IA injections, MBB and medial branch RFA, fluoroscopy and, to a much lesser extent, CT and ultrasound (US) are commonly used. Cervical procedures may pose a higher risk than analogous procedures in the lumbar region125; therefore, the use of advanced imaging including US or CT may be more common and useful. Similar to the lumbar region, the use of imaging allows accurate needle placement to ensure the lowest volume of anesthetic is administered, thereby reducing spread to surrounding tissues which may lead to false-positive test results. Image guidance also improves safety through direct visualization of bony elements of the neuraxis, thus avoiding proximal structures including pleura, neural foramina, and vascular supply. In the USA, the current procedural terminology (CPT) code 77 003 (fluoroscopic guidance and localization of needle or catheter tip for spine or paraspinous diagnostic or therapeutic injection procedures) should not be used for facet blocks or RF as imaging is considered an integral part of the procedures. When US guidance is used, the category III codes 0213 T–0218T should be reported.\n\nManchikanti et al 126 examined procedural risks of fluoroscopically-guided cervical facet procedures in a prospective observational study in which 3370 cervical MBBs were performed. They found no instances of nerve damage, spinal cord injury, infection, or epidural hematoma; however, cervical procedures had a higher risk of intravascular adverse events (eg, oozing, intravascular penetration) compared with thoracic and lumbar regions. The lack of moderate to severe adverse events or a difference in incidence between cervical and lumbar spine interventions when image guidance is used is unsurprising given the rarity of moderate to severe complications associated with either region.125 Neither this nor other studies examined the relative risk of performing cervical joint procedures with and without image guidance. This type of empiric study is unlikely to be designed or performed, as the scientific community has encouraged image guidance as a general harm reduction strategy.124 Heckman and colleagues127 reported a case of transient tetraplegia following cervical facet IA injection in which no image guidance was used, and closed claims analyses have revealed at least two other cases involving facet injections in which the use of imaging was not noted.128 129 Cervical joint procedures performed without image guidance are likely to result in at least as many complications and poor outcomes as unguided lumbar paravertebral or facet injections.29 130\n\nExisting guidelines and insurance coverage\n\nThe scientific question related to the accuracy and safety of image- versus non-image-guided procedures has not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials.125 The ASA’s 2010 practice guidelines are referenced in some insurance company determinations, although their language more generally references ‘appropriate image guidance’ and does not limit recommendations to specific imaging modalities.131 The SIS guidelines recommend the use of fluoroscopic imaging with multiple views using the lowest amount of radiation but do not mention the use of CT, US, and imaging modality combinations.132 For MBBs, the nerve is not directly visible with fluoroscopy, but its location can be inferred based on accepted bony landmarks. Fluoroscopy is a familiar technology that most pain physicians are comfortable using. However, either real-time fluoroscopy or preferably digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is needed to reliably detect and visualize intravascular injection.133 134 Nevertheless, fluoroscopy—and particularly CT—have considerable costs associated with them, including purchase price, maintenance, and the need for dedicated facilities. Further, both modalities—and particularly CT—expose patients and providers to significant radiation, which may have cumulative health effects. The CPT codes for cervical joint procedures that are recognized by most insurance companies are bundled with image guidance, specifically fluoroscopic and CT guidance. Separate US-based codes for cervical procedures (eg, 0213 T–0215T) are considered experimental and investigational by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The 2008 Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines (next projected update 2021) support the routine use of radiographic guidance and indicate that performing facet procedures without image guidance could put patients at risk; consequently, many local coverage areas automate payment rejections based on lack of use of radiographic imaging.135 The original study supporting the HHS guidelines reported a lack of precision and potentially catastrophic outcomes for procedures performed without imaging.130 Despite growing evidence for the use of US as an imaging modality for cervical MBBs,136–138 which has no radiation risks and may lower the entry cost for physicians, a major carrier for CMS determined that US imaging for facet injections would not be reimbursed. However, their determination supported the use of fluoroscopic or CT guidance for facet joint procedures including cervical MBBs.139 Multiple insurance companies have aligned their coverage requirements with that ruling including BlueCross BlueShield,140 Cigna,141 and UnitedHealthcare,142 determining that facet blocks performed with US are experimental.\n\nImaging for prognostic interventions (medial block and third occipital nerve (TON) blocks with local anesthetic)\n\nUse of fluoroscopy\n\nFluoroscopy is the reference standard for prognostic interventions of the cervical spine including TON block and MBB.8 76 A randomized study of the cervical spine found the incidence of ‘missed nerves’ to be 7% using fluoroscopic guidance with 0.25–0.5 mL of injectate,78 and an earlier study showed that a 0.5 mL injection reliably encompassed the target nerve.76\n\nUse of CT or US\n\nIn a randomized trial comparing CT-guided to US-guided IA injections in 40 patients with neck pain, Obernauer et al 143 found superior benefit immediately post-procedure and at 1 month for US-guided single-level injections, with shorter procedure duration. For two-level injections, the benefit favoring US-guided injections fell shy of statistical significance. Eichenberger et al 144 achieved cutaneous analgesia in the distribution of the TON after a US-guided TON block in nine of 10 injections in normal volunteers. It should be noted that the authors used a large volume (0.9 mL) of injectate which will spread well beyond the margins of the TON.78 The C2–3 joint was correctly identified in 27 of 28 cases, and in 23 of 28 injections the needle fell within 0.5 mm of the target nerve.144 These findings were confirmed in a subsequent volunteer study by a group with overlapping authors.137\n\nFinlayson et al 136 performed a randomized study in 40 patients undergoing TON block to determine the comparative effectiveness of fluoroscopic versus US guidance. Their study found comparable effectiveness (19 of 20 patients received successful TON hypoesthesia) with US guidance, which required fewer needle adjustments than fluoroscopically-guided interventions. The TON was directly identified in 16 of 20 US procedures and vascular penetration was observed in zero patients in the US group versus one in 20 in the fluoroscopy group.\n\nThese findings were replicated in a retrospective comparative study by Park et al 145 conducted in 126 patients undergoing cervical MBB by either fluoroscopic or US guidance. Their results demonstrated similar accuracy rates, but reduced procedure time and needle adjustments using US. Paredes et al 146 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis showing that using US for cervical prognostic interventions including TON block and cervical MBB was non-inferior to fluoroscopic guidance, albeit with a lower incidence of vascular penetration and no radiation exposure. US may also offer the additional benefit of real-time imaging of the cervical spine.\n\nWhereas US may provide comparable accuracy and confer some advantages over fluoroscopy, several studies have revealed diminished accuracy rates for C7, which may also be more challenging to block with fluoroscopy.137 138 In one randomized study involving 50 patients, US and fluoroscopy were found to have similar accuracy rates (92–96%) and to provide comparable post-block pain relief, although the former was associated with shorter performance time and less intravascular contrast spread.147 It is important to recognize that even an imaging modality that permits direct visualization of neurovascular structures is not devoid of risks, with Park et al 148 reporting a case of permanent spinal cord injury after a C7 MBB was performed under US guidance, which reinforces the challenges at this cervical level ( ).137\n\nTable 10\n\nAuthor, yearPatient populationStudy designResultsCommentsPark et al\n\n2017145 Pts with injection-confirmed chronic cervical facet joint pain who received US-guided (n=68) or fluoroscopically-guided cervical MBB (n=58)RetrospectiveBoth groups showed improvements, with no significant differences between groups for pain scores or responder ratesCompared with fluoroscopically-guided cervical MBB, US-guided cervical MBB was associated with a shorter performance time and fewer needle passesFinlayson et al 2013136 40 pts undergoing TON block were randomized to fluoroscopic or US guidanceRandomizedFluoroscopy and US guidance provided similar technical success rates (95–100%) and pain reliefUS guidance was associated with a significantly shorter performance time (212.8 vs 396.5 seconds) and fewer needle passes (2 vs 6)Finlayson et al 2015147 50 pts undergoing C7 MBB under US or fluoroscopic guidanceRandomizedSimilar accuracy rates (92–96%) and post-block pain relief between modalitiesUS guidance was associated with shorter performance time, fewer needle passes and less intravascular spreadManchikanti et al 2012126 7500 episodes of 43 000 facet joint nerve blocks with 3370 episodes in the cervical region.

For two-level injections, pain reduction was comparable\n\nImaging for therapeutic interventions (IA steroid and RFA)\n\nUse of fluoroscopy, CT, and US\n\nIn the lumbar anatomic region, recent multi-society guidelines recommended fluoroscopy as the preferred imaging modality for IA injections and lumbar medial branch RFA.29 The use of fluoroscopic guidance is well-established for TON through C8 medial branch RFA procedures.21 68 101 149 However, the use of CT and US guidance for cervical interventions including IA facet injections with steroid is still in its infancy and cadaveric evaluation has yet to definitively establish comparative effectiveness and safety relative to the fluoroscopic approach.143 150 A prospective clinical trial comparing CT versus US-guided IA facet injections in 40 adults demonstrated equivalent accuracy and effectiveness.143 However, the US-guided procedures were faster to perform, with no radiation exposure. A single RCT has been performed evaluating cervical medial branch RFA using US. Siegenthaler et al 151 examined the effect of US-positioned and fluoroscopically-confirmed placement to refine cannula positioning for cervical medial branch RFA in a cohort study involving 15 patients with an average body mass index of 26. The authors demonstrated that the target nerve was visible under US guidance in all patients at all levels and that long-term effectiveness was comparable to the fluoroscopic interventional literature. However, the authors cautioned against performing US-guided cervical medial branch RFA without fluoroscopic guidance.\n\nLimitations of fluoroscopy, CT, and US\n\nThe use of fluoroscopy is limited by radiation exposure and an inability to directly visualize the nerve and its trajectory. Additionally, the upfront costs including the C-arm and monitor, radiology technician, and fluoroscopic table represent a barrier. For MBB, CT precludes the use of real-time contrast injection or DSA to detect intravascular uptake. Regarding cervical medial branch RFA, the imaging constraints imposed by trajectory recommendations are present but less substantial than in the lumbar spine, enabling parallel or near-parallel placement of electrodes.152 Yet, the widespread use of CT remains limited because of substantial equipment costs, radiation exposure, lack of real-time vascular imaging, and the need for different patient positions during procedures performed at the upper and lower facet joints.152\n\nThe use of US may provide an alternative imaging modality for performance of MBB but it is not ideal for cervical IA injections or medial branch RFA that require a set trajectory. Although US is portable, can be used in pregnancy, and does not require the use of protective garments, there are significant disadvantages of using US guidance for cervical spine interventions. US cannot visualize the entire field including adjacent levels, thereby increasing the risk of incorrect level identification.153 Widespread adoption may also be limited by anatomic difficulties associated with specific anatomic levels in the neck, especially involving C7.137 Of note, the US-guided approach to the cervical medial branch is less commonly taught in residency, fellowship, and postgraduate courses; therefore, widespread adoption would require additional physician training. Although US enables direct visualization of nearby vessels, it does not easily detect inadvertent vascular uptake, which can be reliably detected using real-time contrast injection or DSA.154 The limitations in the lumbar spine related to decreased needle visibility due to body habitus and depth to target are present, but may be less of a barrier in the cervical spine.\n\nRecommendations\n\nWe recommend that fluoroscopy or (in providers with expertise) US be used for cervical MBB. US can be useful in patients in whom radiation exposure may be associated with potential harm; however, the lack of training may limit widespread adoption; Grade A recommendation, moderate level of certainty. For IA injections, we recommend the use of fluoroscopic imaging as the additional radiation exposure from CT compared with fluoroscopy precludes any theoretical benefit; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty. For cervical medial branch RFA, we recommend that fluoroscopy be used as the additional radiation exposure from CT compared with fluoroscopy precludes any theoretical benefit. Whereas CT-fluoroscopy is associated with less radiation than CT alone, it is not widely available and adds significant upfront equipment costs and radiation exposure; Grade A recommendation, high level of certainty for the use of imaging, Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty for the use of fluoroscopy instead of other imaging modalities.\n\nQuestion 6: What is the optimal technique for injection into the AA and AO joints? Should steroids be used and, if so, what type of steroids? What are the most common complications and how can they be minimized?\n\nImage guidance and patient positioning\n\nThe use of image guidance is essential when performing AA and AO joint injections ( ). In clinical practice, fluoroscopy is typically used. Although CT guidance has been anecdotally reported, no studies describe this technique or outcomes in the literature. The feasibility of an US-guided approach for AO joint injection has been described in cadavers,155 but no clinical studies have been published to demonstrate safety or efficacy. However, a combined approach using fluoroscopy with US assistance to identify the vertebral artery has been advocated.156 For both AO and AA joint injections, patients are typically placed in the prone position with a pillow or cushion under the chest to allow for flexion of the neck.156 157\n\nTable 11\n\nAuthor, yearPatient populationDesignResultsCommentsBusch and Wilson, 1989168 25 pts with head and neck pain of which 2 pts received LA and steroid AO and AA joint injectionsRetrospectivePain relief in both cases ranged from 3 weeks to 4 months (1 patient received serial injections)No reported adverse events other than transient ataxia and worsening pain for 24–48 hours.
