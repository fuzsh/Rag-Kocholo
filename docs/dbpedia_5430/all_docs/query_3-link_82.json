        "text": "James Bond is a fictional character created by British novelist Ian Fleming. Fleming introduced Bond, a secret agent in the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), in his 1953 novel Casino Royale. Known as Agent 007, Bond is a suave Cold War–era superspy who uses his special forces training and the latest in spy gadget technology to thwart international operatives and bring criminals to justice. Fleming’s novel Dr. No (1958) was adapted for film by the British movie production company Eon Productions in 1962. Directed by Irish filmmaker Terence Young and starring Scottish-born actor Sean Connery as Bond, Dr. No launched one of the most successful film franchises in history. Collectively, the 25 James Bond films released by Eon Productions have grossed more than $7 billion at the box office. From Dr. No to No Time to Die (2021), Bond has been portrayed by several actors, including Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.\n\nBelow is a list of James Bond films released by Eon Productions."
