        "text": "Actor Timothy Dalton, playing the famous agent 007, gets behind the wheel of a truck. One of the last chases of the Bond film License to Kill is about to be filmed on the Mexican highway La Rumorosa. But filming here is not a good idea. Mysterious phenomena occur on the road.\n\nDalton will soon be convinced of this. What will happen to him and is the highway cursed?\n\nIn the ditches and deep ravines around it, you can almost always come across broken and charred wrecks of cars. Mexico’s La Rumorosa is rightly ranked among the most dangerous roads in the world. It is surrounded by high rocks and giant ravines.\n\nIn addition, almost everywhere around the highway, winding along the rocky slopes of the California peninsula is just an inhospitable lunar landscape. “For a long distance, no one calls it anything other than the highway of death,” points out a resident of the town of Tecate, where the road ends. Thousands of people lost their lives at La Rumorosa.\n\nShadows and bright beings\n\nThe surprised driver slows down and stops. He saw an old woman by the roadside. “Could you give me a ride to the nearest town?” the woman allegedly asked. The man nods, but as he opens the door for her, the floor collapses on top of the grandmother.\n\nHe encountered one of the most famous ghosts of La Rumorosa. The other one is said to belong to a nurse who died here years ago in an ambulance crash. A young man on a bicycle who was hit by a car on the spot is supposed to appear in one of the many passes on the highway.\n\nHis driver sped away from the accident, leaving the boy to bleed to death. But witnesses have also seen shadowy figures or mysterious luminous beings here.\n\nHe traps passing cars\n\nThe driver gets chills. A few hours ago, he successfully conquered the highway of death. But while driving, he encountered a young truck driver named Francisco Vázquez, who asked him to deliver a note with a message to his wife in Mexicali.\n\n“I have to stay here and watch over the wrecked truck,” he explained. The driver meets him and looks for Mrs. Vázquez in the city. However, she pales at his words. Her husband crashed into a ravine on the highway many years ago. It is not clear what happened to him.\n\nHis body was never found. However, Vázquez’s ghost has since been appearing at the corner where the crash occurred, trailing passing lorries.\n\nHe almost goes off a cliff\n\nActor Timothy Dalton (*1946) shakes like an aspen. In 1998, Hollywood filmmakers decided to film a part of the sixteenth Bond movie at La Rumorosa. From the beginning, it seems as if some dark forces want to thwart their plan.\n\nDuring filming, one accident after another happens. The crew members also witness a large number of paranormal phenomena. Once the car even starts and stops by itself in the parking lot.\n\nIn addition, during the filming of one of the chases, the main actor of James Bond is almost killed. As Dalton drives a giant tractor, another one emerges and crashes into him. The actor just misses the edge of the cliff…\n\nFrequent UFO sightings\n\n“Stop it now!” the woman snaps at her man. As they drive down the highway of death, they see a swarm of lights in the distance. They are not the first or last people to spot something like this in the area.\n\n“The area is known for many UFO sightings,” notes columnist Jesse Katz. According to occultists, however, it is unrelated to the mysterious phenomena directly on the highway. They are supposed to happen for another reason.\n\nThe road grew on the sacred land of the Indian tribe Kumeyaj, who therefore cursed it. Or are the scientists right when they claim that the strange sensations and frequent accidents are just the result of the place being scorched by the hot sun and driven by strong winds and dust?"
