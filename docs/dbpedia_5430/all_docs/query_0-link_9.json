        "text": "When I ask the question, I think to myself. The Bond I picture when I read the novels.\n\nIt changes from Dalton, to Connery to Moore. Depending on my mood.\n\nWhen I watch the films, each of the actors IS James Bond at various times.\n\nI think Bond is more than any of the actors who have portrayed him. They've each brought something to the role, and have owned it.\n\nEven with Fleming's description of James Bond, there is a certain element of ambiguity to the part. Personally I think Bond is whoever you want him to be. However the majority need to go along with you. Within reason. If that makes sense. ;)\n\nElba would have been a dream choice but I think he probably is too old now. I agree with you in a way @Pierce2Daniel, I've said a few times that I'd rather have an older more grizzled looking actor for just a film or two than a baby faced one for five who we have to wait years to properly grow into the role. But I do think 40 something is probably the limit. I really doubt with the current gaps that we'll see Bond 26 before 2024 or 2025, at which point Elba will be 52 or 53, and probably pushing 60 by his second film. Not sure the producers would go for that, I think after Craig they'll want to go younger again. I also think that he's shot himself in the foot by playing up to the hype and rumours so much. He would've been brilliant and I'd be over the moon if he was cast but I think that ship has definitely sailed now.\n\nI'm really rooting for Jack O Connell. He's young enough to really revitalise things after Craig but also has real presence, charisma and a sense of danger to him that I think a lot of the other younger choices lack. I also think he's the sort of actor Barbara would want and I read an interview with him where he quietly mentioned that Bond is the only big franchise he'd consider doing, so we don't have to worry about Marvel or anyone snapping him up in the mean time. I think he'd be a really exciting choice and he's a very possible one.\n\nOh, I know, get someone who is a stellar actor, but looks nothing like James Bond, doesn't act like him, is not a secret agent for the Mi6, ..., Just call him James Bond, and we're off.\n\n.\n\nInteresting point, Craig is very close to this description. Goes to show how much it depends on how well the actor, producers and director pull it off.\n\nThanks for pointing that out!\n\nHe's tall, Caucasian, has blue eyes, is handsome in a ruthless kind of way. How does he close to that description. If you ask me he's very close to fleming's description....\n\nYou ignore the context. From Connery up to and including Brosnan we got the same Bond. Who by the way doesn't necessarily fit Fleming's description. Craig portrayed someone else, he's totally different from all the others, but he did it so well that for many he's the best Bond.\n\nNo I don't. You however ignore the fact that Moore intentionally steered away from looking too much like Connery. To my mind Connery's en Craigs'imersonations aren't that far off from eachother. It looks further because of the Gentleman Moore version, and the more classic version portrayed by Timothy. Brosnan again had a childrens'friendly version, which Craigs isn't.\n\nAll in all, my point still stands: the basics of all the bonds have been the same (or very close to eachother) and all in a way fitting Fleming's descriptions more or less. I am vehemently opposed to throwing that away, it doesn't fit the story. Look at Dr. Who: that story allows for just about any incarnation, which keeps the whole frenchise alive. Bond just doesn't have that much stretcheability. Look at how people reacted even to the 'stepbrother' story. Suddenly giving Bond a family was just wrong, even though it wasn't true family.\n\nI guess the question is 'Who is James Bond?'\n\nThe guy on the right? Carmichael altered to look closer to the cinematic James Bond:\n\nSeems a cross between Carmichael and Gregory Peck? Perhaps Timothy Dalton is the Bond actor that looks the closest to the image on the right although they don't look that similar.\n\nNow the guy on the right would be a very good Bond if you ask me!\n\nJust watched Poldark series 5 Episode 1 on BBC, and it must be said how right Aidan Turner is for Bond. He a really growing as an actor and you can see in his performance the same alpha masculine confidence which is crucial for 007. Every Bond has that despite the difference in portrayals (even Craig).\n\nWhat is interesting is in this series it appears Poldark is\n\nrecruited by the government for work in \"covert\" matters. In one scene he is escorted with a gun in his back to an M like figure who says \"we can use a man with your skills\". It's almost like he is becoming an 18th Century spy!\n\nI believe that Turner would be the perfect man to bring back the aspect of charm and warmth to the character that Roger and Pierce gave it. He is very endearing scene presence with the looks and charisma to match. He just is James Bond, and is growing as an actor. Soon he will be the perfect age to take over the reins."
