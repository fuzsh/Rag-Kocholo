        "text": "My wife came home will I was watching the everything or nothing DVD, (now I must start by saying my wife works in a theatre company) it came to the point of Dalton in LTK on the oil tanker and he does some roll. My wife who known nothing about Bond prior to Daniel Craig said \"by any chance is he (Dalton) a theatre actor\" Me \"yes, how could you tell\". She says \"the way he just rolled about there, he over acted it, that's a give away of theatre actors they are over theatrical\". My wife has now ruined the Dalton films for me, cause if you do watch his action scenes he is over theatrical with his movements lol.\n\nThat's really interesting. In the PTS for TLD i can't help but chuckle a little when Dalton first starts running after the truck. He so oversells the running that it's almost comical.\n\nYeah I remember a writer in Rolling Stone lamenting on Glen's return despite the casting of a new intriguing Bond (Dalton).\n\nDalton like Brosnan deserved better.\n\nI don't know why Brosnan always gets sympathy to the effect that he got screwed over on his directors. Both Martin Campbell and Michael Apted were more celebrated directors than the Bond series had hired in a good while. And Lee Tamahori directed the very underrated The Edge, which as a director gave him a higher stock than Glen had going into his first film.\n\nOne line that always bugged me in LTK was Dalton yelling \"Della!\" when finding her body. I don't know if that was just bad ADR or something but Glen should have caught it. I think it really ruins an emotionally important scene.\n\nAnother line that I thought was pretty bad was the way Dalton says, \"If you can't trust Heller who can you trust\". The way Dalton delivers it sounds like Bond is about to start sobbing and whimpering. I'm surprised that's the take they settled on.\n\nThe reality is John Glen is a very lucky man, charming and a strong leader, but not really a great talent, although very professional. In today's film world he would never ever rise to the heights of directing Bond, not a chance in hell. It's all about the time and the place. That's life.\n\nAgreed. Glen in alot of ways was a TV director. Competent enough to get the shots he needed but was never going to go much further beyond just getting it done.\n\nThat's a frustration I've had with the Bond series and EON. I won't say that EON was lazy but they definitely got complacent at times. Yes the John Glen Bond films of the 80s were making healthy profits but their success both critically and moreso financially was a long way off from what they experienced in the 60s and better films of the 70s. It seemed like they were perfectly fine with their diminished success. I agree with some of the above posters that the comfort zone of the \"Bond family\" could often be more of a detriment rather than a benefit.\n\nMy wife came home will I was watching the everything or nothing DVD, (now I must start by saying my wife works in a theatre company) it came to the point of Dalton in LTK on the oil tanker and he does some roll. My wife who known nothing about Bond prior to Daniel Craig said \"by any chance is he (Dalton) a theatre actor\" Me \"yes, how could you tell\". She says \"the way he just rolled about there, he over acted it, that's a give away of theatre actors they are over theatrical\". My wife has now ruined the Dalton films for me, cause if you do watch his action scenes he is over theatrical with his movements lol.\n\nFunnily enough I think the same sometimes applies to Brosnan. I remember a few months ago I was watching a play in London (City of Angels it was called). There was a scene when one of the main characters was lying on the floor in a darkened room being beaten up by a group of men. The actor on the floor was making all sorts of grunts and groans when he was hit. It reminded me of the sound-proof room scene in TND.\n\nI wouldn't say Dalton overacts quite as much as Pierce does, but he can be guilty of being somewhat over-dramatic in his facial expressions.\n\nI think it kind of depends on what the role is and how the actor adapts to film. Some theatre actors work better on film than others.\n\nI suppose the trick is make it not LOOK like the actor is acting. Someone like Judy Dench can do this very well. She's probably one of the most successful theatre actors who has also made a big name for herself in serious films. I saw Iris for the first time a few days ago and she's brilliant in it.\n\nAnd then they tell you that being a theatre actor is an asset in films! :D\n\nI think it most definitely is, but you need to adapt your demeanor and your voice. everything is bigger on the big screen, you cannot have the same range as on the stage. Some stage actors make the transaction easily, some less. And it also depends of the movie. I think Dalton struggled at times, not only in his Bond movies but in other ones as well. He was great in The Rocketeer, playing a villain, and I think villains in general are easier to play in movies for thespians.\n\nI think that Glen was the best when it came to action in Bond. Of the directors that have followed, I think Apted could have worked well with Dalton.\n\nNot that it would bear any similarity to a Apted/Dalton Bond, but Apted directed my favourite Stacy Keach film, 1977's 'The Squeeze'. If you like your films old skool tough (REAL tough, it is made in the decade when heroes smelt of beer and Brut), I recommend The Squeeze. This image sums up the film...\n\nNow consider this, Keach plays the flawed hero.\n\nI can understand Dalton being bitter over having had his 2 films directed by a journeyman hack, yes both TLD & LTK are near the top for me but I think of what they could have been like with a director who actually understood what Tim was trying to do.\n\n.\n\nDefinitely. EON didn't catch on until after Dalton's run that if you want to break out of the foggy, I would say, rather tacky look of the past decade, they would have to look outside of house.\n\nSomething that always struck me about Dalton's films were that despite that fact that they were made in the late 80s they looked like they could've been released in the 70s.\n\nTake License to Kill and compare it to other blockbuster films released that same year like Lethal Weapon 2, Batman, The Last Crusade, Back to the Future 2, The Abyss, etc. They all look so much more polished, refined, and cinematic. While TLD and LTK at times looked like they could've been made for TV.\n\nThe first BATMAN looked like crap, there was no backlight, everything mushed into the background, at least in the theater and on VHS. The second one had a nice edge light though. THE ABYSS looked spectacular, but I don't remember anything special about LETHAL WEAPON in the slightest, visually. DIE HARD looked almost like it was shot without movie lights some of the time, was very rough-looking (not talking about the overstylized exteriors with the shot-through-sunglass look.)\n\nTLD was shot on the same stocks everybody else used at that time, 5247 and 5294, and I'm pretty sure Mills didn't force-process his imagery, so I can't imagine what would make you think the image looked older. LTK has a lot of white in its art direction, and grain shows up more strongly in white and gray areas of image, so that is about the only thing I can think of (and I've seen these two movies at least 30 times apiece. Except for FRWL and GF, have probably seen these the most of any Bond film.)"
