        "text": "Our Advisors\n\nProfessor Ziyad Al-Aly\n\nDr. Al-Aly a physician-scientist; he directs the Clinical Epidemiology Center and serves as the Chief of Research and Development Service at the VA Saint Louis Health Care System. He is a senior clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in Saint Louis. He is internationally recognized for his expertise in harnessing the power of big data to answer important public health questions.He led work which provided systematic characterization of the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (also called Long Covid) and subsequently characterization of the increased risks of cardiovascular disease, neurologic disorders, diabetes, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, and gastrointestinal disorders following SARS-CoV-2 infection. His lab was the first to produce evidence characterizing the effects of vaccines on Long Covid, the health consequences of repeated infections with SARS-CoV-2, and the effect of antivirals on the short- and long-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dr. Al-Aly co-chaired the Biden-Harris Administration committee that developed the National Research Action Plan for Long Covid and serves on the US Government Interagency Long Covid Coordination Council. He advised the Chief Science Advisor of Canada (Government of Justin Trudeau). He currently serves on a consensus committee at the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine looking at the long-term health effects stemming from COVID-19 and their implications for the Social Security Administration.

She was awarded an MBE for services to Medicine and Public Health during the pandemic in the Queen’s New Year Honours 2021, and named among women leading change from across the world in the BBC 100 Women 2020 list. Nisreen delivered a TEDx talk describing public health communication, power, objectivity and vulnerability themes around the topic of Long Covid.\n\nJenny Ceolta-Smith\n\nBio will be available soon\n\nCarolyn Chew-Graham\n\nCarolyn A. Chew-Graham, GP Principal in Central Manchester, Professor of General Practice Research at Keele University. Carolyn’s main areas of interest and expertise include the primary care management of people with mental health problems, multiple health conditions and unexplained symptoms; and the mental health and wellbeing of clinicians. She has qualitative research methods expertise, drawing on theories from social sciences and psychology, but always with a focus on clinical practice – trying to answer questions that are important to patients, their families, health care professionals and the NHS. Carolyn is a member of the NHS England Long Covid Taskforce and has published articles and research on Long Covid. Her 2020 paper Finding the ‘right’ GP was the first qualitative study describing the experiences of people with Long Covid in navigating healthcare. She has co-written an e-learning module for GPs on Long Covid. Carolyn chairs the RCGP ‘Research Paper of the Year’ panel. She was Chair of the Society of Academic Primary Care 2019-2022. Carolyn was a member of the NICE Clinical Guideline Development Group Depression (update) - work which directly impacts on commissioning decisions and patient care. She is Editor-in-Chief of the journal Health Expectations. Carolyn was awarded the President’s Medal by RCPsych in 2021.\n\nDr Caroline Dalton\n\nDr Caroline Dalton is an Associate Professor of Neuroscience and Genetics. She leads the Living Well with Chronic Disease theme at the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre, and the Health and Disease group at the Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, both at Sheffield Hallam University. Dr Dalton has a BSc in Biochemistry and a PhD in Immunology. Her research interests include the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to interventions to treat complex conditions such as schizophrenia, depression and obesity. She has been working with Long Covid Support since summer 2020 and has contributed to resources supporting people with Long Covid including a booklet on management of fatigue symptoms that is used in Long Covid clinics. She is currently carrying out studies on symptom and activity tracking in Long Covid, alongside mechanistic studies that investigate the underlying biological causes of Long Covid symptoms.\n\nProfessor Brendan Delaney\n\nProfessor Brendan Delaney is a leading exponent internationally of the “Learning Health System’ (LHS) concept. His initial training in research was in health technology assessment, real-world (pragmatic) clinical trials and clinical research in Family Medicine. Since 2003 he has worked in the area of Clinical Informatics, being appointed to a Chair in Medical Informatics at Imperial in 2015 and elected one of the first 100 founding fellows of the new UK Faculty of Clinical Informatics in 2017. Prior to moving to Imperial, he was Wolfson Professor of General Practice at King’s College London. At Imperial, Brendan works in the Institute of Global Health Innovation, with research in Artificial Intelligence, cancer diagnosis and learning systems, eSource for clinical trials and global eHealth. He is a member of the Medical Research Council Data Science Strategic Advisory Group. Brendan’s interests lie at the intersection of health services research (how to deal with patient problems equitably and efficiently), the use of data in research and service development and ‘pressing’ clinical problems.\n\nClaire Every\n\nClaire graduated in Combined Studies specialising in Philosophy & the History of Science, Medicine & Technology from the University of Manchester. She has a special interest in the history of Hysteria and the female experience in medicine, and how this relates to the treatment of chronic conditions and 'medically unexplained symptoms'. Her understanding stems from the personal and academic. After receiving some of the highest academic grades in the country and competing at a national level in martial arts Claire contracted a viral infection, then suffered from ME/CFS for 8 years. After 4 decades of dealing with the medical system through periods of remission and relapse with Long EBV, Long Flu and Long Covid, she is clear that there is still a substantial knowledge gap in medicine around post-acute viral illness. Claire is building connections between the worlds of ME/CFS and Long Covid to help ensure that the mistakes made through the application of the Biopsychosocial (BPS) model, or Cognitive Behavioural Model (CBM) are not repeated. Her previous academic experience with the Philosophy of Psychiatry, Psychology and Philosophy of Mind helps bring clarity to these issues. Claire regularly blogs on these subjects as Long Covid Advocacy. She is also a member of the patient advisory group in the World Health Network.\n\nDr Mark Faghy\n\nDr Mark Faghy is an associate professor and the Long COVID research lead at the University of Derby. His research prior to pandemic aimed to understand the slow recovery of community acquired pneumonia patients following discharge from hospital. In the early stages of the pandemic, he used learning from this research to profile the recovery pattern of patients discharged from hospital and recovering in community settings following a COVID-19 infection. The research clearly demonstrated that some patients were still experiencing persistent and debilitating symptoms that has led to further research to increase the mechanistic understanding of Long COVID. At the heart of Dr Faghy's is the lived experience and patient voice and he regularly conducts projects alongside patient representatives. He is also passionate about creating a platform for the patient voice which has also led to the development of public awareness showcases to continue to increase public knowledge of Long COVID.\n\nHelen Hughes\n\nHelen Hughes is the Chief Executive of Patient Safety Learning, a charity and independent voice for improving patient safety. The charity seeks to support safety improvement through policy, influencing and the development of ‘how to’ resources such as the hub, a free platform to share learning for patient safety. Helen’s passion to improve patient safety is informed by personal family insight into the impact of unsafe care and the ineffectiveness of organisational responses to learn from error. She has been a Director and CEO at several healthcare, social justice and equality organisations, including the National Patient Safety Agency and the WHO.\n\nDr Graham Lloyd-Jones\n\nDr Graham Lloyd-Jones is a Consultant Radiologist at Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust. He is an educator in the field of medical imaging and the founder/director of Radiology Masterclass, a leading UK-based online educational resource for medical students and junior doctors. During the COVID-19 pandemic Graham has worked on gaining a collaborative and interdisciplinary understanding of disease mechanisms. His work highlights the vascular nature of the acute lung disease in COVID-19 and how this differs from conventional viral pneumonias. He takes the view that similar disease processes are implicated in those with symptoms of long COVID. His work on disease mechanism also highlights the importance of poor oral health, especially gum disease, in contributing to disease severity in acute COVID-19. He is leading a local project to optimise the oral healthcare of inpatients with COVID-19 and is sharing this work widely with infection prevention and control teams across the UK. Graham is a member of the FDI World Dental Federation whole body task group which acts to highlight the connections between oral health and body health. He continues to work with multiple research teams to further understand disease mechanisms as they relate to the radiology and oral health aspects of acute COVID-19 and long COVID.\n\nRobin McNelis\n\nRobin McNelis, Clinical Specialist Chartered Physiotherapist, specialised in Cardiorespiratory Physiotherapy since 1999 both in NHS and Private Healthcare. In 2020, life changed both personally and professionally for Robin after contracting Covid in March 2020 which resulted in a series of complications including being formally diagnosed with Long Covid in August 2020. Around this time, Robin was instrumental in setting up The Long Covid Clinic at The Wellington Hospital – one of the first of its kind in the UK – using his professional experience as well as using his personal lived-experience of the condition. In 2022, Robin accepted a post as Clinical Lead of the Enfield Community Post Covid Service, providing therapy services to Long Covid patients who had come through the PCS Assessment Clinic at UCLH. After 2 years leading the service and against a background of uncertain funding, Robin made the decision to leave the NHS and develop his independent business full time having been providing services alongside his fulltime job until the pandemic.\n\nDr Tim Nicholson\n\nDr Tim Nicholson is a Reader in Neuropsychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King’s College London. He is also an Honorary Consultant Neuropsychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust where he currently works in a Long COVID clinic focusing on neurological and psychiatric complications. He co-leads the NIHR funded Post COVID-19 Condition Core Outcome Set (PC-COS) study in collaboration with the WHO and many other national and international groups, including key input from Long COVID Support. This study aims to arrive at international consensus on how to measure Long COVID in both research studies and clinical settings which is key to optimising and accelerating understanding of Long COVID and the development of evidence based treatments. He leads research into immune and genetic biomarkers of cognitive and pain symptoms in Long COVID as well as the physiology and role of interoception and cognition in respiratory symptoms. He is also involved in a neuroimaging study of fatigue and leads the neuropsychiatry working group of the COVID-CNS study, a UKRI funded national study of acute neurological and psychiatric COVID complications. During the early stages of the pandemic he set up and led the neuropsychiatry complications ‘early warning’ surveillance system and an international team that published a ‘Neuropsych COVID’ blog to disseminate the rapidly emerging data which also published several key early ‘meta-analysis’ reviews that pooled together this key early data.\n\nClare Rayner\n\nBio will be available soon\n\nProfessor Helen Ward\n\nHelen Ward is a Clinical Professor of Public Health at Imperial College London where she co-leads the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) Study of the long-term health impact of the COVID-19 in 2.5 million people. Early in 2020, Helen and her team stressed the importance of community engagement in the emerging pandemic, publishing some of the first reports on public priorities and responses in April 2020. Her recent research has shown the impact of Long Covid on health, well-being, and cognition in a large community sample in England. Helen’s previous research was on the epidemiology and control of infectious diseases including HIV and STI, working closely with patients and communities. She established the Patient Experience Research Centre (PERC) at Imperial in 2011 to promote participatory approaches to improving healthcare and biomedical research. PERC now leads patient, public and community involvement across Imperial’s Faculty of Medicine.Helen co-leads research on the interaction between social, genetic and environmental determinants of health with a focus on inequality, and Chairs the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee of the Imperial Biomedical Research Centre. She trained in Medicine at Sheffield University, has a Masters in Epidemiology and a PhD in Public Health from the University of London."
