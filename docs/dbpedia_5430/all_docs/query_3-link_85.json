        "text": "Why Is Every Bond Actor’s Final Film Considered A Failure?\n\nWhether it’s our last job, or our last relationship, we like to think of the successes during it and not about the failures that led to the finale. The same thoughts can be applied to movies. It’s very rare for the final film in a storied franchise to end as successfully as its predecessors.\n\nWe’ve had six James Bond actors and each one of their last turns as 007 can be labeled as a failure. But why?\n\nTo say that Sean Connery “mailed it in” for his final Bond film (Diamonds Are Forever) would be an insult to hardworking envelopes. After George Lazenby’s one turn — we will get to him soon — Sean came out of 007 retirement in 1971 to star in this mishmash of a flick. Connery initially retired in 1967 after his 5th Bond movie (You Only Live Twice) and probably made the right career choice. Sean had grown tired of the character and wanted to prove he was an actor capable of playing more than just the world’s greatest secret agent.\n\nA record salary at that time of $1.2 million — which he gave to charity — was enough for Connery to say never say never again. Financially, Diamonds was a major box office hit. The movie was trash, but audiences were aching to see the original, the best, Bond back in action. Sean looked a lot older than 41, the villain and plot were weak and ludicrous, but who cares?! Sean Connery was back as Ian Fleming’s James Bond 007, even if it was only for one more time — officially that is.\n\nGeorge Lazenby is the college basketball freshman of the Bond actors. He was “one and done” in a very underrated Bond film (On Her Majesty’s Secret Service). As the decades have passed, the film has gained a lot of traction as one of the best Bonds ever. What’s holding it back? George Lazenby.\n\nLazenby wasn’t an actor. He was cast for his looks and his physicality. Connery announced he was leaving Bond during production of You Only Live Twice and the hunt was one for the next Bond. Lazenby could have had a long career as Bond, even though OHMSS wasn’t as huge a hit as previous Connery-007 flicks. He foolishly turned down a seven picture deal, which lead to Sean’s return in Diamonds. Now OHMSS is one of those “oh you mean that one movie, the one where Bond gets married, with that one guy who only played him once?” Such a shame.\n\nTo steal a line from the late, great Roger Moore, which I think he stole from a film critic… By the time 1985’s A View To A Kill was released, Roger Moore wasn’t just long in the tooth, he had tusks! Yes, Roger was a master at poking fun at himself. After 7 movies, 12 years as Bond, he knew it was over.\n\nThe longest running Bond actor probably should have called it quits after the box office success of 1983’s Octopussy. AVTAK has a hip (for the mid-80s) soundtrack, courtesy of Duran Duran’s title song, young villains played by oddities Grace Jones and Christopher Walked, plus a leading lady (Tanya Roberts) so young that her mother was younger than Roger Moore! AVTAK wasn’t the box office hit Moore and Bond producer Cubby Broccoli were used to. In December of 1985, 7 months after the movie was released, Moore officially announced his retirement. He was 58 years old.\n\nLicence To Kill, Timothy Dalton’s 2nd and last Bond movie, might be the film that nearly killed the 007 franchise for good. It came out in the very crowded summer of 1989. Batman, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Ghostbusters 2, just to name a few of the competitors.\n\nDalton was never the audiences favorite for the part. Over time, he’s gotten more credit. Some call his take on Bond ahead of its time, thanks to the success of Daniel Craig. Dalton’s serious tone came right after the 12 years of campy Moore. Also, always being thought of as the second choice for the role after Pierce Brosnan couldn’t get out of his TV contract, didn’t help. The film itself kind of has a made-for-TV, Miami Vice feel to it.\n\nTo this day, it is still the lowest ranking Bond when it comes to box office numbers. I’m including cost adjustment for inflation. Thanks to these low numbers and some legal battles, we didn’t see another James Bond film on the big screen for 6 years.\n\nPierce Brosnan had a very successful run as 007. All four of his movies were big hits. Critically acclaimed? Not so much. His 4th and final go at it came with Die Another Day. A movie so over the top that even Roger Moore made fun of it. Invisible cars, a Madonna cameo, kitesurfing a tsunami, and bad pun after pun after pun.\n\nMuch like Connery and Moore, audiences embraced Pierce’s Bond even if they knew the movies weren’t anything more than an excuse to stuff their faces with popcorn. With DAD, please add lots of cheese to your popcorn.\n\nSo where does this leave our current 007, Mr. Daniel Craig. It could have ended last November 2015 with Spectre. Not as bad a way to go out as Diamonds Are Forever or A View To A Kill or Die Another Day, but it still wasn’t as great as Casino Royale or Skyfall. Hell, it might not even be better than Quantum of Solace.\n\nWhen the 25th Bond movie is released — hopefully in late 2019 — Craig will go out with #5 and he will pass Roger Moore as the longest serving — in number of years — Bond actor. This final film is about his legacy now. Can he do what the actors before him failed to do? Go out on a high note.\n\nMovie Review: SKYFALL\n\nSometimes movies are all about timing. The year was 2012. It had been four years since we last had a 007 adventure. The summer of 2012 gave us the London Olympics, which included a short film by future Bond director Danny Boyle, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond and Queen Elizabeth as herself (insert your own dirty Bond girl name).\n\nOn top of all that, it was the 50 year anniversary of the Bond movie franchise. A new batch of special Blu-Rays could be added to your DVD collection. When Skyfall was released in early November 2012, the timing was perfect. Just in the same way it was for Goldfinger in 1964, The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977, and GoldenEye in 1995. The audience desperately wanted a new Bond movie. It also doesn’t hurt to have a great song and superb villain. There was a reason why Skyfall grossed over $1 billion dollars worldwide and adored by film critics. It’s all about timing.\n\nMy SKYFALL Notes:\n\nWhile I miss the gunbarrel in the opening shot, I do enjoy how Bond in the hallway makes for a proper substitute.\n\nThis has the best cinematography of any Bond film thanks to Roger Deakins. As well as the best looking Bond clothes. Those suits by Tom Ford impeccably fit Craig.\n\nI’d love to know more of Ronson’s backstory. Bond actually seems sad that his fellow agent is bleeding to death.\n\nThe pre-title sequence makes good use of Istanbul. Third time in the franchise. From cars to bikes to trains, this is an action sequence always on the move.\n\nThe cuff-straightening works for me. It’s a nod to the Moore/Brosnan old fashioned tie-straightening gag.\n\nAdele’s siren song and Daniel Kleinman’s visuals for the opening credits work beautifully together.\n\nAs much as I love this film, the plot has far too many unbelievable steps. Silva’s plan needs us to just give in and accept that he thought of every contingency imaginable.\n\nFrom locations, to British colloquialisms, I think this is the most British Bond movie ever made.\n\nI could see “Turkish Scorpion Drinking” on ESPN 2 at 4am.\n\nI would pay good money to see Bond’s three-month “death vacation.”\n\nThis script is one of the best in the franchise. So many great one on one scenes. Bond with M (Dench), Bond with new Q, Bond with (spoiler alert) Moneypenny, etc.\n\nBond doing DIY surgery is so Craig.\n\nRalph Fiennes is a great actor, but it’s almost too obvious that he will be the future M right from the start.\n\nSeverine is beautiful to look at, but wasted as a character.\n\nJavier Bardem as Silva is a bizarre delight. From his rats monologue, to his dentures, to his Max Zorin hair, he’s my favorite Bond villain ever.\n\nI don’t think Bond ever had a homosexual experience, but I do think he wanted to turn the tables on Silva.\n\nCraig is easily the best runner of the Bond actors. He could give Tom Cruise a run for his money. Pun heavily intended.\n\nWhat else is in Bond’s storage closet besides the Aston Martin?\n\nI love Albert Finney as Kincade, especially when he calls Judi Dench’s M “Emma”.\n\nI’m in the minority on this, but I enjoy the “Home Alone”/”Straw Dogs” third act.\n\nI wanted a fight between Bond and Silva. A thrown knife to the back isn’t good enough.\n\nI still get emotional watching Judi Dench die in Daniel Craig’s arms. This M and Bond duo had a genuine mother-son relationship.\n\nSkyfall has one of the greatest epilogues in movie history. It ends with you wanting the next Bond movie to start ASAP. We got Spectre three years later, and its plot ruins everything that made Skyfall fantastic.\n\nBond’s coolest moment? Entering the casino in Macau. A runner-up: kicking up the machine gun into his arms in Scotland.\n\nBond’s most embarrassing moment? That fight in the Komodo dragon pit was too much Roger Moore for a Daniel Craig Bond flick.\n\nBond’s best line? When Severine asks Bond if he will kill Silva for her and James replies with “Someone usually dies.”\n\nBest acting performance? In the greatest cast of a Bond movie, Dench is the MVP. In many ways, she is the true “Bond girl” in Skyfall.\n\nBond’s most “sexual predator” moment? Bond correctly guesses that Severine has been a sex worker since she was about 12 or 13, and what does he do? Next scene he sneaks into her shower for some steamy sex. Even Connery and Moore would say slow down!\n\nWorst line in the movie? “Put it all on red. It’s the circle of life.” Yeah, five and a half years later I still don’t understand what the hell James meant.\n\nWhat I noticed for the first time after watching this for the 36th time? After Bond finishes his drink and traps the scorpion with his glass, he gives the hand gesture that he’s buying the entire bar the next round. With what money James?!\n\nBest action sequence? It’s not the best fight in the series, but it’s the most beautifully shot… the silhouette fight between Bond and Patrice in the Shanghai skyscraper.\n\nWho or what is the title song about? I think it’s about Bond’s childhood and what kind of man he has become.\n\nBest looking cinematic moment? Everything in Shanghai and Macau.\n\nHow could the villain have succeeded? Silva did succeed. His goal was to kill M and he did. At the end, Bond failed to protect her. Silva did take his sweet time though, and was a tad too coy throughout.\n\nWhich other Bond actor could have starred in this movie? Since they make Bond out to be too old for his job, I think a Pierce Brosnan pushing 60 could have worked. Having said that, Craig looks so comfortable in his 3rd outing.\n\nDoes Bond ever think he might die? Not really, which is weird since kind of does die in the beginning. Bond is pretty fearless in this film. It’s as if he has a bit of a death wish.\n\nWhat would have made the movie better? Not much. I guess maybe cut out some of Silva’s pre-planned nonsense.\n\nWhat’s in a name? Bond doesn’t use an alias, but we do learn his parents names. Andrew Bond and Monique Delacroix.\n\nWhat’s in a title? Skyfall is the name of Bond’s childhood manor in Scotland.\n\nDrinking game: Take a shot of Macallan whiskey each time the word “bloody” is said. I told you this is the most British Bond movie ever!\n\n“WTF?!” moment: Judi Dench’s M becoming the first and only person in a Bond movie to say “fuck”.\n\nFun fact: The original title of the movie was “Once Upon A Spy” and the original script had a few differences, including Bond killing M at the end for her screwing everything up. That’s pretty dark.\n\nOverall ranking: 1st out of 25.\n\nReview synopsis: Skyfall does on the 50th anniversary, what Die Another Day couldn’t do on the 40th anniversary. Make us care about the legacy of James Bond. Only a handful of Bond films can combine action and pathos, like Skyfall does. Who knew Sam Mendes could direct an action movie? Especially one that IMHO is the greatest Bond movie of them all.\n\nJames Bond Battle Royale\n\nSix Bonds enter the train dining cart…only one Bond left standing.\n\nThe fighters: (all as James Bond) Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig.\n\nThe location: inside the dining cart of a moving train; the most used Bond fight location.\n\nThe rules: hand-to-hand combat, no weapons allowed (aside from what is inside the train), every Bond for themselves.\n\nBefore we see this battle royale, let’s take a closer look at each fighter and their respective styles.\n\nSEAN CONNERY – Lean, mean and moves smoothly for a tall man. Early Connery is in great shape for that era. A swimmer’s body. His fighting style is ruthless, but still with a touch of class to it. He will be the thinking man’s fighter on the train.\n\nGEORGE LAZENBY – His Bond fighting style was “bad ass.” In real life, George got the gig because he tested so well in the audition fight scenes. He actually broke the nose of the stunt man he tangled with. Just like Connery, in really good shape for that time. He will definitely take risks during the upcoming battle.\n\nROGER MOORE – All there is to say about Moore’s Bond fighting style is “judo chop!” Tall, in so-so shape, not much of a killer instinct in his scuffles. His charming personality won’t help him much on the train.\n\nTIMOTHY DALTON – Think of him as Craig 1.0, but his fighting skills don’t necessarily match his no nonsense attitude. His face looks intimidating, but the rest of him not so much. His reputation will have to save him during the fight on the train.\n\nPIERCE BROSNAN – If Dalton was Craig 1.0, Pierce was certainly Roger Moore 2.0 when it comes to ruthlessness. Brosnan has a few decent fights during his Bond tenure, but as the skinniest Bond he will have a lot to prove in the train Battle Royale.\n\nDANIEL CRAIG – The bloody (literally), slightly insane Bond. Craig’s fighting style is similar to what we saw with the Bourne franchise. Craig’s Bond is in tip-top shape, but he is easily the shortest of the six men. But he is the scrappiest.\n\nThe train dining cart is empty, aside from the fully stocked bar and the tables. Our six Bonds are alone and sizing one another up. Brosnan and Moore are the easy targets and Lazenby and Dalton don’t hesitate to mix it up. Craig and Connery don’t engage just yet. Moore puts up a surprisingly good fight against Dalton, while Brosnan is having trouble with the much rougher Lazenby.\n\nConnery jumps in against Moore, as the two actors who made the most 007 movies tangle. Connery dispatches Moore with the help of champagne bottle and a chair. He tosses Moore out of the window of the speeding train. Even at the end, Moore looks smashing. Lazenby finishes off Brosnan, who is grunting and sticking out his chin, with such a wild haymaker that it knocks Pierce out cold.\n\nConnery turns his attention to Dalton and roughs him up badly. Craig and Lazenby engage in a frenetic brawl, but George’s old-fashioned brawler ways are no match for Daniel’s “whatever it takes” attitude. Brosnan awakens only to be bashed over the head with a whiskey bottle by Lazenby, and then Craig jams a butterknife into Brosnan’s neck and waits for him to bleed out, and he turns his attention back to Lazenby.\n\nConnery strangles Dalton after delivering a beatdown that leaves Tim as bruised as he looked after he fought Sanchez in Licence To Kill. Craig chokes-out Lazenby with a long bar dishrag. Now we are down to the final two. Connery vs Craig. Sean uses his size advantage with his arm reach. Daniel hunkers down and uses his scrappy fighting style. Bottles, tables, chairs are all used during this confrontation. Connery thinks he has the upper hand as he stomps down on Craig, but Craig grabs a hold of Connery’s leg and flips him. Craig then tries to get Connery in a sleeper hold the same way he did to that Ugandan in Casino Royale. Connery does his best to shake Craig off, but after a long fight it’s no use. Connery loses this train fight.\n\nFive Bonds dispatched. Craig’s Bond, a bloody mess as always, drinks a bottle of vodka at the bar while looking at himself in the mirror.\n\nIs There a James Bond Movie Timeline?\n\nThe quick answer to this headline is NO.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I’ve watched Bond movies with the idea that these are just random missions, and events, in the life of one man. Think of James Bond like The Simpsons. The characters never grow drastically old, even if times change. If you try your hardest at creating a Bond universe timeline, you will end up with a massive headache and a nosebleed. With that in mind, I’ll give it a shot. The most important factor in all of this is YOU MUST throwout the silly notion that “James Bond” is a codename. There are a handful of times when his dead wife is mentioned, and thanks to the Craig films we know all about his childhood.\n\nJames Bond does have a codename. It’s 007.\n\nMY BOND MOVIE TIMELINE:\n\nCasino Royale – aka Bond Begins\n\nQuantum of Solace – a direct sequel to Casino Royale\n\nDr. No\n\nFrom Russia With Love – Spectre wants payback for Dr. No’s death\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThunderball\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service – Bond still on the hunt for Blofeld/Spectre\n\nDiamonds Are Forever – very brief act of revenge for the death of Bond’s wife\n\nLive And Let Die\n\nThe Man With The Golden Gun – the return of Sheriff J.W. Pepper\n\nThe Spy Who Loved Me\n\nMoonraker – Jaws reappears\n\nFor Your Eyes Only – we see the grave of Tracy (Bond’s wife)\n\nOctopussy\n\nA View To A Kill\n\nThe Living Daylights\n\nLicence To Kill\n\nGoldeneye\n\nTomorrow Never Dies\n\nThe World Is Not Enough\n\nDie Another Day – we see many of the gadgets used in past films\n\nSkyfall – we see a weary Bond, sick of his job\n\nSpectre – a sequel to Skyfall… but completely ruins this timeline\n\nMy timeline needs to be taken with a grain of salt. How does Judi Dench go from being Pierce Brosnan’s boss, all the way back to being young Daniel Craig’s boss? And of course, the film Spectre throws everything out the window with the ridiculous notion that Casino, Quantum, Skyfall are all connected. Oh and Bond and Blofeld are foster brothers?!\n\nThe only other film franchise with a more convoluted timeline is X-MEN.\n\nMovie Review: GOLDFINGER\n\nIt doesn’t matter how old you are, or whether or not you have seen the movie from beginning to end. When someone says Goldfinger, you know it. The song, the painted girl, the gadgets, the title villain himself, the laser scene, Pussy Galore, Oddjob, etc.\n\nDr. No and From Russia With Love were the first two films in the Bond franchise, but Goldfinger was the first one to set the tone for the entire series for decades to come.\n\nGOLDFINGER NOTES:\n\nNot sure James needs the seagull on his head in the opening scene.\n\nThis is the first movie where Connery needed a full hairpiece. And it shows. The top of his hair looks almost strawberry blonde.\n\nVery cool editing having Bond look at his watch, light his cigarette, and have the bombs goes off all at once.\n\nThe “shocking, positively shocking” scene still holds up today, although I’m not sure that lamp was plugged in when Bond smacked it into the bathtub.\n\nThe combo of John Barry’s score with Shirley Bassey’s title song is a dynamic 1-2 punch that is tough to beat.\n\nI’m not a fan of the title sequence showing upcoming clips from the movie. Also, why slip in the helicopter scene from the last flick, From Russia With Love?\n\nIf there were ever a thing as “Bond goes on Spring Break” the scenes in Miami would be it.\n\nBond slapping Dink’s ass, as he tells her to scoot off so he and his buddy Felix can have some “man talk”, is just one example that makes this the most misogynistic Bond movie. Or as some might call it… “a simpler time.”\n\nOnly Sean Connery could make a baby blue Terry cloth romper look cool.\n\nEven though she is only in the movie for a few minutes, Jill Masterson (played by Shirley Eaton) makes a lasting impression.\n\nHow long did it take for her to be covered in gold paint? How long was Bond knocked out for? She suffocated from being covered in gold paint? Are we sure Oddjob didn’t karate-chop her and then paint her?\n\n007 is really bad at his job in this film. His unnecessary meddling gets Masterson killed, her sister too eventually, and he presents himself as a target for Goldfinger.\n\nBond is at his snobby best when drinking Brandy.\n\nThis movie gives us our first ever Q branch scene. We get to see the legendary Aston Martin DB5 with all the bells and whistles. Q truly hates Bond in this scene.\n\nHaving GPS in a car must have blown the minds of 1964 audiences.\n\nGoldfinger (played by Gert Frobe) is so badly dubbed throughout this.\n\nThe golf scene does nothing to change my belief that this sport is dull.\n\nDon’t you think on Halloween caddies should dress up like Oddjob?\n\nBond’s caddie looks like someone out of Darby O’Gill and the Little People. Ironically, also starring Sean Connery.\n\nSome similarities between the golf scene and the backgammon scene from Octopussy.\n\nSo let me get this straight: Goldfinger is obsessed with covering things in gold, he cheats, he is a lying conman, he’s overweight, he pays women to be with him, he has a weird orange complexion, hmmmm…\n\nEven though the clothes are from 1964, this might be the best dressed Bond has ever been. At the very least, he looks like he would fit in on Mad Men.\n\nOddjob’s hat baffles me. I know it has an iron or steel rim. It can completely decapitate a statue, but not a human?\n\nBond does a lot of detective work in this movie, which I enjoy. Poorly though.\n\nOddjob speaks like a 16 month-old toddler.\n\nIn the novel, Pussy Galore is a lesbian. In this film, it’s only implied.\n\nOne of the rare times we see James with a 5 o’clock shadow. Also rare we get to see his handwriting.\n\nCan we get a shared universe or crossover between “Pussy Galore’s Flying Circus” and “Octopussy’s Circus”?\n\nJames Bond in Kentucky is something you may never see again. And yes, you can see them drive past a KFC.\n\nThe mobsters cast in the film are from stereotype theater.\n\nGoldfinger’s plan has a lot in common with Zorin’s plan in A View To A Kill. Replace gold with microchips, and a dirty bomb with an earthquake.\n\nFor those of you wondering what would have happened if Goldfinger’s plan had worked, Fort Knox’s gold would stop being radioactive in 2022!\n\nPussy Galore has man-hands.\n\nConnery saying “poo-say” is a delight.\n\nI’ve never drank a Mint Julep. They look disgusting.\n\nThe car crushing scene sure does drag on.\n\nThe soldiers playing dead always cracks me up.\n\nGoldfinger dressed up as an American General is pretty bonkers. The other soldiers can’t tell from his thick German accent? Do most military men carry a solid gold revolver?\n\nIs Goldfinger’s death, being sucked out of an airplane window, the most embarrassing next to Kananga inflating and exploding in Live And Let Die?\n\nTwo gaffs really bother. The bomb defused at 007 seconds, while Bond says it was stopped with only three seconds to go. And there is clearly a man behind Goldfinger on the plane at the end of the movie. Where did he go?\n\nBond’s coolest moment? Slipping out of his scuba wetsuit to reveal his white tux.\n\nBond’s most embarrassing moment? Flirting with the guard to get him to come into his cell and escape.\n\nBond’s best line? “Manners, Oddjob. I thought you always took your hat off to a lady.”\n\nBest acting performance? Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore ranks up there with the best Bond girls.\n\nBond’s most “sexual predator” moment? Bond forcing himself on Pussy Galore is the all-time answer to this question. All it takes is that barn scene for her to renounce her lesbianism.\n\nWorst line in the movie? Bond being an old fuddy-duddy with his diss of the Beatles.\n\nWhat I noticed for the first time after watching this for the 150th time? Pussy Galore’s co-pilot is reading a magazine while the plane is in flight.\n\nBest action sequence? The car chase at night at Goldfinger’s plant.\n\nWho or what is the title song about? It’s about the main villain and how James better watch out.\n\nBest looking cinematic moment? The hilltop road scene in Geneva.\n\nHow could the villain have succeeded? By splitting Bond in half with his laser. Instead, he fell for Bond’s “Operation Grand Slam” bluff.\n\nWhich other Bond actor could have starred in this movie? This is prime Connery. Just like with Moore in The Spy Who Loved Me and Craig in Skyfall, the third time is the charm.\n\nDoes Bond ever think he might die? During the famous laser table scene. Without the words “Operation Grand Slam” he would have been killed.\n\nWhat would have made the movie better? Cut the length of the golf scene and the car crushing scene. And keep in Bond’s original reply when Pussy Galore tells him her name. “I know, but what’s your name?”\n\nWhat’s in a name? No alias for James in this one. And he could have used one.\n\nWhat’s in a title? Goldfinger is not only the name of the villain, but it’s also the title of the novel by Bond author/creator Ian Fleming.\n\nDrinking game: Take a sip of your Mint Julep each time “Goldfinger” is said.\n\n“WTF?!” moment: The machine gun-totting grandma!\n\nFun fact: This is the only Sean Connery – James Bond movie without the evil organization Spectre behind the villain’s plan.\n\nOverall ranking: 7th out of 25 movies.\n\nReview synopsis: Despite looking very dated in our #MeToo #TimesUp era, Goldfinger remains as fun a Bond movie ever made. There’s a reason why most people consider it the best. I find it slightly overrated, but you can’t go wrong with all the elements involved. This was the start of the Bond phenomenon and it’s easy to see why.\n\nDoes James Bond Suffer From CTE?\n\nWe all know James Bond lives a dangerous lifestyle. From all the smoking, the drinking, the unprotected sex, and avoiding murder just about everyday, it truly is “death for breakfast” for 007. But there’s one part of Bond that we don’t focus enough on. His mind.\n\nI’m not even going into the psychological scarring that he has endured his entire life (death of parents at a young age, the hundreds and hundreds of people he has murdered, sex with May Day, etc.). I’m talking about all the blows to his head (raises a Roger Moore eyebrow) he has suffered in 24 films over the last 55 years.\n\nFootball players aren’t the only ones who should be weary of CTE. Bond’s employers over at MI6 better make sure he has a CAT scan from a neurologist. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma. It’s the dire condition that Will Smith tried to explained to NFL fans in the film Concussion.\n\nIt’s extremely dangerous for a human being to lose consciousness for long periods. In this case study, I won’t even count how many times 007 has passed out from poisonous gas, or a dart or a drink. Strictly sticking to blunt force trauma to the head and neck region.\n\nFrom Russia With Love: Bond is knocked out for nearly a full minute after being hit on the back of the head by Grant’s gun.\n\nGoldfinger: Bond takes a karate chop to the back of the neck from Oddjob, while checking the fridge for champagne, but after he insults the Beatles’ music. Bond is out for a damn long time. Long enough for his new girlfriend, Jill, to be covered head to toe in gold paint.\n\nYou Only Live Twice: Knocked out cold by a Kobe docks worker, with what appears to be a wrench or solid piece of wood. James doesn’t wake up until Helga Brandt slaps him around.\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service: Bond is trying to have sex with just about every girl at the Swiss health clinic, but unfortunately ends up lifting the sheets up to find the frightening Irma Bunt. He’s then hit over the head by an unseen thug, has some weird LSD-type of visions, and is finally awake to hear Blofeld wish his a Merry Christmas.\n\nDiamonds Are Forever: While retrieving money for diamonds at a funeral home, Bond is hit on the back of the head with an urn by Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. It takes being nearly burned alive in a coffin for Bond to wake up.\n\nLive And Let Die: Tee-Hee uses his metal wrist/claw to strike the back of Bond’s neck. Bond is out long enough to be dragged into a car, headed for a gator farm.\n\nThe Man With The Golden Gun: Bond takes a blow to the back of the head from Nick Nack’s toy-looking trident.\n\nMoonraker: Bond is making out with Holly Goodhead on the grass, when faux orderlies spoil the moment with a club to the back of the neck.\n\nFor Your Eyes Only: Even when it’s the good guys, James still takes a beating. On the beach, kneeling over yet another dead lover, 007 gets hit on the back of the neck with a harpoon gun by one of Columbo’s men.\n\nOctopussy: The henchman Gobinda karate chops Bond inside his beautiful Indian hotel.\n\nA View To A Kill: Another gun to the back of the head deal. Bond only wakes up as the car he’s in is about to sink to the bottom of a lake.\n\nLicence To Kill: A double whammy here. First knocked out by ninjas and then right after, an explosion causes debris to fall on Bond’s head. He wakes up to the most bizarre statue ever.\n\nSpectre: After taking a club to the knee, Bond gets hit on the back of the head after listening to Waltz’ Blofeld give a little speech.\n\nConnery and Moore definitely took the most blows to the noggin. Brosnan does suffer some unconscious moments, but not due to head trauma. Craig is too busy being a bloody mess to worry about his neck and head.\n\nSo does the world’s greatest secret agent suffer from CTE?\n\nThe symptoms include:\n\nmemory loss\n\nconfusion\n\nimpaired judgment\n\nimpulse control problems\n\naggression\n\ndepression\n\nanxiety\n\nsuicidal tendencies\n\nMovie Review: THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH\n\nIt’s the last Bond picture of the 20th century, so the producers made sure that The World Is Not Enough would feel like it was in a time capsule, to be neatly stored away and unearthed decades later. This is Brosnan’s third turn as the secret agent, and while the movie doesn’t match up to previous classic third outings (Connery’s Goldfinger, Moore’s The Spy Who Loved Me), there is a very fine film hiding somewhere during this 125 minute feature.\n\nTWINE Notes:\n\nWhile Goldeneye is Brosnan’s best Bond flick, TWINE gives us Brosnan’s best acting performance as James Bond.\n\nThere are a few similarities between TWINE and Skyfall: MI6 explodes, Scotland used as a hideout, M in the crosshairs of the villain’s plot, Bond hurt and needing medical clearance.\n\nJames Bond wearing eyeglasses (even if it’s all a ruse), looks odd to me.\n\nJust how long are those blind strings in that Spanish office?! Where’s Bond’s Goldeneye belt when he needs it?!\n\nThe Clinton/Lewinsky cigar joke still gives me a chuckle, and makes me nostalgic for the late 90s.\n\nThis is easily the longest pre-title sequence in the history of the franchise. Even if it feels like it takes forever, I think it’s one of the best overall PTS.\n\nBond hijacks Q’s retirement fishing boat. I’d pay good money to have seen Q try to operate it.\n\nLove the tie-straightening under water. It’s a classic Moore/Brosnan move.\n\nBond chasing the “cigar girl” assassin from the Thames to a hot air balloon is the icing on the action cake for this opening.\n\nI do enjoy a hurt Bond. A broken collarbone is no joke.\n\nThe title song by Garbage is above-average. The choice of the band is so late-90s alternative rock, that it goes back to my time capsule theory.\n\nI kind of dig the title credits, with the oil-soaked lady silhouettes.\n\nSophie Marceau is one of the best actresses in the entire series. But how do we define her character Elektra King? Is she a Bond girl? Villainess? For that matter, is Robert Carlyle’s Renard the main villain or just Elektra’s henchman? Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) is certainly the Bond girl of the movie…yeah, we will get to that later.\n\nBond having sex with his doctor (her name is Molly Warmflash!) in order to get medical clearance is something we would have seen Connery or Moore do.\n\nThe final scene of Desmond Llewelyn as Q is ruined by the unnecessary lines of “two things” he always taught Bond. In all his years and scenes with Bond, he never told him to “never let them see you bleed” nor “always have an escape plan.”\n\nI wonder how practical that avalanche-proof ski jacket really is.\n\nAzerbaijan has to be the oddest location to shoot a Bond film.\n\nRenard has a bullet in his head that is slowly killing him. He grows stronger by the day and can’t feel pain. He needs more scars and bruises.\n\nJames Bond has gone skiing five times in the film series. TWINE is the worst one of the five. It’s rather dull and lifeless.\n\nThis is the first time we get to see Bond’s Universal Exports employee ID.\n\nIs Denise Richards the worst Bond girl ever? No. It’s Tanya Roberts in A View To A Kill. But it’s close. It’s not really her fault. Making her a nuclear physicist, who dresses like Lara Croft, is laughable. She was 28 during the filming, and next to a mature 46 year-old Brosnan, she looks barely 18.\n\nI love caviar, but I still get grossed out watching Robbie Coltrane’s Valentin Zukovsky nearly drowning in it.\n\nThis film suffers from too many twists that we see coming a mile away, and a plot that an audience really doesn’t care about. Was the monopoly of oil pipelines really a major topic in the late 90s?\n\nHaving just said that, when Bond and Christmas are in the pipeline, that does look like a fun theme park ride.\n\nSpeaking of a fun ride, how about that sex/choke chair at Elektra’s place in Istanbul?\n\nBond cold-bloodedly shooting, killing Elektra was a rare Fleming-type of moment for Brosnan’s Bond.\n\nThe submarine fight between Bond and Renard does not rank up there with the best, but the sub crashing into the ocean floor was a nice touch.\n\nYes, the last line is groan-worthy. But when you have a Bond actor like Brosnan (channeling his inner-Roger Moore) and you have a Bond girl named Christmas… this is what we get. And frankly, what we deserve.\n\nBond’s coolest moment? The opening scene in the banker’s office in Spain. Calm, confident, and dangerous.\n\nBond’s most embarrassing moment? Carrying a bag full of sneakers.\n\nBond’s best line? “I see you like to put your money where your mouth is.” – Pointing to the gold teeth of Mr. Bullion.\n\nBest acting performance? Brosnan, Carlyle, and of course Judi Dench, all give solid performances, but Sophie Marceau is so good as Elektra that she makes Richards’ Christmas look even worse.\n\nBond’s most “sexual predator” moment? Bond playing peeping Tom inside the casino with the x-ray sunglasses. He might as well have been drooling.\n\nWorst line in the movie? When Bond asks Christmas if she can operate the machine inside the pipeline she replies with “It doesn’t taking a degree in nuclear physics.” I always feel like Bond could have replied with “Oh so you can then.”\n\nWhat I noticed for the first time after watching this for the 84th time? In the MI6 Scotland hideaway, there’s a portrait of former M actor Bernard Lee.\n\nBest action sequence? The caviar warehouse scene. It helps to have David Arnold as composer.\n\nWho or what is the title song about? I want to say this is sung from Elektra’s point of view. Almost as if she is seducing Bond.\n\nBest looking cinematic moment? As boring as the ski chase is, I’m a sucker for some snow cinematography. One shot in particular looks straight out of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.\n\nHow could the villain have succeeded? Not let her grudge against her father and M get in her way of controlling the oil company.\n\nWhich other Bond actor could have starred in this movie? With it’s shifting tone from serious drama to campy action flick, Brosnan is the best Bond actor to handle this type of screenplay.\n\nDoes Bond ever think he might die? A couple of times. When he is about to get shot in the Spanish office, and of course when Elektra has him strapped to the sex/choke chair. One last screw indeed.\n\nWhat would have made the movie better? Casting a better actress than Denise Richards. I hate to keep picking on her. She’s beautiful and I think she is doing the best she can. But she sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nWhat’s in a name? Bond pretends to be an atomic scientist named Dr. Arkov.\n\nWhat’s in a title? The World Is Not Enough comes from Bond author Ian Fleming. This is the family motto on the Bond crest. It’s referenced in both the novel and film OHMSS.\n\nDrinking game: Take a shot of Belvedere vodka each time the line “There’s no point in living, if you can’t feel alive” is said. Including in the song.\n\n“WTF?!” moment: John Cleese as “R”, Q’s replacement. He seems like too well known of a comedian for the part.\n\nFun fact: Originally, the pre-title sequence was just the office scene in Bilbao, Spain. After director Michael Apted tested the film, he decided to include the Thames boat scene.\n\nOverall ranking: 19 out of 25 films.\n\nReview synopsis: There’s a lot to like about The World Is Not Enough. It’s one of the few Bonds to be a “thinking man’s action movie.” It has elements of For Your Eyes Only and Skyfall. What weighs it down are scenes with different tones, one major casting error, and being too “late 90s” if that is even a thing yet. I like Pierce Brosnan as James Bond 007, but this movie along with Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day, should be considered The Mediocre Trilogy after such a promising start in Goldeneye.\n\nWho Are The Other 00s?\n\nWe know who 007 is. We know his missions, his girlfriends, his enemies, we even know a little about his past. Over the years, there have been theories that “James Bond” is just a moniker given to whichever person is the current 007 over at MI6. Of course, we know this can’t be true. Specifically after the films Skyfall and Spectre delved into Bond’s childhood.\n\nSo it’s settled. All six Bond actors have been the same man, playing the same role of British secret agent 007. Which got me thinking…where are the other 00s?\n\n001 – As far as we know, there has never been any mention of this agent during any of the 24 official films. In Raymond Benson’s Bond novel, Doubleshot, 001 is mentioned. His name is Edward Donne.\n\n002 – Ah good old Bill Fairbanks! He was shot in Beirut by Francisco Scaramanga, AKA The Man With The Golden Gun. A golden bullet right through the neck. Or at least that’s how Moneypenny says it went down. Bond later finds the bullet, being worn as a “charm” by a belly dancer, and swallows it. We have an idea how Bond got the bullet out of him.\n\nWe can also add a 002 to The Living Daylights. All we know about him was that he was eliminated from an MI6 exercise when he parachuted into a tree. He’s too klutzy to be a secret agent. He also looks like he is wearing a Roger Moore – Tom Brady hybrid mask.\n\n003 – Not much to go on here, other than Bond finds him buried in snow in Siberia during the pre-title sequence of A View To A Kill. Judging from his locket, he appeared to have a family. But since MI6 prefers single, maladjusted young men, who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and country… I’m going to guess the picture came with the locket.\n\n004 – Here we have another casualty of the spy games played in the opening of The Living Daylights. Unlike 002, this agent actually loses his life. 004 is murdered by having his rock climbing rope cut. He is sent plummeting down a cliff to his death in Gibraltar.\n\n005 – Just like 001, he’s nowhere to be seen. Although in the Kingsley Amis 007 novel Colonel Sun, he does get a shoutout.\n\n006 – The most famous (infamous?) MI6 agent not named James Bond. Alec Trevelyan (played by Sean Bean) is the main villain in Goldeneye. He was apparently shot and killed on a mission, but later it’s revealed that he faked his death. In actuality, he’s a Russian who is running a crime syndicate.\n\n007 – I don’t know. Some British guy of Scottish/Swiss heritage, who drinks too much, has lots of unprotected sex, gambles all of his government salary, and he might have mommy issues. That’s all I got.\n\n008 – This guy is M’s “don’t make me turn this car around” agent. He’s been mentioned in two movies (Goldfinger and The Living Daylights). Both times M has threatened to take Bond off a mission and replace him with 008.\n\n009 – This agent might be the unluckiest of the bunch. In Octopussy, he is not only stabbed in the back, but he has to suffer the humiliation of dying dressed as a clown.\n\nIn the film The World Is Not Enough, it is mentioned that M assigned 009 to kill Renard. He shoots Renard in the head, but for some odd reason Renard lives and gets stronger, with the bullet slowly killing off his senses. Licence to kind of kill?\n\nIn the last Bond flick, Spectre, 007 steals 009’s Aston Martin and takes it to Rome.\n\nIn Thunderball and The World Is Not Enough, we get to see a group of MI6 00s. We don’t know names or numbers, but we can guess that James Bond is the best of the bunch. The only question I have is… do you think Bond has sexually harassed that one female MI6 agent? Yeah, probably.\n\nMovie Review: THE SPY WHO LOVED ME\n\nAfter 1974’s The Man With The Golden Gun, film critics and the movie-going public were having their doubts about the James Bond franchise. It seemed stale. As if it had run its course. In the summer of 1977, Roger Moore’s 3rd outing proved the doubters wrong with The Spy Who Loved Me. Not only is it considered Moore’s best 007 adventure, but it’s also in the top tier of the entire Bond series.\n\nTSWLM Notes:\n\nThe tagline was “biggest, best, Bond and beyond.” It lives up to this billing, although this is basically a retelling of You Only Live Twice, which was also directed by Lewis Gilbert. Replace the YOLT space capsule with submarines and you have TSWLM.\n\nSpy gives us perhaps the greatest, most iconic, pre-title sequence. Bond in his bright yellow ski suit (Moore always being flashy) escaping from Russians, skiing off a mountain and opening up his Union Jack parachute. I wasn’t born yet (about 11 months away), but I wish I could have seen this opening in packed theater. I’m sure it was an epic experience.\n\nCarly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” adds to the list of things that make The Spy Who Loved Me so memorable. This old-fashioned, torch-song, ranks among the very best Bond theme songs ever. Match it will Maurice Binder’s risqué titles and you have a Bond match made in heaven.\n\nBarbara Bach’s Russian Agent XXX (they weren’t even trying to subtle anymore!) is supposed to be Bond’s equal, but she doesn’t always live up to his high spy standards. Bach has an interesting beauty that keeps her from being a forgettable Bond girl.\n\nThis movie, between Bach and Caroline Munro and the busty hotel desk clerk, has the most cleavage in Bond movie history. If you’re looking for that sort of thing.\n\nIf you are looking for lots of bad 70s fashion, including lots of tan on brown clothing, TSWLM covers that too. Roger Moore’s ties are as big as his Union Jack parachute.\n\nSpeaking of fashion, always nice to see 007 in his naval uniform. You Only Live Twice and Tomorrow Never Dies are the only other movies, besides this one, were we get to see him be Commander Bond.\n\nI would pay good money to see that Egyptian pyramid presentation. Later on, how did MI6 turn the ruins into their office?!\n\nThe villain Stromberg is just a low-rent Blofeld. Check closely for his webbed hands, which is probably why he doesn’t like shaking hands. He’s also the most comfortable villain in the series. His comfy clothes and cozy furniture, and calm aquarium… minus the shark tank.\n\nJaws is the most iconic Bond henchman, right up there with Oddjob. I do have some questions about him though: What does he do with those teeth? He bites right through objects, but with humans he just nibbles. Also, sometimes he’s very smart, other times he is borderline mentally handicapped.\n\nThis movie also has the rare mention of James’ dead wife. Moore handles this emotional scene quite well.\n\nDuring the train fight between Bond and Jaws, you can really see the size difference. Roger Moore was a tall man at 6’3, but Richard Kiel at 7’2 is like from another planet. Check out during the brawl, Kiel’s hands are practically the size of Moore’s face.\n\nElon Musk’s favorite car, the Lotus Esprit makes a grand entrance in Italy. Hopefully in the near future, all Tesla vehicles will be able to go underwater too.\n\nWhen Bond’s car rises from the ocean, and Moore rolls down the window to throw out a fish, this might be the most Roger Moorish Bond thing he ever did in seven films. His neighborly nod to the villainous helicopter pilot Naomi is right up there too.\n\nThe climatic battle between blue uniforms (good guys) and red uniforms (bad guys) inside Stromberg’s submarine swallowing HQ, is another You Only Live Twice-type of scene. Just without the ninja’s and hallowed-out volcano.\n\nWe get to see Bond diffuse a nuclear bomb like he’s playing the game Operation.\n\nNo matter how many times I see this movie, I always think the two missles will end up striking each other in the sky.\n\nAs much as I love the scene of Bond riding the jet-ski, on his way to save Anya (XXX) from Stromberg, I do wonder how long it took him to put it all together?\n\nIs Stromberg’s elevator: the best or worst? I feel like many people would have been dropped into that shark tank by accident.\n\nJaws vs that shark is Pay-Per-View fighting at its best. Where was Jaws swimming to at the end?\n\nThe closing credits, after Bond’s cheeky final line, has one of the oddest musical cues ever. Instead of Carly Simon singing “Nobody Does It Better”, we get what sounds like a gay man’s chorus singing the tune. Which then transitions into Simon’s. Strange!\n\nAt the very end of the credits we get the classic JAMES BOND WILL RETURN IN… but it reads FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. The movie directly after TSWLM was Moonraker. Why was Bond’s next mission in space? Well, TSWLM opened up two months after Star Wars. Bond producer Cubby Broccoli wanted to strike while the space iron was hot.\n\nBond’s coolest moment? When he’s at the Mojave Club. Moore is as charming as can be, while also doing some solid spying.\n\nBond’s most embarrassing moment? The van scene. I love watching James Bond do a Roger Moore comedy bit, but even here he’s pushing it. Just give her the damn keys!\n\nBond’s best line? When one is in Egypt, one should delve deeply into its treasures.\n\nBest acting performance? I’m going to give this to Moore. He’s so natural this third go-around as the world’s most famous secret agent.\n\nBond’s most “sexual predator” moment? He starts making out with Fekkesh’s secretary within two minutes of meeting her.\n\nWorst line in the movie? Shaken, but not stirred. – Anya (XXX)\n\nWhat I noticed for the first time after watching this for the 177th time? When Bond meets Stromberg, he notices a woman’s severed hand in the aquarium. It’s Stromberg’s lady friend that he fed to his sharks in his first scene.\n\nBest action sequence? I love the car chase that leads into the ocean.\n\nWho or what is the title song about? I believe this song is about Bond’s amazing love making skills. Oh and that he’s also very good at his job.\n\nBest looking cinematic moment? That ski jump off a mountain opening, without a doubt.\n\nHow could the villain have succeeded? I have major issues with his plan. Destroying the Earth so we can all live underwater doesn’t seem very thought-out. For example, we need air. So I say drop the entire plan and start from scratch.\n\nWhich other Bond actor could have starred in this movie? Nobody did this one better. Roger is a perfect 007 in this.\n\nDoes Bond ever think he might die? For a second or two, he does think Anya will shoot him at the very end.\n\nWhat would have made the movie better? A John Barry soundtrack. Nothing against Marvin Hamlisch, but not every track works for a Bond flick.\n\nWhat’s in a name? Bond goes by the name Robert Sterling. A married marine biologist.\n\nWhat’s in a title? The Spy Who Loved Me is an Ian Fleming title, although there is 0% of the novel in this movie.\n\nDrinking game: Wait until the 3rd act to drink your Bacardi on the rocks every time a grenade goes off during the battle.\n\n“WTF?!” moment: Jaws taking a bite out of that board of wood for no reason!\n\nFun fact: Stanley Kubrick helped out designer Ken Adam with the lighting.\n\nOverall ranking: 5th out of the 25 movies.\n\nReview synopsis: The Spy Who Loved Me is a Bond “best of” compilation. This is the quintessential Roger Moore – James Bond movie. It checks off all the boxes: great opening scene, ear-wormy theme song, beautiful women, stunning locations, world-domination plot, a remarkable henchman, and a leading actor hitting his stride in his third Bond movie.\n\nThe Bondies: James Bond Academy Awards\n\nTonight is Oscar night, so there’s no better time than now to create my own James Bond-type of Academy Awards. These are my personal choices, with a side-note… *if any James Bond movie was nominated for an Oscar, they automatically got nominated in that specific category for my Bondies.\n\nBest Picture\n\nCasino Royale\n\nFrom Russia With Love\n\nGoldfinger\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service\n\nSkyfall\n\nAnd the winner is… Skyfall\n\nBest Director\n\nMartin Campbell (Casino Royale)\n\nLewis Gilbert (The Spy Who Loved Me)\n\nGuy Hamilton (Goldfinger)\n\nSam Mendes (Skyfall)\n\nTerence Young (From Russia With Love)\n\nAnd the winner is… Sam Mendes (Skyfall)\n\nBest Actor\n\nPierce Brosnan (The World Is Not Enough)\n\nSean Connery (From Russia With Love)\n\nDaniel Craig (Casino Royale)\n\nTimothy Dalton (Licence To Kill)\n\nRoger Moore (For Your Eyes Only)\n\nAnd the winner is… Daniel Craig (Casino Royale)\n\nBest Actress\n\nJudi Dench (Skyfall)\n\nEva Green (Casino Royale)\n\nOlga Kurylenko (Quantum Of Solace)\n\nSophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough)\n\nDiana Rigg (On Her Majesty’s Secret Service)\n\nAnd the winner is… Judi Dench (Skyfall)\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nPedro Armendariz (From Russia With Love)\n\nJavier Bardem (Skyfall)\n\nChristopher Lee (The Man With The Golden Gun)\n\nMads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale)\n\nRobert Shaw (From Russia With Love)\n\nAnd the winner is… Javier Bardem (Skyfall)\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nJudi Dench (Casino Royale)\n\nFamke Janssen (Goldeneye)\n\nGrace Jones (A View To A Kill)\n\nLotte Lenya (From Russia With Love)\n\nBerenice Marlohe (Skyfall)\n\nAnd the winner is… Judi Dench (Casino Royale)\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\n“Casino Royale” by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade\n\n“From Russia With Love” by Richard Maibaum\n\n“Goldfinger” by Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn\n\n“Live And Let Die” by Tom Mankiewicz\n\n“On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” by Richard Maibaum\n\nAnd the winner is… “Casino Royale” by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\n“Goldeneye” by Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein\n\n“Licence To Kill” by Michael G.
