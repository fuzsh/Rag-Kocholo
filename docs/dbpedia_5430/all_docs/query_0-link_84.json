        "text": "Commander James Bond CMG is a Senior Operational Officer of the Double-O Section, an ultra-covert Black Ops unit within the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). As an agent of MI6, Bond holds cryptonym \"007\". The '00' prefix indicates his discretionary licence to kill in the performance of his duties. He was created and developed by the British author and former naval intelligence officier Ian Fleming.\n\nSean Connery was the first actor to perform the role on the cinematographic adaptations. He was doubled by stuntmen Bob Simmons, George Leech, Alf Joint, and Bell Rocket Belt test pilot William P. Suitor.[1] He appeared in Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and Diamonds Are Forever (1971). In 1983, he returned to the role for the last time in the non-EON Productions James Bond film, Never Say Never Again. In addition Connery also provided his voice and likeness for 2005's video game adaptation of From Russia with Love.\n\nBiography[]\n\nShared Background[]\n\nAlthough very little of James Bond's past is directly addressed in Sean Connery's films, the TV special The Incredible World of James Bond which aired in the United States the day after Thanksgiving 1965 as a promotion for the upcoming theatrical release of Thunderball gave a biography similar to the Ian Fleming novels of the character including spending part of childhood in Glencoe, Scotland and his father was a travelling salesman, but he became orphaned at the age of eleven. Later, he briefly attends Eton College, but is removed then being sent to Fettes College in Scotland, his father's school.\n\nAfter leaving Fettes, earlier EON films note that Bond studied at Cambridge University.[2] [3] There, he achieved a first in Oriental languages.[4] Following his graduation, Bond joined the Ministry of Defence and became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves, rising though the ranks to commander. Bond applied to M for a position within the \"Secret Service\", part of the Civil Service, and rose to the rank of principal officer.\n\nDr. No (1962)[]\n\nShortly before his next assignment, M, Bond's superior in MI6, gave him the choice of either selecting a new weapon on a mission to investigate the recent disappearance of British Secret Service operative John Strangways or to return to standard intelligence duties after an incident with his Beretta M1934. He was then given a choice by Major Boothroyd of using a Walther PPK or a Smith & Wesson .38 Special 5-round hammerless revolver. Bond reluctantly decided to take the weapons on the mission and the Walther proved valuable in Jamaica, where Strangways had gone missing.\n\nAlthough Bond's life was threatened on the mission several times by various wouldbe assassins, one of whom placed a tarantula in his bed, Bond found help in CIA agent Felix Leiter and Cayman fisherman, Quarrel, who aided Bond in his investigation of Strangways' disappearance. After finally determining that a criminal operative named Dr. No was responsible for Strangways' murder, Bond killed Dr. No in revenge and destroyed his island, Crab Key, before escaping in a boat with a beautiful Jamaican native named Honey Ryder. The two later encountered a Navy ship whose crew offered to tow their boat back to the Jamaican mainland.\n\nFrom Russia with Love (1963)[]\n\nBond later returned to London but, six months after he had left the city, he was sent on a mission to Istanbul in an attempt to obtain the Lektor decoder device from a stunning Russian cipher clerk named Tatiana Romanova, who had supposedly fallen in love with a photograph of him. Yet Tatiana had unknowingly been set up by the No. 3 of the criminal organization SPECTRE, Rosa Klebb who sought to avenge the murder of Dr. No. Bond was aided by Kerim Bey, who helped the British agent bring both the device and Romanova from Istanbul to Venice.\n\nBut despite several SPECTRE agents attempting to kill Bond, most notably Bulgarian assassin Krilencu at a Gypsy camp and the devious assassin Red Grant, who attempted to garrote Bond on the Orient Express before he was killed himself after being tricked into opening Bond's Attaché Case in a manner that detonates a tear gas booby trap, allowing Bond to attack and kill him. Bond and Romanova escape with the lektor to Venice. Rosa Klebb, disguised as a hotel maid, attempts to steal back the lektor and kill Bond with her Dagger Shoes, but ends up being shot by Romanova.\n\nGoldfinger (1964)[]\n\nPreventing Mexican Revolutions[]\n\nSubsequently, Bond was sent on a mission to Mexico, where he ensured that a revolutionary named Mr. Ramirez could no longer finance his revolutions. After the successful completion of his mission, Bond was attacked by an assailant, who he killed before taking a plane to Miami.\n\nInvestigating Auric Goldfinger[]\n\nIn Miami, Bond was instructed to observe bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger, who was staying at the same hotel. However, Bond became romantically involved with Goldfinger's girlfriend, Jill Masterson, who later died of skin suffocation as a result of being entirely covered in gold. Bond returned to London, where he was ordered to investigate Goldfinger's involvement in the possibly illegal transportation of gold, but he was warned that, if he treated the assignment as a personal vendetta, he would be replaced on the mission by 008.\n\nAlfred Blacking, manager of the golf club, introduces Bond to Goldfinger noting Bond is an old club member. 007 and Goldfinger play a round of golf together in which Goldfinger cheats, but Bond still wins. While investigating Goldfinger, Bond traveled from England to Geneva, Switzerland, where he met Jill Masterson's vengeful sister, Tilly Masterson, before she was killed by Goldfinger's henchman, Oddjob, with the Razor-Rimmed Hat that he always wore. Bond determined that Goldfinger was indeed illegally smuggling gold but he was soon imprisoned by the criminal, who ordered his transportation to the United States, where the spy learned the specifics of the criminal's planned Operation Grand Slam (the robbery of Fort Knox). Bond ultimately prevented the criminal's destructive plan from becoming a reality, stopping the Atomic Bomb from detonating, and managed to kill both Oddjob by electrocuting him through his hat and, finally, Goldfinger himself.\n\nThunderball (1965)[]\n\nIn France, Bond fought and killed SPECTRE operative Colonel Jacques Bouvar, avenging the murder of two of Bond's former colleagues. After encountering several SPECTRE agents at a health spa in the south of England, Bond investigates the hijacking of an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs, which had been taken by SPECTRE. The organisation demands a ransom against Britain and the United States for the return of the bombs. Bond follows a lead to the Bahamas, where he meets up with his CIA counterpart and friend Felix Leiter.\n\nThe pair suspect a rich playboy, Emilio Largo, and search the area around his yacht and then the area where they think the yacht may have travelled. After finding the plane—but without the nuclear devices on board—the two agents arrange for Largo's yacht to be tracked and ambushed once the bombs are being moved by Largo. Bond succeeded and Largo was ultimately killed by his vengeful mistress Domino.\n\nYou Only Live Twice (1967)[]\n\nShortly thereafter, Bond traveled to Japan, where he faked his own death to avert attention from SPECTRE. However, he was then sent by M to investigate the capture of a U.S. spacecraft in Japan to by an unidentified spacecraft. Upon his arrival, Bond is contacted by Aki, assistant to the Japanese secret service leader Tiger Tanaka. Bond established that the mastermind behind the hijacking is Ernst Stavro Blofeld head of SPECTRE and follows the trail to Blofeld's island headquarters.\n\nBond trains with Tanaka in ninjitsu who changes his appearance to be Japanese as cover and weds him to Kissy Suzuki. Bond and Kissy find Blofeld's lair in a Volcano. Tanaka's ninjas troops attack the island, while Bond manages to distract Blofeld and create a diversion which allows him to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the battle, Mr. Osato is killed by Blofeld, who activates the base's self-destruct system and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas escape through the cave tunnel before it explodes, and are rescued by submarine.\n\nDiamonds Are Forever (1971)[]\n\nBond raced around the globe looking for Blofeld until he found him during a plastic surgery operation. After a fight, Bond apparently killed the SPECTRE head by melting him in hot mud.\n\nBond is then tasked with investigating a major diamond smuggling ring which begins in Africa and runs through Holland and the United Kingdom to the United States. Disguised as professional smuggler and murderer Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case: he is given the diamonds and travels on to the US, where he is met by Felix Leiter. Bond moves through the chain, which leads to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte.\n\nBond follows the diamonds to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a Research Laboratory owned by Whyte, where he finds that an Orbital Laser Weapon is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains to him that the satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an Offshore Oil Rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.\n\nNever Say Never Again (1983)[]\n\nBond makes his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond is stabbed in the side by the girl that might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is seemingly killed.\n\nIt is revealed the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. M orders Bond to enter a health clinic to get back into shape. While there, he discovers a myserious nurse named Fatima Blush and her patient Jack Petachi who has undergone eye surgery so that he matches the retinal pattern of the American President. A killer later tries to kill Bond, although Bond defeats him.\n\nPetachi inflitrates an American base and helps SPECTRE (Led by Maximillian Largo and Ernst Stavro Blofeld) succesfully capture two nuclear warheads. The 00-section is reactivated and Bond is sent to the bahamas to track down the missiong weapons. When Largo's yacht heads for Nice, France, Bond goes there and joins forces with his French contact Nicole, and his CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter. Bond meets Domino Petachi, who reveals that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, while dancing with Domino, he informs her that Jack, her brother, had been killed on Largo's orders. Bond later attempts to make Largo jealous by kissing her in front of a one-way mirror. Enraged, Largo traps Bond and takes him and Domino to Palmyra. Largo punishes Domino for her betrayal by selling her to passing Arabs. Bond escapes from his prison and rescues her.\n\nAfter the first warhead is found and defused in Washington, D.C., they track Largo. Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Leiter's team and Largo's men in the temple. In the confusion, Largo makes a getaway with the second warhead. Bond catches and fights him underwater. Just as Largo tries to use a spear gun to shoot Bond, he is shot with a spear gun by Domino, taking revenge for Jack's death.\n\nBond retires from being a secret agent, settling in the Bahamas along with Domino. He is persuaded to come back, but vows to \"never again\" return to duty.\n\nAwards and Decorations[]\n\nOrder of St. Michael and St. George: Awarded by the British monarch for unknown reasons.\n\nDistinguished Service Order: Awarded for distinguished services during active operations against the enemy.\n\n1939-1945 Star: Awarded for 180 days of operational service afloat during WWII.\n\nAtlantic Star: Awarded for 180 days of operational service afloat during WWII's battle of the Atlantic.\n\nPacific Star: Awarded for service in the pacific campaign of WWII.\n\nDefence Medal: Awarded for non-operational service for a specified amount of days during WWII 1939-1945.\n\nWar Medal 1939-1945: Awarded for a minimum of 28 days of service during the second world war.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\n1962-67[]\n\nConnery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. A Scottish amateur bodybuilder, he had come to the attention of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s.[5] Connery was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit.[6] He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) – then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful and James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.[7]\n\nConnery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man.[8] James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks,\" and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man\", adding that Connery (muscular, 6'2\", and a Scot) was unrefined.[9] Fleming's girlfriend Blanche Blackwell told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No première. He was so impressed, he wrote Connery's heritage into the character. In his 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, Fleming wrote that Bond's father was Scottish and from Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.[9] These encounters made Connery the only Bond actor who had met Fleming in person.\n\nConnery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Robert Cotton wrote in one Connery biography that Lois Maxwell (the first Miss Moneypenny) noticed, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" Cotton wrote, \"Some cast members remarked that Connery was simply doing a Terence Young impression, but Young and Connery knew they were on the right track.\"[10] The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film.[11] In preparation for the role, Connery admits to having read only three of Ian Fleming's Bond novels; Thunderball, EON Productions' original choice for the first James Bond film, as well as Live and Let Die and From Russia with Love.[12] In 1965, he was approached by producer Charles Feldman to play Sir James Bond in Casino Royale. Connery turned down the role.\n\nAlthough Bond had made him a star, Connery grew tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying \"[I am] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit\"[13] and \"I have always hated that damned James Bond. I'd like to kill him\".[14] In addition to a growing weariness with the repetitive plots, lack of character development and the general public's demands on his privacy, an increasingly tense financial relationship had developed between Connery and the series producers.[15] Despite being contracted for one further film, in 1967 a frustrated Connery shocked the industry by announcing that he was hanging up his tuxedo and retiring from the role of 007.\n\nDiamonds Are Forever (1971)[]\n\nIn November 1969, prior to the release of the film adaptation of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Connery's successor, Australian former model George Lazenby, announced that he no longer wished to play the role of James Bond.[16] Producers contemplated replacing him with John Gavin (though Batman star Adam West was also considered),[17] as well as Michael Gambon, who rejected the offer telling Broccoli that he was \"in terrible shape.\"[18] United Artists' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object.\n\nWhen approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded the extraordinary fee of £1.25 million (£23 million in 2013 pounds) and to entice the actor to play Bond one more time United Artists offered to back two films of his choice.[19] After both sides agreed to the deal, Connery used the fee to establish the Scottish International Education Trust, where Scottish artists could apply for funding without having to leave their country to pursue their careers. Since John Gavin was no longer in the running for the role, his contract was paid in full by United Artists.\n\nNever Say Never Again (1983)[]\n\nIn 1983 Connery returned to the role of James Bond for Never Say Never Again, the second film adaptation of the novel Thunderball, The film was produced by Kevin McClory, who created the original Thunderball story with Ian Fleming and Jack Whittingham.\n\nMarking his return to the role 12 years after Diamonds Are Forever, Connery had been tenuously attached to the floundering project since 1978 (under the working title James Bond of the Secret Service). When producer Jack Schwartzman became involved, he asked Connery to play Bond: Connery agreed, asking (and getting) a fee of $3 million, ($7 million in 2013 dollars) a percentage of the profits, as well as casting and script approval.[20] Subsequent to Connery reprising the role, the script has several references to Bond's advancing years – playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming[20][21] – and academic Jeremy Black has pointed out that there are other aspects of age and disillusionment in the film, such as the Shrubland's porter referring to Bond's car (\"they don't make them like that any more\"), the new M having no use for the 00 section and Q with his reduced budgets.[22]\n\nThe film underwent one final change in title: after Connery had finished filming Diamonds Are Forever he had pledged that he would \"never\" play Bond again.[23] Connery's wife, Micheline, suggested the title Never Say Never Again, referring to her husband's vow[24] and the producers acknowledged her contribution by listing on the end credits \"Title \"Never Say Never Again\" by: Micheline Connery\".\n\nFrom Russia with Love (video game)[]\n\nIn 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled James Bond 007: From Russia with Love. It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented like the most recent Bond films.\n\nMost of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in Never Say Never Again.[25][26]\n\nGallery[]\n\nJames Bond (Sean Connery)/Gallery\n\nSee also[]\n\nJames Bond (Personality and Traits)\n\nDr. No\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThunderball\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nDiamonds are Forever\n\nNever Say Never Again\n\nFrom Russia with Love (video game)\n\nJames Bond (Literary)\n\nJames Bond (George Lazenby)\n\nJames Bond (Roger Moore)\n\nJames Bond (Timothy Dalton)\n\nJames Bond (Pierce Brosnan)\n\nJames Bond (Daniel Craig)\n\nJames Bond (Toby Stephens)\n\nJames Bond (Others)\n\n[]\n\nJames Bond (Sean Connery) on the Heroes Wiki."
