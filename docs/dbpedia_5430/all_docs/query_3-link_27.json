He is very much in the Daniel Day Lewis mould and we all know how successful he has been. These classic actors are very hard to come by these days and i am positive that if Dalton was handed a lead role in a major role his obvious acting skills would once again be portrayed to the world just as they were when he was bond",

        "text": "I've seen some of his other works, unfortunately most of these roles have been rather diminutive or just aren't really enough serious or demanding of him as an actor. I did however love him in Centennial as Oliver Seccombe, and IMO, he did the most powerful stuff out of them all and handled it with such voluminous sublimity, subtlety and intricacy.\n\nAny recommendations will be greatly appreciated!\n\nIf by \"Oscar performance\" we're talking about the sort of performance that would win an Oscar, then it's merely a matter of Dalton having never been given the right kind of role. After his association with Bond and other low-prestige franchises, it's unlikely that such a role will be \"wasted\" on him.\n\nWell, \"his association with Bond\" did not make anything worse. Just look at all the crap he did before Bond.\n\nThe problem with \"Oscar performances\" these days is: it does not matter whether you really deliver great work. The studio which releases your film has to decide whether it will be worth putting money into the Oscar campaign. If so, you will have to do thousands of meet-and-greets with Academy members, schmooze them shamelessly in order to get the nomination. After that you have to do that kind of work even harder, competing now with the other candidates (and the studios behind them who will stop at nothing to ruin your chances).\n\nI donÂ´t think Dalton wants to do that kind of work anymore (and I congratulate him for this).\n\nMaybe, in one or two decades, Dalton will do a supporting role in a small independent film and get a \"oh, S***, everybodyÂ´s loving him in this and we have overlooked him constantly so we will throw him a bone here\"-nomination.\n\nBut apart from that, no.\n\nI don't think he gives a crap. He's an actor, not a movie star, and he's happier on the stage. The film roles he takes supports that habit, and he does choose interesting work. Playing Rassilon on Doctor Who certainly did him no harm and it sure raised the profile of that episode.\n\nDalton's a very private person - even more so than Craig or Connery, and probably wouldn't even care to be commiserated for not having been nominated for an Oscar. How many British stage awards has he received? Those are probably what counts most with him.\n\nThe problem with \"Oscar performances\" these days is: it does not matter whether you really deliver great work.

Totally agree\n\nI don't think he gives a crap. He's an actor, not a movie star, and he's happier on the stage. The film roles he takes supports that habit, and he does choose interesting work. Playing Rassilon on Doctor Who certainly did him no harm and it sure raised the profile of that episode.\n\nDalton's a very private person - even more so than Craig or Connery, and probably wouldn't even care to be commiserated for not having been nominated for an Oscar. How many British stage awards has he received? Those are probably what counts most with him.\n\nSame here, seems to be Dalton's creed. And rightfully so.\n\nTo win an Oscar, all an actor needs is basic competence, a \"serious\" reputation, and the right kind of role. But you never know. Perhaps someone at this very minute is writing a screenplay about a manic-depressive coal miner whose beautiful singing voice helped Britain defeat Hitler. Call it Tongues of Fire.\n\nAnd that writer should be Quentin Tarantino. He's the only writer/director that comes to my mind who could get Dalton a movie-comeback.\n\nTarantino loves to bring back old stars in great supporting roles.\n\nTimothy Dalton seems like a good guy...so I hate to say this, but......\n\nHis acting is often seems too stiff to me. General audiences never did embrace him as Bond. Of course, he wasnt blessed with the best material either as far as his Bond days go. LTK looks cheap with an uninspired drug and revenge plot...yawn.\n\nLiving Daylights better but still looks cheap; hercules sequences good; Whitaker embarrassing; the lying russian general fun and entertaining.\n\nStill I like Dalton and would like to see him have a chance....a good role and a chance to be redeemed and recognized.\n\nJust echoing you guys really - Dalton is a brilliant actor, who owns every role he plays with 100% passion as either the hero or villain, but due to his private life away from the paparazzi/media and his roles not being in huge major releases, he certainly gains critical and fan success but wouldn't be seen as Academy Award fodder.\n\nAs you say, theatrical awards would probably suit him more but also as you say, I don't think the awards change his style of actor or person.\n\nIs there an Oscar performance in Dalton? Absolutely! With his brooding determination, I say Dalton will make a very fine Oscar the Grouch. Direct me to the nearest petition demanding the feature film live-action version of Sesame Street and sign me up.\n\nNot the kind of Oscar performance you meant? Sorry, strike what I said."
