        "text": "As you probably know by now, books are and always have been a really important part of my life. My second tattoo ever was a book related one and now, a few years later, I collected many pieces in honor of my favourite works. The magic of books being that you are free to interpret and imagine the places and characters as it pleases you, I feel like there is a much bigger freedom when it comes to have a tattoo done. Maybe no one will agree with my perception of a particular event or character, but if it’s how I had it in mind the whole time I was reading, then nothing can change it, not even a movie.\n\nIt’s a fantastic feeling to talk to an artist, explaining what you want and how you want it, and then see the final result on your skin. More than once I’ve been surprised by how accurate the design actually was, making me say « Yes, that’s exactly how I had it in mind the whole time ».\n\nBesides pictures, I will also state the name of the artist, when I got the tattoo done, how long it took and how painful it was. I think that some of you might be interested to know how much I had to suffer to show my love for those stories on my body. Funnily enough, I am currently completely into another saga so this article probably won’t stay exhaustive for a long time, but here are all the tattoos I got because I loved a book that much.\n\nEarth’s Children\n\nAs I wrote an entire article about my trip to France to see the painted cave, the fact that I got some Earth’s Children related tattoos shouldn’t be a surprise. I first heard of the story when I was in secondary school but somehow only dived into it when I arrived in Berlin. The books are really dense and contain tons of informations and characters, but I couldn’t stop reading. To be totally honest, I didn’t enjoy the 6th part as much as the rest, but I loved the first volumes so much that it doesn’t really matter.\n\nWhen I first read the saga, I kind of fell in love with the character of Jondalar, described as particularly handsome and skillful. And indeed, amongst other talents, Jondalar is an accomplished flint knapper.\n\nI got this tattoo really spontaneously because someone canceled their appointment the day before and I decided to take the open slot. In my opinion, this simple flint stone represents Jondalar better than any portrait would.\n\nIn fact, as great as Jondalar is, he would be nothing without the heroine of the story, the wonderful Ayla. To me, the magic of her character is that, as extraordinary, talented and out of this world as she is, I could still relate to her in many ways. Some elements that I really wanted to be included in the design were her little amulet bag that she always wear around her neck and her firestone.\n\nI fell in love with this version of Ayla as soon as I saw the design, the night before the appointment. It was her. Exactly as I had her in mind. I couldn’t be happier with this tattoo.\n\nHis Dark Material\n\nLike many others, I read and loved the book both as a child and as an adult. Lyra, Will and Pantalaimon are all characters really dear to me. In fact, it’s one of the first book that broke my heart to the point of sobbing. I had the idea of getting a His Dark Materials tattoo in mind for a long time but was only sure of two things : I wanted it big, and I wanted it in colors.\n\nThe first frame represents Lyra and Will together, Lyra holding Pan in her arms. I wanted them to be reunited and forever with each other (yes, my heart is still broken). At first I kind of wanted to depict them as adults, but this idea didn’t last long. On the other leg you can see my favourite character, the armoured bear Iorek Byrnison. Not only is he a badass and extremely interesting character, but I also discovered that his home, Svalbard, the kingdom of the polar bears, exists in real life. I wouldn’t have heard about it if it wasn’t for His Dark Materials, and since I know it’s real I can’t wait to afford a trip there.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nI grew up with Harry, reading the books as they were released, most of them in one go. I also re-read the whole serie so many time that I stopped counting. This story is just a part of who I am and when I closed the 7th book for the first time I fell like a really important chapter of my life just ended. I knew I would end up with a Harry Potter tattoo, but it took me some time to decide what.\n\nRon is my favourite character. When I finally realised that a magic wand would be a nice and original idea, it went without saying that it should be Ron’s. It’s a small tattoo, hidden on the inside of my arm, but I really love it for what it represents.\n\nNow, I have another idea in relation to the wizarding world that I hope to realise later this year.\n\nLord Of The Rings\n\nAmong all the stories that made me the person I am today, The Lord of the Rings is really high on the list. I read the books when I was 12 years old. My stepdad owned a really luxurious edition of the trilogy with illustrations of Alan Lee inside, weighting at least 2kg. I was carrying it everywhere, all the time, until I finished it, and I’ve read it again a few times since then. By the way, be sure that I will write about Lord of the Rings on this blog again as it’s the reason I traveled to New Zealand in 2013, after more than 10 years of waiting.\n\nThe Door of Durin is one of my favourite artwork in the whole serie. I mostly love the aesthetic side of this design, because even if someone doesn’t know about The Lord of the Rings (how ?), it can also just be seen as a beautiful ornemental piece. In fact, the same goes for the next tattoo of this list.\n\nThe White Tree of Gondor, a simple but yet powerful symbol.\n\nAnd, last but not least, the one that might be my favourite. In fact, tattoos are also supposed to be fun, aren’t they ? And what it more fun than to undress the most perfect man of all Middle Earth ? Yes, it is indeed Aragorn’s crotch. Even his sword Andúril is represented. And I couldn’t have been prouder when the artist posted the picture on Instagram and that some people actually recognised who it was !\n\nNote that I also have the One Ring inscription on my arm, but as I plan to cover it up to finish my sleeve I won’t show it here. Maybe I will have it done somewhere else on my body in the future, and it’s not like you can’t find thousands of exactly similar tattoos on the internet.\n\nTales Of The Otori\n\nTo finish this little tattoo tour, let’s talk about Tales of the Otori. I read the original trilogy when I was in secondary school and found out years later that the author wrote a prequel and a sequel. I dived into the story again and appreciated it even more as an adult. It might be the less known saga in my list but it doesn’t make it any less good. Taking place in an imaginary world based on feodal Japan, the book follows the life of Takeo, young man adopted by Lord Shigeru of the Otori Clan and raised as a warrior. Saying more would be considered as a spoiler, but I strongly recommend you to read this fantastic serie.\n\nTalking about the tattoo, I wanted something to do with my favourite character, Shigeru. The heron being the emblem of the Otori Clan, it’s combined with cherry blossoms to bring out the universe the story is set in. On top of that, the heron is a bird I find absolutely beautiful and always loved to observe in its natural habitat.\n\nI am already impatient to extend this list as ideas keep coming to my mind. What about you ? Do you have any tattoos linked to something dear to your heart ?\n\nI am a bookworm and always have been. Give me a good book and I will dive into it, relate to the characters, feel a wild range of emotions as the story goes by, and more often than I want to admit it, get striked by post book depression once it’s over : meaning I can’t start a new book for a while as I am still too emotionally attached to the characters and feel like I just lost friends. Trust me, it hurts.\n\nWhen I moved to Berlin I experienced the loneliest times of my whole life. I was all by myself in a city I didn’t know, without a job or friends, and without internet at home for a whole month. Not having anything else to do with my (whole lot of) free time, I read. And particularly put my heart and soul into this series of books written by Jean M. Auel called Earth’s Children. Needless to say, this serie changed my life ; I was living, breathing, eating, sleeping Earth’s Children. So much that I got a tattoo related to the story and convinced my mom to read it as well.\n\nFor those of you that aren’t familiar with it, the six extremely well documented novels tell the story of an orphaned Cro-Magnon girl called Ayla adopted and raised by a Neandertal tribe before going on a journey to find people of her own kind, meeting her significant other along the way in the person of Jondalar. The series is set in Europe with a focus on what is now known as the Vézère Valley, France, in the 5th and 6th books.\n\nSee what I did here ?\n\nOn this last week end of November 2017 I took my morning flight to Toulouse, France. As the Vézère Valley is located around 200 kilometers north from there I obviously had to rent a car, which was a first for me ! It is also the most convenient way to explore the area as it’s not very well served by public transportation. The Périgord region, as lovely as it is, doesn’t get much attention nor tourists during winter months ; and that’s the exact reason why I went at that time of the year !\n\nThe Caves\n\nAround the little village of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac (good luck pronuncing this name if you aren’t a french speaker !) are located a significant amount of important archaeological sites. I absolutely wanted to visit the painted cave of Font-de-Gaume, the one called Les Combarelles, which holds over 600 engraving of animals and symbols, and the shelter of Laugerie Haute.\n\nIt can be really tricky to visit the caves I was interested in and I had to plan ahead. Because of preservation issues, the number of visitors admitted in the cave each day is very limited : 42 people for Les Combarelles and 78 people for Font-de-Gaume. I managed to get my hand on a reservation ticket by sending them an email but it seems like I’ve been really lucky as they usually don’t do it. All tickets for the day are sold in the morning at 9:30pm and the only way to get one is to queue. When I showed up at 9:15pm on this late November sunday morning, the thermometer showed -1°C and still over 20 people were waiting to buy a ticket. You can only imagine how much of a fight it might be during peak travel times ! All tour are guided only and no pictures nor touching of any kind are allowed. And while we managed to stay over 1h30 in Les Combarelles, the time is limited to 35 minutes in Font-de-Gaume as the polychrome paintings are way more damageable than engravings.\n\nMy first visit was then the Les Combarelles cave, knows in the books as The Women’s Place. We were a little group of only 6 people, which made the visit really intimate and exceptional. Even now I can’t really find the words to talk about it. It is indeed really moving to see engravings that are around 13’000 years old. The way they used the relief of the cave walls to give life to their creation is incredible. A unique experience that I had the privilege to live and will never forget.\n\nDuring my lunch break I paid a visit to the shelter of Laugerie Haute, although it was closed on that day. A very important location in the books as it is no less than the 9th Cave of the Zelandonii, Ayla and Jondalar’s home. This site not being as popular as the painted caves, it’s only possible to visit it on certain days of the week. But it didn’t bother me as I only wanted to feel the vibe. I spent so many hours « with » Ayla and Jondalar when I had nothing else in Berlin that seeing the place that inspired their home was something really important to me. The fog welcomed me there which gave it a dramatic dimension and I swear my heart skipped a beat as I looked throught the fence.\n\nBut the icing of the cake of my stay in the Vézère Valley was without a doubt the visit of Font-de-Gaume. Called The Deep of Foutain Rocks in the book, it is the most sacred site for the Zelandonii. I understood why as soon as I entered. I was shaking walking along the narrow tunnel and got tears in my eyes when our guide enlightened the first paintings. It definitely took my breath away and was really hard for me to leave the cave.\n\nDomme\n\nThe caves visits having all been planned on sunday, I had the whole saturday for myself. I followed the hotel’s owner advices and explored a bit the nearby area. One of my favourite view that day was the one I got in the small (and deserted) village of Domme.\n\nI mean, look at that ! Beautiful, isn’t it ?\n\nThis little village had some seriously good vibes. With its lovely houses and narrow cobbled streets it really felt like holidays to me. Even though everything was closed (shall I remind you it’s winter time ?) and I only met like 3 people. No, wait. The latest is actually a good thing.\n\nThe Gardens of Marqueyssac\n\nI had to visit those gardens, not only because of the gardens themselves, but mainly because of the (almost) complete Allosaurus’ skeleton the owner bought last year to celebrate the 20 years anniversary of the place. I mean, how cool is it to be able to buy a dinosaur skeleton ?\n\nThe over an hour long walk around the garden and its 6 kilometers of paths was very relaxing. I enjoyed being alone on most of the way and again, the view ! Because the garden is located on an overhang you have a breathtaking view on the valley, and free peacocks even come and walk around with you.\n\nOther anecdotes about my trip are, including, but not limited to : my first time ever in a restaurant alone (fellow introverts here will know it’s actually a big deal), a giant bruise on my leg when I miserably fell in the forest trying to climb on a platform made of wood, the gigantic amount of french saucisson I brought back in my luggage, all the charming people who chatted with me and the boiling bath I took at 6 in the morning on the last day after the heating system of the hotel broke down during the night to avoid freezing to death.\n\nIt was my first trip alone since the big New Zealand Adventure in 2013 and I enjoyed it more than I even imagined I would ! The visits to the caves and the great signifiance it has for me is something I actually didn’t want to share with anyone. I mean, who could possibly understand a girl who fly to another country to see painted caves just because she loved a book that takes place in the area ?\n\nStill, I am sure many of you can relate. Not necessary to the caves, but we all have our own reasons to travel and none of them are dumb.\n\nNever stop travelling.\n\n6 years ago, in October 2011, I attended a gig that, as cheesy as it can sound, changed my life. 50 minutes of pure delight, after what I went home in a daze and thought about it for a whole week before deciding that it wasn’t enought, that I wanted more. At that point I only had one regular day off during the week ; monday. So I opened this band’s website, checked the tour dates and selected the only sunday gig available, a month later. In Porto, Portugal.\n\nThis is the first time I went abroad for a concert. At that time, the destination didn’t matter, I knew only one thing : I was off every monday. So my only possibility was a sunday evening concert. That happened to be in Portugal, a country I never visited before, and never planned to visit either. I convinced my bestfriend to join me and today, 6 years later, I have been to 13 different European countries, a few of them exclusively to attend gigs, most of the time by myself. I have thousands of stories to tell, but let me start with those 5 (hopefully) entertaining anecdotes about my so called YOLO trips around Europe to follow bands.\n\nThat time I ended up in the hospital during a gig so I made another try a month later in another german city\n\nI was really excited about this concert in the small SO36 in Berlin, not only because the band I was going to see has an incredible energy on stage, but also because I was supposed to meet another fellow concert goer I has been chatting with for a few months and watch the concert together. Unfortunately he arrived too late to join me on the front row, which, in the end, saved me from a very embarrassing moment : being smashed against the rail by a crowdsurfer and ending up in the hospital with a fractured rib. Long story short, I had to be evacuated after only 45 minutes of concert, and to add insult to injury, right before my favourite song. Boy, how much I cried, lying on the floor ! Of pain, fear (I honestly thought I was going to die) and sadness, too ! Needless to say, it totally ruined my evening.\n\nSo instead of weeping about it, I arranged a day off work some weeks later and last minute booked a seat on a bus direction Hamburg. There I finally enjoyed my long awaited concert (and favourite song !) in its whole, and without accident this time, before rushing out of the venue and hopping my bus back home !\n\nSkipping school to attend the final show of a tour in the Netherlands\n\nMy mom probably still is disappointed by my behaviour, but in my defence I was already in Oberhausen when I got the opportunity to join the date in Tilburg which was less than a two hours drive away. Plus, it was the last show of the tour, and we all know that it means a lot of fun and stage invasions that I wasn’t ready to miss ! Okay, maybe I am only coming up with excuses here, but let’s get a bit personal and let me explain my situation back then : I had just started a new school that I hated in a city I equally hated. At that point anything was good to help me forget about this terrible situation I put myself in and couldn’t seem to find a way out of.\n\nBack to the story, I then only postponed my return to reality a little bit more to avoid breaking down. After a wild night of partying in Oberhausen I joined the travel party and arrived hungover and sick in Tilburg, where I still had a fantastic time with everyone before heading home by train.\n\nFun fact : I burned out and quit school a week later and moved back to my home city straight away and never looked back. Don’t force yourself, it’s not worth it.\n\nThe day I convinced my dad to drive 500 km to go to a lost city in Germany for a festival\n\nLong before I got my driving license and despite being a cheap deals finder expert, I couldn’t find a way to reach the german city of Geiselwind in time for the hour long festival set of the band I wanted to see.\n\nJokingly, I asked my dad if he would be in for a little car adventure and a good metal concert, and to my own surprise, he said yes ! We made the return trip in a day as I had another plan for the next day and I am sure my dad had as much fun as I did, considering the fact he now goes to more metal concerts than I do !\n\nBooking super expensive flights to Poland out of despair\n\nBeing good at finding the cheapest way to reach a destination didn’t help me on that one. Maybe the fact that my friend and I decided to make it to Warsaw four days before show time can explain it. After seriously considering the car option (1400 kilometers, that’s how desperate we were), we finally decided to make our bank accounts cringe and booked a flight with a 5 hours stopover in Amsterdam. And before you even ask, missing the gig wasn’t an option.\n\nIt was our first time in the city and we decided to make the most of those 5 hours. By that, I mean exactly what you think I mean. This didn’t end up too good for me, as I had an anxiety attack in the toilets of a fast food and realised when I was in the plane that I still had the leftovers of what we bought in my wallet. It was a funny experience nevertheless and maybe even helped me to whistand the fact that the toilets in our polish hostel didn’t have doors. When the concert started, I might have still been high. True story.\n\nI wouldn’t be a responsible adult recommending doing this, but I still have to say that it was my funniest and most fucked up concert adventure to date and that I would do it all again in a heartbeat if I could !\n\nQueuing 12 hours in Paris for a filmed concert and not even ending in the DVD\n\nOkay, this might not exactly be what happened. I didn’t go to Paris only because the show was being filmed for a future DVD. In fact, I learned about it when I already was queuing in front of the venue. But I still waited in line for 12 hours, two days in a row ! The first evening I missed the front row because of circumstances totally out of my hands (read, the asshole security guy at my gate) but I perfectly made it the second night, and enjoyed a breathtaking show ! Having seen the filming crew focusing a lot on the front row and, no bragging there, me, I then started to fantasize about ending up in the DVD, the ultimate fan goal, a way to achieve posterity !\n\nIt took the band 5 (!) years to release this DVD, but they didn’t do things by half : screenings of the film in selected cinemas all over the world ! I went to the projection full of hopes and dreams, and more than ready to experience one of the best concert of my entire life again ! And here is what happened : They released a film. Not a live concert. A film. Which is brilliant. But then you don’t happen to see the audience. At all. So here was the story of how I didn’t achieve posterity.\n\nThe first time I took a 2 hours long train trip to attend a gig in a city I didn’t know I felt like an adventuress, a badass. Years later I travelled by train across half of Europe to follow a tour of my favourite band by myself and had the time of my life. I don’t count the kilometers I travelled for gigs anymore (maybe I do, actually, but you don’t want to know).\n\nLast week end I flew to Finland to attend another concert after a year of asking myself if it actually still was my cup of tea. The answer is : yes, it think it is ! I am ready and willing to travel more, to sleep less and to enjoy those adventures again.\n\nBe sure that I’ll write soon about my concerts stories again. I have so many to tell ! To be continued !\n\nA lot of people tend to think that you need to travel far, far away in order to see wonders. Let’s keep it real, so do I ! And it drives me nuts !\n\nHaving a full time job with an average paycheck, I, unfortunately, can’t afford to fly right away to the country I last added to my bucket list. Which, really often, leads to extreme frustration.\n\nI have been living in Berlin for a year and a half. The least you can say is that my wanderlust reaches new heights. I am craving travelling and discovering new, beautiful, and most of all, wild places ! Enough of those grey buildings, I need more nature in my life, to the point that I can barely stand it ! So, what should I do ?\n\nI decided to give myself a little challenge ; to find lovely places in a 1 kilometer radius from my place. Anything that could call something to my mind. Such a short distance, yet the itinerary I calculated to be able to see as many little corners as possible gave me a total of 28 kilometers of streets to cycle on. Right after work on that sunday morning I took advantage of the good weather and got on my bike.\n\nMore than 3 hours later I was back at home and, to my own surprise, more than once the places I cycled by left me speechless ! From busy KuDamm to empty little streets, here are 10 pictures I wanted to share with you :\n\nLook at this lovely house covered by plants !\n\nThe Memorial Church (Gedächtniskirche) with its destroyed steeple. I pass by really often but never thought it would be included in my 1 km radius. If this isn’t one of the most well known landmarks in Berlin !\n\nThe Theatre of the West (Theater Des Westens) is such an amazing building !\n\nOne of my favourite place around where I live, and probably the only one I was sure would end up in my list without even leaving my flat. I love the vibe and the giant library right under the elevated railroad.\n\nPreussenpark and its Thai Park market. A huge Thai community gathers here and sells food to visitors. The athmosphere is friendly, there is music… And did I mention delicious food ? Plus, it’s cheap.\n\nThe Saint Louis’ Church (Ludwigskirche) and its lovely little garden. It was crowded on that sunny day.\n\nI might have a new favourite building in Berlin ! The garden was adorable, with a small pond full of fishes and a lot of trees, though a lot were unfortunately damaged by the storm earlier this week.\n\nI spotted this little fella on my way to Thai Park.\n\nI stopped in awe in front of this parish and its golden bricks. It’s literally around the corner and I never saw it before. Crazy.\n\nSuch a cute corner on a big paved square ! I bet it’s full of life in the summer.\n\nThose were my favourite, but it was kind of hard to limit my selection to 10 pictures. Some places I couldn’t photograph, as nothing was particularly aesthetically pleasing, but the vibe in some of those empty, cobbled, little streets was really unique and impossible to describe.\n\nOf course, I won’t find a fantastic wildlife, or glacier lakes, or even moutains in Berlin. Obviously, this little stroll around my neighborood absolutely didn’t fulfill my desire to see breathtaking, deserted landscapes.\n\nBut it inspired me.\n\nIt inspired me to see the beauty in the smallest of things. To enjoy the moment. To not freak out if I can’t travel for the next 3 months. Heck, I visited Berlin a few times as a tourist before I moved there, and now that I call it my home, it shouldn’t be exciting anymore ?\n\nSoon I will fly away again, discover new places, new cultures. And I can’t wait for all these new experiences to happen ! But until then (and especially as I don’t really have another option, let’s be honest) I will work on appreciating more what is around me instead of crying scrolling through Instagram. Maybe then I will enjoy my trips abroad even more ! It remains to be seen !\n\nBut, most important, if I can do it, so can you ! So get on your bike and explore around ! I created the hashtag #1KmAroundHomeChallenge on Instagram, so if you do, please share it !"
