Just this past weekend, we have seen extensive damage and serious attempts to set fire to the toilets which are not only a huge disappointment but a danger to our community.\n\nâThe situation cannot continue any longer and the continued provision of the toilets is now under serious threat. We have reached out to the community for help, contacted the Police and community safety partnership and have had ad hoc visits from contractors and security companies but we have been unable to stop this mindless vandalism.â\n\nShare information about vandals\n\nCllr Jordan went on to say,\n\nâI am asking the community and businesses of Ryde, in Western Gardens, to please let us have any information they might have that could lead us to discovering who the people responsible for the damage and vandalism are. My contact details are [email protected] and happy to receive any information, in complete confidence if required.\n\nâIf we cannot put a stop to this ongoing vandalism, it is with a very heavy heart and disappointment that we may have to close the toilets and remove them permanently.\n\nâI hope we can avoid that, but we must be under no illusion that the current damage to the toilets cannot continue and that the possible outcome will be closure and removal.â\n\nAn internal meeting is planned next week with relevant stakeholders from Isle of Wight council to discuss the options for the toilets and to consider what could be decided on their future.\n\nNews shared by Cllr Jordan in his own words.
