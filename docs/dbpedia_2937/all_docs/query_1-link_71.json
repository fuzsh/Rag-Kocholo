        "meta_description": "Following it&#39;s temporary COVID-19 lockdown closure, the Southport Bijou Cinema is back! The Southport Bijou Cinema is a volunteer-run and not-for-profit Community Interest Company, which shows a wide range of movies, including classics old and new, independent films not shown in the multiplexes, and dynamic world cinema, amongst others. The Bijou Cinema features a raked auditorium, which features a high-end projector, 5.1 surround speakers and moving curtains in front of the screen to present an immersive yet traditional cinematic experience. Film screenings are either at&nbsp;14:30 to 19:30&nbsp;and show most days, but schedules do change so make sure to check the Southport Bijou Cinema website, or their Facebook or Twitter, to ensure you don&rsquo;t miss anything. All tickets for their films can be purchased either through their website, on Ticket Source with a 5% Booking Fee, or on site at the Bijou&rsquo;s Box Office. The caf&eacute;/bar is adjacent to the auditorium itself, and features a chic-style Fracino Retro Coffee Machine for a wide range of hot drinks. The bar is also licensed, and sells a range of wines, spirits, bottled lagers, and locally brewed bottled ale from both Southport Brewery and Lancaster Brewery, as well as a wide variety of snacks. All drinks and snacks purchased here can be taken inside the auditorium. All Cash, Card and American Express are also welcomed, as are well behaved dogs! Also featured in the caf&eacute;/bar is a large chalkboard, for visitors to write film and Arts Events recommendations for the future! The caf&eacute;/bar also features accessible unisex toilets on the ground floor. For accessible assistance into the building itself, there is a Door Bell to be pressed in order for a member of staff to come and help. Upstairs at the Southport Bijou Cinema is the Lounge, an open space for events and parties with a multi-lighting system, comfortable sofas and a Serving Station for drinks. Next door to the Lounge are the Male and Female toilets, and also the Media Room, which is available for talks, films, or just to chill out in. However, following the temporary COVID-19 pandemic closure, the entirety of Upstairs at the Bijou is closed until further notice. Also following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Southport Bijou Cinema has changed how it runs, and is not currently available to hire for use in all the ways it was. The 75-seat auditorium has been reduced to adhere to 1M Social Distancing rule, and as such can fit 20 customers in for a screening at one time. To avoid disappointment, book your tickets online for the advertised screenings.&nbsp;One accessible toilet will be open, and is cleaned carefully after each screening. A thorough Social Distancing and cleaning policy is in place, so customers can be rest assured that the Southport Bijou Cinema is doing all it can to be safe for re-opening to customers.&nbsp;",
