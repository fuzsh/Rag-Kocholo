According to HRC staffer Larry Brinkin, the panel will also welcome seven new members, including 14- year-old Gina De Vries, the youngest member in the commission’s history. De Vries is an out lesbian at a local Catholic high school. Also introduced will be new members Judith Steven¬ son, Christina Olague, Simone Antigone, Valerie Tobin, Manuel Da- calanio, and Sam Rodriguez. Also on the agenda will be the final report of last fall’s Queer Youth hearings - which includes essays, transcripts of testimony, and recommendations for action. The report indudes the recom¬ mendations for rejecting the Gender Identity Disorder for youth, because of the abuse of the psychiatric diagnosis as a coercive measure allowing the forced incarceration and psychiatric treatment of 1/b/g/t or questioning youth who are labeled with the disorder. Well-known transgender activist and Conard House case manager Christine Tayleur, and others who support the use of the diagnosis, will speak to the issue.

But, they say, where the money comes from is as important as where it is going, so the Community Center Project’s (CCP) board of directors wants everyone in the queer community to become involved and become early members. For a modest $35, individuals can join the CCP, board member Scott Shafer said. The rate for families is $50, while there’s a $15 rate for individuals with special needs. By keeping the price of member¬ ships down, the board hopes the center will truly be a community effort and represent everyone. All donations are tax-deductible as al¬ lowed by law. The CCP will launch its membership drive next Wednesday, March 19 at City Hall, with a special preview of nearly 50 drawings that architectural firms have submitted to the center’s design com¬ petition. The preview is for members only, but the drawings will re¬ main on display at City Hall for an additional two weeks, where the public can view them and provide written feedback. Top-notch Shafer and CCP board member Mark Leno sat down for an in¬ terview with the Bay Area Reporter Friday, March 7 and outlined plans for the membership drive, the capital campaign, and what the board envisions for San Francisco’s gay community center. The $7.3 million project is expected to open in 1999. The CCP must raise $2.5 million from individuals, foundations, and corpora¬ tions. The rest of the money will come from the various public sources. The city of San Francisco has already contributed $1.1 mil¬ lion, used to purchase property at 1800 Market Street. Leno explained that the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency has committed $1.5 million to the project. The city contributed another page 20 ► Future site of SF's gay community center at 1800 Market Street SF support grows for Gordon in San lllateo race by Marv. Shaw R ich Gordon, the openly gay candi¬ date for the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors in the forth¬ coming election, will stress mutual benefit as the main appeal of his candidacy at a San Francisco rally this Tuesday evening, March 18, from 6 to 9 p.m. Gordon’s entry into the Peninsula race has attracted the attention and support of prominent gay politicos in San Francisco and beyond, as shown by the event’s sponsor list: Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) plus three S.F. supervisors - Tom Ammiano, Susan Leal, and Leslie Katz. The Victory Fund, a national gay organization that carefully screens applicants for the best qualifications, has chosen to support him. Local organizations such as the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club, the Bay Area Non-Partisan Alliance, and BAYMEC (Bay Area Municipal Elections Committee) have also come out in Gordon’s favor. Twenty-three co-hosts are aboard for Tuesday’s event, including former HUD as¬ sistant secretary Roberta Achtenberg, influ¬ ential gay political activist James Hormel, S.F. School Board member Juanita Owens, and BART board member Tom Radulovich. In this and numerous other presentations until the April 8 election, Gordon will em¬ phasize the advantage of the two neighbor¬ ing counties mutually promoting human rights for their gay residents, especially in the workplace. He also likes to point out other examples of mutual benefit, such as the ne¬ cessity for San Mateo and San Francisco Counties to work together for the welfare of the San Francisco International Airport. Al¬ though the city of San Francisco operates the airport, it is located in San Mateo County and is the county’s largest employer. page 11 ► Rich Gordon Jane Philomen Cleland 2 BAY AREA REPORTER 13 March 1997 ■—l'j'. i 490 Post St., Suite #520 Every smile %$IMns with a 986-4534 Union Square, San Francisco IT REALLY DOES LOOK DETTER WITH THE HAIR GONE The great pretender: Chrissie Hynde, shown here at last summer's March for the Animals in D.C., is alarmed by \"15 years of failed and costly animal experiments.\" Gay Owned & Operated 40 AGENTS PROUD 555 Castro 861-5200 1000 BRANNAN STREET ■ SAN FRANCISCO ■ OPEN DAILY 10-6, SUNDAYS 12-5 • PARKING IN REAR - 1-800-404 0MID Permanent Hair Removal and Reshaping JOHN FRIZZELL Registered Electrologist 626-2729 COMPliIMENTABY CONSULTATION FOB MEN AND WOMEN ed animal testing. The group met Hynde during last June’s “March For Animals,” sponsored by People for the Ethi¬ cal Treatment of Animals (PETA). “ACT UP/San Francisco refus¬ es money from drug companies, so I hope this helps. Please con¬ tinue to keep those who profit from AIDS from controlling the research agenda. Fifteen years of failed and costly animal experi¬ ments should alarm everyone,” said Hynde in a letter accompany¬ ing the check. “Our campaign is against AIDS profiteers who kill animals in useless and meaningless stud¬ ies. We will use this money to pro¬ mote the truth that there is no an¬ imal equivalent to the human im¬ mune system and therefore no more money need be wasted on vivisection,” said Medea Lopez of ACT UP/SF in a statement. In a press release regarding Hynde’s donation, the activist group took a jab at AIDS activist Jeff Getty, the recipient of a ba¬ boon marrow transplant that proved unsuccessful, and de¬ nounced the experimental med¬ ical procedure as a “misleading and cruel” animal test. Getty called Hynde’s gift “dis¬ gusting” and said that Hynde “was clueless” about ACT UP/San Francisco.

For an appointment call 415.388.1889 Kurt Wagner Certified Hypnotherapist Chrissie Hynde gives ACT UP/SF $5K “Wow,” said San Francisco AIDS Foundation spokesman Timothy Rodrigues, when told of the donation. “I hope they put the funds to good use in bringing the epidemic to an end.” ACT UP/San Francisco was widely criticized for a November 1996 incident, in which SFAF client and ACT UP/San Francisco member Ronnie Burk dumped many pounds of urine-soaked cat litter on SFAF Executive Director Pat Christen. The foundation later obtained restraining orders prohibiting several of the group’s activists from approaching Christen or other AIDS Foundation staff, or entering the Foundation’s offices at 10 United Nations Plaza in the Tenderloin. Rodrigues told the Bay Area Reporter that although SFAF did not have a formal written state¬ ment about the use of animals in HIV/AIDS research experimenta¬ tion, it did have a position. “In situations where is it nec¬ essary to develop treatments to save the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation understands the need to use research methods that may include the use of ani¬ mal subjects,” Rodrigues said. Project Inform Program Ser¬ vices Director Ben Collins last year organized a meeting of lesbian and gay community leaders, AIDS service group officials, activists, law enforcement, public health of¬ ficials and others - including peo¬ ple who have allegedly been vic¬ timized by members of ACT UP/San Francisco - to address the group’s escalating aggression. He declined to comment on Hynde’s gift. “I wouldn’t want to touch that one with a ten-foot pole. I don’t have anything to say about it,” said Collins. Collins did provide the Bay Area Reporter with a five-para¬ graph position statement on the use of laboratory animals in HIV/AIDS research and treat¬ ment. “Certainly the members of the HIV/AIDS community support the compassionate treatment of animals. We also demand that human care of animals be used in all research, including full en¬ forcement of applicable federal, state and local laws. However, one fact is undeniable; the most swift and certain route for HIV/AIDS is intensive research - including the use of laboratory animals - and from that route we will not waver,” the statement declared. ▼ by Dennis Conkin L ongtime animal rights ac¬ tivist and Pretenders lead singer Chrissie Hynde has donated $5,000 in royalties from the hit single “I’ll Stand By You” to ACT UP/San Francisco, prompt¬ ing a mixed reaction from critics of the controversial activist group. The group announced March 3 that it had received the check from the London-based vocalist. The AIDS activist chapter has been under fire by Bay Area AIDS ser¬ vice organizations and other AIDS activists over its confrontational and aggressive tactics, including the disruption of public meetings. The activist group has stated its opposition to animal testing, and is critical of groups and service providers that have accepted con¬ tributions from pharmaceutical companies or have public policies supporting AIDS drug testing. ACT UP/San Francisco mem¬ bers disrupted a forum on animal testing at last year’s International AIDS Conference, forcing its can¬ cellation during a presentation by a leading researcher.

REAL ESTATE HERTH 13 March 1997 BAY AREA REPORTER 3 300 show up for ACT UP birthday party by Liz Highleyman jj CT UP-the AIDS Coalition x * to Unleash Power - celebrat- Jrll ed its tenth anniversary Monday night with a spaghetti dinner at Most Holy Redeemer Church. The event drew about 300 participants and provided a wel¬ come opportunity for reunions among many long-time activists. Among those in attendance were Department of Public Health director Dr. Mitch Katz, Marj Plumb of the Gay and Les¬ bian Medical Association, and Eileen Hansen of the Women’s AIDS Network. ACT UP has come a long way since the days when the group was regarded as radical fringe outsiders who had to shout to be heard; now when ACT UP speaks, people in power listen - although they still do not always do what the group demands. At the event, the Sisters of Per¬ petual Indulgence offered a bless¬ ing to ACT UP/Golden Gate ac¬ tivists who will travel to New York City March 24 to take part in a reprise and commemoration of ACT UP’s first action a decade ago, a civil disobedience demon¬ stration on Wall Street. The evening’s event was a fundraiser to help defray those travel costs, and to help with the expenses of main¬ taining ACT UP/Golden Gate. Naming names ACT UP/Golden Gate mem¬ ber Virg Parks served as the evening’s emcee, first introducing the “Widow Norton” Jose Sarria and crediting Sarria with initiat¬ ing some of the first queer ac¬ tivism in San Francisco. Sarria, in turn, praised the work of ACT UP and gave the group his best wish¬ es on its anniversary. Next, former New York City activist and current San Francisco resident Michael Petrelis spoke about the formation of the first ACT UP chapter in New York City in 1987. He recalled activist and playwright Larry Kramer exhort¬ ing the crowd to action, claiming that half of those in attendance would be dead prematurely - a prediction that has, according to Petrelis, unfortunately come to pass. Among those gone, he said, is the man who named ACT UP, the late Steev Bohrer. Petrelis noted that he had suggested the name “CAN,” or Cure AIDS Now, as the name for the incipient group, and said “thank God” the suggestion was not accepted. Other missing and dead ac¬ tivists were also recalled, in an ACT UP tradition called “naming names.” Parks led the gathering in calling out the names of friends and fellow activists who have died. It was only one of many times throughout the evening that the crowd was reminded that the AIDS crisis is not over, despite hopeful news about new drugs and falling death rates. Parks also commemorated the living, by asking all past or present members of any ACT UP chapter - nearly three-quarters of those in attendance - to stand. Many cur¬ rent and past members of ACT UP/Golden Gate were in atten¬ dance, as well as members of the group that was known as ACT UP/San Francisco before that chapter split over political dis¬ agreements. Members of the group now using the name ACT UP/San Francisco were not in at¬ tendance. Several of those present commented on the irony that po¬ lice officers were on hand to pro¬ tect the activists, a departure from the group’s historical relationship with the forces of “law and order.” Other speakers and entertain¬ ers at the event included B.A.R. editor Mike Salinas, who also by Dennis Conkin C astro Area Planning and Action will offer up a truly remarkable evening of high dish and drama - an oral history of early gay San Francisco deliv¬ ered by The Widow Norton Jose Sarria, one of the world’s oldest living queens - as a benefit fundraiser this Friday, March 21. The event will begin at 7:30 p.m. at Metropolitan Community Church, located at 150 Eureka Street in the Castro. Tickets are $5 for people who are not members of CAPA, a group of residents, merchants, and professionals working together to influence the growth of the Castro neighbor¬ hood. Sarria will be interviewed at the fundraiser by Supervisor Tom Ammiano, no slouch himself in the high queen department. The duo officiated over a similar event last year, drawing hundreds of les- spoke about the first ACT UP meeting in New York City; comic Julie Wallace; ACT UP members Bill Thorne and Jeff Getty; Sadie Sadie the Rabbi Lady; and Super¬ visor Tom Ammiano. ACT UP/Golden Gate member Hank Wilson said he was very pleased with the turnout, and called the event “a great success.” ▼ bians and gays anxious to hear Sarria’s tales of police raids on gay bars, how the Mafia was driven from bar ownership, and other tidbits about life for San Francis¬ co gay men and lesbians during the late ’40s through the early ’60s. The successful lecture series relates the history of the neigh¬ borhood as a basis for working together in planning the future, according to Phil Siegel, a spokesman for the group. “In planning for the future of the Castro, it’s essential that we have some understanding of our past,” he said. “Our elders are rich and important sources of history. “This was really an astounding event the first time around. We expect this evening to be as won¬ derful.” The groups holds regular meetings on the second Thursday of each month at the Eureka Val¬ ley Recreation Center, 100 Collingwood Street.

One of the attorneys representing the CBC said Bannon’s impersonation of “Dr. Byron Matthews” is illegal - even though the officer was acting in an undercover capacity. The CBC received the audio tape in late February as part of the discovery materials in the crimi¬ nal case against club founder Dennis Peron and five other de¬ fendants. All have pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, possession of marijuana for sale, and transportation of marijuana, and are awaiting their next court appearance, scheduled for April. The audio tape was recorded June 27, 1996, according to Ban¬ non’s voice on the tape. “Dr. Matthews” was returning a call to the CBC regarding potential club member “James Flynn,” who was actually state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) Special Agent Jim Kerrigan, according to the tape. “Mr. Flynn is in fact a patient of mine and currently under my care. At his request, I did write him a letter of diagnosis on June 15,1996...,” says “Dr. Matthews.” J. David Nick, one of the attor¬ neys defending Peron, said that even though the state Health and Safety Code gives undercover offi¬ cers immunity from prosecution while investigating narcotics cases, that immunity is only for specific things such as buying or transporting drugs and does not include peace officers imperson¬ ating medical doctors. “Impersonating a doctor and filling out a fraudulent prescrip¬ tion and [writing a] fraudulent note on a purported doctor’s let¬ terhead is not one of the criminal acts that are exempted [from prosecution],” Nick told the B.A.R. The California Court of Ap¬ peals has interpreted this portion of the Health and Safety Code, Nick explained, and officers can be prosecuted for illegal acts al¬ legedly committed during the course of an undercover opera¬ tion that are not specifically men¬ tioned. Nick also thinks Bannon allegedly committed forgery by signing the fake doctor’s letter. Forgery is also not one of the ex¬ empt acts in the Health and Safe¬ ty Code, according to Nick. Nick said he and the other de¬ fense attorneys will address the issue in court, but said he couldn’t publicly talk about what action is planned. Subterfuge ... to a point Kristen Wahadlo, the attorney representing CBC defendant John Wayne Hudson, told the B.A.R. that Bannon’s audio tape definite¬ ly raises legal issues, particularly around police being allowed to make misleading statements. “Law enforcement agents can employ subterfuge during investi¬ gations, but the fact that an offi¬ cer impersonated a doctor may raise additional issues. It raises legal issues that we are pursuing,” Wahadlo said. Defense attorneys may file a discovery motion to examine per¬ sonnel files of the undercover of¬ ficers, to see if complaints of mis¬ representation and other false¬ hoods have been made against them, she added. Matt Ross, spokesman for state Attorney General Dan Lungren, said he’s not aware of any limit as to what undercover officers can pose as while on an investigation. He said he could not get into specifics of the CBC investigation. In a January interview with the B.A.R., Bannon said he could not comment on his role in the CBC investigation until the court case has been completed. He did say “this investigation never, ever meant to target sick people.” T YOU’VE COT FAMILY IN THE BU/INE/X Talk to us tor straightforward (no pun intended) answers to CELLULARONE* Quality Service WITH DIGITAL SERVICE, IT'S ONE LOW RATE ALL OVER THE STATE rainbow^|Fwireless* 10% of all company profits go to local AIDS organizations to help fight the battle against AIDS (415)431-8222 * 2354 Market • San Francisco In between Under One Roof & Streetlight Records directly above Leather Zone SUNTRIPS HAW AII ^■219 MAUI !249 $ ROUNOTRIP AIRFARE CO 169 $169 5259 m*.

Even worse, their slogan, “Every penny helps the fight against AIDS,” is remarkably similar to the AIDS Emergency Fund’s “Every penny counts” slogan on its coin jars, and AEF staff mem¬ bers are very concerned that peo¬ ple may confuse the two groups. Joan Juster, director of income development for AEF, said she re¬ ceived confirmation from the In¬ ternal Revenue Service (IRS) Wednesday, March 12, that there is no record of tax-exempt status for “Essential AIDS.” The group is also not listed with the charities section of the Los Angeles Police Department, a requirement for agencies soliciting money in Los Angeles. Juster filed a report of suspect¬ ed fraud with the San Francisco Police Department after she saw coin jars at a store on Post and Fillmore streets in Japantown and at a store on California Street last weekend. In both instances, she was able to take the jars after talk¬ ing with the owners. “Our main concern is that the public may be confused. We’ve built our reputation on our penny jars,” Juster told the B.A.R. “One of our drivers saw the jars at sev¬ eral stores in the Castro on Tues¬ day, March 11, and in some cases, the owners weren’t even asked if they [jars] could be displayed. “It disturbs us that this organi¬ zation is using a similar logo that may confuse the public,” she added. Juster said she was told a young woman and a man brought the jars to at least some of the stores last Thursday, March 6. AEF, one of San Francisco’s oldest AIDS charities, has success¬ fully used penny jars and the slo¬ gan “Every penny counts” to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars locally since 1987. Juster said the money goes directly to people with AIDS and is often the last re¬ sort for people who have no other financial options. “We have hundreds of jars throughout the Bay Area, and we encourage people to seek them Beware the giver: a good penny jar and a bad penny jar. out. Every penny does count, and our money does go to people with AIDS. Our need is greater than ever. We have a huge increase in client requests now,” said Juster. A staff member at Project Open Hand also discovered the “Essential AIDS” jars at a store last week. Jim Illig, director of gov¬ ernment operations at the agency, told the B.A.R. they became sus¬ picious, and he began inquiring about the organization. “This is a suspected fraud, they’re raising money under false pretenses,” Illig said of “Essential AIDS.” No record at Stanford Both Juster and Illig called Stanford University, which is list¬ ed on a letter from “Essential AIDS” as being a recipient of the money raised. Not surprisingly, Stanford has never heard of the group and has no record of any contributions. A woman who identified her¬ self as Lana answered the phone number listed on “Essential AIDS” materials. She said the group has been around for two years. “We started taking [coin jars] around two months ago. We’re collecting money for laboratories and universities and trying to open a facility in Los Angeles,” said Lana, who became suspicious of the caller’s questions. Illig also spoke with Lana and said she became suspicious when he asked for copies of financial statements and other informa¬ tion. According to the state Attorney General’s Registry of Charitable Trusts, “Essential AIDS, Inc.” reg¬ istered in January 1996. However, the group has never filed a re¬ quired financial report, and there is no IRS tax-exempt letter on file.

Yamashita ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT Chip Murray CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING David McBrayer BAR TALK & GENERAL INFORMATION Jason Snyder DISTRIBUTION Andy McConnell Like a bad penny I n the relatively short list of things we hate, from overwrought conservative lawmakers to undercooked eggs, very few things even come close to the way we feel about people who steal from the dead and dying. These days the industry of steal¬ ing from people living with HIV, and steal¬ ing in the name of AIDS research, has reached a new zenith - or nadir, depending upon your viewpoint. The latest entry into the market is by a Los Angeles-based group (if, in fact, it is anything more than just a couple of people) calling itself “Essential AIDS.” We had never heard of the group before this week, when Essential AIDS penny collection jars start¬ ed appearing in Bay Area shops. As we re¬ port on page 5, the slogan on the jars is al¬ most identical to the motto of the AIDS Emergency Fund’s long-running penny drive, and seems to be specifically designed to confuse prospective donors. A check into some of the “facts” supplied by Essential AIDS also shows problems: the tax identification number they give is “in¬ correct,” but no correction has been forth¬ coming. Its claim that Stanford University is a beneficiary came as a complete surprise to those in the know at Stanford when they were asked about it. And a call to the Essen¬ tial AIDS “office” would indicate, based on the ambient noise in the background, that the organization is run out of a home kitchen. Hmmm. Even if Essential AIDS is a legitimate or¬ ganization that just can’t get its paperwork in order, its penny jars are not welcome here in the Bay Area. The AIDS Emergency Fund has done a superlative job of meeting the needs of local residents with HIV, based largely on its coin collection efforts. The fact is that this couldn’t have come at a worse time for AEF, which is struggling with the reality that sometimes good news (like pro¬ tease inhibitors and combination therapy) can be bad news (when it means an escalat¬ ing number of clients, needing help for longer periods of time). Even without the new penny jars cluttering up local shelves and taking money away from its treasury, AEF would still be more desperately in need of money than ever before. The situation is so bad, to tell the truth, that the annual award ceiling for fund recipients has to be lowered, albeit reluctantly. Shame on Essential AIDS for its ma¬ neuvering. If it’s legal, it stinks. If it isn’t, we look forward to a swift arrest and severe punishment of those involved. The law simply cannot allow unscrupulous opera¬ tors to further victimize the AIDS com¬ munity. We are especially sad about the problems at AEF because that group has always been so dedi¬ cated to keeping its costs down. It doesn’t pay its people any of those six-figure salaries that cause such controversy at some other or¬ ganizations (and we aren’t referring ex¬ clusively to San Francisco groups); over¬ head at AEF is kept to less than ten percent, so more than 90 cents of every dollar goes back into the hands of PWAs in the form of direct financial grants (ironically, that’s about the opposite of the so-called “AIDS PAC” we reported on a few weeks ago - where a full 93 percent has fu¬ eled the operation since its inception, and only seven percent has been given out); and its fundraisers raise funds for the organiza¬ tion, not the organizers (unlike some bike peddlers and other thonmeisters we know of). We could do with more AIDS service groups keeping in mind the real reason they exist: it isn’t to provide employees with salaries “comparable” to the private sector or anywhere else. It isn’t to allow some organiz¬ er access to fancy Washington balls. It isn’t even to give a bunch of walkers/runners/ dancers/bikers a fun time. It is to fight the dis¬ ease. And people who make a killing on the dying deserve all the contempt they get - and, frequently, a prison sentence as well. The telephone number given by Essential AIDS is (212) 874-3004; if you are curious about what they’re doing here in the Bay Area, give them a call. If you are a store owner and are approached by people from Essential AIDS, refuse to take their jars until they can provide financial statements and an accurate tax identification number. If you see one of their jars in a local store, explain the situation to the owner or manager - who, from what we hear, may not even be aware it’s there, since part of the scheme seems to rely upon plac¬ ing the jars behind the backs of the unsus¬ pecting store employees. And for goodness sake, be aware of the impact this will have upon AEF. Take a minute to search out the real “ Every Penny Counts” jars and drop in a buck or two. The health and safety of thousands of San Fran¬ ciscans with HIV depends upon your help. Every penny does count. And every bad penny hurts. ▼ -N V C — Once again banned By the 'Ancient order of HIBERNIANS’\" ASA GROUP ORGANIZED FOR THEIR SEXUAL PREFERENCE, RADICAL FAIRIES, SHANNON AND SEAMUS FORMA PARADE CONSTITUENCY THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF THE SEXUALITY OF ALL IRISH.

Being mindful of the limited time we would have together, Irv decided to ask the mayor for support of one issue and offer our support on another. We asked the mayor to sponsor, with the GGBA, a forum or summit to address the issues surrounding work re-entry for HIV¬ positive people. Our message to the mayor was that the need to address the concerns of workplace re-entry for persons with HIV is vital to our membership and the greater community. Through the introduction of protease in¬ hibitors, many of us are capable of coming back into the workplace as productive busi¬ ness members. Yet to do so could mean the abandonment of healthcare and disability packages received from previous employers. Just as the Human Resource industry pio¬ neered compassionate responses to the needs of persons with HIV leaving the workplace, they must address the concerns of the same group re-en¬ tering the workplace. There are also political ques¬ tions surrounding what constitutes “well.” The mayor was quick to un¬ derstand the significance of our request. He promised to develop, with the GGBA, a forum or summit of leaders in the human re¬ source, benefits, healthcare, insurance, labor and medical communities to formulate a re¬ sponse to this crucial matter. Our discussion then turned to the issue of domestic partnership benefits and the pride we felt as an organization from the mayor’s championing issues of significance to our community. The mayor was disap¬ pointed in the lack of support from the press for his position on domestic partner¬ ship benefits, but was determined to defend his position and the laws of this city. We feel the issue of domestic partner benefits and the mayor’s leadership on this issue is deserving of the GGBA’s and our community’s full support. As we strive to- _ __ ward equal treatment of our members in the workplace and in society at large, we feel this issue has profound ramifications for each of us. It should give all of us a sense of pride to know that the mayor stands side by side with us on this issue - Mayor Brown, we applaud your efforts on our behalf. The gay and lesbian community has a true friend in the mayor’s office. San Fran¬ cisco is once again taking a leadership role in developing responses to the ongoing HIV+ saga. ▼ 13 March 1997 BAY AREA REPORTER 7 Oklahoma, OK! I have a few comments concerning the article in the B.A.R. [Feb. 27] about the Oklahoma legislature’s attempt to forbid the state from doing business with any company or vendor that “recognizes, supports, encourages, promotes, tolerates or otherwise allows” same-gender marriage, or domestic partnerships. SF Supervisor Susan Leal called the legislation “discriminatory and mean-spirited,” and considered a boycott against travel to the state, then turns right around and says, “I wasn’t so worried about travel to Oklahoma ... because who the hell wants to go there?” And California State Assemblywoman Carole Migden laughed when she said, “Frankly, it’s not a central vacation spot for us.” I am incensed at these insensitive and naive remarks about Oklahoma. There are thousands and thousands of gay Okla¬ homans in and out of-the closet (mostly in) for whom that piece of legislation scared the hell out of them. They live normal, everyday lives with a little secret they must hide to stay employed. And believe me, it is not easy to be employed in a well-paying job in that state. Now, when the weekends roll around, it’s an¬ other story ... they party at the 30 or so gay bars in Oklahoma City, with official police protection. There are more women’s bars there than in LA and SF com¬ bined. They are clean, fun, all kinds of music, all kinds of dykes, all kinds of bars. There is a strip on 39th Street that features several men’s and women’s clubs, under-18 dance bars, huge mixed dance clubs, video bars, restaurants, bookstores, gift shops, help centers, and a hotel that is filled to ca¬ pacity every weekend from gay people from all over the country. It is Gay Cen¬ tral on the weekends, when all these clos¬ eted people can finally work out their frus¬ trations. Migden and Leal should pay a little visit. They might get laid! I voted for both of those women and they will be hearing from me directly. Their remarks were inappropriate and flippant and uninformed. I expect much more from our elected gay officials. I grew up in Oklahoma and have many, many friends still there. The gay community in Okla¬ homa deserves our support, our encouragement, our love, notour derision and mockery. Kate Warren San Francisco Not bogeymen (and women) Margaret Deirdre O’Hartigan’s Guest Opinion, “Are You Transgender?” ( B.A.R ., February 27, 1997) is a contradictory, unenlightened, paranoid, trans- genderphobic rant. She alternately condemns labels such as transsexual, bisexual, lesbian, etc., then seems to praise them. Very contradictory! She wonders what she has in common with such transgender people as straight cross-dressing men. I am part of a large, if somewhat loose, transgender community that includes transsexuals, cross-dressing men, cross-dressing women, people who have had surgery, those that will never have surgery, significant others, children, and friends. The transgender movement is about people who reject tired, old ways of being, whether those ways are espoused by the dominant heterosexual society, or transsexuals like Ms. O’Hartigan. The transgender movement is also being supported theoretically by people like Martine Rothblatt, whom she condemns. She may not feel like part of the transgender movement, that’s OK. But she should not character¬ ize us as being monsters in a bad science fiction movie. To do so makes those of us who identify as transgender sound like we are bogeymen (and women) hiding under your bed, ready to jump out and get you. I think part of the problem is that Ms. O’Hartigan seems to base her theories of gender on Star Trek movies. She would do better to reread Martine Roth¬ blatt, Kate Bornstein, Leslie Feinberg, and other en¬ lightened transgender people. Mina Schwartz San Francisco Stadium envy Jim Provenzano has not written anything relevant to local or national sports in at least the past two months. He should write about sportswriter Mike Lupica’s book Mad As Hell: How Sports Got Away from the Fans and How We Get It Back. Lupica has excel¬ lent suggestions for stopping the abuse stadium envy- afflicted team owners and superstar athletes heap on the public. A huge disaster was foisted on Oakland, and the potential for a thermonuclear economic meltdown, brought to you by His Willieness, exists in San Francisco. Provenzano has nothing to say. Does anyone give a damn? Thornton Kimes San Francisco [Editor's note: A thing doesn't have to be a stadium to be a sports arena J Leather artifacts I must admit I am an avid reader of Mr. Marcus’s column covering the worldwide leather scene, and I commend you for having an informed columnist who weekly gives us all a big charge with his tongue- in-cheek reporting. I have noticed a disturbing trend in the goings-on in the leather “tribe” and feel I must comment here¬ with, because the legacies established by the leather community in the past must forever be remembered by younger devotees of the genre. In the current issue, (Issue #9), Mr. Marcus re¬ ported that at the Leather Dyke Mommy and Dyke Daddy contests at the Eagle on Saturday, Feb. 22, all the former Ms. San Francisco Leathers donated their sashes and/or vests to the Leather Archives and Mu¬ seum in Chicago! While I can appreciate and understand this preser¬ vation of the leather community’s artifacts, I find it highly incomprehensible that our leather leaders would even think of donating their sashes to a muse¬ um in Chicago when we have in San Francisco one of the country’s most comprehensive lesbian and gay archives housed in our sparkling new library. In this day and age, when hands are out at every turn for moneys to aid charitable organizations, little priority is given to monetarily supporting the gay 8c lesbian archives here. And while I admire what Mr. Chuck Renslow is doing, since when has Chicago be¬ come the center of leather history? The leather com¬ munity of Chicago may have their own sense of pride and accomplishment. The biggest | leather event, International Mr. Leather competition, may be a stellar event for leather people everywhere, but when it comes to downright hard core leather and a vibrant leather one at that, San Francisco’s leather community has no peer(s). Well, they gave their sashes away. Let’s hope those who didn’t and those leather men who have held the esteemed Mr. Leather of San Francisco title will not do the same. If Mr. Renslow wants leather artifacts, he should be tapping the shoulders of all his 18 or so International Mr. Leathers to get their sashes and vests. While I am a deep admirer and constant fan of Mr. Marcus and all the good things he has done for leather people everywhere, I would hope he would recognize this disturbing trend of donating every¬ thing in leather to Chicago and would devote some of his writing energy to urging our local leather title holders that their artifacts should remain in San Fran¬ cisco. I don’t remember reading or hearing anywhere that Chicago is the leather capital of the world. We all know where the capital is, don’t we? Samuel Menkes San Francisco Roland Bynum, this is your life! [The following letter was sent to Mr. Marcus:] Love reading your column every week in the B.A.R. However, I have some questions for you: In the recent IML judges announcements, you say “longtime leather contest entrepreneur Roland Bynum of Port¬ land, Oregon” will be a judge. Is this the same Roland Bynum who has only been producing leather contests for five years? Is this the same Roland Bynum who has only had one contestant in each of his contests for the last two years? Is this the same Roland Bynum that scheduled his contest this year against a well-known and well-pub¬ licized tenth-year anniversary Court charity event? Is this the same Roland Bynum whose own title- holder (a very hard-working Barry Burns) refused to attend the scheduled contest this year, instead sup¬ porting the Court’s charity event? The same Roland who was loudly booed by the crowd at that event when Mr. Burns tried to save Roland’s face and thank him for his aid during the past year? Is this the same Roland Bynum who refused to move this year’s contest, threatened the “competitor” charity event, and then wrote “Title Withdrawn” on posters around town and canceled the title for the fu¬ ture? Is this the same Roland Bynum who has refused to account for the $650+ dollars of community money he raised at joint Eagle/Slaughters events - money that was supposed to go toward sending his contestant to Chicago? Who has refused to give that money back to the community, or explain how it was used? Is this the same Roland Bynum whose only claim to fame - other than being a questionable “longtime leather contest entrepreneur” - is being the partner to Bill Schmeling, the infamous and wonderful Hun? Roland Bynum is an IML judge? Guess their judg¬ ing standards must be lower than we thought. Name withheld by request Portland, Oregon [Uh, dunno.

CST# 1007939-20 Cars for the bear-size man I have just looked through your 20 February 1997 issue. I found a letter to the editor about Chrysler’s lack of negotiation regarding the inclusion of a phrase in a labor contract and the apparent belittling of the situation by a Chrysler representative. Your “Out There” gossip column had a snippet about Chrysler’s threat (unsubstantiated) to pull one year of advertis¬ ing from Esquire over an article they deemed not within the standards of journalism they wish to sup¬ port. I also saw the quarter-page advertisement on page 3 for two bears trying to earn a living selling Chrysler cars. At least the B.A.R. is even-handed. My take on this entire situation is one of practi¬ cality. Do I base a buying decision on the sentiment that refusal to sponsor an article equals “the homo¬ phobia business?” Or do I help my bear brothers by buying a product they offer for sale and in which I have an interest? Do I base the decision on the single side of the labor issues I have heard? Or do I go ahead and buy the product, knowing I am helping provide a pay- check to those very same employees who are fighting this cause? Finally, do I step away from the products of one of the few car companies still addressing the needs of the bear-size man because of things about which I have insufficient information to make an informed judg¬ ment? My next car will likely be another Chrysler prod¬ uct. I feel far better about buying one of them than in buying from companies like GM, with their recent history, of boardroom anti-Semitism. Or from the likes of Daimler-Benz, BMW, and VW, with their his¬ tory of using slave labor that included gays, enslaved merely for what they were. David J. Mann Concord, CA Dings in the Great American Car Deal Thank you for printing “Looking at a Chrysler? Kick more than the tires!” about Chrysler’s refusal to merely include “sexual orientation” in its anti-dis¬ crimination policy, and the shortcomings of Chrysler Motors and the automobile industry in general. We note Misters Bufkin’s and Nettleton’s B.A.R. Dec. 96 response, in which they mischaracterize CARveat Emptor (the Internet Website that’s driving Detroit dingy) and misstatements about “Looking at a Chrysler?” We are pleased to hear that Mr. Bufkin’s and Net¬ tleton’s unnamed dealership principals and Chrysler Motors blesses their loving relationship and appreci¬ ates their salesmanship. However, we wonder if that support is so genuine, why two simple words, “sexu¬ al orientation,” cannot be included in Chrysler’s anti- discrimination policy, as it has been already in Ford Motors and General Motors corporate policies on discrimination in the workplace. Their defense of Chrysler and the industry as only one among many other unscrupulous industries seems unwholesome, evasive, and permissive. We typically do not distinguish slander and libel with written responses, but since Mr. Bufkin and Net- tleton have mischaracterized CARveat Emptor as “hostile and childish,” a response is warranted. Rather, “CARveat Emptor: CAR BUYER BEWARE of Tricks of the Great American Car Deal” is a legitimate and serious (even humorous) effort to repair the many ding factors in the Great American Car Deal. We have merely identified tricks of the car deal that by others’ accounts and reports (not ours), cost our friends and families tens of billions of dollars every year in this country. Fraud alone in auto sales and ser¬ vice practices costs over $22 billion annually. Odome¬ ter fraud costs as much or more than $10 billion every year, even though tamper-proof odometers have been technologically feasible for at least a decade. Unfair and manipulative auto sales and service practices including: grounding; flipping and turning; lemon laundering; curbstoning; double dipping; in¬ voice tampering; unchecked profit creep; price goug¬ ing; service shenanigans in all forms (remember Sears and Roebuck?); undisclosed damage, defects or re¬ pairs; selling redundant or overlapping warranties and unnecessary undercoatings; deal milking; psy¬ chologically manipulative advertising; blaming the customer; customer ping-pong; artificially shorting supply; and system selling, is merely a partial list of the tradition of unfair, manipulative and fraudulent sales and services practices that American consumers have endured for decades. We encourage everyone to visit CARveat Emptor. at: http://www.well.com/user/kr2, share it with friends, family, neighbors, strangers and opponents, and decide for themselves whether the prevalent low repute of the auto industry is a figment of our imag¬ inations or the result of decades of abuse by an anti¬ consumer industry demeanor and practice. With your help, we’re repairing the dings in the Great American Car Deal. Happy motoring, wheel¬ ing and dealing. Rand Knox San Rafael, CA The living proof Regarding Mr. M.

Bruce Jackson San Francisco Obituary for a dear friend The lesbian and gay pride celebration of the South Bay, 1971-1996. A post-mortuary reflection: We have all lost a dear friend, a friend that shall be sorely missed by the entire community. Let me share with you my perspective of our dear friend’s short but meaningful life. The celebration was born through the efforts of a small group of visionaries who wanted to inspire pride in all our community, for us to be able to stand proud and acknowledge our rightful place in society. The first celebrations started modestly through the combined efforts of our diverse community. Through a labor of love, commitment and nurturing, the cel¬ ebration grew. The beginning celebrations were small “compared to larger cities,” but we no longer needed to look elsewhere for our pride. Before we knew it, our fledgling celebration became strong, and along with this strength came a sense of unity and empow¬ erment within our community. This was achieved by the tireless efforts of the volunteers who gave of themselves, their time, patience, love and expertise. These people set aside their egos and personal differ¬ ences to work together for a common goal. Like any entity, its needs grew and important is¬ sues arose which needed to be addressed by the com¬ munity. Many people tried to address these issues in¬ dividually as well as collectively. When the realization came that our dear friend was beginning to lose its battle for survival, many friends stepped forward to try to resuscitate it, that our friend was more than just a party to be held once in a year, it was the pride we were to share in ourselves as gay and lesbian people and our time together. The handful of volunteers who took the responsi¬ bilities of making the celebrations a meaningful state¬ ment of our pride knew that they had to contend with the needs of a largely diverse community, it was im¬ possible to be everything to everyone, but in earnest effort the celebration committee tried to accommo¬ date all the community’s concerns. In an effort to understand what has happened over the years, let us not reflect on the negative, or the fin¬ ger-pointing of who did what, but remember the pos¬ itives. The first celebrations being held at St. James park, moving to the County Fairgrounds, the Stock- ton Street fair, the first Gay Pride Parade in 1991, the anniversary of Stonewall 25, and the ultimate move into Guadalupe River Park, with the Parade being held on Market Street in downtown San Jose. These sometimes painful changes in growth were not just in the physical, but strengthened our visibility and growth in personal pride for ourselves and the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual communities. The Gay Pride Celebration is survived by the Les¬ bian, Gay & Bisexual Community of the South Bay. In lieu of flowers or donations, please give your support and respect to a friend or organization that was there for you when you needed some support. I would like to believe that in future years a new kind of celebration of our lives will be born. I would personally like to thank all the volunteers, businesses and organizations within our community, and the non-gay and lesbian community who contributed to making the celebrations the successes that they were and hope that you will continue the support of our community and its needs as it continues to grow. Rod L. Blair B.O.D. GPCCSJ 1986-1993 San Jose, CA They’re no ‘Angels’ The battle against discrimination in employment is being lost at our universities, as administrators scurry to reinstate ROTC and allow military recruit¬ ment on campus. Congress has tied educational as¬ sistance to cooperation with the military in its prac¬ tice of rooting out homosexuals and destroying their lives and livelihoods. In San Francisco there is something we can do to express our opposition. We can put a stop to Fleet Week, the Navy’s annual display of saber-rattling de¬ signed to promote recruiting in the Bay Area. Every September, fighter jets scream over our city, flipping the bird at gay and pacifist communities. Why do we put up with it? In its darkest hour, the battle against discrimination needs a symbol of one city bold enough to say, “We don’t celebrate bigotry.” Douglas Montgomery San Francisco 13 March 1997 BAY AREA REPORTER 9 Boxer climbs into ring by Wayne Friday B arely three years ago in 1994, when the Republicans took over Congress for the first time in decades, California’s junior U.S. senator, Barbara Boxer, immediately became one of their top Democratic targets for defeat in the 1998 general elec¬ tions. Indeed, even many of Boxer’s supporters among Cali¬ fornia Democratic leaders felt the 56-year-old liberal hadn’t much chance of surviving a tough re- election campaign. That, of course, is all history now, as Barbara Boxer has defi¬ nitely taken off the gloves and is, according to several recent polls, the one to beat next year. It does¬ n’t hurt that Senator Boxer, once thought to be too “radical” even by California standards, not only heads into the 1998 battle as the early favorite, but also as a true Washington insider. Following ten years in the House, Boxer cap¬ tured a Senate seat in 1993 after a bruising ef¬ fort against conservative Republican Bruce Herschensohn. While Boxer seemed at first to take a back seat in D.C. to her fel¬ low senator, Dianne Fein- Stein, on many issues, she now is seen as one of the shrewdest and hardest-working members of the upper chamber. Republicans such as Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky make no secret of their plans to paint Barbara Boxer as a “strident liberal” who’s “out of touch” with California voters. However, many of Boxer’s votes during the past few years have struck a responsive chord with her constituents - one of the reasons why she’s currently looking good against any Repub¬ lican in next year’s general elec¬ tion. As of the first of this year, Boxer had amassed only about $1 million in her war chest, but her impressive standing in the polls should help her fundraising capa¬ bilities. She raised and spent $10.5 million in 1992, and most expect she will need something near the $14.5 million Feinstein spent in 1994 if she is to hold on to her seat. While Republicans face a bruising primary contest next year among likely senatorial can¬ didates state Treasurer Matt Fong, San Diego Mayor Susan Golding, San Diego businessman Darrell Issa, and three or four GOP House members, Boxer ap¬ pears to have a clear field for the Demo nod and is already off and running a full-time campaign even as she attends to her D.C. duties. Among some of the more important votes Boxer has cast in the Senate are for a 1996 measure that raised the federal minimum wage and provided business tax breaks, a bill that was later signed into law. She courageously op¬ posed the controversial Defense of Marriage Act, which would have allowed states to deny recognition of marriages of same-gender cou¬ ples performed in other states (Bill Clinton later signed the bill into law). On other issues, Senator Boxer has voted against a recent pro¬ posed amendment to the Consti¬ tution that would have required a balanced federal budget by 2002. She also opposed legislation im¬ Our Man Friday posing major changes on federal welfare laws (which Clinton later signed into law); opposed a measure that would ' have banned certain late-term abortions; supported the Safe Drinking Water Act; supported a $4.1 billion re¬ duction in the Defense bud¬ get (the pro¬ posal was, however, defeated by the full Senate); and opposed a law making naturalized immi¬ grants ineligible for welfare bene¬ fits and another barring welfare payments to recipients who have more children. While an admitted unabashed liberal, Barbara Boxer has listened and listened well to her California constituents, and the result seems to be that they pretty much have liked her performance during her first term - if the polls are to be believed. Republicans heaped scorn on Senator Boxer in 1995 when she became one of the Sen¬ ate’s most vocal critics of then- Senator Robert Packwood (R- Oregon), accused by several women of sexual harassment. Boxer angered not only many Re¬ publicans, but a number of De¬ mocrats as well. In the end, however, Senator Boxer was vindicated when Pack- wood - faced with expulsion due to mounting evidence of flagrant sexual misconduct and obstruc¬ tion of justice - eventually re¬ signed his seat. Those close to Boxer’s re-election campaign say she hopes Feinstein will seek the California governorship next year. “Dianne’s name on the ticket helped her immensely in 1992, and it will certainly do so again next year,” explained one Boxer staffer. Regardless of who runs for governor (and Feinstein is said to be leaning more toward entering the race as her self-imposed June decision date nears), Barbara Boxer, all but ruled out of win¬ ning re-election two years ago, has staged a remarkable comeback and is clearly in the catbird’s seat at present. I don’t know who the Republicans will nominate against Boxer, but they’re clearly not going to enjoy the cakewalk they expected. Politics and people The Toklas and Milk Demo Clubs, the Bay Area Non-Partisan Alliance, and Baymec are among those sponsoring a fundraiser/re¬ ception for San Mateo Supe can¬ didate Richard Gordon on Tues¬ day, March 18, 6-9 p.m. at 430 Central Avenue, SF. Look for As¬ semblywoman Carole Migden to be a special guest. A $100 dona¬ tion is requested (RSVP early, if possible, at 368-1061). San Mateo voters will go to the polls April 8, and Gordon, an openly gay man, needs our help. See you there. I went to a screening of the Howard Stern movie, Private Parts. Don’t waste your money on this jerk, who seems obsessed with whining about his small penis. Shock jock Stern once sug¬ gested on his radio show that Magic Johnson somehow “de¬ served” his HIV virus and Rod¬ ney King somehow “deserved” the beating he got from the cops. This is a homophobic, misogynis- tic horse’s ass who “deserves” an even smaller appendage. So why is “retired” campaign consultant Clint Reilly coming out to work against the revenue bond deal for the proposed 49er stadium complex? Most insiders say that it’s “get even” time with Mayor Willie Brown for the “never forgive, never forget” Reilly. Rumor has it: Former Gov. Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown as the next mayor of Oakland? For¬ mer Supervisor Annemarie Con¬ roy to join the race for city trea¬ surer? Soon to be termed-out state Senator Quentin Kopp still looking at a possible statewide race for attorney general? Pretty boy Supe Gavin New¬ som was a bust at his recent Milk Club appearance, drawing snick¬ ers from the crowd. The rich rookie supe is in danger of having the “lightweight” label perma¬ nently affixed to his name. Secretary of State Bill Jones is sponsoring legislation to require that all voters present valid ID (driver’s license, California ID card, voter registration card) at the polling place. Seems like a good idea to me! Texas Governor George Bush Jr. is riding a 69 percent approval rating as he heads into next year’s re-election campaign - making pappy happy (not to mention Babs)! He’s sure to be a player - some are touting him as a possi¬ ble candidate - in the 2000 GOP presidential campaign. Vice President Al “I did noth¬ ing illegal” Gore will address a joint session of the California Legislature today (March 13) in Sacramento. He’ll “talk about any¬ thing he wants, but nothing in particular,” says Senate President Pro Tern Bill Lockyer, who invit¬ ed the popular and until recently untarnished veep. ▼ Stanley E.

Not much use when you get a postcard from someone who wants you to call her back, and the card with her number disappears from the counter next to the phone ma¬ chine, along with a bottle of wine. There’s a theme hiding out here: how to be open to “spiritu¬ ality” - a fuller sense of life and the interweaving of one’s being with the universe - in daily life (good idea) while also refining one’s ethics, and living them, on a rational basis (mandatory). Even Sapphistication if you value intuitive knowledge, it’s only a fact for you but not for others unless you can make a case for it on objective grounds. Spiritual Swede This came to mind as I read a booklet in the definitive Crafts¬ man-style building that is the Swedenborgian Church in Pacif¬ ic Heights, popular for weddings like the recent one of a bisexual friend. This was my first time in¬ side; from the outside, if felt like it could be haunted. Sure enough, the organist was warm¬ ing up with some really spooky minor key stuff ... cool! The bride had asked for formal leather attire and whether she could fix me up with her sister, the _ matron of honor. This may be “only in San Francisco,” but from someone who’s lived here less than a year? I’d read about Swedenborg in eighth grade, with my mother’s encouragement. She wanted me to know about esoteric traditions - and why Catholicism was true and they weren’t - so I’d not get seduced by them (like that worked). He was an 18th-century Swedish scientist and inventor who eventually explored consciousness in a very Tibetan Buddhist-like way (starting with using the space between waking and sleep) and discovered on his own principles the yoga of breath¬ ing. The Swedenborgian Church seems very mainstream Protes¬ tant, but open to its esoteric side. Available at this one was an ex¬ cellent pamphlet, Pioneer of Inner Space , for $1. Swedenborg said good inten¬ tions were insufficient; one’s spir¬ itual life must flow into actions in society. He believed “the physical world is merely symbolic of the spiritual world,” that things exist both for themselves and to reveal a higher dimension of being. To understand the totality of exis¬ tence and consciousness, one must use both reason and intu¬ ition. Life and experiences can be teaching metaphors. ▼ James G.Gregory D.D.S.

If he had washed out, would baseball have stuck by him? Think it took soul- searching to honor a non-lesbian? How wrenching was it to award it to ... a Dodger* Anyway, local ballplayer/man¬ ager Bill Rigney (Oakland Oaks, New York and San Francisco Gi¬ ants, Oakland A’s) recalled what it was like when the Brooklyn Dodgers came to play the rival Gi¬ ants at the Polo Grounds. The clubhouses were past center field, and when the Dodgers would come out, all the Giants fans would boo. “Robinson never came out with the rest of the Dodgers,” Rigney said. “He’d wait behind and come out by himself so he could get his own boos.” From tens of thousands of people, no less. Wow. I bow at the feet of the master. I am not wor¬ thy! 13 March 1997 BAY AREA REPORTER 11 Proving lesbians’ diversity by Simon LeVay, Ph.D. I n 1993 a group of five scientists at the National Cancer Insti tute, led by molecular geneti¬ cist Dean Hamer, reported that a gene on the X chromosome influ¬ ences men’s sexual orientation. Of the five scientists only one, Angela Pattatucci, was openly queer. But she more than made up for any coyness among her colleagues. A self-proclaimed “dyke,” Pattatucci spoke at colleges and community groups around the country, pre¬ senting the research from a thor¬ oughly queer perspective. Yet Pattatucci’s perspective is not just that of a lesbian, but a les¬ bian with a remarkable life histo¬ ry. Her childhood was marked by severe abuse, which led to her be¬ coming so withdrawn that she was labeled mentally retarded. She attributes the abuse to homopho¬ bia - to the fact that her family unconsciously recognized her as lesbian before she herself was aware of her sexual orientation. At age 14 she ran away from home and lived for some time on Chica¬ go’s meanest streets. Eventually she was rescued by a much older gay man, Ray Biever, who took her in and helped her to finish high school. Later, he encouraged her to fulfill her desire for higher education, which included nurs¬ ing school, college, and graduate school. Biever died a few years ago, but Pattatucci still refers to him as her real father. Although Pattatucci’s research on the sexual orientation of men gained the most media attention, she has also done significant work on women. Her research (done in collaboration with Hamer) has shown that a lesbian or bisexual orientation clusters in families: the sisters, daughters, nieces and one kind of cousin (the daughters of paternal uncles) all have an in¬ creased chance of themselves being lesbian or bisexual. This clustering does not by it¬ self mean that women’s sexual orientation is inherited, and Pat¬ tatucci herself remains cautious on this question. She has found that the gene on the X chromo¬ some that influences men’s sexual orientation has little or no influence on the sexual orientation of women. That leaves about one hundred thousand other genes to pick through, some¬ thing that may take a while. As Pattatucci sees it, lesbians are more di¬ verse than gay men. She suspects that some women are genetically predisposed to become lesbian, and her data suggest that it may be those women who be¬ come aware of same-sex attraction early in life. What guides other women to a lesbian orientation, Pattatucci doesn’t know. Pattatucci thinks of her re¬ search as a purely scientific quest, not as something needed to prove the “biological worthiness” of les¬ bians or gay men. Thus, while Hamer has taken the genetic data into the arena of gay rights - he testified about his group’s re¬ search in the Colorado Amend¬ ment 2 trial, for example - Pat¬ tatucci takes a different view. “The fundamental issue,” she told me recently, “is not whether we were ‘born queer,’ it is whether hetero¬ sexual society has the right to dis¬ criminate against us, regardless of how we came to be queer.” Pattatucci recently left the NCI to take a faculty position at a medical school in Puerto Rico. Her research focuses on HIV in¬ fection in the female sex worker population on the island. Perhaps her own history played a role in that choice of topic, for as she tells it, life in the streets is harsh, and j often the only way for a young woman to survive is through | prostitution. Biever’s intercession likely saved her from that path. Pattatucci, now 44, lives in the mountainous interior of the island - the campo - far from the tourist resorts along the coast. She lives with her partner, their two teenage children, three dogs, a cat, and a cockatiel. In her spare time she plants fruit trees on their three acres of land, and writes. She recently fin¬ ished her first book, Women in Science (Sage Publications), and is also nearing comple¬ tion of a novel, titled 2013: The Emergence of a New World Order. Although her pre¬ sent situation might seem like a fine recipe for a settled middle age, Pattatucci is in fact considering her options. She wants to return to the study of sexual ori¬ entation, although perhaps not to the question of its heritability, which she has never considered the most important topic. More inter¬ esting, she says, is the question of how a queer identity develops within the family, and how family dynamics are affected when a member reveals that he or she is queer. It’s a topic that must arouse painful personal memories for her. Yet science has often profited from the motivation that individual life histories, even individual tragedies, have instilled in scientists. ▼ Simon LeVay, Ph.D., is well- known for his research on the “gay brain.” He is the author of Queer Science (MIT Press, 1996) and the forthcoming gay techno-thriller, Albrick’s Gold | (Richard Kasak/Masquerade Books). He is also the co¬ founder of the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education in West Hollywood. He can be reached care of the B.A.R. or at SLeVay@aol.com. Rich Gordon ◄ page 1 Gordon’s treasury to date, which has raised over $60,000, is clearly indicative of his gathering political strength. Gordon is proud that, unlike other candi¬ dates, he has not had to lend his own money to the campaign. “So far,” he told the B.A.R ., “at least 85% of the funds have come from individuals, with 52% com¬ ing from voters giving $50 or less each. From here on in, the job is to communicate effectively with people; first, to get them out to vote, then to vote for me.” Gordon and his handlers be¬ lieve “Dear Friend” cards, in which the candidate’s major char¬ acteristics and goals are spelled out and the card is sent with a fa¬ miliar signature to a good friend, will advance major positive feel¬ ing among the voters. A reprint of these cards has al¬ ready been ordered, and more will be ordered as their need increas¬ es. But direct mail campaigns are costly, and Gordon makes it clear that expenses so far have been de¬ voted to printing and postage, both of which will require more funding before April 8. Planner and implementor Asked whether he had experi¬ enced any homophobia so far in the campaign, Gordon told the B.A.R. that only one other candi¬ date has even mentioned that Gordon is gay, and then said noth¬ ing critical about his sexual orien¬ tation. The candidate believes that San Mateo County is relatively free of homophobic action. As for Gordon’s personal quali¬ ties as an activist in the public arena, he disputes principal oppo¬ nent Denise de Ville’s suggestion that the choice is between herself as a “planner” and himself as an “im¬ plementor.” He considers himself both, and said his style is to get into the action and accomplish a goal. “Instead of just thinking of something, I accomplish it,” he says. “To promote better health, I set up the Youth Health Center and saw to it that there was AIDS test¬ ing included in the program. In¬ stead of just wondering what to do about promoting'welfare and wor¬ rying about where money is going to come from, I organized the Cafe Mime, where people formerly on welfare learn new marketable skills and to support themselves.” ▼ Admission to the San Francisco rally, at the home of Jean-Pau!

Legion by Shan Schwartz S an Francisco’s Alexander Hamilton Post of the Amer¬ ican Legion, the nation’s only post to welcome openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender veterans, has increased the pres¬ sure in its discrimination lawsuit, and the San Francisco War Memorial Board of Trustees is now poised to adopt a series of resolutions renouncing discrimi¬ nation against sexual orientation. The post’s lawsuit, filed last fall against the American Legion’s Cal¬ ifornia Department, claims that the post has been subject to dis¬ crimination under several guises: by the California Legion’s refusal to publish material submitted by the post in state publications; its refusal to provide adequate office space in the War Memorial Build¬ ing; and further exemplified by anti-gay remarks and anti-gay ma¬ terials on display in the Legion’s state headquarters office, also in the War Memorial Building. On February 12, the post filed a motion to amend its complaint by adding as defendants the San Francisco War Memorial Board of Trustees, who supervise the city- owned building. The motion also adds a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organi¬ zations Act against several Legion officials, who allegedly defrauded the Hamilton Post of membership fees and illegally pocketed other money from within the Legion. Sean Kennedy, a lawyer for the Hamilton Post, told the B.A.R. that the lawsuit is still primarily a discrimination case, but the new alleged RICO violations indicate that many in the Legion leader¬ ship “behave with impunity” and disregard for the law. The RICO violations allege that the Legion’s state department placed veterans’ applications into a phony Legion post (a “paper post”) to store the money and keep from having to refer mem¬ berships to the Hamilton Post. Furthermore, the RICO allega¬ tions say, the Legion officials pocketed cash raised during fundraising efforts and drew money out of various funds and accounts (including the phony “paper post”). Gay vets' long fight The ongoing lawsuit is only the current chapter of a long and ar¬ duous battle for the Hamilton Post, which couldn’t even get its charter from the Legion until it threatened a lawsuit. A previous lawsuit, which was filed in 1987 and settled in 1988, failed to change the discriminatory behav¬ ior, Kennedy said. “The only time they seem to behave is when there’s a lawsuit in the works,” Kennedy said. And now that the War Memo¬ rial Board of Trustees has been added as a defendant in the case, it seems the Board is showing signs of behaving as well, with new res¬ olutions passed just last week at a meeting of the Board’s Veterans Committee. The resolutions contain sever¬ al recommendations, including that the board should require the California American Legion to adopt written statements agreeing to conform with the city’s non¬ discrimination code; that the Cal¬ ifornia American Legion take af¬ firmative steps such as sensitivity training to discourage and pre¬ vent further discrimination; and recommended procedures for the board in handling future discrim¬ ination complaints. Coming less than a month after the board was named a de¬ fendant in the post’s lawsuit, Hamilton Post members say the resolutions are merely a “cover- your-ass” reaction and are too lit¬ tle, too late as far as the lawsuit is concerned. The Board of Trustees will meet at 2 p.m. this Thursday, March 13, to consider the Veterans Commit¬ tee’s resolutions. Arch Wilson, a World War II veteran and member of the Hamilton Post, said he ex¬ pects the board to accept the rec¬ ommendation of the committee. “But it’s just something quite hollow,” Wilson said. “It will look as if it did something, but it really doesn’t do anything.” “It’s just not going to be very satisfactory. It doesn’t address our past grievances, which is what we’re suing for. It only addresses future grievances.” Old boys Cliff Anchor, a previous com¬ mander of the Hamilton Post, said even though the Legion is still dominated by an “old boys’ club,” he thought the City Board of Trustees would also ultimately do Double Rainbow and Ultimate Yogurt & More... decide that two great tastes belong in one place!

And any group who discrim¬ inates should not be allowed to oc¬ cupy a public building such as that.” Anchor said he felt the post has a very strong case, and he is optimistic that the current lawsuit will finally bring justice to the post. He said the changing tide of public opinion, more sensitive to anti-gay discrimination, is strong even through much of the Amer¬ ican Legion. “We’ve had some very conser¬ vative posts express support for us, which just goes to show that you don’t have to be a bigot to be a conservative,” he said. Anchor even has hope for the lawsuit’s effect on the Legion’s state organization. “If the Legion survives this, and it will, it will emerge as a bet¬ ter organization, more democrat¬ ically operated, and with less of the hanky-panky that has gone on in the past.” T SF forums on by Claudia Figueroa O ver the past few years, AIDS service organizations, health educators, activists, public policy advocates, and med¬ ical professionals have expressed increasing concern over the legal rights of prisoners with HIV/AIDS. Their primary con¬ cern is that many - or most - fa¬ cilities are negligent of those who carry the virus, when the combi¬ nation of the infection, poor med¬ ical treatment, a callous prison administration, and the day-to- day life in prison has the potential to make a short prison term a death sentence. They also feel that too few prisons offer protease in¬ hibitors and other life-extending drugs to prisoners with AIDS. HIV Behind Bars will be ad¬ dressing these issues in a two-part forum and intensive workshop starting this Tuesday, March 18, and continuing on March 19. The events are jointly sponsored by the HIV/AIDS in Prison Project of Catholic Charities of the East Bay and the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention, with additional sponsorship from AIDS Legal Re¬ ferral Panel and Correctional HIV Consortium. AIDS activist and prisoner ad¬ vocate Judy Greenspan, project di¬ rector at the HIV/AIDS in Prison Project, explained to the Bay Area Reporter the reasons for her orga¬ nization’s dedication to this issue. “Most prisoners with HIV and AIDS have a history of injection HIV in prison drug or alcohol addiction,” she said. “The majority of these men and women are in prison for non¬ violent crimes. Prison is no place for anyone who is HIV-positive. Prisoners are heroically battling the epidemic in their own way by forming peer education pro¬ grams, and speaking out. They need our support.” The forum held on Wednes¬ day, entitled “Fighting for their Lives - HIV Prevention and Edu¬ cation Behind the Walls,” will be free of charge to those who want to address the community’s role in supporting HIV peer education and prevention programs inside U.S. and Canadian prisons. Top¬ ics will include efforts by the Women’s Positive Legal Action Network (Women’s PLAN) to provide legal support and advoca¬ cy for women prisoners with HIV/AIDS, plus programs cur¬ rently taking place from San Quentin, California to Bedford Hills, New York. Scheduled speakers include Aida Rivera, founder of ACE, a HIV program at Bedford Hills Women’s Prison; Cochise Robin- son-El, founder of Blind Faith, a Washington, DC organization of former prisoners; Ralf Jurgens, au¬ thor of Canada’s HIV/AIDS in Pris¬ ons Final Report ; and Jackie Walker, AIDS Information Coordinator, ACLU National Prison Project. ▼ For more information, contact the HIV/AIDS Prison Project at (510) 834-5656, ext. 3150.

Looking at houses can become overwhelming for many prospective buyers. They start to run together, and you have trouble remembering which homes you liked a lot and which ones you didn’t. Realtors use a few good tricks that can help you remember what you have seen. You will usually be given a copy of the listing with all the pertinent information. Write down one distinctive feature on the listing sheet that will help you remember the house. Maybe the house had unusual moldings in the dining room, a red door, or unusual wallpaper. If the house was particularly interest¬ ing to you, put a big star on top of the page to remind yourself that you would like to see it again or even perhaps make an offer on it. If there are features for which you have a strong preference, or you eliminate a house from consideration for any reason, be sure to tell the agent why. Communication between you and your Realtor will save you a lot of time and effort because you will only be shown the homes that meet your particular needs.
