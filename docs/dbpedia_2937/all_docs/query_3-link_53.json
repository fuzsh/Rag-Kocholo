        "text": "And others came also and entreated him. But he answered them not. He only bent his head; and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast.\n\nAnd he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple.\n\nAnd there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra.\n\nAnd she was a seeress.\n\nAnd he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city.\n\nAnd she hailed him, saying:\n\nProphet of God, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the\n\ndistances for your ship.\n\nAnd now your ship has come, and you must needs go.\n\nDeep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place\n\nof your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold\n\nyou.\n\nYet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your\n\ntruth.\n\nAnd we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it\n\nshall not perish.\n\nIn your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep.\n\nNow therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown\n\nyou of that which is between birth and death.\n\nAnd he answered,\n\nPeople of Orphalese, of what can I speak save of that which is even now moving within your souls?\n\nLove\n\nThen said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.\n\nAnd he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness\n\nupon them. And with a great voice he said:\n\nWhen love beckons to you, follow him,\n\nThough his ways are hard and steep.\n\nAnd when his wings enfold you yield to him,\n\nThough the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.\n\nAnd when he speaks to you believe in him,\n\nThough his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.\n\nFor even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.\n\nEven as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.\n\nEven as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,\n\nSo shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the\n\nearth.\n\nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts,\n\nFor they have their own thoughts.\n\nYou may house their bodies but not their souls,\n\nFor their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not\n\neven in your dreams.\n\nYou may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.\n\nFor life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.\n\nYou are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent\n\nforth.\n\nThe archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.\n\nLet your bending in the Archer’s hand be for gladness;\n\nFor even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is\n\nstable.\n\nGiving\n\nThen said a rich man,\n\nSpeak to us of Giving.\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nYou give but little when you give of your possessions.\n\nIt is when you give of yourself that you truly give.\n\nFor what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?\n\nAnd tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?\n\nAnd what is fear of need but need itself?\n\nIs not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?\n\nThere are those who give little of the much which they have--and they give\n\nit for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.\n\nAnd there are those who have little and give it all.\n\nThese are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is\n\nnever empty.\n\nThere are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.\n\nAnd there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.\n\nAnd there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek\n\njoy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;\n\nThey give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.\n\nThrough the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.\n\nIt is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through\n\nunderstanding;\n\nAnd to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater\n\nthan giving.\n\nAnd is there aught you would withhold?\n\nAll you have shall some day be given;\n\nTherefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your\n\ninheritors’.\n\nYou often say, “I would give, but only to the deserving.”\n\nThe trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.\n\nThey give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.\n\nSurely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of all\n\nelse from you.\n\nAnd he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his\n\ncup from your little stream.\n\nAnd what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage\n\nand the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?\n\nAnd who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride,\n\nthat you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?\n\nSee first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.\n\nFor in truth it is life that gives unto life--while you, who deem yourself a\n\ngiver, are but a witness.\n\nAnd you receivers--and you are all receivers--assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.\n\nRather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;\n\nFor to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the\n\nfreehearted earth for mother, and God for father.\n\nSome of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”\n\nBut I say unto you, they are inseparable.\n\nTogether they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.\n\nVerily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.\n\nOnly when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.\n\nWhen the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs\n\nmust your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.\n\nHouses\n\nThen a mason came forth and said, Speak to us of Houses.\n\nAnd he answered and said:\n\nBuild of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls.\n\nFor even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in\n\nyou, the ever distant and alone.\n\nYour house is your larger body.\n\nIt grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? and dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?\n\nWould that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow.\n\nWould the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.\n\nBut these things are not yet to be.\n\nIn their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear\n\nshall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separate\n\nyour hearths from your fields.\n\nAy, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.\n\nThough its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.\n\nIt lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the\n\nflesh.\n\nIt makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.\n\nVerily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks\n\ngrinning in the funeral.\n\nBut you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor\n\ntamed.\n\nYour house shall be not an anchor but a mast.\n\nIt shall not be a glistening film that covers a wound, but an eyelid that\n\nguards the eye.\n\nYou shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down.\n\nYou shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.\n\nAnd though of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold\n\nyour secret nor shelter your longing.\n\nFor that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose\n\ndoor is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night.\n\nClothes\n\nAnd the weaver said, Speak to us of Clothes.\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nYour clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.\n\nAnd though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.\n\nWould that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,\n\nFor the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the\n\nwind.\n\nSome of you say, “It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear.”\n\nAnd I say, Ay, it was the north wind,\n\nBut shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.\n\nAnd when his work was done he laughed in the forest. Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.\n\nAnd when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?\n\nAnd forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds\n\nlong to play with your hair.\n\nBuying and Selling\n\nAnd a merchant said, Speak to us of Buying and Selling.\n\nAnd he answered and said:\n\nTo you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.\n\nIt is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and\n\nbe satisfied.\n\nYet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice, it will but lead some to\n\ngreed and others to hunger.\n\nWhen in the market place you toilers of the sea and fields and vineyards meet the weavers and the potters and the gatherers of spices,\n\nInvoke then the master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst and sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value.\n\nAnd suffer not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.\n\nTo such men you should say,\n\n“Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your\n\nnet;\n\nFor the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us.”\n\nAnd if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute players, buy of their gifts also.\n\nFor they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.\n\nAnd before you leave the market place, see that no one has gone his way with empty hands.\n\nFor the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind\n\ntill the needs of the least of you are satisfied.\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nThen one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, Speak to us of\n\nCrime and Punishment.\n\nAnd he answered, saying:\n\nIt is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,\n\nThat you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.\n\nAnd for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.\n\nLike the ocean is your god-self;\n\nIt remains for ever undefiled.\n\nAnd like the ether it lifts but the winged.\n\nEven like the sun is your god-self;\n\nIt knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.\n\nBut your god-self dwells not alone in your being.\n\nMuch in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,\n\nBut a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own\n\nawakening.\n\nAnd of the man in you would I now speak.\n\nFor it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime and the punishment of crime.\n\nOftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.\n\nBut I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,\n\nSo the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.\n\nAnd as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the\n\nwhole tree,\n\nSo the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\n\nLike a procession you walk together towards your god-self.\n\nYou are the way and the wayfarers.\n\nAnd when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.\n\nAy, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.\n\nAnd this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:\n\nThe murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,\n\nAnd the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.\n\nThe righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,\n\nAnd the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.\n\nYea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,\n\nAnd still more often the condemned is the burden bearer for the guiltless\n\nand unblamed.\n\nYou cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked;\n\nFor they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together.\n\nAnd when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.\n\nAnd how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their\n\nmisdeeds?\n\nIs not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you\n\nwould fain serve?\n\nYet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of\n\nthe guilty.\n\nUnbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon\n\nthemselves. And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless\n\nyou look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?\n\nOnly then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day of his god-self,\n\nAnd that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.\n\nLaws\n\nThen a lawyer said, But what of our Laws, master?\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nYou delight in laying down laws,\n\nYet you delight more in breaking them.\n\nLike children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.\n\nBut while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,\n\nAnd when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.\n\nVerily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.\n\nBut what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not\n\nsand-towers,\n\nBut to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?\n\nWhat of the cripple who hates dancers?\n\nWhat of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest\n\nstray and vagrant things?\n\nWhat of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?\n\nAnd of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and\n\ntired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters\n\nlawbreakers?\n\nI would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.\n\nSurely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more\n\nmindful of one loses the love and the faith of both\n\nAmong the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows--then let your heart say in silence, “God rests in reason.”\n\nAnd when the storm comes, and the mighty wind shakes the forest, and thunder and lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky,--then let your heart\n\nsay in awe, “God moves in passion.”\n\nAnd since you are a breath in God’s sphere, and a leaf in God’s forest, you\n\ntoo should rest in reason and move in passion.\n\nPain\n\nAnd a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain.\n\nAnd he said:\n\nYour pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.\n\nEven as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the\n\nsun, so must you know pain.\n\nAnd could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;\n\nAnd you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.\n\nAnd you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.\n\nMuch of your pain is self-chosen.\n\nIt is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick\n\nself.\n\nTherefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:\n\nFor his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,\n\nAnd the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the\n\nclay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.\n\nSelf-Knowledge\n\nAnd a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge.\n\nAnd he answered, saying:\n\nYour hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.\n\nBut your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.\n\nYou would know in words that which you have always known in thought.\n\nYou would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.\n\nAnd it is well you should.\n\nThe hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;\n\nAnd the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.\n\nBut let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;\n\nAnd seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.\n\nFor self is a sea boundless and measureless.\n\nSay not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.”\n\nSay not, “I have found the path of the soul.” Say rather, “I have met the soul\n\nwalking upon my path.”\n\nFor the soul walks upon all paths.\n\nThe soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.\n\nThe soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.\n\nTeaching\n\nThen said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching.\n\nAnd he said:\n\n“No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.\n\nThe teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness.\n\nIf he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but\n\nrather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.\n\nThe astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding.\n\nThe musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he\n\ncannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.\n\nAnd he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.\n\nFor the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.\n\nAnd even as each one of you stands alone in God’s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth.\n\nFriendship\n\nAnd a youth said, Speak to us of Friendship.\n\nAnd he answered, saying:\n\nYour friend is your needs answered.\n\nHe is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.\n\nAnd he is your board and your fireside.\n\nFor you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.\n\nWhen your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”\n\nAnd when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;\n\nFor without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations\n\nare born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.\n\nWhen you part from your friend, you grieve not;\n\nFor that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the\n\nmountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.\n\nAnd let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening\n\nof the spirit.\n\nFor love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.\n\nBut if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season\n\nencircle all the other seasons,\n\nAnd let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing.\n\nGood and Evil\n\nAnd one of the elders of the city said, Speak to us of Good and Evil.\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nOf the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.\n\nFor what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?\n\nVerily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.\n\nYou are good when you are one with yourself.\n\nYet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.\n\nFor a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.\n\nAnd a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.\n\nYou are good when you strive to give of yourself.\n\nYet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.\n\nFor when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and\n\nsucks at her breast.\n\nSurely the fruit cannot say to the root, “Be like me, ripe and full and ever\n\ngiving of your abundance.”\n\nFor to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.\n\nYou are good when you are fully awake in your speech,\n\nYet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without\n\npurpose.\n\nAnd even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.\n\nYou are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.\n\nYet you are not evil when you go thither limping. Even those who limp go not backward.\n\nBut you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the lame,\n\ndeeming it kindness.\n\nYou are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good,\n\nYou are only loitering and sluggard.\n\nPity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.\n\nIn your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in\n\nall of you.\n\nBut in some of you, that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea,\n\ncarrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest.\n\nAnd in others, it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and\n\nlingers before it reaches the shore.\n\nBut let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, “Wherefore are\n\nyou slow and halting?”\n\nFor the truly good ask not the naked, “Where is your garment?” nor the\n\nhouseless, “What has befallen your house?”\n\nPrayer\n\nThen a priestess said, Speak to us of Prayer.\n\nAnd he answered, saying:\n\nYou pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also\n\nin the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.\n\nFor what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether?\n\nAnd if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also for\n\nyour delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart.\n\nAnd if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she should spur you again and yet again, though weeping, until you shall come laughing.\n\nWhen you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour, and whom, save in prayer, you may not meet.\n\nTherefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy and\n\nsweet communion.\n\nFor if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive:\n\nAnd if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted:\n\nOr even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you shall not\n\nbe heard.\n\nIt is enough that you enter the temple invisible.\n\nI cannot teach you how to pray in words.\n\nGod listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips.\n\nAnd I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas and the forests and the mountains.\n\nBut you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find their prayer in your heart,\n\nAnd if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying\n\nin silence,\n\n“Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.\n\nIt is thy desire in us that desireth.\n\nIt is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days which are thine also.\n\nWe cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:\n\nThou art our need; and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.”\n\nPleasure\n\nThen a hermit, who visited the city once a year, came forth and said, Speak\n\nto us of Pleasure.\n\nAnd he answered, saying:\n\nPleasure is a freedom-song,\n\nBut it is not freedom.\n\nIt is the blossoming of your desires,\n\nBut it is not their fruit.\n\nIt is a depth calling unto a height,\n\nBut it is not the deep nor the high.\n\nIt is the caged taking wing,\n\nBut it is not space encompassed.\n\nAy, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.\n\nAnd I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet I would not have\n\nyou lose your hearts in the singing.\n\nSome of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and\n\nrebuked. I would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have them seek.\n\nFor they shall find pleasure, but not her alone;\n\nSeven are her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.\n\nHave you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots and found a treasure?\n\nAnd now you ask in your heart, “How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?”\n\nGo to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,\n\nBut it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee.\n\nFor to the bee, a flower is a fountain of life,\n\nAnd to the flower, a bee is a messenger of love,\n\nAnd to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.\n\nPeople of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.\n\nBeauty\n\nAnd a poet said, Speak to us of Beauty.\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nWhere shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?\n\nAnd how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?\n\nThe aggrieved and the injured say, “Beauty is kind and gentle.\n\nLike a young mother half-shy of her own glory, she walks among us.”\n\nAnd the passionate say, “Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.\n\nLike the tempest, she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us.”\n\nThe tired and the weary say, “Beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit. Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”\n\nBut the restless say, “We have heard her shouting among the mountains,\n\nAnd with her cries came the sound of hoofs, and the beating of wings and\n\nthe roaring of lions.”\n\nAt night the watchmen of the city say, “Beauty shall rise with the dawn from\n\nthe east.”\n\nAnd at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say, “We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset.”\n\nBrief were my days among you, and briefer still the words I have spoken.\n\nBut should my voice fade in your ears, and my love vanish in your memory, then I will come again,\n\nAnd with a richer heart and lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak.\n\nYea, I shall return with the tide,\n\nAnd though death may hide me, and the greater silence enfold me, yet again will I seek your understanding.\n\nAnd not in vain will I seek.\n\nIf aught I have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer\n\nvoice, and in words more kin to your thoughts.\n\nI go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness;\n\nAnd if this day is not a fulfilment of your needs and my love, then let it\n\nbe a promise till another day.\n\nMan’s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love should\n\nsatisfy his needs.\n\nKnow, therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.\n\nThe mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain.\n\nAnd not unlike the mist have I been.\n\nIn the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, and my spirit has entered your houses,\n\nAnd your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face, and I knew you all.\n\nAy, I knew your joy and your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my\n\ndreams.\n\nAnd oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains.\n\nI mirrored the summits in you and the bending slopes, and even the\n\npassing flocks of your thoughts and your desires.\n\nAnd to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams and the longing of your youths in rivers.\n\nAnd when they reached my depth the streams and the rivers ceased not yet to sing.\n\nBut sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me.\n\nIt was the boundless in you;\n\nThe vast man in whom you are all but cells and sinews;\n\nHe in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing.\n\nIt is in the vast man that you are vast,\n\nAnd in beholding him that I beheld you and loved you.\n\nFor what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?\n\nWhat visions, what expectations and what presumptions can outsoar that flight?\n\nLike a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you. His\n\nmight binds you to the earth, his fragrance lifts you into space, and in his durability you are deathless.\n\nYou have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest\n\nlink.\n\nThis is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link.\n\nTo measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of the ocean by the frailty of its foam.\n\nTo judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their\n\ninconstancy.\n\nAy, you are like an ocean,\n\nAnd though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.\n\nAnd like the seasons you are also,\n\nAnd though in your winter you deny your spring,\n\nYet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness and is not offended.\n\nThink not I say these things in order that you may say the one to the other, “He praised us well. He saw but the good in us.”\n\nI only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.\n\nAnd what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?\n\nYour thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,\n\nAnd of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself,\n\nAnd of nights when the earth was up-wrought with confusion.\n\nWise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom. I came to take of your wisdom:\n\nAnd behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom.\n\nIt is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself,\n\nWhile you, heedless of its expansion, bewail the withering of your days.\n\nIt is life in quest of life in bodies that fear the grave.\n\nThis would I have you remember in remembering me:\n\nThat which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and\n\nmost determined.\n\nIs it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your\n\nbones?\n\nAnd is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city and fashioned all there is in it?\n\nCould you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else,\n\nAnd if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.\n\nBut you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.\n\nThe veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it,\n\nAnd the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it. And you shall see.\n\nAnd you shall hear.\n\nYet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.\n\nFor in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,\n\nAnd you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.\n\nAfter saying these things he looked about him, and he saw the pilot of his\n\nship standing by the helm and gazing now at the full sails and now at the\n\ndistance.\n\nAnd he said:\n\nPatient, over patient, is the captain of my ship.\n\nThe wind blows, and restless are the sails;\n\nEven the rudder begs direction;\n\nYet quietly my captain awaits my silence.\n\nAnd these my mariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they too have heard me patiently. Now they shall wait no longer.\n\nI am ready.\n\nThe stream has reached the sea, and once more the great mother holds her son against her breast."
