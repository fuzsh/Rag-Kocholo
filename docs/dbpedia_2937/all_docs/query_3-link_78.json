        "text": "1h 16min | Drama | 14 March 1997 (USA)\n\nStoryline:\n\nPhillip and Dieter nearly suffocate hiding their sexual identity in the face of puritanical small town values. Joined by a mysterious German relative, the three misfits escape to the big city searching for a place to belong.\n\nUser review:\n\nThis film is about 3 young men of German descent growing up in the mid West of America.\n\nThe striking feature about this film is that it is in black and white. It gives the film more of a “lonely” and “despair” feeling. The prominent use of the German language reminds viewers their heritage, which is a fact that is highlighted many times in the film. It must have been very difficult for these youngsters to live in a village, as they are minority in both their heritage and their sexual orientation. It is also interesting to see the transition of Dieter from a homophobic figure (in denial of himself) to a rentboy for gay men. How his morality spirals down is thought provoking. It is worth a watch if you have nothing to do, but don’t expect it to be too entertaining."
