        "text": "by Mark Rabinowitz\n\nPicture This! Entertainment has launched Picture This! Home Video, a\n\nhome video distributor for gay and lesbian-themed titles. The new\n\ncompany’s first three titles, set to be released this fall, are “No\n\nOrdinary Love,” written and directed by company president Doug Witkins;\n\nPeter S. Reed’s “Under Heat,” and Ronnie Larsen’s “Shooting Porn,” which\n\nis based on Larsen’s Off Broadway comedy. Picture This! Entertainment\n\nwas created in 1996 by Witkins as an offshoot of his foreign sales\n\ncompany, Amazing Movies, and has distributed such films as Carl\n\nWorkman’s “Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol“; “Bar Girls,”\n\ndirected by Marita Giovanni and written by Lauran Hoffman from her own\n\nplay; Jeff B. Harmon’s “Isle of Lesbos,” and Keith Froelich’s “Toilers\n\nand the Wayfarers.”\n\nPicture This! Home Video has also formed an alliance with domestic\n\ndistributor, Jour de Fete Films (“Leather Jacket Love Story,” “Broadway\n\nDamage“), to co-release new gay and lesbian-themed films. Jour de Fete\n\nwill release the films domestically, while Picture This! Home Video will\n\nrelease the films on video. The logos on each film’s advertising\n\nmaterial will reflect this alliance. Picture This! Home Video plans to\n\nrelease three films every quarter, by the end of the first year of\n\noperation, and according to a company release, they will “be working\n\nclosely with lesbian and gay film festivals and media in an effort to\n\nmeet the need of gay and lesbian viewers.”\n\nIn order to make sure that the new company gets off to the right start,\n\nWitkins has hired Orly Ravid as Acquisitions Manager of the new company.\n\nRavid was previously a programmer at both the New York Lesbian and Gay\n\nFilm Festival and OUTFEST in Los Angeles and was also in development at\n\nSchindler-Swerdlow Productions in New York. In addition, veteran\n\ndistributor John Tilley (co-founder of Cinevista Video) has signed on as\n\nexecutive consultant. Tilley was involved in the distribution of films\n\nsuch as David Lynch’s “Eraserhead,” Derek Jarman’s “Sebastiane” and\n\nJean-Charles Tacchella’s “Cousin, Cousine.”\n\nIn addition to Picture This! Home Video, Amazing Movies recently added\n\nanother subsidiary, when Highland Crest Pictures was launched at the\n\n1998 Cannes Film Festival. This foreign sales company is aimed at\n\nhandling films that are “up-cast, up-budget family pictures,” according\n\nto an ad in the recently published Daily Variety special issue, The\n\nIndependents.” Highland Crest’s first international release will be Adam\n\nBernstein’s “Six Ways To Sunday,” which will be released in the United\n\nStates by Stratosphere Entertainment. Other Highland Crest films include\n\n“The Second Jungle Book,” and “The Littles at Large.”"
