A master storyteller, Thor Hanson has created a first-rate natural history. You will never look at seeds in the same way.” —ERIC JAY DOLIN, author of Leviathan “ The Triumph of Seeds is more than an engrossing work of natural history. It’s a compelling and highly entertaining journey, populated by scientists and historians, criminals and explorers, aviators and futurists.

Nothing is more crucial to the survival and independence of organisms — be they elephants or protozoa — than the maintenance of a constant internal en- vironment. Claude Bernard, the great French physiologist, said everything on this matter when, in the 1850s, he wrote, “Lafixite du milieu interieur est la con- dition de la vie libreT Maintaining such constancy is called homeostasis. The basics of homeostasis are relatively simple but miraculously efficient at the cellular level, where ion pumps in cell membranes allow the chemical interior of cells to remain constant, what- ever the vicissitudes of the external environment. More complex monitor- ing systems are demanded when it comes to ensuring homeostasis in multicellu- lar organisms — animals, and human beings, in particular. Homeostatic regula- tion is accomplished by the development of spe- cial nerve cells and nerve nets (plexuses) scattered throughout our bodies, as well as by direct chemical means (hormones, etc.). These scattered nerve cells and plexuses become orga- nized into a system or con- federation that is largely autonomous in its func- tioning; hence its name, the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS was only recognized and explored in the early part of the twenti- eth century, whereas many of the functions of the central nervous system (CNS), especially the brain, had already been mapped in detail in the nineteenth century. This is something of a paradox, for the autonomic ner- vous system evolved long before the central nervous system. They were (and to a considerable ex- tent still are) independent evolutions, extremely different in organization, as well as formation. Central nervous systems, along with muscles and sense organs, evolved to allow animals to get around in the world — forage, hunt, seek mates, avoid or fight enemies, etc. The central nervous system, with its sense organs (including those in the joints, the muscles, the movable parts of the body), tells one who one is and what one is doing. The autonomic ner- vous system, sleeplessly monitoring every organ and tissue in the body, tells one how one is. Curiously, the brain it- self has no sense organs, which is why one can have gross disorders here, yet feel no malaise. Thus Ralph Waldo Emerson, who developed Alzheimer’s disease in his sixties, would say, “I have lost my mental faculties but am per- fectly well.” By the early twentieth century, two general divisions of the autonomic ner- vous system were recognized: a “sym- pathetic” part, which, by increasing the heart’s output, sharpening the senses, and tensing the muscles, readies an an- imal for action (in extreme situations, for instance, life-saving fight or flight); and the corresponding opposite — a “parasympathetic” part — which in- creases activity in the “housekeeping” parts of the body (gut, kidneys, liver, etc.), slowing the heart and promoting relaxation and sleep. These two por- tions of the ANS work, normally, in a happy reciprocity; thus the delicious postprandial somnolence that follows a heavy meal is not the time to run a race or get into a fight. When the two parts of the ANS are working harmo- niously together, one feels “well,” or “normal.” No one has written more eloquently about this than Antonio Damasio in AA^hen I came to New York, nearly fifty years ago, the first patients I saw suffered from attacks of migraine — “common migraine,” so called because it attacks at least 10 percent of the pop- ulation. (I myself have had attacks of them throughout my life.^) Seeing such patients, trying to understand or help them, constituted my apprenticeship in medicine — and led to my first book. Migraine. Though there are many (one is tempted to say, innumerable) possible presentations of common migraine — I described nearly a hundred such in my book — its commonest harbinger may be just an indefinable but undeniable feeling of something amiss. This is ex- actly what Emil du Bois-Reymond em- phasized when, in 1860, he described his own attacks of migraine: “I wake,” Newcastle Beach, New South Wales, Australia, 2000; photograph by Trent Parke his book The Feeling of What Happens and many subsequent books and pa- pers. He speaks of a “core conscious- ness,” the basic feeling of how one is, which eventually becomes a dim, im- plicit feeling of consciousness.^ It is es- pecially when things are going wrong, internally — when homeostasis is not being maintained; when the autonomic balance starts listing heavily to one side or the other — that this core conscious- ness, the feeling of how one is, takes on an intrusive, unpleasant quality, and now one will say, “I feel ill — something is amiss.” At such times one no longer looks well either. As an example of this, migraine is a sort of prototype illness, often very unpleasant but transient, and self-limiting; benign in the sense that it does not cause death or serious injury and that it is not associated with any tis- sue damage or trauma or infection; and occurring only as an often-hereditary disturbance of the nervous system. Migraine provides, in miniature, the essential features of being ill — of trou- ble inside the body — without actual illness. he writes, “with a general feeling of disorder ” In his case (he had had migraines every three to four weeks, since his twentieth year), there would be “a slight pain in the region of the right temple which . . . reaches its greatest intensity at midday; towards evening it usually passes off At rest the pain is bearable, but it is increased by mo- tion to a high degree of violence It responds to each beat of the temporal artery.” Moreover, du Bois-Reymond looked different during his migraines: “The countenance is pale and sunken, the right eye small and reddened.” During violent attacks he would expe- rience nausea and “gastric disorder.” The “general feeling of disorder” that so often inaugurates migraines may continue, getting more and more severe in the course of an attack; the worst- affected patients may be reduced to lying in a leaden haze, feeling half-dead, or even that death would be preferable.^ ^Antonio Damasio and Gil B. Car- valho, “The Nature of Feelings: Evolu- tionary and Neurobiological Origins,” Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Vol. 14 (February 2013). ^I also have attacks of “migraine aura,” with scintillating zigzag patterns and other visual phenomena. They, for me, have no obvious relation to my “com- mon” migraines, but for many others the two are linked, this hybrid attack being called a “classical” migraine. ^Aretaeus noted in the second century that patients in such a state “are weary of I cite du Bois-Reymond’s self- description, as I do at the very begin- ning of Migraine, partly for its preci- sion and beauty (as are common in nineteenth-century neurological de- scriptions, but rare now), but above all, because it is exemplary — all cases of migraine vary, but they are, so to speak, permutations of his. The vascular and visceral symptoms of migraine are typical of unbridled parasympathetic activity, but they may be preceded by a physiologically opposite state. One may feel full of energy, even a sort of euphoria, for a few hours before a migraine — George Eliot would speak of herself as feel- ing “dangerously well” at such times. There may, similarly, especially if the suffering has been very intense, be a “rebound” after a migraine. This was very clear with one of my patients (Case #68 in Migraine), a young math- I ematician with very severe |) migraines. For him the resolution of a migraine, accompanied by a huge passage of pale urine, was always followed by a burst of original mathe- matical thinking. “Curing” his migraines, we found, “cured” his mathematical creativity, and he elected, given this strange econ- omy of body and mind, to keep both. While this is the gen- eral pattern of a mi- graine, there can occur rapidly changing fluctu- ations and contradictory symptoms — a feeling that patients often call “un- settled.” In this unset- tled state (I wrote in Migraine), “one may feel hot or cold, or both . . . bloated and tight, or loose and queasy; a peculiar tension, or languor, or both . . . sundry strains and discom- forts, which come and go.” Indeed, everything comes and goes, and if one could take a scan or inner photograph of the body at such times, one would see vascular beds opening and closing, peristalsis accelerating or stopping, viscera squirming or tight- ening in spasms, secretions suddenly increasing or decreasing — as if the nervous system itself were in a state of indecision. Instability, fluctuation, and oscillation are of the essence in the unsettled state, this general feeling of disorder. We lose the normal feeling of “wellness,” which all of us, and perhaps all animals, have in health. 2 . If new thoughts about illness and re- covery — or old thoughts in new form — have been stimulated by thinking back to my first patients, they have been given an unexpected salience by a very life and wish to die.” Such feelings, while they may originate, and be corre- lated with, autonomic imbalance, must connect with those “central” parts of the ANS in which feeling, mood, sentience, and (core) consciousness are mediated — the brainstem, hypothalamus, amyg- dala, and other subcortical structures. 4 The New York Review '^COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESS The Age of Sustainable Development JEFFREY D.

On Monday, February 16, 1 could say I felt well, in my usual state of health — at least such health and energy as a fairly active eighty- one -year- old can hope to enjoy — and this despite learn- ing, a month earlier, that much of my liver was occupied by metastatic cancer. Various palliative treatments had been suggested — treatments that might re- duce the load of metastases in my liver and permit a few extra months of life. The one I opted for, decided to try first, involved my surgeon, an interventional radiologist, threading a catheter up to the bifurcation of the hepatic artery, and then injecting a mass of tiny beads into the right hepatic artery, where they would be carried to the smallest arterioles, blocking these, cutting off the blood supply and oxygen needed by the metastases — in effect, starving and asphyxiating them to death. (My surgeon, who has a gift for vivid meta- phor, compared this to killing rats in the basement; or, in a pleasanter image, mowing down the dandelions on the back lawn.) If such an embolization proved to be effective, and tolerated, it could be done on the other side of the liver (the dandelions on the front lawn) a month or so later. The procedure, though relatively benign, would lead to the death of a huge mass of melanoma cells (almost 50 percent of my liver had been occu- pied by metastases). These, in dying, would give off a variety of unpleasant and pain-producing substances, and would then have to be removed, as all dead material must be removed from the body. This immense task of gar- bage disposal would be undertaken by cells of the immune system — mac- rophages — that are specialized to en- gulf alien or dead matter in the body. I might think of them, my surgeon suggested, as tiny spiders, millions or perhaps billions in number, scurrying inside me, engulfing the melanoma de- bris. This enormous cellular task would sap all my energy, and I would feel, in consequence, a tiredness beyond any- thing I had ever felt before, to say noth- ing of pain and other problems. I am glad I was forewarned, for the following day (Tuesday, the seven- teenth), soon after waking from the embolization — it was performed under general anesthesia — I was to be as- sailed by feelings of excruciating tired- ness and paroxysms of sleep so abrupt they could poleaxe me in the middle of a sentence or a mouthful, or when visiting friends were talking or laugh- ing loudly a yard away from me. Some- times, too, delirium would seize me within seconds, even in the middle of handwriting. I felt extremely weak and inert — I would sometimes sit motion- less until hoisted to my feet and walked by two helpers. While pain seemed tolerable at rest, an involuntary move- ment such as a sneeze or hiccup would produce an explosion, a sort of nega- tive orgasm of pain, despite my being maintained, like all post-embolization patients, on a continuous intravenous infusion of narcotics. This massive infusion of narcotics halted all bowel activity for nearly a week, so that ev- erything I ate — I had no appetite, but had to “take nourishment,” as the nurs- ing staff put it — was retained inside me. Another problem — not uncommon after the embolization of a large part of the liver — was a release of ADH, anti- diuretic hormone, which caused an enormous accumulation of fluid in my body. My feet became so swollen they were almost unrecognizable as feet, and I developed a thick tire of edema around my trunk. This “hyperhydra- tion” led to lowered levels of sodium in my blood, which probably contributed to my deliria. With all this, and a va- riety of other symptoms — temperature regulation was unstable, I would be hot one minute, cold the next — I felt awful. I had “a general feeling of disorder” raised to an almost infinite degree. If I had to feel like this from now on, I kept thinking, I would sooner be dead. I stayed in the hospital for six days after embolization, and then returned home. Although I still felt worse than I had ever felt in my life, I did in fact feel a little better, minimally better, with each passing day (and everyone told me, as they tend to tell sick people, that I was looking “great”). I still had sudden, overwhelming paroxysms of sleep, but I forced myself to work, cor- recting the galleys of my autobiography (even though I might fall asleep in mid- sentence, my head dropping heavily onto the galleys, my hand still clutching a pen). These post- embolization days would have been very difficult to en- dure without this task (which was also a joy). On day ten, I turned a corner — I felt awful, as usual, in the morning, but a completely different person in the after- noon. This was delightful, and wholly unexpected: there was no intimation, beforehand, that such a transformation was about to happen. I regained some appetite, my bowels started working again, and on February 28 and March 1, I had a huge and delicious diuresis, losing fifteen pounds over the course of two days. I suddenly found myself full of physical and creative energy and a euphoria almost akin to hypomania. I strode up and down the corridor in my apartment building while exuberant thoughts rushed through my mind. How much of this was a reestablish- ment of balance in the body; how much an autonomic rebound after a profound autonomic depression; how much other physiological factors; and how much the sheer joy of writing, I do not know. But my transformed state and feel- ing were, I suspect, very close to what Nietzsche experienced after a period of illness and expressed so lyrically in The Gay Science: Gratitude pours forth continually, as if the unexpected had just hap- pened — the gratitude of a conva- lescent — for convalescence was unexpected The rejoicing of strength that is returning, of a re- awakened faith in a tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, of a sud- den sense and anticipation of a fu- ture, of impending adventures, of seas that are open again. Epilogue The hepatic artery embolization de- stroyed 80 percent of the tumors in my liver. Now, three weeks later, I am having the remainder of the metastases embolized. With this, I hope I may feel really well for three or four months, in a way that, perhaps, with so many me- tastases growing inside me and drain- ing my energy for a year or more, would scarcely have been possible before. 6 The New York Review Couldn^t Prove, Had to Promise poems by WYATT PRUNTY “Prunty holds everyday experience up to the light in such a way that it seems anything but.

Penguin, 509 pp., $35.00 In a debate before the 2008 New Hampshire primary, the suddenly embattled Hillary Clinton — finally recognizing the threat posed to her candidacy by the upstart junior senator from Illinois — had something to say about the stirring promises of transfor- mative post-partisan change he’d been making. She said she’d been fighting for change all her life in politics but cau- tioned: “We don’t need to be raising the false hopes of our country about what can be delivered.” David Axelrod, the Chicago politi- cal consultant who orchestrated the themes of Barack Obama’s campaign and coined its rapturous slogan “Yes We Can,” immediately pounced on the dose of dour realism Clinton had just delivered. “I recognized the opportu- nity that Hillary had handed us,” he writes in his readable memoir of his life in politics. “She was too much a part of the system in Washington ever to change it — and without changing the politics of Washington, real solutions to big problems would never come.” The consultant might have called his book Confession rather than Be- liever, for elsewhere, when he’s not in campaign mode, he all but acknowl- edges that raising false hopes was his business, that it had a lot to do with the outcome he proudly — and, many would still say, justly — celebrates. A little more than a year into the first Obama term, with the economy still hemorrhaging jobs, Axelrod finds him- self in the West Wing thinking back to those heady campaign days. “Obama had been elected promising something more ambitious, a wholesale change in our political culture — and by this mea- sure he was failing,” he reflects. “The country was no less divided.” Facing Obama’s reelection campaign several years later he again uses the F word (“failure”). Polling data tell him that “the president’s failure to tame Washington and build biparti- san bridges was the most often-stated disappointment among the movable independent voters who had decisively tilted his way in 2008.” Finally, veering further in a confessional direction after he has stepped back from an active role, he concludes that Obama’s initial victory, seeming to justify his claim of a mandate for change, had “touched off such a ferocious counterreaction that it wound up only exacerbating the prob- lem.” Not everyone, it turns out, was cheering when the president-elect pro- claimed on that thrilling election night: “Change has come to America.” For Clinton in 2015 — again the pre- sumptive front-runner for the Demo- cratic nomination, on what this time around remains an empty held — there may be a lesson here worth pondering. It’s not to beware of raising false hopes. It’s to remember that hope, once ig- nited, is likely to roll over gritty, hard- earned realism. Clearly she was right seven years ago about the prospects for transcending partisan warfare in Washington, but her challenger won the nomination and election, only to be stunned at the outset of his admin- istration when his landmark Ameri- can Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aimed at heading off a second Great Depression, passed the House of Rep- resentatives without a single Republi- can vote in its favor. That was a preview of the furious, scorched- earth legislative tactics Re- publicans have pursued these last six years in their campaign to undermine, even delegitimize a president who just happens to be the first non-white in the office. By their own count, the House has now voted to repeal the Af- fordable Care Act sixty-seven times. (Democrats say it has only been fifty- six times.) Contrasted with their most recent affront — the reckless letter sent by forty-seven Republican senators to Iranian leaders calling into ques- tion President Obama’s authority to conclude an agreement that might ef- fectively freeze or stall Iran’s nuclear bomb-building programs for ten or more years — those futile Obamacare votes were playacting. The possibility of united, deter- mined obstruction never intruded on the scenario of the “new, inclusive poli- tics” sketched by the consultant and his “once-in-a-lifetime client” back when Obama was still a member of the Il- linois legislature running for a Senate seat. In those days, he preached that we were all one people, not residents of red states and blue states; he still does, but the number of red states has risen while his approval ratings have drooped. Of course, such crude political sums and subtractions amount to some- thing less than a reliable verdict on the Obama presidency as a whole. David Axelrod, who was a White House in- sider for only the first two years, draws a persuasive picture of a president more deeply engaged in stepping up to the big issues as “the decider” (to revive a tag favored by his predecessor, the sec- ond Bush) than tracking the politics of his decisions. Few of those decisions, Axelrod Anally argues, “would satisfy the politics of the moment. But at home and abroad, Obama was playing a lon- ger game.” Trying to, at least. Early on the new president discovered there was more to the job than making careful, com- monsense decisions. There’s also the need to foresee the obstacles that may be put in a president’s way, not always by political foes. Obama publicly de- clared that managers of the tottering insurance behemoth AIG should not be paid rich bonuses out of federal bailout funds, only to discover that his treasury secretary and chief economic adviser, Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, had already intervened on the other side. He could repudiate his advisers in the midst of the crisis — an option he never considered — or pay the bonuses and the political cost that went with them. The bonuses were paid. “You know, I love this job,” Obama tells Axelrod in those dark days. “I love diving into problems. But dealing with some of the people you have to deal with and the whole cable thing wears you out.” A short time later, Axelrod, along with the then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, counseled against a presi- dential decision to go flat out for a health care act that would include a mandate (penalizing those who don’t sign up) — a provision Hillary Clinton had supported and Obama had op- posed during the primaries, not on principle but to reap a political ad- vantage. “What are we going to do?” he has Obama now saying in a private conversation. “Are we going to put our approval ratings on the shelf and ad- mire them for eight years? Or are we going to spend down on them and try to get some important things done for the future? ” Axelrod the memoirist writes of the adviser whose advice was being rejected: “Half of me wanted to stand up and cheer.” The other half of him, he later ex- plains, knew that Obama could pay a steep political price. Contemplating the fast-spreading Tea Party protest, he finds evidence of “a truth we were loath to acknowledge publicly,” which was that some of the anger was rooted in race, in “the idea of the black man with the Muslim name in the White House” arranging “just another giveaway to poor black people at their expense.” On the night the Affordable Care Act Anally passes, the consultant sits alone in his White House office and cries. “Not little sniffles,” so he says, “but big, heaving sobs.” He writes that he was thinking of all the sacrifices he and his wife had made to assure treatment for their epileptic daughter. Obama, who’d promised bipartisanship, had shown himself ready to make distasteful deals, to bargain and implore, and had Anally “jammed the law through on a straight party-line vote,” risking his standing with “moderate, swing voters.” The consultant then wrings out his story for maximum effect. As he tells it, he walked across the hall and thanked the president on behalf of his family and others in similar predicaments. He recalls Obama responding, “That’s why we do the work.” At other times the president’s focus on “the work,” on the command of detail it demands, gets in the way of leadership, his own ability to sell his programs. He could look slightly put upon, impatient to get back to his desk, in his rare White House press confer- ences. Some of that air of preoccupa- tion carried over into his first debate in 2012 with a well-primed, bright-eyed, thoroughly rehearsed Mitt Romney. Axelrod had warned Obama the pre- vious evening after his own rehearsal that he was speaking as if by rote, not connecting, missing his opportunities. His scribbled notes to himself on his candidate’s performance come across on paper as groans. “Wonkfest,” one said. “No humanity,” said another, shorthand for a flunking grade for not connecting to real concerns of real people. A president gets unused to bad reviews from his inner circle. “No drama” Obama threw a small, unchar- acteristic fit that night, tossing off trash talk as he stormed out through double doors. (“Motherfucker’s never happy” is what Axelrod heard.) Surveys the night of the actual debate confirmed the consultant’s forebodings. Before the second debate, the top campaign advisers staged what one de- scribed as “an intervention” with the president. Axelrod spoke for the group. His pep talk belongs in texts on politi- cal campaigns in general, presidential campaigns in particular. “You’re treat- ing this like it’s all on the level,” he recalls himself saying. “It’s not a trial or even a real debate. This is a perfor- mance. Romney understood that. He was delivering lines. You were answer- ing questions. I know it’s a galling pro- cess, but it is what it is.” It is what it is. Coming from a faith- ful, self-styled “believer,” the words may register as cynical. But anyone can rec- ognize the reality they describe. Obama was reelected to a second term by a deci- sive margin for various reasons. An im- portant one is that he learned his lines, allowing his handlers to drill him over and over again until, to paraphrase one of them, they “locked in.” He was no lon- ger “disdainful of the artifice the process demanded of him.” He suspended his disbelief so we could suspend ours.

Like many memoir writers, Axelrod has the preternatural knack of summoning up whole conver- sations word-for-word as if he taped them.) Putting the same thought an- other way, he recalls saying, “You may be too normal.” Agreeing, Obama said, so we’re told, that he didn’t “need to be president.” He then makes a singularly immodest, ultimately prescient pledge: “If I get in. I’m not getting in to lose. I’m going to do what’s necessary.” And he does, accepting inconvenient speak- ing gigs in likely swing states, piling up political debts, vanishing from his Chicago home and family for the better part of a year, patiently schooling him- self to appear engrossed in the views of well-heeled, potential donors. It turns out that he’s obsessive enough, driven and self-disciplined, not too normal at all. In truth, he was moving faster than his advisers. Before he had completed his second year in Washington as a senator, Axelrod recognized, “Barack was positioning himself to seize the moment if and when it came.” An early tip-off that he was serious on more than one level came in 2005, his first year in the Senate, in a discussion with his consultant and chief of staff on which way to vote on the nomination of John Roberts for chief justice. His initial in- clination was to vote to confirm. “If I become president someday,” he said, not bothering to be coy, “I don’t want to see my own, qualified nominees for the Court shot down because of ideology.” Equally telling was his actual vote. He became one of twenty-two Democrats to vote no. This brings us back to the question of what the eponymous “Believer” ac- tually believed. Axelrod’s riffs on that question carry him back to the 1960s and the campaigns of John Kennedy, whom he viewed at the age of five on a campaign stop near Stuy vesant Town in Manhattan, and, more especially, Bobby Kennedy, who died when our author was thirteen. What he believes in, as he expresses it here, is not any particular program but a campaign and candidate who can stir the idealism of youth (“a healing figure” offering “a chance to end the wars, both abroad and in Washington, and lift the nation’s sights toward higher goals”). He then sits down to write the fresh- man senator a memo, practically a mash note, that’s almost embarrass- ing in its jejune fervor, which we may assume to be genuine. He quotes it at length. Here’s a taste: Voters are primed to turn the page and choose a candidate who offers an inspiring, inclusive, confident and HOPEFUL vision for America in the 21st Century. They want to believe again in themselves, their country and their future. They want to believe again in Ameri- ca’s exceptionalism, of which you are both a champion and a reflec- tion. For all these reasons, you are uniquely suited for these times. On both sides of the political divide, there are obviously operatives and vot- ers receptive to or touched by this kind of ardor. They turn up at political ral- lies. But most voters don’t go to rallies. They watch them on TV with a measure of skepticism, if they watch them at all. They’re not “primed” to view their exer- cise of the franchise as a religious expe- rience. Habit, economic circumstances, loyalties and biases of various kinds, anger as well as faith, not to mention attention spans that may be measured in seconds, all enter into their voting decisions. One can imagine Ronald Reagan receiving a memo in the same tone and words. That goes too for most of this year’s crop of Republican candi- dates. It’s harder to imagine what went through the mind of Barack Obama, a more subtle thinker, or so we’ve come to believe, when it landed in his inbox. Clearly it was not a turnoff. AA^e’ll have to wait for his memoir to And out. If it’s as evasive and defensive as most presidential memoirs, we never will. This president has shown himself to be a gifted writer so there’s reason to hope he’ll go deeper than his prede- cessors. If he’s serious about more than a big payday and preserving whatever it is the overused word “legacy” is sup- posed to represent, it’s not inconceiv- able that he’ll run the risk of candor and self-discovery, which is to say write like a truth-seeking writer and not a politician. The result could be the best presidential memoir we’ve had. (Yes, Ulysses S. Grant wrote a great one but he never got to his White House years.) In his consultant’s rendering, the strongest suggestion of what Obama might say comes in the response he gave when his wife Michelle challenged him to tell what he could contribute that other capable candidates couldn’t: The day I raise my hand to take that oath of office as president of the United States, the world will look at us differently, and mil- lions of kids — black kids, Hispanic kids — will look at themselves dif- ferently. Axelrod tells us that the soon-to-be candidate lifted his right hand as he said this. The world was impressed, for a time, but not as impressed as the new presi- dent and his advisers had apparently allowed themselves to expect. Foreign policy was not David Axelrod’s portfo- lio but he traveled abroad with Obama in 2008 when, as a candidate, he made a quick tour of the Middle East and delivered a speech to a large crowd in Berlin’s Tiergarten calling for a new spirit of collaboration among nations. Implicit in it was an underlying as- sumption that his election might be a turning point in world affairs. The only thing that was really new in the speech was Obama himself. Turns out that wasn’t enough: In time, the challenge of over- coming ancient rivalries, of rising above parochial political concerns and advancing democracy in places with no history or institu- tions to support it, would prove far more daunting than we had hoped or imagined on that glorious day in Berlin. Axelrod now acknowledges: “Stubborn realities would intrude.” Oh dear. How did that happen? When he reflects on the new presi- dent’s trip to the Middle East in June 2009, Axelrod slips back into the same sorrowful tone and language in re- counting the failure of the region to em- brace the politics of hope. Once again we hear about “ancient rivalries,” this time between Sunni and Shia, Arab and Jew, “that would not yield to his charm, gestures, or persistence.” The highlight of the trip for Obama was a speech in Cairo in which he’d invested high hopes and much time, according to Axelrod, who accompanied him. “I’ve come here to Cairo,” the address said, “to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect.” As we’ve since seen, there was no new beginning, just as there had been none after a similar — if anything, stronger — speech on the topic of democracy de- livered in Cairo by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice four years earlier. Axelrod wafts a halfhearted intuition that Obama’s speech may have in- spired some demonstrators in the Arab Spring two years later, only to acknowl- edge that the Arab Spring in Egypt helped beget a traditionalist backlash at the polls led by the Muslim Brother- hood, which begat a severely repressive military regime, with which the Obama administration is now gradually mend- ing fences. The president’s reflections on this cycle of events should be another fas- cinating part of his memoir, whenever it appears. It will presumably be before the next high American officeholder gives a speech on democracy and new beginnings in Cairo. In any future Obama memoir we may also hope to learn more about his thinking on various national security issues and personnel than has been forthcoming so far — his early deci- sion against calling for an independent commission’s review of Bush adminis- tration officials who licensed torture in their ballyhooed war on terror; his thoughts about Senate Democrats who deserted him on the issue of closing the Guantanamo prison; the revolving door between the National Security Agency and private contracting Arms; the long struggle between the Senate Intelligence Committee and the CIA over the committee’s report on torture and why no one at the agency was held accountable for hacking into the com- mittee’s files; the use of drones on the frontier of Pakistan and beyond; how he came to rely on John Brennan, now director of central intelligence, for guidance on such issues . . . The list can be extended. David Axelrod wasn’t consulted on such matters but he repeats a striking passage from a conversation President Obama had early on, back in 2009, that may foreshadow the approach he’ll take in a memoir. The meeting was with a group of civil liberties lawyers who’d come to the White House to dis- cuss the issue of preventive detention. “We have different roles,” he said. You represent clients and you are doing exactly what you should. I am the president of the United States, with the responsibility to protect the American people. Do we just release them and take the chance they blow you up? There’s only so much a democracy can bear. The obvious subtext is an abiding con- cern about the pressures that might erupt in the aftermath of another big attack to again loosen restraints on all the practitioners of counterterrorism, on surveillance, preventive detention, even torture. Axelrod the Believer viewed the 2008 campaign as “the triumph of politics as it should be.” Ever HOPEFUL, he’s now at the University of Chicago, urg- ing young people to “grab the wheel of history and steer us to a better place.” That’s how he ends his book, which may inspire some young people as in love with politics and as idealistic as he tells us he was. It seems churlish to point out that it’s not only in the Middle East that “ancient rivalries” and “stubborn realities” intrude; to wonder, for instance, how much youth- ful idealism it will now take to do something about the Citizens United decision, the Koch brothers, all the other billionaires who feel entitled to thrust their weighty thumbs on the political scales, the K Street lobbying legions flocking to congressional fund- raisers, the various manifestations of money politics that have festered — no fault of Obama’s — since “politics as it should be” brought “change” to Washington.

Catalog of the exhibition edited by Timothy Verdon and Daniel M. Zolli. Museum of Biblical Art/Giles, 200 pp., $49.95 The Museum of Biblical Art, lodged in a relatively small space on Broad- way near Lincoln Center, is now show- ing nine sculptures by Donatello, one of the greatest of all Renaissance art- ists. Never before have so many of his best works been shown together in the United States. Among the works on view is Don- atello’s large sculpture of the Old Tes- tament prophet Habakkuk. “Speak, damn you, speak!” Donatello, we are told, repeatedly shouted at the statue while carving it. The dream of a statue that can speak or breathe or move is a fantasy shared by many cultures throughout time, and the story may be apocryphal. Still, it points to the fundamental appeal of Donatello’s sculptures: by some strange magic they seem to capture the phantom of life. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Habakkuk, which Vasari praised as “finer than anything else he ever made.” Even today it is often said to be the most important marble statue of the fifteenth century. This sublimely harrowing work is at the heart of the exhibition “Sculp- ture in the Age of Donatello.” All twenty-three items in it were made for the cathedral of Florence in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centu- ries and are on loan from its museum, the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, which is currently closed for renova- tion. None of the sculptures has been shown in the US before. Along with works by Donatello, the exhibition fea- tures sculptures by his contemporaries Nanni di Banco, Luca della Robbia, Giovanni d’Ambrogio, and others, as well as architectural models by Filippo Brunelleschi. The show reminds us why Donatello is so often ranked among the greatest sculptors. Born in Florence around 1386, the son of a wool carder, he worked in his teens assisting Lorenzo Ghiberti on the bronze doors of the Baptistery, but very soon after emerged as one of the preeminent artists of the Renaissance. His most admired sculp- tures include the fiery Saint George carved for the church of Orsanmichele around 1416, the sleek bronze David made for the Medici, probably in the late 1430s, and the proud equestrian statue of the Venetian condottiere Erasmo da Narni, known as Gattame- lata, erected in Padua between 1447 and 1453. Sources tell us little about Donatello’s personality, although one writer describes him as being “rough and very straightforward.” In his art, too, he favored forcefulness of expres- sion and cared little for tradition and convention. The objects in New York are dis- played in just one medium-sized room. Since some of the sculptures are larger than life and most were intended for placement on the exterior of the ca- thedral and its bell tower, this setting could have proved very unsympathetic. Fortunately, the works are beautifully lighted, and the bases are high enough to suggest their original exalted posi- tion yet low enough to allow the viewer to stand in close proximity to them. Moreover, several of the statues have recently been freed from decades of soot and grime by cleaning; for the first time in living memory they are close to their original color and luster. They are shown to better effect in New York than ever before. A system of translucent white cur- tains divides the room into bays for the different sections of the show, allowing the visitor to concentrate on individual items, but also to take in the entire ex- hibition at a glance. The visual experi- ence is compressed yet illuminating. Standing in one spot, simply by turning your head, you can see the evolution of art in Florence during the first decades of the Renaissance. Continuing efforts to build and deco- rate the Florentine Duomo made it the most important site for the develop- ment of sculpture and architecture in Europe in the early fifteenth century. This flourishing is all the more remark- able when we consider how sudden it was. In Florence both arts had lain dor- mant for much of the previous century; the few major projects there in building and sculpting had been commissioned mostly from foreign artists who came to the city specifically for the task, and often left even before the job was done. For instance, the new cathedral of Florence was begun in 1296 by Ar- nolfo di Cambio, a Sienese artist who had trained in Pisa, and the first bronze doors for the Baptistery, made around 1330, were designed by a sculptor from Pisa and cast by a founder from Venice. Effectively, there was no local tradition in making sculpture or architecture. When work on the cathedral en- tered a new phase of high activity at the end of the fourteenth century, non-Florentines still were predominant in its creation — one leading sculptor for the Duomo was from Germany. The last instance of this tendency was the famous competition held in 1401 to make a new set of bronze doors for the Baptistery; most of the con- testants were from Siena and other Tuscan towns. Yet this competition was won by the young Florentine gold- u smith Lorenzo Ghiberti, and another I young Florentine goldsmith, Filippo ES Brunelleschi — the future architect — SE came in second. A new era in the his- 0 ES tory of art had begun. Like all revolutions, the transfor- c mation of the arts in early-flfteenth- century Florence can never be fully 1 explained; at best we can only identify to some contributing causes. Stimulated g in part by the city’s soaring prosperity and growing hegemony, around 1400 5 the wealthy merchants who ran Flor- I ence began to pour unprecedented 1 amounts of cash into new buildings, paintings, and sculptures. They were 2 proud of the architectural splendor I of Florence and saw it as a sign of the city’s manifest destiny. This attitude was given voice by Leonardo Bruni, who wrote around 1403-1404 in his Panegyric to the City of Florence: As soon as [visitors] have seen . . . the grandeur of its buildings, its splendor and magnificence, the lofty towers, the marble churches, the domes of the basilicas . . . they are no longer amazed by the great- ness and most important exploits accomplished by Florence. Rather, everyone immediately comes to believe that Florence is indeed worthy of attaining dominion and rule over the entire world. As the Florentine merchant and phi- losopher Matteo Palmieiri stated some years later, it was the duty of “great men” to spend “on things that are hon- orific and full of glory, not private, but public things, such as buildings and the decoration of churches.” No one ranked higher in Florentine society than the members of the in- ternational wool merchants’ guild, the Arte della Lana, who patronized the Duomo. Starting in the 1390s, they sought to put up more statues, on a larger scale and more quickly, than ever before in Florentine history. The scope of effort was colossal. It occurred, how- ever, at a moment when many cities, including Milan and Venice, were also erecting enormous cathedrals and pal- aces, and as a result experienced sculp- tors and masons were in demand all over Italy. The overseers of the Duomo had no choice but to rely more than be- fore on a group of untested locals, many of whom had been initially trained as goldsmiths, not as stone carvers. It is rarely remarked how very young these artists were. At the time of the competition for the Baptistery doors Ghiberti was only about twenty- one, and Brunelleschi twenty-four. Donatello was only about twenty when he began his earliest independent com- mission, a prophet for the cathedral, which is on view in the exhibition. Nanni di Banco, Donatello’s main rival in these years in marble carving, was also in his early or mid-twenties when he made the pendant to this fig- ure. Their youthful freedom from the weight of tradition helped these art- ists to reimagine the possibilities and techniques of sculpture, and the urgent demand for new work meant they were forced into continual collaboration and competition — a perfect setting for in- novation.

The exhibition opens with an An- nunciation group of the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary, made at the end of the fourteenth century, and commonly attributed to the sculptor Giovanni dAmbrogio. It exemplifies both the sophistication and the limita- tions of Italian sculpture of this time. The faces are exquisitely carved and the robes wrap around the figures with consummate grace, yet the bodies are nearly lost beneath the fabric and the limbs are pressed so close to the trunk of the statue that they look stunted and inert. A basic problem for many sculptors before the fifteenth century was tech- nical, as we can see in these statues. Uncertain of the physical capacities of stone, and unwilling to risk spoiling a costly block of marble through unnec- essary experimentation, artists typi- cally carved their statues as shallowly as possible, with minimal undercutting of the limbs and drapery. As a result, sculptures of this time often appear blocky and constrained. We are in a very different world when we stand before the prophets attrib- uted to Donatello and Nanni di Banco, carved about ten years later, for the Porta della Mandorla, a major entrance on the north side of the cathedral. Gone is the refinement and restraint of earlier works. Instead the emphasis is entirely on movement and emotion. Donatello’s Profetino (small prophet) is so desperate to communicate that he lurches toward us, almost stepping off his base. He juts his neck forward and raises his head, seemingly yearning for the light above, yet his eyes are directed downward and his lips are parted. He is about to speak, and the hand raised to the heart suggests that his message will be moving and grave. The new emphasis on motion and ex- pression was accompanied by a change in technique. Ghiberti and Donatello were possibly the first artists since classical antiquity regularly to make large sculptures on the basis of three- dimensional preparatory models in wax or clay rather than drawings. It was likely Ghiberti who devised this inno- vation, based on his experience work- ing with gold, for which model-making was common, although in much smaller dimensions. This development had many advan- tages. Fundamentally, it allowed artists to experiment in the design of statuary with far greater liberty. Rather than conceiving sculptures in relation to the rectilinear planes of the quarried block, artists could now, from the start, imag- ine their statues as figures that stood and moved freely. This innovation was noted by Leon Battista Alberti in his Treatise on Statuary, perhaps written in the 1430s, where he says that mod- els permit the sculptor to depict greater movement of the limbs and more com- plex surfaces. We can see exactly what Alberti means when we look at the Abraham and Isaac made by Donatello and a young assistant, Nanni di Bartolo, in 1421 for a niche on the cathedral’s bell tower, the Campanile. The first monu- mental multifigure sculpture of the Renaissance — it is over six feet tall — it depicts the moment when Abraham, hearing the angel of the Lord, relents in his sacrifice of his son. With one hand Abraham still grasps Isaac’s hair at the back of his head, but with the other he turns the blade away from Isaac’s neck, and his grip on the knife has begun to relax. The sculpture’s strong illusion of movement was aided by drilling clear through the block of marble at sev- eral points so that Abraham’s massive arms can appear to swing free of his torso, and the right legs of Abraham and Isaac can be posed in front of their bodies. Since the end of classical antiq- uity nearly a thousand years before, no Italian sculptor had tried anything so bold in the carving of marble sculpture. One of Donatello’s favorite subjects was the depiction of a holy person who had suffered an acutely painful religious experience and had thereby won divine wisdom beyond the limits of human understanding. Examples of this from his late works include his painted wood Mary Magdalene of about 1455 (also in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, but alas not in the show), in which she is represented as a toothless crone praying in the desert, or his Resur- reetion on the pulpit of San Lorenzo (1460-1466), where a haggard Christ in a filthy winding sheet looks like he still stinks from the grave. Donatello’s portrayal of sacred subjects was com- pletely at odds with the usual approach of the time: most artists depicted saints as beyond the reach of suffering, even when they were shown undergoing martyrdom. yVmong Donatello’s first attempts to represent a holy person in this way was the marble of Habbakuk, which he carved for the Campanile likely between 1427 and 1436. It represents the prophet whose short book in the Old Testament concerns the rise and advance of the Chaldeans against the Jews in the seventh century BC. The sculpture is commonly called Lo Zuc- eone (“the pumpkin”) because of his large bald pate. Created three decades after the Profetino, it was the last mar- ble statue Donatello ever made; there- after he worked chiefly in bronze. The first word of the book of Hab- bakuk can be translated as “burden,” and never has the trial of prophecy been more vividly represented than in Donatello’s statue. The artist portrays the holy man as harrowed and ravaged by the revelation that he has seen and must now convey. Wrapped in mas- sive drapery that is at once weighty and floating, Habbakuk hovers and stares, a visitor from a realm where we mere mortals dare not go. His gigantic mouth, cut deep into his head and wide across his face, is open to speak and the words that it will emit are sure to be fearsome. The fiery text of his speech in the Bible is a call of warning and despair, as much as a prayer. It begins, “O Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry unto thee o/ vio- lence, and thou wilt not save! ” Near the end the book tells in brief but agonizing detail of what he has suffered for his di- vine vision: “When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself.” Donatello’s statue embodies the sense of spiritual and physical terror in the biblical account. There is a tendency in the study of Donatello to praise his classicism and naturalism, but looking at Habbakuk one must acknowledge how inadequate and misleading such terms are in any account of his art. The massive drap- ery of the figure, for example, is only loosely related to that of ancient sculp- ture, and the head with its mesmerizing eyes is far distant from the restraint of a Republican or Imperial bust. Even phi- losopher portraits from the so-called “age of anxiety” in the third and fourth centuries AD look placid and serene by comparison. Donatello, no doubt, stud- ied ancient sculpture with passion, but he felt wholly unbound by its conven- tions; he was only interested in how it could help him achieve greater vitality and expressiveness. According to a tradition repeated in Vasari, Habbakuk's features were modeled on those of a Florentine citi- zen, and partly on this basis some art historians have credited the statue’s power to its element of realism. But as with so many of Donatello’s works, the credibility of this sculpture — its eerie vividness and palpable sense of presence — has as much to do with the distortion of actuality as with its imi- tation. As we can see in Habbakuk, Donatello was always significantly exaggerating the size of the most ex- pressive features, especially the eyes, mouth, and hands. Another example of this in the show is in the Saint John the Evangelist made for the facade of the cathedral between 1408 and 1415; Do- natello gave this statue massive hands and ferocious eyes as well. Further- more, to overcome the lifelessness of marble or bronze, he made the outlines and surfaces of his sculptures undulate in irregular, uneven, and asymmetrical shapes so that the figure would look as if it were caught in a moment of change, like a living thing. Historians like to celebrate Don- atello for groundbreaking achieve- ments such as making the first bronze nude statue since antiquity in his David for the Medici, or devising a way to apply the rules of single-point perspec- tive to sculpture in his relief of Saint George and the Dragon. These were accomplishments of great significance for the development of art, but still they were secondary to his principal artistic ambition: to show the power and the drama of the human response to contact with the divine. Throughout his career, he depicted holy persons, rapt in religious ecstasy and transfig- ured by revelation, not only because his commissions required him to, but because experience of the sacred was what he yearned for personally. In art he was a naturalist but one whose idea of nature included the unseen and the unearthly as well as the visible and the mundane. In the Bible Habbakuk warned against those who would seek to make idols, “Woe unto to him that saith to the wood. Awake; to the dumb stone. Arise.” Yet this seems to be exactly the kind of command Donatello gave his Habbakuk. Like a Renaissance magus, he believed the world was full of spirits, and he wanted his sculptures to palpi- tate with life.

Harper, 436 pp., $35.00 It was an oddity of growing up in the small Berkshire town of Faringdon in the 1950s that Lord Berners’s name was often mentioned. He was, in a way, a part of the landscape. A tall slen- der tower on a hill at the edge of the town was the goal of all our childhood walks, its red-brick walls rising scarily blank to a high-up viewing chamber and Gothic crown that showed above the surrounding pines. This was Lord Berners’s Folly, said to be the last great folly built in England, and stridently opposed by the town when it was first planned in 1934. Before long of course it was something to be proud of, and when Berners depicted it in his paint- ing for a famous Shell poster it be- came an emblem of the town, its Eiffel Tower. It was opened with fireworks on Guy Fawkes Night 1935 and the guests were invited to “bring effigies of their enemies for the bonfire. No guest may bring more than six effigies.” It bore a characteristic notice: “MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC COMMITTING SUICIDE FROM THIS TOWER DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK.” Berners, a distinguished composer, novelist, and memoirist as well as a prolific painter, was best known to us, as he had been for decades to the illus- trated papers, as an eccentric. Around him anecdote, not discouraged by himself, proliferated and mutated. Ex- tremely rich, he had made Faringdon House, his elegant Georgian mansion concealed beyond the parish church, a place of luxurious hospitality to artis- tic and society friends throughout the 1930s and beyond. Twenty years ear- lier a clued-in porter might have noted the arrival at our little train station of Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, or Elsa Schiaparelli. After Berners’s death in 1950 his much younger partner and heir, Robert Heber-Percy, maintained his traditions. He continued to dye the Faringdon pi- geons all the colors of the rainbow, and made further surreal interventions in our placid rural scene. He installed the salvaged statue of “Africa” that looked down on the road into town on the north side — a swathed figure spo- ken of and described in guidebooks as a woman, but on close inspection of the chest quite clearly a man. It had just the Berners note of deadpan provocation, a sexual conundrum hidden in plain sight. Sofka Zinovieff records the rumor that the Folly itself was a birthday present from Berners to Heber-Percy, an outra- geous phallic compliment disguised as an architectural caprice. Their relationship was an attraction of opposites, the older man shy, stout, and bald, a depressive who sought ref- uge in frivolity and the creation of wit- tily sophisticated music; the younger, known for much of his life as “the Mad Boy,” lean, handsome, barely educated, recklessly physical, and sexually mag- netic. Mainly Heber-Percy magnetized men, but he had flings with women, one of which produced a daughter. This is really the origin of Zinovieff’s book, since that daughter was her mother. The early part of The Mad Boy, Lord Bern- ers, My Grandmother and Me gives an admirable account of Berners’s color- ful but hardworking career, and of the life he and Heber-Percy made together at Faringdon; it’s in effect a double bi- ography, in which a story told before only from Berners’s perspective is seen from a new angle. Then, very fascinat- ingly, Zinovieff traces the complex aftermath of their story through subse- quent generations. The result is a study in unconven- tional relationships, enshrined in the setup at Faringdon House, in surpris- ing marriages and rapid divorces, in the pursuit of pleasure and its darker undertow. A note of heartlessness is essential to the fun as well as the pain of this largely upper-class world. Faringdon itself is at the center of the book; it was Heber-Percy’s final but inspired piece of mischief to leave the house and its estate not to an expect- ant nephew, not to his daughter (who got nothing at all), but to his grand- daughter Sofka, and the later chapters of her superbly illustrated book are a subtle reckoning with what such an inheritance might mean and entail to an independent-minded writer and an- thropologist, responsive to the beauty and legends of the house, but dismayed by the demands and snobberies of the class system that had long sustained and defined it. z^fter his mother died in 1931, Bern- ers felt free to start writing a memoir of his childhood in which he could speak frankly, if not always accurately, about her, and about the miseries and occa- sional joys of his own upbringing. First Childhood (1934) and A Distant Pros- peet (1945), about his time at Eton, trace the emergence of a sensitive aes- thete from a background of philistine Shropshire gentry; the books are also a quite bold attempt to explain himself as both a depressive and a homosexual. The depression was there from early on — “Black care can sit behind us even on our rocking-horses.” Feelings of iso- lation and neglect fed the larger black- ness, fits of accidie that long outlived their cause; the constantly concocted frivolity of his later life was as much a way of keeping his depression at bay as were the strictly maintained routines of writing, painting, and composing. When Faringdon House had to be closed down at the start of World War II, this sustaining ambience was destroyed and Berners, lodging fifteen miles away in Oxford, had a nervous breakdown and underwent Freudian analysis. His school life was dominated by hatred for sadistic masters, aesthetic rapture caused by music and the dis- covery of Wagner, and hopeless ado- ration for certain boys — the memoirs give off an unusually strong sense, for a man in his fifties, of unforgiven cru- elties and unforgotten humiliations. Berners describes his obsession with a beautiful boy called Longworth, a romance that seems about to reach an improbable fruition when Longworth invites Berners to join him for a ciga- rette on the roof and lies beside him in the moonlight: “Never before in my life had I seen such disturbing beauty in a human face.” With perhaps a “tele- pathic inkling” of his adorer’s feelings, Longworth throws his arm around him and draws him close. “Then a dreadful thing occurred. Almost before I knew what was happening I was violently sick.” Berners always describes himself as someone without a chance as a lover, a person whose own body was at odds with his desires; but these accounts were written after he had settled down with Heber-Percy, and have perhaps a further private irony. His sexual life remains a possibly appropriate blank. Zinovieff says the two men were not viewed as lovers by the staff; and Mark Amory, in his 1998 biography of Bern- ers, seems to credit the story of an un- successful trial weekend, after which Berners said, “Don’t go. You make me laugh. I don’t mind about the other.” This would certainly square with Berners’s equanimity about his part- ner’s subsequent marriage, and later the installation of a boyfriend of his own at Faringdon House. Berners was loyal and generous, but surely not good at intimacy. The “Valse sentimentale” he composed for four hands suggests the most clumsy mismatch of the danc- ing couple. To some people indeed he seemed, in his charming way, not quite human — Siegfried Sassoon found him “consistently inhuman and unfailingly agreeable.” To Clarissa Churchill, a new young friend made during World War II, “his jokes were a defence against intimacy.” It fits with the pattern that Zinovieff, at early meetings with her grandfather Heber-Percy, found that “his character discouraged intimacy.” The admission of true feeling was not only bad form, it was a threat. What strikes one more now, in the memoirs and in the short surreal novels Berners wrote after being psychoana- lyzed, is the amused and unflustered prominence he gives to gay characters, perhaps more than any contemporary writer. Homosexuality, he writes, “is a subject that has been handled by the most highly esteemed authors of all times, from Moses to Proust, and some- times, I may say, not without a certain degree of hypocrisy.” Berners himself was not a hypocrite; his high bohemian circle was rich in gay men and in others, like Heber-Percy, whose sexuality was more omnivorous. He was certainly wary of public queenery, refusing to appear at breakfast at an Amalfi hotel with the “Mad Boy” — Heber-Percy — in “a scarlet shirt, a blue jumper, green trousers and a yellow belt.” Berners’s style was more the poker- faced hint, the wink through the mon- ocle. In his perceptive short memoir of the novelist Ronald Firbank he con- fesses that at first he found his friend’s flamboyance “decidedly embarrass- ing.” In fact in both men pathological shyness existed in a complex relation with their need to draw attention to themselves, though it is not always easy to say where the involuntary merges with calculated performance. To Berners, Firbank was “strange, or- chidaceous, incoherent, fantastic,” an idiosyncratic mix of the helpless and the willed. It’s a shame that Berners never wrote an account of his life as a composer. The fascination of his music from the start was its un-English orientation, its 16 The New York Review CHATTER: ARCHITECTURE TALKS BACK April 11-July 12 ART INSTITVTE CHICAGO Catalogue available May 8 at www.artic.edu Bureau Spectacular, by Jimenez Lai, assisted by Senaid Selcin and Frank Gossage.

In the 1930s his distinctive taste would align him with composers a generation younger, such as Constant Lambert and William Wal- ton. He writes at a refreshingly French- ified angle to his native scene, typical of his desire to startle, to amuse, and to prick pomposity. In 1916 he sought guidance from Stravinsky, who had a high opinion of his talents within their prescribed range. One of his most sur- prising pieces is among his earliest, composed that year. Three Little Fu- neral Marches — one for a statesman (ponderous), one for a canary (sweetly pathetic), and one for a rich aunt (a glee- ful allegro). Some people found them an unseemly response to death in the midst of the war, but their ignoring of the war was no doubt part of their point. Berners became known as the “Eng- lish Satie,” which isn’t quite right but suggests his disconcerting wit and econ- omy. The mainspring of his music is parody — after his Fantaisie Espagnole was performed (in the same program as the first British concert performance of The Rite of Spring) Constant Lambert remarked that it was now “impossible to hear most Spanish music without a cer- tain satiric feeling breaking through.” Notable commissions followed: The Triumph of Neptune, choreographed by George Balanchine for Sergei Diaghi- lev in 1926; and A Wedding Bouquet, a ballet with a chorus singing text by Gertrude Stein, in 1937. The Fantaisie Espagnole seemed set to become stan- dard repertory in the 1920s, but like these other beautifully crafted pieces it is now hardly played at all; perhaps the “satiric feeling” that animates them has also proved their limitation. Berners inherited his title (he be- came the fourteenth Baron Berners) from a childless maternal uncle in 1918. His discreet early claim that “I inherit only the title, with a lot of taxes to be paid” proved incorrect; he was now seriously rich and free to create for himself the optimal conditions for both pleasure and work. He bought and beautified houses in both Rome (where he’d worked as an honorary attache to the British embassy) and London’s Belgravia. Robert Heber-Percy, on the other hand, knew from the start that he would inherit almost nothing. Like Berners he came from an old Shrop- shire family, but he was a fourth son, with minimal prospects, and with al- most no ability to concentrate. The paradoxes of Heber-Percy’s child- hood were formative: the uninhibited outdoor life of a big estate, which he would stick to till the end, and the regi- mented indoor life, whose piety and abstinence he emphatically rejected, while valuing into his old age the for- mal regularity of a well-run household. As the youngest child he was left be- hind by his elder brothers and furtively spoiled by his mother; he became a “daring show-off” to prove himself and attract attention otherwise directed elsewhere. There was no chance of his getting into Eton or Harrow, but he found a place at the newly founded Stowe school, a vast country house of about the same size as the one he lived in at home, where he carried on with much the same sense of daredevil entitlement. His headmaster wrote about him: “He is a problem. Some people can’t suc- ceed, but he can’t tryT Sending him on to a crammer at the age of sixteen, he observed that “fatigue appears to make his mind go perfectly blank at intervals. You will find his work startlingly bad, but I shall be greatly surprised if you do not like the boy himself.” Similar objections were made, in a less friendly voice, by his superiors in the King’s Dragoon Guards, which he joined at the age of nineteen. There are very funny reports under different headings: “Energy: ... /uzy”; “Tact:... tactless'^', “Leadership: . . . indifferent; “Tactical knowledge:... scanty.” La- ziness and indifference led swiftly to his expulsion; and after that he was let loose on what Zinovieff calls “the wild life of the city.” Within a year he would meet Gerald Berners at a house party, and then the course of the rest of his life was set. He was twenty and Bern- ers was forty- eight. If he felt at home at Faringdon, it was in part, as Zinovieff suggests, because he behaved there like “a favoured first son on a country estate, but with the indulgence of an older man who was in love with him.” It was a magical adaptation of the preor- dained perspectives of family life and a happy deliverance from any conven- tional career. Everyone in both their worlds was surprised. It “was the first time I had met civilised people,” Heber-Percy later recalled. But the civilization of Faringdon, with its celebrated warmth (“Faringdonheit” as one guest called it), its rich food (the signature Souffle de Berners was made with brandy, eggs, cream, and crystallized fruit), and its glamorous, sexually unorthodox guests, was a thing apart. What Heber-Percy and Alice B. Toklas talked about over breakfast we will never know, but they probably got on fine, and there were certain parallels in their roles; “we did not share a single interest,” he said of Berners after his death, a special kind of tribute to a friendship. Still, the Far- ingdon of those years was a collabora- tion. They thought up ideas like dyeing the pigeons together but it was Heber- Percy who executed them. He became estate manager and during the war was officially Lord Berners’s “agent.” There’s an eloquent photograph by Cecil Beaton that captures what hap- pened next. Posed in the study that Berners used during the war as a bed- room, it places three unsmiling heads on a diagonal: at the top, Heber-Percy, leaning lightly against the bed and looking down at Berners, at the cen- ter of the picture, seated at a desk and reading a book in apparent unconcern, while sitting on the floor, her face half in shadow, is Jennifer Fry, now the Mad Boy’s wife. She alone looks out at us, an uncertain intruder in the world of the two men. Both the young people got on with Berners, but not with each other. After marrying her and bringing her to Faringdon, Heber-Percy’s cruel streak had emerged; he had repudiated her and locked her out of his bedroom. The marriage was effectively over. i^s a writer Zinovieff has been dou- bly fortunate in her grandmothers. In Red Princess (2007) she explored the extraordinary adventures, sexual, po- litical, and intellectual, of her father’s mother, Sofka Dolgorouky, a Russian aristocrat who fled the 1917 revolution, was interned by the Nazis, worked for the French Resistance, moved to Eng- land, yet was a card-carrying Commu- nist to the end of her days. The most poignant parts of The Mad Boy are her investigation of the life of her English grandmother, another highly sexed and intelligent woman, caught up not in revolution but in the brittle dysfunction of British upper-class life. The only child of a severe, wealthy, and secretly gay father and a beautiful but passive and neurasthenic mother, Jennifer grew up in the care of nannies (she’d had nine by the age of five) in a large and lonely-looking country house in Wiltshire called Oare. Her salvation was the last nanny, known as Pixie, with whom she formed the most enduring re- lationship of her life. (Such bonds with particular servants are a feature of this story.) She was attractive, adventurous, what was known as “a popular girl”; but was drawn recurrently to men who would treat her badly. After Heber- Percy she married the poet, editor, and cricketer Alan Ross, who seems to have been at once and continuingly un- faithful to her, though she maintained him financially for many years. When Berners died, Evelyn Waugh wrote, “The Mad Boy has installed a Mad Boy of his own. Has there ever been a property in history that has devolved from catamite to catamite for any length of time?” In fact Hugh Cruddas, who had become a fixture at Faringdon toward the end of the war, was very unlike the Mad Boy: he was genial, helpful, and sweet to the point of masochism.
