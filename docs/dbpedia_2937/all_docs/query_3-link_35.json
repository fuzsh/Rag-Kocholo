        "text": "1.5/5\n\n--\n\nRaising Heroes (1996) An unnecessarily violent blood-and-guts story of suspense involving a couple of rather one-dimensional gay characters. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n2.5/5\n\n--\n\nLife and Death on the A-List (1995) This is a sad, cautionary tale about the emphasis we gay men place on beauty, booty, and persona. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n2/5\n\n--\n\nSmoke (1993) Possibly the most depressing movie I have ever seen: not sad, really, just perversely depressing. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n1/5\n\n--\n\nCurse of the Queerwolf (1987) Unfortunately, as natural and genuine as Susan's [Cherones] comedic gifts are, her five minuted on the screen cannot save this clinker. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n3.5/5\n\n--\n\nL'Escorte (1996) When the script is all said and done, it is mostly Taillefer who makes this carefully substituted French flick worthwhile and memorable. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n4.5/5\n\n75%\n\nTogether Alone (1992) The plotting and script are very believable in their exploration of the deepest feelings of two very different men. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n5/5\n\n60%\n\nBoys Life (1995) I've watched this Evocatie video ten times and it remains quite fresh because it simply is one of the best gay film treatments I have ever seen. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n4/5\n\n67%\n\nStonewall (1995) All the acting and all of the production values are first-class. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n4.5/5\n\n--\n\nThe Toilers and the Wayfarers (1995) In spite of a somewhat weak and indeterminate ending, this is a great movie. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n1/5\n\n--\n\nThe Second Coming (1995) A pretentious, discombobulated mess. - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023\n\n2.5/5\n\n--\n\nBoyfriends (1996) You can skip this one... - Alabama Forum\n\nRead More | Posted May 05, 2023"
