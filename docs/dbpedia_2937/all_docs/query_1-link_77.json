Residents at doomed care home pin hopes on famous millionaires to step in and help stop closure of Winston House... five days before Christmas Report by Natasha Young Simon Cowell DESPERATE residents at a doomed care home have written to famous millionaires hoping they will come to their aid and save the home from closing... just five days before Christmas. Pamela Horn, a 45–year–old resident at Winston House on the Promenade, is looking to raise as much awareness as possible about their plight and has written to Simon Cowell and Richard Branson to appeal for help after being told the site is set to close. Craegmoor, the company which runs the care home inside two converted Victorian houses, issued a three month notice period for the closure due to take place on December 20, after bosses claimed it had become “impossible” for facilities to be brought up to modern standards. Having sent letters to Cowell and Branson, Pamela told The <strong>Champion</strong>: “I just asked them to help us if they could come up with money, and to let them know we’re losing our home,” she told The <strong>Champion</strong>. Pamela, who suffers from arthritis and the muscle condition Dystonia and has had strokes in the past, has lived at Winston House since June last year. The home offers respite and long–term nursing care for adults of all ages. She added: “Some people have been here for 20 years. It’s just a total nightmare. It’s a family unit here and it’s being pulled apart.” Winston House Nursing Home on Southport Promenade. Pamela’s family are supporting her campaign to save the home along with the family of another resident. A spokesperson for Craegmoor told The <strong>Champion</strong>: “We have taken the difficult decision to close Winston House. The building and the infrastructure are such that it would be impossible to raise the facilities to acceptable, modern standards and to improve the environment to the level required moving forward. Code1045453 “We would like to reassure everyone that we will be working closely with the residents, their families and all agencies to help find alternative homes with as little disruption as possible. Staff will also be offered the opportunity to relocate to other homes within the company. “This decision has not been taken lightly as our absolute priority is always the people who we care for, their families and our staff.” natasha.young@champnews.com 1099891 Unit 2 • The Old Laundry • off Aveling Drive NO FUSS Each worktop is custom made to fit your exact requirements NO MESS There’s no need to remove your existing worktops and your new surfaces are prefabricated and delivered ready to fit NO COMPARISON Our worktops will add sparkle to your kitchen and give it a whole new look.
