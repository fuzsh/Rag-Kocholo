        "text": "This paper traces three major stages in the development of algebraic notation: rhetorical or prose, syncopated, and symbolic. The. development of algebra began in Babylonia and Egypt around 1700 BC. Examples of rhetorical algebra by al-Khowârizmî are used to illustrate potential difficulties that arise when algebraic problems are worked using words without symbols. Greek mathematician Diophantus was one of the pioneers of syncopated algebra. In this stage of notation, some shorthand was used along with prose. Indian mathematicians developed a syncopated algebraic notation independently of Diophantus. Around 1500 BC, symbolic algebra began to develop. The process of the development of a standardized, efficient symbol system is illustrated by tracing the evolution of some common symbols, including the symbols for equals, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nIn the 1960s, a full formal description was seen as a crucial and unavoidable part of creating a new programming language. A key part of that was a thorough and rigorous description of the semantics. However, in the decades since, the focus on providing this has somewhat diminished. Why was formal semantics once seen as so critical? Why did it not succeed in the ways hoped? These questions are explored by considering the history of modelbased approaches to describing programming languages, with a particular focus on the IBM Laboratory Vienna under Heinz Zemanek, and the Programming Research Group at Oxford University under Christopher Strachey. It is shown that there were a variety of different approaches to the problem, stemming from the different backgrounds of the people and groups involved. The story of formal language description is in some ways also the story of early programming languages and the integration of mathematics into the emerging new field of computer science, resu...\n\nMathematical Notation is generally though of as universal and constant. This is not as true as the layman thinks, and Notation is in fact an evolving, subject-specific, collection of sub-notations, where the same symbol can mean different things in different parts of the same sentence. This paper surveys the various ways computers process, and help humans to process, the varieties of notation."
