        "text": "Certainly one of the most characteristic principles to organize computations with the help of appropriate data structures is the so-called stack principle. It is used not only when expressions with parentheses are to be evaluated, but even more importantly it is also the essential principle of organizing the data inside the memory when calling nested procedures. The stack principle also works for locally declared data within scopes and is therefore the most prominent implementation idea when dealing with high-level languages, scopes and block structures such as the languages of the ALGOL family. The paper describes the early ideas on using stacks starting from evaluating expressions and the development processes that have led to the ALGOL language family."
