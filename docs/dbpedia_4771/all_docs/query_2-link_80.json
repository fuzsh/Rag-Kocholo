        "text": "brief history of programming languages\n\nand other significant milestones\n\nThere have been literally thousands of programming languages, many of which have been lost to history.\n\nThis history of programming languages also discusses the developments of computer hardware, computer operating systems, games, and technology. Games are included because often the major advances in computer hardware and software technologies first appeared in games. As one famous example, the roots of UNIX were the porting of an early computer game to new hardware.\n\nantiquity\n\nThe earliest calculating machine was the abacus, believed to have been invented in Babylon around 2400 BCE. The abacus was used by many different cultures and civilizations, including the major advance known as the Chinese abacus from the 2nd Century BCE.\n\n200s BCE\n\nThe Antikythera mechanism, discovered in a shipwreck in 1900, is an early mechanical analog computer from between 150 BCE and 100 BCE. The Antikythera mechanism used a system of 37 gears to compute the positions of the sun and the moon through the zodiac on the Egyptian calendar, and possibly also the fixed stars and five planets known in antiquity (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) for any time in the future or past. The system of gears added and subtracted angular velocities to compute differentials. The Antikythera mechanism could accurately predict eclipses and could draw up accurate astrological charts for important leaders. It is likely that the Antikythera mechanism was based on an astrological computer created by Archimedes of Syracuse in the 3rd century BCE.\n\n100s BCE\n\nThe Chinese developed the South Pointing Chariot in 115 BCE. This device featured a differential gear, later used in modern times to make analog computers in the mid-20th Century.\n\n400s\n\nThe Indian grammarian Panini wrote the Ashtadhyayi in the 5th Century BCE. In this work he created 3,959 rules of grammar for Indias Sanskrit language. This important work is the oldest surviving linguistic book and introduced the idea of metarules, transformations, and recursions, all of which have important applications in computer science.\n\n1400s\n\nThe Inca created digital computers using giant loom-like wooden structures that tied and untied knots in rope. The knots were digital bits. These computers allowed the central government to keep track of the agricultural and economic details of their far-flung empire. The Spanish conquered the Inca during fighting that stretched from 1532 to 1572. The Spanish destroyed all but one of the Inca computers in the belief that the only way the machines could provide the detailed information was if they were Satanic divination devices. Archaeologists have long known that the Inca used knotted strings woven from cotton, llama wool, or alpaca wool called khipu or quipus to record accounting and census information, and possibly calendar and astronomical data and literature. In recent years archaeologists have figured out that the one remaining device, although in ruins, was clearly a computer.\n\n1800s\n\nCharles Babbage created the difference engine and the analytical engine, often considered to be the first modern computers. Augusta Ada King, the Countess of Lovelace, was the first modern computer programmer.\n\nIn the 1800s, the first computers were programmable devices for controlling the weaving machines in the factories of the Industrial Revolution. Created by Charles Babbage, these early computers used Punch cards as data storage (the cards contained the control codes for the various patterns). These cards were very similiar to the famous Hollerinth cards developed later. The first computer programmer was Lady Ada, for whom the Ada programming language is named.\n\nIn 1822 Charles Babbage proposed a difference engine for automated calculating. In 1933 Babbage started work on his Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer with all of the elements of a modern computer, including control, arithmetic, and memory, but the technology of the day couldnt produce gears with enough precision or reliability to make his computer possible. The Analytical Engine would have been programmed with Jacquards punched cards. Babbage designed the Difference Engine No.2. Lady Ada Lovelace wrote a program for the Analytical Engine that would have correctly calculated a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, but was never able to test her program because the machine wasnt built.\n\nGeorge Boole introduced what is now called Boolean algebra in 1854. This branch of mathematics was essential for creating the complex circuits in modern electronic digital computers.\n\nIn 1871, James Clerk Maxwell introduced his thought experiment, Maxwells demon, and a possible violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This thought experiment plays an important role in quantum physics and information theory.\n\nIn 1893, Jacques Salomon Hadamard proved his inequaltiy of determinants, which led to the discovery of Hadamard matrices, which are the foundation for the Hadamard Gate in quantum computing.\n\n1900s\n\nIn the 1900s, researchers started experimenting with both analog and digital computers using vacuum tubes. Some of the most successful early computers were analog computers, capable of performing advanced calculus problems rather quickly. But the real future of computing was digital rather than analog. Building on the technology and math used for telephone and telegraph switching networks, researchers started building the first electronic digital computers.\n\nLeonardo Torres y Quevedo first proposed floating point arithmetic in Madrid in 1914. Konrad Zuse independently proposed the same idea in Berlin in 1936 and built it into the hardware of his Zuse computer. George Stibitz also indpendently proposed the idea in New Jersey in 1939.\n\nThe first modern computer was the German Zuse computer (Z3) in 1941. In 1944 Howard Aiken of Harvard University created the Harvard Mark I and Mark II. The Mark I was primarily mechanical, while the Mark II was primarily based on reed relays. Telephone and telegraph companies had been using reed relays for the logic circuits needed for large scale switching networks.\n\nThe first modern electronic computer was the ENIAC in 1946, using 18,000 vacuum tubes. See below for information on Von Neumanns important contributions.\n\nThe first solid-state (or transistor) computer was the TRADIC, built at Bell Laboratories in 1954. The transistor had previously been invented at Bell Labs in 1948.\n\n1925\n\nTheory: Wolfgang Pauli invents the Pauli matrices, which are the basis for the Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, and Pauli-Z Gates in quantum computing.\n\n1936\n\nTheory: Alan Turing invents the Turing machine in his paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.\n\n1938\n\nComputers: Zuse Z1 (Germany, 1 OPS, first mechanical programmable binary computer, storage for a total of 64 numbers stored as 22 bit floating point numbers with 7-bit exponent, 15-bit signifocana [one implicit bit], and sign bit); Konrad Zuse called his floating point hardware semi-logarithmic notation and included the ability to handle infinity and undefined.\n\n1941\n\nComputers: Atanasoff-Berry Computer; Zuse Z3 (Germany, 20 OPS, added floating point exceptions, plus and minus infinity, and undefined)\n\n1942\n\nComputers: work started on Zuse Z4\n\n1943\n\nComputers: Harvard Mark I (U.S.); Colossus 1 (U.K., 5 kOPS)\n\n1944\n\nComputers: Colossus 2 (U.K., single processor, 25 kOPS); Harvard Mark II and AT&T Bell Labortories Model V (both relay computers) were the first American computers to include floating point hardware\n\n1945\n\nPlankalkül (Plan Calculus), created by Konrad Zuse for the Z3 computer in Nazi germany, may have been the first programming language (other than assemblers). This was a surprisingly advanced programming language, with many features that didnt appear again until the 1980s.\n\nComputers: Zuse Z4 (relay based computer, first commercial computer)\n\n1946\n\nComputers: UPenn Eniac (5 kOPS); Colossus 2 (parallel processor, 50 kOPS)\n\nTechnology: electrostatic memory\n\n1948\n\nComputers: IBM SSEC; Manchester SSEM\n\nTechnology: random access memory; magnetic drums; transistor\n\nTheory: Claude E. Shannon publishes A Mathematical Theory of Communication, including Shannons source coding theorem that establishes the limits to possible data compression.\n\n1949\n\nShort Code created in 1949. This programming language was compiled into machine code by hand.\n\nComputers: Manchester Mark 1\n\nTechnology: registers\n\n1951\n\nGrace Hopper starts work on A-0.\n\nComputers: Ferranti Mark 1 (first commercial computer); Leo I (frst business computer); UNIVAC I, Whirlwind\n\n1952\n\nAutocode, a symbolic assembler for the Manchester Mark I computer, was created in 1952 by Alick E. Glennie. Later used on other computers.\n\nA-0 (also known as AT-3), the first compiler, was created in 1952 by Grace Murray Hopper. She later created A-2, ARITH-MATIC, MATH-MATIC, and FLOW-MATIC, as well as being one of the leaders in the development of COBOL.Grace Hopper was working for Remington Rand at the time. Rand released the language as MATH-MATIC in 1957.\n\nAccording to some sources, first work started on FORTRAN.\n\nComputers: UNIVAC 1101; IBM 701\n\nGames: OXO (a graphic version of Tic-Tac-Toe created by A.S. Douglas on the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge to demonstrate ideas on human-computer interaction)\n\n1953\n\nComputers: Strela\n\n1954\n\nFORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator) was created in 1954 by John Backus and other researchers at International Business Machines (now IBM). Released in 1957. FORTRAN is the oldest programming language still in common use. Identifiers were limited to six characters. Elegant representation of mathematic expressions, as well as relatively easy input and output. FORTRAN was based on A-0.\n\nOften referred to as a scientific language, FORTRAN was the first high-level language, using the first compiler ever developed. Prior to the development of FORTRAN computer programmers were required to program in machine/assembly code, which was an extremely difficult and time consuming task, not to mention the dreadful chore of debugging the code. The objective during its design was to create a programming language that would be: simple to learn, suitable for a wide variety of applications, machine independent, and would allow complex mathematical expressions to be stated similarly to regular algebraic notation. While still being almost as efficient in execution as assembly language. Since FORTRAN was so much easier to code, programmers were able to write programs 500% faster than before, while execution efficiency was only reduced by 20%, this allowed them to focus more on the problem solving aspects of a problem, and less on coding.\n\nFORTRAN was so innovative not only because it was the first high-level language [still in use], but also because of its compiler, which is credited as giving rise to the branch of computer science now known as compiler theory. Several years after its release FORTRAN had developed many different dialects, (due to special tweaking by programmers trying to make it better suit their personal needs) making it very difficult to transfer programs from one machine to another. Neal Ziring, The Language Guide, University of Michigan\n\nSome of the more significant features of the language are listed below: Neal Ziring, The Language Guide, University of Michigan\n\nSimple to learn - when FORTRAN was design one of the objectives was to write a language that was easy to learn and understand.\n\nMachine Independent - allows for easy transportation of a program from one machine to another.\n\nMore natural ways to express mathematical functions - FORTRAN permits even severely complex mathematical functions to be expressed similarly to regular algebraic notation.\n\nProblem orientated language\n\nRemains close to and exploits the available hardware\n\nEfficient execution - there is only an approximate 20% decrease in efficiency as compared to assembly/machine code.\n\nAbility to control storage allocation -programmers were able to easily control the allocation of storage (although this is considered to be a dangerous practice today, it was quite important some time ago due to limited memory.\n\nMore freedom in code layout - unlike assembly/machine language, code does not need to be laid out in rigidly defined columns, (though it still must remain within the parameters of the FORTRAN source code form).\n\n42. You can measure a programmers perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of FORTRAN. Alan Perlis, Epigrams on Programming, ACMs SIGPLAN Notices Volume 17, No. 9, September 1982, pages 7-13\n\nComputers: IBM 650; IBM 704 (vacuum tube computer with floating point); IBM NORC (67 kOPS)\n\nTechnology: magnetic core memory\n\n1955\n\nOperating Systems: GMOS (General Motors OS for IBM 701)\n\nComputers: Harwell CADET\n\n1956\n\nResearchers at MIT begin experimenting with direct keyboard input into computers.\n\nIPL (Information Processing Language) was created in 1956 by A. Newell, H. Simon, and J.C. Shaw. IPL was a low level list processing language which implemented recursive programming.\n\nOperating Systems: GM-NAA I/O\n\nComputers: IBM 305 RAMAC; MIT TX-0 (83 kOPS)\n\nTechnology: hard disk\n\n1957\n\nMATH-MATIC was released by the Rand Corporation in 1957. The language was derived from Grace Murray Hoppers A-0.\n\nFLOW-MATIC, also called B-0, was created in 1957 by Grace Murray Hopper.\n\nThe first commercial FORTRAN program was run at Westinghouse. The first compile run produced a missing comma diagnostic. The second attempt was a success.\n\nThe U.S. government created the Advanced Research Project Group (ARPA) in esponse to the Soviet Unions launching of Sputnik. ARPA was intended to develop key technology that was too risky for private business to develop.\n\nComputers: IBM 608\n\nTechnology: dot matrix printer\n\n1958\n\nFORTRAN II in 1958 introduces subroutines, functions, loops, and a primitive For loop.\n\nIAL (International Algebraic Logic) started as the project later renamed ALGOL 58. The theoretical definition of the language is published. No compiler.\n\nLISP (LISt Processing) was created n 1958 and released in 1960 by John McCarthy of MIT. LISP is the second oldest programming language still in common use. LISP was intended for writing artificial intelligence programs.\n\nInterest in artificial intelligence first surfaced in the mid 1950. Linguistics, psychology, and mathematics were only some areas of application for AI. Linguists were concerned with natural language processing, while psychologists were interested in modeling human information and retrieval. Mathematicians were more interested in automating the theorem proving process. The common need among all of these applications was a method to allow computers to process symbolic data in lists.\n\nIBM was one of the first companies interested in AI in the 1950s. At the same time, the FORTRAN project was still going on. Because of the high cost associated with producing the first FORTRAN compiler, they decided to include the list processing functionality into FORTRAN. The FORTRAN List Processing Language (FLPL) was designed and implemented as an extention to FORTRAN.\n\nIn 1958 John McCarthy took a summer position at the IBM Information Research Department. He was hired to create a set of requirements for doing symbolic computation. The first attempt at this was differentiation of algebraic expressions. This initial experiment produced a list of of language requirements, most notably was recursion and conditional expressions. At the time, not even FORTRAN (the only high-level language in existance) had these functions.\n\nIt was at the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence that John McCarthy first developed the basics behind Lisp. His motivation was to develop a list processing language for Artificial Intelligence. By 1965 the primary dialect of Lisp was created (version 1.5). By 1970 special-purpose computers known as Lisp Machines, were designed to run Lisp programs. 1980 was the year that object-oriented concepts were integrated into the language. By 1986, the X3J13 group formed to produce a draft for ANSI Common Lisp standard. Finally in 1992, X3J13 group published the American National Standard for Common Lisp. Neal Ziring, The Language Guide, University of Michigan\n\nSome of the more significant features of the language are listed below: Neal Ziring, The Language Guide, University of Michigan\n\nAtoms & Lists - Lisp uses two different types of data structures, atoms and lists.\n\nAtoms are similar to identifiers, but can also be numeric constants\n\nLists can be lists of atoms, lists, or any combination of the two\n\nFunctional Programming Style - all computation is performed by applying functions to arguments. Variable declarations are rarely used.\n\nUniform Representation of Data and Code - example: the list (A B C D)\n\na list of four elements (interpreted as data)\n\nis the application of the function named A to the three parameters B, C, and D (interpreted as code)\n\nReliance on Recursion - a strong reliance on recursion has allowed Lisp to be successful in many areas, including Artificial Intelligence.\n\nGarbage Collection - Lisp has built-in garbage collection, so programmers do not need to explicitly free dynamically allocated memory.\n\n55. A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing. Alan Perlis, Epigrams on Programming, ACMs SIGPLAN Notices Volume 17, No. 9, September 1982, pages 7-13\n\nOperating Systems: UMES\n\nComputers: UNIVAC II; IBM AN/FSQ-7 (400 kOPS)\n\nGames:Tennis For Two (developed by William Higinnotham using an osciliscope and an analog computer)\n\nTechnology: integrated circuit\n\n1959\n\nCOBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) was created in May 1959 by the Short Range Committee of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The CODASYL committee (COnference on DAta SYstems Languages) worked from May 1959 to April 1960. Official ANSI standards included COBOL-68 (1968), COBOL-74 (1974), COBOL-85 (1985), and COBOL-2002 (2002). COBOL 97 (1997) introduced an object oriented version of COBOL. COBOL programs are divided into four divisions: identification, environment, data, and procedure. The divisions are further divided into sections. Introduced the RECORD data structure. Emphasized a verbose style intended to make it easy for business managers to read programs. Admiral Grace Hopper is recognized as the major contributor to the original COBOl language and as the inventor of compilers.\n\nLISP 1.5 released in 1959.\n\n DYNAMO is a computer program for translating mathematical models from an easy-to-understand notation into tabulated and plotted results. A model written in DYNAMO consists of a number of algebraic relationships that relate the variables one to another. Although similar to FORTRAN, it is easier to learn and understand. DYNAMO stands for DYNAmic MOdels. It was written by Dr. Phyllis Fox and Alexander L. Pugh, III, and was completed in 1959. It grew out of an earlier language called SIMPLE (for Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations), written in 1958 by Richard K. Bennett. Language Finger, Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library, University of Montana.\n\nERMA (Electronic Recording Method of Accounting), a magnetic ink and computer readable font, was created for the Bank of America.\n\nOperating Systems: SHARE\n\nComputers: IBM 1401\n\n1960\n\nALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language) was released in 1960. Major releases in 1960 (ALGOL 60) and 1968 (ALGOL 68). ALGOL is the first block-structured labguage and is considered to be the first second generation computer language. This was the first programming language that was designed to be machine independent. ALGOL introduced such concepts as: block structure of code (marked by BEGIN and END), scope of variables (local variables inside blocks), BNF (Backus Naur Form) notation for defining syntax, dynamic arrays, reserved words, IF THEN ELSE, FOR, WHILE loop, the := symbol for assignment, SWITCH with GOTOs, and user defined data types.

APL was intended for mathematical work and used its own special character set. Particularly good at matrix manipulation. In 1957 it introduced the array. APL used a special character set and required special keyboards, displays, and printers (or printer heads).\n\nFORTRAN IV is released in 1962.\n\nSimula was created by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard of the Norwegian Computing Center between 1962 and 1965. A compiler became available in 1964. Simula I and Simula 67 (1967) were the first object-oriented programming languages.\n\nSNOBOL (StroNg Oriented symBOli Language) was created in 1962 by D.J.
