        "text": "History of programming languages\n\nFor a detailed timeline of events, see\n\nTimeline of programming languages .\n\nThe earliest computers were programmed in Binary code.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEdit\n\nEven though a huge number of computer languages exist, the earliest computers were programmed in binary so the set of instructions was just a series of 0 and 1. Computer languages are a fairly new field, since the first high-level languages were written in the 1950s, around the time computers were invented. Computer programming languages were predated in turn by paper tapes and punch cards which held complicated weaving patterns for use in mechanized looms . Later, Charles Babbage started building a computer known as the Analytical Machine. In the 20th century, Herman Hollerith invented the Tabulating Machine. His machine tabulators were used to speed up the counting and sorting of punch cards. In the early 1940s J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly started building the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator), which was completed by 1946.\n\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalkül , created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945 [1] . The first high-level language to have an associated\n\ncompiler, was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was\n\nFORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation); developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by John Backus, a worker at IBM.\n\nWhen FORTRAN was first introduced it was treated with suspicion because of the belief that programs compiled from high-level language would be less efficient than those written directly in machine code. FORTRAN became popular because it provided a means of porting existing code to new computers, in a hardware market that was rapidly evolving. FORTRAN eventually became known for its efficiency. Over the years, FORTRAN had been updated, with standards released for FORTRAN-66, FORTRAN-77 and FORTRAN-92.\n\nEarly history\n\nEdit\n\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842–1843, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage ‘s newest proposed machine, the analytical engine . With the article she appended a set of notes which specified in complete detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by some historians as the world’s first computer program. [2]\n\nThe first computer codes were specialized for their applications. In the first decades of the 20th century, numerical calculations were based on decimal numbers. Eventually it was realized that logic could be represented with numbers, not only with words. For example, Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulatic way. The Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine, for example, in use at the telephone companies. Turing machines set the basis for storage of programs as data in the von Neumann architecture of computers by representing a machine through a finite number. However, unlike the lambda calculus, Turing’s code does not serve well as a basis for higher-level languages—its principal use is in rigorous analyses of\n\nalgorithmic complexity .\n\nTo some people, what was the first modern programming language depends on how much power and human-readability is required before the status of “programming language” is granted. Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage’s\n\nDifference Engine both had simple, extremely limited languages for describing the actions that these machines should perform.\n\nFirst programming languages\n\nEdit\n\nIn the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.\n\nThe first programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was\n\nPlankalkül , developed by the Germans for\n\nZ1 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000. [3]\n\nJohn Mauchly ‘s Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an\n\nelectronic computer . [4] Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into\n\nmachine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.\n\nAt the University of Manchester , Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s, with the second iteration developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954, known as the “Mark 1 Autocode”. Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory\n\nin 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances, and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development,\n\nAtlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.\n\nIn 1954, language FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high level general purpose programming language\n\nto have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. [5][6] It is still a popular language for high-performance computing [7] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world’s fastest supercomputers. [8]\n\nAnother early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called\n\nFLOW-MATIC . It was developed for the\n\nUNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype. [9] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959. [10] Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL , since only it and its direct descendent AIMACO were in actual use at the time.[11]\n\nOther languages still in use today include\n\nLISP (1958), invented by John McCarthy and COBOL (1959), created by the Short Range Committee. Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of “a new language for algorithms”; the ALGOL 60 Report (the “ALGOrithmic L anguage”). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations:\n\nnested block structure: code sequences and associated declarations could be grouped into\n\nblocks without having to be turned into separate, explicitly named procedures;\n\nlexical scoping : a block could have its own private variables, procedures and functions, invisible to code outside that block, that is, information hiding.\n\nAnother innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described:\n\na mathematically exact notation,\n\nBackus–Naur form (BNF), was used to describe the language’s syntax. Nearly all subsequent programming languages have used a variant of BNF to describe the context-free portion of their syntax.\n\nAlgol 60 was particularly influential in the design of later languages, some of which soon became more popular. The\n\nBurroughs large systems were designed to be programmed in an extended subset of Algol.\n\nAlgol’s key ideas were continued, producing ALGOL 68 :\n\nsyntax and semantics became even more orthogonal, with anonymous routines, a recursive typing system with higher-order functions, etc.;\n\nnot only the context-free part, but the full language syntax and semantics were defined formally, in terms of Van Wijngaarden grammar , a formalism designed specifically for this purpose.\n\nAlgol 68’s many little-used language features (for example, concurrent and parallel blocks) and its complex system of syntactic shortcuts and automatic type coercions made it unpopular with implementers and gained it a reputation of being difficult. Niklaus Wirth actually walked out of the design committee to create the simpler Pascal language.\n\nFortran\n\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\n\n1951 – Regional Assembly Language\n\n1952 – Autocode\n\n1954 – IPL (forerunner to LISP)\n\n1955 – FLOW-MATIC (led to COBOL)\n\n1957 – FORTRAN (First compiler)\n\n1957 – COMTRAN (precursor to COBOL)\n\n1958 – LISP\n\n1958 – ALGOL 58\n\n1959 – FACT (forerunner to COBOL)\n\n1959 – COBOL\n\n1959 – RPG\n\n1962 – APL\n\n1962 – Simula\n\n1962 – SNOBOL\n\n1963 – CPL (forerunner to C)\n\n1964 – Speakeasy (computational environment)\n\n1964 – BASIC\n\n1964 – PL/I\n\n1966 – JOSS\n\n1967 – BCPL (forerunner to C)\n\nEstablishing fundamental paradigms\n\nEdit\n\nSmalltalk\n\nScheme\n\nThe period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:\n\nSpeakeasy (computational environment)\n\n, developed in 1964 at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) by Stanley Cohen , is an OOPS (object-oriented programming , much like the later\n\nMATLAB , IDL (programming language) and Mathematica) numerical package. Speakeasy has a clear Fortran foundation syntax. It first addressed efficient physics computation internally at ANL, was modified for research use (as “Modeleasy”) for the\n\nFederal Reserve Board in the early 1970s and then was made available commercially; Speakeasy and Modeleasy are still in use currently.\n\nSimula , invented in the late 1960s by\n\nNygaard and Dahl as a superset of Algol 60, was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming .\n\nC, an early systems programming language, was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973.\n\nSmalltalk (mid-1970s) provided a complete ground-up design of an object-oriented language.\n\nProlog, designed in 1972 by\n\nColmerauer , Roussel , and Kowalski, was the first logic programming language.\n\nML built a polymorphic type system (invented by Robin Milner in 1973) on top of Lisp, [12] pioneering statically typed functional programming languages.\n\nEach of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of “structured programming “, which essentially meant programming without the use of “goto”. A significant fraction of programmers believed that, even in languages that provide “goto”, it is bad\n\nprogramming style to use it except in rare circumstances. This debate was closely related to language design: some languages did not include a “goto” at all, which forced structured programming on the programmer.\n\nTo provide even faster compile times, some languages were structured for “one-pass compilers ” which expect subordinate routines to be defined first, as with\n\nPascal, where the main routine, or driver function, is the final section of the program listing.\n\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\n\n1968 – Logo\n\n1969 – B (forerunner to C)\n\n1970 – Pascal\n\n1970 – Forth\n\n1972 – C\n\n1972 – Smalltalk\n\n1972 – Prolog\n\n1973 – ML\n\n1975 – Scheme\n\n1978 – SQL (a query language, later extended)\n\n1980s: consolidation, modules, performance\n\nEdit\n\nMATLAB\n\nErlang\n\nTcl\n\nThe 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages . Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Research in\n\nMiranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation , began to take hold in this decade.\n\nOne important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of modules , or large-scale organizational units of code.\n\nModula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s. Module systems were often wedded to\n\ngeneric programming constructs—generics being, in essence, parametrized modules [citation needed] (see also\n\npolymorphism in object-oriented programming\n\n).\n\nAlthough major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts. For example, the languages of the Argus and\n\nEmerald systems adapted object-oriented programming to distributed systems .\n\nThe 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation. The RISC movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather than for human assembly programmers. Aided by processor speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compilation techniques, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compilation technology for high-level languages.\n\nLanguage technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s.\n\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\n\n1980 – C++ (as C with classes, renamed in 1983)\n\n1983 – Ada\n\n1984 – Common Lisp\n\n1984 – MATLAB\n\n1984 – dBase III, dBase III Plus (Clipper and FoxPro as FoxBASE , later developing into Visual FoxPro\n\n1985 – Eiffel\n\n1986 – Objective-C\n\n1986 – LabVIEW (Visual Programming Language)\n\n1986 – Erlang\n\n1987 – Perl\n\n1988 – Tcl\n\n1988 – Wolfram Language (as part of Mathematica , only got a separate name in June 2013)\n\n1989 – FL (Backus)\n\n1990s: the Internet age\n\nEdit\n\nHaskell\n\nLua\n\nPHP\n\nRebol\n\nThe rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in\n\nimperative languages , but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of\n\nfunctional languages . A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. Many “rapid application development” (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an IDE , garbage collection , and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were\n\nobject-oriented . These included Object Pascal, Visual Basic , and Java. Java in particular received much attention.\n\nMore radical and innovative than the RAD languages were the new scripting languages . These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features. Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain. [ citation needed] Nevertheless, scripting languages came to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web.\n\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\n\n1990 – Haskell\n\n1991 – Python\n\n1991 – Visual Basic\n\n1993 – Lua\n\n1993 – R\n\n1994 – CLOS (part of ANSI Common Lisp)\n\n1995 – Ruby\n\n1995 – Ada 95\n\n1995 – Java\n\n1995 – Delphi (Object Pascal)\n\n1995 – JavaScript\n\n1995 – PHP\n\n1997 – Rebol\n\nCurrent trends\n\nEdit\n\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Some of the recent trends have included:\n\nD Programming Language\n\nGroovy\n\nRust\n\nScratch\n\nSwift\n\nIncreasing support for functional programming in mainstream languages used commercially, including pure functional programming for making code easier to reason about and easier to parallelise (at both micro- and macro- levels)\n\nConstructs to support concurrent and\n\ndistributed programming.\n\nMechanisms for adding security and reliability verification to the language: extended static checking, dependent typing, information flow control, static\n\nthread safety .\n\nAlternative mechanisms for composability and modularity: mixins,\n\ntraits , delegates , aspects.\n\nComponent-oriented software development.\n\nMetaprogramming , reflection or access to the abstract syntax tree\n\nAOP or Aspect Oriented Programming allowing developers to insert code in another module or class at “join points”\n\nDomain specific languages and\n\ncode generation\n\nXML for graphical interface (XUL , XAML )\n\nIncreased interest in distribution and mobility.\n\nIntegration with databases, including\n\nXML and relational databases .\n\nOpen source as a developmental philosophy for languages, including the GNU Compiler Collection and languages such as Python , Ruby , and\n\nScala .\n\nMassively parallel languages for coding 2000 processor GPU graphics processing units and supercomputer arrays including OpenCL\n\nEarly research into (as-yet-unimplementable) quantum computing programming languages\n\nMore interest in visual programming languages like Scratch\n\nSome notable languages developed during this period include:\n\n2000 – ActionScript\n\n2001 – C#\n\n2001 – D\n\n2002 – Scratch\n\n2003 – Groovy\n\n2003 – Scala\n\n2005 – F#\n\n2006 – PowerShell\n\n2007 – Clojure\n\n2009 – Go\n\n2010 – Rust\n\n2011 – Dart\n\n2011 – Kotlin\n\n2011 – Red\n\n2011 – Elixir\n\n2012 – Julia\n\n2014 – Swift\n\nProminent people\n\nEdit\n\nAnders Hejlsberg\n\nYukihiro Matsumoto\n\nGrace M.
