        "text": "<strong>Konrad</strong> Zuse’s Plankalkül: The First High-Level, “non von Neumann” Programming Language WOLFGANG K. GILOI <strong>Konrad</strong> Zuse was the first person in history to build a working digital computer, a fact that is still not generally acknowledged. Even less known is that in the years 1943–1945, Zuse developed a high-level programming model and, based on it, an algorithmic programming language called Plankalkül (plan calculus). The Plankalkül features binary data structure types, thus supporting a loop-free programming style for logical or relational problems. As a language for numerical applications, the Plankalkül already had the essential features of a “von Neumann language,” though at the level of an operator language. Consequently, the Plankalkül is in some aspects equivalent and in others more powerful than the von Neumann programming model that came to dominate programming for a long time. To find language concepts similar to those of the Plankalkül, one has to look at “non von Neumann languages” such as APL or the relational algebra. This paper conveys the syntactic and semantic flavor of the Plankalkül, without intending to present all its syntactic idiosyncrasies. Rather, it tries to point out that the Plankalkül was not only the first high-level programming language but in some aspects conceptually ahead of the high-level languages that evolved a decade later. To <strong>Konrad</strong> Zuse In Memoriam This paper is the revised version of a laudation rendered by the author at the celebration of Zuse’s 80th birthday at his alma mater, the Technical University of Berlin. 1058-6180/97/$10.00 ” 1997 IEEE Introduction e know <strong>Konrad</strong> Zuse (Fig. 1) as an engineer who started W developing program-controlled binary calculators from 1936 onward and completed the first fully operational digital computer in 1941. Zuse received the inspiration to use the binary number system from the Dyadik of G.W. Leibniz (1646–1716), realizing that the functions his binary machines had to perform could be described by logical expressions. This triggered in him a strong interest not only in propositional calculus but in mathematical logic in general. 1 Through Brian Randell’s book, 2 an English translation of Zuse’s first patent application of 1936 has become more widely known, proving that Zuse had already developed many of the major concepts of the digital computer years before John von Neumann, Arthur Burks, and Herman Goldstine wrote their famous report Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument. 3 However, Zuse’s vision of digital machines and their potential capabilities went beyond the purely sequential computer that is known to this day under the name “von Neumann machine.” For example, the possibility of array processing and even of parallel processing is already mentioned in his patent application of 1936. 2 His first machine, called the Z1, was a mechanical digital computer. It was the size of a pool table and featured mechanical binary logic and flip–flop memory. Its arithmetic unit worked with a “semilogarithmic” or floating-point number representation that Zuse invented. The original Z1 did not survive the World War II air raids on Berlin. By initiative of the German National Research Center for Information Technology (GMD) and with contributions from the industry, two students and a mechanic under Zuse’s supervision built a replica in 1988–1989 using his original documentation. The replica was installed at the Museum of Technology in Berlin in 1989. It proves that the civil engineer Zuse was, among his other talents, an ingenious designer of mechanical hardware. Zuse began building the Z1 in 1936 and completed it in 1938. The mechanical arithmetic logic unit of the Z1 had some problems: Under certain conditions, it would get jammed and had to be reset (the replica emulates—unintentionally—even that feature). In 1938, while he was having a hard time making his mechanical design work, he started designing a second machine, the Z2. The arithmetic logic unit of the Z2 employed telephone relays instead of mechanical switches, while the memory still consisted of mechanical flip– flops. Its successor, the Z3 (1939–1941), was completely a relay IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol. 19, No. 2, 1997 ∑ 17"
