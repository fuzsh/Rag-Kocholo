This document provides an agenda and overview of a lecture on the evolution of major programming languages. It discusses early languages like Zuse's Plankalk√ºl, Fortran for the IBM 704, and LISP for artificial intelligence. It also covers influential languages like ALGOL 60, COBOL for business, BASIC for education, and PL/I which tried to serve multiple domains. Later languages discussed include SIMULA 67 which introduced object-oriented concepts, ALGOL 68's orthogonal design, and Pascal's influence on education.",
