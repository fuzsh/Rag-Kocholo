        "text": "REVIEW QUESTION\n\n1. In what year was Plankalkul designed? In what year was that design published?\n\nPlankalkul was designed by Konrad Zuse between 1942 & 1945. He first published a paper on it in 1948. More information on the language was published in 1972.\n\n2. Mention an intereseting feature of Zuse’s programs.\n\nOne of the interesting feature of Zuse’s programs is the inclusion of mathematical expressions showing the current relationships between program variables.\n\n3. What does Plankalkul mean?\n\nPlankalkul means program calculus.\n\n4. Speedcoding was invented to overcome two significant shortcomings of the computer hardware of the early 1950s. What were they ?\n\nThe first hardware shortcoming was the lack of floating point hardware. The second was the lack was automatic incrementing address registers.\n\n5. What is the number of bits in a single word of the UNIVAC I’s memory? How are the bits grouped?\n\nThe number of bits is 72. It is grouped into 12 parts which contains 6 bit bytes each.\n\n6. What hardware capability that first appeared in the IBM 704 computer strongly affected the evolution of programming languages ? Explain why.\n\nIts capabilities prompted the development of Fortran because it was able to support floating-point operations hardware.\n\n7. Who developed the Speedcoding system for the IBM 701 ?\n\nThe speedcoding was developed by John Backus.\n\n8. Who developed Short Code? Why is Short Code called automatic programming?\n\nThe shortcode was developed by John Mauchly in 1949. Short Code is called automatic programming because Short Code was not\n\ntranslated to machine code, it was implemented with a pure interpreter.\n\n10. What was the most significant feature added to Fortran I to get Fortran II?\n\nIndependent-compilation capability\n\n11. What control flow statements were added to Fortran IV to get Fortran 77?\n\nlogical loop statements and IF with an optional ELSE\n\n12. Which version of Fortran was the first to have any sort of dynamic variables?\n\nFortran 90\n\n13. Which version of Fortran was the first to have character string handling?\n\nFortran 77\n\n14. Why were linguists interested in artificial intelligence in the late 1950s?\n\nLinguists were concerned with natural language processing.\n\n15. What are the different data types and structures in Common LISP?\n\nCommon LISP has a large number of data types and structures, including records, arrays, complex number, and character strings. It also has a form of packages for modularizing collection of function and data providing access control.\n\n16. In what way are scheme and Common LISP opposites of each other?\n\nCommon LISP allows for static scoping and dynamic scoping Scheme only uses static scoping. Scheme is relatively small while Common LISP is large and complex.\n\n17. What dialect of LISP is used for introductory programming courses at some universities?\n\nScheme\n\n18. What two professional organizations together designed ALGOL 60?\n\nACM and GAMM\n\n19. What was the goal for developing C?\n\nC has adequate control statements and data-sructuring facilities to allow its use in many application areas. It alse has a rich set of operators that provide a high degree of expressiveness.\n\n20. What were the significant modifications to ALGOL 58 to produce ALGOL 60?\n\nThe concept of block structure was introduced, two different means of passing parameters to subprograms were allowed, procedures were allowed to be recursive, stack-dynamic arrays were allowed.\n\n21. What language was designed to describe the syntax of ALGOL 60?\n\nBNF\n\n22. On what language was COBOL based?\n\nFLOW-MATIC\n\n23. In what year did the COBOL design process begin?\n\n1959\n\n24. What data structure that appeared in COBOL originated with Plankalkul?\n\nHierarchical data structures (records)\n\n25. What organization was most responsible for the early success of COBOL (in terms of extent of use)?\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD)\n\n27. Why was BASIC an important language in the early 1980s?\n\nIts smaller dialects could be implemented on computers with very small memories\n\n28. PL/I was designed to replace what two languages?\n\nCOBOL and Fortran\n\n29. For what new line of computers was PL/I designed?\n\nthe IBM system/360 line of computers\n\n30. What features of SIMULA 67 are now important parts of some object-oriented languages?\n\nData abstraction\n\n31. What innovation of data structuring was introduced in ALGOL 68 but is often credited to Pascal?\n\nUser-defined data types\n\n32. What design criterion was used extensively in ALGOL 68?\n\nOrthogonality\n\n33. What language introduced the case statement?\n\nThe case statement was introduced in ALGOL-W, a version of ALGOL 60 created by Niklaus Wirth and C. A. R. (Tony) Hoare.\n\n34. What operators in C were modeled on similar operators in ALGOL 68?\n\nfor and switch statements, in its assigning operators, and in its treatment of pointer\n\n35. What are two characteristics of C that make it less safe than Pascal?\n\nLack of complete type checking and flexibility\n\n37. What are the two kinds of statements that populate a Prolog database?\n\nThe statements that populate a Prolog database are called facts and rules.\n\n38. What is the primary application area for which Ada was designed?\n\nEmbedded systems\n\n39. What are the concurrent program units of ada called?\n\ntasks (using the rendezvous mechanism)\n\n42. What three concepts are the basis for object-oriented programming\n\nClasses, objects and methods\n\n43. Why does C++ include the features of Ada that are known to be unsafe?\n\nA goal of Ada was that it could be used for which Ada could be used, so virtually none of the features of Ada would be removed, not even those considered to be unsafe.\n\n44. From what language does Objective-C borrow its syntax for method calls?\n\nSmalltalk language.\n\n45. What programming paradigm that nearly all recently designed languages support is not supported by Go?\n\nDoesn’t support traditional object-oriented programming, as it has no form of inheritance.\n\nPROBLEM SET\n\n1. What features of Fortran IV do you think would have had the greatest influence on Javaif the Java designers had been familiar with Fortran?\n\nLogical data type – boolean, used mainly for the control expressions of itscontrol statements (such as if and while).We can create simple version of the complex compile, and link processes of earlier compilers.\n\n2. Determine the capabilities of Short Code, and compare them with those of a contemporary programmable hand calculator.\n\nShort Code is capable of making multiplication without multiplication code needed, just put two operands side-by-side.Besides, it also uses pure interpreter to run itself.Short Code consists of coded version of mathematical expression that was to be evaluated.Contemporary programmable calculator was able to do multiplication with its embedded programming language. People can solve arithmetic problem easier than using the Short Code but it is more difficult to do further improvement to the programmable hand calculator than to the Sort Code."
