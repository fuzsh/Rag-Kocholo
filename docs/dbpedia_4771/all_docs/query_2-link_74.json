        "text": "This chapter surveys the various kinds of universal language that have existed throughout history and their relationship with translation. Up to and beyond the Early Modern period, debates on the subject tended to be couched in mystical or religious terms, and were concerned primarily with rediscovering languages postulated as original or perfect, considered to be embodiments of God’s creation. Then from the 17th century, attention turned to the need for a global language that could serve as a vehicle for science, trade and education, and foster world peace. This led to the development of, first, philosophical languages, such as those proposed by Dalgarno, Wilkins and Leibniz, which involved the a priori construction of philosophical grammars of supposedly universal concepts that were then used to generate a range of invented terms; and then to the International Auxiliary Languages of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g Volapük, Esperanto and Ido), based on natural languages rather than created from scratch. Today, discussions tend to centre around perennial questions relating to linguistic universals and/or political and practical matters arising from the role of English as lingua franca of the globalized world.\n\nThe main objective of the present dissertation was to evaluate the applicability of the theory and practice developed within the methodological framework of the so-called Ethnolinguistic School of Lublin to the linguistic analysis of artificial languages and to present the limitations of such an approach. The following research conclusions were formulated: 1. Artificial languages are not a homogeneous group, and their various characteristics necessitate different perspectives in the application of the Lublin paradigm. 2. The binary division between artificial and natural languages is disproved; a scale of naturalness/artificiality is proposed. 3. The language which may be treated as natural within the Ethnolinguistic School of Lublin is undoubtedly Esperanto. 4. Any study of artificial languages within this paradigm needs to take into account a transfer from other languages known to the respondents as well as cultural influences. The existence of a linguistic worldview typical of Esperanto and presented consistently in the following areas was proved: • cultural concepts related to the Movement • stereotype of an Esperantist.\n\nProgramming languages are often characterised proceeding from the paradigm they are intended to support { imperative, functional, logic, object-oriented, parallel , real-time, distributed, event-driven etc. Independently from the paradigm there exist some other important aspects of the language design and implementation like user interface of the system, choice of integrated tools, support to incremen-tal development, whether the system is interpretive or compiles into some external representation (machine code, assembly language, higher level language), support to standalone application development (incl. GUI development), portability, exten-sibility, compatibility with diierent standards and platforms etc. These additional qualities may appear in concrete implementation but may also be a part of the language itself. This paper focuses on language extensibility that is the notion with wide range of interpretations. Authors opinions are based on experience of using and teaching the \"minor languages\" Forth 2] and Tcl/Tk 6] as well as \"traditional\" ones 4]. The rst part gives a short overview about the evolution of diierent types of extensibility. The second part is devoted to the problems of implementation of extensible languages. The third part contains some remarks on programming in extensible languages. As a conclusion some similarities between extensible languages and the language of mathematics are outlined: Freedom to create abstractions and notations to express these abstractions. The language itself is not \"high level\" or \"low level\" { it is always on the level of the Creator.\n\nThis book evaluates the applicability of the linguistic worldview framework to the analysis of artificial languages and presents the limitations of such an approach. The following research conclusions were formulated: 1. Artificial languages are not a homogeneous group, and their various characteristics necessitate different perspectives in the application of the framework. 2. The binary division between artificial and natural languages is disproved; a scale of naturalness/artificiality is proposed. 3. The language which may be treated as natural is undoubtedly Esperanto. 4. Any study of artificial languages within this framework needs to take into account transfer from other languages known to the respondents as well as cultural influences. The existence of a linguistic worldview typical of Esperanto and presented consistently in the following areas was proved: cultural concepts related to the Movement and stereotype of an Esperantist.\n\nTo some extent, the early twentieth century revival of universal languages was the work of logicians and mathematicians. Pioneers of modern logic such as Frege, Russell and Peano wanted to overcome the diversity and deficiencies of natural languages. Through the rigour of formal logic, they aimed at providing scientific thinking with a reliable medium free from the ambiguity and inconsistencies of ordinary language. This article shows some interconnections between modern logic and the search for a common tongue that would unite scientists and people of all nations. The French mathematician and philosopher Louis Couturat is a key figure in understanding the interplay between these two movements. Through his work in composing the Ido language as an alternative to Esperanto, Couturat gave a new life to the Leibnizian idea of a universal characteristics. In addition, his multifaceted work provides a valuable insight into some political implications of early analytic philosophy."
