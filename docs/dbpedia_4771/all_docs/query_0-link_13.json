        "text": "1. In what year was Plankalkul designed? In what year was the design\n\npublished?\n\nPlankalkul was designed by Konrad Zuse between 1942 & 1945. He first published a paper on it in 1948. More information on the language was published in 1972.\n\n3. What does Plankalkul mean?\n\nPlankalkul means program calculus..\n\n4. Speedcoding was invented to overcome two significant shortcomings of\n\nthe computer hardware of the early 1950s. What were they?\n\nIBM 701 and UNIVAC 1107.\n\n5. What is the number of bits in a single word of the UNIVAC I’s memory?\n\nHow are the bits grouped?\n\nThe words of the UNIVAC I’s memory had 72bits, grouped as 12 six-bit bytes.\n\n7. Who developed the Speedcoding system for the IBM 701?\n\nThe language was developed by John Backus in 1953 for the IBM 701 to support computation with floating point numbers.\n\n8.Who developed Short Code? Why is short code called automatic programming?\n\nShort Code was proposed by John Mauchly in 1949 and originally known as Brief Code. William Schmitt implemented a version of Brief Code in 1949 for the BINAC computer, though it was never debugged and tested.\n\n9. Under what environmental consideration was fortran developed? Which is the first version of fortran?\n\nOriginally developed by IBM at their campus in south San Jose, California[1] in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, and the first version was fortran 0\n\n10. What was the most significant feature added to Fortran I to get Fortran II?\n\nThe most important is being the independent compilation of subroutines.\n\n11. What control flow statements were added to Fortran II to get Fortran 77?\n\nCharacter string handling, logical loop control statements, and an “if” with an optional “else” clause.\n\n12. Which version of Fortran was the first to have any sort of dynamic\n\nvariables?\n\nFortran 90.\n\n13. Which version of Fortran was the first to have character string handling?\n\nFortran 77.\n\n14. Why were linguists interested inartificial intelligence in the late 1950s?\n\nLinguists were concerned with natural language processing, such as psychology and mathematics. Psychologists were interested in modeling human information storage and retrieval, Mathematicians were interested in mechanizing certain intelligent processes, such as theorem proving.\n\n15. What are the different data types and structures in Common LISP?\n\nCommon LISP has a large number of data types and structures, including records, arrays, complex number, and character strings. It also has a form of packages for modularizing collection of function and data providing access control.\n\n16. In what way are scheme and Common LISP opposites of each other?\n\nIn its sizes, complexity, adn scoping(scheme: static scoping, Common LISP: both dynamic and static scoping).\n\n18. What two professional organizations together designed ALGOL 60?\n\nGAMM and ACM(Association for Computing Machinery).\n\n19. What was the goal for developing C?\n\nC has adequate control statements and data-sructuring facilities to allow its use in many application areas. It also has a rich set of operators that provide a high degree of expressiveness.\n\n20. What were the significant modifications to ALGOL 58 to produce ALGOL\n\n60?\n\nThe concept of block structure was introduced, two different means of passing parameters to subprograms were allowed, procedures were allowed to be recursive, stack-dynamic arrays were allowed.\n\n21. What language was designed to describe the syntax of ALGOL 60?\n\nCOBOL.\n\n22. On what language was COBOL based?\n\nCommon Business Language (CBL).\n\n23. In what year did the COBOL design process begin?\n\n1959.\n\n26. Which data type does the original BASIC language support?\n\nFloating-point.\n\n27. Why was BASIC an important language in the early 1980s?\n\nBecause BASIC is the one which was the first widely used language that was used through terminals connected to a remote computer.\n\n28. PL/I was designed to replace what two languages?\n\nPL/I was designed to replace Fortran and COBOL.\n\n33. What language “case” statement?\n\nALGOL-W.\n\nPROBLEM SET\n\n1. What features of Fortran IV do you think would have had the greatest\n\ninfluence on Java if the Java designer had been familiar with Fortran?\n\nThe logical loop control statements, and an “if” with an optional “else” caluse.\n\n3. Write a short history of the Fortran 0, Fortran I, Fortran II, Fortran IV\n\nsystem.\n\nFortran 0 was modified during the implementation period, which began in January 1955 and continued until the release of the compiler in April 1957. The implemented language, which we call Fortran I, is described in the first Fortran Programmer’s Reference Manual.\n\nFortran I included input/output formatting, variable names of up to 6 chars(it had been just 2 in Fortran0), user-defined subroutines, although they could not be separately compiled, the If selection statement and the Do loop statement.\n\nFortran II compiler was distributed in the spring of 1958. It fixed many of the bugs in the Fortran I compilation system and added some significant features to the language, the most important being the independent compilation subroutines.\n\nFortran III was developed, but it was never widely distributed.\n\nFortran IV, however, became one of the most widely used programming languages of its time. It evolved over the period 1960 to 1962 and was standardized as Fortran 66, although that name was rarely used.\n\n6. Make an educated guess as to the most common syntax error in C programs.\n\nMost common syntax error in C programs are missing semicolon at the end of statement, uninitialized variable, missing ‘&’ when using scanf, missing library, calling function with invalid arguments, etc.\n\n9. Why, in your opinion, did Fortran allow names that began with I, J, K, L, M\n\nand N as implicitly integer type?\n\nThe choice of the letters for this convention was based on the fact that at that time scientists and engineers used letters as variables subscripts, usually i, j, and k, and then Fortran’s designers threw in the three additional letters.\n\n13. What is the primary reason why C became more widely used than\n\nFortran?\n\nThe reasons why C is more popular than Fortran : compilers are universally available for all the main architectures in use, and a good public compiler also exists. C compilers often come free with machines, while Fortran 90 compilers Efficient must be purchased, and often expensive.\n\nC is very broad in scope, and is more powerful of Fortran 90 in some areas, such as pointers, and manipulations of strings of characters. Acquired coding experience can be directly used outside the scientific world : C is very common in commercial world."
