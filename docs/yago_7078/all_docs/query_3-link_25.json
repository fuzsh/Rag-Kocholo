        "text": "Not that it matters but I just want to say on the record that the first time I saw this when I was 17 or so that I knew nothing of it's controversy or anything about Victor Salva as a person. I say \"not that it matters\" only to stress that my reaction to this film didn't change after I learned what a disgusting human being he is. It terrified me then, it terrifies me now. I'm not afraid to admit that this HORROR film is just that, a horror film and an affective one at that. The experience is unsettling, and now we all know why. A monster movie made by a real life monster. The predatorial nature of…\n\nKeyword: Circus/Clown\n\nUgh, ew, no. This movie is so asinine I got next to no enjoyment watching through this shit.\n\nThree brothers go to the local carnival. Unbeknownst to them three men from an institution for the criminally insane also wanted to go to said carnival. When they are the denied this privilege they go on a rampage. They kill three clowns and take their costumes and then the two groups of three cross paths. Shenanigans ensue.\n\nI could see this movie being fun to goof on with the friends but watching this alone was not a particularly enjoyable experience. A big reason for that was the fact that despite how inherently silly the premise of this movie is they…\n\n\"Where the crazy people live?\" - I added a question mark to be funny!\n\n- Daily Horror Hunt #5 (Nov. '18): boxd.it/2908Q\n\nDAY EIGHTEEN: A creepy clown movie.\n\nI found this by typing creepy clown movie into google and picking the creepiest poster I hadn't seen so I sincerely had no idea that this was that movie where that thing happened or I probably would've picked something else. Sam Rockwell is apparently putting a lot of work into distancing himself from this film since he is billed as fourteenth but should at worst be listed third.\n\nOh...the film. I thought it was just fine. There are a lot of creepy shots in the last twenty minutes that almost made me…\n\nToday I wanted to take a break from my usual reviews, and talk about something different. Victor Salva is without a doubt the most sickening, disturbing, depraved, most awful human being to ever work in Hollywood and he should be in prison! But I still do love Jeepers Creepers because it’s a movie I grew up watching in my teen years. But since the Harvey Weinstein and Jeffery Epstein scandals popped up with these people telling horrific stories about their abusive nature, he’s not likely going to work in Hollywood again.\n\nBut one of his movies that I want to talk about is Clownhouse, the controversial film that centered on one of the child actors being sexually abused by its…\n\nDeep breath...\n\nI remember, in high school, seeing this tape on the shelves of my local Blockbuster and thinking \"oh, that looks creepy... I need to rent that some time.\" But I never got around to it, and eventually that store closed.\n\nJeepers Creepers appeared on my radar because of Fangoria. I ended up seeing it because the Clive Barker quotation on the DVD cover art sold me. I thought it was pretty cool. When the sequel came out, I saw that, too. I remember thinking it wasn't as good.\n\nIt was not until after seeing those two movies that I learned about Victor Salva's dark history. I didn't feel the need to watch Jeepers Creepers again for a number…\n\nI watched this over a week ago and have tried to simply form in my mind the words to begin to talk about it. Which means addressing the controversy as well as people talking about it.\n\nI don't have that time anymore. I may have more long reviews like I used to write in me somewhere but time for us and the world we're living in is growing shorter at an alarming rate.\n\nSo, for anyone interested in what I have to say now, after rewatching this film, I'll try to break it down into a few thoughts I hope are relevant:\n\n1. Nothing is more important to bear in mind than what Hollie Horror expressed in regard to the…"
