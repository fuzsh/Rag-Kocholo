        "text": "‘Everyone loathes a clown.’\n\n100 Tears is a 2007 American independent black comedy slasher horror film directed by Marcus Koch (Rot; Snuff Perversions: Bizarre Cases of Death). It stars Georgia Chris, Joe Davison (who also produced the film), Jack Amos, and Raine Brown, and was distributed by Anthum Pictures with an NC-17 rating. An extended director’s cut was released on DVD by Unearthed Films on 22 July 2014.\n\nPlot teaser:\n\nAfter being accused of sex crimes he did not commit, a lonely circus clown known onstage as Gurdy (Jack Amos) exacts his revenge on those who unjustly condemned him. The act sparks something inside of him which he cannot stop and now, years later, his inner-demons have truly surfaced. Part urban legend, part tabloid sensationalism… he is now an unstoppable murderous juggernaut, fuelled only by hate.\n\nAnd worse, when two tabloid reporters (Georgia Chris and Joe Davison) attempt to hunt him down, they find themselves trapped in his warehouse, hunted by him and his conniving daughter (Raine Brown), who already has a deceptive plan up her sleeve. It’s a gory, horrifying fight for their lives with no telling who will emerge alive…\n\nBuy Extended Director’s Cut on DVD from Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk\n\nReviews:\n\n“The great thing about the movie is that it wastes no time in killing off a whole bunch of people, with our killer clown offing the entire population of a halfway house in the first ten minutes. And this isn’t some off-screen massacre – we see every one of the kills in their splatter-y glory, with numerous beheadings and eviscerations to applaud. It’s a perfect way to start off this sort of movie, but what makes it admirable is that it hasn’t blown its wad – there are still about twice as many on-screen kills to go!” Horror Movie a Day\n\n“I’ve actually been racking my brain all day trying to think of that one tiny speck of coolness I liked about it and I came up with a big fat NOTHING!!! Yes, it’s way over the top gory (which is how I like my horror flicks) with victims getting beheaded, strangled with their own insistence and limbs cut off at every turn. In the first ten minutes alone, eight people get killed in bloody and gruesome ways but the F/Xs are done so badly and that it takes all the fun out of it.” Sfipress\n\n“100 Tears worked because it really had a nice balance of blood-splattering gore and quick one-liners delivered with witty humor …The throbbing techno/industrial soundtrack really added some intensity to the scenes involving Gurdy the Clown as he hacked and chopped his victims with his over-sized meat cleaver in bloody fashion. But, I have to point out that the intro to the film had a very Leonard Cohen-esque sound to it, mixed in with a bit of carnival/circus music” Bryan “Shu” Schuessler, Horror Society\n\nCast:\n\nJack Amos as Gurdy the Clown\n\nGeorgia Chris as Jennifer Stevenson\n\nJoe Davison as Mark Web\n\nRaine Brown as Christine Greaston\n\nKibwe Dorsey as Detective Spaulding\n\nRod Grant as Detective Dunkin\n\nNorberto Santiago as Drago Villette\n\nJerry Allen as Ed Purdy\n\nJeff Dylan Graham as Jack Arlo\n\nKrystal Badia as Jill Bryner\n\nLeslie Ann Crytzer as Tracy Greaston\n\nJori Davison as Roxanna\n\nBrad Rhodes as Ralphio the Strongman\n\nRegina Ramirez as Bookstore Patron\n\nClayton Smith as Young Gurdy\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\nRequiem for a Vampire – original title: Requiem pour un Vampire – is a 1971 French erotic horror film written and directed by Jean Rollin.\n\nIt was apparently the favourite of all of the director’s own films because he came up with the scenario from his subconscious, and because it was rushed into its written form so quickly (Rollin claimed that he wrote the entire script in only two days), he felt it was his purest work. For its US release, Harry Novak’s Boxoffice International retitled it Caged Virgins.\n\nPlot teaser:\n\nTwo women dressed as clowns and a male driver are being chased through the countryside, for unknown reasons. As the man drives, the women shoot at their pursuers. When the man is shot, the women are forced to burn the car with his body inside and once they remove their costumes, they run through a forest, and later a cemetery, in which one of the women, Michelle, is almost buried alive. Walking through a field, they come to the outside of a gothic castle. There they are bitten by vampire bats, which lead them to go into the castle, where they make love.\n\nThey tour the castle and discover a few skeletons along with a woman playing an organ.\n\nShe begins to follow them, so they shoot at her, but she doesn’t die. They run away and are caught by some men who force themselves on them. A vampire woman stops the men, and the vampire woman who chased them almost bites them until they break away. They soon come across a male vampire, the last of his kind. He has plans for the women. They are bitten in order to continue his bloodline, but they must stay virgins…\n\nReviews:\n\n‘ …an easily watchable surreal exercise in foreign filmmaking, crammed with bizarre comic art imagery strung together with various incidents of fetishistic kinkiness and sadism. With the usual low budget Rollin was allotted, he makes excellent use of some authentic gothic locations, and the picturesque, massive chateau makes for a better vampires’ liar than any studio could possibly provide. The use of oddball props, including rotted corpses affixed with squirming worms, severed arms protruding from stone walls, a line of hooded standing skeletons and assorted bats real and phony, add to the film’s unique appearance, and the clever use of colored lighting in some of the outdoor nighttime scenes is also noteworthy.’ George R. Reis, DVD Drive-In\n\n‘Requiem for a Vampire is not a movie I would recommend to people with a distaste for explicit, rather creepy sexual content, but it is worth watching and discussing from an historic and filmic standpoint. You can tell that Rollin was trying to stretch his filmmaking and storytelling muscles, but was tamped down under the weight of having to make another vampire titty flick.’ Kyle Anderson, Nerdist\n\n‘Apparently Rollin’s always had an eye for beauty in nature and architecture because once again his cinematic eye focuses on beautiful vistas, trees, mountains, night skies, he often times focuses on breathtaking sunsets and cloud formations. He also shot the film inside this ancient castle, it just looks haunting. The visual compositions that Rollin comes up with is the element of his films I love the most and on Requiem for a Vampire he demonstrates that he’s always had that eye for beauty.’ The Film Connoisseur\n\nCast:\n\nMarie-Pierre Castel as Marie\n\nMireille Dargent as Michelle\n\nPhilippe Gasté as Frédéric\n\nDominique as Erica\n\nLouise Dhour as Louise\n\nMichel Dalesalle\n\nAntoine Mosin\n\nAgnès Petit\n\nOlivier François\n\nDominique Toussaint\n\nAgnes Jacquet\n\nAnne-Rose Kurra\n\nPaul Bisciglia as L’homme au Vélo\n\nFilming locations:\n\nThe movie was filmed in the small village of Crêvecoeur. The graveyard was located outside the village on a knoll. The castle, a historical place entirely furnished with genuine antiques, all of which were worth a fortune, had been rented from the duchess of Roche-Guyon. It wasn’t her castle that Rollin and the crew were interested in, but the ruins of the dungeon above, that overlooked the entire area.\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\nMaximum Overdrive is a 1986 American science fiction horror film written and directed by Stephen King. The screenplay was inspired by and loosely based on King’s short story Trucks, which was included in King’s first collection of short stories, Night Shift. King himself described the film as a “moron movie” and stated his intention to never direct again soon after. It stars Emilio Estevez (Repo Man), Pat Hingle, Laura Harrington.\n\nThe film has a mid-1980s hard rock soundtrack composed entirely by the group AC/DC, King’s favourite band.\n\nPlot teaser:\n\nAs the Earth passes through the tail of a comet, previously inanimate objects (ranging from vehicles to lawnmowers to an electric knife) start to show a murderous life of their own. In a pre-title scene, a man (King in a cameo) tries to withdraw money from an ATM, but it instead calls him an “asshole”.. Chaos soon begins as machines of all kinds come to life and begin assaulting humans; a drawbridge inexplicably raises during heavy traffic, resulting in multiple accidents, while at a Little League game, a vending machine kills the coach by firing canned soda point-blank into his groin and then to his skull and a pilot-less steamroller flattens one of the fleeing children.\n\nThe carnage spreads as humans and even pets are brutally killed by lawnmowers, chainsaws, electric hair dryers, pocket radios, and RC cars. At a roadside truck stop just outside Wilmington, North Carolina, a waitress is injured by an electric knife and arcade machines in the back room electrocute another victim. Employee and ex-convict Bill Robinson begins to suspect something is wrong when suddenly marauding big rig trucks, led by a black semi-truck sporting a giant Green Goblin mask on its grille, run down two individuals and trap the rest of the civilians inside the truck stop’s diner…\n\nReviews:\n\n‘Those hostile lawn sprinklers also hint at something which is both Maximum Overdrive’s most serious handicap and its greatest strength – its sheer, random goofiness. Beyond the crummy acting or the irritating characters (Yeardley Smith shrieking incessantly with an exaggerated Dixie accent… *shudder*) or the misguided earnestness of the all-AC/DC soundtrack (the gods did not put Angus Young on this planet to play horror movie musical stings), it’s all the loopy shit that comes out of nowhere that turns Maximum Overdrive into a 30-pound wheel of fine, stinky cheese.’ 1000 Misspent Hours and Counting\n\n‘Yet by making the machines’ malevolence so all-encompassing -so amoral – Mr. King loses the fillip of retribution in better horror films. For the most part, he has taken a promising notion – our dependence on our machines – and turned it into one long car-crunch movie, wheezing from setups to crackups. A cheap cold war twist in the final subtitles doesn’t make ”Maximum Overdrive” any less mechanical.’ Jon Pareles, New York Times\n\n‘Overall, Maximum Overdrive is an amusing kitschy film. It has some good ideas, some occasional corny dialogue (that elevate the fun tacky level of the film), some really nice explosions (everything blows up…yippee!) and some nasty gory moments (when trucks hit humans, they go SPLAT!). It’s not the smartest film ever made but then again: IT’S ABOUT KILLER TRUCKS! What did people expect?’ Arrow in the Head, Joblo.com\n\nCast:\n\nEmilio Estevez as William “Bill” Robinson\n\nPat Hingle as Bubba Hendershot\n\nLaura Harrington as Brett Graham\n\nYeardley Smith as Connie\n\nJohn Short as Curtis\n\nEllen McElduff as Wanda June\n\nFrankie Faison as Handy\n\nLeon Rippy as Brad\n\nChristopher Murney as Camp Loman\n\nJ.

Its origins derived from hardcore and gangsta rap artists such as the Geto Boys and Insane Clown Posse, who brought the genre into the mainstream, if somewhat fleetingly. The term horrorcore was popularised by openly horror-influenced hip hop groups such as Flatlinerz and Gravediggaz.\n\nHorrorcore is the hottest potato within the hip hop genre, upsetting the purists and proving too extreme for mass consumption, it has even seen so-called ‘godfathers’ of the scene distancing themselves as pioneers. It has been argued that Jimmy Spicer’s 1980 single “Adventures of Super Rhyme” was perhaps the first example of anything that resembled horrorcore, due to the segment of the song in which Spicer recounts his experience of meeting Dracula. Interestingly, even this came after the wave of Blaxploitation films which flooded 42nd Street cinemas, the films themselves rarely grasping the opportunity to have an accompanying song to give them even greater visibility outside their niche.\n\nBuy on CD from Amazon.com\n\nA year later, groups like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde (unclear whether the misspelling was intentional) and songs like Dana Dane’s “Nightmares,” saw releases, though these had more in common with the horror pop craze of the 1950’s and early 60’s, with monsters seen as comical characters and the threat minimal. It wasn’t until the horror film itself embraced a more bubblegum aesthetic, with the likes of A Nightmare on Elm Street’s Freddy Krueger appearing on television regularly, despite the film’s age rating, that rap and horror films edged closer together.\n\nIn 1988, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince released “A Nightmare on My Street“, which described an encounter with Freddy Krueger. It was a crossover success and reached 15 on the Top 100 but whilst music was beginning to embrace horror, the film industry was less sure (possibly partly due to Smith referring to Krueger as ‘Fred’ and the song concluding with the razor-fingered murderer quipping, “I’m your DJ now, Princey”). New Line Cinema sued for copyright infringement and the accompanying video was pulled and copies destroyed. The album was emblazoned with the legend “not part of the soundtrack…and is not authorized, licensed, or affiliated with the Nightmare on Elm Street films”; all this despite the film’s producers seriously considering using the song in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. It’s telling that a genre which had used themes and imagery from horror films far earlier, metal, had actually beaten the pair to Freddy’s affections anyway, with Krueger appearing in Dokken’s video for “Dream Warriors” which was indeed included in the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors a year earlier.\n\nPlaying by the rules were the Fat Boys who recorded the similarly-themed “Are You Ready for Freddy?” for the film A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master and its soundtrack. The Chubby Checker-approved funsters even coaxed a rap out of Englund, though he had already flexed his musical muscle with Freddy Krueger’s Greatest Hits in 1987, an appalling collection melodically but a sign that horror was big business in all forms of pop culture.\n\nThis was all rather flotsam and jetsam compared to what would truly be recognised as horrorcore, the first example of a darker strain appearing with The Geto Boys‘ debut album, Making Trouble, which contained the dark and violent horror-influenced track “Assassins“, which was cited by Joseph Bruce (Violent J of the horrorcore group Insane Clown Posse) in his book Behind The Paint, as the first recorded horrorcore song. The album had Tales From the Crypt-style narratives which were a world away from the luminous, jokey scares which went before. Their third album, “We Can’t Be Stopped”, featured the classic, “Chuckie”, which sampled Child’s Play.\n\nPre-Eminem, Detroit’s most prominent hip hop artist was Esham, regularly cited as the most influential horror core artist of recent times. Contrarily, Esham denounces such labels (as did New York-based Kool Keith of Ultramagnetic MC’s, though both are prone to changing their minds) and, in fairness, the supernatural is more-often overlooked in favour of real-life horrors, with the troubles of his home city being a metaphor for Hell itself on his debut, “Boomin’ Words from Hell“, embracing rock and metal samples to enhance the effect. Extreme violence was to the fore, with occasional nods to familiar foes:\n\nEsham – “Red Rum” (1989)\n\n“More like Jason, but it’s you I’m chasin’\n\nAnd once I catch ya, I’m micin’ and acein’\n\nRunnin’ through your mind like Loki\n\nAnd the reason you don’t see me, cuz I’m low key\n\nI’m the Saturday shocker, horror flick routine\n\nShowin’ you shit, that you never seen\n\nMichael Myers, the crucifiers”\n\nUltramagnetic MC’s – “Travelling at the Speed of Thought” (1988):\n\n“Respect me, when I whip your brain\n\nSkip your brain and dip your brain\n\nIn the lotion while I deck ya skull\n\nI’m like a bird when I’m pecking ya skull\n\nTil it hurts and swell, puffs, bleed, blood”\n\nKMC became the first act to actually use the phrase, “horrorcore” (disputed, naturally) in 1991, whilst other artists throughout the United States began to use similar styles of delivery and themes to distinguish their music from other forms of hip hop; of note are Brotha Lynch Hung, R.A. The Rugged Man, Backyard Posse, The Flatlinerz and The Gravediggaz. R.A. The Rugged Man, in particular, used themes and imagery from the horror films he loved; his debut album (eventually released several years after production) was titled “Night of the Bloody Apes” and featured a track called “Toolbox Murderer”. Under his real name of R.A. Thorburn, he became involved in the horror film industry himself, appearing in a number of shorts as well as co-writing and acting in Frank Hennenlotter’s Bad Biology.\n\nBuy The Fear soundtrack CD from Amazon.com\n\nThe boiling pot for these new acts was The Fear, a horror film which horrorcore used as its muse, the reverse of Singles which had used Seattle’s rock music scene for its own purposes. Consequently, frontrunners Esham and Flatlinerz combine forces to cover the title track, whilst Insane Clown Posse, the breakout mainstream stars of the genre, enjoyed huge radio play with “Dead Body Man”. Similarly, Gravediggaz developed a devoted following, their debut, “6 Feet Deep”, not only referencing horror films but using minor chords, atmospherics and effects used in the films themselves.\n\nBuy Gravediggaz 6 Feet Deep from Amazon.com\n\nWhile rappers in the underground scene continued to release horrorcore music, the mid-90s brought an attempted mainstream crossover of the genre. In 1994, according to Icons of Hip Hop, “[Horrorcore] gained prominence in 1994 with the release of Flatlinerz’ U.S.A. (Under Satan’s Authority) and Gravediggaz’ 6 Feet Deep (released overseas as Niggamortis), the latter aided by the early incarnation featuring Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA, the former Redrum (Jamel Simmons, nephew of Def Jam label co-founder, Russell Simmons).\n\nFlatlinerz were possibly the pinnacle of the genre, despite only releasing one full-length album and only being resurrected as a going concern in 2014. Their track, “Live Evil” samples Jerry Goldsmith’s Ave Satani, from the film, The Omen.\n\nBuy Insane Clown Posse’s Hallowicked from Amazon.com\n\nThe genre is not popular with mainstream audiences as a whole; however, performers such as Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid have sold well. The genre has thrived in Internet culture and sustains an annual super show in Detroit called Wickedstock. Every Halloween since 2003, Horrorcore artists worldwide release a free compilation online titled Devilz Nite.\n\nBranching off slightly is Necro (who took his name from the Slayer song, “Necrophobic”), whose merging of rap and death metal prompted him to coin the term “death rap”. He has based his tracks on subjects ranging from The Manson murders, to suicide, to sexual violence, to cannibalism. His music was cited as an influence on the child murderers Michael Rafferty heard testimony from convicted murderer and Terri-Lynne McClintic, who were said to have repeatedly listened to Necro’s music. Necro has stated he would never condone the harm of children.\n\nBuy It’s All Bad from Amazon.com\n\nA final word for a performer, who, whilst not only creating songs in the horrorcore style, did at least practice what many of the other acts preached. Big Lurch (real name, Altron Singleton), so-called due to tall, looming frame, only released one album, initially called “The Puppet Master” but later changed, for understandable reasons, to “It’s All Bad”. On “I Did It To You!” he sings:\n\n“Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson\n\nAnd all of your friends I’mma finsta school ya\n\n‘Cuz murder’s a hobby\n\nI’m using a torture chamber and not a Ruger”\n\nOn April 10th 2002, Tynisha Ysais was found in her apartment by a friend. Her chest had been torn open and a three-inch blade was found broken off in her shoulder blade. Teeth marks were found on her face and on her lungs, which had been torn from her chest. An eyewitness reported that, when Singleton was picked up by police, he was naked, covered in blood, standing in the middle of the street, and staring at the sky. A medical examination performed shortly after his capture found human flesh in his stomach that was not his own. High on PCP, Singleton had attacked, murdered and partially eaten his victim, a court later pointing to his lyrics as an indication that he was prone to such thoughts, let alone deeds. He is currently serving a life term in prison.\n\nDaz Lawrence, Horrorpedia\n\nAmong the Living – French: Aux yeux des vivants – is a 2014 French horror film written and directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo (Inside; Livid; ABCs of Death 2 ‘X is for Xylophone’; Leatherface).\n\nCast:\n\nBéatrice Dalle (Inside; Livid), Anne Marivin, Nicolas Giraud, Francis Renaud, Chloé Coulloud, Zacharie Chasseriaud, Damien Ferdel\n\nFunding for the film was raised through a successful crowdsourcing campaign. It had its world premiere on 10 March 2014 at South by Southwest.\n\nPlot Teaser:\n\nThree young adolescent friends decide that they want to start their summer vacation early, so they decide to skip the last day of school in favor of having a little fun. Their adventures that day get them into a little trouble, which causes them to wander to an abandoned film studio lot on the edge of town called Blackwood Studios.\n\nThe young boys are horrified when they see a man in a clown mask dragging a chained woman across the lot. They manage to flee and try to get the police involved, only for the police to assume that because the adolescents are only causing more trouble. The adolescents end up going back to their respective homes, unaware that the masked man and his father are planning on taking their revenge on the three friends…\n\nReviews:\n\n“When Among the Living shifts gears into full-on slasher territory—with the gore to follow, there’s an amazing face slice—who lives and who dies depends on the strength of their family unit. It’s possible only a family willing to go bat for one another could possibly face a father and son so connected, so warped. It’s this section that sees Among the Living at its successful.” Samuel Zimmerman, Fangoria\n\n“The tension in Among the Living is so thick that it spawned collective coping mechanisms, wherein neighboring strangers locked eyes when they couldn’t bear to look at the screen any longer. The fear in the room was palpable as audience gasps and audible cringes fed off one another, heightening the shared discomfort. This is what makes Bustillo & Maury’s work such a treat.” Zach Gayne, Twitch\n\n“Among the Living works quite well in its simplicity and adoration for the ’80s. There’s plenty of creepy/nightmarish imagery on display (best use of a cat door!) yet, to destabilize you, there are some moments you think would be big splatter moments that are surprisingly restrained. Still, Bustillo and Maury push a lot of buttons in what is a classic “clash of families” scenario.” Ryan Turek, Shock Till You Drop\n\n” … a joy to watch (even when you’re viewing it from behind your own splayed fingers). Cinematographer Antoine Sanier completely nails the small-town atmosphere while setting up some truly dazzling reveals. Bustillo and Maury’s film is also something of a homage to the American films they grew up watching…” Marc Savlov, The Austin Chronicle\n\n“Bustillo and Maury are masters of both atmosphere and gore. We’re also reminded that a lot of American films with similar production values play it so incredibly safe compared to these guys – without spoiling too much there are casualties you wouldn’t expect.” Evan Dickson, Bloody Disgusting\n\nCast and Characters:\n\nBéatrice Dalle as Jeanne Faucheur\n\nAnne Marivin as Julia\n\nNicolas Giraud as Nathan\n\nFrancis Renaud as Isaac Faucheur\n\nChloé Coulloud as Mila\n\nZacharie Chasseriaud as Tom\n\nDamien Ferdel as Dan\n\nThéo Fernandez as Victor\n\nFabien Jegoudez as Klarence\n\nSidwell Weber\n\nTrailer:\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\n‘Beware of those you trust’\n\nKruel – aka Cruel – is a 2015 American horror film written, produced and directed by Robert Henderson.\n\nMain cast:\n\nKierney Nelson (Octagon), Dakota Morrissiey, Adam Vernier (Black Cadillac; Route 666) and J. T. Chinn.\n\nPlot:\n\nJo O’Hare is a typical teenager dealing with typical teenage problems – fighting with her parents and dealing with an unfaithful boyfriend. But Jo soon finds herself with a much bigger problem, when she is accused of recklessly causing the death of a young boy in her care.\n\nThe unbearable guilt turns into determination when she sets out to prove that the outrageous neighborhood ice-cream man is really a psychotic monster who is responsible for the disappearance of the boy. With the help of her ex-boyfriend, Jo begins a journey to find the truth, a journey which will lead her to the darkest side of evil and put everyone’s life around her in jeopardy…\n\nReviews:\n\n“There isn’t much in the way of gore to take in, and the action in general is a tad slow, but if you’re looking for some simple yet effective entertainment, Kruel isn’t a complete dud. It should hold your attention, it should reaffirm your fear of creepy clown-dressed ice cream men and it should also remind you to not only keep a sharp eye on your child, but to avoid hiring reckless youth to look after them as well.” Matt, Horrorfreak News\n\n“Hell, the film pretty much lacked any real bloodshed which made it feel almost like a thriller instead of a horror flick. A few good kills would have made this one a hit. Overall, Kruel is a well made horror flick that has some great atmosphere and an amazing cast. Sadly, it lacks the blood and gore most of us would love to see in our flicks.” Blacktooth, Horror Society\n\n” … we can imagine an endless array of potential creepy-clowny type stuff, and then the guy is barely ever on the screen. We have the typical group of young girls, friends of the protagonist and fans of hanging out in their underwear, just like you’d expect from any slasher movie worth its weight in gore, and yet none of them even get attacked, much less killed. And every single instance of a character getting killed (save for one) is quickly turned around and saved…” Sean of the Dead, HorrorNews.net\n\n“Once Ben and Jo’s relationship issues are resolved, the film turns into a boring yawn of capture, and getaway, with no real feeling of dread. I honestly never once felt Jo was in any danger at the hands of the bad guy. I never felt scared; I did, however, feel I wanted this movie to end at the beginning of the third act.” Chad Armstrong, Lifeless Corpse\n\nFilming locations:\n\nJacksonville and Orlando, Florida\n\nIMDb | Facebook"
