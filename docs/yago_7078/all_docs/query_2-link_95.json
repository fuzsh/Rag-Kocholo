        "text": "As you guys might know, i new Jeepers Creepers movie is coming out, this one is a complete reboot with new staff, completely from scratch with no attachments to the old ones. So no bad rep attached to this one.\n\nSo with that in mind, does the Creeper have another chance to be in the game? If not, i understand, but could this work?\n\nEverything you listed has a practical use, and the inventors of all have been dead for at the very least decades. We, as consumers, can do nothing about the inventors being ######### people. They're dead, and their inventions have spread all over the world.\n\nJeepers Creepers is just a horror movie and has no practical use.\n\nVictor Salva is still very much alive. He's a terrible person and his work does not deserve to be put in the spotlight, even if he's not directly attached to the project.\n\nYou're comparing electricity, one of the backbones of modern society, to a dumb horror movie. They are not comparable.\n\nIt depends how you want to look at it. I think that all media has a practical use.\n\nTo me, it's like trying to ban The Jungle Book or Huckleberry Finn. I'm a big proponent of Death of the Author - media should be enjoyed separately from it's creator.\n\nThere is another, bigger and much more complicated issue here though, and one that's probably going to rustle some feathers.\n\nWhen someone commits a crime, goes to jail and is released, completes their probation or what have you and commits no further crimes - he or she should be clear (within reason). The formerly incarcerated suffer massive prejudices in society, from a lack of voting rights to constant surveillance. I'm not a fan of that, because it's saying that offenders can never be rehabilitated and need to be punished until they die - which is a pretty dark road to go down.\n\nSalva commited a crime. For doing that thing, he went to prison, served his probation and has never reoffended. I have no love for the man, but right now, as a society, we are way too prone to collective vigilantism.\n\nWoof, heavy stuff for a gaming forum, but I think that it's an interesting and important topic.\n\nMedia does have its uses, but it's nowhere near as important nor impactful as things like electricity or cars.\n\nThe difference is, once again, both are over a century old at this point. They were written in a far different time. Jeepers Creepers was released in 2001. Salva was convicted for terrible crimes in 1994. I think art should be separated from the author to a certain degree, yes, but to what degree is hard to say. I've always enjoyed Lovecraft's work-- But as someone who enjoys the genre of horror he helped create, I have to recognize his blatant xenophobia and racism.\n\nI can see where you're coming from to a degree, but nothing will change the fact that Salva is a pedophile. He ruined a child's life. He did a terrible, terrible thing and it isn't collective vigilantism. Victor Salva does not deserve to have his work put in any sort of spotlight. Nothing will change my mind, and I'm not sorry about that.\n\nIt is an important topic, and I appreciate how calmly you argue your points, but it's likely best we stop here. The mods have a history of not liking this topic.\n\nWe would probably still have rockets even without Operation Paperclip it would have just taken longer. We'd still have cars as multiple people and multiple companies came up different iterations of the Motorized Carriage. We would still have electric considering more people than Edison had a vested interest in seeing the technology expand and though infeasible Tesla wanted to supply people with electricity for free.\n\nThe idea of separating the creation from the creator is a valid way to address issues such as this, but becomes harder to do while the creator still lives and profits off of their creation. They are intertwined on a level that makes supporting one difficult if it supports the other and unlike cars, rockets, or electricity Jeepers Creeper isn't a creation that serves the public good, aid in exploration and defense, or improve the ability of goods, people, and services to be moved around a vast country.\n\nSo it isn't terrible logic by any means.\n\nMm. We think very differently.\n\nI worked in corrections, and - while it's not always easy - I think that it's important to leave punishments for crimes to the justice system, especially after a sentence+probation has been served. It's something that we are told as guards, time and time again - it's not for us to dispense additional punishments on people who are already in prison for a crime, and that holds doubly true after.\n\nIt's really hard when it's a crime like this, but if we make it impossible for someone to ever put their crime behind them, ostracize them and prevent them from earning a living, not only are we saying that they can never be rehabilitated, but we are making this come true.\n\nHere, we have a man who did something horrible 30 years ago. He served a sentence, completed probation and never reoffended. I'm fine not letting him be around kids unsupervised, but that should be the end of it.\n\nHoly crap! There's a new Jeepers Creepers coming out?! That's awesome, I used to love those movies when I was a kid! haha\n\nJustin Long! XD Never really see him anymore, what a random actor he has been in so much random stuff.\n\nAnyways, Jeepers Creepers would be hell of fun to play in DBD - if they could make it work I would be down, but for some reason I feel that it's doubtful.\n\nBad Rep? Huh, not that it was an all time favorite or anything but everyone I've ever met where the original movies have been brought up in conversations seemed to have liked the films and remembered them similarly to how I do.\n\nYes.\n\nHe did something truly awful. Utterly despicable.\n\nFor doing this, he was given a prison sentence and served probation. He is still not permitted access to children, unsupervised - which is fine.\n\nNow, this is in no way apologist for what he did, but once someone's sentence is concluded, we - as a society - should not endeavor to punish them further. We shouldn't ostracize or prevent someone from earning a living, because the entire goal of the corrections system is to turn bad guys into proper citizens and this makes it impossible.\n\nIf we really don't think that rehabilitation and change is possible as a society, we should probably be handling crime and punishment very differently (and that would be a very dark world).\n\nIf we do, then we need to act like we do and, common-sense precautions aside, we attempt to help people make that change. Here, in particular, when the offense was over a generation ago, he expressed remorse and never reoffended.\n\nAre you supporting people having their lives ruined over a Tweet?\n\nBecause if you are, then I don't think we'll find any fertile grounds for discussions, as we are diametrically opposed.\n\nIf you aren't...well, you're arguing my side of it then. People shouldn't be offense-farming on old Tweets, or using them to attack people now - even if they said something really dumb or 'offensive'. Because people change.\n\nWhile it makes me feel gross, I have to extend the same charity to people who have served their sentence for a crime, have not reoffended and are trying to reenter society. And that, unfortunately, has to include this guy. Because they have to be given the chance to change.\n\nNotch did literally nothing wrong, but that's a very different discussion.\n\nOn topic:\n\nAre you in favor of the death penalty, or mandatory life-imprisonment for all felonies?\n\nIf not, then you probably accept that people have the capacity to be remorseful, and to change.\n\nThis is a cornerstone of the modern justice system - rehabilitation.\n\nIf you insist on ostracizing and persecuting someone in perpetuity, you make rehabilitating them impossible. And yes, this means that sometimes you will need to apply this to someone who is an utter scumbag.\n\nDude, I Love the way you think! Couldn't agree more on almost every topic of conversation that you wrote in this thread! It is 100% unbiased and purely logical thinking that I really wish that more people in the world shared your views and thought process, generally speaking of course.\n\nI had no idea about any of this prior to this thread by the way, I learned as I read what you guys have wrote, but as it stands the most reasonable person here by far has been you, StarLost, and while this is just a gaming forum I want to compliment you on your brain.\n\nYou shared possibly controversial thoughts that were extremely valid and made a lot of sense, I happen to also agree with what you said in the entire thread, but even if I did not I would at least consider the things you wrote and possibly change my own opinion!\n\nThank you. I am often the one in my \"group\" or social life who tends to speak the \"uncomfortable truths\" that no one else really wants to agree with despite my logic being very reasonable and sound, it's just honestly nice to see that I'm not the only one in the world <3\n\nEDIT: I saw some others mentioning that this Thread might get shut down if people aren't careful because of this Topic - but honestly I really hope that it doesn't because this has been legitimately the most interesting Thread I've read on these Forums in a VERY long time. It actually has brightened my day and put me in a better mood (especially after having a few terrible matches as Killer on Haddonfield with Boon Totems ><)\n\ni just wanted to state that although these opinions stated are controversial that i also agree with them i like to look at it from a logical viewpoint de attached from any issue and viewing it with no emotions attached\n\nPeople change and everybody wants to think that people dont but they do trust me im much different from the man i was 10 years ago ik great men that had terribile things happen to them and terrible men that had great things happen to them\n\ndont be fooled even cain killed abel, looks can be deceiving even jesus's eyes were hazel"
