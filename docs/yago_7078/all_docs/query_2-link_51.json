        "text": "Jeepers Creepers 3 is finally a go.\n\nThe long-in-the-works installment of Victor Salva’s cult horror movie series will be financed by Myriad Picures, which is launching international sales at TIFF via its newly launched genre label Scoundrel.\n\nJonathan Breck is returning as the limb-loving Creeper and Brandon Smith as his pursuer, Sergeant Davis Tubbs. The leads for the movie, which is eyeing a production start in Vancouver in early 2016, have not been cast yet.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola‘s American Zoetrope, who produced the first two films, will co-produce the film along with Kirk Shaw and Surai Gohill‘s Odyssey Media, and Stan Spry‘s The Cartel.\n\nCoppola, Shaw and Spry will serve as producers and Myriad’s Kirk D’Amico will executive produce.\n\nThe original movie, released by MGM/UA in 2001, starred Justin Long and Gina Philips as a brother-sister who run across a creature known as the Creeper who feasts on body parts to make it part of its own.\n\nIt led to a sequel made in 2003.\n\nSalva has been talking about additional movies and even a TV series since.\n\n“What will go before cameras as Jeepers Creepers 3 is a new and terrifying chapter from the Jeepers universe,” said Salva in Myriad’s announcement. “We are bringing back the Creeper’s truck, and will be addressing the big questions about The Creeper: what it is, where it came from and why it does what it does.”"
