        "text": "Hello,\n\nI have got some news. We (Aslan Game Studio) had been working on a chess based game since the end of 2013. It was our main project, while Clown House was a side, experimental one.\n\nNow I'm proud to announce that Pawn of the Dead is finally released on Steam. This means that we will have time to work on horror games.\n\nPawn of the Dead is a 3D game based on chess, in the style of Battle Chess. What makes it a unique game is its mechanic: When a Black (undead) piece captures a White piece, that White piece turns into a Black one! But don’t worry, all the levels are designed so that you can always win the match.\n\nWe have a campaign mode with 64 levels (supported with cinematics), random level generator mode and classical chess mode.\n\nYou can find more information about Pawn of the Dead: https://store.steampowered.com/app/890130/Pawn_of_the_Dead/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRio9N2rlmw\n\nTURKISH:\n\nPalyaço Evi 2'nin ne durumda olduğuyla ilgili kısa bir bilgilendirme yapmak istiyorum. Bu yıl Pawn of the Dead bittikten sonra Palyaço Evi 2'ye geri döneceğiz. Bu esnada devlet desteğine de başvurumuzu yaptık, eğer kabul edilirse harika olacak.\n\nİlk oyunun en önemli sorunu çok kısa sürmesiydi. 2'de rastgele bölüm yaratma algoritması üzerinde çalışacağız. Ayrıca VR desteği de olacak.\n\nENGLISH:\n\nI want to make some announcements about Clown House 2's current state. We will continue on Clown House 2 this year when Pawn of the Dead is completed. We also appealed to governmental incentive, it will be great for us if we get accepted.\n\nThe greatest problem of the first game was the extremely short game time. We will work on random level generation algorithms in the sequel. Also, there will be VR support.\n\nHello everyone!\n\nIt has been a year since I announced Clown House 2. People keep asking me if the project is still alive and when it will be released.\n\nThe project will definitely continue. The answer I can give about the release date is, Fall 2017 (hopefully before Halloween) for Steam.\n\nI had given a long break from Clown House 2, in order to code Graveyard Shift. The next one-two months will be spent on adding Oculus Rift support (and maybe porting the game to PS4).\n\nWhy will it take so much time? Because I want it to be a long game with large environments. The first game was a failure, because the house was too small and the game could be completed in minute. This is unacceptable for a commercial title. That's why Clown House 2 will take a long time to finish.\n\nI hope the sequel manages to make you forget the first game.\n\n~Ahmet"
