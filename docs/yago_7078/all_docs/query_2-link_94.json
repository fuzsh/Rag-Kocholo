        "text": "Deadpool and Wolverine\n\nThis is the movie my nephew and I are most looking forward to watching this Summer. We’re both big Deadpool fans, we both like Wolverine, so… Not sure how this movie is going to play out, but I’m hopeful that it will be as much fun as the first two Deadpool movies, and at least as much fun as the comic books.\n\nThe Quiet Place: Day One\n\nThis is going to be a great year for Horror movies, starting with one of my favorite franchises, The Quiet Place. I greatly enjoyed the first two films, which, while full of some pretty scary moments, and are definitely considered Creature Features, I still classify as being more alongside the Action genre. It also happens to star two of my favorite actors, Lupita Nyong’o and Djimon Hounsou. Despite loving the movie American Fiction, I actually do like watching movies with multiple Black actors where the subject doesn’t revolve around racial issues. It should be a perfectly normal thing to see Black actors in all kinds of different movies.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 2\n\nI greatly enjoyed season one of this series and I’m excited to immerse myself back in this world again. Even though the actress who played Claudia has left the show, (she was a lot of fun), I’m still ready to watch this. I loved the characters and their interactions with each other, and the season left off on something of a cliffhanger.\n\nDune (Pt. 2)\n\nAgain, I enjoyed the first part of this and I’m excited to enter this world of Dune again. Denis Villeneuve has done an excellent job with this franchise.\n\nFallout\n\nI’ve never played these games and know almost nothing at all about the lore of this world, so I had to take a quick crash course to understand some of the images I saw in the trailer. I’m excited to visit this place based solely on the strength of the trailer! I hope it’s as interesting as the trailer suggests.\n\nShogun\n\nI already mentioned my love for the original film, so I’m eagerly awaiting the premiere of this remake next week.\n\nAvatar\n\nI think we can all agree the movie was a disaster, but based on the trailer, this series looks pretty good, and faithful enough to the original to merit a look-see.\n\nHouse of Ninja\n\nI have not started this series yet, but it looks like fun.\n\nIF\n\nI think I will prefer this over the Horror movie about imaginary friends. Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely going to check out the Horror movie, but the addition of Ryan Reynolds makes this one look more fun.\n\nFuriosa\n\nI am not sure we needed a movie about Furiosa’s backstory but this looks very exciting and she is such a beloved character that I guess the filmmakers simply couldn’t resist. I am becoming a huge fan of Anya Taylor-Joy, too. I don’t know that I will see this in the theater. I probably will if one of my nieces would like to join me.\n\nMonkey Man\n\nI am deeply in love with Dev Patel and it is very exhilarating to see him in an Action film ala John Wick style! It does not hurt at all that one of the Producers behind this gem is Jordan Peele, who, as far as I’m concerned, can yet do no wrong onscreen. I am definitely going to see this one in the theater.\n\nBorderlands\n\nI don’t know anything about the original source material (a videogame) on which this movie is based, I just love the idea of this cast (Cate Blanchett, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Jamie Lee Curtis) all starring in this silly, cheesy looking, Guardians of the Galaxy/Mad Max ripoff! Pure Popcorn!\n\nThe Ones Who Live\n\nI have not watched any of the other Spinoffs from The Walking Dead, but I am invested in the romance of Michonne and Rick, and hope this offers all the feels I’m looking for in a TV series this Spring!\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nAxel F – This is one of those Netflix originals type of things. I’m a fan of the Beverly Hills Cop movies and it will be fun to visit with Axel Foley again!\n\nSpace Man – I’m not sure I like the idea of a giant talking space spider, but I’m going to watch this because I’ve enjoyed Adam Sandler’s previous non-comedic work.\n\nRebel Moon Pt. 2 – I hesitate to say this was a good movie because it had some story drawbacks. On the other hand, the story is not finished, so hopefully, the second half of this movie will flesh out the problems of the first half of this movie. The visuals were gorgeous, but that means nothing if the story behind those visuals is lacking.\n\nRoad House – I talked about being a fan of the original cheesy film, and this is streaming on Amazon Prime, so I don’t have to worry about spending money on a theater experience. It looks kinda cheesy and fun, like a Saturday afternoon “popcorn/on the couch” event.\n\nSting – I’ve heard this is a comedy. I will not be seeing this in the theater because again…giant spider!\n\nAbigail – My niece has expressed some interest in watching this vampire ballerina movie. I get it. She loved that Megan film, and seems to have this thing about movies with little girls behaving badly. I’m not sure I want to see this movie but since she has trusted my judgement on choosing movies to watch, I’m trusting her judgement on this.\n\nThe Fall Guy – I have memories of having watched the TV show on which this movie is based, but I cannot for the life of me remember anything beyond that it starred Lee Majors, (from The Six Million Dollar Man), who was once married to Farah Fawcett. I like Ryan Gosling. That’s all I got.\n\nNosferatu – I do not have a trailers for this but its a remake of the original 1920s Silent film by one of my favorite directors, Robert Eggers! It looks as if this will be dropping in December/\n\nWar of the Rohirrim – I know nothing about this movie other than its based on Tolkien’s writings and it too is dropping in December. I dont even know who is starring in this yet. I don’t even have a trailer or even an announcement that this is happening. It just showed up on FirstShowing.net\n\n*I’m always writing these huge ambitious metas about stuff, but this is the kind of stuff that sits in my brain until I can get it out. So here goes:\n\nI don’t really like the word “problematic”, as I feel its overused, but its entirely accurate when it comes to this particular director. In 1988, Victor Salva was convicted of sexual misconduct, with the then 12 year old star of his movie, Clownhouse. He pleaded guilty to lewd and lascivious conduct and spent 3 years in prison. He was registered as a sex offender and is no longer allowed to be alone with children on his film sets.\n\nVictor Salva, more than any other director, is the one of the poster children, not just for White male privilege, but the issue of separating the artist from their art. One of the things that makes it so difficult to to do this with Salva, is that his sordid past keeps intruding into his art, which once you know about it, is impossible to unknow.\n\n*(This Vice article, written back in 2012, lets me know I’m not the only person who has noticed this about Salva’s films.)\n\nVictor Salva Loves Terrorizing Semi-Naked Youths\n\nCHARLIE GRAHAM-DIXON\n\nAfter Salva was released from prison, he was offered a movie to direct by Disney, in 1995, called Powder, starring Jeff Goldblum, Sean Patrick Flannery, Lance Henriksen, and Mary Steenbergen, about a young albino genius, named Jeremy “Powder” Reed, who has electrical powers. At the movie’s release, Salva’s former victim came forward to protest the release of the film. Salva has not worked with Disney since that time.\n\nAll this would just be a footnote, and Powder would be just another of those movies lost to history, except Salva went on to make several more films, and is now, with the help of Francis Ford Coppola, about to direct another Jeepers Creepers sequel. And when watching any of Salva’s movies r you start to notice a disturbing tendency to focus on his young male stars in ways that remind the viewer of his past transgressions.\n\nSalva’s films, The Nature of the Beast (1995), starring Lance Henriksen again, Powder (1996), Jeepers Creepers (2001), and its sequel (2003), contain scenes that, while we might find them not worth remarking about any other time, in light of Salva’s history, these moments are…disturbing. Now, he’s set to produce and direct Jeepers Creepers 3, and I’m debating whether or not I should see this movie. I watched these movies, the first time, wholly unaware of Salva’s background.\n\nFor example, in one of the more controversial scenes in Powder, Jeff Goldblum’s character, Donald Ripley, finds Jeremy alone in a room, and tries to form an emotional connection to him. In any other movie, this would be a beautiful moment, and an example of non-toxic masculinity, between an empathetic older man, and a young man who is starved for affection. At least that’s how I watched it the first time, but with knowledge of Salva’s background, the scene becomes distinctly creepy. Ripley slowly caresses Jeremy’s face and head. Jeremy, who has never been shown any form of physical affection, nearly breaks down in tears.\n\n“You touched me and I’ve had better sex than I’ve had in ten years… I want to be a friend.”- Jeff Goldblum’s character actually says this in the movie.\n\nThere’s another scene where Jeremy, unable to participate himself, (he doesn’t know how), watches a group of teenage boys play touch football. This entire scene is shot in the most romanticized, slow motion manner, very obviously making these teenage boys the subject of the viewer’s gaze, in a style that’s usually reserve for nubile young women (think the opening scene of the 1977 movie, Carrie). One of the young men is filmed in loving slow motion, taking off his shirt, as Jeremy surreptitiously peers at him through a doorway. His manner is curious and secretive. When the young man catches Jeremy watching, he attacks him with homophobic slurs, and beats him up.\n\nThere’s something about this scene that’s less disturbing than the previous one. This scene at least serves the purpose of allegory, as Jeremy has already been positioned, within the narrative, as a hated outsider, who must be destroyed. The idea that he might be gay (or Bi) is set up in advance. The indictment of this scene is not in Jeremy’s actions, but in the reactions of the other characters. It also feels somewhat autobiographical on Salva’s part as something very like this scene makes its way into all of Salva’s movies.\n\nActually, the plot of Powder features repeated attempts by Jeremy to reach out and form emotional connections with the other teenagers around him, and he is violently rebuffed every time. Earlier, he tried to form an attachment with one of the young local ladies, but is physically threatened and assaulted by the girl’s father. Jeremy, who is telepathic, desperately craves emotional connection, having lived in isolation his whole life, but finds it impossible throughout the course of the film. On the other hand, you are constantly distracted from the plot by seeing Jeremy’s naked chest filmed in loving closeup for much of the movie.\n\nThis is something that also plays out in some of Salva’s other films, with at least one character trying to form a connection to another, and getting violently rejected, which makes me wonder if this is some personal incident that Salva relates to. Is the reliving of this, over and over, in his movies, the fallout of his stint in prison? Are these bullying scenes Salva’s manner of saying that he was bullied by the state for his predilections?\n\nIn The Nature of The Beast (1995) Lance Hendrickson (Jack) and Eric Roberts (Adrian) play two men of the road. One claims to be a salesman, the other is a no account drifter who decides, for his own amusement, and to his misfortune, to play a Cat and Mouse game with Lance’s character. Adrian tries to form a connection to Jack, but Jack has nothing but disdain for him, and will have nothing to do with the shiftless fellow because Adrian is nothing but trouble. Adrian teases Jack about knowing his deep dark secret, and it is implied that Jack’s secret is that he is gay, though he says he’s not. Actually, his deep dark secret is that he is a serial killer. (And no, I don’t care for the conflation between serial killing and homosexuality, either.)\n\nIn 1999 Salva directed a movie titled Rites of Passage, which I’d never heard of until this post, so I had to Google it. I came across this trailer:\n\nI’m actually intrigued by the subject of this movie, and plan to watch this, if I can find a free copy somewhere. This movie seems like a psycho-sexual thriller, in the vein of Basic Instinct, with more than a hint of The Nature of the Beast. (The term Rites of Passage means an event marking a change in status, most specifically it’s a ceremony or event applied to young boys to mark their transition to manhood.) The entire cast is male and, once again, has a scene where a closeted character is challenged by a straight character about his sexuality, according to the trailer.There is always a no-homo scene in Salva’s movies. Someone is suspected, or accused, of being gay and they have to assert that they’re not.\n\nRites of Passage seems to be a little more straightforward in its depiction of homosexuality, (even though it’s love scenes are filmed in the Calgon Bubble Bath style of filmmaking.) The interesting thing about Salva’s films is its depictions of toxic masculinity in the form of identity shaming. The actual homoerotic moments are filmed in a frank and open manner, with no shame attached to them, and the characters who are accused of being gay are often not ashamed of their behavior, until made to feel that way by some other character.\n\nIts difficult to separate the art from the artist, or know how much of the plot can even be attributed to Salva. Divorced from any background knowledge of the director, the movies actually send a lowkey positive message about homosexuality, and being different.\n\nThe very first time I paid any attention to this director, was after I saw Jeepers Creepers in 2001. I took my youngest sister to see it at the theater, and the homoerotic nudging and winking went entirely over both our heads, at the time. Although in this film, the nudging and winking is less blatant, so its easier to miss. It is only upon repeated viewing that I came to understand that the lead character, Darry,played by Justin Long, is heavily coded as a gay man.\n\nWhile traveling home for the holidays, Darry and Trish run afoul of The Creeper, who sets his sights on acquiring Darry. I remember being surprised at the ending of the movie when Trish, realizing her brother is the monster’s target, offers herself in exchange, but The Creeper rejects her, and takes Darry. I missed a lot of things about Darry because the movie does have another issue that bothered me more and that was the addition of a “Magical Negro”, played by Patricia Belcher.\n\nThe Magical Negro in Jeepers Creepers was like, Hmmm some total white strangers need my help? To the Blackmobile! Brilz\n\nJezelle swans into the narrative to provide what some needed exposition. Every 23 years, for 23 days, The Creeper, is released from his stasis, so that he can eat people. The people he eats seem to consist entirely of pretty, young, White boys, and his modus operandi is to get the scent of some boy he fancies, and pursue them until he can devour what parts of them he needs to reconstitute his decaying body. Since The Creeper is identified as a male, it’s understandable he’d just chase after other males, but nevertheless, we have yet another plot where you have an older male, pursuing young men, which is another staple of Salva’s movies.\n\nI have no idea if Salva is doing this on purpose, or if he’s even aware what he’s doing. Is he teasing the audience with his backstory? Is he trying to work out his personal dilemmas in his movies? Has he changed as a person at all, or is he just trying to normalize pedophilia? I don’t know the man, so I can’t say what’s going on in his head, but it’s clear he’s obsessed with the idea of pretty, young, White men, being chased by older men.\n\nAt one point in the movie, The Creeper is caught sniffing Darry’s laundry, after he’s broken into his car. Darry holds up a pair of pink jockey shorts and says that now the monster knows his name. Why his shorts are pink is explained in the movie, but not why his name is on them. This scene is somewhat gratuitous because there’s no payoff for it. The monster never speaks, and we’re certain he doesn’t care what Darry’s name is, since he already has his scent, so why are we informed that Darry’s name is on his shorts?\n\nAt the time I saw this movie, I was unaware that “sniffing” was even a sexual activity. Like I said, most of the sexual coding went over our heads, but not all of it. Even I thought that scene was odd when I first saw the movie. Part of the reason why this is, is the reaction of the other characters. A waitress witnesses the laundry sniffing and is outraged, but one gets the sense that she’s not upset about the activity, so much as the monster did it in a public place. Earlier, Trish teased Darry about his pink Jockey shorts, but she doesn’t say anything about the sniffing, other than to say she’s surprised the smell didn’t knock him out. She does not react to the idea of a stranger sniffing someone’s laundry. No one in the story finds the idea of laundry sniffing odd or repugnant. ( Not to kinkshame, but if you mentioned such a thing to the real life versions of the small town people in this movie, you’d get that reaction.)\n\nWhen Trish gently implies that he may be gay, Darry just shrugs, and when he finds out the monster has been sniffing his laundry, he seems more upset that The Creeper knows his name, than at the idea that this strange man (at this point they don’t know it’s a monster) has been sniffing his shorts.\n\nThen finally there’s Jeepers Creepers II (2003)\n\nIf you didn’t think anything untoward about all of the scenes I just listed and don’t think they mean anything, than how about the sequel to Jeepers Creepers. All of the most questionable moments of Salva’s movies, are amplified in this movie. In fact his movie continues to make the lists of most unintentionally gay horror movies, but its not at all unintentional if it’s a pattern in all his movies.\n\nIt’s been three days since Darry’s kidnapping and The Creeper, disguised as a scarecrow, snatches a young pre-teen boy right from under his father’s ,and older brother’s noses. Later that day, The Creeper attacks a bus load of boys returning from a basketball game. He kills the coaches, and the heavily coded as lesbian bus driver, before spending most of that day and night, terrorizing the stranded teens.\n\nMost of the plot takes place aboard the bus, giving the teenage boys lots of opportunity to engage in: racist discussions, gay rumormongering, kinkshaming, sunbathing together on the roof of the bus, ignoring the cheerleaders, and strangest of all, peeing in groups. In the first movie, there is a scene of Darry peeing, and another one in Powder.\n\nAt one point, The Creeper terrorizes the teenagers by singling out which ones he’s interested in by licking the windows, so some of his behavior is blatantly sexually predatory, and the teammates argue about his interest in them for some time after this. The issue with these movies is that many of the things,the viewer notices, can be explained away in the moment, and look unintentional. Its only after repeated viewing of all Salva’s movies, and knowledge of Salva’s sordid history, that one realizes that young men, as a rule, do not engage in group sunbathing and peeing sessions, and none of these things are unintended.\n\nScott, one of the team leaders is basically the poster child for entitled, angry White boys. He’s racist, homophobic, sullen, and petty, and spends most of his time attacking the Black players, and the one team member suspected of being gay, named Izzy. At no point in the narrative is Scott set up as a sympathetic character, though, which is also in line with Salva’s other movies. Like all the other bullies in Salva’s movies, he is a cartoon villain, entitled, opinionated, and a massive coward. The hero turns out to be Izzy and his Black teammate, named Double D. They both work hard to save their team mates, and live to the end of the movie. Complicating matters is the arrival of the father of the little boy who was kidnapped at the beginning of the movie.\n\nSalva isn’t a bad filmmaker. He manages to pack some subtle messages about social justice into some effective, action packed movies, and the movies are well directed, and written. But that sordid past, though…\n\nAre we meant to forgive Salva? After all, he’s paid his dues, spent his jail time. He has, as far as the public knows, engaged in no recidivism. Can’t we all forget about it, and move on, as long as he’s following the rules? Is he just working through his issues in his films? Normally we would give the benefit of the doubt, but Salva’s focus on the young male body, and the attendant homo-eroticism in his movies, makes that difficult.\n\n*To read what Salva himself has to say about his past:\n\nhttp://welcome-to-monster-land.blogspot.com/2009/07/directors-dungeon-victor-salva.html\n\nI recently re watched the original Carrie from 1976, which was directed by Brian DePalma, a director that I have tremendous respect for. I have tremendous respect for this movie too, but here’s why I find the 2013 version to be a deeper, more satisfying film. It’s a woman’s movie about women’s issues, directed by a woman. The 2013 version is directed by Kimberly Peirce and addresses and emphasizes themes and issues that were overlooked by all the men who were involved in the making of the original film.\n\nBoth movies cover the same territory. It’s the same plot, same lines of dialogue and all the same characters, but there are some subtle (and not so subtle), but very important differences.\n\nFor example, the remake has a lot less of the “male gaze” in it. The original movie, from its opening scene of nubile, naked, teenage girls, frolicking in slow motion, to DePalma’s closeup of Carrie’s “dirty pillows” on the night of the Prom, to Margaret White’s orgasmic death scene, none of these things are approached, by Peirce from the puerile perspective of the original. The scene of Carrie getting her first period is suitably horrifying in the original, (mostly because Spacek really sells it), but this is also never addressed again, for the rest of the film.\n\nThe remake begins with blood and blood is one of the major characters throughout the rest of it.\n\nThere are three major points of difference from the original to the remake. The first is the depiction of Margaret White. She’s a deeper and much more fascinating character in the remake, given the implication that there was some horrific, sexual trauma, in her past.\n\nThe opening scene in the showers, is replaced by Carrie’s bloody home birth and we get to watch Margaret be shocked that there’s a baby, and then waffling about whether or not she should kill her. This leads to the first question about Margaret’s traumatic past and what could have happened to her that she could engage in the activity that produced Carrie, but not know that “baby” could be a result. It makes you wonder if Carrie is a product of rape, or if Margaret’s sexual trauma extends from some much earlier event, in her life?\n\nThe original Margaret, played to unforgettable effect by Piper Laurie, is a straightforward depiction of religious mania, which only compounds the problem of Stephen King’s depictions of religious people as just “crazy”. In the original, we don’t know why Margaret is the way she is. We can only guess and few clues are given to us. It’s just assumed that Margaret’s always been that way.\n\nIn the remake, she’s given much more depth and motivation, because the implication is that she retreats from relatively normal behavior, into mania and self harm, whenever she cannot approach sex or any sexually related topic, directly. The rest of the time she’s a loving mother, who consoles her daughter, shows emotional connection and is physically affection to her. In the original, Carrie and her mother rarely spoke without fighting and almost never touched.\n\nThe current Margaret infantilizes her daughter but not in an obviously controlling manner. It’s no different from the affection any parent would show their child but coupled with her religious mania and physical abuse, it becomes problematic.\n\nOne of the most interesting differences between these two films is Margaret’s conversation with Sue Snell’s mother, in the laundry where Margaret works. If her self harm, in that scene, is brought about by the presence of Mrs. Snell or the subject of their discussion, it’s not made clear. It is given that Mrs. Snell has known Margaret for years. They went to school together and Margaret is a town fixture, so there is the possibility that she could have played a role in Margaret’s trauma. This is not the impression given in the first film. Mrs. Snell simply finds her a nuisance and tries to get her to go away.\n\nThe second most obvious change is the depiction of Carrie, by Chloe Grace Moretz, an actress I have a tremendous liking for. She’s much less mousy than Spacek’s version. Chloe’s version appears hunched over and closed in on herself as if to protect herself from a blow that never comes. She’s also a lot brighter, I think. Spacek’s version seems kind of dull, shy, awkward and resigned to her fate. The only time we see her show any humor or sass is during the Prom.\n\nWhere Spacek’s character seemed thoroughly housebroken, the current version has a lot more fire in her. She catches on to having special abilities a lot sooner and also the implications of having those abilities. She’s a lot more defiant and argumentative with her mother and is willing to sling bible verses right back at her. This Carrie knows the good book as well as Margaret does, and is willing to use scripture to further her arguments. Spacek’s version, in keeping with a lot of films from the 70’s, mostly just screams a lot.\n\nAt one point, we see Chloe’s version, pleading with her mother to talk to her, implying that her mother has spoken to her before about important subjects. She seems to know or understand that her mother has experienced something horrific and that its sexually related, but doesn’t know what it is. She seems mostly saddened and exasperated by her mother’s inability to approach these topics, without resorting to religious gibberish.\n\nShe’s openly affectionate to her mother. She holds her mothers hands or gently smiles, her eyes shining with love, when her mother calls her “baby girl”. There is love there, on both their parts, which makes it all the more awful when Carrie kills her. When Sue walks in on her, holding her mother’s lifeless body, Carrie’s first statement is that she wants her Mommy and that she’s scared. This scene is heart wrenching to watch. It’s lacking the outrageous sexual spectacle of Margaret’s death in the original. That scene removes any deeper emotional resonance, distancing the viewer from its real impact.\n\nThis film was directed by a woman, so all of the emotional high points center around relationships, rather than actions we are unable to grasp at motives for. For example: Why does Tommy ask Carrie to the Prom? This is something never addressed in the original. In 2013 movie, it’s implied that, he’s a sweet dullard and that’s its Sue, who is in charge of that relationship. He does it because she says so and he loves her.\n\nThe same for Chris Hargensen’s relationship with Billy. Only where Tommy’s dullness is mostly implied by the things he says, we’re given to know, in no uncertain terms, that Billy is nothing more than a dumb thug, who follows Chris’ bidding without question. Any motivation for their behavior is answered by their depictions in the film and that’s all you need to understand about these boys.\n\nIn fact, all of the men are just second stringers. They are backdrops for this female drama. They occasionally have something to say but the real emphasis is all on the women. From the gym teacher, Ms Desjardin, to Carrie, her mother, and Chris, Sue and her mother, the emphasis is on them, their relationships to each other, and what they think and feel about all this, while keeping all of the plot and dialogue of the first movie largely intact, which is very deft filmmaking on Ms. Peirce’ s part.\n\nAnother major deviation, is the relationship between Sue and Chris. After Sue refuses to support Chris in her bid to get back into the prom, Chris goes on a long diatribe against Sue, in front of all their friends. Some motivation is given to Chris for why she hates Carrie. In the remake, it’s one of those inexplicable childhood things. They’ve all known each other since elementary school and picking on Carrie is just what everyone does. It seems to be a school wide thing. No motivation for Chris’ hatred is given in the original film. She just hates her and thinks Carrie eats shit.\n\nThe third major difference is the ending. Carries use of her abilities is very deliberate in the remake, whereas they seemed more of a reflex in the first. Spacek’s character seemed to be in a kind of fugue state, where she seemed not very aware of what she was doing and wasn’t deliberately killing people. In the books she only wanted to hurt them and that motivation is kept intact in the original movie. The burning of the gym, is an accident, made by a girl whose control over her powers, is slipping.\n\nIn the remake, Carrie deliberately kills some people and saves others. Like Ms. Desjardin, who she lifts to safety, away from some electrical wires and water, on the floor of the gym. Other students she purposely crushes between some bleachers and flings into doors and windows. This Carrie is in full control of her powers, noted by Chloe’s hand gestures and body language, which would look pretty cheesy, if the result weren’t so horrific. This version of Carrie knows exactly what she’s doing. Death is not a bug. It’s a feature of her intentions.\n\nAnd no more so, than when she kills Chris Hargensen. In the original film, it looks like she does it as an afterthought, when Billy and Chris attempt to run her over, in his car. Billy is removed from the equation rather quickly, while Carrie gives her full attention to Chris. It is a spectacularly gruesome death. Carrie expresses her full hatred and utter contempt for her childhood tormentor, not just what she does to her, but in her body language, as well. She WANTS Chris to hurt.\n\nSome of the differences are more subtle and have much more to do with the movie taking place in a world of cell phones and social media. Carrie’s humiliation, in the showers, is filmed and then played back during the Prom scene, which is a lot less sweet and treacly than the original. Margaret drives a beat up station wagon and is shown working outside the home. There are no jump scares in this movie and very little humor and I was expecting both. That Peirce chose not to do any of these things, is much appreciated.\n\nDePalma approached this as a Horror movie. Peirce approached it as a psychological drama with some elements of Horror and the difference is noticeable.\n\nAlmost nothing is played for laughs and the acting is a little less histrionic. Peirce has a point to make and cannot be bothered with pointless frivolity. This is a director with an agenda, who has thought long and hard about what she wants to show us and why. Her vision of this is very different from DePalma’s and no moment is wasted.\n\nThis is not to say that the original film is a bad movie, but it is very much a product of the men who created it, with its reliance on spectacle, rather than drama, and hysteria rather than genuine emotions. This is the difference in approach to the same material by two very different film makers. Kimberly Peirce’s movie, is not just a retread. It is a solid, capable film, in its own right."
