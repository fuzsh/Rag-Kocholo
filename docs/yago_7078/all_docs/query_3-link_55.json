Well there aren’t any big franchises to cover for upcoming releases until next month, my Star Wars project is taking a while since The Clone Wars has so many episodes, and I’m in a slasher mood as of right now. So, I decided to watch 2016’s grindhouse, low-budget, torture porn indie hit Terrifier. And I was…whelmed. This movie is fine — an iconic new villain, great kills, and some understandably shoddy acting and writing keep it in the middle-tier of horror quality for me.\n\nSet in Miles County, the film follows two friends, Tara and Dawn, as they leave a Halloween party. In order to sober up before driving home, they get pizza at a local restaurant when the encounter a threatening-looking man in white-and-black clown makeup. Known simply as Art the Clown, the ravenous and psychotic killer starts his Halloween rampage as he craves a path of blood and bone through his various victims. One by one, the subjects of Art’s wrath fall, and the question becomes of which one will live to tell the tale."
