        "text": "Jeepers Creepers 3 is a movie that fans either love or hate and I fall in the camp that loves it.\n\nAllow me to be clear though I love the movie not the films creator Victor Salva who is mired in controversy over an event in his past.\n\nFor me Victor Salva’s terrifying creation of ‘The Creeper’ is one of the few great modern monsters of our time and the two films are gems within the genre. Since the release of Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2 we have waited patiently for Jeepers Creepers 3 which has been in development hell for literally years.\n\nThe plot that appeared online looked to have Trish from the original Jeepers Creepers return 23 years after the incidents that killed her brother. Now 40 and incredibly wealthy she is faced with defending her son from the Creeper teaming up with Jack Taggert and his son to defeat the creeper using every resource she can afford.\n\nIn 2011 Victor Salva was convinced that the movie was going to finally see the light of day when he spoke with BD telling them quote;\n\n“MGM has had it share of troubles since the first two ‘Jeepers’ films came out of United Artists under the lion’s umbrella, and that complicated getting ‘JC3′ (we call it ‘Jeepers Threepers’) made as well, but…it can be made without MGM“,\n\n“MGM doesn’t own the ‘Jeepers’ franchise, Francis Coppola’s Zoetrope owns it. And I think this might actually be the year the film gets made. I hope it is. The third installment has lots of goodies for the ‘Jeepers’ fans, and they have been so loyal – and so patient!”\n\nThat interview was in 2011 and since then what has happened with the project? A fat lot of thing! Since then however fans have clambered for more. Hordes of Creeper fans have absorbed each and every tidbit we have posted on the film always asking WHEN?\n\nFrankly I am beginning to wonder if Jeepers Creepers 3 wont be a reality so long as Victor Salva writes and directs it. As much as I love his creation the man has a controversial history which inevitably always comes up and might be hampering the third film in the franchise. Rumors circled in the summer of 2011 that the project would finally happen and Victor Salva told The Daily Blam\n\n“It has come close several times to going before cameras, and I hope someone sees the wisdom in shooting this, the third and final Creeper tale, I still can’t tell you what the fate of this third film will be. According to IMBD we are already filming – I guess they started without any of us!”\n\nApparently the producers were also interested in doing it 3D. He told the Daily Blam;\n\n“3D would absolutely devastate the script – since the added 2 to 3 million in production costs would strip the screenplay down to a point where it would be smaller in scale than the original Jeepers Creepers. And then even that money dried up. I would say the film has been on and off the front burner at least nine times during the last few years.”\n\nBoth those updates came in 2011 and since then it has been incredibly quite.\n\nThe last news that we got was that the Creeper van had been spotted on the backlots and that it would be released this past summer. Given that the release date has now come and gone it’s a safe bet that Jeepers Creepers 3 is still collecting dust on a shelf somewhere.\n\nSo what is the latest on Jeepers Creepers 3? Quite frankly there is no ‘latest’ on the movie. Jeepers Creepers 3 it would seem is dead and buried… for now. Or perhaps we just need to wait a creepy 23 years!\n\nAre you a fan of the films? Do you want a third Jeepers? Sound off in the comments."
