        "text": "JEEPERS CREEPERS\n\nDirected by Victor Salva\n\nStarring Gina Philips and Justin Long\n\nPlaying at Cinemark\n\nHow do we approach a critique of fine film? How do we deal with the complexities of American cinema?\n\nWe don’t. We went to see Jeepers Creepers instead.\n\nWe are then left with an entirely different set of questions. Why for example and, uh, well, probably why is just about the only question worth asking. Why was the film made? Why did anybody agree to pay for this? Why did we agree to pay money to see this? Why did we voluntarily sit through the whole film?\n\nWe just don’t know.\n\nDirected by convicted child molester Victor Salva (he pled guilty to five felony counts of video taping himself having sexual relations with a 12-year-old boy), Jeepers Creepers is perhaps the most god-awful piece of film ever. And a child molester directed it. Before we even attempt to tackle the emotional complexities of this movie, let us both note that Salva was convicted of molesting a young boy and filming it. This isn’t even Robert Downey Jr.’s perpetual abuse of heavy narcotics. The first film that gained Salva any notoriety involved him having sexual relations with a 12-year-old boy.\n\nBut here comes Hollywood! They figure, hey, it’s been a few years since the whole “Salva makes video of himself having sexual relations with a 12-year-old boy” incident, so why not give him a few million dollars and some cast-off teen actors and throw them in a movie together? You know, because when you have a director with a little notoriety coming into his first feature horror film, it can only be a plus. Oh sure, headlines like “Director Made Another Film Before Jeepers Creepers Involving Himself Having Sexual Relations with a 12-Year-Old Boy” aren’t necessarily the best headlines, but hey, free press is hard to come by.\n\nSo Salva and his team of monkeys lodge themselves in a hotel room and produce a feature length script that takes them only eleven-and-a-half minutes to complete. They then watch Spectravision porn for the rest of the night, because, you know, Salva’s into that kind of thing. The script that resulted contains no more than 15 minutes worth of material, which by Salva standards translates into an 83-minute film. Salva takes a look at the script after his monkeys have fallen asleep, dumbs it down a little so it isn’t too high-falutin’, then goes back to Hollywood and say he has something ready to go.\n\nThus, Jeepers Creepers.\n\nSalva and the monkeys didn’t really think they needed to weigh the movie down with likable characters, so we got Justin Long and Gina Philips as the movie’s lead roles, Darryl and Trish. Both are, surprisingly, intelligent and down-to-Earth characters whose tale of woe makes it easy to sympathize with them. Or cheer for their total destruction at the hands of Mr. Jeeper Creeper. It’s one or the other and the jury is still out.\n\nAnyway, the brother and sister team, in a loosely constructed situation that has them driving a long way home from college, are in ‘random’ state and see a big, huge truck. The truck tries to run them off the road. So when the truck passes them and disappears, they forget about it right away, and we hope they try to get the hell out of ‘random’ state as soon as they can. But what they really do is stop and investigate the situation when they later see the driver of the death-truck dumping bodies down a pipe. Because nothing is smarter than to investigate. Always with the further investigation in these horror movies!\n\nOf course, Darryl falls down the pipe and discovers the evil lair, underneath a “spooky” abandoned church, of the guy seen dumping bodies. The man has been taking the bodies and sticking them onto the walls. And at this point, like any good horror film, there is nudity. And like any horrible, poorly written film directed by a former child-molester, the nudity involves fake looking, waxen corpses nailed to walls.\n\nSome more scary stuff happens, and Darry somehow escapes. This is how you might recap the film for your friends. “Well, then this scary thing happened, and there was sort of some eerie stuff…” because you really don’t have any other frame of reference for the film. We were watching, and in the back of our minds, we were thinking, “hey, a child molester was paid to make this film.” Meanwhile, Darryl and Trish continue on their way down the empty highway. They pull off at a diner to get help, where, inexplicably, they are ignored by creepy townsfolk, no doubt because they are stars of a film called Jeepers Creepers directed by, you guessed it, a convicted child-molester.\n\nHere’s where the “plot” gets muddled. They get a phone call at the diner by a woman who somehow knows their name and that death-truck has been tailing them. Then, in one of the movie’s more absurd gimmicks, she tells them to beware the song “Jeepers Creepers.” Why? Because it’s the name of the film…the monkeys who helped on the script tried to convince Salva to do something else, but he was insistent.\n\nBrother and sister finally convince some police officers to follow behind them down the highway, and not surprisingly, Creeper brutalizes the officers. Oh, and the song finally debuts in the movie.\n\nSigh.\n\nSalva, despite the numerous strikes against him (child-molestation charges being right at the top of the list), has to-this-point created a film that has a gossamer fine level of suspense. In true fashion, Salva kills it. He shows the Creeper.\n\nDarryl looks like a weakling. He’s maybe five foot eight, he weighs 120 pounds soaking wet, he’s ridiculously thin and he has a rose tattoo around his belly-button. Not exactly a tough guy. So when the Creeper finally seizes him, we’re suddenly left to acknowledge the fact that the Creeper is maybe two inches taller than him and not much bigger. He’s also a creepy alien like thing. And…uh…there isn’t much more to it.\n\nThe final climactic scene is totally destroyed by the sudden realization that, unlike a good movie monster, you’d probably stand a good chance against the Jeeper Creeper in a straight up fight. Darryl, of course, doesn’t fare as well, but I won’t ruin the ending.\n\nExcept to say that it is as disappointing as the rest of the movie and you’re left right back where you started: why? Why did Salva choose to end the film that way? Why did Salva choose to end the film that way? Why did Salva choose to end the film that way?\n\nJeepers Creepers indeed, if anyone has those peepers, we’d suggest watching anything else."
