        "text": "Everyone who applies from Norway and has sent an application electronically must also book an appointment electronically by logging in here.\n\nIf you are not able to book an appointment electronically, you must contact the police where you live (external website) directly to manually book an appointment.\n\nSome applications can only be filled out on paper. If you have sent a paper application to UDI and therefore do not have an electronic case, you must contact the police where you live (external website) directly to book an appointment.\n\nThese applications can only be filled in on paper:\n\nfirst-time application for protection (asylum)\n\nresidence permit due to strong humanitarian considerations\n\nresidence permit for victims of abuse\n\nkeeping a permanent residence permit (if you are applying from abroad)\n\nextension of visitor’s visa\n\nWhen you fill in your application electronically, you select the country you are applying from. You will then receive information about which embassy is responsible for receiving your application and sending it to UDI. On the receipt page of the application, there will in most cases be information about where you must meet.\n\nOn the website of the embassy or VFS application centre, you will find information on how to hand in your application documents. At some meeting points, you must book an appointment, while at other meeting points you can meet directly.\n\nApplications for citizenship\n\nWhen filling in the online application form, please choose the embassy or consulate closest to you. When handing in your documents on the checklist, please go to the embassy/consulate you selected in the application form or the Norwegian embassy or consulate-general which is easiest for you to get to (external website). You must book an appointment in advance.\n\nWhen you booked your appointment, you received a confirmation of the time and date by email sent from the police.\n\nIf you cannot find this email, you can log in and select the application to find the appointment.\n\nIf you are having problems and you are not able to find the details of your appointment, please contact the office where you have booked the appointment (the police, the embassy or the VFS Application Centre).\n\nBooked appointments can be rescheduled, changed or canceled via a link in the email from the police or through UDI's application portal \"My applications\" (my.udi.no (external website)), where you will find these options on your application's receipt page.\n\nPeople who have received an email with the title \"The Immigration Service is changing the appointment booking solution\" must contact the police to change their appointment (external website) if there is a need to change.\n\nOnly the police have access to the booking calendar. Therefore, you cannot contact UDI to book or change an appointment.\n\nNo, you must book an appointment with the police closest to where you live or where you are going to live. If there are several police stations accepting applications in the police district you belong to, you must choose one of those as a meeting place when filling in your application.\n\nAfter you have sent the application, it is unfortunately not possible to change the place of attandance to submit the case or documents. The application is sent exclusively to the police station you chose and is not accessible for other police stations. If there are no free appointments at the meeting place you selected, you must check for free appointments later.\n\nIf you have chosen the wrong place of attendance, you must fill in, send, and pay for a new application. In the new application, you must choose the correct place of attendance to submit your application. If you paid a fee for the first application, you must contact the police (external website) you sent the first application to and request a refund.\n\nIf you have already filled in the electronic application and have paid any potential fees, the application will be marked «completed». Then, it is not possible to change the information you have submitted in the electronic application.\n\nIt is also not possible to change your appointment location or book an appointment at another location to submit documents. If you have applied to the wrong location, you must reapply and possibly ask the police or the embassy to refund the fee on your first application.\n\nThe embassy or the police can edit minor errors in the information in the application when you attend your booked appointment. You must bring written information about what you want the embassy/police to change for you.\n\nMany applicants do not have to meet twice with the police now. If you are a citizen of a country outside of the EU/EEA and provided biometric identifiers when you handed in your application, you do not need to meet with the police again after a decision is made in your case. For many applicants, the police can order a residence card without the applicant meeting a second time in the same case. The letter you receive together with the decision, will inform you whether you must meet with the police again or not.\n\nPersons who still must book a follow-up appointment are:\n\nemployees where the employer has applied online on behalf of the applicant\n\nresidence permits where the applicant applied from abroad\n\nresidence permits where the applicant handed in the application to the police before the new biometrics system was introduced on 16 April 2021\n\ncitizens of countries outside the EU/EEA who have been granted a family immigration permit with a person who has EU/EEA rights in Norway, and who handed in the application before 16 April 2021 (the police then need biometrics for the residence card)\n\nIf you need to book a new appointment after you have received a decision from UDI / the police, you must book one by logging in and selecting the application.\n\nThe application fee can only be refunded if you have not yet attended your appointment to hand in the application in person. If you have sent an application where you are not required to meet in person, but only need to upload the application documents electronically, you cannot get the fee refunded after you have uploaded the documents.\n\nIf you want your application fee refunded, you must contact the police district or the embassy responsible for your application. UDI cannot assist you with reimbursement.\n\nIf you have already handed in your application in person but wish to withdraw it, even if you will not be reimbursed, you must notify us in writing. You can write a short letter explaining that you wish to withdraw your application. The letter must be signed by you, the applicant. You must send the letter electronically. When we receive the information that you want to withdraw your application, we will dismiss the case and send you a written confirmation.\n\nAs a general rule, we can only dismiss a case if the applicant sends a written request to withdraw the application. Dismissing means that we close the case without processing it.\n\nIf you are a reference person, sponsor or host parent and wish to withdraw your consent for the applicant to stay with you in Norway, you must send a written notification of this to UDI. You can write a short letter in which you explain that you wish to withdraw your consent for the applicant to stay with you. You must send the letter electronically. If you withdraw your consent, this will be stated in the decision (rejection) that the applicant receives.\n\nWe cannot dismiss a case because the reference person/sponsor/host parent wishes to. If any of these persons want to withdraw the application, we must still process the case, but it will be rejected on the basis that consent has been withdrawn.\n\nIf a person with power of attorney wishes to withdraw the application due to a separation, we must still process the application, but it will be rejected. The power of attorney expires when we receive information about the separation.\n\nThe application fee cannot be refunded when the reference person/sponsor/host parent withdraws consent. This is because the application will be processed.\n\nThe main rule is that you must attend an appointment and hand in your documents at the police no later than one month before your residence permit expires. Only then will your application have been submitted.\n\nIf you have a renewable permit and have attended your appointment at the police and submitted an application for renewal or permanent residence permit one month before your current permit expires at the latest, you have the same rights as your current permit.\n\nIf it is not possible to get an appointment with the police before this deadline due to a long waiting time, it is sufficient that you have registered the application online no later than 37 days before your permit expires. If you have applied later than this, UDI must assess concretely whether you can still get the same rights.\n\nIf you already have a permanent residence permit or permanent right of residence, you still have the same rights even if you do not have a valid residence card. For example, you still have the right to work, you have the same rights to receive benefits from NAV, and you are still registered as a resident in Norway in the National Population Register. The police also have access to records where they can see that you have a permanent residence permit or permanent right of residence. You should not travel abroad without a valid residence card.\n\nSuppose you have a residence permit that can be renewed (information on this can be found in your decision letter), and you have not been able to book an appointment with the police before the date of expiry of the permit. In this case, you can document legal residence yourself.\n\nIf you have registered an application for renewal or permanent residence permit online within thirtyseven (37) calendar days at the latest before your current permit expires, you have the same rights as your current permit, even if you have not yet met with the police.\n\nYou can document this to public offices or employers by showing your residence card and your decision letter together with the receipt for the application received online.\n\nYour residence card shows the date your residence permit expires. The receipt reference number shows the time when the application was registered. The first four digits of the number show the year the application was registered. The next four digits show the date (YYYYMMDD). For example, the receipt number beginning with 20200815 shows that you registered the application on 15 August 2020.\n\nHow can you find the receipt for a registered application online?\n\nTo see the receipt, you must log in, go to the overview of your applications, select the relevant application and press \"Go to application\". This will bring you to the receipt page.\n\nYou can not contact UDI for confirmation\n\nUDI will not see when you have registered the application online in our computer systems and can not confirm that you still have the same rights as for your current permit. You must follow the instructions above to document legal residence until you have an appointment with the police.\n\nYou can document this to public offices or your employer by showing your residence card and your decision together with the receipt generated when you registered your application online.\n\nYour residence card shows the date your residence permit expires. The receipt reference number shows the time when the application was registered. The first four digits of the number show the year the application was registered. The next four digits show the date (YYYYMMDD). For example, receipt numbers beginning with 20200815 show that the application was registered on 15 August 2020.\n\nHow can you find the receipt for a registered application online?\n\nTo see the receipt, you must log in, go to the overview of your applications, select the relevant application and press \"Go to application\".\n\nYou should not contact UDI for confirmation\n\nUDI does not see when you have registered the application online in our computer systems. Therefore, we are not in a position to confirm that you have the same rights as your current permit. You must follow the instructions above to document legal residence until you have an appointment with the police.\n\nIf you are an EU/EEA citizen, you can document that you have a right of residence to other public offices with the documents provided for the group to which you belong in this list.\n\nThe family members of an EU/EEA citizen have a right of residence in Norway if the EU/EEA citizen has a right of residence. Suppose you are a family member of an EU/EEA citizen. In that case, you can show that you have a right of residence by documenting that your family member, who is an EU/EEA citizen, has a right of residence in Norway. You can do this as described above. You must also be able to present documentation of your family relationship with the EU/EEA citizen.\n\nIf you have booked an appointment, you still have this appointment.\n\nIf you cannot remember when the appointment is, you should search your email inbox for emails from the police. You will then find the email with the time and date of the appointment. You will also find an email with the list of documents you must bring to the appointment.\n\nIf you have already handed in your application documents, we will process your application as normal. UDI sends all the necessary correspondence to you on Digipost or by regular post.\n\nIf you have received an answer to your application and you are going to book an appointment with the police to take a picture for a residence card, you must use the same account as when you registered the application. If you no longer have access to this account, you must contact the police to make an appointment (external website).\n\nIf you experience technical problems, you can contact the police (external website). If you send an email, please include screenshots and an explanation of the problem.\n\nAll recent application forms that you have submitted electronically to the UDI can be found on the My applications (external website) page. If you cannot find the application form you submitted before April 2022 in the overview there, this application is in our old application portal. This means that you can no longer find your way back to the application form on our website. If you want to have access to an older case or need to see the application summary of it, you may contact the UDI in writing here."
