        "text": "Winter Wonderland in Spikersuppa, Oslo\n\n11 November - 31 December\n\nSpikersuppa, one of the capital’s Christmas fairs, lasts for well over a month. It takes place by the Spikersuppa skating rink on Oslo's main high street, Karl Johans gate, a mere stone’s throw from the Royal Palace. This year, the market will once again be held as normal, with all hands on deck to deliver a magical Christmas in Oslo.\n\nThe market features delightful food stalls, a romantic ice skating rink, and brand new family attractions including a new Ferris wheel!\n\nChristmas market in Bergen\n\n1-22 December\n\nWith its unique traditions and world-famous cultural stage, you'll find it fun and high-spirited to celebrate Christmas in Bergen!\n\nThe Christmas market is placed in the heart of the city, at Festplassen. It features the traditional Ferris wheel and horse carousel. There will be a large Christmas tree and a unique holiday atmosphere. The popular stalls from previous seasons will also be awaiting your visit.\n\nChristmas market in Lillehammer\n\n2-3 December and 9-10 December\n\nIf you’re dreaming of a snow-covered winter wonderland, Lillehammer is a safe bet. The quaint city by Lake Mjøsa is located about an hour and a half from Oslo Airport by train.\n\nDiscover how Christmas was celebrated in the Middle Ages, at the Maihaugen open-air museum – which hosts a festive Christmas market on the first weekend of Advent.\n\nA visit to see the arts and crafts at the creative hub Fabrikken is a must, and you should stop by Lillehammer Art Museum, too. Afterwards, you can seek out the perfect Christmas gifts in the city's festively decorated streets.\n\nIf you want to get active in the snow, combine your trip to Lillehammer with a day or two in one of the nearby top-notch ski resorts Hafjell and Kvitfjell, which are usually open from November. You might also be brave enough to try the bob and luge track used at the 1994 Winter Olympics – and if not, you can take the chair lift to the top of the Lysegårdsbakkene ski jump for a fantastic view.\n\nChristmas market in Trondheim\n\n3-20 December\n\nTrondheim is such a cosy Christmas town with lots to experience.\n\nAt the Christmas market in Trondheim, you’llcome in close contact with farmers and craftspeople eager to tell the stories behind their wares, whether you’re showing interest in a ceramic bowl at the wooden stalls or some exotic jam in the tent that is home to the Farmer’s market.\n\nLarge lavvo tents serve as both café and indoor stage, featuring fireside troubadours, local food, and a theatre performance for children.\n\nLastly, at the Torvscenen stage, you’ll find a constant stream of talented artists and bands putting on concerts for the benefit of the Salvation Army’s charity work.\n\nChristmas market in Røros\n\n7-10 December\n\nIf you’re looking to get into the holiday spirit, there are few places on this earth more suitable than Røros, the town that inspired Disney’s megahit “Frozen”. With its old wooden houses, a multitude of crafts shops, and cosy cafes, Røros is the kind of place where it’s hard not to feel a touch of Christmas the first day the snow settles in the streets.\n\nAnd then the real magic starts. Children with rosy cheeks and locally produced artisan wares like knitted gloves, glassware, cured sausages, smoked salmon, and woodwork line the streets during what could conceivably be named the mother of all Christmas fairs.\n\nThis is where you go for a horse-drawn sleigh ride underneath a sheepskin blanket, or to have close encounters with actual reindeer. For kids, the real adventure will probably be a visit to Santa.\n\nJul i Viken, Christmas market in Lillestrøm\n\n5-10 December\n\nJul i Viken is one of the newer Christmas markets, which will be held at both Norges Varemesse and in the centre of Lillestrøm. Jul i Viken offers lots of fun for the whole family, with over 30 planned activities.\n\nHow about taking Christmas dinner to new heights this year? With Dinner in the Sky, you can enjoy Christmas lunch or dinner while soaring 50 metres above the ground!\n\nYou’ll find traditional Christmas market activities including a ferris wheel, indoor amusement park, food and arts and crafts stalls and a porridge party. In addition, you can take an alpaca walk or sleigh ride, meet Santa Claus, or take part in building the futuristic gingerbread town! Don’t miss the grand opening December 2-3, where you can see a spectacular 3D light show projected onto the buildings at Lillestrøm Torv!\n\nChristmas at Bærums Verk\n\n25 November - 21 December\n\nExperience a good, old-fashioned pre-Christmas celebration at Bærums Verk, with Christmas trees, horse and cart, Christmas music and performances.\n\nHere, you can listen to Christmas stories at Verket 1814 and admire crafts in the old workers’ houses. Join a historical walk or a sculpture park tour and let the little ones take part in fun Christmas workshops. The last four Sundays before Christmas Eve, you can buy locally-sourced treats – for yourself or to put under the Christmas tree – at the Farmer’s Market.\n\nNorsk Folkemuseum’s annual Christmas fair\n\n2-3 December and 9-10 December\n\nOne of Norway’s most popular Christmas markets is Norsk Folkemuseum’s annual Christmas fair, and understandably so. At the open-air museum in Oslo, visitors can buy Christmas gifts from more than a hundred stalls as they wander through a historical retelling of Christmases both decades and centuries past.\n\nThe whole museum is decorated in line with various customs and eras, allowing you to experience anything from Christmas Eve in a fancy merchant’s home in 1769 to the home of a rural Norwegian family in 1959.\n\nPre-Christmas adventure in Henningsvær\n\n3 November - 23 December\n\nNorthern Norway is about much more than the midnight sun – especially as the Christmas spirit is lurking around the corner. And few places in Norway convey the mood of this holiday like Henningsvær bathed in northern lights.\n\nWith tall mountains and deep fjords as a picturesque frame you can buy local glass crafts and ceramic (or make your own!), dive into regional delicacies such as the Lofot caviar and paté, or borrow a kicksled for cruising the wintry streets.\n\nChristmas in The Fortified Town\n\n25 November - 17 December (weekends only)\n\nThe square in the fortress town of Fredrikstad has been busy with trade, shopping and Christmas preparations at this time of the year for many generations.\n\nThe star-shaped old town is also the backdrop for both a Christmas TV-show and a Christmas movie, so maybe you’ll feel like you’re in a Christmas fairytale yourself while wandering in the charming streets. The Christmas market is held the three first weekends in December."
