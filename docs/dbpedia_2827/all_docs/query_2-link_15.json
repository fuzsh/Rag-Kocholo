With over 800,000 jobs linked to both entities combined, they stand as the largest economic driving force in Miami-Dade County! What‚Äôs good for PortMiami and MIA is good for The Miami Tunnel, further strengthening our relationship and getting people where they need to go through our toll-free tunnel. This includes the 7.3 million cruise passengers in 2023 who traveled through MIA and the tunnel to board their cruise terminal at the Port. That same year, eight new cruise ships arrived in PortMiami, one from each of their major cruise lines. At the 2024 State of the Ports, Director Hydi Webb of PortMiami spoke of utilizing environmental initiatives to promote sustainability that will further economic impact. This includes PortMiami and The Miami Tunnel‚Äôs shared mission of clean energy. Portmiami, through Shore Power, allows docked cruise vessels to plug into the local electricity grid and turn off their auxiliary engines. The Miami Tunnel, talks about LEDconversion and EV fleet. Thus contributing our Net Zero commitments to the Port supply chain. Miami Tunnel supports the growth and development of PortMiami and Miami International Airport and our combined economic impact on our South Florida community. Together, we‚Äôre proud to work towards a more sustainable and prosperous future!

The DOTr is gaining headway in its initiative to put up the Manila Bay-Pasig River-Laguna Lake (MAPALLA) Ferry System that will introduce another mode of transport in Metro Manila and Southern Tagalog. The DOTr is also thinking of an all-electric ferry fleet, with multiple stations,‚Äù . Based on initial design, the DOTr will replicate the Chao Phraya River Ferry System in Thailand and the New York Ferry System in the US in building MAPALLA. This will not be a tourist ferry system. When one talks about ferries, there is the tourist and there is the commuter. This is going to be the commuter type\n\nNext week, Niels Astrup, Aqua superPower's Business Development Manager Nordics, will be presenting at a key stakeholder conference at B√∏lgen b√¶rekraftsenter , exploring how Agder can take the lead in electrification at sea. Municipalities and counties hold some of the most important keys to speeding up the market for electric boats in Norway. Many people lack knowledge about what opportunities municipalities and counties have, and how to take advantage of them in practical terms. Electrification applies to leisure boats, the tourist industry, fishing boats, small ferries, work boats, water taxis, etc. The conference includes local politicians to discuss what municipalities and key stakeholders in the south of Norway (Kristiansand) can do to help speed up the charging infrastructure in Norway. Check out the full programme of this important conference here: https://lnkd.in/e39pPzgZ #electricboats #cleanboating #cleantech #emarine #sustainability #netzero #marinefastcharging #charginginfrastructure #aquasuperpower\n\nRed Rocket South Africa (Pty) Ltd was honoured to have shared our Input in doing our part to develop the Electric Vehicle Charging network, held by the National Department of Transport led by Bopang Khutsoane (MBA). They gathered all the greatest minds & biggest players in the Electric Vehicle Charging Industry, as they are looking on working together on the implementation of the ‚ÄúGreen Transport Strategy‚Äù. This working session was facilitated by GreenCape led by Prian Reddy. Red Rocket South Africa (Pty) Ltd is doing their part in trying to boost the Electric Vehicle Industry and on a mission to create world moved by the energy that is created by nature. #DepartmentOfTransport #GreenCape #evcharginginfrastructure #EVcharging #southafrica #greentransportstrategy\n\nüìØ The SMAUG_EU project partners revealing is continuing üë®üíºüë©üíº! üîä Today, we present ‚öì Drammen Havn (Port of Drammen) üì£ The port of Drammen is one of Norway's most efficient logistics and transportation hubs connecting sea ‚ôí, rail, and road. üî∑ As a multimodal hub for goods handling, the port of Drammen operates across 5 primary segments: üîπrolling cargo (RoRo),üîπdry bulk,üîπliquid bulk, üîπcontainers, and üîπproject cargo. üî¶ For decades, the port of Drammen has been Norway's largest entry port for vehicles, with a 70 % market share. The port aims to operate emission-free by 2030 and works continuously to reduce climate impacts. üåä In SMAUG, the port of Drammen will be primarily occupied with hosting a test site with challenging conditions in Norwegian waters! üî¶ Learn more about Drammen Havn (Port of Drammen): https://drammenhavn.no/ #smaugEU #horizoneurope #maritimesecurity\n\nIn the ports of Rostock, Puttgarden and R√∏dby, Scandlines' electric cars are whirring around and fit in well with the ferry operator's green agenda. Scandlines is always at the forefront of innovative solutions in green ferry operations and has since 2013 implemented various ground-breaking projects such as hybrid ferries, low-noise, energy-saving thrusters and rotor sails to continuously reduce the environmental impact of ferry operations. Next step is zero emission ferry operations. Scandlines has committed itself to zero emission operations on the Puttgarden-R√∏dby route by 2030 and to zero emission operations across the business by 2040. Scandlines' first zero direct emissions ferry will be deployed in 2024. Sometimes Scandlines' electric cars and hybrid ferries even meet üöó ‚õ¥ #scandlines #zerodirectemissions #greenagenda\n\nFollowing the success of #Tallinn's night bus pilot #project this year, the city has announced that night buses will now operate year-round, including new routes to N√µmme and Viimsi. Adjustments to existing routes will also be implemented, enhancing accessibility for more passengers. The city has allocated 830 000 euros for the night bus service for the upcoming year. Currently, four routes are operational until the end of the year. Bus route 91 heads to Mustam√§e, 92 to V√§ike-√ïism√§e, 93 to Pelguranna, and 94 to Priisle. Starting in January, routes 95 to Viimsi keskus and 96 through M√§nniku to Vana-P√§√§sk√ºla will be added. For Tallinn residents, the service is free of charge, while regular ticket prices apply to other passengers: https://lnkd.in/dF4sntNK #transportation #infrastructure #gettingthingsdone #success"
