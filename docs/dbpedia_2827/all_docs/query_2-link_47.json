        "text": "By plane\n\nThere are direct flights to Norway from many destinations in Europe and from the Eastern coast of the US. When travelling from Australia or New Zealand, you’ll need to transit through Asia, the Middle East, or Europe.\n\nOslo Airport is Norway's main hub, with scheduled flights to and from more than 100 international destinations. Oslo is also the main domestic hub from which it is easy to fly to your final destination in Norway.\n\nThere are also many international and domestic connections to Bergen, Kristiansand, Sandefjord, Stavanger, Tromsø, and Trondheim.\n\nThere are also more than 50 smaller airports in Norway, making even remote places such as the Lofoten Islands, the North Cape, and the Svalbard Islands easily accessible by plane. Norwegian domestic carrier Widerøe has connections to more than 40 airports in Norway, while Norwegian and SAS have direct connections in Norway and to more than 70 European destinations.\n\nFrom Oslo Airport you can reach Oslo city centre in 20 minutes with the Flytoget Airport Express train. Express buses and local trains (a cheaper option) are also available.\n\nBy train\n\nAn extensive rail network links Norway to the rest of Scandinavia and Europe. There are regular train connections to Oslo from Copenhagen, Stockholm and Gothenburg.\n\nMost train journeys from the continent are overnight, and you will find sleeping compartments on all of them. A variety of discount passes are available for train travel in Europe and Norway.\n\nHaving arrived in Norway, it's easy to explore both Fjord Norway and the rest of the country right up to Northern Norway by train, on some of the world's most beautiful railway journeys.\n\nBy car\n\nThere are numerous border crossings by road to Sweden. Norway also borders Finland and Russia. Customs checks are in place at all major crossings and there are certain visa requirements for Russian citizens.\n\nThe main entrance from Sweden: The E6 motorway runs through Malmö, Helsingborg, and Gothenburg in Sweden, before crossing the border at Svinesund in the south-east of Norway.\n\nThe main entrance from Finland: The E8 motorway runs through Turku, Vaasa and Oulu in Finland before crossing the border at Kilpisjärvi.\n\nThere are regular car ferries between Norway (the Oslo region and Southern Norway) and Denmark, Sweden and Holland (scroll below for more information).\n\nIf you want to sail your own boat to Norway, there are guest marinas with facilities all along the coast.\n\nMany cruise lines call at Norwegian ports, mostly by the fjords and in pretty coastal cities such as Bergen, Stavanger, Ålesund, Trondheim, and Oslo. Others offer cruises to the Svalbard Islands, Honningsvåg, Tromsø, Hammerfest, and Bodø in Northern Norway.\n\nSet sail on a northern lights cruise in the winter or experience the midnight sun on deck in the summer! One of the most popular cruise lines in Norway is the historical coastal express Hurtigruten, which has often been named “The world’s most beautiful voyage”. The coastal express, Havila, also sails the same route, and its new ships are designed to be the Norwegian coast's most environmentally friendly vessels."
