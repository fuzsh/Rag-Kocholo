By the Tønsberg harbor you can travel back in time at Vikingodden to experience the true size reconstruction of the legendary Oseberg Viking Ship and Klåstadskipet. You may try sailing a Viking longship too, if you dare!\n\nExplore the remains of Scandinavia’s largest medieval fortress and learn more about Tønsberg’s incredible history at the Slottsfjell museum. The Haugar Vestfold art museum is a popular venue for contemporary art. Music festivals like the Vestfold Festspillene sets the tone of the city the whole year through.\n\nSouth of Tønsberg lies the beautiful island group Færder renowned for its remarkable beaches and skerries. Thousands of tourists come here in the summertime. In Færder you’ll find the islands Nøtterøy, Tjøme and Hvasser, where you can enjoy lazy days in the skerries, by the harbor or at sea.\n\nThe scenic spot The World’s End, Verdens Ende is situated at the southernmost tip of Tjøme. Its unique lighthouse makes it a popular destination even when all elements of nature are in play!\n\nGet in-depth travel information on Tønsberg and Færder’s official website."
