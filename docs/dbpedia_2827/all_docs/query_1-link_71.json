        "text": "Acceptance of the Loss Damage Waiver relieves the renter and authorized additional drivers of responsibility for loss of, or damage to the Avis car, when they comply with the terms and conditions listed on the rental document jacket. At the time of rental, the customer must initial whether he/she accepts or declines the LDW and optional services. LDW and optional services must be signed for at the rental counter.\n\nLDW is taxable.\n\nIf LDW is not accepted, the customer is financially responsible for the full value of:\n\nAccident damage\n\nGlass damage\n\nStolen items (radio, battery, etc.)\n\nVandalism\n\nTheft of the car\n\nExceptions:\n\nIn Wisconsin, if LDW is not accepted, the renter is liable for all loss or damage to the Avis car due to an accident or reckless, wanton behavior.\n\nIn Illinois, if LDW is not accepted, the customer is financially responsible for up to the full value of the vehicle.\n\nIn cases of theft not due to the customer’s negligence, the customer liability would vary based on the vehicle group rented, ranging from $5,000 to $40,000.\n\nIf the theft occurs due to the customer’s negligence or complicity, the customer is financially responsible for up to the full value of the vehicle.\n\nCanceling LDW\n\nOnce LDW has been purchased, it must remain on the contract. The customer has the option to return the car & close the rental agreement; however, this could change the rate for the rental agreement and a different, possibly higher, rate could apply for a new rental.\n\nExceptions:\n\nCustomers who rent in New York and purchase LDW in New York can decide to cancel this service at no charge, within specific guidelines:\n\nRental must be 2 days or more.\n\nThe cancellation must be within the first 24 hours of the rental.\n\nThe actual renter must take the car to an Avis location for inspection & must sign a cancellation notice.\n\nLoss of Use\n\nThe customer may also be responsible for reimbursing Avis for the revenue lost by not being able to use the car while it is being repaired or not recovered due to theft (referred to as Loss of Use).\n\nGlobal insurance coverages are always subject to change. Please verify at time of rental.\n\nAvis accepts most major credit cards as credit identification at the time of rental. The renter's name must be on the credit card.\n\nSpecialty or Signature Series Vehicles: 2 CREDIT CARDS in the renter's name are required to rent ALL Specialty or Signature Series vehicles.\n\nAccepted credit card list: Avis Charge Card, American Express, AT&T Capital, Diner's Club Int'l, Discover, China UnionPay, JCB, MasterCard, and Visa. Some locations may not accept each of the referenced cards.\n\nYou may be subject to a credit check or present additional identification. Acceptable forms of additional identification are: Valid passport or travel visa, military identification, birth certificate, marriage license, ATM card with customer name printed on face of card, health care identification card with customer’s name printed on face of card or company/college/university identification with a photograph. In some cases, you may be required to present an alternate credit card.\n\nAvis may request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated rental charges of the rental, but reserves the right in its sole discretion to request an extra value to be based on certain factors as we deem appropriate:\n\nMost rentals may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $200.00 USD.\n\nIf you have prepaid the rental, the hold amount will be $250.00 USD.\n\nWhile this hold is in place, the funds will not be available for your use. When the rental is over, we will process the reversal, but the bank may take time to post it back to the account.\n\nNote: Prepaid credit cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location. One of the above mentioned cards must be presented. Prepaid credit cards are accepted at time of return only.\n\nParticipating locations will accept a Debit card, however, it must have an accepted bank processing logo (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, Discover, etc) at the time of rental if you are at least 18 years of age, in the state of New York, and the following requirements:\n\nThe name of the renter must be on the debit card.\n\nA debit card is accepted as credit identification for Economy cars, Compact cars, Intermediate cars, Standard cars, Full-size cars, or Standard SUV's. The rental of any other vehicle category will require a major credit card.\n\nAt airport locations, you will be required to show proof of a return airline flight that corresponds with your rental.\n\nYou will be subject to a credit check to determine and ensure credit worthiness before releasing the car to you. If your credit file is frozen with Equifax, you will be required to lift the restriction prior to your rental. Lifting the restriction does not guarantee that you will be able to rent a vehicle as you will still be subject to a credit check.\n\nAvis will generally request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated rental charges of the rental, but reserves the right in its sole discretion to request an extra value to be based on certain factors as we deem appropriate:\n\nMost rentals may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $200 USD.\n\nRentals of 4 days or more may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $300 USD.\n\nIf you have prepaid the rental with a debit card, the hold is $250.00 USD.\n\nTHESE FUNDS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR USE. When the rental is over we will process the reversal, but the bank may take time to post it back to the account. If you fail to return the vehicle as agreed, Avis will obtain additional authorizations from your account to cover the rental charges. Avis is not responsible for any returned checks or overdraft fees based on this policy.\n\nPositive identification in addition to your driver's license may be required.\n\nNote: Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location. Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are accepted at time of return only.\n\nFuel Service Charge. Most rentals come with a full tank of fuel, but that is not always the case.\n\nWhere available, if permitted by law, if you drive less than 75 miles, you acknowledge that we will add a flat fee to the rental, the amount of which will be disclosed on the Rental Contract and at the counter prior to rental. You may avoid this charge at time of return by providing a receipt for fuel purchased at which time the flat fee will be reversed from your total rental charges. If this subparagraph (a) does not apply, there are three refueling options:\n\n1) If you do not accept the fuel service option, where available, at the beginning of your rental, and you return the car with less fuel than was in it when you received it, as we determine in our sole discretion, we will charge you a fuel service charge at the applicable rate per-mile or rate per-gallon specified on the Rental Contract or disclosed at the location. The per-mile rate is used if you do not buy fuel during the rental. To calculate this amount, we multiply the number of miles driven, as shown on the car’s odometer (or provided by the vehicle's telematics device), times the per-mile rate shown on the Rental Contract. The per gallon rate is used if you buy fuel during the rental and provide us with a receipt on our request, but the tank is not as full when you return the car as when you received the car (by using the factory installed gauge, rounded down to the nearest 1/8 tank), times the per-gallon rate shown on the Rental Contract.\n\nAlthough two methods are used for ease of calculation, the per mile and per-gallon rates produce approximately the same result. Some of our cars are equipped with onboard telematics which record the actual amounts of fuel in the gas tank. In the event your car has such a device, you will be charged for the actual amount of gasoline needed to fill the tank based on the reading of this device.\n\n2) If you accept the fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will not pay us a fuel service charge. If you choose this option, you will not incur an additional fuel service charge, but you will not receive any credit for fuel left in the tank at the time of return. If you accept the partial fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will pay a fuel service charge for any fuel not covered by the partial fuel service option. The per-gallon cost of the fuel service option will always be lower than the fuel service charge. The cost of refueling the car yourself at a local service station may be lower than the fuel service charge or the fuel service option. You acknowledge that the fuel service charge is not a retail sale of fuel.\n\n3) You may avoid a fuel service charge if you return the car with the fuel tank as full as when you received it and, if requested by us, present a receipt for your fuel purchase. If you put fuel into the car, you must use the correct fuel (having the grade of gasoline stated on the car fuel information decal, or on-road diesel). Do not use ethanol fuel even if the car states that it is a flex-fuel vehicle.\n\nE-TOLL COLLECTION DEVICE AVAILABILITY\n\nTOLL PAYMENT TAG PASS\n\nYou are responsible for payment of all tolls incurred during the rental period. We offer an optional service called e-toll that allows customers to use electronic toll lanes on highways, bridges, tunnels, and other tolled passages. All vehicles are pre-equipped to electronically process tolls. If you do not pay cash for tolls, you automatically opt into our e-toll service to which you agree to pay us or our toll program administrator with whom we will share your credit card/debit information for all tolls incurred during your rental and all related fees, charges, and penalties. The e-toll fees may take 4-8 weeks after the rental to be billed to your credit card/debit card on file.\n\nE-TOLL SERVICE CONVENIENCE FEES\n\nFor our corporate renters who use their corporate discount number (AWD) on the rental contract, the convenience fee for e-Toll usage is $5.95 USD for each day the E-Toll device is used during the rental with a maximum of $29.75 USD per rental contract (plus toll charges).\n\nFor all other customers, the convenience fee for e-Toll usage is $6.95 USD for each day the E-Toll device is used during the rental with a maximum of $34.75 USD per rental contract (plus toll charges).\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nAll toll charges incurred will be paid at the maximum prevailing non-discounted or cash rates posted by the toll authority.\n\nThere are NO service charges if e-Toll is NOT USED during the rental duration.\n\nE-TOLL UNLIMITED\n\nAvailable at participating locations in the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nIf you use the unlimited E-Toll service, all cost of tolls and convenience Fees are included. For this service, you pay a flat fee of $10.99 up to $23.99 USD per each day of the rental period, regardless of whether or not you incur any tolls, or a flat fee of $54.95 up to $119.95 USD per week. E-toll unlimited must be purchased at the beginning of the rental.\n\nOPTING OUT OF E-TOLL\n\nIf you do not choose e-toll unlimited at the time of rental, you may avoid the standard e-toll fees on any given day during the term of the rental if you ensure the transponder shield box is in the \"closed\" position and you pay cash for all tolls, use your own adequately funded, properly mounted and compatible electronic toll device to pay for all tolls, or pay the toll authority directly and follow the toll authority rules and requirements.\n\nFor more information on tolling, please visit avis.com/etoll or check at the time of rental."
