Go to sederskier.com and become a member of GripWax Nation today!\n\nWe spend some time reflecting on our interview with Mika Vermeulen PLUS dive into the Olympic Track and Field Trials, which wrapped up on Sunday.\n\nWe talk about:\n\n- Val Constien's magical steeplechase and what every athlete can learn from her journey?\n\n- Matt Wilkinson's meteoric rise from DIII MIAC runner to Olympian\n\n- Parker Valby - has she reached her ceiling? What are her options moving forward?\n\n- Hobbs Kessler - the biggest winner of the meet?\n\n- Shane Cohen - the biggest disappointment of the meet?\n\n- Graham Blanks - an open and honest interview on coming back from injury...\n\n- Athing Mu and SML - two different paths when it comes to stewardship of star talent.\n\nSupport the SederSkier Podcast: https://seder-skier.com/support-the-sederskier/\n\nWe kick off our fifth season with some news from Norway — Marit in as head coach, altitude training is out for Kruger, and what was your favorite Sjur Rothe moment? Plus, is Frida actually done? What would her retirement mean for the support.\n\nOur second half of the show includes some thoughts from the USSS congress in May, including a play-by-play from a former Olympian's Facebook post.\n\nDon't forget, our subscriber-only pod — \"Gripwax Nation\" — makes its debut on Wednesday. For 99 cents a month, you can listen to us lay our sports media lives on the line for your entertainment pleasure...\n\nMy wife told me I had to do a podcast today...I'm serious!\n\nFirst half of the show - we take a look at today's sermon from First Baptist Church of Leadville and apply it to sports.\n\nSecond half - Christie Sederquist asks the host, her husband, questions about being a father.\n\nHave a great day everyone!\n\nWe discuss the importance of the afternoon mocha and some drama we've encountered trying to find it at local gas stations over the last winter....\n\nPlus....is 'fun' a good compass/motivation for athletes? Or is it a symptom of a deeper problem.\n\nAnd...my wife has seen \"Hoosiers\" for the first time.....how does that connect to skiing? Take a listen and maybe you'll find out....\n\nMatt Liebsch is the part-owner of Pioneer Midwest and Brian Gregg is a financial advisor.\n\n....oh yeah, and they're both former World Cup skiers.....\n\nMost importantly: they're also DADS.\n\nIf you've ever ski-raced a major marathon in North America, you probably saw their names at the top of the results list...you know they can still bring it on the course. Today on the show, we look at how these two elite-athletes juggle family, fatherhood and fitness at various stages of a career — from World Cup dreaming to master-blaster screaming.\n\nThis is a good one, people.... you won't want to miss it!\n\nThe future of U.S. Skiing has been the focus of the podcast all month....and today we bring you our interview with the queen of that convo: 18-year-old Sammy Smith.\n\nThe multi-sport superstar chats about...well, everything — how she started in the sport, how she balances soccer and skiing, her plans and goals for next year and beyond and whether or not she feels any pressure to take the baton from Kikkan and Jessie.\n\nThanks for hopping on the show, Sammy!\n\n***Interview starts at 15 min. Sorry for the two minutes of silence! Ajee screwed up the editing....\n\nPart 3 of our interview series with the U.S. Ski Team's young stars continues with Will Koch!\n\nJoin us to hear about CU's epic comeback at NCAA nationals, Will's relationship with his dad and his goals for next year.\n\nIt was a pleasure to chat with this young man, and his passion for the sport comes out in all of his answers. Enjoy!\n\nSpecial double episode!\n\nFirst, we tell you about the most under-appreciated endurance sports performance by an American woman....\n\nThen, we give you the details on our 10th-anniversary/BDAY getaway from kids at Snow Mountain Ranch....\n\nPlus, a spring grooming update and other shenanigans sure to redirect opponents of Gripwax Nation to other podcasts...\n\nThen, we sit down for a 55-minute chat with APU's Zanden McMullen.\n\n(about the 30 minute mark for those of you who want to zoom ahead!)\n\nGet to know the 22-year-old Alaskan, who closed the season with 17th and 20th-place finishes in the Drammen and Falun World Cup sprints and claimed 12 top-30 finishes this season.\n\nWe grade the U.S. Ski Team on the first two weeks of the World Cup, plus talk about the state of Klaebo, get interrupted by crying babies, and discuss the true solution to elevating the ski game in our country.\n\nPlus...Ski or Die is out on the SC Play site, and we've watched all three episodes...they're awesome! Find out what tugged at our heartstrings at the end.\n\nWe discuss our trip down to Colorado Springs to cover the state xc meet, which included a little scoping out of the Barr Trail, the Pikes Peak Ascent course.\n\nPlus, Zak Ketterson switches to Leki poles and Erik Bjornsen launches his own pole company....we talk about OneWay, Swix, Leki and the USSPC differences....and the ski pole invention we don't think will change really anything....\n\nSnow has fallen in Leadville - so it's time to get out and log some K's...\n\nKeep on striving. Keep on skiing.\n\nKlaebo drama has morphed into Klaebo confusion, but first, we talk about a pitch-black rollerski session in downtown Leadville, the perfect real-life segway into how to squeeze training into 'real life'...plus, we discuss who is the most valuable Salomon athlete - Courtney, Jessie or Sophia - plus our reactions to Jessie Diggins announcement that her eating disorder has resurfaced, a Facebook post on wax restrictions, and some thoughts on the Super Tour schedule.\n\nThanks for joining us for the show. If you have questions, suggestions, complaints, etc, send us an email at sederskier@gmail.com.\n\nThe pitch was: 'hey, I wonder what the old Denver Nuggets play-by-play was thinking from the Colorado Rockies booth when his old team won their first NBA title?'\n\nOur conversation went way beyond that, however, and for good reason. Jerry Schemmel has done a lot. In addition to broadcasting, he's also biked across America a few times (won the RAAM two-person event in 2015), written a book, survived a plane crash, and earned a law degree.\n\nIf you like hearing from successful people who live with intentionality, you'll appreciate this man's Nuggets of wisdom.\n\nCheck out the Vail Daily for a profile I wrote on Jerry.\n\nWe split things up — first half is mostly running and the second is Nordic skiing — in this bonus double-length episode of the best cross-country ski podcast ... English-speaking ... on this side of the Atlantic. ....\n\nFirst, Sederquist talks about what makes the Mountain Games in Vail so special, why high school should go back to one class (maybe two), and the aspect of Jakob Ingebrigtsen's greatness no one is mentioning. Then, we analyze Alayna Sonneyn's interview with David Norris regarding national team selection criteria.\n\nStick around for the end — we've also received nominations for the 2024 preposterous statement tournament, and they're excellent.\n\nWell, last week's show was all nonsense celebration and preposterousness, but on this edition of the SederSkier Podcast we get into the meat of the matter.\n\nFirst, we honor the life of NSIC legend Paul Yak, who passed away last week - a tremendous runner we lost far too soon.\n\nThen, it's right into the ins and outs of all things hot, controversial XC skiing takes....and there's serious controversy.\n\n- What's wrong with ski journalists and the difference between being in PR and writing hard news pieces.....\n\n- A nice climate-change rant...\n\n- What do we think of the FIS Games?\n\n- The Russians are banned again - but the IOC doesn't agree with FIS....why? And, how is the Russian online press covering this?\n\n- Why do we think Klaebo was thrilled about the Norwegian team cutting its budget\n\n- We close with some EPIC controversy hidden deep within the FIS congress committee reports\n\nThere's a lot of really important Nordic news out there to get to (Klaebo leaving the national team, Russians getting banned, FIS Games ...what is that? ....) and at some point, we will discuss it, but first: more important stuff.\n\nThere is no better way to kick off season 4 of sederskiing than going back to last year....and finally paying off our tease to hand out some year end awards. We have male and female performers of the year, moments of the year, race of the year, Sporthill Slo-mos of the year, Americans of the Year, quote of the year, and, of course, the Preposterous Statement of the Year.\n\nWe also read a listener email (if you'd like to email the show, reach out to sederskier@gmail.com).\n\nYou might not learn anything, but that's ok, there's other podcasts for that. We've got long rants, luke-warm hot-takes, and probably totally uncalled-for analogies in a sport so niche it's carried this even-more-niche show to the number four slot in \"Nordic Ski-specific podcasts in Lake County, Colorado.\"\n\nEnjoy.\n\nFormer 24-hour xc ski distance world record holder Teemu Virtanen joins us for a show that will please not only double-pole dorks world wide but every single person who sets goals and goes after them.\n\nOn this show, we pick the Ski Classics commentator's brain about his recent attempt at taking back that 24 hour record - how he prepared, how it went, all that…\n\n....we also talked about his life in the U.S., and how he went from dropping skiing cold turkey while he worked in Hollywood…that’s right…all before he ever went over 400k in a day…\n\nFinally, we chatted about DP technique and the state of the ski classics union...listen to find out whether or not it's coming to North America....\n\nThank you Teemu! It was so fun talking to you!\n\n*We are aware that our audio from 1:11-1:18 was missing...it has now been included! Sorry...Ajee, our interim producer is actually a three-year-old Border Collie/German Shepherd mix, so this shouldn't come as a huge surprise....\n\n\"But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part\n\nFor a hero's strength is measured by his heart,\"\n\nIf you don't have the right appreciation for Rosie Brennan, you will after this show.\n\nAt 34 years old, the two-time Olympian — twice cut by the U.S. Ski team — was fourth in the overall World Cup standings, the second time she’s done so in the last three years. She finished fifth in the World Championships 30k, said by some to be one of the best distance performances by an American skier ever. We talk about everything – the past, the future, skis, development, and what question she'd prefer a journalist to ask her in the finish zone.\n\n\"It's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward\n\n...that's how winning is done!!!!\"\n\nThanks Rosie!\n\nHey folks!\n\nJust a little update on what's coming!\n\nWe spoke to Val Constien and Rosie Brennan today and can't wait for those shows to drop so stay tuned, invite your friends, and feast on some of those old episodes (wouldn't you just like to hear a 2021 World Cup TDS rant right about now!?). Plus, shoot us some questions we should ask Teemu Virtanen before Monday's interview with the long-distance legend who just fell short of the 24hour world record ski attempt.\n\nKeep on striving...keep on skiing....\n\nas;dlkfja;slkdfj;a slkdfj;a sldkfj - Novi's message to GripWax Nation (still more coherent than a lot of my content, if I'm being totally honest.)\n\nSSCV U.S. Junior National Champion Will Bentley makes his soundbyte debut and there's so much to rant about going into the final World Cup weekend in Lahti! Are the Swede's cheating? Is the World Cup point system broken? Body-image inconsistency again?! Equal waxes? Could Klaebo come to Leadville for an altitude training camp?!\n\nWith all of that to rage about, you know we had to kick things off with a story about Novi's first trip to Olive Garden and a random ski picture that is at the Brass Armadillo in Denver.....still.....\n\nHere's the rundown (listen to what you'd like. Or, don't listen at all....it's not that good anyway.....)\n\nShownotes:\n\nStart: We got to the big city to go to Olive Garden and Novi proves she has no regard for human life when it comes to unlimited breadsticks\n\n8:30: Antique store ski photo saga\n\n11:30 Falun 10k recap\n\n13:00 Rosie and Jessie on 10k in Falun\n\n16:00 - Ben Ogden talk\n\n26:00 guys 10k/Klaebo\n\n31:00 - World Cup points issue needs fixing\n\n37: Falun sprint and Rosie and Jessie Clips\n\n42: no one can say a women’s race is boring anymore\n\n43:00 - Is Sundling overrated?\n\n48:00 - Swede’s in trouble?\n\n51:30 Listener email on wax and body issue\n\n1:04 - is it ok to write about junior athletes and what Sam Smith should do\n\nWe were on site in Leadville, Colorado for the fourth annual Equinox 24hr Ultra Ski and spoke with winner Tayte Pullman as well as runner-up John Henry Paluszek. The pair duked it out for about 200k before Pullman pulled away. We also talked with a 16-year old high school junior who went over 100k and the founder of the event, Dan Batwinas and his son Jacob, who stayed up all night on his birthday to count laps.\n\nWe'll have Falun World Cup coverage/recap/discussion coming later in the week.\n\nWe talk about the salient features from Day 3 of the World Champs, which featured Team USA getting its first medal of the week. Plus, we forgot to touch on some stuff from the skiathlon, including how we were the only ones who praised Rosie Brennan's incredible grit in finishing out the race after a big fall.\n\nAll that and more!\n\nAll kinds of hot takes here.... Klaebo a major disappointment? Yes. Choke in fact. Novi Sederquist running the mic? You bet. Discussing the girls race? A little, but not enough....we totally forgot to chat about Ebba but I'm confident I'll get another chance to talk about the Swedish superstar....\n\nStick around to hear from Rosie and Sydney as well!\n\nThank you for joining us! Tell you friends and subscribe!\n\nNovi opens the show and we give our predictions, followed by quick reactions from Day 1 of the World Champs.\n\nComing at you at 100 mph....\n\nPlus, at the end, we discuss some new waxes that haven't hit the market yet but could revolutionize your training and racing.\n\nWell, we won't be announcing worlds, but that's ok....also...\n\n*Ben Ogden had more podcast appearances last week than I had bowls of oatmeal, which is saying something. But....what's the podcast he listens to? (Also, tune back and listen to our 2020 interview with Ogden, one of my all-time favorite shows!)...\n\n*Our thoughts on Les Rousses (yes, it's still worth talking about)....\n\n*How much should a citizens race cost anyway? (and, shoot us an email if you have a fun, well-run race we should check out next year)\n\n*Random rambling and long-winded dissertations about nonsensical foolishness\n\n*Bonus interviews: stick around for the last few minutes to hear from Sophia Laukli, Novie McCabe and Will Koch....\n\nJacob Huseby has been in the wax trucks of the major nations on this year's world cup and he's here to spill every secret. Plus, is Peltonen poised for a comeback? If you're like me, those two elements will keep you listening the entire show....if not...well, why are you searching for Nordic ski specific podcasts on Apple/Spotify/Google to begin with!!!\n\nEnjoy the show and head on over to enjoywinter.com to check out all their sweet gloves, glasses, wax and much more!\n\nEnjoy this evening conversation with Andy Liebner, the most fascinating figure in cross-country skiing.\n\nRetired pro skier, former Alaska cross-country running high school state champion, author of Wild Shot, and founder and owner of the United States Ski Pole Company, Liebner has about 45,000 hours worth of great stories, but we pack as much as we can into one. Stay tuned to learn more about:\n\n1) how USSPC poles are made and what makes them different from the other brands\n\n2) if USSPC poles are on the World Cup (you might be surprised)\n\n3) where the lightest ski pole on earth can be found\n\n4)something you didn't know about an all-time xc ski legend\n\nIf you want to buy a pole that performs and doesn't break, (and have the option of custom designing the shaft), visit https://usskipoles.com/\n\nBefore Nina Schamberger and Rose Horning were knocking on the door of the World Cup, they were knocking on each other's doors in America's highest city. Both grew up in Leadville, got on skis a few days after they could walk, and are on the cusp of the big stage.\n\nGet to know a couple of America's bright young Nordic hopes on this episode, pubbed from the hospital one day after Christie and I welcomed little Ella Jane Sederquist to the world....in case you were wondering, somehow I got in a nice 30k DP session at Frisco Nordic Center on the day Ella was born.....life is one big training session.....\n\nThank you to Sporthill and United States Ski Pole Company for supporting us this season! Check them out for your apparel and Nordic ski pole needs!\n\nhttps://www.sporthill.com/\n\nhttps://usskipoles.com/\n\nSome instant reactions from stage 5 and stage 6 of the Tour de Ski....\n\nOgden talks about something Klaebo did in the 15K CL....\n\nEmail us with questions, comments at sederskier@gmail.com\n\nOr...think about supporting my glide wax fund by becoming a paid supporter. We're poor and skiing is expensive.\n\nWe hop on the mic with basically zero prep and deliver basically a Kirk Gibson, game-7-esque podcast performance....including:\n\n* epic rant about Krueger\n\n* incredible, first-ever technique insight on Klaebo - what is the newest subtechnique he is creating...\n\n* perfect analysis of the American performance and praise for Diggins\n\n* But we spared our rant about taking feeds in a 40 minute race....see poll below\n\nThanks to boots-on-the-ground Tom Horrocks, we have soundbytes from Gus, Hunter and Ben talking about TDS stage 3. Plus, we discuss Diggins and Brennan and what to look forward to in stage 4. Enjoy!\n\n*I went skiing halfway through this episode....thought trains were inadvertently sent down various tracks, some never to return to the station."
