Introduction\n\nWhy do states seek to agree on maritime boundaries? Three\n\ntypical situations might be distinguished in this regard:\n\n* substantial activities subject to coastal state jurisdiction are\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 245\n\nbeing conducted or are likely to be conducted in an area of\n\nactual or potential dispute;\n\n* one or both states wish to stimulate uses, particularly fixed\n\nuses, of the area in question;\n\n* there is no significant activity or interest in the area requiring\n\na boundary.\n\nA. Substantial Activities Being Conducted\n\nThe first situation arises where substantial activities subject\n\nto coastal state jurisdiction are being conducted or are likely to\n\nbe conducted in an area of actual or potential dispute. In this\n\ncase, if either or both states attempt to enforce their jurisdiction,\n\nparticularly against each other's nationals or licensees, there is\n\na risk of serious escalation of the dispute. The consequences\n\nmight include a decline in useful economic activity, inability to\n\napply meaningful environmental or economic regulations, political\n\nanimosity extending beyond those persons whose livelihoods\n\nare affected, private violence, or demands for escort with the\n\nattendant risk of direct confrontations between the armed forces\n\nof the two states.\n\nThe transfer of control over vast high seas fisheries to coastal\n\nstates by virtue of extensions of fisheries jurisdiction to 200\n\nnautical miles presents the typical case. Once jurisdiction is\n\nextended, both coastal and distant-water fishermen who visited\n\nthe area yesterday (and perhaps many yesterdays) need to know\n\nwhere they may fish tomorrow. The basic choices governments\n\nhave for avoiding confrontation arising from overlapping claims\n\nare explicit or tacit agreement on a permanent or interim boundary,\n\nexplicit or tacit joint management within a defined area,\n\nexplicit or tacit agreement on mutual restraint with respect to\n\nthe exercise of jurisdiction over at least each other's nationals\n\nwithin a defined area, or unreciprocated unilateral restraint.1\n\nThis probably explains the reasons for a significant number\n\nof delimitation agreements concluded after one or both states\n\nextended jurisdiction over fisheries to 200 miles, in most cases\n\n1. Absent express or tacit agreement on geographic limits roughly defining the\n\ndisputed area, the \"defined area\" for joint management or mutual restraint might\n\nencompass areas extending well beyond those likely to be in dispute, potentially\n\nembracing the full economic zones of both parties.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n246 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nduring or following the Third United Nations Conference Law of the Sea.2 From this perspective, the delimitation can be seen as a response to a need to agree on something\n\nand an inability or unwillingness to rely on restraint or arrangements at least over the long term.\n\nIn almost all cases, the agreement also reflects a preference\n\nfor a unilateral rather than joint management regime in principle,\n\nnotwithstanding the practical need for joint arrangements conserve and manage migrating fish stocks and transboundary\n\necosystems and the probable transboundary effort patterns fishermen. The overwhelming majority of states has responded\n\nto the fisheries problem with defined geographic boundaries. state appears to have entrusted a court or arbitral tribunal delimitation dispute with the authority to impose biologically\n\nand economically inspired fisheries management and allocation\n\narrangements as part of a boundary regime in lieu of or in to a fixed boundary.\n\nThis suggests the continuing influence of the dominant\n\npolitical and legal approach to formal accommodation of competing claims to use and control on land: geographic with fixed, preferably precisely defined, geographic boundaries.\n\nTo put it differently, while the extension of coastal jurisdiction over fisheries places a mobile resource exploited mobile vessels under the potential control of more than state, the choice of a geographic boundary as the preferred means for accommodating and partitioning the respective\n\ninterests, even where that boundary divides single stocks, and effort patterns, may well reflect the dominance political factors and legal habits over ostensibly dominant and economic concerns.3\n\n2. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, opened for signature\n\nDec. 10, 1982, U.N. Doc. A/CONF.62/122, 21 I.L.M. 1261 [hereinafter U.N. Convention\n\non the Law of the Sea]. For example, Mexico wished to settle its maritime\n\nboundary with Cuba prior to the effective date of its decree establishing an exclusive\n\neconomic zone that extended its fisheries jurisdiction to 200 miles. See Agreement\n\nConcerning the Delimitation of Sea Space, July 26, 1976, Cuba-Mex., Limits in the\n\nSeas, No. 104 (1985). The relatively rapid agreement between the United States and\n\nCuba may be due in part to the fact that a dispute over fisheries enforcement could\n\nhave been quite nasty, particularly if it involved Cuban exiles residing in Florida.\n\nSee Maritime Boundary Agreement, Dec. 16, 1977, U.S.-Cuba, S. Exec. Doc. H., 96th\n\nCong., 1st Sess. 1 (1979) [hereinafter U.S.-Cuba Maritime Agreement].\n\n3. The history of the Gulf of Maine adjudication is instructive. Two agree-\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 247\n\nApologists for this system may argue that after, or at least\n\nin connection with, agreement on the boundary it becomes easier\n\nto address the problem of mutual cooperation in management in\n\na formal manner. They might point to the Australia-Papua New\n\nGuinea agreement with respect to fisheries.4 They might also\n\npoint to the practice of arriving at unitization agreements where\n\na fluid nonliving resource such as an oil or gas deposit is traversed\n\nby a political boundary or concession limit.\n\nB. Desire to Stimulate Uses\n\nThe second situation prompting a delimitation agreement\n\narises where one or both states wish to stimulate uses, particularly\n\nfixed uses, of the area in question. The classic example\n\nwould be exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf for\n\noil and gas, preceded perhaps by prospecting or scientific research.\n\nThe organization of the oil and gas industry generally\n\nassumes an exclusive legal right to extract the resources of an\n\narea with respect to which major site-specific investments are to\n\nbe made.5 A dispute between neighboring states over the area\n\ncasts doubt on that right.\n\nAs compared with fishing, exploitation of seabed hydrocarbons\n\nis a relatively recent development. By the middle of the\n\nTwentieth century, virtually all of the world's seabed hydrocarbons\n\nwere still unexplored and unexploited. There was plenty of\n\nroom for the new industry outside boundary regions. The rapid\n\nemulation by other states of the Truman Proclamation's claim to\n\nthe continental shelf did not pose an immediate practical need\n\nments were presented to the United States Senate. One submitted the question of a\n\nsingle maritime boundary to a Chamber of the International Court of Justice. The\n\nsecond dealt with fisheries, moderating the effect of an adjudicated boundary on the\n\nfishing interests of the parties. The Senate approved the first but not the second\n\nagreement. The first agreement was not amended to permit the Chamber to impose\n\nmeasures to moderate the effect of the boundary on fisheries' interests and the parties\n\ndid not commit themselves to do so before the Chamber. However, Canada described\n\nthe general bilateral fisheries management relationship between the parties\n\nin glowing terms. It should surprise no one that the line drawn by the Chamber\n\nappears in effect to be sensitive to certain fisheries' allocation problems.\n\n4. Treaty Concerning Sovereignty and Maritime Boundaries in the Area\n\nKnown as Torres Strait, Dec. 18, 1978, Austl.-Papua N.G., 1978 Austl. T.S. No. 4\n\n[hereinafter Australia-Papua New Guinea Treaty].\n\n5. Indeed, it would seem that this need for exclusivity was a major driving\n\nforce behind the formulation of the legal doctrine of the continental shelf.\n\n6. Proclamation No. 2667, 10 Fed. Reg. 12,303 (1945).\n\nAnnex 186\n\n248 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nfor delimitation agreements in most areas. Not surprisingly, need was first perceived in oil-rich shallow semi-enclosed such as the Persian Gulf.\n\nWhile the lure of potential seabed riches has a significant\n\npolitical impact on governments, it would appear that potential\n\nboundary disputes with respect to the seabed are more manageable\n\nthan fisheries disputes, and pose less of a political risk of\n\nescalation. Governments that wish to avoid provoking their\n\nneighbors may refrain from taking affirmative actions necessary\n\nto authorize oil and gas activities, or may make them subject to\n\nfuture boundary arrangements.7 Legal uncertainty will itself\n\nhave some restraining effect on the oil and gas investor, typically\n\na transnational company with substantial alternatives for investment.\n\nPut simply, in the case of oil and gas, it will usually take\n\nsome affirmative governmental action to trigger an escalation.\n\nIn the case of fisheries, the fishermen may well force the issue.\n\nThis is particularly so because those with the fewest alternative\n\neconomic options are likely to be the coastal fishermen of the\n\nstates concerned and the coastal communities they help support.\n\nThis is not to suggest that governments are unmoved by the\n\nrisk of an escalating dispute in seeking to agree on seabed\n\nboundaries in areas of potential economic interest. The fear of\n\nan unfavorable status quo and the desire to achieve a favorable\n\nstatus quo are omnipresent in politics and diplomacy. Governments\n\nare under constant pressure to take potentially provocative\n\nactions designed to reinforce their claims. Lawyers trained\n\nin the influence of history and possession upon legal rights and\n\nin doctrines of estoppel may themselves add to this pressure.\n\nTaken together, the opinions of the Court in the Eastern Greenland?\n\nTemple of Preah Vihearfand Tunisia-Libya Continental\n\n7. In theory, the coastal state's rights with respect to the continental shelf\n\nincluding commercial prospecting and scientific research should accelerate the pressure\n\nfor reaching a boundary agreement. These activities, however, are conducted\n\nfrom ships over broad areas and generally do not require economic exclusivity. To\n\nsome degree, satellite data obviates the need for on-site observation. Thus, either\n\nneglect or mutual restraint can postpone the pressure to agree on precise delimitation.\n\n8. Legal Status of Eastern Greenland (Den. v. Nor.), 1933 P.C.I.J. (Ser. A/B)\n\nNo. 53 (April 5).\n\n9. Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thail.), 1962 I.C.J. 6\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 249\n\nShelf0 cases may have some unforeseen, arguably unjustified,\n\nbut nevertheless unsettling effects in this regard.\n\nThe argument for a fixed boundary as opposed to a joint\n\nmanagement arrangement may be stronger in the case of fixed\n\nuses such as oil and gas development than in the case of fisheries.\n\nThe resource is not mobile. The exploitation activity is not\n\nmobile. Judge Jessup's observation in the North Sea Continental\n\nShelf cases11 that the real issue in continental shelf delimitation\n\nis allocation of valuable resource deposits seems not to have\n\nstimulated very much interest in joint management regimes. It\n\nis also not clear that the imposition of a direct joint management\n\nsystem on a disputed field or resource deposit is the best\n\nway to stimulate new investment or manage the resource. Some\n\njoint arrangements provide for geographic division of management\n\nauthority between the states concerned.\n\nThe environmental effects of oil and gas development, however,\n\nare not necessarily localized. Pollution in a boundary region\n\nmay affect several coastal states. While the United States\n\nmade some arguments in this regard in support of its position\n\nconcerning the location of the maritime boundary in the Gulf of\n\nMaine,12 as in the case of fisheries there appears as yet to be\n\nno significant tendency to deviate for environmental reasons\n\nfrom the political tradition of a fixed boundary, except perhaps\n\nin the unusually sophisticated agreement between Australia and\n\nPapua New Guinea.13\n\nC. No Significant Activity or Interest\n\nThe third situation is perhaps the most intriguing. It arises\n\nwhen governments seek to agree on a maritime boundary despite\n\nthe absence of significant activity or interest in the region\n\nrequiring a boundary.\n\n(June 15).\n\n10. Concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunis, v. Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), 1982\n\nI.C.J. 18 (June 24) [hereinafter Tunisia-Libya Continental Shelf Case].\n\n11. North Sea Continental Shelf (F.R.G. v. Den.), 1969 I.C.J. 3 (separate opinion\n\nof Jessup, J.); North Sea Continental Shelf (F.R.G. v. Neth.), 1969 I.C.J. 3 (separate\n\nopinion of Jessup, J.) [hereinafter North Sea Continental Shelf Cases].\n\n12. Concerning Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine\n\nArea, Oct. 12, 1984, 23 I.L.M. 1197.\n\n13. See supra note 4, at 4.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n250 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nIn this regard one might bear in mind that, with the notable\n\nexception of areas where the land boundary divides a navigable\n\nriver at its mouth or an otherwise important navigation channel\n\nor route is involved, navigation and overflight are activities do not normally require a precise determination of which has jurisdiction in a particular area, especially when that area beyond the territorial sea. Freedom of navigation and overflight\n\nbeyond twelve miles from the coast is generally respected. within the territorial sea, ships of all states enjoy a right innocent passage. Ships and aircraft are frequently able to disputed boundary regions close to shore. It would appear extended coastal state jurisdiction over pollution from ships sea is too new (and the potential source of pollution too transitory)\n\nto generate much pressure for a maritime boundary for regulation purposes.\n\nIf there is no significant activity requiring a boundary, do governments negotiate boundaries in such circumstances?\n\nA possible answer can be found in the desire to avoid potential\n\ndisputes in the future where there are now none.14 unclear whether this objective, in and of itself, often explains\n\nthe behavior of governments. It is nevertheless likely to influence\n\nlawyers, and lawyers are likely to influence maritime\n\nboundary policy.\n\nThere may also be something special about boundaries that\n\nstrengthens the desire to settle them even in the absence of a\n\nsignificant problem. Biologists might point out that some other\n\nmammals mark their territory, and that this marking has the\n\neffect of controlling disputes. Scope of jurisdiction lies at the\n\nheart of administrative law. Bureaucracies are preoccupied with\n\njurisdictional limits. There is an almost palpable desire to demonstrate\n\nclearly (in this case, on a map) where power and responsibility\n\ndo, and do not, exist.\n\nThus, it is not surprising to discover that some governments\n\nhave embarked on a general program for the purpose of settling\n\nmaritime boundaries in areas of extended maritime jurisdiction.\n\n14. Canada and Denmark are said to have been motivated by the desire to\n\navoid future disputes in a largely unsettled area where Greenland faces the Canadian\n\nArctic. See Agreement Relating to the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between\n\nGreenland and Canada, Mar. 13, 1974, Den.-Can., 950 U.N.T.S. 147.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 251\n\nSuch a program is most evident in the case of states that must\n\nnegotiate boundaries with a significant number of other states.\n\nColombia, France, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and the United\n\nStates are among the examples.\n\nWhen one examines these examples, one is struck by the\n\namount of activity related to islands and dependencies located at\n\nsome considerable distance from the continental mainland or\n\nmain islands. The United States has concluded a substantial\n\nnumber of maritime boundary agreements with respect to its islands\n\nin the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, but has yet to\n\nagree on three of its four extended maritime boundaries with\n\nCanada or its boundary with the Bahamas. Colombia's boundary\n\ndispute with Venezuela remains unresolved.\n\nThe most obvious explanation is that it is easiest to reach\n\nagreement in the case of small islands surrounded by the deep\n\nwaters of the Caribbean Sea or the Pacific Ocean where the\n\nboundary regions are unlikely to contain hydrocarbons or localized\n\nfisheries.15 While the interest of small Pacific island states\n\nin regulating foreign tuna fleets may explain some of their interest\n\nin maritime boundaries, the highly migratory patterns of\n\ntuna greatly reduce the significance of the location of any particular\n\nboundary. There is little to inspire attempts to deviate\n\nsignificantly from equidistance in areas between small islands of\n\ncomparable size where few if any resources are at stake.\n\nThere may however be other political factors at work. One\n\npossible implication of a maritime boundary agreement is recognition\n\nof the right of the state party to the agreement to conclude\n\nthe agreement on behalf of the land territory from which\n\nthe maritime jurisdiction extends.16 The studies of Colombia's\n\n15. Not much is known about commercial concentrations of high grade manganese\n\nmodules in most places, not to mention subsurface hard mineral deposits. In\n\nlight of factors such as alternative sources of supply, market demand and cost of\n\nextraction, their present economic value, if any, is not regarded as great.\n\n16. Delimitation negotiations between Australia and the Solomon Islands began\n\nwithin three months of Solomon independence. See Agreement Establishing Certain\n\nSea and Sea-bed Boundaries, Sept. 13, 1988, Austl.-Solom. Is., 12 LOS Bull. 19\n\n(1988). The delimitation agreement between Bahrain and Iran was concluded shortly\n\nafter Iran abandoned its claim to Bahrain. See Agreement Concerning Delimitation\n\nof the Continental Shelf, June 17, 1971, Iran-Bahr., 826 U.N.T.S. 227. The boundary\n\nstudies dealing with the Baltic Sea and the former German Democratic Republic\n\nsuggest that the GDR may have seen maritime boundary agreements as reinforcing\n\nits position as a sovereign independent state. Especially in light of the long period\n\nof non-recognition of the GDR by the Federal Republic of Germany and other\n\nAnnex 186\n\n252 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nattempts to negotiate maritime boundaries in the Western suggest a close link between these efforts and\n\nColombia's dispute with Nicaragua over sovereignty with respect\n\nto the islands in question. One assumes Indonesia was not unaware\n\nof the political implications of a delimitation agreement\n\nwith Australia dealing with the so-called Timor Gap in light of\n\nthe controversy surrounding Indonesia's annexation of the former\n\nPortuguese colony.17\n\nIt is possible that extra-regional metropolitan powers are\n\nparticularly interested in reinforcing the recognition of their\n\nterritorial role in a region even in the absence of a specific territorial\n\ndispute,18 bearing in mind that a potential boundary dispute\n\nin the future might be more difficult to resolve if the issue\n\nof the right to represent the territory in question was raised in\n\nthat context. Conversely, a state may wish to provide a dependency\n\nwith established maritime boundaries as a prelude to\n\nindependence in order to protect the interests of the inhabitants\n\nand minimize foreign policy problems for the newly independent\n\nstate.19\n\nWestern states prior to the pursuit of the so-called Ostpolitik of the Federal Republic\n\nin the early 1970s. The delimitation agreement between the GDR and the FRG is\n\nconsidered a direct result of detente between the parties. See Protocol Note between\n\nthe Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic Concerning\n\nthe Boundary in Lubeck Bay, Oct. 1, 1974, F.R.G.-G.D.R., G Bl. II, 438 (1974)\n\n(G.D.R.) [hereinafter F.R.G.-G.D.R. Protocol Note].\n\n17. These considerations apparently were not sufficient to persuade Indonesia to\n\nyield to Australia, in respect of Timor, as much as it had yielded geographically\n\nyears earlier in respect of other areas. However, it may explain Indonesian willingness\n\nto accept a joint management arrangement as the basis of the settlement on\n\nthe Australian side of the Timor Trough. Sec Treaty on Zone of Cooperation in an\n\nArea between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia, Dec.\n\n11, 1989, Indon.-Austl., 29 I.L.M. 475. On the other hand, Indonesia yielded even\n\nless in geographic terms in the provisional fisheries delimitation agreement in which\n\nTimor was not as prominent an issue. See Memorandum of Understanding Concerning\n\nthe Implementation of a Provisional Fisheries Surveillance and Enforcement Arrangement,\n\nOct. 29, 1981, Austl.-Indon. (on file with Dep't of Foreign Affairs and\n\nTrade, Canberra, Australia) [hereinafter Provisional Fisheries Surveillance].\n\n18. It is curious that the text of the boundary agreement between France and\n\nSaint Lucia does not refer to Martinique, the French island concerned. See Delimitation\n\nConvention, Mar. 4, 1981, Fr.-St. Lucia, I Can. Annex. 675 (1983).\n\n19. For example, the United Kingdom sought to establish offshore boundaries\n\namong the Trucial States while it was still responsible for their foreign affairs.\n\nSharjah and Umm al Qaywayn accepted. See Seabed Boundary Agreement, 1964,\n\nSharjah-Umm al Qaywayn, I Can. Annex 99 (1983); see also Orders in Council, Sept.\n\n11, 1958, Sarawak-North Boreo-Brunei, U.K Stat. Inst. (Nos. 1517-18), describing a\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 253\n\nIn a similar vein, one possible way to obtain or enhance\n\nrecognition of baselines is to enter into a delimitation agreement\n\nbased on equidistance in which the boundary is clearly measured\n\nfrom those baselines.20 This factor might influence\n\narchipelagic states such as Indonesia.21 Although the difference\n\nis not always easy to establish, this situation should be distinguished\n\nfrom one in which the primary purpose of the baselines\n\nis to influence the maritime boundary negotiations.\n\nA related factor is the desire to \"consolidate\" coastal state\n\njurisdiction newly acquired under international law.22 This ap-\n\n1958 United Kingdom line drawn with respect to North Borneo and Sarawak and\n\nBrunei. Australia, on behalf of Papua New Guinea, settled the land boundary and\n\ncompleted a missing segment of the maritime boundary with Indonesia in contemplation\n\nof New Guinea's scheduled independence in 1975. See Agreements between Australia\n\nand Indonesia Concerning Certain Boundaries between Papua New Guinea and\n\nIndonesia, Feb. 12, 1973, Papua N.G.-Indon., 975 U.N.T.S. 4 [hereinafter Australia-\n\nIndonesia Certain Boundaries Agreements].\n\n20. As a strictly legal matter, absent more specific references in the agreement,\n\nan equidistant line measured from a baseline does not necessarily imply recognition\n\nof the baseline as such, but merely acknowledgement that the claimed baseline represents\n\nan appropriate point of departure for applying equidistance principles (for example,\n\na construction line representing the general direction of the coast). Of course,\n\nregardless of the effect of the claim on the boundary, a state may obtain recognition\n\nof its claim in connection with the boundary agreement. Panama obtained recognition\n\nof its claim that the Gulf of Panama is historic waters in its boundary\n\nagreements with Colombia and Costa Rica; only in the former case did the baseline\n\naffect the delimitation. See Treaty on the Delimitation of Marine and Submarine\n\nAreas and Associated Matters, Nov. 20, 1976, Pan.-Colom., I Can. Annex. 417 (1983)\n\n[hereinafter Panama-Colombia Treaty]; see also Agreement Relating to the Delimitation\n\nof their Marine and Submarine Areas in the Pacific Ocean and to their Maritime\n\nCooperation, Apr. 6, 1984, Colom.-Costa Rica, Diario Oficial de Colom. (June\n\n18, 1985). There is speculation that North Korea may have obtained Soviet recognition\n\nof its unusually long 300-mile baseline in exchange for a maritime boundary\n\nfavorable to the Soviet Union. See Agreement on the Delimitation of the Soviet-Korean\n\nNational Border, Apr. 17, 1985, U.S.S.R.-Korea [hereinafter Soviet-Korea National\n\nBorder Agreement], reprinted in INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 1135 (Jonathan\n\nI. Charney & Lewis M. Alexander eds., 1993).\n\n21. It is interesting that the maritime boundary between Indonesia and Singapore,\n\nwhich generally follows the deep draught tanker route, moves within the\n\nIndonesia archipelagic baselines at one point. See Agreement Stipulating the Territorial\n\nSea Boundary Lines in the Strait of Singapore, May 25, 1973, Indon.-Sing.,\n\nLimits in the Seas, No. 60 (1974) [hereinafter Indonesia-Singapore Sea Boundary\n\nAgreement].\n\n22. In some sense, it would appear to reflect a feeling that the existence of the\n\nclose is tentative or inchoate until it is actually enclosed and precisely separated\n\nfrom the neighboring close. One way to identify a thing is to describe its perimeter\n\n(a circle for example). Perhaps looming in the background is Grotius' (in this context\n\ndisconcerting) observation that because the vagrant waters of the sea cannot be\n\nenclosed they are necessarily free. The U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea did\n\nAnnex 186\n\n254 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\npears to be particularly true in enclosed and semi-enclosed where the peaceful enjoyment of extended maritime jurisdiction\n\nis especially dependent upon arrangements with one's 23 The series of British and other delimitation agreements\n\nin the North Sea followed immediately upon the entry into force\n\nof the Continental Shelf Convention on 10 June 1964, designed\n\nin part to consolidate the conventional regime in the North\n\nSea.24 A similar process occurred in the Caribbean Sea respect to the exclusive economic zone. A desire to consolidate\n\n200-nautical-mile limits is identified as one reason for the delimitation\n\nagreement between Denmark and Norway.25\n\nThe decision to conclude a maritime boundary agreement\n\nmay be influenced by political factors extraneous to the boundary\n\nitself. The objective need for agreement, particularly where\n\nrelations are already strained, may become a convenient basis\n\nfor governments to take tentative steps toward improving their\n\nrelations. One notes, for example, that the United States negotiated\n\na maritime boundary agreement with Cuba at a time when\n\nbroader attempts were being made to improve bilateral relations.\n\n26\n\nnot pursue a United States proposal to establish coastal state jurisdiction over fishing\n\nfor stocks that reside in coastal areas beyond the territorial sea without fixing\n\ndistance limits.\n\n23. It is interesting to note that many states, while implementing the continental\n\nshelf doctrine and delimiting their respective continental shelves in the area,\n\nhave thus far refrained from implementing exclusive economic zones or 200-mile\n\nfisheries zones in the Mediterranean Sea, even when the same states have asserted\n\nsuch jurisdiction outside the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n24. This point is made in a number of North Sea boundary studies, especially\n\nNetherlands-United Kingdom (1965). See Agreement Relating to the Delimitation of\n\nthe Continental Shelf under the North Sea, Together with Amending Protocol, Oct.\n\n6, 1965, Neth.-U.K, 595 U.N.T.S. 105. For the states concerned, the consolidation of\n\nthe regime of the Continental Shelf Convention in the North Sea included not only\n\nthe principles and rules of coastal state jurisdiction, but the delimitation rules set\n\nforth in Article 6.

Political Factors\n\nA. Introduction\n\nFour important political decisions can be identified in connection\n\nwith maritime boundaries: the decision to negotiate, the\n\ndecision to propose a particular boundary,27 the decision to\n\nmake concessions with a view to reaching agreement,28 and the\n\ndecision to agree on a particular boundary. Even the decision to\n\nrespect a tribunal's legally binding determination of a boundary\n\nis political.\n\nThe study of factors potentially influencing the location of\n\nmaritime boundaries is a study of the influence of these different\n\nfactors on the ultimate political decisions of governments.\n\nUnless it influences the decisions of those with political authority,\n\nany given factor is irrelevant to a particular boundary. The\n\n\"objective\" importance of any given factor - assuming such a\n\nthing could be measured - does not necessarily explain its political\n\nimpact.29\n\nWhen a tribunal is asked to decide a dispute regarding a\n\nmaritime boundary under international law, the tribunal will\n\nlimit itself to examining factors it regards as legally relevant to\n\n27. Some states have announced a public position related to the location of the\n\nboundary prior to negotiation, whether for tactical or political reasons or because of\n\nthe need to define some (temporary) geographic limit on domestic regulatory or enforcement\n\nactions.\n\n28. The temporal relationship among the first three decisions involves complex\n\nquestions of subjective intent, information regarding the other side's attitudes, management\n\nof domestic political pressures, and negotiating strategy and style. Some\n\nseasoned negotiators would argue that, once sufficient information is available regarding\n\nthe other party's interests, the best approach to reaching agreement is to\n\ncollapse the second and third decisions into one \"reasonable\" position around which\n\none is prepared to negotiate at the margins but from which one is not prepared to\n\nretreat in principle. They would presumably regard as unfortunate the possible implication\n\nin the North Sea Continental Shelf cases that this approach might not\n\nsatisfy the duty to negotiate in good faith. The International Court of Justice noted\n\nthat the parties \"are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations\n\nare meaningful, which will not be the case when either of them insists upon\n\nits own position without contemplating any modification of it.\" North Sea Continental\n\nShelf Cases, supra note 11, 11 85.\n\n29. For example, the ocean policies of a major industrialized maritime state\n\nwith global economic and strategic interests like the United States can be substantially\n\ninfluenced by local coastal fishing industries that represent a very small proportion\n\nof its economy.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n256 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nthe resolution of the issues in dispute. Much has been written\n\nabout the rich and growing jurisprudence of the International\n\nCourt of Justice and other tribunals in this connection. However\n\nflexible the articulated legal standard of \"equitable principles,\"\n\n\"relevant circumstances,\" and \"equitable results\" may be, there\n\ncan be no doubt that while the parties are free to take into account\n\nvirtually anything they wish in fashioning their negotiating\n\npositions, a tribunal asked to apply international law is\n\nmore limited.\n\nThe law of maritime delimitation may require the parties to\n\nnegotiate in good faith. But it places few if any limitations on\n\nthe location of an agreed boundary or related arrangements.\n\nProvided they agree, the parties are largely free to divide as\n\nthey wish control over areas and activities subject to their jurisdiction\n\nunder international law. They may be guided principally,\n\nin some measure, or not at all by legal principles and legally\n\nrelevant factors a court might examine, and by a host of other\n\nfactors a tribunal might well ignore such as relative power and\n\nwealth, the state of their relations, security and foreign policy\n\nobjectives, convenience, and concessions unrelated to the boundary\n\nor even to maritime jurisdiction as such.30\n\nFrom this perspective, it is difficult and arguably misleading\n\nto isolate political from other factors when analyzing agreed\n\nboundaries. Yet it would make little sense even to attempt to\n\nreplicate here what is so ably presented by other authors elsewhere\n\nin this field of study.\n\nThis being said, it should be noted that maritime boundary\n\nissues do not normally seem to engage the same level of political\n\nattention as many disputes over land territory. The resultant\n\nagreements are often viewed as economic or technical. Indeed, it\n\ncan be argued that few maritime boundary agreements are regarded\n\nas overwhelmingly political, with the notable exception of\n\nthe agreement between Argentina and Chile.31\n\n30. It is said that Italy settled for less than full effect for its islands in exchange\n\nfor a wider package on various political and economic questions, including\n\nItalian fishing in exchange for one billion lire per year. See Agreement Relating to\n\nthe Delimitation of the Continental Shelf, Aug. 20, 1971, Italy-Tunis., I Can. Annex\n\n(1983).\n\n31. The agreement followed the Beagle Channel Arbitration, Argentina's refection\n\nof the result, fears of armed conflict, and mediation by the Vatican. Its title is\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 257\n\nIn addition to the difficulty of isolating political considerations\n\nfrom other considerations affecting maritime boundaries,\n\none must add the difficulty of accumulating relevant data on\n\npolitical factors. Virtually every boundary agreement is described,\n\noften in its preamble, as designed to foster good relations\n\nbetween the parties.32 Yet governments may be reluctant\n\nto state publicly that for reasons of good relations they accepted\n\na less favorable boundary than they might otherwise have obtained.\n\n33 Governments could almost never be expected to assert\n\nthat they received more because they had greater overall leverage\n\nin the bilateral relationship.34\n\nTreaty of Peace, Friendship and Maritime Delimitation. The treaty was submitted to\n\na plebiscite in Argentina.

It might be noted that maritime boundary lines are frequently simplified by\n\nreducing the number of turning points, using a long line perpendicular to the general\n\ndirection of the coast, or in other ways. The primary reason is to simplify compliance\n\nand enforcement. In order to avoid problems with inadvertent violations by\n\nfishermen, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru agreed to permit the neighboring state's national\n\nto fish in a ten-mile zone on either side of the maritime boundary beyond twelve\n\nmiles from the coast.

There are exceptions. The rapporteur of the France-Monaco treaty is quoted\n\nas stating to the French Senate, \"Because of the close and exceptional nature of\n\nFrench-Mone'gasque relations, France has accepted provisions that the rules of international\n\nlaw did not oblige it to accept.\" The reference was to the Mon^gasque relations,\n\nFrance has accepted provisions that the rules of international law did not\n\noblige it to accept. The reference was to the Monegasque corridor leading out into\n\nthe Mediterranean in a shore. See Maritime Delimitation Agreement between Monaco\n\nand France, Feb. 16, 1984, Fr.-Monaco, No. 8-3, J.O. 6 July 1985, p. 11,600 (French)\n\n[hereinafter Monaco-France Delimitation Agreement].

Senegal was no less generous to The Gambia. See\n\nAgreement between The Gambia and the Republic of Senegal, June 4, 1975, Gam.-\n\nSenegal, Limits in the Seas, No. 85 (1979) [hereinafter Gambia-Senegal Agreement].\n\nNorway may have accepted a result that gave Iceland all of its 200-mile zone in\n\npart because Iceland is highly dependent on fishing. See Agreements between Iceland\n\nand Norway Establishing Maritime Boundaries between Iceland and Jan Mayen (1)\n\nAgreement Concerning Fishery and Continental Shelf Questions, May 28, 1980, Ice.-\n\nNor., Official Gazette C9/1980 [hereinafter Iceland-Norway Agreement].\n\n34. Two authors suggest that the relative strength of the parties was a factor\n\nAnnex 186\n\n258 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nB. Related Accommodations\n\nA further analytical difficulty relates to the question of\n\nwhen a factor is deemed to have influenced the location of the\n\nboundary. The easy case is one in which the actual location of\n\nthe boundary represents the accommodation of the interest concerned,\n\nfor example where a boundary follows a navigation channel.\n\nA more difficult problem arises when the interest of a state\n\nis accommodated not by adjusting the position of the boundary,\n\nbut by concurrent agreement that imposes an obligation on the\n\nother state with respect to areas on the latter's side of the\n\nboundary.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that in such cases the interest\n\ndid indeed influence the location of the boundary in the\n\nsense that agreement might not have been reached on such a\n\nboundary absent the related accommodation. For example, a\n\nstate concerned about navigation rights in a channel that is\n\ncloser to its neighbor's coast than its own might prefer to use the\n\nchannel as the boundary, but might in some circumstances settle\n\nfor an equidistant line boundary in exchange for treaty guarantees\n\nof free navigation. That same state presumably would resist\n\nan equidistant line boundary absent related navigation guarantees.\n\nThe relationship between boundaries and related accommodations\n\nis sometimes overlooked in analyses of maritime boundary\n\nlaw because it does not form part of the formal jurisprudence.\n\nThe reason for this is that the International Court of\n\nJustice and arbitral tribunals have not been asked by the parties\n\nto fashion a broader boundary region regime that accommoin\n\ndetermining the location of the line. Its perception of Indian power may have\n\ninfluenced the Maldives government not to argue that Minicoy Island should be given\n\nreduced effect. See Agreement between India and Maldives on Maritime Boundary\n\nin the Arabian Sea and Related Matters, Dec. 28, 1976, India-Maldives, Limits in\n\nthe Seas, No. 78 (1978) [hereinafter India-Maldives Maritime Agreement]. The delimitation\n\nline in the Bay of Biscay, more favorable to France than an equidistant\n\nline, was concluded at a time when Spain, under Franco, may have been in a somewhat\n\nweaker position diplomatically. See Conventions between France and Spain (1)\n\nConcerning the Delimitation of the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone and (2) Concerning\n\nthe Delimitation of the Continental Shelf of the Bay of Biscay, Jan. 25,\n\n1974, Fr.-Spain, (U.N.

Determining the location of a maritime\n\nboundary has generally been the sole means at the disposal of\n\njudges and arbitrators for accommodating relevant interest.35\n\nC. Effect of Political Factors\n\nIt is often difficult to discern what, if any, effect political\n\nconsiderations had on the location of an agreed maritime boundary.\n\n36 A state's desire to maximize the areas subject to its jurisdiction\n\nand its interest in achieving agreement on a maritime\n\nboundary may well conflict. It stands to reason that if dispute\n\navoidance is a primary purpose for seeking agreement, then a\n\ngovernment is unlikely to maintain a position on the location of\n\nthe boundary that itself stimulates a dispute. This proposition\n\nis, however, difficult to document from public sources.\n\nAuthors with knowledge of the factors influencing the U.S.\n\ndecision to give full effect to Aves Island in the delimitation\n\nagreement with Venezuela point out that \"as a political matter,\n\nthere was little to gain and potentially much to lose in asserting\n\na broader U.S. boundary interest, particularly in light of the\n\nmarginal resource interest in the area.\"37 One is struck by the\n\ncomment that \"France was so accommodating as to allow Australia\n\nto use Middleton Reef, a low-tide elevation 125 nautical\n\nmiles offshore, as a basepoint\" for determining the location of\n\nthe equidistant line.38 One of the reasons cited for Norwegian\n\n35. The Iceland-Norway Conciliation Commission recommended a joint development\n\nzone with respect to the continental shelf. It should be noted that the Commission\n\nincluded prominent Icelandic and Norwegian diplomats and made a unanimous\n\nrecommendation as requested. See Iceland-Norway Agreement, supra note 33,\n\nat C9; Evensen, La Delimitation du Plateau Continental entre la Norvege et\n\nTlslande dans le Secteur de Jan Mayen, 27 Ann. Fr. Dr. Int. 711 (1981).\n\n36. Political factors may sometimes influence even technical questions, such as\n\nthe issue of which chart to use to depict the agreed boundary. National prestige\n\nmay account for the fact that both Italian and Yugoslav charts were used by the\n\nparties, giving rise to differences in numerical identification and location of points.\n\nSee Agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia Concerning the Delimitation of the\n\nContinental Shelf between the Two Countries, Jan. 8, 1968, Italy-Yugo., Gazz. Uff.,\n\nSupp. to No. 302 of 29 Nov. 1968 (Italy).\n\n37. Feldman & Colson, The Maritime Boundaries of the United States, 75 AM.\n\nJ. INT'L L. 729, 747 (1981). One notes that the U.S. did more than just avoid a\n\nfight; it negotiated a treaty giving Venezuela what it wanted, to the chagrin of some\n\nsome of Venezuela's other neighbors. Two additional factors are potentially relevant.\n\nFirst, the U.S. had a general practice of giving full effect to islands in agreements\n\napplying equidistance. Second, Venezuela concluded its agreements with the U.S. and\n\nThe Netherlands at the same time.\n\n38.

The proposal therefore is to be one that the negotiating partner would regard as acceptable,\n\nat least in principle.\n\nIn theory, all one need do is split the pie (that is the areas\n\nof overlapping jurisdiction) in half. In practice, geographic of the respective coasts and their geographic relationship\n\nto each other make delimitation a more difficult task where states are not focusing on particular resources or areas.\n\nThe case of delimitation between relatively small islands\n\nusually presents the most notable exception. There an equidistant\n\nline will often halve the pie quite nicely. Thus it is surprising that equidistant lines between islands have been extensively in deeper parts of the Caribbean Sea and Pacific\n\nOcean.\n\nA rarer exception arises where relatively regular coasts of\n\nadjacent states face in the same general direction. In that case,\n\neither an equidistant line or a line perpendicular to the general\n\ndirection of the coast (in effect an equidistant line modified to\n\nignore coastal irregularities) will also often halve the pie quite\n\nnicely.

See, e.g., the discussion of political strategic, and historical considerations in\n\nthe Agreement between Australia and Indonesia Establishing Certain Seabed\n\nBoundaries, May 18, 1971, Austl.-Indon., 974 U.N.T.S. 307 (1975) [hereinafter Australia-\n\nIndonesia Seabed Agreement].\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 261\n\ncerned to maintain solidarity in support of their new and controversial\n\nclaims of 200-mile zones, it is not surprising that this\n\ngeneral type of approach was used by Chile, Ecuador and Peru\n\nin the 1952 Santiago Declaration, albeit in the somewhat unusual\n\nform of parallels of latitude that are not precisely perpendicular\n\nto the general directions of the coasts at the land frontiers.41\n\nWhat this indicates is that equidistance or some simple\n\nequivalent is likely to be used where the desire to agree on both\n\nsides is stronger than the interest in maximizing claims, where\n\nspecific resources or areas are not a major issue, and where the\n\ncoastal characteristics are such that the resultant division of\n\noverlapping claims seems fair. In other situations, it cannot be\n\nasserted either that the use of equidistance necessarily reveals\n\nthe existence of a dominant political interest in reaching agreement\n\non the part of one or both parties or that the failure to use\n\nequidistance necessarily represents the absence of a dominant\n\npolitical interest in reaching agreement on the part of at least\n\none of the parties. The reason is that in those situations, the\n\nquestion of fairness is more complex; equidistance may well\n\nrepresent a victory for one party and a defeat for the other.\n\nD. Legal Factors\n\nWhatever its relative interest in achieving rapid agreement,\n\na government must take into account the effect of any proposals\n\nit makes on its relations with its neighbors. Powerful states may\n\nbe loath to appear like bullies. Strong and weak alike have an\n\ninterest in credibility. Unless a state is prepared to expend unrelated\n\nresources (whether as carrots or sticks) to obtain a favorable\n\nmaritime boundary, its proposal must be grounded in more\n\nthan unrestrained self-interest. The search for a platform of\n\nprinciple will entail, at least in part, a search for a proposal that\n\nhas a plausible legal and equitable foundation.\n\nIn this context, as in many others, governments can be\n\nexpected to consult legal sources that are likely to be regarded\n\nas authoritative or at least persuasive by both parties. Thus, to\n\nsome degree, maritime boundary agreements may be analyzed in\n\n41. One is tempted to wonder whether the use of parallels of latitude may\n\nhave been related to the fact that the jurisdiction asserted in the declaration extended\n\n\"not less than\" 200 miles from the coast. See Chile-Peru Agreement, supra note\n\n32; Peru-Ecuador Agreement, supra note 32.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n262 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nterms of the chronology of major developments in the law maritime delimitation as articulated by multilateral conferences\n\nand international tribunals.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Continental Shelf Convention,\n\n42 the United Kingdom and other North Sea states set\n\nabout implementing the Convention, including the delimitation\n\nrule in Article 6. A few years later, however, in direct response\n\nto this effort, the International Court of Justice in the North Sea\n\nContinental Shelf cases refused to apply Article 6 to a nonparty,\n\nand enunciated a broader set of equitable principles, with substantial\n\nemphasis on the nature of the continental shelf as a\n\nnatural prolongation of the land territory of the coastal state.43\n\nThe impact of the Court's dictum was unmistakable.44 The\n\nUnited States for the first time made clear its view that the\n\nmaritime boun dary in the Gulf of Maine should place all of\n\nGeorges Bank on the U.S. side.45 Australia was driven by the\n\n\"natural prolongation\" language in the opinion to seek, and in\n\nlarge measure obtain, a continental shelf boundary extending to\n\nthe deep trench off the Indonesian coast.46 The summary report\n\non North Europe notes that the 1969 opinion marks the turning\n\n42. Convention on the Continental Shelf, supra note 24.\n\n43. North Sea Continental Shelf cases, supra note 11.\n\n44. Perhaps its most wide-ranging effect is the new alternative definition of the\n\ncontinental shelf in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea as the natural prolongation\n\nof the land territory for a state extending to the outer edge of the continental\n\nmargin. U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, supra note 2, at 10.\n\n45. The position taken by the U.S. in 1970 diplomatic discussions was that \"a\n\nboundary in accordance with equitable principles should follow the line of deepest\n\nwater through the Northeast Channel, which would bring all of Georges Bank under\n\nU.S. jurisdiction.\" Feldman & Colson, supra note 37, at 755. For its part, Canada,\n\nwhich had consistently emphasized equidistance in the Gulf of Maine, later extended\n\nits claim to give reduced effect to Cape Cod and associated islands, relying on the\n\nopinion in the Anglo-French arbitration. It is possible this move was a largely tactical\n\none related to the forthcoming litigation regarding the Gulf of Maine; it is also\n\npossible this move was not unrelated to the dispute regarding delimitation with\n\nrespect to the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon off the Canadian coast.\n\n46. The analysis of the 1972 Australia-Indonesia seabed boundary agreement\n\npoints out that not much was known about the resource potential of the seabed\n\nareas in question at the time. See Agreement between Australia and Indonesia Establishing\n\nCertain Seabed Boundaries in the Area of the Timor and Arafura Seas,\n\nOct. 9, 1972, Austl.-Indon., 974 U.N.T.S. 319 (1957) [hereinafter Australia-Indonesia\n\nTimor and Arafura Seabed Agreement].

As\n\ntribunals made clear in subsequent opinions, any legal presumption\n\nin favor of equidistance, if it ever existed, was gone.\n\nThe International Court of Justice subsequently retreated\n\nfrom natural prolongation in the Tunisia-Libya41 case and especially\n\nin the Libya-Malta case.48 The provisional continental\n\nshelf agreement between Australia and Indonesia establishing a\n\nzone of cooperation in the so-called Timor Gap49 as well as their\n\nprovisional fisheries surveillance and enforcement arrangement50\n\nreveal a substantial retreat from the influence of geomorphology\n\nin the earlier continental shelf agreement.\n\nThe impact of the opinion in the Guinea-Guinea-Bissau\n\narbitration is not limited to Africa. A specific reaction to that\n\ndecision is noted in the study of the Colombia-Honduras delimitation.\n\n51\n\nThe foregoing are mere illustrations of the fact that while\n\nstates are free to ignore their legal rights inter se in reaching\n\nagreement with each other, legal sources may well influence\n\ntheir claims and expectations, sometimes decisively.52\n\n47.

Effect on Third States\n\nA state faced with the negotiation of several maritime\n\nboundaries will need to consider the effect of its approach to one\n\nboundary on the others. Thus, for example, the United States\n\nhas demonstrated a consistent practice of giving full effect to\n\nislands in agreements in which equidistance is used.\n\nAt the simplest level - influenced in part by debates of the\n\nissue during the Third U.N.

Legal and advocacy considerations apart, it is not surprising\n\nthat while Canada, in the Gulf of Maine dispute, was adhering\n\nfairly closely to an equidistance approach, it articulated the\n\nunderlying rules in terms of equitable principles and relevant\n\ncircumstances.

It represented not only an attempt to reinforce the use\n\nof equidistance in the North Sea but, by extending the line to a\n\npoint equidistant from their coasts and the German coast, an\n\neffort to apply equidistance directly to their respective boundaries\n\nwith Germany. Similarly, the Denmark-U.K. and Netherlands-\n\nU.K. equidistant lines in practice met at a tri-junction\n\npoint, a result inconsistent (except perhaps in mathematical\n\ntheory) with Germany's view that its continental shelf extended\n\nto the middle of the North Sea.\n\nThe fact that this effort failed has not necessarily deterred\n\nothers. In reaching their continental shelf delimitation agreement\n\nwith each other, Ireland and the United Kingdom \"had\n\ncommon cause in opposing claims to part of the area by third\n\nStates,\" presumably Denmark and Iceland.55 The equidistant\n\nline between Sicily and Tunisia was drawn as if Malta did not\n\nexist.56\n\nAgreements delimiting areas claimed by third states are\n\nnot, however, common. There is ample evidence of restraint.\n\nNumerous bilaterally drawn boundaries are terminated short of\n\nthe tri-junction point with a third state even in the absence of\n\nany known dispute.57\n\nIn both the Tunisia I Libya58 and Libya I MaZfo59cases, the\n\nCourt took care to protect the interests of a concerned third\n\nstate that, in each case, was unsuccessful in its efforts to inter-\n\n55.

This may have been intended to\n\ncounter an Argentine desire to duplicate the practice on the\n\nwest coast of South America and use a parallel of latitude in\n\nits delimitation with Uruguay.66\n\nThe tribunal in the Guinea-Guinea-Bissau arbitration67\n\ndevoted a great deal of attention to the problem of cut-off or\n\nenclavement, which occurs when a state's boundaries with\n\nneighboring (usually adjacent) states join at a point off its coast.\n\nThis problem can be avoided if the boundaries on either side are\n\ncoordinated so as to avoid a cut-off effect. The difficulty is that\n\nonly the boundary between the parties to the arbitration is at\n\nissue. By emphasizing the need to avoid enclavement, determining\n\nthe broad general direction of the coast with reference to the\n\ncoasts of the immediate neighbors of both parties, and establishing\n\nthe longest seaward segment of the boundary as a perpendicular\n\nto that general direction, the tribunal in effect was taking\n\nan approach of broader utility in West Africa, and appears to\n\nhave been aware of this.\n\nF. Sovereignty Disputes\n\nIn principle, all areas of land, including small islands and\n\nrocks above water at high tide, are entitled to some maritime\n\njurisdiction.68 If strict equidistance is the method of delimitation,\n\nthey will have the same effect as promontories on much\n\nlarger islands or longer continental coasts.

For example, the boundary\n\ndrawn by Australia and France is terminated to the east point that avoids involving Australia in the territorial dispute\n\nbetween France and Vanuatu over certain islands controlled France and also claimed by Vanuatu.69 The same problem apparently delayed Fiji's ratification of its delimitation agreement\n\nwith France.70 The terminus of the Atlantic maritime\n\nboundary between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela was\n\nshifted slightly to the north of a hypothetical tri-junction point\n\nwith Guyana in order to avoid involving Trinidad and Tobago in\n\nany dispute between Guyana and Venezuela.71\n\nIf the sovereignty dispute is between the two states establishing\n\nthe maritime boundary, they may use the same technique\n\nemployed in the Australia-France agreement, namely\n\nterminating the boundary at a point where they agree that the\n\ndisputed territory would not influence the location of the boundary.\n\nFor example, this approach has been used with respect to\n\ndisputed islands by Japan and South Korea72 as well as France\n\nand Mauritius.73 It was also used by Canada and the United\n\nStates in the Gulf of Maine, where the landward terminus of the\n\nboundary the Chamber was asked to draw was located at sea in\n\na manner designed to avoid the issue of sovereignty over\n\nMachias Seal Island and North Rock.74 Italy and Yugoslavia's\n\n69.

Strategic Factors\n\nA. Introduction\n\nWhile it is reasonably clear that at least some maritime\n\nboundaries were influenced by security interests, those interests\n\nare almost never adverted to in the text of the agreement and\n\nonly rarely, and then often obliquely, in related commentary of\n\ngovernments. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that\n\ndefense ministries are often consulted as governments develop\n\ntheir maritime boundary positions.83 At times those ministries\n\nare represented on negotiating delegations. It seems reasonable\n\nto conclude that, whatever the apparent factors influencing its\n\nlocation, the acceptability of the boundary may well be reviewed\n\nfrom a security perspective.\n\nbetween Australia and Papua New Guinea under article 2 of the agreement is in\n\npart based on the seabed delimitation line. See Australia-Indonesia Certain\n\nBoundaries Agreements, supra note 19. The same approach was used by Abu Dhabi\n\nand Qatar.

In some cases, the navy is the primary internal source of charts, technical\n\ndata, or maritime expertise.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 271\n\nA number of economic and other factors dealt with in other\n\nchapters of this study may engage the perceived security interests\n\nof a particular state. In a narrow sense, the term \"security\"\n\nmight refer to the right to conduct and, conversely, the right to\n\nrestrict military activities at sea, principally by warships, coast\n\nguard vessels, and state aircraft. Yet even in that narrow sense,\n\nit is difficult to distinguish commercial navigation interests from\n\nsecurity interests. Moreover, governments have asserted that\n\nthe movement of international trade, and access to and control\n\nover mineral and hydrocarbon resources of the seabed, engage\n\nnot only their economic but their security interests.84 In the\n\nbroadest sense, a state's efforts to accumulate friends and control\n\nthe emergence or leverage of adversaries are fundamentally\n\ntied to its security.\n\nB. Types of Security Concerns\n\nTwo different aspects of security are potentially affected by\n\nmaritime delimitation. One is the desire of a state to exclude or\n\ncontrol activities of foreign states off its coast that it perceives to\n\nbe prejudicial to its security.85 The other is the desire of a state\n\nto be able to ensure that its own or foreign activities that are\n\nimportant to its security may be conducted without foreign interference,\n\nincluding protection of its access to the open sea and\n\ncommunications by sea and air with foreign states.\n\nUnder the regimes set forth in the United Nations Convention\n\non the Law of the Sea,86 these interests are unquestionably\n\naffected in waters subject to the sovereignty of the coastal state,\n\nnamely internal waters, archipelagic waters, and the territorial\n\nsea. That sovereignty is qualified by the right of innocent passage,\n\nwhich is subject to certain coastal state regulatory powers\n\nas well as the power to take measures to prevent passage that is\n\nnot innocent and the power to suspend innocent passage outside\n\nstraits. That sovereignty is also qualified by the right of ships\n\n84. Soviet experts have spoken of environmental security, using the same Russian\n\nword that is used in \"Security Council\" and \"Committee on State Security\"\n\n(KGB). The cognates for \"security\" in many Romance languages may share the arguably\n\nbroader meaning of \"safety.\"\n\n85. The political reality of this perception of security is to be distinguished\n\nfrom its substantive merits. Some might argue that, in certain situations, demagogy,\n\nparanoia, or xenophobia are better explanations for the perception.\n\n86. U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, supra note 2.\n\nAnnex 186\n\n272 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 26:2\n\nand aircraft to transit passage of straits and archipelagic lanes passage.\n\nAs the tribunal in the Guinea-Guinea-Bissau arbitration\n\nobserved,87 the continental shelf and the exclusive economic\n\nzone are not zones of sovereignty, but rather areas in which the\n\ncoastal state exercises more limited sovereign rights and jurisdiction\n\nfor specific purposes. These are identified in detail in the\n\nUnited Nations Convention. In particular, freedom of navigation\n\nand overflight are expressly protected in the provisions dealing\n\nwith the exclusive economic zone as well as the continental\n\nshelf. There are nevertheless aspects of these regimes that\n\nstates may perceive as affecting their security interests:\n\n* The United Nations Convention provides that artificial installations\n\nused for resource or other economic purposes are\n\nsubject to coastal state control in the exclusive economic\n\nzone and on the continental shelf. The same is true of. scientific\n\ninstallations as well as any other installations that may\n\ninterfere with the exercise of the rights of the coastal\n\nstate.88\n\n* The coastal state largely has a free hand in determining\n\nwhere it will permit installations (and the safety zones\n\naround them) to be placed in its exclusive economic zone\n\nand on its continental shelf, subject to a somewhat narrowly\n\nphrased duty to avoid recognized sea lanes essential to international\n\nnavigation,89 supplemented in the U.N. Convention,\n\nby a general duty to avoid interference with navigation.\n\n90 A neighboring state could be concerned about its\n\n87. Guinea-Guinea-Bissau Award, supra note 33, at 124.\n\n88. U.N.

Convention includes among the express freedoms of\n\nthe high seas the freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines, this freedom is\n\n\"subject to Part VI\" dealing with the continental shelf. Pursuant to Part VI, Article\n\n79, the coastal state duty not to impede the laying or maintenance of cables and\n\npipelines is subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of\n\nthe continental shelf, the exploration of its natural resources and the prevention,\n\nreduction, and control of pollution from pipelines. Moreover, the delineation of the\n\ncourse for the laying of pipelines on the continental shelf is subject to the consent of\n\nAnnex 186\n\n1994-95] INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 273\n\naccess routes.\n\n* The U.N. Convention accords the coastal state enforcement\n\nrights over foreign ships in its exclusive economic zone with\n\nrespect to pollution in contravention of international standards\n\nor internationally approved coastal state standards\n\n(and, in limited circumstances such as dumping or ice-covered\n\nareas, unilateral coastal state standards). The complex\n\nand carefully balanced provisions of the Convention on this\n\nmatter are sometimes omitted from national laws on the\n\nexclusive economic zone that nevertheless contain a generalized\n\nassertion of jurisdiction with respect to control of pollution.\n\n* The trend in the twentieth century has been one of expanding\n\ncoastal state jurisdiction in both a geographic and a\n\nfunctional sense. This trend may continue, either in terms\n\nof a gradual coastal shift in the balance between coastal and\n\nother interests in the exclusive economic zone or in some\n\nother way. Governments concerned with protecting their\n\naccess to the sea may consider it prudent to deal with that\n\ncontingency. In this connection it remains unclear whether\n\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea will\n\neventually receive widespread adherence and, in any event,\n\nprecisely how it will be interpreted and exactly how much of\n\na restraining influence it will be.\n\nC. Exclusionary Interest\n\nThere is very little evidence of boundaries being drawn to\n\nreflect a security interest of the coastal state in excluding or\n\ncontrolling foreign activities off its coast.91 That security interthe\n\ncoastal state.\n\n91.

It is\n\npossible that traditional Soviet sensitivity concerning the security of the Arctic coast,\n\nat times associated with the so-called sector principle, was a factor that encouraged\n\nthe Soviet Union to regard the line set forth in the 1867 U.S. -Russia Convention\n\nceding Alaska as the maritime boundary; north of the Bering Strait, the line follows\n\na meridian of longitude due north into the Arctic Ocean.

Since the security factor is masked, it is difficult whether it actually influenced the behavior of governments.\n\nIn the Libya-Malta case, the Court noted that the delimitation\n\nresulting from its judgement is \"not so near to the coasts either Party as to make questions of security a particular in the present case.\"93 The tribunal in the Guinea-Bissau arbitration made a similar point, noting that security\n\nimplications are avoided under its proposed solution by the that each state controls the maritime territories opposite coasts and in their vicinity.94 It may well be that governments,\n\nlike these two tribunals, are more likely to test particular results against this security concern than to shape a specifically in response to this concern.\n\nIt is also sometimes difficult to tell whether a boundary\n\ndrawn to maximize access to and from a naval base, for example,\n\nis not - at least in the territorial sea - also designed to\n\nmaximize that state's control over foreign activities near the\n\nbase. It is reported that Soviet strategic interests with respect to\n\nthe main Pacific fleet naval base at Vladivostok produced a\n\nterritorial sea boundary more favorable to the U.S.S.R. than a\n\nhypothetical equidistant line.95 There can be no doubt that access\n\nto and from the base was a primary strategic concern.

The Truman Proclamation on the Continental shelf, supra\n\nnote 6, might suggest an analogous view of security (however unlikely the provenance\n\nof that limited vision from the world's dominant maritime power might appear\n\nto some observers). The preamble includes, as the final item in the list of justifications\n\nfor the assertion of jurisdiction over the resources of the continental shelf, the\n\nstatement, \"since self-protection compels the coastal nation to keep close watch over\n\nactivities off its shores which are of the nature necessary for utilization of these\n\nresources.\" Id.\n\n93.

Access to and from the Open Sea\n\nThere is ample evidence that concerns about access to and\n\nfrom the sea have influenced maritime boundaries either directly\n\nby altering or confirming their location or indirectly by\n\nprompting simultaneous agreement on substantive provisions\n\nprotecting navigation rights. The summary report with respect\n\nto the Baltic Sea notes that only navigation interests were\n\nstrong enough to prevail over the general use of equidistance in\n\nthat region.\n\nIt is often difficult to tell whether a state's preoccupation\n\nwith navigation derives primarily from economic or security\n\nconcerns. In this connection, it must be borne in mind that security\n\nconcerns regarding access relate not only to the naval and\n\nair forces of the particular coastal state, but to access for the\n\nforces of friendly states and, beyond that, to the protection of\n\ntrading and communications routes fundamental to the economy\n\nof the state.\n\nOne would expect most explicit concerns with naval access\n\nto be manifested by major naval powers. It is nevertheless interesting\n\nthat Soviet boundaries figure prominently in the references\n\nin the boundary studies to maritime boundaries configured in\n\nresponse to concerns about naval access.96 This may reflect the\n\ncircumstances of Soviet geography, the historic Russian and\n\n96. See Id.; see also Agreement Concerning the Sea Frontier in the\n\nVarangerfjord of 15 February 1957 and Protocol of 29 November 1957, Feb. 15,\n\n1957; Nov. 29, 1957, Nor.-U.S.S.R., Limits in the Seas, No. 17 (1970) in the \"strategically\n\nand politically sensitive\" area of the Varangerfjord, where the \"boundary\n\nruns, broadly speaking, across the broad mouth of the Gulf leaving plenty of water\n\non either side for access from the Qord to the Barents Sea\"; see also Agreement\n\nConcerning the Boundaries of Sea Areas and of the Continental Shelf in the Gulf of\n\nFinland, May 25, 1966, Fin.-U.S.S.R., 566 U.N.T.S. 37, where the territorial sea\n\nboundary in the Gulf of Finland established by the 1940 and 1947 peace treaties\n\nbetween the parties was heavily influenced by Soviet security concerns, and where\n\nGogland (Suursaari) Island was given only limited effect to safeguard free navigation\n\nnorth of it. The elaborate provisions in the Turkey-Soviet Union territorial sea agreement\n\nfor range markers and for situations where the markers are seen as overlapping\n\n(possibly causing a vessel to cross the line inadvertently) presumably reflect an\n\nunderlying concern about protecting navigation in an area of zealous coastal security\n\nenforcement. See Protocol Concerning the Territorial Sea Boundary Between the Two\n\nStates in the Black Sea, Apr. 17, 1973, Turk.-U.S.S.R., Limits in the Seas, No. 59\n\n[hereinafter Turkey-U.S.S.R.

While it is common\n\nin connection with base rights agreements to provide for rights\n\nof access through the waters and air space of the host state, the\n\nCyprus-United Kingdom agreement went further. It established\n\nlines extending seaward from the U.K. bases between which Cyprus\n\nmay not claim territorial waters.97 The United States' desire\n\nto protect transit routes to and from San Diego, where it\n\nhas a major naval base, is cited as a factor supporting the decision\n\nto give full effect to islands in a delimitation based on equidistance.\n\n98 France made strategic arguments, particularly regarding\n\naccess to the port of Cherbourg, in the Anglo-French\n\narbitration. In effect, the tribunal gave priority to French interests\n\nin navigation and security between the eastern and western\n\nparts of the English Channel.99\n\nStates may desire to ensure that specific navigation routes\n\nare within their own waters, or at least outside the waters of the\n\nneighboring state. The Soviet, U.K., U.S., and French examples\n\nalready cited are generally of this type. There are, however,\n\nothers.\n\nThe practice of dividing the deep channel continues to be\n\nused close to shore. This may be done when the channel extends\n\nseaward from a land boundary in a river: the inner part of the\n\nline used in the Guinea-Guinea-Bissau arbitration follows an\n\n97.

Enclavement\n\nA particular problem is posed by the so-called cut-off or\n\nenclavement effect that can arise when the maritime boundaries\n\nbetween a state and its neighbors meet at a point off its coast.\n\nIn the case of enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, some cut-off\n\neffects are unavoidable. Despite this fact, extension of a state's\n\njurisdiction so as to avoid enclavement by its boundaries with\n\nsome states (e.g., adjacent states) can minimize the number of\n\nstates whose zones stand between the \"enclaved\" state and the\n\nopen sea. Thus, for example, as a result of the agreements implementing\n\nthe decision in the North Sea Continental Shelf\n\ncases, the German continental shelf connects directly with the\n\nBritish for a small distance.112\n\nThe concern about enclavement may engage both types of\n\nperceived security interests. States prefer not to be surrounded\n\nby their neighbors. In some measure this concern may be political\n\nand psychological. States have articulated security concerns\n\nabout their capacity to conduct and control activities off their\n\ncoast. More concretely, states may be concerned about access\n\nbetween their territory and the open sea.\n\nIn three cases, the maritime zones of small states with the\n\nsame coastal neighbor on either side were protected from\n\nenclavement by the use of parallel lines defining the small\n\nstate's zones.113 With respect to The Gambia, parallels of latitude\n\nwere extended out into the open Atlantic.114 Monaco received\n\na corridor up to the outer limit of the territorial sea, as\n\nwell as a corridor beyond extending up to an equidistant line\n\nwith the opposite coast on the island of Corsica.115 The boundary\n\nlines between Dominica, on the one hand, and Martinique\n\nand Guadaloupe on the other, were extended in quasi-parallel\n\nfashion up to 200 miles on the Atlantic side.116\n\n112.
