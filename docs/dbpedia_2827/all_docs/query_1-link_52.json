They will be asked to contact the school to arrange a temporary travel document, and the school must then obtain new cards for the pupils in question. Temporary passes issued by the school must be used for the journey home from school that same day.\n\nOslo/Akershus\n\nPupils from Røyken and Hurum, who have Brakar school cards with a Ruter sticker may travel on Ruter buses as well.
