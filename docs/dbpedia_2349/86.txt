It seems that there are many essay collections in Logos that don't spell out what the titles of the included essays are. Like a lot of folks, I'm not partial to buying a pig in a poke. I'm sure some work would be involved, but taking the time to list what's actually included in these collections, usually a single named volume, should do wonders for sales.

Take this as an example...the title sounds interesting, but I'm not inclined to take a chance on it.

SPELL IT OUT...THE SELL IT OUT!!!

Thank you for posting the contents, MJ. It appears that, in the intervening time, I acquired this volume as part of a larger collection. I still believe that all essay collections ought to list the included essays in the promotional and product pages if FL wants to sell more resources.
