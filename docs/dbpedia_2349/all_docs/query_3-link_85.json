        "text": "When you‚Äôre writing a scholarly article or writing in a professional setting, you want to make sure that your grammar and style is meeting the required expectations. There may be a chance you‚Äôre writing about a book you‚Äôve read or citing sources in a research paper. If you‚Äôve ever found yourself wondering things like, ‚ÄúDo you italicize book titles or underline them?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do I cite shorter pieces of work properly?‚Äù then keep on reading!\n\nWe are going to give you all the details on when it‚Äôs correct to use italics, along with how to emphasize other types of reference material.\n\nPhoto by üá∏üáÆ Janko Ferliƒç on Unsplash\n\nDo You Italicize Book Titles?\n\nThe general rule of thumb is to use italics for long works and quotations for short work.\n\nBut depending on the format you‚Äôre meant to adhere by, the rules may vary. For example, you may be instructed to write according to the APA style, MLA, or Chicago Manual of Style. You should follow the rules dictated by the guidelines.\n\nWriting Formats\n\nModern Language Association (MLA): Used in arts and humanities\n\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA): Used in social sciences\n\nAssociated Press Stylebook (AP): Used for magazines, newspapers, and internet\n\nChicago Manual of Style (Chicago): Used from publishing to science, one of the most popular styles\n\nFor MLA, APA, and Chicago Manual of Style, you should use italics for long works and quotations for short works.\n\nFor AP style, however, you never use italics for pieces of work ‚Äî no matter the length. Additionally, the APA style neither uses quotation marks or italics for shorter works. Instead, it expects them to be written as normal text.\n\nSometimes, the choice of style may be up to you as a writer. If that‚Äôs the case, then it‚Äôs best to stay consistent throughout your work with your usage of italics, underlines and quotation marks.\n\nShort Works: How to Emphasize Titles of Shorter Pieces of Work\n\nWhen you are making reference to a title of an article or a chapter in a book, you shouldn‚Äôt put it in italics. Instead, you can use quotation marks to emphasize these smaller pieces of work. This is the same rule for titles of episodes of shows.\n\nDo You Italicize Punctuation in Titles?\n\nWhen a piece of work includes punctuation, like a question mark for example, that part of the title should be italicized, too. For example, you‚Äôd write, ‚ÄúI love the book Oh the Places, You‚Äôll Go! by Dr. Seuss.‚Äù\n\nHowever, when you are writing and using italics in a sentence for emphasis or within a parenthetical, then you do not italicize the punctuation.\n\nExceptions For Emphasizing Titles\n\nLike with most aspects of English, there are some exceptions to the rule. One exception is when you have a book that is a collection of various novel titles, like Lord of the Rings. In this case, you‚Äôd put the title of the specific books in quotation marks, but you‚Äôd keep the title of the collection in italics.\n\nAdditionally, when the word ‚Äúthe‚Äù is part of a title, you do not italicize it. For example, it‚Äôs correct to write the New York Times.\n\nHow To Capitalize Properly\n\nTitles have special formatting and capitalization rules. For example, you only capitalize the first word and all main words in a title.\n\nYou do not capitalize articles, such as ‚Äúa,‚Äù ‚Äúan‚Äù or ‚Äúthe.‚Äù For example, you‚Äôd write: War and Peace instead of War And Peace.\n\nWhen to Use Quotations Instead\n\nThere are very specific cases for when you should elect to use quotation marks for the titles of works as opposed to italics. Use quotations for:\n\nPoems\n\nArticles in journals or magazines\n\nSongs\n\nShort stories\n\nBook chapters\n\nTelevision episodes\n\nPhoto by Corinne Kutz on Unsplash\n\nExamples of Correct Usage of Italics\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of examples to help for reference sake:\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes (movie title, notice that articles are lower case)\n\nThe Cat in the Hat (book title)\n\n‚ÄúMary Had a Little Lamb‚Äù (song title)\n\n‚ÄúHow Pandemics End‚Äù (article title)\n\nThe New York Times (newspaper title)\n\n‚ÄúThe Tell-Tale Heart‚Äù (a short story)\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nKnowing when to italicize or use quotation marks is not a one-size-fits-all answer. It may depend on the writing format you‚Äôve been instructed to write in.\n\nHowever, a general rule of thumb to follow is that longer pieces of work, like books, require italics, whereas shorter pieces of work, like poems or articles, will be written with quotation marks."
