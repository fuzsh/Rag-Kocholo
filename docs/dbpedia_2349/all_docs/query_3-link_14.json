Like a lot of folks, I'm not partial to buying a pig in a poke. I'm sure some work would be involved, but taking the time to list what's actually included in these collections, usually a single named volume, should do wonders for sales.\n\nTake this as an example...the title sounds interesting, but I'm not inclined to take a chance on it.\n\nSPELL IT OUT...THE SELL IT OUT!!!\n\nASUS ProArt x570s Creator, AMD R9 5950x, HyperX 64gb 3600 RAM, ASUS Strix RTX 2080 ti\n\n\"The Unbelievable Work...believe it or not.\" Little children...Biblical prophecy is not Christianity's friend.\n\nThank you for posting the contents, MJ. It appears that, in the intervening time, I acquired this volume as part of a larger collection. I still believe that all essay collections ought to list the included essays in the promotional and product pages if FL wants to sell more resources.\n\nASUS ProArt x570s Creator, AMD R9 5950x, HyperX 64gb 3600 RAM, ASUS Strix RTX 2080 ti\n\n\"The Unbelievable Work...believe it or not.\" Little children...Biblical prophecy is not Christianity's friend."
