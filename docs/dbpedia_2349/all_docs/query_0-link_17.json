Aya is threatened with deportation to a place she cannot remember: under a hostile immigration system, Denmark has begun trying to send back refugees from Damascus, claiming the city is now safe under the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.

We join Aya at her graduation surrounded by her schoolmates, teachers, friends and family who are rallying around her as she fights to stay.\n\nKey credits:\n\nDirector: Michael Graversen\n\nProducer: Jesper Jack\n\nDirector of photography: Simon Dixgaard and Michael Graversen\n\nEditor: Mikael Kloster Ebbesen\n\nProduction manager: Ida Dolmer\n\nSound design and mix: Raoul Brand\n\nColourist: Anders V.
