        "text": "Access Date\n\nWorks from the web can be changed or removed at any time, so it is often important to include the date you accessed the material in your citation. This is optional, but is especially important when there is no date specifying when the item (web document, article, webpage) was produced, or you believe the source has been edited without notice. Add the access date to the end of your citation. E.g. Accessed 23 July 2019.\n\nAuthors/Editors\n\nAn author can be a person but can also be an organization, or company. These are called group or corporate authors.\n\nIf you are citing a chapter from a book that has an editor, the author of the chapter is listed first, and is the name listed in the in-text citation.\n\nDates\n\nThe format of all dates is: Day Month (shortened) Year. E.g. 5 Sept. 2012.\n\nWrite the full date as you find it on the source. If there is only a year listed, you will only put the year in your citation. For others, you will also include a month and day if they are given.\n\nIf there is no date listed, just leave it out unless you can find that information available in a reliable source. In that case the date is cited in square brackets to show that you found that information somewhere else. E.g. [2008]\n\nPage Numbers\n\nOn your Works Cited page (but not for in-text citations), single page numbers are preceded by p. and a range of page numbers is preceded by pp. E.g. p. 156 or pp. 79-92.\n\nPublishers\n\nYou have the option to use the shortened name of the publisher. For example, you can use UP instead of University Press (e.g. Oxford UP instead of the full name Oxford University Press).\n\nYou also have the option to remove articles (A, An, The), business abbreviations (e.g. Co., Inc.) and descriptive words (e.g. Books, House, Press, Publishers).\n\nTitles\n\nCapitalize the first letter of every important word in the title. You do not need to capitalize words such as: in, of, or an. Do not use all-caps (except for words like USA where each letter stands for something), even if the words appear that way on the book or article.\n\nIf there is a colon (:) in the title, include what comes after the colon (also known as the subtitle)."
