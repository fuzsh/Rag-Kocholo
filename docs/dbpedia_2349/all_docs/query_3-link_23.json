        "text": "APA Style: How to Write Book Titles in Essays\n\nWhen writing an essay, you must follow the style guide provided by your professor. Some teachers may require you to use APA style and others MLA style. There are some rules on how to quote a book title in an essay. You should use italics and quotation marks when writing book titles in essays. For example: “The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II.“\n\nWhen writing a book title in APA Style, you should be aware of these rules:\n\nWrite the book title in italics and place it after the author’s name, which is presented in reverse order (last name first).\n\nUse quotation marks around the headline of a chapter or article.\n\nCapitalize proper names that are not common nouns (names of people, places, organizations), but do not capitalize words such as “and,” “or,” “to,” or “and/or.”\n\nDo not capitalize prepositions that appear at the beginning of titles if they are followed by an article (e.g., “A,” “An”), but do capitalize prepositions at the beginning of titles if they are not followed by articles (“Of”).\n\nThe first word of the headline should be capitalized, as well as any other words after a colon or hyphen. For example, “The Elements of Style: Grammar for Everyone” or “Theories of Personality: Critical Perspectives.”\n\nCapitalize proper names and words derived from them (e.g., the names of people, places, organizations), except proper nouns used generically (e.g., ‘a bed’).\n\nAPA Style Essay: Writing The Name of The Author\n\nYou should always use the full name and surname of the author in your APA essay because this will give proper credit to the writer. If you do not mention the author’s full name, people may not know who wrote what and will think you copied it from somewhere else. This will cause lots of problems for you and your reputation as well.\n\nMake sure that all authors’ names appear in the same format in each entry. For example, if one person’s surname is Smith and another’s is Jones, both have first names starting with “J.” It may seem like they are being cited as different people when they’re actually written differently from each other on separate pages in your paper.\n\nTo write an APA essay without any issues, there are certain rules that you need to follow while writing an author’s name in APA essay:\n\nUse only one author’s name in your paper unless there are multiple authors\n\nIf there are multiple authors, then use both their last names followed by the initials of their first names\n\nOnly use initials of first names when there are three or more authors; otherwise, use full names with their last names\n\nExample: Johnson, M.C., Carlson, M., Smith, J. N., & Hanover, L. E.\n\nMLA Style Essay: Citing a Book Title\n\nNow let’s discuss how to mention a book in an essay. The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th edition, published by the Modern Language Association (2014), contains detailed rules about how to cite a book title in an essay.\n\nThe general format for citing the title of the book in an essay is as follows:\n\nAuthor’s last name, first initial (Date). Title of Book with Subtitle if there is one. Publisher Name/Location of Publisher; Year Published\n\nChicago Style Essay: Writing the Book Title\n\nOne of the most important things to remember when writing in Chicago style is how to write the title of a book in an essay. To write a good book title in an essay, you should follow these steps:\n\nWrite it at the beginning of your sentence.\n\nCapitalize it just like any other noun or proper noun.\n\nPut a comma after the title unless it’s an introductory clause or phrase. For example: “The Firm,” by John Grisham (not “by”) and “The Catcher in the Rye,” by J.D Salinger (not “and”).\n\nIn addition to the book’s name, punctuation marks should also be italicized.\n\nFor example: Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince: Children’s Edition\n\nWriting Various Types of Titles\n\nNow that we covered how to write a book title and author in an essay, it’s time to look at some different types of titles. When you write a book title in an essay, several things must be considered. Whether it’s a book, series, chapter title, editor’s name, or author’s name, how you write it depends on where it appears in your paper.\n\nHere are some key rules for writing headings for novels:\n\nUse capital letters to write the title of the novel. For example, The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n\nUse italics and capital letters to write the name of the author and his/her other works mentioned in a book title—for example, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1813).\n\nYou should use quotation marks when writing headings of short title poems, articles, and stories.\n\nHowever, before deciding which format to use, it is important to understand the main idea you want to express in your essay. Additionally, you could use essay papers for sale to help you accomplish your goal of writing an essay effectively.\n\nShould We Underline or Italicize Book Titles?\n\nIt depends on which style guide you use. The Modern Language Association and Chicago Manual of Style both suggest using italics, while the American Psychological Association suggests using quotation marks with a few exceptions."
