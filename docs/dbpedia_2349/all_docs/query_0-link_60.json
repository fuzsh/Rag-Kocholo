        "text": "The procedure for emergency arbitration was first introduced by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (the “ICDR’) in 2006 and since then the concept of emergency arbitration has made its way into the rules of several international arbitral institutions and some countries have also recognized emergency arbitration in their legislations, writes Jaai Dashpute, Legal Professional.\n\nJaai Dashpute, Legal Professional, Denmark\n\nTalking of rapidly growing economies like India and Denmark, which are ‘home’ and ‘home away from home’ for me, it’s important to highlight the economic activity between the two nations. The year 2024 marks 75 years of diplomatic ties between India and the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nNearly 200 Danish Companies have invested in India in various sectors including shipping, renewable energy, and environment. Around 25 Indian companies are present in Denmark in various sectors, including IT, renewable energy and engineering. According to the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India, there has also been a significant rise in bilateral trade between the two countries on a year-on-year basis.\n\nWith the growing business relations, it makes sense to examine the effectiveness of dispute resolution mechanisms, including as regards emergency arbitration, in ensuring ease of doing business in India as well as Denmark.\n\nEmergency Arbitrations in India\n\nIn India, emergency arbitrations have not yet found their way into ‘The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996’ – last amended in 2021. However, in a recent Supreme Court of India Judgment in the matter of “Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC Future Retail Limited & Ors.” dated August 6, 2021, the apex court upheld the golden principles of party autonomy in arbitration proceedings and validated the appointment of emergency arbitrators.\n\nThe Court held that, “full party autonomy is given by the Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in accordance with institutional rules which can include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim orders, described as “awards”. Such orders are an important step in aid of decongesting the civil courts and affording expeditious interim relief to the parties.”\n\nIn the aforesaid Judgment, the Supreme Court has highlighted some observations made in the Srikrishna Committee Report on the enforceability of emergency awards. Reproducing excerpts from the report below:\n\n“While one could possibly rely on section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act to enforce emergency awards for arbitrations seated in India, the Delhi High Court decision in Raffles Design International India Pvt. Ltd.& Anr. v. Educomp Professional Education Ltd. & Ors., (2016) 234 DLT 349 held that an emergency award in an arbitration seated outside India is not enforceable in India.\n\nGiven that international practice is in favour of enforcing emergency awards (Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom all permit enforcement of emergency awards), it is time that India permitted the enforcement of emergency awards in all arbitral proceedings. This would also provide legislative support to rules of arbitral institutions that presently provide for emergency arbitrators (See Dennis Nolan and Roger Abrams, ‘Arbitral Immunity’, Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labour Law, Vol. 11 Issue 2 (1989), pp.228–266). For this purpose, the recommendation made by the LCI in its 246th Report may be adopted.”\n\nEmergency Arbitrations in Denmark\n\nThe Danish Institute of Arbitration has been a first mover in Denmark in terms of introducing rules for emergency arbitrations in Appendix 3 of its Arbitration Rules which were effective from 1 May 2013. On occasion of the launch of the 2013 rules, Steffen Pihlblad, Secretary-General at the DIA expressed his views on emergency arbitrations in the Erhvervsjuridisk Tidsskrift (edition 303 of 2013) and stated “The purpose of the scheme is to fill the gaps between the time when a party wants a provisional order for interim remedies and on the other hand the time taken to appoint and approve the arbitral tribunal by the Institute”. The current rules of the DIA which are effective from 13 April 2021 contain the provisions at Article 48 and in Appendix 4. Emergency arbitration is not commonly used by parties at the DIA. This is reflected in the figures presented by the Roschier Disputes Index this year that provides an insight into dispute resolution within the Nordic jurisdictions. The index states that only “2% of the respondents said they had been involved in emergency arbitrator proceedings in Sweden and Norway”.\n\nWay forward\n\nPap Daniel, Lawyer at the European Court of Human rights in his piece ‘When justice delayed is justice denied: Advantages and Disadvantages of Emergency Arbitration in comparison with Interim relief’ made the below concluding remarks which stress on the amendment of national laws to strengthen the legal position of emergency arbitrations and are noteworthy.\n\n“The more likely solution would be that pro-arbitration states amend their national laws to be similar to those of Hong Kong or Singapore, which recognise emergency arbitration decisions as enforceable. To serve as a final solution to the problems highlighted above, any such amendment to domestic legislation should include a definition of “arbitrator” or “arbitral tribunal” that also covers emergency arbitrators, similarly to the wording adopted by New Zealand in its Arbitration Act 33 to quash any challenge linked to the interpretation on the competences of an arbitrator. Moreover, national laws should recognise the enforceability of emergency arbitration, irrespective of whether it was handed down as an order or an award and irrespective of the seat of arbitration. As emergency arbitration is coming of age, we will see more crystallised case law on these issues, which could potentially gear up a wave of domestic legislation in pro-arbitration states.”\n\nFACTS\n\nWhat factors are considered to accept an emergency arbitration application?\n\nArticle 17 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 2006 deals with the power of an arbitral tribunal to order interim measures where it may order a party to:\n\n(a) Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;\n\n(b) Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, current or imminent harm or prejudice to the arbitral process itself;\n\n(c) Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied; or\n\n(d) Preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute.\n\nFurther, Article 17A of the Model Law details the conditions for granting interim measures which need to be satisfied by the requesting party:\n\n(a) Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and\n\n(b) There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal in making any subsequent determination.\n\nThe Danish Institute of Arbitration includes emergency arbitration in Article 48 of its Rules for Arbitration 2021 “Where the taking of evidence or interim measures cannot await the confirmation of the arbitrator(s) under the Rules, it may be done with assistance from an interim arbitrator or an emergency arbitrator in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendices 3 and 4, respectively.”\n\nThis year, the Copenhagen Arbitration Day 2024 takes place on 4 September. It is an honor to present an excellent program with some of the most brilliant practitioners in the field. The conference is hosted by the Danish Institute of Arbitration (DIA) and ICC Denmark. For the first time, we also have the pleasure to arrange the inaugural conference Women in Arbitration on 5 September 2024.\n\nBy Håkun Djurhuus, Chair of the Danish Institute of Arbitration\n\nAs Chair of the Danish Institute of Arbitration (DIA) I am delighted to welcome you to this year’s Copenhagen Arbitration Day. The conference is hosted by DIA and ICC Denmark.\n\nWhen we open the doors to Copenhagen Arbitration Day 2024 on 4 September, it will be with great excitement. We have once again succeeded in gathering some of the best arbitrators and profiles from the international arbitration scene. It is an outstanding opportunity to explore fundamental issues in international arbitration, to network with peers and to be updated on the most important trends within the field of international arbitration.\n\nThe overall topic of the conference is Developing Arbitration amid Challenging Times. This year’s theme recognizes the fact that arbitration remains to be the preferred way to resolve commercial disputes – especially in times of crisis. At the DIA, we understand that arbitration must develop with changing times to ensure that parties continue to access effective dispute resolution. We have experienced arbitration’s ability to quickly adapt to new demands during COVID-19 and recently with the rapid developments in international trade sanctions. With new challenges in the horizon, such as the use of AI, the impact of ESG on businesses and continued geopolitical tensions, it is crucial that arbitration remains responsive to the changing needs so that parties can continue to rely on it as a trusted and efficient way to settle their commercial disputes.\n\nI am honored to present an excellent program and I am immensely grateful to our speakers, who are all amongst some of the most recognized practitioners in the field.\n\nThe event takes place at the House of Industry – the headquarters of the Confederation of Danish Industry (DI) – located in the heart of Copenhagen between Tivoli Gardens and Copenhagen City Hall. True to tradition, the event will be concluded with a drinks and dinner.\n\nI would like to extend my thanks to the University of Copenhagen, Accura, and Kromann Reumert for hosting the lunch seminars, which are always such a well-received part of the Copenhagen Arbitration Day. They certainly managed to put some insightful seminars together, which underline the professionalism and expertise within international arbitration in Denmark. This continuous focus is the reason why we today see the DIA as a strong institute surrounded by supportive and active associations – the Danish Arbitration Association and Young Arbitrators Copenhagen. The arbitration community continues to grow, and the popular arbitrators’ education keeps attracting prospective arbitrators from the region which only further deepens our pool of excellent arbitrators. All this goes hand in hand with the progress of the DIA where we have already seen a significant increase in our case load.\n\nGetting more women to enter the scene as arbitrators is of great priority at the DIA. In campaigning for this cause, we started a new series of interviews in the DIA Newsletter and are working on an upcoming podcast-series – both aiming to highlight outstanding Danish and international women in arbitration and who generously offer their insights and advice to empower other women to take their first steps towards their first appointment. To underline the importance of this topic and to support the progress already made, the DIA invites everyone to the inaugural event Women in Arbitration, where a panel of prominent female arbitrators will share their stories and the experiences they have gained in their careers in arbitration. The event takes place the day after Copenhagen Arbitration Day, i.e. on 5 September from 10:00 until 12:00 in the famed Valencia building, which was a legendary dance hall many years ago, but nowadays is the headquarters of the Association of Danish Law Firms.\n\nFinally, I would like to express my gratitude and thank our sponsors, including our main sponsor Dreyer’s Foundation, for their invaluable support, the Confederation of Danish Industry for hosting the event and the Young Arbitrators Copenhagen for hosting the drinks reception the evening before Copenhagen Arbitration Day.\n\nSee you on 4 and 5 September in Copenhagen!\n\nGO TO PROGRAM, INFORMATION AND REGISTRATION:\n\nhttps://na.eventscloud.com/cad2024\n\nNordic Arbitration Day 2024 took place in Helsinki on 26-27 April. The event was quickly sold out with more than 200 participants, and it became just the vibrant event full of great discussions and new connections as the organizers from Young Arbitrators Club Finland (YACF) had wished for.\n\nBy Daniel Haue Jakobsson, Young Arbitrators Copenhagen, partner, Accura, and Linnea Klingberg-Jensen, Young Arbitrators Copenhagen, Director, Kromann Reumert\n\nNordic Arbitration Day is a yearly event aimed at young arbitration practitioners – under 45 years old – with the goal to expand the knowledge of arbitration and nurture the community of arbitration practitioners and aspiring arbitrators among the Nordic countries. It is organized by the young arbitration associations in the Nordic countries (Young Arbitrators Copenhagen (YAC), Young Arbitrators Sweden (YAS), Young Arbitration Practitioners Norway (YAPN), Young Arbitrators Club Finland (YACF) and Young Arbitration Practitioners Iceland (YAPI)), and the venue rotates between the Nordic countries, with Stockholm hosting the first conference in 2019.\n\nThis year, Nordic Arbitration Day was held in Helsinki and included insightful pre-conference events, engaging debates, panel discussions, dinner, drinks and finally karaoke, which turned out to be a big thing in Helsinki.\n\nOne memorable event was the pre-conference event organized by the Swedish Arbitration Association with Ginta Ahrel, Partner, Westerberg & Partners and member of the SAA Executive Committee, and Gisela Knuts, Independent Arbitrator, President of the Finnish Arbitration Association. Ginta and Gisela shared their vast experience and engaged in a highly relevant discussion for young aspiring arbitrators on “How To … Become an Arbitrator”. This included war stories from their first appointments, networking strategies and insights as to how the decisions are made within the tribunal.\n\nFollowing the pre-conference events, the Finnish law firm Krogerus hosted the mandatory Nordic Arbitration Day pre-conference welcome – and cocktail – reception, where the participants from the pre-conference events and the participants in Nordic Arbitration Day got the chance to get together.\n\nEngaging debates and panel discussions\n\nThe conference itself took place just next to the beautiful Helsinki harbor, where the participants enjoyed a number of engaging debates and panel discussions. From Young Arbitrators Copenhagen, board members Daniel Haue Jakobsson, Partner, Accura, and Linnea Klingberg-Jensen, Director, Kromann Reumert, participated in two of the panels. Daniel’s panel discussed the topic “The Way from Winning Your Cases to Your First Arbitral Appointment”, where he shared insights from his arbitral appointments as a sole arbitrator with the Danish Institute of Arbitration, how he managed to receive his first arbitral appointment and shared war stories of how acting as arbitrator in a small case does not necessarily mean that it is easy to handle. Linnea participated in the Nordic Arbitration Day classic “Soap Box Debate”, where the participants are assigned a topic to discuss and submit a verbal motion for their respective position. The topics debated this year were if counsel should rely rather on the powers of persuasion than soft law when arguing before an arbitral tribunal? And whether there should be rules for the decision-making process in a tribunal to avoid bias/likeminded thinking? Both topics engaged the audience to ask questions and the debate included interesting views on the topics.\n\nJust as the conference day was coming to an end, the sun came out and made it possible to enjoy informal discussions with the other conference participants outside before meeting up in smaller dinner groups at different restaurants in central Helsinki. The dinner groups were a new initiative arranged by the YACF, and it turned out to be a great way to socialize with fellow practitioners while enjoying good food.\n\nThe conference finished with the Finnish organizers having arranged an afterparty and asking the question “What better way to experience Helsinki than through Karaoke?” They were right.\n\nIn summary, participating in Nordic Arbitration Day is highly recommendable, and it is definitely an event which should be prioritized among young aspiring arbitrators. Save the Date for 2025, where Nordic Arbitration Day will take place in Reykjavik, Iceland, hosted by Young Arbitration Practitioners Iceland (YAPI).\n\nThe April issue of the Danish Institute of Arbitration Newsletter included an article by Anders Amstrup Fournais, titled “Are EU sanctions public policy?” The present article is aimed at adding to the dialogue by setting out the relevant case law of French courts, which confirms that EU sanctions are public policy, and clarifies the contours of the control exercised by the French judge when reviewing arbitration awards for violation of public policy in cases raising sanctions issues, writes Athina Fouchard Papaefstratiou, independent arbitrator, Paris.\n\nAthina Fouchard Papaefstratiou, Independent Arbitrator, AFP Arbitration, Paris\n\nWith sanctions used four times as much as they were in the 1990s, with blocking regulations and counter-sanctions coming into play, international arbitration practitioners today are likely to face cases raising challenging sanctions issues.\n\nIn such cases, the national judge may control the decisions of the arbitrator relating to sanctions via the public policy exception. Are sanctions public policy? Will the award be annulled or not be enforced as contrary to public policy if it erroneously considers that the sanctions regime does not apply? Can a party raise the existence of sanctions for the first time before the annulment judge?\n\nThe present article will present the relevant findings of three recent cases of French courts.\n\nTCM FR v. NGSC case (“the Sofregaz case”)\n\n(Cassation Court decision of 9 Feb 22, confirming Paris Court of Appeal decision of 3 June 2020)\n\nThe French company TCM FR (formerly Sofregaz), as contractor, had entered into a contract with an Iranian state-owned entity, for construction works related to a project for the storage of gas. The contractual price was in US dollars. Against the background of US sanctions against Iran, TCM FR informed the Iranian entity that it was unable to renew the bank guarantees. The Iranian company terminated the contract on the ground of several contractual breaches and called on the guarantees. TCM FR filed a request for arbitration with the ICC, seeking a declaration that the termination of the contract was abusive, that the call on the guarantees was undue, and claiming damages. The Iranian entity submitted counterclaims. The arbitral tribunal ordered both the claimant and the respondent to pay certain amounts and, following a set-off, TCM FR was the award debtor. TCM filed a request for annulment before the Paris Court of Appeal, claiming that the award was contrary to French international public policy (the set of rules and values of which the French legal system cannot accept the violation, even in situations of international character), as giving effect to a contract which was contrary to US, EU and UN sanctions.\n\nOne issue the Paris Court of Appeal had to decide was whether TCM was estopped from alleging that the contract violated international public policy, as TCM had previously claimed before the arbitral tribunal that the contract was abusively terminated. The Court of Appeal held that the principle of procedural estoppel does not prevent the annulment judge from assessing whether an award is contrary to French international public policy.\n\nThe court further held that the US sanctions are not part of the French international public policy despite their intended extraterritorial application. They are simply foreign mandatory law provisions. On the contrary, the UN sanctions, as truly international sanctions aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security, are part of the French international public policy. Lastly, the EU sanctions, of immediate effect in the French public order, are also part of the French public policy. However, the EU and UN sanctions were not applicable in the circumstances.\n\nThe French Cassation Court confirmed the judgement of the Court of Appeal.\n\nDNO v. Yemen case\n\n(Paris Court of Appeal decision of 5 Oct 2021)\n\nThe dispute related to a production sharing agreement between several private companies, including the claimants in the arbitration on one side, and the Ministry of Oil and Minerals of Yemen, as well as the Yemen Oil and Gas Corporation, on the other. The Ministry and the Yemeni public entity contested the termination of the agreement by the private companies and initiated ICC arbitration. The tribunal ruled that certain companies did not exercise validly their right of withdrawal, and ordered them to pay the Yemeni State and State-owned entity 31 million US dollars.\n\nAn application for annulment of the award was filed with the Paris Court of Appeal, on the basis, amongst others, that the award violated French international public policy due to the risk that the sums awarded to the Yemen Oil and Gas Corporation, allegedly controlled by the Houthis, might end up in the hands of the main Houthi leaders, individuals targeted by UN and EU sanctions.\n\nThe Court of Appeal held as follows:\n\nThe conformity of an award with international public policy is assessed at the time of the judgment. Therefore, the hypothetical, future use by one of the parties of the awarded amounts for actions violating the values and principles protected by the international public policy cannot be used as a ground for annulment of an award.\n\nInternational and EU sanctions form part of international public policy, insofar as they aim to maintain and restore international peace and security, values of which the French legal system cannot allow the violation. However, neither the Ministry nor the Yemen Oil and Gas Corporation is on a list of international or European sanctions, and it is not within the jurisdiction of the court to extend these sanctions to individuals and entities who are not expressly targeted by them.\n\nIt is the role of the annulment judge to verify that the recognition of the award is not likely to violate the sanctions regime by directly or even indirectly making funds available to individuals targeted by the sanctions. To establish such indirect provision of funds, the applicants should have demonstrated that (i) the Ministry and the public entity act on behalf, under the control, or upon the instruction of the listed individuals, and (ii) they intend to use the disputed funds for the benefit of these individuals. This was not established in the circumstances.\n\nAD Trade v. Guinea case\n\n(Paris Court of Appeal decision of 13 April 2021)\n\nThe dispute related to the unilateral termination by the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Guinea of several contracts with a Belgian company involving the creation of an intelligence service unit for the presidency and the provision of security for the presidential residence. In the ensuing arbitration initiated by the Belgian company, the State was ordered to pay compensation.\n\nGuinea filed an application for annulment of the award before the Paris Court of Appeal, arguing, among other things and for the first time, that enforcing the award would give effect to a contract violating EU embargo measures against Guinea, and would therefore be contrary to international public policy.\n\nThe Paris Court of Appeal noted that the violation of public policy is to be assessed at the time of examination by the annulment judge, rather than at the date of the award or the date of the conclusion of the contract. As the embargo had been lifted by the time of the Court of Appeal’s decision, there was no violation of French international public policy. The Court of Appeal also noted that the contract in any event had never been covered by the embargo measures.\n\nIn a nutshell – the French courts’ position\n\nSeveral points are noteworthy regarding the above-mentioned decisions of the French judge.\n\nUN sanctions, as truly international sanctions aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security, are part of the French international public policy. EU sanctions, which are of immediate effect in the French public order, are also part of the French international public policy. The US extraterritorial sanctions on the other hand are not. They are simply foreign mandatory law provisions (Sofregaz).\n\nThe controlling judge may also consider indirect violations of sanctions, when the entity receiving funds under the arbitral award acts under the control or upon the instruction of sanctioned entities or individuals, and the funds will be used by such entities or individuals (DNO v. Yemen).\n\nThe question of violation of sanctions and hence of public policy may be raised for the first time before the annulment court (Sofregaz, AD Trade v. Guinea).\n\nThe French judge will assess potential sanctions violations only at the time of the decision on annulment (AD Trade v Guinea). In the hypothesis that the arbitrator renders an award that violates a sanctions regime, the award will not be annulled if the sanctions have been lifted in the meantime.\n\nThe party targeted by the sanctions is not estopped from bringing the question of violation of sanctions before the French judge (Sofregaz).\n\nIs there a trend to involve arbitrators personally in challenge litigations? In this article, Professor Mads Bryde Andersen discusses arbitrators’ exposure to professional liability claims and shares strategic considerations to mitigate such risks in advance.\n\nBy Mads Bryde Andersen, Professor University of Copenhagen\n\nA successful state court litigation by which an arbitral award is set aside or denied recognition or enforcement may in principle be succeeded by claims raised against the arbitral tribunal, individual arbitrators, and/or arbitration institutes. Such claims may take the form of claims for the reimbursement of arbitrator’s fees or as professional liability claims for compensation for the parties’ losses caused by arbitral proceedings that did not lead to a binding award.\n\nIn the context of challenge litigations, arbitrators have sometimes been called as witnesses (against their wish) to testify on the proceedings and deliberations of the tribunal. In other cases, arbitrators have been claimed to be liable in damage for their alleged wrongdoings.\n\nIn all such cases, the defendant arbitrator, tribunal, or arbitration institute “stand accused”, directly or indirectly, for not having conducted the proceedings as they ought to have, e.g. under principles of due process or specific mandatory rules.\n\nArbitrators are not immune to such liability: In a civilized society, everybody has—and should have—the privilege to take their legal complaints to courts or other competent bodies and to claim compensation. In general, the scope of such liability, however, depends on the kind of mistake that gave rise to the claim.\n\nIn Roulas v. Professor J Tepora, the Finnish Supreme Court held an arbitrator liable for having accepted an appointment in a dispute where he had provided an expert opinion to one of the parties prior to and during the arbitration proceedings without disclosing that to the other party. This lack of disclosure resulted in a monetary liability that amounted to a compensation of EUR 81,000.\n\nIn the Qnow case, the Netherlands Supreme Court held the president of an arbitral tribunal liable for a procedural error (not having the award signed by his fellow arbitrators).\n\nIn the Puma Case, the Spanish Supreme Court set aside an award that had been conducted contrary to the principle of arbitral collegiality because one of the arbitrators had not participated in the final deliberations. The party could therefore recover the fees paid to two arbitrators.\n\nAs of yet, there is no reported Danish case law on arbitrators’ liability. However, in a case decided by the Danish High Court for the Eastern Circuit, a court appointed expert witness was held liable towards one of the parties for damages caused by his flawed conduct, including excess of his mandate. Damages were awarded on a discretionary basis to DKK 10,000.\n\nIn all the reported four cases, the arbitrators (respectively, the expert witness) had acted with more than simple negligence. This might be seen to support a general assumption that claims for liability are only available if the actions or omissions of the arbitrator qualify as gross negligence.\n\nThis legal situation seems to be reflected in the legislation which has been adopted in jurisdictions that have regulated arbitrator’s liability. One such example is section 29 (1) of the English Arbitration Act 1996, which provides that ”An arbitrator is not liable for anything done or omitted in the discharge or purported discharge of his functions as arbitrator unless the act or omission is shown to have been in bad faith.” Provisions regarding limitation of liability have been adopted by a number of arbitration institutes, including the ICC and the DIA.\n\nAgainst this background, there are some strategic considerations regarding their liability that prospective arbitrators can make before accepting nominations.\n\nChoice of Law\n\nWhen it comes to the arbitrator’s risk of facing liability, the law of the seat of the arbitration (the lex arbitri) will be the law under which the claim for liability shall be decided. When arbitrators accept appointment, they also accept this choice of jurisdiction. That choice therefore comprises the first and most fundamental strategic decision for prospective arbitrators who want to manage their exposure to personal liability claims.\n\nContractual Solutions\n\nIt is the prevailing view in Nordic legal theory that the tribunal and the parties may be seen as partners in a sui generis “procedural association” based on the arbitration clause. In this perspective, arbitration is a contractual phenomenon.\n\nFollowing that theory, the basis for a claim against the arbitrators must necessarily be contractual. On one side, this means that applicable standards of contractual negligence apply, subject to the contractual provisions agreed. On the other side, the door will also be open for contractual provisions limiting or prescribing that liability.\n\nInsurance Issues\n\nMany arbitration institutes have taken out insurance to cover their possible liability for such claims. The presence of such insurance coverage may invite liability claims because of the presumed “deep pockets” of the insurance companies. The prospects of this may in itself be a good reason not to disclose the details of any insurance coverage. Moreover, arbitrators, the tribunal (as such), and/or the arbitration institute may not share interests in the outcome and handling of such liability claims. For these reasons, it is not easy to blame some arbitration institutes for not being more transparent on how arbitrators and secretaries, etc., are covered by insurance.\n\nAnother uncertain factor is what role the arbitration institute will take, should liability claims be raised against the tribunal or individual arbitrators. In a Danish challenge decision, the Building and Construction Arbitration Board stepped in to support the defendant arbitrator in the litigation. In general, however, arbitration institutes cannot be expected to do so, unless they have compelling reasons.\n\nStrategic Issues in the Conduct of the Proceedings\n\nThere are many other strategic issues than those discussed in the foregoing that one should take into account in order to reduce the risk of a challenge litigation or liability claims.\n\nOne such issue is the prospective arbitrator’s handling of conflicts of interest disclosures (to the detriment of confidentiality protection). Here, one may argue that the risk of having the award set aside on grounds that an arbitrator was in a conflict of interest is reduced the more information the prospective arbitrator discloses. However, an overload of information on “possible” (albeit far from real) conflicts may, invite protests that may be used strategically.\n\nAnother practical consequence may be the tribunal’s decisions on document production. The more documentation the tribunal allows, the less basis will the unsuccessful party have to challenge the award. However, a generous policy towards document disclosure requests may be viewed as biased to the detriment of the other party. The “generosity” of the tribunal in those regards will often depend on the circumstances. In high-end commercial arbitrations, where the parties seek to have all stones turned, the level might be quite high. The parties and the tribunal will thus have to strike a balance of what procedures provide the “best possible” procedural safeguards given the associated additional time and costs.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIf there is indeed, as suggested above, an increasing trend to challenge arbitral awards, I fail to see that this trend may be rooted in a decline in the quality of arbitration. Quite the contrary, it seems plausible to assume that the increasing quality of arbitral proceedings has made it easier to identify details in the proceedings or the decisions that might be criticized and form the basis for challenge litigations and subsequent claims for liability.\n\nIf the trend to accuse tribunals of procedural failures, etc., in various forms increases, there may be a need to reconsider the way in which arbitration in general – and in particular, high-end commercial arbitration – is conducted. Perhaps arbitrators in high-end disputes should perceive themselves as what they basically are: high-end service providers. Such perceptions might make it adequate to open up for pre-arbitration negotiations between the disputing parties and the arbitrators on some of these issues that affect the risks discussed here, including the basis for possible liability, insurance issues and the use of administrative and even legal secretaries. Such negotiation- and contracting practices may reduce the risks of disappointments in the arbitral procedure and thereby also the risk of liability claims.\n\nMads Bryde Andersen\n\nDr.jur., Professor of private law at the University of Copenhagen since 1991.

A key issue is whether EU sanctions constitute European public policy that must be applied by arbitral tribunals to avoid risk regarding the validity of the award. Can an arbitral award that violates EU sanctions be set aside or refused to be enforced on grounds of public policy?\n\nAnders Amstrup Fournais, Attorney (H) and Partner, Hafnia Law Firm\n\nThe Danish Arbitration Act does only provide very limited legal basis for the courts to set aside or refuse to enforce an arbitral award on grounds that the arbitrators have committed errors of law.\n\nArbitral awards are as the clear starting point final and binding and should be complied with. Under the New York Convention (United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards), Article 5(2)(b), the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may, however, be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country. This provision is incorporated in the Danish Arbitration Act, Sections 37(2)(2)(b) and 39(1)(2)(b).\n\nThe question is whether violation of EU sanctions in an arbitral award would be contrary to public policy that may, consequently, lead to that the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused.\n\nPractitioners with expertise in sanctions will probably say that international trade sanctions must be applied by the courts and arbitral tribunals and surely sanctions must take priority over arbitration. On the other hand, arbitration practitioners will probably disagree and will argue that errors of law are a risk that commercial parties must accept when opting for arbitration.\n\nThe question is what holds true for arbitral tribunals that violate or fail to observe EU sanctions.\n\nPublic policy in EU law\n\nEven if public policy is a narrow exemption, EU law provides a gateway towards appealing arbitral awards on grounds of public policy:\n\nThe European Court of Justice ruled in the Eco Swiss (C-126/97), paragraph 36, in the context of EC competition law, that “Article 85 of the Treaty constitutes a fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market. The importance of such a provision led the framers of the Treaty to provide expressly, in Article 85(2) of the Treaty, that any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to that article are to be automatically void.” The European Court of Justice then stated in paragraph 39: “For the reasons stated in paragraph 36 above, the provisions of Article 85 of the Treaty may be regarded as a matter of public policy within the meaning of the New York Convention.”\n\nIn comparison, it is settled by law that contracts and transactions that are contrary to sanctions shall not be performed.\n\nFor instance, Regulation 833/2014 (i.e. the EU’s Russia sanctions), Article 11, seeks to protect EU operators from claims in connection with any contract or transaction the performance of which has been affected, directly or indirectly, by the sanctions against Russia. An EU operator terminating a contract for compliance reasons cannot be sued for non-performance and will not risk having to satisfy damage claims in connection with such contract (see also the European Commission’s FAQ no. 7 dated 24 May 2022).\n\nAnother example on sanctions is asset freezes.\n\nThe Council of the European Union has issued best practice guidelines updated on 27 June 2022 for the “effective implementation of restrictive measures”. Referring to paragraph 62 of the Judgment by the European Court of Justice in Möllendorf, C-117/06, the Council explains that EU sanctions “imposing freezing measures override all incompatible contractual arrangements” and “shall apply notwithstanding any rights conferred by or obligations provided for in any contract entered into before their entry into force and shall preclude the completion of acts which implement contracts concluded before the entry into force of the Regulations”.\n\nThe described effects mentioned in these examples seem tempting to compare with the effects of a contractual arrangement contrary to EU competition law, i.e. such contracts are detrimental to the proper functioning of the internal market and thus automatically null and void (see Eco Swiss, paragraph 36, quoted above).\n\nSanctions are critical tools of foreign and security policy adopted to promote peace, safety, stability, and prosperity. Sanctions are often specific (or at least they purport to be) in their aims, such as seeking to deter a hostile aggressor (such as Russia) from further financing of war. Sanctions are also frequently adopted as a result of serious human rights violations.\n\nBearing the Eco Swiss judgement in mind and depending on the specific circumstances, including an assessment of the nature of the sanctions that may have been breached by an arbitral tribunal, it remains to be seen whether the CJEU will issue a future judgement holding that violations of EU sanctions in an arbitral award would be contrary to public policy.\n\nIf EU sanctions are public policy – how will that play out in practice\n\nIn principle, a transaction cannot be both lawful and unlawful. If a transaction is contrary to competition law or to sanctions rules, the transaction will per se be unenforceable, and so will any arbitral award that fails to observe and apply EU competition law or EU sanctions (if we assume that EU sanctions constitute European public policy). In theory, at least, but in practice that is not how the law operates.\n\nLaw is an art, not a science, leaving considerable discretion to judges and arbitrators.\n\nTo exemplify, it has become obvious in the context of EU’s Russia sanctions that sanctions are often crafted with no clear boundaries. The Russia sanctions were crafted in a piecemeal manner with no inner logic and often made deliberately unclear in consequence of political compromise amongst the EU member states. Moreover, sanctions rules are broadly worded (e.g. it covers measures that “direct and indirect” affect a contract or transaction) to catch all situations and avoid sanctions circumvention. The inevitable result is lack of legislative clarity. I have too often found myself in doubt when advising a client seeking to know whether a given conduct amounts to violate EU sanctions.\n\nIt may be invoked that the way in which sanctions rules are crafted amounts to conferring a margin of error on the arbitrators. In any event, any future judgement by the CJEU applying the precedent in Eco Swiss with respect to sanctions will in practice only be relevant as ammunition to invalidate arbitral awards in the most egregious and clear-cut cases.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by recent case law from the Danish High Courts and the Supreme Court – see UfR 2016.1558/2H (Supreme Court Judgement dated 28 January 2016) and UfR 2022.3012Ø (Danish Eastern High Court’s Judgement dated 23 May 2022). In the said cases, the courts held that the conditions for setting aside an award pursuant to Section 37(2)(2)(b) of the Danish Arbitration Act were not met because the courts did not find that the arbitral tribunals in their application of EU competition law had committed egregious errors of law.\n\nThese cases remind me of the practice adopted by the English courts when dealing with appeals on errors of law. Section 69 of the English Arbitration Act provides that the English courts may set aside an English award on a question of law if the decision of the arbitral tribunal is obviously wrong.\n\nEven if sanctions are public policy – which in my opinion is likely to be the case – it does not change the fact that public policy is a narrow exemption that only will be applied if exceptional circumstances justify it.\n\nTo what extent are arbitrators bound by international sanctions? Are sanctions a barrier to enforcement of awards? And what role do arbitration institutes play in ensuring access to arbitral proceedings in sanctions-related cases? These were some of the questions raised during the CIArb European Branch Annual Conference held in Copenhagen last week.\n\nBy Sahra Arif, The Danish Institute of Arbitration\n\nThe impact of economic sanctions on international arbitration is not novel. Yet, the rapid and increasingly complex sanctions developments continue to cause unique legal and practical challenges for arbitration and creates a stronger need for clear principles and guidelines. For this reason, the Danish Institute of Arbitration was honored to participate in the CIArb European Branch Annual Conference and join the discussion on how parties, counsel, arbitrators and institutes can address these challenges and discuss potential solutions that can safeguard the access to efficient dispute resolution in a world increasingly impacted by diverging geopolitical developments.\n\nThe difficulty of applying sanctions\n\nThe Annual Conference hosted six panel discussions with esteemed speakers from across the European continent. Together, the panelists and moderators tackled the topic from all relevant angles. The conference kicked off discussing the applicability of various sanctions regimes that may be relevant to a given arbitration, e.g. sanctions that form part of the substantive law, the procedural law and the law in the place of enforcement. The role of sanctions as overriding mandatory provisions and “transnational” public policy was discussed with insightful questions and comments from the audience. With no clear consensus on general principles determining the applicability of various sanctions regimes, it is obvious that tribunals would need to consider this question on a case-by-case basis.\n\nChallenges for arbitrators\n\nAdditional challenges were highlighted in a panel dedicated to arbitrators and tribunals specifically. Here, a clear take-away was that arbitrators should not refuse appointments or step down at the first hint of sanctions. However, there is a need for a universal approach regarding arbitrators. In addition, some of the challenges arise not from sanctions regulation, but rather the response to sanctions regulation, such as international law firms refusing representation to sanctioned parties and overly restrictive approaches from banks complicating payments of fees. Tribunals should also not be expected to launch full-scale investigations into the sanctions status of a party, but should be able to rely – at least to a reasonable degree – on information provided by the parties.\n\nThe role of arbitration institutes in sanctions disputes\n\nThere was also an opportunity to discuss the role of arbitral institutes during a panel consisting of General Council of the ICC, Emmanuel Jolivet, Secretary-General of the DIA, Steffen Pihlblad, Secretary-General of the SCC, Caroline Falconer, and Deputy Chairman of the Board of DIS, Reinmar Wolff. During this panel, there was clear consensus that access to justice remains a cornerstone for the arbitration institutes.\n\nThis was illustrated by the persistent efforts by several arbitral institutes to ensure that there is a clear exemption in EU sanctions legislation for transactions necessary for arbitral proceedings, identical to the exemptions for legal proceedings at the state courts.\n\nAlthough sanctions were described as “a nightmare for institutes”, the institutes have adopted various solutions to ensure that sanctions do not hinder an efficient administration of arbitrations. These range from engaging with regulators and banks to obtain (general) licenses and help facilitate payments to other initiatives aimed at ensuring access and avoiding delays in sanctions-related disputes. As also noted by Secretary-General Steffen Pihlblad, it is a very strange situation if an institute can be required to refuse cases that parties have agreed should be administered by the institute. The message was clear that access to efficient administration of arbitral proceedings is access to justice. The role of arbitration institutes in disputes involving sanctions are also a perfect illustration of the unique way institutes can assist parties and tribunals, as these challenges only become more difficult to deal with in ad hoc arbitrations.\n\nResolving sanctions issues earlier in the disputes\n\nAs promised by the title of the conference, the conference also concluded with some encouraging takeaways. As international sanctions become more of a common reality in our globalized world, there are various ways to resolve sanctions-related challenges ahead of and during disputes.\n\nA panel focusing on sanctions and contracts highlighted that parties can and should deal up front with the realities of sanctions. Learning from global events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, parties can address how issues resulting from sanctions should be dealt with before a dispute arises. These options also apply to arbitration agreements, where parties can address possible issues relating more specifically to the arbitration procedure. These include careful considerations of what laws parties should opt for, addressing how to deal with a party becoming unable to pay for fees due to asset freezes, participating in hearings due to travel bans, and dealing with counsel, arbitrators or institutes becoming restricted due to sanctions. The contractual solutions could even extend to dealing up front with issues relating more specifically to enforcement of awards.\n\nEnforcement of awards and sanctions\n\nConcerning enforcement, the final panel was dedicated exclusively to the various issues and solutions that can arise once an award is obtained. One may ask what the use of an award is if assets are frozen and enforcement seems unlikely. Luckily, the panel was able to not only remind that sanctions-related issues at the enforcement stage are not new, but rather requires that enforcement is considered as early in the proceedings as possible, and even before an action is filed. A concern that an award which fails to take sanctions into account per se will be unenforceable on the grounds of public policy was carefully examined in a lively debate. The careful take-away from that discussion was that, although enforcement could be refused on the grounds of public policy, this would only apply under exceptional circumstances in narrow cases.\n\nArbitral awards, even in such cases, will of course still have a legal and economic value. Aside from creating binding legal clarity on the subject-matter of the parties’ dispute, the award may also prove valuable in settlement discussions, offer protection against counter-claims and subsequent actions, and reflects an economic value, allowing the award to be regarded as an asset in itself.\n\nEven in situations, where enforcement appears difficult at first glance, having an award still offers the successful party the immediate possibility to enforce it once such an opportunity arises. In addition, as enforcement challenges may only be present in certain jurisdictions, having an award could still allow the successful party to enforce it in other jurisdictions, as also seen in relation to awards rendered in intra-EU investment arbitrations post Achmea.\n\nThe panel also addressed raising sanctions as a defense at the enforcement stage, including whether parties in such cases would be at liberty to only raise such sanctions-defenses during challenge proceedings or if such defenses should already be raised at a earlier stage during the arbitral proceedings. Drawing on similarities in cases concerning EU competition law and cases involving corruption and fraud allegation, no clear conclusion can be drawn specifically for sanctions. The discussion, however, underscores the need to consider enforcement and challenges to enforcement at earlier stages of the dispute.\n\nFinal take-aways\n\nThe Annual Conference concluded with the clear message that sanctions do not mean the end of international arbitration but the rapid developments do require that international arbitration adapts to the new realities of the world. Sanctions pose unique legal and practical challenges that many are confronted with for the first time. As the current climate of sanctions and counter-measures unfortunately becomes more common, it is important that all parties participating in arbitral proceedings carefully consider how to mitigate the legal and practical challenges that come with sanctions to ensure that sanctions do not hinder access to justice.\n\nSanctions is the topic when the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb), European Branch, hosts its annual conference and AGM in Copenhagen this April. Questions are many. For example, how should arbitral institutions proceed when parties to a dispute are subject to sanctions? How should an arbitrator act when faced with sanctioned activities or entities? How do all involved parties uphold the principle of right to justice for all parties – sanctioned and non-sanctioned? The Danish initiator of the conference, Casper Gammelgaard, anticipates that fostering constructive debate will prove beneficial.\n\nWhy have you taken the initiative to bring the CIArb European Branch’s Annual Conference to Denmark?\n\nLast year, the annual conference and AGM were held in Venice. During this event, the management committee traditionally deliberates on the selection of the next conference venue within Europe. As a member of the management committee, I have been considering Denmark as a potential host for some time, and the timing now appears perfect.\n\nI have observed a notable rise in international recognition for the Danish arbitration environment, attributable in part to the emergence of a new generation of skilled arbitrators and the expanding global presence of the Danish Institute of Arbitration. Consequently, I saw it as a clear opportunity to bring the conference to Denmark. I advocated for Copenhagen as the ideal host city and swiftly garnered support for this proposal.\n\nHow big a player is CIArb in the arbitration market?\n\nIt’s a global and influential player with over 17,000 members from 149 countries. Headquartered in the UK, they have branches all over the world. CIArb educates and trains arbitrators, mediators and adjudicators in alternative dispute resolution, including in arbitration. I am also a graduate of the academy as I completed the course in International Arbitration in 2019 in England. Subsequently, I achieved the esteemed designation of Fellow, the highest level of recognition within CIArb and recognized as a mark of excellence in the field of international dispute resolution. Today I am also part of the CIArb, European Branch Management Committee.\n\nWhat issues will be discussed at the conference?\n\nThe topic of sanctions holds significant relevance in the current geopolitical landscape, particularly concerning cases involving sanctioned entities such as those from Russia or other affected parties. While conducting business with sanctioned entities is currently heavily restricted, there remains a pressing concern regarding ongoing cases within this context.\n\nAll involved parties must remain acutely aware of the legal landscape and there are often more questions than answers regarding the implications of sanctions on ongoing legal proceedings. The challenges posed by sanctions have far-reaching consequences on numerous international contracts and disputes, necessitating a collective effort to devise effective strategies for addressing them.\n\nInitially, I anticipated that securing approximately 20 top-notch speakers could pose a challenge. However, to my delight, the response from those I reached out to has been overwhelmingly positive. As a result, we have curated a list of 20 highly prominent speakers for our program, with approximately half of them being women. I find it imperative to emphasize this achievement as our goal was to assemble the most outstanding lineup of speakers possible.\n\nSubsequently, we assessed the diversity of our speaker lineup in terms of nationality, age, and gender. I am pleased to report that no adjustments to the list were necessary, showcasing the rapid evolution within international arbitration. Both the representation of women and younger individuals are steadily increasing, a trend I am proud to support and showcase at this year’s annual conference.\n\nAre there other benefits of attending the conference?\n\nCIArb conferences consistently draw an exclusive gathering of international arbitrators, institutions and other people involved in international arbitration, presenting a prime opportunity to broaden your professional network. To further facilitate this, we host an evening dinner where attendees have the chance to connect with colleagues from various corners of the globe in more relaxed surroundings.\n\nAre there still spaces available and how do I register?\n\nYes – there are still spaces available. The conference is open to both CIArb members and non-members.\n\nhttps://www.hjulmandkaptain.dk/viden/arrangementer/sanctions-in-international-arbitration/\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/sanctions-in-international-arbitration-registration-841443980597\n\nA number of Danish and international companies and organizations support the conference, including the Danish Institute of Arbitration and Dreyers Foundation. I also hope very much that the Danish arbitration community will support the conference and sign up for the conference.\n\nThe Green Pledge is an important tool for implementing sustainability in the arbitration process. This is the opinion of Henrik Nedergaard Thomsen from Neugebauer Clan, who works to spread the idea of sustainability in international arbitration through, among others, the Europe Committee of the Campaign for Greener Arbitration. The project was launched in May 2019 as a promise from a British international arbitrator who wanted to handle her cases with the environment in mind.\n\nWhy did you get involved in promoting sustainability through The Green Pledge?\n\nWe must all contribute to sustainability. I work primarily in litigation and arbitration and act as an arbitrator both in Denmark and internationally. The process around these cases is based on rules and traditions from a time when sustainability and climate impact were not a necessary part of the agenda. The Campaign for Greener Arbitrations asked me to join the European committee to raise awareness and understanding that sustainability should also be part of the arbitration process. I said yes for two reasons: On a societal level, it seemed meaningful to help put sustainability on the agenda. On a business level, it also made sense because the work processes, I follow as a lawyer or arbitrator also have an impact on the client’s or party’s own sustainability accounts.\n\nHow did The Green Pledge come about?\n\nThe Campaign for Greener Arbitrations began in May 2019 as a pledge from UK international arbitrator Lucy Greenwood that she would conduct her arbitrations with the environment in mind. She launched The Green Pledge with the aim of limiting her own environmental and climate impact in her work as an arbitrator. The Green Pledge raised awareness among more and more arbitrators around the world and spread to arbitration institutes, law firms, individual lawyers, other counsel, universities, professional arbitration associations and conference centers that host oral arbitration hearings. The Green Pledge now has six global working groups, eight regional committees and has spread to most of the world.\n\nWho can sign and who has signed up recently?\n\nThe Green Pledge is for anyone who wants to support sustainability in litigation and arbitration. It is not a requirement to make your sign-up visible, but the spirit of the campaign is to focus on sustainability as far as possible and relevant. So far, The Green Pledge has mainly been signed by arbitrators, arbitration institutes, law firms, individual lawyers, expert witnesses, universities, professional arbitration associations and conference centers that host oral arbitration proceedings. Among the Nordic arbitration institutes, the SCC Arbitration Institute in Stockholm and the Nordic Arbitration Center in Reykjavik have so far signed. At Neugebauer Clan, we signed The Green Pledge in March 2023.\n\nWhat’s in it for you?\n\nThe Green Pledge should be an integral part of your company’s sustainability policy. The Green Protocol, an operational tool, outlines what can and should be done as part of the implementation of the Green Pledge. It ranges from overall objectives for management to specific actions for all employees. This includes, for example, a focus on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, policies for online or on-site meetings, policies for transportation and choice of transportation, replacing office supplies with sustainable alternatives, the ability to work digitally and limit printing, and use suppliers who have a focus on sustainability themselves. It all aims to ensure that the company promotes and develops behaviors that support sustainability and limit climate impact wherever possible and relevant. What you get out of it depends entirely on how far you as a company want to go.\n\nHow do you sign?\n\nSigning the Green Pledge is done digitally. You click on the “Sign the Green Pledge” box on the front page of The Campaign for Greener Arbitrations’ website and from there you are guided through the signing process.\n\nWhat impact do you expect this initiative to have in the long term?\n\nThe Green Pledge is a dynamic tool to raise awareness and support sustainability in the arbitration process, and it will become a standard for what can and should be done in this area. Around the world, countries are setting targets for when they will be neutral and how they will limit CO2 through green change and climate adaptation. So do companies, either because the company is subject to a sustainability reporting requirement or because they are suppliers to a reporting company and through this collaboration will or must be able to meet the reporting company’s sustainability requirements. Through arbitration clauses, companies can be expected to want to ensure that they can opt out of arbitration institutions, arbitrators, venues for the oral hearing or others that do not meet their sustainability requirements or standards, so that the arbitration does not have a more negative impact on the company’s sustainability reporting than necessary. The Green Pledge will therefore be an important tool for implementing sustainability in the arbitration process.\n\nHenrik Nedergaard Thomsen\n\nLawyer and partner at Neugebauer Clan.\n\nRead more\n\nSigning of The Green Pledge and overview of the signatories:\n\nhttps://www.greenerarbitrations.com\n\nThe vast majority of cases in Norway are handled through ad hoc arbitration, write Andreas A. Johansen and Michael F. Decker from Advokatfirmaet Schødt in Oslo. They believe that, while ad hoc arbitration has its benefits, the Norwegian legal market would benefit substantially from building up a full-fledged arbitral institution akin to the DIA, the SCC, and other institutions who have contributed to the development of arbitration in their respective homes over the last decades.\n\nBy Partner Andreas A. Johansen and Managing Associate Michael F. Decker, Advokatfirmaet Schjødt, Oslo\n\nThe Nordic countries have a robust tradition for dispute resolution outside the ordinary courts, and for arbitration in particular. Recent statistics reflect that the leading institution in Denmark – The Danish Institute of Arbitration – averages well over 100 new cases per year, while the number for the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce is well over 150. The Finnish Arbitration Institute is not far off of these numbers. Compared amongst themselves, these caseloads roughly correspond to these countries’ respective economy sizes, with a longstanding and significant boost to Sweden’s arbitration docket coming from its well-known history as a neutral ground for resolution of disputes particularly between East and West. These Nordic arbitration institution caseloads are also respectable when compared with some of the leading institutions worldwide – for example, the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris administers close to a thousand cases per year, only a small multiple of the Nordic total, despite France alone having a GDP close to double the overall Nordic GDP and the despite the ICC’s dominant position internationally.\n\nNorway has an economy similar in size to its Nordic neighbors, with well-known areas of focus in oil & gas, shipbuilding, and aquaculture, among many others. And it has a history for arbitration that is strong in a manner comparable to Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. But Norway has long stood apart when it comes to institutional arbitration. While there are institutional presences in Norway – in particular the Oslo Chamber of Commerce (OCC) and ICC Norway – these institutions only administer a handful of cases each year. Reports from Norwegian Arbitration Day 2024 reflect that the OCC has administered between 1 and 8 new cases per year over the past few years. The ICC reports handling a similarly low number of cases with Norwegian law and/or Norwegian parties each year. The vast majority of such Norwegian cases are handled through ad hoc arbitration.\n\nAnd Norwegian arbitrations are often quite large. Disputes among oil & gas companies regularly lead to amounts in dispute reaching billions of Norwegian kroner. Disputes following from M&A transactions or arising in the maritime, shipping, life sciences, and construction industries, among others, can also be significant, with many new cases arising each year involving disputed amounts surpassing 100 million kroner. A variety of other cases, some of them smaller, come up each year. Most of these arbitration proceedings involved at least one non-Norwegian (and often a non-European) party.\n\nWith reference to the foregoing comparison of institutional caseloads, one basic challenge in even discussing this topic is simply counting the number of Norwegian arbitration cases. While Norwegian legislation requires that arbitration awards be archived with the national courts (see Voldgiftsloven, section 36, fifth paragraph), this requirement is only inconsistently adhered to. Informal estimates of caseload based on our discussions with practitioners and arbitrators, however, put the current numbers at 200+ cases per year.\n\nWhy ad hoc arbitration is preferred in Norway\n\nThe history and reasons behind Norway’s trend towards resolution of disputes through ad hoc rather than institutional arbitration is a frequent topic of discussion among practitioners in writing and at conferences. The consensus is that there are a number of interrelated reasons why ad hoc has remained the preferred mode of arbitration in Norway even as arbitrations in neighboring Nordic countries have as a rule been administered through firmly established local institutions. We address a few of these here.\n\nThe main background reason for the prevalence of ad hoc arbitration over institutional arbitration in Norway is that Norway has – even compared to its Nordic neighbors – a somewhat smaller and more tight-knit legal community, which historically has had great success in appointing arbitrators from a relatively small group of practitioners, academics, and judges from the ordinary courts. This trusting community is both underpinned and reinforced by societal-level trust: Norwegians are trusting of other individuals and of society as a whole – again, by some measures even more than their Nordic neighbors. Norwegian lawyers are also, at least by some, considered to be quite pragmatic when resolving disputes.\n\nA seeming separate consequence of this trust and pragmatism is that, even at present, Norwegian arbitration awards are seldom challenged – and, when challenged, rarely end up being annulled. Based on reporting shared at Norwegian Arbitration Day 2024, we are aware of only three Norwegian cases seeking annulment in 2023. The true finality of Norwegian arbitration awards seems to be an additional sort of success for the ad hoc arbitration system.\n\nAs an aside, another notable additional side effect of the levels of trust and ultimately collegiality in the Norwegian legal community is that, in contrast to the norm in most other countries around the world, appointment of panels typically occurs not according to the usual party-appointment procedure, but with the parties jointly agreeing upon all three (or occasionally two of three) panel members. This situation underscores the unusually high level of functioning in the Norwegian arbitration world.\n\nA second overall reason for the continued prevalence of ad hoc arbitration is that institutions are viewed by many with skepticism. Ad hoc arbitration users may be concerned about institutions introducing unnecessary complication into the arbitration process, and potentially also more expense. Ad hoc arbitrations are seen as safe and predictable, with well-known arbitrators adjudicating the disputes, and with chairpersons also taking on much of the role that would otherwise be handled by a secretariat.\n\nUltimately, inertia also plays a significant role. It is hard to drag people unwillingly away from a system that seems to work – but especially hard to succeed in converting members of a traditionally cautious profession, no matter where in the world they are based. One rarely faces criticism for sticking to the status quo rather than opting for a newer (even if perhaps better) way of doing things. Furthermore, measures which go in the right direction, but only partially solve the relevant problems – such as the rightly celebrated Nordic Offshore and Maritime Arbitration Association, discussed below – can ironically make it even harder to move further by relieving some of the overall pressure to implement changes. Right or wrong, then, significant force is needed to move in a new direction.\n\nThe problems with ad hoc arbitration in Norway\n\nOne consequence of the above considerations is that efforts to introduce institutional arbitration to the Norwegian legal community have not, at least not at present, been the success that many have hoped.\n\nYet there remain a number of problems with ad hoc arbitration in Norway, and corresponding advantages to institutional arbitration:\n\nDiversity of arbitrators: There seems to be something structural about ad hoc arbitration, as compared to institutional arbitration, which inhibits diversity among arbitral tribunals. The issue connects to the value of party autonomy, which ad hoc arbitration takes to an extreme. As mentioned, it is normal in Norwegian ad hoc arbitrations for parties (aided by their lawyers) to jointly appoint a panel of arbitrators. These arbitration users can tend to have a conservative streak, opting for the most traditional – including the most senior – presences in the arbitration community. As a potential panel is under discussion, lawyers may be reluctant to advocate for a younger, and thus also typically less experienced, arbitrator from their side. Such a move may allow for the opposing counsel to advocate for a very experienced arbitrator who will be presumed to “win” in a disagreement with the less experienced arbitrator. Or it may simply be considered a less predictable approach than opting for a seasoned veteran – which, considered in a vacuum, can hardly be criticized. Yet, this situation often leads to panels consisting exclusively of “safe choices”: conventional, very experienced arbitrators, which in Norway will most often mean men in their sixties or seventies. The unfortunate consequence is that diversity of virtually every kind is, if not expressly or deliberately rejected, then sidelined as collateral damage. This problem seems to repeat itself around the world when parties are the ones doing the appointing, even in institutional arbitrations – so it is likely fairest to conclude that this is a problem of party appointment more than an ad hoc problem or a Norwegian one.\n\nArbitral institutions, by contrast, can – and, the data shows, actively and successfully do – facilitate such change, in part because institutions often appoint a tribunal’s chairperson (or the sole arbitrator, as relevant). Data from various institutions seems to reflect, e.g., that, whatever the rate at which parties appoint women as arbitrators, the institutions appoint more. Based on our experiences and those of our colleagues at other law firms, the same goes for other axes of diversity that are worth encouraging.\n\nLack of transparency or predictability, the Black Box syndrome. Ad hoc arbitration in Norway is guided ultimately by Norway’s 2004 arbitration statute. This statute is in several regards only a bare-bones framework – notwithstanding e.g. the commentaries which flesh out some aspects of Norwegian arbitration procedure according to the law. Compared to the detailed and carefully considered rules of the institutions mentioned already, much is missing. One straightforward example is regarding fees. There is nothing in Norwegian law that states what fees an arbitrator shall be entitled to. The consequence is that, potentially problematically, each arbitral tribunal decides its own fees. Another example is regarding requests for access to evidence – as to which the governing statute does not comment. Here, historically, parties and arbitrators have looked to, variously, the Norwegian Civil Procedure Act, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, and other sources. In the absence of party agreement to adopt a ruleset in PO1, arbitrators tend to grasp at straws when looking for authority to guide their decision-making in this area because the law is silent on the matter. Users of arbitration under Norwegian law are generally agreed that this state of affairs is not ideal. The leading institutions, by contrast, have thorough and carefully-crafted rulesets to address these issues, among others, and resources including secretariats, boards, and advisory committees to ensure continued progress in relevant arenas related to promoting predictable arbitration procedures in line with the key values that are supposed to underpin any arbitration ruleset.\n\nMore attractive for foreign parties: While Norwegians, and perhaps Scandinavians in general, would have few problems with “trusting” a country’s ad hoc regime, this is less often the case for companies based elsewhere in the world. It is easier to “sell” parties on arbitration in a given country – for example Norway – if the arbitration is institutional rather than ad hoc. While it can be debated whether such considerations from foreign companies or lawyers are well-founded, their considerations are real and should be taken into account.\n\nThe pressure to remedy these and other issues is growing. Year by year, the legal Industry becomes more committed to remedying historic gender differences. In the last 10 years, institutions have made major strides in improving upon the proportion of women appointed as arbitrators. In 2022, the SCC announced having for the first time appointed more women than men as arbitrators in cases where appointing responsibility fell upon the institution itself. Other institutions are having – or are apparently on the way to – similar success stories. In recent years, discussion of case costs in the Norwegian legal community has risen more and more. While the sphere of arbitration is outside the typical focus of this discussion, we expect that pressure to guarantee predictable arbitrator fees will continue to grow.\n\nThe way forward\n\nWhat is to be done, then? Some have worked to establish a new Kalmar Union of sorts, but for arbitration. In 2017, a number of prominent actors in the Nordic arbitration community created the Nordic Offshore and Maritime Arbitration Association. NOMA has issued rulesets and more which have successfully lent more predictability to arbitration in the region, and in particular in Norway. Even when an arbitration agreement has made no mention of NOMA, counsel often encourage their clients to rely on NOMA’s texts, with the result that NOMA’s policies are voluntarily invoked jointly by the parties at the outset of an arbitration proceeding.\n\nAnd we, the authors, are supporters and users of NOMA, in particular for its detailed set of rules, best practice guidelines, CMC matrix, and so forth, which introduce a great measure of predictability into arbitrations that might otherwise lack it. Yet, at the same time, NOMA lacks some of the important functions of a fully fledged arbitral institution. And although the NOMA rules require a claimant to submit a copy of any notice of arbitration to NOMA for record-keeping purposes (see 2021 Rules, Art. 3.1), NOMA does not seem to report statistics on its cases.\n\nNorway continues to need, then, a true and full-fledged institution. It needs a secretariat with individuals whose daily work it is to market their institution as a place for disputes to be resolved. That secretariat needs to be able to appoint arbitrators and handle administrative tasks related to such appointments and to the further resolution of its cases. And they have to be present and market the institute, as the DIA, the SCC, and other institutions have done well over the last decades.\n\nOne reason that neither the OCC nor NOMA has had full institutional status is that an institution requires a serious investment of capital – both time and money – in addition to a sufficient case load. Yet, while meaningful investment is required to build out an institution, and while any institution will of course face challenges in bringing users to its doorstep, we believe that the time is right for such investment, and that it will pay off in the end – both for the institution that makes the investment and for Norwegian arbitration users. We will benefit from greater predictability, from greater arbitrator diversity, from an easier time marketing Norwegian arbitration to foreign users, and in countless other ways large and small.\n\nIn short, yes, the Danish courts are seen as pro-arbitration. Accordingly, one can be confident that if an arbitration is seated in Denmark, such as the main cities of Copenhagen and Aarhus, Danish courts will handle procedural questions with insight and support the finality of an arbitral award.\n\nBy Victoria Christine Schmidt, Assistant Attorney, Kromann Reumert and Morten Adler-Nissen, Director, Attorney, Kromann Reumert.\n\nA prime example of the pro-arbitration approach is a 2016 judgment from the Supreme Court, which sets out three points of principle. These three points prevail today, most recently in a Supreme Court case last year and a High Court case this year.\n\nThe prime example involved a setting aside request at the Supreme Court following a distribution agreement in the wind turbine industry (UfR 2016.1558/2H). The court did not grant the request and set out the three points while doing so:\n\ns.37 of the Danish Arbitration Act 2005 (the “Act”) contains an exhaustive statement of the circumstances that can justify setting aside an award as invalid\n\nthe courts cannot perform a substantive review of an award\n\nthe courts cannot set aside an award as invalid when the tribunal has applied incorrect law or misjudged the facts, unless there is such a serious failing by the arbitral tribunal that its award is manifestly incompatible with public policy (ordre public).\n\nRecent judgments confirm these pro-arbitration points of principle.\n\nIn a judgment of 17 January 2022, the Supreme Court (UfR 2022.1117 H) did not allow a setting aside request following purchase agreements concerning marine engines and propellors. The court curtailed due process concerns by finding that documents and witness examination can be restricted in cases where a procedural order, which the court held was within the legal framework set out in the Act and the relevant institutional rules, allowed such restriction.\n\nIn the case, the respondent had claimed, among other points, that it was: a) denied the ability to submit relevant documents, including an expert report and correspondence; and b) restricted as regards witness examination and the document production process (Danish: edition). The respondent accordingly pleaded that the arbitral award should be set aside because the procedure was not in accordance with the parties’ agreement or the Act, and because the party was not able to present its case.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court, in a pro-arbitration judgment, found that the Act, the relevant institutional rules and procedural order did not prevent the tribunal’s actions. Moreover, in doing so the judgment also restated two of the 2016 ruling’s points, namely that s.37 of the Act is exhaustive and that courts cannot perform a substantive review of the award.\n\nEarlier this year, the Western High Court, in an unpublished decision of 27 April 2023, (BS-25011/2022-VLR), again did not grant a setting aside request. The court did not find a breach of equal treatment when one party participated virtually and another party participated physically at a hearing. See discussion of this case in two previous DIA newsletters below (both in Danish), which discuss virtual hearings and the oral hearing requirement at s.24 of the Act.\n\nThe case concerned Norwegian and Danish parties, and a hearing in Denmark during the covid pandemic. The Norwegian party claimed, among other points, that its party representatives were only able to participate in the hearing virtually while the other party’s representatives participated physically. Accordingly, the Norwegian party pleaded that the award should be partially set aside owing to a breach of s.18 of the Act, which provides for equal treatment and a full opportunity to present one’s case.\n\nHowever, the court did not find a breach of s.18 of the Act and, like the Supreme Court above, did not set aside the award in a pro-arbitration judgment.\n\nThe judgment noted that the Norwegian party had originally agreed for its Norwegian representatives to attend physically but had later changed its mind. The judgment further noted that the covid travel restrictions had not been altered in the time between the Norwegian party’s original agreement and its change of position. The judgment also noted that the Norwegian party was able to attend the hearing physically and safely within the applicable covid guidelines. Moreover, the judgment again confirmed two points from the 2016 ruling, i.e. that courts cannot perform a substantive review of an award and that an award can only be set aside as invalid owing to incorrect law or misjudged facts, in extraordinary cases where there is a manifest contradiction with public policy (ordre public).\n\nThese two recent cases highlight the Danish courts’ continued pro-arbitration stance, as exemplified by the 2016 judgment and its three points of principle. This stance provides confidence to practitioners when Denmark is given as the seat of arbitration.\n\nVictoria Christine Schmidt\n\nAssistant Attorney, Kromann Reumert.\n\nMorten Adler-Nissen\n\nDirector, Attorney, Kromann Reumert.\n\nRead more:\n\nRediger Nyhed “Første danske dom om virtuel mundtlig forhandling” ‹ Voldgiftsinstituttet — WordPress\n\nRediger Nyhed “Virtuel forhandling uden procesrisiko” ‹ Voldgiftsinstituttet — WordPress\n\nThe hot and important topic of dynamics and diversity in arbitration panels was illuminated and debated at a seminar on 8 November arranged in collaboration between The Danish Arbitration Association and Young Arbitrators Copenhagen. Take-aways from the seminar by the tree arbitrators Lotte Wetterling, Gisela Knuts and Lotte Calundann Noer.\n\nDiversity of arbitrator appointments has been a major topic over the last few years. Diversity has been promoted in the arbitration community with a lot of different initiatives, including the Equal Representation in Arbitration Pledge, which has reached more than 5.000 signatories since 2015. Discussion has mainly revolved around gender diversity, but also around diversity as regards age, ethnical minority background, etc.\n\nThe event was kicked off by Daniel Haue Jakobsson from the host law firm Accura, who presented a recent diversity survey conducted by the event organizers with participation from 100+ members of the arbitration community in Denmark. Not surprisingly the survey showed that experience and competence are considered important factors, when an arbitrator is to be appointed. Gender and ethnicity scored low as relevant criteria and that probably showcased one of the difficult things when trying to advance diversity in arbitration: Gender, age, ethnicity and other diversity criteria might not in itself be important for the specific appointment, however these criteria are important if we want to secure that the pool of arbitrators becomes more representative for society in general and include all those individuals who has the skills.\n\nGuest speaker Liz Kantor, thought leader in the global arbitration practice of Herbert Smith Freehills in London, gave an inspirational speech on diversity and the challenges and developments in recent years from an international perspective under the title “Progress Made and Challenges Faced”. Liz explained that diversity of thought on a tribunal enhances the quality of the decision making because multiple perspectives are represented. A diverse panel of arbitrators is more likely to bring multiple perspectives to the table and avoid group think. Liz emphasized that a lot of progress has been made, and that the arbitration community cannot solve the whole problem by itself, on the other hand, there is still work to be done, especially when it comes to party appointments of arbitrators.\n\nOne major recent progress is that there is an increasing awareness among arbitration institutions on the need of documentation and statistics on the appointments of arbitrators according to diversity criteria. This has led to important transparency in the field and thus also a better factual basis for the debate about the actual status and the room for improvement.\n\nDiversity in Arbitration is also Driven by Clients\n\nThe speech by Liz Kantor was followed by a panel debate with arbitrators Gisela Knuts, Lotte Wetterling, Jacob Møller Dirksen and Peter Schradieck and moderated by Lotte Calundann Noer. The debate touched upon the important questions on how to choose the best arbitrator for a given case and how it is possible to promote diversity and advance the clients best interest at the same time.\n\nLawyers should be aware, that the agenda of diversity in arbitration panels is not only driven by lawyers, arbitrators and arbitration institutions themselves, but also, and probably especially, by clients and in-house counsels who – like society in general – also have agendas on diversity and ESG, etc. In fact, it might be the most appropriate approach to compose a list with suggestions for a client, who is to appoint an arbitrator, which includes both a couple of traditional candidates but also some candidates with a more diverse profile. There are many good arbitrators of different backgrounds out there, and we should remember to keep our eyes open to them.\n\nIf you want your client to consider appointing a diverse arbitrator, remember to include more than one diverse candidate on your list. This increases the likelihood of a diverse arbitrator being selected. This of course follows from basic arithmetics. But also: if there’s only one female/young/ethnically diverse candidate, that person will easily be perceived as a token candidate, and not considered seriously. A list with multiple diverse candidates signals they are candidates at par with the rest.\n\nThe rest is up to all of us, the progress we make is the sum of each and every decision on appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nLotte Wetterling\n\nIndependent Arbitrator, Copenhagen\n\nGisela Knuts\n\nIndependent Arbitrator, Helsinki.\n\nLotte Calundann Noer\n\nAttorney, Punct Advokater, Copenhagen.\n\nThe Norwegian Supreme Court recently handed down a ruling which confirms that a party who wishes to invoke an arbitration agreement must do so not later than when submitting its first statement of the substance of the dispute. The ruling entails a strict approach which may also be relevant for the interpretation of the Danish Arbitration Act, writes Knud Jacob Knudsen, Partner and Head of International Arbitration at Simonsen Vogt Wiig, Oslo.\n\nThe case involved a Danish and a Norwegian party who had entered into a distribution agreement for hair products. Pursuant to the agreement, disputes were to be resolved by arbitration in Denmark. The Danish company alleged that the Norwegian company had breached the Norwegian Marketing Act by producing and distributing products similar or identical to the Danish company’s products.\n\nThe Danish company filed a claim for damages before the regular courts, in this case the local conciliation board (Norwegian: forliksrådet). The latter is a court of first instance in many Norwegian cases, particularly in small matters where parties are not represented by counsel. The Danish company did not initiate arbitration proceedings because it was of the opinion that the violations of the Marketing Act were not covered by the arbitration clause in the distribution agreement.\n\nIn its defence to the claim, the respondent requested the conciliation board to discontinue the case as it raised complicated substantive and procedural issues, but the respondent did not specifically invoke the arbitration agreement.\n\nThe Norwegian Arbitration Act (NAA) Section 7 first-subsection states that the courts shall dismiss an action that is the subject of arbitration if a party so requests no later than in its first submission on the merits of the dispute.\n\nThe pertinent part of Section 7 has the following wording:\n\n“The courts shall dismiss an action that is the subject of arbitration if a party so requests no later than in his first submission on the merits of the dispute.”\n\nThe provision is based on Article 8 (1) of the Model Law, which reads:\n\n“A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.”\n\nA similar provision can be found in the Danish Arbitration Act Section 8, first sub-section, where the relevant part reads:\n\n“A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.”\n\nThe disputed issues\n\nThe questions before the Supreme Court were (i) whether the Section 7 of the NAA requires that a party must explicitly refer to the arbitration clause as the basis for dismissal, and (ii) whether or not the respondent, by requesting the conciliation board to discontinue the case, had submitted its views on the merits of the dispute.\n\nThe ruling\n\nThe Supreme Court found that Section 7 of the NAA requires that a party must specifically demand that a case is dismissed or discontinued on the basis of the arbitration agreement. It is not sufficient to demand dismissal due to other unspecified procedural issues.\n\nIn its reasoning, the Court emphasized that Section 7 was based on Article 8 of the Model Law, and that consistent international application of the Model Law suggested that the NAA should be interpreted in the same way as the Model Law. Further to this, the Court stated that the wording of Article 8, which provides that a party must “request” that the court “refer the parties to arbitration”, indicated that it was not sufficient to demand that the case be dismissed due to unspecified procedural reasons.\n\nThe Court also found that the Norwegian party had submitted its views on the merits of the dispute by requesting that the case be discontinued. In the Court’s view, it was not necessary that the party had provided any explanation for its position. In its reasoning on this point, the Court stated that there did not appear to be a consistent international practice with regard to the interpretation of the wording “his first statement on the substance of the dispute” in Article 8.\n\nThe ruling from the Supreme Court can be accessed here. The key paragraphs are 35, 46 and 61.\n\nSome perspectives\n\nEven though the facts of the case pertain to a matter before a conciliation board, the same principles will apply to cases before the regular courts. In other words, a respondent in a court case will need to specifically invoke the arbitration clause in its statement of defence if it wishes to resolve the matter through arbitration.\n\nThe decision is consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling in a previous case in Rt-2008-1623, which the Court also referred to. In the former case, a party had not filed a written defence but had attended the meeting of the conciliation board and generally requested that the case be dismissed, without invoking the arbitration clause in the agreement. The recent ruling from the Supreme Court is therefore not surprising, though it should be pointed out that the ruling from 2008 has been criticized, among others by current Supreme Court Justice Borgar Høgetveit Berg in his article Voldgiftslova § 7. Særleg om fristen for å krevje søksmål for domstolane avvist på grunn av voldgift, Avtalt prosess (2015). The Supreme Court noted the criticism, but pointed out that Justice Berg agreed on the correct understanding of the NAA de lega lata.\n\nThe ruling underlines the importance of double-checking the dispute resolution clause in the parties’ contract before submitting a defence in a court case. Even though the Danish company in the matter at hand had legitimate reasons for bringing the case before the regular courts, the principles in the Supreme Court’s ruling will also apply to parties who simply choose to disregard an arbitration clause in the parties’ contract.\n\nThe strict interpretation could prove to be a pitfall not only for parties who are not represented by counsel, which is often the case in matters before the conciliation boards, but also for counsel who fail to scrutinize the dispute resolution clause in the parties’ contract before submitting a statement of defence.\n\nThe ruling contains several references to Article 8 of the Model Law, and may therefore be of interest to practitioners in Denmark and other countries where the arbitration act is based on the Model Law.\n\nKnud Jacob Knudsen\n\nPartner and Head of International Arbitration at Simonsen Vogt Wiig, Oslo\n\nRead more\n\nhr-2023-2055-a.pdf (domstol.no)\n\nThere were in many ways room for lofty ideas and thoughts at Børsen when Copenhagen Arbitration Day 2023 took place on 5 October. On behalf of the Danish Institute of Arbitration and ICC Denmark, Secretary General of ICC Denmark, Brian Mikkelsen, opened the conference emphasising that the business community needs arbitration as conflicts in the business community are going to increase in the future.\n\n“Right now, arbitration is more important than ever. The need for independent and impartial dispute resolution is rising. One reason is of course, that in many countries – Denmark included – the state courts are overburdened. It drains the energy out of the businesses and make it impossible to get on with business plans and objectives. Here, arbitration represents a way to get back on track.”\n\nThese were the words from Brian Mikkelsen, Secretary General of ICC-Denmark on Thursday, where he opened Copenhagen Arbitration Day 2023 to more than 200 participants in outstanding surroundings at the Old Stock Exchange, which King Christian IV built from 1618 to 1624. The Exchange arguably formed the basis for Copenhagen as a trading centre and metropolis.\n\n“But this is far from the only reason why arbitration is so important. The business landscape becomes more and more interconnected. Thereby, the potential for disputes and conflicts grows,” he continued.\n\n”In that way, arbitration also provides a safety net for businesses and gives leaders courage to push their businesses even further,” he emphasised.\n\nPeter Arnt Nielsen, professor at Copenhagen Business School focused in the beginning of his speech on the history of arbitration, starting with the King Christian V who developed both Danish and Norwegian Law, and the vision for years to come.\n\n”The present Danish Arbitration Act was adopted in 2005 and is in line with UNCITRAL’s Model Law from 1985. An initiative to revise the act should be taken soon. Otherwise, Denmark may lag behind in the competitive world of international commercial arbitration where States constantly improve their legislation on arbitration,” he said.\n\nIndependent Arbitrator Mika Savola moved to the central topic of procedural order no. 1 (PO1).\n\nMr. Savola set out the procedural order’s sources such as UNCITRAL Notes on Organizing Arbitral Proceedings (1996, 2016), ICCA Drafting Sourcebook for Logistical Matters in Procedural Orders (2015) and other PO1s in previous arbitrations. He highlighted the PO1’s key goals of ensuring equal treatment of the parties, affording each party a reasonable opportunity to present its case and avoiding unnecessary costs and delay. He also considered the potential issues of increased costs and psychological bias if implementing new case management paradigms, e.g. mid-stream case review conferences and Reed Retreats.\n\nIn a panel debate between attorney Henriette Gernaa, Gorrissen Federspiel, attorney Friedrich Rosenfeld, Hanefeld in Hamburg, and Giuditta Codero-Moss, Professor at Oslo University, which was elegantly moderated by attorney Mathias Steinø, Hafnia, there was a sharp focus on how to strike the right balance between efficiency and due process and to what extent due process is a limit to the arbitral tribunal’s discretion.\n\nIn her speech, Giuditta Codero-Moss underlined that party autonomy itself does not necessarily mean that the tribunal has to accept all of the parties’ wishes.\n\n“Party autonomy is crucial in arbitration. The process is basically controlled by the parties, who choose to bring the dispute to arbitration. They choose the venue for the arbitration, the composition of the arbitral tribunal, and the scope of the arbitral tribunal’s powers. With their pleadings, they determine the factual limits of the dispute and the remedies that the tribunal may order. The arbitral tribunal may not exceed the power that the parties granted it. However, the arbitral tribunal has the power to evaluate the parties’ pleadings, and it can independently develop a legal reasoning. Sometimes, this may be necessary to ensure that the award is valid and enforceable – for example, the arbitral tribunal may find it necessary to raise issues of competition law, or to evaluate whether an award would infringe rules on corruption or money laundering. At the same time, to ensure that the award is valid and enforceable, the arbitral tribunal needs to strike a balance between party autonomy and its own independent evaluation of the parties’ pleadings. The parties should not be taken by surprise by the arbitral tribunal’s independent reasoning, and they should be given the possibility to present their case and to comment on the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is possible for the arbitral tribunal to have a certain independence from the parties’ pleadings, while at the same time safeguarding party autonomy.”\n\nAfter the day’s presentations and debates, Codero-Moss paid special attention to the fact that the professional level at the conference was very high and that there were good points to bring back to Oslo.\n\n“For me, it was interesting to learn that the plans to reform Danish arbitration law"
