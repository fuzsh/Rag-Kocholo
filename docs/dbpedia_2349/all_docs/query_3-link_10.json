        "text": "You would enter such items as “Book Section” and enter both the chapter and book titles, as well as both the authors and editors.\n\nThank you.\n\nI was thinking one-click solutions using plugins, etc.\n\nNow, in the way you just explained it, would I have to \"start again\" (that is, enter chapter and book titles and the authors and editors info) if I want to cite another chapter/section of the book?\n\nThe Zutilo plugin adds an option to the right click menu to streamline the process of making Book Section items from a Book item.\n\nThe general solution is to use the ISBN and convert to a book chapter, which requires minimal manual changes (adding title, chapter author and pages). A more specific solution that works for some publishers is using the DOI for a chapter if available, from the publisher's website (and if the publisher formats everything correctly, so it's actually less work than just converting from ISBN)."
