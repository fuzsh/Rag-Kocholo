As part of the Summer Reading Challenge for 2023, SBPL is offering an Essay Book Club using concepts from Elaine Castillo's How to Read Now as a framework for exploring the politics and ethics of reading and inviting readers to engage more deeply, not just with our fiction and our art, but with our buried and entangled histories.\n\nThe series includes three books of essays set in or about California and begins with a discussion of How to Read Now, followed by an exploration of Joan Didion's The White Album in July and José Vadi's Inter State: Essay on California in August. The Essay Book Club will meet on fourth Thursdays this summer, and participants are encouraged to attend all three meetings.\n\nComplimentary copies of The White Album will be available while supplies last to those who register for the Essay Book Club. The title is also available as an ebook and digital audiobook and in the Library's regular collection."
