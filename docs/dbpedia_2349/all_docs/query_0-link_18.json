        "text": "Er det nok at gøre dannelse bæredygtig?\n\nposted in: Jeppe på dansk |\n\nDe udfordringer, den globale systemkrise har bragt med sig, berører alle dele af vores liv og fællesskaber. Derfor skal vi forholde os til dem på alle niveauer: politisk, økonomisk, socialt, teknologisk, eksistentielt og spirituelt. Det har selvsagt store konsekvenser for den måde, vi tænker og udøver dannelse på både i og uden for højskolen. Fremkomsten af den globale systemkrise er i sig selv et tegn på, at den dannelsestænkning og -praksis, der har præget industrialiserede samfund, er mangelfuld. Klimaforandringerne er ikke bare en række socio-tekniske problemer, vi skal løse, de er en konsekvens af den måde, vi som moderne mennesker har tænkt om verden og været i verden på.

Tilbage i efteråret 2019 … Continued\n\nFortællingen om livet\n\nposted in: Jeppe på dansk |\n\nI højskolen synger vi ofte om livet som en manifestation af lyset.
