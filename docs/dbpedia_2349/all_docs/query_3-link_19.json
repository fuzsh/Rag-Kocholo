        "text": "A few months ago, I had visited the book fair. I was in a crowded stall, sifting through some books when my gaze landed on the title: ‘This is the Story of a Happy Marriage.’ Under the blaring lights and amidst the rowdy crowd, the title and the bluish-white cover with a thin blue border didn’t stand out.\n\nUsually, books with similar titles are placed together. At least four or five of them are always lying nearby. However, occasionally there’s that solitary book that looks mercilessly out of place amongst a bunch of similar ones. And this was that. The author’s name caught my attention, however. Ann Patchett. I had read one of her novels called ‘The Dutch House.’ It was an engaging and beautifully written story about two siblings living in a grand house. I liked that book. And it was popular. That is to be expected since Ann Patchett is a popular novelist. I have come across some of her other popular titles before, but haven’t read them. At least I have heard about them though, which was not so in this case. This book of hers was unfamiliar to me. And it was an essay collection. I thought she only wrote novels.\n\nWhen I picked up the book and skimmed through the pages, a line or two caught my attention. Sometimes, one isn’t sure whether they would like a book no matter how popular it is. And in some cases one takes a long time to get acquainted with it, and has to go through the initial phase of disinterest before they come across a page that finally gets their attention. But there are times when from the first page itself one knows that they would like the book. However, in certain rare cases, one is drawn to a book even before reading it. There’s an instant connection.\n\nThis book felt like that. I was sure I would like it even before turning the first page and knowing anything about it. But I put it back on the shelf. There were other books to read. My To-be-read pile was full. I walked away while paying it a last glance. It looked trapped and cornered, morose even. Maybe another time.\n\nThe next day brought in a new urgency. I needed the book. And I ordered it without a second thought. And I am glad the book came my way. After having read it, I can say with clarity that it was a worthy read.\n\nAbout The Book\n\n‘This is the story of a happy marriage’, starts with a humble introduction from the author talking about how this collection of essays came through when in fact she was predominantly a novelist. She had been a freelance article writer before and had written dozens of articles for magazines. A fact that was unknown to me. Hence apart from being a good novelist she also had an upper hand in writing crisp and interesting essays.\n\nThe ones in this book have been published before. They are all personal essays dwelling on a wide range of topics like writing, love, friendship, marriage, death, jobs, family, books, travel — overall a collection of varied experiences and snippets from Ann’s life. The title of the book might make it seem as if it deals with marriage. But that is the only essay in which the author’s marriage has been extensively discussed and the one from which the book has derived the title. There are other essays to consider, which in my opinion have been more engaging and have become the basis of my reason for liking the book. And I will get to those later.\n\nVaried Reasons To Like This Book\n\nThere’s something about personal stories. If written well, readers can connect to them deeply. Because people go through the same kind of experiences. They have similar thoughts and emotions. And when one comes across these similarities in stories, they are drawn to them at an instant, and can access a bit of comfort from the written words, or feel understood even. And Ann has written the essays well enough to keep them relatable and interesting. One can go through these and not feel bored. She has that novelist approach of writing essays. Having written successful fictional stories for decades, she knows how to tell the real-life ones as well.\n\nAnd her writing isn’t complicated. It isn’t too plain even. There’s a moderate use of similes and metaphors. She writes in a way that people can understand. At the same time the writing carries a lot of nuance. She takes the reader on by surprise. The essays are, in themselves, an element of surprise. Because the author has a knack of writing sentences or stating an opinion or fact that makes one pause and reflect. There were essays I wasn’t sure I would like initially, and then they too had surprised me at the end.\n\nAnd in addition to the simplicity and directness, the writing has a personality. The author has a distinctive voice that’s reflected well in the phrases. One can almost hear her speak. It’s the voice of a friend who’s telling us stories about her life. Not just stories centred around day-to-day happenings, but stories of a profound nature, that are raw, honest and vulnerable, and holds a directness as well as a humility. Yes, Ann’s voice carries a humility and warmth. Not once did I get a hint of smugness.\n\nPretentiousness can easily creep into writing, especially the kind of writing that involves one’s own life. But here, she was not overtly trying to prove anything even when she was accounting some of the most vulnerable details about her life. She was only stating certain things, and what she felt about them without trying to impose her understanding on the reader. And that’s the nature of writing I like — an assertiveness sans the pretentiousness.\n\nNow Coming to My Favourite Essays. Almost All of Them Are an Interesting Bunch\n\nThere’s one called ‘The Getaway Car’ where she extensively talks about her life as a writer. It is always interesting to read about other people’s writing life. The life of a writer. This whole phrase induces so much curiosity. Especially for the ones interested in books and writing. It is even more exciting to read about the successful writers. And success would definitely be on the side of a person who’s so determined early on to achieve a particular thing. She is one of those authors who knew from the start that she wanted to be a writer. She has been clear about that goal. Always. Sometimes even when we know that we have a passion for something, we get swayed in all directions and get distracted by the options. It was not so in her case.\n\nAnd there is so much interesting writing advice to pick up from this one essay of hers. She mentions how different both her careers as a freelance article writer and a novelist have been. She talks about the redundancy of costly literature degrees like MFA and why everyone else is better off not doing those. She talks about her struggles of earning money in the initial days because creative writing, like that of a fiction writer or novelist, doesn’t always bring one enough money. Which is why she had to stick to writing for magazines for so long before she had a breakthrough in her novel writing career. These are some interesting facts to learn. Here’s a quote that summarizes how she feels about being able to make up her own stories as a novelist:\n\n“What I like about the job of being a novelist, and at the same time what I find so exhausting about it, is that it’s the closest thing to being God you’re ever going to get. All the decisions are yours. You decide when the sun comes up. You decide who gets to fall in love and who gets hit by a car. You have to make all the trees and all the leaves and then sew the leaves onto the trees. You make the entire world.”\n\nThere is another essay called ‘The wall’, about which I wasn’t sure at first, and then it surprised me significantly in a good way. She attempts to join the police academy in this one. But she only wants to do that because she wants to write a novel revolving around cops. The passion she has for stories and the extent to which she is willing to go through to write one! And the academy is a different world altogether. Glad to read about that.\n\nThere is an essay dedicated to short stories. As a writer herself, she has a good understanding about the variations in creative writing. One of the misunderstood niches in creative writing is ‘short story writing’, because often it is thought of as a story that is short in length. But it’s not just the length of the story that gives it the name. There are so many elements and aspects that are specific to short stories. And I am glad how Ann Patchett, being a novelist, understands the beauty of this form of writing and goes on to describe how different they are from a novel. A short story isn’t supposed to be a prelude to a novel, she says. They are complete individual entities, with a life of their own.\n\nShe has portrayed her Grandma in one of her essays — the lady who lived beyond her nineties. Again, at first this essay didn’t feel like it would amount to much. But once I started reading it, I was saddened to witness how complicated certain circumstances were and how much Ann and her Grandma had to go through. She has described this well and also expressed the complex emotions that arise in relationships, the ones that can only be felt. I hadn’t expected it to be emotional. But it was irrevocably so, especially towards the end. A beautiful and touching quote summarizes this story:\n\n‘There are always those perfect times with the people we love, those moments of joy and equality that sustain us later on…These moments are the foundation upon which we build the house that will shelter us into our final years, so that when love calls out, “How far would you go for me?” you can look it in the eye and say truthfully, “Farther than you would ever have thought was possible.”’\n\nTalking about emotional stuff, there’s an essay called ‘Fact vs Fiction’ that talks about her dead friend. It’s about her friend and also more than that. Again, not many would be able to describe a friendship so well, especially a person who’s quite different than oneself. A person who seems to be larger than life.\n\nThere are again many more essays revolving around bookstores, pets, operas, road journeys etc. There are innumerable good lines in each one of them. But there are the essays that stick, whose story one would remember for a long time. I have talked about the ones that have been memorable for me. But for someone else they might like a different essay better. There’s something for everyone though. That’s the best part. And Ann’s life is worth reading about.\n\nEnd Note\n\nFor the one who is fond of essays, especially personal stories this would be a treat. And for the one who loves stories, this would be equally good. There’s always a story in essays as such. The writing is simple yet attention-demanding. It’s beautiful sans the complications. It’s easy-going yet emotional in places. To be more specific, the tone of each essay is different. It might be cheerful or sad, serious or casual depending on what is being talked about, or the phase of Ann’s life that has been emphasised. But no matter the topic or the emotions it relays, there are surprises at every turn, and there are noteworthy sentences everywhere. One would be able to connect to these essays from the comfort of their home and find a friend who’s willing to tell them some interesting as well as mundane stuff in the most engaging manner possible."
