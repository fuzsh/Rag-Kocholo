        "text": "I. Bibliographic Information\n\nProvide the essential information about each book using the writing style asked for by your professor [e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.]. Depending on how your professor wants you to organize your review, the bibliographic information represents the heading of your review. In general, they would be arranged alphabetically by title and look like this:\n\nRacing the Storm: Racial Implications and Lessons Learned from Hurricane Katrina. Hillary Potter, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007. 320 pp)\n\nThe Sociology of Katrina: Perspectives on a Modern Catastrophe. David L. Brunsma, David Overfelt, and J. Steven Picou, eds. (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2007. 288 pp.)\n\nThrough the Eye of Katrina: Social Justice in the United States. Kristin A. Bates and Richelle S. Swan, eds. (Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2007. 440 pp.)\n\nReviewed by [your full name]\n\nII. Thesis Statement\n\nThe thesis statement of an essay that compares and contrasts multiple works should contain an idea or claim that unites the discussion of each text under review. It should include the argument that will be advanced in support of the claims being made. To begin, ask yourself: What is the overarching subject or issue that ties together all of the books? Why is it important? In most scholarly works, the author(s) will state the purpose of their book in the preface or in an introductory chapter. Look for common themes or points of divergence among the books.\n\nIf you cannot find an adequate statement in the author's own words or if you find that the thesis statement is not well-developed, then you will have to compose your own introductory thesis statement that does cover all the material. The comparative thesis statement will vary in length depending on the number and complexity of the books under review. Regardless of length, it must be succinct, accurate, unbiased, and clear.\n\nIf you find it difficult to discern the overall aims and objectives of each book [and, be sure to point this out in your review if you believe it to be a deficiency], you may arrive at an understanding of the purpose by asking yourself a the following questions:\n\nScan the table of contents because it can help you understand how the book is organized and will aid in determining the author's main ideas and how they are developed [e.g., chronologically, topically, historically, etc.].\n\nWhy did the authors write on this subject rather than on some other subject?\n\nFrom what point of view is each work written?\n\nWere the authors trying to provide information, to explain something technical, or to convince the reader of a belief’s validity by dramatizing it in action?\n\nWhat is the general field or genre, and how does each book fit into it? If necessary, review related literature from other books and journal articles to familiarize yourself with the field.\n\nWho is the intended audience for each book? Is it the same or are the books intended for difference sets of readers?\n\nWhat is each author's style? Is it formal or informal? You can evaluate the quality of the writing style by noting some of the following standards: coherence, clarity, originality, forcefulness, accurate use of technical words, conciseness, fullness of development, and fluidity.\n\nHow did the books affect you? Were any prior assumptions you had on the subject that were changed, abandoned, or reinforced after reading the books? How are the books related to your own personal beliefs or assumptions? What personal experiences have you had that relate to the subject?\n\nHow well has each book achieved the goal(s) set forth in the preface, introduction, and/or foreword?\n\nWould you recommend this book to others? Why or why not?\n\nA useful strategy to help organize your thoughts is to create a table with a column for each book and rows for each question. Enter your answer to each book in the chart. When completed, you'll have an easy guide to how each author has addressed the questions.\n\nNOTE: Your thesis statement underpins the purpose of your review and helps the reader understand how the books are related. However, while a book review essay should evaluate books about the same topic [e.g., hurricane Katrina recovery], there may not be an overarching issue that ties the books together. If this is the case, then the thesis could, for example, center around the diversity of issues scholars have chosen to examine a topic or the fractured nature of scholarship on the subject.\n\nANOTHER NOTE: Your thesis statement should include the rationale for why the key points you highlight or compare and contrast among the books being reviewed were deliberate and meaningful and not random. Explain their significance.\n\nIII. Methods of Organizing the Essay\n\nOrganization is critical to writing an essay that compares and contrasts multiple works because you will most likely be discussing a variety of evidence and you must be certain that the logic and narrative flow of your paper can be understood by the reader. Here are some general guidelines to consider:\n\nIf your professor asks you to choose the books to review, identify works that are closely related in some way so they can be easily compared or contrasted.\n\nCompare according to a single organizing idea [e.g., analysis of how each author assessed the effectiveness of post-Katrina recovery efforts].\n\nChoose a method of development [see below] that works well with your organizing idea.\n\nUse specific and relevant examples to support your analysis.\n\nUse transitional words or phrases to help the reader understand the similarities and differences in your subject.\n\nConclude your paper by restating your thesis, summarizing the main points, and giving the reader a final \"so what\" answer to the major similarities and/or differences that you discussed [i.e., why are they important?\n\nThere are two general methods of organizing your multiple book review essay. If you believe one work extends another, you'll probably use the block method; if you find that two or more works are essentially engaged in a debate or examine a topic from different perspectives, the point-by-point method will help draw attention to the conflict. However, the point-by-point method can come off as a rhetorical ping-pong match. You can avoid this effect by grouping more than one point together, thereby cutting down on the number of times you alternate from one work to another.\n\nNo matter which method you choose, you do not need to give equal time to similarities and differences. In fact, your paper will be more interesting if you state your main argument(s) as quickly as possible. For example, a book review essay evaluating three research studies that examine different interpretations of conflict resolution among nations in the Middle East might have as few as two or three sentences in the introduction regarding similarities and only a paragraph or two to set up the contrast between the author’s positions. The rest of the essay, whether organized by block method or point-by-point, will be your analysis of the key differences among the books.\n\nThe Block Method\n\nPresent all the information about A, and then present parallel information about B. This pattern tends to work better for shorter book review essays, and those with few sub-topics. The method looks like this:\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA. Briefly introduce the significance of the overall subject matter\n\nB. Thesis Statement\n\n--First supporting point\n\n--Second supporting point\n\n--Third supporting point\n\nII. First book\n\nA. Summary of book\n\n--Relationship of work to first point\n\n--Relationship of work to second point\n\n--Relationship of work to third point\n\nIII. Second book\n\nA. Summary of book\n\n--Relationship of work to first point\n\n--Relationship of work to second point\n\n--Relationship of work to third point\n\nIV. Third book\n\nA. Summary of book\n\n--Relationship of work to first point\n\n--Relationship of work to second point\n\n--Relationship of work to third point\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nA. Restate thesis\n\nB. Briefly summarize how you proved your argument\n\nThe Point-by-Point Method\n\nPresent one point about A, and then go to the parallel point about B. Move to the next point, and do the same thing. This pattern tends to work better for long book review essays and those with many sub-topics. The method looks like this:\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA. Briefly introduce significance of overall subject matter\n\nB. Thesis statement\n\nII. Brief explanation of first book\n\nIII. Brief explanation of second book\n\nIV. First comparative point\n\nA. Relation of point to first book\n\nB. Relation of point to second book\n\nV. Second comparative point\n\nA. Relation of point to first book\n\nB. Relation of point to second book\n\nVI. Third comparative point\n\nA. Relation of point to first book\n\nB. Relation of point to second book\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\nA. Restate thesis\n\nB. Briefly summarize how your proved your argument\n\nIV. Critically Evaluate the Contents\n\nRegardless of whether you choose the block method or the point-by-point method, critical comments should form the bulk of your book review essay. State whether or not you feel the author's treatment of the subject matter is appropriate for the intended audience. Ask yourself:\n\nHas the objectives of each author(s) been achieved?\n\nWhat contribution do the books make to the field of study or discipline?\n\nIs the treatment of the subject matter objective?\n\nAre there facts and evidence that have been omitted, either in one of the books or collectively?\n\nWhat kinds of data, if any, are used to support each author's thesis statement?\n\nCan the same data be interpreted to alternate ends?\n\nIs the writing style clear and effective?\n\nDo the books raise important or provocative issues or topics for discussion and further research?\n\nWhat has been left out?\n\nSupport your evaluation with evidence from the text of each book and, when possible, in relation to other sources. If relevant, make note of each book's format, such as, layout, binding, typography, etc. Are there maps, illustrations? Do they aid in understanding the research problem? This is particular important in books that contain a lot of non-textual elements, such as tables, charts, pictures, and illustrations.\n\nNOTE: It is important to carefully distinguish your views from those of the authors, so that you don’t confuse your reader.\n\nV. Examine the Front Matter and Back Matter\n\nFront matter refers to anything before the first chapter of the book. Back matter refers to any information included after the final chapter of the book. Front matter is most often numbered separately from the rest of the text in lower case Roman numerals [i.e. i-xi]. Critical commentary about front or back matter is generally only necessary if you believe there is something that diminishes the overall quality of the work [e.g., the indexing is poor] or there is something that is particularly helpful in understanding the book's contents [e.g., foreword places the book in an important context].\n\nThe following front matter may be included in a book and may be considered for evaluation when reviewing its overall quality:\n\nTable of contents -- is it clear? Is it detailed or general? Does it reflect the true contents of the book?\n\nAuthor biography -- also found as back matter, the biography of author(s) can be useful in determining the authority of the writer and whether the book builds on prior research or represents new research. In scholarly reviews, noting the author's affiliation can be a factor in helping the reader determine the overall validity of the work [i.e., are they associated with a research center devoted to studying the research problem under investigation].\n\nForeword -- the purpose of a foreword is to introduce the reader to the author as well as the book itself, and to help establish credibility for both. A foreword may not contribute any additional information about the book's subject matter, but it serves as a means of validating the book's existence. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended [appearing before an older foreword, if there was one], which may be included to explain in how the latest edition differs from previous ones.\n\nAcknowledgements -- scholarly studies in the social sciences often take many years to write, so authors frequently acknowledge the help and support of others in getting their research published. This can be as innocuous as acknowledging the author's family or the publisher. However, an author may acknowledge prominent scholars or subject experts, staff at key research centers, or people who curate important archival collections. In these particular cases, it may be worth noting these sources of support in your review.\n\nPreface -- generally describes the genesis, purpose, limitations, and scope of the book and may include acknowledgments of indebtedness to people who have helped the author complete the study. Is the preface helpful in understanding the study? Does it provide an effective framework for understanding what's to follow?\n\nChronology -- also may be found as back matter, a chronology is generally included to highlight key events related to the subject of the book. Do the entries contribute to the overall work? Is it detailed or very general?\n\nList of non-textual elements -- a book that contains a lot of charts, photographs, maps, etc. will often list these items after the table of contents in order that they appear in the text. Is it useful?\n\nThe following back matter may be included in a book and may be considered for evaluation when reviewing the overall quality of the book:\n\nAfterword -- this is a short, reflective piece written by the author that takes the form of a concluding section, final commentary, or closing statement. It is worth mentioning in a review if it contributes information about the purpose of the book, gives a call to action, or asks the reader to consider key points made in the book.\n\nAppendix -- is the supplementary material in the appendix or appendices well organized? Do they relate to the contents or appear superfluous? Does it contain any essential information that would have been more appropriately integrated into the text?\n\nIndex -- is the index thorough and accurate? Are elements used, such as, bold or italic fonts to help identify specific places in the book?\n\nGlossary of Terms -- are the definitions clearly written? Is the glossary comprehensive or are key terms missing? Are any terms or concepts mentioned in the text not included?\n\nFootnotes/Endnotes -- examine any footnotes or endnotes as you read from chapter to chapter. Do they provide important additional information? Do they clarify or extend points made in the body of the text?\n\nBibliography/References/Further Readings -- review any bibliography, list of references to sources, and/or further readings the author may have included. What kinds of sources appear [e.g., primary or secondary, recent or old, scholarly or popular, etc.]? How does the author make use of them? Be sure to note important omissions of sources that you believe should have been utilized.\n\nNOTE: Typically, multiple book review essays do not compare and contrast the quality of the back and front matter unless the books share a common deficiency [e.g., poor indexing], the front or back matter is particularly important in supplementing the primary content of the books, or one book stands out in regards to the quality of information presented in the front or back matter.\n\nVI. Summarize and Comment\n\nYour conclusion should synthesize the key similarities and differences among the books and their collective contributions to understanding of the research problem. Avoid re-stating your assessment word for word; your goal is to provide a sense of closure and to leave the reader with a final perspective about the overall topic under review and whether you believe each book has effectively contributed to the overall research literature on the subject. Do not introduce new information in the conclusion. If you've compared the books to any other studies or used other sources in writing the review, be sure to cite them at the end of your book review essay."
