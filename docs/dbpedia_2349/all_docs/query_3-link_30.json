But don’t worry, I’ve got you covered with some tips and examples on how to quote a book title in your essay.\n\nMLA Style Guide\n\nIn MLA style, book titles are italicized, both in the text of your paper and in the Works Cited list.\n\nFor example: Toni Morrison’s Beloved is a powerful novel about the lasting impact of slavery.\n\nAPA Style\n\nSimilarly, in the style guide of the American Psychological Association, book titles should also be italicized in the text and the reference list.\n\nFor instance: In The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield grapples with the transition from adolescence to adulthood.\n\nChicago Manual\n\nIn Chicago style, book titles are italicized in the text and the bibliography.\n\nLike this: Michael Pollan explores the origins of our food in The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals.\n\nHow to Format Book Citations\n\nRegardless of the style guide, there are some general formatting rules to keep in mind.\n\nTitles of books should be underlined or italicized. Titles of stories, essays, and poems are placed in quotation marks.\n\nRefer to the text specifically as a novel, story, essay, memoir, or poem, depending on what it is.\n\nCapitalization Rules\n\nUse capital letters to write the title of a novel.\n\nFor example, The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n\nQuotation Marks\n\nTitles of stories, essays, and poems are placed in “quotation marks.” This helps differentiate them from longer works like novels or non-fiction books.\n\nWriting Various Types of Titles in Essays\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s dive into some specifics for different types of titles you might encounter.\n\nJournal Articles\n\nIf the book title is part of a larger work, like a journal article, it should be underlined instead of italicized.\n\nShort Stories\n\nTitles of short stories should be placed in quotation marks.\n\nFor example: “The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson.\n\nChapter Titles\n\nWhen referencing a chapter title, enclose it in quotation marks.\n\nFor instance: “The Boy Who Lived” from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.\n\nArticle Titles\n\nArticle titles, like those found in English-language newspapers or magazines, should also be placed in quotation marks.\n\nFor example: “Why We Crave Horror Movies” by Stephen King.\n\nNewspaper Titles\n\nItalicize the names of newspapers, like The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWebsites\n\nThe names of websites should generally be italicized, such as The Huffington Post or BuzzFeed.\n\nBook Series\n\nWhen referring to a book series as a whole, italicize the name of the series. Individual books within the series should also be italicized.\n\nFor example: the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, which includes titles like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nEmphasizing Book Titles in Essays\n\nSometimes you want to draw extra attention to a book title in your essay. Here’s how to do it effectively.\n\nWhen to Italicize\n\nAs a general rule, italicize the titles of longer works such as books, edited collections, movies, television series, documentaries, or albums.\n\nWhen to Use Quotation Marks\n\nShorter works like poems, articles, book chapters, songs, TV episodes, or other shorter works should be placed in quotation marks.\n\nExceptions to the Rules\n\nAs with any rule, there are exceptions. Some style guides prefer underlining to italics. Others may recommend using quotation marks around the title and italicizing or underlining the name of the newspaper or magazine it appears in.\n\nWhen in doubt, always check with your instructor or the publication you’re writing for.\n\nPunctuating and Capitalizing Book Titles\n\nPunctuation and capitalization are key when it comes to book titles in essays. Get it wrong, and your writing won’t look as polished.\n\nUsing Question Marks\n\nIf a book title ends with a question mark or exclamation point, include it in the italics.\n\nFor example: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick\n\nCapitalization Rules\n\nIn general, capitalize the first word and all major words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctions).\n\nDon’t capitalize articles, prepositions, or conjunctions unless they’re the first or last word.\n\nSome style guides recommend capitalizing prepositions five letters or longer.\n\nTitle Case\n\nTitle case is the most common form of title capitalization and is found in all four major title capitalization styles (AP, APA, MLA, and Chicago).\n\nCapitalize the first word in the title, the last word in the title, and all “major” words in between.\n\nProper Nouns\n\nAlways capitalize proper nouns, such as the names of people, places, organizations, or other proper nouns in a book title.\n\nFor example: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J.K. Rowling.\n\nExamples of Writing Book Titles in Essays\n\nLet’s look at some examples of how to write book titles in various situations.\n\nClassic Literature\n\nWhen referencing a classic work of literature, italicize the book’s title in the text of your paper.\n\nIn the Works Cited entry, include the author’s full name, the title of the book (in italics), the publisher, and the year of publication.\n\nFor example:\n\nAusten, Jane. Pride and Prejudice. Penguin Classics, 2002.\n\nContemporary Literature\n\nFor a contemporary work, follow the same format in the text of your essay.\n\nIn the Works Cited entry, include the author’s name, book title (in italics), publisher, year of publication, and medium of publication (print, web, etc.).\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nWhitehead, Colson. The Underground Railroad. Doubleday, 2016. Print.\n\nNon-Fiction Works\n\nWhen citing a non-fiction book, use the same format as you would for a fictional work. Italicize the book title in the text and the Works Cited entry. Include the author’s name, book title (in italics), publisher, year of publication, and medium of publication.\n\nFor instance:\n\nKrakauer, Jon. Into the Wild. Anchor Books, 1997. Print.\n\nFAQs – How to Write a Book Title in an Essay\n\nHow do you write the title of a book in a sentence?\n\nIn sentences, capitalize the first word and proper nouns. If it’s central to your point, italicize it.\n\nIs a book title italicized or in quotes?\n\nBook titles are usually italicized. Quotes are for shorter works like articles or poems.\n\nHow do you write a book title in a handwritten essay?\n\nIf handwritten, underline book titles instead of using italics to highlight them.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether you’re writing your essay manually or with the use of an AI tool like BrandWell, this guide will help you cite book titles properly and give credit where credit is due.\n\nBy following these simple rules for MLA, APA, and Chicago style, you’ll be able to format your book titles correctly every time.\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and pay attention to the details.
