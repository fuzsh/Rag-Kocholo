        "text": "Essays edited by Ander Monson and Craig Reinbold\n\nMarch 14, 2017 • 6 x 9 • 275 Pages • 978-1-56689-457-9\n\nThe best of Essay Daily—each a writer in conversation with and about an essay, whatever its variety, contemporary and classic.\n\nHow We Speak to One Another is some of the most engaging evidence we’ve got that the essay is going strong. Here, essayists talk back to each other, to the work they love and the work that disquiets them, and to the very basic building blocks of what we understand “essay” to be. What’s compiled in these pages testifies to the endless flexibility, generosity, curiosity, and audacity of essays. Even more than that, it provides the kind of pleasure any great essay collection does—upsetting our ideas and challenging the way we organize our sense of the world.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAnder Monson is the author, most recently, of Letter to a Future Lover: Marginalia, Errata, Secrets, Inscriptions, and Other Ephemera Found in Libraries (Graywolf Press). He is also the author of Vanishing Point, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and Neck Deep and Other Predicaments. He edits DIAGRAM and the New Michigan Press. Monson lives in Tucson and teaches in the MFA program at the University of Arizona.\n\nCraig Reinbold’s writing has appeared in many journals and magazines including the Gettysburg Review, Iowa Review, New England Review, Guernica, Gulf Coast, and Brevity. He was the managing editor of Essay Daily from 2013 – 2016.\n\nContributors include:\n\nAnder Monson • Marcia Aldrich • Kristen Radtke • Robin Hemley • Robert Atwan • Matt Dube • Aisha Sabatini Sloan • T.
