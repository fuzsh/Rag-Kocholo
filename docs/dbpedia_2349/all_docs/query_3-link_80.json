        "text": "Every serious writer, I’ve heard it said, has one book whose title seems to sum up his or her oeuvre. For Wendell Berry, that book would almost certainly be “Another Turn of the Crank,” from 1995.\n\nBerry is a fiery dissenter from nearly every aspect of modern life. He’s a Kentucky-based farmer, conservationist, pacifist and moral critic who, over the course of his long life (he’s 84), has farmed with horses rather than tractors to remain closer to the land and written longhand so as not to plug another machine into the electrical grid.\n\nThe fingers of his writing hand surely have mighty calluses. Berry has delivered more than 80 books of fiction, nonfiction and poetry.\n\nThe Library of America last year published a thousand-page selection of his earthy fiction. (A second volume is in the works, as well as a collection of Berry’s poetry.)\n\nNow this estimable nonprofit publisher returns with two slablike volumes of his nonfiction in a boxed set, “What I Stand On: The Collected Essays of Wendell Berry 1969-2017.” Together the books weigh in at a forest-pulping 1,674 pages. It’s a lot of Wendell Berry.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
