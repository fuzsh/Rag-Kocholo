        "text": "Geography Ph.D. candidate, Xiaowei Wang, wrote an essay collection that was chosen by the National Book Foundation (NBF) and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation as a 2023 Science + Literature selected title. According to NBF, \"In Blockchain Chicken Farm: And Other Stories of Tech in China’s Countryside, Wang examines the intersection of politics, agriculture, and technology in China’s rural revitalization strategy. Wang shares case studies and personal stories—including their own family’s—to portray the knowns and unknowns of a rapidly changing world influenced by artificial intelligence and power.\"\n\nThe initiative identifies three books annually that deepen readers’ understanding of science and technology and focuses on highlighting the diversity of voices in contemporary science and technology writing. Authors receive a $10,000 cash prize, are celebrated at a ceremony in March, and will be featured in associated national public programming."
