        "text": "1. Complete the online entry form, which opens on March 13, 2024 and closes on May 15, 2024. Please review the eligibility criteria above closely before submitting.\n\n2. Send digital & hard copies of titles submitted via the entry form to the Foundation and judges (see section below for details).\n\nOnly publishers may submit titles. To maintain the ethical wall between the Foundation and authors whose work may be up for consideration, all communications about submissions must be conducted by the publisher.\n\nFEES\n\nThere is a $135 entry fee for each title submitted. Accepted forms of payment include credit card and ACH. Please be prepared with payment information before you begin the online submission process.\n\nPublishers whose submitted books are deemed ineligible by the Foundation will still be subject to the stated entry fee of $135 per title. Please review the eligibility criteria above closely before submitting.\n\nThe chair of each judging panel may “call in” titles through the Foundation office that have not been submitted by publishers. The Foundation then asks publishers to submit these titles for consideration, assuming they meet eligibility requirements. Publishers may submit at their own discretion. The $135 fee applies to all call-in titles.\n\nPROVIDING DIGITAL & HARD COPIES\n\nFor each submitted title, publishers are required to send BOTH a digital copy and six hard copies to guarantee consideration. Publishers must send:\n\n1. A digital copy (in PDF format) via the process outlined in the confirmation email sent after completing the entry form.\n\n2. Six hard copies of each book: one copy to the Foundation’s office, and one to each of the five judges in the appropriate category. All relevant mailing addresses are included in the confirmation email sent after completing the entry form.\n\nThe deadline for sending digital and hard copies depends on the title’s publication date. Digital copies must be received by the Foundation by 5:00pm PDT on the respective deadline, and hard copies must be postmarked by the same date.\n\nFriday, May 31 — Deadline for providing copies of submitted titles published December 1, 2023–June 30, 2024\n\nMonday, July 1 — Deadline for providing copies of submitted titles published July 1, 2024–November 30, 2024\n\nIf copies are provided after the deadline, judges are not obligated to consider the title but may do so at their discretion. Digital copies and hard copies of submitted titles should be sent as soon as they are available. Bound manuscripts, galleys, and ARCs are all acceptable as hard copies, and the publisher is welcome to follow up with the final version when it is available if they wish.\n\nADDITIONAL CONDITIONS\n\nBy submitting titles for consideration via the online entry form, publishers agree to:\n\nEnsure that each author is aware of and consents to the entry of their book for the National Book Awards.\n\nDesignate one person to coordinate all National Book Award-related matters with the Foundation throughout the Awards process. This person will be contacted in the case that a title becomes part of the Longlist. If this person is new to the process, please make sure they are familiar with all the guidelines and deadlines on this page.\n\nContribute toward a promotional campaign if a submitted book becomes a Finalist. For presses with income of $10 million or above, a contribution of $3,000; under $10 million, a contribution of $750; and for presses with income under $1 million, the fee is waived.\n\nInform authors that, if selected as Finalists, they must agree to attend the Foundation’s National Book Awards events, the details of which will be conveyed to them by the Foundation through their publisher.\n\nPRIZES\n\nThere are five panels of five Judges each in the categories of Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Translated Literature, and Young People’s Literature, each including a panel chair, chosen by the National Book Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation will announce Longlists of ten books in each category in mid-September.\n\nThe Foundation will announce the twenty-five Finalist books, five in each category, on October 1, 2024.\n\nOne Winner in each category will be announced at the National Book Awards Ceremony on November 20, 2024.\n\nEach Winner will receive a prize of $10,000. Each Finalist will receive a prize of $1,000. In the case of the Translated Literature Award, prizes are split equally between author and translator. In the case of co-authored works, prizes are split equally between authors.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nIs my self-published book eligible?\n\nSelf-published books are not eligible if published via a publishing service, such as Kindle Direct Publishing. However, if a self-publisher: 1) publishes more than one author, and 2) does not publish through a publishing service, the title would be eligible. The National Book Foundation may request a catalog of titles from a self-publisher to verify eligibility.\n\nCan an author submit their own book for consideration?\n\nNo. The entry form must be completed by the author’s publisher in order for a book to be considered.\n\nIs it possible to submit a book for consideration even though the entry form deadline has passed?\n\nUnfortunately, no titles can be submitted for consideration after the entry form closes at 5:00pm PDT on Wednesday, May 15, 2024. Additionally, physical copies of submitted titles must be postmarked by the deadline corresponding to the publication date in order to be guaranteed consideration (see Submission Process section). If a book is postmarked after these dates, the book is considered only at the judges’ discretion.\n\nWhat if galleys of a submitted title won’t be available before July 1, 2024?\n\nIn the case where a galley copy of a title won’t be available until after July 1, 2024, please send a bound manuscript postmarked by the July 1, 2024 deadline. Finished copies may be sent when they become available, but it is not required to send a finished copy for the title to be considered.\n\nWhat if a book could be considered in more than one category?\n\nBooks may only be submitted in one category. Please choose the category most appropriate when entering the book for submission.\n\nAre graphic novels, graphic memoirs, and/or comics eligible for the National Book Award?\n\nYes, provided they meet the other eligibility requirements.\n\nHow many titles are submitted for the National Book Award?\n\nIn 2023, 1,931 titles were considered for the National Book Award. Of these titles, 496 were for Fiction, 638 were for Nonfiction, 295 were for Poetry, 154 were for Translated Literature, and 348 were for Young People’s Literature.\n\nHow will the publisher know if judges have received copies of the books?\n\nIn advance of the respective deadlines, the Foundation will contact any publisher who has submitted titles for which the National Book Foundation has not yet received digital copies. To ensure sufficient time for mailing hard copies, reminders will also be sent via email to all submitters two weeks before each deadline.\n\nWhen will the publisher be notified if a book entered for consideration is on the Longlist?\n\nIf a book is chosen for the Longlist, the contact person who submitted the book will be notified in mid-September.
