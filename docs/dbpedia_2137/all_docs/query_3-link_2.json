        "text": "ABOUT FILM\n\nAn epic drama detailing the relationship between the legendary Czech actress and the Nazi Minister of Propaganda opens when Lída Baarová, starring as an exotic beauty in the film Barcarole, first captures the hearts of thousands of new fans in Germany. She also enjoyed and benefitted from the fame and affection of actor Gustav Fröhlich, and nor did the Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler hide his admiration for the Czech actress. It was Joseph Goebbels, head of the film industry and Minister of Propaganda, however, who thrust Lída into the higher echelons of society, with regular invitations to magnificent parties. She was enchanted, and indeed Baarová succumbed completely to his charms – a potentially fatal attraction. She spent the war largely in her native Prague, and after liberation was charged with collaboration.\n\nlive action feature film\n\nCzech Republic / 2016\n\nFilmed on location in Brno: Mahen Theatre, Stiassni Villa, Villa Tugendhat\n\nphotos courtesy of: Julie Vrabelová / Česká televize\n\nscreenplay: Ivan Hubač\n\ndirection: Filip Renč\n\nstarring: Táňa Pauhofová, Karl Markovics, Gedeon Burkhard, Simona Stašová, Martin Huba, Lenka Vlasáková, Pavel Kříž, Anna Fialová, Jiří Mádl, Zdenka Procházková, Michal Dlouhý and others\n\nABOUT FILMING LOCATIONS\n\nMahenovo divadlo (Mahen Theatre)\n\nThe Mahen Theatre is one of the most important architectural monuments in Brno. With its carefully blended Neo-Renaissance façade, it dominates Malinovsky Square and was once the first fully illuminated theatre in Europe. The theatre’s rousing Neo-Baroque interior, characteristic of late Historicism, is richly ornamented, whether in the theatre vestibule, foyer, or in parts of the auditorium, decorated by allegorical ceiling lunettes and a remarkable crystal chandelier, for example.\n\nVila Tugendhat (Villa Tugendhat)\n\nVila Tugendhat is the only modern Czech architectural monument inscribed onto UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites. The villa, commissioned by the couple Greta and Fritz Tugendhat, was built in 1929–1930 according to a design drawn by Ludwig Miese van der Rohe. For the first time in the history of Czechsolvak architecture, a supporting steel frame was used in a private home, sitting on columns in a cross-shaped plan. The interiors combine a wealth of precious materials, while the home’s technical fittings were a marvel of their time. In 2010–2012 the villa underwent complete expert renovation.\n\nSkip the line in front of Villa Tugendhat with the new BRNOPAS tourist card!\n\nVila Stiassni\n\nThe Stiassni Villa was erected in 1927–1929 according to a design by the illustrious Brno architect Ernst Wiesner for the family of Jewish textile magnate Alfred Stiassni. Ultimately, Alfred, his wife and daughter lived here just nine years before the entire family were forced to flee in the face of imminent Nazi occupation. For many people, the villa became subconsciously associated with the Czechoslovak government after it was visited by Edvard Beneš. Later it was used to accommodate famous and important state guests: Cuban president Fidel Castro stayed here, as well as most Czech presidents, for example. The villa was officially opened to the public on 13 December 2014.\n\nINTERESTING FACTS ABOUT FILMING"
