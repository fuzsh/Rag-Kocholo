        "text": "Praga Alfa\n\nNew series of Alfa (i.e. series 17-21) kept six-cylinder engine of previous series but with alterations especially in capacity and power. In 1930, a new pickup “Normandy” was introduced and proved to be very popular especially among small businesses.\n\nPraga vehicles competed in many racing events during the 1930s. Alfa models were no exception; in 1932, two modified vehicles of this model were produced especially for the factory engineer and racer Petr Mucha. Racing duo Mucha-Urban then participated in the first official race “1000 miles of Czechoslovakia” and won with a stunning average speed of 84 km/h on open roads.\n\nThe second stage of Alfa production was completed with only one vehicle prototype in 1933. Developed as an ambulance car it included many adjustments and modifications. These adjustments were used later on during production of standard ambulance cars on Super Piccolo and Lady chassis.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1932\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1929\n\nEnd of Production 1933\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type sedan\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 2900 mm, 114.2 in\n\nLength 4355 mm, 171.5 in\n\nWidth 1530 mm, 60.2 in\n\nWeight 1320 kg, 2910 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1792 ccm, 108.8 cu-in\n\nBore 65.0 mm, 2.559 in\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 26.0 / 36.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 90 km/h, 56 mph\n\nPraga AT\n\nPraga began with the production of tractor vehicles in 1928 and replaced the previous production of motor-ploughs. Tractors therefore stand for the second phase of modernization of agricultural production generally. Tractor Praga AT was a small machine powered by an engine with capacity of 1.947 ccm and power 16.5 kW at 1.800 rpm. The tractor was ideal for both road and field surfaces – and had option of wheels specially designed for ploughing purposes. Tractors were a popular choice mainly among medium-size farmers who generally represented the progressive current in the agricultural area of life in the First Czechoslovak republic. In total, over 500 Praga AT tractor vehicles were produced in Praga’s factories. Other tractors developed by the company were models BDk (1928 – 1932) and KT (1929 – 1930).\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1928\n\nModel AT\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type traktor\n\nNumber of seats 1\n\nLength 2815 mm\n\nWidth 1560 mm\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1947 ccm\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Zenith 30 K\n\nMax power 20 HP / 1400\n\nMaximum speed 20 km/h\n\nPraga 500 BDS\n\nPraga participated in the production of motorcycles only shortly, during the years 1927 – 1935.The production was led by J. F. Koch, Praga’s construction engineer who gained his know-how during his years in Laurin and Clement factories. His abilities later improved during his work in an aircraft manufacturing factory Aviatik in Vienna during the WWI. Koch himself also successfully finished a voyage from Rome to Prague in a record time of only 35 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nPraga 500 BDS was based on several motorbikes labelled “BD 500” which were manufactured from 1927. However, they were never produced in a serial manner with almost each motorcycle different in some aspects. Serial production of 500 BDS started in the year 1928; the model was produced solo and with a sidecar (which added 100 kg to the bike, with total weight of 270 kg). The second option was widely popular and so the company provided both one-seat and two-seat alternatives of the sidecar.\n\nPraga 500 BDS was manufactured in five series with over 1800 models produced in total. Several individual bikes were also commissioned in a non-serial way after 1932.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1928\n\nModel 500 BDS\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nWheelbase 1425 mm\n\nWeight 170 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 1\n\nCooling air\n\nBore 84 mm\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nValve gear 2xOHC\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburretor\n\nMax power 11 kW / 4400 rpm\n\nGearbox 3\n\nMaximum speed 105 km/h\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nThe 8th series of Praga Piccolo started the production of the “classic” version of the vehicle which is the most famous one and probably the most praised as well. This version continued to be in production for five more years until the 20th series (with 500 cars produced in each series). With new series more modifications were made regarding the engine, carburettor, tyres and coachwork. In 1930, a useful pickup version “Normandy” (also used with the Alfa type) was introduced and became quickly popular amongst small businessmen. Normandy proved helpful to the police force which commissioned 50 vehicles in the pickup version with small seats in the cargo area of the vehicle. Another interesting example is specially modified vehicle advertising Hašlerky, very popular candy at that time (and even today).\n\nMost regular Piccolo vehicles were however the two / four-door limousine and phaeton.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1930\n\nModel Poccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type convertible, limousine, faeton\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2600 mm, 102.4 in\n\nLength 3870 mm, 152.4 in\n\nWidth 1450 mm, 57.1 in\n\nHeight 1550 mm, 61 in\n\nWeight 930 kg, 2050 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nCapacity 995 ccm, 60.4 cu-in\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 88.0 mm, 3.465 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 15.0 / 21.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 85 km/h, 53 mph\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nThe 7th series of Praga Piccolo with enhanced engine is introduced to the market in 1927. However, in the same year a national competition for “People’s car” takes place with the extraordinary reward of 50 million crowns. This inspires the company to develop partial series 7/IV in which the main objective is to produce the cheapest high-quality vehicle as possible. The outcome of this effort is Praga Piccolo Special-Lido, a wooden convertible without doors and with seats furnished with upholstery fabric (presenting the first convertible with other than leather seats). All accessories are reduced to minimum and the vehicle reaches the prescribed cost of 25 000 crowns. This price is comparable to a motorcycle with sidecar. The model is naturally available in a better equipped version with several additional charges. However the basic type proves to be ideal and Praga wins the national competition. The company therefore receives not only the stunning financial bonus but also gains respect and prestige in the eyes of the public.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1927\n\nModel Poccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1927\n\nEnd of Production 1927\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nWheelbase 2500 mm\n\nLength 3600 mm, 141.7 in\n\nWidth 1360 mm\n\nWeight 690 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 856 cm³\n\nBore 55 mm\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 42H\n\nMax power 9.5 at 2800 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 75 km/h\n\nPraga Grand\n\nThe fourteenth series of Praga Grand was introduced in 1927 and represented one of the highest achievements of Praga’s automobile production. With an eight-cylinder engine and first-class equipment, this model acquired nickname “Rolls-Royce of Czechoslovakia.” High quality was evident both in the exterior and interior of the car: all seats were covered with leather (alternatively with cloth and plush in sedan) which included spare seats hidden behind the driver; the floor was covered with plush. Windows could be manually lowered by crack handles and because of nifty glass shelters, it was possible to ventilate in any weather. The windshield was equipped with automatic wipers. The passengers had at their disposal a telephone connecting them with the driver, small storage compartments, electric lighter with ashtrays and handy hangers.\n\nThe production continued for three years until 1929 and was reinstated in 1931. Unfortunately, the demand for luxury cars drastically decreased during the period of depression and therefore the production ultimately stopped in 1932. In total, 1 196 vehicles Praga Grand were produced; 897 with four-cylinder engines and 299 with eight-cylinder engines.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1929\n\nModel Grand\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1927\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 7\n\nWheelbase 3450 mm, 135.8 in\n\nLength 5025 mm, 197.8 in\n\nWidth 1650 mm, 65 in\n\nHeight 1810 mm, 71.3 in\n\nWeight 1930 kg, 4255 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 8\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 3582 ccm, 217.6 cu-in\n\nBore 72.0 mm, 2.835 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 2 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 51.0 / 70.0 at 3000 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 120 km/h, 75 mph\n\nPraga Alfa\n\nThe first Alfa with a six-cylinder engine was introduced in 1927. We owe this innovation to new constructional solutions provided by engineer Petránek. It was also Petránek who helped to transform Mignon to six-cylinder engine and Grand even to eight-cylinder engine. Previous four-cylinder variant of Alfa remained in production until 1928; after this year only the newer model remains in production with further enhancements and improvements.\n\nDuring these years, Praga was facing capacity issues regarding their coachbuilding workshops and a fair share of chassis was therefore manufactured in other workshops.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1928\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1927\n\nEnd of Production 1929\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 5\n\nWheelbase 2900 mm\n\nWeight 1200 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 1496 cm³\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 88.0 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nMax power 21.0 kW / PS at 3000 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 75-80 km/h\n\nPraga Alfa\n\nIn 1926 a new series of Alfa with enhanced engine and bodywork was introduced to the public. The principal modifications included shock absorbers on both axles and a safety laminated windshield Triplex. The production of this model (still with a four-cylinder engine) continued up until 1928 in spite of the arrival of new series in 1927 which was powered by a six-cylinder engine. The main reasons for ongoing production included probably a lower production cost, less demanding maintenance, lower weight and lower fuel consumption. Therefore, for a short period of nearly two years the company produced simultaneously two series of Alfas; most likely waiting to see which one would prove to be more successful. 1800 vehicles of this series were produced in total.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1927\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1926\n\nEnd of Production 1928\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2700 mm\n\nWeight 1150 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1328 cm³\n\nBore 62 mm\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nMax power 11.0 / 15.0 kW / PS at 2500rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 80 km/h\n\nPraga MN, LN\n\nPraga’s LN and MN models represent two types of light and utility trucks which were produced in relatively low numbers (507 vehicles of the MN type and 1.050 vehicles of the LN type). Their employment, however, was various and both these models proved to be able to carry out multiple tasks. Praga MN (1926 – 1928) was based on the Mignon model and Praga LN (1932 – 1940) was based primarily on the chassis of a similar truck Praga AN. Both vehicles were produced in many variations which included box vans and buses. We also have MN fire trucks still preserved today.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel LN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1926\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 30 TGH\n\nPraga Mignon\n\nThe second half of 1920s is characterized by a substantial modernization of all the types – and Praga Mignon is no exception. The 16th series is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with two Zenith carburettors. The M3 gearbox is furnished with Gleason silent cogs. The weight of the vehicle is gradually rising and the last series of Mignon (1929) weights nearly two thousand kilograms. Mignon vehicles are similar many aspects to Praga Grand: they both have rather a robust nature and are often used as luxury limousines. They also share a lot of same construction parts. The most popular model was a six-seat limousine with a divider behind the driver; the cheaper option was represented by a six seat phaeton.\n\nLast vehicles of Praga Mignon were produced in 1929. In total, 1 447 cars were produced by the company.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1929\n\nModel Mignon\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1925\n\nEnd of Production 1929\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine, faeton\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3250 mm, 128 in\n\nLength 4825 mm, 190 in\n\nWidth 1650 mm, 65 in\n\nWeight 1940 kg, 4277 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 2636 ccm, 160.1 cu-in\n\nBore 72.0 mm, 2.835 in\n\nStroke 108.0 mm, 4.252 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 2 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 37.0 / 50.0 at 3000 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 90 km/h, 56 mph\n\nPraga AN\n\nPraga AN was a light truck based on the Alfa series which was very popular among small businessmen. Its title is a simple acronym of “Alfa Nákladní” meaning “Freight Alfa”. It was also unofficially referred to as “anka” between its users. In the beginning of the production, AN was more of a van than a truck but the customers gradually demanded larger vehicle and so its dimensions grew with the years of its production (as it was in the case of a parallel production of Alfa model). Growing along the dimensions was the gross vehicle weight and engine power.\n\nIn total, approximately five and a half thousand vehicles were produced in 23 series from 1924 to 1940. This number included several modifications, including f.e. 330 small bus vehicles Praga AO which were able to accommodate 15 sitting passengers.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel Praga AN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1924\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nFront track 1230 mm, 48.4 in\n\nLength 4710\n\nWidth 1650\n\nGross vehicle weight 1 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 26 HAK\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 16.0 kW / PS at 2800 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nPraga Piccolo model was a substitute for a continuously growing Alpha model. The name refers to both car’s size and nature: Piccolo is intended as a cheaper vehicle for larger public but aims to remain the overall quality and dependability of the brand. Piccolo remains Praga’s smallest vehicle until the beginning of 1930s and is therefore labelled as “small and people’s car;” although it must be said that living circumstances at that time meant that even “Piccolos” were not for everyone. Nevertheless, this vehicle represents probably the most widespread model on pre-war domestic market. Piccolo model also underwent many modifications during its production and can be considered very variable. Praga produced six series of Piccolo model in three years, with only minor alternations, concerning mainly power of the engine.\n\nDuring 1920s, Praga vehicles participated in many long-distance journeys. Driver Josef Vyskočil travels in Piccolo through North Africa and on a trip of approximately 10 000 kilometres visits Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt without any serious malfunctions of the vehicle.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1924\n\nEnd of Production 1926\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tudor\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2400 mm, 94.5 in\n\nLength 3400 mm, 133.9 in\n\nWidth 1320 mm, 52 in\n\nWeight 640 kg, 1411 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 824 ccm, 50 cu-in\n\nBore 54.0 mm, 2.126 in\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 9.0 / 12.5 at 2800 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 70 km/h, 44 mph\n\nPraga Alfa\n\nProduction of Praga Alfa began again three years after the First World War. Alfa was continuously improved in terms of both power and design. There are also a several novelties regarding this model: one of them was a device which stopped the engine in a case of decrease of the oil level. This novelty was called “policeman” and it was used in the following models up until the 30s. Another interesting innovation was bodywork with rear cargo area (similar to pickup trucks) to which a hardtop could be attached and therefore the vehicle was transformed into a four passenger automobile.\n\nThe vehicles turned up to be very popular and so an increase of production followed: 300 vehicles were produced in 1924 rising to 500 vehicles in 1925. In total 2600 cars of this type were produced from the 3rd up to 11th series. The model was available in both phaeton and limousine option.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1923\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1922\n\nEnd of Production 1926\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nWheelbase 2650 mm, 104.3 in\n\nLength 3800 mm, 149.6 in\n\nWidth 1420 mm, 55.9 in\n\nWeight 1125 kg, 2480 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1244 ccm, 75.6 cu-in\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 14.0 / 19.0 at 2400 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nPraga Grand\n\nFor a whole period of ten years, Praga Grand was manufactured with only minor changes. It is quite impressive that for all this time Grands were in high demand and their equipment did not seem outdated outdated at all. However, with a new series in 1922, principal changes were made. We have to at mention at least the reinforcement of crankshaft, widening of main bearings, larger diameter of valves, pistons of light alloy and an up-to-date horizontal carburettor Zenith 42H. The vehicle was equipped with electric lights and electric starter for the first time in Praga’s history. Gauges on the dashboard were illuminated which improved driving condition during journeys in the night.\n\nThis Grand was also a part of the vehicle fleet of T. G. Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia, This we have documented in footage of his visit in the North of Bohemia in 1926. This is also the year of termination of production of the13. series of. Another substantial changes were made with the next series in 1927.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1922\n\nModel Grand\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1922\n\nEnd of Production 1926\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 42H\n\nMax power 46.5 at 2400 rpm\n\nPraga N\n\nPraga N, constructed in 1915, was a successor to older heavy truck models V and T. The production continued without any substantial changes until 1930. During the following year, Praga N’s both engine and exterior were modernized to suit better contemporary requirements. N type was mainly manufactured as a flatbed truck and bus vehicle (as was the case of other Praga vehicles in this category) but many other options were available; these included tank and dumper truck, fire trucks and sweeper trucks. Praga N was a favourite option both for private companies and individuals and in public sector where Ns were employed mostly for military and municipal services.\n\nThe N type was in production for stunning 24 years in 23 series in total. More than two thousand vehicles were manufactured and several types NB, ND, NO and NO-D were derived from the basic N type.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1925\n\nModel N\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1915\n\nEnd of Production 1938\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 7140 mm\n\nWidth 2200 mm\n\nGross vehicle weight 5 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 7 487 ccm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor zenith 42 HAK\n\nMax power 36.7 kW (50 k) / 1500 rpm\n\nGearbox 4\n\nMaximum speed 30 km/h\n\nPraga K\n\nPraga manufactured several series of motor-ploughs in the 1910s and 1920s. These ploughs represent a transitory phase between the traditional ways of cultivation and tractor-based ploughing. The invention of motor-plough was a significant event in the modernization of agricultural techniques; both symbolically and practically.\n\nPraga manufactured in total three types of ploughs. Type “K” was introduced 1913 and continued in a serial manner up until 1925 with several modifications. Type “X” represented a popular choice among smaller agricultural businesses and settlements. After the war the last “X 20” type was manufactured. Praga produced in total over a thousand ploughs but hundreds more were produced by several European factories which purchased a licence for production of these ploughs.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1914\n\nModel K, X, X20\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1913\n\nEnd of Production 1925\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of seats 1\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 5540 ccm\n\nBore 105 mm\n\nStroke 160 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor Praga 42\n\nMax power 30 kW / 1000 rpm\n\nPraga R\n\nPraga R, produced in 1913, is the company’s first original medium truck. Its production started under the guidance of chief engineer František Kec. R type was based on Praga Grand and was devised as a two-door and two-seat vehicle with a flatbed as the main option. Other options included even a bus (which was able to accommodate up to twenty passengers) and several options tailored to military purposes, whether it was an army truck or an ambulance car. The army of Czechoslovakia owned 170 vehicles in total, most of which remained in its inventory until the autumn of 1938.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1921\n\nModel R\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1913\n\nEnd of Production 1926\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 4900 mm\n\nWidth 1700 mm\n\nGross vehicle weight 2000 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 3816 cm³\n\nBore 90 mm\n\nStroke 150 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 42AHK\n\nMax power 26.0 at 1200 rpm\n\nGearbox 3 + Z\n\nMaximum speed 30 km/h\n\nPraga L & LD\n\nLight truck and utility vehicle called simply “L” was produced by Praga in the years preceding the First World War.

Only a short time after the first series hit the road, three “Grands” participated successfully in a demanding Alpine race and thus gained respect and admiration in the eyes of the public right from the beginning of their production. Because of its sturdy and representative nature, these vehicles served as means of transport for generals and representatives of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And because of their reliability, they were used on the fields of the First World War, mainly as a transport of war officers and ambulance cars. After the war, the first president of the First Czechoslovak republic T. G. Masaryk visited Praga factory in 1919 and was offered a Grand vehicle for his personal use. Masaryk grew fond of this model and later had in possession five Praga Grand vehicles in total.\n\nAfter the first series in 1912, the production of Grand continued with minor changes up until 1921.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1921\n\nModel Grand\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1912\n\nEnd of Production 1921\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type phaeton\n\nNumber of doors 3\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3295 mm, 129.7 in\n\nLength 4800 mm, 189 in\n\nWidth 1720 mm, 67.7 in\n\nWeight 1800 kg, 3968 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 3817 ccm, 231.8 cu-in\n\nBore 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nStroke 150.0 mm, 5.906 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nMax power 40.0 / 55.0 at 2000 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga Mignon\n\nPraga’s first model of an entirely original construction was born in 1911 and bears the name Praga Mignon. Designed by Praga’s engineer Josef Havránek, the aim of this vehicle was to offer a versatile car for a wide spectre of customers. On account of this goal, Mignon balanced between the categories of mid-size and executive car.\n\nEighty-five vehicles were produced in three series from 1911 to 1914. In 1915, František Kec became the chief construction engineer and modified Mignon to fully fit into the executive car class. During the WWI, Mignons served both the needs of the army and public until the production was suspended in 1917. The production was later restored in 1920. Mignon’s chassis was firm and stable and therefore the vehicle was convenient for several modifications including ambulance car, bus or a pickup. The company produced nearly seven hundreds vehicles of this type in total.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1924\n\nModel Mignon\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1911\n\nEnd of Production 1924\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine, faeton, convertible\n\nNumber of doors 3\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3000 mm, 118.1 in\n\nLength 4500 mm, 177.2 in\n\nWidth 1620 mm, 63.8 in\n\nWeight 1450 kg, 3197 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 2296 ccm, 139.5 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 130.0 mm, 5.118 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 × Zenith\n\nMax power 22.0 / 30.0 at 2000 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 80 km/h, 50 mph\n\nPraga E-211\n\nShortly after the end of the WWII, Czechoslovak engineers focused on production of aircrafts designated for irregular passenger transport and used as air taxis. Jaroslav Šlechta, Praga’s foremost engineer, picked up the pre-war model E-210 and tailored it according to the trends and needs of the present-day. Thus, Praga E-211 was born and had its first flight at the beginning of June 1947. The plane maintained his predecessor’s placement of motors on the wing in a push configuration and its triple vertical tail. Its flight features proved to be efficient and its overall look was very up-to-date. However, the competition was fierce at that time and therefore it did not succeed against similar Aero Ae-45. Therefore the factory only produced two planes E-211 in total.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1937\n\nModel E-211\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1947\n\nEnd of Production 1947\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type high-wing monoplane\n\nNumber of seats 5\n\nLength 8.5 m\n\nHeight 2.07 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system 2×Walter Minor 4-111\n\nMax power 78 kW (105 hp)\n\nMaximum speed 230 km/h\n\nPraga BH-111\n\nThis special designed for Challenge International de Tourisme racing flight across Europe was manufactured by engineers Beneš and Hajn in 1932. BH-111 was a two-seater monoplane equipped with automatic slots and flaps. On top of that, the rules of the race stated that the wing has to be simply foldable along the fuselage. In total, three aircrafts were produced, two of which took part in this prestigious European competition. The planes had to fly total length of 7348 kilometres – this task was met by both the parties in question and the teams arrived on 12th and 21st place (with 43 competitors in total). After this competition, the planes were favoured in air club and one even made it to the silver screen and starred in a movie As Long as your Mother is Alive with Lida Baarová.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1932\n\nModel BH-111\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1932\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type low-wing monoplane\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 7.40 m\n\nWidth 10.50 m\n\nHeight 2.9 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system 1 × de Havilland Gipsy\n\nMax power 89.7 kW (122 hp)\n\nMaximum speed 230 km/h\n\nPraga E-51\n\nE-51 aircraft was manufactured to defend the borders of the Czechoslovak republic. This two-fuselage scout plane had its first flight in May 1938, but required some time further tests. Unfortunately, this period was not a calm one and so the testing process was stopped after the signing of Munich agreement and the Nazi occupation in 1939. These circumstances thwarted several promising projects including this airplane. And, unfortunately, further tests were continued after 1939 – but this time by the Germans themselves.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel E-51\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1938\n\nEnd of Production 1939\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type two-fuselage scout plane\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nLength 11,69 m\n\nHeight 3,50 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 12\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system 2×Walter Sagitta I-MR\n\nMax power 404 kW (542 hp)\n\nMaximum speed 380 km/h\n\nPraga E-210\n\nJaroslav Šlechta favoured unusual solutions for his own models and this is the case of Praga E-210: airplane designed for passenger transport. The prototype had its first flight in 1937 but required further tests. In the end, the testing process was quite complex and the plane require several modifications; therefore, the plane began its serial production not until 1939 – which is also the year of the German occupation. E-210 was a four-seat high wing cantilever monoplane with an unusual two engines close to the fuselage driving small propellers in pusher configuration.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1937\n\nModel E-210\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1939\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type high-wing monoplane\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nLength 8.5 m\n\nHeight 2.07 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system 2 × Walter Minor\n\nMax power 63 kW (85 hp)\n\nMaximum speed 230 km/h\n\nPraga TOT\n\nThe only trolley bus that has Praga ever produced was based on the “TO” bus and was manufactured in 1935. After the prototype, another eleven vehicles were produced in 1937. Praga “TOT” was able to accommodate 33 sitting and 47 standing passengers and was integrated in Prague’s public transport during the very same year. However, constructional alterations had to be made on the vehicle in 1939 when the Nazi invaders forced the change of former left-hand traffic to (current) right-hand form. “TOT” vehicles proved to be very effective and remained in use until the 1950s. Unfortunately, after the rearrangement of Praga’s production in the 1940s the production of “TOT” was terminated and thus only a few trolleybuses were manufactured by the company. Later, in the 1960s, the last trolleybuses roamed Prague streets to be fully replaced by bus and tram transport only.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1937\n\nModel TOT\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1939\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 81\n\nLength 10,2 m\n\nWidth 2,45 m\n\nHeight 3,3 m\n\nWeight 10,7 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nMax power 2x46.0 KW/1200\n\nMaximum speed 50 km/h\n\nPraga Golden\n\nThe production of Praga Golden continued in two series in the years 1937 to 1938. Both technical and design modifications were made, the most important including a new carburettor Zenith 42 JB, dual-circuit break system with booster and wider tires. This model was able to reach a stunning maximum speed of 130 kilometres per hour.\n\nModels of the second and third series were revered in showrooms of Paris and Berlin and Praga predicted successful export to European countries. Unfortunately, because of fickle and worsening political situation, the actual export did not prove to be so successful and the production of Praga Golden ended with the third series in 1938 with the total of 182 vehicles produced.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel Golden\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1938\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3500 mm, 137.8 in\n\nWeight 2230 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 3912 cm³\n\nBore 85 mm\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nMax power 57.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 130 km/h\n\nPraga AV\n\nPraga AV was a military command vehicle manufactured in the years 1936 – 1937. It is remarkable especially for its 6×4 drive which was used to improve operation in difficult terrains of the battlefield. Complementary vehicle to AV was Praga RV, military truck designated for transport of soldiers, cargo and light machinery, whereas Praga RV served for transport of army’s high ranking officers.\n\nIn total, almost 400 vehicles were produced for the Czechoslovak army.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1936\n\nModel AV\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1936\n\nEnd of Production 1937\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nLength 5130 mm\n\nWidth 1810 mm\n\nHeight 1900 mm\n\nWeight 2180 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling water\n\nCapacity 3468 ccm, 210.6 cu-in\n\nBore 80.0 mm, 3.15 in\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Praga AV\n\nMax power 51,5 kW (70k) / 2 600 rpm\n\nGearbox 3+1\n\nMaximum speed 90 km/h, 56 mph\n\nPraga Lady\n\nPraga Lady was developed as a substitute for an older model Piccolo 307. The company stayed true to their traditional focus and aimed to offer reliability, glance and solid power. In booklets we can also spot an emphasis on moderate fuel consumption, low cost of spare parts, fair durability and a favorable price. Lady was produced in three main types: as a four-seat tudor, four-seat and four-door sedan and a two-door convertible. A special and interesting roadster was also made in by the manufacturer Oldřich Uhlík in Prague-Strašnice (see the main photo). This vehicle employed the chassis of the second series and featured a dynamic coachwork with prolonged flowing curves in the back of the vehicle.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1935\n\nModel Lady\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1935\n\nEnd of Production 1937\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type roadster\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nWheelbase 2650 mm, 104.3 in\n\nFront track 1230 mm, 48.4 in\n\nRear track 1260 mm, 49.6 in\n\nLength 4180 mm, 164.6 in\n\nWidth 1600 mm, 63 in\n\nHeight 1580 mm, 62.2 in\n\nWeight 1200 kg, 2646 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1661 ccm, 100.9 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nMax power 26.0 / 35.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 110 km/h, 68 mph\n\nPraga Baby\n\nA new model of Baby is born in 1935 and is in production until 1937. After this year it is replaced with a new Piccollo P31.\n\nPraga Baby proved to be very popular even abroad: over 10% of this model were sold into a number of European states, partly because of the good credit that Baby acquired on international showrooms and in racing competitions. Czech students embarked successfully on a journey to Little Asia, local engineer Moravec travelled in this vehicle FOR over 10 000 kilometers, Baby visited the city of Athens and even reached the roads in Alps. Praga produced the total number of 4 203 “Babies”.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1936\n\nModel Baby\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1935\n\nEnd of Production 1937\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type cabrio, convertible\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2540 mm, 100 in\n\nFront track 1125 mm, 44.3 in\n\nRear track 1170 mm, 46.1 in\n\nLength 3680 mm, 144.9 in\n\nWidth 1420 mm, 55.9 in\n\nHeight 1450 mm, 57.1 in\n\nWeight 860 kg, 1896 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 995 ccm, 60.4 cu-in\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 88.0 mm, 3.465 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 × Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 16.0 / 22.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nThe period following the Great Depression is characterized by continuous modernization of production technologies. Therefore, the chassis and coachwork of the “American type” has been modernized already in 1934. This was done similarly as in the case of Piccolo 205. These vehicles are then introduced to the market in two series 306 and 307.\n\nThe production of Praga Piccolo is help up until 1937. However, two new types emerge in its position. The “classic” compact Piccolo is replaced by Praga Baby and the “American” Piccolo is substituted by Super Piccolo. This gives the company some time to come up with a new uniform design and general modernization of Piccolo, Lady, Alfa and Golden types.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1934\n\nModel Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1934\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type sedan\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2500 mm, 98.4 in\n\nFront track 1250 mm, 49.2 in\n\nRear track 1270 mm, 50 in\n\nLength 4150 mm, 163.4 in\n\nWidth 1500 mm, 59.1 in\n\nHeight 1630 mm, 64.2 in\n\nWeight 1030 kg, 2271 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1447 ccm, 87.9 cu-in\n\nBore 70.0 mm, 2.756 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 21.0 / 28.0 at 3000 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga Super Piccolo\n\nIn 1934, a need arose to upgrade current models. Therefore, two new vehicles were developed: Super Piccolo which replaced the mid-size “American Piccolo” and Praga Baby which replaced the Piccolo compact. Super Piccolo was based on Piccolo model but acquired many enhancements and generally adjusted to the needs of that time. New, 35 horsepower engine had the capacity of 1660 ccm and had rubber bushings which prevented transmission of vibrations onto the frame and coachwork of the vehicle.\n\nSeveral sports prototypes were manufactured, one of which should have participated in Thousand Miles of Czechoslovakia, a very prestigious race at the time. However, Petr Mucha, Praga’s driver and factory engineer, suffered a fatal accident during the preparation for this racing event. Praga changed their policy and after this unfortunate incident no factory teams and vehicles were allowed to participate in racing competitions.\n\nThe model was available as a four-seat sedan and convertible. In total, 6 460 vehicles of this model were manufactured by the company.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1934\n\nModel Super Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1936\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type sedan, convertible or limousine\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2700 mm, 106.3 in\n\nFront track 1250 mm, 49.2 in\n\nRear track 1270 mm, 50 in\n\nLength 4450 mm, 175.2 in\n\nWidth 1570 mm, 61.8 in\n\nHeight 1655 mm, 65.2 in\n\nWeight 1030 kg, 2271 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1660 ccm, 100.9 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nMax power 26.0 / 35.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga Golden\n\nPraga Golden was a luxury vehicle formerly presented under the name “Super Alfa”. In the end the company has decided to change the name to “Golden” – for the model was meant as a successor to Praga Grand (production of which has stopped during the Great Depression). Golden was developed as a luxury or parade car which was available at a lower price than similar vehicles of foreign manufacturers. This has demonstrated high standards of Czech automobile production. The Czechoslovak Republic purchased two vehicles for parade purposes and even the president Edvard Beneš himself used an altered cabriolet version of this vehicle. The first series of this model was produced in 1935.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1935\n\nModel Golden\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1935\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3500 mm, 137.8 in\n\nLength 5800 mm, 228.3 in\n\nWidth 1840 mm, 72.4 in\n\nWeight 1930 kg, 4255 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 3468 ccm, 210.6 cu-in\n\nBore 80.0 mm, 3.15 in\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 x Stromberg\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 50.0 / 68.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M3 + O\n\nMaximum speed 120 km/h\n\nPraga Baby\n\nP Praga Baby was introduced to the public in 1934 and is a typical representative of contemporary tendencies after the Great Depression. The purpose of this model was to offer a reliable yet low-cost vehicle with fashionable design. An already known engine of Piccolo 203 was used on a brand new chassis and frame (made of two C-shaped components). Movements of each wheel were independent on each other because of the enhanced half-axles; therefore the vehicle coped much better with rough and bumpy roads in general.\n\nBaby’s popularity is also owed to its advertisement. Lída Baarová, a famous Czech actress at the time, was casted as a protagonist in a movie about this very car. In 1934, Praga produced the total of 750 vehicles in four series. Praga Baby was available as a two-seat roadster, four-seat cabriolet and four-seat tudor.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1934\n\nModel Baby\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1934\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type cabrio, convertible\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2540 mm\n\nWeight 860 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 995 cm³\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 88.0 mm\n\nMax power 16.0 kW / PS at 3200rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h\n\nPraga P-1\n\nPraga P-1 was a light tank vehicle which was manufactured serially for the use of the Czechoslovak army since the year 1933. However, this model did not prove to be very successful or even useful and so it did not participate in any combat (leaving aside its possible involvement in the Slovak National Uprising at the end of the war) ; P-1 was therefore used mainly as a training vehicle for future tank operators. Vehicle was armoured (4-12 mm) and equipped with two ZB mk. 26 machine guns. Owing to its nature, the vehicle got many nicknames with “sardine” being one of them.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1933\n\nModel P-1\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1933\n\nEnd of Production 1934\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tank\n\nNumber of doors 1\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nWeight 2500 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nCapacity 1950 ccm\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Praga ANH\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 31.0 (23.5 kW)at 3000 rpm\n\nGearbox 4\n\nPraga TO\n\nPraga TN (TND in an option with a spark-ignition engine) was a heavy truck vehicle produced by the company in the 1930s. TN’s were usually employed as buses (which were able accommodate up to 50 passengers) or flatbed trucks.\n\nPraga also produced type TO truck in the years 1933 – 1938. This remains the single largest model ever manufactured by the company. Most TOs were used as buses for purposes of public transport which were able to accommodate up to 90 passengers; the flatbed truck option was also available. In the last two years of the production, two special coaches were produced with a more aerodynamic and fashionable design.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel Praga TO\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1933\n\nEnd of Production 1938\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 47\n\nLength 9000 mm\n\nWidth 2300 mm\n\nGross vehicle weight 10 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 11 536 cm³\n\nBore 120 mm\n\nStroke 170 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor Zenith 48 ULSW\n\nMax power 90 kW / 1400 rpm\n\nGearbox 4+Z\n\nMaximum speed 55 km/h, 34 mph\n\nPraga TNSPE\n\nPraga ventured also to the field of production of military and armoured vehicles. First ones were armoured options of types R and L, employed during the WWI and produced from 1916 to 1922. Their bodywork consisted of plates of armour (6 mm) and a turret equipped with a heavy machine gun or a cannon.\n\nThe company continued with production of an armoured vehicle type TNSPE in the first half of the 1930s. This vehicle was based on a TN truck type and was not strictly speaking a military vehicle: TNSPE was designated for Romanian police force as a vehicle purposed to maintain peace and quiet in the streets of Bucharest. Therefore, TNSPE was equipped with a water gun able to shoot as far as 45 metres and an armour plates (4 – 8 mm) protecting the operators of the vehicle. A machine gun was added next to the water cannon for extreme cases. Police used these vehicles to control demonstrations and later, during the WWII, also as to aid the Romanian fire brigade.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1932\n\nModel TNSPE\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1932\n\nEnd of Production 1934\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type truck\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nWeight 1200 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 7800 cm³\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor\n\nMax power 79 kW (105 k)\n\nGearbox 4\n\nMaximum speed 50 km/h\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nThe “classic” Piccolo with 1-litre engine was modified in 1932 with main alternations concerning the technical aspects of the vehicle. Another change concerns labels of each series. This happens because of simultaneous production of two types of Piccolo model: this “classic” one and the “American” type. Models P201 – P205 are produced in the period of three years. Noteworthy changes are made in the design of the car: the trunk is for the first time an actual part of the coachwork, thus making it accessible both from the inside and the outside. Several elements of the design are also adjusted to the needs of the time and the vehicle still does give a dynamic and elegant look.\n\nOver 2 000 vehicles were produced in the period of three years. “Classic Piccolos” were supposed to satisfy the demand of compact cars. In 1934 they were substituted in this manner with a brand new type Praga Baby. Piccolos return into production in 1937.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1933\n\nModel Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1932\n\nEnd of Production 1934\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tudor\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nWheelbase 2500 mm, 98.4 in\n\nFront track 1190 mm, 46.9 in\n\nRear track 1200 mm, 47.2 in\n\nLength 3930 mm, 154.7 in\n\nWidth 1500 mm, 59.1 in\n\nHeight 1550 mm, 61 in\n\nWeight 980 kg, 2161 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 995 ccm, 60.4 cu-in\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 88.0 mm, 3.465 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 16.0 / 22.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 85 km/h, 53 mph\n\nPraga E-39\n\nThe Great Depression left its mark on the beginning of the 1930s. Praga had to adapt its production to the new circumstances caused by the crisis. This transfer was eased when a new American tender emerged: the demand for new taxicabs for New York City. Praga decided to join only few European companies and participate in this tender. The task was entrusted to young engineer Petránek who designed a vehicle especially tailored to the needs of this American metropolis. Praga has succeeded in the competition and almost happened to be the first European manufacturer to make it to US market. Unfortunately, the company could not fulfil the terms of the tender because an instant delivery of all the vehicles was demanded – and the number of required vehicles was much higher than the actual capacity of production of all Praga’s factories per year.\n\nAnd so in 1932 a new model under the nickname “American Piccolo” was introduced to the domestic market. According to Praga’s leaflets, this model provided “the comfort comparable to American cars.” Over 600 vehicles were produced during the years 1932 and 1933.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1932\n\nModel Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1932\n\nEnd of Production 1933\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type cabrio, convertible\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nLength 3960 mm\n\nWeight 980 kg, 2161 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1447 ccm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nMaximum speed 90 km/h, 56 mph\n\nPraga E-39\n\nThe very first Praga’s original airplane construction was a success and was also the first to be put into a serial production. After their arrival to the new ČKD Praga aircraft factory, engineers Beneš and Hajn began the development of a biplane designated for the training of new pilots. Prototype BH-39 had its first flight on June 1931. The number in its name represented 39th model constructed by Beneš-Hajn duo (previous ones were manufactured in Avia factory). The name changed with to E-39 (the government assigned the label “E” for all Praga’s aircrafts) in 1933 and the serial production of the biplane began. In total, 139 airplanes were produced. The majority of these planes used Walter Gema nine-cylinder engine with power of 103 kW. E-39s were designed both for military and civilian purposes; during the war, E-39 were in service of Slovak Republic and German Luftwaffe.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1934\n\nModel E-39\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1931\n\nEnd of Production 1934\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type biplane\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 6.88 m\n\nWidth 9.88 m\n\nHeight 2.54 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 9\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system Walter NZ-120\n\nMax power 89.4 kW (119.9 hp)\n\nMaximum speed 170 km/h (106 mph)\n\nPraga 350 BCS\n\nPraga 350 BCS represented a lighter alternative to a relatively robust 500 BDS. It was finished by J. F. Koch in 1930. Alas, the timing was quite unlucky, mainly because of two reasons: the Great Depression and severe competition in this field by other Czechoslovak companies. However, 350 BCS represented probably the most elegant domestic motorbike owing to its unique design inspired by English models.\n\nOver 1000 models were manufactured during three years. The production ended in 1935 and their main constructor J.F. Koch leaves the company during the very same year. Koch ventured to run his own business at first but then moved to ČZ Strakonice where he constructed the popular “Čezeta” scooter.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1930\n\nModel 350 BCS\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1930\n\nEnd of Production 1935\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 2130 mm\n\nWidth 860 mm\n\nHeight 1000 mm\n\nWeight 1400 mm\n\nCurb vehicle weight 140 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 1\n\nCooling air\n\nCapacity 3468 cm³\n\nBore 70.0 mm, 2.756 in\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nFuel system carburretor\n\nMax power 12 kW / 4500 rpm\n\nGearbox 3\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga SND (SNDgs)\n\nTwo heavy truck vehicles SND (sometimes called simply SN as for “Silný Nákladní”, “Strong Truck”) were manufactured by the company in 1933. Gradually, these vehicles were submitted to a number of tests which led to a larger serial production. As in the case of other Praga’s heavy truck vehicles, SND was produced mainly as a flatbed truck and a bus; with the latter being able to accommodate up to 35 sitting passengers with more space for standing ones.\n\nIn the years 1939 – 1940, 200 vehicles SNDgs were produced, with integrated Janka and Imbert wood gas generators. In total, more than 550 vehicles were produced.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1939\n\nModel SND (SNDgs)\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1933\n\nEnd of Production 1941\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nGross vehicle weight 5 t\n\nCargo area dimensions 4100 × 2200 mm\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 6754 cm³\n\nBore 105 mm\n\nStroke 130 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor\n\nMax power 67.5 kW / 2000 rpm\n\nGearbox 4\n\nMaximum speed 50 km/h\n\nPraga 500 BDS\n\nPraga participated in the production of motorcycles only shortly, during the years 1927 – 1935.The production was led by J. F. Koch, Praga’s construction engineer who gained his know-how during his years in Laurin and Clement factories. His abilities later improved during his work in an aircraft manufacturing factory Aviatik in Vienna during the WWI. Koch himself also successfully finished a voyage from Rome to Prague in a record time of only 35 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nPraga 500 BDS was based on several motorbikes labelled “BD 500” which were manufactured from 1927. However, they were never produced in a serial manner with almost each motorcycle different in some aspects. Serial production of 500 BDS started in the year 1928; the model was produced solo and with a sidecar (which added 100 kg to the bike, with total weight of 270 kg). The second option was widely popular and so the company provided both one-seat and two-seat alternatives of the sidecar.\n\nPraga 500 BDS was manufactured in five series with over 1800 models produced in total. Several individual bikes were also commissioned in a non-serial way after 1932.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1928\n\nModel 500 BDS\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nWheelbase 1425 mm\n\nWeight 170 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 1\n\nCooling air\n\nBore 84 mm\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nValve gear 2xOHC\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburretor\n\nMax power 11 kW / 4400 rpm\n\nGearbox 3\n\nMaximum speed 105 km/h\n\nPraga Grand\n\nThe fourteenth series of Praga Grand was introduced in 1927 and represented one of the highest achievements of Praga’s automobile production. With an eight-cylinder engine and first-class equipment, this model acquired nickname “Rolls-Royce of Czechoslovakia.” High quality was evident both in the exterior and interior of the car: all seats were covered with leather (alternatively with cloth and plush in sedan) which included spare seats hidden behind the driver; the floor was covered with plush. Windows could be manually lowered by crack handles and because of nifty glass shelters, it was possible to ventilate in any weather. The windshield was equipped with automatic wipers. The passengers had at their disposal a telephone connecting them with the driver, small storage compartments, electric lighter with ashtrays and handy hangers.\n\nThe production continued for three years until 1929 and was reinstated in 1931. Unfortunately, the demand for luxury cars drastically decreased during the period of depression and therefore the production ultimately stopped in 1932. In total, 1 196 vehicles Praga Grand were produced; 897 with four-cylinder engines and 299 with eight-cylinder engines.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1929\n\nModel Grand\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1927\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 7\n\nWheelbase 3450 mm, 135.8 in\n\nLength 5025 mm, 197.8 in\n\nWidth 1650 mm, 65 in\n\nHeight 1810 mm, 71.3 in\n\nWeight 1930 kg, 4255 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 8\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 3582 ccm, 217.6 cu-in\n\nBore 72.0 mm, 2.835 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 2 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 51.0 / 70.0 at 3000 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 120 km/h, 75 mph\n\nPraga MN, LN\n\nPraga’s LN and MN models represent two types of light and utility trucks which were produced in relatively low numbers (507 vehicles of the MN type and 1.050 vehicles of the LN type). Their employment, however, was various and both these models proved to be able to carry out multiple tasks. Praga MN (1926 – 1928) was based on the Mignon model and Praga LN (1932 – 1940) was based primarily on the chassis of a similar truck Praga AN. Both vehicles were produced in many variations which included box vans and buses. We also have MN fire trucks still preserved today.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel LN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1926\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 30 TGH\n\nPraga AN\n\nPraga AN was a light truck based on the Alfa series which was very popular among small businessmen. Its title is a simple acronym of “Alfa Nákladní” meaning “Freight Alfa”. It was also unofficially referred to as “anka” between its users. In the beginning of the production, AN was more of a van than a truck but the customers gradually demanded larger vehicle and so its dimensions grew with the years of its production (as it was in the case of a parallel production of Alfa model). Growing along the dimensions was the gross vehicle weight and engine power.\n\nIn total, approximately five and a half thousand vehicles were produced in 23 series from 1924 to 1940. This number included several modifications, including f.e. 330 small bus vehicles Praga AO which were able to accommodate 15 sitting passengers.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel Praga AN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1924\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nFront track 1230 mm, 48.4 in\n\nLength 4710\n\nWidth 1650\n\nGross vehicle weight 1 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 26 HAK\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 16.0 kW / PS at 2800 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nPraga N\n\nPraga N, constructed in 1915, was a successor to older heavy truck models V and T. The production continued without any substantial changes until 1930. During the following year, Praga N’s both engine and exterior were modernized to suit better contemporary requirements. N type was mainly manufactured as a flatbed truck and bus vehicle (as was the case of other Praga vehicles in this category) but many other options were available; these included tank and dumper truck, fire trucks and sweeper trucks. Praga N was a favourite option both for private companies and individuals and in public sector where Ns were employed mostly for military and municipal services.\n\nThe N type was in production for stunning 24 years in 23 series in total. More than two thousand vehicles were manufactured and several types NB, ND, NO and NO-D were derived from the basic N type.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1925\n\nModel N\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1915\n\nEnd of Production 1938\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 7140 mm\n\nWidth 2200 mm\n\nGross vehicle weight 5 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 7 487 ccm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor zenith 42 HAK\n\nMax power 36.7 kW (50 k) / 1500 rpm\n\nGearbox 4\n\nMaximum speed 30 km/h\n\nPraga L & LD\n\nLight truck and utility vehicle called simply “L” was produced by Praga in the years preceding the First World War. Its production continued until 1931 when it was replaced by an enhanced “LD” type which was then manufactured until 1936. With curb weight 2.900 kilograms this vehicle was able to carry the weight of 3.000 kilograms, its maximum speed reached 35 km/h and average fuel consumption was approximately 42 l/km. Praga L was employed both in public and military sector.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1920\n\nModel L (LD)\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1912\n\nEnd of Production 1936\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 5650 mm\n\nWidth 2000 mm\n\nWeight 1200 kg, 2646 lb\n\nGross vehicle weight 1.5 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 3816 cm³\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 42HAK\n\nMax power 21.0 kW / at 1000 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nPraga RND\n\nAn interesting derivation of the RN type is represented in Praga RND. This model differs mainly in its compression-ignition engine which proved to be a popular choice amongst the customers at that time; the main reason being its lower consumption of fuel.\n\nThe production of this model continued until 1955, with the engine being gradually improved. RND was regularly produced as a pick-up truck, van and a dumper truck. It was also produced as a bus and a field hospital (for military purposes) in a small series in 1951. The total number of produced vehicles is almost reaching the number of 17 000 RNDs.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1950\n\nModel RND\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1955\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nGross vehicle weight 3500 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 4154 cm³\n\nValve gear SV\n\nMax power 44.5 kW / 2000 rpm\n\nPraga RN\n\nPraga RN (“Rychlý Nákladní”, Czech for “Rapid truck”) was for a certain time company’s main representative in the category of medium trucks. RN remained in production for remarkable 20 years without being substantially modified. In total, almost 24 thousand vehicles were manufactured. The vehicle was produced in various options, including civil and military trucks, ambulance cars, vans, tank or dumper trucks and even mobile workrooms.\n\nRN type also ventured abroad: in the early 1930s a tender competition was announced by TAM – a Yugoslavian car manufacturer. TAM was seeking a licence on production of medium trucks suitable for local conditions. Praga’s RNs successfully surpassed all the other competitors and was therefore the obvious choice for the Yugoslavian company in question. TAM produced a vast number of 50 thousands vehicles under the marking RN-TP in factories in Rakovica and Maribor. This foreign production contributed both the good reputation of Praga In other countries and to extensive motorization of Balkan area.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1949\n\nModel RN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1933\n\nEnd of Production 1953\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nLength 6775 mm\n\nGross vehicle weight 3500 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 3468 cm³\n\nBore 80.0 mm, 3.15 in\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor Praga Diflex 42\n\nMax power 54.0 at 3000rpm\n\nGearbox 4+1\n\nPraga E-114\n\nPraga’s aircraft section (very much like the whole Czechoslovak industry) was under the Nazi administration during their occupation of the Republic. After the war, the whole production focused on civilian needs of the post-war years. Following the success of Air Baby, a decision was made to modernize this very plane and restart the production of Praga E-114. The first prototype had its first flight in October 1946 (Praga E-114D) and was powered by Praga D four-cylinder engine with power of 48 kW. The second version (Praga E-114M) received a brand new engine Walter Mikron III which also altered the visage of the plane as well. In total, 126 aircrafts E-114 were manufactured for domestic air clubs and for export purposes as well.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1947\n\nModel E-114\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1946\n\nEnd of Production 1947\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type high-wing monoplane\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 7.05 m\n\nHeight 2.4 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system Walter Mikron III\n\nMax power 48 kW\n\nMaximum speed 187 km/h\n\nPraga RV\n\nPraga RV, a fast military all-terrain truck, was the most plentiful military vehicle in the Czechoslovak army in the times preceding the WWII. Army obtained more than 2000 vehicles in the years 1935 to 1938 and employed them for logistic purposes as well as for transport of light artillery and flak cannons. Sixty RV vehicles were modified in 1938 to mobile radio-vehicles with new name RVR. These vehicles became a symbol of the growing crisis in the pre-war period because a vast number of photographs of RVs with Czechoslovak soldiers about to be deployed to nation’s border against Third Reich’s forces flooded the press at that time.\n\nPraga RV was remarkable mostly for its swift operation in even difficult off-road conditions. The vehicle participated successfully in many competitions and was subsequently demanded by armies of Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, Iran, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel RV\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1935\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type truck\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 5690 mm\n\nWidth 2000 mm\n\nHeight 2900 mm\n\nWeight 3810 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling water\n\nCapacity 3468 cm³\n\nBore 80.0 mm, 3.15 in\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Praga SV\n\nMax power 50 kW / 2000 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 70 km/h, 44 mph\n\nPraga T6\n\nPraga engaged in manufacturing of caterpillar tractors in the year 1925. These vehicles were primarily designed for army purposes: transport of heavy artillery and other logistic purposes in the difficult conditions of the battlefield. Praga’s first model MT was based on a French model (Renault FT) and following BD series was based on a German Hanomag product. Therefore, the first company’s own construction is Praga T II which was introduced in 1935 and was in production in several series until 1944. The Second World War meant a great demand for this type of vehicles and that is the reason that most of the series were produced simultaneously during these years. It is hard to estimate the total number of produced vehicles because of the extreme circumstances; that is even the case of the most popular series, T 6. Production of the T series was followed by Praga HT, a caterpillar tractor for civil purposes which was in production from 1943 to 1951.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1937\n\nModel T 6\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1935\n\nEnd of Production 1944\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type caterpillar tractor\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nLength 4800 mm, 189 in\n\nWidth 1800 mm\n\nHeight 1700 mm\n\nWeight 7050 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 7754 cm³\n\nBore 105 mm\n\nStroke 150 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Praga N\n\nMax power 67.5 kW / 1800 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 31 km/h\n\nPraga AH-IV\n\nLight tank vehicle Praga AH-IV was based on the previous prototype TNH and was manufactured in factories Českomoravská-Kolben-Daněk since 1936. AH-IV proved to be a popular type on the international scale for it was employed in several foreign armies during the WWII. This included armies of Romania (36 tanks), Sweden (49 tanks) and Iran (51 tanks). After the war, 20 models were also manufactured for the Ethiopian army. The vehicle was armed with one heavy machine gun on the turret and a light machine gun next to the driver.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1936\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1936\n\nEnd of Production 1950\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tank\n\nNumber of doors 1\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 3 000 mm\n\nWidth 1 750 mm\n\nHeight 1 380 mm\n\nWeight 3 000 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 2492 ccm, 151.4 cu-in\n\nFuel system Praga AH\n\nMax power 33,1 kW / 3000 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 40 km/h\n\nPraga Alfa\n\nThe 23rd series of Alfa model was introduced in 1937.This year also represents the last stage in production of this model (although Alfas were produced up 1942). The standard coachwork had four seats (six seats in the limousine) and eight windows with safety shatter-proof glass. The last 25th series was also equipped with a car radio Motorola and with Heates heating system. Last years of Alfa production can therefore be considered a swansong for the whole production of this model: an elegant vehicle with first-rate equipment. Several Alfas were also used as police vehicles equipped with light machine guns operated from the back seat.\n\nLast Alfa vehicle was produced in 1942 and in total the company produced 9 253 cars of this model.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type cabrio, convertible, limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3250 mm, 128 in\n\nLength 5200 mm, 204.7 in\n\nWidth 1660 mm, 65.4 in\n\nWeight 1620 kg, 3572 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 2492 ccm, 151.4 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 x Solex\n\nMax power 44.0 / 60.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 110 km/h, 68 mph\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nLast six series (P 31 – P 36) of Piccolo vehicles are launched in the years 1937–1941. The engine was equipped with an aluminium cylinder head, the liquid cooling was propelled by a pump and was provided with a thermostat. Single dry clutch was secured by peripheral springs which also muffled engine vibrations. Besides the standard model there was also a four-seat cabriolet and roadster. The most employed modifications were small pickups and box vans.\n\nOver three thousand vehicles were sold in the course of five years, thus making “Piccolos” the most popular model of all Praga’s car production. An impressive number of nearly eighteen thousand Piccolo vehicles were sold in total.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1939\n\nModel Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1941\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tudor, convertible, roadster\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2630 mm, 103.5 in\n\nFront track 1180 mm, 46.5 in\n\nRear track 1240 mm, 48.8 in\n\nLength 4120 mm, 162.2 in\n\nWidth 1500 mm, 59.1 in\n\nHeight 1485 mm, 58.5 in\n\nWeight 960 kg, 2116 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1128 ccm, 68.5 cu-in\n\nBore 65.0 mm, 2.559 in\n\nStroke 85.0 mm, 3.346 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 21.0 / 28.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nThe 8th series of Praga Piccolo started the production of the “classic” version of the vehicle which is the most famous one and probably the most praised as well. This version continued to be in production for five more years until the 20th series (with 500 cars produced in each series). With new series more modifications were made regarding the engine, carburettor, tyres and coachwork. In 1930, a useful pickup version “Normandy” (also used with the Alfa type) was introduced and became quickly popular amongst small businessmen. Normandy proved helpful to the police force which commissioned 50 vehicles in the pickup version with small seats in the cargo area of the vehicle. Another interesting example is specially modified vehicle advertising Hašlerky, very popular candy at that time (and even today).\n\nMost regular Piccolo vehicles were however the two / four-door limousine and phaeton.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1930\n\nModel Poccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1932\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type convertible, limousine, faeton\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2600 mm, 102.4 in\n\nLength 3870 mm, 152.4 in\n\nWidth 1450 mm, 57.1 in\n\nHeight 1550 mm, 61 in\n\nWeight 930 kg, 2050 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nCapacity 995 ccm, 60.4 cu-in\n\nBore 60.0 mm, 2.362 in\n\nStroke 88.0 mm, 3.465 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 15.0 / 21.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 85 km/h, 53 mph\n\nPraga Lady\n\nPraga Lady with the sixth series acquired a new five-door four-seat dynamic coachwork with previously employed chassis. Modifications were also of technical nature: apart from well-tried carburettor Zenith, “Ladies” were equipped also with Solex ATJP and Solex AIC and later with a German version of Zenith under the name of Diflex 30.\n\nPraga Lady was primarily used as an automobile for personal use but proved to be also very useful as a ambulance, open pick-up and a van. An interesting prototype was made in 1940: an enlarged ambulance car with a chubby look. Almost four thousands Praga Lady vehicles were produced in eight series and in 1947 the production of Lady was done – as well as the production of other automobile models. From then on, Praga’s focus of production lied in different areas.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel Lady\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1938\n\nEnd of Production 1947\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type roadster\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2650 mm, 104.3 in\n\nFront track 1230 mm, 48.4 in\n\nRear track 1260 mm, 49.6 in\n\nLength 4180 mm, 164.6 in\n\nWidth 1600 mm, 63 in\n\nHeight 1580 mm, 62.2 in\n\nWeight 1200 kg, 2646 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1661 ccm, 100.9 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith, (Solex ATJP and Solex AIC, Diflex 30)\n\nMax power 26.0 / 35.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 110 km/h, 68 mph\n\nPraga LT vz. 38\n\nPraga began the production of tank vehicles in 1933 and constructed several models. These efforts were finished with type LT mk. 38. This light tank was successful in an open competition of the Czechoslovak armed forces and the army ordered 150 tank vehicles in 1939 – this competition was caused of course by the circumstances of these troubled times. Unfortunately, this was also the year of the occupation by German forces and the commission of these vehicles was taken over by the Third Reich. Germans produced the tank in Czech factories under marking “PzKpfw 38“ and manufactured hundreds of these vehicles. LT mk. 38 was considered one of the best tanks of the world in the year of its production, but this changed with the technological advancement caused by the war itself. Therefore, at the end of the war, LT mk. 38 represented quite an ordinary vehicle and the new Czechoslovak army handled only 31 of these light tanks.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1939\n\nModel LT vz. 38\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1938\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tank\n\nNumber of doors 1\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nFront track 1 860 mm\n\nLength 4510 mm\n\nWidth 2080 mm\n\nHeight 2240 mm\n\nWeight 9000 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 7754 ccm\n\nBore 110 mm\n\nStroke 130 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system OHV Praga AC\n\nMax power 109 kw (145 hp) / 2400 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 42 km/h\n\nPraga AT\n\nPraga began with the production of tractor vehicles in 1928 and replaced the previous production of motor-ploughs. Tractors therefore stand for the second phase of modernization of agricultural production generally. Tractor Praga AT was a small machine powered by an engine with capacity of 1.947 ccm and power 16.5 kW at 1.800 rpm. The tractor was ideal for both road and field surfaces – and had option of wheels specially designed for ploughing purposes. Tractors were a popular choice mainly among medium-size farmers who generally represented the progressive current in the agricultural area of life in the First Czechoslovak republic. In total, over 500 Praga AT tractor vehicles were produced in Praga’s factories. Other tractors developed by the company were models BDk (1928 – 1932) and KT (1929 – 1930).\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1928\n\nModel AT\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type traktor\n\nNumber of seats 1\n\nLength 2815 mm\n\nWidth 1560 mm\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1947 ccm\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Zenith 30 K\n\nMax power 20 HP / 1400\n\nMaximum speed 20 km/h\n\nPraga Alfa\n\nNew series of Alfa (i.e. series 17-21) kept six-cylinder engine of previous series but with alterations especially in capacity and power. In 1930, a new pickup “Normandy” was introduced and proved to be very popular especially among small businesses.\n\nPraga vehicles competed in many racing events during the 1930s. Alfa models were no exception; in 1932, two modified vehicles of this model were produced especially for the factory engineer and racer Petr Mucha. Racing duo Mucha-Urban then participated in the first official race “1000 miles of Czechoslovakia” and won with a stunning average speed of 84 km/h on open roads.\n\nThe second stage of Alfa production was completed with only one vehicle prototype in 1933. Developed as an ambulance car it included many adjustments and modifications. These adjustments were used later on during production of standard ambulance cars on Super Piccolo and Lady chassis.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1932\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1929\n\nEnd of Production 1933\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type sedan\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 2900 mm, 114.2 in\n\nLength 4355 mm, 171.5 in\n\nWidth 1530 mm, 60.2 in\n\nWeight 1320 kg, 2910 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1792 ccm, 108.8 cu-in\n\nBore 65.0 mm, 2.559 in\n\nStroke 90.0 mm, 3.543 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 26.0 / 36.0 at 3200 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 90 km/h, 56 mph\n\nPraga E-1\n\nThe CZAL (Aero) factory at Karlin, led by Jaroslav Slechta, developed the XE-1 two-seat helicopter project in 1947, fitted with twin inter-meshing rotors and a 100hp Praga M-197 engine. This led to the XE-II (OK-FYA) which flew on 14 December 1949. It was an open single-seater with a single three-blade main rotor and 75hp Praga D engine.\n\nA model of this project worked out at Karlin was shown at Brussels in July 1947. It had two intermeshing two-bladed rotors, the hubs of which were very close together. Also provided was a tricycle landing gear with the rear wheels directly below the twin vertical fins.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1947\n\nModel E-1\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1947\n\nEnd of Production 1947\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type helicopter\n\nNumber of doors 1\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 5920 mm\n\nHeight 3600 mm\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nFuel system M-107\n\nMax power 81.0 kW\n\nMaximum speed 145 km/h\n\nPraga E-114\n\nPraga’s aircraft section (very much like the whole Czechoslovak industry) was under the Nazi administration during their occupation of the Republic. After the war, the whole production focused on civilian needs of the post-war years. Following the success of Air Baby, a decision was made to modernize this very plane and restart the production of Praga E-114. The first prototype had its first flight in October 1946 (Praga E-114D) and was powered by Praga D four-cylinder engine with power of 48 kW. The second version (Praga E-114M) received a brand new engine Walter Mikron III which also altered the visage of the plane as well. In total, 126 aircrafts E-114 were manufactured for domestic air clubs and for export purposes as well.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1947\n\nModel E-114\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1946\n\nEnd of Production 1947\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type high-wing monoplane\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 7.05 m\n\nHeight 2.4 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system Walter Mikron III\n\nMax power 48 kW\n\nMaximum speed 187 km/h\n\nPraga LT vz. 38\n\nPraga began the production of tank vehicles in 1933 and constructed several models. These efforts were finished with type LT mk. 38. This light tank was successful in an open competition of the Czechoslovak armed forces and the army ordered 150 tank vehicles in 1939 – this competition was caused of course by the circumstances of these troubled times. Unfortunately, this was also the year of the occupation by German forces and the commission of these vehicles was taken over by the Third Reich. Germans produced the tank in Czech factories under marking “PzKpfw 38“ and manufactured hundreds of these vehicles. LT mk. 38 was considered one of the best tanks of the world in the year of its production, but this changed with the technological advancement caused by the war itself. Therefore, at the end of the war, LT mk. 38 represented quite an ordinary vehicle and the new Czechoslovak army handled only 31 of these light tanks.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1939\n\nModel LT vz. 38\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1938\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tank\n\nNumber of doors 1\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nFront track 1 860 mm\n\nLength 4510 mm\n\nWidth 2080 mm\n\nHeight 2240 mm\n\nWeight 9000 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 7754 ccm\n\nBore 110 mm\n\nStroke 130 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system OHV Praga AC\n\nMax power 109 kw (145 hp) / 2400 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 42 km/h\n\nPraga Lady\n\nPraga Lady with the sixth series acquired a new five-door four-seat dynamic coachwork with previously employed chassis. Modifications were also of technical nature: apart from well-tried carburettor Zenith, “Ladies” were equipped also with Solex ATJP and Solex AIC and later with a German version of Zenith under the name of Diflex 30.\n\nPraga Lady was primarily used as an automobile for personal use but proved to be also very useful as a ambulance, open pick-up and a van. An interesting prototype was made in 1940: an enlarged ambulance car with a chubby look. Almost four thousands Praga Lady vehicles were produced in eight series and in 1947 the production of Lady was done – as well as the production of other automobile models. From then on, Praga’s focus of production lied in different areas.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel Lady\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1938\n\nEnd of Production 1947\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type roadster\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2650 mm, 104.3 in\n\nFront track 1230 mm, 48.4 in\n\nRear track 1260 mm, 49.6 in\n\nLength 4180 mm, 164.6 in\n\nWidth 1600 mm, 63 in\n\nHeight 1580 mm, 62.2 in\n\nWeight 1200 kg, 2646 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCapacity 1661 ccm, 100.9 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith, (Solex ATJP and Solex AIC, Diflex 30)\n\nMax power 26.0 / 35.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 110 km/h, 68 mph\n\nPraga Piccolo\n\nLast six series (P 31 – P 36) of Piccolo vehicles are launched in the years 1937–1941. The engine was equipped with an aluminium cylinder head, the liquid cooling was propelled by a pump and was provided with a thermostat. Single dry clutch was secured by peripheral springs which also muffled engine vibrations. Besides the standard model there was also a four-seat cabriolet and roadster. The most employed modifications were small pickups and box vans.\n\nOver three thousand vehicles were sold in the course of five years, thus making “Piccolos” the most popular model of all Praga’s car production. An impressive number of nearly eighteen thousand Piccolo vehicles were sold in total.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1939\n\nModel Piccolo\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1941\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type tudor, convertible, roadster\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 4\n\nWheelbase 2630 mm, 103.5 in\n\nFront track 1180 mm, 46.5 in\n\nRear track 1240 mm, 48.8 in\n\nLength 4120 mm, 162.2 in\n\nWidth 1500 mm, 59.1 in\n\nHeight 1485 mm, 58.5 in\n\nWeight 960 kg, 2116 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1128 ccm, 68.5 cu-in\n\nBore 65.0 mm, 2.559 in\n\nStroke 85.0 mm, 3.346 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 21.0 / 28.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M4\n\nMaximum speed 100 km/h, 62 mph\n\nPraga Alfa\n\nThe 23rd series of Alfa model was introduced in 1937.This year also represents the last stage in production of this model (although Alfas were produced up 1942). The standard coachwork had four seats (six seats in the limousine) and eight windows with safety shatter-proof glass. The last 25th series was also equipped with a car radio Motorola and with Heates heating system. Last years of Alfa production can therefore be considered a swansong for the whole production of this model: an elegant vehicle with first-rate equipment. Several Alfas were also used as police vehicles equipped with light machine guns operated from the back seat.\n\nLast Alfa vehicle was produced in 1942 and in total the company produced 9 253 cars of this model.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel Alfa\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1937\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type cabrio, convertible, limousine\n\nNumber of doors 4\n\nNumber of seats 6\n\nWheelbase 3250 mm, 128 in\n\nLength 5200 mm, 204.7 in\n\nWidth 1660 mm, 65.4 in\n\nWeight 1620 kg, 3572 lb\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 2492 ccm, 151.4 cu-in\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 94.0 mm, 3.701 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburator, 1 x Solex\n\nMax power 44.0 / 60.0 at 3500 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nMaximum speed 110 km/h, 68 mph\n\nPraga T6\n\nPraga engaged in manufacturing of caterpillar tractors in the year 1925. These vehicles were primarily designed for army purposes: transport of heavy artillery and other logistic purposes in the difficult conditions of the battlefield. Praga’s first model MT was based on a French model (Renault FT) and following BD series was based on a German Hanomag product. Therefore, the first company’s own construction is Praga T II which was introduced in 1935 and was in production in several series until 1944. The Second World War meant a great demand for this type of vehicles and that is the reason that most of the series were produced simultaneously during these years. It is hard to estimate the total number of produced vehicles because of the extreme circumstances; that is even the case of the most popular series, T 6. Production of the T series was followed by Praga HT, a caterpillar tractor for civil purposes which was in production from 1943 to 1951.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1937\n\nModel T 6\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1935\n\nEnd of Production 1944\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type caterpillar tractor\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nLength 4800 mm, 189 in\n\nWidth 1800 mm\n\nHeight 1700 mm\n\nWeight 7050 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 7754 cm³\n\nBore 105 mm\n\nStroke 150 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Praga N\n\nMax power 67.5 kW / 1800 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 31 km/h\n\nPraga RV\n\nPraga RV, a fast military all-terrain truck, was the most plentiful military vehicle in the Czechoslovak army in the times preceding the WWII. Army obtained more than 2000 vehicles in the years 1935 to 1938 and employed them for logistic purposes as well as for transport of light artillery and flak cannons. Sixty RV vehicles were modified in 1938 to mobile radio-vehicles with new name RVR. These vehicles became a symbol of the growing crisis in the pre-war period because a vast number of photographs of RVs with Czechoslovak soldiers about to be deployed to nation’s border against Third Reich’s forces flooded the press at that time.\n\nPraga RV was remarkable mostly for its swift operation in even difficult off-road conditions. The vehicle participated successfully in many competitions and was subsequently demanded by armies of Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, Iran, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1938\n\nModel RV\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1935\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type truck\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 5690 mm\n\nWidth 2000 mm\n\nHeight 2900 mm\n\nWeight 3810 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling water\n\nCapacity 3468 cm³\n\nBore 80.0 mm, 3.15 in\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Praga SV\n\nMax power 50 kW / 2000 rpm\n\nMaximum speed 70 km/h, 44 mph\n\nPraga Air Baby (E-114)\n\nPraga E-114 is without any doubt the most famous aircraft ever produced by the company. After engineers Beneš and Hajn had left the company, Jaroslav Šlechta became the head of the construction and developed fighter biplane Praga E-45– however, there was a great supply of military contracts from other companies and it was very difficult to seize the opportunity. Moreover, this was happening in the climate of the Great Depression which was very inconvenient for the whole aircraft section of Praga. Luckily, the government issued a subsidized project 1000 pilots for the republic with the goal of training new pilots for domestic air clubs. This also meant an increase in production of airplanes suitable for these purposes. Therefore, Šlechta manufactured a brand new high-wing monoplane with two adjacent seats. This was Praga E-114, often also called Air Baby as a reference to Praga’s famous Baby automobile. Its first flight took place in 1934 and the plane soon gained popularity. This was also caused by its successes in flying competitions and the plane was soon demanded in both domestic and foreign air clubs. Step by step, Air Baby was exported to France, Iran, Romania and Great Britain. The UK even bought the licence for production of this model and manufactured the plane in a serial manner under the name Hilson Praga by F. Hills&Sons company in Manchester.\n\nIn total, 180 Air Babies were produced up until 1941.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1935\n\nModel Air Baby (E-114)\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1941\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type high-wing monoplane\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nLength 6,60 m\n\nWidth 11,00 m\n\nHeight 2.4 m\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 2\n\nCooling air\n\nFuel system Praga B\n\nMax power 30 kW (40 hp)\n\nMaximum speed 187 km/h\n\nPraga SND (SNDgs)\n\nTwo heavy truck vehicles SND (sometimes called simply SN as for “Silný Nákladní”, “Strong Truck”) were manufactured by the company in 1933. Gradually, these vehicles were submitted to a number of tests which led to a larger serial production. As in the case of other Praga’s heavy truck vehicles, SND was produced mainly as a flatbed truck and a bus; with the latter being able to accommodate up to 35 sitting passengers with more space for standing ones.\n\nIn the years 1939 – 1940, 200 vehicles SNDgs were produced, with integrated Janka and Imbert wood gas generators. In total, more than 550 vehicles were produced.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1939\n\nModel SND (SNDgs)\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1933\n\nEnd of Production 1941\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nGross vehicle weight 5 t\n\nCargo area dimensions 4100 × 2200 mm\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 6754 cm³\n\nBore 105 mm\n\nStroke 130 mm\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburretor\n\nMax power 67.5 kW / 2000 rpm\n\nGearbox 4\n\nMaximum speed 50 km/h\n\nPraga AN\n\nPraga AN was a light truck based on the Alfa series which was very popular among small businessmen. Its title is a simple acronym of “Alfa Nákladní” meaning “Freight Alfa”. It was also unofficially referred to as “anka” between its users. In the beginning of the production, AN was more of a van than a truck but the customers gradually demanded larger vehicle and so its dimensions grew with the years of its production (as it was in the case of a parallel production of Alfa model). Growing along the dimensions was the gross vehicle weight and engine power.\n\nIn total, approximately five and a half thousand vehicles were produced in 23 series from 1924 to 1940. This number included several modifications, including f.e. 330 small bus vehicles Praga AO which were able to accommodate 15 sitting passengers.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel Praga AN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1924\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\nFront track 1230 mm, 48.4 in\n\nLength 4710\n\nWidth 1650\n\nGross vehicle weight 1 t\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nValve gear SV\n\nValves per cylinder 2\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 26 HAK\n\nAspiration normal\n\nMax power 16.0 kW / PS at 2800 rpm\n\nGearbox M3\n\nPraga MN, LN\n\nPraga’s LN and MN models represent two types of light and utility trucks which were produced in relatively low numbers (507 vehicles of the MN type and 1.050 vehicles of the LN type). Their employment, however, was various and both these models proved to be able to carry out multiple tasks. Praga MN (1926 – 1928) was based on the Mignon model and Praga LN (1932 – 1940) was based primarily on the chassis of a similar truck Praga AN. Both vehicles were produced in many variations which included box vans and buses. We also have MN fire trucks still preserved today.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1926\n\nModel LN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1926\n\nEnd of Production 1940\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 2\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor, 1 x Zenith 30 TGH\n\nPraga AT\n\nPraga began with the production of tractor vehicles in 1928 and replaced the previous production of motor-ploughs. Tractors therefore stand for the second phase of modernization of agricultural production generally. Tractor Praga AT was a small machine powered by an engine with capacity of 1.947 ccm and power 16.5 kW at 1.800 rpm. The tractor was ideal for both road and field surfaces – and had option of wheels specially designed for ploughing purposes. Tractors were a popular choice mainly among medium-size farmers who generally represented the progressive current in the agricultural area of life in the First Czechoslovak republic. In total, over 500 Praga AT tractor vehicles were produced in Praga’s factories. Other tractors developed by the company were models BDk (1928 – 1932) and KT (1929 – 1930).\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1928\n\nModel AT\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1928\n\nEnd of Production 1942\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBody type traktor\n\nNumber of seats 1\n\nLength 2815 mm\n\nWidth 1560 mm\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nDrive wheel rear\n\nNumber of cylinders 4\n\nCooling liquid\n\nCapacity 1947 ccm\n\nBore 75.0 mm, 2.953 in\n\nStroke 110.0 mm, 4.331 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system Zenith 30 K\n\nMax power 20 HP / 1400\n\nMaximum speed 20 km/h\n\nPraga RND\n\nAn interesting derivation of the RN type is represented in Praga RND. This model differs mainly in its compression-ignition engine which proved to be a popular choice amongst the customers at that time; the main reason being its lower consumption of fuel.\n\nThe production of this model continued until 1955, with the engine being gradually improved. RND was regularly produced as a pick-up truck, van and a dumper truck. It was also produced as a bus and a field hospital (for military purposes) in a small series in 1951. The total number of produced vehicles is almost reaching the number of 17 000 RNDs.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1950\n\nModel RND\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1934\n\nEnd of Production 1955\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nGross vehicle weight 3500 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 4154 cm³\n\nValve gear SV\n\nMax power 44.5 kW / 2000 rpm\n\nPraga RN\n\nPraga RN (“Rychlý Nákladní”, Czech for “Rapid truck”) was for a certain time company’s main representative in the category of medium trucks. RN remained in production for remarkable 20 years without being substantially modified. In total, almost 24 thousand vehicles were manufactured. The vehicle was produced in various options, including civil and military trucks, ambulance cars, vans, tank or dumper trucks and even mobile workrooms.\n\nRN type also ventured abroad: in the early 1930s a tender competition was announced by TAM – a Yugoslavian car manufacturer. TAM was seeking a licence on production of medium trucks suitable for local conditions. Praga’s RNs successfully surpassed all the other competitors and was therefore the obvious choice for the Yugoslavian company in question. TAM produced a vast number of 50 thousands vehicles under the marking RN-TP in factories in Rakovica and Maribor. This foreign production contributed both the good reputation of Praga In other countries and to extensive motorization of Balkan area.\n\n01\n\nOverview\n\nYear build 1949\n\nModel RN\n\nManufacturer Praga\n\nStart of Production 1933\n\nEnd of Production 1953\n\n02\n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumber of doors 2\n\nNumber of seats 3\n\nLength 6775 mm\n\nGross vehicle weight 3500 kg\n\n03\n\nEngine\n\nEngine position front\n\nFuel petrol\n\nNumber of cylinders 6\n\nCapacity 3468 cm³\n\nBore 80.0 mm, 3.15 in\n\nStroke 115.0 mm, 4.528 in\n\nValve gear SV\n\nFuel system carburettor Praga Diflex 42\n\nMax power 54.0 at 3000rpm\n\nGearbox 4+1\n\nPraga AH-IV\n\nLight tank vehicle Praga AH-IV was based on the previous prototype TNH and was manufactured in factories Českomoravská-Kolben-Daněk since 1936.
