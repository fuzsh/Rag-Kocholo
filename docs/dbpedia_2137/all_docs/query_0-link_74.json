        "text": "The harmony of the whole, with attention to detail, is my joy.\n\nH. Podolská, 1926\n\nMay 19, 2019, is the last day for fashion fanatics to visit Hana Podolská’s\n\nexhibition at the Museum of Decorative Arts and to dive deeper into the history of\n\nCzech fashion.\n\nPodolská, born in Germany in 1880, was a Czech fashion designer whose\n\nCouture House rose during the First Czechoslovak Republic and survived through\n\nWorld War II and the post-war period. Most of the prototypes of Podolská’s dresses and\n\nfemale suits reflect fashion trends prevalent during World War II. Being a reputable\n\nprofessional, Podolská was manufacturing clothes for Czech celebrities, such as\n\nactresses Lida Baarová (1914-2000) and Adina Mandlová (1910-1991), and for Czech\n\nfilms, such as “Zlatá Kateřina” and “Katakomby.”\n\nPodolská’s father died when she was young, leaving the whole family in an\n\narduous financial situation. Working hard to earn enough money to support herself,\n\nPodolská lost hope of becoming a designer. However, in 1907, Viktor Podolský, a\n\nPolish nobleman, photographer, and academic painter, married Podolská and helped her\n\nto achieve goals, supporting his wife both emotionally and financially.\n\nPodolská’s talent and connections with Czech celebrities brought the designer\n\nsubstantial success. Besides manufacturing high-quality clothes, Podolská established\n\n“Eva” and “Fashion and Taste”, Czechoslovak fashion magazines.\n\nPodolská’s business was nationalized after the Communist takeover in 1948.\n\nNevertheless, she continued working at her fashion house as a saleswoman. In 1991, 19\n\nyears after her death, the fashion house closed down. However, the Czechs still pride\n\nthemselves on Podoloská’s legacy: the designer who developed Czech fashion to match\n\nFrench Couture.\n\nBesides the most important facts from Podolská’s biography, the exhibition\n\ndisplays her quotes about fashion, significant dates in her career, video interviews, and\n\nsketches.\n\nMoreover, spectators have an opportunity to touch Podolská’s textiles and view\n\ntheir intricacies through the microscopes provided at the exhibition.\n\nFashion became an emotional outlet for those living during World War I and II.\n\nAccording to the sketches, mid-length skirts and jackets with shoulder pads and a\n\nnarrow waist emphasizing women’s elegance and femininity were the most popular\n\ncomponents of Podolská’s designs. V-cut necklines and belts were integral to her\n\noutfits. Coarse, practical fabrics; low-key colors, such as blue, brown, and black; plaid,\n\npolka dot had become the most preferred details in fashion. Headwears and gloves tied\n\nthe outfits together.\n\nThe exhibition also provides brief information about influential fashion\n\nphotographers of Czechoslovakia, such as Jaroslav Balzar (1884-1945) and František\n\nDrtikol (1883-1961).\n\nBetween the museum’s high painted ceilings and colorful stained-glass\n\nwindows, Podolská’s exhibition invites the audience into a period of Czechoslovakia’s\n\npast.\n\nPhotos by Angelina Nikonova (except Podolská’s portrait; by Carola Praha)"
