        "text": "Germany - Czech-born actress Lida Baarova, a film star in pre-war Germany whose affair with Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels created a scandal, has died in the Austrian alpine town of Salzburg, her publishers announced.\n\nBaarova, whose given name is Ludmila Babkova, died on Friday at the age of 86 after a long illness, said Kettermann and Schmidt, a publishing company based in the western German town of Koblenz.\n\nHer memoirs, \"The soft bitterness of life\", are to be published soon.\n\nThe actress became famous after the release of her first German film \"Barcarole\" (1935), shortly before a scandal over her affair with Goebbels erupted, threatening his public image.\n\nAs a key figure in the Nazi regime, Goebbels had to portray himself as a model family man with his wife and children.\n\nSo when Baarova's husband, actor Gustav Froehlich, slapped her in public over her affair with the propaganda chief, Adolf Hitler personally ordered her out of Berlin.\n\nShe first fled to Prague, then to Rome in 1943, where she continued her acting career, starring in various films including \"I Vitelloni\" and \"La Biscara\".\n\nShortly afterwards she returned to her native town of Prague and married Jan Kopecky, a cousin of the communist interior minister at the time.\n\nIn 1956, she divorced him and settled in Salzburg.\n\nAfter virtually disappearing from the screens, German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder gave her a part in \"The bitter tears of Petra von Kant\" (1975). - Sapa-AFP"
