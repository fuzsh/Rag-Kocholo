        "text": "For more information please see www.filmart.co.il .\n\nDoomed Beauty\n\nCzech Republic, 2016 / 90 min\n\nCzech, Hebrew Subtitles\n\nDirector / Helena Třeštíková, Jakub Hejna\n\nScreenwriter / Helena Třeštíková\n\nCinematographers / Jiří Chod, Martin Kubala, Jan Malíř, Jaromír Nekuda\n\nEditor / Jakub Hejna\n\nCzech actress Lída Baarová was a star in the 1930s. Born in 1914, Baarová gave an extended interview before her death in 2000, which is the basis for this fascinating, chilling film. Baarová clings to her memories, tears up with emotion and recalls how Hitler invited her for tea and confessed that he had her picture on his nightstand. She says he was sweet. Baarová’s great romance, however, was with Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. Their love affair ended only because Goebbels’ wife, Magda, asked Hitler to intervene. In the interview, the elderly Baarová, laments that she missed out on a great career in Hollywood. This film is a thought-provoking portrait of an egocentric artist who willfully ignored the horrors unfolding around her, horrors she will forever be linked to."
