She soon found stardom in Germany with Barbarole, Ein\n\nTeufelskerl, Einer zuviel an Bord, and Die Stunde der Versuchung. In two of these, Baarova co-starred with her husband Gustav Fröhlich, who would cause an early end to her German career. When he learned that Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of propaganda, had an interest in his wife, Fröhlich reputedly slapped Goebbels' face, a move that cost Fröhlich temporary internment in a concentration camp. With the help of compatriots, Fröhlich had his revenge. In 1938, the New York Daily News reported that Goebbels was \"beaten almost to death,\" when he was \"surprised in the flat of a glamorous film star by a group of her husband's friends.\" To avoid scandal, Hitler stepped in, and Baarova was banished from German films and sent back to Prague. In 1942, she made four films in Italy before Mussolini fell from power.\n\nAccused of collaboration with the Axis in 1945, Baarova was interned in the Pankrac Prison in Prague until December 1946. Upon release, she married a theatrical agent and moved to Argentina, then Spain. She would make a few more films in Italy, including Frederico Fellini's I vitelloni in which she played Giulia, a role that would earn her a Silver Ribbon at the 1953 Venice Film Festival. Following a divorce in 1956, she moved to Salzburg, Austria, where she remained and successfully returned to the stage. In 1983, Baarova's autobiography Escapes was published in Toronto, Canada, where she had briefly lived.\n\nsources:"
