        "text": "They met for the first time\n\nat a party—and Walbrook, after\n\nlooking speechless at the lady,\n\nwalked out.\n\nThe lady was beautiful Czech-\n\nborn Lida Baarova, favourite\n\nactress of the Nazi Propaganda\n\nMinister, Goebbels.\n\nWalbrook told the film pro-\n\nducers that he regarded the\n\nnegotiations as broken off.\n\nTo his friends he said: \"I\n\ndon't know the lady. I regard\n\nit as an offence to my human\n\nartistic dignity to have been\n\nsuggested as co-star to\n\nBaarova.\"\n\n[Anton Walbrook is currently\n\nappearing in Australia in the\n\nfilm \"Red Shoes.\"]\n\nLida Baarova is regarded as\n\none of the most beautiful women\n\nin Europe.\n\nIn 1938 Goebbels was beaten\n\nby her husband, Gustav Froe-\n\nlich, and Goebbels' wife threat-\n\nened to institute divorce pro-\n\nceedings, naming Lida. Only\n\nHitler's intervention prevented\n\ndisruption of the Goebbels'\n\nhome.\n\nLida was \"exiled\" to Prague\n\nfrom Berlin, and Froelich was\n\nthrown into a concentration\n\ncamp."
