        "text": "Austin Powers star Mike Myers is close to signing up to star alongside Anne Heche and Helen Hunt in a new comedy, Timepiece. The $20m film would see Myers as a TV director making a documentary about a woman (Heche) who lives in a quiet rural community and is constantly fighting against the tyrannical rule of a nearby big city. Filming is slated to start next February.\n\nCzech-born actress Lída Baarová, who starred in many pre-war German films and who had a high profile affair with Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, has died at the age of 86. The actress became famous after the release of her first film Barcarole in 1935; but when the scandal of her affair with the supposedly model family man Goebbels broke, her public image was left in tatters and she was ordered to leave Germany by Hitler. She first fled to Prague, then to Rome, where she continued her acting career. After her disappearance from the screen in 1956, German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder gave her a part in his 1975 film The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant.\n\nDirector Alan Parker, who last directed Angela's Ashes, is close to signing up for The Life of David Gale as his next project. The drama is about a professor sentenced to death after being wrongly convicted of murdering a fellow capital punishment opponent. The screenplay has been written by Charles Randolph, a professor of philosophy and film theory in Vienna. Parker has apparently had his eye on the film for a while and he hopes to start production in March\n\nRalph Fiennes and Miranda Richardson are set to co-star in the new David Cronenberg project Spider, according to Screendaily. The $12m psychological thriller is set to start shooting later this year in London.\n\nAccording to IMDb News, Russell Crowe wears special elevator shoes to make him look taller. New Zealander Crowe, currently seeing the statuesque Meg Ryan, apparently took his shoes off at a recent party at producer Jerry Bruckheimer's house. Bruckheimer was apparently so concerned at Crowe's sudden lack of inches that he told him to: \"Put your shoes back on, you're blowing your image.\""
