        "text": "The Devil's Mistress\n\nBerlin, 1934. The ambitious and beautiful young Czech actress Lida Baarová is about to launch her career in the German Reich at Berlin's Babelsberg Film Studios - a dream come true. But how long will this dream last when she decides to become Joseph Goebbels' mistress?\n\nShe turned down Hollywood to become Goebbels' mistress: Lida Baarová, the Czech beauty who became one of the most renowned actresses in the German Reich. \"The Devil's Mistress\" takes a critical look at the artist's choices and errors, her incredible naiveté and her very credible pandering to the greats. Starring in the lead role under director Filip Ren? are Tatiana Pauhofová (Shooting Star at 2007 Berlinale, nomination as best actress for \"Burning Bush\" in 2013) and Karl Markovics (\"Grand Budapest Hotel,\" \"The Counterfeiters\") as Joseph Goebbels."
