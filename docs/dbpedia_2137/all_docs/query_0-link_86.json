Photo: Ströminger, Praha.\n\t\n\tCzech actress <b>Hana Vítová</b> (1914-1987) appeared in several films in her country during the 1930s and 1940s. In Germany she also appeared in two films under the name <b>Hanna Witt</b>.\n\t\n\tHana Vítová was born in 1914 as Jana Lasková in Prague, at the time Austro-Hungarian Empire, today Czech Republic. After being noticed on stage, she began her screen career with the comedy Naceradec, král kibicu/Naceradec, King of Kibitzer (Gustav Machatý, 1931) with Hugo Haas. Although she continued to perform at the theatre, she became much more popualr in the cinema. She became one of the leading female stars of the Czech cinema in the 1930s and the first half of the 1940s. She was the star of such films as Dum na predmesti (Miroslav Cikán, 1933) again with Hugo Haas, the comedy Nezlobte dedecka/Don't Make Grandpa Angry (Karel Lamac, 1934) with Vlasta Burian, and the comedy Jedna z miliónu/One in a Million (Vladimír Slavínský, 1935). Ulicka v áji/Paradise Road (Martin Frič, 1936) with Hugo Haas, was an alternate-language version of the German film Das Gäßchen zum Paradies (Martin Frič, 1936). Other films starring Vitova were Lidé na kře/People on the Iceberg (Martin Frič, 1937) with Lída Baarová, the drama Batalión/Battalion (Miroslav Cikán, 1937), the comedy Armádní dvojcata/Army Twins (Jirí Slavícek, Cenek Slégl, 1938), and the historical comedy Cech panen kutnohorských/The Merry Wives (Otakar Vávra,1939) with Adina Mandlová. \n\t\n\tDuring the war years, Hana Vítová  appeared in Adam a Eva/Adam and Eva (Karel Spelina, 1940), the drama Pro kamaráda/For a Friend (Miroslav Cikán, 1940), the musical Nocní motýl/Night Moth (Frantisek Cáp, 1941), the comedy Valentin Dobrotivý/Valentin, the Kind-hearted (Martin Fric, 1942), and the drama Stastnou cestu/Happy Journey (Otakar Vávra, 1943)with Adina Mandlova. She also starred in two German productions, Der zweite Schuss/The Second Shot (Martin Fric, 1943) with Gustav Waldau, and Freunde/Friends (E.W. Emo, 1945) with Attila Hörbiger, under the name of Hanna Witt. After the Liberation, the new authorities were after her. The fact of having worked for the Nazis was considered as collaboration. Hana Vítová would never find her old status again. Her return to the cinema in the leading roles of Znamení kotvy/Sign of the Anchor (Frantisek Cáp, 1947) and Pytlákova schovanka aneb Slechetný milionár/The Poacher's Ward (Martin Fric, 1949) did not revive her career. Later, she appeared only in a few rare films. Vítová  appeared on stage and in TV shows wirth musician Rudolf Antonyn Dvorsky and TV presenter Jan Pixa. One of her last films was the West-German production Das Haus in der Karpfengasse/The House in Karp Lane (Kurt Hoffmann, 1965). In 1987, Hana Vítová passed away in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). She was 73, and died from complications from a fall that occurred at her home in Prague. She spent the night helplessly on the ground and died at the hospital a day later. Vitová was married to actor and singer Jára Pospísil (1932-1934) and actor Bedrich Radl (1940-1955). With Bedrich Radl, she had a daughter, Bedriska, born in 1946. Bedriska committed suicide at the age of 20.\n\t\n\tSources: Marlène Pilaete (L'encinematheque - French), Wikipedia and IMDb.",
