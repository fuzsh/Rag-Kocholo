How could Hitler’s chief ideologist fall in love with a non-Aryan Slavonic beauty whose race had been designated as inferior by the Führer in “Mein Kampf” and whose country was soon to be occupied by the Nazis? How could one of Europe’s most glamorous actresses reject offers of stardom from Hollywood in preference to a dangerous romance with the Nazi monster with a deformed leg?\n\n—Czech Film Center"
