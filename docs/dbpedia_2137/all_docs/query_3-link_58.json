        "text": "Devil's Mistress / Lida Baarova DVD\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn 1934, Czech actress Lída Baarová is invited to the Babelsberg film studios in Berlin, considered the European Hollywood. After initial difficulties, she captivates audiences throughout Germany and is celebrated by the press as one of Europe's most beautiful women. She enjoys fame and the affection of Gustav Fröhlich, then the idol of all German women. Fröhlich is not only her on-screen partner but also becomes her lover. Even Hitler admires her, inviting Baarová to a private audience at the Reich Chancellery after visiting the studios. Baarová's star rapidly ascends. She and Fröhlich move into a luxurious villa in a prestigious Berlin address, unknowingly becoming neighbors with the powerful film industry figure and Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels. Goebbels starts inviting Baarová to his renowned parties attended by the artistic and political elite, gradually ensnaring her in his \"devilish\" networks. Fröhlich, driven by jealousy, eventually throws her out of their home. This presents an opportunity for the infatuated Goebbels, who is willing to give up everything for Lída – his family, career, and the Reich. Baarová turns down a long-term engagement in Hollywood, stays in Berlin, and falls hopelessly in love with him. The fundamental question of whether it is possible to love a criminal haunts her for years and the rest of her life. Under pressure from Goebbels' wife, Hitler orders his minister to end the scandalous relationship, incompatible with the Greater German ideals. Goebbels protests but eventually abandons his love under Hitler's pressure. Baarová is banned from acting in German films and cannot leave the Reich. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, she manages to escape back to her homeland, where she films several more successful movies. However, after the occupation of Czechoslovakia, she must flee from the Nazis again. After the war, she returns to Prague, full of hope, but faces only mockery and humiliation. Her real hell, however, is yet to come...\n\nProduct Details DVD\n\nLength 110 min.\n\nProduction Year 2016\n\nAudio Czech\n\nSubtitles Czech, English\n\nFormat DVD (PAL)\n\nRegion 2\n\nProduct Details BLu-Ray\n\nLength 110 min.\n\nProduction Year 2016\n\nAudio Czech\n\nSubtitles Czech, English\n\nFormat BLU-RAY\n\nRegion ALL\n\nDirector Filip Renc\n\nCast Tana Pauhofova, Karl Markovics, Gedeon Burkhard, Simona Stasova, Martin Huba, Lenka Vlasakova, Pavel Kriz, Anna Fialova, Jiri Madl, Zdenka Prochazkova, Michal Dlouhy, Helena Dvorakova, Miroslav Taborsky\n\nAlso Known As:\n\n(working title) - Hodina pokusení: Lída Baarová\n\nGermany (alternative title) - Die Geliebte des Teufels\n\nWorld-wide (English title) - The Devil's Mistress\n\nNote for US customers: It might not play on some US DVD players, Multi-Region and Multisystem PAL/NTSC DVD player is required, Please check your DVD player"
