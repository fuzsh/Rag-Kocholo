        "text": "by Piter Kehoma Boll\n\nIn a series of previous posts, I detailed the classification of living beings by Linnaeus in his work Systema Naturae as presented in its 10th edition, published in 1758. Here, I will present it in a summarized way and show changes that happened from the 10th edition to the 13th edition published in two parts, one 9 years later in 1767, dealing with animals, and one 12 years later, in 1770, dealing with plants.\n\nAnimals\n\nLinnaeus classified animals in 6 classes: Mammalia, Aves, Amphibia, Pisces, Insecta and Vermes.\n\n1. Mammalia included mammals and in 1758 they were classified in 8 orders: Primates, Bruta, Ferae, Bestiae, Glires, Pecora, Belluae, Cete (see details here).\n\nIn 1767 the order Bestiae no longer exists. Armadillos (Dasypus) were transfered to Bruta, pigs (Sus) to Belluae and the remaining genera to Ferae. Additionally, rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros) were transfered from Glires to Belluae and one bat species was transferred from the genus Vespertilio in Primates to a new genus, Noctilio, in Glires.\n\n2. Aves included birds and in 1758 they were classified in 6 orders: Accipitrae, Picae, Anseres, Grallae, Gallinae, Passeres (see details here).\n\nIn 1767, five new genera are seen in Picae: Buphaga, the oxpeckers, Trogon, the trogons, and Oriolus, the orioles (previously in the genus Coracias), Bucco, the puffbirds and Todus, the todies. One new genus appears in Anseres, Plotus, the darters. The order Grallae receives the new genera Palamedea, the seriemas and screamers, Parra, the jacanas, and Cancroma, the boat-billed heron. The order Gallinae is increased with the new genera Didus, the dodo (which was previously a member of the genus Struthio in the order Grallae), and Numida, the guineafowl (previously in the genus Phasianus). And, finally, the order Passeres received the new genera Pipra for the manakins (previously in Parus), Ampelis, the waxwings and cotings (previously in the genus Lanius in the order Accipitrae), Tanagra, the tanagers (previously in Fringilla) and Muscicapa, the flycatchers (previously in the genera Corvus and Motacilla).\n\nIt is also interesting to notice a change in the name of the order Accipitrae to Accipitres, and the genus Jynx is here written Yunx.\n\n3. Amphibia included reptiles, amphibians and some fish and had 3 orders: Reptiles, Serpentes and Nantes (see details here).\n\nThe orders Reptiles and Serpentes remained the same. The order Nantes, which in 1758 included mainly cartilaginous fishes, in 1767 included a lot of genera that were previously classified in the class Pisces, especially in the order Branchiostegi (see below).\n\n4. Pisces included most fish and had 5 orders: Apodes, Jugulares, Thoracici, Abdominales and Branchiostegi (see details here).\n\nThe genus Ophidion was transfered from the order Jugulares to Apodes and appears spelled Ophidium. The order Thoracici received the additional genus Cepola (red bandfishes) and the order Abdominales was increased with the genera Amia (the bowfin), Teuthis and Elops (the ladyfish), as well as the genus Mormyrus, previosly in the order Branchiostegi, which ceased to exist.\n\n5. Insecta included arthropods and had 7 orders: Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Aptera (see details here).\n\nThe order Coleoptera received the new genera Lucanus (stag beetles, previously in Scarabaeus), Byrrhus (pill beetles), Gyrinus (whirligig beetles), Bruchus (pea weevils), Ptinus (spider beetles), Hispa, Lampyris (glowworms). The genera Blatta and Gryllus were transfered to Hemiptera and mantises were removed from Gryllus and received their own genus, Mantis. Additionally, the lantern flies were removed from the genus Cicada and transferred to Fulgora. In the order Neuroptera, antlions were removed from the genus Hemerobius and transferred to a new genus Myrmeleon. In the order Hymenoptera, the cuckoo wasps were transferred from the genus Sphex to a new genus Chrysis.\n\n6. Vermes included several worms, molluscs, echinoderms, cnidarians and hagfishes. There were 5 orders: Intestina, Mollusca, Testacea, Lithophyta and Zoophyta (see details here).\n\nFrom 1758 to 1767, the genus Furia, of a fictional species, was transferred from Intestina to Zoophyta, and the genus Teredo (shipworms) was transferred from Intestina to Testacea. A new genus, Sipunculus, was added to Intestina to include the peanut worms. In the order Mollusca, we find now the new genera Ascidia (sea squirts), Aplysia (sea hares), Terebella (some polychaetes, previously in Nereis) and Clio (some sea slugs). The genus Priapus, containing sea anemones, is now called Actinia. The order Testacea received the new genera Mactra (trough shells, previously in Cardium) and Sabella (fanworm, previously in Serpula). The order Lithophyta received the new genus Cellepora (for bryozoans). In the order Zoophyta we find the new genera Flustra (for bryozoans previously in Eschara), Vorticella (for ciliates previously in Hydra) and Chaos (for amoebas, previously in Volvox). An additional genus is seen in Zoophyta: Spongia (sponges), transferred from Algae, back in the plant kingdom\n\nPlants\n\nPlants had a much more complicated system than animals. There were the plants with regular flowers classified in classes and orders according to the number of male and female sexual organs, respectively (as you can read in detail in parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of plants in Systema Naturae). Little has changed that except for some genera, as you can see in the table below.\n\nThe same is true for species in the classes Didynamia and Tetradynamia, which have flowers with stamens of different sizes. Little has changed in their classification.\n\nRegarding the three classes characterized by flowers with clustered stamens, we can see two new orders in the class Monadelphia.\n\nIn the class Syngenesia we can notice that the order Polygamia Superflua ceases to exist, with most of its species being transferred to Polygamia Aequalis, and a new order, Polygamia Segregata, is now present. In the class Gynandria a new order, Dodecandria, is created. See those two classes in more detail here.\n\nIn the three classes of plants with male and female organs occurring in separate flowers, I think the most interesting novelty is that the genus Chara, which in 1758 was classified as a genus of algae, is now among the flowering plants in the class Monoecia, order Monandria.\n\nFinally, among the Cryptogams, the “plants without flowers”, little has changed except for the transfer of Chara to the flowering plants and Spongia to the animal kingdom.\n\nWhile Linnaeus continued to develop his own system, other classifications were being proposed. We’ll start to take a look at them in the next chapters.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nLinnaeus, C.

(1770) Systema Naturae per regna tria Naturae…\n\nby Piter Kehoma Boll\n\nThis is the last part of Linnaeus’ classification of plants dealing with flowering plants (see parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) and presents three classes composed by plants that contain more than one type of flower. The last part of the system (part 9) will deal with non-flowering plants.\n\n21.

There is so much to talk about him, but I will give a very brief summary.\n\nLinnaeus was born in Sweden on 23 May 1707 in a village called Råshult. His father, Nils Ingemarsson, later Nils Linnaeus, was an amateur botanist and a Lutheran minister. Showing an interest in plants since childhood, Linnaeus, during most of his early education, avoided studying other subjects, escaping classes to examine plants in gardens and fields.\n\nIn 1724, he entered the Växjö Katedralskola to attend a curriculum designed to those seeking for priesthood, but his progress was not satisfactory. One of his teachers, Johan Rothman, which was also a doctor, suggested that Linnaeus could have a future in medicine and took him to live with his family in Växjö, teaching him physiology and botany. Rothman taught him the basic concepts of botany at the time, including Tournefort’s system to classify plants.\n\nIn 1728, Linnaeus started to attend Uppsala University by recomendation of Rothman. There he met Olof Celsius, a professor of theology and amateur botanist, who received Linnaeus at his home, which had one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden. In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis on plant sexual reproduction, Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum, which called the attention of Olof Rudbeck the Younger, an older professor of Uppsala. In 1730, Rudbeck selected Linnaeus to give lectures in Uppsala, even though he was only a second-year student. One month later, Linnaeus moved to Rudbeck’s house to become a tutor of his three youngest children. At this time, Linnaeus decided to create his own system for the classification of plants, as he was not satisfied by Tournefort’s system.\n\nBy the end of 1731, Linnaeus had a disagreement with Rudbeck’s wife and had to move out of their house, but his relationship with Rudbeck was not affected. In 1732 he made an expedition to Lapland, traveling about 2 thousand kilometers by foot and horse during six months and collecting about 100 previously unidentified plants.\n\nAfter returning to Uppsala, Linnaeus continued to have problems with Nils Rosén, a former assistant of Rudbeck that was interested in occupying Linnaeus’ place in the university. Due to their disagreements, Linnaeus accepted an invitation of a student, Claes Sohlberg, to spend the Christmas holiday with his family in the city of Falun. There, Sohlberg’s father invited Linnaeus to become his son’s tutor in the Dutch Republic (modern Netherlands). Linnaeus accepted and took the opportunity to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Linnaeus met Johan Frederik Gronovius and showed him his manuscript on the new classification of plants. Gronovius and a Scottish doctor, Isaac Lawson, helped to pay for the printing and the manuscript was published in 1735 as the Systema Naturae. In this work, Linnaeus reduced the description of species to a genus followed by a single word to refer easily to them, which would later become the currently used binomial nomenclature.\n\nLinnaeus also became acquainted with the botanist Herman Boerhaave and, following his advice, visited the botanist Johannes Burman. During his stay at Burman’s place, he met George Clifford III, who was the owner of a rich botanical garden. Amazed by Linnaeus’s classification of plants, Clifford invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus accepted and moved there, staying from 1735 to 1738. From this experience, he wrote his book Hortus Cliffortianus.\n\nLinnaeus returned to Sweden in 1738 and, in Falun, engaged Sara Elisabeth Moraea. They married in 1739 and in 1741 their first son, Carl, was born, and two years later a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, both becoming botanists as their father. The couple had several other children.\n\nDuring the following years, Linnaeus carried out several expeditions through Europe and, in 1750, became rector of Uppsala University. In 1751, he published Philosophia Botanica, a book containing a survey of his botanical system and other important information on how to do botanical work. In 1753, he published another major work, Species Plantarum, which became internationally known as the starting point of the modern botanical nomenclature. The same year, the King dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star.\n\nHis work Systema Naturae continued to be published in updated versions and the 10th edition, published in 1758, became the starting point of modern zoological nomenclature.\n\nIn 1774, already retired, Linnaeus suffered a stroke that partially paralyzed him. He had a second stroke in 1776, which paralyzed his right side and troubled his memory so that he was unable to identify himself as the author of his own works. A third stroke came in December 1777 and he eventually died on 10 January 1778.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nWikipedia. Carl Linnaeus. Available at < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus >.

See here part 1, part 2 and part 3.\n\nI’m presenting here the 6 th and last class of animals: Vermes. It included basically anything that was neither a vertebrate nor an arthropod.\n\n6. Vermes (worms)\n\nHeart with one ventricle and one auricle; cold pus.\n\nSpiracles absent?\n\nJaws multiple, various.\n\nPenises several in hermaphrodites, androgynous.\n\nSenses: tentacles, head absent (rarely with eyes, no ears and nostrils).\n\nCovering: sometimes calcareous or absent, if not spines.\n\nSupport: neither feet nor fins.\n\nVermes were classified according the form of the body in 5 orders: Intestina, Mollusca, Testacea, Lithophyta and Zoophyta.\n\n6.1 Intestina (internal ones or intestines), simple, naked and without appendages: Gordius (horsehair worms), Furia (the legendary worm), Lumbricus (earthworms and lugworms), Ascaris (roundworms and pinworms), Fasciola (liver flukes), Hirudo (leeches), Myxine (hagfishes) and Teredo (shipworms).\n\n6.2 Mollusca (soft ones), simple, naked and with appendages: Limax (land slugs), Doris (doriid sea slugs), Tethys (tethydid sea slugs), Nereis (polychaetes), Aphrodita (sea mice), Lernaea (anchor worms), Priapus (priapulid worms and anemones), Scyllaea (scyllaeid sea slugs), Holothuria (salps and man o’ wars), Triton (possibly some sort of sea slug), Sepia (octopuses, squids and cuttlefishes), Medusa (jellyfishes), Asterias (starfishes), Echinus (sea urchins and sand dollars).\n\n6.3 Testacea (covered with a shell), simple, covered by a calcareous shelter: Chiton (chitons), Lepas (barnacles), Pholas (piddocks and angelwings), Myes (soft-shell clams), Solen (razor clams), Tellina (tellins), Cardium (cockles), Donax (wedge shells), Venus (venus clams), Spondylus (thorny oysters), Chama (jewel box shells), Arca (ark clams), Ostrea (true oysters), Anomia (saddle oysters), Mytilus (mussels), Pinna (pen shells), Argonauta (paper nautiluses), Nautilus (nautiluses), Conus (cone snails), Cypraea (cowries), Bulla (bubble shells), Voluta (volutes), Buccinum (true whelks), Strombus (true conchs), Murex (murex snails), Trochus (top snails), Turbo (turban snails), Helix (land snails), Nerita (nerites), Haliotis (abalones), Patella (limpets and brachiopods), Dentalium (tusk shells) and Serpula (serpulid worms and worm snails).\n\n6.4 Lithophyta (stone plants), composite, growing on a solid base: Tubipora (organ pipe corals), Millepora (fire corals), Madrepora (stone corals and Acetabularia algae).\n\n6.5 Zoophyta (animal plants), growing like plants, with animated flowers: Isis (bamboo corals), Gorgonia (sea fans), Alcyonum (soft corals), Tubularia (pipe corals), Eschara (bryozoans and red algae), Corallina (coralline algae), Sertularia (bryozoans and hydrozoans), Hydra (hydras, cilliates and rotifers), Pennatula (sea pens), Taenia (tapeworms), Volvox (volvox algae and amLinebae).\n\nLinnaeus may have made some mistakes while classifying mammals, birds, amphibians, fishes and insects, but nothing compares to the mess that his class Vermes was. It included animals from many different phyla and even red and green algae! Sometimes the same genus included both animals and plants.\n\nAnd this concludes our presentation of animals in Linnaeus’ 1758 edition of Systema Naturae.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nLinnaeus. 1758.

See here part 1, part 2 and part 4.\n\nIn this post I’ll present a single class: Insecta. At that time, however, Insecta included not only what we call insects today, but all arthropods.\n\n5. Insecta (Insects)\n\nHeart with one ventricle and one auricle; cold pus.\n\nSpiracles: pores at the sides of the body.\n\nJaws lateral.\n\nPenises entering.\n\nSenses: tongue, eyes, antennae in head without brain (no ears and nostrils).\n\nCovering: armored sustaining bony skin.\n\nSupport: feet, in some wings.\n\nInsects were classified according to the number and aspect of the wings and included 7 orders: Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Aptera.\n\n5.1 Coleoptera (case wings), with four wings, the forewings fully hardened: Scarabeus (scarab beetles), Dermestes (larder beetles), Hister (clown beetles), Attelabus (leaf-rolling weevils), Curculio (true weevils), Silpha (carrion beetles), Coccinella (ladybugs), Cassida (tortoise beetles), Chrysomela (leaf beetles), Meloe (blister beetles), Tenebrio (darkling beetles), Mordella (tumbling flower beetles), Staphylinus (rove beetles), Cerambyx (longhorn beetles), Leptura (flower longhorn beetles), Cantharis (soldier beetles, glowworms), Elater (click beetles), Cicindela (tiger beetles), Buprestis (jewel beetles), Dytiscus (diving beetles), Carabus (ground beetles), Necydalis (wasp beetles), Forficula (earwigs), Blatta (cockroaches), Gryllus (crickets, locusts, grasshoppers, mantises, stick bugs).\n\n5.2 Hemiptera (half wings): with four wings, the forewings half-hardened: Cicada (cicadas), Notonecta (backswimmers), Nepa (water scorpions), Cimex (shield bugs and bedbugs), Aphis (aphids), Chermes (wooly aphids), Coccus (scale insects), Thrips (thrips).\n\n5.3 Lepidoptera (scale wings), with four scaly wings: Papilio (butterflies), Phalaena (moths), Sphinx (hawk moths).\n\n5.4 Neuroptera (veined wings), with four membranous wings and an unarmed tail: Libellula (dragonflies and damselflies), Ephemera (mayflies), Phryganea (caddislies), Hemerobius (lacewings, antlions, alderflies), Panorpa (scorpionflies), Raphidia (snakeflies).\n\n5.5 Hymenoptera (membranous wings), with four membranous wings and an armed tail: Cynips (gall wasps), Tenthredo (sawflies), Ichneumon (parasitoid wasps), Sphex (digger wasps and potter wasps), Vespa (hornets and wasps), Apis (bees), Formica (ants), Mutilla (velvet ants).\n\n5.6 Diptera (two wings), with two wings: Oestrus (botflies), Tipula (craneflies and midges), Musca (houseflies, hoverflies, blowflies, snipe flies), Tabanus (horse-flies), Culex (mosquitoes), Empis (dance flies), Conops (thick-headed flies, hornflies, stable flies), Asilus (robber flies), Bombylius (beeflies), Hippobosca (louse flies).\n\n5.7 Aptera (no wings), without wings: Lepisma (silverfishes), Podura (springtails), Termes (termites and barklice), Pediculus (lice), Pulex (fleas), Acarus (mites and ticks), Phalangium (harvestmen, whip spider and whip scorpions), Aranea (spiders), Scorpio (scorpions), Cancer (crabs, lobsters, shrimp), Monoculus (tadpole shrimps, water fleas, horseshoe crabs), Oniscus (woodlice), Scolopendra (centipedes), Julus (milipedes).\n\nAs one can notice, Linnaeus was pretty good at classifying hymenopterans, dipterans and lepidopterans. His orders Coleoptera and Hemiptera were not that bad too. Neuroptera was a little messy, but nothing compares to Aptera, where he put everything without wings, from silverfish to spiders, crabs and millipedes! It’s amazing how accurate he was with certain groups, but a complete disaster with others.\n\n– – –\n\nReferences:\n\nLinnaeus, C. 1758.
