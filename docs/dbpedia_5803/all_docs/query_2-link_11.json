        "text": "Alder Buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula)\n\nScientific classification\n\nKingdom: Plantae\n\nDivision: Magnoliophyta\n\nClass: Magnoliopsida\n\nOrder: Rosales\n\nFamily: Rhamnaceae\n\nGenus: Rhamnus\n\nL.\n\nSpecies\n\nSee text.\n\nFor the genus Hippophae, see Sea-buckthorn.\n\nThe Buckthorns (Rhamnus) are a genus (or two genera, if Frangula is treated as distinct) of about 100 species of shrubs or small trees from 1-10 m tall (rarely to 15 m), in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae. They are native throughout the temperate and subtropical Northern Hemisphere, and also more locally in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere in parts of Africa and South America.\n\nBoth deciduous and evergreen species occur. The leaves are simple, 3-15 cm long, and arranged either alternately or in opposite pairs. One semi-unique characteristic of many buckthorns is the way the veination curves upward towards the tip of the leaf. The plant bears fruits which are dark blue berries. The name comes from the fact that there is a woody spine on the end of each twig in many species. Buckthorns are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list of Lepidoptera that feed on buckthorns.\n\nClassification\n\nThe genus is divided into two subgenera, sometimes treated as separate genera:\n\nSubgenus Rhamnus: flowers with four petals, buds with bud scales, leaves opposite or alternate, branches with spines\n\nRhamnus alaternus – Italian Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus alnifolia – Alderleaf Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus arguta – Sharp-tooth Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus cathartica – Common (or Purging) Buckthorn (syn. R. catharticus)\n\nRhamnus crocea – Redberry Buckthorn (ssp. crocea), Hollyleaf Buckthorn (ssp. pilosa)\n\nRhamnus davurica – Dahurian Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus diffusus\n\nRhamnus globosa – Lokao Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus ilicifolia – Hollyleaf Redberry\n\nRhamnus japonica – Japanese Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus lanceolata – Lanceleaf Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus libanotica\n\nRhamnus lycioides\n\nRhamnus petiolaris\n\nRhamnus pirifolia – Island Redberry Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus prinoides – Shiny-leaf Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus saxatilis – Rock Buckthorn, Avignon Buckthorn, Avignon Berry (syn. R. infectoria, R. infectorius)\n\nRhamnus serrata – Sawleaf Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus smithii – Smith's Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus staddo – Staddo (syn. R. rhodesicus)\n\nRhamnus tinctoria - Dyer's Buckthorn (syn. R. saxatilis ssp. tinctorius)\n\nRhamnus utilis – Chinese Buckthorn\n\nSubgenus Frangula: flowers with five petals, buds without bud scales, leaves always alternate, branches without spines\n\nRhamnus betulaefolia (Frangula betulifolia) – Birchleaf Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus californica (Frangula californica) – California Buckthorn, Coffeeberry\n\nRhamnus caroliniana (Frangula caroliniana) – Carolina Buckthorn, Indian Cherry (syn. R. carolinianus)\n\nRhamnus frangula (Frangula alnus) – Alder Buckthorn, Glossy or Breaking Buckthorn, Black Dogwood\n\nRhamnus glandulosa - Sanguinho\n\nRhamnus latifolia (Frangula azorica)\n\nRhamnus purshiana (Frangula purshiana) – Cascara Buckthorn (syn. R. purshianus)\n\nRhamnus rubra (Frangula rubra) – Red Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus sphaerosperma (Frangula sphaerosperma) – West Indian Buckthorn\n\nThe Purging Buckthorn or Common Buckthorn (R. cathartica) is a widespread European native species, in the past used as a purgative, though its toxicity makes this a very risky herbal medicine and it is no longer used. Introduced into the United States as a garden shrub, this has become an invasive species in many areas there. It has recently been discovered to be a primary host of the soybean aphid Aphis glycines, a problem pest for soybean farmers across the US. The aphids use the buckthorn as a host for the winter and then spread to nearby soybean fields in the spring.\n\nAnother European species, Alder Buckthorn (R. frangula, syn. Frangula alnus) was of major military importance in the 15th to 19th centuries, as its wood provided the best quality charcoal for gunpowder manufacture.\n\nItalian Buckthorn (R. alaternus), an evergreen species from the Mediterranean region, has become a serious weed in some parts of New Zealand—especially on Hauraki Gulf islands.\n\nDyer's Buckthorn (R. tinctoria) is used, together with the Asian Chinese Buckthorn (R. utilis), to produce the dye \"china green\". Another species, Avignon Buckthorn (R. saxatilis) provides the yellow dye Persian berry, made from the berries.\n\nSanguinho (R. glandulosa) is endemic to the Macaronesian islands, where it is found in the laurisilva forests of the Madeira and Canary Islands.\n\nNorth American species include Alder-leaf Buckthorn (R. alnifolia) right across the continent, Carolina Buckthorn (R. (F.) caroliniana) in the east, Cascara Buckthorn (R. (F.) purshiana) in the west, and the evergreen California Buckthorn or Coffeeberry (R. (F.) californica) and Hollyleaf Buckthorn (R. crocea) in the west.\n\nIn South America, Rhamnus diffusus is a small shrub native from the Valdivian temperate rain forests in Chile."
