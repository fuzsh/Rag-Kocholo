        "text": "It is widely accepted that ‘native’ trees and shrubs are those species that have occurred naturally in Britain since the last Ice Age. The more recent introductions that have established themselves in the wild are referred to as ‘naturalised’ or ‘archeophytes’.\n\nNot all British native trees and shrubs have the ornamental properties required for garden use. Others may grow too large to be considered appropriate for the average-sized garden – take English oak (Quercus robur) or common aspen (Populus tremula), for example, both of which can reach over 20m (70ft).\n\nHowever, native trees and shrubs have a place in UK gardens and some are familiar favourites either as full blown trees or clipped plants; e.g. box (Buxus sempervirens), English yew (Taxus baccata), holly (Ilex aquifolium), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), beech (Fagus sylvatica), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and silver birch (Betula pendula).\n\nOthers are particularly useful in larger gardens, especially those backing onto British countryside where obviously exotic trees would look out of place. While some lend themselves to coppicing – hazel (Corylus avellana) and many willow species (Salix) – or are important species in mixed native hedging; hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and elder (Sambucus nigra).\n\nThis list comprises trees and shrubs native to the Britain and Ireland.
