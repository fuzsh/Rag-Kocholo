        "text": "ABOUT THIS PLANT\n\nEuropean buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) was introduced into the United States in the 1800's and planted in hedge groves and as wildlife habitat. By the early 1900's it had escaped cultivation. European buckthorn's attractive berries are widely eaten by birds and other wildlife. The species name \"cathartica\" derives from its properties as a laxative.\n\nHOW TO IDENTIFY\n\nLeaf: the branching pattern is sub-opposite or opposite. The leaves are rounded and toothed with archuate (\"arching\") veins.\n\nFruit/Flower: The flower is a greenish yellow four petal flower. The fruit is a dark blue to purple berry.\n\nGrowth form: Common buckthorn can grow 6-25 feet in height. It has charcoal colored bark with warty lenicels.\n\nLife History\n\nFlowering and Fruiting period: European buckthorn flowers in late spring or early summer. Berries appear late summer and persist until early fall.\n\nEuropean buckthorn prefers forest and edge habitat. However, it can grow in open fields, backyards, and in wetland borders. Ingestion of the berries by birds and mammals causes them to expel the contents of their stomach. This can be fatal for migratory birds.\n\nREMOVAL\n\nFull root removal is recommended when possible. For medium to large stems, cut the stem and cover with a small black bag (\"buckthorn baggie\"). Allow the bag to solarize for a season and remove the following year.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nhttps://www.mda.state.mn.us/plants/pestmanagement/weedcontrol/noxiouslist/commonbuckthorn"
