        "text": "Introduction The emerald ash borer (EAB) has killed 75 million ash trees in North America since 2002 (“Ville de Montreal”, 2015), causing Montreal to invest 15 million dollars over the next three years to deal with the infestation, and plant new trees (Laframboise, 2016). Predators of the EAB larvae include woodpeckers (Jennings et al., 2013). […]\n\nIntroduction Growing up in Canada, our culture has always praised the pioneers who colonized what we call home. Lichens, in the way the first settlers tell us about a community, tell us a lot about an ecosystem. They are bioindicators for air quality and perhaps even cardinal direction. Join us in our investigation as we […]\n\nFigure 1: One of the tree lines we studied, on a beautiful day. Introduction: The invasive European shrub known as Buckthorn, has been recently identified as detrimental to North American ecosystems (Mascoro, 2007). There are two types, Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) and Glossy buckthorn (Fragula alnus) (See figure 2). In the context of our […]\n\nSquirrels are one of the most recognizable animals in Canada. According to The Natural History of Squirrels (Gurnell 1987), three different types of squirrels exist: flying, ground-dwelling and tree squirrels. They all evolved from a common ancestor living in North America during the Eocene epoch (54 to 57 Million years ago), and then spread out, […]\n\nDominant tree species within a forest have resounding effects on the developmental direction an ecosystem takes. Different types of trees can affect the soil properties, water, light availability, and in our case, understory growth. A large portion of understory plants have medicinal properties, making them of special interest to humans both historically, having been used […]"
