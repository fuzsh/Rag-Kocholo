        "text": "What's the best method to water my Common buckthorn?\n\nYou might want to put a garden hose at the plant base to ensure that you're promoting excellent root development. Avoid directly spraying the leaves, and know that the leaves will require more watering if they are outdoors and facing direct sunlight. You can also use bubblers that you can put on to each plant to moisten the roots. Also, use soaker hoses that can cover the entire garden or bed when adding or removing plants to push the roots deeply. Drain any excess water and wait for the soil to dry before watering. Water at ground level to prevent diseases. On a sunny day, you might want to spray the entire bush with water. Whether potted or in-ground, please remember Common buckthorn prefers deep watering over light sprinkling.\n\nWhat should I do if I water Common buckthorn too much/too little?\n\nAn overwatered Common buckthorn can start to have leaves that turn yellow, drop off and wilt. The plant can also look dull and unhealthy, with signs of mushy stems. When they are beginning to show these signs, it's best to adjust your schedule whenever possible. The wilting can also be a sign of under watering as well. You might see that the leaves begin to turn crispy and dry while the overwatered ones will have soft wilted leaves. Check the soil when it is dry and watering is not enough, give it a full watering in time. Enough water will make the Common buckthorn recover again, but the plant will still appear dry and yellow leaves after a few days due to the damaged root system. Once it return to normal, the leave yellowing will stop . Always check the moisture levels at the pot when you have the Common buckthorn indoors. Avoid overwatering indoors and see if there are signs of black spots. If these are present, let the soil dry in the pot by giving it a few days of rest from watering. Overwatering can lead to root rot being present in your plant. If this is the case, you might want to transfer them into a different pot, especially if you see discolored and slimy roots. Always prevent root rot as much as possible, and don't let the soil become too soggy. You should dig a little deeper when you plant your Common buckthorn outdoors. When you check with your fingers and notice that the soil is too dry, it could mean underwatering. Adequate watering is required to help the plant recover.\n\nHow often should I water my Common buckthorn?\n\nThe Common buckthorn likes deep and infrequent watering. You would want to soak them in a gallon of water each time, especially when they are planted in pots. The water storage of flower pots is limited and the soil will dry out faster. Watering is required every 3 to 5 days when living in a cold region. Water it early in the morning when the soil is dry, outdoors or indoors. You can also determine if watering is needed by checking the soil inside. When the top 2-3 inches of soil is dry, it is time to give the plant a full watering. During hot days, you may need to check the moisture daily, as the heat can quickly dry out the soil in the pot. Irrigation of the soil is also required if you have a garden. When you live in a hot climate, you might want to water once a week. Only water when you notice that about 2 to 3 inches of soil become too dry outdoors or indoors. Consider the amount of rainwater on the plant and ensure not to add to it to prevent root rot.You may not need additional watering of the plants if there is a lot of rainfall.Common buckthorn generally grows during spring and fall. When they are outdoors, you need to add mulch about 3 to 4 inches deep to conserve more water. You need to water the plants more frequently in sandy soil because this type tends to drain faster. However, with the clay one, you need to water this less frequently where you could go for 2-3 days to dry the plant and not develop any root rot. You could mark the date on the calendar whenever you water and when you notice that the leaves are starting to droop. This can mean that you might be a day late.\n\nHow much water do I need to give my Common buckthorn?\n\nThe Common buckthorn generally needs about a gallon of water each schedule,With the potted plants, you might want to water them deeply until you see that the water is dripping at the bottom of the pot. Then, wait for the soil to dry before watering them again. You can use a water calculator or a moisture meter to determine the amount you've given to your plant in a week. Provide plenty of water, especially in the flowering period, but let the moisture evaporate afterwards to prevent root rot. If Common buckthorn is planted outdoor with adequate rainfall, it may not need additional watering. When Common buckthorn is young or newly planted, make sure it gets 1-2 inches of rain per week. As Common buckthorn continues to grow, it can survive entirely on rainfall. Only when the weather is too hot, or when there is no rainfall at all for 2-3 weeks, then consider giving Common buckthorn a full watering during the cooler moment of the day to prevent the plant from suffering from high heat damage. Additional watering will be required during persistent dry spells.\n\nShould I adjust the watering frequency for my Common buckthorn according to different seasons or climates?\n\nThe Common buckthorn needs outdoors come from rain, with only persistent dry weather requiring watering. Throughout the spring and fall growing seasons, the soil needs to be kept moist but not soggy, and alternating dry and moist soil conditions will allow the Common buckthorn to grow well. Throughout the summer, hot weather can cause water to evaporate too quickly, and if there is a lack of rainfall, you will need to water more frequently and extra to keep it moist. Usually, the Common buckthorn will need less water during the winter. Since the Common buckthorn will drop their leaves and go dormant, you can put them into a well-draining but moisture-retentive soil mixture like the terracotta to help the water evaporate quicker. Once your Common buckthorn growing outdoors begins to leaf out and go dormant, you can skip watering altogether and in most cases Common buckthorn can rely on the fall and winter rains to survive the entire dormant period. After the spring, you can cultivate your Common buckthorn and encourage it to grow and bloom when the temperature becomes warmer.This plant is not generally a fan of ponding or drought when flowering. You must ensure that the drainage is good at all times, especially during the winter. When the plant is in a pot, the plant has limited root growth. Keep them well-watered, especially if they are planted in pots during summer. They don't like cold and wet roots, so provide adequate drainage, especially if they are still growing. It's always best to water your Common buckthornâs diligently. Get the entire root system into a deep soak at least once or twice a week, depending on the weather. It's best to avoid shallow sprinkles that reach the leaves since they generally encourage the growth of fungi and don't reach deep into the roots. Don't allow the Common buckthornâs to dry out completely in the fall or winter, even if they are already dormancy. Don't drown the plants because they generally don't like sitting in water for too long. They can die during winter if the soil does not drain well. Also, apply mulch whenever possible to reduce stress, conserve water, and encourage healthy blooms.\n\nWhat should I be careful with when I water my Common buckthorn in different seasons, climates, or during different growing periods?\n\nIf planting in the ground, Common buckthorn mostly relies on rain. However, if there is no rainfall for 2-3 weeks, you may need to give proper consideration to giving the plants a deep watering. If watering Common buckthorn in summer, you should try to do it in the morning. A large temperature difference between the water temperature and the root system can stress the roots. You need to avoid watering the bushes when it's too hot outside. Start mulching them during the spring when the ground is not too cold. The age of the plants matter. Lack of water is one of the most common reasons the newly planted ones fail to grow. After they are established, you need to ease off the watering schedule. Reduce watering them during the fall and winter, especially if they have a water-retaining material in the soil. The dry winds in winter can dry them out, and the newly planted ones can be at risk of drought during windy winter, summer, and fall. Windy seasons mean that there's more watering required. The ones planted in the pot tend to dry out faster, so they need more watering. Once you see that they bloom less, the leaves begin to dry up. Potted plants are relatively complex to water and fluctuate in frequency. Always be careful that the pot-planted plant don't sit in the water. Avoid putting them in containers with saucers, bowls, and trays. Too much watering in the fall can make the foliage look mottled or yellowish. It's always a good idea to prevent overwatering them regardless of the current climate or season that you might have. During the months when Common buckthorn begins to flower, you might want to increase the watering frequency but give it a rest once they are fully grown. Give them an adequate amount of water once every 3 to 5 days but don't give them regular schedules. Make sure the soil is dry by sticking your finger in the pot, or use a moisture meter if you're unsure if it's the right time. Too much root rot can cause them to die, so be careful not to overwater or underwater regardless of the climate or season you have in your area.\n\nWhy is watering my Common buckthorn important?\n\nWatering the Common buckthorn helps transport the needed nutrients from the soil to the rest of the plant. The moisture will keep this species healthy if you know how much water to give. The watering requirements will depend on the weather in your area and the plant's soil. The Common buckthorn thrives on moist soil, but they can't generally tolerate waterlogging. Ensure to provide enough mulch when planted on the ground and never fall into the trap of watering too little. They enjoy a full can of watering where the water should be moist at the base when they are planted in a pot to get the best blooms. If they are grown as foliage, you need to water them up to a depth of 10 to 20 inches so they will continue to grow. If it's raining, refrain from watering and let them get the nutrients they need from the rainwater.\n\nIs pruning necessary for my Common buckthorn?\n\nCommon buckthorn does not need a lot of maintenance including pruning, which is part of what makes it such a popular choice. Most often, Common buckthorn is pruned to remove damaged or dead branches. You may also choose to remove some branches to improve the appearance of the Common buckthorn or to improve clearance under it. If there are branches that are very crowded together, air flow may be restricted. Any branches that are rubbing together could wear away the bark and allow disease or insects to penetrate the Common buckthorn, so those branches are also good candidates for pruning.\n\nWhen is the best time to prune my Common buckthorn?\n\nRemoving large branches (structural pruning) from the Common buckthorn is best done during the dormant period in the winter, while late winter or early spring is the best time for minor maintenance pruning. The ideal timing is when the Common buckthorn has developed buds but the buds have not opened yet. This timing makes it easy for you to find which branches are not productive and should be removed, since those branches wonât have any buds. Pruning at the beginning of the growing season allows the Common buckthorn to have the whole summer to devote to putting new growth into the remaining branches, flowers, and leaves. You can also prune it into a shape you like, but don't prune over 1/4 of the healthy branches and leaves of the Common buckthorn. Over pruning will hinder the normal and healthy growth of this plant. Please make sure that the cuts are clean and tidy. When Common buckthorn grows, if there is aging yellowing leaves and diseased leaves, you need to prune the bottom of the yellowing aging leaves and leaves with spots caused by the infection of disease. Pruning can effectively reduce the infection of disease. Even if the number of leaves with infections is relatively large, you should not prune more than 30% of the total number of leaves to avoid affecting the growth of Common buckthorn.\n\nHow can I prune my Common buckthorn?\n\nThe first step is deciding where to cut. It is a good idea to identify which branches you want to prune before taking other steps so you know which tools you need and have a plan from the beginning. You may want to mark branches with string or tape so you donât forget where you had planned to prune each branch. After you have decided where to cut, prepare the tools. Many Common buckthorn branches are thin and delicate, so you may be able to use regular pruning shears. If there are larger branches, you should use loppers or a pruning saw. A pole saw may be necessary if the branches are higher up. Your cutting implement should be sterilized with disinfectant or a diluted bleach solution before use and between cuts to avoid introducing pathogens to the wound when pruning. Also be sure to wear protective gear to avoid injuring yourself during this process. Removing large branches (structural pruning) from your Common buckthorn is best done during the dormant period in the winter, while late winter or early spring is the best time for minor maintenance pruning. The ideal timing is when the Common buckthorn has developed buds but the buds have not opened yet. This timing makes it easy for you to find which branches are not productive and should be removed, since those branches wonât have any buds. Pruning at the beginning of the growing season allows the plant to have the whole summer to devote to putting new growth into the remaining branches, flowers, and leaves. You can also prune it into a shape you like, but don't prune over 1/4 of the healthy branches and leaves of the Common buckthorn. Over pruning will hinder the normal and healthy growth of this plant. Please make sure that the cuts are clean and tidy. When Common buckthorn grows, if there is aging yellowing leaves and diseased leaves, you need to prune the bottom of the yellowing aging leaves and leaves with spots caused by the infection of disease. Pruning can effectively reduce the infection of disease. Even if the number of leaves with infections is relatively large, you should not prune more than 30% of the total number of leaves to avoid affecting the growth of Common buckthorn.\n\nWhat should I keep in mind when pruning my Common buckthorn?\n\nRemove no more than 30% of the volume of the Common buckthorn when pruning. Pruning too much at once can leave the Common buckthorn vulnerable to shock. This plant does not tolerate being cut back severely and may not recover. Donât prune young Common buckthorn unless it is to remove a dead or damaged branch. In between cuts, step back and check the appearance of the Common buckthorn and be sure that you are satisfied with the progress. If you trim too much at once, thereâs no way to restore the cut branches, so be conservative with your approach. One of the charms of Common buckthorn is its graceful, natural appearance, so you may want to embrace some of the âimperfectionsâ inherent to how it grows.\n\nHow much/long should Common buckthorn get sunlight per day for healthy growth?\n\nFor healthy growth, make sure that Common buckthorn receives at least 3â6 hours of sun each day. This is actually a minimum requirementâmost plants that can handle part sun can also thrive in full sun, but because they require less light for photosynthesis, they are more flexible than plants that require full sun or part shade.\n\nWhat type of sunlight does Common buckthorn need?\n\nCommon buckthorn does best with exposure to full or part sun. They will perform best with direct morning light, but in summer they need protection from the strong afternoon sun. In temperate environments, too much hot afternoon sun can burn the leaves, damaging the plant's appearance and health.\n\nCan sunlight damage Common buckthorn? How to protect Common buckthorn from the sun and heat damage?\n\nCommon buckthorn planted indoors can easily be damaged by direct sunlight when it's moved outdoors. The best way to prevent sunburns from overexposure is to move pots gradually from a shaded area to a brighter spot, gradually. But even plants that are acclimated to the summer sun can be damaged by extreme heat. In a heatwave, it is important to keep the soil consistently moist so that plants can cope with excessive levels of heat. Moving plants in containers to areas with afternoon shade or erecting a shade cloth over them can protect sensitive Common buckthorn during extreme weather events.\n\nDoes Common buckthorn need to avoid sun exposure? / Should I protect Common buckthorn from the sun?\n\nWhile bright morning sun and some full sun exposure can be highly beneficial for Common buckthorn, the harsh, hot midday sun of summer can be too much to handle. If planted in the ground, the summer sun will usually ramp up slowly enough through the season for Common buckthorn to gradually adapt to its intensity. But a potted plant that has been indoors or in a protected location will often suffer injury when placed suddenly into a location where the direct summer sun reaches it in the hottest part of the day. To protect this plant from the brutal afternoon summer sun, plant or place it in an understory location where it is shaded at midday by taller trees and plants or by a building or landscape feature.\n\nWhat will happen if Common buckthorn gets inadequate sunlight?\n\nWhen Common buckthorn receives too little sun, they may become pale green or display drooping, yellow leaves. While some leaf drop is normal, if leaves are dropping but no new ones are growing in to replace them, it is a sign that something is wrong. If Common buckthorn receiving inadequate light does manage to grow, the new growth is often spindly, pale, and prone to insect infestation. Paying attention to these signs and changing the lighting conditions of the plant will make a significant difference.\n\nDoes Common buckthorn need special care about sunlight during its different growth stages?\n\nTender, new leaves are especially sensitive to sunburn. Bearing this in mind, very young Common buckthorn and when it's in a strong growth phase, such as in late spring and early summer, will be more sensitive to harsh sun and heat than the mature one or those in a more dormant fall growth stage. Common buckthorn fresh from a nursery is also usually not prepared for strong full sunlight and must be introduced to it slowly.\n\nAre there any cautions or tips for sunlight and Common buckthorn?\n\nRecently transplanted Common buckthorn will often experience a bit of shock and will need to be cared for carefully, either shaded from bright afternoon sun or placed in a protected area. On very hot days, you may see the leaves of Common buckthorn droopingâthis is usually nothing to worry about. Plants will send the water in their leaves down into their roots to protect them from burning. However, if the leaves are still drooping in the evening or the next morning, the plant needs water. Always avoid watering during the hottest times of day, as sunlight can hit wet leaves and scorch them easily. Common buckthorn that has been underwatered will be weaker than that with consistently moist soil. This can leave it with weak roots that are unable to protect the leaves on hot, sunny summer days by diverting water away from the leaves. Care for an underwatered plant by giving it a long, deep watering and then allowing the top two inches of soil to dry out before the next watering. Even if it loses its leaves, if cared for properly it will grow new ones.\n\nWhat is the optimal temperature for Common buckthorn?\n\nThe best temperature for Common buckthorn to thrive is 65~80â(18~27â). During the primary growing phase, the highest temperature tolerable would be 95â(35â), while the lowest tolerable temperature would be 15â(-10â). This species is tolerant of low temperatures and will survive freezing winters. The perfect, highest, and lowest temperature range: Perfectï¼65~80â(18~27â) Highestï¼85~95â(30~35â) Lowestï¼-5~15â(-20~-10â) or below\n\nShould I adjust the temperature for Common buckthorn during different growing phases?\n\nResearch shows that Common buckthorn will begin to exhibit signs of stunted growth during prolonged periods of higher temperatures, especially during the development of axillary buds and the growth of main shoots. Keeping the temperatures consistent and cooler, around 65â(18â), will encourage vigorous growth after germination or transplanting.\n\nHow can I keep Common buckthorn warm in cold seasons?\n\nCommon buckthorn can withstand freezing temperatures when planted in the ground in areas that donât get below of 15â(-10â) as an extreme temperature during the winter months. But if planted in pots or containers, then their roots must be protected from the winter cold. Do this by wrapping the container in a blanket or bringing it inside where it will be fully protected from the elements.\n\nWhat damage will Common buckthorn suffer if the temperature is too high/low?\n\nGreater harm will come to Common buckthorn if the temperature is consistently too high versus too low. If Common buckthorn gets too hot, seed germination and photosynthesis efficiency is lessened due to hormone triggers caused by heat stress. The plant will show signs through wilting, leaf browning, and potentially death. If Common buckthorn gets too cold, plant functions such as nutrient uptake and photosynthesis will cease, resulting in the possible death of the plant. If a single freezing event occurs during the growing season, then a membrane phase transition might occur, which can cause a cease in plant functions and death of the plant.\n\nWhat tips and cautions should I keep in mind when it comes to temperature for Common buckthorn?\n\nKeeping the soil temperature consistent is one of the most important strategies to keeping Common buckthorn healthy, which leads to successful budding, flowering, and new growth. Do this by consistently watering, adding mulch to bare soil, and planting in the shade.\n\nHow can I keep Common buckthorn warm without a heat pad?\n\nDue to the cold tolerance of Common buckthorn, heating pads will not be necessary if planted outside in the ground. If the plant is in an outdoor pot, then bring it inside a heated house and place it in a sunny window during the winter months.\n\nHow can I provide Common buckthorn with an adequate temperature condition?\n\nTo ensure adequate temperature conditions are present, plant Common buckthorn in an area with partial shade. If possible, use afternoon shade to provide the best protection during the hottest part of the day. This will also result in lower temperatures in the soil due to increased moisture retention. If Common buckthorn is planted indoors, then keep the container away from windows and out of direct sunlight during the summer months to prevent the soil temperature from spiking daily.\n\nHow can I save Common buckthorn from temperature damage?\n\nDuring the summer or times of high heat, give Common buckthorn extra shade and water to help cool its leaves, roots, and soil. During cold snaps or growing season freezes, cover sensitive budding vegetation with frost cloth or water using sprinkler systems. If itâs only nearing freezing temperatures for a short period, then water during the day several hours before the freeze. If the temperature is predicted to remain below freezing for an extended period, then keep the sprinkler running until the temperature rises above freezing the following day.\n\nShould I adjust the temperature for Common buckthorn in different seasons?\n\nCommon buckthorn is a mid-temperature plant that can easily tolerate the typical fluctuations of the seasons and remain a hardy species when planted in maintained landscapes areas, containers, or indoors. Therefore, adjusting the temperature during the different seasons is unnecessary for primary growth. If flowering is stunted or impeded, then allowing the plant to experience a season of winter freeze could help to revive flowering.\n\nUnder what conditions should I stop adjusting the temperature for Common buckthorn?\n\nIf it becomes too difficult to lower the temperature for an indoor plant during the summer, then plant it outside in the ground or in a container. Make sure to plant Common buckthorn in a shaded location and water often to keep the soil moist.\n\nWhy do I need to fertilize my Common buckthorn?\n\nRegardless of which kind of Common buckthorn you own, regular fertilization will help you grow a plant that has great overall health. The proper supply of nutrients leads to more vigorous growth and can help your Common buckthorn be more resilient to tough growing conditions while also gaining a better ability to fight off diseases and pests. The foliage of your Common buckthorn is one of its most attractive features, which is why you should do all you can to keep it intact. Again, this means creating and adhering to a regular fertilization schedule that is specific to your Common buckthorn. Doing so will prompt your Common buckthorn to develop leaves with a deep color and a lush overall look.\n\nWhen is the best time to fertilize my Common buckthorn?\n\nThe first time that you should fertilize your Common buckthorn is during the late winter or early spring. This type of fertilization gives your Common buckthorn all the nutrients it needs to resume healthy growth once the weather gets warm enough. It is also beneficial to many Common buckthorn to provide an additional fertilizer feeding during early fall if you in a warm climate region. Fertilizing in early fall not only adds additional nutrients to the soil, which your Common buckthorn will use in the following growing season, but it also helps your Common buckthorn be a bit more hardy and capable of surviving the winter cold without experiencing foliage damage. Earlier fertilisation will ensure that the new branches have enough time to grow to withstand the cold winter.\n\nWhen should I avoid fertilizing my Common buckthorn?\n\nThere are a few times during the year when you should not fertilize your Common buckthorn. The first time occurs during the early and mid-winter months, during which time your Common buckthorn will be dormant and in no need of feeding. It is also unwise to fertilize this plant during the late spring and all of the summer. During that time of year, the weather will likely be hotter and can be much dryer as well. Both conditions make it more likely that your Common buckthorn will have a very negative response to fertilization. To avoid such issues, stick to a fertilization schedule that involves feeding exclusively during early spring and early fall.\n\nWhat type of fertilizer does my Common buckthorn need?\n\nIn most cases, the most important nutrient for a Common buckthorn is nitrogen, but that does not mean that phosphorus and potassium are unimportant. On the contrary, your Common buckthorn likely needs a decent amount of all three main nutrients, which is why a balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10, can work well. However, a more nuanced ratio of nutrients often leads to optimal growth for a Common buckthorn. Often, fertilizers that are a bit higher in nitrogen work a bit better. For example, a ratio of 10-6-4 can often work well. When fertilizing, you can use a granular fertilizer or a liquid-based one.\n\nHow do I fertilize my Common buckthorn?\n\nTo fertilize your Common buckthorn using a granular fertilizer, all you need to do is sprinkle the fertilizer on the soil at the correct time. The slow-release nature of granular fertilizer will release nutrients into the soil slowly over time. As is usually the case, it's best to water your Common buckthorn, at least lightly, before applying fertilizer. As an alternative, you can use a liquid fertilizer, but this is less common. To use this approach, mix your fertilizer with water, then pour the water onto the soil around the base of your Common buckthorn. At times, it is beneficial to perform a soil test before fertilizing to see if you will need to alter the pH at all.\n\nWhat happens if I fertilize my Common buckthorn too much?\n\nOverfertilization is always a risk when you are feeding a Common buckthorn. Overfertilization is especially likely if you feed this plant at the wrong time of year, feed it too often, or feed it without watering the soil first. When overfertilization takes place, your Common buckthorn may begin to develop brown leaves. Your Common buckthorn can also show stunted growth in some cases. On the other hand, it is also possible that too much fertilizer can prompt your Common buckthorn to rapidly produce too much new growth, much of which will be weak and prone to breaking. Weak new wood can also detract from the overall form and structure of your Common buckthorn.\n\nLeaf rot\n\nLeaf rot is a disease that predominantly affects the foliage of Common buckthorn. It causes the leaves to decay, thus affecting photosynthesis, growth, and yield of the plant. The disease is most widespread during wet and humid conditions, presenting a moderate threat to Common buckthorn.\n\nLearn More About the Leaf rot\n\nBrown spot\n\nThis infection can cause brown spots or patches to appear on the plant.\n\nSolutions: In minor cases of brown spot, there isnât any need to treat the disease. However, if much of the foliage is affected and defoliation occurs, the plant will benefit from getting rid of the infection. It is recommended to start by applying organic treatment options, working up to the more potent synthetic, chemical fungicides if necessary. Organic options wonât kill the fungus, but will prevent it from spreading. Dissolve Â½ teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of liquid soap in a gallon of water. Using a spray bottle, spray on tops and bottoms of leaves until the mixture drips off. Repeat every two weeks until existing spots stop enlarging and new spots no longer appear. Spray a copper-based fungicidal soap on the leaves, coating the top and bottom leaf surfaces. Reapply as directed on the product label. Copper penetrates the leaf surface and prevents germination of spores so the fungus cannot spread. Apply an all-purpose fungicide to the entire plant, following the label instructions carefully.\n\nLearn More About the Brown spot\n\nLeaf beetles\n\nLeaf beetles are a class of colored insects 1 to 2 cm in size. They gnaw on leaves and petals resulting in small, round holes scattered over the surface.\n\nSolutions: For less serious cases: Remove beetles, nymphs, and eggs. Remove all life stages of the beetles and kill them by placing them in a bucket of warm, soapy water. This can be done more easily by placing the bucket under affected leaves and shaking the plant. This method is most effective in the afternoon when leaf beetles are more active. Always dispose of insects in a sealed bag or container to avoid escape and spread. To treat more serious infestations: Apply organic insecticides. Use naturally-derived insecticides before moving on to synthetic insecticides. Neem oil and pyrethrum are naturally-derived insecticides that should be applied following label instructions. Apply synthetic insecticides. Examples of insecticides effective for leaf beetles include carbaryl, permethrin, and bifenthrin. Apply insecticides according to label instructions.\n\nLearn More About the Leaf beetles\n\nCaterpillars\n\nCaterpillars are fleshy moth or butterfly larvae that come in an array of colors, patterns, and even hairstyles. They chew on leaves and flower petals, creating large, irregular holes.\n\nSolutions: Even though caterpillars are diverse, they all chew on plant parts and can cause significant damage if present in large numbers. For severe cases: Apply insecticide. For an organic solution, spray plants with a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which specifically affects the larval stage of moths and butterflies. Be sure to coat plants, since caterpillars need to ingest Bt for it to be effective. This will not harm other insects. Spray a chili extract. Chili seeds can be cooked in water to make a spicy spray that caterpillars don't like. Spray this mixture on the plants, but be aware it will also be spicy to humans. Introduce beneficial insects. Release beneficial insects to the garden that eat caterpillars, such as parasitic wasps. For less severe cases: Hand pick. Using gloves, pick off caterpillars on plants and dispose of them in a bucket of soapy water. Dust plants with diatomaceous earth. This powder is harmless to humans but irritates caterpillars. Therefore, it will make it difficult for caterpillars to move and eat.\n\nLearn More About the Caterpillars\n\nSap-sucking insects\n\nSap-sucking insects can create dense clusters of small yellow or white spots on the leaves.\n\nSolutions: Sap-sucking insects can be hard to spot, as they are often small and attach to the undersides of plant leaves. If you see signs of an infestation, follow these steps to eradicate it. Hand-pick bugs and remove eggs: Inspect your plants for insects and drop any you find in a container of soapy water. Look carefully at the undersides of plant leaves and squish any egg clusters you find. Use Insecticide: Targeted spraying can take out sap-sucking insects. Small infestations can be controlled with insecticidal soap, though larger outbreaks might require a stronger spray. Introduce natural predators: Many insects, including ladybugs and praying mantises, love to feast on sap-suckers. You can purchase them at garden stores and release them near infected plants, or encourage wild ones by creating habitat space.\n\nLearn More About the Sap-sucking insects\n\nLeaf deformity\n\nLeaf deformities can have a variety of causes.\n\nSolutions: Follow these steps to revive plants with abnormal leaves. Remove damaged leaves: Plants can recover from damage when given the time to do so. Remove any deformed leaves so they don't continue drawing energy from the plant. This also creates room for healthier ones to grow. Stop using herbicide: Though herbicide damage is challenging to diagnose, gardeners can potentially prevent deformed leaves by not using any and by strictly following manufacturers instructions. Spray insecticide: Prevent pests from inhabiting plant leaves by spraying with insecticide regularly and practicing good natural pest prevention techniques. Apply a balanced fertilizer: Solve nutrient deficiencies and excesses by using a well-balanced fertilizer (organic or conventional both work) before planting, and consider topdressing when signs of stress are apparent. Fix watering schedule: If plant leaves are curled downward due to too much or too little water, adjust the watering schedule so the soil is moist, but not damp. Remove infected plants: If the plant has succumbed to a viral infection, not much can be done to revive it. Remove and destroy all compromised plant material to prevent spread to other plants.\n\nLearn More About the Leaf deformity"
