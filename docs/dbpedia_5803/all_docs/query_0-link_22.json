Rhamnus cathartica is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, northwest Africa, and western Asia. It was introduced to North America in the early 19th century as an ornamental plant and is now considered invasive in parts of North America. The berries and leaves are mildly poisonous to humans and animals, causing laxative effects. It is a competitive and allelopathic species that enriches soil with nitrogen in a way that is detrimental to native plants. Control methods include herbicides and repeated removal due to resprouting from roots.",
