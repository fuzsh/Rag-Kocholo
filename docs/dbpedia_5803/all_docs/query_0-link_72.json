The family stayed together because underneath there is still love, but the love is difficult to see. There is little attention and care, little love and warmth shown. And when it is present it easily gets ridiculed, labelled as weak and soft. So they get the idea that everyone has to fight for his own place, his job and money. In society this idea is put forward as the survival of the fittest, the world as a jungle where everyone fights for himself against the rest.\n\nThe world is experienced as hard, without love. They have to survive in harsh conditions, being punished and beaten by parents, bullied and nagged by siblings.\n\nMind\n\nLove is disrupted by violence, egotism; the feeling is that love is pushed under the carpet or has gone away.\n\nIdea of the survival of the fittest, that one has to be on guard, to stand up for oneself, take one’s place.\n\nFighting between couples, husband and wife, parents and children, brothers and sisters.\n\nLove hidden.\n\nConfusion.\n\nFeeling that he must atone for his sins to regain serenity.\n\nNot sharing, suspicious.\n\nFear: poverty, starvation; abused.\n\nGeneral\n\nSensation: blocked, obstruction, not flowing, plug.\n\nBody\n\nAbdomen: full, bloated; obstructed, food feels undigested; pain cramping, upper abdomen; problems with spleen, pancreas and liver."
