I'm pretty sure they are native to the area. I don't know what they are either. The closest thing I can find is an elderberry tree, but That isn't what it is.\n\nI'm going to do a little more research to see if I can find out.\n\nPlease Log in or Create an account to join the conversation.\n\nReplied by Artmyth on topic Re: Fruit bearing Shrub\n\nPosted #1958\n\nI think you have zeroed in on the genus check this out en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus from that page look at this image en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elderberries2007-08-12.JPG\n\nThat to me looks like what I have\n\nThank you I will attempt to refine the search within that genus!\n\nLast edit: 12 years 10 months ago by Artmyth.

You don't have to feel bad about killing them. I have a few trees that are invasive and that's what I do with them. So far none have died.\n\nPlease Log in or Create an account to join the conversation."
