Common Buckthorn has sub-opposite leaves that sometimes can be so close together that they can appear to be opposite, but more commonly they are visibly seen as being sub-opposite. Sometimes they can be far enough apart to look alternate, which has been known to confuse people in identifying this species. Leaf margins toothed Circled in Red (Red), notice the terminal end of this stem. The terminal branch has died and become a modified thorn (preventing a terminal bud from forming) and with the two sub-opposite buds next to it, creates a resemblance of a buck’s hoof, which is how this plant received its name. MinnesotaSeasons.com Circled in Orange (Orange), is Crown Rust (Puccinia coronata), a fungus that sometimes infects Common Buckthorn and alternates infections with Oats or Barley, lowering yield for farmers. In the picture just to the left, you can see the orange color just underneath the bark. Also circled in Red (Red) to the far left are dead branches that act as thorns. These modified branches derived from the above pictures.

Glossy Buckthorn has a “glossy look” to its leaves where as Common Buckthorn has more of a dull sheen.

Not all native species that look like Buckthorn are on this ID guide because what looks similar to Buckthorn varies from person to person. Bunchberry – Cornus canadensis (native) With flower Without flowers, Bunchberries look similar to buckthorn seedlings Jeffrey Flory – Superior National Forest 2014 Pyrola ssp. (native) All Pyrola species look fairly similar to each other. This species was seen at Moose Mountain SNA and St. Louis/Red River Stream Bank Protection Area, WI. Close-up of rosette basal leaves Close-up of Pyrola bud Common Buckthorn Cluster of 1 year old seedlings Jeffrey Flory – Moose Mountain SNA, MN 2014 Taken by Jeffrey Flory, 2014 Alder-leaved Buckthorn Rhamnus alnifolia (native) New Jersey Tea – Ceanothus americanus (native) Another species that have leaves that look similar to Common Buckthorn is New Jersey Tea (Ceanothus americanus). It’s growth habit does not look like Common Buckthorn because New Jersey Tea is a low growing shrub. This species is in the Buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae) Robert H. Mohlenbrock. USDA NRCS Northeast wetland flora: Field office guide to plant species Trees, Shrubs, Woody Vines of North Carolina One reason why we do not have a bio-control for Buckthorn is that all the species that eat or infect Buckthorn in their native habitats are generalists and will effect many native species in the US, or are specialists to Buckthorn species, but were found to also eat our native Buckthorn species. Due to past bio-controls becoming invasive or problematic, vigorous testing are performed prior to introducing into the United States. The tests performed for these invasive Buckthorns have determined that there are not viable bio-controls for them. 3\n\n4 4 Black Cherry – Prunus serotina (native)\n\nImage of leaves Image of immature bark Image of mature bark Virginia Tech Dept. of Forest Resources Kenraiz – Wikipedia.org Virginia Tech Dept. of Forest Resources Common Buckthorn – Rhamnus cathartica (noxious weed – invasive) Image of leaves Image of immature bark Image of seedling (cotyledons) EDDMapS, taken by Paul Wray, Iowa State University Jeffrey Flory, 2012 Common Buckthorn – Rhamnus cathartica (noxious weed – invasive) Image of intermediate bark Image of mature bark 2008 Josh Sayers 2008 Josh Sayers 4\n\n5 5 Choke Cherry – Prunus virginiana (native)\n\nLeaf Bark Winter Twig (buds and leaf scar) Virginia Tech, Dept. of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation.

These species include native Cherries, Plums, and Hawthorns (p 9). Many times, it is the bark of young and adult Black and Choke Cherries that people can be accidentally cut and treated for Buckthorn. The small, spindly look of Cherry saplings are also easy to misidentify or not notice growing in a patch of Buckthorn saplings. The key to help reduce accidental casualties of native Cherry species is to check the buds and twigs, which lack the thorns and more symmetrical, terminal buds. Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center – photo by Mariann Watkins photo by R. W. Smith 5\n\n6 6 Serviceberry (Juneberry) species – Amelanchier ssp. (native species)\n\nUSDA has listed 10 different Serviceberry species present in Minnesota. All are listed as being present within the Ceded Territory with the exception of one without specified counties listed. Because of this, the general characteristics will be shown and examples of varying leaf characteristics between some of the species for identification due to the variety and number of species that could be misidentified as Buckthorn. As circled in Yellow (Yellow) Serviceberries also have a long, pointed terminal bud. Downy (Common) Serviceberry – Amelanchier arborea (native) Hiker's Guide to the Trees, Shrubs, and Woody Vines of Ricketts Glen State Park - Third Edition (Web Page) Saskatoon Serviceberry – Amelanchier alnifolia (native) Roundleaf Serviceberry – Amelanchier sanguinea Buckthorn is easiest to find in mid to late fall when it still retains its leaves and most other native plants have already dropped their leaves. Winterberry is one of the few natives that retain their leaves late into fall, turning a greenish yellow color. Buckthorn’s leaves usually stay dark green, but on occasion, will turn a similar color. Britton, N.L., and A. Brown An illustrated flora of the northern United States, Canada and the British Possessions. Vol. 3 Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research Common Winterberry – Ilex verticillata (native) NRE 436 – many pictures come from Steve Baskauf at Vanderbilt University Trees, Shrubs, Woody Vines of North Carolina 6\n\n7 7 Yellow Birch – Betula alleghaniensis (native)\n\nLeaves, spur branch, and branch Bark In our area, we have quite a few Birch tree species that can be easily misidentified as Common Buckthorn. The important characteristics to look for are the buds, catkins, spurs, and lack of thorns. Birch leaf margins are also double serrated where as Common Buckthorn has regular serrated leaf margins. Trees of Wisconsin Trees of Wisconsin Yellow Birch – Betula alleghaniensis (native) Paper Birch – Betula papyrifera (native) Spur branch and bud Leaves Catkins River Birch – Betula nigra (native) Leaves Young bark Mature Bark 7\n\n8 8 Alders – Alnus ssp. (native species)\n\nThree Alder species are present within the Ceded Territory. Only one species will be represented in this comparison. Speckled Alder – Alnus incana (native) Glossy (Alder) Buckthorn - Frangula alnus (noxious weed) Notice how similar the venation is between these two species. Also to note is that Alnus ssp. will lose their fuzzy look and have a more glossy look to them as the leaves mature. Alnus species have dry fruits that can also resemble Glossy Buckthorn berries from a distance. Once up close, they are easy to tell apart with Alders having double serrated leaves while Glossy Buckthorn doesn’t (leaves are entire). Downy Arrowwood – Viburnum rafinesquianum (native) Dogwoods – Cornus ssp. (native species) Four Dogwood species are present within the Ceded Territory. Only one species will be represented in this comparison. Gray Dogwood – Cornus racemosa (native) personal.umich.edu Notice that Downy Arrowwood has opposite leaves where as Common Buckthorn has sub-opposite and Glossy Buckthorn has alternate leaves. Arrowwood also has bigger indented teeth along their leaf margins when compared to Buckthorn species. by Will Cook – Trees, Shrubs, and Vines of North Carolina Dogwood species are another shrub that can be mistaken as buckthorn. One way to tell the difference is that all but one species has opposite leaves (Cornus alternifolia is the exception that has alternate leaves). Even with this difference, it can sometimes be difficult to tell them apart because Common Buckthorn has sub-opposite leaves that can fool some into thinking it is opposite leaves or cause others to think that Dogwood is Buckthorn. An easy way to help tease these two apart is to gently tear the leaf in half, against the direction of the veins (as demonstrated in the picture on the left). If fibrous strands become exposed, circled in Purple (Purple), then it is a Dogwood species, but if fibrous strands are not present, then it is not a Dogwood species. sfrc.ufl.edu 8\n\n9 9 Alternate-leaved Dogwood – Cornus alternifolia (native)\n\nAlternate-leaved Dogwood (Cornus alternifolia) is the exception to Dogwood species having opposite leaves, as suggested by its name. Alternate-leaved Dogwood is on the right of this picture, compared to Common Buckthorn on the left, circled in Blue (Blue). Picture taken by Bruce Anderson, MN DNR This illustration was made by Cody Hough Nannyberry – Viburnum lentago (native) Leaves Buds All Viburnum species have opposite leaves. A phrase to help identify species with opposite leaves is MAD V: Maple, Ash, Dogwood, and Vibernum. By remembering this acronym and the groups of species that goes with each letter, you will know many of the native species in Minnesota. Of course there are a few species that do not fit this broad ID aid. Alternate-leaved Dogwood does not follow this, and all species in the Honeysuckle family have opposite leaves. Shrubs of Wisconsin Shrubs of Wisconsin Cockspur Hawthorn – Crataegus crus-galli (native) Gnarly tree out in the wild Leaves and branch thorns Hawthorns are an uncommon species that can be found in our area (mentioned on page 5). There are about 15 species in our state and five are known to be in our area. With their thorns, rough bark, and gnarled look, it is easy to mistaken this native, an ecologically important species, with buckthorn. Hawthorns have flowers that look like cherry blossoms (rose family) that are usually white. Their thorns are distinctive from Buckthorn, growing from the branch rather than being a modified branch, formed from the tip. National Education Network Gallery botgard.ucla.edu 9\n\n10 1010 Honeysuckle species – Lonicera ssp. (invasive)\n\nMany Non-native Honeysuckles are a huge problem in woodlands and forests. In Minnesota, the DNR considers them invasive, are not listed as a noxious weed, but is currently being reviewed and could potentially be listed as a noxious weed by This means that even though many government organization in Minnesota are fighting this species, it is still legal to buy and plant them throughout the state. Make sure to remove this species while you remove Common and Glossy Buckthorn. Three Rivers Park District learned this the hard way. After removing Buckthorn from a woodland floodplain, they had left the Non-native Honeysuckle alone, only to discover five years later that it had become a forest of Honeysuckle that was also difficult to control. Currently, there is only one species of Non-native Honeysuckle within the Ceded Territory. There are however, other Non-native Honeysuckles nearby, native Honeysuckles that grow in the Ceded Territory, and other native shrub species that look similar to Non-native Honeysuckles. Tatarian Honeysuckle – Lonicera tartarica (invasive shrub present in the Ceded Territory) Leaves and berries Typical shrub growth habit and bark Rob Routledge: forestryimages.org A few physical characteristics to keep in mind are that all Lonicera ssp. have opposite leaves. Tatarian Honeysuckle is present in 1854’s Ceded Territory. It has orngish stems and the bark is very paper pealy looking. Branches that touch the ground will re-root and spread vegetatively this way. Another note to keep in mind is that if you remove some of the smaller ones by hand pulling, make sure to hang it in a tree or on a rock because most Honeysuckle species will re-root if given the chance.
