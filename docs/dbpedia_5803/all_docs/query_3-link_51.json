        "text": "Common buckthorn is reported frequently across the entire Great Lakes region. On a continental scale it is most common in the Great Lakes region and Northeastern U.S., but is also found in the Mid-Atlantic, northern Great Plains, and on the West Coast. Common buckthorn is considered hardy to Zone 3, but populations have been observed to tolerate temperature extremes from 104 °F to -53 °F (Zouhar 2011). It is often found near urban areas where it was used as an ornamental plant.\n\nAdditional invasive species distribution data for specific Great Lakes jurisdictions is available via:\n\nMidwest Invasive Species Information Network (Michigan)\n\niMapInvasives (New York and Pennsylvania)\n\nEDDMapS Ontario\n\nOnce established, common buckthorn maintains large populations through prolific seed production and high rates of germination, even under shade. It out-competes other plant species by growing very quickly and by leafing out very early in the spring and retaining its leaves late into the fall, effectively extending its growing season. Its biological advantages often allow common buckthorn to form a dense single-species stands that prevent regeneration of native species. Buckthorn also alters its habitat to favor its own growth by influencing nitrogen cycling (Heneghan et al. 2006). It may also exude chemicals that prevent the germination of some native plant species (Warren et al. 2017, Klionsky et al. 2010). Its chemical activity may also prevent native amphibian eggs from hatching, further disrupting ecosystems (Sacerdote and King 2014). Buckthorn also appears to negatively impact the bird species that use it for nesting and food (Knight 2005).\n\nCommon buckthorn negatively impacts agriculture by acting as a host for crop pests. It is a known host plant of crown-rust, a fungal disease of oat crops, and the soybean aphid. Without treatment, soybean aphids can reduce soybean crop yields by 26% (Kim et al. 2008).\n\nPlease see our Landscape Alternatives pages for more information about how the WIGL Collaborative selected alternatives.\n\n~ = trait is somewhat present but not as pronounced as in check-marked examples\n\na ‘Green Mountain’ is a tall boxwood cultivar and may eventually grow to 7’, though it is slow-growing\n\nbAnglo-Japanese yew is sold as dioecious (male or female) clones, and only the females will produce fruit. ‘Densiformis’ is female.\n\nGreen = native to part of the Great Lakes Basin\n\nYellow = native to the United States but not to the Basin\n\nBlue = not native but not invasive\n\nThe WIGL Collaborative’s decision trees are designed to help site users, who are perhaps newly discovering that plants that are part of their home landscaping are invasive, prioritize which species should be removed first based on risk to the surrounding environment, economy, and occasionally, to human health. In a perfect world, everybody would remove all invasive plants from their landscaping right away, but in reality, removing mature woody plants involve a hefty investment of time and/or money. These diagrams can help people with multiple woody invasives in their landscaping prioritize to get the most benefit for their efforts.\n\nTo learn more about the methodology and information used to develop the decision trees and for helpful hints on how to answer the questions, please see the full report here (PDF).\n\nThe following is a brief overview of management techniques shown to be effective on common buckthorn. For more detailed information on how to use these techniques, please visit our Control and Management page. For technical assistance with managing woody invasive species, please get in touch with a local cooperative invasive species management group or university extension program.\n\nTiming and spread concerns: Whenever possible, individual plants should be controlled before they are able to fruit in order to prevent spread. If resources are limited, managers might prioritize removal of female plants to prevent further spread. If control is undertaken after plants have fruited, it is best not to remove the plants from the site to avoid spreading seed.\n\nPhysical control: Small plants are easily hand-pulled from moist soil; larger plants can sometimes be dug or pulled using equipment. The root crown must be removed to prevent regrowth. Top-killing methods such as mowing, grazing, and prescribed fire are rarely effective by themselves unless repeated multiple times a year for multiple years. However, top-killing methods followed by foliar herbicide treatment of regrowth can be highly effective (see combined approaches below).\n\nSome landowners are experimenting with a non-chemical variation on the cut stump method for common buckthorn where the freshly cut stump is covered with a tin can or fully opaque plastic bag instead of applying herbicide. If installed correctly and left in place for one to two years, this method can prevent regrowth by blocking light to the cut surface (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources). If light is blocked for long enough, the roots will eventually die.\n\nChemical control and combined approaches: Foliar spray is the most feasible method for managing a large, dense buckthorn infestation, and is effective anytime plants are actively growing and fully leafed out. Foliar application can also be used as a follow-up to mowing or grazing when foliar herbicide is applied to regrowth later in the season or during the subsequent season. Cut stump, basal bark and stem injection herbicide treatments are all effective on buckthorn and can be applied during most of the year outside of early spring. In all cases, herbicide should be selected carefully based on site conditions, and label directions read and followed carefully.\n\nWith any treatment it will be necessary to monitor for and treat regrowth in subsequent years. This is especially true for common buckthorn whose seeds persist in the soil for a number of years. Managers should expect treatment of dense buckthorn infestations to be a long-term commitment.\n\nResources on management of common buckthorn:\n\nMidwest Invasive Plant Network Control Database\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin Extension fact sheet\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin Extension – Woody Invasive Plant Management Demos\n\nMinnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources\n\nInvasive Species Centre/Ontario Invasive Plant Council"
