        "text": "Looking after the LGBTQ+ YA section at Foyles, and seeing how well it's done, I've also worked on trying to put together lists of other queer titles in the Children's Department and try to make sure we've got stock in, in order to recommend titles if we're asked. As it's Pride Month, I thought I'd share some of those lists, so you can stock up for the younger readers in your life.\n\nToday, I'm sharing a range of middle grade and YA graphic novels with LGBTQ+ characters. Some of the titles listed might technically be \"adult\" titles, but they have cross over appeal featuring teen characters, and no inappropriate content for teens. On to the books!\n\nArtie and the Wolf Moon by Olivia Stephens (Sapphic)\n\nAfter sneaking out against her mother's wishes, Artie Irvin spots a massive wolf--then watches it don a bathrobe and transform into her mom. Thrilled to discover she comes from a line of werewolves, Artie asks her mom to share everything--including the story of Artie's late father. Her mom reluctantly agrees. And to help Artie figure out her own wolflike abilities, her mom recruits some old family friends.\n\nArtie thrives in her new community and even develops a crush on her new friend Maya. But as she learns the history of werewolves and her own parents' past, she'll find that wolves aren't the scariest thing in the woods--vampires are. From StoryGraph.\n\nBookshop^ | StoryGraph | Goodreads\n\nMooncakes by Suzanne Walker, Wendy Xu & Joamette Gil (Non-binary)\n\nA story of love and demons, family and witchcraft.\n\nNova Huang knows more about magic than your average teen witch. She works at her grandmothers' bookshop, where she helps them loan out spell books and investigate any supernatural occurrences in their New England town.\n\nOne fateful night, she follows reports of a white wolf into the woods, and she comes across the unexpected: her childhood crush, Tam Lang, battling a horse demon in the woods. As a werewolf, Tam has been wandering from place to place for years, unable to call any town home.\n\nPursued by dark forces eager to claim the magic of wolves and out of options, Tam turns to Nova for help. Their latent feelings are rekindled against the backdrop of witchcraft, untested magic, occult rituals, and family ties both new and old in this enchanting tale of self-discovery. From StoryGraph\n\nBookshop^ | StoryGraph | Goodreads\n\nSnapdragon by Kat Leyh (Prominent trans and lesbian secondary characters)\n\nKat Leyh's Snapdragon is a magical realist graphic novel about a young girl who befriends her town's witch and discovers the strange magic within herself.\n\nSnap's town had a witch.\n\nAt least, that's how the rumor goes. But in reality, Jacks is just a crocks-wearing, internet-savvy old lady who sells roadkill skeletons online--after doing a little ritual to put their spirits to rest. It's creepy, sure, but Snap thinks it's kind of cool, too.\n\nThey make a deal: Jacks will teach Snap how to take care of the baby opossums that Snap rescued, and Snap will help Jacks with her work. But as Snap starts to get to know Jacks, she realizes that Jacks may in fact have real magic--and a connection with Snap's family's past. From StoryGraph.\n\nBookshop^ | StoryGraph | Goodreads\n\nCheer Up: Love and Pompoms by Crystal Frasier & Val Wise (Sapphic & trans)\n\nA sweet, queer teen romance perfect for fans of Fence and Check, Please!\n\nAnnie is a smart, antisocial lesbian starting her senior year of high school who's under pressure to join the cheerleader squad to make friends and round out her college applications. Her former friend BeeBee is a people-pleaser--a trans girl who must keep her parents happy with her grades and social life to keep their support of her transition. Through the rigors of squad training and amped up social pressures (not to mention micro aggressions and other queer youth problems), the two girls rekindle a friendship they thought they'd lost and discover there may be other, sweeter feelings springing up between them. From StoryGraph\n\nBookshop^ | StoryGraph | Goodreads\n\nFence, Vol. 1 by C.S. Pacat, Johanna the Mad, Joana LaFuente & Jim Campbell (Gay)\n\nNicholas Cox is determined to prove himself in the world of competitive fencing, and earn his place alongside fencing legends like the dad he never knew, but things get more complicated when he's up against his golden-boy half-brother, as well as sullen fencing prodigy, Seiji Katayama.\n\nNicholas, the illegitimate son of a retired fencing champion, is a scrappy fencing wunderkind, and dreams of getting the chance and the training to actually compete. After getting accepted to the prodigious Kings Row private school, Nicholas is thrust into a cut-throat world, and finds himself facing not only his golden-boy half-brother, but the unbeatable, mysterious Seiji Katayama...\n\nThrough clashes, rivalries, and romance between teammates, Nicholas and the boys of Kings Row will discover there's much more to fencing than just foils and lunges. From acclaimed writer C.S. Pacat (The Captive Prince) and fan-favorite artist Johanna the Mad. From StoryGraph.\n\nBookshop^ | StoryGraph | Goodreads\n\nOn A Sunbeam by Tillie Walden (Sapphic)\n\nOne of the youngest ever Eisner winners, incredible talent Tillie Walden presents a stunning queer space opera – her greatest work to date.\n\nOn a Sunbeam is the story of Mia, interwoven between her time as a rebellious schoolgirl at a boarding school in space and her time as crewmember aboard the spacecraft Aktis, where she travels the deepest reaches of space to rebuild and restore beautiful broken-down structures. As the past and present weave together, we discover more about Mia and her roots and how they connect with her present on Aktis. In Walden's words, 'The road ahead is not a comfortable, simple one.'\n\nWalden's inimitable style and presentation are more fully-formed and gorgeous than ever before as she works with her signature themes of sexuality and gender, the individual in landscape, first love and awesome cats.\n\nPart love story, part epic space adventure, On a Sunbeam is a masterpiece from an explosive, unmissable talent. From StoryGraph\n\nBookshop^ | StoryGraph | Goodreads\n\nSpinning by Tillie Walden (Sapphic)\n\nPoignant and captivating, Ignatz Award winner Tillie Walden's powerful graphic memoir, Spinning, captures what it's like to come of age, come out, and come to terms with leaving behind everything you used to know.\n\nIt was the same every morning. Wake up, grab the ice skates, and head to the rink while the world was still dark.\n\nWeekends were spent in glitter and tights at competitions. Perform. Smile. And do it again.\n\nShe was good. She won. And she hated it.\n\nFor ten years, figure skating was Tillie Walden's life. She woke before dawn for morning lessons, went straight to group practice after school, and spent weekends competing at ice rinks across the state. It was a central piece of her identity, her safe haven from the stress of school, bullies, and family. But over time, as she switched schools, got into art, and fell in love with her first girlfriend, she began to question how the close-minded world of figure skating fit in with the rest of her life, and whether all the work was worth it given the reality: that she, and her friends on the figure skating team, were nowhere close to Olympic hopefuls. It all led to one question: What was the point? The more Tillie thought about it, the more Tillie realized she'd outgrown her passion--and she finally needed to find her own voice.
