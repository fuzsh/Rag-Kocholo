        "text": "Led Zeppelin – Physical Graffiti\n\nMarch 19, 2023\n\nALBUM REVIEW\n\nOVERALL (OUT OF 10): 10\n\nHigher Education conferences are the worst. What a massive waste of time. Right this moment I am sitting in a session at a conference my college sent me to and some guy is blah blah blahing at me the same kind of blah blah blah I’ve had blah’d at me for two days now. See, the way most higher education conferences work, everyone sits in all these sessions – the ones they don’t skip anyway – and play around on their phones the whole time while the presenters review some possibly-new-possibly-not-new thing they are doing at their institutions that may or may not work as well as they say it does, and when they are done everyone walks out the door and never thinks about anything they heard there again, and they just go back to their colleges and keep doing all the stuff they’ve always done without changing a damn thing as a result of having attended the conference. Higher education conferences are just an excuse for college employees to travel to a different city and go drinking in a new town on someone else’s dime. I shouldn’t complain that I’m getting paid to fly someplace warm and sit on my butt all day – there are way worse ways to keep food on the table – but my faith in the meaningfulness of existence is always severely shaken after I attend a higher education conference.\n\nSo I’m stuck here, I might as well do something worthwhile with my time. So I think I’ll introduce you to one of the most generous internet strangers of my acquaintance, user SteveZ98 on the forums.ledzeppelin.com forum. Under the name North Bridge, Mr. Z98 produces The Stereo Project, a series of new stereo mixes of Led Zeppelin soundboard recordings that were either originally in mono or only had minimal separation between the instruments. North Bridge takes these recordings and makes them stereo-tastic. His latest release is the legendary March 21, 1975 Seattle show, considered by almost all Zeppelin bootleg connoisseurs to be the best show of the 1975 North American tour. Now, the 1975 tour was the tour when the legendary onstage prowess of the Mighty Zep started to slip – Plant sang at many of the shows with a cold, although by that point his voice was far from what it once had been anyway. Jimmy Page broke a finger just before the tour, which didn’t help, but even so after peaking in 1973 his playing was becoming somewhat wooden, sloppy, sticky, and less nuanced. If you really listen to how he was playing, there’s no comparison between the 1973 and 1975 tours. But while for the most part Zep wasn’t firing on all cylinders on the 1975 North American tour, that Seattle show was a return to the glory days of yesteryear, and Zep played with a passion and intensity that had been largely MIA on much of the tour. Information on this most recent North Bridge remaster can be found at https://forums.ledzeppelin.com/topic/30448-19750321-remastered-soundboard/ . Personally I think Steve’s true masterpiece is his work on the May 25, 1975 Earl’s Court show, see https://forums.ledzeppelin.com/topic/27971-stevez98s-earls-court-remaster-a-masterpiece/, but everything he does is top notch. And he’s the most generous guy you could hope to encounter on the internet, just message him through the Led Zeppelin forum and he’ll give you a download link for the show. Really a classy guy, and I deeply appreciate his work. You can find an example of his work at this YouTube link, which pairs some stellar remastered video with his remixed audio on concert opener “Rock and Roll” from that last Earl’s Court show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNalRPFr8Yw .\n\nThe 1975 tour and Earl’s Court shows, of course, were promoting Zep’s 1975 release Physical Graffiti, which is one of those albums I have listened to so many times in my life I don’t even have to hear it to give it a review, sitting here in a mind-numbingly boring conference session I can hear every single note perfectly in my mind. The whole album is permanently engraved in my brain pan, I am pretty sure several billion of my brain’s neurons are devoted to maintaining a note-perfect recording of Physical Graffiti. There are few albums I’d want to devote that much brain space to, but this album is one of them for sure.\n\nIs it the greatest Zep album? I’m not sure – IV without question is more powerful pound for pound, it is more concentrated and intense, with nary a wasted second of vinyl (other than for a few seconds on that outro guitar solo on “Black Dog” where I’ve always thought Jimmy Page briefly gets a little lost and screechy and pitchy). Considering it is only eight songs long it covers a lot of ground. IV doesn’t have a weak song on it, while even the most diehard fan must admit that Graffiti has some filler (namely “Boogie with Stu”, a rip-off of Ritchie Valens that which the boys took about as seriously as the name suggests. Fun it may be, but filler it is). But really, when two albums reach that level of greatness, it’s pretty futile to attempt to determine which is better, they differ by such infinitesimally small degrees of awesomeness. When it comes to IV and Graffiti, it boils down to this: are in the mood for a compact masterpiece or a sprawling masterpiece?\n\nAnd without question, Physical Graffiti is a sprawling masterpiece, the kind of album the French invented the phrase tour de force for. It is Zep at perhaps their most Zeppiest, the best example of Jimmy Page’s philosophy of “light and shade”. After all, a double album gives you considerably more room to explore all the space that falls between light and shade. And Zep made the most of it – if we set the introspectively acoustic “Bron-y-Aur” and the sledgehammer stomp of “Sick Again” as the two extremes of the album, between those extremes you have the gentle-afternoon-watching-the-waves-roll-in “Down by the Seaside”, the thrillingly exotic “Kashmir”, the rollicking “Houses of the Holy”, the funky “Trampled Underfoot”, the machine gun blast riff of “The Wanton Song”, the devastating slide blues of “In My Time of Dying”, the cosmically new agey “In the Light”, the yearning “Ten Years Gone” – the extra vinyl that a double album offers gave the Mighty Zep more space than ever to stretch out, and the sheer variety and breadth of music on the album is absolutely stunning. Few albums have ever boasted a similar level of musical exploration.\n\nPart of the reason for this was that Zep recorded eight fantastic songs at Headley Grange in 1974, then realized they wouldn’t all fit all of them on a single album. The songs were all too good to cut any, and it being the 70s and all the obvious decision was to dust off some out-takes and make it a double album. Luckily their outtakes were better than most of the best songs other bands could come up with, and I am glad that rather than languishing unheard in tape boxes in some storage facility, these songs got their chance to see the light of day.\n\nAt its best, Physical Graffiti is nothing short of astonishing. Zep could never have included the eleven-minute “In My Time of Dying” on a single album – it would have eaten up too much of a side of vinyl, but it could never be shortened, there isn’t a second to spare in the whole song. Editing out any of it would be criminal. In my book it is the most powerful and potent blues song ever recorded, with the possible exception of “When the Levee Breaks”. Page’s slide guitar is absolutely sublime, the two solos among the best slide solos I’ve ever heard, and that main riff evokes a sense of fervent desperation. And Plant’s vocal is just as fervently desperate and desperately fervent – was Plant ever so soulful, so vocally enigmatic, so passionate as when he sang “In my time of dying, won’t nobody moan, all I want for you to do, is take my body home”? Furious drum fills by Bonham push the song to its climax – and Plant’s ad-libbed “won’t you make it my dyin’, dyin’, dyin’…cough” is the perfect way to defuse eleven minutes of sheer tension. The song is a remarkable musical moment, four master musicians performing at the absolute limit of their impressive abilities – and on the fly at that, the fact that it was largely recorded live makes it all the more remarkable. Few bands could pull off a song like this.\n\n“Kashmir”, of course, is generally regarded as the album’s centerpiece, and stands as one of the most innovative songs from rock in the 70s, without all of the gimmickry of complicated tempo shifts, unexpected chord changes, and flashy instrumental virtuosity that most prog bands of that period considered “innovation”. It has perhaps the most hypnotic riff ever recorded, and the way those descending notes at the end of each verse explode into the stereo field is simply thrilling – and I have always loved the way the bass continues to hold its constant pattern against it, the juxtaposition is fascinating. The fact that one album could contain both a “Kashmir” and an “In My Time of Dying” shows what a unique album we are dealing with here. And while Robert Plant’s voice was no longer hitting the highs like it once did, these two songs are among the best examples of his ability to sing with unsurpassed passion and fire – his emotive approach more than compensates what he may have lost in vocal range over the preceding years.\n\nI will forever love “Ten Years Gone” – I’ve been listening to it for more than thirty years and it still gives me the feels. Why? It’s a lot of things. It’s the lyrics, which are unusually focused and coherent for a Robert Plant composition. It’s the vocals, full of that regret which inevitably comes with what we lose with the passage of time. It’s the subdued guitar intro, and it’s that irresistibly poignant riff that follows, and it’s Page’s sensitive and sparkling guitar solo, among the greatest he – or any other guitarist for that matter – ever laid down on tape. It’s that absolutely devastating guitar figure introduced in the final verses – and then it’s how Robert brings us all home with a bunch of passionate “Ten years gone, holding on”s. Everything thing about the song works perfectly, and I am moved every single time I hear it. I can’t say that of many songs, but I can say it of this one.\n\n“The Rover” may have the catchiest guitar riff ever laid to tape, and I wonder at the lightness and elasticity of Plant’s vocal approach – just listen to the way he skips across the notes he is singing, with a truly marvelous level of agility, dexterity and grace. The guitar solo is one of Page’s greatest – perhaps more passionate that “Stairway” even. And I can’t help but dig Plant’s hippy-dippy lyrics – “And the wind is cryin’, of a love that won’t grow cold, my lover she is lyin’, on the dark side of the globe…if we could just join hands”. Ridiculously irresistible.\n\nAs is the faux-philosophy of “In the Light”, with its groovy echo keyboard and mystic pretensions. One of John Paul Jones’ finest keyboard moments. “The Wanton Song” is a blast of pure Jimmy Page ferocious rapid fire riffage. “Night Flight” is fun, if slight. Zep even give Stevie Wonder a bit of a run for his money with “Trampled Underfoot” (well, not even close really, but it’s still a fun funk workout). “Black Country Woman” is a blast, and when Bonzo comes in halfway through with his steady beat, the song really cooks. Plant never gets his due as a harmonica player, he sounds great here. And I’ve always thought “Houses of the Holy” belonged on the album that bears its name, I’ll never figure out how “D’Yer Maker” and “The Crunge” made the cut and it didn’t.\n\nNot gonna lie – I always thought album opener “Custard Pie” was kind of “meh”. It’s a pretty lame double entendre on top of that too. But the rest of the album more than makes up for it.\n\nThe album ends with some of the best riffage on the whole thing – “Sick Again”’s inverted, snaky guitar part is irresistible. But the song puts me a bit of a moral quandary. Far Out Clickbait, Inc, makes a good call on this one (see here):\n\n“However, lyrics such as the following have – make no mistake about it – aged terribly: “From the window of a rented limousine/ I caught your pretty blue eyes/ One day soon you’re gonna’ reach sixteen” and “Said you dug me since you were thirteen/ Then you giggle as you heave an’ sigh”.\n\nRobert Plant himself said in a Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone interview in 1975, “If you listen to ‘Sick Again’, a track from Physical Graffiti, the words show I feel a bit sorry for [the girls]. ‘Clutchin pages from your teenage dream in the lobby of the Hotel Paradise/Through the circus of the L.A. Queen how fast you learn the downhill slide’. One minute she’s 12, and the next minute she’s 13 and over the top. Such a shame. They haven’t got the style that they had in the old days … way back in ’68.”\n\nWhat am I supposed to do with that? Do I really want to listen to an album that promotes exploitation of underage groupies? And Plant isn’t describing some imaginary scenario outside of the band’s lived experience – if you don’t believe me, Google “Jimmy Page Lori Maddox” and see what comes up.\n\nThere is a part of me that says I shouldn’t ever listen to Physical Graffiti again because of its frankly revolting description of some band members’ relationships with underage girls. But then I have to stop and think – Lori Maddox also claims to have been involved with David Bowie and Mick Jagger – do I have to stop listening to their music too? What about Steven Tyler – in his autobiography he bragged about the teenage girlfriend he had in the 70s, who he took over legal guardianship for when she was 16 so he could take her across state lines. Dude should have seen the inside of a jail cell for that. Should I stop listening to Aerosmith? You don’t have to dig too hard to find out most of your rock idols should probably have spent some time in jail for statutory rape. Good heavens, Priscilla was 14 when Elvis met her, and even if (as she claims) he never went all the way with her until they were married, that’s still a pretty serious ick factor. Pretty much all of the guys who made the music I love were creepers – what kind of moral compromises am I making listening to their music?\n\nIt’s actually troubled me for a while, but I’m not ready to give up on the music I love, so I’m going to start doing some hard core rationalization. I’m actually pretty good at that. The thing I have to remind myself is that any music I listen to was probably made by somebody who did some pretty creepy things – it’s not like Haydn and Mozart were angels or anything (see this article).\n\nJust yesterday my far more musically adventurous and knowledgeable brother introduced me to the song “Tomorrow, Wendy”. There is no known universe or alternate dimension where I would have been cool enough to listen to Concrete Blonde back in the 90s, so even though the song is 30 years old I’d never heard it. Great song – depressing as hell, but great song. He and I were talking about how difficult it can be for a Christian to hear lyrics like\n\nI told the priest\n\nDon’t count on any second coming\n\nGod got his a** kicked the first time\n\nHe came down here slumming.\n\nHe had the balls to come\n\nThe gall to die and then forgive us\n\nNo I don’t wonder why I wonder what\n\nHe thought it would get us\n\nYeah, goodbye tomorrow Wendy is going to die.\n\nBut you know, I’m not sure that means a Christian should feel like they can’t listen to it. I get that it may be uncomfortable for them to hear Wendy’s point of view that God let her drift into a life of drug addiction and prostitution. I grew up hearing stories all the time about how God helped people find the lost keys to their Chevy Tahoes, but if He can find lost car keys but He can’t be bothered to nudge Wendy off the road to self-destruction, she has some good reasons for feeling the way she does. Lots of people who’ve been through hell on earth feel that way. Hearing their stories may be hard for a Believer to process, but then again hearing stories like that can also help a person develop a sense of empathy and understanding for where people are coming from – otherwise they just see Wendy as just a heretic and a harlot, rather than the forsaken soul she sees herself as. Other people have stories, and they may be beautiful or ugly or somewhere in between, but at the end of the day it’s their story, not ours. For the rest of us, it’s just something we are hearing. So I’m not sure we should think we need to avoid a song or artist we like just because they sing about something we disagree with. I think sometimes it’s ok to have a complicated relationship with a song you like. Life is full of complicated relationships.\n\nI have a complicated relationship with “Sick Again” – and by extension the album it resides on. Are there some reasons I should boycott it? Sure. Does the album, or the song at least, deserve to be “cancelled”? (By the way, I don’t buy into any of the arguments against “cancel culture”. 95% of the people who were “canceled” were being a dick about something and deserved it). Quite possibly. Should anyone with any semblance of a moral compass turn their backs on the song? Maybe, I can see some persuasive arguments for avoiding “Sick Again” due to its problematic moral content. At the same time, am I necessarily supporting the aberrant values the song describes if I still listen to it because I think it has a killer riff? Is it really an endorsement of the exploitation of young women if I think the song has a kick-butt beat? Listening to the song certainly doesn’t impact my own values and behaviors on the topic any more than listening to Jimi Hendrix’s “Hey Joe” makes me more likely to “shoot my old lady down” if she ever cheats on me. Hell, Johnny Cash could hardly pick up a guitar without singing about some guy shooting some other guy, and murder has got to be at least as bad as statutory rape. I don’t think anybody is going to argue that listening to Johnny Cash is supporting murder. When Johnny was singing a song, he was telling a story – much like Robert Plant was. It might be an ugly story, it might be a repulsive story, but listening to the story isn’t the same thing as endorsing the thing the story is about."
