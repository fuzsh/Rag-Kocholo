        "text": "My twentieth book (The Candymakers and the Great Chocolate Chase) came out this year. That feels like a big milestone when I worked so hard and dreamed so long of just writing one good enough to get published. I’ve thought a lot about gratitude over the years (Oprah really had something with that gratitude journal idea, or at least that’s where I first heard of it.) If you start writing down four things at the end of each day that you’re grateful for, you’ll spend your whole day looking for wonder, I promise you, and you’ll almost always find more than four.\n\nIn the Candymakers books Logan lists the things he’s grateful for each night before he goes to bed, and look how happy HE is! (although of course that might have something to do with living inside a candy factory, but you get the point. ;o). Top on my list for today (and every day) are my loved ones of course, but so are the readers out there opening book covers and falling into other worlds. You all know the power of being transported somewhere else, and returning to yourself feeling changed in some way. Thank you for taking my books with you on your journeys, and for trusting me to enough to let my stories live inside you. I will never take that for granted. Without the editors, librarians, teachers, and booksellers who have the seemingly magical gift of getting the right books into the right kids’ hands, I’d never be sitting here about to start book number twenty-one, so my deepest appreciation to you all. I wish everyone a happy, healthy, safe holiday season. A few thoughts to leave you with on gratitude, passion, and hard work…\n\nIf you’d like to order any personalized/signed books as gifts for the holidays (or anytime) you can do it through my local bookstore–I go in and sign them, they send them, someone reads them. Easy peasy!\n\nSparta Books: 973-729-6200\n\nps. Thank you anyone who has commented on previous blogs, and thank you for your patience in waiting for them to show up."
