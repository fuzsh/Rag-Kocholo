        "text": "🧒🏽📖👩🏻🏫👨🏽🏫 Did you know that children's books about diversity can teach valuable lessons about empathy and self-acceptance? At Anika Books, we believe that early education is the foundation upon which we build our future. By equipping children with the tools to accept and tolerate their fellow person, we can create a brighter tomorrow for all. Representation plays a crucial role in shaping a child's worldview. Children's books have the power to teach valuable lessons about diversity, empathy, and self-acceptance. At Anika Books, we strive to provide a collection of diverse books for children that includes people of color, people with disabilities, people with cognitive impairments, and the LGBTQ+ community. Representation allows all children to see themselves in an exciting story with a character they can relate to. This promotes a sense of belonging, leading to increased self-confidence and resilience. Let's inspire young minds and promote diversity in our communities! Head to anikabooks.com to explore our collection of diverse books today. 📚👧🏼 👦🏽🏫 #diversitymatters #representationmatters #inspiringyoungminds #anikabooks #childrensbooks #diversebooks #inclusiveeducation #empathy #selfacceptance\n\nGetting your finances in order often means sharing details of your life circumstances. For some members of the LGBTQ2S+ community, that can be very daunting. At #MyAssiniboine, our wealth advisors are committed to helping everyone who comes through our doors, no matter who you are or where you come from. You believe in a future worth investing in, and we are invested in a better future for you. Learn how our ACU financial advisors are helping members of the LGBTQ2S+ community build their personal wealth: https://lnkd.in/gvyTpQ5b\n\nStand for something or fall for anything. When Ben & Jerry’s took a bold stand on social issues, they became more than ice cream. They created a movement 🌍 Conflict became their superpower. They took courageous stances and advocated for racial justice, climate change, and LGBTQ+ rights. They focused on transparency about using Fair-trade ingredients and sustainable practices. And they became actively supported legislative changes and local programs they believed in. Even if it meant they’d be arrested! Most people and businesses shy away from conflict, but not taking a stand for what you believe in leaves you voiceless. What can multifamily learn from the creators of Cherry Garcia? To build a stronger brand: 👉 Align with causes your community cares about. 👉 Show your values in action. 👉 Turn conflict into conversations. Customers will see authenticity if you practice it. Lead with your values. Be bold. Be real. Build trust.\n\nPRIDE Month celebrates the visibility of the LGBTQ+ community and the dignity of individuals. It also reminds us that everyone's wealth has personal dimensions. At the Gibbons Jones Vogel Group, we understand that significant wealth brings unique challenges as well as opportunities to make life better for families and communities. Our team is proud to work with many successful LGBTQ+ clients. If you are LGBTQ+, your financial priorities may include philanthropy, long-term and elder-care concerns, and estate-planning services to protect a spouse or domestic partner and children. We can work with you and your other professional advisors to tailor wealth management strategies to your individual needs. Does your financial advisor understand the personal dimensions of your wealth? hashtag#GJVGroup Merrill, its affiliates and financial advisors do not provide legal, tax or accounting advice. You should consult your legal and/or tax advisors before making any financial decisions.\n\nDear teacher organisations and associations; public and private school boards (including Catholic, for example); colleges and university programs; directors and principals; publishing companies; and all other education businesses, Please consider these reflective questions about last month: 🏳️🌈 Are you proud of what you did for LGBTQ+ teachers, learners, and other staff this #Pride2024? 🏳️🌈 What's next in your game plan for year-long support for our community? 🏳️🌈 Do you need help?\n\nDid you know LGBTQ+ youth with disabilities often get bullied more at school? This can make school really tough for them. It's time to speak up! Everyone should feel safe and supported at school. How you can help: Spread the word: Share this post to tell others. Learn: Find out about the barriers LGBTQ+ youth with disabilities face. Support: Help students, parents, and teachers make schools welcoming and safe. Let's all work together to make sure every student feels safe, respected, and valued. #Pride2024 #DisabledAndQueer #PacificADACenter\n\n🌈 Happy Pride Month!! 🌈 PRIDE Month is one of my favourite times of the year. As someone that has gone through a coming out journey and having learned to really embrace who I am: this time of the year is a celebration of love, kindness and self-acceptance. However, it's really important to highlight that everyone's coming out journey is significantly different. The LGBTQ2S+ community continues to face high rates of bullying, violence and youth homelessness. 💡 For members of the community, take the month to celebrate who you are and the strength that comes from it. Know that community and support can come in many forms. You are never truly alone ❤️ 💡 For allies of the community, allyship can come in many forms: choosing to educate yourself on LGBTQ+ history, supporting local entrepreneurs and supporting small businesses, attending your company's employee resource group events, providing mentorship opportunities, and more. Make an active choice! #pridemonth"
