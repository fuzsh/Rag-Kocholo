        "text": "Writing fan fiction: a beginner's guide\n\nFan fiction is a type of writing that responds to something else like a book, a TV show or a film.\n\nPeople write fan fiction because they are big fans of their chosen story, and want to create more of it. They might imagine what happened before or after the story's main events or imagine other scenes in the lives of their favourite characters.\n\nFan fiction is a great way to get started with writing, because a lot of the work has been done for you. Characters, settings and plots are already there to be customised, changed and adapted. The possibilities are endless. Have fun!\n\nAll the fics\n\nFan fiction contains a wealth of different classifications of stories. You could kill off a character from an existing fandom and create a deathfic - their funeral, what happens after they die, and so on. Or you could write a silly, humorous version of the original and create a sillyfic! So where do you start? Here are some ideas to get you going...\n\nFan fiction glossary\n\nNot sure what squick means or whether you're writing drabble? Find out with our handy list of fan fiction terms.\n\nBeta reader: A fellow fan fiction fan who reads your story and makes suggestions for improvement before it is submitted or posted online.\n\nCanon: The original story and its accepted 'official' features (such as characters and plot).\n\nCosplayers: Fans that make and wear their own costumes based on a story's characters.\n\nDrabble: A fan fiction that is usually 100 words or less.\n\nFandom: The community that surrounds a TV show, film or book. Fan fiction writers, artists, poets, and cosplayers (fans that make and wear their own costumes based on a story's characters) can all be members of a fandom.\n\nFiclet: A fan fiction story approximately 100 words or less.\n\nMary Sue: A poorly developed character, too perfect and lacking in realism to be interesting\n\nPlotbunny: A rapidly developing idea for a story that won't leave you alone until you write it.\n\nSchmoop/Fluff: A romantic, 'fluffy' fan fiction story.\n\nSlash: Fan fiction that features existing (usually heterosexual, or 'Het' ) canon characters in homosexual relationships. Lesbian relationships or encounters can sometimes be termed Femmeslash, to differentiate.\n\nSquick: A cross between 'squeamish' and 'ick' - an awareness that there may be aspects of a fan fiction story that some readers may dislike, such as a character dying, sexual content or violent scenes."
