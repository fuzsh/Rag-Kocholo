        "text": "If there’s no single definition of what it means to be queer — a word whose meaning seems to shape-shift constantly, just like the culture around it — then there’s perhaps no consensus on what defines queer literature as a genre either. Still, one thing many queer people share is that we first discovered ourselves on the page. Often furtively, we read novels or recited poems or watched plays that seemed not only to speak exclusively to us, but also showed us a way of speaking about ourselves to others.\n\nBut among those works we sought out in school libraries or online, which have been the most influential in making and furthering queer culture? That was the question we posed to six writers — the essayist and novelist Roxane Gay, the playwright and educator James Ijames, the playwright and actor Lisa Kron, the journalist and TV writer Thomas Page McBee, the novelist Neel Mukherjee and the fiction and nonfiction writer Edmund White — who gathered over Zoom in early May for the latest installment of our T 25 list. Ahead of time, I’d asked everyone to nominate 10 or so works that we could discuss when we met, and we also exchanged some messages about the assignment’s parameters: We’d focus only on English-language literature (not in translation) that came out after the end of World War II, as queer life became less coded and began to flourish in the West, and we’d exclusively discuss novels, plays and poems (as opposed to, say, memoir or biography or other types of nonfiction — though this rule incited a whole debate within the debate). The writers also agreed not to select works by one another.\n\nThere was little agreement beyond all that — no surprise for a group of six spirited queers — and the shared desire to create a list that was less white, less male, less cis than those that’ve come before. Poetry, as it always does, spoke to different people in different ways, although everyone had concluded, by the end of the three-hour conversation, that they wanted to include a lot of it: Each panelist seemed to have a favorite collection, which they passionately persuaded the others to read or revisit. Trailblazers like James Baldwin and the butch icon Leslie Feinberg proved to be unignorable. So too was the underlying seriousness of this exercise (even if the disagreements themselves were lots of fun): In an era of new book bans and anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, the works chosen below, which are presented more or less in the order they came up, and not ranked, are proof of queer folks’ endurance. Like previous generations, younger people might escape to these books to find joy and sorrow, sex and death, fuller knowledge of themselves and the history they share. — Kurt Soller\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nSoller: Many of you sent me notes about how you framed your nomination lists, so I thought we could start by talking about what queer literature even is right now.\n\nLisa Kron: One thing that’s striking is that there’s so much to choose from. I don’t know what it means to say “most influential” — particularly in queer culture, where things come from the bottom up. I started with, “Who were the people and what were the works that ignited my creative imagination and revolutionized my thinking?” As I did that, I realized, “Oh, these are all people working inside what I consider dyke culture.”\n\nJames Ijames: I was interested in literature that either showed me myself or that had values that felt particularly queer: care and tenderness, stuff like that. Also: Writers who’ve impacted my politics. [James] Baldwin and [Tony] Kushner immediately came to mind. Essex Hemphill. The literature of the AIDS era has been fortifying for me — to read how people survived.\n\nThomas Page McBee: I might be unique to this group in that I’ve lived multiple queer identities. I was excited to see “Stone Butch Blues” on [others’] lists because that book spoke to me in two bodies across time.\n\n1. “Stone Butch Blues” by Leslie Feinberg, 1993"
