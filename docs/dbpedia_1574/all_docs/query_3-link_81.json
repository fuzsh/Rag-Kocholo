        "text": "Young Adult (YA) literature has become increasingly popular over the last few years. It’s probably because “Twilight,” “Hunger Games,” “Divergent,” “The Fault in Our Stars” and a handful of other YA books have been turned into movies. I like to think that’s the case because the books were great stories.\n\nSay what you want about YA novels, but they have an ability to capture the formative nature of teenage years that I’ve yet to see elsewhere.\n\nTake Stephen Chbosky’s “Perks of Being a Wallflower” for example. It’s the quintessential story of the high school misfit finding his place. But by adding a history of sexual abuse and mental illness, Chbosky writes a story that shows the impact our teenage years have on our lives.\n\nJohn Green does this in “Looking for Alaska” and “Fault in Our Stars.” One chronicles the average life of a guy in boarding school who’s in love with the girl he can’t have. The other is simply a love story of teenagers who understand the importance of living your life. Yet somehow, Green takes seemingly straightforward plot lines and puts into words the unexplainable feeling of being an invincible teenager.\n\nOf course, YA is done poorly as well. Just look at “Twilight” or “Divergent.” “Twilight” is about an unhealthy dependent relationship and “Divergent” is remarkably similar to other YA dystopian novels.\n\nAs much as I might enjoy the books for ease of reading after a semester’s worth of course required books, they really don’t do the YA genre any good. Both series use simplistic sentence structure that require no effort to read. Which I believe does a disservice to the young adult reading it.\n\nYA lit should be both a comfort and a challenge.\n\nThere’s nothing like a finishing a book like “My Heart and Other Black Holes” or “Made You Up” to find you’re not alone in your mental illness.\n\nIt’s great to read something like “None of the Above” and “Ready Player One” that force you to consider you beliefs.\n\nBut how can you make sure you fall in the category of successful and not reductive?\n\nBy writing a story that is relatable, not sentimental. By giving careful thought to the development of your characters and plot.\n\nThis is easy to read, but putting it into practice can be difficult. Sometimes, you just need that push to get you going.\n\nHere are 50 creative writing prompts for YA that are sure to help you on your endeavor to write a meaningful story. Mix them up if you think that works best for you, but make sure that in the end, you have created something that has helped you and your writing.\n\nTwo helpful links for YA writers:\n\n41 Top Agents for YA Fiction\n\n30 Best Publishers of YA Novels\n\n50 Creative Writing Prompts for YA Writers\n\nA brother and sister discover their dad has been having an affair with their favorite counselor at school.\n\nA girl is looking through old family albums with her mom and finds a picture of her as a child, sitting on the lap of man she doesn’t remember.
