        "text": "Be Dazzled by Ryan La Sala\n\nPublished by: Sourcebooks Fire\n\nReleased: 1st January 2021 (in the US)\n\nISBN: 9781492682691\n\nRead: 25-26 December 2020\n\nThis second novel by Ryan La Sala is different from his first, Reverie, in many ways, but of course, in so many others, it’s familiar. The queerness is alive and well, and it’s great to see a range of orientations represented so positively. Luca’s bisexuality is a major part of the narrative, and it’s welcome in YA.\n\nBut as our narrator, Raffy controls what we see, and when we see it. Flashing back has become a real trope, and I have grown weary of it. However, in this story, it serves as a release valve. The events in Raffy’s present timeline start badly and continue to disastrous, so to return to the past where he and Luca lean into their attraction is a glimpse into a happier time. Not that La Sala explains every event and misadventure. No, he leaves spaces for us to ponder: what exactly does Luca see in Raffy? Sometimes it seems as if he’s mostly spending time because of Raffy’s hobbies and flair. Also, the situation that develops with Inaya lacks detail. There is a lot of room for readers to come to their own conclusions, which is the type of book I love to advocate. Too many of them spell everything out and leave teens with little chance to explore ideas and motivations for themselves.\n\nThere are many twists and turns in this world of cosplay and costume design. We are treated to absent AND overprotective parenting. Friendships seem constantly on the cusp of breaking down, and Raffy’s own mental state is a thing of concern. But the immersion into this increasingly more mainstream space is fully realized. I have little awareness of manga worlds, devotion to fictional characters through crafting, and the influence of Youtubers and Instagrammers, yet I experienced Raffy’s stress and triumph completely and satisfactorily. This is the power of the author’s writing and his own knowledge and acceptance of the people who inhabit and commit to these fantastical communities. They own their weird and quirky ways, and we are better for such celebrations and joy.\n\nI received this uncorrected proof thanks to Netgalley and Sourcebooks Fire. Highly recommended to teens who enjoy being part of a tolerant and inclusive community. To those who appreciate that breaking up can sometimes be a good thing, and who cheer on the underestimated and underappreciated. Be Dazzled has a wonderfully appropriate cover and comes out (in the US) on New Year’s Day, 2021.\n\nThe Extraordinaries by TJ Klune\n\nPublished by Tor Teen\n\nReleased on 14 July 2020\n\nISBN 9781250203656\n\nRead 8 – 9 July 2020\n\nKlune’s first foray into YA fiction is a bold exuberant celebration of all things queer and geeky. There is a big nod to lots of fun pop cultural elements: fan fiction and superheroes; but as well there is an intense emotional arc that, while swerving a little too close to sentimental, also reflects a strong sense of questioning identity for young people—am I good enough the way I am?\n\nNick is on a bunch of spectrums. He’s ADHD, a total geek boy, a totally gay geek boy, and the grief from his mother’s death hangs over him like a heavy cloud. His very supportive father is an adorable inclusion into the narrative as a person who tries hard to protect Nick, while giving him freedom, but also demanding more. Because Nick’s inability to filter himself, his reckless, impulsive side is sometimes a bit scary. It’s not that he’s thoughtless. His brain is just wired to ignore consequences and sometimes makes dangerous decisions that should scare most people.\n\nLuckily, Nick is surrounded by loyal and straight-talking friends. Couple Jazz and Gibby tell him when he is taking things too far and follow him down erratic pathways. His best friend Seth has been missing in action over the summer, and now back at school, Nick is struggling to reconnect with this boy who has long been his secret crush (not helped by Nick writing a lot of slightly smutty fan fic about an Extraordinary called Shadow Star). Klune throws us straight into the middle of this complex relationship without giving all the backstory. He also includes Nick’s ex-boyfriend Owen, who is full of himself and incredibly hostile towards Seth. This dynamic is clearly more than what’s happening on page, and unfortunately for us, Nick’s oblivious narrative voice means we are constantly seeking out clues (which admittedly are dropped often), while he remains ignorant of what’s really going on with this pair of frenemies.\n\nNick puts himself at the centre of everything. This becomes tiresome, but since he is also very self-aware, he is able to keep readers on side, and our sympathy for him usually comes out ahead of our irritation at his antics and selfishness. But this is Klune very cleverly manipulating us and teasing us by incorporating the superhero elements of the story.\n\nLook, I know I am a bit confusing. But that actually is the structure of the book. We are initially baffled by Nick’s obsession with Shadow Star. We can see Seth is right in front of Nick, and yet Nick lives in the clouds looking through a lens that is idealized and somewhat tainted. We keep reading because basically Klune is a very funny, geeky dude who constantly surprises with the jokes and the humanity and the affection he has for his characters.\n\nAnd then everything starts to click, and the tension ramps up, and suddenly we are in the middle of a very suspenseful scenario and people could die people! So, we read on, worried for everyone, but especially our earnest, impulsive ordinary guy who without powers, takes on a hero’s journey because he must save those he loves, and he does it all with wit and intelligence, and a tiny spark of what the #$*? It’s extraordinary (gah, she had to go there). The resolution is nicely wrapped up, most mysteries are explained, and of course there’s a HEA…\n\nThen, because this is book one, Klune shoves one more twisty dark secret at us, and leaves us with our mouths open, eyes twitching, hearts racing, and our minds ticking. *Shakes fist at the sky* Damn you Klune and your cliff-hangers. But this might just be me. Ha.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and Tor Teen for advancing this to me oh so long ago before #coronavirus, and through a delay of publication. I hope it all goes well for this book. Recommended for teens who love their protagonists awkward and flawed, but who is all heart. The intense moments are powerful and authentic, and the story dances around a number of genres. It’s a celebration of life and love, and it looks like there will be more. The Extraordinaries finally comes out tomorrow.\n\nYes No Maybe So by Becky Albertalli and Aisha Saeed\n\nPublished by Simon & Schuster\n\nReleased on 4 February 2020\n\nISBN: 9781471184666\n\nRead: 24 – 25 December 2019\n\nYes No Maybe So is a thoughtful novel that encompasses a broad range of topical issues, wrapping them in a deliciously cute romance that will appeal to fans of Simon versus the Homo Sapien Agenda, which let’s face it, is practically every living teen on the planet right now. Albertalli’s novels reflect the concerns and celebrate the inclusiveness of this generation, and Aisha Saeed’s contribution to this one will ensure it continues.\n\nBasic plot is simple, but effective. Socially awkward, Jewish white boy, Jamie fears public speaking which is does not bode well for his dream of becoming a politician. Maya, an American-Pakistani Muslim girl, finding herself at a loose end for the summer, for a variety of awful reasons, is encouraged (more like blackmailed) into canvassing for Jordan Rossum, the democratic candidate for her local district election. Her reward at the end? A car. Jamie and Maya were best friends at childcare, over 10 years ago, and when their mothers reconnect and push them together, only one really is keen – Jamie. Maya is on board for the car. Not that she tells Jamie that. Unfortunately.\n\nSlowly, over the summer, they begin to share their fears, but not only that, as Rossum’s campaign gathers momentum, their optimism grows that they might be contributing to a brighter future. They also develop feelings for each other as they reconnect and support each other through family and friendship breakdowns. As you would imagine, they both make terrible mistakes towards the end, hurting each other. But of course, we know once they sit down, hash it out, and actually take some risks, everything will be okay.\n\nLook, it’s adorable.\n\nBut more than, it’s a call to arms. Albertalli and Saeed break down American’s political system into digestible chunks that will inform and entertain young readers. Other countries don’t have the exact systems of the US, however, connections can be made and parallels drawn, so that readers can see how corruption and power make it almost impossible for marginalized groups to be heard. The authors are having none of that. They make it clear that individuals can all do his or her (or their) bit to defeat racists, bullies, homophobes, or whoever else stomps on the rights of others. It’s inspiring stuff, and it never sounds preachy. The two main characters always feel like teenagers—awkward, powerless, and prone to impulsive acts and words—so their insights and observations feel true. They genuinely realise that helping local communities, uniting under a common belief despite differences, and working towards a single purpose is uplifting and exciting.\n\nThere are many complications that aren’t even touched on here. Messy family situations, the role of the media and the lasting impacts of social media, the additions of terrific animals, and the eventual realization of strong feelings make Yes No Maybe So an engaging and triumphant reading experience. I have no doubt any teenager will love its message and the way the message is delivered.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for advanced copy. I believe it’s out everywhere on February 4th. Highly recommended for contemporary book lovers, who enjoy well developed characters bumbling around trying to be their best selves. Who love inclusive stories that don’t shy away from tackling big subjects, but in a readable manner that isn’t heavy handed. I found it really hopeful and loved the way it presented options for teenagers who might be feeling overwhelmed by the constant barrage of negativity offered by mainstream media outlets.\n\nFrom my 170 reads (so far) of the year, I have whittled the list of favourites down to 22 (see picture below courtesy of Goodreads), and then down to a further five.\n\nSo here are my five favourite books of 2018 (in order of release date):\n\nAll of these books celebrate resilience and kindness. Each main character grows in ways unexpected and triumphant, and our journey with them through grief, trauma and acceptance is visceral and authentic.\n\nTruly, Wildly, Deeply by Jenny McLachlan March Bloomsbury\n\nI wrote a review here.\n\nThe Learning Curves of Vanessa Partridge by Clare Strahan May Allen & Unwin\n\nClever and layered, Van’s story starts as a light and frothy exploration of one girl’s musing on her sexual attractions and urges. She is self-aware and philosophical about the hypocrisy and double standards that apply to females compared with the way boys are encouraged to be sexual beings. Van’s wit and intellect ensure she gains our respect and sympathy. But there is a lot more going on here, and as the plot moves from Van’s inner life to her external one, readers are confronted with a shocking sequence of events, and the lightness turns dark and challenging. Van’s response, however, is both realistic and triumphant. She has the support of other women, who help carry her burden of guilt and shame. It is very pleasing to see a private school represented positively, and our assumptions about many characters are revealed to be false.\n\nStrahan’s skills are impressive as she balances a number of tones and shifting relationship dynamics. She also doesn’t spell everything out, trusting readers to fill in gaps and make their own judgments. Highly recommended.\n\nChanging Gear by Scot Gardner May Allen & Unwin\n\nScot Gardner’s latest book is driven by the phases of the moon. There are no prologues or epilogues, no chapters, and no sub-sections. It’s primarily one week in Merrick’s life when he runs away to find perspective and accept his beloved grandfather’s death.\n\nMerrick’s escape is preceded by a glimpse into his world for the last 6 months—uninterested in school, irritated by step-siblings he refuses to name, and a cloud of despair and indifference. He is unable to see a future for himself, made worse by his grandfather’s perfect commentary in his head. How does he step forward?\n\nGardner delivers the antidote—spend time alone, commune with nature, and meet strangers on the road to nowhere. Merrick’s clever mind and bruised heart are buoyed by these new connections, and we love the lessons young readers might take away. Live and love now, look ahead but not too far, and respect elders, mother earth and the people who love you. Wise words from a master storyteller.\n\nMerrick’s moral compass is balanced exquisitely with his teenage hormones, and everything about this book is believable and thoughtful.\n\nA Song Only I Can Hear by Barry Jonsberg July Allen & Unwin\n\nJonsberg has always played around with unreliable narrators, and has a clever turn of phrase. With protagonist Rob, he has created a sympathetic character, full of droll wit, quiet generosity, but riddled with anxiety and self-doubt. Readers immediately engage with Rob’s earnest, honest voice, and gradually realise how true and courageous he is, especially when he rises to the challenges to let himself be seen, to be heard. Jonsberg’s secondary characters are all a delight–from blankety swearing Granddad, and ocker, best friend, Andrew, right through to Trixie, ‘a fluffy ball of rubbish’. Warmth, affection and authenticity shine through everyone of them, especially their regard for Rob. The villains of the piece, Daniel and anyone involved in animal cruelty, get all they deserve, but of course, Jonsberg manages to twist readers right up until the final words, so that the focus stays on Rob, just as it should be.\n\nLenny’s Book of Everything by Karen Foxlee November Allen & Unwin\n\nA sublime exploration of family and survival. Lenore’s fierce and protective narrative voice astonishes and surprises, and the humour and warmth which imbues every scene creates an immersive reading experience. Set in 1970’s Ohio, Foxlee’s story is both timeless and timely. A book for everyone. I wrote more here.\n\nAllen & Unwin obviously nailed it for me. I have already started reading 2019 texts, and by all accounts, it looks to be another strong year for YA. Bring it on!\n\nThe Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue by Mackenzi Lee\n\nPublished by: Katherine Tegan Books\n\nReleased: June 27th 2017 (in the US)\n\nISBN: 9780062382801\n\nRead: October 28 2017\n\nA Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue is one which will need to be sourced internationally at this point. It’s a historical novel set in the 1700’s, with main character, Monty offering a strong narrative voice, who initially, seems very selfish and oblivious. This is realistic given his privilege and social standing. His father is a Viscount, and Monty is expected to toe the upper class line, however, he refuses. His rash and reckless behaviour takes a while to be explained. There is much trauma in his childhood, linked directly to his father’s discovery that Monty enjoys the (intimate) company of both girls AND boys. This attitude is historically correct, but as modern readers, we find this attitude abhorrent and unacceptable. While it hangs over Monty like a cloud, it doesn’t detract from the novel’s celebratory and hilarious tone. Of course, Monty grows as a character, and becomes much more worthy of the delicious Percy.\n\nMonty and Percy are on their ‘Grand Tour’, an adventure that takes them around Europe (Yes! There’s a map!), including an author note at the end showing her extensive research on the times. Monty and Percy are accompanied by Monty’s sister Felicity, who is depicted as an enigmatic, surly bookworm. We can expect to see her story in the future, and honestly, I can’t wait.\n\nI liked that this novel went places I didn’t expect, and while not everything was explained completely, the HEA was worth waiting for. There are pirates and gamblers and much shenanigans, mostly from Monty who really is just trying to do the right thing, and find his own place in this very narrowly conceived world. His courage and enviable flair are undeniable. It’s quite a long novel, and some patience is required while Lee sets up the location, the characters, and the situation. The ending is open, but hopeful. I will reread this one, for certain.\n\nThe Things We Promise by J C Burke\n\nPublisher: Allen & Unwin\n\nReleased: March 22nd 2017 (in Australia)\n\nISBN: 9781760290405\n\nRead: 29 December 2016\n\nI am going to spend some time over the next few weeks, transferring (and extending) some of the reviews I wrote for Riverbend Standing Orders through 2017. It’s a terrific service (#biased), and if you are in a school, you might want to consider subscribing to receive some awesome texts. My reviews are primarily directed at adults who hand out books to teens, so they may be slightly spoiler-y, and often provide little plot summary.\n\nJ C Burke has written a raw yet restrained story about grief and life. It’s clear she has personal memories of the time about which she writes, and her affection for her characters shines through.\n\nProtagonist, Gemma’s narrative voice keeps the story moving forward amid sadness and nostalgia. Burke’s style is chatty and breezy, but her subject matter is dark. The 1990’s don’t seem all that long ago (to me), and teenagers today have their own understanding of the mistrust and misinformation spread about the AIDS epidemic. But while this is an intimate portrayal of one young man’s situation, it could be any one of our friends or family members. The inclusion of stories of other men broadens the scope beyond Billy’s tragedy.\n\nThere are other things going on in Gemma’s life, and Burke deals with them all thoughtfully, while never diverting the attention away from what is her primary motive– to highlight the injustice faced by people with AIDS, and to mourn the loss and waste of young lives. Billy and Gemma’s mother represent liberal and supportive voices quietly suffocated by the fear and judgement so prevalent at the time. By the end, Gemma is reconciling her grief, with Burke carefully leaving her in a happy place, which provides a satisfying resolution for readers. This mature book will be suited to senior students who enjoy serious books with gritty realism and not necessarily happy endings. There is a hint of romance, and realistic friendship drama, but most importantly, there are positive and sensitive representations of what young gay men faced, and how they dealt with the isolation with dignity and courage.\n\nI found The Things We Promise moving and profound.\n\n180 Seconds by Jessica Park\n\nPublished by: Skyscape\n\nISBN: 9781503943360\n\nReleased: April 25\n\nRead: April 22 2017\n\n180 Seconds attempts to celebrate what’s good and positive about social media. While it also shows its ugly and vicious side, it tries to say most people are good, and if when given a chance, they will show kindness and care.\n\nEsben Baylor is a social media celebrity. His social experiments reach out to strangers and exposes life in its grimness and glory. He doesn’t seem to gain any financial rewards, but Park is evasive about that. We see him through the eyes of the protagonist Allison, an anxious college student who spends most of her days alone and lonely. She faces the world by placing impenetrable walls around herself. Apart from her fierce best friend Steffi, who lives on the other side of the country, and her adoptive father Simon, Allison keeps everyone else at a distance. Then she meets Esben, and everything changes for her.\n\nWhile we watch Esben and Allison fall for each other, there is a sense of inevitable disaster. There is too much happy, too much going right. Allison realises her boyfriend is a social media superhero, someone who embraces all that’s good in the world. She has never been on these networks, so her naivety is romantic and a novelty. The trope of the love interest showing the innocent new and wonderful ways to experience the world is strong in romance novels. Esben is thoughtful and humble, and exactly what a lot of readers want in their love interests. He does hide some secrets which have impacted on his life choices, but the author sets him up as the ideal antidote for Allison’s wariness and regimented life.\n\nTheir relationship is portrayed as strong and unbending. Which means of course, it will break. In the meantime, it is excellent to see Allison be brave and reach out to Esben’s sister Kerry, and a college roommate, Carmen. She is rewarded with two new strong friendships. Another positive element is Allison’s realisation of how much fatherly love Simon provides, and by just acknowledging his efforts and finally calling him ‘dad’, she can return his affection. Sometimes it’s that simple.\n\nBut the disaster, when it finally arrives, is predictable yet jarring. I found Steffi’s demands unrealistic. I understand the reasons why the author takes this route, and I was moved by the subsequent scenes, but I also felt a bit manipulated. Despite this, I cried a lot. Some of it is quite powerful. It’s hard to talk about what happens without giving away spoilers, but many readers will work it out themselves, and maybe save themselves tissues.\n\nMy copy was provided by publisher via Netgalley and read with thanks. Recommended to readers who have previously enjoyed Park’s other novels, and to romantics who like their stories full of perfect relationships, and drama that is explained and resolved. I would argue this is New Adult because the characters are in college. There are references to sex and a rape that occurred in the past, and the characters drink (underage by American standards).\n\n180 Seconds is out on April 25th.\n\nThis is the other category that demands more than three books. Because if we want to represent as many of the letters as possible, well, we have to open the field. Not all the full spectrum of the rainbow is here. I am sure the books exist, I just didn’t have a chance to track them down, and read them all, unfortunately. But two others that I also loved include Girl Mans Up by M E Girard (September 2016)and The Other Pants by M G Hennessey (more of a middle grade book, which is excellent in itself) (also September 2016).\n\nThis Song is (not) for you by Laura Nowlin (January 2016)\n\nI read this almost a year ago, and still have strong memories of it being different and more socially conscious than a lot of teen novels. Ramona wants to save the environment, bring peace to war torn countries, and she acts locally too. Big dreams. Sam and Tom add their narrative voices, and this threesome is quirky and eventually learn to care little for how others define them. I love how they refuse to adhere to labels, and find spaces for each other. The parents in this novel play positive, and supportive roles which is great to see. It’s unusual and challenging. I know I haven’t explained how it fits into this category, but I wanted it to be spoiler-free. If you want to know more, my long review is at Goodreads.\n\nDrag Teen by Jeffrey Self (April 2016)\n\nNobody dies in Drag Teen, and TJ’s theatrical identity crises are more angsty fun than dark drama. Also road trip!! On his way to take part in a drag competition for teens (what else?) to win himself cash to help attend college, TJ works through his lack of self-belief, deals with the fragile bonds of friendship, and strengthens his love with Seth. Celebratory, offering a different type of queerness, it’s bold and big (as the wigs) and sparkly (as the diamontes), and says much to kids who have flamboyant and dramatic dreams. An off-beat adventure.\n\nIf I was your girl by Meredith Russo (June 2016)\n\nRusso’s story of a transitioning teenager is a bit darker. There are issues with bullies, requiring Amanda to move in with her father in another state. She tries to keep under the radar, and hide her secrets, but they always have a way of getting out. Lucky by this time, she has support, she has gained confidence, and there’s even a boy who likes her. So, even though there are difficult times to navigate, it offers more hope than hurt. Which is good, because there needs to be more happiness in these sorts of books.\n\nYou Know Me Well by Nina LaCour & David Levithan (June 2016)\n\nAnother celebratory novel, full of queers across all points of the spectrum, working out ordinary everyday teen issues – friendships, unrequited love, built up expectations, getting in underage to a dance club, basically experiences all teens (should get to) face. These kids just happen to be mostly gay. It’s glorious. I really appreciate the philosophy about living in the present. Too often teens books point readers to the future. The dual narrators work seamlessly and aren’t *shock! horror!* romantically linked. It’s so great. Platonic love is just as important here as romantic love. I enjoyed this a lot. Here is my review at Reading Time.\n\nIt Looks Like This by Rafi Mittlefehldt (September 2016)\n\nThe darkest and saddest LGBTQIA book I read this year. I know I shouldn’t give away spoilers, but seriously we need to move away from the trope of death to make a point, and for people to see they need to mend their ways. Mike’s narrative is quiet and seemingly ordinary, but the gaps are large and horrifying. Gay conversion centres are an actual thing, and in today’s political climate, it’s timely to make them part of the YA literature conversation. Another one that I reviewed at Reading Time.\n\nHere’s the Thing by Emily O’Beirne (October 2016)\n\nAn unexpected pleasure. O’Beirne is Australian but publishes with Ylva Publishing, a European company focusing on women’s literature, particularly lesbian fiction. It’s a good fit, and this book, Emily’s fourth, is excellent. Zel’s voice is wonderful, confident yet hesitant. She’s a photographer, and Art pretty much dominates the discussion between characters, and drives the plot. It’s terrific. The settings alternate between New York and Sydney, and nice contrasts are set up between seasons and destinations. There are also a range of well developed secondary characters that are integral to Zel’s character development. The tone is fresh and appealing. Because I snagged it from Netgalley, I wrote a long review at Goodreads.\n\nOn Friday, I want to highlight my three favourite Australian YA novels (sooo hard to pick).\n\nIt’s taken me about a week to work my way through these collections, 12 stories in each. I alternated one from My True Love Gave to Me (hereby referred to as Winter), and one from Summer Days and Summer Nights (shortened to, you guessed it, Summer), although something happened at the end, and I had to read the last two Summer stories consecutively…but that’s neither here nor there. For those of you who do care, here are some simple stats and happy coincidences. (Although I am more than happy to give credit to Stephanie Perkins to her amazingly, psychic powers resulting in me being able to make these patterns).\n\nEach book has stories by three authors whose work I hadn’t read previously\n\nEach book had five stories with magical or wondrous elements, and seven that didn’t.\n\nAfter I read David Levithan’s snarky and bittersweet boy-loves-boy Winter story, Your Temporary Santa, I found myself reading Tim Ferderle’s snarky and bittersweet boy-not-so-much-loves-boy in the Summer compendium, Souvenirs. Loved them both obviously.\n\nHmm, thought I had more than that.\n\nAnyhoo… moving right along, these books work in companion because here in Australia we celebrate Christmas in the summer, so I read Winter for the seasonal feels, and I read Summer for, well, clearly the heat, and the beaches, and the swimming, and the sweating, through which I am currently suffering enjoying. Well, the swimming at least.\n\nI can’t talk about all the stories, but I do want to highlight a couple from each book. For example, as soon as I thought to read these, I headed straight to Stephanie Perkins in Winter, and fell in love with the snarky talky-talk between Marigold and North. Their banter is fine.\n\nIt’s an all-in-one-night story, and ends most satisfactorily. So it was an even better surprise when I immediately opened Summer to Perkins’s story, and found myself once again with Marigold and North. North’s witticisms are even better.\n\nMarigold’s determination to sort through North’s silent treatment is wonderful. Again, it happens all in one day (this time), and concludes happily (thank goodness).\n\nI then went back to the beginning, and read story for story, one from Winter to one from Summer, and it was delicious to open my heart to these new characters, sometimes strange landscapes, and often bittersweet relationships. There are other excellent elements in play: Diverse backgrounds (The Lady and the Fox; Angels in the Snow; It’s a Yuletide Miracle, Charlie Brown!; What the Hell have you done, Sophie Roth?; and Welcome to Christmas, CA from Winter. And In Ninety Minutes, turn North; and Good luck and Farewell in Summer), LGBTQIA characters (Your Temporary Santa in Winter, and The End of Love; Souvenirs; and Love is the Last Resort in Summer), and disabilities represented positively (A Thousand Ways this could all go wrong in Summer). Grief was also prevalent. It seems teenagers suffer death of loved ones in many and varied ways. It’s a strong emotion which many young people experience and ultimately heal (mostly).\n\nThe wondrous stories are written by authors who have some of the best YA Fantasy around – Holly Black, Kelly Link, Kiersten White, and Laini Taylor in Winter, and Leigh Bardugo, Libba Bray, Veronica Roth, Cassandra Clare, and Lev Grossman in Summer. These stories sit all along the magical spectrum – some offer only a tiny taste, some interweave quite strong paranormalcy (ha. see what i did there?) while one author builds an utterly new world (might be part of her new series perhaps?)\n\nI want to highlight more quotes. For their sweetness, for their insight, for their snark.\n\nDavid Levithan is a master of the perfect memory: (Your Temporary Santa in Winter)\n\nTim Federle captures that millennial cynicism: (Souvenirs in Summer)\n\nI must ALWAYS add a quote about libraries and/or books: (The Map of Tiny, Perfect Things by Lev Grossman, the last story in Summer)\n\nAnd two from Laini Taylor because… well, it’s Laini Taylor: (The Girl who Woke the Dreamer, the last story in Winter) (ooh another happy coincidence)\n\nfrom the girl:\n\nfrom the dreamer:\n\nBoth of these collections are highly recommended. While there may one story in each book that might not end completely happily, the majority leave readers happy, refreshed, and satisfied."
