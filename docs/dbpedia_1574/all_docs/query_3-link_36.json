        "text": "Defining Minority in Books\n\nIn math, a minority is simply the smaller piece of the pie. However, in society, a minority (according to Dictionary.com) is a group subordinate to and sometimes but not always smaller than the dominant political, financial, or socially powerful group. Think race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation.\n\nFor the purposes of this blog post, minorities are groups of people underrepresented in literature. That includes some of the traditional minorities and some groups of people who aren’t seen as minorities in everyday life but still rarely make an appearance in creative writing.\n\nWho Are the Minorities in Literature?\n\nWho is underrepresented in books is a bit of a moving target. LGBTQ characters used to rarely be featured in creative writing. Now you can find them frequently in most genres, especially young adult literature. That doesn’t mean they aren’t still a minority; just that they have more representation now than in earlier decades.\n\nHere are some traditional and current book minorities:\n\nNon-white characters (such as Native Americans)\n\nReligions other than Christianity\n\nPeople from low economic classes\n\nLGBTQ characters\n\nDisabled characters\n\nIt’s especially rare to find main characters who fall into more than one of these categories. People are complex. We aren’t just one thing. Neither are your characters.\n\nHere are some book-specific minorities:\n\nDifferent body types (males who aren’t muscular and females who aren’t skinny)\n\nCharacters, especially love interests, who are average-looking\n\nElderly main characters\n\nPregnant women\n\nMany of these minorities were created because books are really dreams, and why dream of someone who isn’t super attractive? Well, when you only write about super attractive people, you’re teaching people who don’t identify as attractive that they aren’t as worthy. Same thing when other kinds of people aren’t represented.\n\nSometimes genres have their own specific minorities. These are often the flip-side of overused tropes and archetypes. By making one type of character the norm, you exclude another. Here are some genre-specific book minorities:\n\nYoung adult protagonist who isn’t snarky or witty\n\nSci-fi female lead who’s not a badass fighter\n\nContemporary fiction about a traditional minority character where their minority status isn’t a main plot point\n\nFamilies in a lot of genre fiction\n\nPoor or low-middle class romance couples\n\nOften minorities in genre fiction are created by long lasting trends. Writing on trend is not a problem. Just make sure you’re providing your own unique, fresh take. Switching up the majority cast is one way to do that. If your first instinct is to make your nurse character a white female, pause to see if that’s the best choice for your story. Or are you relying on convention? What if you wrote your nurse as Muslim male instead?\n\nWhich minority you choose to write is entirely up to you. In my modern fairy tale collection When Magic Calls, I included quite a few characters who fall into a minority category. Some were a purposeful decision to write from the point of view of someone different from myself like the Chinese protagonist of “Letters from a Wu” and the wheelchair-bound African American boy from “Bones of the Soul.” Others were characters who popped into my head as minorities, including a love-sick lesbian lead.\n\nIf you are choosing to write from the point of view of someone very different from yourself, remember to be respectful and do your research. Writing a character who falls into certain politically charged minority categories badly can be worse than having an entirely majority-based cast. I recommend starting with an underrepresented category you know well. I grew up in New Mexico, which has large Hispanic and Native American populations. Knowing a plethora of people who fit into these categories gave me the confidence and knowledge to write them.\n\nAlso, the more diverse your cast, the wider the audience you appeal to. People read to escape and to experience someone else’s life for a bit. If all of your characters feel the same, you cheat your reader out of that escape and experience.\n\nI challenge you to write a character who fits into a literature minority category, but pick a category you yourself do not also fit into. Start learning about this person. If you need more ideas for developing your minority character, check out my follow up article Majority Bias: How to Make Certain Readers Know Your Characters.\n\nAn Editor’s Thoughts on Representation in Literature\n\nMore than ever, readers want to recognize themselves in the stories they love. That means writers need to be more flexible and step outside the traditional characters to diversify their casts. However, this is not easy. There are people out there who think writers should only write characters like themselves. These people even go as far as to claim women should only write from the points of view of women and men from men’s perspectives. By that logic, whole genres like science fiction, fantasy, action adventure, and more shouldn’t exist because no one has lived those lives. Know that those people and opinions are out there. Be prepared to brush them off.\n\nMore often than not, it’s critics and jealous authors who spread this message, not readers. Readers want you to try to write minorities, even if you don’t execute your characters perfectly. Because when you try to represent more kinds of people, you show those people that they have a place in literature and the real world and that it is not just okay but right to be the way they are. That is a powerful lesson in self-esteem. That is the power and influence of books. Write diverse characters bravely for your readers and to Ignite Your Ink."
