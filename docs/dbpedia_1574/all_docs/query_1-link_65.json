        "text": "Most likely no blog post next week, taking some time to enjoy summer.\n\nMy kids just lectured me about how most adult presenters do a horrible job presenting to youth. Since I had to sit through the lecture, I thought I’d pass along some of the wisdom. I sent the kids to bed so I can write, please check back to the original blog post since I may make corrections or additions once the youth of the house review it.\n\nWhy is this on a racial equity blog? Many times, I preach about reaching out and hearing from a lot of different people. Youth often have opinions about things that impact them and we should work hard to listen and include their views. According to the sample size of 2 (my own kids) they feel the adults they interact with need to spiffy up their presentations and interactions. Take what you want from this post and make sure to ask other youth from your own community how to make your presentations and interactions more relatable.\n\nRule #1 Make Yourself Credible and Relatable.\n\nIntroduce yourself and lead with your credentials or at least explain why you’re speaking and why they should care. Both of my kids said to embellish this a little if needed. They also said to make sure to make your credentials relatable to the youth. If you have an obscure job title, explain what it is and why it relates to them. As an example, my kids are really not impressed with my job if I say “I work in education policy,” snooze fest. If I say, “I work with others to make the rules that govern your school day,” they perk up and suddenly have a ton of opinions about how their school days could be better. I might be stretching a little, but that could be a definition for education policy.\n\nAlso don’t be the cringy adult that tries too hard to be one of them.\n\nDon’t be a guest speaker during lunch.\n\nYouth really hate it when you are a guest speaker during their free period. If someone invites you to be a guest speaker during lunch or breaktime, you’re sunk. Maybe ask to speak at another time when the kids will more likely want to hear your message.\n\nMake it Interactive.\n\nIf you do present during lunch, make the presentation interactive. Not cheesy interactive, but ways to draw them in. Group activities with their friends is a good way to keep them engaged.\n\nDon’t over explain, make sure the kids can understand it quickly.\n\nIf you can’t explain the concept quickly, then you’re sunk. The information needs to be relatable and understandable. Don’t talk down to the youth, but keep the presentation understandable. This is also important if you have an audience with immigrants or English learners – can they understand the presentation and keep up?\n\nKeep Your Presentation Slides Engaging and Simple.\n\nIf you PowerPoint slide has a lot of text the youth will glaze over it and tune you out, trust me I watched them do that when I showed them a sample PPT deck – they critiqued it to smithereens, the only thing they praised was a picture of Amanda Gorman I had stylishly placed after watching some Instagram Reels on how to make fancy slides. My younger kid will tune you out if your PPT deck is bland. She likes making presentation decks so she knows what she’s looking for. It must have relevant information, but not too much. Have a decent background, but not too cluttered – big no to the plain white background. The fonts and colors need to be easily read, which is also important for visual accessibility.\n\nMake your point, don’t let the kids get bored.\n\nKeep your presentation on point. If you drone on for too long the youth will tune you out and will let you know it. It isn’t disrespectful behavior, it is mirroring back what they think of your presentation.\n\nGive them real world problems you are grappling with.\n\nThe youth are smart and have a lot of different perspectives on problems. As we were talking about how to keep presentations relevant they asked about my day job and said their cohort of classmates would have a lot of thoughts about how to fix education. They said bring problems to them and elicit their real world experience to help come up with solutions.\n\nThey said the problems should be presented well and in ways that are relatable and understandable (see prior points). Some of their answers might not work in real life BUT that is the point, often adults have too much information and we miss the kernels of new original thinking. The kernels can lead to new ways of seeing a problem and coming up with a different solution that works better for youth.\n\nManage the room fairly.\n\nOne of the pet peeves of my kids is when adults are not fair. Youth know when you’re not being fair with the entire group. Watch your biases and manage your presentation in ways that allows for everyone to participate fairly. Pay attention to who you call on, where you look, who you’re relating to and who you’re having a harder time relating to. The kids catch these clues and will either engage more if they can tune into you, or tune you out if you’re subtly tuning them out.\n\nDon’t Disrespect Them.\n\nIf you are presenting at the youth, you’ve lost them. Don’t disrespect them because you think you have a captured audience and some other adult is forcing them to listen to you. Respect their time and attention, be prepared, be engaging, and relatable. Make them care about whatever you’re talking about.\n\nGood luck. I hope you get to interact with youth soon. Listen to them and ask for their feedback. Maybe we’ll solve some big problems with their fresh insights.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers. At this time I don’t offer ‘extras’ or bonuses for Patreons.

The name “The Lake House” reminds me of horror movies – a charming house, a big body of water, an isolated spot — all perfect for a horror movie. I thought I’d take a stab (ha, a pun) at writing some light horror titles for the blog.\n\nFirst a few in honor of the Americans with Disability Act turning 34 tomorrow, and July is Disability Pride month, we’ll start with a few horrors for people with disabilities.\n\n15° Slope – The horror of trying to navigate a ramp that is too steep and with bumps\n\nThe Cord – As electric vehicles become more common, all of those charging cords are draped over sidewalks. So annoying. They are tripping hazards, bad for wheelchair users to have to bump over, and if you want to strangle someone it makes it much easier – please don’t.\n\nAnxiety, The Election 2024 – The title is self explanatory. Hopefully we turn it into not a real life horror movie.\n\nKareem and the Karens – Kareem must escape a room full of white women, all named Karen. The Karens are ‘good people’ who aren’t racist — they could never be. They compete to adopt Kareem as their office project. They start out nice giving him banana bread, then move on to knitting him hats, and finally insisting on giving him a nickname of Ken. He attempts to plot his escape, will it work or is he in so deep he can never escape?\n\nDorm Fever – Five college freshmen, all from different racial backgrounds, like a 2024 Target ad, move into a dorm. They are part of an unwitting experiment to see who will survive the longest as a laboratory virus takes hold and preys on those with the highest stress levels.\n\nThe Maze – A Latina lawyer attempts to rise in the world of corporate law. She thinks she’s being mentored by a lawyer who acts as a fixer to the city’s most powerful people. Can she survive the bland ‘power lunches,’ fundraisers where everyone gets sloshed, and will people step aside so she can lead?\n\nCondensation in Drips – A group of POC volunteers get called before an all-white organization and told how wonderful they are for doing “God’s work.” The nightmare continues when they are continually questioned but praised at the same time.\n\nChildren of the Soybean – As Asian family moves into a rural town that grows soybeans. The towns people believe they will save the dying soybean crops but only if the family sacrifice their youngest.\n\nThe Hiring – A Black person being interviewed for a job by an all-white hiring panel. Wait this isn’t a horror movie, this happens in real life ALL THE TIME.\n\nAn Asian in a City without Rice – This would be a nightmare. I cannot.\n\nHave a chuckle with me and let’s make sure these stay as fictional movie titles.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers. At this time I don’t offer ‘extras’ or bonuses for Patreons.

It is the longest real life election soap opera filled with – court cases (multiple – both sides), medical emergencies, fighting in front of the proverbial kids, the grandparents (Supreme Court) interjecting, the in-laws and neighbors, Congress, tsking from the side and trying to make their desires known. It makes the presidential scandals of the past look quaint.\n\nThrough all of this we fail to talk about the real problems because we can’t name them. A few example: The problem isn’t the Supreme Court being filled with conservatives. The problem is by design that it has so much power and no real accountability or oversight back to the people. It worked well when it self-governed but we’re in an era where self-correction is out the window.\n\nThe problem isn’t two Presidents who will not step aside, the problem is we have a system that doesn’t encourage or reward new leadership to emerge. If we look at other governance systems, the US is odd in having two parties so heavily control political outcomes. Again, it worked when it worked but maybe we need to reevaluate.\n\nThe problem is we also don’t encourage or incentivize diversity in elected offices. Everything from who can vote, to gerrymandering, to how expensive it is to run for office plays into the diversity of our electeds. I know someone is going to point out that there are Black and Brown people in [fill in the blank] office, which is great, and we still have a long way to go until we see elected bodies reflective of the populations they serve overall. While there may be diversity, we also need to recognize diversity by itself doesn’t undo racism, or the structures that uphold racism.\n\nThe problem isn’t people don’t want to vote. The problem is we don’t want Black and Brown people, poor people, justice involved people, disabled or elderly people, immigrants to vote. People in control make it impossible for them to vote so others can keep control.\n\nDefine the problems\n\nWe need to clearly define problems with our political system if we want to fix them. If the problem is people aren’t voting, we need to ask why. The first why will uncover a superficial answer – they don’t care, they aren’t registered, they don’t think their vote will count, etc. Digging further is where the meat is – why aren’t they registered, why don’t they think their vote will count. Once you start digging community led solutions will emerge. The path to a solution is clearer when the problem has been clearly defined too.\n\nWe have a long few more months before the presidential election is settled. You can help to create a new election system that will drive towards better results. Take 15-min to reach out to someone you know, who may be on the fence about voting and listen to them, help to define the problem and potential solutions.\n\nWe need systemic change, but we also need smaller actions. November 2024 will be here soon, so until then the election soap opera continues.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers. At this time I don’t offer ‘extras’ or bonuses for Patreons.

The commission goes into purchasing books by POC authors or about disabilities to donate to high-poverty public schools.\n\nGuest blogger Carrie returns this week with a timely blog post about the upcoming presidential election, abelism, and disability justice.\n\nThe July 4th cover of The Economist was a picture of a walker with the Presidential seal, accompanied by “No Way to Run a Country.” The article about why Biden must withdraw included a subheading: “The president and his party portray themselves as the saviours of democracy. Their actions say otherwise.”\n\nRegardless if you feel as if the presidency is an underwhelming lifetime achievement award or pivotal to seeing the next generation exist, you have to take note that this move by The Economist is well-played and ableist. A walker symbolizes not only aging and decline, which will happen to all of us, but also feeblemindedness, vulnerability, incompetence, and dependence. On the cover, the walker is empty– there’s no picture of Biden, nothing happening, just a mobility device taking up space, while no work is performed.\n\nAs a disabled person, I cringed at the cover, but I was not surprised. The quickest way to undermine someone is to question their competence and professionalism. The Economist’s line about saviourism is apt, too. It reads to me as: Disabled people are so frail, such a suck on society, that they cannot even save themselves. They expect nondisabled people to take care of them and give them leadership positions? Who are they fooling?\n\nMost disability organizations are not even led by disabled people because a charitable view of disability pervades society. Disabled people can be inspiring, can remind us of how grateful we are to not be like them, can be funny and self-effacing, and overachievers, but they cannot be full or flawed humans. They must understand their place, show gratitude, and understand their access to power can be easily taken away. Every leadership position I’ve occupied has felt like this dance between advancing disabled folks as leaders and not offending nondisabled folks who were kind enough to hire me or allow me to remain in place. I realize that perspective reflects an unhealthy dose of internalized ableism, but to go through the world as a leader with disabilities, especially one with mobility equipment, is to feel precarious. It isn’t the equipment that makes me precarious– it’s the nondisabled people.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I believe much of how nondisabled folks react to disabled people is not intentional, and sometimes, not even within their awareness. The reality is that becoming disabled is one of people’s greatest fears, along with aging and death. If people are grappling internally with their terror about becoming like me or having to stand behind a walker, then they can’t see me or others in my community as full people.\n\nOthers in disability communities have altered The Economist image with a reminder that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had disabilities. My first reaction to this reclaiming of disability was President Roosevelt seemed to feel tremendous pressure to conceal his disabilities and mobility equipment. Early narratives that touched on his disability were focused on him “overcoming paralysis and polio”, which only further makes disability something to avoid, get rid of, or make palatable to others. The reality was FDR realized that too much sharing of his disability made him unelectable. I understand the community’s need to claim FDR as one of our own, but I also imagine he would not be leading the celebrations of July as Disability Pride Month. Similarly, I have no idea what President Biden’s sense of disability identity is, apart from his acknowledgment of his experiences with stuttering.\n\nI’m not sad or enraged for Biden, but I am for anyone who sees that cover and thinks, “Well, that’s confirmation of something that I’ve always felt– no one sees me as fit to lead.” How long will it be before we have mainstream magazine covers where our most powerful leaders across sectors and at all levels of elected office are sporting their mobility equipment as a sign of strength, pride, and function?\n\nCarrie Basas (she/they) is a consultant with CoDesignWorks: carrie@codesignworks.com.

Carrie is a frequent guest author on the blog.\n\nIn 2019, on a whim I decided instead of celebrating my birthday with stuff for me I wanted to donate 40 books to schools in my neighborhood. I vaguely mentioned it on Facebook, Carrie saw the post and text to say she wished she could do the same. Since we both have February birthdays I invited/told her to join me. It worked out great since she brings a disability justice focus which compliments my focus on POC authors — both of which are under-represented in publishing and books.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe short version of how this project works, is for our birthdays instead of accepting gifts or other stuff for ourselves we put together a wishlist of books that match our criteria. Any book we accept has to be by an author of color, or about disabilities. We have rules – the books about disabilities can’t be overly sad, no disability porn, and nothing about people with disability dying. For the books by authors of color, they must be K-12 appropriate. We also request new books or very gently used books.\n\nOur friends and family are generous and have fun choosing books that resonate with them to donate. The books get shipped to me and part of my house becomes a temporary book warehouse. I keep a spreadsheet of what is donated and who sent it. We share the progress on social media and this becomes a fun community project.\n\nIn the spring the books are delivered to schools. We have a few schools we consistently donate to their school libraries. It’s been fun to develop relationships with the librarians and teachers at these schools. They know we are bringing high quality books that often help to diversify their school libraries. I often add new releases to our wishlists which can help schools get these books more quickly into the hands of students. I like reading the new releases and know students feel the same.\n\nNew this Year\n\nOne of the reasons I wanted to re-share this annual project this year is several friends have done similar projects for their birthdays. Nisha, a teacher friend, said she now wants to be like Dolly Parton, and create her own Dolly Parton Imagination Library. For her birthday she held a birthday book drive too and had her family and friends gift her books. She wrapped the books so her first graders could each open a new book for their classroom library refresh. Another friend did the same and invited her friends to bring books to a silent reading party during her birthday and donated them to school libraries.\n\nIt’s been so much fun to watch this project grow. Knowing we’re helping to diversify the books students have access to. With people trying to ban books – books mostly about people of color, LGBTQ, and other experiences that make them feel something – it is important to ensure we’re providing access to high quality books where we can.\n\nThis year we focused on including books by Washington authors of color. This was really fun since it made the connections even more local. A friend who wrote the book Nervous was so thrilled to know her book was heading into the hands of high school students. I was at one of the schools that received her book and saw it prominently displayed in the school library – I’m sure it will be read many times.\n\nYou!\n\nI hope this inspires you to do something for your local community. I realize how privileged I am to have so many good friends who embrace this book drive every year. Maybe the something for you is different, such as sharing your favorite POC authored book title with someone else so they learn about it. Or during your birthday you invite someone to trade a book with you so you both learn something new. For me the book drive is about connections and wanting to share something I love with students. I hope you find something that matters to you and share it with others.\n\nBook List\n\nHere are some of the books that were donated. Sharing this list is always a fun part of this blog post since it is such a rich list of titles, authors, and hopefully you find a new book to read.\n\nThe coding is mine, apologies for any errors — I tried my best.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers.

It is a deck of prompts with whimsical and on point descriptions. A colleague chose a number and the card in that place was about gentleness – I read the description to the group and invited people to share what came up when they heard the description. It was really nice to hear how people were experiencing and witnessing gentleness.\n\nSome of the stories were sweet, including stories of family members with new teeny-tiny babies. Some of the stories were hilarious of pets who emoted with their humans or the opposite of dogs who tolerated being cuddled. Other stories were sweet but heartbreaking.\n\nOne of the stories shared was of a Black parent who was advocating for his Black son. The father needed to advocate for his son since many of the non-Black adults in the child’s life saw the child as a threat due to his size and disability. To the father he saw a gentle boy, who deserved to be seen and treated with gentleness. The father also realized the world doesn’t give him the benefit of being seen as gentle either – it was honest, heartbreaking, and true. He understood being treated with gentleness is a privilege versus a right – he hoped the world would shift to making it a right versus a privilege to earn as a Black man.\n\nBias and Gentleness\n\nWe all have biases, and they play into who we see and treat with gentleness. Anyone who tells me they don’t have biases or they are cured of biases because they took anti-bias trainings are met with a lot of side-eye. Biases are a part of who we are, and we can’t undo all of the biases we have. We can work to be more aware of them and work to not react so quickly to our biases.\n\nBefore the conversation I had with the team about gentleness. The quote from my colleague around gentleness shouldn’t be a privilege really made me think about who I give automatic privilege to around being gentle and how this might not be fair. It also made me think about who is forced to ‘armor up’ or purposefully fawn and not armor up to be seen as gentle. Race, skin color, economic privilege, education, etc. all play into who gets to be seen as gentle.\n\nIf I tell you, our lunch guest is my friend named Millie and she’s a neonatal nurse. What comes to mind? For me a women, who is pleasant and non-threatening, maybe soft-spoken or if not soft-spoken at least not threatening. I’m also assuming she knows how to gently handle people since she deals with tiny babies and their families all day. I would give her the benefit of being seen as gentle automatically.\n\nNow, if I told you we were having lunch with a different friend named Maverick or Hatch and their job is a high-priced defense attorney – what comes to mind? Probably not the first image of a gentle person. Note in this example I did not use a genderized pronoun, did that change who you thought of reading the profile?\n\nIn those two examples, I didn’t say anything about race or any other physical characteristics. Now imagine if we layered in race, culture, language, disability, voice, etc. into the profiles, does this change how you envision a gentle person?\n\nGentleness is not a privilege\n\nEveryone should be afforded gentleness. It is a right and not a privilege. Even people who we’ve had negative or aggressive encounters with should be afforded a gentleness at times. We all benefit from when we’re cared for gently.\n\nThere is a lot more to unpack around this, but for now I hope you have some new thinking around gentleness and affording people the privilege of being seen as gentle.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers.

The news that another student has died because of gun violence at school is hitting hard, especially during a time of the school year that is often marked with celebrations and graduation. If you can take care of another person, please extend that to the POCs, students of color, and allies. I re-read the blog post I wrote in 2022 after another school shooting in Seattle. We need to do better.\n\nI welcome back my favorite guest blogger Carrie to tell us why many mainstream fundraisers are not disabled friendly or inclusive.\n\nRecently, I was invited by friends to several, let’s say, mainstream, fundraising events– one for a large nonprofit and another for a campaign. (Before you decide this is my thing and you want to invite me to yours, please read on and know that I feel fully satisfied with mainstream events for 2024.) Then I had the honor of being the crone auntie for graduating Harvard students with disabilities by telling them about all the unpaid labor they could expect to do. Apparently, I left out one of those tasks– cripping fundraisers.\n\nNow, when my friend invited me to be part of her diversity efforts for the large nonprofit, I felt like:\n\nThese folks don’t need my money.\n\nI love her, so I will do it, and she will endure whatever postmortem comes her way— especially if my very arrival at the event involved an elevator that has been broken for weeks and a path of travel missing curb cuts.\n\nAttending the event reminded me that fundraising professionals of all kinds are fully missing out on exploiting me for my crip-dough (i.e., disabled lady dollars). While disabled folks are at least 20% of the population, they are absent from most of these rooms. At the large nonprofit, I found some of my people when I took over a tiny table in the corner when others were expected to meander and learn before the plated chicken unveiling. I should have charged for those seats and donated the money to a smaller institution. My people and their family members will find the quiet nooks.\n\nSimilarly, at the campaign event, I was heartened to find friends trying to eat snacks in a corner or hoping to have conversations where they weren’t just nodding along and not hearing anything. I was also grateful to my host for providing the parking options, finding me when I arrived, and saving me a spot to rest.\n\nFor the nonprofit event that hosted 400 or more people, access features were decidedly absent. The room arrangement was poor, so there was no clear line of sight to the speakers. A few monitors were placed in awkward positions around the room, but they weren’t working consistently and there was no captioning. (For a donor base of older folks, who might not identify politically as having disabilities, but need to hear or read your heartwarming appeals for $500,000, this is a misstep.) There was no ASL interpreter. I was the only person with a visible disability– which is a surveying past-time I enjoy when I can’t always hear or see the speaker and have no idea where to direct my body. My other pro bono service was processing with several other attendees– some strangers– how they didn’t realize that one of the gender-inclusive bathrooms was a wall of urinals. Let’s be trauma-informed with our signage. I redirected them to search for the other door that had disability and stall signs, though not all stalls were accessible.\n\nFor a lot of focus on bringing services to communities, there was no mention (or I couldn’t hear it) of disability and youth. If you want me to give and bring along my people, I have to exist in your appeal. At the campaign fundraiser a few days later, I was sucked in by calls for representation, but I was still wondering what that meant about commitment to issues in my community. I tried not to deduct frustration points for having to remove sandwich boards near the only elevator to get to my seat. Something about that event made me feel like I should run for office, which I realized was a sign of too much Kool-Aid for me, so I sought fresh air after those feelings. However, seeking that fresh air meant I had the choice of either charging the stage to reach the elevator when 500 people were walking towards me to take the stairs.\n\nHere are some next steps for fundraising professionals, executive directors, campaign managers, and Board members:\n\nIf you’re a large organization, build in basic accessibility and relevant information about access needs to your event. Don’t wait for someone to ask for inclusive planning – see my previous post about having to be a disability doula, don’t put that burden on disabled people, orgs this is your burden. Communicate what you’re already providing and know that I will spam my people to highlight what you’re signaling to us. Build it and they will come– unless you’re committed to keeping your broken elevator and also asking us for money.\n\nIf you are in a leadership role where you feel as if you are pushing a group for diversity and inclusion, yet you do not identify as having a disability, use your position to advocate that the organization do better and learn together.\n\nProvide as many details about the event so that people can identify their access needs. What is the schedule? What spaces and transitions are part of the event? What’s the format? Where are the closest entrances? Public transit options? Access request contact and turnaround?\n\nInclude us in your work genuinely throughout the year so that we are appearing in your heartfelt pleas, promotional images, and leadership.\n\nPay disabled consultants to assist you with event planning and debriefs.\n\nKnow that accessibility and belonging efforts are always evolving and that you shouldn’t treat missteps as an excuse for avoiding access entirely. The problem isn’t disabled people, buildings, or stages with stairs– it’s that we aren’t having open and proactive conversations that lead to welcoming, affirming experiences for people we note casually in our standard DEI language. You will mess up, but the biggest mistake is the failure to try and then the avoidance of any feedback.\n\nAttend events run by disability-led organizations to understand what those spaces look and feel like. While you’re there, donate some money. Most of our organizations can’t get $500,000 over a lunch; they are excited to raise $20,000 at an event and yet they commit to accessibility as a baseline.\n\nForge authentic relationships with disability organizations that evolve into shared resource-generation spaces and strategies.\n\nI’m waiting to be wooed. Meanwhile, I’ll try to get better at capitalism so I have more to donate to you once you find your way into my heart.\n\nCarrie Basas (she/they) realized after several chicken lunches and dinners of cheese and cookies that her heart is in assisting organizations with building their capacity for disability as belonging. She is now consulting through CoDesignWorks. carrie@codesignworks.com\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers. At this time I don’t offer ‘extras’ or bonuses for Patreons.

To honor and uphold our community I want to remind you not to mess with my AANHPI relations, we’ll fight for visibility and to be included.\n\nAsian Americans are the fastest growing race group in the US; growing 81% between 2000-2018. Native Hawaiians (70%) and Pacific Islanders (61%) (NHPI) are the third fastest growing group. As our numbers grow, we need systems and people to understand the needs and diversity of our race groups. We are not a monolith – the diversity and complexities within the AANHPI group deserved to be understood.\n\n“When do we count?”\n\nAbout a year ago several colleagues and I were talking to a national funder did not name Asians and Pacific Islanders as a target group for a major grant opportunity. It was disappointing, and we requested a meeting to hear out the funder on why AANHPIs were excluded and to make a point that our relations still need resources to overcome racism.\n\nThe funder explained their organization wanted to target funding and resources to those in need and the data they looked at showed that Asians are doing well. We listened politely then asked the question: Are you looking at disaggregated data? They said they did, we pressed more – are you looked at disaggregated data that looks at ethnic groups? Nope.\n\nAsian leaders, especially our elders, in Washington have fought over decades for data visibility. They made great progress. Washington’s education system is a leader in collecting disaggregated racial data. Every public K-12 student in Washington can choose their race and ethnicity. When used properly and when people stop to analyze and use the data, we can see which Asian students are doing well and which ethnic groups are still struggling. The fight isn’t over, while the data is collected we need people, agencies, and systems to USE the disaggregated data and demand that disaggregated data down to ethnic groups is used.\n\nMy colleague who is a national expert on race and student data, said something to the effect of “When do we count?” She rattled off statistics showing the disparities in the Asian race group. Burmese high school graduation rates are 23% and Hmong 39%. Fifteen percent of Bhutanese and 19% of Pacific Islanders have a college degree, a far cry from the 55% for Asians overall. Black Americans with a BA is at 26%, way too low for both groups – we need to work to fix both problems simultaneously. My colleague’s mic drop moment was asking “When do we count?” These statistics are not good, when do Asians count for needing support and resources? We’ll own our Asian privilege, and not all Asians and Pacific Islanders are achieving at the same rate. (These weren’t the exact statistics my colleague shared, but in a similar vein.)\n\nDon’t Oversimplify\n\nTonight, I had a similar conversation about AANHPI’s being left out of a government funding formula. As we talked, I told my colleague as East Asians with a lot of privilege I will own my East Asian privilege, but don’t exclude our SE Asians and our Pacific Islander communities – we’ve fought too hard for visibility – you’ll hear from us. We’ve fought hard for data visibility so people can see we are not a monolithic group. We also need to make sure we’re driving resources to Asians and Pacific Islanders who need it.\n\nWe can do this work in solidarity and inclusively with our POC relations. Oversimplification and doing lazy data and community work doesn’t lead to justice. Do the harder work of seeing Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders for who we are and be inclusive of our communities.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers.

Carrie delivered a graduation address at Harvard at the Disability Affinity Ceremony. She joins a storied league of graduation speakers imparting knowledge and hope to the next generation of ambassadors, doulas, and firestarters.\n\nFor allies, read her remarks and commit to undoing abelism and not asking our friends, colleagues, and relations for unpaid labor. Congrats to the graduates.\n\nI never thought today would happen when I graduated 22 years ago. My time at Harvard shaped me, but maybe not in an inspiring way or one of healing– more like through a deep sense of feeling out of place. The good thing that came from it, however, was appreciating solidarity across communities, finding other misfits, repeatedly asking if we tracked alumni with disabilities, and organizing the parking garage attendants to get very mad and loyal when my access went astray here. Harvard made me realize that I needed a community, especially a disability community and mentors. But to be honest, I gave up on finding it at Harvard. So, for a person who is more snark than woo woo– which will become obvious quickly in our next few minutes together– I have been telling others for weeks that this experience that you all created, even though it’s 22 years late (We Harvard folks aren’t always perfect, either), is healing and wonderful– and I get to claim no credit for it, which is also great.\n\nLet me explain why– today, I’d like to tell you about some unpaid labor you’re about to see increase as your career and personal lives move closer to my crone and curmudgeon status. Don’t worry– it’s going to be fun, well, sometimes, and I can promise you that you’ll have lots of stories. The good part is that everyone in this room who identifies as disabled or Deaf or living with a disability identity of any kind is also now employed in this free labor. You’ll have some choices to make along the way and that’s where my sparkling and snarky personality today can help you. You also might recognize some of these tasks, well, from just living as a person so far with a disability, but they’re about to become even more important, usually when you least expect it.\n\nFirst unpaid labor role: Ambassador\n\nThough we might have a few Kennedy School students here, when I say prepare to be an ambassador, I don’t mean it in an overachieving, on the payroll, negotiate a peace accord, kind of way. I mean you will– and probably already have– been an ambassador for how others view disability.\n\nThe ambassador role isn’t for introverts, but congrats, I am one, and sorry for those who cringe in recognition. The ambassador role is both constant in its hours and surprising in its workload peaks. If you have a visible disability or you’ve shared your disability story, you become more recognizable. Upside: You can just live into having a facial recognition disability because everyone already knows your name or thinks they do.\n\nYou’ll be approached in yogurt aisles (true stories, friends), courtrooms, playgrounds, and sidewalks with someone sharing how you’ve inspired them, maybe hugging you inappropriately, or wanting to share a story about their third cousin who had a disability that was nothing like yours but how he is happy every day. This will probably happen on a day when you are not happy, just warning you.\n\nBut here’s the upside: You will also be approached for the visible choices you make in community, for things you have said and done when you thought absolutely no one was watching, and for reminding people that disabled people belong in public everywhere, doing everything. While it is absolutely exhausting to be representing wherever you go, you should also remember that part of achieving our liberation is asserting our right to just be some days, to even be mediocre, as one of my disabled friends dreams of at times.\n\nThe second unpaid emotional labor role is: Disability Doula\n\nNow, some of these intimate yogurt aisle conversations don’t just end in mistaken identity about which disabled person you are that they met, they are sometimes people really grappling with their own place and identity. While I highly encourage you to get a counseling license and charge hourly rates especially for impromptu sessions, I see these moments where someone is struggling with naming disability for themselves as beautiful opportunities for recruitment. See, one strategy for making this world more accessible and responsive is we’ve just got to raise our numbers, particularly among people with money and access to power.\n\nOne of my dear friends calls these my “foot moments” because while it’s way too early at least for this Pacific Time speaker to give you an inspiring speech about feet, a surprising number of people have shown their feet to me and told me they have disabilities. I have a doctorate in law, which makes me very confident about googling really any issue, but not as comfortable providing direct medical care. A law school friend said it was more like I ran a confessional. I’ve always threatened to print disability membership packets, but so far, I haven’t. Still, it is one of the coolest and most sacred moments when someone shares their disability with you, even if they haven’t figured out all the politics of it.\n\nWe know how much stigma there is about disability, particularly mental health disabilities. The reality, too, is that our disabilities evolve. When I was at Harvard, I only understood that I had physical disabilities, but in my 30s, I realized that maybe one of the reasons that I skipped class so often in law school was that I had ADHD and anxiety. It took me a while to feel like being neurospicy was not yet another thing someone would hold against me.\n\nAs one of my colleagues says, we need disability doulas– not just for the newcomers or the ones we’ve been waiting to realize were always members of our community. (Side note here: I play the long game.) We need them for ourselves as we sort through any internalized ableism. Community is hard to build and doing so will be one of the roles that I won’t get as much into today, but know, too, that some of our worst and best behavior comes from how we treat each other.\n\nThe third unpaid emotional labor role is: Firestarter\n\nAccording to MA fire code, given the age of this building, and some supreme court cases involving shouting words about fire, I want to make clear that I am not asking you to start a fire today. Also, as a disability-proud group, we hold space for our siblings in this movement whose disability might be pyromania– please just mind our dogs, canes, and prescriptions with your matches.\n\nThere will be so many times when the ambassador and doula roles aren’t it, when you are shaking with righteous rage about an injustice, something that has been said, or something you need to say. I struggle with this one a lot. A nondisabled friend with an autistic young adult daughter told me that she just wants her daughter to not be treated as a “commodity” or object that services and providers move around and find inconvenient. I told her that I sometimes feel like I can’t be angry or fierce because I’m vulnerable to how nondisabled people– from my doctors to potential employers– will react. In case you haven’t gotten the memo, yet, one of the many stereotypes about disabled folks is that we’re a risk or litigious, or angry, or unproductive.\n\nDo I feel like I have to make people comfortable often? Yes. Is it exhausting? Yes? Is it always productive toward people changing their behavior? No. Could I also spend every day burning everything down that was wrong or annoying? No. I think my righteous rage would consume me and I’d lose my general orientation toward joy and humor.\n\nWhen you feel a fire rising within you, take a moment and ask yourself some questions:\n\nIs this smoky heap of ableism a good place to roast a marshmallow and make a s’more, instead? If so, grab some friends– preferably cross-movement, cross-disability– and just have a tasty snack. Talk strategy. Who else is impacted? Is this where we need to spend our time right now? Should I take this on so someone else doesn’t have to who has less privilege and energy than me right now?\n\nDo I have positional power to make a difference here? Don’t give yourself an easy out, either. You went to Harvard. You might not be the person in charge and you might feel vulnerable, but you could have less at stake than someone else who is just trying to survive a system.\n\nAnd finally: a question that my husband (not disabled, but a man of color) has always asked me: Would you be fired (insert whatever verb here makes sense for your situation?) for the right reasons? By “right”—right to me.\n\nFind mentors and friends who will support you when your heart is telling you it’s time to forget the s’mores and light a match. Or to quote one of my former colleagues: “I’m feeling the need to negotiate like a terrorist.” So, now I ask my cat if he is feeling the need to negotiate like a terrorist. That phrase brought me joy. I’ll hold her s’more while she does that.\n\nFinally, I have paid labor to offer you: Now that you’ve made my Harvard dreams come true of gathering students with disabilities, I need you to be in charge of many things. I don’t care if it’s practicing tax law, becoming a plastic surgeon, building a family, or becoming an art history professor. I want our people everywhere making decisions because we’re creative problem-solvers who understand that access and belonging go beyond steepness of ramps and captioning. I want us to lead within disability rights and justice, too, because the reality is that so much of this work continues to be led by nondisabled people– which I hope will become unacceptable in my lifetime. I believe that systems change when the people making the decisions change, and so I’d ask you to take your ambassador skills, doula or foot analysis techniques, and matches wherever brings you joy.\n\nCreate spaces where you feel loved and seen. Realize that not all the work is yours or ours to do, and that we, too, have a responsibility to work in solidarity with other movements and dream for collective liberation. Our main duty is to live such that we honor our bodies, minds, disability and Deaf culture, and not wait for permission. Thank you.\n\nThank you to our Patreon subscribers.
