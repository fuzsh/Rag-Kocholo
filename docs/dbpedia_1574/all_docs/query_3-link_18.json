        "text": "Numerous scholarly works extol the use of LGBTQ themed literature as part of English language arts instruction with the implication that its use may improve the school climate for LGBTQ students; however, there is a dearth of research that empirically examines whether or not this type of instruction measurably impacts adolescents' homophobia. To address this paucity, this study examined the ability of a dialogically organized, reader response–based instructional unit of the young adult novel Geography Club to reduce adolescents' homophobia. A quasi-experimental design was used with eighth grade students in seven English language arts classes. Homophobia was measured using a researcher-created scale. Analysis of pretests revealed that girls had lower levels of homophobia than boys and that Black students had higher levels of homophobia than Hispanic students. Posttest results indicated that the intervention was successful in lowering homophobia. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a three factor solution: Interpersonal Homophobia, Attitudes toward Homophobia, and Sexuality as a Choice. Post-hoc tests revealed differing effect sizes for the aforementioned factors and showed that there was no backlash to treatment in participants with high pretest homophobia. This paper argues that schools and teacher education programs should make a serious effort to incorporate LGBTQ themed texts into curricula as part of a concerted effort to reduce the culture of homophobic violence that has become institutionalized in many schools.\n\nAlthough trends in young adult literature (YAL) indicate that authors are constructing more positive renditions of gay characters, curricular and pedagogical choices seem to remain quite unsympathetic and “conservative,” reproducing harmful stereotypes. This paper contends that the kiss in YAL can symbolize the physical, social, and moral manifestation of same-sex desire, and thus functions as a personal, social, and moral marker of one’s relation to oneself and to others. To aid our discussion, we employ Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition. Integrating Honneth’s theory of recognition with lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) young adult novels offers researchers the potential to conduct literary analysis that offers readers, teachers, and students new or alternative “readings” of LGBTQ individuals as well as the social constraints that obstruct social recognition for everyone within a given space. This paper provides a brief literature review of LGBTQ YAL in education and then explicates Honneth’s theory of recognition, followed by an application of Honneth’s theory to David Leviathan’s novel, Two Boys Kissing.\n\nABSTRACT This paper examines representations of rural lesbian lives in three young adult novels. The novels analysed are Beauty of the broken by Tawni Waters (2014), Julie Anne Peters (2005) Pretend you love me, and Forgive me if you’ve heard this one before by Karelia Stetz- Waters (2014). The first of the novels by Waters (2014. Beauty of the broken. New York, NY: Simon Pulse) presents a very negative portrait of rural life for queer youth. Its message is that the only positive queer life is one that is lived in the urban. In contrast, the texts by Peters (2005. Pretend you love me. New York, NY: Little Brown) and Stetz-Waters (2014. Forgive me if you’ve heard this one before. Portland, OR: Ooligan Press) present rural spaces as potentially both inclusive and exclusive for queer youth. These novels also demonstrate that urban spaces can be equally problematic for queer youth. While we do not discount that Waters (2014. Beauty of the broken. New York, NY: Simon Pulse) description of rural life may be the experience of some queer youth, we argue that the novels by Peters (2005. Pretend you love me. New York, NY: Little Brown) and Stetz-Waters (2014. Forgive me if you’ve heard this one before. Portland, OR: Ooligan Press) offer a more nuanced and complicated notion of place and its relationship to non-normative sexual subjectivities.\n\nThe dimension of Indian young adult literature is far away from the mainstream literature. Nevertheless, there have been few known contributions of writers of post Raj like R. K. Narayan, Ruskin Bond and Mulk Raj Anand but it is not certain that their target readers are exclusively meant for adolescent readership. In fact, their readership is not directed by anybody in the Indian scenario. Since last decades there have been a tremendous change in the arena of young adult literature and that is the depiction of queer characters in the Indian English fiction. Here the word 'queer' has been used as an umbrella term for the LGBT community. Two novels \"Slightly Burnt\"(2014) by Payal Dhar and \"Talking of Muskaan\" (2014) by Himanjali Sankar have been selected for analysing queer spaces as exemplary of contemporary young adult Indian English fiction. Extending through the methodology of queer theory this article interrogates the narrative voices that claim heterogeneity as normal against homosexuality. Moreover, an attempt has been made to study and bring out the element of ambivalence delineated in the authorial voice, queer representations and the adolescent perspective.\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and queer (LGBTQ) young adult (YA) literature is increasing in popularity, with novels like Bil Wright’s Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy winning the two LGBTQ YA honors—the Lambda Literary and Stonewall Book Awards—as well awards commending their cultural diversity. Despite the upsurge of celebrated LGBTQ YA literature, a study of the protagonists in Lambda- and Stonewall-winning YA novels from 2000–2013 reveals three findings: the dominance of White, gay, male characters contradicts the trend toward strong female protagonists in mainstream YA; stories about lesbians are primarily tragic; and there are no bisexual protagonists.\n\nThis article proposes a genealogical meditation on the changing meanings and \" eventfulness \" of Montreal's postwar LGBTQ bars read through a multimedia archive. Bars are understood here as material and discursive chronotopes or articulations of space-time (Bakhtin) frequently understood as metonymic to LGBTQ experience and historical struggle. I analyze an archive (social histories, photographs and drawings, journalism, fiction, and memoirs) associated with two \" events \" from 1974: a raid on the lesbian bar Madame Arthur, and the release of a feature film Il était une fois dans l'est based on Michel Tremblay's oeuvre. I set in dialogue a genealogical historiography with a \" cartographic \" tendency in foundational Montreal lesbian and gay histories, where the historical significance of LGBTQ bars is collapsed into struggles for public space; these spatial struggles are embedded in a progressive discourse of liberation that articulates problematically with sexual and national liberation. With a particular attention to gender differences, I read the archive for conflictual lesbian, gay, and transsexual traces of historical experience and subjectivity. Highlighting methodological approaches to a multimedia LGBTQ archive, I explore how different media and genres of discourse contribute to dissonant accounts of Montréal LGBTQ bars of the 1970s. Cet article propose une réflexion généalogique d'une archive multimédia, explorant des significations et des dimensions événementielles changeantes des bars montréalais LGBTQ. Conçus comme chronotopes ou articulations d'espace-temps (Bakhtin), les bars sont souvent compris comme des métonymies de l'expérience LGBTQ et des luttes historiques. J'analyse une archive incorporant des traces d'évidence (histoires sociales, photographies et dessins, reportages, extraits des fictions et des mémoires) associées à des événements discursifs et matériels: la descente policière sur le bar lesbien Madame Arthur et le long métrage Il était une fois dans l'est adaptant l'oeuvre de Michel Tremblay. Je mets en dialogue l'enquête généalogique avec une tendance \" cartographique \" dans des histoires sociales LGBTQ de Montréal, où la résonance historique des bars est"
