        "text": "The Door of No Return\n\nby Kwame Alexander\n\non September 27, 2022\n\nGenres: Middle Grade, Historical, Poetry\n\nPages: 432\n\nFormat: eARC\n\nSource: Publisher\n\nDreams are today’s answers for tomorrow’s questions.\n\n11-year-old Kofi Offin dreams of water. Its mysterious, immersive quality. The rich, earthy scent of the current. The clearness, its urgent whisper that beckons with promises and secrets…\n\nKofi has heard the call on the banks of Upper Kwanta, in the village where he lives. He loves these things above all else: his family, the fireside tales of his father’s father, a girl named Ama, and, of course, swimming. Some say he moves like a minnow, not just an ordinary boy so he’s hoping to finally prove himself in front of Ama and his friends in a swimming contest against his older, stronger cousin.\n\nBut before this can take place, a festival comes to the villages of Upper and Lower Kwanta and Kofi’s brother is chosen to represent Upper Kwanta in the wrestling contest. Encircled by cheering spectators and sounding drums, the two wrestlers from different villages kneel, ready to fight.\n\nYou are only fine, until you are not.\n\nThe match is over before it has barely begun, when the unthinkable–a sudden death–occurs…\n\nThe river does not care how grown you are.\n\nAs his world turns upside down, Kofi soon ends up in a fight for his life. What happens next will send him on a harrowing journey across land and sea, and away from everything he loves.\n\nRating:\n\nContent Tags:\n\nPerfect for readers who want:\n\nNovels in verse (particularly reluctant/struggling readers)\n\nHistorical fiction set in other countries\n\nAfrican culture, beliefs, and Twi language\n\nDiverse stories about colonization\n\nBeautiful writing with poignant lines\n\nRelatable characters just struggling to survive\n\nMany thanks to Little, Brown Books for Young Readers and TBR & Beyond Tours for an eARC in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.\n\nI have heard endless good things about Kwame Alexander’s work, though I’d never read any of it before. I confess that I tend to associate his name with middle grade sports books, which is a genre I’ve never been able to get into. So when I saw that he had a new historical book in verse coming out, given how popular of an author he is, I knew I had to give it a try!\n\nThe Door of No Return is a beautiful, heart-wrenching examination of African culture, colonization, growing up, and all the things that bind us and tear us apart.\n\nWhile the plot is a little meandering and more slice of life than I wanted it to be, there’s no doubt that Alexander is a gifted writer that can strike at the heart of his readers. There were moments I was bored with what was happening, sure, but I was always invested in the characters, in their life and dreams, and there were plenty of scenes that broke my heart or made me rage at the injustice. Especially keeping in mind that Kofi Offin is only 11 years old! This is a great book for young readers to gain a totally different perspective of a different culture and the ways colonization impacted societies.\n\nDespite living in historical Africa, under very unfamiliar conditions, there are a lot of things readers will recognize and relate to in Kofi Offin’s story.\n\nHe goes to school, for one, even though he doesn’t always like it (though he sometimes does). Often, he learns about things he couldn’t care less about, and he doesn’t always understand why he has to learn about these things. Sound familiar?\n\nOffin also struggles with bullying from his older cousin, has a crush on a girl he’s grown up with, and likes to go mess around and get in trouble with his friends. His parents sometimes frustrate him, especially when they keep secrets, and he doesn’t always understand what his grandfather means when he tries giving advice. He looks up to his older brother and sometimes squabbles with his siblings. In other words, he’s an 11-year-old.\n\nAlexander does a magnificent job of representing the culture, beliefs, and situations that make Kofi Offin unique while, at the same time, highlighting all the ways we’re all similar, too.\n\nAFTER MORNING ASSEMBLY\n\nwe march inside\n\nto begin another foreign history lesson\n\non the Queen’s coronation\n\nin 1838\n\nat some place\n\ncalled Westminster Abbey\n\nand all I can wonder is\n\nwhy we do not spend\n\nas much time\n\nlearning the history\n\nof our own kingdom.\n\nThe real crux of this story doesn’t actually begin until about halfway through, which can make the beginning feel a bit like a drag. When things go wrong, though, they really go wrong.\n\nBit of a snowball effect, really. If you find the beginning a bit slow and meandering, like I did, with too many slice-of-life scenes and not enough actually happening . . . wait for it! The last half of the book is jammed with action. Basically, it doesn’t take any time at all for life to derail, right? In the blink of an eye.\n\nWhat makes the book perhaps the most eye-opening is that all these things are happening to an 11-year-old, which probably means less to middle grade readers (who will be the same age) than it does to me, the parent of an 11-year-old.\n\nThere are bits of the story that felt incomplete or unfinished, but part of the point is that Offin himself gets no real closure, so how could the reader? The ending is a bit open, too, and leaves the reader to draw their own conclusions about what will become of him, which may be frustrating for some readers, but I think it works well for this age category. Middle grade is characterized by happy endings, but that would be completely unrealistic for a book such as this and would ruin the story. So while the ending isn’t actually happy, it’s hopeful, which I think is the perfect tone to set considering the content.\n\nKWASI SAYS\n\nhe is not scared\n\nbecause the giant\n\nhas two feet\n\nlike we do,\n\nwraps a cloth\n\naround his waist\n\neach day\n\nthe same as us,\n\nand eats just like\n\neveryone else.\n\nYes, but the difference is, his cloth is mammoth\n\nand he eats PEOPLE like they are stalks of corn,\n\nI say. Be careful, brother.\n\nThe Door of No Return is a novel in verse, written in a way that’s accessible even to struggling readers, but with lines that are so poignant they’ll steal your breath away.\n\nMake no mistake: Alexander can write. Man, his writing is gorgeous! There are things that sometimes frustrate me about books in verse, but in this case, the format really highlights the beauty of Alexander’s words. Which, of course, are also juxtaposed to the occasional darkness of the story itself.\n\nI especially appreciated the way Alexander combines Twi with English, especially in the way that English is the “other” that Offin and his peers are forced to learn. It really sets a different expectation and gives the readers a new perspective. Offin talks about how weird the foreign words feel in his mouth, which I imagine many readers will feel about the Twi, and it’s a really interesting sort of realization that forces empathy in a way I think many readers won’t have thought about before.\n\nDespite the sometimes heavy content of the story, Alexander’s writing itself is an absolute delight to read, and I can see why he’s such a popular author!\n\nThere was even a time when the setting of our sun brought shadows from other places…near and far…white shadows who ignored our peace…who arrested our dreams…who clamored for our gold…And they did not stop until they got what they came for…Until every speck of gold lined their pockets…The Offin River was cursed…from source to mouth…Many beautiful ones disappeared…they were taken under the black sky and unborn…If you listen closely, you can still hear their wails beneath the water\n\nThe Door of No Return isn’t necessarily for the faint of heart, as it handles some very heavy topics, including character death, abuse, torture, implied rape (offscreen, not named), murder, slavery, and implied suicide (offscreen, not named). But it’s a story that needs to be told.\n\nThere’s an incredibly poignant line in this story where Offin is asking his parents questions, as so many kids do, about why their life is the way it is, like why the river is dangerous at night. Why they have all these precautions. And like parents do, his father doesn’t want to answer, because he’s still young, and he wants to spare his son the realities of the world. Then Offin utters a line that is gut-wrenching, especially as a parent myself: “You cannot protect me forever.” Because that’s what we all want to do for our kids, right? Preserve their innocence and protect them for as long as physically possible.\n\nI have no doubt that this book will end up on banned books lists, especially in this current climate. I have no doubt that some parents will not want their children to read this book, because it has a lot of hard truths. But like Offin’s parents realize, covering up truths does nothing to change the fact that they exist. While some of the content of this book is heavy, I don’t think it’s above the comprehension of a middle grader, nor do I think they need to be protected from it. I say this as the parent to a naïve 11-year-old that I would gladly hand this book to.\n\nNot only does Alexander shed light on a culture that is often underrepresented and overlooked, but on topics that are incredibly important.\n\nAbout Kwame Alexander\n\nKwame Alexander is a poet, educator, publisher, and New York Times Bestselling author of 36 books, including SWING, BECOMING MUHAMMAD ALI, co-authored with James Patterson, REBOUND, which was shortlisted for prestigious UK Carnegie Medal, The Caldecott Medal and Newbery Honor-winning picture book, THE UNDEFEATED, illustrated by Kadir Nelson, and his NEWBERY medal-winning middle grade novel, THE CROSSOVER.
