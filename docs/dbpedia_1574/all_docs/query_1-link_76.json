These 4 will be joining the 19 individuals that the judges have already chosen for the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 16 nominees are Gus Arriola, Eddie Campbell, Mike Friedrich, Don Heck, Klaus Janson, Abe Kanegson, Jim Lee, Mike Mignola, Tom Palmer, Bob Powell, Mike Royer, Ira Schnapp, Phil Seuling. Leonard Starr, Jill Thompson, and Angelo Torres.\n\nVoting for the Hall of Fame was held online. The deadline for voting was May 3.\n\nThe 2024 Eisner Awards Hall of Fame judging panel consists of Dr. William Foster, Michael T. Gilbert, Karen Green, Alonso Nuñez, Jim Thompson, and Maggie Thompson. The Eisner Hall of Fame trophies will be presented in a special program during Comic-Con on the morning of July 26. A change instituted in 2023, the Hall of Fame winners will have their own special spotlight in the daytime, giving more fans the opportunity to attend.\n\nEisner Hall of Fame Nominees 2024\n\nGus Arriola (1917–2008)\n\nGus Arriola wrote and drew the Mexican-themed comic strip Gordo. The strip, which prominently featured Mexican characters and themes, set a high standard with its impeccable art and design and had a long and successful life in newspapers (1941–1985). R.C. Harvey wrote in Children of the Yellow Kid: “A pioneer in producing ‘ethnic’ comics, Arriola drew upon his own Mexican heritage in creating a strip about a portly south-of-the-border bean farmer. . . . When the strip started, it was rendered in the big-foot style of MGM animated cartoons, upon which Arriola had been working until then. But over the years, Arriola dramatically changed his way of drawing, producing eventually the decorative masterpiece of the comics page, the envy of his colleagues. He frequently made the strip educational, informing his readers about the culture of Mexico.”\n\nEddie Campbell (1955– )\n\nEddie Campbell is a Scottish comics artist and writer now living in Chicago. He is best known for his award-winning graphic novel with Alan Moore From Hell, which was made into a movie in 2001. Campbell is also the creator of the semi-autobiographical Alec stories collected in Alec: The Years Have Pants, and Bacchus, a wry adventure series about some of the Greek gods surviving to the present day. The Fate of the Artist, in which the author investigates his own murder, and The Lovely Horrible Stuff, an investigation of our relationship with money, are also among his graphic novels. He received an Inkpot Award in1998.\n\nMike Friedrich (1949– )\n\nMike Friedrich began his writing career as a teenager, writing letters of comment to comics publishers. By the age of 18, he was writing professionally at first for DC with scripts for Batman, The Flash, The Spectre, Challengers of the Unknown, Green Lantern, Teen Titans, House of Mystery, The Phantom Stranger, and many others, including an extended run as writer of Justice League of America. In 1972 he moved to Marvel, where he served as writer of Iron Man, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel, Warlock, Ka-Zar, and many more. He then shifted to the business side of comics. He was one of the first alternative press publishers (Star*Reach, 1974–1979), created the Marvel Comics Direct Sales department (1980–1982), and then founded the first business management company for comics artists and writers (Star*Reach, 1982–2002). Along the way, he also co-founded WonderCon, ran retailer trade shows, and became a union representative for research scientists and research technicians at the University of California Berkeley.\n\nDon Heck (1929–1995)\n\nDon Heck’s professional career began in 1949, when he got a job in the production department of Harvey Comics. In 1954, Heck joined Charlton Comics, where he did Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion. He eventually became a mainstay at Atlas/Marvel, where he started out illustrating “Torpedo Taylor” in Navy Combat and “Cliff Mason” in Jungle Tales and Jann of the Jungle. He worked on Journey into Mystery and Tales of Suspense. His first superhero assignment was on the first Iron Man story, which appeared in Tales of Suspense in 1963. Heck also worked on early stories of Thor and Giant Man but is probably best remembered for his long run on The Avengers, starting in 1964. During his time at Marvel, he also contributed to the art on Spider-Man, X-Men, and more. In 1971, Jack Kirby suggested him to DC as an artist for Batgirl. Heck drew this strip for several years along with work on such other DC titles as Justice League of America, Steel, The Indestructible Man, Wonder Woman, and The Flash.\n\nKlaus Janson (1952– )\n\nThe penciler, inker, colorist, and educator is known for work for Marvel and DC on such comics as Daredevil, Dark Knight Returns, and Defenders. Janson made his professional debut for Marvel in 1973, inking Rich Buckler’s pencils for the “The Black Panther” in Jungle Action. He inked such diverse Marvel titles as Defenders, Deathlok, Battlestar Galactica, and Howard the Duck, although his main series was Daredevil. He inked for Gene Colan, Gil Kane, Carmine Infantino, and Frank Miller. Later, Janson focused on penciling and inking, rather than inking alone. With Miller, Janson worked on the The Dark Knight Returns miniseries. He also worked on The Punisher and Spawn. He received an Inkpot Award in 2012.\n\nAbe Kanegson (1921–1965)\n\nAbe Kanegson was the letterer on Will Eisner’s Spirit newspaper strip from 1947 to 1950. Eisner used lettering to set tone or establish mood, and Kanegson’s range allowed him to use types of lettering not often seen in comics, like blackletter, to great effect. His innovations were highly influential on many comics letterers.\n\nJim Lee (1964– )\n\nDC’s president, publisher, and chief creative officer entered the industry in 1987 as an artist for Marvel, drawing such titles as Alpha Flight and The Punisher War Journal and gaining popularity on The Uncanny X-Men—on which, working with Chris Claremont, he co-created the character Gambit. That led to a 1991 Lee-Claremont spinoff—X-Men—with its first issue remaining the bestselling comic book of all time, according to Guinness. In 1992, Lee joined other creators to found Image, for which his WildStorm studio provided releases including WildC.A.T.s and Gen¹³. In 1998, Lee took WildStorm to DC, where he drew comics including Batman and Superman. In 2005, he co-created All Star Batman & Robin, the Boy Wonder with Frank Miller. In 2010, Lee and Dan DiDio became DC co-publishers; in 2020, Lee became the sole DC publisher. He was one of the driving forces behind the 2011 DC relaunch and made new costume designs for relaunched series and drew Justice League. In 2018, he became DC Chief Creative Officer. He received an Inkpot Award in 1992.\n\nMike Mignola (1960– )\n\nIn 1983, Mignola was a Marvel inker on Daredevil and Power Man and Iron Fist, later becoming the penciler on such titles as The Incredible Hulk, Alpha Flight, and the Rocket Raccoon limited series. In 1987, he began working for DC, too, and drew World of Krypton and The Phantom Stranger limited series. With writer Jim Starlin, Mignola produced the 1988 Cosmic Odyssey miniseries. Writer Brian Augustyn and Mignola produced the Gotham by Gaslight one-shot in 1989. Mignola is best known for creating Hellboy for Dark Horse Comics in 1994, kicking off a shared universe of titles including B.P.R.D., Abe Sapien, and Lobster Johnson. His other paranormal-themed titles for Dark Horse include Baltimore, Joe Golem, and The Amazing Screw-On Head. He received an Inkpot Award in 2004.\n\nTom Palmer (1941–2022)\n\nPalmer’s comics career goes back to the late 1960s. He began his association with Marvel in 1967 and is most recognized for his inking on pencils by Neal Adams (The Avengers, Uncanny X-Men), Gene Colan (Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Tomb of Dracula), John Buscema (The Avengers), and John Byrne (X-Men: The Hidden Years). Palmer penciled “Jungle Jim” stories for Charlton through Wally Wood’s studio in 1969. He also penciled for Skywald’s Nightmare and DC’s House of Secrets (1970s) and Steel (1990s) and provided cover art for Marvel’s Star Trek and Star Wars titles. His inking style influenced later generations of inkers including Klaus Janson, Josef Rubinstein, and Bob McLeod. He received an Inkpot Award in 2010.\n\nBob Powell (1916–1967)\n\nPowell went to work for the Eisner-Iger studio in the late 1930s. He worked for many publishers through this studio, including Fiction House (Jumbo Comics), Fox (Wonderworld Comics, Mystery Men Comics), Harvey (Speed Comics), Timely, and Quality (Crack Comics, Hit Comics, Military Comics, Smash Comics, Feature Comics). His most famous series during his Eisner-Iger years was “Sheena,” which appeared in Jumbo Comics. Later, Powell went to work in Will Eisner’s personal studio and co-plotted the first Blackhawk story in Quality’s Military Comics. When the Spirit newspaper comic book section started in 1940, Powell took on the artwork of the “Mr. Mystic” backup feature, which was written by Eisner. After a while, Powell took on the writing as well, and he continued “Mr. Mystic” until he joined the Air Force in 1943. After the war, Powell started working for himself, drawing for such publishers as Street & Smith (Shadow Comics), Magazine Enterprises (Strong Man), Harvey Comics (Man in Black, Adventures in 3-D) and Marvel (Daredevil, Giant-Man, Hulk, and Human Torch). Powell also did the pencil art for the famous Mars Attacks bubble gum trading card series. In 1961 he became art director for Sick magazine, a position which he held until his death in 1967.\n\nMike Royer (1941– )\n\nRoyer has worked as penciler, inker, and letterer, notably over Jack Kirby in 1970s. He assisted Russ Manning on his work for Western/Gold Key’s Magnus, Robot Fighter and Tarzan comic books. Royer later also worked with Manning on the Tarzan newspaper strip and on Star Wars in the late 1970s. He continued to work for Western as an inker of Disney stories by such artists as Tony Strobl, Sparky Moore, and Mike Arens and as artist on such titles as Tarzan, Korak, Son of Tarzan, and Space Ghost, as well as coloring books and puzzles. He adapted and drew Speed Buggy and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, while designing covers and inking stories for Hanna-Barbera’s TV Adventure Heroes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he inked the work of Don Heck, Steve Ditko, and Ramona Fradon for such companies as Marvel and DC and inked most of Jack Kirby’s comics during this period. He also contributed to such alternative publications as Arc and to Warren’s Creepy and Eerie. He also freelanced for such magazines as National Lampoon and Cracked. He received an Inkpot Award in 1978.\n\nIra Schnapp (1894–1969)\n\nSchnapp was a logo designer and letterer who brought his classic and art deco design styles to DC Comics (then National Comics) beginning with the redesign of the Superman logo in 1940. He did a great deal of logo and lettering work for the company in the 1940s. Around 1949, he joined the staff as their in-house logo, cover lettering, and house-ad designer and letterer, and continued in that role until about 1967. He also designed the Comics Code seal.\n\nPhil Seuling (1934–1984)\n\nPhil Seuling was a comic book retailer, fan convention organizer, and comics distributor primarily active in the 1970s. He was the organizer of the annual New York Comic Art Convention, originally held in New York City every July 4 weekend beginning in 1968. Later, with his Sea Gate Distributors company, Seuling developed the concept of the direct market distribution system for getting comics directly into comic book specialty shops, bypassing the then-established newspaper/magazine distributor method, where no choices of title, quantity, or delivery directions were permitted. He was among the first group of recipients for the Inkpot Award at the 1974 San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nLeonard Starr (1925–2015)\n\nStarr did his first comic book art through the Chesler shop and Funnies Inc. In 1942, he drew Sub-Mariner and Human Torch stories for Timely and Don Winslow stories for Fawcett. He also worked for a variety of other publishers, including Better Publications, Consolidated Book, Croyden Publications, E. R. Ross Publishing, Hillman Periodicals, and Crestwood. His first work for newspapers was ghosting the Flash Gordon strip for King Features in the mid-1950s. His On Stage newspaper strip began via the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate in 1957; he drew it until 1979, when he was hired by the same syndicate to revive the Little Orphan Annie strip, which he wrote and drew until his retirement in 2000. He received an Inkpot Award in 1982.\n\nJill Thompson (1966­– )\n\nThe writer/artist creator of Scary Godmother (1987) became more widely known in 1991 after taking over DC’s Wonder Woman. She subsequently worked on many titles for DC/Vertigo, including contributing to Neil Gaiman’s Sandman. Her work has included The Invisibles, Black Orchid, and Seekers into the Mystery, and she has worked on several Sandman-related projects including At Death’s Door, The Little Endless Storybook, and The Dead Boys Detectives. She is co-creator with Evan Dorkin of the award-winning Dark Horse paranormal animal series Beasts of Burden. She received an Inkpot Award in 2015.\n\nAngelo Torres (1932– )\n\nTorres began his career in the early 1950s, assisting his studio mate Al Williamson on such E.C. titles as Valor together with Frank Frazetta and Roy Krenkel (the team known as the Fleagle Gang). He contributed to Atlas mystery and Western titles in the late 1950s. For Gilberton, he contributed to Classics Illustrated; for Feature Comics, he appeared in Sick during the 1960s. He contributed to Warren titles Eerie, Creepy, and Blazing Combat between 1964 and 1967. Torres was one of MAD’s mainstays, providing caricatures and movie parodies for almost 25 years. He has also worked as an illustrator for such magazines as Esquire. In 1989, he drew Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure Movie Adaptation for DC. He received an Inkpot Award in 2000.\n\nJudges Choose 19 for 2024 Eisner Hall of Fame\n\nSan Diego Comic Convention (Comic-Con) has announced that the Eisner Awards judges have selected 19 individuals to automatically be inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Awards Hall of Fame for 2024. These inductees include 12 deceased comics pioneers and 7 living creators. The deceased greats are Creig Flessel, A. B. Frost, Billy Graham, Albert Kanter, Warren Kremer, Oscar Lebeck, Frans Masereel, Keiji Nakaszawa, Noel Sickles, Cliff Sterrett, Elmer C. Stoner, and George Tuska. The judges’ living choices are Kim Deitch, Gary Groth, Don McGregor, Bryan Talbot, Ron Turner, Lynn Varley, and James Warren. In April, nominees will be announced for online voting to add four more inductees into the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 2024 Hall of Fame judging panel consists of Dr. William Foster, Michael T. Gilbert, Karen Green, Alonso Nuñez, Jim Thompson, and Maggie Thompson.\n\nThe Hall of Fame trophies will be presented in a special program during Comic-Con on the morning of July 26. The Eisner Awards in 30+ other categories will be presented in a ceremony that evening.\n\n2024 Eisner Awards Hall of Fame Judges’ Choices\n\nKim Deitch (1944- )\n\nPioneer underground cartoonist Kim Deitch’s best-known character is Waldo the Cat, a fictional 1930s-era animated cat who stars in the seminal Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Shroud of Waldo, Alias the Cat, and various other strips and books. Kim’s other works include Shadowlands, Reincarnation Stories, Beyond the Pale, and Deitch’s Pictorama, a collaboration with brothers Simon and Seth. Art Spiegelman has called Deitch “the best kept secret in American comics.” Deitch was co-founder of the Cartoonists Co-op Press (1973–1974) and has taught at the School for Visual Arts in New York. He received Comic-Con’s Inkpot Award in 2008.\n\nCreig Flessel (1912–2008)\n\nCreig Flessel drew the covers of many of the first American comic books, including the pre-Batman Detective Comics #2–#17 (1937–1938). As a writer/artist, Flessel created the DC character the Shining Knight, in Adventure Comics #66 (Sept. 1941). He drew many early adventures of the Golden Age Sandman and has sometimes been credited as the character’s co-creator. When editor Vin Sullivan left DC Comics and formed his own comic book publishing company, Magazine Enterprises, Flessel signed on as associate editor. He continued to draw comics, often uncredited, through the 1950s, including Superboy stories in both that character’s namesake title and in Adventure Comics, and anthological mystery and suspense tales in American Comics Group’s (AGC’s) Adventures into the Unknown.\n\nA. B. Frost (1851–1928)\n\nThe work of illustrator/cartoonist Arthur Frost was published in three albums: Stuff and Nonsense (1884), The Bull Calf and Other Tales (1892), and Carlo (1913). Because of his skills in depicting motion and sequence, Frost was a great influence on such early American newspaper comics artists as Richard Outcault, Rudolph Dirks, Jimmy Swinnerton, and Fred Opper. His work appeared in magazines such as Harper’s Weekly and Punch.\n\nBilly Graham (1935–1997)\n\nBilly Graham was an African American comic book artist whose earliest work appeared in Warren’s Vampirella magazine in 1969. He eventually became art director at Warren, then in 1972 he moved over to Marvel, where he helped create Luke Cage, Hero for Hire with John Romita Sr. and George Tuska. From 1973 to 1976, he worked with writer Don McGregor on “Black Panther” in Jungle Action. During the 1980s, he worked with McGregor on the Sabre title at Eclipse Comics.\n\nGary Groth (1954– )\n\nGary Groth co-founded Fantagraphics Books in 1976 with the publication of The Comics Journal, and he was the driving force behind the magazine’s advocacy of comics as an artform. TCJ became known, loved, and hated for its advocacy journalism, high-falutin’ criticism, and long-form interviews by Groth with a vast array of artists from Jack Kirby to R. Crumb to Roz Chast. At a time when comics were an object of scorn in mainstream culture, Fantagraphics was preserving and contextualizing the work of historically and aesthetically significant classic cartoonists—republishing George Herriman’s Krazy Kat, Charles Schulz’s Peanuts, Walt Kelly’s Pogo, and Carl Barks’ Disney Duck stories—as well as publishing the early work of “literary” cartoonists as diverse as the Hernandez Brothers, Daniel Clowes, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Jim Woodring, Carol Lay, and Joe Sacco. Groth continues to publish a new generation of auteurist cartoonists.\n\nAlbert Kanter (1897–1973)\n\nAlbert Lewis Kanter began producing Classic Comics for Elliot Publishing Company (later the Gilberton Company) with The Three Musketeers in October 1941. Classic Comics became Classics Illustrated in 1947. Kanter believed he could use the burgeoning medium to introduce young and reluctant readers to “great literature.” In addition to Classics Illustrated, Kanter presided over its spin-offs Classics Illustrated Junior, Specials, and The World Around Us. Between 1941 and 1962, sales totaled 200 million.\n\nWarren Kremer (1921–2003)\n\nWarren Kremer studied at New York’s School of Industrial Arts and went straight into print services, working for pulp magazines. He gradually took on more comics work in Ace Publications, his first title being Hap Hazard. In 1948 Kremer began working for Harvey Comics, where he stayed for 35 years, creating such popular characters as Casper and Richie Rich and working on titles including Little Max, Joe Palooka, Stumbo the Giant, Hot Stuff, and Little Audrey. In the 1980s, Kremer worked for Star Comics, Marvel’s kids imprint, and contributed to titles like Top Dog, Ewoks, Royal Roy, Planet Terry, and Count Duckula\n\nOskar Lebeck (1903–1966)\n\nOskar Lebeck was a stage designer and an illustrator, writer, and editor (mostly of children’s literature) who is best known for his role in establishing Dell Comics during the 1930s and 1940s. Notably, he hired Walt Kelly, who became one of the star creators of the line, best known for originating Pogo while there. Lebeck also selected John Stanley to bring panel cartoon character Little Lulu to comic books. Comic book historian Michael Barrier commented that Dell’s fairy tale, nursery rhyme, and similarly themed titles “represented an effort by Lebeck, who had written and drawn children’s books in the 1930s, to bring to comic books some of the qualities of traditional children’s books, especially through rich and rather old-fashioned illustrations.”\n\nFrans Masereel (1889–1972)\n\nFrans Masereel is one of the most famous Flemish woodcut artists of his time. Like Lynd Ward, Masereel wrote “novels without words” and can be seen as a precursor to current graphic novelists. His first “graphic novel” was De Stad (1925), in which he described life in the city in 100 engravings. Other books are Geschichte Ohne Worte and De Idee, about an idea that’s being haunted by the police and justice. It became very popular among anti-Nazis. Masereel settled in France after World War II and died in 1972.\n\nDon McGregor (1945– )\n\nDon McGregor began his comics writing career in 1969, writing horror stories for James Warren’s Creepy, Eerie, and Vampirella. After working as an editor on several of Marvel Comics’ B&W line of comics/magazines, in 1973 he was assigned to write the Black Panther in Marvel’s Jungle Action comics. The “Panther’s Rage” series was the first mainstream comic to have an essentially all-black cast of comics. Don also wrote Killraven, Luke Cage, Powerman, and Morbius, The Living Vampire in that time period. In the middle of the 1970s he created the historically important graphic novel Sabre, with art by Billy Graham. During the early 1980s, Don’s works included Detectives Inc. titles for Eclipse, and he worked with Gene Colan on Ragamuffins (Eclipse) Nathaniel Dusk (DC), and Panther’s Quest (Marvel). His 1990s writing included Zorro and Lady Rawhide forTopps.\n\nKeiji Nakazawa (1939–2012)\n\nKeiji Nakazawa was born in Hiroshima and was in the city when it was destroyed by a nuclear weapon in 1945. He settled in Tokyo in 1961 to become a cartoonist. He produced his first manga for anthologies like Shonen Gaho, Shonen King, and Bokura. By 1966, Nakazawa began to express his memories of Hiroshima in his manga, starting with the fictional Kuroi Ame ni Utarete (Struck by Black Rain) and the autobiographical story Ore wa Mita (I Saw It). Nakazawa’s life work, Barefoot Gen (1972), was the first Japanese comic ever to be translated into Western languages. Barefoot Gen was adapted into two animated films and a live-action TV drama and has been translated into a dozen languages.\n\nNoel Sickles (1910–1982)\n\nNoel Sickles became a political cartoonist for the Ohio State Journal in the late 1920s. He moved to New York in 1933, where he became a staff artist for Associated Press. Here, he was asked to take over the aviation comic strip Scorchy Smith. In that comic, Sickles developed a personal, almost photographic style. His method of drawing became popular among other comic artists and was particularly inspiring to Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates). Sickles and Caniff started working together closely, assisting each other on their comics. After AP turned Sickles down for a salary raise, he devoted the rest of his career to magazine illustration.\n\nCliff Sterrett (1883–1964)\n\nCliff Sterrett is one of the great innovators of the comic page and the creator of the first comic strip starring a heroine in the leading role, Polly and Her Pals. Between 1904 and 1908, he worked for the New York Herald, drawing illustrations and caricatures. He started doing comics when he got the opportunity to draw four daily strips for the New York Evening Telegram in 1911. In 1912, Sterrett was hired by William Randolph Hearst, for whom he created Polly and Her Pals. The strip was initially published in the daily comic page of the New York Journal. A year later, it also became a Sunday page and a four-color supplement to the New York American. Starting in the 1920s, Sterrett used cubist, surrealist, and expressionist elements in his artwork. In 1935 he handed over the daily strip to others to concentrate wholly on the Sunday strip, which he drew until his retirement in 1958.\n\nElmer C. Stoner (1897–1969)\n\nE. C. Stoner was one of the first African American comic book artists. He worked on comics through the Binder, Chesler, and Iger Studios from the late 1930s through the 1940s. For National he drew the “Speed Saunders” story in the first issue of Detective Comics. His other credits included “Blackstone” for EC Comics; “Captain Marvel,” “Lance O’Casey,” and “Spy Smasher” for Fawcett; “Blue Beetle” and “Bouncer” for Fox; “Breeze Barton” and “Flexo” for Timely; and “Doc Savage” and “Iron Munro” for Street & Smith. From 1948 to 1951 he drew a syndicated newspaper comic strip, Rick Kane, Space Marshal, which was written by Walter Gibson, magician and famed author of The Shadow. Stoner is also believed to have created the iconic Mr. Peanut mascot while he was still a teenager in Pennsylvania.\n\nBryan Talbot (1952– )\n\nBryan Talbot was part of the British underground comix scene starting In the late 1960s, creating Brain Storm Comix at Alchemy Press, among other works. In 1978 he began the epic The Adventures of Luther Arkwright saga, one of the first British graphic novels. Talbot began working for 2000AD in 1983, producing three books of the Nemesis the Warlock series with writer Pat Mills. His 1994 Dark Horse graphic novel The Tale of One Bad Rat has won countless prizes. For four years Talbot produced work for DC Comics on titles such as Hellblazer, The Sandman, The Dead Boy Detectives, and The Nazz (with Tom Veitch). His other works include the Grandville series of books, the graphic novels Alice in Sunderland, Dotter of Her Father’s Eyes (with Mary Talbot), and the autobiography Bryan Talbot: Father of the British Graphic Novel.\n\nRon Turner (1940– )\n\nRon Turner founded Last Gasp in 1970: a San Francisco–based book publisher with a lowbrow art and counterculture focus. Over the last 50 years Last Gasp has been a publisher, distributor, and wholesaler of underground comix and books of all types. In addition to publishing notable original titles like Slow Death, Wimmen’s Comix, Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary, Air Pirates, It Ain’t Me Babe, and Weirdo, it also picked up the publishing reins of important titles—such as Zap Comix and Young Lust—from rivals that had gone out of business. The company publishes art and photography books, graphic novels, manga translations, fiction, and poetry.\n\nGeorge Tuska (1916–2009)\n\nGeorge Tuska’s first professional work came in 1939, when he became assistant on the Scorchy Smith newspaper strip. At the same time, he joined the Iger-Eisner Studio. There he worked on stories for a variety of comic book titles, including Jungle, Wings, Planet, Wonderworld, and Mystery Men. In the 1940s, as a member of the Harry “A” Chesler Studio, he drew several episodes of Captain Marvel, Golden Arrow, Uncle Sam, and El Carim. After the war, he continued in the comics field with memorable stories for Charles Biro’s Crime Does Not Pay, as well as Black Terror, Crimebuster, and Doc Savage. He also became the main artist on Scorchy Smith from 1954 to 1959, when he took over the Buck Rogers strip, which he continued until 1967. In the late 1960s, Tuska started working for Marvel, where he contributed to Ghost Rider, Planet of the Apes, X-Men, Daredevil, and Iron Man. He continued drawing superhero comics for DC, including Superman, Superboy, and Challengers of the Unknown. In 1978, along with José Delbo, Paul Kupperberg, and Martin Pasko, Tuska started a new version of the daily Superman comic, which he worked on until 1993.\n\nLynn Varley (1958– )\n\nLynn Varley is an award-winning colorist, notable for her collaborations with her former husband, writer/artist Frank Miller. She provided the coloring for Miller’s Ronin (1984), an experimental six-issue series from DC Comics, and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (1986), a four-issue miniseries that went on to become a commercial and critical success. Subsequently, Varley colored other Miller books, including Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, 300, Elektra Lives Again, and The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot (with Geoff Darrow).\n\nJames Warren (1930– )\n\nJames Warren published Famous Monsters of Filmland, a magazine that influenced just about everyone in comics in the 1950s and 1960s, then went on to publish such influential comics magazines as Creepy, Eerie, Blazing Combat, Vampirella, and The Spirit in the 1960s–1980s. Creators whose work was highlighted in these magazines included Archie Goodwin, Louise Jones (Simonson), Frank Frazetta, Al Williamson, Steve Ditko, Gene Colan, Bernie Wrightson, Billy Graham, Neal Adams, Wally Wood, Alex Toth, John Severin, and Russ Heath.\n\nJudges Named for 2024 Eisner Awards\n\nSix Comics Experts Make Up Nominating Committee\n\nComic-Con is proud to announce that the judging panel has been named for the 2024 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, which will reward excellence for works published in 2023. This year’s judges are Ryan Claytor, N. C. Christopher Couch, Andréa Gilroy, Joseph Illidge, Mathias Lewis, and Jillian Rudes:\n\nThe judges are chosen by Comic-Con’s awards subcommittee, made up of individuals from the board of directors, staff, and various departments. The judges are selected to represent all aspects of the comics industry, including creators, retailers, academic/historians, and journalists. A separate panel of judges is in charge of judging the Eisner Hall of Fame.\n\nThe judges will select the nominees that will be placed on the Eisner Awards ballot in some 30 categories. The nominees will then be voted on by professionals in the comic book industry, and the results will be announced in an awards ceremony at Comic-Con in July.\n\nEisner Awards Now Accepting Submissions for 2024\n\nComic-Con Sets March 15 Deadline\n\nComic-Con International (Comic-Con), the premier comic book and popular arts event in the world, has announced that submissions are being accepted for consideration by the judges for the 2024 Will Eisner Comics Industry Awards.\n\nThe tentative categories include best short story, best single issue/one-shot, best continuing series (at least two issues must have been published in 2023), best limited series (at least half of the series must have been published in 2023), best new series, best limited series, best publications for kids and teens, best anthology, best humor publication, best U.S. edition of international material, best graphic album–new, best graphic album–reprint, best reality-based work, best memoir, best adaptation from another medium, best digital comic, best webcomic, best archival collection, best writer, best writer/artist, best penciller/inker (individual or team), best painter (interior art), best lettering, best coloring, best cover artist, best comics-related book or periodical, best scholarly/academic work, and best publication design. The judges may add, delete, or combine categories at their discretion.\n\nPublishers may submit a maximum of five nominees for any one category, and the same item or person can be submitted in more than one category. Each imprint, line, or subsidiary of a publisher may submit its own set of entries. Creators can submit materials for consideration if their publisher is either no longer in business or is unlikely to participate in the nomination process. Only ONE copy of each book need be submitted, even if it is being nominated in multiple categories. In addition, pdfs of the works are welcome. The cover letter should list the items being submitted and in what category, and it should include both a mailing address and an email address for the person or company submitting the material. (Guidelines for preparing submissions letters are provided with the downloadable pdf of the Call for Submissions.) There are no entry fees.\n\nAll physical submissions should be sent to Jackie Estrada, Eisner Awards Administrator, Comic-Con, 4375 Jutland Drive, San Diego, CA 92117, before the deadline of March 15. No submissions should be sent directly to the judges. Note that this address is new as of 2023.\n\nThe best digital comic and best webcomic categories are open to any new, professionally produced long-form original comics work posted online in 2023. “Digital comics” are complete issues of comics or graphic novels that are available for online viewing or for download. “Webcomics” are comics stories that are serialized online (such as a daily or weekly) and/or that use formats other than the traditional comic book page and take advantage of being online (horizontal, scrolled, etc.). The URLs and any necessary access information should be emailed to Eisner Awards administrator Jackie Estrada: jackie@comic-con.org.\n\nThe Eisner Award nominees will be announced in May, and online voting will be available to professionals in the comics industry, including creators, editors, publishers, distributors, and retailers. The results will be announced at the awards ceremony at Comic-Con on Friday, July 26.\n\nFurther information on the Eisner Awards can be found in this downloadable pdf.\n\nWill Eisner Comic Industry Awards Hall of Fame to Have Separate Judging, Ceremony\n\nThe Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards will turn 36 in 2024. Each year, a panel of judges select the nominees in 30+ categories, and then professionals in the comics industry vote to choose the winners. The trophies are then handed out in an awards ceremony on Friday night of Comic-Con.\n\nFor the Hall of Fame portion of the awards, the judging has evolved to include not only nominees to be voted on via an online ballot but also automatic inductees selected by the judges. These are people that the judges feel have made major contributions to the comic book/graphic storytelling medium but are unlikely to be chosen by voters. These choices have included persons from the pioneering years of comics as well as creators who have been nominated multiple times but not yet been inducted.\n\nAs more and more creators have become eligible for the Hall of Fame (the person’s first significant professional work must have appeared at least 35 years before the year of the awards), the judging panels in recent years have felt the need to expand the number of inductees. In 2022 there were 6 judges’ choices and 6 elected inductees. In 2023 there were 15 judges’ choices and 4 elected inductees.\n\nTo accommodate the increase in recipients in 2023, a separate Hall of Fame ceremony on Friday morning of Comic-Con was established. Doing so allowed for each inductee to get greater attention, and it led to a shorter Friday night ceremony for the other 32 categories (45 minutes less than in 2022).\n\nHolding the separate ceremony was well received, and a similar ceremony is planned for Comic-Con 2024. In addition, to lighten the load on the Eisner judges so they can concentrate on the other categories, a separate Hall of Fame judging panel has been enlisted. This panel is made up of past Eisner Awards judges whose expertise is in the history of comics. Their task is to arrive at the judges’ choice inductees and the nominees to be voted on, with the goal of reaching these decisions by early February. (The 2024 Eisner Awards Call for Entries will be issued in early January, and the judges for 2024 will be announced at that time.)\n\nThe Hall of Fame judges are Dr. William Foster, Michael T. Gilbert, Karen Green, Alonso Nuñez, Jim Thompson, and (no relation) Maggie Thompson. The co-chairs of the judging panel are Jim and Alonso. The Eisner Awards Administrator is Jackie Estrada.\n\nThe Eisner Awards, part of the San Diego Comic Convention organization, are held each summer during Comic-Con.\n\n2024 Will Eisner Comic Industry Hall of Fame Judges\n\nDC Comics can boast of six award winners at the 35th Annual Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, held July 21 at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront.

Sam’s son Thomas accepted the award on his behalf. Maggie Thompson introduced the special In Memoriam video salute to those from the Comic-Con family who died in the past year.\n\nThe Will Eisner Spirit of Comics Retailer Award, given to a store that has done an outstanding job of supporting the comics art medium both in the community and within the industry at large, was awarded by Joe Ferrara to Cape & Cowl (Oakland, CA). Accepting was the owner, Eitan Manhoff.\n\nThe afterparty sponsor was HarperAlley. The principal sponsors were Gentle Giant Studios, mycomicshop.com, and Pan-Universal Galactic Worldwide.

These inductees include 11 deceased comics pioneers and 4 living creators. The deceased greats are: Jerry Bails, Tony DeZuniga, Justin Green, Jay Jackson, Jeffrey Catherine Jones, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Win Mortimer, Diane Noomin, Gaspar Saladino, Kim Thompson, and Mort Walker. The judges’ living choices are Bill Griffith, Jack Katz, Garry Trudeau, and Tatjana Wood.\n\nThe judges have also chosen 16 nominees from whom voters will select 4 to be inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer. These nominees are Gus Arriola, Brian Bolland, Gerry Conway, Edwina Dumm, Mark Evanier, Creig Flessel, Bob Fujitani, Warren Kremer, Todd McFarlane, Keiji Nakazawa, Ann Nocenti, Paul Norris, Bud Plant, Tim Sale, Diana Schutz, and Phil Seuling. More information on the inductees and nominees can be found below.\n\nVoting for the Hall of Fame is being held online. A two-step voting process has been put in place for enhanced security. The first step is for prospective voters to apply at https://form.jotform.com/230927489799177 . After filling out a form, eligible voters will be invited to go to the ballot and cast their votes. Individuals who were approved to vote in 2022 will be sent an invitation to participate and do not need to reregister. Those who are eligible to vote include comic book/graphic novel/webcomic creators (writers, artists, cartoonists, pencillers, inkers, letterers, colorists); comic book/graphic novel publishers and editors; comics historians and educators; graphic novel librarians; and owners and managers of comic book specialty retail stores. The deadline for voting is April 28. Voters must have registered by April 18 in order to be invited to the ballot. Questions about the voting process should be sent to the Eisner Awards administrator, Jackie Estrada at jackie@comic-con.org\n\nThe 2023 Eisner Awards judging panel consists of librarian Moni Barrett, educator/collector Peter Jones, retailer Jen King, journalist Sean Kleefeld, scholar/comics creator A. David Lewis, and instructor/curator TJ Shevlin.\n\nThe Eisner Hall of Fame trophies will be presented in a special program during Comic-Con on the morning of July 21. This is a change from previous years, when the Hall of Fame was part of the Friday night Eisner Awards ceremony. This year the Hall of Fame winners will have their own special spotlight in the daytime, giving more fans the opportunity to attend.\n\n2023 Eisner Hall of Fame Judges’ Choices\n\nThese individuals will automatically be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nDeceased Inductees:\n\nJerry Bails (1933–2006)\n\nKnown as the “Father of Comic Book Fandom,” Jerry Bails was one of the first to approach comic books as a subject worthy of academic study, and he was a primary force in establishing 1960s comics fandom. He was the founding editor of the fanzines Alter-Ego, The Comicollector, and On the Drawing Board, the forerunner to the long-running newszine The Comic Reader, designed to showcase the latest comic news. He then headed the drive to establish the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors. Another important contribution was his Who’s Who of American Comic Books, published in four volumes during 1973–1976.\n\nTony DeZuniga (1932–2012)\n\nTony DeZuniga was the first Filipino comic book artist whose work was accepted by American publishers and was instrumental in recruiting many other Filipino artists to enter the U.S. comics industry in the early 1970s. He is best known for co-creating Jonah Hex and Black Orchid. DeZuniga divided his time between DC and Marvel, drawing not only Jonah Hex and Conan but also many other well-known characters including Doc Savage, Thor, The X-Men, Swamp Thing, Batman, Dracula, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Red Sonja, The Punisher, and Spider-Man.\n\nJustin Green (1945–2022)\n\nJustin Green is most noted for the 1972 underground title Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary. This autobiographical comic book detailed Green’s struggle with a form of OCD known as scrupulosity, within the framework of growing up Catholic in 1950s Chicago. Intense graphic depiction of personal torment had never appeared in comic book form before, and it had a profound effect on other cartoonists and the future direction of comics as literature. The underground comix pioneer was also a contributor to such titles as Bijou Funnies, Insect Fear, Arcade, Young Lust, and Sniffy Comics. In the 1990s, Green focused his cartooning attention on a series of visual biographies for Pulse!, the in-house magazine for Tower Records. It ran for ten years and was later collected as Musical Legends.\n\nJay Jackson (1905–1954)\n\nJay Paul Jackson was an African American artist who spent many years working for the Chicago Defender, in addition to working as an illustrator for science fiction magazines such as Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures. Jackson introduced the world to the first black superhero on January 6, 1945, in “the oldest, longest continuously running black comic strip,” Bungleton Green, in the Chicago Defender. Bungleton Green, the name of the character as well as the strip, became the literal embodiment of the black ideal, a man who in all ways was equal, even superior, to the whites whose relentless oppression Jackson constantly fought.\n\nJeffrey Catherine Jones (1944–2011)\n\nJeff Jones began creating comics in 1964. While attending Georgia State College, Jones met fellow student Mary Louise Alexander, whom she married in 1966. After graduation, the couple moved to New York City but split up in the early 1970s (writer/editor Louise Jones Simonson was inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame in 2020). In New York Jones found work drawing for King Comics, Gold Key, Creepy, Eerie, and Vampirella, as well as Wally Wood’s Witzend. In the early 1970s when National Lampoon began publication, Jones had a strip in it called Idyl. From 1975 to 1979 Jones shared workspace with Bernie Wrightson, Barry Windsor-Smith, and Michael Wm Kaluta, collectively named The Studio. By the early 1980s, Jones had a recurring strip in Heavy Metal titled I’m Age. In the late 1990s, Jones started taking female hormones and had sex reassignment surgery. She passed away in May of 2011.\n\nAline Kominsky-Crumb (1948–2022)\n\nKominsky-Crumb was born Aline Goldsmith in 1948, in Long Island, New York. In 1971 she moved to San Francisco and fell in with the all-female collective that founded Wimmen’s Comix, and contributed stories to the anthology’s inaugural issues. In 1975, she departed Wimmen’s Comix and with fellow former contributor Diane Noomin launched Twisted Sisters, which would eventually spawn an anthology and a limited series featuring work by many Wimmen’s Comix contributors. Kominisky married Robert Crumb in 1978, a few years after the couple began co-creating the comic Dirty Laundry, about their life together. Aline drew her own character, “the Bunch,” later collected into Love That Bunch. In 1981 she took the editorial reins of Crumb’s Weirdo anthology and remained the series’ editor through its 1993 conclusion. In 1990, the Crumbs moved to a small village in southern France, where they continued to collaborate. Aline’s 2007 memoir, Need More Love, earned her critical acclaim.\n\nWin Mortimer (1919–1998)\n\nCanadian artist James Winslow Mortimer began working for DC Comics in 1945 and quickly became a cover artist for comics featuring Superman, Superboy, and Batman. He succeeded Wayne Boring on the Superman newspaper strip in 1949, leaving it in 1956 to create the adventure strip David Crane for the Prentice-Hall Syndicate. During the same period, Mortimer returned to DC and worked on a large variety of comics, ranging from humor titles such as Swing with Scooter to superhero features starring the Legion of Super-Heroes and Supergirl. He and writer Arnold Drake co-created Stanley and His Mons"
