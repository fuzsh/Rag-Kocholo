        "text": "The CODE Burt Award “is a literary award and readership initiative that recognizes excellence in locally authored literature for young adults, ages 12-18. The objective of the prize is to champion literacy, build language skills, and foster the love and habit of reading by ensuring that young people have access to high-quality, culturally relevant, and engaging reading materials” (CODE Burt Award for Young Adult Literature).\n\nBased in Canada, CODE first established the foundation in Tanzania, but it has eventually spread to Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Caribbean. This award was designed to honor authors from Africa who create and publish books in support of young literature. The importance of literature among young adolescents is growing in Africa and many authors are being awarded for their efforts. Authors in Ghana, Ethiopia, and Kenya, and Tanzania are trying to encourage younger adolescents to read and become more interested in literature.\n\nThe CODE Burt Award for Ghanaian Young Adult Literature and the Ghana Book Trust have worked together to improve literacy within schools in Ghana. This specific award encourages authors who are improving language skills among younger readers and are instilling a love of reading among readers. Ruby Yayra Goka from Ghana was the winner of the 2018 CODE Burt Award for African Young Adult Literature for her book To Kiss a Girl. This novel is about a young girl who loses her older sister and must cope with her death. This is a coming of age novel that highlights the importance of family and adolescent life.\n\nCODE-Ethiopia is another organization, located in Ethiopia, that works with the Burt Award for African Young Adult Literature. This is an award that recognizes authors of young adult literature. Publishing companies and industries are improving in Ethiopia, so recognizing talented authors is critical in the establishment of literate young adults.\n\nKenya and Tanzania also have separate organizations that work with CODE. For example, Kenya has the National Book Development Council of Kenya (NBDCK) that supports reading among young adults and reading in general in Kenya. These programs are helping schools and primary schools incorporate more reading and literature into the curriculum. Tanzania works with the Children’s Book Project (CBP), which is an “award-winning literacy organization.”\n\nAll of these organizations are critical in creating an environment for young adults in Africa where they can learn the significance of being able to read. Not only are these awards and organizations critical in creating an environment for readers, but they are creating an environment for authors in Africa. We tend to focus on American authors and their work on YA literature, but African authors are writing novels for YA readers as well and should be acknowledged. Being able to read and experience things we can relate to or learn from is tremendously important for young adults. Whether that be in the United States or in Africa, literature opens the doors for all younger adults.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“African Young Adult Literature.” CODE, CODE’s Burt Literary Awards, 2018. www.burtaward.org/african-young-adult-lit\n\nWhen Tilly Maguire, an 18-year-old from Melbourne, Australia gets an internship with an impressive PR firm in London, she is faced with many awkward, yet exciting encounters. Tilly is a talented young writer who happened to become quickly popular among many for her high school work, including Roche PR. A new job opportunity in London puts Tilly in a tricky situation when she gets invited to a ball where she meets Jack Guthrie, Reuben Vaughan, and Princess Isabelle.\n\nTilly quickly realizes that her new job is going to be completely different than she imaged when she stumbles at the steps of the museum and breaks her shoe in front of her long-time crush and boy band idol, Reuben Vaughan. Tilly, who is usually good with words, is found caught off guard with no words to say. Her 13-year-old self is screaming with nervousness as Reuben sits in front of her, fixing her shoe, just like out of a scene from a movie. After being called into the museum by captivated Jack Guthrie, who just happens to be a friend of Reuben, Tilly can’t believe what is happening in front of her eyes. Surrounded by beautiful, wealthy A-list celebrities and royals, as well as her boss Henrietta, Tilly is caught between work and an unexpected love triangle.\n\nWhen Tilly happens to snap a picture of Reuben Vaughan and Princess Isabelle in a close encounter at the ball and posts it onto Instagram with hashtags insinuating a potential engagement, things start to get interesting. What Tilly thought was a confession of love from Isabelle, turns out to be a coming out to Reuben. This completely shocks Reuben and relieves him, as their long history of friendship won’t be turned into something more romantic. Henrietta, Tilly, Isabelle, Jack, and Reuben all gather together to discuss what is really going on. Everyone sits in awe when they find out Princess Isabelle is interested in girls.\n\nTilly, who just flew in from Australia and lost all of her luggage, finds herself in a hideous green dress with messy hair and a broken shoe at a ball that she really shouldn’t be at and with people she really shouldn’t be surrounded by… yet here she is. She has happened to meet Reuben Vaughan, a handsome boy band celebrity who she has had a crush on since the age of thirteen. She has managed to witness a confession by Princess Isabelle that could change everything for the royals. She has managed to get an internship with Roche PR who just happens to work with Reuben, who just happens to be interested in Tilly. Not only is Reuben potentially interested in Tilly, but Jack has shown some attention, as well as Princess Isabelle! How has this work event turned into something so much more?!\n\nAs Tilly struggles with the stress and excitement of her new internship, she is faced with many things that other teenagers deal with in their own lives. Tilly deals with anxiety and lack of self-confidence. As a high school introvert who is sent to London by herself, Tilly must find the confidence to continue writing and to continue learning more about herself. Being a teenage girl can be hard. You’re constantly under pressure to do well and to make it seem like you have everything figured out, when you really don’t.\n\nEmma Grey, author of Tilly Maguire and the Royal Wedding Mess, does a great job at incorporating many young adult themes into her novel. She is able to include humor in her story as she writes about Tilly’s character and her teenage life. This allows younger readers to connect more to what they’re reading and feel as if they can relate to Tilly’s character. Grey also includes important issues within this novel like sexuality and mental health. American young adult literature tends to avoid writing about things such as sexuality and being apart of the LGTBQ community as a young adult. It is pretty rare to find a character that is openly gay or lesbian in a YA book. I really admire the fact that this Australian novel written by Grey included the character Princess Isabelle, who came out as lesbian early in the novel. It is important for young adolescents to read about those who may have a different sexual orientation or preference. This allows for open-mindedness and acceptance of others in the YA community.\n\nIn this particular novel, Tilly struggles with anxiety and panic attacks. This is also something that tends to go unnoticed and tends to be excluded in YA literature. The inclusion of mental health and mental health related issues is crucial in YA literature because mental health is extremely important in today’s world. Younger readers need to know that it is okay to suffer from something like anxiety and those readers who may suffer from anxiety themselves, can relate to Tilly and her struggles.\n\nTilly Maguire and the Royal Wedding Mess is an excellent novel that all young adult readers should read. This novel shows the importance of being yourself and learning the importance of doing what you love. Teenagers, especially teenage girls, will enjoy reading about Tilly and her exciting love interests, as well as her thrilling internship in London. This Australian novel does an amazing job at telling the story of Tilly, a regular teenage girl who just wants to fit in and do what she does best, write.\n\nWords Cited\n\nGrey, E. (2018). Tilly Maguire and the Royal Wedding Mess. HarperCollins Publishers Australia.\n\nEllen Banda-Aaku is a brilliant young adult novelist who had trouble with her publisher in Anglophone sub-saharan Africa before finally getting her novel published later. To get a young adult novel published in there, specific changes need to be made. For example, all of the characters regardless of their age or background have to make good moral decisions. It is good for to make the right decision, but it makes certain novels unbelievable, especially when it comes to books where the leads are teenagers.\n\nEllen Banda-Aaku explained why these changes constantly need to be made in young adult literature. African literature does not have the best book market. There is a high amount of poverty in Africa, especially the area where her publisher is, and there are many individuals who are illiterate. Most books do not sell very well, and they definitely do not get the credit or the status that a book in the United States would get. The only way a good book could be published and be successful is if the government buys the books for schools. In order for the book to be bought, the government must make sure the book is suitable for young adults, and including all of the lead characters making good decisions help the book pass the code necessary for it to have a chance to become a success. Ellen Banda-Aaku said it best herself: “The reality of most publishers on the continent…is that to survive as publishers of fiction, they have to depend on the ministry of education or whichever department funds reading material for school children” (Banda-Aaku).\n\nThe book market is a business. Everything is about making money, and the only way these books can make money is if they make all of the necessary changes the government wants. Banda-Aaku understood that the government is trying to be cautious and make sure the books young adults were reading were appropriate, but as an author, the whole thing becomes very frustrating, especially since the novels were written for young adults in the first place. Some of the realistic aspects of young adult African literature were not apparent, and that can easily lead to young adults not wanting to read them because there is a lack of relatability.\n\nSome changes should be made so that young adults can read a novel they can relate to and so that the authors can maintain creative control. It all has to do with making a profit. If only there is a better way for these novels to make money in their own location or anywhere else in the world. The growing young mind needs to have the ability to read, but controlling the reading materials will only lead to young adults not learning how to cope with more mature themes suitable for their age group.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBanda-Aaku. “Please Don’t Air Brush African Teen Fiction.” The Guardian, 6 November, 2015.\n\nHave you ever been obsessed with the idea of dying? Do thoughts of death and mayhem excite you? Do you usually wince when you see the sight of blood, or do you just stare at it in wonder and awe? Most people would probably not be very intrigued by death and carnage as well as get a sickening feeling in their stomachs when seeing blood. The characters of Boku and Morino in the 2003 novel Goth by Otsuichi feel the opposite.\n\nGoth follows these two teenagers, Boku and Morino, who are obsessed with death and actively seek out killers or violent people due to their fascination. The book is divided into multiple parts, with each part dealing with a different psychotic human being. One example is “The Wristcut Incident,” which centers on a science teacher who constantly chops off people’s hands and keeps them as a collection. Another example involves a person named Saeki who has always had an urge to bury someone alive. Saeki buries a little boy and later a high school girl. Boku and Morino actively seek out these individuals to observe them. They are not necessarily sorry for the victims. They are just curious about the lives of these maniacs. Boku even goes as far as to steal the hands the psychotic science teacher has been collecting near the end of that segment of the novel.\n\nConsidering the fact that Boku and Morino do not sympathize with any of the victims is very different from most novels, especially a standard young adult novel. This novel strives to be different. The characters we get to know the most and follow around throughout the entire novel are not the standards heroes who save others and form good relationships. The protagonists in this novel are the opposite. They do not seek out to help others most of the time. They just observe, and they do not have good relationships with others because they are both different from other people. Boku and Morino do not even care about each other most of the time. They just have a special connection because of their shared interest in gruesome acts of violence. This is a bold choice that the author made. After all, novels involving young adults put into serious danger and having a gruesome obsession would not typically be considered appropriate for the young adult audience, even though it is a young adult novel itself.\n\nThe book is very entertaining, and it would most likely appeal to teenagers, which is understandable considering it was written for young adults. The protagonists are very interesting, especially since they think a little differently than most people. They do everything normal teenagers do. They go to school, they chat while going on walks, and they go home for dinner. The beat by beat actions of the characters between going home for dinner and going to school are not unlike those of any normal teenager, and that is something the target audience can relate to. However, in between going to school and getting home in time for dinner, the two of them investigate and follow people who are their main suspects in horrible acts of violence. This will most likely be a part of the appeal to teenagers, and it was appealing to me while I was reading it. Readers get to experience investigation and hearing about horrible acts of violence and murder. The book combines the normal lives of teenagers with something out of a procedural crime drama.\n\nThe novel itself does a good job of pacing itself. After all, there are six stories in this one novel. It has an episodic structure. After the main characters investigate a case, they would observe the psychotic person, and the chapter would be over after the maniac either got caught or the whole segment simply ended abruptly without a true conclusion. The whole novel was very interesting because as a reader, there are not very many slow moments. Each story does not last very long. There is brief exposition, some rising actions, a well-done climax, and some of them have a satisfying ending.\n\nOverall, the novel is very well done, the format allows the novel to not drag, and it is very entertaining. However, there are some actions in the novel, such as the cutting off of hands and the burying of young children, that may be unsuitable for some immature teenagers. The novel gives young adults a lesson on being aware of there own surroundings. There are some people out there who cause great harm to others, and the novel tells teenagers that some of the horrible acts of violence can happen in their own backyard. The novel tells young adults to be careful. All in all, I would easily recommend this book for young adults who are mature and comfortable enough to handle some of the actions in this novel.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nOtsuichi. Goth.

Their board consists of members from multiple academic institutions and international organizations. Each year, they give out the Middle East Book Awards, which includes a Youth Literature Category Award. Other categories include Picture Book (children’s and youth non-fiction. The purpose of this award is to recognize meaningful contributions to Middle Eastern-based literature.\n\nThe 2018 winner for the Youth Literature Category was Jennifer Zeynab Joukhadar with her novel “The Map of Salt and Stars.” The plotline follows two female protagonists (Joukhadar, 2019). Nour is a Syrian-American refugee that loses her mother, who was a cartographer. She is forced to return back to Syria, where they are again in harm’s way. The other main character is Rawiya – a girl from the 12thcentury who must dress like a boy to work for a famous mapmaker. She leaves home and begins a journey from the Middle East and across North Africa.\n\nThe previous year, Hala Alyan took home the award for the novel “Salt Houses.” The story is set during the Palestinian displacement of the 20thcentury (Alyan, 2018). Jumping from the view of multiple narrators, the novel follows one family through generations. It provides a look at major issues affecting the Middle East today through its approach of style.\n\nIn 2016, “When the Moon is Low” by Nadia Hashimi was the co-winner for the Youth Literature Category. This story follows a family’s journey to escape Afghanistan during the rise of the Taliban (Hasimi, 2016). Fereiba and Mahmoud seek refuge in Europe through underground networks using forged papers. They lose their son to human trafficking and must continue on for their other children. These three novels are excellent representations of the MEOC’s mission.\n\nThe cause of the MEOC is extremely important in today’s society. The Middle East has become a hot-button issue in the political world, but not all media portrayal on their issues has been fair. By awarding those who accurately and purposefully showcase Middle Eastern culture, the MEOC is taking progressive action towards the future. This is done by their decision of having literary awards for children young adult novels. This will hopefully lead to more adaptation of Middle East YA literature in the classroom. Only through education of can our youth receive an accurate portrayal of various cultures and doing so through award-winning YA literature can make for an impactful learning experience.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Middle East Book Award.” Middle East Outreach Council, 2018, www.meoc.us/book-awards.html.\n\nJoukhadar, J.

Josh enjoys practicing magic, has his eyes on Sophia, is unambitious, and collects antique clocks while Sophia is all brains, extremely gifted, has social anxiety and fails to relate well to others. This book attempts to portray the difficulties present when a person from one background, family, and social class is attracted to someone who is different from him in all regards. And this book aims to display the happiness that results from two such teenagers coming together.\n\nThe plot of this novel takes place in Melbourne, Australia but the culture was extremely similar to that of America. It felt like I was just reading about a typical high-school-outliers-who-start-dating story. Josh, Sophia and all their friends struggle with the same pressures when it comes to college and the future. They seek to find something they love which they can passionately pursue for a lifetime whether it’s a mathematical theory, relationship, or magic trick. It was enlightening to know that adolescents growing up on the other side of the world go through relatable experiences.\n\nKeil attempts to appeal to adolescents by including as much pop culture as possible according to the interests of Josh and Sophia. For the nerdier Sophia, we read about Dr. Who, her supreme hatred of romantic comedies (particularly The Lake House), every reference to math possible, and lots of random facts that prove she has an eidetic memory. But with Josh, we read about all sorts of magic. David Copperfield is mentioned all the time to show that Josh isn’t just a magician who cares about the big stage but instead wants to be involved with his audience. As I read, I felt like each chapter had a minimum number of references to the characters’ respective interests that had to be met in order to publish. I understood that Sophia really liked math within the first few chapters, but the rest of the book seemed like it was trying to convince me she still loved math, and this distracted me from the plot. Keil’s writing also appealed to an adolescent audience because it was written in very simple prose, but she sacrificed readability for relatability by constantly including the word “like” when the younger audience was talking. The over-incorporation of unnecessary words and references that seemed to prove her characters liked what she claimed made the book feel more persuasive than anything else. I didn’t want to be convinced that I was an adolescent; this book reminded me why I moved on to more challenging literature.\n\nThe entire book focuses on and attempts to show how vast the differences between the two protagonists are: Josh is personable with his crowd of people while Sophia has one friend, Elsie, and they even go through a major fight for the second half of the book. The problem in reading this book was that Keil succeeded in portraying how different Josh and Sophia are to the point that their dating at the end felt unnatural and forced. At one point, Josh leads Sophia to their school, alone at night for a performance where he makes the school disappear. She is not very outgoing throughout the entire book but at the end of the performance she yells, “You’re brilliant!” and loves the performance (Keil, 2017, pg. 281). But the book up to this point made me think she would hate the entire situation. Though she was alone at their school at night applauding, I felt like I was the one in the dark. There were multiple times where Josh would do something for Sophia that I expected her to hate but she uncharacteristically loved it time and again which led the book to be very predictable.\n\nKeil made their ethnic differences seem almost negligible but emphasized that they have different abilities to socialize and have different interests. At a party, Sophia described Josh as, “[t]he silent ghost boy from St. Augustine’s is totally in his element here, swarming in a sea of goodwill and friends” (Keil, 2017, pg. 167). Sophia, on the other hand, needs to be calmed down in the middle of class by a gentle touch from Elsie when her mind goes down a rabbit hole (Keil, 2017, pg. 7). Josh was drawn to Sophia’s lack of regard for what others thought of her, however, she eventually was drawn to the way he regarded her. The overall takeaway in Keil’s ability to portray two seemingly incompatible characters coming together and overcoming adversity is predictably written. I understand this appeal to an adolescent audience by focusing on surface level differences which can be overcome to instill confidence in overcoming adversity, but it seems to keep adolescents from growing and adapting to realistic circumstances. I would have enjoyed Keil delving deeper into the fundamental aspects that distinguish the two: their differing families, social classes, ethnic backgrounds, rather than just miraculously bringing together oil and water.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nKeil, M. (2017). The Secret Science of Magic. Atlanta, GA: Peachtree.\n\nBetween Us by Clare Atkins is a story about an Iranian refugee girl, named Anahita and an Australian boy, named Jono crossing paths and ultimately falling in love. There is only one problem they are facing, a large cement wall keeping them apart. Anahita lives with her pregnant mother and younger brother, Arash, in the Wickham Point Detention Center, trying to become Australian citizens to obtain a better life than they lived in Iran. Jono is the son of a detention officer, named Kenny, who is struggling with his mother leaving him, his sister leaving to study in Sydney and a complicated relationship with his father. Anahita, otherwise known as Ana, isn’t permitted to leave the detention center except to go to school, where she meets Jono after his father regretfully informs Ana of him. Kenny is told by another officer that he should not have told Ana about his son, nor should he talk with the detainees about his personal life for fear of being manipulated and used. This novel is the gut wrenching reality of what asylum seeking people are going through in Australia, per the postscript at the end of the book. This story may contain fictional characters and fictional events, however the general story and situations are similar to those seeking asylum in Australia.\n\nIn the beginning of the book, the reader follows Ana’s first ride to the high school in Palmerston. The very first page begins with Ana’s struggle to get on the detention center bus to school. The officers escorting the kids on the bus take attendance by their boat numbers, Ana’s being “KIN016.” This shows how the refugees are just numbers to the guards and higher ups over seeing the detention center. Next, the reader follows Jono’s morning before school, showing the extreme difference in the life each one lives. After seeing Ana’s beginning at school the story focuses on Kenny’s encounter with the other officer on the bus, Cara. Cara states, “Shouldn’t have told that girl about your son…. Last thing you want is your kid getting mixed up with someone like that… They can use your kids against you. Manipulate you. Manipulate him” (Atkins, 148). After this the events to follow occur from a mix of Kenny’s uneasiness over telling Ana about Jono and the misunderstandings between Kenny and his son.\n\nThroughout the book the reader explores the thoughts and events experienced by Ana, Jono and Kenny as they overlap. The reader will understand all sides of events that are occurring with hopes that the two or three sides will come to an understanding. During this story, the reader sees a change in Jono, from an angry teenage boy to someone wanting more for his future. The reader also experiences the rise and fall of Ana and Jono’s relationship, along with the absolute low of Kenny and Jono’s relationship to being rebuilt after Kenny learns how to understand his son. Due to Jono not knowing his father completely, because of the terrible relationship they have, Ana confides something in Jono about his dad that he accuses her of lying about. It isn’t until Ana has decided to cut ties with Jono and he asking his father does he realize how wrong he was. By that time it is too late to make amends with Ana.\n\nOverall, this book caught my attention very early on. It showed three different points of views on the same situation. The reader experiences the thoughts and feelings of someone on the inside, someone on the outside and someone who is somewhere in the middle. The reader encounters Ana’s past and reason for seeking refuge in Australia. I believe this book was written to raise awareness of why allowing refugees into a country is so important. Most asylum seeking people are not trying to move into a country to become terrorists, but to gain a better life and leave the lifestyle they lived behind. Many disagree with the culture they live in, but are unable to move to a new country because of their financial situation or fear of being rejected and being punished when sent back. I thought this book was very intriguing and well written. The ending is tragic but more real than the “happily ever after” that most people think should be written about. More people should write about refugees and asylum seeking to raise awareness of the reasons for migrating to another country. No one enjoys moving, let alone to a new country, whether it be over seas or just across a border; thus, we, as a society, should try to understand the reasoning for anyone seeking asylum in a new place. Although this novel is set in Australia, the topic of refugees and the way the Australian citizens treat them apply to the United States. I feel that with this novel, and novels similar to it, there could be a change in the way of thinking about refugees and immigration. All in all, this was a great book and I would definitely recommend it to most of my friends and family!\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAtkins, Clare. Between Us.

Through this, authors are able to create relatable situations in which readers can immerse themselves in the lives of characters and learns valuable lessons without actually experiencing them. This technique is used in many ways, but one could argue that there is no more important way to utilize this than to educate about past events. This becomes especially true when looking at historical events of significance such as the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nWith some research, it is relatively easy to find several different pieces of Young Adult (YA) literature that utilize this horrific event of past in some way or another. The novel, Sachiko: A Nagasaki Bomb Survivor’s Story is one of the most blatant usages. This nonfiction text “tells the true story of six-year-old Sachiko Yasui’s survival of the Nagasaki atomic bomb on August 9, 1945, and the heartbreaking and lifelong aftermath” (Stelson). Stelson’s piece looks to explore the impact of the bombings on people during that time and throughout history until today. Sachiko has won many awards since its publication, truly highlighting the value behind educating students, and readers in general, about events such as this one.\n\nYA fiction also utilizes history in different ways and draws from true events to create fantastical worlds. The collection of stories Diverse Energies contains many pieces including “The Last Day” by Ellen Oh. In this dystopian fiction, questions such as, “what if no one knew about the effects of the atomic bomb? What if, even after the decimation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese emperor continued the war?” (Law). In this piece, the protagonist is a boy named Kenji who works to keep his mother and sister alive after the bombings and after the death of his father and brother in the war. This piece creatively educates about the aftermath of the nuclear attacks while piquing the interest of young readers through fiction and dystopia.\n\nEducating young adults about historical events can be difficult in a traditional school setting, but by utilizing pieces such as Sachiko and “The Last Day,” adolescents and other readers have the opportunity to learn in other mediums. Such events as the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had such impact on the movement of World War II, and the impact has continued through the building of society today. With the utilization of YA literature, education on these events can be facilitated in classrooms everywhere.\n\nWork Cited\n\nLaw, Victoria. “Two YA Authors Explore Life After the Bomb,” bitchmedia, 2013.

In this heartwarming tale, Rachel is first introduced to Grace through an unlikely friendship with a man named Mr. Alistair Preston. His connection with Grace is deep and mysterious, and as Rachel learns about Grace’s past, she also learns about why Mr. Preston feels so strongly for Grace. This novel is touching and relatable, and through its development readers are reminded to hold judgments on others until information on their past is revealed. This bildungsroman emphasizes the struggle associated with caring for those who cannot care for themselves along with the self-actualization that comes with taking care of others.\n\nFinding Grace opens with “Grace had a brain injury. That’s just how she was” (Brugman 1). Brugman wastes no time in introducing the titular character, but she spends the rest of the novel providing bits of information about Grace in order to give the reader the sense of learning about Grace, or “finding” her, just as Rachel did. In this way, the reader becomes connected to Rachel, to Grace, and to the story almost immediately as Brugman immerses the reader into the plot and gives them a sense of interaction with the characters.\n\nMost of the story revolves around the growth in the relationship between Rachel and Grace. Rachel’s preconceived notion that caring for Grace will be easy is shattered on her first day as caretaker when Grace wets herself twice and then is forgotten by Rachel in the bathtub. Rachel learns that in order to do her job, she must think for two rather than one, and must always keep Grace in the forefront of her mind. In this, she slowly but surely becomes proficient, and then successful in her role. With her successes, Rachel – and the reader – learn about Grace’s past which shifts Rachel’s understanding of Grace as a person.\n\nThis turning point in outlook comes after Rachel reads Grace’s letters and inner thoughts that were written before Grace’s accident. As Rachel realizes that Grace is more than just a job, her understanding of life changes. There is a noticeable shift in Rachel’s perspective, and her mantra of “I was eighteen and knew everything” which was noted several times changed to “I am eighteen and I know a few things.” (51, 190). This discovery leaves Rachel vulnerable to her own emotions as she begins to see that life is truly not fair. In an attempt to grasp this concept and make peace with it, she takes solace and comfort in her relationships and takes measures to bring her friends and family closer together. She treats Grace as though she was Grace before her accident, and she calls Grace by “turtledove,” a nickname and indicator of friendship on Rachel’s part (104). She also fosters a relationship with a boy she meets at university named Hiro. Hiro is quirky like Rachel but displays a confidence in himself that Rachel is drawn to. Her attraction to him forms a foundation for later romance in the novel which displays Rachel’s eventual movement toward acceptance of her own quirks. Rachel’s friendship with Alistair also strengthens as he becomes comfortable enough to reveal his love for Grace along with the guilt he feels about her accident. In this friendship, Rachel and Alistair also utilize a nickname – though instead of “turtledove,” they use “chum” (120). Last, Rachel pursues a lost friendship of her old neighbor Anna and looks to reconnect with her.\n\nRachel’s relationships with these characters, along with other characters in Finding Grace, are a manifestation of her journey toward ownership of oneself and understanding about the trials and tribulations of life. One character so far unmentioned is the cat, Prickles. Though most of Prickles interaction in the book is passive and curated as part of the background, Prickles represents many of the themes presented in the book. When Rachel first meets Prickles, she questions his name. This creates a dialogue and an eventual discovery about how Grace became the owner of this cat. Prickles is also the first thing Rachel is comfortable with when she begins her job as caretaker. Possibly this is because Rachel does not feel she has to impress on or prove anything to the cat, so she is naturally less tense around him compared to the rest of the company visiting Grace along with Grace herself.\n\nAbout halfway through the novel, the reader is bombarded with a true atrocity as Grace’s neighbor – nicknamed Shouter – abuses Prickles; eventually Shouter ends his game by punting the cat across the lawn. As Rachel desperately looks to manage Grace and save Prickles, it becomes blatantly apparent that bad things happen to good people, and life moves on regardless of these happenings. Though there is justice in Shouter’s deed as he is later arrested, Prickles is still gravely injured and requires many weeks of recovery.\n\nFinding Grace is a novel that outlines humanism at its finest. In its sarcastic and colloquial writing, the reader is reminded of many lessons that are learned during late adolescence and beyond. Rachel’s journey of self-actualization is one of triumphs and missteps, not unlike most teens’. In Finding Grace, we do indeed find Grace, but if one takes a step back, one may also find themselves.\n\nWork Cited\n\nBrugman, Alyssa. Finding Grace. Crows Nest, Australia, Allen Unwin, 2001.\n\nThe book Waste Not Your Tears, by Vivienne Ndlovu does an incredible job of displaying the HIV/AIDS crisis in Zimbabwe, which is why it would be the perfect teaching tool in the classroom. The novel portrays a “Lady’s Man,” Roderick, who contracts the disease then passes it on to a young lady who he claims to love, Loveness. I will present a lesson plan for this novel coupled with an informational article about the crisis. This lesson is best fitted for an 8th through 12th grade classroom.\n\nThe article I would suggest using alongside this book is called “Progress in Zimbabwe’s HIV/AIDS Battle,” by Michael Fleshman. The article discusses how HIV rates have fallen over the last few years in Zimbabwe, as well as the strategies being used to combat the disease. Some of these strategies include programs to educate about the disease, and improving the status of women.\n\nAs far as the lesson plan goes, I would begin by having students take two column notes while reading both pieces. Two column notes include an exact quote with a page number from the book in one column, and the readers thoughts, interpretations, connections or analysis directly next to it in the second column. Once readers have read both, they should come to class ready to participate in discussion. Since readers already have notable passages marked the discussion will go much more smoothly, with exacts points in the novel to reference rather than vague ideas.\n\nBased on the article, here are some discussion questions I would suggest the teacher ask the class:\n\n1) What strategies to combat HIV/AIDS from the article do you see being used in Waste Not Your Tears?\n\nThis question will force readers to think about this piece of fiction as an extension of the real world rather than only fiction, as many of the HIV prevention strategies mentioned in the article are mirrored in the novel.\n\n2) The article suggests “improvements in the status of women” (Fleshman), as a possible cause for lower HIV rates. How would these improvements have benefited Loveness in the novel? Would she still have gotten sick?\n\nThis question will bring forth the culture that Loveness was afflicted by, and draw attention to why this improved status for women was so necessary in the HIV battle.\n\n3) The article also sites “education and prevention” (Fleshman), as a reason for falling HIV/AIDS rates. While we see a lot of this pushed later in the text, would Roderick have still contracted this disease if he had been educated on it before he had it?\n\nWhile the answer to this question seems like it would obviously be yes, a look at Roderick’s denial of having the disease as well as reluctance to change his lifestyle after infected might suggest otherwise. The hope of this question is to get students to analyze the character of Roderick in order to guess how he might act.\n\nMy hope in pairing this article with this novel is to make the unit more about the HIV/AIDS crisis in Zimbabwe, rather than simply a book or article alone. While the article talks about numbers and an overview of strategies, the novel puts it in a more personal perspective. While the novel is fiction, the article is nonfiction, allowing students to see how the novel is rooted in the real world and how the real world statistics often play out in people’s lives.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nNdlovu, Vivienne.
