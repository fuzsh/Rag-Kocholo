        "text": "AKA Blame Mercedes Lackey, Behind The Supernatural Society\n\nBack when I was first transitioning into reading adult books, Gentle Reader, it was pretty natural to cross from children’s fantasy (there was no YA as a category back then) into adult fantasy via Mercedes Lackey. (I still hold that Arrows is, in fact, YA. It simply has never been packaged that way. Silly marketing.)\n\nFor me that transition went pretty smoothly because, well… girls and soul bonded horses. I know, but in case you never guessed, I’ve always been a super girly girl (aside from being totally not squeamish about bugs and food and dirt and climbing anything that will stand still long enough for me to get up it and… where was I?)\n\nOh yes, so child Gail began reading adult books because white horses with purple eyes on cover.\n\nDuh.\n\nI don’t know that I have a pithy place I am going with this post. I guess I’m writing it because I get asked a lot:\n\nWhy I include gay characters in my books?\n\nI find the question confusing.\n\nLike, Gail, why do you include food in your books? Or descriptions of dresses? Or fragment sentences? It’s part of my DNA as a writer. My world view.\n\nMy world.\n\nBut that also seems to trivialize the whole darn thing.\n\nI think a better question is, why would I not?\n\nMercedes Lackey always inhabits her work with gay and lesbian characters. They are not always central characters, as they are the Last Herald Mage series, but they are always there.\n\nKeep reading Lackey and you end up with poly relationships. Gail, age 14 thought Knight of Ghosts and Shadows had the most romantic ending of any book EVER, and kinda still does.) All these relationships are presented in a supportive light. Which made perfect sense to child Gail with all her Berkeley and San Francisco poet, artist, dancer, musician aunties and uncles (and uncles who were also aunties).\n\nSince then, I’m lucky enough to have socialized with Mercedes on a few occasions as a grown up professional author (and she is just as warm and wonderful as you might hope).\n\nNYT Bestselling authors can also be is fan girls!\n\nI’m afraid when I first met Mercedes Lackey, my friend Lauren and I rather fan-girled all over her. Almost entirely because we wanted to impress upon her the fact that her books were so very important because they gave us a model of fantasy that included alternate sexuality.\n\nAs she went to pains to point out, there were other genre authors doing this before her. But those authors were generally less accessible to young women.\n\nHer books were/are important because in them queer wasn’t a big deal. It just was. And so when Lauren and I began to write it just was for us, too.\n\nQueer fiction can change the world with normalization.\n\nMaking something fun to read, full of joy, and casually representative is a powerful instrument of change.\n\nSo there it is, the answer to your question of why, is essentially…\n\nblame Mercedes Lackey.\n\nYour (still a) fan girl,\n\nMiss Gail\n\nBooks by moi with queer MAIN characters\n\n(Everything I write has queer representation in some form, but these have the most.)\n\nThe Supernatural Society Series\n\nThe San Andreas Shifter Series\n\nCompetence\n\nCurious Case\n\n5th Gender\n\nDivinity 36\n\nOther Peoples Thoughts\n\nOur First LGBTQ+ Books on Bookriot\n\nI’m not crying, your crying. Early love in the Queer Community.\n\n8 Funny Books Featuring Queer Adult Women\n\nFind my books\n\nDirectly from Me | Amazon | Kobo | Apple | Bookshop.org | Barnes & Noble | Chapters – !ndigo | Foyles\n\nDid you miss my latest release announcement?
