        "text": "Synopsis\n\nResearch grants on reducing inequality fund research studies that aim to build, test, or increase understanding of programs, policies, or practices to reduce inequality in the academic, social, behavioral, or economic outcomes of young people ages 5-25 in the United States. We prioritize studies that aim to reduce inequalities that exist along dimensions of race, ethnicity, economic standing, language minority status, or immigrant origins.\n\nBackground\n\nOur focus on reducing inequality grew out of our view that research can do more than help us understand the problem of inequality—it can generate effective responses. We believe that it is time to build stronger bodies of knowledge on how to reduce inequality in the United States and to move beyond the mounting research evidence about the scope, causes, and consequences of inequality.\n\nOur research interests center on studies that examine ways to reduce inequality in youth outcomes. We welcome descriptive studies that clarify mechanisms for reducing inequality or elucidate how or why a specific program, policy, or practice operates to reduce inequality. We also welcome intervention studies that examine attempts to reduce inequality. Finally, we welcome studies that improve the measurement of inequality in ways that can enhance the work of researchers, practitioners, or policymakers.\n\nWe invite studies from a range of disciplines, fields, and methods, and we encourage investigations into various youth-serving systems, including justice, housing, child welfare, mental health, and education.\n\nApplications for research grants on reducing inequality must:\n\nIdentify a specific inequality in youth outcomes.\n\nWe are especially interested in research to reduce inequality in academic, social, behavioral, or economic outcomes.\n\nShow that outcomes are unequal in a brief discussion of existing literature.\n\nHighlight the main explanations for the unequal outcomes that are relevant for your study.\n\nMake a convincing case for the dimension(s) of inequality the study will address.\n\nWe are especially interested in research to reduce inequality along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, economic standing, language minority status, or immigrant origin status.\n\nBe very specific in naming the groups on which the study will focus. Avoid vague terms such as “at-risk youth” or “vulnerable youth.”\n\nOffer a well-developed conceptualization of inequality. Avoid treating dimensions of inequality (e.g., race, economic standing) as variables without providing conceptual and/or theoretical insight into why and how the identified inequality exists.\n\nIf proposing research that focuses on a dimension other than race, ethnicity, economic standing, language minority status, or immigrant origins, make a compelling case for this focus. Please note that in addition to the dimensions listed above, we encourage research on reducing inequality for LGBTQ youth, particularly in intersection with at least one of the prioritized dimensions.\n\nArticulate how findings from your research will help build, test, or increase understanding of a program, policy, or practice to reduce the specific inequality that you have identified.\n\nDraw on extant theoretical and empirical literature to provide a rationale for why the specific programs, policies, or practices under study will equalize outcomes between groups or improve outcomes of a particular group. In other words, specify your theory of change.\n\nIdentify how the study will investigate this rationale to determine whether it holds up to empirical scrutiny.\n\nAll letters of inquiry are initially reviewed by internal staff with social science expertise. On occasion, internal reviewers will request more information from applicants or solicit expert opinions to better assess a project. In general, however, given the breadth of studies proposed in letters of inquiry, internal reviewers may lack deep knowledge of an applicant’s specific area of work, so avoid disciplinary jargon and use language appropriate for an educated lay audience.\n\nWe begin application reviews by looking at the importance of the research questions or hypotheses. Then we evaluate whether the proposed research designs and methods will provide strong empirical evidence on those questions."
