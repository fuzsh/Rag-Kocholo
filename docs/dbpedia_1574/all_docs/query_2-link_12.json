        "text": "\"I am blown away by Walter Scott’s Wendy.\" —Zadie Smith\n\n\"As well as being very funny and acute, Wendy, Master of Art is also weirdly touching. For all her faults, [Walter Scott's] heroine is intensely likable.\" —Rachel Cooke, The Guardian\n\n\"[In Wendy, Master of Art,] Scott manages a rare thing: the sharpness of his satire doesn’t preclude a realistic rendering of personhood, and the seeming flatness opens up, at every turn, to a depth of feeling…. His mastery of his characters’ faces and gestures is also wonderful, his line quick and sure and expressive.\"\n\n—The New Yorker\n\n\"I thought I regretted not going to art school until a friend introduced me to Walter Scott’s Wendy comic book series...

Wendy, Master of Art is a great pick for students, ex-students or anyone who likes to laugh.\"\n\n—Emma Levy, Shelf Awareness\n\n\"[Walter Scott is] a skillfully economic storyteller with a sharp wit, especially sending up academic art-speak.\"\n\n—Publishers Weekly, Starred Review\n\n\"Wendy’s personal life remains chaotic, hilarious, and relatable…\" —Quill & Quire\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nCBC Q interviews Walter Scott ahead of the latest Wendy release\n\nTen years ago, Walter Scott went to a hangover brunch where he drew a stick figure of a party girl vomiting.
