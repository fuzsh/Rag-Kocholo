However, these are not the only symptoms, because this disease has many faces. What symptoms may indicate depression? 🔎Loss of self-confidence and self-esteem, feeling of uselessness and excessive and unjustified guilt. 🔎Negative view of the future and pessimistic thinking. 🔎Decreased ability to concentrate, pay attention and remember. 🔎Loss of interest and pleasure in everyday activities. 🔎Deterioration of sleep quality - it often becomes very short and does not allow for rest. 🔎Loss of appetite, which may lead to weight loss. If you have been suffering from low mood for a long time, you no longer enjoy things that you used to enjoy, or you notice any of the above symptoms, consult a specialist or share your feelings with your loved ones. Remember that you are not alone. Depression is not a weakness, it is a disease that requires support. It's important that we start talking openly about depression and other mental health issues. Together we can counteract it and create a more empathetic and supportive environment. Let's take care of our mental health as much as we do our physical health. #MentalHealthWeek #LoveYourselfFirst #selfcare #WarsawDBSHub\n\nMental Health Awareness Month is upon us… What is Mental Health?
