        "text": "If we do not face and address racism, bias, and mistakes of our past, we are creating a generation of students who will not know reality. I cannot ignore facts from the past as a history teacher. If our politicians can look in the mirror and think ignoring the past is beneficial in respect to our country and citizens, then I encourage them to have a sit-down conversation with every teacher they represent in their state. History is not moving backward; it is moving forward.\n\nAs an educator, I believe I have an obligation to tell the whole truth about our country’s past and our present, and to also encourage students to think critically about the direction we should take as a nation.\n\nIn order to effectively evaluate and adequately understand our nation, we must study and reflect on our past with regards to indigenous peoples and people of color, as well as countries we have subjugated for our own benefit. Without introspection there is no truth and without truth we’ll learn HIStory — but we will never learn the whole story. I resolve to present the whole story so that my students can be equipped to right wrongs and to craft a more equitable, inclusive story and an equitable, inclusive world.\n\nI was taught a feel-good version of U.S. history in school and I remember the shock of learning about things like Japanese American Internment when I got to college. I was taught a Eurocentric version of World History that did not address cultures outside of Europe, especially Africa.\n\nAs a historian, my job is to look at the documents and interpret those documents based on corroboration of evidence across sources from multiple perspectives to arrive at an interpretation. Real history is messy and makes us uncomfortable at times. But it is through those experiences that we learn and grow in our understanding of the world as a complicated place. Students should learn the critical thinking skills that will allow them to be functioning members of society.\n\nAfter teaching about race, class, and gender in U.S. history, I watched my students grow angry that they were in the last years of their public education and no one had ever mentioned these topics.\n\nResearch has shown that students, who do not see their history in school, do not do as well as their peers.\n\nI have spent my entire professional career in public education and have earned four degrees related to public education (3 advanced – M.A., Ed.S., and Ed.D.). Before any lawmakers begin to draft policy related to public education, they actually need to take the time to LISTEN to public educators on the front lines to learn what is actually going on in public schools. They should take time to visit public schools to observe the great work teachers are doing rather than listening to one-sided (often extremist) propaganda full of fear tactics.\n\nI teach in Texas and the bill about to become law harms my students. I will continue to teach truth to power because my students deserve to see themselves in history, to know that their ancestors were overcomers, and that they MATTER! To the governor: Too late!\n\nMaybe the governor needs to visit my class to get an understanding of what real teaching looks like. Just in case anyone asks . . . I proudly teach at YWCPA, all day, every day! It is a very sad day in Texas when accurate authentic history is considered a threat to fragile feelings brought on by guilt and ignorance. As educators, we need to stay vigilant and be truth tellers.\n\nOur students deserve far more credit than legislation like this grants them. They are compassionate and they care about the experiences of those like and unlike them. They deserve to learn the truth — it is in fact their right — and it is our responsibility to teach it to them, regardless of how it makes us feel and our own personal political affiliation.\n\nNow, more than ever, educators must teach with their heads and their heart. This means we filter out the fringe, ignorant chatter that is attempting to intimidate us into teaching selective history. History is history — it happened. It was not always pretty, nor was it always kind.\n\nIt is incumbent upon us to teach the truth about our past, to help our students understand the context of our past, and think deeply about, and learn from our past. This is a critically important time for educators to teach truth, and do it thoughtfully, intelligently, and empathetically. It’s really not that hard, just use your head and your heart.\n\nTo teach less than the full truth about history — to omit facts and perspectives and legacies — is to teach lies, both lies of commission and lies of omission. Education must be the whole story — composed of the good and the bad and all the many shades of both in between. We must teach through an inclusive social justice lens if we are to right wrongs and provide a collective force to fulfill the great promise of this country.\n\nI tell my students we’re going to learn the full history of our country. We wouldn’t do a puzzle with just the pieces of a puzzle that appealed to us because we wouldn’t get the full picture, so we’re going to study all the stories from a multitude of perspectives so we can find the truth about who we are, and who we want to be.\n\nI am signing this pledge because I am deeply disturbed by both the attempted culture war and censorship being thrust upon schools and other organizations all across the nation. The teaching of truth to people of all ages is essential so we can examine our past and create a society focused on progress. Good teaching also means utilizing a rich landscape of stories and perspectives that are all around us and I refuse to bury that truth as it is shared with the world.\n\nTeaching the true history of the United States is critical. Our job as teachers isn’t to deposit information to our students — it isn’t about propaganda or creating a false narrative about how great this country is. Our job is to help students discover who they are and what they believe — and for that, they need to know the TRUE history of where we came from and how we got to where we are.\n\nThe truth matters and we owe it to not only the groups of people who have been oppressed for the entirety of U.S. history, but also to the future of our country to teach them our failures so that they can build a better future for our country.\n\nThis is not about guilt and shame, this is about justice and reconciliation for everyone. Reconciliation can only happen when the facts are given and dealt with.\n\nWe owe it to our country to acknowledge our history and work to not repeat it.\n\nI am signing this pledge because the recently proposed legislation to dictate to teachers is censorship and the whitewashing of U.S. history.\n\nIf our kids are going to be prepared for the challenges of their future, we as their teachers need to foster an honest representation of the past, while giving them the critical thinking skills and the empathy to treat all people with respect and understanding.\n\nThese proposed bills are indoctrination, whereas we teachers need to promote an inclusive history so young people can make informed decisions about their futures.\n\nI believe it is a moral imperative to teach the truth even when that truth may be difficult, uncomfortable, or challenge long-held myths about American exceptionalism.\n\nIf we lie (or leave out the truth) to young people growing up in our society, we do them a terrible disservice.\n\nReal care and respect for students and families begins with telling the truth, a basic value that we all seek to imbue in our children.\n\nThe language of these bills is absurdly vague and often inaccurate, and their intention violates every tenet of academic freedom that we should hold sacred.\n\nTeachers and those interested in education should stand tall and aver that we shall explore all aspects of the history of our country, not just those that serve an unquestioningly “patriotic” narrative. To do less does a disservice to our nation and to the ideals that we purportedly hold, and to the children whom we supposedly serve.\n\nCriticality does not equal hatred, but instead can lead us to understand ourselves and our history more deeply and thus to better serve and practice those aforementioned ideals.\n\nWe need to fight the New McCarthyism. “Conservative” is a euphemism for those who are trying to whitewash U.S. history.\n\nThey are not just conservatives, they are Orwellian propaganda agents dedicated to silencing the past in order to enable racist violence, class domination, and empire, and to preventing responsible responses to the climate and COVID emergencies.\n\nTheir agenda targets the most vulnerable and marginalized populations but it also harms the entire 99%, including the white working and professional classes and most of the people who self-identify as “conservative.”\n\nOur district has used books based in Critical Race Theory like Ibram X. Kendi’s How To Be Anti-Racist for student, staff, and parent book clubs, and implemented a race curriculum also based in CRT by Courageous Conversations.\n\nBut hypocritically they also respond to parent complaints regarding race curriculum by threatening to discipline teachers and implement stricter oversight of curriculum, even when the curriculum is strictly in line with the district’s courses of study.\n\nEducators need to be empowered, not disciplined or chilled, when they are on the front lines conducting these important conversations.\n\nOur students deserve to be taught the truth in American history.\n\nTeachers like myself also deserve the autonomy to teach all facets of the curriculum they are responsible for covering; that includes the parts of history that reactionaries, white supremacists, and politicians who pander & enable these people, want to gloss over and blot out in the history books.\n\nIt’s the teachers who are the professionals and know their content — not these noise-makers. Let’s keep #TeachingTruth as we always have!\n\nAs teachers, we are called to teach the truth and hiding history from our students means lying about our identity as Americans. Yes, our history is not pretty and we have had to take steps to become what we are today, but we, as teachers, are also lifelong learners who are called to shape the minds of the future. Lying to students means hiding the past and rewriting the history of this country.\n\nI want to be on the right side of history. Future generations will talk about this moment, the way legislators and extremist white supremacy groups used fear-mongering and conspiracy theories to stop teachers from teaching the truth.\n\nI want it to be known that I was one of countless educators nationwide who taught kids to identify, understand, and work to end racism, sexism, white supremacy culture, and the silencing of marginalized voices from our curricula. Teaching the truth does not mean teaching kids to hate America. It is teaching them that we all play a role in helping our country become a more perfect union.\n\nWhen our national story is devoid of truth, we are not giving students the tools and ancestral knowledge they need to make a better world possible. We are simply teaching them to adapt to the status quo. As an Asian student in a mostly white community, I had to seek Black, Indigenous, queer, and Asian perspectives on my own as an adult. I can only imagine who I’d be had I learned earlier, had I been taught narratives that allowed me to love myself. As educators, it’s our duty to prevent this cycle from perpetuating. Teach our true history.\n\nI did not learn about Vincent Chin’s murder until I was in my 30s, even though he was killed a half hour from my home when I was 6. I did not learn about white Detroiters attempting to lynch Dr. Ossian Sweet until I was in my 40s, although I was assigned To Kill a Mockingbird multiple times. I did not learn the racial history of my own state, including sundown towns and redlining and restrictive covenants, or why my hometown had no Black residents, until middle-age.\n\nMy students deserve better than I received — they deserve to know about their state and their community in age-appropriate ways, without huge important chunks of history being removed or sanitized to avoid hard conversations about race, privilege, power, and hatred. Kids see these things in their own lives and it is dishonest for adults to prevent them from having opportunities to learn and think and practice working through them. True and meaningful pride comes out of hard work.\n\nTo think children are not aware of the inequalities that exist in their everyday lives is ignorant and insulting.\n\nParents and educators have a duty to help them understand what they see, what they hear, and what they experience.\n\nHiding from the ugly truth does not make it go away but only serves to create a citizenry that is ill-equipped for fighting to change it.\n\nA calculated attempt to weaken the populace through misinformation and ignorance is in direct opposition of what a representative government should be and should not be tolerated.\n\nAm I supposed to teach The Crucible, yet not discuss McCarthy, the Red Scare, religious persecution, or slavery, which is an integral aspect of the play? Can I mention that Miller was blacklisted (a term that needs immediate revision) for refusing to speak in front of the HUAC? Can I even mention the HUAC??\n\nAnd Gatsby, another book in our school curriculum: Should I ignore the blatant anti-Semitic stereotyping of Meyer Wolfsheim and the derogatory language included, without reference to historical similarities? Do I disregard Tom Buchanan’s raging racist rants and chalk that up to the times, or do I get to explain that this was a prevalent attitude, and still is?\n\nIf I am fined $5,000 by the state of Arizona for teaching the truth, they’ll have to put me in jail to get me to pay it, and the state will lose one more of the hundreds and hundreds of teachers who have been leaving the field in the past few years.\n\nActually, let’s just give all of the students the material to read without any historical references or adult guidance. Apparently, my state is trying to make it clear that, if teachers are not allowed to teach, we are no longer even necessary.\n\nI will not whitewash our history. I will not allow the U.S. government to control our future generations’ thoughts and inhibit their ability to critically analyze OUR history.\n\nThe U.S. is an incredible nation, with a past built upon stolen land and the blood of enslaved peoples, a legacy that lives with us today.\n\nThe photo is of my mother and me. My mom was an educator for a couple of decades and she 100% agrees with our cause and my statements.\n\nI pledge to expose racist mythology in every corner of the curriculum. I pledge to help students identify and expose the racist policies that have led to the deplorable racial disparities in American society.\n\nIf our society is to have a more equitable 21st century, all U.S. Americans must be able to contextualize Black suffering and articulate the history of injustice. Much structural change and healing is needed. As history teachers, we have an immense responsibility to confront racism and call it what it is.\n\nI was raised to stand up to bullies. These pieces of legislation are attempts to bully teachers into inculcating a whitewashed view of our country and its past. There is a lot that is right with the United States, and there is a lot that is not. It is our responsibility to share all of that with our students, and to inspire them to embrace the good and change the bad, and the wisdom to tell the difference.\n\nMy students, despite facing racism and threats their entire lives, talk eloquently about their belief in the United States. They do this not in spite of my teaching them the awful and heartbreaking truths of our past, but because of it. Only these state legislatures appear to believe that racism and hate are so intrinsic to the U.S. that you cannot be a true American if you reject them. These legislators are telling on themselves.\n\nHistory is so important, but even more important is the ability to decipher the truth from nostalgia.\n\nMy students, mostly young men and women of color, need to know the true story of this country so they can find a way to live in it.\n\nThe side that is trying to eliminate the proper and truthful telling of history is only interested in maintaining power. Truth to power is real and I’ll fight for that and continue teaching my students (and my own children and anybody else that will listen) real history as I continue to learn it myself.\n\nI feel that my country lied to me when teachers did not disclose the true nature of our history. The history books I had as a student reflected only progress and power, without describing how my country became a power through slavery and other colonial acts.\n\nThe men we regard as heroes in our history books are often the ones who brought about the most destruction and pain to others. We owe our children the truth.\n\nStudents need to know historical truths, no matter how uncomfortable or ugly they are. Any attempts by state and national politicians to restrict, silence, or whitewash historical truths must be fought against and resisted — such as attacks on teaching the realities of Indigenous land theft and anti-Black politics that are deeply tangled up with the founding of the U.S.\n\nUntil we finally come to terms with the full extent of this history, the deeper social changes we need will remain out of reach. As an educator, I’m committed to doing my part to ensure students learn these hard historical truths.\n\nI will not be complicit in the effort to cover up the real history of this nation and the deleterious effects of that history on the peoples it oppresses.\n\nAs a teacher it is my duty to teach my students to think reflectively, critically, and creatively about all things. This is especially critical when it comes to the history and present state of the United States. I would be failing them if I did not teach them to ask questions, dig deeper, and uncover the things that we are not so proud of.\n\nA citizenry that cannot see the defects of its nation is helpless in making it a better place for all. We must move forward to build a more perfect union even if it is uncomfortable, embarrassing, and challenging. As with all of life, change can be painful, but it is necessary for progress.\n\nTeachers are meant to teach, and there is no knowledge without honesty, so I will teach with honesty and hope for a better future for my students and my country.\n\nI never learned about Japanese American internment camps in high school even though I live 2 hours from Minidoka.\n\nJapanese internment camps are finally in our standards and my students learned about it this year. They appreciate not being lied to, and like me, they know when they have been deceived. We will not go back. I will not lie to my students. I will continue to teach the truth.\n\nI know how conservative media describes the work we are doing as something negative and something to be feared, causing confusion to the public, including teachers as to what should and should not be taught in the classroom. However, education is not about telling students what to think, it’s helping them develop the skills on how to think critically about the world around them, enhancing their curiosity.\n\nThe only way to help students understand the present world is to gain a more accurate understanding of our past. We should ask what stories are missing and why. Who had a voice and who did not? Who did the voices from the past benefit? Who was harmed? The first step in the problem solving process is to define the problem. If you cannot accurately define the problem, then the solutions proposed will not work.\n\nThis laughable attempt to censor knowledge cannot stand. I refuse to sit idly by while the world of alternative facts tries to change reality.\n\nSeeing my students parrot the pledge of allegiance out of a compulsory sense of community, hearing the words “and justice and liberty *for all*” ring so, so hollow . . . to see people putting blinders on with such determination is very problematic, not to mention childish. I encourage all of my fellow educators to read Charles Bukowski’s letter on censorship.\n\nI am concerned that my state’s recent legislation will stifle my ability to teach students about how they fit into our histories and why they fit where they fit in society today.\n\nBeing white is not mutually exclusive to the goals of contextually teaching the reality of various American histories and the roles of various groups within that history. Young people understand this, and it is our job to be both thoughtful and critical when we have discussions about race, gender, class and other methods of social classification.\n\nHaving the state of Florida legislate teaching by eradicating the voices of minorities is scary, and while it might just be happening in the social sciences today, the path is now open for this kind of regulation to happen in all disciplines.\n\nWe must create the opportunity and structure for our students to become critical thinkers. We absolutely have to provide them with a variety of viewpoints and experiences from our storied past. Only with this added perspective do we truly have a chance to continue to build to a more perfect and inclusive ideal.\n\nHow can we truly solve a problem without looking at all the factors in a critical way? We need to build a shared lexicon that allows for thoughtful and nuanced discussions on how to mitigate our past and the best way to build our future.\n\nHiding the truth from children will not make them responsible, critical-thinking adults. Teaching a variety of perspectives is necessary for students to take in the entire picture of events and make decisions based on all the information available with consideration for all stakeholders involved.\n\nGive students the truth and teach them to think critically about their history and the world.\n\nI believe our children have a right to know the truth, no matter how painful or messed up it was. We can’t teach them so young not to lie and then turn around and do the very opposite.\n\nIf those who are trying to omit the truth believe it was right, then why not embrace it? Allow generations after us to know what happened. It can bring about positive change in this country and also the world.\n\nI am a teacher, but specifically I am a teacher to incredible immigrants to our country. All of my students’ first language is Spanish and/or Indigenous. They deserve to know our history, especially as it pertains to their rights and their peers’ rights. We cannot mask the truth. We must face it head on and discuss it as individuals and a community.\n\nThe history of BIPOC isn’t just their history, it’s OUR history!\n\nOften, the contributions of BIPOC are overlooked, not shared, downplayed, or wrongly attributed, sometimes on purpose, to white people. Not only is it wrong and unjust, but doing this takes away role models for our students who are BIPOC. It also doesn’t allow white students to likewise see the valuable contributions people who aren’t like them have made."
