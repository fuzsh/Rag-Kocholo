Here, you’ll find bite-sized, thoughtful considerations of different books that hold interest for those in the field of ELA teacher education.\n\nSince English Education does not accept unsolicited reviews, please complete the journal’s interest form or contact Melanie Shoffner, editor, at shoffnme@jmu.edu, if you are interested in writing a review or extending the conversation on a published review.\n\n__________\n\nJuly 2024\n\n__________\n\nDisability Representation in Young Adult Narratives\n\nMadeline P. Boehning\n\nRowan University\n\nBook review of Meyer, A. E. (2022). From wallflowers to bulletproof families: The power of disability in young adult narratives. University Press of Mississippi.\n\nAbbye E. Meyer’s (2022) book From Wallflowers to Bulletproof Families: The Power of Disability in Young Adult Narratives is timely amidst the mental health crisis among teens and the recent uptick in young adult (YA) novels featuring characters with mental health needs and various disabilities. In this context, educators may be eager to incorporate disability-inclusive novels into lessons. Before selecting materials, I recommend reading Meyer’s book, which presents important considerations for shifting perspectives on disability and the disability-inclusive book selection process.\n\nMeyer, an assistant professor of children’s literature, argues that disability representation in modern YA narratives has “unimaginable potential” (p. 154) to disrupt dominant narratives about disability and adolescence. She explores the complex parallels between disability and adolescence in YA literature, arguing that the two are inextricably linked as “othered” identities that need to change to fit into the world. Through the book, Meyer contributes to academic literary discussions and provides critical insight into how English teachers and teacher educators can approach discussions of disability representation, building on the work of scholars such as Patricia A. Dunn, Lennard J. Davis, and Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, who have written about disability representation in literature and media.\n\nIn a deep dive into the problematic history of disability tropes, Meyer draws critically on classic and contemporary works, beginning with Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye and Plath’s The Bell Jar. Meyer then turns to YA novels to illustrate common literary tropes, such as the archetype of the mentally ill teenager. She presents a comparative analysis of problem novels that “give more attention to lessons than to stories, characters, or other literary complexities” (p. 11) and furthers a convincing argument in favor of works such as Accidents of Nature, a semi-autobiographical novel by Harriet McBryde Johnson, that present disability as a political identity and inspiring activism.\n\nI appreciate Meyer’s critical analysis of contemporary YA narratives’ disability representations found in other media (e.g., television, social media). She includes reviews written by people with disabilities regarding their opinions on specific works—for example, positive reviews of Speechless, a TV series featuring a teenage boy with cerebral palsy and his siblings facing authentic teenage struggles. Meyer suggests that YA fiction and nonfiction narratives found in other media (e.g., songs, television, social media) offer more accurate, nuanced expressions of disability experiences. As a collective, Meyer claims, these authentic narratives unite and strengthen disability communities that include people with disabilities, allies, and families; they are “radically different from in-print novels” (p. 15) in that they disrupt deficit-based narratives of disability and encourage disability activism.\n\nMeyer’s inclusion of the voices of disabled media reviewers comes toward the end of the book and is a strength, and I would have appreciated more disabled perspectives in the initial chapters. Furthermore, doing so aligns with the American Educational Research Association’s 2023 Disability Studies in Education tenets that advocate for centering authentic disabled perspectives. Disability community members and their allies advocate for the amplification of authentic disabled stories. Consistent with this perspective, Meyer favors stories created by authors who are transparent about their own experience of disability or close connection to disability.\n\nAs an English teacher who believes that all students have something wonderful to offer the world, I appreciate Meyer’s strengths-based view of difference and disability. For other educators interested in shifting toward a strengths-based view of disability, this book will support that goal. Readers are also likely to discover multiple works they might like to explore themselves or with students. I gained a disability-inclusive perspective on several YA novels I have previously read with middle and high school students. Meyer convinced me to approach these novel studies with a critical perspective. I also added several titles to my to-read list. I cannot wait to explore these works with students as we disrupt the all-too-common deficit-based stories of disability and adolescence together.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nMadeline P.

E. (2023). Workshopping the canon for democracy and justice. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nIn Workshopping the Canon for Democracy and Justice, Mary E. Styslinger applies workshop structures to help middle and secondary English language arts teachers effectively teach ELA content and skills through a lens of democracy and justice. This book builds on her Workshopping the Canon (2017) by emphasizing the connection between traditional texts and contemporary global issues. Styslinger’s catalyst for reimaging her work was to provide teachers with tangible ways to address issues of social justice in their classrooms, especially since, “too often, social justice is an espoused idea with little practical application” (p. xii).\n\nStyslinger provides a practical and accessible text with an abundance of valuable resources for readers. The book is composed of eight short chapters, along with five appendixes that provide further resources and support. The chapters define concepts in clear language and offer concrete understandings by including images of handouts and samples of student work, questions to ask, and examples from Styslinger’s classroom. The texts referenced throughout the book are engaging and relevant for capturing the attention of secondary students; as one example, teachers might use an episode of Netflix’s Black Mirror to teach literary theory. Any teacher picking up this text could easily implement the book’s strategies in their classroom the very next day.\n\nOver the course of the text, Styslinger makes a clear case for workshopping as a way to foster democracy and justice. Each chapter highlights pedagogical practices that teachers can use to create authentic opportunities for reading, writing, discourse, and advocacy in order to help students develop awareness and consciousness. For example, in Chapter 2, Styslinger argues that, in order to plan for democracy and justice, teachers must start by examining what they teach and taking a purposeful approach to selecting class texts. She stresses the importance of choosing topics, themes, and texts that provide space for students to identify, understand, and question systems of power, privilege, and oppression in society.\n\nChapter 6 highlights book clubs and Socratic seminars to promote student discourse. Styslinger asserts that providing opportunities for students to engage in discussion is an effective way to foster justice-mindedness because “talk prompted by text is invaluable to students’ civic education as they hear different opinions and perspectives” (p. 82). In Chapter 7, she suggests that teachers challenge the dominant discourse of traditional modes of writing (e.g., the five-paragraph essay) by allowing students to craft multigenre or multimodal compositions. Additionally, the chapter suggests publishing student work as part of the writing process because a democratic and justice-oriented classroom encourages students to write for real audiences. These examples and the other ideas found throughout the book provide an actionable guide for teachers looking to teach for change.\n\nThis updated edition reflects the call in the NCTE Standards for the Initial Preparation of Teachers of English Language Arts 7–12 (2021) to view the teaching of ELA through an antiracist/antibias lens. As teacher educators and teachers work toward creating antiracist and antibias classrooms, they can benefit from Styslinger’s classroom examples of how she has incorporated workshops in relation to potentially challenging topics (e.g., Black Lives Matter). Styslinger positions the workshop strategy as an opportunity for critical discourse and reflection.\n\nIn my secondary English methods course, I recently used the first chapter of Workshopping the Canon for Democracy and Justice to provide a clear and concise understanding of reading and writing workshops; I also used the detailed appendixes as a resource for how to pair canonical and contemporary texts as my students develop unit plans. In the future, I plan to assign Chapter 8, focused on supporting student inquiry and agency, to offer my preservice teachers actionable steps to plan for and promote student advocacy in their classrooms. In such ways, this book would be a valuable addition to all English educators’ professional libraries.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nLaura Jacobs is an assistant professor of English education at Towson University.

J., Griffin, A. A., & Thomas, E. E. (2023). Restorying young adult literature: Expanding students’ perspectives with digital texts. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nIn Restorying Young Adult Literature: Expanding Students’ Perspectives with Digital Texts, Drs. James Joshua Coleman, Autumn A. Griffin, and Ebony Elizabeth Thomas argue that the literature our students need to read and know how to read now exists not just in physical texts but in a vast digital universe. There is an urgency in the work being done in our English classrooms: Our digital-native students are already participating in new forms of literacy, and teachers need to utilize these texts in order to engage in equitable and justice-oriented teaching.\n\nThis book is grounded in the concept of “restorying,” which, as described by the authors, is a way to analyze stories, make meaning, and expand the limits of what we think of as literature. In the introduction, the authors explain a restorying framework first introduced by Thomas and Stornaiuolo (2016) which “involves altering six elements of narrative through acts of reading, writing, and imagining, and in doing so, teachers and students can craft new, more just narratives in their classrooms” (p. 2).\n\nThe six elements of restorying are identity, place, mode, perseverance, metanarrative, and time. For each of these, the authors provide suggestions and ideas. For example, a restorying of place might be a piece of fan fiction that puts “Superman in a Star Trek world” (p. 3), while a restorying of time could transport Romeo and Juliet to the modern world. This framework and the suggestions for the six forms of restorying provide an easily adaptable foundation for teachers who are new to restorying and want to try out different types with their students.\n\nThe first half of Restorying Young Adult Literature focuses on the people involved in the restorying process, and a wide variety of voices are given space to illustrate this work in action. For instance, Coyote Shook, a nonbinary educator, shares a yearlong curriculum map for speculative fiction that teachers can use in its entirety or in pieces to inspire their current units. The curriculum consists of four units, beginning with “What is speculative fiction?” and ending with “Toward intersectionality.” For each of the four units, Shook provides core texts, summative assessment ideas, and essential questions, as well as ideas and suggestions for classroom implementation.\n\nIn Chapter 3 of Restorying, Latrice Ferguson, a doctoral student, describes possible partnerships between classroom teachers and librarians: inviting librarians to give book talks, collaborating on digital storytelling, using digital tools to respond creatively to literature, and asking librarians to provide explicit teaching on navigating and identifying the veracity of digital sources. Chapter 3 ends with Cecily Lewis, the creator of the #ReadWoke hashtag, explaining what the #ReadWoke movement can look like in the classroom. Lewis also provides access to a Google Drive full of instructional resources, including Read Woke Bingo, Read Woke Activities and Lessons, and Read Woke Book Tasting that teachers can easily access and use today.\n\nIn the second half of the book, the authors move from the people to the texts themselves. Topics range from considering how race affects classroom text selection to promoting and giving space for students to engage in “identity-bending” in their own writing responses and analyses of texts and characters. The authors also address ideas for utilizing digital platforms such as YouTube and Canva in creative ways.\n\nRestorying Young Adult Literature ends by asking classroom English teachers to continue the journey of exploring digital worlds and digital texts. As the authors write in their conclusion, whether we want change or not, digital forms of literature “will continue to shift, morph, and develop” (p. 93). By utilizing the concrete tools and methods given throughout the book, readers should have a firm foundation on which to start, continue, and sustain this important work in their own classrooms.\n\nReference\n\nThomas, E.

(2022). Expanding literacy: Bringing digital storytelling into your classroom. Heinemann.\n\nGiven how quickly the nature of writing is changing, Brett Pierce’s (2022) book Expanding Literacy: Bringing Digital Storytelling into Your Classroom arrives at a crucial juncture to alleviate fears, provide guidance, and offer a vision for what can be possible in our classrooms. This conversational and practical text is singular in its ambition: to help upper elementary and secondary teachers see the purpose and value of digital storytelling. All teachers who are looking to leverage the way mobile technology is reprogramming how we tell and consume stories will get something valuable from this book. Specifically, early career teachers will appreciate the abundance of project examples and the thorough look at assessment strategies. Pierce makes the pathway toward digital storytelling clear, paved, and navigable.\n\nThe book is divided into four sections: skills, process, story, and practice. In the first section, devoted to skills, Pierce unpacks an uncomfortable truth with which many teachers are well acquainted: we are attempting to prepare young people for a future in a constant state of flux. In response, Pierce makes a case for teaching human skills that are about “training the mind to take calculated risks, look for patterns, and transpose failure into opportunity. They are about listening, delegating, empathizing, and imagining” (p. 30). Digital storytelling is a unique way to develop these human skills because, as a curricular tool, it is collaborative, requires creativity, invites critical thinking, and requires ample research.\n\nThe next section speaks to the tension between outcomes (test scores, for example) and a process approach to learning. Many educators’ angst over the advent of ChatGPT seems to relate to outcomes, such as the possibility that students can dishonestly represent their learning by generating writing through AI. While this book was written before ChatGPT3 was available to the public, Pierce’s call to consider more process-based experiences in the classroom to support students’ knowledge generation will likely resonate with educators. In the next section—story—Pierce explores the power and purpose of storytelling and, conversely, how it is ignored as a skill beyond elementary education. He concludes the arc of the text with a deep dive into the practicalities of how these concepts could translate into a classroom.\n\nWhile Pierce is a seasoned media professional with years of working at Sesame Workshop, he leans on his classroom teaching experience—as well as voices from students and teachers—to provide a guide to envisioning the how of digital storytelling. One example is a “horrific challenge” (p. 125) involving Edgar Allan Poe, where students begin by exploring the style of Poe’s storytelling, including a careful reading and close analysis of various literary elements. Then students film a two- to four-minute horror scene with an explanation of the elements that were borrowed from Poe’ style.\n\nTo Pierce’s credit, he acknowledges that transitioning from a more traditional learning model will be a stretch for some. He addresses this reality with gentle reminders throughout the book: digital storytelling is “75 percent about process” (p. 55); teachers do not need to be the expert on the tools or platforms; having a clear project plan can bolster confidence. Pierce does not claim that the road maps he provides will cure the inevitable messiness of process-based digital storytelling, but his optimistic and resourced approach will likely alleviate some readers’ anxiety.\n\nSince anyone can produce media, Pierce argues, there is now an imperative to establish meaningful, coherent storytelling as a standard practice that needs to happen in schools. He strengthens his argument by outlining how digital storytelling addresses issues of equity by allowing for multiple pathways to effective communication, curricular engagement, and young people’s sharing of their voices. Pierce’s book gives a clear rationale for why digital storytelling plays a significant role in the lives of our students, as well as how to both elevate and amplify the necessity for digital literacy in the classroom.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\nCeleste Kirsh is a PhD candidate in the curriculum and pedagogy program at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (University of Toronto) and the host and producer of the Teaching Tomorrow podcast.

(2022). Igniting social action in the ELA classroom: Inquiry as disruption. Teachers College Press.\n\nRobyn Seglem and Sarah Bonner’s Igniting Social Action in the ELA Classroom: Inquiry as Disruption (2022) is an English teacher’s guidebook to designing a learning environment that invites students to think outward, inward, and forward. This work counters standardized, teacher-centered, and performance-oriented classroom practices by advocating for student-centered inquiry and social action in the ELA classroom. A blend of the authors’ firsthand experiences, the work of educational theorists, and reflection questions, this book is divided into three parts, with each part highlighting approaches intended to help students see the world as big, as small, and as a whole.\n\nPart I looks outward at the overarching systems shaping our lives and the lives of others. Noting that there is no such thing as a single story, the text suggests helping students critically examine culture and social forces by exploring the complexities of their own identities and experiences as well as exposing students to perspectives outside their own. This section demonstrates that by encouraging students to ask questions, we “inspire children to think creatively and to see the world in unique ways. And when we take away their questions, we take away their love for learning” (p. 33). To model how to encourage students to ask these questions, the text describes About Me (p. 12) projects that invite students to investigate the complexities of their own story, identity, and experience. Here we see how disruptive inquiry helps students develop the ability to explore their curiosities, examine alternative perspectives, and begin drawing connections between real-world experiences and the systems that shape them.\n\nPart II asks readers to think about the details of our world to explore the underlying intent of the messages we consume and perpetuate. This section prompts educators to help students approach media and other texts with healthy skepticism, deconstruct these texts, examine the experiences of marginalized individuals, and invite the community into the classroom. One notable activity, Deconstructing the Familiar (p. 48), asks students to analyze, question, and trouble forms of media they regularly consume. By encouraging students to practice a healthy skepticism of media, we can “push our students out of a passive role as [a] reader into an active role that requires them to consider others’ stories, as well as how they will choose to see these stories” (p. 46). This section advocates for more voices in the classroom, dismantles dynamics that position teachers as the ultimate knowledge holders, and gives students the autonomy to lead their own inquiry.\n\nPart III focuses on “bring[ing] all this work together so that we can use the information we have gathered to help students see it all and move past just the study of literature” (p. 79, emphasis in original). The authors cite Wesch’s (2018) concept of the anthropologist tool kit to argue that inquiry can lead to action when guided by communication, empathy, and thoughtfulness. To this end, this section details activities such as the Genius Hour, which encourages students to examine familiarities in a different light, design human-centered solutions to communal issues, and use their voices and abilities to work toward change.\n\nIgniting Social Action in the ELA Classroom helps educators consider how they can bring disruptive inquiry into their classroom practices. As a community educator and future teacher educator, I see this book as a valuable resource offering ways to engage student inquiry in and out of the classroom for both practicing and preservice teachers. Seglem and Bonner’s work provides readers with concrete ideas, activities, and resources they can adopt in their classrooms to promote student agency. I highly recommend this book for any educator who wants to make space for students to ask questions, understand different perspectives, and take risks in the classroom.\n\nReference\n\nWesch, M.

(2022). Challenging traditional classroom spaces with YA literature: Students in community as course co-designers. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nEngaging students in meaningful reading is every English teacher’s goal, but we often find that, no matter what instructional strategies we try, our students are still not excited to read. In Challenging Traditional Classroom Spaces with YA Literature, Ricki Ginsberg suggests that it is not just the strategies we use to teach literature but the literature itself that needs to change in English classrooms.\n\nThis book is useful for both preservice teachers and current educators as it demonstrates how to infuse young adult texts into classroom practice, develop YA courses, and challenge students to take ownership of their learning. As Ginsberg explains, students need to enjoy what they read in order to fully engage in learning, but, since they struggle to connect to “classic” literature, it is an ineffective learning tool: “Classic texts are not typically relevant or engaging for our students, which is not surprising since they were never intended to be read and appreciated by teens. In other words, we are teaching texts that weren’t written for our students” (p. 2). This text demonstrates that teaching with YA literature can address this problem.\n\nGinsberg suggests that, in addition to changing what we read in the classroom, we also develop communities of practice to change how we approach student choice. Communities of practice bring students together through common areas of study, or domains. This approach puts students in the driver’s seat, allowing them to choose what areas they study, what novels they read, and how they demonstrate their understanding of class material. Although this may seem daunting, the book includes guidelines for creating norms, defining community roles, and choosing domains of study. Ginsberg extends student choice by suggesting that students engage in meaningful assessments, such as writing to school board members, creating podcasts, and developing community reading programs.\n\nHalfway through my reading, I became somewhat deflated. As an educator in a district that emphasizes standards and approved curriculum, I felt like I could never create the classroom described in this book. Just as I was ready to give up on the practicality of these ideas, Ginsberg described ways to infuse YA literature into established curricula. Many of these suggestions are simple practices, such as read-alouds, independent reading time, and pairing a classic text (e.g., To Kill a Mockingbird) with a more modern text (e.g., The Hate U Give). However, the book transforms these methods into meaningful learning moments by asking students to brainstorm book titles and possible projects to explore learning domains. Ginsberg also provides detailed guidelines for developing stand-alone YA literature courses that teacher educators can utilize to teach course design and development. Preservice teachers can then learn how to develop a diverse classroom library, create a course proposal, and work through the course approval process.\n\nGinsberg closes the text by encouraging educators to cultivate exciting literary lives of their own. The book provides resources for exploring the publishing industry and literary awards, and it encourages us to keep up with the latest releases to understand students’ tastes. She reminds us that enthusiasm and interest are catching and that educators “must be active readers who are able to contribute to the communities of practice we forge in our classrooms” (p. 115).\n\nChallenging Traditional Classroom Spaces with YA Literature guides educators to engage students in the classroom and help them become lifelong readers. This book offers solutions to get students interested in reading, frameworks to create space for student choice in the classroom, and ways to encourage students to become independent readers. Though educators at all levels will take new ideas away from this text, it is particularly helpful for preservice teachers because it provides concrete methods to bring these approaches into any classroom they may enter in the future.\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nKathryn Milschewski is a seventh-grade English teacher in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

S., & Kruger-Ross, M. J. (2022). Reimagining literacies in the digital age: Multimodal strategies to teach with technology. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nReimagining Literacies in the Digital Age by Pauline S. Schmidt and Matthew J. Kruger-Ross (2022) seeks to help ELA teacher educators incorporate multimodal texts and digital literacies into their courses. Schmidt and Kruger-Ross are in the unique position of having co-taught courses focused on educational technology in ELA; this book draws on their expertise. Written during the COVID-19 pandemic, the book is a timely and accessible exploration of the nexus of literacies and technologies impacting ELA education today.\n\nFor me as a former ELA teacher now teaching in an initial licensure program, this text spoke to needs that have emerged in my practice. When I taught high school ELA in under-resourced schools, my students and I had minimal access to technology. My approach to technology was to “figure it out,” accessing whatever technologies were available and using trial and (lots of) error to find approaches that worked. I know my students would have benefited from learning digital literacies in more formal ways, which is one of many reasons I’m excited to draw from this text in my work with preservice teachers. Reimagining Literacies in the Digital Age met me at this point in my journey and opened my eyes to exciting and accessible ways to expand the role of technology in my work.\n\nOne especially welcome tool I’ve taken from this book is the “four I multimodal strategy (FIMS)” (p. 7) to help educators understand the complexities involved in consuming and producing multimodal texts. Schmidt and Kruger-Ross argue that the four Is—identifying, considering the impact and influence of, and imagining the opportunities unleashed by multimodal texts—can empower both teachers and students to harness the potential of digital literacies. FIMS is woven throughout the text, applied to preservice teachers’ coursework and inservice classroom settings alike.\n\nThe structure of the text helps readers dig into different realms of literacy. The book is divided into three sections focusing on different kinds of texts: visual, aural, and multimodal. Each section features a theoretical chapter framing core considerations about its particular form of literacy, followed by two chapters describing examples that demonstrate how to think about consuming and producing such texts. This structure helped me anchor theoretical concepts in material practice through concrete examples. For example, theoretical discussion of aural literacies came to life in the chapter examining podcast creation. Though I’ve used podcasting in my teaching, I left this chapter with a deeper understanding of the potential of this form of literacy for teaching.\n\nReimagining Literacies in the Digital Age is also a multimedia text. QR codes linking to multimedia resources pepper the pages, enabling readers to explore the book’s concepts in ways rarely afforded in academic reading. Resources linked in the text, such as episodes recorded by the authors for the What’s Going On in This Picture? podcast of the New York Times, and examples of student work from the authors’ courses, have encouraged me to read and reread as new concepts become salient.\n\nOne limitation of this text is that the unique co-teaching relationship and hybrid class format Schmidt and Kruger-Ross draw from mean their insights may not be easily translated into traditional compartmentalized initial licensure programs. The program I teach in, for example, has English education preservice teachers learning about educational technology from a team that doesn’t work closely or co-teach with ELA methods instructors. Resources to help bridge such gaps would have been welcome additions. I also found myself wishing for a student-facing reading list that I could draw from to infuse digital literacies more meaningfully into my reading-focused courses.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this text to educators working with preservice ELA teachers, especially those looking to update their thinking about digital literacies and educational technology. Reimagining Literacies in the Digital Age is already helping me reshape the courses I teach, and I’m excited to bring these insights to my teaching for years to come.\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nAnna McNulty Taylor (she/her/hers) is a PhD candidate in literacy education in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Minnesota.

(2022). Increase reading volume: Practical strategies that boost students’ achievement and passion for reading. National Council for Teachers of English.\n\nIn Increase Reading Volume: Practical Strategies That Boost Students’ Achievement and Passion for Reading, Laura Robb addresses a known problem in education: “whether you teach English in middle or high school and have a required curriculum to deliver, the reality you face is that not all students in your class can read and comprehend these texts” (p. 99). Though Robb acknowledges that developing reluctant students into faithful readers is difficult, this book demonstrates how practical approaches along with “patience and time can change the reading attitudes of students” (p. 35).\n\nWhile contemporary K–12 reading comprehension and fluency education continue to focus on assessing skills, Robb cultivates an approach centered on emotional and intellectual engagement (p. 4), reasoning that common approaches to “remedial” reading programs with “skill and drill worksheets and reading cards with short text and five multiple-choice questions” (p. 1) do not work. Instead, this book encourages teachers to utilize informal book shares, peer book conferences, and book talks. These methods work toward the goal of developing lifelong readers simply for the love of reading. Furthermore, Robb’s list of “Ten Ways Students Benefit from Independent Reading” does not mention specific standards at all; instead, she cites empathy, imagination, passion, and enjoyment as the benefits of reading. While this book does offer methods for instruction and assessment, what makes it so refreshing is how trust, communication, and the joy of reading center all of its practices.\n\nSince each chapter highlights counter-approaches to common instructional practices, Increase Reading Volume is an important read for preservice teachers (PSTs). Robb argues educators should disrupt “the status quo in education . . . by creating a curriculum that offers students diverse texts and materials” (p. 17). In Chapter 2, she offers guiding questions in support of selecting equitable texts that could lead PSTs to consequential discussions about their curriculum choices. PSTs could readily incorporate the strategies, journal prompts, and structures offered in Chapters 3 and 6 into their practice. For example, each of the “Open-Ended Prompts” connects students’ lives with their texts (pp. 106–107). Sample class schedules in Chapter 4 could also serve PSTs as they begin to navigate the challenge of scheduling classes.\n\nIncrease Reading Volume is also a treasure trove of resources for educators, instructional coaches, and principals who want to build a culture of literacy in their schools. Although the book is most applicable to the intermediate and middle grades, its model unit on The Pearl by John Steinbeck—along with other core and contemporary text units highlighting works such as Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed and Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson—demonstrate that its methods can work in high school settings as well.\n\nEven though this book is full of practical strategies, some methods may not be applicable in all settings. For example, while classroom libraries, the cornerstone of the book, are fantastic resources, not all teachers have the means to build large classroom libraries. In addition, Robb’s suggestion that teachers need not preread all of the books in their units may be undermined by the current political climate. New laws—such as HB1467 in Florida requiring instructional texts to be available for parental review and prior approval by media specialists—are likely to have a chilling effect on incorporating unread contemporary texts.\n\nThis book’s main strengths lie in its practical applicability and its contagious passion for creating readers. As Robb reminds her audience, “your enthusiasm for and engagement in reading can rub off on students as they choose books” (p. 14), and the book’s enthusiasm for reading can do the same for its audience. As an ELA teacher who has felt dismayed by the gravitation toward computer-based instruction, online pathways, and excerpt-only literacy instruction, I found this book to be helpful and refreshing. Increase Reading Volume is a necessary demonstration of how educators can incorporate student choice, independent reading, and both classic and contemporary texts into their classrooms.\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nZachary Milford is a doctoral student in curriculum leadership at Eastern Kentucky University.

(2022). Facilitating youth-led book clubs as transformative and inclusive spaces. Teachers College Press.\n\nJody Polleck opens Facilitating Youth-Led Book Clubs by reflecting on an early book club experience at her New York City high school with five young women of color. For this meeting, Polleck chose a chapter from the “outdated” (p. 1) book Tiger Eyes by Judy Blume to share how her initial reading experience of this book helped her deal with death and trauma growing up. She did not expect the girls to show interest in the text or share their personal experiences with death in response to it; when they did, Polleck questioned whether she was “prepared to have these conversations with youth” (p. 3). Inspired to learn more about how “to provide inclusive and transformative forums where we can address students’ academic and social-emotional development” (p. 3), Polleck offers a fresh perspective on how educators can best serve students by creating book clubs as inclusive spaces organized around responsive practices and joy.\n\nThis book provides practical ways teacher educators and preservice teachers can establish student-centered book clubs in classrooms, as an extracurricular activity, or as support for young people in the larger community. Throughout the book, Polleck illustrates how book clubs can cultivate joy and fun by including examples of young people seeing book clubs as “a space for healing” (p. 13), students excitedly choosing texts according to their interests, and students creating their own norms and prioritizing “fun” in their reading.\n\nThe text juxtaposes the experience of the book club with examples of how to organize clubs through guided discussions and assessments that help students respond to texts. Each chapter ends with a “Take Action Now!” section that offers concrete ways for educators to put the book’s models into action in the classroom. Polleck makes implementation even easier with solid and clear explanations, examples, resources, and QR codes that take readers to a webpage with supplemental material. Since the book is organized in a way that invites readers to revisit the text, it serves as an excellent touchstone for preservice teachers and teacher educators alike, one they can return to when they need to refresh classroom reading practices. Based on my time as a high school English teacher, I appreciate how easily these techniques and ideas can be adapted: from implementing station rotations to thinking more intentionally about choosing novels to helping students approach choice in their reading.\n\nThe text offers several positive contributions to conversations on book club design and facilitation, such as its model of intentionality, explanations of how authorial position influences and affects a work, and clear outlines for applying the many aspects of this approach. However, the text also has a few drawbacks, especially concerning language use. For instance, the book reproduces harmful language about autism in a quote from a participant (p. 56). Polleck’s attempt to introduce new teachers to different critical lenses misrepresents multiple lenses by lumping them together under the label of CRT: “feminism, Lat Crit (Latinx Critical Race Theory, CRT), Asian American CRT, Tribal CRT, DisCrit and ableism, intersectionality, Marxism, and queer theories” (p. 126). This conflation replicates recent misreadings of these lenses touted by opponents of the teaching of intersectionality and diversity. Applying a feminist or queer critical lens or teaching intersectionality is not the same as teaching critical race theory, and in these troubled times, it is dangerous to equate these branches of interpretation.\n\nStill, Facilitating Youth-Led Book Clubs is an excellent resource for ELA educators at all levels because it offers a valuable foundation for those who want to form book clubs. Moreover, the book’s attention to the personal connections we make with texts—and with students through these texts—provides an excellent reminder for educators to revisit our practice through renewed eyes, encouraging us to remember the joy of classroom reading.\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nKarrȧ Shimabukuro joined NCTE in 2016 and has been an English teacher for 22 years.

(2022). Teaching literacy in troubled times: Identity, inquiry, and social action at the heart of instruction. Corwin Press.\n\nThe last few years have laid bare the critical need for school experiences that help students develop the ability to conduct careful research on questions of sociopolitical significance; to have respectful conversations across differences of opinion, experience, and identity; and to develop strategic, collaborative plans for action. At the same time, standardized testing and curriculum continue to make teaching to these needs challenging, if not impossible.\n\nTeaching Literacy in Troubled Times by Allison Skerrett and Peter Smagorinsky offers thoughtful and practical guidance for educators who are up for this challenge. With chapters on identity, critical inquiry, social change advocacy, empathy and understanding, racial literacy, and disputed terms, this book’s focus is education for civic responsibility and the development of an informed and engaged populace. It aims to support the development of teachers and students who are equipped to consistently practice “inquiry and investigation and insights” (p. 4) in the world as it is and as it might become.\n\nEach of the book’s six chapters first describes and defines a theme relevant to our current sociopolitical context before outlining methods for how teachers might teach the chapter’s theme in the classroom. These descriptions are followed by “in practice” sections that show how teachers around the country have used these methods in their classrooms. For these sections, the authors shared an early draft of each chapter with a classroom teacher, who then developed a unit using the chapter. One thing I noticed throughout the book is that each chapter speaks to the others, creating an organic whole that offers an overarching orientation to teaching and learning with justice, critical inquiry, and concrete action at its core.\n\nEach chapter offers guiding questions, class activities and assignments, and assessments. Regarding the last of these, I appreciate the recognition in Chapter 2 that “many teachers are required to issue grades frequently, which tends to work against process-oriented teaching” (p. 72). Standardized grading practices have never fit neatly with critical pedagogies, creating ethical struggles for many teachers (including me). However, since many teachers must grade, the authors provide example rubrics to support teachers in grading without reproducing the potentially detrimental effects of direct evaluation on students’ social-emotional learning. For example, in Chapter 4, “Teaching Empathy and Understanding,” the authors offer several suggestions related to grading student work without veering into “the judgmental role of grading empathic growth” (p. 142).\n\nThe authors also address the risks inherent in social justice–oriented classrooms, especially in our current moment of moral panic over concepts such as critical race theory and gender identity. This social reality requires a careful and practical approach to social justice in the classroom. We see one version of this intentional caution in Chapter 3, when a teacher, Alex, presents her plans to teach a unit on social change to school administration “using language that she knew would not raise undue concern” (p. 99). Like teachers in other chapters, Alex takes care to connect her plans for the unit to official learning standards and goals.\n\nAs I read Teaching Literacy in Troubled Times, I thought about my undergraduate secondary English teacher candidates. Every year, I find that their field experiences make them more fatalistic about teacher agency. Although they enjoy reading about and discussing critical approaches to the ELA classroom, they express doubts about enacting such approaches, sometimes wondering what the point is of studying teaching methods they won’t be able to implement. For this reason, I was grateful for this book’s descriptions of how teachers managed challenges that arose in response to the themes and topics they taught as well as the time their units required.\n\nThis book reminded me how many teachers proceed with courage and integrity despite the challenges they face from policymakers, community members, and sometimes their own administrators and colleagues. These are teachers who are making a way out of what can sometimes, on bad days, seem like no way at all.\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nSue Weinstein is the MacCurdy Distinguished Professor of English at Louisiana State University, and she currently chairs the LSU Department of English.

F. (2021). Theater, drama, and reading: Transforming the rehearsal process into a reading process. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nTheater, Drama, and Reading: Transforming the Rehearsal Process into a Reading Process offers an alternative approach to close reading, inferencing, and meaning-making in ELA instruction. In her classroom experiences, author Judith Freeman Garey noticed that students were more engaged with texts when reading involved “an interactive process of making [the] text visible, concrete, and meaningful” (p. xx). To achieve this engagement, Garey proposes that ELA teachers incorporate techniques borrowed from theater into their lessons.\n\nThis book describes a framework allowing students to take on the personas of “actors read[ing] to build characters’ lives, designers read[ing] to construct context, and directors read[ing] to generate action” (p. 9). Together, these roles work to build students’ deeper understanding of literary texts. Over four sections, Theater, Drama, and Reading demonstrates how to introduce each role and how to employ them using examples from Garey’s classroom to support her framework.\n\nThe book’s introduction outlines the relationships between drama and ELA classrooms, Common Core Standards, and online environments. Then, Section I—Reading as a Theater Artist—contextualizes techniques from the theater world and describes the responsibilities of each student’s role. Section II, Application in the Classroom, makes up the bulk of the text. Here, Garey demonstrates how to apply theater techniques in the ELA classroom, using the poem “Oranges” by Gary Soto and the short story “Thank You, M’am” by Langston Hughes.\n\nAlthough the sample lessons unfold over a two-class-period time frame, the lesson timelines are flexible. Each lesson begins by front-loading definitions and explanations of dramatic techniques and orienting students to the reading strategies they use. Garey offers a two-part reading practice in which the first reading is done as “ourselves” and the second reading asks students to read the text in assigned roles, each of which has a list of responsibilities outlined in the role’s worklist. Garey emphasizes that teachers should encourage students to share their learning from previous classes through reflections and class discussions to support their engagement with the text in these roles.\n\nThe book also outlines teachers’ responsibilities during activities and lessons. They can take on the roles of actor, designer, and director to model them for students and guide students “toward achieving their goals” (p. 35). The “Delving Deeper” feature in each chapter models how teachers can inspire their students to infer information by exploring their interpretations of the text while encouraging them to continually “refer back to the textual evidence” (p. 73) to support their claims.\n\nEarly in the book, Garey explains her goal of making texts visible to her students; based on the examples of student work and anecdotal evidence, she achieves that goal. Throughout the Application section, students’ annotated poems, filled-in worksheets in the role of set designer, and sketches of the classroom layout for productions illustrate student responses to the lessons. The annotations of Soto’s poem, as shown in Figure 5.2 (p. 47), and the detailed analysis of Hughes’ short story for character relationships shown in Figure 5.7 (p. 60) indicate that drama techniques can successfully provide a door (Bishop, 1990) into texts by making them more accessible.\n\nThese examples also highlight other benefits of Garey’s approach. The activities in the text require students to work alongside their peers to produce scripts, set designs, and action sequences. To complete those tasks, students must work together to “develop, implement, and communicate new ideas . . . effectively” while also being “open and responsive to new and diverse perspectives” (Partnership, 2019, p. 4), thus encouraging the development of students’ communication and collaboration skills. Thanks to Garey’s detailed instructions and the inclusion of student examples, teacher educators and teachers seeking alternative methods of reading instruction will find this book a helpful and engaging resource to create opportunities for students to read critically and actively.\n\nReferences\n\nBishop, R.

S., Beach, C. L., & Leogrande, C. (Eds.) (2021). Stories of sports: Critical literacy in media production, consumption, and dissemination. Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nStories of Sports: Critical Literacy in Media Production, Consumption, and Dissemination is an edited collection exploring the intersections of media, critical literacy, and social justice in sports stories. Composed of nine chapters, the book applies a critical literacy lens to analyze pedagogical practices, disability, coach and youth relationships, diabetes in sports, women in sports, and students’ writing about sports. Although I’m not personally drawn to sports, I was excited to see how the authors applied critical literacy to this subject matter.\n\nCritical literacy is a relatively new topic for me, but the book makes it accessible in part due to the use of well-known sports. In this context, the authors use critical literacy to examine discrimination—whether blatant or embedded—within different forms of media. While all the chapters were enjoyable, Chapters 1 and 3 stood out the most to me.\n\nIn the first chapter, Katherin Garland helpfully breaks down critical literacy and how it informs views of social justice in sports. Her writing style and explanation of concepts and questions help to create a foundation for later chapters. In Chapter 3, Luke Rodesiler, Mark A. Lewis, and Alan Brown examine coach-student relationships in sports-related films. Their examples of the many roles that coaches embody—such as teacher, tactician, authoritarian, and disciplinarian—easily connect to teacher-student relationships since teachers often occupy multiple roles in students’ lives.\n\nThe variety of examples throughout all of the chapters is a strength that allows the book to appeal to various audiences. In Chapter 2, for example, Brian Sheehy looks at the ways in which baseball-related media texts shape the beliefs and behaviors of those engaged with those texts, impacting their political ideologies. In Chapter 6, Cynthia Martin begins with a personal narrative before discussing counternarratives in sports and their ability to impact the stigmatizing of diabetes in sports media.\n\nELA teachers and teacher educators can use this edited collection in many ways. The sports-related stories, movies, and pop culture references addressed by the authors make it easy to create engaging lessons that employ relatable content. In addition, the examples support conversations about what is happening in the media and how students can process information from the media through a critical literacy lens. Personally, I am excited to use this book to create a classroom environment where students can examine stories about sports, analyze media, and interrogate issues of discrimination and bias.\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\nKáLyn Coghill is a doctoral student in the Media, Art, and Text program at Virginia Commonwealth University, where she teaches courses in the Department of Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies.

(2022). The mindful classroom: Constructive conversations on race, identity, and justice. Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nIn recent years, ELA teachers and teacher educators have worked actively to be antiracist in their curriculum, faculty development, and support for minority students. However, it is not always clear what antiracist pedagogy and practices look like. Tru Leverette provides a framework for cultivating antiracism and social justice in the classroom in The Mindful Classroom: Constructive Conversations on Race, Identity, and Justice.\n\nThe book’s six chapters provide a unique approach to teaching and talking about race by blending pedagogy, race theory, and mindfulness. Beginning with the first chapter, Leverette prompts readers to examine individual and collective identity politics by asking, What is race really, and how does it shape who I am? Educators are encouraged to interrogate the basis of beliefs and assumptions about race rather than form a consensus about racial ideology. Chapter 2 then provides an actionable framework for creating constructive classroom conversations about race, including lists of ineffective and effective discussion strategies and practices to address resistance.\n\nChapter 3 attends to the role of literature in conversations about race, situating previous discussions about identity awareness and empathy in the literary space. Leverette draws on her literacy background to consider literature’s potential to foster productive engagement with different perspectives. Chapters 4 and 5 offer model syllabi, community-based learning projects, and assignments to foster antiracist pedagogy that extends beyond the classroom. Finally, Chapter 6 provides a critical perspective that is often overlooked in teacher education texts: the lived classroom experiences of students told in their own voices.\n\nInterspersed throughout the text are mindfulness and movement practices—including body, mind, and spirit exercises, with accommodations for diverse learners—intended to release tension, refocus our observing minds, and encourage us to listen without judgment. Educators committed to trauma-informed practices may find the mindfulness practices especially enlightening in the context of classroom conversations about race. Implementing these practices may be unfamiliar, but they can become welcome and indispensable class routines.\n\nThe most transformative concept Leverette introduces is her reframing of antiracist education by posing the question What counts as antiracist education for students of color? In educators’ attempts to raise the racial consciousness of white students, students of color often become participant observers of the white students’ racial awakening. To avoid sidelining students of color, Leverette offers a framework for working with white students to develop antiracist skills while actively fostering a classroom where students of color are equally empowered toward growth and personal development. ELA teachers and teacher educators must also reflect on this dynamic in their text selection. In an attempt to provide a diverse curriculum, teachers often select texts that singularly situate Black experience in racism and trauma. While literature has the capacity to build empathy, we must also attend to the racial trauma of students of color through literary violence in classroom spaces.\n\nLeverette’s evaluation of racial literacy and antiracist education illuminated and transformed the way I personally understand and attend to antiracism in my work and teaching. I am more intentional in privileging practices that decenter white students as the beneficiaries of antiracist pedagogy and in disrupting the narrative that racial awareness can be achieved only through bearing witness to racial trauma by instead selecting texts that feature joy, agency, and empowerment. For teacher educators, integrating this text into classroom conversations models how preservice teachers can develop more mindful antiracist classrooms.\n\nThe Mindful Classroom is a masterful quilt of antiracist theory, pedagogy, and actionable practices. The book’s aim is not to suggest a consensus about educators’ and students’ social justice responsibilities. Rather, it highlights how individuals have different roles to play in achieving the shared goal of social justice based on a deep understanding of their racial identity, positions, and privileges.\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\nJessica Schwind is a doctoral candidate at the University of Tennessee, and her research focuses on refining antiracist and trauma-informed approaches to literacy by investigating the lived experiences of Black students in secondary ELA classrooms.

E. (2021). Growing writers: Principles for high school writers and their teachers. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nGrowing Writers: Principles for High School Writers and Their Teachers makes the process of translating policy statements into classroom-based practice seamless by expanding the principles established in NCTE’s position statement Professional Knowledge for the Teaching of Writing (National Council of Teachers of English, 2016). Although the principles are freely available on NCTE’s website, this book is a valuable resource because it demonstrates how to put the principles into practice in today’s classrooms. For teachers who may have “entered the profession without a dedicated course on the teaching of writing” (p. 124) and for those who desire a more content-focused resource, Anne Elrod Whitney provides active, coherent, and collective professional knowledge that can help educators fill the gaps in their writing pedagogy.\n\nIn Chapter 1, Whitney asks readers to “think about professional knowledge” and makes the case for “grounding practice in principles.” This chapter establishes the importance of teacher research—through both formal and informal inquiry, in and out of the classroom—because “it gives us a reflective filter for enhancing and deepening practices” as well as an “evaluative filter for evaluating practices suggested” (p. 10). Chapter 2, “A Vision of Writing and Writing Instruction,” engages readers in discussion of what professional knowledge is and isn’t. The book explores what each principle “really looks like in our day-to-day teaching of writing” (p. 15) through Whitney’s active, modeled inquiry of her own “constant learning, constant reflection, and constant interrogation” (p. 14). Whitney’s personal examples address the conflict between what we know and what we do as writing instructors, such as using prescribed, formulaic writing templates.\n\nPart II of the book, including Chapters 3 through 9, poses the paradox of teaching—“the better we get at it, the more unsatisfied we become with doing things the same old way year after year and hoping they work” (p. 39)—before taking readers “in the classroom” to observe “teachers on their practice.” Whitney highlights the perspectives of other teacher-authors who represent a diverse range of experiences, backgrounds, and classroom contexts. These chapters model the “lively, ongoing conversation among teachers of writing” (p. 7) by providing real-world examples of how teachers apply principles to the instruction of writing practices, creative writing, collaborative genres, writing rituals, disrupting of texts, civic identities, revision, and voice. These insights provide teachers, especially preservice teachers, with concrete examples of skills they can use to dig deeper into the practice of teaching writing.\n\nThe book’s greatest strength is its expansion of the NCTE (2016) writing principles through its incorporation of classroom contexts and narrative experiences. Whitney shares her experience in mediating writing principles with more organic writing practice. Reflecting on how her practice became more grounded, she describes the process of realizing that professional knowledge “confirms, extends, and at times challenges” what we do as writing instructors (p. 10). Her perspective is refreshing because, as she discusses in Part III, we all grow in our professional knowledge, demonstrating how writing teaching practice evolves over time.\n\nAs an ELA teacher educator, I plan to incorporate Growing Writers into my Advanced Composition for Teachers course to engage my preservice teachers in more meaningful discussions about the importance of grounding their writing and teaching practices in principles. This book provides “intentional, powerful lenses through which to view and reflect on our own practice” (p. 5), thus centering principles as sources of ideas and guiding us on how to defend practices. This type of active learning aids teachers in navigating and advocating for best writing practices. Moreover, I want to incorporate this text into my professional development trainings with current teachers who need support developing efficacy in their writing instruction. Since Growing Writers affirms the importance of each principle through expansion, discussion, teachers’ experiences, and classroom narratives, this text will be a great aid to professional knowledge growth for both pre- and inservice teachers.\n\nReference\n\nNational Council of Teachers of English.

M., & Knapp, J. V. (2022). Teaching literature in high school: Principles into purposeful practice. Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nTeaching Literature in High School: Principles into Purposeful Practice models strategies that will help “students learn the procedures for disciplined reading of complex texts” (p. 7). Each of the book’s nine chapters provides in-depth analysis of a sample text and demonstrates the use of a suggested teaching strategy with that text.\n\nThe book opens with a chapter on frontloading background knowledge or themes through anticipation guides, while the rest of the text focuses on specific practices, such as locating irony and engaging in performance when reading plays. To illustrate how to teach these reading strategies, the authors rely on textual examples from the Western literary canon, making this book particularly useful to teachers drawing upon the canon for their classroom texts.\n\nThe strengths of the book lie in McCann and Knapp’s deep analyses of texts and detailed instructions for each teaching strategy. For example, in Chapter 4, they demonstrate how to recognize rules of configuration in literature and explain how to use those rules to guide students into making predictions about a short story. Additionally, the authors include example discussion questions and excerpts from online discussions of the story, taken from students in the authors’ courses. Teachers who use, or wish to use, the texts analyzed by McCann and Knapp will find the book a valuable resource, thanks to the ease of implementing the suggested teaching strategies with the provided texts. Teachers who wish to use different texts may also adapt the provided procedures to more contemporary texts.\n\nAs we know, the ELA classroom is a site that continues to reinforce racism and white supremacy (Baker-Bell, 2019; Johnson et al., 2017). Therefore, one concern involves the book’s inconsistent engagement with texts by BIPOC authors. Although one chapter’s central text is Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun, the lack of attention given to diverse voices is a glaring omission throughout the rest of the book. McCann and Knapp do reference texts by BIPOC authors for use as extensions or scaffolds, but the singular use of a play by a Black author demonstrates the lack of engagement with texts by BIPOC authors overall.\n\nAnother concern involves the authors’ use of the Dr. Seuss book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street to introduce critical lenses. This text contains racist images of Asian American characters (Ishizuka & Stephens, 2019), identified by McCann and Knapp as “questionable images” with “unfortunate implications” (p. 68). The authors include a sample letter of complaint about the book that notes “negative stereotyping of Asians and the elderly” (p. 67), but they do not explicitly name the racism or consider the harm done by using racist images of Asian American characters to teach a lesson on thinking and writing critically.\n\nAlthough the procedures presented in Teaching Literature in High School have merit, teacher educators and teachers would benefit from the inclusion of more contemporary and diverse text examples. Inservice teachers and preservice teachers alike need support in diversifying their classroom curriculum; instructional texts like this one can support this work by demonstrating how ELA teachers can use diverse texts to analyze literary elements and engage in thoughtful discussion. For example, in Chapter 2, a novel such as Toni Morrison’s Beloved might be used to demonstrate the importance of building background knowledge; in Chapter 5, contemporary YA literature such as Paula Yoo’s From a Whisper to a Rallying Cry could be used to introduce students to critical lenses. Inclusion of more diverse authors and texts, rather than reliance on texts typically found in the literary canon, would strengthen the ideas offered in McCann and Knapp’s book in purposeful ways.\n\nReferences\n\nBaker-Bell, A.

Perry, Zemelman, and Smith encourage teachers to acknowledge intersectionalities, question biases and assumptions, and analyze systems and practices that continue to shape approaches to race in education.\n\nThroughout this engaging and streamlined book, the authors focus on different aspects of building equitable classrooms, such as defining antiracism and racial literacy; they also explore the challenges of creating equitable classrooms with vulnerability, candor, and practicality. The authors acknowledge early in the book that the pursuit of racial equity is tenuous and nuanced, and they carry this thread throughout by acknowledging racial imbalance in authorship and including personal reflections that lay bare the realities of navigating racial equity. In the Time Out to Talk sections, which accompany all six chapters, the authors reflectively address challenges specific to their writing, thinking processes, and relationships with one another.\n\nIn one particularly poignant section, Perry and Zemelman discuss the decision to add Smith as a contributor. Zemelman notes that adding Smith, a white woman, would create a racial imbalance within the writing team and create the potential for white perspectives to drive the narrative. As the authors process this reality, Perry highlights the importance of frequent “pulse checks,” or moments for personal reflection, as they move forward with the project. These real-time examples of collaboration and authentic dialogues serve as models of how to work alongside colleagues to create equitable classrooms.\n\nIn addition to an authentic exploration of the process of pursuing racial equity, Perry, Zemelman, and Smith offer resources for teachers. Each chapter is accompanied by a framework for thinking about racial equity, as well as guides for implementing strategies and activities with students. Teachers will find Chapter 3 (“Helping Students Teach Us About Who They Are”) especially powerful because it provides tools for investigating the narratives that students bring with them into the classroom. Activities such as creating personal time lines and autobiographical narratives are easy to implement and allow students agency in telling their stories. Readers will also find robust appendixes to guide further thought and exploration about racial equity in the classroom, along with QR codes for digital resources providing materials for lessons and activities. By providing these tools, the authors move beyond reflection to real-world application.\n\nPerry, Zemelman, and Smith’s multifaceted approach guides readers through the process of creating racially equitable classrooms and critically considering their positionalities within conversations about race in the classroom. Had I read this book before I entered the field, I would have been able to better understand the mistakes that well-intentioned but ill-informed white teachers often make when pursuing equity in their classrooms. Chapter 2 (“Starting with Ourselves”) guides readers through a process of self-discovery by encouraging critical reflection on personal histories and implicit biases. When I was a novice teacher, this chapter would have shown me that I could not effectively bring about racial equity in my classroom without first exploring how I might have made assumptions about my students and misinterpreted their needs. This book can help preservice teachers reflect on their implicit biases before they enter the field, giving them a foundation to begin their careers with equity in mind. During a time of relentless censorship and policy-making that seeks to curtail discussions of race in the classroom, this book provides thoughtful guidance for both preservice and inservice teachers who wish to critically and responsibly work alongside their colleagues to establish racial equity in education.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nMeg Grizzle is a PhD student and graduate assistant focusing on literacy and teacher education in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Arkansas.

Lathrop\n\nPurdue University\n\nBook review of Sumara, D., & Alvermann, D. E. (Eds.). (2021). Ideas that changed literacy practices: First-person accounts from leading voices. Myers Education Press.\n\nIn Ideas That Changed Literacy Practices, leading literacy scholars reflect on their scholarly and pedagogical lives in light of a single question: What is one idea that influenced your practice—an idea that worked on you even as you worked on it? Each reflection in this collection is both academic and deeply personal. Given the 33 essays examining a wide range of ideas in the field of literacy education, it would be impossible to comment on every one. Instead, this review focuses on a handful of the essays I found memorable because of their uniqueness, their convergence with my interests as a teacher educator and researcher, or the contrarian tone of the writer.\n\nOne of the most distinctive essays is from Donna E. Alvermann who, along with her coeditor Dennis Sumara, invited the scholars featured in this collection to write the story of an idea while embracing “their awareness of the relationship between their academic work and their embodied sense of self” (p. 2). This awareness emerges through many of the essays in a way that teacher educators, who are engaged in scholarship while embodying a teacher identity, will find helpful in navigating the tension between theory and practice. Alvermann’s essay adopts a highly personal form to explore this tension, opening with a poignant narrative about a 1942 photo of her three-year-old self that conveys the inherent unreliability of narrators and frames the ensuing discussion about questioning historical authenticity. The story illustrates Alvermann’s main idea: that our subjective, “multilayered entanglements” should remind us that the written accounts we read can never be taken at face value, because often “the doers, tellers, and recorders of an observable event are positioned differently and inequitably” (p. 18). For teacher educators, the essay serves as a reminder to problematize the personal teaching narratives we share with preservice teachers (PSTs), recognize that some of our own memories may be suspect, and make room for nuance and uncertainty.\n\nA growing sense of nuance and uncertainty has characterized my own research and teaching practices over the last few years as I have reexamined my religious heritage and beliefs in the shadow of rising white Christian nationalism. Therefore, I was especially interested in Kevin Burke’s thoughts in “The Everydayness of Religious Literacies.” Burke explores the militant masculinity undergirding much of the religious right and its perplexing infatuation with Donald Trump in terms of a particular set of literacy practices that read historical and sacred texts shaped by and shaping a consumerist religious subculture. Burke reflects on a career of exploring the discursive potential of religion, including everyday literacy practices rooted in religious traditions and the “possibilities that might be imagined through theological discourses read back into educational [endeavors]” (p. 71). Burke’s essay makes a compelling argument for why teacher educators working in nonreligious institutions, even if they are not themselves religious, should be aware of the profound ways religious literacies have shaped the learning of many PSTs, the students those PSTs will encounter, and public discourse in general.\n\nLike Burke’s essay, which troubles “our easy sense of schooling as a place devoid of the spirit” (p. 68), Mark Dressman’s essay challenges some of the conventional wisdom of literacy scholarship. In “On the Failure of Reason in the Face of Belief,” Dressman mourns what he sees as a shift away “from debate and toward ideological warfare” in literacy education between 1980 and 1990. Consequently, Dressman writes, he has spent much of his career “challenging normative discourses of literacy research and practice” (p. 71) and has often been labeled a contrarian. He goes on to critique the National Reading Panel and the New Literacies movement, describing the latter’s “failure . . . as a theoretical and empirical project” (p. 89). Although I did not find his criticism of these scholars’ supposed “failure of reason” entirely convincing, his concern about abandoning rational debate in favor of ideological conformity is an important one with which all in the academy should reckon. This essay challenges teacher educators to create spaces where PSTs feel safe in questioning and challenging widely accepted ideas.\n\nOverall, this volume makes important contributions to the field of literacy, especially for teacher educators. From Margaret Carmody Hagood’s use of rhizome as a tool for thinking about literacy to Michele Knobel’s and Colin Lankshear’s differing approaches to memes in literacy and research to Peter Smagorinsky’s reflection on his intellectual shift, this collection provides rich food for thought for teacher educators and their PSTs. Readers will gain an appreciation of many of the ideas that have shaped the field and, even more interestingly, of the stories and personalities behind those ideas.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nBenjamin N.

P., & Pitre, L. A. (2021). Exploring relationships and connections to others: Teaching universal themes through young adult novels. Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nEngaging students in reading literature poses a challenge for English teachers across all levels of experience. Beginning practitioners can struggle with a range of questions, from what books to teach to how long units should last, and veteran teachers may wonder how they can refresh their novel units.\n\nMike P. Cook and Leilya A. Pitre’s Exploring Relationships and Connections to Others: Teaching Universal Themes through Young Adult Novels answers these questions and more by showing teachers how to connect texts to themes and ideas that adolescents find relatable. This volume provides a comprehensive overview of how teachers can approach literature instruction through thematic lenses such as love and loss, friendship and betrayal, hate and healing, and dreams and hope for tomorrow. In doing so, it offers thoughtful reflections on text selection, detailed descriptions of the themes’ relevance to adolescents, and an array of engaging instructional ideas teachers can use in the classroom.\n\nThe strength of this book rests in its structure, as each of the four universal themes examined receives a two-chapter treatment by the authors in which the theme is first described and then addressed in a related conceptual teaching unit. In the first chapter of each discussion, the authors expound on the theme’s relevance to adolescents in both middle and high school, identify the shortcomings of texts often taught in relation to the themes, and discuss contemporary young adult texts they recommend for teaching the theme.\n\nFor example, in addressing the theme of friendship and betrayal, the authors discuss the role of friendship in adolescent life and the benefits of exploring the theme through literature before they provide a rationale for not teaching a text traditionally linked to these themes: John Knowles’s (1958) A Separate Peace. Cook and Pitre argue students have reduced opportunities for personal connection to the theme due in part to the text’s limited representations of friendship and in part to its setting, an elite New England boarding school during World War II. Alternatively, Cook and Pitre provide a teaching unit for Francisco X. Stork’s (2010) novel The Last Summer of the Death Warriors, which provides a more nuanced view of friendship and betrayal. The authors also suggest additional thematically linked texts, such as Jason Reynolds’s (2016) Ghost and Mariko Tamaki and Jillian Tamaki’s (2014) This One Summer.\n\nThe second chapter in each pair outlines a novel unit with activities designed to guide students to a deeper understanding of the theme and includes suggested titles, essential questions, journal topics, whole-class discussion topics, and enrichment activities. In the friendship and betrayal chapter, for example, Cook and Pitre describe creating a friendship life map, designing a guidebook for navigating the complexities of friendship, and writing a personal essay defining betrayal.\n\nAlthough the book could be misunderstood as addressing how to teach four novel units rather than how to use thematic orientations more generally in young adult literature instruction, its analytical techniques can in fact be applied to any novel with slight modifications. Using this text as a model in the methods classroom might involve assigning preservice teachers a theme around which they design their own unit with a key novel of their choosing. In doing so, PSTs could dive into the suggested activities while developing a deeper understanding of unit construction.\n\nAs a teacher educator, I am excited by the opportunities provided in the text that allow for rich conversations about unit design, novel selection, and, in the current political climate, ways of crafting arguments against using texts that elevate dominant and/or outdated beliefs and values. Cook and Pitre have succeeded in their purpose of writing a book that supports “teachers in crafting units of study that are purposefully engaging and effective” (p. 5). English teacher educators will find the book particularly useful for engaging preservice teachers in discussions about ways to bring young adult interests and literature to the forefront of their instructional practice.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nStephanie Robillard is a PhD candidate at Stanford University.

(2020). Learning to teach English and the language arts: A Vygotskian perspective on beginning teachers’ pedagogical concept development. Bloomsbury.\n\nLearning to Teach English and the Language Arts is as much a testament to Peter Smagorinsky’s extensive career as a distinguished research professor in English education as it is a handbook for educational stakeholders navigating the theory-to-practice divide—and indeed, it serves both purposes rather well. The introduction, for instance, speaks directly to the chasm between the language that educator-researchers use theoretically and the creative, affective, and mediated application in the classroom. Smagorinsky grounds his analyses and discussion in Vygotsky’s perspectives on learning to illustrate how learning to teach is complicated by each new teacher’s social context.\n\nThe conundrums Smagorinsky puts forth feel deeply familiar, and his writing embodies the clarity of explication that the book, as a whole, promotes. Taken collectively, the book’s 12 chapters argue for teacher education programs (TEPs) to develop a conceptual home base. If the field is going to recruit, prepare, and retain the excellent teachers that our nation’s diverse student populations deserve, TEPs need to explicitly reinforce, through practice, the theoretical principles they champion. This endeavor is infinitely more complex than it may sound.\n\nTo illustrate his argument, Smagorinsky presents multiple case studies across nine chapters, selectively aggregating each study by experience and focus. Student-participants come from three different TEPs and are followed through their student teaching and into their first years in the classroom. Data from interviews and classroom observations describe how each teacher’s pedagogical growth is shifted by competing and often irreconcilable power dynamics, curriculum and policy initiatives, and cultural ideologies. Smagorinsky threads these discussions alongside familiar teacher education theories, such as Lortie’s (1975) apprenticeship of observation and Feiman-Nemser and Buchman’s (1985) two-worlds pitfall. Readers will recognize the inevitably systemic, institutional, ideological collisions new teachers experience across schooling contexts when learning to teach English language arts. But, without cultivating a conceptual home base, Smagorinsky argues, the contradictory environments often end up (re)shaping teacher practice (and, over time, ideology) in ways that reify the very binaries current research and theory intend to resist.\n\nFor instance, Chapter 5 speaks to schooling’s historical, systemic investment in whiteness and how epistemological differences are often evaded through “flowery rhetoric” (p. 97) and diversity hires. Cultural mismatches in field experiences, accountability mandates, and fragmented curriculum further complicate programmatic assumptions in learning to teach in antiracist and equitable ways. Chapter 10 explores this tension through grammar pedagogy, revealed as a “glaring hole in English/Language Arts (ELA) teachers’ university education” and a persistent “staple” in language strands of schooling curricula (pp. 174–176). Readers follow two beginning teachers as they navigate the if and how of teaching grammar and find a “twisting path of concept development in relation to the mediation of different settings” (p. 187). The pedagogical complexity revealed in each case veritably troubles (and prunes) the field’s notion of “best practices” writ large, unsettling critiques of grammar instruction that often appear concluded, exhausted, and elitist. In his closing remarks, Smagorinsky explains how neoliberal patterns of efficiency and Anglo-normative standards in schools do not jibe with constructivist ideals. Rather, TEPs need to cultivate educators’ discernment and dexterity to face the complex realities of constructivism head on.\n\nReaders who seek answers to the age-old theory-practice divide will instead find “gritty details” (p. 95) illuminating, collectively, the competing forces that keep many educators from developing the deeply rigorous and resonant craft required for excellent teaching. Offering a conceptual home base that sustains a teacher across contextual domains is a heady goal, but our nation’s children deserve racially and culturally diverse ELA teachers who engage, resist, and thrive over the long haul. Sharing cases with preservice teachers could indeed help them name and navigate the (often contradictory) variables shaping their own experiences, and this book provides teacher educators and beginning teachers alike with a spectrum of entry points.\n\nReferences\n\nFeiman-Nemser, S., & Buchman, M.

A. (2021). Inclusive education in a strengths-based era: Mapping the future of the field. Norton.\n\nMichael L. Wehmeyer and Jennifer A. Kurth’s Inclusive Education in a Strengths-Based Era is the inaugural book in a series to share strategies for teaching students with disabilities in inclusive settings. The authors propose that inclusive, personalized education should be the default schoolwide approach for all students, with or without disabilities.\n\nWehmeyer and Kurth open the book with two chapters explaining the evolution of special education and perceptions of disability. The authors endorse a social model to understand student disability not as an obstacle to be overcome but as one of many defining features, like students’ individual abilities and interests. Since all students have their own strengths and needs as learners, they should be offered personalized education that emphasizes agency and provides multitiered support to achieve their learning goals.\n\nIn the three remaining chapters, the authors recommend several inclusive teaching strategies whose efficacy is supported by research, such as Response to Intervention and Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Another recommended strategy is co-teaching, in which special education instructors teach in general classrooms alongside subject area teachers throughout the day rather than in isolated resource rooms, thus interacting with all students to provide tiered instruction. To help readers picture how co-teaching might be carried out, the authors provide a table listing pre-, mid-, and post-teaching roles and responsibilities to serve as a template for classroom and special education teachers as they determine who will do which tasks for a co-taught lesson.\n\nAlthough intended for educators in all disciplines, this book does include examples specific to English language arts (ELA) from inclusive classrooms, such as how students with various communication needs may improve their listening and speaking skills by interacting with peers who can serve as “competent communication partners” and demonstrate “varied language structures” (p. 51) during ELA classroom interactions. The authors also illustrate UDL in the ELA classroom with examples such as providing an audiobook to a student with reading difficulties and allowing all students to choose their preferred book format, so long as they meet the same expectations for text comprehension. Examples of additional technology-assisted learning practices include using text-to-speech software to teach phonics and speech-to-text programs to support writing for students with cognitive or physical disabilities. A chapter on the supporting research cites studies in which participants in special education showed more gains in reading and writing when learning in inclusive ELA classrooms than in self-contained resource rooms.\n\nIn this book, Wehmeyer and Kurth suggest that special education is now in a strengths-based era: a period in which we offer personalized learning that starts with students’ abilities and interests and creates “education interventions around those factors and not around factors pertaining to deficits” (p. 59). The authors also observe that US schooling is simultaneously shifting from standardized to individualized education even for students without disabilities, making this an ideal moment to consider how to personalize education for students with disabilities based on each student’s strengths. I appreciate that this book offers a framework for inclusion as well as examples of inclusion in action, which will benefit my students in preparing for their field experiences.\n\nTeacher educators could use this book to help future ELA teachers choose and use strengths-based strategies to serve all students, whether in special education or not. I intend to share it with my English education students to help them envision what inclusive strengths-based teaching might look like in their own classrooms someday.\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nKevin Moberg is a faculty member in the Department of Arts and Letters and the School of Education at Dickinson State University in North Dakota.

B. (2021). Using film to unlock textual literacy: A teacher’s guide. National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nIn Using Film to Unlock Textual Literacy: A Teacher’s Guide, Robert Bryant Crisp tackles questions with which I’ve recently grappled: What is “English language arts”? How can it evolve? Limiting “English class” to the traditional linguistic literacy of the white middle class can exclude and harm students who engage in multilingual and multimodal literacies within nonacademic spheres. As an alternative to written, text-based literacy instruction, Crisp argues that English language arts (ELA) educators can implement film as a viable mode for teaching literacy skills.\n\nIn his introduction, Crisp reasons that filmmaking can encourage students’ literacy proficiency by engaging the same analytical and compositional skills taught in a text-based ELA curriculum. Anticipating the potential challenges teachers may face when implementing filmmaking in their own classes, Crisp offers insights on grading, maintaining effective collaboration within groups, and setting a flexible hierarchy that promotes high expectations for student participation and design. Furthermore, his introduction includes a choice of 10 small-group, project-based filmmaking assignments—from preproduction to postproduction—that could encourage teachers to include filmmaking in their curricula.\n\nIn the remaining 12 chapters, Crisp clearly aligns the steps of preproduction in filmmaking with those of prewriting and drafting in traditional literacy and composition instruction, offering ELA teachers who are uncertain of digital video spaces or lack access to production equipment an opportunity to implement his lessons incrementally. Each chapter opens with a lesson plan that includes essential questions, objectives, central texts, agendas, differentiations, vocabulary, resources, and suggested timelines that do not necessarily require special equipment or skills. Connecting each lesson to the ELA Common Core State Standards, Crisp provides detailed steps to build students’ multimodal film literacy that parallel the ways ELA teachers already construct textual literacy. Moreover, Crisp relates his lessons to common literature texts, including Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun and William Shakespeare’s Othello, to create a transitional space for ELA teachers who are perhaps inexperienced with digital modes of literacy or more comfortable with classic texts.\n\nCrisp’s filmmaking process and his film literacy lessons evoke the new literacies of Lankshear and Knobel, especially their (2007)"
