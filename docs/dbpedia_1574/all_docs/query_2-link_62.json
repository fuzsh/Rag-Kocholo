Follow Mavis Vermillion and her friends' journey into what started it all—from war to new adventures to heartbreak—revealing a dark past with an eye towards a brighter future.\n\nLucy meets Fairy Tail's Natsu and Happy, who are looking for a certain \"Salamander\". After Natsu and Happy save Lucy from some trouble, the three return to the guild where Lucy becomes a new member before they take the task of searching for a disappeared member, Macao.\n\nNatsu talks Lucy into forming a team with him, and they take their first mission together, which has very high pay, but a very high risk as well...\n\nErza returns to Fairy Tail to recruit Natsu and Gray to help her investigate Eisenwald, a Dark Guild banned by the Magic Council that's up to no good. Lucy and Happy also join in on the chaos.\n\nNatsu and Happy decide to take an S-Class job without permission and drag Lucy and Gray along with them to the cursed island of Galuna. There they meet one of Gray's old friends, who is trying to release a powerful sealed demon with the help of his team. Gray's past is revealed...\n\nNatsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray and Erza return from Galuna Island to find that their guild headquarters in ruins thanks to a rival guild known as Phantom Lord. A few more vile actions committed by one of Phantom Lord's members leads to a full-blown war between the two guilds. Lucy's past is also slowly revealed...\n\nErza's former friends from her childhood make an appearance and cause chaos for Fairy Tail's strongest team, taking Erza with them to the Tower of Heaven. There, Erza and her friends must confront Jellal Fernandes, one of Erza's longtime friends gone insane. Erza's past also slowly comes into view...\n\nThe group members return home after the harrowing ordeal within the Tower of Heaven and find their guild rebuilt better than ever. But this new pleasant surprise is cut short when Laxus and his team start an inter-guild battle within Fairy Tail itself so that Laxus can become the new guild master of Fairy Tail. Makarov and Laxus's past comes into view...\n\nWhen Oración Seis, one of the top three Dark Guilds in Fiore makes a move at seizing an ancient and deadly Magic called Nirvana, an alliance of the Fairy Tail, Lamia Scale, Blue Pegasus and Cait Shelter guilds sets out to destroy it for good. Wendy's past comes slowly into motion...\n\nThe hyper dimensional transport spell Anima finally grows too big and sends Fairy Tail and Magnolia Town to Edolas, seemingly leaving only Natsu, Wendy, Happy, and Carla behind. The heroes travel to this Edolas, a world where Magic is scarce and faces are all too familiar, to rescue their friends from a greedy, Magic-hoarding King. The origins of Happy, Carla, and Mystogan also come to the forefront...\n\nFairy Tail holds its annual S-Class Mage Promotion Trial, a trial that allows for one of eight selected candidates the opportunity to become the next S-Class Mage. But Carla has a vision of utter disaster for this year's trial, which is held at Fairy Tail's holy ground, Tenrou Island. The sudden appearance of a mysterious and deadly Mage who can kill without touching, and the arrival of members of the strongest Dark Guild, Grimoire Heart, quickly prove her right. Cana's past also comes into focus...\n\nSeven years have passed since the destruction of Tenrou Island and the disappearance of all the Fairy Tail members on it. Now Fairy Tail is facing a major crisis, and it could use its strongest members back.\n\nThe core Fairy Tail members have returned, and things seem to have gone back to normal. That is until a mysterious girl drops by the guild and brings with her a strange memento from Lucy's late father. When old and new faces arise to claim this memento for themselves, Fairy Tail must literally race against time to save the world.\n\nFairy Tail decides to participate in a tournament known as the Grand Magic Games to restore its former glory. However, the competition is fierce with the likes of the current number one guild, Sabertooth, and the former Dark Guild, Raven Tail, seeking to crush them. What's more, a mysterious power seems to be lurking around the tournament grounds.\n\nThe calamity from Eclipse has not ended yet, as one day, the Twelve Zodiac Gates refuse to respond to their summoning. In addition to their sudden change in appearance and personality, they also sever the bonds they have with their contracted Celestial Spirit Mages! These rebels, who have set off the Beacon of Rebellion, demand only one thing, \"total freedom\"!! In front of those who rise up to recover the bonds, are the new twelve gates, and are ready to stand in their way!\n\nVictorious over at the Grand Magic Games, Fairy Tail is bombarded with numerous requests from all around. One specific client, comes from the fourth ranked Wizard Ssaint Warrod Sequen, who requests the help of Natsu and Gray. Accepting his request, they head towards Sun Village, and are quickly confronted by new enemies and former foes.\n\nThe Dark Guild known as Tartaros makes their move on the Magic World. Beginning with an attack on the Magic Council Headquarters, the Nine Demon Gates quickly begin the execution of their plans, starting with the elimination of the entire council and many others. In the aftermath, news of the event is quick to reach the ears of Fairy Tail.\n\nOne year after Fairy Tail's dissolution, Natsu and Lucy reunite to track down their comrades to revive their guild once again. Meanwhile, in the shadows, a sinister organization with familiar faces plots to pave the way for a new world belonging to Zeref. A brand new journey awaits them!\n\nWith Fairy Tail's revival complete, Mest Gryder reveals the disturbing truth behind Makarov Dreyar's disbanding of the guild one year ago. Newly-minted Seventh Guild Master Erza Scarlet tasks herself, Mest and the other members of Team Natsu to go on an infiltration mission to retrieve their master from the militaristic Alvarez Empire, but when they return, they learn the truth behind Fairy Tail's greatest secret, Lumen Histoire, and must defeat the invading Alvarez Empire, which has over a million fleets at their disposal, spear-headed by the fearsome Spriggan 12 and Zeref himself.\n\nTeam Natsu embarks on the 100 years quest to \"seal\" five potentially destructive Dragons in hiding known as the Five Dragon Gods, all equal in standing with Acnologia. They begin their search for the first of these Dragon Gods. Meanwhile members at the guildhall are introduced to a new recruit named Touka, who garners suspicions by Gajeel, Juvia and an ally to the guild, Jellal.\n\nTeam Natsu head to Draseel to seal the second of the Dragon Gods, however things don't go as planned when the entire Fairy Tail guild becomes involved as a result of the actions of Rebellious."
