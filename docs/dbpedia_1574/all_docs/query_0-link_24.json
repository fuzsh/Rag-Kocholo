        "text": "It’s about to be a very packed spring for LGBTQ+ books! Here are the upcoming March, April, and May releases to keep on your radar.\n\nMarch\n\nFinding the Fool by Meg Jones Wall (March 1)\n\nThis debut subtitled “a tarot journey to radical transformation” is by Autostraddle’s very own Meg Jones Wall! The book is a tarot resource and study guide in Wall’s “masterful prose,” written with inclusivity, clarity, and generosity. Providing a roadmap for the reader’s own unique journey, Finding the Fool is for people of all genders, experiences, and identities. Alongside explorations of each card, Wall offers astrological and numerological correspondences, ideas for connecting spiritually and creatively with the tarot, journal prompts, suggestions for tarot spreads, and thoughts on esoteric tools for exploring different cards.\n\nMotherworld by Destiny Hemphill (March 1)\n\nSubtitled a “devotional for the alter-life,” this debut book of poetry is by a Black, queer, chronically ill ritual worker and poet writing about “an unseen geography of Black, queer speculative freedom and the invisible lineage of chronic illness.” The collection has roots in science fiction and imaging otherwise and it is divided into three parts: i. the portal appears, ii. the portal opens, and iii. the portal expands. Check out one of Hemphill’s poems, “our own names,” read aloud and glossed by the author.\n\nMeeting Millie by Clare Ashton (March 1)\n\nThis new romance from the author of beloved series like The Goodmans features two former best friends, Millie and Charlotte who first meet at Oxford studying to be lawyers. They couldn’t be more dissimilar: Millie is straight (??), exuberant, and working class; Charlotte is gay, shy, and upper middle class. But when their friendship veers into romance, their relationship abruptly ends…until they meet again ten years later.\n\nThe Immeasurable Depth of You by Maria Ingrande Mora (March 7)\n\nA queer supernatural coming of age YA story, The Immeasurable Depth of You features a 15-year-old girl, Brynn, living with severe anxiety and intrusive thoughts. After her mom interprets one of her blog posts as a suicide note, Brynn is sent to her dad’s off-grid houseboat in the Florida mangroves. With no internet and no phone, cut off from her online — and only friends — Brynn is surprised to connect with a local girl, Skylar, who is her opposite on every way. When Brynn finds out Skylar is stuck in the bayou for a mysterious reason, she becomes determined to free her from whatever dark force is keeping her there.\n\nThe Mimicking of Known Successes by Malka Ann Older (March 7)\n\nThe first book in a new science fiction series, The Mimicking of Known Successes is a “cozy Holmesian murder mystery and sapphic romance, set on Jupiter”! Mossa, the protagonist and investigator, is set onto a case of apparent suicide which takes her from a remote outpost to the human colony’s intellectual centre and university town, Valdegeld. There Mossa asks for help from her ex, Pleiti, a researcher of Earth’s ecosystems working towards a return to their homeland. As the two work together to solve the case, it becomes clear much more is at stake.\n\nFat On Fat Off by Clarkisha Kent (March 7)\n\nCultural critic Clarkisha Kent is funny, candid, and smart in her debut memoir where she describes the kind of obstacles life throws at you when you’re fat, Black, and queer dealing with intergenerational trauma and mental illness. Subtitled “a big bitch manifesto,” this book follows her early life as a second generation immigrant with a religious and abusive family, her experiences with “ill-fated bisexual romances,” and coming into her own after college. For fans of Samantha Irby’s brand of humor and brutal honesty.\n\nMimosa by Archie Bongiovanni (March 7)\n\nAre you a fan of Archie Bongiovanni’s Grease Bats comics on Autostraddle? Well, you’re in luck! Their latest book is a graphic novel about four queer friends / chosen family in their mid to late thirties struggling to balance all the different facets of their lives while maintaining their decade long friendship. Parenting, divorce, career ambitions, work crushes, community, and friendship troubles all feature. When they get tired of being the oldest gays at the party, the four of them start Grind, an event specifically for queers in their thirties. It’s a welcome distraction for a while, but the rest of their messy lives can’t be ignored forever.\n\nRose Quartz by Sasha taqʷšəblu LaPointe (March 7)\n\nLaPointe’s debut feminist poetry collection combines folklore, punk sensibility, witchiness, and music in poems that explore both struggle and healing. “Draw me encircled / in something / other than gasoline” LaPointe writes, drawing inspiration from her Coast Salish heritage and lingering in the liminal spaces between beauty and danger. The poems play with color imagery, act as rituals and incantations, and delve into the poet’s interiority in search of self-discovery and belonging.\n\nArca by G.R. Macallister (March 7)\n\nThe second book in the Five Queendoms feminist epic fantasy series, Arca is set in a matriarchal world during a dark decade when no girls are born. This “drought of girls” has created rifts of tension between the five countries of this universe, all led by complex, ambitious women. Picking up where the first book left off, Arca follows primarily the leaders and societies of Arca, Scorpia, and Paxim, moving seamlessly from the battlefield to secret political strategizing. Featuring multiple sapphic characters!\n\nThe Faithless by C.L. Clark (March 7)\n\nSequel to The Unbroken, The Faithless follows solider Touraine and princess Luca as they journey back to Balladaire. The rebels have won the battle, and imperial forces are retreating from the colonized Qazal. The two women are staring down the consequences of demolishing an empire and seeking Luca’s rightful return to the throne. But detangling the deeply intertwined cultures and countries is no easy task.\n\nMy Dear Henry by Kalyan Bayron (March 7)\n\nThis YA retelling of Jekyll and Hyde by the author of This Poison Heart and Cinderella is Dead is a Black, gothic, gay reimagining of the original. Told from the perspective of 17-year-old Gabriel, an ex-boyfriend and ex-best friend of Henry Jekyll, the story follows Gabriel’s search for the disappeared Henry. At the same time, a mysterious young man named Hyde shows up in Gabriel’s life, claiming to be Henry’s friend.\n\nDear Medusa by Olivia A. Cole (March 14)\n\nThis YA novel in verse is about a 16-year-old grappling with the aftermath of sexual abuse by a teacher. Branded as a slut at school, abandoned by her best friend, and having quit the track team, Alicia feels hopeless. But when anonymous letters slipped into her locker suggest that she’s not alone, she slowly begins to (re)find her voice, courage, and rage. At the same time, she opens herself up to the possibilities of her attraction to the new girl at school.\n\nFeed Them Silence by Lee Mandelo (March 14)\n\nIn this near future novella by the author of Summer Sons, a scientist uses a neurological interface to translate to her own mind the inner workings of the brain belonging to one of the world’s last remaining wild wolves. On top of her academic curiosity, she yearns to experience full wolfishness: freedom, brutality, instinct, and pack belonging. But her growing obsession with her work soon threatens her relationship with her wife, as well as her own health and sanity.\n\nBlue Hunger by Viola Di Grado, Translated by Jamie Richards (March 14)\n\nNewly available in English, this novel was originally written in Italian but is set in Shanghai. It follows a young woman who leaves her hometown of Rome for Shanghai in the wake of her twin brother’s death, where he had dreamed of opening a restaurant. While working as an Italian teacher, she meets Xu, another young woman running from her family and her past. In the dark, liminal spaces of the city’s abandoned slaughterhouses and factories, the two women begin to meet regularly to devour each other.\n\nProud Pink Sky by Redfern Jon Barrett (March 14)\n\nA unique blend of utopia and dystopia, Proud Pink Sky takes place in an alternate historical world where the gay state of Berlin is a megacity of 24 million people. The novel tells the stories of two queer teen boys escaping the UK’s homophobia and a young mother from the heterosexual district who stumbles upon an enclave of the city’s forbidden trans residents. All three soon discover that there might be a civil war brewing in Berlin, despite it claiming to be a gay paradise.\n\nA Manual for How to Love Us by Erin Slaughter (March 14)\n\nThis debut collection of interlinked short stories focuses on women’s grief while shifting between realist and speculative modes. Set in the American South, the stories embrace wildness, absurdity, and primal instincts, queering the stereotype of the quiet, sad woman sitting with her grief at home. In one story, a woman slowly moves into her stained glass art; in another, a throuple discovers that one of them has mysteriously vanished.\n\nLucky in Lace by Melissa Brayden (March 14)\n\nOpposites attract in this lesbian romance about an uptight woman who runs a stationary store owner and the charismatic owner of a new sexy lingerie shop that opens up next door. Both women are running from something: Juliette is reeling after finding out her ex and friend have fallen for each other and Peyton is recovering from the consequences of a series of bad life choices. Can these two make it work?\n\nRavensong by Cayla Fay (March 14)\n\nA queer YA fantasy for fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Irish mythology, Ravensong is about Neve, a young warrior goddess devoted to fighting demons and guarding the gate to hell. Unfortunately, she’s still stuck in high school, waiting for her 18th birthday when she comes fully into her powers. When she — to her surprise — falls in love with a regular human girl named Alexandria, Neve learns that someone in hell is after her new girlfriend.\n\nEight Strings by Margaret DeRosia (March 14)\n\nOut in Canada mid March and hopefully more widely soon, this historical novel takes place in late 19th century Venice in the world of puppetry. The protagonist Francesca has dreamed of performing with eight string wooden marionettes, but the profession is open only to men. At first Francesca’s alter ego of Franco is for safety and to secure a puppetry apprenticeship, but the new identity turns out to be who Franco was meant to be all along. For fans of Sarah Waters!\n\nThe Accidental Bride by Jane Walsh (March 16)\n\nIn this queer historical romance set in the Regency period, prim and proper Grace is a lady’s companion without much hope for anything exciting in life before she meets Thea, a flamboyant botanist with whom Grace has one night of forbidden passion. When Grace’s lady runs off with Thea’s brother for a scandalous elopement, it’s up to Grace and Thea to go after them. As they travel together to Gretna Green, the two women discover how compatible they are despite their differences. Can they make a go of a real relationship?\n\nThe Fake by Zoe Whittall (March 21)\n\nZoe Whittall is one of my favorite writers and her latest novel about two strangers who are taken in by the same scammer looks so fascinating! Shelby is grieving the loss of her wife when she meets charming, charismatic Cammie, who is recovering from cancer, in a support group. But when Shelby meets Gibson, a recently divorced guy who has also been dating Cammie, the two realize that Cammie has been telling them vastly different versions of her life.
