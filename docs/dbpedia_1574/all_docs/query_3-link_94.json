        "text": "Meanwhile, queer mangaka have been publishing their works through small presses, underground publishers, and queer manga magazines for decades. Unfortunately, many of these were produced under limited quantities and under small publishers (that frequently folded) therefore a lot of this media is lost or hard to find. Even if you did manage to get a hold of this material, as an international reader unless you speak/read Japanese you might be hard pressed to read it. International publication is expensive, and publishers will typically only translate works that they believe will be commercially successful overseas. For this reason, it is much more common to find an English translation of some of the more mainstream shojo manga from the 1970s that we mentioned earlier than it is to find a gay romance manga from the 1980s.\n\nBecause of the boom in shojo manga in the 1970s, amateur manga artists began producing their own self-published manga, otherwise known as dōjinshi, that often featured their favorite male characters from anime and manga involved in queer relationships. Thanks to comic conventions, dōjinshi artists began to share and sell their artwork amongst other fans and artists. Spurred by this support, many of these dōjinshi artists would then move on to produce their own original series. In fact, narratives featuring romantic love between same-sex couples became so popular they evolved into their own specific, and prolific, genres of manga known as Yaoi (outdated), or \"Boy’s Love\" (current), and Yuri, or \"Girl’s Love,\" from the 1970s onwards.\n\nThe terms yaoi and Boy's Love/BL both refer to manga that follow sexual/romantic relationships between two male characters. However, as a rule, yaoi manga always feature sexually explicit material, while Boy's Love may or may not. Yaoi is largely considered an outdated term and has been primarily replaced with Boy's Love within recent years. These terms are not to be confused with shounen-ai, a genre that focuses on the romantic relationship between boys, which emerged in early shōjo magazines during the 1970s. Although shounen-ai is also an outdated subgenre and term.\n\nThe term \"Bara\" used to refer to gay manga written by and for gay men back in the 80s, but that term has since been deemed outdated and inaccurate. Instead, manga that is specifically written by and for gay men are currently referred to as \"geicomi\", \"gei manga\", or \"gay comics/manga\".\n\nMuch like American romance novels, which are often written by women for women, mainstream, widely available yaoi/Boy’s Love have traditionally been written and designed by female manga artists for female readers. That being said, there have been plenty of queer mangaka who have been publishing their works for years through smaller distributors. Now it is much more common for mainstream, commerically available Boy's Love and yuri manga to be written by and for queer readers of all ages and genders.\n\nGengoroh Tagame is a gay mangaka who has been publishing manga for queer magazines for decades. US manga readers are probably most familiar with his series, My Brother's Husband. For an inside scoop on gay manga and BL check out this transcript from the “Gay Comics Art Japan\" panel hosted by the Toronto Comic Arts Festival: TCAF 2015 – Gengoroh Tagame Talks Gay Manga, “Bara,” BL and Scanlation.\n\nYuri, or Girl’s Love, is an umbrella term referring to any manga that features sexual/romantic love between females. Unlike yaoi, the amount of sexually explicit material in yuri manga varies from story to story, with some narratives focusing solely on romance without any sex. This means that one yuri manga can be an innocent romance while another can feature sexually explicit material. Yet both titles would be put under the yuri genre.\n\nOften, Boy's Love and yuri manga are categorized as LGBTQ+ manga because they feature same-sex couples; however, most, if not all, modern Boy's Love and yuri manga focus strictly on the romance and sexual escapades of the leads and rarely, if ever, discuss queer issues or identity. Boy's Love and yuri protagonists seldom refer to themselves or their partners as homosexual, or gay, queer, lesbian, bisexual, etc., nor do they typically explore the realities of living life as a queer person. This has been changing over the years with new titles and new trends, but it's still something to keep in mind.\n\nTerms and categories are frequently changing and altering as both creators, readers, and booksellers try to figure out what the most appropriate terminology for their work is. These \"lines\" separating Boy's Love/Yuri from LGBTQ+ manga are mutable as mangaka will frequently cross over and work on whatever type of media suites their creative leanings.\n\n​Many critics have argued that Boy's Love and yuri manga only fetishize LGBTQ+ persons and relationships, while others argue that is is harmless escapist fun. We'll leave those discussions to the readers.\n\nJunko's hit series, Kiss Him, Not Me, follows an avid female Boy's Love fan, otherwise known as a fujoshi, as she fantasizes about relationships between her male classmates, even as they pursue her romantically. The series is an overexaggerated look into the mind of an overenthusiastic Boy's Love fan. On the other hand, Kaori Tsurutani's BL Metamorphosis presents a much calmer and more accessible exploration of why Boy's Love is so popular.\n\nNon-consensual sexual contact is a very common problem in older yoai, Boy's Love, and Shounen-ai. Rape, attempted rape, and other forms of non-consensual sexual assault appear frequently, most often between the main love interests. These issues were most prevalent with titles published more than 10-20 years ago, but they still pop up in modern publications from time to time.\n\nEiki Eiki's Love Stage!! is a prime example of this as it features instances where one of the love interests is both assaulted by his lover and, later, must be saved from assault by his lover. These instances of sexual assault are often fetishized in older yaoi manga, and this can be extremely problematic as it can normalize violence and assault. More often than not, overly sexualized Boy's Love will feature instances of assault or dubious consent that are played off, not addressed, or taken very seriously. Many recent Boy's Love series have been moving away from these tropes, but we thought it was important to acknowledge this major trope within the genre. There are plenty of Boy's Love romances that do not feature assault, such as 10 Dance by Inouesatoh or Given by Natsuki Kizu.\n\nTrue LGBTQ+ manga will discuss/address issues such as assault or living life as a queer person in a realistic/semi-realistic way. Boy's Love/Yuri tend to operate in a non-realistic, alternative setting and very seldom address real life issues. In its defense, sometimes this is exactly what readers are looking for. LGBTQ+ readers are acutely aware of the socio-political landscape that they live in, and sometimes they just want to read a story about a same-sex couple falling in love without the depressing stigma of reality.\n\nWhile there have been slow changes in the genre, for the most part, everyone can agree modern Boy's Love and yuri are pure, escapist fantasy. This is something to keep in mind while exploring LGBTQ+ manga.\n\nLGBTQ+ characters are not relegated solely to yaoi and yuri titles. There are plenty of anime and manga with narratives that revolve around, or feature, explicitly queer or queer-coded protagonists. These stories can explore queer identity or issues faced by members of the LGBTQ+ community, or might simply be an escapist fantasy starring queer characters.\n\nChiho Saito’s Revolutionary Girl Utena features an undoubtedly queer cast in both its manga and anime adaptation, and is one of the most well-known series to star a lesbian lead. Naoko Takeuchi’s Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon, one of the most famous manga/anime series of all time, is also known for its portrayal and acceptance of queer characters such as Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, a canonically out and proud lesbian couple. Takako Shimura’s slice-of-life manga series Wandering Son follows two fifth graders as they discover and come to terms with their own gender identities.\n\nDespite cultural and social discrimination, the production of manga featuring LGBTQ+ characters has seen a definite rise within the last 10 years or so. Manga like Kabi Nagata’s My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness, Gengoroh Tagame’s My Brother’s Husband, and Chii’s The Bride Was a Boy have gone a long way towards providing a variety of LGBTQ+-themed stories, and normalizing LGBTQ+ relationships and characters. Fumi Yoshinaga's series, What Did You Eat Yesterday?, which follows a gay couple living in modern day Tokyo, was nominated for the first ever Manga Taishō award in 2008 and won the 2019 Kodansha Manga Award.\n\nWith the constant influx of new manga available, we've done our best to put together an ongoing list of titles available within our collection. This list is updated periodically.\n\nFor more recommendations, don’t forget to check out #RainbowReading!"
