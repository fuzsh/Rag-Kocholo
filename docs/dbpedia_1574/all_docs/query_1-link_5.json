        "text": "Hellooo :)) I have had a traumatic night üòÇ. So I went out earlier with a friend to walk his dog and we were chatting, minding our own business when a seagull swoops down and tries to get a cat on the opposite side of the road. Ten seconds later this same seagull flies back around and dives at us!!! We ducked. We screamed. I am scarred.\n\nApparently this isn‚Äôt the first ‚Äúseagulls gone wild‚Äù incident either and, according to my friend, police were called earlier today because seagulls were just diving at people.\n\nSo yeah ‚Ä¶ I am never leaving my house again. The seagulls are rising up.\n\nAnyways, focusing on something not bird related, I am here today with a tag created by the amazing Virginia @ The Sassy Library in celebration of it being pride month. Thank you so much for the tag! If you go over to her post she has really cute graphics to go with the questions.\n\nRules:\n\nThank whoever tagged you and link to their blog post.\n\nLink to the original creator: The Sassy Library Fox! And please credit The Sassy Library Fox if you use (copy & paste) the artwork/ graphics.\n\nMatch books with the given prompts.\n\nTag as many people as you like!\n\nPost the rules and the list of prompts in your tag post.\n\n1.Female Strength: A book with a lesbian heroine\n\nFor this question I am going with Hannah from These Witches Don‚Äôt Burn by Isabel Sterling. She is an elemental witch dealing with a blood ritual interrupting her start of summer party, having to team up with her ex-girlfriend and crushing on the cute new ballerina.\n\n2.Cinnamon Roll: A book with an adorable gay character\n\nI swear I‚Äôm not just repeating books from my recent list of recommendations but Nick Bell from The Extraordinaries by T.J. Klune is such a sweet and adorable character you can‚Äôt help but love despite his flaws.\n\n3.Boys & Girls: A book with a bi rep done right\n\nI tho ught the bisexual representation in Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston was really well done, from Alex‚Äôs coming out and the realisation that making out with your highschool best friend isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúno homo‚Äù situation, to the overall chaotic bisexual energy he exudes throughout the novel.\n\nAnother is Queens of Geek by Jen Wilde. I haven‚Äôt read this yet but I have bought it recently and I‚Äôve heard it has some pretty good bisexual representation.\n\n4.The Body & The Soul: A book with a transgender character\n\nI sadly haven‚Äôt read any books with a transgender character yet. I have read the Magnus Chase trilogy by Rick Riordan where Alex Fierro is introduced but she‚Äôs a genderfluid character so I don‚Äôt know if that counts. (If you haven‚Äôt read that trilogy yet though, get on that).\n\nOne of my anticipated releases of this year though is Cemetety Boys by Aiden Thomas which comes out this September and I am 99.9% sure this features a transgender brujo who performs some sort of necromancy spell. I am definitely planning on reading this as soon as I can.\n\n5. We‚Äôre All Queer: A queer rep you‚Äôd love to see more often in books.\n\nI would really love to see more Aro/Ace characters in books both focusing on the characters sexuality and them coming to terms and realising this, but also books where the character is ace/aro and that is simply a fact about them that is represented while they‚Äôre also a magical chosen one or something.\n\nI also really want to see more f/f romances. I still feel like it‚Äôs always m/m books that are the most hyped which is great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I want that same energy with cute and adorable f/f romances. (This is something I am seeing more of though so I‚Äôm happy)\n\n6. All About Pronouns: A book with a non-binary character\n\nThere is a non-binary character in The Black Veins by Ashia Monet called Jamie who has purple hair and two mums and I there really wasn‚Äôt enough of them in the book. Overall this book wasn‚Äôt amazing but I had to appreciate the representation and how accurate and authentic the fictional teenagers felt.\n\n7. A Romantic Ace: A character that belongs to the aro/ace spectrum\n\nI haven‚Äôt read over many books where the characters are canonically on the aro/ace spectrum but one I really liked was Tash from Tash Hearts Tolstoy by Kathryn Ormsbee and I am really looking forward to reading about Georgia from Loveless by Alice Oseman which comes out soon.\n\nOther characters I really like include Neil Josten from All For the Game and Julian Blackthron from The Dark Artifices. These two are both demisexual however it‚Äôs never stated in exact words. I know in Neils case the author did say she wrote him as demisexual however at the time (early 2000‚Äôs) she never realised there was an exact name for it.\n\n8. One Big Family: A book that features lots of different LGBTQ+ reps\n\nI think Virginia said this too but I‚Äôm going with the Hearstopper graphic novels by Alice Oseman which has a big group of friends, the majority of who are LGBT+ and I love them all.\n\nI‚Äôve got the three released volumes of this graphic novel but I think I‚Äôm going to go back on Webtoons and catch up to the monthly updates.\n\n9. Sapphic Love: Your favourite f/f couple\n\nThese two aren‚Äôt from a book so I don‚Äôt know if it counts but I want to talk about them so I‚Äôm going with Avalance aka Sara Lance and Ava Sharpe from Legends of Tomorrow. Sara is a badass ex-assassin who has died many times and Ava is a clone and together they are the co-captains on a timeship.\n\nI love these too so much. I love this show so much. Go watch it if you haven‚Äôt already. It gets wierder and wilder with every season.\n\n10. Boys Love: Your m/m OTP\n\nAndrew Minyard and Neil Josten from All For the Game by Nora Sakovic.\n\nI‚Äôm trash for this series, this isn‚Äôt new information to anybody, but I really love the dynamic between these two and the fact that their relationship develops over several books which I personally don‚Äôt see happen often with LGBT+ couples.\n\n11. SIDE KICK: Your favourite LGBTQ+ side character.\n\nI read Chain of Gold by Cassandra Clare recently and I fell in love with many of the side characters so I‚Äôm including them all (except Charles, I don‚Äôt like him).\n\nMatthew Fairchild radiates chaotic bisexual energy and I am rooting for him and his happy ending, Alistair Carstairs deserves better and I‚Äôm hoping for that, Anna Lightwood is an icon who we should all bow down to, Thomas Lightwood is a sweetie who I‚Äôm hoping gets more page time in the future and together the two cousins cement the Lightwood family as the gayest of the shadowhunters.\n\n12. Stealing The Show: An LGBTQ+ side character couple that rocks your socks.\n\nNico di Angelo and Will Solace had only a handful of scenes in The Hidden Oracle by Rick Riordan and yet they were my favourite part of the book. Maybe this is just because Nico is one of my favourite characters but yeah ‚Ä¶\n\nAlso Gibby and Jasmine from The Extraordinaries by T.J. Klune were a highlight of thhe book.\n\n13. Strong Beliefs: An LGBTQ+ book that deals with religion.\n\n‚Ä¶ the Magnus Chase series and/or the Trials of Apollo series by Rick Riordan ???\n\nThis counts right? Norse gods. Greek gods. Various lgbt+ characters. I‚Äôm saying it counts.\n\n14. Rainbows Everywhere: A book with an unapologetic cover.\n\nAre these unapologetic? I don‚Äôt know but they‚Äôre cute.\n\n15. Future Generations: Your most anticipated LGBTQ+ release.\n\nI have many and I shall be talking about them tomorrow so for now all I‚Äôm going to say is that the fact that I haven‚Äôt read The Love Hypothesis by Laura Steven which features a genuis bisexual girl with a dog called Sirius makes me sad.\n\nI Tag (if you want, no pressure):\n\nDaria @ Bookaholics Therapy\n\nSabrina @ Notes From a Paper Plane Nomad\n\nBludgers and Broomsticks\n\nLauren @ Narrative Paradise\n\nEmme @ A Literary Latte\n\nAnybody else who wants to do this tag.\n\nDoing this tag has helped me de-stress after the whole seagull incident so once again a big thank you to Virginia, this was a lot of fun:) Thanks for reading and stay safe.\n\nElli xx"
