        "text": "See also: History of Afghanistan\n\nAfter the end of Taliban rule in 2001, a new national anthem was made for the \"New Afghanistan\". According to the 20th article of the new Afghan constitution,[2] it would have the names of the many ethnic groups of Afghanistan. It said the phrase \"Allāhu Akbar\" (\"God is the greatest\") had to be in it. After a competition, \"Millī Surūd\" was made the official national anthem in May 2006.\n\nAfter the Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021, it was replaced by \"This is the Home of the Brave\". However, in the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup between October and November, it was still played as the national anthem of Afghanistan. The flag of the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was also used.[3] The Islamic Republic anthem and flag were also used in the 2022 CAFA U-19 Futsal Championship.[4]\n\nHistorical use\n\nSimilar to Romania, Afghanistan has used a bunch of other anthems in the past. A lot of times is due to the government of Afghanistan changing many times. When the country was ruled by a king, two national anthems were used: \"Royal Salute\" and \"Grand Salute\". Then right when Afghanistan was no longer ruled by a king, a new national anthem was used, but only for five years. Soon after, Afghanistan became a socialist republic and a national anthem for that was used. But that came to an end in 1992, when Afghanistan became an Islamic state, so another anthem was used.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, the Taliban took control over most of Afghanistan and ruled most of the country until late 2001. This was when the United States started a war (against the Taliban and al-Qaeda) right after 9/11. The Taliban were the winners in that war, so as of August 2021, Afghanistan is an Islamic Emirate to this day, and \"This is the Home of the Brave\" is now the country's national anthem."
