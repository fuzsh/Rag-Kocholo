        "text": "The MINAR-I CHAKARI was a monumental, free standing Buddhist column erected high up on a mountain ridge 15km to the southeast of Kabul, Afghanistan. It collapsed in 1998, due to damage done by the Sowjet Red Army in the 1980s and finally a big earthquake. It had been built, as part of a Buddhist monastery, some time in the late first or early second century CE, hence in the time of the Kushan Empire. It was a unique piece of Gandhara architecture. In the summer of 1965, when I was a student of architecture at Stuttgart University, Germany, I spent a few months in Afghanistan and climbed up to the Minar twice. 1966-68 I wrote a first short monograph on the column as part of my final graduation from Stuttgart Univerity. In 1998, the SPACH team of Nancy Dupree asked me to write a concise paper on the Minar. It was published in the SPACH Newsletter 5, as well as in the SPACH Library Series 3, Peshawar 1999 (in English, Dari and Pashtoo). A newspaper clip and a review have been added. Finally, a number of pages of text and illustrations have been copied from : Gérard FUSSMAN, \"Kabul Buddhist Monuments\", Paris 2008 (Collège de France), 2 volumes. Here, the monument is discussed under the name \"Minar-e Chakri\"."
