        "text": "The National Anthem of the Republic of Afghanistan, also known as \"So Long as there is Earth and Heaven\", was the third national anthem of Afghanistan, when it transitioned into a unitary one-party republic. It was written by Afghan poet and activist Abdul Rauf Benawa, and it was set to music by Afghan painter, musician and film director Abdul Ghafur Breshna.\n\nThe previous anthem used before it was \"Grand Salute\" (لوی سلام), which was used until 1973 when the monarchy was overthrown.\n\nIn late April of 1978, the Saur Revolution (د ثور انقلاب) took place, in which the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) (د افغانستان د خلق دموکراټیک ګوند) overthrew the then-president Mohammed Daoud Khan (محمد داود خان) and had him executed. A socialist regime was successfully established, and a new national anthem was adopted.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nPashto original[]\n\nDari translation[]"
