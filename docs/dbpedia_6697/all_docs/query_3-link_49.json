        "text": "Bridgetown, Barbados: India coach Rahul Dravid warned his side will “not take Afghanistan lightly” in their second-round opener of the T20 World Cup in Barbados on Thursday.\n\nIndia were unbeaten in the initial pool phase as they advanced into Super Eights featuring two groups of four.\n\nAfghanistan, however, have also justified their billing as potential semifinalists.\n\nThey had already qualified for the Super Eights before an emphatic 104-run defeat by a rampant West Indies in St. Lucia on Monday in a clash of previously unbeaten teams, with Nicholas Pooran smashing 98 for the tournament co-hosts.\n\nBut Afghanistan did inflict an 84-run hammering upon New Zealand earlier in the competition.\n\nAnd with India having needed two Super Overs to see off Afghanistan in a T20 match in Bengaluru in January, Dravid is well aware of the challenge awaiting his players at the Kensington Oval.\n\n“We know Afghanistan is a very dangerous team in this format of the game,” former India batsman Dravid, 51 told a pre-match press conference on Wednesday. “They have shown that by their performances in this World Cup.\n\n“They might not have a lot of international experience in the other formats of the game, but a lot of their players do play in a lot of T20 leagues, more than in fact some of our players do.\n\n“So, certainly in this format they are not a team to be taken lightly. They are deservedly in the Super Eights.”\n\nMuch of Afghanistan’s success has been built on superb spin bowling, with Rashid Khan — who took four wickets for 17 runs against New Zealand in Guyana — leading the way.\n\nBut that same match also saw left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi take 4-17, with New Zealand dismissed for just 75.\n\n“They have a good bowling attack all round,” said Dravid. “Even their two pacers are quite experienced. Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq have both played a lot of cricket, they both swing the ball as well.\n\n“I think their bowlers are some of the most sought-after bowlers in this format across the world.\n\n“We understand that is going to pose a challenge to us and we are going to have to play well to counter that.”\n\nMeanwhile Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott insisted Pooran’s furious assault could yet benefit his side against India.\n\n“Pooran played a great knock,” said the former England batsman. “But other sides are going to have players of that calibre, who on their day can win matches like Pooran did. So, I think it’s a good thing that it’s happened.\n\n“We’ve learned lessons and we’re going to put that right starting tomorrow (Thursday).”\n\nTrott added the advent of T20 franchise cricket, spearheaded by the Indian Premier League, had led to improved relations between players that were “obviously very different from when I played.”\n\nBut the 43-year-old said the knowledge gained “works both ways.”\n\n“We had nine, 10 players at the IPL. They will be able to share their knowledge of Indian players, and they’ll be able to do the same with our players,” explained Trott. “That’s the current state of world cricket.\n\n“I think it’s in a good position, and it’s very healthy. And we’re in the middle of a World Cup and we’re in Barbados, so the world’s pretty good.”\n\nBARCELONA: Wout van Aert won the 10th stage of the Vuelta a España on Tuesday to seal a hat trick of victories on his debut in the Spanish Grand Tour.\n\nThe Belgian Visma-Lease a Bike rider worked with Quentin Pacher on the way to the finish in Galicia, with the French rider leading out but soon accepting defeat against the sprint king.\n\nAustralian Ben O’Connor keeps the overall lead from Primoz Roglic on a relaxed afternoon for the red jersey rider, as the peloton rolled in five-and-a-half minutes down on Van Aert.\n\nIt was a tricky 160 kilometer ride from Ponteareas to Baiona, with four categorized climbs, as the race moved north after Monday’s rest day.\n\n“It’s not too often that I can win when (my family) visits me on the race,” said Van Aert, 29, who celebrated with his loved ones after his victory.\n\n“It was my aim to be in the breakaway, I had a hard time to be honest on the first climb, I almost gave up, I had one more try at the top... for 50km we had to fight for a bit of a gap.”\n\nVan Aert is making his debut on the Vuelta after a disappointing Tour de France, when he was unable to secure any victories.\n\n“I have a versatile profile and when I get in a situation like this I have a chance,” he added.\n\nMidway through the stage the breakway finally got up the road and opened up a significant gap on the peloton, with O’Connor’s team Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale content to let them go as the group contained no general classification threats.\n\nVan Aert took off with around 30km to go and Pacher followed him to form a leading duo.\n\nGroupama-FDJ’s Pacher has never won a pro race and left up against Van Aert, the Frenchman clearly did not fancy his chances.\n\nWith 1.6km remaining he burst forward but Van Aert followed and waited on his back wheel, ready for his inevitable sprint triumph.\n\n“It’s not really easy to find a place to attack Wout because he is strong everywhere, so I tried to stay in his wheel and I just gave my best and didn’t think too much,” Pacher told Eurosport.\n\n“I can only be satisfied because I am beaten by a guy who was stronger.”\n\nUAE Team Emirates rider Marc Soler came in third to complete the day’s podium.\n\nO’Connor leads overall by three minutes 53 seconds from three-time winner Roglic.\n\nWednesday’s stage 11 takes riders on a 166.5km route starting and finishing in Galician town Padron.\n\nBARCELONA: Italy and the US have shown America’s Cup defender New Zealand they face a fight to the wire to retain the sailing trophy in the 37th edition of international sport’s oldest competition.\n\nEmirates Team New Zealand won the final preliminary regatta in Barcelona last week but were run extremely close by Italian team Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli before the Louis Vuitton Cup, which starts Thursday.\n\nThe competition will determine the challenger to face New Zealand in the America’s Cup proper in October, starting with two rounds of matches before a semifinal and final.\n\nNew Zealand will be involved in the group stage of racing but not the knockout rounds and this is their final chance to finesse their approach.\n\nTeams got their AC75 foiling boats on the water in official competition for the first time in the Barcelona regatta.\n\nNew Zealand triumphed in Bermuda in 2017 and then again in Auckland three years ago, hoping to become the first nation to lift the trophy in three consecutive finals since the US in 1987, 1988 and 1992.\n\n“We were expecting it to be tight and we were struggling to get the shifts right, but it’s going to be a close regatta,” said New Zealand skipper Peter Burling after his team’s tight victory over Italy last week.\n\n“It’s all about making sure you get the phases right and sailing the boat in the right places.\n\n“I think we were a little frustrated with how we sailed (in the final, but there’s) plenty to go back and have a look at afterwards.”\n\nItaly were penalized three times in the regatta final race against New Zealand which ultimately cost them.\n\nLuna Rossa, runners-up in the 2021 final, will have the chance to avenge those defeats on Thursday in their Louis Vuitton Cup opener, when they face New Zealand again.\n\n“Hats off to New Zealand, for a great race, but I’m very proud with the team,” said port helm Francesco Bruni.\n\n“I think we have a great boat, a great team, a great sailing team and I think it will be a very interesting America’s Cup.”\n\nThe America’s Cup began in 1851 when the boat America of the New York Yacht Club (NYYC) beat England’s Royal Yacht Squadron, with the trophy named after the vessel.\n\nRecord 30-time winners the US retained the cup until 1983, when Australia triumphed.\n\nNYYC American Magic just missed out on reaching the Barcelona regatta final but their boat is fast enough to challenge New Zealand and they earned a morale-boosting win over the defender on Sunday.\n\n“I think we’re still trying to figure out our strengths and weaknesses,” said skipper Terry Hutchinson.\n\n“The defender set a pretty hard mark, their boat’s very good and I think the Italians are equally as good but what you see is that all the teams are very close to each other and you’re not going to be able to spot anybody a lot of distance off the start line and expect to pass them.”\n\nIneos Britannia, Switzerland’s Alinghi Red Bull Racing and France’s Orient Express have some reasons for optimism despite struggling in the Barcelona regatta.\n\n“We only came out with two wins, but it felt very close to four, so I think there’s good momentum within the team and we’re just looking to build on that for the round robins,” said Britannia sailor Dylan Fletcher.\n\nFour-time Olympic sailing champion Ben Ainslie is the skipper of the British team, which is backed by billionaire Manchester United owner Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos Group.\n\nFrance won just once last week, by default after an issue onboard American Magic, but an even battle with Britain gave them hope.\n\n“The key is going to be the maneuvers and to be strong on the start, so we have to work more in the simulator and on the water with boat-handling too, in order to come back stronger,” said Orient Express sailor Kevin Peponnet.\n\nBeyond four-time winners New Zealand and the US Switzerland are the only other nation competing who have lifted the trophy, in 2003 and 2007.\n\nMADRID: Dani Olmo celebrated his delayed Barcelona debut with a goal to seal a 2-1 comeback victory at Rayo Vallecano in La Liga on Tuesday.\n\nThe Spain playmaker’s 82nd-minute strike helped Barcelona claim their third win from three matches under new coach Hansi Flick at the start of the season.\n\nBarca were unable to register Olmo with La Liga after signing him from RB Leipzig until earlier in the day and he made an instant impact after being brought on at Rayo’s Vallecas stadium.\n\nUnai Lopez sent Rayo ahead against a flat Barca in the first half but Olmo came on at the break and energised the Catalans, who levelled through Pedri before the new arrival struck the winner.\n\nRayo Vallecano, celebrating their centenary year, signed former Real Madrid playmaker James Rodriguez earlier in the week and he watched on from the presidential box as the capital club started strongly.\n\nThe hosts attacked with intent and got their reward when Jorge De Frutos drove forward on the right and crossed for Lopez, who finished with a low effort at the near post.\n\nRayo minimized Barcelona’s threat in the first half except for the odd occasion teenage star Lamine Yamal managed to work his magic.\n\nFlick hooked Ferran Torres at half-time and threw on Olmo for his debut, after he had missed their first two league matches waiting for Barcelona to get their finances in order to complete his registration.\n\nWith Olmo entering the fray he took up a central attacking midfield position, with Brazil winger Raphinha restored to the left flank.\n\nThe former Barca academy player quickly began to make his mark on proceedings and the Catalans started to generate chances.\n\nPolish veteran Robert Lewandowski should have levelled but could not get a solid touch close to goal on Raphinha’s dangerous cross.\n\nRaphinha whistled a free-kick narrowly wide and Olmo smashed a 30-yard drive against the crossbar.\n\nBarca made the pressure count and Pedri levelled on the hour mark after exchanging passes with Raphinha and sweeping home.\n\nBarca thought they had a second 10 minutes later, when Yamal’s shot was saved and Lewandowski worked room to tuck the rebound home.\n\nHowever the goal was controversially disallowed after a VAR referral when the referee deemed Jules Kounde guilty of a foul, when he made light contact with Pep Chavarria’s foot in the build-up.\n\nThe visitors did not lick their wounds for too long, maintaining the pressure, and Olmo finished with aplomb after Yamal set him up.\n\nBarcelona played with an energy in the second half which has often been missing late in games in recent years, with the team appearing notably fitter under Flick.\n\nThe victory guarantees Barca will top the table after the third round of matches, despite various injury issues affecting important players including Gavi, Frenkie de Jong and Ronald Araujo.\n\nChampions Real Madrid visit Las Palmas on Thursday while Atletico Madrid host Espanyol on Wednesday, among other fixtures.\n\nNEW YORK: Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek survived US Open first round wobbles on Tuesday as two-time champion Naomi Osaka made a tearful and colorful return to Flushing Meadows.\n\nSinner fought back from a set and break down to defeat Mackenzie McDonald in his first match since being embroiled in a doping test controversy.\n\nFellow world number one and 2022 US Open champion Swiatek saw off 104th-ranked Kamilla Rakhimova but only after having to save three set points in the second set.\n\nItalian Sinner battled to a 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 win over his 140th-ranked opponent on Arthur Ashe Stadium, racing away with 18 of the last 22 games.\n\nThe 23-year-old was returning to action just a week after it was revealed he had failed two drug tests in March.\n\nHowever, he escaped a lengthy ban from the sport when officials decided he wasn’t at fault for the presence of banned anabolic agent clostebol in his system.\n\n“I was a little bit not in the best way,” said Sinner of his victory.\n\n“The first match is not easy. He played really well in the beginning so I just tried to stay there mentally and find some rhythm to keep going.”\n\nFrench Open champion Swiatek, chasing a second New York title to add to her four triumphs in Paris, saw off Russian lucky loser Rakhimova 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) to extend her season-leading record to 54 match wins.\n\nHowever, it was an unconvincing display by the Pole who committed 41 unforced errors and had to fight off three set points in the second set.\n\n“I try to adapt to the court and feel how it is,” said Swiatek.\n\n“I’ll take it day by day to get more rhythm. It’s the biggest stadium we have and you feel it’s a huge deal.”\n\nOsaka, who missed last year’s tournament after giving birth to her daughter Shai, stunned 10th seed Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nFormer world number one Osaka, now ranked 88, came through 6-3, 6-2 for her first top 10 win in four years.\n\nThe Japanese star crunched nine aces in her 19 winners and committed just five unforced errors to her opponent’s 21.\n\nHer tennis was as striking as her outfit. Osaka arrived in court with a brightly-colored, giant bow on the back of her jacket and a frilly skirt over her playing dress.\n\nTo complete the ensemble, the 26-year-old attached small bows to the heels of both shoes.\n\n“Last year I was watching Coco (Gauff) play and I so badly wanted to step on these courts again,” said a tearful Osaka, a four-time major winner.\n\n“I didn’t know if I could ... just to win this match and just to be in this atmosphere means so much to me.”\n\nOsaka’s fellow tennis mum Caroline Wozniacki, runner-up to Serena Williams 10 years ago, needed just 53 minutes to see off Japan’s Nao Hibino 6-0, 6-1.\n\nDaniil Medvedev, the Russian fifth seed who shattered Novak Djokovic’s dream of a rare calendar Grand Slam by claiming the 2021 US Open, went through with a four-set victory over Dujan Lajovic of Serbia.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, who won the first of his four Grand Slam titles in New York in 2022, opens the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium against Australian qualifier Li Tu, the world number 186.\n\nAlcaraz is on a 14-match winning streak in Grand Slam events and is attempting to become the only third man in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open in the same year after Rod Laver in 1969 and compatriot Rafael Nadal in 2010.\n\nLi, 28, hasn’t won a match on the main tour in 2024.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, 2021 semifinalist Felix Auger-Aliassime, the 19th seed, slipped to a straight-sets loss to Jakub Mensík of the Czech Republic.\n\nGreek 11th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has never made the second week at the US Open, was stunned 7-6 (7/5), 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 by Australia’s Thanasi Kokkinakis.\n\nFourth seed Elena Rybakina, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, enjoyed a 6-1, 7-6 (7/1) win over 194th-ranked Australian qualifier Destanee Aiava.\n\nStan Wawrinka, the 2016 winner, aims to become the third man in last 50 years to win a main draw match at the tournament at the age of 39 or over after a 40-year-old Jimmy Connors in 1992 and Ken Rosewall — who was 42 when he achieved the feat in 1977."
