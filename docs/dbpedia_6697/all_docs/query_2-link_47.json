According to article 20 of the Afghan constitution, the national anthem shall be in Pashto with the mention of \"God is Greatest\" as well as the names of the various tribes of Afghanistan. The lyrics were written by Abdul Bari Jahani and the music was written by German-Afghan composer Babrak Wassa."
