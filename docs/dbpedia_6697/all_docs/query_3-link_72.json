        "text": "At our second set of panel discussions, attendees heard from a diverse group of women leaders, from across various sectors, who are committed to the cause of religious freedom. The panel discussion “Women and Religious Liberty” included Dr. Katrina Swett (Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice), Dr. Sabrina Dent (BJC), Ms. Hurunnessa Fariad (Multi-Faith Neighbors Network), Dr. Tschika McBean Okosi (United States Bahá’í Office of Public Affairs), and Ms. Wai Wai Nu (Women's Peace Network). Ambassador Suzan Johnson Cook, the first Black and female U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom at large, moderated the panel discussion. #ReligiousLiberty2024 “Global events continue to confirm the vital importance of defending freedom of religion, conscience, and belief in every corner of the world. This wellspring human right is foundational to many other precious rights including freedom of speech, freedom of association, and a free press. It is often women who are on the front lines, fighting for religious liberty and when it is denied, they pay the price. Defending religious liberty requires both vision and vigilance. Brave women everywhere are equal to the task.” -Dr. Katrina Swett, The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice \"Depolarizing religious freedom in America requires that we take a critical look at history and understand who has been privileged in the pursuit or protection of it. Ultimately, religious freedom is a justice issue that unearths questions about who has power, agency, and the right to be human.\" -Dr. Sabrina Dent, BJC Center for Faith, Justice and Reconciliation “Along with your own faith tradition, religious freedom advocacy is supposed to include those who don’t see God like you, who don’t pray like you, and whose values don’t align with yours. Anything less would be considered self-serving.” -Ms. Hurunnessa Fariad, Multi-Faith Neighbors Network “FoRB is a foundational human right, and when this right is denied, especially to the most vulnerable sectors of our society, countless victims experience severe persecution. Women face unique challenges simply because of their gender. It's crucial that the double marginalization they experience is brought into conversations and uniquely addressed. Their strength and ingenuity in response to their own persecution must also be highlighted.” -Dr. Tschika McBean Okosi, United States Baháʼí Office of Public Affairs “The challenges that women face when religious freedoms are violated is unique. Often it is not discussed. When we address religious violations or conflicts, sometimes it can be crimes against humanity or even genocide. We have undermined or overlooked some of the issues and the situations that women uniquely face. When women have a voice at the table, it is incredibly impactful to avoid undermining the understanding of religious freedom and how to address it.\" -Ms. Wai Wai Nu, Women’s Peace Network"
