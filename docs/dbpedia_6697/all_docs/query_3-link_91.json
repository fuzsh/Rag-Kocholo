        "text": "The delegates complained about the food. They ridiculed the man running the meeting. They even criticized the warlords in the front row.\n\nInside an air-conditioned white tent that billowed gently in the wind, Afghan democracy took a baby step forward today.\n\nIn the first day of open debate in the loya jirga, or grand council, to select a transitional government, the 1,551 delegates proved Afghans could be as adept in debate as on the battlefield; they raucously argued over issues ranging from poverty to the national anthem to ceremonial titles for the king.\n\nAfter two decades of Soviet occupation, civil war and Taliban oppression, Afghan leaders were freely expressing their political ambitions without the aid of guns. To many, it seemed a revelation.\n\nThe loya jirga ''is an exercise in voice,'' said Ashraf Ghani Ahmedzai, senior adviser to the interim president, Hamid Karzai. ''The people of Afghanistan are acquiring voice for the first time in 23 years.''\n\nWith that free expression, they did not get much work done. By the end of a very long day, the delegates had covered less than half their agenda, succeeding only in casting ballots for the five-member panel that will run the rest of the proceedings this week. Selection of the head of state was postponed until Thursday; three people, including Mr. Karzai, are competing for the position.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
