        "text": "A mother. A daughter. Three possible dads. And a trip down the aisle you’ll never forget! Set on a Greek island paradise where the sun always shines, a tale of love, friendship, and identity is beautifully told through the timeless hits of ABBA. On the eve of her wedding, a daughter’s quest to discover the father she’s never known brings three men from her mother’s past back to the island they last visited decades ago. MAMMA MIA! is the ultimate feel-good show.\n\nJoin us for the TAKE THE LEAD® Power Up Concert TOGETHER WE LEAD. A joyful celebration of music in pursuit of advancing women’s leadership which includes performances by world-renowned pianist and composer MARINA ARSENIJEVIC, Indie Pop Band BETTY, and three-time Grammy Award nominated female a'cappella group SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK® who express their history as black women through song and sign language.\n\nSpecial Appearance by Lynda Carter.\n\nNo Trick Pony is a true D.C. power-trio. Featuring keyboardist/vocalist Amy K Bormet, drummer Keith Butler Jr., and tenor saxophonist Brian Settles, the group presents a unique sound of song, poetry, melody, and harmony above a quiet tornado of groove. Though each member is steeped in streams of traditionally defined music—jazz, popular music, punk, classical, to name a few—No Trick Pony deconstructs the strict barriers of genre to explore the effortless shift between composition and improvisation. One night only!\n\nBen Folds’ popular late-night series returns with iconic Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob Thomas, Grammy®-winning singer Madison Cunningham, and acclaimed acoustic fingerstyle guitarist Yasmin Williams! This “part-party, part-concert” also features Max Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight” and more modern masterworks by Valerie Coleman, Jessie Montgomery, and Carlos Simon.
