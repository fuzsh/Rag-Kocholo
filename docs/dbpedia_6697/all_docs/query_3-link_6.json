        "text": "‘Pāk Sarzamīn’, which translates to ‘Thy Sacred Land’ in English, became Pakistan’s official national anthem in 1954 after the country gained independence in 1947.\n\nPakistan as it exists today is one of the world’s youngest, yet most populous countries. Situated in South Asia and bordering India, Afghanistan, Iran and China, the land on which Pakistan sits as a modern state has a rich history and culture dating back at least eight and a half thousand years.\n\nFrom 1858, Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, gaining independence in 1947 after the Pakistan Movement campaigned for a home for Muslims in British India. An official constitution followed in 1956, and in 1971 Bangladesh emerged as a new country from what had been East Pakistan.\n\nSoon after Pakistan’s newfound independence, a search was launched for a piece of music to become the new country’s national anthem. The successful lyricist and composer would receive 5,000 rupees each, according to an ad published in June 1948.\n\nPresumably, however, the search was unsuccessful, as in December of that year the National Anthem Committee (NAC) was set up by the Pakistani government, and tasked with the creation of an original national anthem.\n\nRead more: What are the lyrics to India’s national anthem?\n\nProgress was slow, and by the time of the Indonesian President’s state visit to Pakistan in January 1950, the country remained without a national anthem. The government urged the NAC to procure a national anthem in time for the Shah of Iran’s visit later that year.\n\nAfter a search far and wide, the NAC picked out a melody written by composer Ahmed G. Chagla, which was accepted on 21 August 1950 as the tune to Pakistan’s official national anthem.\n\nFor some time, the anthem was used in an instrumental version until suitable words could be found. The NAC sent recordings to some of the most prominent Pakistani poets, as a call-out for the anthem’s lyrics.\n\nSeveral hundred songs were received in return, and the words of Hafeez Jalandhari were ultimately selected. The national anthem was broadcast with both words and music for the first time on 13 August 1954, on Radio Pakistan, sung by the lyricist himself.\n\nRead more: What are the lyrics to Bangladesh’s national anthem?\n\nWhat are the lyrics to Pakistan’s national anthem?\n\nHafeez Jalandhari wrote his lyrics in Urdu – the official language of Pakistan – but used words that are shared in the Persian language too, so that speakers of both languages are able to understand the anthem.\n\nThe lyrics in (Roman) Urdu, and their English translation are as follows:\n\nPaak sar zameen shaad baad\n\nKishwari haseen shaad baad\n\nToo nishaani azmi aalee shaan\n\nArzi Paakistaan!\n\nMarkazi yaqeen shaad baad\n\nPaak sar zameen kaa nizaam\n\nQuwwati ukhuwwati awaam\n\nQaum, Mulk, Saltanat\n\nPaayindah taabindah baad!\n\nShaad baad manzili muraad\n\nParcami sitaarah o hilaal\n\nRahbari taraqqee o kamaal\n\nTarjumaani maazee shaani haal\n\nJaani istaqbaal!\n\nSaayahyi Khudaayi Zoo al-jalaal\n\nEnglish translation\n\nBlessed be the sacred land,\n\nHappy be the bounteous realm.\n\nThou symbol of high resolve,\n\nO Land of Pakistan!\n\nBlessed be the citadel of faith.\n\nThe order of this sacred land,\n\nThe might of the brotherhood of the people,\n\nMay the nation, the country, and the state,\n\nShine in glory everlasting!\n\nBlessed be the goal of our ambition."
