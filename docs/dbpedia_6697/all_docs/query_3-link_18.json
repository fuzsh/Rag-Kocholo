        "meta_description": "As Turkey’s ruling elite founded a nation from the collapsed Ottoman Empire in the early 1920s, competitions for the Turkish national anthem’s lyrics and musical setting did not immediately yield clear winners. The original winning composition by Ali Rıfat Çağatay draws on Ottoman-era musical and literary conventions; however, the anthem was redacted six years after selection and replaced in 1930 by the current national anthem by Osman Zeki Üngör, a work iconic of European anthems yet infamous for its “broken” prosody. The anthem’s prosodic errors and enigmatic selection process have fueled national debates since its adoption. I argue that the Turkish ruling elite’s selection of a national anthem reflects the challenges of a broader nation-building project premised on rejecting a presumed Ottoman past and oriented towards the modernity associated with the imagined West. More broadly, I assert that understanding the anthem genre requires interrogating the Eurocentrism of non-European anthems that would seem to seek to emulate European exemplars. Exploring nearly a century of anthem controversies in Turkish media and film illuminates how prosodic errors have served as an innocuous proxy for politically sensitive topics, including tensions over religion in public life and governance as well as the Turkey-US relationship since the Cold War. On the other hand, the many-layered meanings within the anthem as well as its iconicity of the nation have enabled those acting in the name of the state to deploy the anthem as a tool of violent state coercion to discipline nonconforming subjects.",

        "text": "As the Turkish War of Independence against the Allied Powers of World War I ended and Turkey’s ruling elite established the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the new nation’s Ministry of Education struggled to select the words and music that would represent the ideals of the new country born out of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. After Turkey’s founding, a series of nation-wide competitions for the Turkish national anthem’s lyrics and musical setting elicited hundreds of submissions, and the official selection was a contentious process which did not immediately yield a clear winner. Even after the Ministry selected Mehmet Akif [Ersoy]’s poem “İstiklal Marşı” (“Independence March”) for the anthem’s lyrics in 1921, debates over which musical setting would prevail ensued for the following decade.1 Composer Ali Rifat [Çağatay]’s anthem was officially chosen in 1923, yet various other anthem renditions circulated in different cities of Turkey. The circumstances under which Ali Rifat’s anthem was replaced with composer Osman Zeki [Üngör]’s anthem remain obscured in the historical record; primary sources from this period are limited and scholarly accounts brush over the six years between Ali Rifat’s anthem’s selection and replacement with Osman Zeki’s, whose clumsy melodic breaks dividing the lyric’s text into nonsensical pseudowords feature conspicuously. Although Osman Zeki’s rendition, with its infamously awkward prosody, continues to mark graduation ceremonies and football matches alike, it also has fueled many politicized waves of debate.\n\nThis article recounts the commission and composition of the lyrics and music of the Turkish national anthem while also illustrating inconsistencies in their historical narrativization. In the absence of archival records offering a definitive explanation for the anthem change, I suggest that the compositional and prosodic choices of anthem composers Ali Rifat and Osman Zeki reflect the newly formed Turkish government’s concurrent efforts to direct the socio-cultural trajectory of the nation. I argue that the selection by the Turkish ruling elite (namely Grand National Assembly speaker and future Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his ministers) of a national anthem iconic of European anthems was part of a broader nation-building project oriented towards attaining a Eurocentric modernity. Moreover, interrogating the anthem as a genre reveals the interpenetrations and mutual influences that animate imaginations of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey, Europe, and the West. Thus, the enigmatic circumstances of the national anthem’s selection as well as debates over its compositional merits have mediated broader sociopolitical conflicts since the nation’s founding, particularly as different political factions have asserted conflicting visions of national values.\n\nThe anthropologist David I. Kertzer has observed that “nations can be perceived by only symbolic means,” including the use of collective rituals that stimulate powerful emotions, such as the singing of national anthems: “What is instructive about these songs is not their content per se, but rather their use of martial music together with graphic symbolism to create a highly charged emotional atmosphere of national solidarity.”2 He notes, however, that the manipulation of symbols through dramatically changing their context can promote a particular view of the political order or alternatively introduce ambiguities that engender conflict over their meanings.3 Exploring nearly a century of public debates about the anthem in Turkish media and film illuminates broader political tensions over the role of religion in public life and governance as well as Turkey’s alliance with the US since the Cold War. An examination of these long-standing contentions can reveal how the anthem has served as a mediating discursive realm for sociopolitical issues and national ideals in Turkey. As political circumstances have increasingly rendered explicit discussions of national identity fraught, prosodic errors have served as an innocuous proxy for politically sensitive topics in public discourse. On the other hand, those acting in the name of the state have drawn upon how the anthem emblematized the nation; utilizing the layered and contested meanings of belonging it indexes, such actors have deployed it as a tool of violent state coercion to discipline nonconforming subjects.\n\nNational anthems have garnered scholarly interest since the late 1980s. Benedict Anderson cited national anthem singing as a “unisonance,” an instance of people uttering the same verses to the same melody, which generates an experience of community.4 Musicological scholarship on national anthems has examined composition, music and text, performance, and public reception, frequently interrogating how anthems shed light on the complexities of nation-building and national identity. Some of these examples emphasize the influences on national anthems of composers and musical styles not indigenous to those countries.5 Thomas Turino and Martin Daughtry both offer approaches to studying musical nationalism through anthems that probe Eurocentric and capitalist ideological agendas that shape representations of “the nation,” particularly in non-European contexts.6 Robert Neustadt’s approach to anthems as “sonograms” of national development which “reveal images of identity in formation” echoes Daughtry’s understanding of national identity “not as the static reflection of a monolithic ideology but rather as a polysemous text through which national identity is constantly being negotiated.”7 National anthems provide an ideal opportunity to analyze genre as an assemblage, as “a mutual mediation between two self-organising historical entities—musical formations (on the one hand), and social identity formations (on the other)—both in the process of becoming, both reliant on the collective production of memory as well as the anticipation of futures.”8 I assert that creating the Turkish national anthem (and the broader curation of Turkish national identity) has not been a unidirectional Turkish reaction to an imagined West, as is often represented in scholarship on Turkish nation-building; indeed, the national anthem genre was born out of centuries of Ottoman and European war and peacetime encounters. Understanding anthems as a genre requires interrogating not only European exemplars, but also the apparent Eurocentrism of those non-European anthems that are thought to emulate them. Contestations over the many-layered meanings and associations within the Turkish national anthem (and ideas of an “anthem” itself) reveal long-standing contentions over national identity, particularly in relation to discourse around the Republic’s orientation to its Ottoman past and imaginations of the West.\n\nIn the sections that follow, I consider how the broad social reforms to regulate “national music” in Turkey resonated in the national anthem’s creation. Acknowledging substantial gaps in official and scholarly records, I then describe the national anthem’s commission and selection process, considering the sociopolitical pressures that appear likely to have motivated the replacement of Ali Rifat’s anthem with Osman Zeki’s. The following section offers a comparative examination of Ali Rifat’s and Osman Zeki’s musical settings of the lyrics as well as reflection on how the ultimate selection of the latter reflects the sociopolitical upheaval that resulted from Turkish nation-building efforts. The final section demonstrates how contentions over national values found a proxy in debates over the national anthem’s composition and selection. Analyzing archival sources drawn from Turkish film and media over the decades since the nation’s founding uncovers how broader anxieties about sociopolitical issues and national values emerge through engaging with controversies over the national anthem. Ultimately, the long-standing contentions over the anthem’s composition and selection demonstrate its potency as a symbol of the Turkish nation; as such, controversies over the anthem bring to the fore deeply seated struggles to shape notions of Turkish citizenship.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, I have suggested that creating a national anthem was an effort that paralleled the authoritarian means by which many other social reforms were swiftly implemented in the nascent Turkish Republic. Both the selection of the poem by the competition’s non-entrant Mehmet Akif for the lyrics as well as the enigmatic overturning of Ali Rifat’s anthem in favor of Osman Zeki’s insinuates underlying conflicts among the Turkish ruling elite about how to represent the nation. Regulation and creation of musical traditions in Turkey became one outlet for such contentions. Ali Rifat’s anthem sought to satisfy the demands of a Turkish national anthem through relying on conventions of Turkish music, drawing on centuries-old prosodic methods of linking music and language through aruz and usul. This rendition, although compatible with aspects of Western classical music compositional principles, gave prominence to the text and to some evoked the sound of Ottoman Janissary bands. In the context of the sweeping and forcefully enacted reforms Atatürk and his government ushered into nearly every dimension of social life, the national anthem became another site to publicly demonstrate a shift away from the Ottoman ruling system and its associated cultural values.\n\nI have argued that the anthem was just as much intended as a means of sounding a modern, autonomous, Western-oriented nation on the international stage as it was meant to rally its own citizens; to this end, the emergent pseudowords were a secondary concern to presenting a legitimately Western-style march. The leadership prioritized a musical setting which undermines the intelligibility of the lyrics while more closely resembling the anthems of the nations with which Turkey had just warred and bested to win its independence after World War I. As a result, Turkish emulation of an imagined West through anthem choice contributed to the normativization of a conceptual Eurocentric modernity. This approach suggests that, particularly in the Turkish context, dominant ideas of an anthem (and the nation for which it is perceived to stand) are not simply non-European replicas of a European model; rather, I suggest bringing contestations of the model to the fore and seeking out the interpenetrations and mutual influences inherent in the very model itself. The waves of debate around the anthem, more of which seem sure to emerge in the years to come, offer a compelling indication of how the meeting of words and music in anthems can reveal the ongoing negotiations and contestations from which a nation emerges.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am grateful for conversations with Martin Brody, Oktay Üst, and Onur Öner which enriched this research.
