        "text": "Afghanistan's Education Ministry is facing fierce criticism for banning girls over 12 years of age from singing the national anthem in mixed gender gatherings.\n\nThe order, dated March 6, came to light Wednesday when someone took a picture of the notice circulated to educational institutions and posted it on social media.\n\nThe Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), the nations official human rights body, called it a violation of children's rights, the constitution, and international conventions.\n\n“The right to education, freedom of expression and access to artistic skills is a fundamental right of all children, without discrimination based on age or sex. All boys and girls can enjoy their rights equally and freely within the law,” AIHRC said on its official Twitter account.\n\nRoya Ahmedi, a 17-year-old high school student in Kabul, is a member of her high school’s band.\n\n“When I heard this news from social media, it was very disappointing for me because this decision was taken by an organization where a woman is the determiner (decision maker),” she said.\n\nShe was referring to Afghanistan’s Acting Education Minister Rangina Hamidi.\n\nAhmedi added that one’s “vision and whatever we love” was far more important than one’s gender.\n\n“I love to be the women’s sound,” she said.\n\nSocial media in Afghanistan was full of criticism over the decision. One Twitter user, Marjan Mateen, uploaded a 2019 clip of schoolgirls singing the national anthem in a grand ceremony. Joining them on stage were several rows of men in uniform.\n\n“We failed you! I am sorry,” Mateen’s tweet said.\n\nDr. Ahmad Sarmast, founder of Afghanistan National Institute of Music, said the announcement “shocked the nation.”"
