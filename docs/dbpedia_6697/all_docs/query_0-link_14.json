        "text": "Article 20 of Afghanistan’s constitution (adopted in January 2004) states that the National Anthem of Afghanistan shall be in Pashto, mention “Allahu Akbar” (God is Great), and the names of the ethnic groups of Afghanistan. Having the national anthem in the Pashto language was initially met with some resistance by other ethnic groups whose language was not Pashto. Some lawmakers and politicians argued that the anthem should be in Dari (Afghan Persian) as it is the lingua franca of the country, spoken by up to 80% of the population. Others wanted the anthem to be only an instrumental without any lyrics, in order to avoid ethnic and even religious strife. In the end, it was agreed that the anthem would be in Pashto, however, a requirement was put in that requires the listing of other ethnic groups in the country. By doing this, it created an anthem that was somewhat more inclusive, as most of the ethnic groups are listed, however, the anthem doesn’t actually mention all the ethnic groups. For example, minor ethnic groups, such as the Sikhs, are not mentioned in the anthem.\n\nAfghanistan’s current national anthem was approved by the Afghan President and the Loya Jirga in May 2006.\n\nLyrics by Abdul Bari Jahani\n\nMusic by Babrak Wasa.\n\nLyrics to the National Anthem\n\nPashto\n\nدا وطن افغانستان دی دا عزت د هر افغان دی\n\nکور د سولی کور د توری هر بچی یی قهرمان دی\n\nدا وطن د تولو کور دی د بلوچو د ازبکو\n\nد پښتون او هزارهوو د ترکمنو د تاجکو\n\nورسره عرب، ګوجر دی پامیریان، نورستانیان\n\nبراهوی دی، قزلباش دی هم ایماق، هم پشه ییان\n\nدا هیواد به تل ځلیږی لکه لمر پرشنه آسمان\n\nپه سینه کی د آسیا به لکه زړه وی جاویدان\n\nنوم د حق مودی رهبر\n\nوایو الله اکبر وایو الله اکبر وایو الله اکبر\n\nTransliteration\n\nDaa watan afghanistan do daa ezzat de har afghan di\n\nKor de soli kor de tori har bachi ye qahraman di\n\nDaa watan di tolo kor di de balocho, de uzbako\n\nDe pashtoon aw hazarwoo de turkmano de tajeko\n\nWorsara arab, gojar di pamirian, noristanian\n\nBarahawi di, qizilbash di ham aimaq, ham pashaiyean\n\nDaa hiwad ba til zaligi laka limar pa eshna aasman\n\nPa sina ki de asia laka zera wi jawidan\n\nNoom de haq mo di rahbar\n\nWayoo Allah o Akbar, Wayoo Allah o Akbar, Wayoo Allah o Akbar\n\nTranslation\n\nThis land is Afghanistan – It is the pride of every Afghan\n\nThe land of peace, the land of the sword – Its sons are all brave\n\nThis is the country of every tribe – Land of Baluch, and Uzbeks\n\nPashtoons, and Hazaras – Turkman and Tajiks with them,\n\nArabs and Gojars, Pamirian, Nooristanis\n\nBarahawi, and Qizilbash – Also Aimaq, and Pashaye\n\nThis Land will shine for ever – Like the sun in the blue sky\n\nIn the chest of Asia – It will remain as the heart for ever\n\nWe will follow the one God\n\nWe all say, Allah is great, we all say, Allah is great, we all say, Allah is great\n\nRelated\n\nPrevious National Anthem"
