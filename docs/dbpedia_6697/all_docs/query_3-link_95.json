Eliot Engel (chairman of the committee) presiding. Mr. Sherman [presiding]. The committee will come to order. The chairman's staff has asked me to sit in for a bit. Without objection, all members will have 5 days to submit statements, extraneous materials, and questions for the record, subject to length limitations in the rules. Pursuant to notice, we are here today to examine the lessons from America's war effort in Afghanistan. Inspector General Sopko, welcome to the Foreign Affairs Committee. I look forward to learning the lessons of Afghanistan, but also getting some input as to what we should do in the future. Our casualties in Afghanistan over the last 6 years have averaged roughly ten. We mourn those deaths; we take them seriously. But compared to the other conflicts we are engaged in, compared to the training deaths we suffer in our military, we cannot have the exhaustion of 10 years ago blind us to what is the operation now and what is its cost. I know the chairman has an opening statement, but I will first recognize the ranking member, then I will recognize our witness for his opening statement, and hopefully by then we will hear the chairman's opening statement. Mr. McCaul. Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, pro tem. The United States has been in Afghanistan for almost 19 years. It is the longest war in the history of the United States. We sacrifice much on the battlefield, but we have also achieved a great deal. We decimated al-Qaida and greatly weakened their global network. As a result, Afghanistan has not been the staging ground for another successful attack against our homeland. After the 9/11 terror attacks, it was clear that our approach to foreign threats and intelligence efforts needed to change. We could no longer sit back and wait while our enemies plotted attacks thousands of miles away. We needed to go on the offense, and we did. Our presence in the region allowed us to capture Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, kill Osama bin Laden, and, more recently, remove his son Hamza from the battlefield. I visited Ambassador Crocker there many times and saw firsthand the challenges we faced and the opportunities we had to succeed. We have led the charge on other important issues as well beyond those on the battlefield. They include supporting democracy and women's rights, countering the drug trade, developing the private sector, promoting economic growth, fighting corruption, stabilizing former Taliban-controlled districts, among others, and this type of work does not always make the news, but it is vital to our future and our security. But unfortunately, there have been many costly missteps. We know about these missteps because of the important work performed by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Since 2001, the United States has spent an estimated $132 billion on development assistance. One hundred and thirty-two billion. SIGAR has found that much of this money was wasted, stolen, or failed to address the problems it was meant to fix. This is clearly not the best use of American tax dollars. For example, we have spent nine billion on counternarcotics programs, yet today Afghanistan is the largest producer of opium, which finances our enemies. How is it possible that after two decades, billions of dollars spent, and thousands of lives lost, we still cannot slow drug production? Our efforts in counternarcotics have clearly failed. We have also learned that our strategy to build an Afghan army and police force has not made the security situation any better. A lack of coordination, the misuse of funds, and insufficient training for Afghans has failed to reduce violence across the country. This is completely unacceptable. And the publication of the Afghanistan Papers in the Washington Post last month serves as a sober reminder of our past mistakes and underscores the importance of the Trump Administration's efforts to end this war. The American people have been very patient with our involvement. We have sacrificed greatly. In fact, two American soldiers lost their lives in an attack this weekend. We owe it to them and to others who have served to finally get this right. We need to step back and learn from the mistakes we have made. SIGAR's Lessons Learned Program initiated in 2014 offers key insights into the complex challenges we face. These evaluations provide opportunities for Congress and the executive branch to prevent the same mistakes from happening again in Afghanistan or in other operations around the world. So I would like to thank Mr. Sopko for his work on this very important report and for appearing here today before this committee. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Sherman. Thank you. We will now hear from John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JOHN SOPKO, SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AFGHANISTAN RECONSTRUCTION Mr. Sopko. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member McCaul and other members of the committee. Congress created SIGAR in 2008 to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. So far, we have published over 600 audits, inspections, and other reports that have saved the American taxpayer over three billion dollars, while convicting over 130 individuals for misconduct related to that reconstruction effort. Although this is the twenty-second time I have presented testimony to Congress since my appointment, today is the first time I have been asked to address SIGAR's rather unique Lessons Learned Program and what we have learned from it. I thank you for that opportunity. In light of the recent attention our reports have gotten, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to clear up any misconceptions about what that program does or does not do. As with everything produced by SIGAR, this Lessons Learned Program's mandate is limited just to reconstruction, not the warfighting. We do not assess U.S. diplomatic and military strategies nor our warfighting capabilities. Likewise, we are not producing an oral history of our involvement in Afghanistan nor opining on whether we should or should not be there. Rather, we are the only U.S. Government agency focused on conducting research and analysis which meets strict professional standards aimed at providing an independent and objective examination of U.S. reconstruction efforts there and to make practical recommendations to you, the Congress, and executive branch agencies for improving our efforts there and elsewhere. I would like to mention six overarching lessons that you can draw from these thousands of pages of reports we have issued. First, that successful reconstruction is incompatible with continuing insecurity. Second, unchecked corruption in Afghanistan has undermined our goals there and, unfortunately, we helped foster that corruption. Third, after the Taliban's initial defeat there was no clear reconstruction strategy and no single military service, agency, or country in charge of reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Fourth, politically driven timelines undermine our reconstruction efforts. Fifth, the constant turnover of U.S. personnel, or what we have euphemistically called the ``annual lobotomy,'' negatively impacted all of our reconstruction efforts there. And, sixth, to be effective, reconstruction efforts must be based on a better understanding of the historical, social, legal, and political traditions of the host nation. In addition to these key lessons, your staff has asked us to give you certain recommendations that you can focus on now, and here are six: First, in light of the ongoing peace negotiations Congress should ensure that the current administration has an actionable plan for what happens the day after peace is declared. Second, to ensure that Congress is made aware of problems in a timely manner, it should require agencies to provide regular reports to Congress disclosing risks to major reconstruction projects and programs as they occur. This would be analogous to the requirement we impose upon publicly traded corporations for the SEC. Third, Congress should condition future on-budget assistance on a rigorous assessment of the Afghan ministries and international trust funds to ensure that they have strong accountability measures in place. Fourth, oversight is still mission-critical in Afghanistan. Congress must require that this administration continues to ensure adequate oversight, monitoring, and evaluation capabilities continue. Fifth, Congress should require U.S. Government agencies to rack and stack their programs and projects on at least an annual basis to identify their best and worst performing programs. And sixth, Congress should require State, DOD, and USAID to submit the anticorruption strategy for reconstruction efforts that was mandated to be filed by June 2018 and still has not been filed that was mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act. So in conclusion, our work at SIGAR is far from done. For all the lives and treasure the United States and its coalition partners have expended in Afghanistan, the very least we can do is learn from our successes and failures there to improve future operations. I thank you very much for the opportunity to appear today and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sopko follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Engel. Good morning. Our nation has been at war in Afghanistan for more than 18 years. Eighteen years. And let that sink in. More than 2,000 American lives lost and thousands more wounded, more than 60 thousand Afghan deaths, and more than $900 billion spent on a war that has dragged on for almost two decades, and this does not include what we will spend to take care of our veterans in years to come. And where are we after all that time? We are in a military stalemate. In 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan with a clear objective: defeat al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts and prevent a repeat of September 11th. By December of that year, American and coalition partners defeated the Taliban government. Many of its senior leaders were dead, others fled into hiding. The following year, in 2002, President George W. Bush said, and I quote: The history of military conflict in Afghanistan has been one of initial success followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We are not going to repeat that mistake. Unquote. And yet here we are today, 18 years later, having made precisely that mistake. So what happened? There is a lot to unpack when we look at what went wrong, but some things are clear. We got distracted by the war in Iraq under an administration whose priority was defeating Saddam Hussein, not an end game in Afghanistan. We entered into a questionable alliance with Pakistan which continued to arm and support the Taliban, providing the group safe haven and allowing it to strengthen its hand in Afghanistan. We changed missions, changed priorities, and lost sight of what was once considered ``the just war''. So our role in Afghanistan constantly evolved as we plodded along year after year until what now feels like a never-ending war. In 2008, Congress established a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, what we call SIGAR, to conduct oversight of the American war effort in Afghanistan. And in 2014, we called on SIGAR to do something that had not been done, conduct deep-dive, original research into the war to look at its successes, its failures, and lessons learned. So today, we focus on those lessons learned. This past December, the Washington Post published a review of hundreds of interviews and documents SIGAR collected for the Lessons Learned Program after obtaining them through the Freedom of Information Act. These documents and the Post's excellent reporting help fill in some significant gaps in our understanding of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. They show a years-long campaign of misrepresentation by our military officials. Year after year we heard, ``we are making progress.'' Year after year we were ``turning a corner.'' Three successive administrations of both parties promised that we would avoid falling into a trap of nation building in Afghanistan. And while presidents and military officials were painting a rosy picture, the reality on the ground was a consistently deepening quagmire with no end in sight. It is a damning record. It underscores the lack of honest public conversation between the American people and their leaders about what we are doing in Afghanistan and why we are doing it. Yet even in the light of this new information, the Trump Administration is not righting the ship on our Afghanistan policy. SIGAR's Lessons Learned reports have confirmed the longstanding view that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the Trump Administration, in 2017, announced it would send more troops to Afghanistan and waited 18 months before naming a special envoy to focus on Afghanistan reconciliation. That is a heck of a long time when our troops are in the field coming under fire. Just this past September, this committee held a hearing after President Trump derailed peace talks with the Taliban over Twitter, as we have come to expect from the President. The announcement came after over a year of the administration blocking key information from Congress and the American people about the status of the war. Secretary Pompeo has, still to this day, refused to let the top State Department negotiator in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, testify in an open hearing about the status of peace talks despite a subpoena from this committee. There is so much more for us to understand about how we wound up here and how we move forward in Afghanistan so, Inspector General Sopko, I am pleased you are here to discuss your findings and share your perspectives. I will recognize you to make an opening statement. Oh, that you already gave; okay, pending which I will call my friend, Mr. McCaul of Texas, for any further statements. No, Okay. So our witness this morning is Inspector, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko. Inspector General Sopko, I now recognize you for 5 minutes. And you have done that. Okay. So now it is time for questions. Okay. Despite SIGAR's very well documented and detailed account that the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan was failing, the Trump Administration made no real change in strategy. The President's 2017 South Asia strategy suggested the war would be won on the battlefield or that it would use military power to force the Taliban to the negotiating table under favorable terms. He even dropped the mother of all bombs to shock and awe the Afghans into bending to our will and it did not work. So my first question is, did you make your reports available to the White House and other parts of the Trump Administration, and when presented with evidence that this war would not be won militarily, why do you think the President sent even more troops to Afghanistan? Mr. Sopko. Mr. Chairman, thank you for that question. It is not really my jurisdiction to evaluate strategic-level policy, so I cannot really comment directly on why the President did or did not do. We did brief senior staff. I spent over 2 hours briefing with my staff the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on our Lessons Learned reports. We briefed senior officials at the State Department as well as those at the NSC and elsewhere. So we advise them on what has worked or what has not worked on military policy and our report has highlighted a number of things that have worked. I leave it up to them to make the decision as to how to proceed on that, so I do not think I can really comment further on it. Mr. Engel. OK. In April 2002, President George W. Bush said, and I quote: The history of military conflict in Afghanistan has been one of initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We are not going to repeat that mistake. Unquote. Looking back at this statement, President Bush was right, except his administration and subsequent administrations did repeat that mistake. After the initial military victory over the Taliban, there have been long years of floundering and failure. There are many, including those your office interviewed, that thought we lost focus in Afghanistan because of the Bush Administration's focus on Iraq. So let me ask you, do you agree with that and to what would you attribute this failure? Mr. Sopko. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I did not quite hear your full question. Do I agree with what? That President Bush's statement or? Mr. Engel. Well, President Bush said, and this is a quote: The history of military conflict in Afghanistan has been one of initial success followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We are not going to repeat that mistake. That is the end of the quote. And I am saying, looking back at this statement, the President was right, President Bush, except his administration and subsequent administrations did repeat that mistake, subsequent administrations in both parties. After the initial military victory over the Taliban, there have been long years of floundering and failure and there are many, including those that your office interviewed, that thought we lost focus in Afghanistan because of the Bush Administration's focus on Iraq. So I am asking you if you agree with any of those and to what would you attribute this failure? Mr. Sopko. We have reported in our Lessons Learned programs that we did lose focus on Afghanistan and we allowed the Taliban to basically come back and there was a resurgence of the Taliban. We have noted that that was obviously a mistake. We have also noted as a result there was a surge under the Obama Administration of troops as well as a surge on reconstruction or development aid. So that was in response to that not focusing on the Afghanistan issue, sir. Mr. Engel. Let me ask you a final question. I understand from your letter to the editor of the Washington Post you feel that the newspaper mischaracterized your effort, but how would you respond to some of the observations of the interviewees? For example, this quote from Bob Crowley, an Army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency advisor to U.S. military commanders in 2013 and 2014, and this is a quote from Mr. Crowley. ``Every data point was altered to present the best picture possible. Surveys, for instance, were totally unreliable, but reinforced that everything we were doing was right and we became a self-licking ice cream cone.'' Could you comment on that, please? Mr. Sopko. I am happy to do that. That quote is similar to what we have been reporting almost since I have become the Inspector General. I noticed and it is not just in the military side, it is also in the development side. And again, I do not focus on the warfighting. I am the Inspector General for Reconstruction, not for how well of a job we did on the warfighting, but on the training of the military we look at. But there was a disconnect almost from my first trip over there between what AID, State, and DOD were saying what was going on and what I saw and what my staff were seeing on the ground. That is one of the reasons why we performed or came about to do the Lessons Learned reports. The problem is there is a disincentive, really, to tell the truth. There is an incentive and it is for many reasons, and we can go on. I know my time is up, sir, but there are many reasons we can discuss. We have created an incentive to almost require or for people to lie. I do not want to sound like something from Burl Ives in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, but there is an odor of mendacity throughout the Afghanistan issue. And I know Congressman Connolly has heard me talk about this years ago, mendacity and hubris. You create from the bottom up an incentive because of short timeframes, you are there for 6 months, 9 months, or a year, to show success. That gets reported up the chain and before you know it, the President is talking about a success that does not exist. And I think that is a good issue to look at. Not whether there was lying, but why, and what does that tell us about the way we do business, whether it is in Afghanistan or maybe here in the United States. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Mr. McCaul. Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I remember visiting with General Wald who led our forces in Tora Bora. He said if I just had a few more men, we could have taken them out. And Ioften think about that because had we taken out bin Laden in the early days, who knows, it would have changed history. We would not have been talking about this two decades later, $130 billion later. Who knows if we would have even gone into Iraq had we taken out the perpetrator of 9/11. And I have always thought that was our No. 1 mission in country was to stop terror threats from attacking the homeland, and maybe we got a little mission--maybe we got into things that perhaps we should not have. I do think the days of occupying nations and reconstruction with the hope that Jeffersonian democracy is going to plant its seeds and roots in retrospect, it may have been a little naive. It is a very primitive country, Afghanistan, and I have been there many times. So to my question, as I would advise the President on Syria, a residual force to protect the homeland, I do not think we can afford to stay in these countries forever and occupy them forever. I think the most important thing we can do though is to have a residual force of some sort to take out terrorist threats to the homeland and a counterterrorism mission, and maybe we lost sight of what our mission really was in the first place. And so, I guess, and I know you are not here to report on policy, per se, but I would like your comments on that. And to that end, what programs have been most effective at counterterrorism in that mission? Mr. Sopko. Congressman, I think that is an excellent question. And I can bring you up to the line to policy and I leave the policy to you. You have to remember, going back to that time the initial reason we went in there were to find the people who killed our people. Find them, punish them. But the second point was to make certain that country, Afghanistan, was not a place where terrorists could breed and attack us again. So we were trying to create or help create a government that could manage their country; up to then they could not. So that is where, we call it nation building. I do not know. That is a word that I think is abused more than actually defined. It is always defined in the negative. We do not do nation building, somebody else does. But we were trying to make certain that an Afghan Government could keep those terrorists out, so that is why we did build roads, we did do training. We are doing train, advise, and assist right now. So those were the two points of that goal, of our goal in going into Afghanistan. Taking it to what has worked and what has not worked, we identify, and this is one of the things we were briefing Joe Dunford and his team on, on this one Lessons Learned report, which I think may have helped the President in his decision on what to do in Afghanistan where we have consistency in our training and we bring people over there for more than 6 months. And you see that particularly with the Special Forces training, excellent training. And if you look at the Afghan military right now, the best units that are fighting are the Special Forces, that our teams are connected with them, they live with them, they work with them. The other area where we had great success has been with the Afghan Air Force. Again, the U.S. Air Force has done a wonderful job particularly with a couple of platforms, the A- 29, I think is the best one, where the Air Force, our mentors, worked for 4 years, 4 years they spend working with the Afghan Air Force. And that is tremendous; that is one of the best programs we have and we were advising the President and his team that is what you should do. So it goes back to we should have actually done a more of a racking and stacking of what worked and did not. The Afghan military, and particularly the Afghan police, has been a hopeless nightmare and a disaster and part of it is because we rotate units through who are not trained to do the work and they are gone in six to 9 months. I do not blame the military, but you cannot bring in a Black Hawk pilot to train an Afghan policeman on how to do police work. And that is what we were doing, we are still doing. Mr. McCaul. Well, this has been very insightful and it will help us in making our recommendations to the administration. It seems to me in conclusion that really training their Special Forces, their Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and their Air Force with the appropriate people may be the best strategy. I know the President hopes he can negotiate with the Taliban. I am a bit skeptical, sir, that you can never negotiate with the Taliban. I know a complete withdrawal would involve an overrun by the Taliban, for sure. They would probably take the country over and then we would have a real mess. So this is very complicated, but something needs to change. The status quo is not acceptable here. Yes, sir. Mr. Sopko. In response to that, Ranking Member, I agree totally. But the important thing is you have to be given the facts. Mr. McCaul. Yes. Mr. Sopko. To make that decision. And one of the concerns I have raised for almost, again, the seven or eight or 9 years I have been doing this--I cannot remember, they kind of merge after a while--is that a lot of the facts that you need, you are not being given. They are overclassified or they are not being collected or they are just ignored. So to this day, you do not have unless you go into the classified briefing, and you know how difficult it is to use that, but you are not told some of the basic facts that you need to make your decision of whether you should fund programs or not. And I can go through those lists at some time. That is a still a problem. And when we talk about mendacity, when we talk about lying, it is not just by lying about a particular program, it is lying by omissions by saying, oh, I cannot tell you about the casualties; oh, I cannot tell you about how good the Afghans are of its weapons; or I cannot tell you this and that. It turns out that everything that is bad news has been classified over the last few years. Mr. McCaul. Well, we appreciate your hard work on this. Thank you, sir. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Sherman. We cannot deny terrorists a few acres here or there, after all, they plotted against us in an apartment building in Hamburg, we need to prevent terrorists from getting a whole State or a training facility as large as Tora Bora was in early 2001. In evaluating our Afghan policy, I think we have got to get away from looking at the sunk costs, the exhaustion of the last 18 years, and look only at the future and see what are the future costs of being involved and what future benefits, if any, are available. The one lesson I have learned over the last 20 years is we are very good at breaking things. We broke the Taliban and entered Kabul. We broke Saddam Hussein's army and entered Baghdad. We are not very good at fixing things and at nation building and so we should restrict our future military involvements to those where our case for involvement is so strong that we are not morally obligated to go in and fix it. The Pottery Barn rule should not apply. The worst example of our behavior was Iraq. We invaded even a few days after Saddam Hussein said he would allow all the international inspections. We found no weapons of mass destruction. And then to justify our behavior, we had to announce that we were going to turn Iraq into a democracy with rule of law. I wonder how well that is working out. Mr. Sopko, you have shown us that our Afghan nation building was not done well. Foreign Policy--Foreign Affairs magazine gives our efforts there a D-minus, but going forward we are going to be confronted with similar situations. Let's say we had done a B job, go with the Federal Government long enough not to expect an A job. We did a B job. One view is, we can do nation building at reasonable cost if we learn from the lessons of Afghanistan and do it about as right as the government can do it. Another lesson is, we cannot do nation building. Would a B job from the Federal Government had done the job in Afghanistan? Mr. Sopko. I used to teach in college. I think if you even did a D job--D. Mr. Sherman. D. Mr. Sopko. It would have been OK in Afghanistan. Mr. Sherman. So you are saying if we would had just--if---- Mr. Sopko. D-minus and it would have worked a lot better. Mr. Sherman. So you have given--what we did was an F, F- minus, something like that? Mr. Sopko. E. You showed up. You showed up for class. That is it. All kidding aside---- Mr. Sherman. So you are saying that we can do nation building if we do a good, the kind of good job that the Federal Government is capable of doing? Mr. Sopko. Absolutely. And what we tried to do is we tried to give the Afghans--and I think one of your staff asked us about misassumptions that we have identified and there is a whole list of them. One was trying to give the Afghans what we had when they only wanted a little bit of peace and a little bit of justice. And if you look at our report on stabilization, we talk about that. Mr. Sherman. Got you. Mr. Sopko. The whole stabilization program was coming in after our military cleared a district to try to bring in a government services so that the locals would go back and support the central government. Well, they wanted a little bit of justice. What did we do? We built courthouses. They were not looking for courthouses. They were not looking for something that looked like this. They were looking for just simple justice. And as much as you hate the Taliban, and I do, and I hate their brand of justice, to the average Afghan it is better than the justice provided by the National Unity Government. And that was one of my trips was the most shocking thing where, and I believe, well, Congressman Connolly has left so I can repeat the story so no one of you will be bored, but I came back as so depressed because I met three, separately, three Afghans who I had been working with, smart, young, brave Afghans who risk their lives every day, and for some reason we all started talking about their families. And their families lived in the countryside in Afghanistan and every one of those young, smart, bright Afghans told me a story where they recommended to their mothers and fathers that if they had a justice problem, and all of them did, go to the Taliban. Do not go to the local government. Mr. Sherman. So instead of creating a government similar to what Afghanistan had some time in the last 50 years, we tried to create the kind of government we have in the United States. Mr. Sopko. We tried to create a little America. We tried to create I call it Norway. What they wanted was fair justice. And what happened is if you went to the National Unity Government justice, first of all, the judges weren't there because they were afraid to go there. You had to pay bribes, and it is the bribes that determined wherever you got the land or wherever the dowry was recognized or whatever. But the Taliban came in, it was rough justice and I am not advocating Taliban justice. I remember I testified---- Mr. Sherman. Is there a period of time in Afghan's history that you would say the Afghan had the kind of government that those villages would have wanted? Mr. Sopko. I think it probably would have been before the Soviet invasion and it goes back to---- Mr. Sherman. And before the Communist regime that preceded the---- Mr. Sopko. And the Communist regime and the horror of that. Mr. Sherman. I believe my time has expired. Mr. Engel. Thank you, yes. Thank you, Mr. Sherman. Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Sopko, for your tenacity. Your frustration level must be just vexing. I do not know how you do it. Ranking Member McCaul just mentioned a moment ago about Osama bin Laden. In another part of the world I visited with Bashir in Khartoum in Sudan and I was there to talk about Darfur, and he was almost mocking. And then when I met with Salah Gosh, one of his people, was mocking as they offered us Osama bin Laden before he went to Afghanistan and the Clinton Administration would not take it. So in terms of hindsight being 20/20, if only. Let me just ask you a couple questions. You know, 130 convictions, a thousand investigations, criminal and civil, 600 audits, inspections, and other reports, maybe you could break out for us and maybe even do it more for the record, who were those people? Were they Americans? Were they people from Afghanistan that were convicted and what were they convicted of? Where did they go to jail when they were convicted? Second, with regards to some examples, and I think your testimony is just amazing, you talk about how in 2014, then USAID administrator--and I know him, Dr. Shah. He was a very, very honorable man and I wonder if the information even got to him that you were trying to provide. But he had said there are three million girls and five million boys enrolled in schools compared to just 90,000 when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, and you pointed out that that information was gotten from the government and it was contradicted by other government people and there was no attempt to verify the accuracy. And I think that is very troubling. You also point out on the rule of law programs, a billion dollars, that in 2013 the strategy had no performance measures. I think you know that is appalling and maybe you might want to touch on that. And finally, you point out in the interviews for this Lessons Learned Program, 80 percent of the people interviewed wanted their names removed to be anonymous. Again, does that fall in--was there retaliation against anyone as far as you know? And that is a very, very, as you pointed out, (they have) a well-founded fear of retribution from political and tribal enemies. Maybe you could speak to that. And again, thank you. Mr. Sopko. Those are all good questions. Let me start at the end. On retaliation, we know of no retaliation but we are concerned. One of the concerns I have is that there is a lawsuit now pending and the Washington Post wants to get the names of all of our people who asked for anonymity. As an IG, I cannot work if I cannot offer anonymity and protection to a witness or a whistleblower. Well, you know what, whistleblowers are a lifeblood as an inspector general or any law enforcement agency. I have law enforcement credentials. You have to have them. I mean, I find it so ironic, this is the same Washington Post, if I recall, had an informant that I believe it was for 30 years they kept the identity of Deep Throat from the American people, but for some reason we have a new Washington Post where they want to know our informants. These people who spoke to us risked a lot, and you know what this town is like. You know what is like if somebody bad mouths their old boss or whatever. These people had realistic fear and whatever. We do not give them a litmus test of whether your fear is reasonable or not. We just ask them if they want us to use their name. And so that is so important. So--but there is no retaliation that we know of. I mean in Afghanistan the difference is that these people would be killed. Simple, OK. But I suppose the Washington Post wants their names for some reason. Why? They have the information, why do they need the name? But I do not want to go there. The question, I believe, and I am sorry if I lost---- Mr. Smith. The rule of law and also the education of children and 130 convictions. Mr. Sopko. Oh, yes. That is, it is fact versus fantasy. This is this problem that we identified early on, this odor of mendacity. There was this exaggeration after exaggeration of what we accomplished. And there is another example we give about the life expectancy, where USAID Administrator Shah, and it went all the way up to the President, were saying about how we had doubled the life expectancy. And we talked to experts in the health field. We talked to experts at the CIA that said it was statistically impossible, statistically impossible to double the life expectancy of any country over that timeframe. But that is--and I am certain some President and some AID administrator, I must say the current AID administrator is totally different and he sticks to the records and he sticks to the facts. I am so proud of---- Mr. Smith. That would be Mark Green? Mr. Sopko. Yes, one of your former colleagues. He is a tremendous person to work with. But we find this. But I think the problem is, again, we did not send liars and thieves and troublemakers to Afghanistan to work for USAID or for the Department of Defense or whatever. We sent the bravest, the smartest--I do not want to say always the smartest. But we sent the best that we had, but we gave them a box of broken tools. We gave them--let's say if you were a contracting officer you are rated on how much money you put on contract, not if any of the contracts work. We rated not on outcomes, but on output. We sent over military officers with 9 months or less of duty and they had to show success. You know, I have actually been briefed at one point about these shark tooth of assessments. The Afghan--you would be assigned to an Afghan unit. You would come in and say, ``The Afghan unit can't walk and chew gum at the same time.'' Three months later, ``I am seeing success. They are getting better.'' At the time of the end of your tour, ``They are doing very good. They are meeting all objectives.'' You leave. The next captain comes in, ``These people can't chew gum and walk at the same time.'' Why? It is not because that officer is a liar. That officer wants to get promoted. That officer wants to show success over his tour of duty. This is the problem we have. Our H.R. system is broken. Our procurement system is broken. Our rotation system is broken, you know, you go through the whole list. The problems you see in Afghanistan are the problems you see of the way the government operates here. That is the one thing I can say having spent 30 years looking at government operations, first, for Senator Sam Nunn, then for John Dingell over here in the House. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Mr. Deutch. Mr. Deutch. Thank you. Mr. Sopko, good to see you again. Thanks for all of your work and your team's work conducting oversight of our policy, our efforts in Afghanistan. The publication of the Afghanistan Papers by the Post has elevated an important discussion, but it is not the first attempt to highlight problems with the U.S. role in Afghanistan. Congress established SIGAR to help conduct oversight of the war. SIGAR has written seven Lessons Learned reports; is that right, Mr. Sopko? Mr. Sopko. That is right. Mr. Deutch. That touch on many of the issues covering the Afghanistan Papers. A major concern is the U.S. was dragged into a conflict in a country that it did not fully understand. There is more information we should have, Mr. Sopko. I will get to that in a second. According to the Afghanistan Papers, in 2014 a senior State Department official said, ``If I were to write a book, its cover would be, America goes to war without knowing why it does. We went in reflexively after 9/11 without knowing what we were trying to achieve. I would like to write a book about having a plan and an end game before we go in.'' And during a Lessons Learned interview in 2016, an anonymous USAID official said, ``Taliban's presence was a symptom, but we rarely tried to understand what the disease was.'' Richard Boucher, career Foreign Service Officer, who was State South Asia from 2006 to 2009, told government interviewers in 2015, ``If there was ever a notion of mission creep it is Afghanistan. We have to say good enough is good enough. That is why we are there 15 years later. We are trying to achieve the unachievable instead of achieving the achievable.'' All these quotes help demonstrate how a lack of cohesive strategy and clear policy undermined our efforts in Afghanistan. We did not fully understand our adversary, our strategic objectives, or the environment in which we are operating. Despite the amount of assistance that flowed into the country since 2001, even the positive gains remain fragile. So, Mr. Sopko, if we are to be honest, Congress is culpable to many of these problems. Too often we listen to officials without adequately questioning their assumptions and conclusions. But you are here today and you have told us that part of the problem is that we do not have the facts. You said, the basic facts that we need are not being given. Can you elaborate on that? What are the basic facts that all these years later that we have been at this, that you have been at this, we are still missing? Mr. Sopko. Well, let's start with strategy. There is a strategy for Afghanistan; it is classified. Now I have clearances. You do not need a clearance to get it; you cannot get it. There is a start. What is our strategy? There is a strategy for--there is no strategy we think for narcotics. Mr. Deutch. There is--well, let me just stop you there. So when you are referring to the strategy, you are referring to, what are you referring to? You are referring to a document? Mr. Sopko. Well, usually there are strategic documents. Mr. Deutch. Right. Mr. Sopko. You have got to have a strategy and then you have got to lay out the programs, because without the strategy you don't know where your programs should be going. That is the problem we have had over 18 years. And you also have to have metrics or ways to measure success. Mr. Deutch. All right. But when you--I just want to stop you for a second. But when you talk about the constant churn of new people coming in and starting over, they are all operating pursuant to that strategy, no? Mr. Sopko. No. They get a job assignment. They just go over there to run a program. They do not know what--that is the whole problem. They are sent over there without knowing what the strategy is and what was the objective of the overall strategy in Afghanistan, but the individual program strategy. Mr. Deutch. OK. Who is the keeper of that strategy? Where-- -- Mr. Sopko. Well, usually---- Mr. Deutch. You make it sound as if there is this document that if we all could just see it everything would become clear, if we shared it with all the military officials and USAID they would understand. Help me understand. Mr. Sopko. Well, I did not mean to imply that this is the silver bullet or the answer. You are just saying where are the problems of not getting the facts. Mr. Deutch. Right. Mr. Sopko. You start with the strategy and then you look at, well, how did the programs meet that strategy? And then you look at metrics for success, then you look at the facts. Now when I talked about classification, I mean, and I can go through the list of what is still classified and I think that may help you. You know, the way to determine whether we are doing a good job on training, advising, and assisting the Afghan Security Forces, you would want to know about the Afghan National Security Forces operation data. That is classified. The Afghan Security Forces' casualties, I mean if they are getting killed then obviously our training has not been very helpful. You would want to know about the RS Commanders' assessment of the Afghan security environment. That is now classified. The attrition metrics for the ANA Corps and ANA zone level, that is classified. Equipment readiness, that is classified. Mr. Deutch. Right. Mr. Sopko, I appreciate it. Let me just close with this. Mr. Sopko. Yes. Mr. Deutch. So in the seven documents that you have produced so far and all of the times that you have been up here, have we had this conversation before? I am not being flip. This notion that if we just had this information for all the years that we have been at this, have you been screaming from the mountaintops about this? Is there--help me understand. Mr. Sopko. I think I have been raising the issue about classification going back at least four or 5 years, and repeatedly, and I think in every quarterly report we raise it. Not the lessons learned, but the quarterly reports. Mr. Deutch. Right. Mr. Sopko. And I raised it just, what was it, last year. The last metrics we had for success were--and General Nicholson said these are the metrics you have to focus on, the amount of territory the Afghan Government controls and the percentage of the population they control. They classified that, then they stopped collecting the data, then they said that is no longer relevant. So you have no metrics. You as Members of Congress have no public metrics to rate the billions of dollars we are spending in Afghanistan. Mr. Deutch. Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing. And for the over 2,400 American lives lost and over 20,000 wounded, we certainly owe it to every one of them to make sure that we are doing everything now to get this right. And I appreciate this, thank you. Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Deutch. Mr. Perry. Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Sopko, for your candor. It seems to me that your job here from the perspective of some of my colleagues is to make sure you do a good job at bashing or affirming that President Trump is pathetic and does not have a strategy and this is all his fault. And I actually applaud your efforts to kind of stay out of the fray in that regard. I don't think any of us are perfect. I think the President does want to get out of Afghanistan and it is hard to determine what the facts are. The Post's article kind of laid out the fact that we do not know the information and you have reaffirmed that. Classifications, even in the President's own defense, when he wanted to declassify information that would buttress his own innocence in claims against him, he cannot seem to get that done. This town has a way of sequestering the information most important to it and most damning to it and the people in it. That having been said, I would like to get to some of the information. You highlighted challenges regarding coordination of reconstruction in Afghanistan and the fact that there is no one in charge. There is no culpable, whether it is on the Afghan side or whether on the American side or some NGO, et cetera, the old adage that if everyone is in charge, no one is in charge. Have there been any improvements in this since you have continued to decry that over the course of your reporting have there been any improvements regarding culpability, regarding assignment for responsibility, so to speak, in Afghan reconstruction projects? Mr. Sopko. If I could have one moment. Mr. Perry. Sure. Mr. Sopko. Well, it is unanimous. No. No, we have not seen any improvements. And again, I don't want to, you know, turn this into a comedy routine. The problem is this is a very complicated--this is a NATO operation. We have multiple donors. We have multiple donors who are just doing reconstruction. Some are providing military. It is a problem and I really think it is something that Congress needs to focus on, because we will do this again and there are going to be multiple people wearing multiple hats. And we actually have an entire report looking on, I forget the title of it is, Divided Responsibility, and that report goes into, unfortunately, gory detail of how convoluted the process is. And again, this is not meant as a criticism of any administration. This is meant as a criticism of the complexities of government. This has got over 900 footnotes highlighting, and maybe this is the difference between us and the Washington Post, you know, we go into a lot of detail on this. And no, there is a problem and it is not just in the military field, although this report focuses on that, but it also goes to the reconstruction field. So I think this is a worthwhile area for you and Congress to focus on, divided responsibilities in Afghanistan and in these post-conflict environments. Mr. Perry. With the little time that I have, let me just carry you a little further on that. It is your studied opinion that that should be the purview of Congress to assign those responsibilities only in the context that look, I am a Black Hawk pilot and I do not want to teach law enforcement and I would not be any good at it. But while I am surrounded by a lot of really well-intended people that are smart, I am not sure Congress is the best answer either. And it seems to me that somebody that can act somewhat autonomously determine the problem and see the solution set, somebody like a Mark Green or anybody in that capacity should be able to say, look, here is the project, here is the agencies involved, here is where the funding is. You are in charge. Here is the report, Tom, knock yourself out. And this is what we expect from you and if you cannot get the job done, then in 6 months we are going to look for a replacement. Why do you think it should be Congress? I am concerned about that, but I will--I am listening to your answer. Mr. Sopko. No, no, no. I think part of the reason is some of these authorities and responsibilities are established by law, first of all. And what we are dealing with in Afghanistan is a whole of government and whole of government's approach and a lot of this is going to have to be done statutorily. I am not saying that any one committee up here are the best ones to decide, but it should be recognized we have a problem. And I was going to look at the charting here. Mr. Perry. My time has expired, sir, but could you just do this. With the chairman's indulgence, could you give us one example regarding a statute where you think we could make a difference so I can kind of contextualize this? Mr. Sopko. I will definitely do it. I asked my staff to do it right now and we will get back to you. Mr. Perry. All right, thank you. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Mr. Keating. Mr. Keating. Thank you. Let's be clear on one thing right off the bat that our greatest responsibility to get things right, we are going to be talking about billions and billions of dollars, but our greatest responsibility to get things right rests with those families that lost sons and daughters and loved ones to this war and to the people who are living with devastating injuries that they suffered in this war that forever will challenge them both physically and mentally. Now let me zero in on one area of concern that we raised. My colleagues and I raised it. I authored with my colleagues a piece of legislation ensuring that women are a part of the peace process in Afghanistan and that they are engaged in the activity of being meaningful partners in creating a lasting peace, something I hope we will advance, Mr. Chairman, out of this committee shortly. But you mentioned in your report that you expect, and in your testimony that you expect to issue a report on women's empowerment in Afghanistan this year or early next year. And in a recently released 2019 High-Risk List, there is a section focusing on how despite over a billion dollars spent since 2002 to advance the status of women, gains by women in Afghanistan remain fragile. So how would you categorize the current state of meaningful engagement for women and what is a clear strategy in your mind going forward to deal effectively with these gains that not only will help women, but actually I think help the country achieve any semblance of a lasting peace going forward? Mr. Sopko. Congressman, that is a very good question and I am glad you highlighted our High-Risk List, because this report talks about the importance of a number of issues and this is when I refer to Congress needs to do something about ensuring that these risks are dealt with if we want lasting peace. I cannot tell you specifically what is the answer. I can just tell you that although we have made advancements helping women in Afghanistan, life for a woman in Afghanistan is horrible. Outside of the cities, major cities, where the majority of the Afghan women live, it has not improved much. And I have not met an Afghan woman yet who trusts the Taliban. So that is something, and I know you are concerned that they have a seat at the table or somebody represents them at the table so they do not get lost in this shuffle declaring victory and leaving. That is my concern. Mr. Keating. We have been assured that time and time again by the Afghan---- Mr. Sopko. By the Taliban? Mr. Keating. No, by the Afghan leaders, yet you are right. There is no place at the table. So, but you categorize it as fragile right now, so could you talk to us about right now and what we should have done to make it less fragile and what we can do going forward? Mr. Sopko. You know, I do not have specific answers to that. I will get back to you. But I think one of the critical things about that issue, and it is a delicate issue because you are talking about cultures. But one of those things is we have to focus that the problem of women's rights is men. And all of our programs have been focusing on giving certificates and things to women, who are problem is, and Ms. Ghani, the President's wife---- Mr. Keating. I have spoken with her and had discussions with her on this matter. Mr. Sopko. I have spoken with her too, in the palace, and she says the women's issue is a men's issue, so the program should be focused on them. But one of the things is if you are going to design a women's program talk to some Afghan women. And Ms. Ghani was one of the first people who highlighted the problem with the Promote Program, which is one of those programs that was oversold as the greatest program on earth for women, $250 million, and there was going to be $250 million of donations from the European Union and the European allies, and I remember meeting with the European allies in Afghanistan and none of them had heard about the program. But we had already--this is again, this odor of mendacity. We had already--OK. Mr. Keating. All right, I have 20 seconds left. But there is a recurrent theme regardless whether you are talking about the judiciary system, the rule of law, whether you are talking about the narcotics system or what we are talking about with advancing women's place in the society, we are not tailoring our programs around the traditions of the host country. And I think probably with later testimony that is going to be an area you are going to highlight that that is a huge oversight on our part. I have to yield back. My time is up. Mr. Sopko. We need to talk to the Afghans, sir. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Mr. Yoho. Mr. Yoho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Sopko, thank you for being here. I apologize because I feel it is like welcome back to groundhog days again because we have heard this over and over again, and you have done a great job of highlighting this stuff. I remember when Rajiv Shah was here when he was with USAID. I think Afghanistan got a billion dollars through USAID and they could not account for $300 billion and this has been a continual problem. I think what you pointed out was a grand plan and I think Congress can do that and Congress should be the one that does that and it should be the appropriate committees. I think the Foreign Affairs Committee working with DOD or one of the other committees should be able to create a policy that lives beyond a presidency so that it is something that our allies and the countries we work with can count on that this policy will not change. Yes, the President can come in and they can tweak it as needed, but it has to survive an administration. And that is something that if we vote on it in the House and the Senate, it will be hard to change. And that all goes back to making sure we have the correct policy. I lost my train of thought. The one thing that you picked up, and you said this in the very beginning and this is so important. Your reports come out every year and I think they are spot on. It is this body that does not act. We are the ones that are in charge of the money. We are the ones that can direct these programs or not. And I thought what you said in the very beginning, successful reconstruction is incompatible with continuing insecurity, until we have a stable government, we can throw all the money you want, but until there is a stable government, and it does not need to be a democracy. I am against democracy building in a lot of these countries because they are not ready for it. That is something that has to come up from the top down. We cannot force feed a country that. It has to be a stable government that we can work with. And the women programs, those are all great and I agree with you. But when you look at that culture, if you do not understand that culture, their culture is you walk behind me eight or ten feet, they are not going to have them at the seat, at the dais, unfortunately as that is. We have been to countries where they have done that because of our policies and the women are there, but when you go to ask a question of them, the men answer. And I have interrupted the men and said, I do not want you to hear from you, I want to hear from the people that are here, the women here. We need to understand that culture and give them time to change and adapt, and I think we need to focus on stability. And when we have stability, then our infrastructure projects can start creating the economy that we need so that trade can come in a gradual change. The Taliban, we ran them out and the women went to school. But when the Taliban comes back, they are going to be out of school and we know that is going to happen. And so, I think we need to be a lot smarter in how we do this and this is a lesson learned that we should never repeat again. I want to get your sense, do you feel that the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower forewarned us about, are they playing a hand in this or impeding a success in this, or is it more of our policies just being, you know, where it changes every--the mental lobotomy that happens with talent that we send over there? Mr. Sopko. Yes, I can't really comment on that. I think the problems we have you have identified. The other problem is there is a tendency, and I talk about it in the statement, of we think that just throwing money at it will answer it. Mr. Yoho. Sure. Mr. Sopko. And more money is a problem. We spent too much money, too fast, in too small of a country, with too little oversight. Mr. Yoho. Right. Mr. Sopko. And that created the corruption problem. That distorted the economy and distorted the culture, so smaller sometimes is better. I don't know if that has anything to do with the military industrial complex, I think it more has to do with maybe it is a tendency of American culture. We have a view as we are going to get there with the firstest with the mostest, going back to, I don't know if it was General Sherman or something saying we are going to do that. And we have the same thing about development aid and we are going to get there with the firstest with the mostest and assume that is good. Mr. Yoho. And what we need to do is focus on what do you need, what do you want, what we can help you achieve. Mr. Sopko. And what you can use. And, sir, I would harken back to those seven questions which we posed within a year of me coming on board. I was trying to, what are the lessons we have learned and one of those questions is, do the Afghans know about the program? Mr. Yoho. Right. Mr. Sopko. Do they want the program? Will they use the program? If you answered that in the affirmative that program will probably succeed more than it will fail. But if you answer in the negative, then why are you doing the program? Mr. Yoho. Exactly. And your six conclusions and recommendations is what this body needs to do and we are the ones in charge of that and I thank you. Mr. Sopko. Welcome, sir. Mr. Engel. The gentleman's time is--Mr. Cicilline. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Sopko, for your service. I want to understand a little bit about the Afghanistan Papers. What was the document that was being prepared? Was that going to be this report that you have provided to the committee or is it an internal document? Because part of what I am trying to figure out is, is there some failure also of our current model of the Inspector General in terms of getting this information in a way that will require action, because I do think sunlight on this is really important. So what, will you tell us a little bit about what the purpose, like were you preparing a report that was going to be shared publicly or shared with Congress? Mr. Sopko. That is a good question, and again I think it is one of the misconceptions. We were not preparing a report. We interviewed people in preparation for these seven reports as well we are interviewing for the next series of reports. You know, we--these were raw interview notes---- Mr. Cicilline. OK. Mr. Sopko [continuing]. That we had done for those reports. Mr. Cicilline. For the reports that you had previously prepared, OK. Mr. Sopko. Oh, yes. Yes. And it is up---- Mr. Cicilline. I want to get to some questions. Mr. Sopko. Sure, OK. Yes. Mr. Cicilline. I appreciate that. I just want to, because I do think getting this information is really valuable, but I want to focus my questions very much on corruption, because I think, certainly, the absence of a clear set of objectives has to come, you know, developing an objective for our mission in Afghanistan followed by a strategy and then metrics to measure it. I think that has been our challenge. But I am particularly disturbed about what I am learning in this most recent report with respect to the issue of corruption. The Department of Defense says corruption remains the top strategic threat to the legitimacy and success of the Afghan Government, and you quote that in your report. And your report in 2016 reported on corruption, I think all the reports have, and criticized the government's failure to recognize corruption, which was bad enough, but actually the American activities contributed significantly to the corruption. And so, would you speak a little bit about that and also about this notion that we prioritize security over anticorruption efforts and whether that was the right judgment and how we might measure metrics in both of those areas? Mr. Sopko. Well, that is, I think you have focused on what some military officers told us is really the major threat to reconstruction and to the war effort and that is corruption. It is not the Taliban, it is corruption. And if you talk to General Miller, who is head of all of our troops right now, he will answer that is still a problem. It not only saps the money we give to the Afghan Government, but it also is used as a recruiting tool by the Taliban because they can point to the corrupt officers. They can point to the corrupt warlords who are getting all of the government contracts, and they say, see, that is what the U.S. Government does. So I think you have honed in on a serious issue. It still is. Now I will say in defense of Congress, Congress has recognized that and they have done legislation on that. They have actually asked us to assess the corruption situation three times, so you are aware of it. And we are in currently assessing the condition there, it is still a serious problem. Mr. Cicilline. So one of the most mismanaged pots of money was the Commander's Emergency Response Program, or CERP, I guess it was called. This is a slush fund that was reminiscent of the war in Iraq. CERP was allowed military commanders in the field to bypass normal contracting rules and spend up to a million dollars on infrastructure projects far above the normal cost of such projects. What role did CERP money play in enabling corruption and was it ever deconflicted with other foreign assistance programs to ensure that funding streams were not working at cross purposes? That seems to be an especially serious cause or a contributing factor, the corruption that we saw on the ground. Mr. Sopko. You have highlighted a good point. CERP money was not deconflicted. Like a lot of the military programs, they were not deconflicted. I would not say CERP was the worst, I think there were a couple of other programs I could discuss that are worse. But we have not actually done an audit on those CERP funding to the granularity that you are asking, but it was deconflicted. Good intentions, but a lot of waste. Mr. Cicilline. And final question, a retired brigadier general said, and I am quoting, Congress gives us money to spend and expects us to spend all of it. The attitude became, we do not care what you do with the money so long as you spend it. End quote. This sentiment is reflected throughout the Lessons Learned report. What can Congress do to counter the view among military and civilian personnel in the field that you are just to spend money no matter what? Mr. Sopko. I think the best answer is for the appropriators to put language or at least do not hold the agencies vulnerable or attack them for not spending the money. I know a lot of agencies were attacked for not putting money on contract or not spending or losing it. So multiyear money may be an answer to that, but there is an incentive to spend the money. And we saw an absurd situation down in Camp Leatherneck where we built a building that we call it the 64K, a 64,000 square-foot headquarters for the surge. They started construction as the surge was ending. The military officers, our Marine Corps general down there said, ``I don't want it, I don't need it, I won't use it.'' His superior above him, I think it was General Allen at the time, says, ``We don't want it, we don't need it, we won't use it.'' And it went up the chain. But there was a general back in Kuwait who said, Well, ``Congress gave it to us, so spend it.'' So there is a beautiful building, unfortunately, you can't get to Camp Leatherneck, but when I got there it was the most best built building I saw in Afghanistan. I think it was $36 million. As far as I know, it is empty still. Mr. Engel. OK, thank you. Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Sopko, thank you for being here and thank you for what you do. It is pretty clear our experience in Afghanistan is a case of winning the war but not winning the peace or we would not still be there. But I have a couple questions with regards to some specifics and the first has to do with deployments. There is a significant downside to long deployments in terms of the effect on our men and women in the military and their families, but as you have pointed out there is also a significant downside to short deployments. Not from a military perspective, but from a reconstruction perspective, how do you reconcile that? How do we know when we have got it right? Mr. Sopko. That is a very good question. And I think what we can do is again look to where there have been successes. And what the Air Force has done is they have assigned the same people for 4 years. They do not spend the whole 4 years in Afghanistan, they basically work with the Afghan pilots, they bring them back so you are assigned to a similar task. Special Forces has the same thing. You are assigned, but then you have been there for a certain amount of time, you come back to a pool that then it is the same pool that works very closely with the same units so there is a connectivity. So those are two examples we cite. We are actually going to be doing a Lessons Learned report on what are the best practices for doing that in with AID or State or DoD. How are you able-- you do not want to send somebody over there for 18 years, that is impossible. Mr. Wright. Right. Mr. Sopko. My dad was drafted for World War II and he was there for the length of the war however long it lasted, but that is a little different. But there is a way to do that so you do not lose that connectivity, you do not lose that experience, you do not lose that connection with this Afghan unit, and you work together and that Afghan feels closer to you, the American advisor, than he does to the Taliban. Mr. Wright. And I want to pick up on something Mr. Yoho was talking about earlier and that is changes in administration. And I am not asking you to judge the administrations or their policies, but we have had three Presidents during this time, both parties. To what extent does a change in administration hamper our ability to, in terms of the reconstruction efforts? Mr. Sopko. I have not really seen that as a problem. Mr. Wright. OK. Mr. Sopko. But when the new administration, the Trump Administration, came in they did a policy review we participated at and they actually were very responsive to our bringing information to their attention. A lot of the career people do not change, so obviously we are dealing with them. The Ambassadors do not change. The AID people out there do not change, so I do not see that as a problem. Mr. Wright. OK. Mr. Sopko. We did not really see much of a difference between the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration in that. That we have not seen as a problem. Mr. Wright. OK. My last question has to do with Iraq and based on your experience, to what extent did the war in Iraq prevent us from completing what we needed to complete in Afghanistan? Mr. Sopko. Well, again I have not looked at the warfighting side. Remember, we have spent $132 billion on reconstruction. We have spent close to 700 billion on the warfighting in Afghanistan. So all I can tell you is when we did an analysis on the train, advise, assist and on the reconstruction, what everybody told us was when the focus turned on Iraq we lost interest in a lot of the key issues in Afghanistan. That is all I can tell you. And I--other than that---- Mr. Wright. Would that include the establishment of civil governments? Mr. Sopko. Yes, to some extent. Mr. Wright. OK, great. Thank you and I yield back. Mr. Sopko. Yes. Mr. Castro [presiding]. Thank you, Representative Wright. Ami Bera. Mr. Bera. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So $132 billion on reconstruction, we have spent more on Afghanistan than we spent on the whole Marshall Plan rebuilding. Mr. Sopko. That is correct, sir. Mr. Bera. After World War II, so it is pretty amazing. And when I think about that I think some of it is when we approached Europe, we had similar cultures, similar, an understanding of Europe, similar forms of government, et cetera, so that probably contributed to some of that success. And it does seem evident from your answers and from what I have looked at, we do not have that same understanding of the values, culture, et cetera, in Afghanistan and that probably foundationally, is one of the things that has led us to be not so efficient. I think you stated or Mr. Yoho stated our goal is to define lasting peace. But the problem is how we define lasting peace may not be how the Afghans define lasting peace. How would you say they define lasting peace? Mr. Sopko. I think I would use, probably, the Webster's-- well, it is, will the gains that the Afghans have made continue in the future? So the women's rights, the rule of law, some of the gains they have made on corruption, I mean the question is, is will a peace treaty just end up into civil war again. Mr. Bera. Right. Mr. Sopko. So its sustainability of any of the gains, and we have made some gains over the 18 years, the Afghans have made some improvements, will those continue? Mr. Bera. So then it behooves us on the committee and, certainly, the subcommittee I chair has jurisdiction over Afghanistan and it is an area that we are going to look at, so we should define what those gains are. We should define those parameters. But we should also, you know, Mr. Perry is not here, but none of us is bashing President Trump here, or any particular administration. Each administration has got some things right, but they have also got a lot wrong. And we know the current administration wants to consider a withdrawal/drawdown in Afghanistan and probably will proceed in that direction. Congress should insert itself into this process and it does not have to be adversarial the message to the administration is work with us on this. And if we were to do that there probably is no peace process that does not involve the Taliban. They are not just going to disappear. So if we accept that as a reality, then we have to think about the gains within that context. And it would be my sense that some of our interests are certainly in the counterterrorism space we do not want to see a resurgence of al-Qaida and so am I thinking about this correctly in terms of, well, what would that remaining force be on the counterterrorism side. And then the last thing that I would think about and, you know, I would love for you to comment on is it is my sense that we have created a dependency in Afghanistan on U.S. dollars. And there is going to be a big hole that is left in the Afghan economy as we exit. How do we fill that hole? I mean, and now the complicating factor is regional dynamics as well. Obviously the Afghans have a relationship with the Indians. The Indians have an economy that could step in there. The Pakistanis do not like the Indians much of--so the whole regional dynamics are challenging as well, and how do we create that conversation as we are drawing down to create some regional, you know, am I, I guess, am I thinking about this correctly in how to engage? Mr. Sopko. You are absolutely. And, Congressman, again, I would ask you to go back to our High-Risk List that we issued and I think you--these are the risks to that stable, lasting peace and one of them definitely is finances. The Afghan economy is abysmal. It is reality. Seventy-percent of their budget for their government comes from the United States taxpayer and the European taxpayers and whatever, and that is not going to change once you sign peace. Now maybe the cost of the warfighting may change, but just because you sign peace with the Taliban does not mean you are going to have peace with ISIS or the other 30-some terrorist groups and the other warlords and gangs who are operating. So you are going to have a cost. We have to face the reality there and try to work with them. But that is one of the biggest concerns we have in here because you also have to reintegrate. Let's assume it is a successful peace. You have 60,000 talib plus their families who have to be reintegrated. That costs money. Can the Afghans do that? No. We just had a major surrender of ISIS troops. I have seen no evidence that the Afghan Government has done anything to reintegrate those ISIS troops. And, actually, if you talk to General Miller, you talk to our---- Mr. Castro. You will have to give the rest of it for the record. I have to move on to another Representative. Mr. Sopko. I am sorry. But I think those are the conditions. Mr. Bera. OK. We will continue this conversation. Mr. Sopko. I am terribly sorry. I did not hear you. I apologize. Mr. Bera. Right. Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that recognition. I am probably not as intellectual, but I will probably be more entertaining to you, so I appreciate the time. And I do notice how important you are. Usually we have this whole line of people up here and they get their 5 minutes and then they tweet about it and go home. You are by yourself and then you turn around to the group behind you and then they take note of whatever you are saying and make notes of it. So they are doing an excellent job behind you. I do not know if you knew that or not. I had a couple of questions, brother, and thank you for being here. Your father was a World War II veteran. My dad enlisted shortly after December 7th, so I appreciate--my momma flew an airplane during the war, so I appreciate you, brother, and I appreciate what you have said up here. I have actually been listening and I had a couple of good questions here. Have you seen any evidence that foreign State actors have or are currently undermining U.S. reconstruction efforts and can you expand specifically on the role Pakistan is playing? Mr. Sopko. I have not seen any evidence of that of foreign State actions on reconstruction. And as for Pakistan's role, obviously there is a lot of reporting about their involvement with if they are supporting various terrorist groups, but that is not within my jurisdiction so I am not the best person. I would just be reporting on what read in the newspaper too. Mr. Burchett. That is all right. And that is probably wrong, so I appreciate you saying that, brother. Should the U.S. continue to fund the counternarcotic programs even though we have thrown nine billion dollars at the problem and it seems with little success? And I say that coming to you--I was a State legislator for 16 years. I was a county mayor. And I remember when our Attorney General Randy Nichols told me, talked about the price of brown tar heroin and when it became too high the opioid epidemic would explode, and he was a prophet on that. It did. But I know that overseas the market is flowing in and out and I was just curious of your opinion on that. Mr. Sopko. Well, counternarcotics is the 800-pound gorilla in the room. It is the largest export from Afghanistan. It dwarfs the licit, the legal economy. It employs more people than are in the Afghan Army. So if you ignore it, you ignore it at your peril, particularly if we are talking about developing lasting peace. You have peace with the Taliban, but what about the drug warlords who are probably more powerful than the Taliban? They corrupt the institution. They are recognized by the Afghan people as that and if we tolerate them or if we allow the Afghan Government to tolerate them, you kick the can down the street just so far and that is a problem. So I do not know if I answered the question, sir. Mr. Burchett. Do you ever see--it seems like these folks, you know, we get a new regime in or whatever and the drug warlords just seem to transcend to the next one. Is that because of their, in its power or their cash-flow or is it a combination thereof? Mr. Sopko. I think it is a combination of it. And again, I do not want to downplay how difficult it is to fight drugs. Mr. Burchett. Yes. Mr. Sopko. We have a problem here in the United States. Mr. Burchett. A huge problem. Mr. Sopko. You could look at Mexico. You look at Colombia. You look at developed countries are having a problem with it. You put it into a country like Afghanistan, it dwarfs a lot of the other problems. The sad thing is, over the last 18 years drug usage in Afghanistan has skyrocketed. And I cannot remember and I can get back to you on the data on the United Nations, I think Afghanistan may have the highest addiction rate of any developing country now, but I can double check that. I may be wrong. Mr. Burchett. If you could get back to me that would be great and no big deal. But thank you so much for being here. I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Castro. Thank you, Representative. I would call on myself now. I am next in the lineup. I want to ask you, Mr. Sopko, and, first of all, thank you for your testimony. I want to ask you about our diplomatic corps and the State Department and the efficacy of our diplomatic efforts. While the United States has continued to spend billions of dollars annually, we apparently did not invest enough in our Foreign Service Officers and diplomacy to train and retrain experts. Given that we sought to achieve peace and development in Afghanistan, more military was not always the right answer. Whether rebuilding or negotiating with the Taliban, personnel within the State Department, of course, is of the utmost importance. So here are my questions for you. What can be done to empower and strengthen the diplomatic corps? Mr. Sopko. I think, first of all, is I think you hit a right point on empowering and strengthening. They are essential. The problem in Afghanistan is the Ambassador has been, it is sort of de facto, his role as the senior U.S. Government official has been downplayed by the fact that there is a military officer sitting across the street. Mr. Castro. What I was going to ask you about, about the interplay between---- Mr. Sopko. He has more money. Mr. Castro. Right. And the interplay between our military folks that are there and the diplomatic folks that are there. Mr. Sopko. The problem is that the State Department, I think you have hit it on the head, is underfunded. USAID is underfunded in comparison to the military. We are fighting a war in Afghanistan, and I am not saying we should not fund General Miller and RS the way we are doing it. But I am just saying is you cannot ignore the diplomats; you cannot ignore USAID. You particularly saw this at the PRTs and at the regional groups when we set up, we were supposed to be AID and State and the military out there in the region. Well, military all showed up. They had the money. They had the manpower. They had the CERP funds. Where were the State and AID people? There were not enough of them to go around. And that is a problem. I am old school. Development should be done by development experts. Those are diplomats and AID officials. They should not be done by the U.S. military. And we highlight, when we give that task to the U.S. military it almost automatically fails. Mr. Castro. And that segues right into the next question that I wanted to ask you. Why does the military appear to be at the forefront of nation building in Afghanistan rather than the State Department or USAID, especially in light of the fact that this has been going on now for 18 years? So there has been plenty of opportunity to make course corrections, why do you think this is? Mr. Sopko. Because we have emphasized the warfighting and we have given short shrift to development and reconstruction. And the military has the weapons and they have the manpower and they have the money. Mr. Castro. And what does that say or what does the portend for when our presence, our military presence is no longer there at some point? Mr. Sopko. It is a big issue. It is one of those risks you face. Because, for example, our military assistance program has been run by the military. We have trained the Afghans to deal with the military. They have not been trained to deal through the normal embassy functions, so there are some serious problems here and it is an area I think Congress needs to look at. Mr. Castro. Thank you, Mr. Sopko. I am going to go now to Mr. Levin from Michigan. Mr. Levin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Sopko, thank you for your public service, I really appreciate it, and for coming here today. SIGAR interviewees indicated that politics was partly to blame for the sheer amount of money poured into Afghanistan even as money from prior years was left unspent, and officials made clear that Afghanistan did not have the capacity to put so much money to proper use. Apparently, policymakers claimed, ``The political signal by a budget reduction at a turning point in the war effort would adversely affect overall messaging and indirectly reconstruction efforts on the ground. The articulation of goals for the purpose of budgeting and programming was largely secondary to the political implications of budgeting.'' In short, it seems like short-term political expediency was prioritized over long-term effective policy. No one wanted to support budget cuts and risk being blamed if things went badly. In your view, to what extent were budgeting decisions in Afghanistan made due to political expediency? Mr. Sopko. We have not looked at that. I think we have-- because it really goes beyond my mandate, but that issue has come up of just too much money sloshing around and the motivation was to spend it and that led to a lot of the problems, but we have never looked at it back on this side. Mr. Levin. Well, so here you are testifying before Congress and I really want to get your advice about what we can do here to insulate the budgeting and policymaking processes from political pressures when it comes to matters of war and peace or, just narrowly speaking, this war and peace in Afghanistan. Maybe to put it another way, how do we keep this from happening that we are spending much more, we are sending much more money than people on the ground think is appropriate? I mean it is a big problem when we have domestic priorities here and peaceful priorities here that we need to take care of our babies and our pre-K kids, we need to educate them, we need to be able to afford our infrastructure. Mr. Sopko. Congressman, the best answer I can have for that is having more hearings like this where you bring not just me, you bring in somebody from AID, State, and DoD to explain and justify their budget and explain not just the--talk about the inputs and outputs, but what is the outcome. And I go back to why some of you may have wondered why did I attach all of those letters from 2013 when I asked the SecDef, SecState, and AID administrator what are your ten best successes and what were your ten worst failures and why. I firmly believe that if they had honestly answered those questions, we would not be here today because what they would have done is it would force them to answer the question, why are we spending nine billion dollars on narcotics if it is a failure? They would answer the question, why are we spending $2.3 million bringing in rare Italian goats from Italy to develop the goat industry in Afghanistan over 6 months? They would have been forced to look at what--well, that is why we talk about racking and stacking. So, Congressman, take a look at those letters we sent and many of those letters and what we are asking are the same questions you should be asking. I cannot answer those, but if you want to stop the hemorrhage of money to a place like Afghanistan it has got to start by asking people not to talk about inputs, do not bring somebody in here from AID who only talks about how much money he has gotten, or outputs how many kids he says they are training in Afghanistan, but what is the outcome? Are any of those kids still in school? Mr. Levin. But in the brief time I have left, I mean you have had multiple Lessons Learned reports, right, where SIGAR identified that the approach and programs that the U.S. used to achieve Stated goals were not properly tailored to the Afghan context as you are talking about here with goats from Italy and so forth. What contributed to this gap? What lesson do you take from reading all these letters, the gap between what the U.S. is supporting and what the Afghans needed on the ground? Mr. Castro. Do you want to take 15 seconds to answer that? Mr. Sopko. I think I go back to the institutional hubris and mendacity that I talked about. We have incentivized lying to Congress, and by that, I mean the whole incentive is to show success and to ignore the failure. And when there is too much failure, classify it or do not report it. Congress has to weigh in and say, hold it, we want to know the truth as gory as it is. Reconstruction takes a long time. You cannot do it in 6 months. You cannot do it in 9 months. You probably cannot do it in one administration. So if you wanted to help the Afghans, it is the long haul. Eighteen---- Mr. Castro. Thank you. Mr. Sopko. OK, that is--I am sorry. Mr. Levin. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Castro. Thank you. Yes. Representative Connolly. Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome back---- Mr. Sopko. Good to see you, sir. Mr. Connolly [continuing]. Mr. Sopko, and thank you for your work. I mean, frankly, that press table ought to be filled to overflowing. The story about Afghanistan and the United States' military and economic assistance to that country really deserves the kind of scrutiny you have been trying to provide and get attention to. It is shocking in some ways that the story you are telling has so little interest by the media, the public, Congress itself. We have provided at least $132 billion in development assistance that is of dubious value. Is that a fair---- Mr. Sopko. Correct. Mr. Connolly [continuing]. Conclusion? Imagine, $132 billion. And if I understand it, and I do not want to overstate it, almost all of the systems put in place are designed to avoid measuring progress, failure and success, and, for that matter, even accountability. So, for example, you earlier testified there are almost no metrics for how are we doing, did it work? If that did not work, let's try something else. You cannot--and when we have metrics, they classify them so the public and the Congress and others actually cannot access them; is that true? Mr. Sopko. That was my--basically, I was talking about the military where the bulk of the 132 billion has been spent, right. Mr. Connolly. Speaking of the military, in the stabilization report you talked about the fact that in a sense the military stifled, suppressed USAID by bulldozing the agency into a clear, hold, build strategy and demanded that AID, despite misgivings, implement a cash-for-work program despite AID's protests as well as misgivings; is that true? Mr. Sopko. That is correct. Mr. Connolly. How does such a thing happen? Mr. Sopko. Well. Mr. Connolly. How did AID lose its independence of judgment? After all, it is the agency in the Federal Government with the main expertise and development assistance, not the Pentagon. Mr. Sopko. Yes, I cannot fully answer that other than to say that who you give the money to, and I suppose who you give the guns to, really calls the shots, but it is who you give the money to. If there is only one AID person at the table and there is 23 guys and gals wearing green suits, I think if there is a vote you know who is going to win. Mr. Connolly. You talked earlier, passionately, about the problems with the longest war in American history and our engagement in reconstruction and you used two words that really struck me: hubris and mendacity. Almost sounds like a potential title for a novel. We had Advice and Consent, the modern version is going to be called Hubris and Mendacity. And I want to give you an opportunity to give us some examples of each that affected directly our efforts in Afghanistan. After all, the stakes, we invaded Afghanistan after 9/11. We worked with local militias to overthrow the Taliban and to try to expel and eliminate the presence of al- Qaida. This was a momentous decision with very high stakes for America directly. And here we are well over a decade later and we do not seem to have done a very good job of meeting any kind of objective, including a stable government accepted by the people. So can you just give us some examples of hubris and especially mendacity? Mr. Sopko. Well, I think we have referred to, in my statement I talk about some of the statements made by AID about the great success on life expectancy. It was statistically impossible to double the life expectancy of the time given. I think it is a combination of hubris and mendacity that anybody can do that. I mean the next thing you know is we are going to be walking on water on an AID program. The education where we claimed millions of children were in school and AID knew that the data was bad but they still reported it as if those millions of children, is that hubris? Is that mendacity? Probably a combination of both. I actually think the people on the ground thought they were doing a great job. They just never looked at all the data and they were not going to explain that the data was faulty. You look at some of the successes we claimed about the power grid--I am running out of the time and the chairman is strong. So, I mean those are some of the examples. I am happy to give you a lot more of those examples. Mr. Castro. Thank you. Mr. Connolly. I would just say shades of Vietnam. Mr. Sopko. True. Mr. Castro. Representative Allred. Mr. Allred. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was in Afghanistan over the Thanksgiving holiday and while we were there we had a chance to meet with our military and State Department leaders. And I met a young Army captain who was a West Point grad and also a football player and he was tasked with training the next generation of Afghan military leaders. And he was tired when we met because he had been out the night before leading a raid, which we are doing every single night, degrading the Taliban's ability, al-Qaida, and ISIS elements as well. And I have often thought about that captain, especially as we heard the news of the two service members who were killed this weekend, and wondered if we are serving him as well as he is serving us, as well as many of our men and women in conflict are serving us. And I want to thank you for your work. I think this is one of the best parts of our democracy is that we can be critical of ourselves and that we can take a critical eye to our commitments and say what are we doing wrong and what can we do better. I am not here to point fingers. There are multiple administrations involved. We all know how long and how much money we put into this. But one of my questions for you is that over the years you have released a number of overarching recommendations for various parts of the government, I want to know how receptive you found the agencies involved to your recommendations. I think I read that 13 of them have been adopted; is that correct? And maybe tell us what you think is standing in the way of some of those recommendations being adopted. Mr. Sopko. Well, that is in regard to, I believe we had about 130 recommendations from the first seven Lessons Learned report. Overall, from our audits and inspections, about 86 percent to 90 percent of our recommendations are adopted. The reason for the smaller number, I believe, is because many of our recommendations are conditional on events occurring such as peace or the next--many of our recommendations are if you do this again, you should do the following. So it is hard to say they have complied because it has not happened, so--but we are happy to report back on that. Mr. Allred. Yes. Mr. Sopko. The Lessons Learned Program have been very well received by the military, the State Department, and USAID. Particularly, the military under General Dunford when he was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he was very receptive and we are using it--we have been asked to do it for training for them as well as the Foreign Service Institute. Mr. Allred. Oay. Well, I know that this has occurred before, but while I was there, we were told that a new generation of Afghan military leaders were emerging particularly in their Special Forces and they were leading most of the kinetic fighting and doing actually a decent job. And I was wondering if you could provide you and your agency's opinion on the generation of leadership that is coming through the Afghan military, whether or not they will be able to stand up when we stand down. And I know that some of that is a military consideration that is outside of your purview, but from the reviews you have done and over the years of your experience how you believe that is progressing. Mr. Sopko. Well, Congressman, it is a good point. It is in our purview because it is part of the train, advise, and assist. So as for the Special Forces, I think that is a success story. Our training and advising and assisting the Afghan Special Forces is a success. We highlight it, we continue to highlight it. I can give you more detail if I had the time and happy to brief you on it. Just as I said with the air program, we all are hoping for a new generation of officers, senior officers in the Afghan military. I know General Nicholson spoke that this is what we were hoping for. A lot of those officers were old Soviet-trained officers and they finally got rid of them. They retired and they pensioned them off. But it is too early to tell. We are talking about the law that pensioned all these older officers off was about less than a year old or maybe older, we do not know. But the problem is that below that corps level, maybe below that officer level you have a lot of corruption, a lot of incompetency and it is seriously hurting the Afghan military. The biggest problem is not casualties, it is desertions. It is people disappearing or it is people who never existed and we are paying their salaries. So we all have to respect the Afghans for doing what they are doing with the current situation. It is a difficult situation. Many of them are not being paid or fed. They have to buy their own food from their officers "
