        "text": "A few words about the country:Afghanistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia. It borders Pakistan in the south and east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the northeast. Like a great part of the world, it was once a British colony, but declared its independence in 1926.\n\nHistory of the anthem:According to the current Afghan constitution, the law requires the national anthem to be in Pashto (a language spoken by about 65 percent of the population). The song is also required to mention that “God is the greatest” (though I’m pretty sure most people over there don’t really need that confirmation), and it has to name the different ethnicities of the country (which of course are quite diverse). The current anthem was adopted in 2006, with lyrics by Abdul Bari Jahani and music by a German-Afghan composer called Babrak Wassa (no, I’m not sure if he’s allowed to eat sausages, stop asking).\n\nLyrics:Pashto:\n\nDā watan Afğānistān day\n\nDā izat da har Afğān day\n\nKor da sole, kor da tūre\n\nHar bačay ye qahramān day\n\nDā watan da ṭolo kor day\n\nDa Balotso, da Uzbəko\n\nDa Pax̌tūn aw Hazārawo\n\nDa Turkməno, da Tājəko\n\nWər sara Arab, Gūjər dī\n\nPāmīryān, Nūristānyān\n\nBrāhawī dī, Qizilbāš dī\n\nHam Aymāq, ham Pašayān\n\nDā hīwād ba təl źaleǵī\n\nLəka lmar pər šnə asmān\n\nPə sīna ke da Āsyā ba\n\nLəka zṛə wī jāwīdān\n\nNūm da haq mo day rahbar\n\nWāyū Allāhu Akbar\n\nWāyū Allāhu Akbar\n\nWāyū Allāhu Akbar\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nThis homeland is Afghanistan!\n\nIt is the glory of every Afghan.\n\nThe abode of peace, the abode of the sword,\n\nEach of its sons is courageous.\n\nThis nation is the homeland of us all,\n\nThe land of Balochs and Uzbeks.\n\nThe land of Pashtuns, Hazaras,\n\nTurkmens and Tajiks.\n\nWith them, there are Arabs, Gujjars,\n\nPamiris and Nuristanis.\n\nAlso Brahuis, Qizilbash,\n\nAimaqs and Pashayis.\n\nOur country will glow forever,\n\nLike the sun in a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the chest of Asia,\n\nIt will be like heart forever.\n\nWe will follow the name of The Truth;\n\nWe say God is Greatest!\n\nWe say God is Greatest!\n\nWe say God is Greatest!\n\nMy humble opinion of the anthem:Again, I’ll start out the process by examining the lyrics before actually listening to the song. First off: how can some place be both the abode of peace and of a sword? It’s like the two most opposite roommates possible. It’s kind of like they’re trying to start a cop movie, with a good one and a bad one (that has swords). Furthermore, how many different ethnicities can one country possibly have? I shudder at the thought of this man ever writing an anthem for the United Nations, it would be the longest song ever created (it wouldn’t even need someone to create a 10 hour version on YouTube if it ever would go viral). In all seriousness though, this is a pretty decent text, got to admire the attention to the different cultures. I especially like the fourth stanza, some nice metaphors there; yet the last stanza seems repetitive: come on guys, be original."
