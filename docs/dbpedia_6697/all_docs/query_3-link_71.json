        "text": "All you need to know about Afghanistan. I’ll cover its climate, its people, language and religion. Not forgetting Afghan food and culture (media and literature) as well as holidays and festivities.\n\nA Guide to Afghanistan\n\nI imagine when people think of Afghan cuisine, they think hot, spicy, and I expect a mish-mash of all the Middle Eastern dishes they’ve seen or tasted: baklava, fattoush, to name some of the popular ones. Although most of these are eaten all other the Middle East, you mustn’t forget that each country has their own specific dishes, those they can call their own.\n\nIt’s for the above reason why I want to share with you how to eat like an Afghan in this post on Afghan food. I’m hoping it will inspire you to try popular Afghan dishes but also educate you on those things which will have an affect on the cuisine such as Afghan climate, religion and culture.\n\nSalâm! (welcome in Dari, the main Afghan language)\n\nQuick Facts!\n\nAfghanistan is located in South and Central Asia\n\nIt is a landlocked country with lots of mountains\n\nIt has Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China as its neighbours\n\nThe Capital is the city of Kabul\n\nThe official language is pashto/dari\n\nThe religion is islam\n\nA Little Background on Afghanistan\n\nWhat is the Afghan Climate like?\n\nThe climate in Afghanistan is of two extremes; there can be really cold winters with temperatures reaching below 15 degrees in and around the central highlands/mountainous areas, yet extremely hot summers with temperatures at 50 degrees plus in the lowlands.\n\nIt doesn’t rain a lot in Aghanistan and if it does, it’ll happen around March/April and in the North. Drought is unfortunately a huge problem.\n\nYou wouldn’t believe it but Afghanistan does get snow! Snowfall usually happens around October – April and in the mountainous areas. The snowfall is what keeps Afghanistan from a water shortage as it runs into the rivers and lakes once it melts.\n\nThe People of Afghanistan\n\nAfghanistan is full of a mix of different ethnic groups. The majority are Pashtuns (about half the population) who live close to the border of Pakistan. Then there’s the Tajiks (about one fourth) who live near Tajikistan and the Turkic people (about 1.3 million) who are known as Uzbeks. A small 1 million of the people are the Hazaras and even smaller at 250,000 are the Baluchs and at 100,000 are the Nuristani.\n\nWhich languages are spoken in Afghanistan?\n\nThe main languages of Afghanistan are Dari and Pashto. Dari is spoken widely and is very similar to the Persian language. It’s sometimes known as Farsi. Here’s a list of other languages commonly spoken in Afghanistan:\n\nPashto (spoken by the Pashtuns)\n\nTajik (spoken by the Tajiks)\n\nUzbek (spoken by the Uzbeks/Turkic people)\n\nPersian (different versions are spoken, for example the Hazara people speak what is known as Hazaragi, a dialect of Persian)\n\nKafiri (spoken by the Nuristani)\n\nBalochi – (A North West Iranian languages spoken by the Baluchs)\n\nWhich religions would you find in Afghanistan?\n\nThe majority of the population of Afghanistan are Muslim with most adhering to the Sunni denomination and a small percentage are Shia. The rest are what is known as non-denominational and don’t adhere to any of the groups. They are ‘just Muslim’. You’ll also find Sikhs and Hindus as well as a community of Jewish people.\n\nPopular Afghan Foods\n\nWhat is the national dish of Afghanistan?\n\nThe national dish of Afghanistan is Kabuli Palaw – rice with carrots, raisins and lamb. Apparently before girls are married, they are taught how to make Afghan food, including this dish because they would bring shame on the family if they didn’t know how to cook it!\n\nAfghan food has influences from –\n\nIran\n\nIndia\n\nMongolia\n\nAfghan Food: Breakfast\n\nIn Afghanistan for breakfast you would eat the following –\n\nLots of eggs, either fried with vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes and peppers (there are many different kinds)\n\nRoht, a sweet bread\n\nPaneer cheese maybe on its own or with raisins\n\nSambosa, a savoury pastry which is filled with meat\n\nYou would drink a sweet chai tea\n\nMy Afghan Egg Burrito is a twist on Afghan cuisine with a Mexican breakfast burrito (see image above). Why not give it a try?\n\nAfghan Food: Lunch\n\nYou would drink lassi, a yoghurt drink which is sometimes salted. It apparently helps to digest the food\n\nYou might also drink doogh, a drink made from yoghurt, water and mint – in the summertime to cool down\n\nYou would most definitely eat some naan bread or flatbread\n\nAn Afghan lunch is very similar to an Afghan dinner – big meals are eaten for both. It would definitely consist of a wide variety of meat and rice dishes (see below)\n\nAfghan Food: Dinner\n\nLike most Middle Eastern countries, Afghans like to eat a spread of ‘sharing’ dishes made mainly from rice, meat and vegetables.\n\nThe national dish, Kabuli Palaw is most likely to be served (see above)\n\nLamb kebab is very popular, usually served with rice (usually chalow rice – the fluffy kind)\n\nKaddo Bourani – a sweet pumpkin curry\n\nPotato salad and beef kebabs\n\nLamb and spinach stew – my fave Afghan food – see image above!\n\nAn appetiser might be Sabse Borani, a spinach and yoghurt filled flatbread (see image below).\n\nMantu – steamed dumplings filled with minced meat or onions topped with a tomato or yoghurt sauce (this is where the Mongolian influence comes in)\n\nAshak – dumplings filled with chives and topped with a garlic yoghurt sauce\n\nA salad would often be prepared\n\nAfghan Food: Dessert\n\nFruit is eaten a lot in Afghanistan, especially pomegranates, sweet melons, apricots, plums, berries and grapes\n\nYou’ll most likely drink some more tea (in small cups) – when you’ve had enough, you should turn your cup over or else your cup will be forever re-filled\n\nSweet, melt-in-the mouth cookies such as Kulche-ab-e-dandaan (mostly on special occasions or if there are guests)\n\nYou might also drink some coffee, also drank in small cups\n\nWhich Afghan food is your favourite?\n\nEating Culture and Traditions in Afghanistan\n\nThe guest is treated like royalty in an Afghan household and you probably won’t be eating on the floor (unless you’re family or from the country!) Afghans like to impress. Here are a few interesting traditions surrounding eating in the nation:\n\nWomen and men usually eat separately but I guess it depends how strictly religious the family are. Families will eat together if only in company of close family members.\n\nThe best dishes are always placed near where the guest is sitting.\n\nDinners are usually eaten on a dastarkhan, a tablecloth laid on the floor – you must never step on or over it.\n\nCutlery is not usually used – you use your hands to scoop up the food (or a naan) and you would only use your right hand.\n\nA guest will always be offered the place of honour at the head of the table.\n\nPopular Afghan Culture\n\nAfghan Culture: TV\n\nTV has only recently started booming in Afghanistan with the nation liking to watch programmes from Turkey, India and the US. One of the most popular dramas which broke rating records was Turkish show Diriliş Ertuğrul – all about the Ottoman Empire.\n\nReality shows have also managed to reach the airways with one called The Candidate which is meant to be like a political election but with normal people. Afghans can enjoy an American Idol-style programme called Chand Sitara as well as a police drama called Eagle Four.\n\nChildren are entertained with a show based on the American Sesame Street called Baghch-e-Simsim. This is only a small selection from a growing range of networks!\n\nAfghan Culture: Music\n\nAfghans like to listen to a range of music. Their musical heritage is rich with music coming all different background. You’ll find melodies from Persia and songs from India as well as from the Tajiks, Pashtuns and Hazara people.\n\nA lot of Afghan music is religious with the Koran being recited (unaccompanied) plus accompanied religious workshop such as with the Chishti Sufi sect in Kabul, with instruments such as the Rubab (a bit similar to the Lute) being used.\n\nThe most popular patriotic song in Afghanistan is called Da Zamong Zeba Watan (This is our beautiful homeland). It’s sung by Ustad Awalmir.\n\nAs well as classic music known as Klasik in Afghanistan, pop music is listened to often too, mostly by the younger generation. An example of pop singers would include Aris Parwaz and Farhad Darya.\n\nCan you recommend any good books about Afghanistan?\n\nIf you’re like me and are after some MORE Afghan culture, some literature to further immerse you in the country, the following books have great reviews. They are all going on my list to read!\n\nThe Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini\n\nBorn under a Million Shadows by Andrea Busfields\n\nThe Wasted Vigil by Nadeem Aslam\n\nAn Unexpected Light by Jason Elliot\n\nThe Places In-between by Rory Stewart\n\nThe Bookseller of Kabul by Asne Seierstad\n\nThe Little Coffee Shop of Kabul by Deborah Rodriguez\n\nAfghan Holidays and Festivities\n\nHere’s a useful table listing of all the public holidays and festivities happening in Afghanistan. Got one to add? Feel free to contact me!\n\nCulture hungry?"
