The National Anthem of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was adopted in May 2006 upon request by a new government after the fall of the Islamic State. Prior to that, between 1996 and 2001, the Taliban ruled much of the country and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which banned all kinds of music including national anthems. After the Taliban was overthrown in late 2001, a previous anthem had been in use until 2006 when a new national anthem, titled "Milli Surud" ("National Anthem" in Pashto), was created. The national anthem was composed by German-Afghan composer Babrak Wassa, and it was written by Afghan poet Abdul Bari Jahani.[1] The lyrics mention the Takbir, and many of the numerous ethnic groups of Afghanistan. In August 2021, however, the Taliban came into power again and overthrew the government, and this national anthem has been in exile ever since.[2][3] Now in exile, this anthem has been de facto replaced by the National Anthem of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

According to Article 20 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the national anthem must be in the Pashto language, an official language of Afghanistan. The country's various ethnic groups have been upset by this, and Afghan politicians and lawmakers have argued that in order to relieve ethnic and religious tension, the anthem should not contain any lyrics (in a similar manner as "Intermeco" and "Evropa").[2][4]
