Anthem Lyrics - English Translation

So long as there is the earth and the heavens;

So long as the world endures;

So long as there is life in the world;

So long as a single Afghan breathes;

There will be this Afghanistan.

Long live the Afghan nation.

Long live the Republic.

Forever there be our national unity;

Forever there be the Afghan nation and the Republic.

Forever the Afghan nation, the Republic and National Unity-National Unity
