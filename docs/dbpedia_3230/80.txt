What Is Underwater Hockey?

Underwater hockey, often known as Octopush, is a globally recognized restricted-contact sport in which two teams battle to move a puck into the opposing team’s goal by pushing it with a hockey stick while swimming in a pool.

Underwater hockey is an exciting game that can be enjoyed by people of all genders and orientations. It is widely popular in the countries like Australia, England, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, the Philippines, and Malaysia.

Benefits Of Playing Underwater Hockey

Underwater hockey is a fun and challenging sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and fitness levels. Some other benefits of playing underwater hockey include:

Underwater hockey provides an opportunity to work on your coordination and agility, which are important skills for other activities like sports or running.

It is an excellent exercise regimen for those who are looking to reduce their overall body weight, as underwater swimming requires plenty of bilateral movement (arm, legs, waist).

Playing underwater hockey helps improve divers stamina and endurance because it demands sustained effort over long periods.

Because the game takes place in tight spaces with limited visibility, it develops teamwork skills as players must work together to pass the ball or score goals against their opponent’s defensemen.

This sport is great for socializing. Playing against others in a small space creates intense competition that doesn’t always happen in bigger environments outside of sports games or stadiums.

How to Play Underwater Hockey?

Underwater hockey is a sport that combines the excitement and suspense of ice hockey with the thrill of diving underwater. To play underwater, you will need to wear equipment that includes a helmet, flippers, and gloves.

The basic rule of underwater hockey is similar to regular ice hockey: two teams face off against each other on an enclosed swimming pool or lake in front of spectators. Players use their hands and feet to shoot balls into the opposing team’s goal.

The object is to score more goals than your opponents by deflecting shots past the goaltender or trapping the ball in your net for a point-blank shot.

When attacking, try moving across multiple lanes simultaneously so that you have an advantage on defense. Be sure not to lose focus of the ball – if it’s dropped or stolen, it may be difficult for your team to score goals!

Finally, stay calm under pressure – underwater hockey can be very exciting but also frustratingly quick-paced at times!
