        "text": "By of the\n\nBrown Deer — Hockey players congregated in front of the goal, frantically slashing at the puck with their sticks until the orb at the center of everyone's attention finally scooted in.\n\nBefore teammates shouted or raised their arms in triumph, the first thing everyone did — even the referees — was breathe.\n\nNo, this isn't the familiar game played on ice. These hockey players wear masks, snorkels and fins and play their game at the bottom of a pool. Instead of skating, they're swimming. Instead of wielding large L-shaped wooden sticks they use small comma-shaped rubber sticks.\n\nAnd since no one can hold their breath for two 15-minute halves, there's no goalie planted in front of the net — there's actually no net — waiting to fend off shots.\n\nIt's a bit perplexing to watch as a spectator — a dozen people wearing water polo caps swimming along the surface before diving down to the bottom, butts raised in the air followed by fins before disappearing. Then popping back up again.\n\n\"A lot of people say it looks like fish fighting over a kernel of corn,\" said Eric Straily, who traveled from Denver to compete in the CanAm Midwestern Underwater Hockey tournament over the weekend at the Walter Schroeder Aquatic Center in Brown Deer.\n\nRoughly 200 competitors from 14 underwater hockey teams from Canada, Colombia and the United States, plus five underwater rugby teams, competed Saturday and Sunday at the Brown Deer facility, where plastic court bottoms are placed in two pools. The courts include markings for the field of play and three meter-wide goals, and more importantly give players a smooth surface to slide three-pound pucks they whack with their sticks.\n\nAn informal survey of players on Sunday revealed there's not much crossover between ice and underwater hockey players. Most underwater hockey players started as swimmers or water polo players.\n\n\"A lot of us grew up enjoying the water, a lot of us are ex-swimmers,\" said Dave Kennedy, tournament organizer and co-owner of CanAm Underwater Hockey Gear. \"Swimming laps just gets old. We have people who like the full body workout but don't want to swim laps and for some it's fun having a team sport with a goal in mind.\"\n\nBecause Schroeder Aquatic Center is home to the underwater hockey courts, several tournaments have been held there annually since 2010. Yet the only underwater hockey team from Wisconsin participating in last weekend's tournament was from Sturgeon Bay. The Sturgeon Bay club was started by Kendall Banks, a renowned underwater hockey player who competed in every world championship between 1980 and 2006. When Banks moved from California to Sturgeon Bay several years ago, his daughter Molly, now 13, asked if he could organize a team.\n\nMolly Banks, a Sevastopol eighth-grader, recruited some of her friends, who in turn recruited their parents. Now the Sturgeon Bay Sturgeons practice on Friday evenings at the Door County YMCA and compete in tournaments. The only other underwater hockey team in Wisconsin is a club in Green Bay.\n\nFew sports routinely field teams of both genders and ages that range from teens to 50s and 60s. Few sports are played by all family members.\n\n\"The awesome part is you get to compete with your daughter,\" said Terry Chier, whose 14-year-old daughter, Gale, is a classmate of Molly Banks. \"We're triathletes, so we use this for cross training.\"\n\nMolly Banks started playing with her mom and dad at age 5 and routinely faces off against grown men and women, holding her own against opponents from throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\"I kind of grew up with it. I love being underwater,\" Molly Banks said Sunday afternoon shortly after losing a hard-fought match against a Chicago team, 4-3.\n\nThe rules of ice and underwater hockey are somewhat similar — use a stick to move a puck into a goal. Three referees are in the water wearing orange gloves, signaling goals and penalties to a referee on the deck, who blows a horn. There are no icing or offsides penalties like in ice hockey, and there's no checking, though players can be penalized for getting too rough. The penalty box is anywhere on the pool deck where a player is consigned to sit for a minute or two before splashing back into the water.\n\nYes, a good pair of lungs is needed, but players hold their breath for only six to eight seconds before kicking back to the surface, and a good team seamlessly moves players under and above water to move the puck and run plays before acceding to the needs of oxygen-breathing creatures. Though they use fins to move through the water quickly, the sport is tiring because at more experienced levels, players will spend more time underwater than on the surface.\n\nIn addition to six players to a side, four subs tread water in a fenced-off area ready to swim in when they're needed, sort of like ice hockey line changes. There are no faceoffs, but after a goal is scored teams swim to their side of the pool and wait for the horn to sound to furiously swim toward the puck in the center of the pool.\n\nPlayers wear a padded glove on their stick hand to prevent broken fingers, and snorkels are shorter than those used for snorkeling in the ocean. Though some get injured from fast-moving pucks, injuries are relatively rare.\n\n\"You don't have to be a good swimmer because we're wearing fins. You need to be comfortable in the water. We get our share of swimmers, divers, scuba divers, free divers as well as a lot of people that have some team sport background like soccer,\" said Kendall Banks. \"The fact we're not supporting our weight, our ankles and knees, that helps a lot. It's a good sport for all ages. You see people in their 40s and 50s even their 70s playing.\""
