        "text": "The National Hockey League has wrapped up its regular season.\n\nA lot of people will be watching the playoffs, but once the Stanley Cup has been won, what do hockey fans watch?\n\nHere’s an option that you might not have considered: underwater hockey.\n\nThis sport may be played in melted ice, but it’s not the same as ice hockey.\n\nFor one thing, there aren’t any goalies.\n\nSix swimmers on each side have to work together to keep the 3 pound puck from ending up in their team’s underwater goal.\n\nThey wear fins and snorkel masks while they’re doing this.\n\nThey’re carrying pusher sticks that are much smaller than the long sticks ice hockey and field hockey players use.\n\nAnd instead of face-offs, the two teams start at each end of the pool.\n\nWhen the buzzer goes off to start play, they all race toward the puck to take control.\n\nMaybe the biggest difference is that unlike hard-hitting pro ice hockey, underwater hockey is a no-contact sport.\n\nIt began in the 1950s as a way to train commandos and divers in the UK’s military.\n\nBack then it was known as “octopush.”\n\nBut it’s become a big deal in dozens of countries.\n\nAnd it’s been recognized by the International Olympic Committee, which means someday we might cheer on our country’s underwater hockey team as they try to win gold.\n\nApril 17 in Japan is known as Queen Day, as in the rock band fronted by Freddie Mercury.\n\nIt was today in 1975 that the band came to Japan for the first time.\n\nNow the day is a pretty big annual celebration.\n\nQueen fans in Japan also mark Freddie’s birthday on September 5!\n\nDeep dive into the world of underwater hockey (ESPN)\n\nThe Pandemic Hasn’t Dulled Japan’s Special Love for Queen (Atlas Obscura)\n\nTeam up with us!
