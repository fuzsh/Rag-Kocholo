        "text": "What is Octopush? a perspective from Slough\n\nOctopush is underwater hockey and is the supreme aerobic game. It was invented in the early 1950s by sub-aqua divers in Southsea who got bored just swimming up and down pool lanes to get fit. Now the game has spread to much of the English speaking world, and also to France. Underwater hockey is fast, furious, and fun ... and you can join in.\n\nHow do you play?\n\nPlayers wear the basic equipment of a mask, snorkel, fins, and water polo hat. They hold a small stick, about the size of a spatula, in a gloved hand. The idea of the game is to use the stick to push the two kilogramme puck into the opposing team's goal, which consists of a two metre tray at the opposing end of a 25 metre pool.\n\nWhy is it the supreme aerobic game?\n\nAll other sports allow the participants to breathe as they play. But in underwater hockey, players breate through their snorkels on the top of the water before diving down to do battle with their opponents. Some players can stay down for a long time indeed, but the real skill of the game is judging when to dive. It can take just a few seconds to tackle an opponent and pass the puck to a colleague, and then return to the surface for a well-earned breath!\n\nHow many play?\n\nThere are 10 people in a team, but only six are allowed in the water at one time. This results in fast substitutions which resemble tag wrestling. The idea is to work quickly, and then get out to recover. This increases the speed and exhilaration of the game.\n\nCan women play too?\n\nYes. Women have a slight disadvantage compared to men, because they are not as strong. But they usually make up for this by being much more skilful. Women can play in a mixed team, and in a single-sex side.\n\nWho can play underwater hockey?\n\nJust about anyone who can swim. It is easy to learn to use a mask and snorkel. This is a stark contrast to sub-aqua diving, which can take many months to master.\n\nWhy should I learn?\n\nMany doctors agree that swimming is an excellent past-time. The problem is that lane swimming is terminally boring. Underwater hockey, however, keeps your mind alert - and your body fit! Many tall people find that underwater hockey is the best way of avoiding back problems.\n\nWhy should I play with Slough?\n\nWe are patient, friendly people who enjoy sport! Slough is the premier underwater hockey side in the ThamesValley, and one of the top ten clubs in Britain. We have players of all ages and abilities, and the more competitive newcomers could find themselves in the main side within months. Social events are an important part of club activities.\n\nWhen do you play?\n\nSlough Underwater Hockey Club is based at the Centre Pool, behind Farnham Road, Slough. The juniors play from 5pm on Sundays, and the adults take over from 6pm.\n\nHow much does it cost?"
