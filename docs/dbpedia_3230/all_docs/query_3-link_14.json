        "text": "Underwater Hockey\n\nIt's like hockey, but underwater. We are a coed club that plays Underwater Hockey. We compete against each other and other schools in the US and Canada. We play on the bottom of the pool, using fins for movement, a mask to let you see, and a snorkel to help with breathing. There is a weighted puck that stays on the bottom, and we use sticks about 12 inches long to hit it and control it. Two teams of 6 face off and attempt to score the puck into the opposing teams goal. No experience necessary, just the ability to swim and an inherent fear of dolphins."
