Her question – “Underwater What?” – could have been on the lips of anyone outside the University of Minnesota’s Aquatic Center.\n\nUnderwater hockey is probably destined to swim forever behind ice hockey, field hockey, air hockey, street hockey and – euphemistically – horse hockey. But underwater hockey had the pool to itself over the weekend, when 20 teams from around the country converged on the university for the Underwater Hockey National Championships.\n\n“It’s not just a sport, it’s a social atmosphere,” said Tricia Simon, 22, who came with a team from Michigan State University. “A tournament like this is one big party.”\n\nPlayers wear goggles, snorkels and flippers and use short, curved sticks, usually made of wood or plastic, to maneuver a 3-pound puck along the bottom of the pool. The goals are long and squat, like troughs. There are six players per side but no goalies – it’s hard enough to score. Formations and plays are often abandoned as swimmers come up for air, and players diving back into the action might need a moment or two to find the puck, which is coated in pink plastic, and sort out teammates (one team wears white swimcaps, the other wears blue).\n\nIn “open” tournaments such as this one, teams are made up of any six people a club can cobble together. Most were coed to varied degrees, and players ranged from teens to veterans and veritable legends in their 50s.\n\nOne commonality: Players on every team seemed to know one another. Relationships have formed through years of tournaments. There were group hugs before matches, group chants after them, and few of the 20 teams regarded the actual competition as a priority.\n\nThe second-best of Minnesota’s two teams – both are from Minnesota’s Underwater Hockey Club – had the luck of drawing its first match against Club Puck of San Jose, Calif., regarded by most as America’s best. Minnesota lost 9-0, prompting one local supporter to dismiss the winners as “just a bunch of thugs in cheap swimsuits.”\n\n“We knew we were going to lose, so we just have fun,” said Karen Thullner, 38, a clothing designer who has been with the Minnesota club since the early ’90s. “You pick (the puck) off a good player or get a good move on one of the world’s best guys and it’s like ‘Woohoo! – I’m not so bad after all.’ ”\n\nThere are no youth leagues or camps for underwater hockey. Only one high school, in Cincinnati, brought a team to Minneapolis. So players tend to jump into the pool from life-guarding, gymnastics, volleyball, basketball and other non-hockey backgrounds.\n\nChris Thommaso, 26, played soccer and basketball and did some life-guarding and scuba before finding the club at the University of Illinois. When he moved to Minnesota three years ago, through his engineering job with Dow Chemical, he had a ready-made social network here through the friends he’d made underwater. Thommaso was one of the tournament’s organizers.\n\n“You move to a new city, you don’t know anybody, but you know the hockey team, and when you’re traveling around the country, you know people on other teams and you can stay with them,” he said.\n\nThat’s how it has worked for Thullner, who has stayed and played with teams in Hawaii and Vancouver, B.C.\n\n“They scheduled an extra game for me in Hawaii just because they knew I was coming,” she said.\n\nBen Erickson, a team and tournament organizer who has played with the Minnesota club almost since its inception 25 years ago, said underwater hockey has evolved from something resembling shuffleboard to an activity that puts a premium finesse, stamina and teamwork.\n\n“It used to be a push game and a breath-holding game,” Erickson said. “Now, it’s a game of speed, and instead of holding your breath forever, it’s about holding your breath for 15 seconds and coming up and going back down quickly.”\n\nNot that one can tell the difference from above the water, where the action appears as little more than fins, bobbing blue and white heads and, occasionally, short bursts from several players in this direction or that.\n\nLive, three-camera video beamed onto the center’s jumbo screen throughout the weekend showed lots of quick dips and turns – some players maneuvered with incredible body control – but it took a horn and scoreboard to tell when anyone scored a goal.\n\nDespite its obscurity, underwater hockey has a history dating back to the late 1950s in the United States. Teams from more than 30 countries compete every two years in the world championship tournament. Thommaso is among hopefuls for the United States team competing, in 2008, for the world title in South Africa.\n\n“Players are getting a lot younger but our club is still kinda old, and we’re constantly looking for more players,” Erickson said. “Recruiting is hard because it’s a tough sport to describe. Some think it’s weird, some have a hard time even getting to the bottom of the pool, but some have a real talent for it, and those people are players for life.”\n\nMatt Peiken can be reached at mpeiken@pioneerpress.com or 651-228-5440.\n\n“We knew we were going to lose, so we just have fun.”\n\nKaren Thullner, an underwater hockey player since the early ’90s.\n\nOriginally Published: July 8, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
