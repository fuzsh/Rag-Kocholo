        "text": "Underwater hockey is a team sport that is popular all over the world and is also becoming more and more popular in Germany. The game is played six against six in a pool measuring about 12 x 25 meters and about two meters deep. The playing equipment is a 1.3 kg puck, which is played by the players with the help of a short stick at the bottom of the pool. All players are also equipped with fins, mask and snorkel. It is therefore an apnea sport, no air is carried in compressed air bottles â€“ a good lung capacity is an advantage, but is specifically trained in the training.\n\nUnderwater hockey is a very dynamic sport, where reaction speed and puck control are crucial. It is also the ultimate team sport, as communication underwater is challenging and you depend on your teammate (for every breath). Thus, the team that harmonizes best and has the best division of space usually prevails. In the vast majority of competitions, mixed teams are common, so you play together from training to competition."
