        "text": "Playing hockey beneath the surface of water may sound strange but it is done. Welcome to the world of underwater hockey or octopush as it is known in Britain.\n\nAFP\n\nThe sport involves two teams trying to score with a puck into each other's goal on the surface of a swimming pool. It originated in England in 1954 when Alice Cleverley, the founder of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club invented the game.\n\nThe first World Championship was held in Canada in 1980.\n\nThe teams compile of 10 players but only 6 can take part at any given time.\n\nThe rest of it is pretty much the way hockey is played. Want to try it? Well you better be prepared!"
