        "text": "The family of Team USA Olympian Alex Bowen is hoping to use the excitement of the 2024 Paris Olympics to create a bandwagon of new water polo fans back home in San Diego.\n\nThere was a rocking crowd inside the swimming arena turned water polo venue in Paris, and locked in on every detail was Rod and Barbara Bowen from Santee.\n\n\"So glad we get the chance to experience it with him. It's amazing,\" Rod said.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics stories:\n\nRod has been the head water polo coach at Santana High School for three decades. He watches his son in person any chance he gets.\n\nThanks to savings and fundraisers for the family, they'll catch every game of the Olympics, rising to their feet when their son scores.\n\nWhile most people realize it's a struggle for families to get here, few realize how much the Olympians sacrifice.\n\n\"You think professional athletes, you think of the Olympics here. You think they're all sponsored by Nike and Gatorade and all those places, but they're not, and so a lot of these athletes have to do it on their own dime,\" Hilary Hanson, Alex's fiancé, said.\n\nHanson is helping raise money for him and his teammates by promoting a Coronado-based fundraiser.\n\n\"I am wearing a custom USA water polo shirt, designed by local Coronado brand URT,\" Hanson said.\n\nDesigned specifically for the USA water polo team at the Paris Olympics, 100% of the proceeds go back to the players. Although their flights, meals, housing and gear are covered, this fundraiser helps fill in the gaps of getting to Paris.\n\nAlex — now a three-time Olympian and one of the team's stars — was an All-American all four years at Stanford. Like most of his teammates, he plays professionally overseas when not wearing the red, white and blue.\n\n\"He's making enough money, but not as much as he could with a Stanford degree,\" Rod said.\n\n\"A lot of these guys are playing professionally overseas, but at the same time, working one to two additional jobs,\" Hanson said.\n\nThe team beat Croatia on Monday and is set to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Moments after Monday's big win, Hanson couldn't wait to give her favorite Olympian a huge hug.\n\n\"I've seen so many messages coming through from back home on every platform. It really means a lot getting the love from everyone,\" Alex said.\n\nHaving his family in Paris to celebrate, Alex says it's worth every sacrifice along the way.\n\n\"It's amazing to have my fiancé here, my parents and just all the support — it's fantastic,\" Alex said.\n\nHow to purchase USA water polo x URT shirt"
