We built this map so that anyone can add or edit the details. As an underwater hockey community we can keep this up to date. At the moment this is the most up to date list of underwater hockey clubs around the world. But it will be up to all of us to help keep this updated as time goes on.\n\nDoes it cost anything to use this website?\n\nAbsolutely not. We will never charge anything to use this website. This was created by a traveling underwater hockey player to help make it easier for underwater hockey players to find other clubs around the world.\n\nCan I add a club to the map?\n\nAnyone can add a club to the map. The most important detail about adding clubs to the map is including links(email, websites, social media) so players can contact the club when they want to get in touch and practice with them. Social media links, email, website, and phone contact info are all useful contact details to include.\n\nWhere did the intial map locations come from?\n\nIf you see any clubs added by David Beauchamp then these were clubs he collected from Facebook, Instagram, and a few official and unofficial underwater hockey club lists for various different countries. I'll list the best sources of underwater hockey clubs I have found below. These seem to be the most up-to-date and reliable lists for each region. If you find other similar links then send them to me via the contact page.\n\nAustralia club list\n\nBelgium club list\n\nFrance club list 1\n\nFrance club list 2\n\nJapan Facebook group\n\nNetherlands club list\n\nNew Zealand club list\n\nSouth Africa club list\n\nUK club list\n\nPuck U Tourist\n\nReed consulting world list\n\nGoogle map club list\n\nInternatinal calendar\n\nCMAS"
