        "text": "QUESTION:\n\ngold639 said:\n\nCould you explain the rules of the game?\n\nANSWER:\n\nbrad352 said:\n\nExcerpt of Information: (http://my.pclink.com/~jrogers/uwhockey.htm)\n\nUnderwater Hockey\n\nUnderwater Hockey is a game played on the bottom of a swimming pool. Players use only mask, snorkel, fins, a specially shaped stick, and padded glove, or something similar to protect the hand that holds the stick. The puck is weighted, usually made of lead with a plastic coating to protect the pool bottom.\n\nThere are 6 players from each team in the water during the periods of play, which usually consist of two 10 to 15 minute periods, with the teams switching ends at half-time. Each team may have a number of substitute players, with substitution generally allowed both during play and during breaks in play, which include half-time, penalty calls, and following a score.\n\nCan I play? and what do I have to bring?\n\nMN Underwater Hockey is very informal, and everyone is welcome. All you have to do is show up at a practice with your own mask, fins and snorkel, along with the other usual swimming pool attire. We will have a stick for you to use, and maybe even a padded glove, but it would be advisable for you to bring your own padded glove for your strong hand (stick-holding hand). Once you see how the game is played, you will probably want to adjust your stick and glove to your own liking. Contact us before if you want us to bring gear for you.\n\nSwimming Ability\n\nThis is not a good sport for novice swimmers. You should be comfortable in the water, both in deep water and shallow. You should also feel comfortable using a mask, snorkel, and fins. The rest of the skills are learned only by coming to practice. Don't worry if you can't hold your breath very long, this will improve with practice along with other hockey-related skills.\n\nAgain, let me emphasize that our practices are very informal. Don't be afraid that you are signing on to a life-long commitment. Come and give it a try. We are always glad to see people at practice, but we will continue to play even if you don't come every practice night.\n\nCheers everyone!"
