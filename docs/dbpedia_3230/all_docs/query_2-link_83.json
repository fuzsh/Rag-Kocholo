        "text": "Owen McDonough, a 20-year-old IU student in the Media School, drowned July 28 in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nAccording to the Nevada Appeal, Placer County Emergency Dispatch received a call at 5:15 p.m. from Whale Beach. McDonough had been swimming in the lake with friends when, according to a press release by the Carson City coroner, he was overcome by rough waters. After several minutes underwater, he was pulled ashore, but medics from the North Tahoe Fire Department were unable to resuscitate him. Alcohol did not appear to have been involved.\n\nMcDonough, originally from Villa Hills, Kentucky, was a rising junior studying sports media at IU. He was also a student broadcaster for IU Club Hockey. He previously wrote for the Indiana Daily Student's sports desk, covering IU club hockey.\n\n“His classmates and professors remember him as kind, passionate, and a talented broadcaster and writer,” Media School Dean David Tolchinsky wrote in a press release sent out Thursday. “I know you will all join me as we at The Media School extend our deepest condolences to Owen’s family and friends.”\n\nA GoFundMe campaign organized by a friend, Cameron Jamison, to pay for funeral expenses surpassed its goal in less than 24 hours.\n\n“He was a son, brother, student, roommate, friend, and family member to those lucky to know him,” the campaign description reads. “Studying at Indiana University as a sports media major, he was a compelling writer with enthusiastic aspirations for sports journalism. With plans to commentate the Indiana University club hockey team during his third year, his future to fulfill his passions was unfortunately taken from him. Although missed by everyone around him we know he is in a better place now.”\n\nCounseling and support services are available to students from Counseling and Psychological Services and TimelyCare.\n\nUPDATE: This story was updated to mention Owen McDonough's work for the IDS."
