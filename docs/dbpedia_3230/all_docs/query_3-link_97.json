        "text": "Underwater Hockey (otherwise known as Octopush) is the sport of hockey brought into a pool environment. Played at the bottom of the pool with two goals at either end, a puck, and a short hockey stick. The player additionally wears a snorkel, mask, flippers, and a glove. All of this equipment is provided making it an easy sport to get into even if you have never played it before. The majority of our players had never even heard of the sport before university including people who were part of the highly successful team we sent to Student Nationals in Leed!. In addition to Student Nationals, we also compete in regular competitions with other teams across Scotland and the UK and often meet up with these clubs for informal training sessions and friendlies.\n\nOur current training:\n\nWednesday 19:45 - 2100, Dalry Swim Centre\n\nThis training is done with the city team who help to provide training and develop our match abilities. Drop us a message or just turn up to give it a go!\n\nWe also have regular socials and as a new club we would love to meet new members! Our socials range from pot luck, to glove making, to clubbing, and these often happen after training so there are no worries of missing out on a good Wednesday night out.\n\nCONTACT: If you have any further questions about getting involved with the club please don't hesitate to contact us at underwater.hockey@ed.ac.uk or message any of our social media!\n\nOur Club Values:"
