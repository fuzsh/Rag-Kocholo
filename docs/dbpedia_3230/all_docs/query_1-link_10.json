        "text": "Underwater Hockey is an underwater sport that is similar to hockey. This game is usually played in a swimming pool, where the players push a puck along the bottom. This game is also called Octopush (in the UK) and UWH.\n\nThe teams have up 10 members each, with 6 playing the competition. The game consists of two halves, usually ten to fifteen minutes each half. Players wear snorkels and have to come up for air every now and then.\n\nSome of the equipment used include mask, snorkel, fins, stick, puck, hat, hlove, and a goal. The sticks are about 30 cm long and the puck is heavier than usual (about 1.3 kg) so that it stays at the bottom.\n\nUnderwater Hockey was developed in the United Kingdom by Alan Blake in the 1950âs. He was the founder of an Aqua Club, and together with companions, they played the first game in Porstmouth, England.\n\nSimilar Sports\n\nUnderwater Ice Hockey — a very different sport, in which the play is upside down underneath a frozen pool or pond\n\nRelated Pages"
