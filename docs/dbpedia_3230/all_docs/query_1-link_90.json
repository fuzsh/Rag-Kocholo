        "text": "Watching underwater hockey for the first time is about as head-scratching as the sport itself.\n\nPlayers on the Roger Bacon High School Underwater Hockey team – the first and, at present, only high school-affiliated team in the nation – will tell you they’ve fielded their share of confused looks and perplexed comments from skeptics.\n\nIt’s not a sport. (Actually, there are men’s and women’s Team USA national underwater hockey teams that play internationally, the pinnacle for any number of athletes/teams governed by USA Underwater Hockey.)\n\nI saw that sport you play on the Olympics. (No,sir, that was water polo.)\n\nIt’s not nice to lie to your elders. (Really, ma’am, we’re in town for an underwater hockey tournament. We’re not trying to sass you.)\n\nWho’s ever heard of such a thing? (Around here, no one but the team. However, with four national titles under their caps since the program’s inception in 1997, Roger Bacon’s team is well-respected as a pioneer across the country and in Canada.)\n\nIt’s co-ed? (Yes, it is.)\n\nAll that being said, watch and it only takes minutes to realize it’s not a spectator sport. Parents and fans lining the pool’s sidelines enjoy a scene not far removed from summer pool play, complete with splashing and snorkels. Looking under the surface, figuratively and literally, underwater hockey formations and strategies don’t veer far from their sister sports – hockey and soccer.\n\nThe concept is simple: Six players wearing fins, snorkels, a glove and masks push their pucks with a 10- to 12-inch wooden stick on the bottom of a pool, connecting passes to teammates or trying to steal from opponents. Each team defends its own (unmanned) goal and tries to score in the opposite one.\n\nSo, no, it's not your ordinary high school athletic team.\n\nIn fact, the 2016-2017 team is more young and inexperienced than Roger Bacon has witnessed in years.\n\nSenior underwater hockey captains Abby Merz and Ben Leo looked around the bus on the way to their first tournament of the year Nov. 12-13 in Charleston, South Carolina, and didn’t see too many familiar faces. There was senior Gabe Schulten and head coach Paul ‘Doc’ Wittekind, and that’s it.\n\nNo doubt the fresh faces came to the team the same way Merz, Leo and Schulten did – through Doc’s history class.\n\n“In American history, Doc showed videos describing the sport to class our freshmen year. We wanted him to do it in order to distract him from the lessons, but what started out as a joke became who we are,” Leo said.\n\nThis year’s team needs the trio’s veteran guidance – skills honed through exposure to former Roger Bacon underwater hockey greats Kevin Anneken, Alex Mathis, Sadie Dimuzio and Joey “Loaf” Hinneken. In fact, Anneken and Mathis came to the South Carolina tournament and suited up for the games – a regular practice welcomed and encouraged of any alum – offering laughs, camaraderie and wisdom.\n\nThe team spent the weekend playing college teams and adults – people of all shapes and sizes – basically learning to sink and swim.\n\n‘That’s not a real sport’\n\nBecause there is only one high school-affiliated team in Ohio, it’s not surprising many local people have never heard of underwater hockey. Although it’s more likely people outside the city and state have heard of the Spartans’ team. Each athlete faces the same response – and will happily show you the looks they get: Incredulity.\n\n“We were pushing in all our stuff to the hotel, and a middle-aged couple asked us what we came for,” Leo said of a past tournament. “The couple got angry at us because they thought we were lying, but then Abby came up and described the sport.”\n\nNot everyone is clueless. Leo remembers his godfather commenting on how he played the sport in Taiwan and Abby met a Canadian who knew about it.\n\nThe sport itself, originally called Octopush, started in the United Kingdom in the 1950s to give divers something to do in the winter when they were unable to compete. Strong in Britain, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, the U.S. version came in the 1970s.\n\nWittekind, who with assistant coach David Dozer, played the sport at Ohio State University in the early 1990s, said Roger Bacon is the oldest and most continuous high school underwater hockey team in the United States. There are some club teams of high school age on the west coast. Wittekind, faculty chairman for the social studies department, brought the sport to Roger Bacon in 1997 after students noticed his sport in a get-to-know-the-new-teacher article in the school newspaper.\n\nWhat’s it like to play?\n\nWhile it’s really not a spectator sport, Merz said the larger tournaments have viewing areas or underwater cameras to help fans see what the players see.\n\n“The water is pretty cold when you get in, but you get used to it mostly. So, if I were to line up on the wall as a ‘2’ (a forward position in the formation) then my responsibility is to win the puck off the initial gong,” Merz said.\n\nThe metal stick gong or electronic chime helps the players – lined in a simple 3-3 formation – know when a play is over or if a foul has been called. Otherwise, Merz said, you hear the tapping of the stick against the floor (as a mode of communication between teammates) or the stick hitting the puck. They strategically take turns coming above water for air.\n\nThe mass of bodies kicking about means injuries are inevitable. Abby sustained her first injury in her four-year tenure Nov. 12 when she got a kick to the face and a bloody nose. Oddly enough, there isn’t much pain from collision, kicks or elbows, because the water acts as a buffer.\n\nTradition of excellence\n\nAssistant coach Alex Mathis, who played for Roger Bacon from 2007-2012, was a member of the 2012 U.S. underwater hockey team for his age group that played in America’s Cup in Milwaukee against Canada, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nHe’s picked up a lot of hardware since he began playing six years ago.\n\nMathis started playing the game the summer between seventh and eighth grade as a member of Bacon’s first underwater hockey camp (2007), then went to nationals in Minnesota when Doc asked if he wanted to play with the junior varsity team.\n\nIn Charleston, Mathis joined the kids in the water, where he scored some goals and made an impression on the new players.\n\nPart of why he came back is to help Doc train them. He believes if he helps them grow, he helps the sport grow and stay strong for many years.\n\n“There’s a lot of reasons I show up to Bacon’s practices. Initially, I like to get the extra swim time in. Slower scrimmage. Underwater hockey has been a part of my life for a long time,” he said.\n\nDuring his six years, he made a lot of memories winning national medals with his friends. Roger Bacon has won its division four times at USA Underwater Hockey's annual U.S. National Championships: 2001 in the \"C\" Division (San Jose, California); 2007 in the \"C\" Division (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota); 2010 in the \"B\" Division (University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida); and 2011 in the \"B\" Division (Santa Clarita, California).\n\nA 2013 sbnation.com article on the team lauded the Spartans as a perennial favorite at nationals and identified it as a strong club.\n\n“The big difference was just experience between this team and those,” he said. “It might be the largest influx of new players I’ve ever seen.”\n\nWhile the number of inexperienced players makes a fifth national championship unlikely this year, the examples set by alumni and traditions upheld by current players guarantee respect and support from the underwater hockey community as a whole.\n\nPassing down the tradition\n\nMerz heard about underwater hockey from her soccer teammates Liza Hoopes and Shelby Watterson.\n\n“Shelby, who’s a year older than me, took me under her wing and showed me how to be a part of this team. She’s gone now, but I feel myself falling into the role trying to take care of the new players, including my sister, Anna,” she said.\n\nMerz saw improvement just since the beginning of the weekend’s tournament. She said every single person had the desire to stay in – wanting to be in the game – even when they were losing. Merz said Jillian Leonard quickly has become one of the fastest to the puck. Molly Back single-handedly stopped a larger college man from advancing. Lydia Trentman, whom the captains named MVP of the tournament, showed her own leadership qualities at forward.\n\n“It’s good to see how our leadership had a part in them developing as players,” Merz said.\n\nJunior captain Joe King already has the mental wheels turning for next year’s season.\n\nAfter scoring several goals in the South Carolina tournament, he sustained an injury to his dominant hand but decided to switch hands to keep playing. His decision sent coaches and team moms searching for an opposite-hand glove.\n\n“I’m a captain; I couldn’t sit out. That would discourage the younger players and be the opposite of a morale booster. I tried playing with my (injured) right hand, but that didn’t work out,” he said.\n\n“I’ve been looking for leadership qualities from a few of the new players. Next year, I’m going to need a captain to lead the other team and I’ll need about three people to fill those roles. “\n\nWith regard to the sport, King said, “I’m good at it. It gives me a chance to be a top dog at something. It gives me a chance to practice being a leader and teaching people because I know next year is my time.”\n\nHe said Jordan Sandlin and Anna Merz, who played on King’s team in Charleston, also showed promise in the first weekend through aggressive play and leadership qualities, such as cheering on the other team or getting others to start warming up.\n\nSomething for everyone...\n\nMariela Jaen likes the fact the sport is inclusive. Her son, Gabe, who has Asperger’s syndrome, has found a home on the team.\n\n“I think this sport needs everybody’s skills,” she said. “You have something to give, no matter if you are small, stocky, fast or deliberate; you need that.”\n\nThe sport needs that diversity, not only in gender but skills. More than one athlete pointed to graduate Sadie Dimuzio as their role model for tough play, as she was willing and quite able to take on opponents twice her size.\n\nTo even the most casual observer, team moms are the lifeline to this program, managing the details, supporting the coaches and mothering all the kids as their own.\n\n“The support that we have from the managers, we feel like a family group here,” she said. If her son goes to a tournament without her, she’s comforted that another mother knows how to handle any situations that might arise.\n\nShe said Gabe was named captain in the South Carolina tournament, elected by his peers, which is an opportunity he might never have had in other sports.\n\nAll the athletes feel acceptance throughout the greater underwater hockey community because they are high school students playing college-level and adult teams. While some teams take offense to losing to them, for the most part, encouragement is always forthcoming.\n\nAfter her first tournament freshman year, Merz said she felt she was among her type of people, a group who supports each other inside and outside the pool.\n\n“Doc always tells us we’re the best kids in the school and while some people are equal to us, there are none who are better,” Merz said.\n\nHow to get involved\n\nRoger Bacon hosts a week-long summer camp in June for rising sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade students interested in underwater hockey. Current players run the camp. Contact Paul Wittekind at pwittekind@rogerbacon.org for more information.\n\nSince Mathis’ 2012 graduation, he has played with Team Cincinnati, currently an all-Roger Bacon alumni squad that practices at UC but is not affiliated with the college. It’s an A Division team that will host the national tournament in June.\n\nAdults who would like to play with Team Cincinnati can contact Alex at mathisjn@mail.uc.edu."
