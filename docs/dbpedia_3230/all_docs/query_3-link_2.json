        "text": "Welcome to USOA Underwater Hockey!\n\nThis non-contact snorkeling sport has two teams of six facing off on the bottom of the pool. The weighted puck can be pushed, slid, or flicked with a short stick into the goal. Equipment includes mask, fins, snorkel with mouthguard, glove, water polo cap and stick. Typical dives last anywhere from 5-20 seconds as the fast-paced game is played. Please look under “Regions” or email us for games in your area. Tournaments are held regionally and nationally. Bi-annually there are international competitions.\n\nThe following materials are available for underwater hockey clubs to utilize in their search for venues. We are hopeful they may change some pools' perspectives on the safety of the sport and improve venue accessibility.\n\n1) A peer-reviewed medical journal article on the misleading classification of underwater hockey as an apneic sport.\n\n2) A presentation from the University of Auckland regarding hypoxia\n\n3) A safety statement from USOA"
