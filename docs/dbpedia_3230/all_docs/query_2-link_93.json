        "text": "If the abundance of Olympic sports persuades you to take up a new discipline in autumn — maybe something you'd never thought of before — you may want to consider its safety first.\n\nNew research compared the number of athletes in each discipline to the number of reported injuries, determining the sports with the highest risk factors.\n\nThe findings are somewhat surprising: BMX emerged as the most dangerous Olympic sport, with a 34.38% injury rate, while table tennis and handball were more injury-prone than equestrian and trampoline.\n\nBMX — an abbreviation for bicycle motocross — is a cycle sport performed on small bicycles in competitive racing or freestyle, either on the street or off-road tracks.\n\nThe peak injury rate was registered at the Rio 2016 Olympics, with 37.5% of athletes sustaining traumas.\n\nTaekwondo — a Korean martial art and combat sport involving punching and kicking — follows closely, with nearly 30% of athletes suffering injuries.\n\nFootball is the most dangerous team sport, with over 27% of its 1,508 competitors experiencing injuries. Handball is the second most dangerous team endeavour, trailing by nearly 10%, with an average of 17.98% injured athletes.\n\nBoxing had the second-highest number of injured athletes at the Tokyo Olympics, indicating a growing risk. You can take a look at the full list below.\n\nWhich Olympic sports have the highest injury rate?\n\nBMX cycling, 34.38%\n\nTaekwondo, 29.92%\n\nFootball, 27.19%\n\nMountain bike cycling 22.44%\n\nBoxing, 18.12%\n\nHandball, 17.98%\n\nHockey, 16.55%\n\nWeightlifting, 15.86%\n\nWater polo, 14.03%\n\nAthletics, 13.04%\n\nJudo, 12.44%\n\nTriathlon, 11.59%\n\nWrestling, 11.33%\n\nBasketball, 10.69%\n\nArtistic gymnastics, 10.54%\n\nBadminton, 9.65%\n\nTennis, 9.44%\n\nBeach volleyball, 9.38%\n\nVolleyball, 7.42%\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) implemented a multi-sport injury surveillance system for the first time at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nThis data was collected from the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM) and processed by Casinority researchers. It takes into account all Summer Games between Beijing 2008 and Tokyo 2020.\n\nThe London 2012 Olympics had the highest overall injury rate, with 12.8% of athletes reporting injuries.\n\nWhich Olympic sports are the safest?\n\nIt might come as a surprise, but most sports on the opposite side of the table are associated with what we generally deem to be risk factors or tools: guns, water, horses, and arrows.\n\nCanoeing/kayaking boasts the safest record of all Olympic sports, with an average injury rate of just 2.23, which narrows down to 1.2% in canoe slalom. The full list is below.\n\nCanoeing/kayaking (all types) 2.23%\n\nShooting, 2.24%\n\nRowing, 2.25%\n\nArchery, 3.65%\n\nSwimming, 3.78%\n\nCycling - Track, 4.24%\n\nGymnastics - Trampoline. 4.69%\n\nEquestrian, 4.73%\n\nTable tennis, 4.83%\n\nModern pentathlon, 6.05%\n\nAll types of kayaking and canoeing are considered safe Olympic sports, with an average injury rate of 2.23%.\n\nOf 987 competitors considered, only 22 injuries were recorded. Shooting is also relatively safe, with a similar injury rate of 2.24% and 26 injuries across three Olympic Games.\n\nRowing follows closely behind, averaging a 2.25% injury rate out of 1,640 Olympians, with only 3% of athletes injured in 2020."
