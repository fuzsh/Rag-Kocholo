        "text": "Five athletes from Door County have been selected to represent the United States at next month’s Underwater Hockey Age Group World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nThey include two women – Molly Banks and Kailee Moe – and three men – Mark Herrell, Owen Foulds and Ezra Linnan – who will be competing on their respective U24 teams for players born in 2001 or later.\n\nThe teams are co-coached by Molly Banks’ parents, Sturgeon Bay locals Kendall and Sue Banks, who were also involved in selecting the players.\n\n“We’re really impressed with the progress made since the team candidates first got together,” Kendall Banks said. “The commitment towards training and implementation of the game plan started at a high level and has seemed to grow.”\n\nKendall and Sue Banks, who moved from California to Door County when Molly Banks was 10, also organized the underwater hockey program at the Door County YMCA, which has a team known as the Sturgeons.\n\nThe USA is sending three teams to the World Championships in three divisions: U24 Men, U24 Women, and U19 Men. Teams from around the globe will compete July 16-27 in a series of games to be livestreamed and commentated on YouTube.\n\nMolly Banks said underwater hockey is a unique and physically demanding sport that involves two teams of six players and four subs each, who compete to maneuver a puck across the pool floor into the opposing team’s goal.\n\nPlayers are equipped with fins, gloves, masks, snorkels and small sticks to push the three-pound puck across the bottom of the pool floor.\n\nMolly Banks said the sport requires remarkable breath control, fitness and teamwork, making it a thrilling event for both participants and spectators.\n\nMolly Banks, a 22-year-old marketing graduate of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, said she has a background in swimming and began at age 11 playing underwater hockey, which provides her the opportunity to compete in the pool in a team sport.\n\nTechnically a no-contact sport, she said “lots of fouls” are typically called during two 15-minute halves when three referees are in the water and one on the deck.\n\nMolly Banks said the USA’s players come from different parts of the country, including Illinois, Colorado, California and Nevada, and the Door County players get to practice together when everyone is home.\n\n“Training for a big competition like this can be challenging, especially when your team is scattered across the country,” she said. “Having such a big presence here in Sturgeon Bay has been a great motivator for both teams.”\n\nTo get more time as a team, both the U24 Men and Women were able to host training camps. The U24 Women hosted a training camp in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, back in March, and the U24 Men recently hosted a training camp in Brown Deer and Sturgeon Bay.\n\nMolly Banks said the athletes continue to train at their respective clubs around the country and look forward to traveling to Malaysia and the high-level competition that awaits.\n\nTo follow the teams on their journey this July, check out their social media accounts and web pages on the official USOA website at underwater-society.org.\n\nFor more information on the World Championships, visit the tournament website at 6thuwhagworlds.com."
