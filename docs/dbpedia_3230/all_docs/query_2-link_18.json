        "text": "how did you get a pair of gull mew's if they are japan only?\n\nand god i want ala's\n\nactually to be honest i just really want an all rubber fin that isn't short and light (classic swim fins)\n\nI got my Gull Hard Mews through another Scubaboard member resident in the Far East. Here's what I wrote when responding to a recent ScubaBoard thread about purchasing Gull equipment:\n\nHave a look at the following Scubabaord thread:\n\nGull Diving Fins\n\nI know it's a bit over a year old, but have a look at the last message in the thread where a forum member offers to ship Gull gear anywhere in the world. You could PM the poster to find out more.\n\nIf that fails, there is another option that might yield results. There are Japanese companies which will purchase Japanese goods on behalf of westerners who can't speak the language. One example may be:\n\nNippon Export - Buy directly from Japan! Manga, Anime, DVD, CD, OST...\n\nGull products never appear to be distributed as far as Europe or America, more's the pity, but they are available in the Far East (e.g. Malaysia, Thailand) and even New Zealand:\n\nSplash\n\nKeep an eye on eBay, as Technisub Alas occasionally appear there. About 80 different models of full-foot rubber fin are still in production worldwide. My current favourites are Mexican-made Escualo Clasicas:\n\nbut there are plenty of other brands if you don't want lightweight Malaysian-made ones. Two kinds, both I believe manufactured in the USA, are:\n\nOceanways Aquapro\n\n[URL=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GG8FNW/?tag=scubapulse-20\"]http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GG8FNW/?tag=scubapulse-20[/URL]\n\nMares Corda\n\nMares Corda Full Foot Fins 496007 with reviews at scuba.com\n\nConsider too IST Sea Diver fins, which are made in Taiwan and quite heavy:\n\nBuy IST Sea diver snorkel fins F-12 with reviews at scuba.com\n\nThere are actually quite a few options when it comes to full foot fins. One search on Amazon.com reveals the options:\n\nHowever all of these fins are similar in that they are extremely light and flimsy (offering great cadence and safety, while little in power). And as well all know, hockey require power. That is where Ala's, Nemo's, and Mare's Quattro's come in.\n\nThe Nemo's - great ankle breakers\n\nHow are those gull mew fins in terms of rigidity?\n\nAnd I do see Technisub Ala's from time to time on ebay. However it is UK ebay, and the sellers never ship to the US. Which is a shame, because I've seen my 6.5/7.5 40/41 size recently on eBay. :depressed: TWICE!!"
