        "text": "This blog post was written by our newest player, ≈Ωeljko ≈†vediƒá, right after his first time trying UWH. Thanks, ≈Ωeljko! üôÇ\n\n‚ÄúThis is for you, kid,‚Äù said my uncle, ‚Äúhave fun!‚Äù\n\nI was 12 and I got my first mask and fins. I loved it. I would go every day to the seaside, to the rocky pier, and dive next to rusty, oily boats. I would take a deep breath and plunge to depths eager to see what is below. And there were so many things: broken plates, coca-cola cans, and even some fish. I got better and better until I could freedive 14 meters deep to the old car tire hosting a crab who was surprised by a pimply visitor.\n\n‚ÄúThis must be how being a dolphin feels like!‚Äù I thought to myself. They are air-breathing mammals, same as me, going periodically to surface to take a breath. Then they would dive under and play catch with each other.\n\n28 years later I was killing my time drinking beer in a smoky Berlin bar. ‚Äú..underwater hockey,‚Äù mentioned a girl next to me. I turned my head and joined the enthusiastic conversation about the obscure underwater sport. ‚ÄúIf you did free diving, you should totally do it, it is great!‚Äù Sumi said. Playing underwater like dolphins? I was in.\n\nWhen I came for Wednesday training, the entire team assembled to help me. I got pink fins from one person, a white hockey stick from another, and mask from the third. Alex took it as his job to train me before the practice match. We did puck pushing, passing, and turning in a small kids pool. Easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get into the big pool and score some goals. It was going to be great.\n\nWe entered the big pool and divided into two teams. I was assigned to be front right, as passing partner to Alex. ‚ÄúStart!‚Äù, someone shouted and we all swam towards the little green puck. As I dived in, Alex was already two meters in front of me. He didn‚Äôt have the puck for long, two people from another team attacked and engaged in something like underwater tennis. I got myself into action, meaning I got somebody‚Äôs fin in my butt, and somebody‚Äôs else knee in my face. I mean, I am not sure knee and fin were not from the same person, we were all a big ball of human flesh. In the excitement of that sexy moment, I forgot that air is a necessary requirement for a long life. My brain suddenly reminded me with a gentle thought ‚ÄúAir! Get some air or you will die!‚Äù and adrenaline overdose. I jumped out of the water like a mating salmon and started hyperventilating. A girl dived out next to me, took three breaths, gave me a look and dived down again. ‚ÄúBoy, these people are hard-core,‚Äù I said to myself and dived down. When I looked around, the puck was already on a different part of the pool. I mean, I am not sure if the puck was there, but there is where I saw an amorphous ball of hands, panties, and fins so I swam in that direction. As I approached, a battle of underwater tenis was abruptly interrupted by a white-pants enemy player who decided to play for himself and separated from the crowd. I swam to block his way, but it was like chasing a torpedo. He whizzed by me and put the puck in a metal goal.\n\nOur brave team regrouped and started talking about strategy for the next round. My strategy was not to forget to breathe. At a start signal, we rushed again to the center, and this time I was watching for my chance from the surface. When crowd around the puck got smaller I dived in and actually got to touch the puck with my stick. My joy was not long-lived, as a member of the other team started fighting for it with me. In that tug-of-war, I was pushing as hard as I could, but the opponent had the same cunning plan. My brain screamed ‚ÄúAir!‚Äù and I went out. By the time my heart stopped pounding, the puck was again in our goal. Seems both my team‚Äôs strategy and my personal strategy to remember to breathe were falling. In addition, a team member told me that it is not allowed to push the stick with two hands. I guess the underwater police didn‚Äôt care because I lost the puck anyway.\n\nIn the third round, I didn‚Äôt get to any action, but at least I got some air.\n\nThen, our team got a ‚Äúpenalty shot‚Äù. My team member would start in the back and I would be in the front. We assembled at the bottom of the pool and started. The puck was suddenly next to me, finally my chance! I took it, swam by the opposing player and want unstoppably towards their goal. Wow, can‚Äôt believe it, I am going to score. Then I noticed everybody stayed in the first half of the pool. I swam to the surface and Alex told me ‚ÄúYou are not supposed to take the puck away when there is a penalty shot, we were just supposed to protect the sides of the penalty kicker.‚Äù Andy Warhol once said, ‚ÄúIn the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.‚Äù It seems my future was not going to happen that day, and I will have to swallow much more chlorinated water before I become good with these underwater battles.\n\nThe game continued at the same pace for 20 more minutes. A lot of feeding frenzy scenes with human bodies all over each other like Berghain dark room at 4 am. Diving down, fighting for a puck, remembering to get air. Rinse, repeat. I got a better feeling for a strategy of the game, which is not surprising considering where I started. One time I even succeeded to intercept the torpedo with white pants, yay!\n\nAfter half an hour the game ended. I thanked everybody for lending me their equipment and went for a long hot-shower meditation. My heart was still fast and chlorinated water was running from my nose. As I arrived home I dropped tiredly to my bed. With a smile on my face. Maybe my underwater play was more that of a sea cow than a dolphin, but still, it was a great, great experience that I want to repeat.\n\nOn the 22nd of July, it finally was time for one of the biggest competitions in Germany, the Munich open air. Well, Munich is an overstatement, as it‚Äôs located in the middle of nowhere basically. But nonetheless, it gives you the chance to enjoy the wonderful countryside of Bayern.\n\nHalf of our team left early and probably had the chance to enjoy this a bit more. The car I took left Berlin at around 5:30 pm. The drive roughly took us 7 hours and we arrived at around 2 am in the morning. Here we came to a darkened camping site where most of the players had pitched their tents and were in a deep coma like sleep. Yet some from our team was waiting on us with a beer and a campfire. So after pitching our tent and drinking a beer, enjoying the stars, you don‚Äôt see them like that in Berlin, pity really. We joined the others with a coma like sleep to prepare for the big day tomorrow.\n\nWaking up was not without its complications but after a few hours, a hot shower and a nice cup of coffee we were ready to go to the pool. A wonderful pool in the open air, no surprise there, with two playing fields and a place to swim and practice. After finding our spot and taking a short nap it was time to jump in! The sun seemed to be absent, and with the tiredness, I was wondering how to make it till the end of the day. The first three matches were played in a grey and cloudy morning, but after that, the sun came out and the whole day changed. The weather was amazing! Pro tip from Sumi: bring a wetsuit, yes you need it! I wasn‚Äôt burned that badly for a long time.\n\nFirst German League games\n\nThe day was split into two parts: in the morning in one of the fields there was the first German League! UWH starts to grow more, and Munich was the perfect place to kick off the first German League day. We started with 6 teams and it was great to see the turnout and the motivation of the players. In the second play area, there was an international tournament to decide the level of strength of the different teams.\n\nThe second half of the day, we played a big international tournament. After a total of 10 matches, I can safely say that we were out of energy and starting to get a bit ‚Äì yes bit since we took more than enough food with us ‚Äì hungry.\n\nThe pool was quickly cleaned and after a short shower, we drove back to the camping site, since there the fun would start! After a few beers, we were kindly invited for dinner. Together with around 100 people we were sitting in a big hall enjoying some good food and even better company.\n\nAfter our hunger was stilled and enjoying some delicious beers it was time for the ceremony. (Now I would usually write down the list of teams in order that they won, but since I forgot this we have to deal with it in another way). One of the Dutch teams became first and team Berlin became 10th! The rest of the teams are somewhere between those numbers give or take a few.\n\nThe day ended with good music, a campfire, delicious beer and great company. An amazing and successful tournament, a perfect day and a great ending. Thanks to the Munich team for the organization! We are already looking forward to 2018!\n\nDespite S-Bahn delays, delicate coaches overheating, and sauna-like backseats, Team Berlin made it to the picturesque little town of Trzebnica late on Friday evening. Our first discovery was that we were sharing our accommodation with Walenie, our Polish arch-rivals. After exchanging banter, we wandered through rural Trzebnica to our favourite (and maybe the only) pizza shop where we fuelled up ready for the big Saturday that was coming our way!\n\nGroup Stage\n\nWe drew a good group, but were busy chatting and got caught with our pants down in Game 1 (literally, the game started on time, but we didn‚Äôt all make it into the water). Somehow we still managed to score a runaway first goal, but Walenie managed to get organised and quickly put away two goals. We were testing a new tactic and some new positions for some players, and the result was a bit chaotic. We got it working quite well with a sneaky run up the left hand wall, converted beautifully by a waiting Sumi, but that was all that could be celebrated, as Walenie punished our chaotic structure with a further 5 goals, bringing the final score to 7-2 in their favour.\n\nAfter being woken up by the Walenie disaster Team Berlin rallied together and went on a rampage. Podwodne Pyry were the unfortunate victims, and this time it was our turn to capitalise on chaos, slamming home goal after goal to stop with clock with 9:0 for us. It would have been 10:0, but Mahats was playing around with the puck under his backside rather than putting it in the goal. Regardless, a solid game and definitely good for morale, and we went into our next game with Szuwary.\n\nSzuwary are a tricky team. Sometimes they can field a very physical team that play a strong centre game, but the new tactics seemed to work for us to open the game up. We were still lacking a bit of offensive firepower as our forwards were not used to how far forward they needed to play in the 4v4 structure (UWH is normally 6v6), but did enough to bring home a safe 4:2 win, which was enough to put us in the ‚ÄûA‚Äú pool for the afternoon games.\n\nThe ‚ÄûA‚Äú pool\n\nSo, without really thinking about it, we‚Äôd wound up playing against the top teams. Luckily, we didn‚Äôt have too much time to worry about it, and had to dive into our first game against Piranha‚Äôs top team (which has 2 of the Polish national team!). We were getting used to our structure now, and had a few moments of brilliance, but Piranha‚Äôs well sorted defence caused some issues for us and we only managed to score two goals to their 4. This was a frustrating game for us as skills and fitness-wise, we were very equally matched, but our new tactics and positions weren‚Äôt well locked down.\n\nFor game 5, we played our hosts Hydra. They‚Äôre a very strong team, again with National team players, and Macjek, their captain, is cunning and very good at disrupting play (as well as being a great tournament organiser and youth coach!). Our frustration peaked with this game, as they picked us apart. Our forwards struggled again, and Alan in full back was working overtime. The game ended at 8:0 against us, which was pretty rough. Our next game was Walenie again, and that was a nice opportunity for revenge. After the smackdown delivered by Hydra, it was time for some changes, and we pushed Cris into full forward to give us a bit more bite there, and pulled Sumi into half to help with opening the game out to the sides. Alan moved up into half as well, where he was able to set up the game in the middle, and Libor dropped back into his usual fullback role. This breath of fresh air made all the difference, and we went into the game hungry to show our rivals who was boss. They were quite relaxed and weren‚Äôt at all ready for a determined rampage from Cris right off the first puck all the way through their team to the edge of the goal tray, finished off with clinical precision by Alan. Walenie woke up quickly, but not quickly enough to stop another very beautifully set up goal. The alarm bells started ringing for Walenie, and the game got a lot faster and rougher. We conceded a hard fought goal, but responded in kind, with a big team effort on their goal tray to smash home a great goal. The referee was a joke, and didn‚Äôt allow the goal, as he didn‚Äôt see it (it was taken out by one of their players), and even after they conceded that it was a goal, the ref didn‚Äôt accept it. We fought hard for the last minutes, but could hold out another goal, leaving the score line a disappointing 2:2 draw. It was a great fight though, and in our hearts we knew we had that game in the bag.\n\nThe next game was against the defending champions, the Baltic Seals from Gdansk. They‚Äôre a very good team, with 3 or 4 National team players and a centre forward with legs like tree trunks. We went into this expecting to get smashed, and we were. But our tactics worked beautifully, and although the score line was 6:0 at the end of the time, we made them work very hard (against other teams that beat us, they scored 2 or 4 more goals). Even though we lost, this felt like a highlight for us.\n\nOur last game should have been straightforward, and it started off great. With our beefed up forward line we rocked through their defence without any issues to bring the score line to 2:0 inside the first 3 minutes of play, but then disaster struck. The first 2 goals went though well, but we wore out our forwards, who both subbed, leaving us without a lot of bite in the forward line. In 4v4 the forwards really have to work hard, otherwise a lot of weight tends to fall on the single defender, and this is exactly what happened. We were punished for the mistake with a goal against us. We reorganised, but were shaken, and they scored again, brining the score to 2:2. Our forward power was blunted by some equipment problems (Alan‚Äôs mask self destructed before the game, and the quick repair didn‚Äôt hold up very long), and although we managed to put in one more goal, they also found weak spots twice to end the game with 4:3 for them. This was a very frustrating but a good lesson, and after a bit of venting everyone agreed that next time, we will crush them.\n\nDinner and party\n\nAfter last years‚Äô very average dinner, we weren‚Äôt expecting much. However (according to Majeck) one of the benefits of training a bunch of juniors is that they come packaged with a bunch of helpful parents, and boy, were they helpful. We all agreed afterward that it was the best UWH dinner we‚Äôd been to ‚Äì there were probably 10 different salads, a huge BBQ that just kept going, a whole table full of cakes and sweets, and (a first for Polish hockey I think) even the non-meat eaters where completely stuffed after 4 (4!!!) different kinds of pierogi were brought out.\n\nSo all in all, it was a good trip. Our first Berlin-only tournament (normally we need to recruit some mercenaries), some new tactics, great games, very bad games, lots of learning, and as always in Poland, great people! It‚Äôs super impressive to see how fast Polish hockey has developed, especially the junior program, and it‚Äôs definitely something we can learn from here in Berlin."
