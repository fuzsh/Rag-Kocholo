        "text": "As the South China Morning Post article says about HKUWHA, Hong Kong‚Äôs underwater hockey players are headed for new waters ‚Äì specifically in Chengdu, China this 5/27-30 weekend at the 2nd Annual China Cup. It‚Äôs an exciting time for HKUWHA as we make our very first appearance as a team at an official tournament. We want to wish the warmest luck to our team members who are there this weekend: Darren Foo, Simon Lee, Roxy Liu, Isabel Parra, Liz Sullivan, Mark Sullivan, Flora Tang, and David Yip.\n\nThe SCMP isn‚Äôt the only media reporting about our team. In fact, the spring has been quite an exciting season full of media presence for Hong Kong‚Äôs only underwater hockey team:\n\nIn addition to the article, SCMP also posted an awesome video about underwater hockey‚Äôs increasing popularity in Hong Kong.\n\nFitz HK wrote up an awesome article comparing us to underwater Harry Potter (and let‚Äôs be real, any comparison to Harry Potter is pretty awesome).\n\nOne of Hong Kong‚Äôs legendary sports reporters, Vince Ng (‰ºçÂÆ∂Ë¨ô), visited us at practice and posted subsequent video segments on his Facebook page that features our founder, Henry, and some of our team members. You can see a few other videos from him here and here.\n\nHong Kong Shue Yan University also published an article about our team, giving an introduction to underwater hockey for those unfamiliar with the sport (which might be a lot of you ‚Äì we understand).\n\nThis is only the beginning ‚Äì through our Facebook page, Meetup group and regular summer practices (see below), we‚Äôre excited to see the team continue to grow. See below for upcoming practices and come join us when you‚Äôre free. See you in the water!\n\nMake sure to sign up here for June practices at the Island School (20 Borett Road) so that we know you‚Äôre coming!\n\nWednesdays (7:30PM ‚Äì 9:30PM): Meet at 7PM the taxi stand outside Admiralty Station MTR if you‚Äôre interested in sharing a taxi:\n\nJun* ‚Äì 1, 4 (Sat), 8, 15, 18 (Sat), 22 & 29 (Sat)\n\nJul ‚Äì 6, 13, 20 & 27\n\nAug ‚Äì 3, 10, 17, 24 & 31\n\nSep ‚Äì 7, 14, 21 & 28\n\nOct ‚Äì 5, 12, 19 & 26\n\n*Please note Saturday practices will be held from 1:00PM ‚Äì 3:00PM.\n\nHKUWHA members spent this past weekend in Shenzhen for our first ever event outside of Hong Kong. This was really exciting because we got to meet our fellow UWH players from neighboring Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Zhuhai and spent around 7 hours in the pool across Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAfter a bit of a late start on Saturday due to unexpected traffic and a long taxi queue at Shenzhen Port , the 9 of us ‚Äì Coaches Nowie and Darren, plus Henry, Anna, Susan, Flora, Rox, Tony, and Chelssy ‚Äì met with the Chinese players at the pool in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen. The first hour or so was spent playing games so that the coaches (Nowie and Darren were joined by Coach Yutao from China) could get an idea of what techniques and areas to focus on over the weekend.\n\nThe pool training on Saturday ran from about 12:00PM to 3:00PM, with the coaches leading breathing and swimming drills after the initial games. We wrapped up the afternoon with some more games, trying to keep warm in the increasingly cold pool. Between the 36 participants that were there for the weekend, there was plenty of time for both playing and observing (as substitutes), and definitely time to pose for some photos!\n\nThe Saturday pool session was followed by a 3-hour strategy session held at a cafe. We finally got to see what everyone looked like without a mask/snorkel on through the introductions, and munched on some yummy carbs as the three coaches taught positioning and formations. For a lot of the newer players, it was the first time learning about hockey beyond just the basic swimming with a puck and a stick, and there were some really good questions from the audience about the correct positioning for the players during games.\n\nOn Saturday evening, some of the HKUWHA players went to eat ‚ÄúCoconut Chicken‚Äù hot pot and enjoyed some great live music while we ate. But after that, it was time for bed so we could be at the pool for the Sunday morning pool session!\n\nSunday started out with more swimming drills along with some passing/puck handling, and we topped off the weekend with some more games! It was great to see everyone‚Äôs improvement over just two days of training ‚Äì formations and positioning improved significantly as people became more aware of where to be and who to look for, rather than all rushing towards the puck at once. We went for some good old hot pot (yes, again) afterwards and were headed back to Hong Kong by the late afternoon.\n\nIt was great to meet all the players from China, and it was really nice for HKUWHA members to get to spend some time with each other to bond as a team. Thanks all who came out ‚Äì especially to Kevin and La Nina from Shenzhen for organizing, and to our three coaches Nowie, Darren and Yutao for coaching ‚Äì it was an awesome weekend and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did!\n\nJoin us for a weekend of Underwater Hockey in our exchange event with our UWH neighbors in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Zhuhai!\n\nThis will be HKUWHA‚Äôs first chance to interact with some UWH players outside of HK and we are excited to hold this exchange to play with other underwater hockey lovers üôÇ\n\nWhether you‚Äôve joined us for 10 practices or 0, this is an awesome opportunity for you to learn the sport and improve your skills. We‚Äôll have both pool time and classroom time, and spend the rest of the time getting to know both our teammates and nearby UWH players from China.\n\nTentative schedule:\n\nSaturday, 1/23\n\n11AM-3PM: Pool coaching (UWH skills and techniques)\n\n3PM-5PM: Classroom coaching (this may be adjusted for a bit later to allow time for changing out of suits)\n\n5PM onwards: Dinner & Social time\n\nSunday, 1/24\n\n9AM-1PM: Pool time (games to utilize newly learned techniques!)\n\n1PM onwards: Lunch & Social time; head home\n\nPlease let us know below whether you‚Äôll be able to make it that weekend so we can plan for transportation and hotel logistics by RSVPing on our Facebook page. Estimated registration fee is around HKD200. Other costs will include transportation, hotel, and food (we will, of course, search for the most economic options!)\n\nWe hope you can join us for this exciting exchange with our UWH friends in China.\n\n***Please note that you may need a visa to enter China, depending on where your passport is from. Make sure to double check your entry requirements prior to the weekend! üôÇ\n\nWith the holiday season coming around, you KNOW you should be in the water playing hockey and burning off those calories. Come on, we live in Hong Kong: we‚Äôre not just feasting on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nope, our inner glutton is going to continue through February for Chinese New Year. So come and join us for December hockey practices!\n\nWe‚Äôre trying out a new pool at the Lycee Francais International (34 Price Road, Jardine‚Äôs Lookout; don‚Äôt know how to do the accent aigu and the little comma under the ‚Äúc‚Äù so just pretend it‚Äôs in French) for this month and had our first practice there today. We get to have the entire indoor, heated pool for ourselves ‚Äì huge thanks to Isabel for the hookup!\n\nWe‚Äôll be practicing on two more Tuesdays this month at the above location:\n\nDecember 15th, 7:30-9:00PM\n\nDecember 22nd, 7:30-9:00PM\n\nSo make sure to come out and join us for hockey practice before the holidays! As always, we have gear for you to rent if necessary.\n\nPS The T-shirt/Logo Contest is still going, so make sure to send your submissions to hkuwha@gmail.com if you‚Äôre planning to create a design!\n\nAnnouncing HKUWHA‚Äôs first ever T-shirt and Logo Contest!\n\nAs the HK Underwater Hockey Association continues to develop as a young UWH team, we have reached the point where there‚Äôs an important piece missing:\n\nOur logo! (And t-shirts featuring our logo).\n\nWe‚Äôd like to invite all of our members and friends to participate in a logo/t-shirt design contest, with the winner receiving a free t-shirt, free admission to one practice, and the glory of having their work featured on all HKUWHA-related communications and merchandise!\n\nSo, here are the rules:\n\n1. You may choose to design a logo, a t-shirt, or (preferably) both;\n\n2. Important criteria to consider are relevance to UWH, relevance to HK, and originality;\n\n3. Our official club name is ‚ÄúHong Kong Underwater Hockey Association‚Äù (‚ÄúHKUWHA‚Äù) ‚ÄúÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊ∞¥Â∫ïÊõ≤Ê£çÁêÉÂçîÊúÉ‚Äù and our unofficial motto is ‚ÄúHKUWHA-Matata‚Äù;\n\n4. As the club is based in Hong Kong, please also incorporate HKUWH in Chinese (‚ÄúÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊ∞¥Â∫ïÊõ≤Ê£çÁêÉ‚Äù or ‚ÄúÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊ∞¥Êõ≤‚Äù) into your design ‚Äì we can help with this part later on if you don‚Äôt speak Chinese;\n\n5. Please include a short explanation of your design;\n\n6. Final design will be chosen based on the highest number of votes in our official ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù poll once submissions are complete.\n\nPlease email your submissions to hkuwha@gmail.com by December 15th, 2015. And feel free to let us know if you have any questions!\n\n*Note: The board will have the right to veto any inappropriate or irrelevant designs, but we‚Äôre hoping that won‚Äôt happen!"
