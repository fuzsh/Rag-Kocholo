        "text": "In the 1980’s and 90’s, Sue represented Great Britain in the sport of underwater Hockey. She won a World Championship bronze medal as Vice-Captain of the GB Women’s Masters Team at the 1998 San Jose World Championships.\n\nAt that time the team sheet described her as: “Chief mischief-maker, skinny-dipper extraordinaire, and party-maker. . .”. Strange that, because in the team photograph, she looked the picture of innocence.\n\nButter wouldn’t melt\n\nIn 1996, Sue played in an international competition in Florida and as a result spent some time on team visits throughout the Keys. She says that she can’t recall too much about her trip to the Keys in ‘96, but she did remember being banned from the ‘Hogs Breathe Saloon’ in Key West for dancing on the tables. Of course, all that is well behind her now, we were looking forward to a far more sedate trip to the Keys this time.\n\nBy co-incidence, we found ourselves in Key Largo on the night that the local underwater Hockey club held their training session. When Sue phoned the club up to see if it would be OK to join in, she was surprised to be talking to Patrick, who she had played against in Florida in 1996.\n\nWe got to the pool in time for Sue to be lent the necessary equipment; goggles, snorkel, fins, protective helmet and gloves and the all-important eight inch hockey stick.\n\nReady to rock\n\nThe game is played with a plastic coated puck, about the size of a tin of tuna, which is placed in the centre of the pool ready for ‘puck off’. Both teams line up at opposite ends, someone shouts three, two, one… GO and all hell breaks loose as both teams charge to the middle of the pool to fight over possession of the puck.\n\nOnce a team has possession, they pass the puck by flicking it with the short, underwater hockey stick. The sticks are coloured coded; white for one team, black for the other. This helps players identify friend or foe in the underwater melee.\n\nCompeting for the puck\n\nIt’s an interesting sport to watch from poolside. It’s very quiet; all the players spend their time with their heads under the water, snorkels in. every now and then there is a flurry of violent activity which breaks through the surface of the water. The game, like normal Hockey, constantly changes direction as the team in possession of the puck charge for the opponent’s end of the pool.\n\nSue, keeping her eye on the ball\n\nThe game ebbs and flows up and down the pool as one team after the other gets the advantage. Eventually, a team will score by getting the puck into their opponents ‘goal’ – a submerged, purpose made metal gully.\n\nThe team that has just scored, swim casually back to their end, dropping the puck back in the centre of the pool on the way. The team that has just conceded the goal talk tactics and getting ready to go again.\n\nTalking tactics\n\nAfter a short recovery period the call to start play comes and it all starts again. After an hour or so of this knackering play, everyone gets out of the pool, gets changed and goes down the pub.\n\nWhile we were at the Pub, one of the Key Largo players kindly invited us to park on his drive, so we did and planned our trip down to Key West at the furthest end of the Keys. The Keys are a series of narrow, white sandy islands, stretching 100 miles south west from the tip of Florida. They are never any more than 2metres above sea level and so are often at risk from flooding.\n\nAt one time the Keys were long accessible only by water but in 1910 a Railway was built all the way down to Key West using a series of over-sea railroad trestles and bridges. The railway line was destroyed in 1935 by a Hurricane and some of the bridges were converted to a carry a road.\n\nSat nav showing route to Key West from Key Largo\n\nThe view from the Camper didn’t look that much different from the Sat. Nav. For much of the time there are views of the sea on both sides of the road, the longest of the many bridges is 7miles long.\n\nThe bridge over the Keys\n\nWe took our time travelling down the Keys. We stopped at two great open mic nights about halfway down, one at a dock-side bar and the other at a place known locally as the DAB (dead Animals Bar) because it is full of stuffed wildlife. The dockside bar had a great resident blues band who let me ‘sit in’ on the vocals- which I really enjoyed.\n\nEnjoying playing at the Open Mic nights in the Keys\n\nIt is very relaxing driving down the Keys, because they are so narrow there is really not too much to do but drive and enjoy the sun, the big sky and the huge lobsters.\n\nTwo legs are better than eight.\n\nEventually we got to Key West and were greeted by an unexpected sight: Since the Cuban revolution, people have tried to escape the communist system and get to the USA, many have successfully made the 90 mile trip from Cuba to Key West in home-made rafts or small boats which are reinforced in order to make the journey. Once in the Keys these makeshift boats are abandoned and left to rot.\n\nInspecting an improvised raft that had made it safely across from Cuba\n\nKey West is a bit of a crazy place; in the old days this remote key was the haunt of pirates and those who made their living from the proceeds of the many ships that were wrecked in the shallow waters surrounding the land. Nowadays Key West still feels pretty remote from the rest of the states and is a magnet for people who want their good times a little wild.\n\nKey West can get a bit weird.\n\nOn the rooftop above the Bull Bar is the moderately famous ’Garden of Eden’. In this bar clothes are optional but photography is banned. We enjoyed a jolly nice drink in the Garden of evening and would like to report that most people were in fact, taking up the option of having clothes on. However because of the ban on photography, I’m afraid you’ll just have to take my word for that.\n\nThe Bull bar in Key West with the roof top Garden of Eden. Brrrr\n\nAt sunset everyone heads for the most westerly point in the Keys. It’s the only place in the world I’ve ever seen such a phenomena. In an awful lot of places the setting sun goes unnoticed, even by those enjoying sundowners. But for some reason a tradition has grown in Key West that all us tourists traipse down to the seafront promenade to watch the sun set and the street artists entertain.\n\nHundreds gathering to watch the setting sun\n\nFor those who want to get away from the crowds on the promenade, there are a number of sail boats that run sunset trips.\n\nSunset sail boats – for those who want a closer look\n\nAfter sunset, there was nothing left for it but to join the party. I was a bit worried about Sue, it is a serious party town and she’s got previous in Key West. I won’t say we embarked on a pub crawl, but after quite a few drinks in quite a few different places we came across the Hog’s Breath Saloon – the place that she’d been banned from all those years ago. Sue was delighted, I was nervous.\n\nAfter a modest start we came across the Hogs Breath Saloon\n\nThe music was pumping, the beer was flowing and the dance floor full. It was obvious that this establishment had not suffered from its strictly applied ‘dancing on the floor only’ policy.\n\nDancing at the Hogs Breath Saloon and staying on the floor\n\nShe did very well, when it was time to go we just paid our check and left – just like normal people. Ah how times have changed, no more dancing on the tables, no more being too wild for even a party bar. The age of responsible behaviour has arrived. And how better to celebrate this new found, more responsible life than to find a bar, get a beer, spark up a Cuban cigar and reflect on the good times.\n\nFlorida Keys – it’s been one hell of a week."
