        "text": "3. Octopush is underwater hockey. It was invented in 1954 by a British scuba diver to keep his fellow divers fit over the winter months. As a result, the season runs from September to April. Now the game has spread into much of the English speaking world, and also to France. Underwater hockey is fast, furious, and fun.\n\n4. »Team size was originally eight players, hence the name Octopush. »Today, there are ten players on a team, six in the water at one time and the others substituting continuously during play. »Octopush is a non-contact sport. »The game is thirty minutes, two fifteen minute halves. »The object of the game is to get the puck into your opponent's goal. »At the start of each game the puck is placed in the middle of the pool and the teams start on opposite walls. On the referee's signal the game begins. »When the game begins the teams will swim to the puck, the forwards attempting to gain possession for their team. The team then work together to try and score a goal while defending their own goal.\n\n5. Anyone who can swim! Since all players wear fins to help them swim, athletic abilities are generally equalized in the pool. Men don’t really have an advantage over women.\n\n6. Players wear the basic equipment of a mask, snorkel, fins, and water polo hat. They hold a small stick, about the size of a spatula, in a gloved hand. The idea of the game is to use the stick to push the three–pound puck into the opposing team's goal, which consists of a two meter (about 6.5 feet) tray at the opposing end of a 25 meter pool.\n\n7. • A player is said to be 'in possession' while the player's stick is in contact with the puck. • Any part of the stick's playing area may be used to play the puck. However, the puck must not be lifted up or carried on the stick; if it is lifted accidentally onto a stick, it must be dropped off right away. • The puck may be pushed or passed in any direction along the pool bottom anywhere within the playing area by the player in possession. • Players must not handle the puck with either hand. Should the puck accidentally touch the back of the playing hand, this will not be considered handling the puck unless used deliberately to advance the puck (Gloving). • A player may use either hand to hold the stick, and can change hands. • While in possession, only one hand may be on the stick, the other hand must not be used to support the wrist or arm.\n\n8. Players may be penalized for the following rule infringements: 1. Breaking at the start of play or the restart of play after an infringement. 2. Holding the puck in the corner as the third consecutive player from one team. 3. Having more than 6 players in the water. 5. Handling the puck with the free or playing hand; this includes guiding the puck with an outstretched finger. 6. Obstructing an opponent in any way while not in possession of the puck. 9. Covering or obstructing the puck with any part of the body or equipment, while not in possession, to prevent access to the puck by other players. 12. Using hands, arms or body in any way to grasp, pull or push an opponent or their stick. 14. Removing or attempting to remove an opponent's equipment.\n\n9. 1. Speed 2. Breath-hold 3. Recovery rate\n\n10. • Rotate which muscle groups you are working on each day. • It is also important to cross-train—doing the same exercise repeatedly results in overuse injuries and boredom. • It is not a good idea to smoke while in an exercise program. • When embarking on any strenuous exercise program, if you have not participated in one before, get a physical so you have medical clearance to do so. • Exercise at generally the same time every day, and set goals for yourself and your team.\n\n12. 1. 5 minute jog 2. Stretch 3. Swimming without fins • 5 lengths surface swimming (one length=25 meters) • 6 lengths half underwater, half on top. 4. Stretch again 5. 5 minutes swimming with fins • 5 lengths arms and legs on the surface. • 5 lengths legs only on the surface. This may be done with a vertical flutter board for strength training. • 5 lengths half under, half on top.\n\n13. INTERVAL TRAINING •10 lengths freestyle on the surface •2 lengths slow on the surface •10 lengths underwater •2 lengths slow underwater UNDERWATER TRAINING •10 lengths underwater with a puck, flicking it forward •10 repetitions swimming with the puck four lanes out from the wall; turn and swim back to the second lane; turn and swim back to the fourth lane; turn and swim back to the wall - flick to the wall. Alternate the side to which you turn. •5 lengths slow underwater\n\n14. • Breath hold training is much safer out of the pool than in it. Hyperventilation will result in a longer time but is dangerous when used in the pool and should not be practiced. • Try holding your breath while climbing the stairs - you can increase the number of flights you do as you get better. • As we work out, try holding your breath through some repetitions (depends on the exercise - not a good idea if you are expanding/compressing your ribcage). • Hold your breath before going to sleep (or when you wake up) - this can be an ideal situation to time yourself.\n\n15. STRETCHING A stretch should never be painful and posture is very important. It is also important to warm up before you stretch. Stretches should be undertaken for 10 - 15 minutes before playing. Each stretch should be held for 5 seconds and repeated 3 times. Do not bounce as your muscles will seize up but gradually push further each time.\n\n16.

These strength exercises focus on these movements.\n\n19. Standing Stationary Lunges • Works: Whole leg (quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings). • Position feet wide apart, a light weight in each hand held at your waist. Lower the torso until both knees are at right angles, keeping your torso vertical, but do not let back knee touch the floor, and keep front knee behind shoelaces. Press through the heel of the front foot to engage the glutes. Exhale as you press away from the floor. • Felt: in the hip and quadriceps of the leg that is back behind you.\n\n20. Bridges • Works: Legs, lower back (hamstrings, glutes, erector spinaes) • Lie flat on your back with feet flat on the floor directly under your knees, and raise your hips as you exhale. The goal is to form a straight line from your knees down to shoulders. Exhale as you lift, inhale and lower butt to the floor but don’t let it touch. Perform under control and really squeeze the hips at the top.\n\n21. Iron Cross Superman • Works: Lower back (erector spinaes, hamstrings) • Lie flat on your stomach, with arms out to your sides as though your torso forms a cross. With thumbs up to ceiling, exhale as you raise your torso and legs up several inches off the floor, squeezing your shoulder blades together and squeezing glutes. Control as you lower slowly to the floor. Keep a neutral neck (stay looking down at the floor) and exhale as you raise off the floor."
