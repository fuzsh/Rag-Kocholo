        "text": "04 March 2024 - Congratulations to Tracey, Adam, Joel, and Matthew for winning the 2024 Wollongong 4's, in its 30th year. Also congratulations to Estiven for being awarded the Most Valuable Player for the competition. Thanks to the Wollongong Club for organising another great competition.\n\nThe Wollongong 4's is one of Australia's largest and longest running social Underwater Hockey competitions. Starting in 1992, the competition regularly attracts more than 50 competitors from all over Australia and beyond.\n\nTo qualify you need to turn up on time, put your name in the hat, and be drawn onto a team with three other players. Then it's game on for several hours of four on four hockey.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's off to a secret location for Beers, BBQ, and Raffle.\n\nWatch this page for details on the 2025 Wollongong 4's."
