        "text": "Certified Professional Midwife\n\nMidwifeKim@AuthenticBirthCenter.com\n\n_\n\n​\n\nAs far back as I can remember I have felt deeply called to birth work. I vividly recall the first birth I had the honor to witness as it (quite literally) brought me to my knees in awe. It was that moment I was certain birth work was my life calling. I was completely and utterly enamored by the strength, power, and energy that comes with birth. I personally believe that birth holds the potential to be a sacred, spiritual, and transformative event in a woman’s life, as well as for her partner and family.\n\nI began my birth work journey in 2000 while working as a certified birth and postpartum doula. In 2002, I took a deep dive into midwifery and completed a direct entry apprenticeship that taught me what I refer to as the “art of midwifery.” I am forever grateful for that experience!\n\nIn 2005, I completed an internship at a high-volume birth center in El Paso, Texas and then dual enrolled at the National College of Midwifery and the Midwest Maternal Child Institute. I successfully earned an Associates of Science in Midwifery and my Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) credential in October of 2009. That same year, I had the incredible opportunity to complete a midwifery residency program in Malawi.\n\nI have a strong passion for health, wellness, and continual learning in the field of birth. I am currently enrolled in a Women’s Functional and Integrative Medicine Program. My goal is to blend functional and integrative medicine into my midwifery practice and create a deeper level of care for the families I serve. I am a proud mother of 4 children and wife to an incredibly strong anchor of a man. In my spare time I enjoy travel, interior design, anything outdoors, herbalism, and gardening.\n\nCertified Professional Midwife\n\nCAPPA Faculty CLD, CPM, CPD, CLE, SbaP, SbPE,\n\nEvidence Based Birth Instructor, HCHI\n\nMidwifeHeather@AuthenticBirthCenter.com\n\n_\n\n​\n\nHello! As a passionate, experienced, and innovative birth provider for over 25 years, I began this work when I was 19. Initially going into Pre-Med to become an OB-GYN, I was redirected to Midwifery and thus became a Certified Professional Midwife. I practiced in Portland, Oregon at the wonderful Adaluz Waterbirth center.\n\nAfter moving back to the Midwest, I settled in Chicago. As co-owner of 312Doulas, we support 16-20 clients a month in Chicagoland while teaching classes a wide variety of in-services for families, doulas, and educators.\n\nAuthentic Birth Center offers the perfect space to support amazing families through their childbearing years. As a member of your birth team, I’m absolutely honored to be a part of your transformative journey as a family.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCertified Professional Midwife, Student Midwife Liaison\n\nmidwifehannah@authenticbirthcenter.com\n\n​\n\n_\n\n​\n\nMy journey into midwifery began several years ago after the birth of one of my siblings. A woman who brought us a meal suggested the idea, and I began researching routes of entry. Pursuing the Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) credential through the North American Registry of Midwives, I was accepted as a student at Authentic Birth Center in 2022.\n\nI was blessed to attend over 100 births before receiving my CPM and Licensed Midwife credentials in April 2024. I am thankful for the opportunity to continue to work with the families giving birth here. It is a great honor to be invited into these spaces, where life is celebrated, and mothers work so hard to bring their little ones into their arms.\n\nI believe that mothers' bodies are created to bring forth their babies in a powerful, beautiful way. While no birth is guaranteed a perfect ending, most low-risk, natural births follow this pattern. Even if the birth doesn't go “as planned”, I believe the woman should be allowed to give true informed consent to ensure she is the primary decision-maker for her care. This is important for every woman, no matter the setting in which she gives birth.\n\nFrom the moment a baby is conceived in the womb, to the first breath after birth, the entire pregnancy journey is one of change, concern, excitement, anticipation, and\n\njoy. My job is to encourage, assist, and support you in this journey. Truly, mothers and babies are “fearfully and wonderfully made!”\n\nCertified Professional Midwife MidwifeBecky@AuthenticBirthCenter.com\n\n_\n\n​\n\nI jumped into the birthing world in high school when I supported a friend during her birth. Since then, I have been drawn to the energy of holding space for women as they bring their babies earthside.\n\nI regard a woman’s pregnancy and birth as a sacred space, designed to be guarded and nurtured as she follows her own body’s path for growing and bringing her baby into the world. The innate wisdom for navigating this unfolding time is the cornerstone of the midwifery model of care. While the physiological birth process works beautifully most of the time, there are a handful of scenarios that may benefit from a helping hand. As I come alongside you in your pregnancy and birth journey, my role is to be your helping hand when you feel you need one.\n\nMy pathway to becoming a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) has included an eclectic and exciting mix of experiences: a homebirth apprenticeship, birthing center internship, Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM) and CPM birth assistant, doula, CNA, and private homebirth practice. I received my associate degree in midwifery from Southwest Technical College, and after being licensed in two additional states, I am now helping to expand the licensing of CPMs in Illinois.\n\nI currently serve as the President of the Illinois Council of Certified Professional Midwives, a chapter of the National Association of CPMs, and Vice President of the Midwives Alliance of North America.\n\nI am first a mom to five grown-up children, as well as the ongoing project manager of one grandchild. Additionally, I enjoy knitting and am currently working on a complex genealogy tree.\n\nCertified Professional Midwife\n\nMidwifeSeong@AuthenticBirthCenter.com\n\n_\n\n​\n\nI grew up trusting birth and seeing it as a non-medical and very natural event. The oldest of five, I come from a home birthing family and had the opportunity to experience my youngest three siblings’ births. I have given birth in the hospital twice, at home on land once and at home in the water twice. All were unmedicated and uncomplicated.\n\nShortly after the birth of my fourth child, I unexpectedly found myself on the path to becoming a doula. I completed doula training with DONA in 2014 and was shocked to realize how many people were experiencing traumatic births. I left that weekend with a fire in my heart to educate others about birth choices and promote the expectation of family centered birth.\n\nI intuitively felt at home supporting birthing people and families. In 2018 I started on my journey to become a Certified Professional Midwife. I apprenticed with both private practice CPMs and a large home birth CNM practice for four years, attending around 400 births. I completed my apprenticeship, sat for my NARM exam, and earned my CPM credential in May of 2022.\n\nI practice trauma-informed and consent driven care. I am passionate about home and community birth and helping to spread the word that it is a safe option for a low-risk pregnancy. I am passionate about recognizing the sacredness of pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum experience. My goal is to make sure all feel safe, supported, and respected during this special time.\n\nCertified Nurse Midwife​\n\nmidwifesarah@authenticbirthcenter.com\n\n​\n\n_\n\n​\n\nI fell in love with birth at a very young age after witnessing three of my younger sibling’s births. Helping to deliver my own sister while in high school spurred my desire to be a part of the beautiful miracle of birth.\n\nMy journey towards midwifery started in Charlotte, North Carolina where I completed my bachelor’s in nursing. My college summers were spent in South Africa conducting breastfeeding research as well as two months in Takoradi, Ghana working on a labor and delivery floor. Following graduation, I began my midwifery studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago where I earned my Doctorate in Nursing Practice. Throughout graduate school, I spent three years working in home birth and found my place in the out of hospital world. During that season of life, I also married my wonderful husband as well as welcomed our son into the world in the peace of our own home.\n\nMy love of holistic and physiologic birth has only grown over the years and made working at the birth center an easy choice. I enjoy being a part of each and every prenatal checkup, postpartum visit, and birth story that I have the honor of attending."
