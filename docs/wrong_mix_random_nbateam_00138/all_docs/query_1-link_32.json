The unique trapezoidal silhouette made Pennzoil Place the first skyscraper of the Post-Modern Era. The 1.4 million square foot, Class A trophy high-rise is positioned above Houston’s underground tunnel system where tenants have immediate access to a host of amenities and restaurants.\n\nThe tower also features executive-level conveniences including a brand new state of the art health club.\n\nPennzoil Place is proud to be the first office building in Houston to utilize a fiber optic backbone for IT communication utilizing Cisco’s \"Smart+Connected\" buildings framework which enhances Data/Communications, Physical Security and building automation capabilities. This allows for better tenant comfort, quicker response times and ability to achieve the highest energy efficiency possible.\n\nPennzoil Place is within walking distance of Houston’s museum district and is surrounded by world-class amenities. The property is also conveniently located near the freeway, as well as multiple transportation options."
