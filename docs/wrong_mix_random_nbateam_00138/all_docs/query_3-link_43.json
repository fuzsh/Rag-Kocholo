Head to my #YT page or click the link in my bio/LinkTree to view in full 🥁. Always wanted to do a Gojira cover, but never really had the stems / files for it. But these guitars were recorded by @kevinheiderich (THANKS DOODE!!! 🤍🎸👌🏼). So please show Kevin some love, & give him a follow. Not only is he a rad dude & RIPPIN’ guitarist, but I honestly wouldn’t have done this cover if he hadn’t been down to track for it! \n\n& speaking of - the bass was actually recorded by @declol (who also mixed it!). So big thanks to you too, Declan 🎙️🎶🤙🏼🤍! Make sure to show Declan some love, TOO! \n\n& the vocals are actually some AI vox that I made with one of those ‘stem separator’ softwares (Moises, specifically). To be perfectly honest, while those AI album stem separators (or more like… “re-creater’s”… b/c I thiiiiink that’s what they’re actually doing… altho, not entirely sure) are great tools, they’re defffffinitely not there yet for general instruments (like, distorted guitars & drums especially). There’re soooo many weird sounds & artifacts. A great tool for learning music or having something to play along to, but definitely not ideal for a real mix. Well, except for vocals, that is! It seems like the technology for vocals is a lot better (which, frankly, makes sense). So the vocals are a fabricated AI stem, & everything else is real people… kind of a true human-AI-hybrid cover ! 🤣🤙🏼🤣\n\nTo be clear, I’m not trying to rip on AI softwares that do audio separation in individual stems. & frankly, in NO time, I’m sure they’ll improve even more & be indiscernible. But I’ve gotta say: I’m real glad I have some hella-sick friends to record *ACTUAL* instruments for this kinda thing. So thanks dudes 🤍🙏🏼🫶🏼!\n\nOH &, this is my first new upload with my lovely @seelectronics microphones 😍🤤! LOVE EM’!!! 🎤\n\nHope ya’ll have a great Friday! \n\n#Drums #DrumsAreSick #Gojira #Backbone #Sick #AF #Tama #TamaDrums #Meinl #Evans #ACDUnlimited #GatorCases #sE #sEMicrophones #Vratim #OnTrigger #Audient #HeavyMetal #Explore #ExplorePage #AI #BlastBeat #Groovy #Too #Tho #Lol #Amirite\".",
