        "text": "Editor's Note:\n\nAt just one-year old, Yao Qinlei will never get to see her famous father play on court. The little girl will have to watch videos later in life to see the magical skills that made her father a global celebrity.\n\nYao Ming, China's most successful sport export and influential athlete nationwide, has finally kissed goodbye to the court and fans. The CBA champion, life of the national team, NBA multi all-star player, bridge of China-US cross-culture, charity devotee and commercial darling will even stand tall off court, as he did on court, as a heritage of Chinese basketball and sport.\n\nThe end of a spectacular era also marks the final chapter of a sporting icon. But let's pray for the beginning of another as we bid farewell.\n\nClick to leave wishes for Yao\n\nCiao,Yao!\n\nEnd of The Ming Dynastry\n\nIt's final. In a news conference held in Shanghai and broadcast live in China on Wednesday, Yao Ming announced his retirement from basketball, staging an emotional end to a glorious career. >>>\n\nThank you, Yao\n\nFor Chinese all over the world, it was a proud moment when Yao Ming carried the national flag at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.>>>\n\nShanghai: Home city anticipates return of the big guy\n\nYao Ming has retired, but his popularity won't wane, at least in his hometown.>>>\n\nHouston: Love for star will never die\n\nThough regretting Yao Ming's decision to retire, Chinese fans across America are adamant they will continue their support for the all-star center and support his charity foundation and Yao Restaurant in Houston. >>>\n\nYao Influence\n\nMing dynasty ends\n\nWhen Yao Ming announced his retirement at a press conference in his hometown of Shanghai, it closed the door on an all-star and possibly Hall of Fame career, but also dimmed the lights somewhat on the game in China.>>>\n\nAlways fluent in basketball\n\nYao's first-year coach Jeff Van Gundy had no difficulty communicating with his towering star. \"He worked hard at his English but he spoke perfect basketball. He didn't need any help on the court. He had a superior basketball IQ.\" >>>\n\nEditorials:\n\nHow do you gauge impact of a giant? Larry Bird and Magic Johnson revived a moribund league in the '80s, Michael Jordan made it soar to new heights in the '90s, but it was the tall (OK, extremely tall) center from Shanghai, Yao Ming, who led the NBA into the massive Chinese, and by extension Asian, market.>>>\n\nQuotes:\n\nWang Zhizhi, Yao's national teammate: \"Yao has been troubled by injuries for several years, and he was forced to make the decision. It's unfortunate and a great loss for Chinese basketball. His retirement will have a big effect on China's play in the Asian Championships this year and next year's London Olympics.\">>>"
