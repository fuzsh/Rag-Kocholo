        "text": "Dave Jordan is the Founder and CEO of Format Entertainment. Dave began his career working for record labels but soon transitioned to become one of Hollywood’s most sought-after theatrical music supervisors. His supervision credits include some of the most successful film franchises in the world, including Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, Avengers, Black Panther, and Transformers. Dave’s success has ranked him as the top-grossing music supervisor in film history.\n\nIn 2001, Dave’s entrepreneurial acumen led him to found Format, which has grown into the largest collection of theatrical and television music supervisors in the world. Dave has spearheaded Format’s growth over 20+ years, expanding beyond its supervision core to include a robust and diverse infrastructure of creative and executive resources, allowing the company to thrive as a full-service, solutions-oriented creative agency.\n\nFormat’s music supervision efforts have yielded numerous chart-topping albums including number one spots for the Guardians of the Galaxy, A Star is Born, Black Panther, and Pitch Perfect soundtracks. Recently, Format albums occupied an unprecedented four of the top five positions on the Billboard charts. Format has won multiple Grammys, American Music Awards, and Guild of Supervisor Awards, and received several Oscar and Emmy nominations.\n\nFormat’s clients are some of the most recognizable names in entertainment, media, advertising and consumer brands, including names such as Marvel Studios, Warner Consumer Products, and Spin Master. Format helps companies design clear and compelling sonic footprints across projects, platforms and media to tell bold stories, strengthen identity, and develop consumer relevance and recognition.\n\nFormat has been Marvel Studios’ exclusive music department since 2000, having worked on all 32 films and all 9 Disney+ shows, playing an integral role in universe building since inception. In addition, Format has worked on campaigns for brands such as Mattel’s iconic Barbie and Spin Master’s global sensation Paw Patrol, as well as Netflix, ESPN, Amazon, T-Mobile and many others.\n\nRecognizing an industry void and seeing an opportunity he could deliver against, Dave incorporated The Math Club, an original music creation company under the Format umbrella. By signing new and exciting talent and constantly reevaluating the media and music landscape, The Math Club provides a seamless and efficient experience for the film, television and brand communities. The Math Club’s music serves as the backbone of some of television’s biggest hits and has earned thousands of major placements on shows and films such as Cocaine Bear, White Lotus, Hacks, Ozark, WandaVision, Atlanta, Crazy Rich Asians, Empire, Power, Grown-ish, Loot, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, This Is Us, and The Boys.\n\nDave serves on the Los Angeles Board of Governors for the Grammy Committee, contributing to advocacy, education, and human service programs to improve the cultural condition and quality of life for music and its makers. Most recently he received a NAACP Image Award for his work on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
