        "text": "The Columbus venue was the only theater in Ohio selected as one of about 50 venues that will host its own programming as part of the Sundance Film Festival's 2021 slate.\n\nColumbus cinephiles need not travel next year all the way to Park City, Utah, for the nation's largest independent film festival.\n\nFrom Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, a selection of films on the slate for the 2021 Sundance Film Festival will be screened at the Gateway Film Center. The University District venue is one of about 50 movie theaters, drive-ins and museums across the United States that the Sundance Institute chose as partner \"satellite screens\" while the coronavirus pandemic makes large gatherings unfeasible.\n\n“We’re very excited,” Gateway President Chris Hamel said. “Sundance is really all about the artists and all about the filmmakers, and I think they looked for organizations that share those values.”\n\nThe \"satellite screens\" program marks a first for the 42-year-old festival, which also will be available through an online portal where its slate of more than 70 films and other programming will stream during its seven-day run. In addition to screening a selection of Sundance films, each satellite venue will host artist talks and other cultural events related to the festival, according to the institute.\n\nAt a time when many of these partner cultural institutions have been closed or financially hampered as COVID-19 rages on, Sundance's initiative serves to keep such venues viable, according to organizers.\n\n“These partners are the backbone of independent artistic communities across the country, where filmmakers are born and cinephiles are developed,” said festival director Tabitha Jackson in a written statement. “We’re entering these partnerships because a healthy ecosystem for artists and audiences requires that independent cinemas across the country survive and thrive.”\n\nSundance organizers did not respond to the Dispatch's request for comment.\n\nAfter closing at the outset of the pandemic in March, the Gateway briefly reopened at the end of August before again making the decision to suspend operations in mid-November.\n\n>>Related content: Gateway Film Center suspends in-person showings due to rise in COVID-19\n\nHamel said the venue will reopen for the festival, following all statewide COVID-19 safety guidelines. That includes mandated masks for employees and patrons, increased sanitation efforts and social distancing.\n\n“We’re hoping that the situation improves after the first of the year,” Hamel said.\n\nTickets will go on sale in early January and will be available through both the Gateway and Sundance websites.\n\nGateway will host between two and four film screenings each day. Once the theater is able to announce which films it will show, Hamel anticipates scheduling additional programming related to those works, such as question-and-answer sessions with the filmmakers.\n\n“We're very excited,\" Hamel said, \"about the features we think we’re going to be screening.”\n\nelagatta@dispatch.com\n\n@EricLagatta"
