        "text": "LAS VEGAS — They met in sixth grade, quickly became best friends and went on to form the backbone of one of the best high school basketball teams in Portland history.\n\nSo it seems only fitting that\n\nand\n\nwill begin their NBA careers at the same time, under similar circumstances, with equal fanfare.\n\n“We’ve played with each other since the sixth grade and made it all the way to the NBA,” Ross said. “Not a lot of friends can say that. It’s been fun. We definitely have a lot of memories together.”\n\nOn June 28, the one-time\n\nstars made history, becoming the first players from Portland to be selected in the first round of the same NBA draft. Ross, in a shocker, was selected No. 8 overall by the Toronto Raptors; Jones went 10 spots later to the Houston Rockets.\n\nAnd even though the two will play in opposite conferences in cities that couldn’t be more different, both will continue to share one common thread: They have become key components of teams in the middle of rebuilding.\n\nRoss was one of the NBA draft’s biggest surprises, a late riser from the University of Washington who shot up the draft boards during the predraft process. Heading into the draft, the Raptors — who finished a dismal 23-43 last season — were hoping North Carolina’s Harrison Barnes, Syracuse’s Dion Waiters or Damian Lillard, who went to the\n\n, would slip to them at eight.\n\nBut when they were finally on the clock, all three players were gone. So they went with the next best available player on their draft board in Ross, a smooth-shooting, potential-laden 6-foot-7 shooting guard. It was higher than Ross was projected to go, but it was curious for another reason: Toronto already features a burgeoning 6-7 shooting guard in DeMar DeRozan, whom they drafted No. 9 overall in the 2009 draft.\n\nThe selection was greeted with raised eyebrows in Toronto — a fact not lost on Ross.\n\n“Of course it’s motivation,” Ross said. “But they picked me because they thought I’d be the best fit for this system. I’m happy I’m here. Now I just have to put forth the work and prove that I should be here.”\n\nAlthough Ross’ selection might have caught many by surprise, the Raptors had been scrutinizing him for months. During last fall’s NBA lockout, Toronto coach Dwane Casey stopped by a University of Washington practice to do some scouting and instantly became intrigued by Ross’ demeanor, character and scoring ability.\n\n“I saw him work out and I immediately emailed our people back in Toronto and said he was a guy we want to keep our eye on,” Casey said. “He’s a natural scorer, he’s a kid who can come off of screens and shoot the basketball and I’m really, really impressed with him from that standpoint. We need scoring and his ability to score is something that we really liked.”\n\nAnd even though the Raptors drafted a player who seemingly will threaten his future with the team, DeRozan has not revealed a hint of jealousy or animosity toward Ross. DeRozan watched the Raptors' first three NBA Summer League games from the stands, placing a keen eye on Ross, and the two already have formed a mentor-apprentice relationship.\n\nDeRozan has offered tips and advice to Ross before and after each of his summer league outings and has invited him visit Los Angeles in August to work out and train together for the regular season. The way Casey sees it, it’s a perfect scenario — DeRozan will make Ross a better player more quickly and, with Ross nipping at DeRozan’s heels, DeRozan should expand his improving game.\n\n“Plus, there’s nothing to say those two can’t be on the court at the same time,” Casey said. “But DeMar has been great. He’s taking (Ross) under his wing and that’s going to help us. We’re a young team, so we’re going to need all the firepower we can get.”\n\nIn just three games, Ross already has experienced the highs and lows of NBA life. In his debut — against best friend Jones and the Rockets — he was productive, finishing with 21 points on 8-of-19 shooting. But in two games since, Ross has scored a combined 25 points and made 9 of 26 field goals, including 1 of 8 from three-point range. As defenses have keyed on him, his shot has faltered.\n\nThrough the ups and downs, he’s leaned on an old friend.\n\n“I called him last night,” Ross said Sunday, referring to Jones. “And we talked the day before that. We talk all the time ... about basketball, friends, life. Everything.”\n\nJones, on the other hand, has had very little to complain about this week during their chats. Through three games, he’s averaging 16.7 points and 7.3 rebounds and is shooting 53 percent from the field. Jones has proven to be a versatile performer who can play a little point forward, step out and make a three-pointer (he’s 2 for 4) and bang with wide bodies in the key.\n\nThe Rockets loves Jones’ across-the-board ability, vast skill-set and winning pedigree, and envision him competing for a rotation spot next season.\n\n“He’s a versatile (power forward),” Rockets summer league coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He can put the ball on the floor, he’s a better passer than I thought and had seen when he was in college. He can make plays off the bounce and he’s kind of sneaky athletic. From that (power forward) spot, he’s a glue guy. He does a little bit of everything.”\n\nThe Rockets have completely overhauled their roster and — absent a surprise trade for All-Star center Dwight Howard — could be in for a long 2012-13 season. Jones is one of three players the Rockets drafted in the first round, joining shooting guard Jeremy Lamb and small forward Royce White. All three figure to play next season.\n\n“We definitely like what we’ve seen,” Bickerstaff said of Jones. “Through training camp and through these first three games, he’s been very consistent. You look at our roster, we’ve got a lot of youth and there’s a lot of opportunity for guys like him.”\n\nJones' next test will come at 5 p.m. Tuesday, when the Blazers face the Rockets at Cox Pavilion. It will be a special matchup for Jones, who grew up in Northeast Portland, graduated from Jefferson High School and — along with good friend Ross — helped cement Portland’s status as a blossoming basketball breeding ground.\n\nThe Terrences have finally fulfilled their NBA dreams, but they won’t ever forget their roots.\n\n“That’s where I’m from, that’s where I went and I’ll always rep Jeff,” Jones said.\n\n--\n\n; follow him on"
