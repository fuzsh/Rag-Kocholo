        "text": "Guillermo Del Toro is a horror director out of joint with his times. Where the rest of his genre has retreated towards the Day-Glo self-parody of Scream, this Mexican-born thirtysomething has set himself up as a kind of Latino HP Lovecraft. His tales are a simmering cocktail of ripe melodramatics laced with a languid, narcotic line in chills.\n\nSet in civil war-era Spain, The Devil's Backbone spins a magic-realist ghost story full of angst, mystery and pungent nooks and crannies. Its haunted house is a labyrinthine gothic schoolhouse that doubles as a shelter for the orphaned sons of the republican militia.\n\nIts staff include a wise professor, a one-legged matriarch and a hunky handyman up to no good. Meanwhile the children find their nights disturbed by \"the one who sighs\", a whispering phantom presence who may just be the ghost of an orphan gone missing weeks before.\n\nDel Toro's Spanish landscape is a hard clash of sunshine and shadow (one shot of a black doorway framing a bright exterior looks like a direct lift from The Searchers). But in the end it is the shadows that dominate.\n\nLike all good ghost stories, The Devil's Backbone dims the lights for its creepy finale."
