        "text": "LAS VEGAS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- After losing the first two games, the Chinese men's basketball national team clinched an 84-80 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday in the NBA Summer League.\n\nDespite a 41-point defeat by the Miami Heat in their opener on Friday, China made progress in every game they played and earned their first victory in the third game, and also their first Summer League victory since 2007.\n\nChina got off to a sluggish start but were able to turn the table after center Zhou Qi, who played for the Houston Rockets, stepped on the court. He scored his first two points on the free throw line, then made two three-point shots, helping his team to a three-point lead at end of the first period.\n\nChina managed to keep their advantage in the following quarter, and survived the sprint by the Hornets in the closing minutes with a key offensive rebound grabbed by Zhou and two free throws by guard Zhao Jiwei.\n\nZhou scored a team-high 17 points and nine rebounds. Arnoldas Kulboka led the Hornets with 18 points.\n\nChina are in Las Vegas with their national team roster to get prepared for the FIBA World Cup to be held on home soil. They will play their last match in the Summer League against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday."
