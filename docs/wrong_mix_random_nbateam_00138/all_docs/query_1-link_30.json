        "text": "After a brutal start to the 2022-23 schedule with 10 road games in their first 13 overall, including a pair of road trips of at least four games in length, the young Houston Rockets (2-10) finally reach the end of the line with Saturday night’s visit to New Orleans (6-6).\n\nIf you’re looking to do some last-minute betting research for the Rockets-Pelicans game, you’re in luck! We’ll give you the latest point spread, money line odds and over/under number, as well as the information you’ll need to make the smartest bet at BetMGM.\n\nThe game starts at 7:30 p.m. Central and can be seen via AT&T SportsNet Southwest (in Houston markets) or on NBA League Pass.\n\nAfter Saturday, the Rockets play at home within the friendly confines of Toyota Center for five of their next six games. Ideally, they would like to arrive there without having the NBA’s worst record.\n\nTo accomplish that with an upset win on Saturday, the Rockets will likely need another strong outing by second-year shooting guard Jalen Green — who played a key role in Monday’s win at Orlando and has become much more efficient over the past 10 days.\n\nOn the other side, the Pelicans will be led by a rising star in fourth-year forward Zion Williamson, who has shaken off a lost season due to injury to lead New Orleans in scoring at 23.3 points per game on 54.8% shooting and 50.0% on 3-pointers.\n\nThe lines, courtesy of BetMGM\n\nPoint spread: Pelicans -10.5\n\nMoney line: Pelicans -500 / Rockets +375\n\nOver-under: 232.5\n\nClick here to place your bets at BetMGM.\n\nRockets at Pelicans injury report:\n\nRockets: Jae’Sean Tate out (right ankle soreness), Bruno Fernando out (left knee soreness)\n\nPelicans: Kira Lewis Jr. out, (right knee ACL injury recovery), E.J. Liddell out (right knee ACL injury recovery)\n\nAdvice and prediction\n\nThe Rockets have hit the over in their last three games overall, and they’e covered the spread in two of them. We’ll take that trend to continue for one more game as the road trip finally concludes.\n\nPrediction: Pelicans 122, Rockets 113\n\nGet more betting analysis and predictions at Sportsbook Wire.\n\nRelated\n\nTyTy Washington to begin career with Houston’s G League affiliate\n\nJalen Green returning to efficient form as Rockets grow more competitive\n\nList\n\nTakeaways: Rockets rookies Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason show flashes in Toronto"
