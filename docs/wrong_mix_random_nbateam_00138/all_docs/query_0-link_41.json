        "text": "By Virginie Boone\n\nMike and Steve Sangiacomo like to tell a story about how their dad, Angelo, didn’t have any hobbies. Instead, whenever he had free time away from the growing business that had become Sangiacomo Vineyards, he liked to drive around Sonoma County and see what was going on in local agriculture and sniff out opportunities.\n\nThis is how one day he ended up in Penngrove off Petaluma Hill Road to say hello to a man named Ed Grossi.\n\nGrossi had grown up on a dairy ranch in West Marin, a 4-H and FFA kid. After Cal Poly he worked on a hay ranch and started a fertilizer business in Rohnert Park. Along Petaluma Hill Road, Grossi was working his 20-acre organic vegetable and fruit farm when Angelo Sangiacomo stumbled along in 1999.\n\nThere wasn’t much of a history of grapegrowing in this low-slung area and Sangiacomo had his doubts about a piece of land for sale nearby. The soils looked to be all heavy clay and so he figured that the land not yet planted near Grossi might not be great for wine grapes.\n\nStill, he brought his sons out to do some digging. Getting to the site after a bout of rain, the Sangiacomos assumed they’d run into a sticky mess, but after digging 12 separate holes around the property, they didn’t run into clay once. Instead they got gravel and loam, not at all what they were expecting.\n\nSituated at the base of Sonoma Mountain’s western slopes in the northern part of what is now the Petaluma Gap appellation, Grossi told the Sangiacomos that Copeland Creek, which runs across Roberts Road’s northern border, used to run across the site, leaving behind cobblestone and alluvium soils.\n\nThese rocky well-drained soils at Roberts Road Vineyard turned out to grow great grapes that ripen slowly in the fog. Spanning across 130 acres, the vineyard enjoys two watersheds, one draining into the Russian River and the other into San Pablo Bay.\n\nAfter confirming the soils were balanced, the Sangiacomos bought the site and started thinking about planting.\n\n“We called it the passing of the torch vineyard,” Steve Sangiacomo remembered.\n\nDad decided it would be up to Steve and his brother Mike to plant the Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Merlot and pick out the rootstocks and clones. They ended up with 20 different clonal selection and rootstock combinations. Much still remains of the original 1999 planting (except for the Merlot, that’s long gone).\n\nA pre-plant contract with Clos du Bois to buy Chardonnay helped them get going, making Roberts Road one of the first vineyards to be planted in what is now the Petaluma Gap AVA. Sojourn Cellars is its longest running winery buyer, sourcing Pinot Noir from Roberts Road since 2003, and credits the vineyard for giving it its start.\n\n“It makes quintessential Pinot Noir,” winemaker Randy Bennett says. “Silky tannins, smooth texture.”\n\nAs for Grossi, he started Sweet Lane Wholesale Nursery in 2000 to grow specialty plants and one of the biggest collections of Japanese maples for landscaping projects (including at wineries) all over the Bay Area. In 2001 Grossi budded over that vegetable and fruit farm off Petaluma Hill Road near Roberts Road Vineyard to Pinot Noir.\n\nToday he looks after 16 acres of Sweet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes that he sells to Schramsberg to make sparkling wine and makes a tiny amount of wine of his own, mostly for friends.\n\nMeanwhile, the Petaluma Gap AVA has become a highly sought-after area for grapes. In 2012, Gap’s Crown Vineyard just above Roberts Road became the first in Sonoma County to sell for more than $100,000/acre, and Roberts Roads Vineyard has become a marquee site for more than 30 wineries, with about 18 vineyard-designated wines claiming its name in both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.\n\nOne of the most significant is the Sangiacomos’ own wine, made by winemaker James MacPhail, who says that every wine he’s made from Roberts Road Vineyard, beginning in 2003, showcases certain signatures of the site.\n\n“There’s an elegance to the tannins, they’re always silky,” he says. “There’s an earth and fruit balance, the wines always fall in the middle.”\n\nJeff Gaffner of Saxon Brown makes nine different Pinot Noirs but calls his Roberts Road Pinot, “the most feminine and seductive of all of them.”\n\nOther Roberts Road Vineyard wines to look for are being made by Adobe Road Winery, Anaba, Noria Wines and Westwood Wine. As for the future, the Sangiacomos plan to replant some of those older plantings over time, adding more Pinot Noir along the way.\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nAs many may remember, this very column was inspired by Sonoma County Winegrowers CEO & President Karissa Kruse’s 2022 TEDxSonomaCounty talk called, “Drink the Good Stuff.”\n\nDuring that talk, Karissa discussed how, after losing her home in the 2017 fires, she reflected on the impermanence of stuff, prompting her to rethink the notion of waiting for a special occasion to bring out a good bottle of wine, wear a special outfit or spend time with friends. The talk also renewed and reignited her fierce commitment to sustainability in Sonoma County and compelled her to always be asking, “What’s Next?”\n\nTEDxSonomaCounty returns this Saturday, March 2, 1:30 pm to 5:30 pm, around the theme, “Reimagine, Reconfigure, Reconnect.”\n\nThe theme’s description is inspiring and grand: “Climate change, generative artificial intelligence and unprecedented political polarization are reshaping our world. Organizations are responding by experimenting with four-day work weeks and increased remote work, changing the way we build social connections. As individuals we are more isolated with fewer bridges to community, which is so important to longevity and health. How do we cope? Think big!”\n\nLikening these ideas to a kaleidoscope, an opportunity to see things in a new light, organizers are emphasizing how to reimagine our world, reconfigure our organizations and reconnect to ourselves and our communities.\n\nOrganizers include a few folks with a rich sense of the importance of winegrowing and winemaking within our community, a glue that keeps many of our institutions and population engaged and connected.\n\nAnisya Fritz, PhD of Lynmar Estate, serves as emcee of the day’s event, and is an integral part of the planning committee. Dr. Fritz is proprietor and director of consumer experiences at Lynmar, in addition to serving as lead instructor for the Certificate in Wine Business Entrepreneurship at Sonoma State, and co-founder of the Fritz Institute, a not-for-profit organization that works on improving humanitarian aid and disaster relief systems around the world.\n\nTEDxSonomaCounty’s executive producer is Marilyn Nagel, an internationally known expert on diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging and leadership and co-founder of RISEQUITY, who curates the speakers each year.\n\nIn all, 12 speakers will take the stage this year, from Esquire Magazine’s Cal Fussman, who writes a popular column called “What Have I Learned?” and whose TED talk is titled, “The Heart of It,” to Mark Shapiro, MD, a practicing hospitalist who hosts a podcast called “Explore the Space” that brings those who provide healthcare and those who seek healthcare closer through conversation. His talk is on “Friendship 101.”\n\nTED is a nonprofit that started as a four-day conference in 1984 bringing together the worlds of Technology, Entertainment and Design. The organization continues to hold an annual conference in Vancouver, British Columbia with leading thinkers and doers from around the world who speak without notes for roughly 18 minutes (no longer), the standard for any TED-related talk.\n\nIt also runs the TED Fellows program, which in its time has included Fellows representing 14 countries from five continents who are leaders in their fields committed to community building. One fellow that stood out is Wiatta Thomas, an agribusiness entrepreneur in Guinea, Liberia and the U.S. considered an ag-tech pioneer.\n\nTEDx was created to support local groups and individuals looking to host self-organized TED events in their own communities. TEDxSonomaCounty began in 2012, held always at the Jackson Theater at Sonoma Country Day School in Santa Rosa.\n\nOther speakers and topics this year include:\n\nLawrence Beamen, a classical vocalist, songwriter, producer and composer on “Reclaiming the Power of ‘I’”\n\nBrooke Deterline, founder & CEO of Courageous Leadership on “Talking Across the Divide”\n\nDaniela Fernandez, founder of the Sustainable Ocean Alliance on “The Most Important Thing You’ll Ever Do”\n\nDawn Gross MD, PhD, a hospice and palliative medicine doctor, author, podcaster and magic wand bearer on “Ask: The Time is Now”\n\nQuinn Halleck, a Hollywood director and thought-leader on “Does Film Survive AI?”\n\nLuz Hernandez, a Santa Rosa local who benefited from the 10,000 Degrees program and is now a mentor for it, on “Paying It Forward and Back”\n\nGuy Kawasaki, the chief evangelist for Canva who previously served in the same role for Apple on “How to Murder Your Mediocrity”\n\nAlexandre Lazarow, a global venture capitalist author of “Out-Innovate: How Global Entrepreneurs – from Delhi to Detroit – Are Rewriting the Rules of Silicon Valley” on “The Great Diffusion”\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nIn a year that saw Barbie dominate the box office and Taylor Swift take over the world, it’s only fitting that Sonoma County’s Fundación de la Voz de los Viñedos would honor and recognize another hard-working woman, Yolanda Cruz, as its 2023 Employee of the Year.\n\nThe Employee Recognition Awards recognize vineyard employees for their leadership and talents in front of an audience of hundreds, including family members, colleagues and Congressman Mike Thompson, who has announced the Employee of the Year the last six years.\n\nIn all, 42 individuals were recognized for their work this year, including Employee of the Year Runner Up, Juan Avila of Emeritus Vineyards.\n\nThe first woman to be selected for this honor, Cruz has been part of the team at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management (REVM) for 23 years, becoming a supervisor in 2011 and formed the first all-women harvesting crew.\n\nHer boss, Kevin Barr, the president of REVM, acknowledged how much she has inspired other women, including the next generation, including two of her own children, now following in her footsteps.\n\nAn Agriculture Science/Viticulture graduate of UC Davis, Barr founded REVM in 1983 with a Chevy truck and a dream. Soon, he had 20 clients, 30 full-time employees and 500 acres of vineyards to manage between Santa Rosa and Cloverdale, with an early dedication to sustainability and Fish-Friendly Farming.\n\nWife Linda joined in 1991, a fourth-generation Sonoma County farmer raised in Geyserville on a prune and pear farm and winemaker herself.\n\nCo-owner Tyler Klick joined the team in 1997, first as a member of the grounds crew. In 2012 he led the vineyard management company to become the first to be certified sustainable in California. Three of their viticulture supervisors, Jesus Torres Martinez, Dante Guerro Ruano and Ramiro Rodriguez, have been with REVM for about 30 years.\n\nToday, REVM farms about 1,500 acres of vineyard in Sonoma County, Mendocino, Lake and Marin and own about 700 acres. They are a full-service vineyard management company but also do vineyard development, vineyard leasing and estate development in addition to a dedicated landscaping team. They have several women-only vineyard crews amidst a staff of about 250 people a year.\n\nIn addition to being leaders in sustainability, REVM has always embraced technology and mechanization in the vineyard, particularly around water monitoring and harvesting, investing in Pellenc Harvesters to soften labor needs.\n\nBut clearly REVM couldn’t do what it does without employees like Yolanda Cruz paving the way for future generations of women to excel and be recognized. Congratulations to all.\n\nWorld Ag Expo this Week\n\nThe Sonoma County Winegrowers will be at the World Ag Expo this week in Tulare with the team from John Deere. One of the largest agricultural trade shows in the world, it covers 2.6 million square feet of exhibit space, with 1,200 exhibitors.\n\nThe show’s beginnings date back to 1968, when it was known as The California Field and Row Crop Equipment Show. In 1969 it became the California Farm Equipment Show and by 1976 it had waiting lists for exhibitors, outgrowing the Tulare County Fairgrounds. Three years later it became the California Farm Equipment Show and International Exposition, reflecting the increasing interest from international exhibitors and attendees.\n\nThe year 1982 was the first to open at the International Agri-Center in Tulare, with 80 acres of exhibit space and 70 acres of parking. By 2000 that was no longer enough. The 76,000-square-feet Heritage Complex was built to house additional parts of the Ag Expo, as well as the Antique Farm Equipment Museum year-round. In 2001, it officially became the World Ag Expo.\n\nSeminars this year cover such topics as energy, food processing, innovation, irrigation, international trade and sustainability.\n\nPertinent to this week’s Employee of the Year, there will also be sessions around Women in Ag, including one preparing women for leadership roles in agriculture. It seems Yolanda Cruz could offer a perspective or two.\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nSonoma County is full of great chefs, from Healdsburg to Sonoma, from our border along the Napa Valley to the coast. But because of the bounty of things that grow here, wine grapes very much included, it also attracts chefs from all over the world, to come and cook here when they can.\n\nMatt Horn is one such chef, who will be cooking a Sonoma County-style barbecue lunch at Dutton Ranch during the events of Healdsburg Wine & Food.\n\nAs gifted a pitmaster as you’ll find, Horn opened Horn Barbecue in West Oakland in October 2020, cooking thousands of free meals for the community during the height of Covid. Food, for Horn, has always represented a communal bond and an arena for storytelling, a way to pay homage to pitmasters of the past.\n\nAlong the way, he’s been honored as one of Food & Wine’s Best New Chefs, been a James Beard Award finalist and earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand, credited by The New York Times with creating his own “unmistakable and unconfined style of California barbecue.” His cookbook, “Horn Barbecue: Recipes and Techniques from a Master of the Art of BBQ,” came out in April, 2022.\n\nCredited with creating the category of “West Coast barbecue,” the self-taught Horn never worked in a restaurant before starting his own and didn’t even start cooking until he was in his 20s. From Fresno, he worked in sporting goods stores in Southern California and lived on fast food until finding his calling in cooking. Barbecue became an obsession.\n\n“I asked myself, ‘If I could eat something every day, be around something, what would it be?’” he told Food & Wine’s Khushbu Shah. “And the thing that was deposited on me, into my heart, was barbecue. I think it’s the primal instinct of being around fire and cooking.”\n\nHis grandmother’s backyard became an experimental outdoor kitchen for Horn to find his way. Once he did, he started selling his barbecue at the local farmers market in Tracy, where he had moved into his in-laws’ place with his wife Nina and baby son.\n\nPop-ups soon followed before he literally envisioned having his own restaurant. Finally settled, at Horn Barbecue he cooked out of a 1,000-gallon offset smoker.\n\nHe has since also opened Kowbird, a phenomenal fried chicken concept, with locations in Oakland and Las Vegas, and Matty’s Old Fashioned, also in Oakland, a burger-centered nod to classic diners. He also runs AH2, a hospitality group that aims to empower chefs from minority communities.\n\nIngredients for all these concepts are of course important. As Horn told The New York Times, he cares most about the quality of the meats, and he works with small, regenerative farms in California to get the best.\n\nAs Food & Wine reported, last November a fire destroyed Horn Barbecue and a GoFundMe was set up to help Horn rebuild. Give him your support and meet this masterful chef and storyteller this May when he comes to Dutton Ranch for an unforgettable lunch paired with Sonoma County wines.\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nWhen the Sonoma County Winegrowers committed to becoming the most sustainable winegrowing region in the world in 2014, the focus was local, to make Sonoma County a better place to live, work and grow grapes, to make winegrowing a viable endeavor for generations to come.\n\nWhile it took five years to get 99% of the acreage third-party certified sustainable, it didn’t take long for the world to take notice of Sonoma County’s bold goal and to want to align on common ground. Sustainability had become Sonoma County’s calling card.\n\nThat calling card has brought forth a wide array of partnerships from both likely and unlikely corners.\n\nGuildSomm and the Sonoma County Winegrowers have partnered to host Masterclasses in key wine markets across the country, pouring Sonoma County wines for wine buyers and restauranteurs. That partnership also produces Top Somm, a competition where the 15 top sommeliers from around North America come to Sonoma County for a three-day immersion experience in the vineyards.\n\nAnother three-day immersion takes place in the form of the Healdsburg Wine & Food Experience in May. Co-founded by the Sonoma County Winegrowers, it is now in its third year. Part of the event’s mission is to support and elevate Sonoma County’s rich agricultural heritage and its farmers and vineyard employees, very much through the lens of sustainability.\n\nFurther afield, Areni Global is an independent think tank for fine wine that looks to solve the pressing issues of the day affecting wine, including environmental and societal changes.\n\nLast summer, Areni came to Sonoma County for part of its Insight Series, “Securing the Future of Fine Wine,” partnering with Sonoma County Winegrowers and the Wine Institute, bringing 50 thought leaders from 12 different countries to the region for vineyard immersions and work sessions.\n\nAnother international partner that came calling is FIVS, which works for the overall sustainability of the global beverage industry, including wine.\n\nShort for Federation Internationale des Industries et du Commerce en Gros des Vins, Spiritueaux, Eaux-de-vie et Liqueurs, FIVS gathers information to engage in such policy and technical issues as advertising restrictions, restrictive trade measures and allergen labeling requirements and serves as a networking platform for industry members, government officials and academic experts to collaborate on industry initiatives. Sonoma County Winegrowers President Karissa Kruse has spoken on Sonoma County’s sustainability efforts at their global meetings on several occasions including the recent FIVS meetings in London.\n\nCertainly, when Ford Pro came calling, looking to collaborate with Sonoma County Winegrowers to launch a pilot program with three Sonoma County farms and demonstrate how electric vehicles could have a positive impact on the agriculture industry, sustainability was at its core.\n\n“Ford Pro and the Sonoma County Winegrowers are driven by many of the same tenets,” Ford Pro global chief marketing officer Wanda Young said at the time, “to accelerate productivity while operating responsibly.”\n\nA longstanding partnership between Sonoma County and Landry’s dining establishments around the country is equally in sync, with the restaurant group committed to sustainability and environmentally friendly practices across its many restaurant, hospitality and entertainment venues around the world. This shared focus has led to a fruitful partnership where Sonoma County wines are featured because of how they represent sustainability.\n\nThis follows through with Sonoma County Winegrowers more recent partnership with the NBA’s Houston Rockets in the Toyota Center’s lounges, restaurants and other locations during Rockets games and other events during the year. The Houston Rockets have the same owner as Landry’s, making this a logical extension of its interest in Sonoma County’s sustainability impact.\n\nAgrology and Wilbur-Ellis are two other collaborators more centered within the agricultural sphere that align with Sonoma County’s sustainability ethos. Agrology works to sequester carbon by tracking soil carbon in real-time, while Wilbur-Ellis, one of the largest family-owned companies in the world, is a leader in sustainable agribusiness.\n\nEach of these partnerships and collaborations have chosen Sonoma County because of its commitment to sustainability and ability to communicate the importance of sustainable practices to a wide population of consumers.\n\nTen years after setting that initial goal to become the most sustainable winegrowing region in the world, Sonoma County is also now one of the most desirable names to be associated with when it comes to sustainability. There is only more to come.\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nThe Unified Wine & Grape Symposium taking place over three days this week in Sacramento is the country’s biggest wine and grape conference and a well-attended gathering for the industry. This year is the annual event’s 30th.\n\nDescribed by The Wine Economist’s Mike Veseth as “the Super Bowl of North American wine industry events,” when Unified first began in the mid 1990s, the wine market in the United States was growing thanks to the country’s demographics, rising wealth and a cultural embrace of moderate wine drinking as reasonably good for one’s health.\n\nThe event’s rise ever since reflects wine’s dramatic growth over all that time. The first Unified brought in 500 attendees and featured 20 exhibitor tables. In 2023, it drew more than 10,000 attendees and had over 650 exhibitors.\n\nThe event’s relevance began in 1995, the year the California Association of Winegrape Growers (CAWG) joined with the American Society for Enology and Viticulture (ASEV) to create the show, combining a trade show with a series of information sessions.\n\nAt the time, outgoing ASEV President Tom Peterson of Chateau Souverain Winery in Sonoma County was quoted saying, “The wine industry is experiencing incredible growth in the face of neo-prohibitionist threats, rising costs of goods and stiff competition. And I think one of the reasons we’ve been so successful is that we’re finally getting the clue that we need to work together.”\n\nCAWG itself was established in 1974 by a small group of grapegrowers concerned about getting fair prices for their grapes. Other specialty crops had statewide organizations, but wine grape farmers did not. A survey of growers was commissioned to determine if an organization should be set up and it was.\n\nToday, CAWG is governed by 27 growers who are elected to serve on the board of directors. From Sonoma County, Duff Bevill of Bevill Vineyard Management is currently serving as secretary of the organization and as a director from District 1 (which includes crush districts 1, 2, 3 and 4). Other Sonoma County winegrowers currently serving terms include Cameron Mauritson of Mauritson Farms and Karin Warnelius-Miller of Garden Creek Ranch Vineyards. Karissa Kruse, from Sonoma County Winegrowers, recently served a term as a Director-At-Large, a role on the CAWG board established to better connect the statewide organization with the regional wine and grape grower associations.\n\nAs CAWG has grown, it has shined a light on the fact that wine grapes are grown in 49 out of 58 of California counties, with more than 110 varieties of grapes in the ground. And while California on its own is the fourth leading wine producer in the world behind Italy, France and Spain, less than 1% of the state is planted to vineyards, about 618,000 acres.\n\nAmong the other things CAWG tracks is the impact of wine and wine grapes on the California economy. The 2022 figures are such:\n\nEmployment: 422,000 full-time jobs\n\nAnnual economic activity: $73 billion\n\nWages: $25.9 billion annually\n\nTaxes: $7.9 billion total\n\nTourism visits: 25.2 million wine-related tourist visits annually to wineries\n\nTourism spending: $8.6 billion in estimated wine visitor-related expenditures annually\n\nGiven the importance of wine grapes, CAWG takes on a range of issues that affect the people who grow them, from pest and disease management to advocacy with state and federal lawmakers.\n\nCAWG both sponsors and supports legislation it sees as positively impacting grapegrowing and works to oppose legislation that does not. Recent examples of legislation it has sponsored includes bills to increase groundwater recharge (which was signed into law), divert high-flowing streams for irrigation ponds (pending) and a $5 million appropriation to fund smoke taint research (failed).\n\nCAWG also partnered with the Wine Institute in 2003 to establish the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance (CSWA) and implement the Sustainable Winegrowing Program, a workbook tool for vintners and growers to assess their practices and improve their sustainability. For its efforts it has been awarded the Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award three times, in 2004, 2010 and 2015.\n\nCAWG also hosts an Awards of Excellence Reception at Unified to honor its Grower of the Year, which this year is Sangiacomo Family Vineyards, a Sonoma County pioneer in grapegrowing, particularly in the Carneros and Petaluma Gap AVAs.\n\nFormer CAWG President Karen Ross, a 4-H kid from Nebraska, played an important role in expanding Unified during her tenure between 1996 and 2009, and now serves as Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, appointed first in 2011 and re-appointed in 2019.\n\nSecretary Ross will give the keynote address at Unified on climate-smart agriculture, automation, biological solutions and energy challenges in California’s agricultural landscape to discuss sustainable solutions that empower growers and winemakers.\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nCountry songs often talk about beer or whisky, only occasionally about wine. And typically, when wine is mentioned it’s a generic reference, not a specific producer, let alone vintage.\n\nCountry singer Scotty McCreery, the winner of “American Idol” in 2011, is mixing things up with his 2023 song, “Cab in a Solo,” not just specifying that he’s drinking Cabernet Sauvignon, but name checking Silver Oak, of which he actually is a fan.\n\nAs McCreery told Wine Spectator last year, “we knew we needed a wine to include in the lyrics. Both (co-writer) Frank Rogers and I enjoy the Silver Oak wine, and the name fit perfectly in the lyrics as if it was meant to be.”\n\n“So now I’m finding out how a heartbreak tastes\n\nWith a Silver Oak, 1998\n\nDrinking Cab in a solo\n\nSolo in the cab of my truck”\n\nRogers elaborated, calling Silver Oak “a really nice wine that any wine drinker knows, but it’s not a wine that you’re going to drink daily. It’s a special occasion wine for most.” Not only is the heartbroken McCreery drinking a Silver Oak, he’s gone library, drinking a 1998.\n\nMade from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, the 1998 Alexander Valley Silver Oak Cabernet is a relatively light wine but juicy, balanced and soft, according to notes from a 2021 tasting. Enough to get through heartbreak? Only McCreery knows – the team at Silver Oak sent him a bottle after they heard the song.\n\nWhile Silver Oak, a stalwart name in California wine for some 50 years, famously maintains wineries in both the Napa Valley and Alexander Valley, the story begins in Sonoma County, where in 1970 Raymond Twomey Duncan bought his first land, in partnership with Jack Novak, who soon after founded Spottswoode Estate Vineyard and Winery in St. Helena.\n\nThe two men established the 100-acre Los Amigos Vineyard in the Alexander Valley on Highway 128 based on a Bank of America projection that wine consumption in America was due to grow significantly. It was a good bet.\n\nTwo years later, Duncan bought a 258-acre dairy barn in Oakville, partnering with winemaker Justin Meyer, who had been making wine at the Christian Brothers monastery. They initially called the brand Duncan-Meyer. It was Meyer’s wife Bonny who suggested Silver Oak (after the dairy barn’s location between the Silverado Trail and Oakville).\n\nThe first North Coast vintage was released in 1977 after three years of aging in American oak and two additional years in bottle (Alexander Valley was not yet an official American Viticultural Area, something it would achieve in 1984).\n\nThat first release of Silver Oak cost $6/bottle at a time when most California Cabernets were priced at $3/bottle. By 1983 it was selling for $16/bottle. Over the next two decades, Silver Oak would grow exponentially, selling out quickly upon release and becoming a popular choice on restaurant wine lists as it developed a very loyal following.\n\nIn the early 1990s Silver Oak bought the former Lyeth Vineyards and Winery in Geyserville for $2 million, which included 18 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes near Silver Oak’s 200 acres of Alexander Valley vineyards already in existence.\n\nDaniel Baron took over winemaking in 1994 after Meyer’s retirement, when Meyer also sold his shares of Silver Oak back to the Duncans. The owners today are David and Tim Duncan, Ray’s sons.\n\nIn 2012 the Duncans bought the Sausal Vineyard and Winery, an historic 113-acre property in the benchlands of the Mayacamas Mountains in Alexander Valley, with 75 acres of grapes, most of them Zinfandel. The Demostene family had farmed Sausal since 1956, having at one point also owned Soda Rock Winery. The vineyards themselves date back to 1847 and Cyrus Alexander, who called the area “one of the most fertile posts in the whole country.”\n\nSilver Oak soon replanted most of the Zin to Cabernet Sauvignon and bought additional vineyards in the area to boost its sourcing and add to the backbone of its holdings, the 80-acre Miraval Vineyard, owned since 1987. Crazy Creek Vineyard and Big River Vineyards were added in 2016 and 2017.\n\nWith Silver Oak now happy in its new digs, the former Silver Oak/Lyeth facility was then sold to Michael David Winery of Lodi in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Silver Oak’s new Sonoma County winery became the world’s first to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification for building, design and construction, with a goal of zero net water and zero net energy use. In 2019 it received global recognition from the International Living Future Institute.\n\nSince then, Silver Oak has added Big River and Crazy Creek vineyards to its Alexander Valley holdings, owning about 277 total acres in the region.\n\nWhether it’s Silver Oak or something else in your solo cup or wine glass, like McCreery, remember to enjoy the good stuff this year.\n\n(photo from Wine Spectator; Jeff Ray)\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nPlenty of grape growers have had former or concurrent careers. Not a lot of them have been intensive care nurses. Jim Rickards of J. Rickards Vineyards and Winery in Cloverdale has had a long career as such over the last 40 years, while planting and growing a vineyard on the east side of the Alexander Valley.\n\nLong devoted to sustainable viticulture, he also serves on the Sonoma County Winegrowers Board of Directors.\n\nWhen Jim and his wife Eliza came across the 60-acre site in 1976, Jim had already served in the military (where he had done much of his medical training), run a cattle business in Petaluma he had to give up because of ongoing drought, and started to work full-time in local hospitals, doing his tractor work in the vineyard at night and taking viticulture courses from Santa Rosa Junior College when he could.\n\nThe site already had old-vine Zinfandel planted in 1908, vines the Rickards have continued to maintain. They can be traced back to the Brignole family, natives of Genoa, Italy, who had been part of Asti Swiss Colony and planted an Italian field blend on the property seven feet apart, which would have been plowed by horses and mules.\n\nJosephine Brignole Camaur lived from 1914 to 2018 and was born on the Brignole Ranch, where J. Rickards sits now. The ranch was originally owned by industrialists in San Francisco and managed by Josephine’s father, Giovanni. Her mother, Rosa Rocca, who immigrated to America in 1904 at the age of 16, was able to buy all 360 acres of it in 1919.\n\nJosephine and three older siblings lived and worked on the ranch for many years. Rosa sadly died in 1940 from botulism caused by consuming the poisonous bacteria that lurked in some canned figs.\n\nAfter graduating from Geyserville High School and Santa Rosa Junior College, Josephine, who had also been poisoned but survived, married Cesare Camaur in the chapel at Asti in 1941. The ranch was sold soon after and the Camaurs lived in Dry Creek Valley for the remainder of their years, raising one son, Richard, and tending a small vineyard and rose garden. Josephine lived to be 103. She published a brief history of her mother’s life, “The Rosa Brignole Ranch,” in 1996, which can be accessed through the Sonoma County Library.\n\nThe Brignole Zin is joined by some of the classic grapes of the time, like Carignane and Golden Chasselas. The Rickards honor the family by still calling the old vine portion the Brignole Vineyard.\n\nWhile the Rickards continue to sell a lot of their grapes, including the Cabernet Sauvignon to neighboring Silver Oak and Zinfandel to Passalacqua, they started making their own wine in 1991, building a winery on site in 2005. They also built their own house and have long grown much of their own food.\n\nThey’re at about 5,000 cases/year these days and still invite friends to help bottle a special red wine blend once a year during Family Bottling Day, a ritual that started in 1993 with the first vintage.\n\nJim and his team do their own grafting rather than going with prepared stock; they’ve hand-grafted every one of their 54,000-plus vines on the property. Juan Favela has worked with the site since 1990, while husband-wife team Jorge Alcazar and Aguida Arias Carillo have been core members of the vineyard crew since 2003.\n\nJim is a great storyteller who loves entertaining visitors at the winery. He’ll be on hand during Winter WINEland this coming Saturday, the same day the Good Stuff show on KSRO will air our conversation with Jim. Tune in at 1 p.m. PST or listen to the podcast of the show.\n\nBy Virginie Boone\n\nIn 1964, Sonoma County natives Gail and Warren Dutton bought a 35-acre ranch outside of Graton one year into their marriage to grow apples and wine grapes. The original grapes were French Colombard, but they wisely planted the region’s first 20 acres of Chardonnay in 1967.\n\nA fourth-generation farmer, whose Sonoma County lineage stretched all the way back to 1881, Warren’s family had long grown prunes, pears and walnuts in Santa Rosa, collaborating with Luther Burbank at one point to develop 20,000 prune trees in the Roseland area. He and Gail had both gone to Santa Rosa High and were high school sweethearts who married soon after graduating.\n\nIt was Gail who soon realized it would be more profitable to sell produce direct to consumers than let fruit rot, go otherwise unsold or sell for less to local canneries.\n\nAnd so while Warren focused on moving the family farming business more seriously into wine grapes, Gail operated a fruit stand at 2808 Sebastopol Road west of Stony Point Road in Santa Rosa, selling pears, prunes, apples, dried fruit and gift packs while raising two babies.\n\n“I remember I was changing diapers and selling apples at the same time,” Gail told the Press Democrat’s Tim Tesconi in 1985.\n\nShe also wisely created a mailing list to keep in touch with customers, not something most people were doing at the time. It grew to 2,500 customers. Soon she was packaging gift boxes of California produce for shipment “to places where a gift of oranges is as precious as a gift made of diamonds,” said a November 1983 story in The Press Democrat.\n\n“Californians often overlook the idea of sending Christmas fruit gifts back East,” Dutton told the newspaper at the time. “We take it for granted.”\n\nGail opened the fruit stand in 1969, selling pears when the Dutton’s had an overabundance. She started advertising and sold boxes of fruit for $1 each, operating the stand seven days a week from August through December.\n\nBefore long, she was selling homegrown apples, walnuts, dried fruits, jellies, jams, honey, juices and candy. Back then, gift boxes ranged from $3 to $17.50. She ran the fruit stand for close to 20 years, selling it and the surrounding 10-acre property in 1985 as the family continued to grow into more wine grapes and the city of Santa Rosa annexed the property to be developed.\n\nThat farm stand’s legacy remains in the form of other successful farm stands and direct-to-consumer farming operations around Sonoma County. Due to her success and entrepreneurial gumption, Gail became a founding member of Farm Trails in 1973, an organization dedicated to connecting Sonoma County residents to local farmstands, lighting the way for others to follow. This was before the widespread advent of farmers’ markets or CSAs.\n\nSonoma County Farm Trails promotes farmers and educates the public on the importance of local agriculture. The Gravenstein Apple Fair is its signature fundraising event.\n\nMany Sonoma County wineries are Farm Trails members, from Korbel to Jordan, Iron Horse and Kendall-Jackson Wine Estate and Gardens. So are restaurants like SingleThread, farmers’ markets, bakeries, ranches, orchards and many other kinds of farms, a lovely legacy that stretches from Gail’s fruit stand of the 1960s, 70s and early 80s to today."
