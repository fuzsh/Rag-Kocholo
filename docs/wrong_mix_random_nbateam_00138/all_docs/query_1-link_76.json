        "text": "While any day is good when pies are involved on National Pie Day you have an excuse to eat all the pies and the Houston Life team did just that! From pecan to pizza to an Aussie Staple, the meat pie, Melanie Camp arranged a few samples for Lauren Kelly and Derrick Shore to dig into.\n\nKPRC 2 and Houston Life are partnering with Energy Transfer this month to highlight the local organization Kids Meals and their mission to make sure young kids in our communities have something to eat. It is basic but so important. Kids Meals delivers free healthy meals to children five and under, and they want your help to make Houston the first city to end childhood hunger.\n\nAuthor Liz Williams is a bone marrow transplant survivor and is using her book \"The Junk-Bike Crew & Mattie's Match\" to help kids understand what getting a bone marrow transplant is all about. Courtney and Derrick sat down to chat with Williams about her book and how she wants to donate books to children battling cancer.\n\nMany families in Houston celebrate The Epiphany or Three Kings Day on January 6 with a Rosca De Reyes. This beautifully decorated sweet bread is the centerpiece of a long held tradition that celebrates the end of the Christmas season. Houston Life sent Melanie Camp along to Arandas Bakery in Sharpstown to learn more about, including the significance of baking in a little baby Jesus figurine into the bread.\n\nIt seems everywhere you go right now, the world is decked out for the holidays. But, what about your home? Is it missing a little something special? Guided through the process by local floral pro, Ace Berry, Courtney and Derrick show you how to wow your friends with an amazing holiday centerpiece that you can make yourself!\n\nAll children deserve a safe and comfortable place to lay their heads but so many in Houston do not even have their own bed. Sleep in Heavenly Peace is a group of local volunteers who are doing their bit to make sure no child sleeps on the floor in Houston.\n\nThe holiday season is here and a family favorite is checking out all of the holiday lights across the city. This year Reliant has two events they want you to see. Think Instagram worthy photos with all the twinkling lights and music your merry heart desires. Houston Life’s Melanie Camp headeddown I-45 South to the Houston Botanic Garden and Space Center Houston to check things out.\n\nThe car made famous by the movie ‘Back to the Future’ is headed to the future with its first new model in 40 years. That is right, a new DeLorean has been announced and in anticipation of its arrival, Houston Life headed to Classic DeLorean in Humble to take a look at a bit of the company’s history.\n\nThe sweetest house in the world is in Houston at Sweets by Belen. This place is a go to for the Houston Life team whether we are celebrating birthdays or satisfying a sweet tooth craving. But the story behind Belen Bailey's journey from Peru to teaching to baking is just as sweet as the alfajors she bakes in honor of her mother and grandmother.\n\nMany folks think of McKinney as just another DFW suburb, but no matter how close McKinney is to Big D, it’s worthy of a day trip all its own. McKinney has history, a lively square, and plenty of personality to keep a traveler entertained and well-fed all day long. Collin County History MuseumPioneer Collin McKinney was such a pivotal figure that the county took his first name and the town took his last name—an accolade not even Sam Houston or Davy Crockett can claim. This museum sits inside the old 1911 post office and mixes new technology with treasured artifacts to create an interactive history lesson. Heritage Village at Chestnut SquareOn two city blocks sit more than half a dozen historic homes and buildings, including the 1854 Faires House, the oldest house in McKinney.\n\nI’ve booked a night at Hudspeth River Ranch via Explore Ranches, an online platform that offers guests overnight stays at top-tier private ranches in Texas, California, Colorado, and New Mexico. Explore Ranches’ properties tend to run more expensive due to the size of the accommodations and the various optional amenities. As kids, Sarah and Abbey Strunk sipped the waters that bubbled from the limestone creekbed on their family’s Hudspeth River Ranch. Kleberg, Explore Ranches’ co-owner, has a personal connection to this mission. If you want to protect Texas land, you need to collaborate with landowners.\n\nIt marked the first rendezvous of the American space shuttle with Russia’s space station Mir. Also on board, Eileen Collins, an American, became the first woman to pilot a space shuttle, and C. Michael Foale became the first British-born American astronaut to walk in space. “I saw that as an avenue for me to go to space,” Harris said. In August 1990, Harris began a year of training and evaluation with 22 classmates at Johnson Space Center. We have liftoffSpace Center Houston, the official visitor center of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, reopened in July after a temporary closure due to COVID-19.\n\nThis fall marks the 27th anniversary of the release of Richard Linklater’s iconic, coming-of-age movie, Dazed and Confused. Tapping into the most famous line of dialogue in the movie, Alright, Alright, Alright: An Oral History of Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused by Melissa Maerz unpacks everything a dedicated viewer would want to know about this timeless classic. I had just started my first year of high school, and I remember identifying with Mitch. Early on, I’d used Alright, Alright, Alright as a placeholder title in my book proposal. But everyone convinced me to keep Alright, Alright, Alright because it’s so iconic.\n\n“I remind people that javelinas are not dangerous,” says Raymond Skiles, a retired Big Bend National Park wildlife biologist. Over the decades, their range has receded to the South Texas brush county, the western Edwards Plateau and the Trans-Pecos. According to the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, which has conducted aerial surveys of javelina populations, Texas harbors about 200,000 javelinas. Despite these threats, “javelinas are doing very well in South Texas,” says Chico Barrera, a Kingsville-based TPWD natural resources specialist. The javelina is also a cultural icon in South Texas, starring as the official mascot for Texas A&M University-Kingsville’s athletic programs.\n\nDown a rural farm road on the outskirts of Bergheim, 40 minutes north of San Antonio, lies the green pasture nurturing Texas' first legal hemp farm. The Ruples primarily focus on cannabidiol, or CBD, a naturally occurring extractable compound found in hemp plants. Through their company, Pur IsoLabs, they have been formulating custom CBD products with hemp from Kentucky and Oregon. Now, this farm gives them a chance to grow and manufacture purely Texas products. It will likely be the first fully vertical hemp and CBD operation in the state that grows, harvests, dries, extracts, formulates, and manufactures CBD and hemp products in one place.\n\nIt’s a late October morning in the Davis Mountains of West Texas, and Molly Cummings is atop a scaffold, foraging alligator juniper berries from a wild tree. The spirits company produces two gins, WildBark and WildJune, which are both distilled from rye and malted barley and infused with juniper berries native to the Davis Mountains. A fellow scientist told her where to find alligator juniper, also known as checkerbark, which grows above approximately 6,000 feet in the Davis Mountains. While she was collecting alligator juniper berries, she found another type of juniper that wouldserve as the backbone for WildJune. The plant, red berry juniper, is a rare species mainly found in parts of West Texas and the Panhandle, with the richest concentration in the Davis Mountains.\n\nIt takes tenacity to live on the Texas coast, and perhaps nobody knows that more than the people of Palacios (pronounced Puh-lash-iss). This bay front town, halfway between Houston and Corpus Christi, has weathered many storms in its day. When you’re finished, grab a cone of Blue Bell ice cream for the road and visit the neighboring shops on Main Street. My favorite spot to fish is the public pier of South Bay Park in front of the Luther Hotel. To view the Taylor episode visit thedaytripper.com.\n\n“That’s the tiny town in the middle of the desert with a Prada store, right?” Well, yes and no. Prada Marfa is not in Marfa proper, but instead a 40-minute drive west, outside Valentine. Built 15 years ago, Prada Marfa borrows elements from pop art, minimalism, and land art. “Pre-social media, it was left to its own devices for a long time,” Elmgreen told Ballroom Marfa in an interview celebrating the piece’s 15th anniversary. Instead of collapsing back into dust, Prada Marfa became a destination in its own right.\n\nDuring that time period, Texas women formed suffrage clubs in cities like Denison, Taylor, Granger, Dallas, and Fort Worth. Hobby called a special legislative session to discuss granting women the right to vote, and on March 26, 1918, he signed the bill into law. White women knew white men would not support any measure that allowed Black women to vote—or that encouraged interaction between white women and Black men at polling places—so they excluded Black women from their suffrage organizations. Game-ChangersThese prominent activists changed the way Texans thought about women’s right to vote. As a journalist for Laredo newspapers, she supported women’s suffrage and urged women to participate in the public sphere.\n\nIf pondering whether to head to the renowned Round Top Antiques Show, which is currently underway, and wondering what you might find there, the answer is pretty simple: Little has changed in the age of COVID-19, other than the obvious. There’s a similar gathering in the spring, but this year’s event was canceled with the pandemic’s onset. Scattered across roughly 65 venues around Round Top, a burg measuring some 610 acres and famously boasting a permanent population of fewer than 100 people, the antiques fair also casts its net over other towns and communities such as Fayetteville, Carmine, Burton, and Warrenton. All venues agreed upon adjustments with an eye toward “putting together a show that feels safe and healthy to everyone—and there’s a lot of fresh air at all the venues,” says Katie Stavinoha, publisher of The Round Top Antiques Show Guide and Round Top Register. The antiques fair doesn’t have a way to police the landscape, leaving everyone to mind the honor system of being a good neighbor, Plant explains.\n\nWith COVID-19 pushing many people to seek respite in the outdoors, state parks across Texas are more popular than ever. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has worked to control crowds by limiting capacity and requiring advance bookings. If you’re looking to steer clear of the most popular parks and find an outdoors escape, consider these seven state parks, which according to TPWD are some of the least-visited in the system. Annual visitors: 5,929Located near Devil’s Sinkhole is Kickapoo Cavern State Park, characterized by scrub-covered limestone hills and plenty of wildlife. At the edge of the Big Thicket just 10 miles north of Beaumont, the state park features fishing, biking, birding, and camping opportunities along the free-flowing creek.\n\nAsk three vintners what it means to make “natural wine” and you’ll get three different answers, probably accompanied by a shrug. And yet, natural wine production is on the rise across the country. Think of natural wine as less is more. By forgoing those tools, natural wine producers leave themselves more exposed to nature’s whims, making their own jobs harder. 512-829-1650;southoldfarmandcellar.comRobert Clay VineyardsTry the pétillant naturel, a crowd-pleasing entry into natural wine for lovers of rosé and bubbles.113 Austin St., Mason.\n\nThe Texas Kolache Trail has made these Czech treats destination-worthy, but outside of towns such as West and Ellinger, you can still find some excellent eats, say along the Austin-to-San Antonio Interstate 35 corridor. Dos Gatos Kolache Bakery in San Marcos divides its menu into “Texas Kolaches” (the ones with meat or savory veggies) and “Czech Kolaches,” those with fruit, cream, or cheeses. While some bakeries serve klobasnek that look like pigs in a blanket, they are more like puffy pastry rolls. There will be no powdered sugar spilled, no grease from a fast-food burger, no unseemly shirt stains, unless you somehow topple a blueberry kolache onto yourself. Appreciate the travel-worthiness of road kolaches.\n\nThe fall foliage season is upon us, providing colorful scenery in every region of Texas. The latter park’s website notes fall color is coming slightly earlier this year because of cold weather in September. East Texas provides plenty of opportunities for fall foliage lovers, with its heavily wooded areas. David Creech, director of SFA Gardens, notes the best time to see the Japanese maples in fall color is the end of November and early December. Finally, fall foliage in the Lower Rio Grande Valley usually doesn’t arrive until December and goes into January.\n\nA trip to Taylor provides the essentials of any Lone Star diet: slow-smoked bar­becue and cold local beer. Louie Mueller BarbecueKnown as the “Cathedral of Smoke,” this spot is one of Texas' most beloved barbecue joints. Since Louie Mueller first started serving barbecue in 1949, it’s been a no-frills kind of place. The separate bars and jukeboxes tell the story of segregation in Taylor, but also how the community found common ground in great local barbecue. Davis Grocery and BarbecueCheck out this under-the-radar grocery store and barbecue stop if you’re still in the mood for a snack.\n\nThey’re from India and Pakistan, so the sight of them grazing along the coastal prairies of South Texas may seem incongruous. The vast majority of these nilgai are descended from animals introduced on the legendary King Ranch in nearby Kleberg County. In 1924, Caesar Kleberg, the head of King Ranch, was deep into a long-term wildlife restoration project on his range. King Ranch is a vast collection of land—at 825,000 acres, it’s larger than Rhode Island. “We do roughly 400 commercial hunts a year.”After decades in South Texas, the animals have left their mark on the ranchlands.\n\nToday, we’re featuring the iconic Texas-born ice cream company who some say makes the “best ice cream in the country” — Blue Bell Creameries. Ice cream flavors include 25 classic year-round options like homemade vanilla, cookies ’n cream and moo-llenium crunch. It wasn’t until the 1980s when Blue Bell ice cream was available in stores outside of Texas. However, the company says it was quick to claim a spot as one of the country’s go-to ice cream brands. What’s your favorite Blue Bell ice cream flavor?\n\nIt wasn’t until I was driving out of the parking lot that I remembered the fried Oreo. Lucky for me, organizers replaced the fair as best as they could with the Big Tex Fair Food Drive-Thru. It felt good to see the 55-foot-tall iconic Big Tex, even if he wore a face mask and the usual crowds didn’t surround him. It felt good to taste food that, even if you can get it elsewhere, somehow tastes better at the fair. When baseball season ends, football begins, and the State Fair of Texas hosts the Red River Showdown between Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nThe metal arms of a hydraulic shaker clamp around the trunk of a mature pecan tree, performing a high-speed vibrato lasting nearly a minute. Pecans, one of the only major tree nuts native to North America, are now grown in 15 states. By the early 20th century, pecan cultivation was so widespread and successful in Texas, the state Legislature designated the pecan tree as the official state tree. The wild pecan trees here are of the Carya illinoinensis species, which is indigenous to the Pecan Belt. Texas Pecan Board executive director Whitney notes that, increasingly, chefs who prioritize regional sourcing are interested in purchasing specific varieties.\n\nFairchild, an Austin school teacher, is hooked on carp fishing. But some wrongly believed carp threatened native species, and the commission was abolished four years later, according to Aaron Reed’s book, Fly Fishing Austin & Central Texas. Today non-native common carp are ubiquitous in lakes and rivers across the state, and carp fishing has grown in popularity. Both Fairchild and Fenner, who works as a fishing guide, practice what’s called Euro-style carp fishing. If you’re looking for a guide, check with Austin Carp Angler, whose members can show you the basics.\n\nPasadena resident Debbie Trainor wasn’t able to visit Italy this summer like she had planned. Even though COVID-19 made international travel unlikely this year, she still wanted to take a fun, safe trip with European flair. “I’ve got to do something.”That’s when she got the idea to take a trip around Texas visiting cities with European names. Among the cities she planned to visit were Moscow, Paris, Dublin, Berlin, and Vienna. “The people that we met along the way were amused that we were doing [the trip],” Trainor says.\n\nSince 1971, the nondenominational Rothko Chapel has served as a quiet oasis for contemplation amid Houston’s bustling Montrose neighborhood. Visitors can witness the new transformations when the chapel reopens to the public on Sept. 24. When the chapel opened in 1971, it had a skylight, but the light was too intense and washed out the paintings. What do you hope visitors take away from their experience at the chapel? The chapel is a statement about the power of contemplation and action, about interior transformation and social transformation.\n\nIf you grew up in Texas, you’ve probably eaten at Luby’s. And if you’ve eaten at Luby’s, your feelings about the restaurant may run surprisingly deep. When I asked friends and family what springs to mind when they think of Luby’s, sweet tea, yeast rolls, and Papaw’s liver and onions came up a lot. Another Tyler friend, now in Houston, shared a treasured memory of her grandmother: “She would pick me up from kindergarten and we headed straight to Luby’s. Apparently, the Tyler Luby’s closed a few years ago.\n\nThis crime caper finds Jones portraying a Texas Ranger who goes undercover at the University of Texas. Texas Monthly’s Skip Hollandsworth decreed it one of the worst films ever to have been shot in Texas. And, so we head deeper into far West Texas. Along with Fort Davis, Alpine appears in The Good Old Boys, but Jones' real-life shenanigans overshadow the town’s appearance in that film. While much of the movie was shot on the director’s far West Texas ranch, one publicly accessible exception is Lindsey’s Cafe, formerly known as the Sands Restaurant.\n\n“Remember to stay in your lane,” Linklater tells the boys. Growing up in Houston during those years felt like living in a real-life science fiction movie, Linklater tells me. “This is the last thing that the whole world thought was good,” Linklater tells me. Scene after scene, Linklater is behind the camera or talking with actors or producers. “It’s fun to dial in on those details to try to get them right,” Linklater tells me.\n\nNow three companies have given the trend a Texas twist with canned ranch water. Canned ranch water, unlike mass market spiked seltzer, avoids the cloying, too-sweet taste while still packing a refreshing punch. Owner Katie Beal Brown, a West Texas native, remembers folks in her ranching family drinking ranch water all her life. This fall, new flavors like Spicy Ranch Water, made with jalapeño, and Rio Red Grapefruit Ranch Water, will join the line. Whether ranch water will become a national phenomenon like spiked seltzer remains to be seen.\n\nWhatever the reason you’re here, whether you’re in the midst of planning you’re next getaway, you’re searching for images to tack to your unique Airbnb vision board, or you just need something to gawk at to pass the time cooped up indoors, enjoy a virtual tour of this one-of-a-kind vacation rental located in the Texas Hill Country.\n\nI’ve backpacked the John Muir Trail—a 200-mile route through California’s Sierra Nevada—along with routes in Montana, and of course, my home state of Texas. But Texas also offers scenic backpacking opportunities in centrally located parks like Lost Maples State Natural and Pedernales Falls State Park. Your list of essentials should include cookware, a campstove (I use one a Snow Peak Gigapower the size of a Snickers bar) and fuel; a filtration system to purify water; water bottles or bladders; a headlamp; matches; first-aid; hand sanitizer; small knife; toilet paper; and sunscreen. Freeze-dried meals are light and packed with the calories and sodium you need if you’re hiking all day. Colorado Bend State Park has walk-in sites .6 miles from a parking lot, and Pedernales Falls State Park has spots a 2-mile hike in.\n\nIf you went to high school in Texas, you’ve seen them: extravagant faux chrysanthemums done up in glitter, lights, and stuffed mascots, with ribbons and braids trickling down. Mums—and garters, their male counterparts—are homecoming staples all over the state and a rite of passage for high schoolers. Homecoming mums are said to have appeared in Texas during the 1930s, but the first known homecoming mums were worn in Missouri, which also hosted the first-ever homecoming football game in 1911. Mums, IncorporatedKisha Clark has made mums since high school, and her passion for the art has only increased with time. When do you start prepping for homecoming season?\n\nIts establishment 300 years ago changed San Antonios culture forever.From the day I was born until I moved away in the 80s, Mission San Jos was a constant in my life. Many stories connect neighbors and descendants over the three centuries since the establishment of Mission San Jos in 1720. Mission San Jos y San Miguel de Aguayo was established by Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus, two years after the Alamo was established. The Mission San Jos mural project is sponsored by the San Antonio non-profit Mission Heritage Partners and Luminaria. In a unique partnership with the National Park Service, the San Antonio Food Bank harvests the 45 acres.\n\nHOUSTON Welcome to Made in Texas, where we write about products made in the Lone Star State. Today, were featuring one of the go-to brands of the white bread loaf for Texas families Mrs Bairds. The productThis Texas-born bread brand features its classic white bread loaf in large and small sizes, as well as different varieties. Who was Mrs Bairds? Today, the company has four bakery locations across the Lone Star State.\n\nMy trip to Garner State Park and Lost Maples State Natural Area in the fall of 2019 proved I was wrong on all counts. In the afternoon, we made the short drive to use our day pass at Lost Maples. Yet all of this was eclipsed by an even more breathtaking place: the Lost Maples gift shop. Texas Parks and Wildlife has a number of excellent gift shops, many run by volunteer groups, but nothing could have prepared us for the fashion finds at Lost Maples. This gift shop had a collection of T-shirts with a delightfully 90s logo reading LOST MAPLES with colorful embroidered leaves.\n\nTo experience the best stargazing on a campout, Katie Raney, a regional interpretive specialist with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, recommends getting away from any kind of light—such as lanterns, restrooms, or street lights—and finding an open area. Good options include South Llano River and Guadalupe River state parks, which are relatively near San Antonio and Austin; Lake Ray Roberts and Lake Mineral Wells state parks in the DFW area; and Brazos Bend and Lake Somerville state parks near Houston. Eakins says her favorites Enchanted Rock, Pedernales Falls, Garner, and Davis Mountains state parks.

As wed sing along, the glowing lights of UTs campus would dim, and the tower would fade from sight. Thats how we knew we were in Austins Hancock neighborhood, seemingly worlds away from the student-filled streets of West Campus. On a normal trip, Selam and I could stay up to three hours in the store just hanging out. Recently, Selam and I havent been able to take part in our joint trips to H-E-B because of the pandemic.\n\nHAMILTON, Texas This article first appeared on Texas Highways. So it is with Hamiltonset in the northern Hill Country, equidistant between Fort Worth and Austinhome to Wenzel LoneStar Meat Co. Fans make 200-mile round trips from their big-city homes for owner Kent Wenzels smoked pulled pork, featured on Pork Butt Fridays. The seat of Hamilton County, Hamilton is rooted in ranching, farming, and hunting. A 2012 restoration of the celebrated limestone courthouse sparked a downtown revitalization, including the expansion of the Hamilton County Historical Museum.\n\nThough many wine connoisseurs have never heard of Munson, wine historians consider his 19th-century research to be among the biggest influences on the beverage as we know it. In the mid-19th century, French wine was an international phenomenon and big business, accounting for more than 15% of Frances federal tax revenue. The tactics stemmed the tide of phylloxera and saved a range of delicate French grape varieties, including cabernet, merlot, pinot noir, and chardonnay. Even now, 135 years later, France grows wine grapes rooted on the descendants of Texas native plants. Munson Center and co-author of the biography Grape Man of Texas: Thomas Volney Munson and the Origins of American Viticulture.\n\nIt took a few decades for me to realize that the most meaningful road trip of my life was a mere 15 miles long, and right outside my door. More than any other place, Montrose loomed large on that list. I discovered Houstons then-bohemian Montrose neighborhood that year, which also coincided with the first time I fell in love. I bought incense and stained glass at the Westheimer Art Festival each year, and paints and charcoals at Texas Art Supply. Its not always a yearlong RV trip or the summer you drove 2,000 miles hitting up every national park in your van.\n\nHutchins BBQ, a DFW staple since the 1990s, has simple tips for the home pit master. The good news is brisket is still in demandits the heartbeat Hutchins BBQ and has been ever since Roy Hutchins started smoking on the side of the road in Princeton in 1978.
