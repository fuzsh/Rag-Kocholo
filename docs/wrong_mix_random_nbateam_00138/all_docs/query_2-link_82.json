        "text": "Epidurals are one of the safest, most effective, and most widely used forms of pain management for women in labor around the world. More than 60 percent of laboring patients choose to get an epidural, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists.\n\nResearch has shown that getting an epidural is safe and effective for nearly all laboring moms and their babies. But nevertheless, myths persist.\n\nChoosing a labor pain relief method is a personal decision. You deserve the facts to make an educated choice. So, we've put together a list of the nine most common myths about labor pain epidurals, based on questions that patients have asked my colleagues and me. Let's get to debunking!\n\nWe can place your epidural at the beginning, middle, or even toward the end of labor – we have safely placed epidurals in women who were dilated to 10cm. UT Southwestern has anesthesiologists on staff 24/7 to provide an epidural as soon as you want it. The only timing criteria are that you:\n\nAre in active or induced labor, which your Ob/Gyn or midwife will confirm.\n\nCan remain still and calm for five to 10 minutes for the procedure, which might be tough if you're close to delivering.\n\nOnce in a while, patients are within minutes of delivering when they get to the hospital. In those cases, there simply may not be time to give the epidural. This is uncommon but tends to happen more frequently in women who've given birth before.\n\nRelated reading: What to do when the baby’s coming – right now\n\nMany drugs, from Tylenol to the medication in an epidural, can potentially cross the placenta and affect the baby, but research has shown that the amount of medication that enters your bloodstream and the baby's when you have an epidural is quite low.\n\nStudies have shown that getting an epidural does not negatively affect the baby's Apgar scores (newborn functional testing), nor does it increase the risk of needing neonatal intensive care.\n\nRelated reading: Should I stop taking medication when I’m pregnant?\n\nSeveral landmark studies have shown that getting an epidural does not increase the chance you'll need a cesarean section delivery. Previously, we thought epidurals may increase your risk of vacuum- or forceps-assisted delivery, but more recent evidence has suggested this is no longer true.\n\nWhile the epidural should block most of the pain of labor, it should not complicate labor or prevent you from pushing. Epidural medication will not cause fetal distress or cause the baby to \"get stuck.\" When this happens, it's likely that the situation would have occurred regardless of whether the patient had received an epidural.\n\nLabor is typically divided into two stages – progressive cervical dilation to 10cm and pushing. Getting an epidural has no effect on how long stage one takes. Some research suggests the pushing stage might be a bit longer if you are more relaxed and pushing is less urgent, but we're likely talking minutes, not hours.\n\nAdvancements in epidural medication administration over the last 20 years have allowed us to control pain without making you feel as weak. You'll still be able to feel pressure from contractions (with less or no pain), and you'll still be able to push. The anesthesia team will securely tape the catheter in place after it is inserted so that you can move comfortably in the bed and switch positions as you like.\n\nThe more likely culprit is that your body is sore from the pregnancy and delivery experience, and the constant bending and lifting required for newborn care.\n\nAfter any injection, from a flu shot to an epidural, you'll likely feel some pain and swelling at the injection site, which should resolve within a week. Me personally, I felt like the tenderness was a fair trade for three less painful labors and deliveries.\n\nLabor pain is very intense – I know firsthand from having my own babies. Choosing an epidural is not a failure. It's a choice to help you stay calm and focused, which is so important for a successful delivery. There are plenty of things to worry about as a mom – so you shouldn't feel defeated if your birth plan changes and you decide to get an epidural.\n\nYour anesthesiologist will ask you to hold as still as possible for five to 10 minutes. We ask patients to curl forward, with their back arched like a shrimp. They will numb a spot on your spine, then insert the needle and a tiny tube into your spine. It will feel like a pinch, and you will feel some pressure as the needle is positioned – we're looking for just the right spot for maximum pain relief without disturbing the spinal nerves.\n\nWithin 10 to 20 minutes, you should feel little to no pain from the waist down. You won't be able to walk while the medication is flowing and your legs will feel weak – that is normal. Feeling and mobility will return within an hour or so after the needle is removed.\n\nYour injection site might be sore for a few days after delivery. Fewer than 1 percent of patients develop a severe headache due to leakage of spinal fluid. Some women report feeling itchy or nauseous as the medication wears off.\n\nChoosing your preferred pain relief method for labor and delivery is a personal decision. Whether you plan to have an epidural or decide to update your birth plan during labor, we will be ready to help you manage your pain. At the end of the day, your health and safety – and that of your baby – is the most important part of the birth experience.\n\nTo talk with an Ob/Gyn about labor pain relief options, call 214-645-8300 or request an appointment online."
