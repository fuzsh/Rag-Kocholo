        "text": "The Mt. Diablo Unified School District is pleased to announce that the Governing Board has extended Superintendent Dr. Adam Clark's employment contract for three more years after he received a positive evaluation.\n\nThe Board unanimously approved the new contract on June 26th. It extends from July 1, 2024 - June 30, 2027 and includes a 7% salary increase instead of the 9% raise that District employees are receiving on July 1st.\n\nBoard President Erin McFerrin announced that the Board gave Dr. Clark a positive evaluation during its Closed Session. \"We commend Dr. Clark on his excellent leadership, focus on students, commitment to systems-level lasting improvements and unifying our educators and staff to take action around our equity goals,\" McFerrin said. \"Dr Clark, we’re very grateful to have you here and for your leadership.\" Board Member Cherise Khaund thanked Dr. Clark for his leadership and added, \"we're excited to have you continue on with us.\"\n\nDr. Clark was originally appointed Superintendent of MDUSD effective July 12, 2020 for a three-year term. In 2021, the Board extended his contract through June 30, 2024. Then in 2022, the Board extended it through June 30, 2025. His new contract adds two years to his previous extension.\n\n\"I'm honored to serve the students and staff and community of Mt. Diablo Unified,\" Dr. Clark said. \"I believe that it's been a successful four years so far and I look forward to the years to come.\"\n\nDr. Clark was named as a \"2022 Superintendent to Watch\" by the National School Public Relations Association (NSPRA) and is currently President of the California Association of African American Administrators and Superintendents Association (CAAASA).\n\nHe began his education career in 1994 as an elementary teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified school district. From there, he transitioned to school leadership in Contra Costa County, serving as a middle school vice principal, elementary school principal, middle school principal, and high school principal. He then moved into district office roles, serving as the Assistant Superintendent of Administrative Student Services in the Liberty Union High School District and as the Associate Superintendent of Educational Services in Antioch Unified. Before being appointed to lead Mt. Diablo Unified in 2020, Dr. Clark served as superintendent for three years in the Vallejo City Unified School District.\n\nA year after graduating from Mt. Diablo HS with a prestigious Gates Scholarship and heading to their dream school USC to study math with a goal of becoming a teacher, Solaris Umaña Almaráz is still charting their own path and continuing to advocate for themself and other students who come from low-income, Latinx backgrounds and Title I schools. Known as \"Tori\" when they attended Mt. Diablo HS, Solaris (who goes by the pronouns \"they\" and them\") changed their name at the beginning of their Freshman year. \"I changed my name because I no longer want to be associated with my birth name as I am transgender,\" Solaris said. \"I started going by Solaris/Sol when I started going to USC and told my parents officially at the end of the fall semester.\"\n\nAfter speaking at their own graduation from Mt. Diablo HS in 2023, Solaris said they were very impressed when they attended this year's graduation and heard the Class of 2024 speakers, including their former classmate Josemit Rodriguez, who earned a Gates Scholarship this year and is headed to UC Berkeley. Solaris hopes to meet up with Josemit during the Gates Scholar Conference in Arizona at the end of June, where they will be a \"squad leader\" for the new Gates Scholars such as Josemit.\n\nLike Josemit, Solaris encourages other MDUSD students to consider applying for the Gates Scholarship as well as other scholarship opportunities and to not wait until the last minute to submit college applications. Solaris applied to 19 colleges and universities, including \"reach\" schools, but narrowed down their list by researching and visiting campuses, then weighing their pros and cons based on their own personal preferences and goals. Solaris also highly recommends talking to high school counselors and college and career advisors to ask questions about the application process, scholarship options and ask them to read application essays and give feedback. In addition, Solaris recommends taking AP or dual enrollment classes to earn college credits while in high school, and exploring career pathway options to help figure out what interests you and what you're good at. \"The more college credit you get now, the less actual college you have to do, so there's less debt,\" they said. Solaris is happy that the Gates Scholarship pays for tuition and room and board, but said other expenses must be reimbursed, which means they have to pay out of pocket for some things such as transportation. Time management is a skill Solaris is still working on, but says it really starts in high school. Once you get into college, nobody reminds you about assignment deadlines or test dates. \"Now, you're free, but that means you have to start taking care of yourself more,\" they said, adding that this is especially true if you move away from home because you can't rely on your parents as much as you do when you live with them.\n\nAlthough Solaris has not left the state, they said Southern California still feels far away and they enjoyed becoming more independent, while also having opportunities to come home during breaks, or to invite their parents to visit during Family Weekend. So far, Solaris said they are sticking to their goal of becoming a math teacher, but they are also open to exploring other options, which they said is like being open to trying new things in life, such as foods. \"I'd rather do something I'm good at, but not amazing at, but that I love, than to do something I'm amazing at but I hate,\" Solaris said, adding that it's important to prioritize yourself. Solaris said they are good at math and want to be a teacher to help others who fear it, but they also sometimes struggle and have found that studying with other students and sharing ideas and challenges can help to overcome obstacles.\n\nPersevering through challenges was also a theme at the Mt. Diablo HS graduation, Solaris said, noting that many speakers said that no matter where you come from, you can succeed. Solaris said they were proud of all the graduates, especially since Solaris has experienced negative bias that some people have toward Title I schools such as Mt. Diablo HS. One person, Solaris said, expressed surprise that a Mt. Diablo HS graduate was attending USC, and Solaris said they knew some students in high school who thought they didn't have to try very hard because of low expectations from other people and themselves. \"Even if it's not explicit, racism and classism is still very much a thing,\" Solaris said. \"It's very clear to see why people don't want to talk about these issues because it makes them uncomfortable, but you need to talk about it.\" The Gates Scholarship has brought Solaris together with other students from similar schools who have overcome barriers and are now forging new paths at top universities around the country. Like Josemit, Solaris hopes that more Mt. Diablo HS students will apply for and earn Gates or other scholarships, showing the Mt. Diablo HS community and students who come after them that they can achieve their dreams.\n\nClass of 2024 graduation commencement ceremonies began last month, with the Special Education Bridge Program commencement and the Northgate HS commencement on Wednesday, May 29th followed by the College Park HS commencement on Thursday, May 30th and Concord HS graduation on Friday, May 31st, and the Alternative Education program and Olympic HS graduations on Saturday, June 1st.\n\nThe Bridge Program graduation, which was not live-streamed, took place at the Loma Vista Adult Education Center in Concord.
