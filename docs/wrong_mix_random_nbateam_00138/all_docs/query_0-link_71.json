        "text": "WEST RAMP\n\nEntrance area\n\nT-38 TALON\n\nThe T-38 Talon is a twin-engine, high-altitude, supersonic jet trainer used in a variety of roles because of its design, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, high performance and exceptional safety record. Air Education and Training Command is the primary user of the T-38 for joint specialized undergraduate pilot training. Air Combat Command, Air Force Materiel Command and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration also use the T-38A in various roles.\n\nThe T-38 has swept wings, a streamlined fuselage and tricycle landing gear with a steerable nose wheel. Two independent hydraulic systems power the ailerons, rudder and other flight control surfaces. Critical aircraft components are waist high and can be easily reached by maintenance crews.\n\nT-1A JAYHAWK\n\nThe T-1A Jayhawk is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer used in the advanced phase of specialized undergraduate pilot training for students selected to fly airlift or tanker aircraft. It is also used to support navigator training for the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and international services. The first T-1A was delivered to Reese Air Force Base, Texas, in January 1992, and student training began in 1993.\n\nThe swept-wing T-1A is a military version of the Beech 400A. It has cockpit seating for an instructor and two students and is powered by twin turbofan engines capable of an operating speed of 538 mph. The T-1A differs from its commercial counterpart with structural enhancements that provide for increased bird strike resistance and an additional fuselage fuel tank.\n\nF-16 FIGHTING FALCON \"RED TAIL\"\n\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon is a compact, multi-role fighter aircraft. It is highly maneuverable and has proven itself in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. It provides a relatively low-cost, high-performance weapon system for the United States and allied nations.\n\nThe Red Tail aircraft honors the Tuskegee Airmen who flew P-51 Mustangs with tails painted bright red during World War II under the crest of the 332nd Fighter Group.\n\nThe legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen was born in Montgomery, Alabama, when the Tuskegee Institute’s application to conduct civilian pilot training was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in the fall of 1939. About one year later President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration announced the Army Air Corps would begin training black military pilots, and the place to do it was Tuskegee, Alabama.\n\nIn an air combat role, the F-16's maneuverability and combat radius (distance it can fly to enter air combat, stay, fight and return) exceed that of all potential threat fighter aircraft. It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low flying aircraft in radar ground clutter. In an air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles (860 kilometers), deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point. An all-weather capability allows it to accurately deliver ordnance during non-visual bombing conditions.\n\nBT-13 VALIANT\n\nThe Valiant was the basic trainer most widely used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. It represented the second of the three stages of pilot training -- primary, basic and advanced. Compared with the primary trainers in use at the time, it was considerably more complex. The BT-13 not only had a more powerful engine, it was also faster and heavier. In addition, it required the student pilot to use two-way radio communications with the ground and to operate landing flaps and a two-position variable pitch propeller.\n\nGeneral viewing area\n\nP-51 MUSTANG\n\nThe P-51, also called the Mustang, is a single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft originally designed and produced by North American Aviation for the British Royal Air Force and later adopted by the U.S. Army Air Forces. The P-51 is widely regarded as the finest all-around piston-engine fighter of World War II to be produced in significant numbers.\n\nPossessing excellent range and maneuverability, the P-51 operated primarily as a long-range escort fighter and also as a ground attack fighter-bomber. The Mustang served in nearly every combat zone during WWII, and later fought in the Korean War.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1946, roughly 1,000 African American pilots were trained at a segregated air base in Tuskegee, Alabama. The most famous of the Tuskegee Airmen were the 332nd Fighter Group, also known as the “Red Tails” for the distinctive markings of their planes, including the P-51.\n\nEC145\n\nThe EC145, certified under the name BK117 C-2, is a twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopter of the 3 to 4-ton class with up to 11 seats for pilot/s and passengers.\n\nCJ-6\n\nThe CJ-6 (basic trainer aircraft) is an all-original Chinese design that is commonly mistaken for a Yak-18A. Its predecessor, the Nanchang CJ-5, was a license-built version of the Yak-18. However, advancements in pilot training brought a need for a new aircraft with improved performance and a tricycle landing gear. When the Soviet Union developed the Yak-18A, PLAAF engineers decided that its performance and design would not suit China's needs.\n\nJSX003\n\nThis aircraft is a modified SubSonex Jet, otherwise known as JSX003. The SubSonex is an Experimental Jet that comes as a kit from the Sonex factory in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It weighs 500 lbs., goes up to 300 mph, and it is fully aerobatic.\n\nJELLY BELLY CADET\n\nThe Jelly Belly Cadet is an 800-pound Interstate Cadet with a 37-foot wingspan. The plane’s horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine can generate 90 horsepower and a G-force ranging from -3 to +5.\n\nBE-18\n\nThe Beechcraft Model 18 is a 6–11 seat, twin-engine, low-wing, conventional-gear aircraft that was manufactured by the Beech Aircraft Corporation of Wichita, Kansas. This model saw military service during and after World War II in a number of versions including the United States Army Air Forces C-45 Expeditor, AT-7 Navigator, AT-11 Kansan; and for the United States Navy, UC-45J Navigator and the SNB-1 Kansan. In addition to carrying passengers, the aircraft could also be used for aerial spraying, sterile insect release, fish seeding, aerial firefighting, airborne mail pick up and drop, ambulance service, skydiving, skywriting and banner towing.\n\nT-33 ACEMAKER\n\nThe T-33 Shooting Star (or T-Bird) is an American subsonic jet trainer. It was produced by Lockheed and made its first flight in 1948. The T-33 was developed from the Lockheed P-80/F-80 starting as TP-80C/TF-80C in development, then designated T-33A. It was used by the U.S. Navy initially as TO-2, then TV-2, and after 1962, T-33B.\n\nRH MX2\n\nThe MX2 aerobatic aircraft is an all-carbon fiber, two-place, high-performance aircraft with maneuverability that has never before been available in a two-place aerobatic airplane. The MX2 is a well-mannered aircraft that is both durable and easy to fly. The MX2 offers the capability of being a comfortable two seat, fast cross – country sports plane with a cruising speed in excess of 200 knots and up to 900 miles of range.\n\nSOUTH RAMP (EAST TO WEST)\n\nHC-130\n\nThe HC-130 is an extended-range, search and rescue/combat search and rescue version of the C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft, with two different versions operated by two separate services in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe HC-130H Hercules and HC-130J Super Hercules versions are operated by the United States Coast Guard in a SAR and maritime reconnaissance role. The HC-130P Combat King and HC-130J Combat King II variants are operated by the U.S. Air Force for long-range SAR and CSAR. The USAF variants also execute on scene CSAR command and control, airdrop pararescue forces and equipment, and are also capable of providing aerial refueling to appropriately equipped USAF, US Army, USN, USMC, and NATO/Allied helicopters in flight. In this latter role, they are primarily used to extend the range and endurance of combat search and rescue helicopters.\n\nKC-135 STRATOTANKER\n\nThe KC-135 Stratotanker provides the core aerial refueling capability for the United States Air Force and has excelled in this role for more than 60 years. This unique asset enhances the Air Force's capability to accomplish its primary mission of global reach. It also provides aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and allied nation aircraft. The KC-135 is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations.\n\nFour turbofans, mounted under 35-degree swept wings, power the KC-135 to takeoffs at gross weights of up to 322,500 pounds. A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo. Depending on fuel storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to 83,000 pounds of cargo.\n\nE-3 SENTRY\n\nThe E-3 Sentry is an airborne warning and control system, or AWACS, aircraft with an integrated battle management command and control, or BMC2, surveillance, target detection, and tracking platform. The aircraft provides an accurate, real-time picture of the battlespace to the Joint Air Operations Center. AWACS provides situational awareness of friendly, neutral and hostile activity, command and control of an area of responsibility, battle management of theater forces, all-altitude and all-weather surveillance of the battle space, and early warning of enemy actions during joint, allied, and coalition operations.\n\nThe E-3 Sentry is a modified Boeing 707/320 commercial airframe with a rotating radar dome. The dome is 30 feet (9.1 meters) in diameter, six feet (1.8 meters) thick, and is held 11 feet (3.33 meters) above the fuselage by two struts. It contains a radar subsystem that permits surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water. The radar has a range of more than 250 miles (375.5 kilometers). The radar combined with an identification friend or foe, or IFF, subsystem can look down to detect, identify and track enemy and friendly low-flying aircraft by eliminating ground clutter returns that confuse other radar systems.\n\nC-5M SUPER GALAXY\n\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy is a strategic transport aircraft and is the largest aircraft in the Air Force inventory. Its primary mission is to transport cargo and personnel for the Department of Defense. The C-5M is a modernized version of the legacy C-5 designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin. Currently, the U.S. Air Force owns and operates 52 C-5B/C/M. They are stationed at Dover AFB, Delaware; Travis AFB, California; Lackland AFB, Texas; and Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts.\n\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy is equipped with five sets of landing gear, 28 wheels, four General Electric CF6-80C2-L1F (F-138) commercial engines, and a state-of-the-art maintenance diagnostics system. It can carry oversized cargo over intercontinental ranges and can take off and land on relatively short runways. Both the nose and aft doors open, allowing ground crews to simultaneously load and off-load cargo from both ends, reducing cargo transfer times. The full-width drive-on ramps at each end enable double rows of vehicles to be transported.\n\nThe C-5M, with a cargo load of 281,001 pounds (127,460 kilograms), can fly 2,150 nautical miles, offload, and fly to a second base 500 nautical miles away from the original destination — all without aerial refueling. With aerial refueling, the aircraft's range is limited only by crew endurance.\n\nF-16 VIPER\n\nToday, the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, U.S. Navy, and NASA operate over 2,200 Vipers, in addition to 25 coalition countries. These remarkable aircraft perform virtually every mission set there is; from experimental testing to pilot training and everything in between. The Viper’s versatility, low operating costs, and adaptability have kept it at the forefront of America’s military power.\n\nSince its maiden flight in 1976, the Viper has undergone nearly thirty different modernization upgrades including bigger engines, advanced avionics, precision lethal weapons, and higher fidelity sensors. At its core, the Viper is still one of the most maneuverable aircraft in the world. Its ability to accelerate, turn in a short radius (resulting in loads up to nine times the force of gravity on the aircraft and pilot), and maneuver rapidly to employ weapons is why it has earned the nickname “Viper.”\n\nB-52 STRATOFORTRESS\n\nThe B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions. The bomber is capable of flying at high subsonic speeds at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,166.6 meters). It can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability.\n\nIn a conventional conflict, the B-52 can perform strategic attack, close-air support, air interdiction, offensive counter-air and maritime operations. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces. It is highly effective when used for ocean surveillance, and can assist the U.S. Navy in anti-ship and mine-laying operations. Two B-52s, in two hours, can monitor 140,000 square miles (364,000 square kilometers) of ocean surface. All B-52s can be equipped with two electro-optical viewing sensors, a forward-looking infrared and advanced targeting pods to augment targeting, battle assessment, and flight safety, thus further improving its combat ability.\n\nC-17 GLOBEMASTER III\n\nThe C-17 Globemaster III is the most flexible cargo aircraft to enter the airlift force. The C-17 is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or directly to forward bases in the deployment area. The aircraft can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can transport litters and ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations. The inherent flexibility and performance of the C-17 force improve the ability of the total airlift system to fulfill the worldwide air mobility requirements of the United States.\n\nKC-46A PEGASUS\n\nThe KC-46A is the first phase in recapitalizing the U.S. Air Force's aging tanker fleet. With greater refueling, cargo and aeromedical evacuation capabilities compared to the KC-135, the KC-46A will provide next generation aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and partner-nation receivers.\n\nAt full operational capability, the KC-46A will be able to refuel most fixed-wing, receiver-capable aircraft. The KC-46A is equipped with a refueling boom driven by a fly-by-wire control system, and is capable of fuel offload rates required for large aircraft. Its hose and drogue system adds additional mission capability that is independently operable from the refueling boom system.\n\nAC-130W STINGER II\n\nThe AC-130W Stinger II primary missions are close air support and air interdiction. Close air support missions include troops in contact, convoy escort and point air defense. Air interdiction missions are conducted against preplanned targets or targets of opportunity and include strike coordination and reconnaissance. The AC-130W Stinger II Precision Strike Package modification provides ground forces an expeditionary, persistent direct-fires platform that delivers precision low-yield munitions, ideally suited for close air support and urban operations.\n\nThe aircraft is a highly modified C-130H featuring improved navigation, threat detection, countermeasures and communication suites. All AC-130W aircraft are modified with a precision strike package to perform the gunship mission.\n\nA-10 THUNDERBOLT II\n\nThe A-10C Thunderbolt II is the first Air Force aircraft specially designed for close air support of ground forces. They are simple, effective and survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against light maritime attack aircraft and all ground targets, including tanks and other armored vehicles.\n\nF-22 RAPTOR\n\nThe F-22 Raptor is the Air Force's newest fighter aircraft. Its combination of stealth, supercruise, maneuverability, and integrated avionics, coupled with improved supportability, represents an exponential leap in warfighting capabilities. The Raptor performs both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions allowing full realization of operational concepts vital to the 21st century Air Force.\n\nThe F-22, a critical component of the Global Strike Task Force, is designed to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances and defeat threats attempting to deny access to our nation's Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The F-22 cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft.\n\nF-15 EAGLE\n\nThe F-15 Eagle is an all-weather, extremely maneuverable, tactical fighter designed to permit the Air Force to gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield.\n\nThe Eagle's air superiority is achieved through a mixture of unprecedented maneuverability and acceleration, range, weapons and avionics. It can penetrate enemy defense and outperform and outfight any current enemy aircraft. The F-15 has electronic systems and weaponry to detect, acquire, track and attack enemy aircraft while operating in friendly or enemy-controlled airspace. The weapons and flight control systems are designed so one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat.\n\nF/A-18 SUPER HORNET\n\nThe F/A-18 Hornet became the nation’s first all-weather fighter and attack aircraft, and was designed for traditional strike applications such as interdiction and close air support without compromising its fighter capabilities. The F/A-18 A-D is employed in Marine Corps fighter attack squadrons, U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Reserve squadrons, the Navy Flight Demonstration Team (Blue Angles), and various other fleet support roles.\n\nF-35A LIGHTNING II\n\nThe F-35A is the U.S. Air Force’s latest fifth-generation fighter. It will replace the U.S. Air Force’s aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolt II’s, which have been the primary fighter aircraft for more than 20 years, and bring with it an enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate. With its aerodynamic performance and advanced integrated avionics, the F-35A will provide next-generation stealth, enhanced situational awareness, and reduced vulnerability for the United States and allied nations. The F-35A is an agile, versatile, high-performance, 9g capable multirole fighter that combines stealth, sensor fusion and unprecedented situational awareness.\n\nE-2 HAWKEYE\n\nThe E-2 Hawkeye is the Navy's all-weather, carrier-based tactical battle management airborne early warning, command and control aircraft.

An array of avionics and electronics systems gives the F-15E the capability to fight at low altitude, day or night and in all weather.\n\nThe aircraft uses two crew members, a pilot and a weapon systems officer. Previous models of the F-15 are assigned air-to-air roles; the \"E\" model is a dual-role fighter. It has the capability to fight its way to a target over long ranges, destroy enemy ground positions and fight its way out.\n\nF-15EX\n\nThe F-15EX is a ready-now replacement for the F-15C that includes best-in-class payload, range and speed. Designed to deliver value to the U.S. Air Force, the F-15EX will be a backbone fighter for the service – not just today, but for the next several decades. It includes fly-by-wire flight controls, new weapons stations, new electronic warfare suite, advanced radar and computer, conformal fuel tanks and a strengthened airframe. The improved F-15EX also features a deep magazine that will allow it to carry a load of advanced weapons – yet with a 28 percent larger payload than the F-15E.\n\nT-6A TEXAN II\n\nThe T-6A Texan II is a single-engine, two-seat primary trainer designed to train Joint Primary Pilot Training, or JPPT, students in basic flying skills common to U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots. The T-6A has a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turbo-prop engine that delivers 1,100 horsepower. Because of its excellent thrust-to-weight ratio, the aircraft can perform an initial climb of 3,100 feet (944.8 meters) per minute and can reach 18,000 feet (5,486.4 meters) in less than six minutes.\n\nProduced by Raytheon Aircraft, the T-6A Texan II is a military trainer version of Raytheon's Beech/Pilatus PC-9 Mk II. Stepped-tandem seating in the single cockpit places one crewmember in front of the other, with the student and instructor positions being interchangeable. A pilot may also fly the aircraft alone from the front seat. Pilots enter the T-6A cockpit through a side-opening, one-piece canopy that has demonstrated resistance to bird strikes at speeds up to 270 knots.\n\nMV-22B OSPREY\n\nThe MV-22 Osprey’s mission for the U.S. Marine Corps is the transportation of troops, equipment, and supplies from ships and land bases for combat assault and assault support.\n\nThe MV-22B Osprey is a tiltrotor V/STOL aircraft designed as the medium-lift replacement for the CH-46E Sea Knight assault support helicopter. The Osprey can operate as a helicopter or a turboprop aircraft and offers twice the speed, six times the range, and three times the payload of the CH-46E.\n\nTG-15A\n\nThe TG-15A (Schempp-Hirth Duo Discus) is a conventional two-place high performance sailplane with tandem seating used by 94 FTS Advanced Soaring for cross-country training. The TG-15A is commonly known as \"the white glider\" or the \"Duo\" in the civilian community. Glider cross-country soaring competitions are flown at the regional and national level in the TG-15A. The Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau Aircraft Corporation of Kirchheim, Germany, manufactures the Duo Discus (Air Force designation TG-15A).\n\nBONANZA\n\nThe classic Beechcraft Bonanza was introduced in 1947 and is still built today by Textron Aviation. The four-place aircraft sported all-metal construction and retractable landing gear for the sophisticated or executive pilot. Initially designed with the distinctive butterfly or V tail--a conventional tail model was offered too--it was the basis for later Beech aircraft.\n\nThe Bonanza's performance encouraged a number of people to select it for record-breaking flights. On March 7-8, 1949, William P. Odom set a light-plane, nonstop distance record from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Teterboro, New Jersey, in the Waikiki Beech, the fourth Bonanza built.\n\nRV-7A\n\nThe RV-7/7A is an all-around sport airplane, with excellent cross-country capability, fine aerobatic qualities and superior handling. A typical RV-7 can hold two FAA standard pilots, 100 lbs. of baggage and full tanks: 42 gallons. At the aerobatic gross weight of 1600 lbs., the RV-7/7A complies with the +6/-3G standards of the FAA’s Aerobatic Category and can still carry two people, making it possible for a new pilot to get aerobatic instruction before he or she starts rolling and looping.\n\nCESSNA\n\nThe T-41 Mescalero is a military version of the Cessna 172 that was fitted with a larger engine and variable pitch propeller. The Mescalero has been used by the United States Air Force and Army as well as the armed forces of various other countries as a pilot training aircraft. The Cessna O-2 Skymaster, nicknamed \"Oscar Deuce,\" is a military version of the Cessna 337 Super Skymaster, used for forward air control and psychological operations by the US military between 1967 and 2010.\n\nP-8A POSEIDON\n\nThe P-8A Poseidon (P-8A) is the U.S. Navy's multi-mission maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. The P-8A efficiently conducts anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and humanitarian response. These capabilities are enhanced through secure, interoperable, net-ready systems. While the aircraft is also equipped with high-quality weapon systems, it also has an open architecture to allow for expansion.\n\nC-40B/C\n\nThe C-40 B/C provides safe, comfortable and reliable transportation for U.S. leaders to locations around the world. The C-40B's primary customers are the combatant commanders, and the C-40C customers include members of the Cabinet and Congress. The aircraft also performs other operational support missions. The C-40 B/C is based upon the commercial Boeing 737-700 business jet. The body of the C-40 is identical to that of the Boeing 737-700, but has winglets. Both models have state of the art avionics equipment, integrated GPS and flight management system/electronic flight instrument system and a heads-up display. The aircraft is a variant of the Boeing next generation 737-700, and combines the 737-700 fuselage with the wings and landing gear from the larger and heavier 737-800.\n\nCESSNA JET\n\nAT-37 DRAGONFLY/SUPER TWEET\n\nThe Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, or Super Tweet, is an American light attack aircraft developed from the T-37 Tweet basic trainer in the 1960s and 1970s by Cessna of Wichita, Kansas. The A-37 was introduced during the Vietnam War and remained in peacetime service afterward.\n\nTB-30 EPSILON\n\nThe TB-30 Epsilon is a single-engine basic military trainer aircraft designed and developed by France-based EADS Socata for the French Air Force. It is a tandem two-seater with a metal airframe.\n\nT-33A SHOOTING STAR\n\nThe two-place T-33 jet was designed for training pilots already qualified to fly propeller-driven aircraft. It was developed from the single-seat F-80 fighter by lengthening the fuselage about three feet to accommodate a second cockpit. Originally designated the TF-80C, the T-33 made its first flight in 1948. The RT-33A, a reconnaissance version made primarily for use by foreign countries, had a camera installed in the nose and additional equipment in the rear cockpit. The T-33 is one of the world's best-known aircraft, having served with the air forces of more than 20 different nations over several decades.\n\nA-26 COUNTER INVADER\n\nThe Counter Invader was a highly modified version of the Douglas A-26 Invader, a World War II attack bomber. Redesignated as the B-26 in 1948, the Invader served again during the Korean War (1950-1953), mainly as a night intruder against North Korean supply lines. It was removed from service in 1958, but in 1961 the USAF recalled many Invaders for use as tactical bombers in Southeast Asia. Combat duty and two decades of wear took their toll, and in 1964 the B-26s again were removed from service.\n\nIn 1966, the old bomber was resurrected once more when the improved B-26K Counter Invader returned to Southeast Asia for ground-attack missions along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The B-26K had a rebuilt fuselage and tail, strengthened wings, improved engines, reversible propellers, wing-tip fuel tanks and other refinements. Redesignated as A-26As, Counter Invaders remained in Southeast Asia until 1969 and retired from USAF service.\n\nUH-1N HUEY\n\nThe UH-1N is a light-lift utility helicopter used to support various missions. The primary missions include airlift of emergency security forces, security and surveillance of off-base nuclear weapons convoys, and distinguished visitor airlift. Other uses include: disaster response operations, search and rescue, medical evacuation, airborne cable inspections, support to aircrew survival school, aerial testing, routine missile site support and transport.\n\nThe UH-1N has a crew of three (pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer) and is capable of flight in instrument and nighttime conditions. When configured for passengers, the UH-1N can seat up to 13 people, but actual passenger loads are dependent on fuel loads and atmospheric conditions (may be less). The medical evacuation configuration can accommodate up to six litters. Without seats or litters, the cabin can carry bulky, oversized cargo. Access to the cabin is through two full-sized sliding doors.\n\nHH-60 BLACK HAWK\n\nThe Black Hawk UH/HH-60 is the Army’s utility tactical transport helicopter. It provides air assault, general support, aeromedical evacuation, command and control, and special operations support to combat, stability and support operations. This versatile Black Hawk helicopter has enhanced the Army’s overall mobility due to dramatic improvement in troop and cargo lift capacity. It will serve as the Army’s utility helicopter in the Future Force. There are multiple versions of the UH-60 Black Hawk, including the UH-60M and the UH-60V.\n\nThe UH-60M includes the improved GE-701D engine and provides greater cruising speed, rate of climb and internal load than the UH-60A and UH-60L versions. The Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) version of the UH-60M, the HH-60M, includes an integrated MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package kit, providing day, night and adverse weather emergency evacuation of casualties.\n\nC-47\n\nThe C-47 could carry up to 6,000 pounds of cargo as a supply plane. It could also hold a fully assembled jeep or a 37 mm cannon. As a troop transport, it carried 28 soldiers in combat gear. As a medical airlift plane, the C-47 could accommodate 14 stretcher patients and three nurses. Seven basic versions were built, and the aircraft was given at least 22 designations, including the AC-47D gunship, the EC-47 electronic reconnaissance aircraft, the EC-47Q antiaircraft systems evaluation aircraft and the C-53 Skytrooper. The C-47 featured strengthened floors, bucket seats, large loading doors, and a pair of Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engines of 1,200 horsepower each.\n\nAT-6\n\nThe North American Aviation T-6 Texan was a single-engine advanced trainer aircraft used to train pilots of the U.S. Army Air Forces, U.S. Navy, Royal Air Force and other air forces of the British Commonwealth during World War II and into the 1950s. Designed by North American Aviation, the T-6 is known by a variety of designations depending on the model and operating air force.\n\nThe USAAC and USAAF designated it as the AT-6, the U.S. Navy the SNJ, and British Commonwealth air forces, the Harvard, the name it is best known by outside of the U.S. The North American T-6 Texan was known as “the pilot maker” because of its important role in preparing pilots for combat. Derived from the 1935 North American NA-16 prototype, a cantilever low-wing monoplane, the Texan filled the need for a basic combat trainer during WWII and beyond.\n\nSCORPION\n\nThe Scorpion aircraft is capable of performing air defense, irregular warfare, border patrol, maritime security, disaster relief and counter-drug missions. The aircraft features an all-composite airframe and structure powered by twin turbofan engines. Its fuselage integrates a tandem cockpit, retractable sensor package, internal payload bay and external mounts for precision and non-precision munitions. The corrosion-resistant airframe offers 20,000 hours of service life. It accommodates two pilots in tandem layout, and the cockpits are equipped with advanced multifunction color displays, providing the details of flight characteristics, aircraft operation, navigation and armament data.\n\nP-39 AIRCOBRA\n\nThe P-39 was one of America's first-line pursuit planes in December 1941. It made its initial flight in April 1939 at Wright Field, Ohio, and by the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, nearly 600 had been built. Its unique engine location behind the cockpit caused some pilot concern at first, but experience showed that this was no more of a hazard in a crash landing than with an engine located forward of the cockpit.\n\nThe Airacobra saw combat throughout the world, particularly in the Southwest Pacific, Mediterranean and Russian theaters. Because its engine was not equipped with a supercharger, the P-39 performed best below 17,000 feet altitude.\n\nSNJ-4\n\nThe SNJ-4 is a derivative of a trainer ordered by the U. S. Army in 1935 and designated as the BT-9 (Basic Trainer No. 9). North American Aviation entered the aircraft designed by J. H. \"Dutch\" Kindelberger, J. L. Atwood and H. R. Raynor-in the U.S. Army Basic Training Competition in 1935. The North American entry was ordered into production as the BT-9 and was followed by the BT-9A, B, and C. In 1936, the U. S Navy, under an Army contract, acquired 40 NJ-1s. (The Navy designation was N = trainer, J= North American with the 1 representing the first trainer built for the Navy by North American.) During the Second World War, the aircraft became the advanced trainer for the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force among many other air forces. The Army then designated it the AT-6 Texan (Advanced Trainer No. 6), and the Navy designated it the SNJ with the S standing for \"Scout\" which translates to advanced trainer, while the Royal Air Force designated it the Harvard.\n\nB-25 MITCHELL\n\nThe B-25 is a twin-engine medium bomber with a gull wing mounted at mid-fuselage; twin vertical fins and rudders; tricycle landing gear; powerplants: 2 Wright R-2600-13 radial engines turning three-blade, Hamilton Standard full-feathering propellers, 3.8 meters (12 foot 7 inches) in diameter.\n\nThe origin of the distinctive twin vertical fin and rudder layout on the B-25 remains obscure but may simply have been a designer's whim. Whatever the original intent, it made the Mitchell rock solid and controllable if an engine quit. This occurred frequently in combat. Depending on weight, the airplane could maintain altitude or even climb on a single engine but asymmetrical drag caused the B-25 to yaw into the dead motor. Two fins and rudders increased the pilot's ability to maintain control. Duplicate fins and rudders also added redundancy to a critical flight control (particularly in multi-engine aircraft) should enemy fire disable or destroy either vertical tail unit.\n\nT-34 MENTOR\n\nDuring World War II, the U.S. Navy and Army Air Forces operated common training aircraft, and the practice continued into the 1950s when the sea service and the recently created U.S. Air Force both chose the Beech Model 45 as a primary trainer. The Navy operated the T-34B for over twenty years, accumulating almost 100,000 flight hours per year.\n\nIn April 1975, the Navy ordered an improved version of the aircraft that featured a 400-horsepower Pratt & Whitney PT6A-25 turboprop. Still operational, the aircraft are employed in the first stage of flight training for prospective Naval aviators and also provide aerobatic familiarization for future Naval Flight Officers. In 2002, the Navy began a gradual phasing out of the T-34, replacing it with the T-6A Texan II, a joint primary trainer for use by both the Navy and Air Force. In several variants, the T-34 has been or is now in use by a number of countries, including Argentina, Japan and the Philippines.\n\nP-63 KINGCOBRA\n\nThe P-63 originated from the XP-39E prototype and retained the Bell trademark tricycle landing gear as well as the automobile-type cockpit doors and engine behind the cockpit. The 37mm cannon that fired through the propeller hub was kept as well as the two synchronized .50 caliber machine guns in the nose and two additional .50 caliber guns located in under-wing pods, similar to the P-39Q.\n\nThe P-63A had an internal fuel capacity of 100 gallons and was powered by an Allison V-1710-93 engine. Armament consisted of a 37 mm cannon that fired through the nose spinner, two .50 caliber nose mounted machine guns and two .50 caliber machine guns mounted in underwing pylons. Not all P-63As had nose mounted machine guns. P-63A-1s and -5s could accommodate a 75- or 175-gallon belly drop tank or a 500 lb. bomb beneath the fuselage.\n\nP-51D MUSTANG\n\nThe P-51 Mustang was among the best and most well-known fighters used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Possessing excellent range and maneuverability, the P-51 operated primarily as a long-range escort fighter and also as a ground attack fighter-bomber. The Mustang served in nearly every combat zone during WWII, and later fought in the Korean War.\n\nT-6G TEXAN\n\nThe T-6 Texan, built by North American Aviation, was designed as an advanced trainer. It was intended to be a transition between basic trainers and first-line tactical aircraft. The T-6 was used to train most of the Allied pilots that flew in World War II. It is known by a variety of different names, depending on who operated it. The USAAC called it the 'AT-6', The USN called it the 'SNJ', and the RAF called it the 'Harvard'.\n\nB-29 SUPERFORTRESS\n\nThe Boeing B-29 Superfortress was the most sophisticated propeller-driven bomber of World War II and the first bomber to house its crew in pressurized compartments. Although designed to fight in the European theater, the B-29 found its niche on the other side of the globe. In the Pacific, B-29s delivered a variety of aerial weapons: conventional bombs, incendiary bombs, mines, and two nuclear weapons. On August 6, 1945, a Martin-built B-29-45-MO dropped the first atomic weapon used in combat on Hiroshima, Japan.\n\nA-20 HAVOC\n\nThe U.S. Army operated a number of A-20 bombers as well beginning in mid-1941. The first combat situation they saw, unfortunately, was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in the U.S. Territory of Hawaii where two A-20 bombers were destroyed on the ground at Hickam Field. The American A-20 bombers were nicknamed Havoc following British naming scheme shortly after US entered WW2. The first operation involving A-20 Havoc bombers did not take place until 31 Aug 1942, when several of them engaged in an attack from Port Moresby against Japanese positions further north in Australian Papua on the island of New Guinea. By Sep 1944, 370 A-20 Havoc bombers were in active duty with the Fifth Air Force, most of them based in New Guinea, where they operated both as effective low altitude bombers as well as ground attack aircraft. The aircraft had two Wright R-2600-7 Double Cyclone air-cooled radial engines with turbo superchargers rated at 1,700hp each, 4x7.7mm forward machine guns, 2x2x7.7mm machine guns in an open dorsal position, 1x7.7mm machine gun at ventral tunnel, and 2x7.7mm rear machine guns."
