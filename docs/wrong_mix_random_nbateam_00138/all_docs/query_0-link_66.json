        "text": "If you have ever watched and enjoyed the Phoenix Suns on television, it is no doubt because of Bob Adlhoch.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns hired Bob in 2001 as their TV producer and director. He was later promoted to Executive Producer, overseeing content for, producing and directing Suns game broadcasts on Fox Sports Arizona.\n\nBob has been part of the sports production community in the Valley since 1990. After graduating with honors from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications at Arizona State University with a BA in broadcast journalism, he worked for 5 years as a freelance graphics operator and producer.\n\nBob also worked at Cox Communications producing and directing live sporting events as well as studio programs. He was part of the team behind the channel launch of Cox 9 (now Cox 7) and was instrumental in the live Thursday night high school football broadcasts that have since become a programming staple for Cox.\n\nA past recipient of 20 Rocky Mountain Emmy® Awards for producing, directing and graphic design, Bob was also selected to the Phoenix Business Journal’s Forty Under 40 program in 2009. In 2017 he was inducted into the prestigious Silver Circle Society in the Rocky Mountain Southwest Chapter of The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\n\nBob is a long-time member of both NATAS’ local board of governors and executive committee as well as the chapter’s past-president and national past trustee, has been elected to a two-year term on the National Emmy® Awards Committee, which oversees the Daytime Emmys®, News/Documentary Emmys®, Sports Emmys® and Technology/Engineering Emmys®. In his role, Adlhoch will serve as the voice of NATAS’ regional chapters to the national governing body.\n\nBeing a masterful producer and director of sports for television is what Bob does. Being a devoted husband to Kellie, an amazing father to MacKinley and Jackson, and being an example of a true friend and involved citizen in his community, is who Bob is.\n\nSome people are just naturals. In December 2004, Catherine Anaya was at the KPHO-TV holiday party when a co-worker asked her if she was interested in joining the station’s team to run in the Phoenix Rock n’ Roll half marathon the following month. Catherine had never run more than five miles before and, other than being a high school cheerleader in Costa Mesa, California, she had never participated in an organized sport. But, perhaps as the result of one glass of wine too many, Catherine agreed to join KPHO’s half marathon team. After awaking the next morning to the realization that the race was last than a month away, Catherine bought some running shoes. A few weeks later, she ran the half marathon and enjoyed it. She signed up for the full marathon the following year, and not only enjoyed that, but discovered afterward that her time was only a few minutes shy of qualifying for the Boston Marathon. The following year, Catherine ran her second Rock n’ Roll marathon, and this time she qualified for Boston. On April 16, 2007, Catherine Anaya ran the Boston Marathon. She was 39 years old and had been running for only 27 months. Catherine has since run the Boston Marathon two more times…to date.\n\nWhat sort of person does that? Catherine Anaya does that.\n\nCatherine’s broadcast career has been similarly amazing. After graduating for USC’s Annenberg School, Catherine spent the first few years of her career at KRGV-TV in Weslaco, Texas and at WSB-TV in South Bend, Indiana. She came to Phoenix in 1992 to join KPNX-TV. After six years as an anchor and reporter at KPNX, Catherine went west to join KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. After four years in L.A. as an anchor and reporter, Catherine was lured back to Phoenix in 2003 by KPHO-TV. Catherine spent the next 12 years as one of the KPHO’s evening anchors and during that time was named the “Anchor of the Year” by the Arizona Associated Press Broadcasters Association. She won several Emmy® Awards during that time and conducted many significant interviews, including one with President Barack Obama at the White House in 2014. Catherine also co-anchored with the legendary Walter Cronkite in 2004 after a presidential debate between President George Bush and John Kerry at ASU’s Gammage Auditorium.\n\nSince 2016, Catherine has worked at AZTV, where she is the host of “Arizona Daily Mix.” She is also the host of the weekly radio show, “The Women’s Eye,” on 1480 KPHX.\n\n“Catherine’s professionalism brings a warm glow to any television screen,” says AZTV’s CEO Lynn Londen. “She enhances every subject she interviews, and has her own unique way of bringing out the importance of every topic she covers.”\n\nCatherine is a member of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the current secretary of the Arizona Latino News Media Association Board of Directors and is a graduate of the Valley’s Hispanic Leadership Institute, Class of 2004. She is also a member of the Make-A-Wish Arizona Board of Directors. In 2009, Catherine founded the Sisterhood of Super Women, a group of women from all walks of life that meets for lunch once a month to inspire and motivate each other and select charities for donations. Catherine is also the director of The Lats Legacy Foundation, which raises money for scholarships at the University of Southern California. Catherine is also an active speaker at community and charitable events. In 2017 she was inducted into the Silver Circle in our chapter.\n\nOh, and Catherine is also a killer a spin-cycle instructor.\n\nIn 1979 when a marketing internship during college in Milwaukee at WITI – TV turned into a job offer, Bill Anderson started his journey along an incredible career in the industry. From floor crew to news and production manager to director of promotion and operations and Station Marketing and Operations Manager, Bill learned the full spectrum of television station jobs at WQOW in Eau Claire, KCRG in Cedar Rapids and WGGB in Springfield Massachusetts. These station assignments cemented a career-long appreciation for the importance of ideas and determination over market limitations.\n\nOn the way to becoming a GM, Bill won an Emmy in 1993 when he created Flood Aid: Broadcast Across America for the American Red Cross, a National Telethon with 255 TV stations coast-to-coast agreeing to simulcast this program for the benefit of those ruined by the great Iowa floods that year. In just 11 days Bill enlisted the help of competitors and convinced NBC to lend Willard Scott, ABC to send Spencer Christian and CBS to provide actor-comedian Jay Thomas. Barry Manilow got involved with a song, and the NAB urged all its members to air it. In the end, Flood Aid raised $8.5M in one night and earned the distinction of being both the largest TV network in history but also one of the largest single-event Red Cross fundraisers.\n\nFor Bill personally, Flood Aid provided a glimpse of the power of Local TV to do good, and inspired a desire to become a GM who harnesses the talents of others to do well and to do good with a public license. He soon got his first GM posting in Tallahassee, FL at WTWC-TV and from there to WGME, Portland finally landing at KRQE in Albuquerque in 1999. Since then he has expanded the operation into a four Station “Quad” configuration which includes KRQE (CBS), FOXNM as well as KWBQ and KASY all known as KRQE Media.\n\nBill has always remembered those lessons from early in his career and focused on the community and supporting/encouraging individuals and their talents. His involvement in our region has included roles on the board of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the March of Dimes, United Way Mission Families and he has been named New Mexico Broadcaster GM of the Year. Bill takes a personal interest in helping others and perhaps no better example is when he mentored and then hired a man transitioning back to society after a decade in the New Mexico state prison system. He did the same for a homeless man in the area.\n\nBill’s partner and wife, Debbie have been together 42 years and raised three children and enjoy 5 grandchildren.\n\nGuy Atchley served nearly three decades as anchor of KGUN 9 News in Tucson. As you may know, Guy enjoys photography, and he is going to share pictures and stories from his series: “Guy Atchley’s Arizona.”\n\nSince he graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Radio/Television Speech, Guy has received more than 20 awards for excellence in reporting. During Guy’s tenure, the Associated Press has honored KGUN 9 News with the award for Best Newscast in Southern Arizona seven times. In 1992, Guy swept the Arizona AP awards by winning three first-place honors including: Best Serious Feature, Best Light Feature, and Best General Reporting in the State. Guy also was honored for his reports on living conditions in China in the documentary “China: 1987”. And in October of 1993, Guy traveled to the Middle East for a documentary on Israel’s quest for peace. That documentary, plus Guy’s news reports and speeches to expose intolerance and bigotry, earned him the 1994 Human Relations Award presented by the Jewish Community Relations Council.\n\nBesides reporting from several foreign countries, Guy also has traveled the United States. He has covered space shuttle launches in Florida, racial tension in the South, and immigration policies at the U.S./Mexico border. On Veterans Day in 1994, Guy reported from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. He later returned to Washington to cover the Monica Lewinsky scandal. For more than two decades, Guy has spent each Labor Day as Tucson host for the Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon. Guy counted the comedian as a good friend and mentor. Lewis wrote, “Guy Atchley’s ‘good news’ stories reflect the devotion to his community and to the human community. That makes him a great newsman and a close ally of mine.”\n\nGuy has interviewed many famous people, but it’s the not-so-famous, the unsung heroes of America, that Guy loves to focus on. University of Arizona Basketball Coach, Lute Olson says, “I applaud Guy Atchley for focusing on what is good in our world.”\n\nYou may have seen Guy’s cameos in several movies, “Jericho Fever,” which was produced for the USA Cable Network, the remake of “Vanishing Point” for Fox TV, and the independent film “Runnin at Midnite.” And in case you’re wondering, Guy played the role of a reporter in each film. Guy Atchley retired from KGUN 9 in 2018.\n\nEdward Ayala grew up in a small farming community in the Arizona/Sonora Mexico border. The son of migrant farm workers, Edward learned to till the land and irrigate crops at the age of 10. When his parents became United States Citizens they opened an auto repair shop which would change Edward’s world and career path. At 12, Edward met a photographer from a local television station at that repair shop. What started as a hello ended up with him holding a TV camera on his shoulder and seeing a whole new world through the viewfinder of that camera. This was the beginning of Edward’s storytelling career.\n\nEdward started his career in television at the age of 15 at KYMA in Yuma, Arizona as a part-time production tape operator. He went on to become a Technical Director and Director of the evening newscasts. At age 18 he was promoted to Production Manager leading the Production and Creative Services staff. At the age of 20 Edward moved to Tucson, AZ, working as a Photojournalist at KOLD and Chief Photographer at KGUN. He was recruited to the Phoenix market by KNXV as a Photojournalist then promoted to investigative and special projects. He is currently an Investigative Producer/Photojournalist at KPHO/KTVK.\n\nEdward is a recipient of several Rocky Mountain Southwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Emmy® Awards. As well as multiple Edward R. Murrow awards, and an Alfred I DuPont award.\n\nIn 2016 Edward joined the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University where he is a highly regarded adjunct professor teaching videography and editing. He has taught and mentored hundreds of students who are now working Journalists in newsrooms across the country, including Phoenix.\n\nRoger Ball began his broadcast career at KPHO-TV in 1967. His first job was in promotion and production, and then after a few months became the only person in the newsroom to shoot, write and edit stories. Two years later he joined the staff of KTAR-TV (now KPNX-TV) and for the next eight years worked as a news film reporter/photographer, news production manager, and assignment editor. He then joined the staff of KTVK-TV as Executive Producer/Assistant News Director. Two years later he rejoined KPNX-TV in the newly created position of Managing Editor. Within a year Channel 12’s new owners, Gannett, promoted Ball to a news director position at their station in Indiana. He later served as news director at two different stations in the Midwest and New England.\n\nJust prior to returning to Phoenix in 1993, Ball served as a consultant to new television stations in the emerging republics of the former Soviet Union–most notably in the Republic of Belarus where he helped start a new television station and he set up a nationwide network of independent television stations.

With visions of Fred Astaire gliding through her brain, she signed up for the tap class. It was a very small class, only five students at the outset, she got to know her instructor, a hoofer from Great Britain with some BBC experience, quite well. As it turned out, he was trying to start some classes in Television Production that would be in the Theatre Arts department rather than the Journalism department, and needed bodies to fill the seats for fall semester. He agreed not to interfere with Charlie’s graduate work if hers could be one of the bodies needed. She acquiesced to his proposal, and brought along a few friends during the first semester of the endeavor.\n\nThe classes were enjoyed by all. At the end of the fall semester, the hoofer had procured five unpaid internships for the spring semester: three at the PBS station managed by UNM and two at KGGM TV, the CBS affiliate in Albuquerque. At first, Charlie declined any internship based on the work she had to do in her graduate program, but when one of the people who had accepted a KGGM internship dropped out of the program, and with a renewed promise not to interfere with her graduate work, Charlie took the KGGM internship so that it would not be lost to the hoofer forever. During the term of the internship, Charlie was hired as a master control operator at KGGM, and the rest, as they say,,is history.\n\nCharlie has two enduring reasons to remember the hoofer: shin splints and a long-lived love of all things television.\n\nRon Bergamo was an Arizona native and grew up in Phoenix.

There was also the funeral for President Richard M. Nixon, NBA playoff action between the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns. In addition, Mike was sent to Portland, Oregon for coverage of U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding and the investigation surrounding the attack of figure skater Nancy Kerrigan.\n\nHe also covered the devastating earthquake in Los Angeles, Northridge, I-5 and San Fernando Valley. In the summer 2003, Mike played a key role for the startup of local KMSB-TV’s first news program in Tucson. Still, the stories Mike has covered stretch far and wide, a list of some include: Arizona Diamondbacks World Series games 6 and 7 @ Bank one ballpark downtown Phoenix Arizona 2001. The funeral of Princess Diana from London in September 1997. 1993: NBA playoffs and championship series and many more.\n\nMike has distinguished himself having earned numerous awards such as Edward R.

He attended The University of Denver, 1960-1961. Major: Mass Communications; Radio, Television, Film. His advisor was Noel Jordan. While there, Connor worked for Western Cine Service which he obtained through Student Placement and also worked later at Thomas J. Barbre Productions. He also attended Phoenix College. 1962-1966.\n\nRon started working at KTAR-TV January 19, 1963 as a film processor and editor of news film for the only weekend newscast at 10 P.M. Sunday. It guaranteed 4 hours at minimum wage which was $1.50/hr. Within two weeks he was asked to increase hours and edit news film on Thursdays and Fridays, in addition to shooting news film on those days and on weekends. Soon, Ron was assigned to shoot a documentary on the “new” Phoenix airport addition (now Terminal 2). Commercial work soon followed. Three months later he was assigned to film NBC Personalities in Burbank with the hostess of a local program.\n\nIn September of 1963 Connor was assigned to direct a 90-minute local Spanish language variety program, until the contract ran out in May of 1964. In summer, 1965, he transferred to engineering as an operating engineer. Later that summer, while still working in engineering he was asked by the Production Manager to produce a new opening for the weeknight 10 PM newscast, sponsored by the Valley National Bank (now Chase Bank). It required the earth rotating and matted over time-lapse clouds similar to the Gulf Oil Space Specials of the day. Later, Production wanted him back and he was assigned to a full-time direction position. This schedule altered his hours, so Ron had to “Withdraw Without Prejudice” from Phoenix College, just one class short of graduating lower division which he planned to complete later.\n\nOn a summer day in 1966, Connor was on duty when an NBC news crew from Burbank had covered a local story for the Huntly-Brinkley Report. They needed their facilities to send this report and it required two black and white film chains, two camera cards (artist renderings) and a camera on the reporter. They rehearsed it twice and it eventually ran ‘live.’\n\nThat same summer, Ron was assigned to direct a local teenage program. The following year this program was nominated for the Freedoms Foundation George Washington Citation and the American Legion Auxiliaries’ “Golden Mike” Award. It won both awards for 1966-67 and 1967-68. Two National Awards, two years in a row! No other station in the U.S. had done that before, or since.\n\nC.E. “Pep” Cooney was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa, he learned his sense of community growing up in America’s heartland during the Great Depression. He loved and excelled at sports, particularly in wrestling and baseball, and earned the Eagle Scout badge as a Boy Scout. Pep attended the University of Nebraska at Omaha and the University of Utah, majoring in marketing and advertising, two areas of study that would serve him well during his long, distinguished and successful career in the television industry. His imaginative marketing served him well in another area: he proposed to his wife, Cheri, in a TV commercial. His 44-year professional career began in advertising and program sales, earning him Salesman of the Year honors at 3M Corporation. He joined KRON-TV in San Francisco, eventually becoming general manager and then president of Chronicle Broadcasting. He moved to Phoenix in 1977 as president and general manager of KPNX-TV Channel 12 until 1995. During his tenure, television was taking on an entirely new direction through technology and growing as rapidly as the Valley of the Sun. Pep played a key role in the expansion and reach of both and his legacy remains as strong today as it did when he retired as president of KPNX Broadcasting Co. and senior vice president of Gannett Broadcasting in 1998. Over the years, Pep devoted much of his time and his energies to many civic, business and professional organizations. He served as United Way Campaign Chairman and on the Samaritan Health Service Board of Directors; the KPNX-TV Minority Advisory Board; the NCCJ Board of Directors, which he chaired from 1988-90; the First Amendment Coalition Board of Directors; the Theodore Roosevelt Council of the Boy Scouts of America Executive Board; the Fiesta Bowl Board of Directors, for whom he served as director and president; the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University; Harris Trust Bank and United Blood Services, Inc. Two scholarship funds have been established in his name at Arizona State University, the C.E. Pep Cooney Leadership Scholarship at the Cronkite School and in the College of Public Programs. Pep received numerous awards including Distinguished Citizen from the Phoenix Union High School District; All City’s Honor Convocation; Distinguished Eagle Scout Award; Distinguished Achievement Award by the College of Public Programs at Arizona State University; and the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’rith “Torch of Liberty Award.” He was a member of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Rocky Mountain Southwest Chapter’s Silver Circle Society.

Lin Sue retired from television news to join the executive team Hospice of the Valley. The not-for-profit agency is Arizona’s premier provider of hospice and palliative care. Lin Sue is Director of Community Engagement, overseeing volunteers, fund development, business development, communications and creative services.\n\nAs a journalist, Lin Sue has been honored as the Valley’s “Best Anchor” by the Phoenix chapter of American Women in Radio and Television. She also has won numerous awards for her news reporting and community service efforts including nine Rocky Mountain Emmy® Awards. She was the face of “Buddy Check 12,” a major breast health awareness program, and also served as the principal storyteller on “Hero Central,” a news series focusing on ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\n\nThrough her “encore career” in the corporate world, she hopes to connect the community with the many innovative programs offered by Hospice of the Valley. It’s much more than just “end-of-life care.” Hospice of the Valley provides resources and supportive care for chronic illnesses such as dementia. It is Lin Sue’s sincere hope that every Arizona family knows where to come for comfort, dignity and quality care… as loved ones face the challenges of aging and living gracefully to the end.\n\nLin Sue graduated cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in English and Political Science from Willamette University in Oregon. She holds a master’s degree in journalism from the prestigious Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nShe enjoys helping numerous community causes and charities… and loves being able to spend more time these days, with her husband, four children, and very spoiled standard poodle.\n\nKnown as “El Señor de Los Deportes,” Felipe Corral has been a fixture at Univision Arizona for almost 27 years. During that time, he has covered many of the major sporting events in Arizona and Mexico, including the Super Bowl, the NBA Playoffs, and the World Series. “I strongly believe what makes Felipe Corral, ‘El Señor de Los Deportes’ so well known and loved amongst his viewers, is that he is a simple, kind, generous and humble human being,” says long-time coworker Gina Santiago. “He travels all over the state covering children playing sports, interviewing not only the players, but their coaches and parents.”\n\nBut it is Corral’s work covering young athletes that sets him apart. “Felipe is a true believer that through his microphone he can support and motivate young athletes to keep fighting for their dreams,” says Univision Arizona anchor Heidi Renpenning. “He has used his microphone to motivate hundreds of young athletes. More than 20 years ago, he created the segment called ‘Promesas del Futuro,’ or ‘Future Promises,’ where he interviews young athletes and then follows them through their careers and some of them have made it all the way to the NFL, NBA, the Olympics and other national and international championships.”\n\nOne of those young athletes featured on “Promesas del Futuro” is now nationally ranked Taekwondo fighter Jenny Quezada, who was then a freshman at Arizona State and is currently training to be a part of the 2021 U.S Olympic Team. Former Arizona Cardinals player Rolando Cantú, who is now the Cardinals’ manager of International Business Relations, remembers meeting Corral at training camp with the Cardinals in June 2004. “Felipe is a pioneer for Arizona Spanish broadcast television. While playing for the Arizona Cardinals as a professional player, I began to see opportunities in broadcast communication, watching people like Felipe for when it came time to retire from the NFL in hopes these doors would be open for me.”\n\n“Who doesn’t know Felipe Corral?’ asks Univision anchor Leon Felipe Gonzalez, rhetorically. “Going out with him on the street, he takes the time to greet everyone who recognizes him and asks for a photo or an autograph. He pays the same attention to both a janitor and the owner of an important Arizona sports team.\n\nDr. John Craft is Professor Emeritus at Arizona State University, having taught mass communications and broadcasting at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication for nearly 50 years, including a 12-year stint as Director of Graduate Studies, and was the senior faculty member of the School.\n\nPrior to arriving in Arizona, Craft was a video quality engineer, camera operator, producer, and the Director of Staging and Lighting at station WOUB-TV in Athens, Ohio, the Director of Educational Television and Audio Visual Services for the Hancock County Schools in West Virginia, and the Director of Instructional Television at Ohio University.

His Emmy®-award winning work at KTVK-TV includes producing morning and evening newscasts, both hard hitting and feature stories and long-form specials. Working at Arizona’s top-rated independent station allowed him the freedom to take creative risks and use his skill as a wordsmith to produce Hollywood-style stories and special features.\n\nJay began his career as an intern and although he was first hired full-time as a videotape editor, his sights were set on writing and producing both behind-the-scenes and in front of the camera. As the producer of KTVK’s first ever morning newscast, Jay incorporated many elements which are now standard in morning television, such as the utilization of a weather person as an “out-and-about” reporter and bringing experts in studio as regular guest segments. Soon after, Jay led KTVK’s 5 p.m. newscast to the number one ratings spot. He then moved to special projects where he developed fast-paced celebrity, lifestyle and fashion news stories which not only helped define KTVK’s signature style but inspired colleagues as they moved on to produce nationally syndicated shows such as Extra and TMZ. Jay also developed and produced KTVK’s first and only political talk show, “Politics Unplugged,” which continues to broadcast on 3TV.\n\nAs a special projects producer Jay helped lead the transition to digital editing and crafted elements including the signature show open for Good Evening Arizona and unique segments like “Worth a Listen” featuring up and coming musicians. Jay produced several Emmy® nominated and winning specials including “The Lion King: Behind the Mask,” “Phoenix Rising,” “Granite Mountain Hotshots: Heroes and Heartbreak” and “Rachel’s Challenge.” In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Jay traveled to New Orleans where he produced and reported live on-the-scene and from the set providing residents with valuable information in the wake of that disaster.\n\nCurrently, Jay works as a Public Information Officer for the city of Glendale, Arizona where he continues to enterprise and produce stories for Glendale Media and the city’s social media platforms still seeing himself first and foremost as a journalist bringing viewers information to enrich their lives.\n\n12 News Anchor\n\nName: Mark Curtis\n\nAbout Me: I consider myself very blessed to be living and working in Phoenix.\n\nHometown: Alexandria, Virginia\n\nCity of Residence: Scottsdale\n\nCurrent Position: Weeknight news anchor\n\nYears with 12 News: Altogether, close to 21 years..

Upon leaving the military he worked at a number of radio stations in Ashtabula, Ohio – Battle Creek, Michigan -Erie, PA and in Cleveland, Ohio at WHK and became one of the pioneer radio personalities on WMMS. Rick advanced his career in radio in Michigan in management of several radio stations and part owner of one. After 19 years in radio, Rick decided to try his hand at television, and became a TV Weather caster for NBC and CBS affiliates in Lansing, Michigan. Tired of Midwest winters, in 1987 Rick landed the job as TV Weatherman at KSAZ-TV in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nRick completed his meteorological education from Mississippi State University and was recruited by CBS News as the fill in weatherman on “The CBS Morning News” and “CBS This Morning”. Because of his work on CBS, Rick was promoted to News Anchor at KSAZ in Phoenix. In addition to his anchoring duties, he served as Editor of Business and Economic News, reported live from the Los Angeles riots, interviewed President Ronald Reagan, followed President Bill Clinton to Los Alamos, New Mexico, anchored and reported live from New York City and “Ground Zero” in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. He also followed the Arizona Diamondbacks to Yankee Stadium for the World Series anchoring his morning show from the Fox News Channel.\n\nFor 19 years until his retirement, Rick co-anchored, “Fox-10 Arizona Morning”. Rick also anchored The Fox-10 News at Noon. He had numerous reports on CNN and the Fox News Channel.\n\nHis Emmy® Award winning broadcasting career spanned more than 50 years in radio and television and print.

They have four children, twin boys, two daughters, and a granddaughter.\n\nAt five years-old, Kent Dana won the “Mr. Little Arizona” pageant at the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Phoenix. The year was 1947. It was the first of many appearances for Kent in front of an audience of Arizonans over the next 60 years.\n\nAfter studying at Brigham Young University and Arizona State University, Kent worked at KOOL Radio and TV in 1972. He wrote and delivered news spots on Saturdays and Sundays while managing a gas station. He eventually landed a full-time position as an anchor for KOOL-TV and then moved to Channel 12 in 1979 where he would be the mainstay evening anchor the next 26 years. During that time, Kent covered national political conventions, the Evan Mecham impeachment, wildfires, the Oklahoma City bombing and the O.J. Simpson trial. He was honored with four Emmy® Awards and considers his greatest accomplishment his work with Wednesday’s Child. Kent began the weekly series in 1983, profiling children available for adoption and raising awareness about Arizona’s foster system.\n\nIn 2005, Kent moved to KPHO Channel 5 as the station’s evening anchor for five years. Throughout his career over three decades, Kent’s easy-going personality and good humor could disarm any interviewee and make coworkers feel they had a confidant and friend by their side.\n\nKent was the second of three generations of broadcasters in Arizona. During the 1930’s to 1950’s, Kent’s father Joe Dana was a radio announcer for KOY radio and host of a western variety show on Channel 5. Kent’s son, Joe Dana, is an investigative reporter for 12 News. Kent passed away in December 2022.\n\nRick DeBruhl’s Arizona television career began in 1978 when he arrived at what was then KTAR-TV, Channel 12. His first assignment as weekend sports anchor and weekday news reporter set the tone for the rest of his career: an eclectic mix of everything. During his 31 years at Channel 12 Rick both anchored and reported. His reporter beats ranged from environmental to political to consumer. When Rick arrived at the station, they were still shooting film on CP-16 cameras. When he left, the digital era was in full swing.\n\nRick’s stories took him from the depths of crawling through the Kartchner Caverns to the heights of flying an Air Force fighter jet. He traveled from Europe (covering the ordination of a new bishop), to Korea (telling the story of children who came to Phoenix for heart operations).\n\nMost importantly, Rick was fortunate to work with and learn from an amazing collection of reporters, producers and photographers who passed through the halls of Channel 12. Those collaborations resulted in a wide variety of awards including three Rocky Mountain Emmy® Awards.\n\nRick’s television work wasn’t limited to Phoenix. Both during his time at what became KPNX and after, he spent decades covering auto racing for networks like ESPN, NBC, Speed and Fox including nine years as part of ABC’s Indy 500 broadcast team. His work continues as the voice of the Barrett Jackson Collector Car auctions on the Motor Trend Network.\n\nAfter leaving KPNX, Rick worked as the Chief Communication Officer for the State Bar of Arizona and now has his own communication consulting company.\n\nNew Mexicans have been turning to the Emmy® Award winning Action 7 News Chief Meteorologist Joe Diaz for a full and accurate forecast for almost three decades.\n\nJoe has been part of the Action 7 News team for more than 28 years. He originally worked at Action 7 News from 1979 to 1989, and then returned in 1997.\n\nHe has racked up numerous awards since then, including the New Mexico Broadcasters Association’s “Best Weathercast” in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2015. He also won The Associated Press “Best Weathercast” award in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\nJoe also updates regular weather webcast to our KOAT moble app and KOAT.com.\n\nOne of Joe’s most memorable — and most frightening — moments as a television meteorologist came in 1989 when, while working for a Houston station, he was sent to cover Hurricane Hugo.\n\n“We were broadcasting from Charleston, South Carolina, as this category-4 hurricane came on shore,” Diaz says. “As we took shelter inside the lobby of the Ramada Inn, a wall caved in and destroyed our $50,000 video camera. Fortunately, no one was hurt.”\n\nJoe is a member of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), and is the first in New Mexico (and 68th nationwide) to be named a Certified Broadcast Meteorologist. This prestigious designation is an upgrade of Joe’s previous AMS Seal of Approval.\n\nJoe also holds the seal of approval from the National Weather Association (NWA).\n\nJoe married his wife, an Albuquerque native, in 1981. They have two adult sons and a very spoiled dog.\n\nBiking, running and golfing with his sons are among his favorite ways to spend personal time, along with an occasional triathlon, are among his favorite ways to spend personal time. Some of the more grueling events he has entered include The La Luz Trail Run up Sandia Mountain and a Half-Ironman event.\n\nJennifer Doan is proof of the adage that if you want to get something done, give it to a busy person.\n\nJennifer Doan started her career while in college as a Graphics Operator at KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, where she worked her way up to a Production Assistant. After graduating Magna Cum Laude with a degree in Broadcast Journalism from the University of Oklahoma, Doan moved to Phoenix in 1997 to take a job as a News Management Intern at KPHO-TV. After taking a year off from broadcasting to travel and perform around the world with Up With People, Doan returned to Phoenix in 1999 to join KSAZ FOX 10, where she is now the weekday Morning Show Producer from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n\n“Jennifer can’t sit still,” says co-worker Jeff Moriarty. “It could be blamed on her constant influx of chai tea lattes, but honestly it is rooted in her unwavering desire to help others however she can. She is the kind of person who constantly works to lift others up in both large and small ways. In the often overly competitive world of television, she works to support people and help them advance their careers. In my role as Digital Director, I worked to bring a lot of new ideas into FOX 10, many of which met with resistance by the veteran talent and employees. Not Jennifer. She loves trying new things and reaching out beyond her comfort zone. Television has been going through incredible changes the past few years, and rather than rest on the ‘way we’ve always done it,’ Jennifer incorporates new tools, new ideas, and tells stories in new ways. That energy and creativity was evident in her show, which is what it made it so successful.”\n\n“Jennifer is the heart and soul of Fox 10's Morning Show,” says Moriarty. “She knows everyone in the Valley and can find an expert or a place to expand a story or topic. Give her a blank planning sheet and she can send out 12 texts and fill a two hour show as fast as she can type on her Blackberry. It’s more than just filling time, though. Jennifer loves the people who make up the stories she’s trying to tell.”\n\nIn addition to producing “Arizona Morning” on Fox10, Doan is deeply involved in the community. She serves on the board of directors for Phoenix Sister Cities Commission, VNSA (a Phoenix non-profit that collects used books and holds one sale a year to benefit Arizona nonprofits) and the Reach Out Alumni Assistance Network, which raises thousands of dollars every year to help Up With People alumni across the globe who have found themselves in difficult situations.\n\nFor the past nine years, Doan has served on the Board of Governors for the National Association of Television Arts Sciences - Rocky Mountain Southwest Chapter. She is the current secretary and its former Second Vice President and Chairperson/Producer of its annual, regional Emmy® Awards gala.\n\nI have always had a powerful interest in gathering information, both in my formal education and in the informal education we all experience as we go through life. I think that it has been my greatest gift. And that’s why I started My Healthcare Report. The interest in information fueled my career in the media, then with the Arizona Medical Board as the Media Relations Officer, and now at GlobalMed and the field of telemedicine. And before that with NBC News and KPHO-TV in Phoenix, the CBS affiliate. It helps that I am able to communicate what I have learned with my voice and writing skills.\n\nHaving spent more than 30 years on a radio mike or in front of a TV camera, I was placed in situations where quick-thinking was essential, but that’s only half the skill needed. You also have to be able to take the information you know and express it in a meaningful and understandable way. In the business, they call it broadcast writing. Read enough news stories on the air and you get very good at storytelling and identifying REAL news.\n\nDeborah Sedillo Dugan has spent 35 years as an award-winning television journalist and communications professional in Washington, D.C. and most recently, the Rocky Mountain region.\n\nShe has written, produced and reported extensively on hundreds of community issues, such as homelessness, domestic violence, and missing children.

She is proud of her two adult daughters, Christina a staff writer/reporter for People Magazine and Lauren, a student in health and wellness. Finally, she has been married for 31 years to her college sweetheart Doug Dugan, a former professional soccer player.\n\nBob was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He served in the U.S. Army. When he was discharged, he visited family in Phoenix and ended up staying to attended Arizona State College (now ASU). He graduated in 1953, with a degree in Speech.

He distinguished himself there by quickly rising to assistant chief photographer, and was soon hired away by the crosstown competition, WEEK-TV. While at WEEK, Tom continued to sharpen his skills, and won the Illinois Valley Press Club’s Best Photographer award.\n\nUnlike his nine siblings, Tom couldn’t WAIT to get out of the midwestern cold, and, on a bleak January day in 1987, packed his un-air-conditioned Ford EXP with everything he owned, and set out from Central Illinois on the Mother Road, for he was the newest hire at KTSP-TV in Phoenix.\n\nIt proved to be a good fit.\n\nDuring Tom’s more than 30 years at the station, he’s seen the name change from KTSP to KSAZ, the affiliation from CBS to FOX, and the gear from 3/4” videotape to today’s digital rigs.\n\nHis enthusiasm for the job has never waned, and his ability to quickly embrace every new industry twist has garnered him multiple Rocky Mountain Emmy® Awards, and two National Association of programming Executives IRIS Awards. Tom has freelanced for ESPN, FOX Sports, and CNN, and has logged thousands of miles in SkyFox and its predecessors, covering every corner of Arizona.\n\nTom has Super Bowls, the World Series, and the NBA Finals under his belt, and, for many years, he’s been answering the early bell on FOX10 Arizona Morning. In fact, he’s now as likely to be seen in front of the camera as behind it, as his solid on-air reporting skills are often put into play on the show.\n\nHe and his wife Linda have three grown children— Denton, Collin, and Mary, as well as one dog that Tom enjoys, and another that’s a pain in the neck.\n\nAmong the most rewarding aspects of Tom’s outstanding career might be his long tenure as a Faculty Associate in The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications at Arizona State University, where he began teaching basic videography, and now delivers a self-created sports-videography course.\n\nTom is beginning his eleventh year at ASU and has been recognized by the University as Outstanding Faculty Associate.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments, Tom can now count hundreds of working, enthusiastic videographers, reporters, and producers, spread out all over the world.\n\nTom’s reach is much longer, and his influence much stronger than he could have dreamed while sitting under Wayne Weber’s teaching at Illinois State.\n\nFor this reason, among many, we celebrate the induction of Tom Fergus into the Silver Circle.\n\nBud was born in Lafayette, Indiana.

I’ve been lucky enough to do special reporting and documentary production all over the world. I have seen some incredible images in some very remote places on this lovely planet. But I think I am best known for the scenic shots and scenes of this beautiful state in which I was born. I am a fourth generation Arizonan. And I love this place with both my heart and my eyes.”\n\nHis father was a sheepherder for a good part of his life. He grew up listening to his stories of old Arizona. Manny’s mom came to Phoenix in 1929 and quickly became a historical part of this community by joining a dance troupe in the then “new” Orpheum Theatre. He is married to his wife, Irene, has three grown children, Anne, Christie and Jon, along with several grandchildren.\n\nGarcia is a Rocky Mountain Emmy®, Peabody and Gabriel Award recipient and has more than 20 press association awards.
