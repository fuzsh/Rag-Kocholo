The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:34 a.m., in room 2141, Rayburn Office Building, the Honorable Spencer Bachus (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Bachus, Goodlatte, Farenthold, Issa, Marino, Holding, Collins, Smith of Missouri, Johnson, Conyers, DelBene, Garcia, Jeffries, and Cicilline. Also Present: Representatives Gohmert and Jackson Lee. Staff present: (Majority) Anthony Grossi, Counsel; Ashley Lewis, Clerk; Ellen Dargie, Legislative Assistant for Rep. Issa; Jaclyn Louis, Legislative Director for Rep. Marino; Jon Nabavi, Legislative Director for Rep. Holding; Justin Sok, Legislative Assistant for Rep. Smith of Missouri; and (Minority) James Park, Counsel. Mr. Bachus. Good morning. The Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law herein will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time. However, I do not think we anticipate a recess unless it goes fairly long, and then we will have one for everyone's convenience. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Today's hearing is on the proposed merger between Comcast Corporation and Time Warner Cable. The purpose of the hearing is not to determine ultimately whether the merger should proceed as proposed, be modified, or denied. That responsibility lies with the other branches of the Federal Government, and, most particularly, involves the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. Rather, we are here to provide a public forum in which to discuss the potential benefits and harms to the American consumer and to competition that could result from a merger between the country's two largest cable companies. In doing so, the Committee will perform an important function for the public that is historically provided pursuant to its antitrust jurisdiction. The transparency of the companies in an open hearing serves a vital role in any evaluation of a proposed merger's potential impact on consumers. One of the issues in the public examination of the proposed merger is how the size of the combined companies will impact competition and choice in the voice, video, and broadband markets. As separate entities, Comcast and Time Warner now respectively reach most of the country, although they do not really compete directly against each other in individual markets. If the companies were to combine, the joint venture would be the largest pay television provider in 37 of the top 40 viewing markets, serve nearly a third of all TV audiences, and provide Internet service to nearly 40 percent of all broadband customers. Size alone does not necessarily do harm to competition. In fact, large companies use their resources every day to invest in emerging technologies and achieve efficiencies in scale. In its filing with FCC, which is available for public review, Comcast stated that it would deploy capital to enhance broadband speed, expand the diversity of its programming content, and increase the avenues over which consumers can access content. Size, however, can in some cases result in the ability to influence markets in any competitive manner. There have been cases in our country's economic history of companies which have used their achieved dominance to exercise monopolistic powers. Various parties have raised concerns about the potentially negative competitive implications of this merger, and we will hear from some of them today. The purpose of my statement is not to fully lay out all the pros and cons of this proposed merger. That is what the hearing is for, to allow our witnesses to advocate. Let me conclude by saying this. There are those who remember when you could count the number of television channels you could choose on your fingers, and the number depended on the strength of your antenna. And you might recall struggling with the rabbit ears to try to improve the picture quality. We are long past that. If there is any industry in America that has had a revolution in the past 20 years, is the cable and video business, telecommunications business, in a broader sense. We have gone from only over-the-air broadcast television to cable and satellite, and now to mobile and Internet streaming. Consumers have multiple choices. In fact, there are some people who are only getting their content from their Internet, and there are some services and channels only available online. The structure and economics of the industry continue to rapidly change. So the challenge for policymakers and antitrust regulators is to determine how the consumer's interest is best served in this evolving and exciting environment. Today's hearing will give our witnesses an opportunity to share their perspectives and experiences to face each other and answer the questions of Members of the Committee. It will aid the public record that American consumers will be able to review, and help the Committee as we continue in our ongoing oversight of the antitrust laws and their application by the antitrust enforcement agencies. With that, I look forward to the testimony of our panel, of the esteemed witnesses, and turn to my Ranking Member, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, for his opening statement. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to take a moment to thank both you and Chairman Goodlatte for your bipartisan approach to today's hearing. This discussion today on the proposed Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger is a fresh opportunity for this Committee to continue its long history of promoting a dynamic, competitive marketplace and protecting the public interest through strong antitrust oversight. The twin objectives of antitrust law are to promote competition in markets and to protect the public interest. The twin objectives are very important. Comcast does not compete directly with Time Warner Cable for broadband or video subscribers. There is also scant evidence that this merger will substantially increase Comcast's concentration in any single market. And due to the extremely costly process of building out networks within a competitor's territory, there is little to suggest that either company had planned to compete directly in any local market. However, it is plainly clear that the proposed merger occurs at a time of immense disruption in the broadband and video marketplace. Through explosive growth of edge providers, like Netflix and Amazon, consumers have more video options. More than ever, these companies' recent success in original programming also suggests that competition between online video distribution and linear television will continue to grow and benefit consumers through increased choice and quality in video programming is implicated, and I believe that it will offer more choice and more quality. Though still in its infancy, the broadband marketplace is also undergoing a period of staggering disruption. In 2013 alone, the fiber broadband marketplace grew 29 percent to 126.6 million subscribers globally, according to ABI Research. And according to findings earlier this week by Sanford Bernstein, an equities research firm, Google Fiber's early success in the Kansas City market demonstrates that their fiber service could scale into 30 million homes over the next several years. I am encouraged by the prospect of this expansion, especially considering Google's announcement earlier this year that it plans to roll out service in Atlanta and parts of Georgia's 4th Congressional District, as well as over 30 other cities. Combined with similar services from AT&T and Verizon, the roll out of all fiber networks across the country promises more and better options for consumers online. It is my strong belief that technology is one of the most important tools for empowering all levels of society. We must keep an eye to protect future innovation within this marketplace, but also keep in mind the disruption already occurring in the video and broadband marketplace. I therefore encourage the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission to keep this in mind as it considers the effects of the merger upon competition in the video and broadband marketplace. Before I yield back to the Chairman, I would note that earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner is already having a ripple effect in the video and broadband marketplace. Many companies are already looking for new ways to compete for customers. It is my hope that the groundwork that we lay in today's hearing will serve as a strong foundation for future hearings on competition in the communications, video, and broadband marketplace. And with that, I yield back. Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I would now like to recognize the full Committee Chairman--our Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Administrative Law is a Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. And at this time, I recognize Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee for his opening statement. Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The cable television industry and the Internet have become about as American as baseball and apple pie. We watch the events of our Nation, cheer on our teams, follow our favorite characters, and, on occasion, glimpse history changing before our eyes on television. The Internet is used to connect family and friends, doctors to patients, teachers to students. Cable and the Internet are portals from our homes and offices to the world and are vital components of our national economy. Today the House Judiciary Committee will provide a public platform to discuss the proposed combination of Comcast Corporation and Time Warner Cable, which together provide cable and Internet services to a third of Americans. Given the importance of these services to our constituents and the economy, the transparency afforded and the record created by this proceeding is integral to the overall consideration of the merger. As we discuss the proposed merger, we should be mindful of the ever-evolving nature of the relevant industries. The rapid technological developments that have taken place over the last 10, 20, and 30 years in the cable and broadband markets have been remarkable and unpredictable. We have seen the growth of cable from a nascent industry that just covered a fraction of the population and only offered a few dozen channels to one that reaches nearly every home in the country and delivers hundreds of channels, now even in 3-D, in addition to providing voice and Internet services. Gone are the days of rushing to the living room to watch the news, sports, or a favorite show when it starts at 7:00, or 8:00, or 9 p.m. Now, consumers can watch content when they want it nearly wherever they would like. These improvements have not come without a cost. Cable bills have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation annually over the last 17 years, including a nearly 6 percent rise just this last year. Consumers, who have grown tired of rising cable bills, have begun cutting the cord and are looking to new, emerging ways to receive content. That is how the free market is supposed to operate. When costs rise, competitors emerge, and as they do, consumers have greater choices. Today's hearing will examine whether the proposed Comcast and Time Warner merger would impact competition in the cable and broadband markets and explore whether consumers would benefit from the combined scale of the joint venture. Proponents of the merger argue that it would spur innovation, increase choices, and improve service. Critics of the merger raise concerns regarding the influence of a post-merger Comcast might yield over key aspects of the cable and broadband markets. We will hear the views of both sides of this debate today and allow the panelists to test each other's theories of the future of the industry. I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses on this important issue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Chairman Goodlatte. I would now like to recognize the full Committee Ranking Member, my friend, Mr. John Conyers of Michigan, for his opening statement. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Chairman Bachus. And to eight witnesses, when was the last time we had--well, we ran out of tables. I am sorry, we have only eight here today. We consider the proposed acquisition of these two corporations, and if consummated it would enable the combined entity to control approximately 30 percent of the national cable market and at least 40 percent of the high speed broadband Internet market. It would also dominate 19 of the 20 largest geographic markets in the Nation, including the New York and Los Angeles areas where Comcast currently is not present. Currently, Comcast, in addition to its cable and Internet businesses, owns the NBC Television Network, 10 NBC-owned and operated local television stations, the Telemundo Spanish language broadcast network, nine cable networks, regional sports and news networks, and nine major metropolitan areas, and the motion picture studio, Universal. So not surprisingly, the sheer size and scope of the proposed merger, which would extend well beyond cable television, has raised concerns. Several consumer groups, including Public Knowledge, Free Press, the American Antitrust Institute, and Consumers Union have raised concerns about the proposed merger. And I ask unanimous consent, Chairman Baucus, to offer a letter from Consumers Union dated May 7, 2014 for the record. Mr. Bachus. Without objection. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Conyers. Thank you. While neither we nor the competition enforcement agencies should pre-judge any deal, there are a number of issues concerning competition and consumer welfare that I would like as many on the panel to address as possible. To begin with, witnesses should address whether the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable would have such market power that it could discriminate against rival content providers, because, according to critics, the merged company would have the ability and incentive to discriminate in favor of Comcast/Time Warner content, including NBC content. And given that the merged entity would have almost 30 million subscribers, being unable to distribute on Comcast's video distribution network could potentially be fatal to non- Comcast affiliated programmers. Ultimately, this could give the merged entity enormous sway over the kind of content that is available to the public. The witnesses should also address whether the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable could emerge as a gatekeeper of the Internet, and thereby be able to stifle competitive innovation as some critics have already alleged. Recently, Netflix, an online video distributor, signed an agreement with Comcast that would allow Netflix to directly access Comcast customers rather than paying companies to carry traffic between its service and Comcast customers. On the one hand, this could be seen as a simple, straightforward business transaction. After all, Netflix is responsible for a third of all United States web traffic. Paying Comcast to connect directly to its pipes instead of sending traffic through other companies, which are struggling to handle its traffic, may simply have been categorized as a smart business decision. But on the other hand, Netflix itself raises concerns about its agreement with Comcast, asserting that it was forced to pay Comcast for reliable delivery to Comcast customers. In opposition to the Comcast/Time Warner merger, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells argued that the Internet faces a long-term threat from the largest ISPs driving up profits for themselves and costs for everyone else, and that is if the Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined entity would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers. The real question, however, is not what effect the merger may have on Netflix per se, but on the next Netflix that might emerge as an alternative to Comcast video distribution business. Would a combined entity be able to use its potential leverage over high speed Internet access to stifle potential competition in this way? So finally I conclude on this point. To the extent that there may be competition concerns, I would like the witnesses that choose to discuss whether imposing behavioral remedies would be sufficient. As a condition for approval of the Comcast/NBCUniversal transaction, the FCC and the Justice Department required Comcast/NBCU to take affirmative steps to foster competition, including voluntary compliance with net neutrality protections as well as steps to benefit the public interests. Comcast has indicated that it will extend the same commitments to its proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Additionally, Comcast has entered into an agreement with Charter Communications to sell 1.4 million subscribers and divest another 2.9 million subscribers to form a new rival cable company. Nevertheless, some observers are concerned that behavioral remedies imposed in the Comcast/NBCU transaction were ineffective and unenforceable to the extent Comcast did not abide by them. And accordingly, we should consider whether such commitments should be strengthened and made enforceable to better protect the public interest with respect to Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable. I look forward to your testimony, and I thank the Chairman, and yield back my time. Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Conyers. At this time I recognize the Vice-Chairman of the Subcommittee, Mr. Farenthold of Texas, for his opening statement. Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I will be brief. As a free market conservative, I am on the record as stating that I do not think government should interfere in business mergers to the extent they do not violate antitrust laws. And I generally support this merger and do not think it should be destroyed by excessive government intervention. However, there are some concerns that I am hoping will get cleared up during this hearing, the primary one being the impact this merger will have on how programmers, particularly independent and small programmers, are able to compete in the marketplace and gain access. We have also got issues developing about new ways to distribute video content that may make this moot, but they are probably 10 years out. You have got video on demand delivery by companies like Google, Amazon, Verizon, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple. Obviously there is a potential concern that these compete with video on demand services actually native to the cable providers. I am also concerned, again, as I said, about new companies and new programmers having access to getting on. I am concerned also about the percentage of the Hispanic and Spanish-language market that this merger would have in the overall national pricing. Even though Time Warner and Comcast do not compete in any markets to speak of, there is an overall national accepted pricing as there are more players in the Internet delivery game, in particular, what people expect to pay on a national basis is set by that. And with 30 percent of the market, there are also concerns over data caps that Time Warner does not have. Now, that being said, I am blessed in Corpus Christie, Texas by living in a community that is served by two competing cable providers. The capital cost of that is high, but as we are seeing by investments in fiber by Verizon, Google, and other companies, multiple options are becoming available. It is the short-term that I am worried about. And I do hope that some of the witnesses will address short-term versus long-term competition and availability of programs. And finally, I do think we ought to talk a little bit to distinguish about what is delivered in real time and what is important to be delivered in real time, for instance, news and sporting events as opposed to entertainment content, which is shifting more and more to an on-demand or a pay-per-view model for delivery, be that through DVRs or services like Netflix or iTunes Store and the like. I have been looking forward to this hearing for a long time, and hope we can get it all cleared up. Thank you. Mr. Bachus. Thank you. We have a very distinguished panel today, and Mr. Conyers made a remark about the table being so long. And this was an attempt to balance the witnesses, and when we add a witness, you have to balance them on the other end. I hope that balance is fine. Our first witness is Mr. David Cohen, executive vice president of Comcast Corporation, where he has responsibilities that include corporate communications, government and regulatory, public and legal affairs, and community investment. I guess, in other words, everything. Prior to joining Comcast in 2002, Mr. Cohen served as a partner and a chairman of Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, one of the 100 largest law firms in the country. Prior to his time at Ballard, Mr. Cohen served as the chief of staff to the Honorable Ed Rendell, mayor of Philadelphia. Mr. Cohen received his B.A. from Swarthmore College and his J.D. summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Welcome, Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bachus. I am going to actually introduce all the witnesses, and I should have told the panel that. Mr. Cohen. Okay. Mr. Bachus. And then we will go back. Mr. Cohen. Sorry. Mr. Bachus. Our second witness is Mr. Robert Marcus, chairman and CEO of Time Warner Cable. Mr. Marcus is, as I said, chairman and CEO, and he has served in that capacity since January 1st of this year. Mr. Marcus first joined Time Warner in 2005, and since that time he has served the company in various capacities, including president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and senior executive vice president. Prior to joining Time Warner Cable, he held various positions at Time Warner, Inc., including senior vice president of mergers and acquisitions. Before joining Time Warner, Mr. Marcus practiced law at Paul, Weiss. Mr. Marcus received his B.A. magna cum laude from Brown University and his J.D. from Columbia Law School, where he was a Harlan Fiske Stone scholar and editor of the Columbia Law Review. We welcome you, Mr. Marcus. Our next witness, Mr. Matthew Polka, is president and CEO of the American Cable Association, an 850-member non-profit association, whose members serve nearly 7 million cable television subscribers, primarily in small, rural markets. Prior to joining the association, Mr. Polka was the vice president and general counsel of Pittsburgh-based Star Cable Associates. Mr. Polka graduated from West Virginia University magna cum laude, and received his J.D. from Pittsburgh University School of Law where he was editor of the law school news magazine and recipient of the law school's Most Distinguished Graduate Award. Welcome to you, Mr. Polka. Our next witness, Professor Scott Hemphill of Columbia Law School, is a law professor at Columbia, as I said, where his research examines the balance between innovation and competition set by antitrust law, intellectual property, and other forms of regulation. From 2011 to 2012, Professor Hemphill served as chief of the Antitrust Bureau in the Office of the New York State Attorney General. Before joining Columbia's faculty, he served as a law clerk for Judge Richard Posner on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, and to Justice Scalia on the United States Supreme Court. Professor Hemphill is a graduate of Harvard College and the London School of Economics, where he studied as a Fulbright Scholar. He received his J.D. and Ph.D. from Stanford University. So we welcome you, Professor. Our next witness is Mr. Allen Grunes, antitrust lawyer at the law firm of GeyerGorey. Mr. Grunes advised on mergers and acquisitions, provides counsel on non-merger matters, and represents clients before the courts, antitrust agencies, and Congress. Prior to joining the law firm, Mr. Grunes spent more than a decade at the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division where he led many merger and civil non-merger investigations in a number of industries, including radio, television, newspapers, and motion pictures. Mr. Grunes received his B.A. from Dartmouth College and received his J.D. from Rutgers Camden School of Law, and holds an L.L.M. from New York University. Our next witness is Mr. Patrick Gottsch. He is founder and chairman of Rural Media Group, Inc., the world's leading provider of multimedia content dedicated to a rural and western lifestyle. In fact, he does not wear a tie, and his representative asked me if he should wear a tie. And I told him that we wanted him in his natural state. [Laughter.] And so, if you are saying he does not have a tie on, it is the prerogative of the Chairman and of Mr. Gottsch. Mr. Gottsch. Thank you. Mr. Bachus. Rural Media Group is the parent company of a number of multimedia companies, including RFD-TV, the Nation's first 24-hour television network dedicated to serving the needs and interests of rural America. Before launching Rural Media Group, Mr. Gottsch served as director of sales for Superior Livestock Auction, the largest livestock auction enterprise in the United States. Prior to joining Superior Livestock, Mr. Gottsch started ET Installations in Nebraska, which introduced over 2,000 satellites to the Midwest, and was recognized as the Nation's largest privately-owned home satellite retailer in 1987. Before ET Installations, Mr. Gottsch worked on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a commodities broker. Mr. Gottsch graduated from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. We welcome you, Mr. Gottsch. Mr. Gottsch. Thank you. Mr. Bachus. Our next witness is Mr. David Schaeffer. Mr. Schaeffer is founder and CEO of Cogent Communications, one of the world's largest Internet providers. Prior to joining Cogent, Mr. Schaeffer successfully funded and operated six other businesses spanning a wide array of industries, from communications to commercial real estate. Mr. Schaeffer's diverse background and business successes have enabled him to build management teams that construct and operate the only facilities-based non-oversubscribed multi-national network of its kind. Mr. Schaeffer received a B.S. in physics from the University of Maryland where he was also a Ph.D. candidate in economics. Mr. Schaeffer, we welcome you. Our final witness is Dr. Craig Labovitz. Is that right? Mr. Labovitz. It is. Mr. Bachus. All right. He is co-founder of DeepField Networks. He founded that in 2011 and serves as its CEO and president. Dr. Labovitz is a widely recognized expert on Internet infrastructure, security, and cyber threats. Prior to founding DeepField, he served as chief scientist for Arbor Networks based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His research and work is used by over 400 Internet service providers, and more than 70 percent of the Internet backbone transit traffic is protected by products stemming from his research. Dr. Labovitz also served as one of the original engineers for the NSF Net Backbone, which is where the Internet as we know it today originated. And that was one of the six universities or what was that---- Mr. Labovitz. It was. Mr. Bachus. All right. Dr. Labovitz received his master's of science of engineering and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and his bachelor of science in engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. So we welcome you as our final witness. And at this time, Mr. Cohen, we welcome your testimony. And let me say this. Each of the witnesses' written testimony will be entered into the record in its entirety. And I ask that each of you try to summarize your testimony in 5 minutes. There will be some lights to guide you, but there is no electrical shock if you go past that time. [Laughter.] So do not take that as a traffic light red. Mr. Cohen? TESTIMONY OF DAVID L. COHEN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, COMCAST CORPORATION Mr. Cohen. We will try this again, and thank you, Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Baucus, Ranking Members Conyers and Johnson, and Subcommittee Members. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss the substantial consumer and public interest benefits that will arise from our merger with Time Warner Cable. Over the last 50 years, Comcast has grown from a small cable operator with 1,200 customers in Tupelo, Mississippi into one of the most innovative media and technology companies in America. We are truly an American success story. In a nutshell, this transaction will give us the scale to invest more in innovation and infrastructure so we can compete more effectively with our mostly larger national and global competitors, including the Bells, DirecTV, DISH, Apple, and Google to name a few as were referenced in some of your opening statements. And when we invest, so do our competitors. AT&T, for instance, has said that this transaction puts a heightened sense of urgency on competitors to invest more in their networks and improve service. And the ultimate beneficiary of this enhanced competition and greater investment is the American consumer. Specifically, Comcast will bring Time Warner Cable residential customers faster Internet speeds, more programming choices, more robust Wi-Fi, and our best in class X1 operating system. And business customers will benefit as well. We will also expand our acclaimed Internet essentials program, which has already connected over 1.2 million low income Americans to the Internet more than any program of its kind in the Nation. And we will extend many other public interest benefits from the NBCUniversal transaction to the Time Warner Cable footprint, including our commitments to diversity and to an open Internet. More investment, faster speeds, better technology, more Americans connected. Even with these compelling benefits, we recognize that questions arise whenever two big companies combine. Let me address some of them very briefly. Americans are benefitting today from robust competition. 97 percent of the homes in America are in census tracts where at least three competitors offer fixed or mobile broadband Internet services. And almost 99 percent of American homes have access to at least three multi-channel video providers. Objectively, this transaction is very straightforward from an antitrust perspective. As Ranking Member Johnson said, our two companies do not compete for customers anywhere. It is a fact that every customer will have the same choices among broadband and video providers after this transaction as before. Nor will Comcast gain undue power over programmers. Last week, we announced a transaction with Charter to divest almost 4 million customers, thereby reducing the number of our customers to approximately 29 million, below a 30 percent share of multi- channel video subscribers. Some history here. The FCC has twice concluded that a 30 percent ownership cap was justified to prevent a single cable operator from wielding undue control over programmers. But the Federal courts twice rejected that cap saying that no cable operator could exercise market power at 30 percent. Nevertheless, we will remain below that level, which, by the way, is essentially the same share of the market we had after our AT&T Broadband and Adelphia transactions in the first decade of the 21st century. Comcast is a company that keeps its promises and plays fair. Since our NBCUniversal transaction, we have successfully negotiated dozens of agreements with MVPDs for carriage of NBCUniversal content without any withholding of content from consumers, and no arbitrations have been needed under the MVPD provisions of the NBCUniversal order. We also play fair in the exchange of Internet traffic, or what is sometimes called interconnection. This market is distinct from the ISP market, and the two markets should not be analytically conflated as some will try to do. For 20 years, we have successfully negotiated very common business arrangements with thousands of companies that connect to our network, including direct connection agreements with content providers, such as Netflix. Other ISPs do the exact same thing. The interconnection market is fiercely competitive with dozens of substantial players, evidenced by the fact that prices have plummeted in that market by 99 percent over the last 15 years. Nothing in this transaction will affect the competitiveness of that market. Comcast wants to bring more investment and technology and new services to more American homes and businesses. In doing so, we will incentivize our competitors to invest more, which will benefit still more consumers. We have a track record as a fair competitor and as a company that over delivers on its promises. Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear here today. ---------- Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. And at this time, Mr. Marcus, you are recognized. TESTIMONY OF ROBERT D. MARCUS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, TIME WARNER CABLE INC. Mr. Marcus. Thank you. Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member Johnson, and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify today about the proposed transaction between Comcast and Time Warner Cable. I agree with David's assessment that the combination of our two companies will create a dynamic company poised for the 21st century, bringing new choices to consumers and spurring competition in the marketplace. This transaction will give the combined companies greater scale, which will drive investment in R&D, infrastructure, software, and talent, investment that will bring more consumers next generation technologies, more secure and reliable networks, faster broadband speeds, and enhanced video and voice services. The combination of Comcast and Time Warner Cable also will bring new competition to business customers that neither company could effectively serve on its own. Not only will the merger drive investment and innovation at the new Comcast, but it will also drive investment and innovation from our competitors. Consumers clearly will be the beneficiaries. And as David explained, this transaction will achieve these benefits without reducing competition in any way because Comcast and Time Warner Cable serve distinct geographic areas. To be clear, consumers will have the same choices of providers after the transaction as before. The video broadband and voice businesses have never been more competitive. Today in nearly every market, consumers have at least three, and in many cases four or more, choices of facilities-based video providers. For years now, the satellite providers, DirecTV and DISH, have had video nationwide. Verizon and AT&T now offer video in a significant portion of our footprint. Google has launched video in several markets and has announced plans to expand that offering, and smaller over- builders also offer competing facilities-based video services. At the same time, there are an increasing number of national over-the-top providers, including Netflix, which now has over 33 million customers in the U.S., and Google video websites, which attract over 157 million unique visitors each month. Especially because of this increased competition among video distributors, programmers, including smaller, independent programmers, have more options for reaching consumers than ever before. Time Warner Cable and Comcast both carry scores of independent programming networks, and I am confident that the combined company will continue to be a leading platform for such content. As for larger programmers, their ability to impose significant price increases every year demonstrates their extraordinary bargaining leverage. Programming costs at Time Warner Cable per subscriber will rise 10 percent this year, and I have no doubt that large programmers will continue to negotiate from a position of strength after our transaction. Like video, the broadband marketplace is incredibly dynamic with cable facing competition from large broadband providers, such as AT&T and Verizon, rapidly expanding services from Google fiber, and increasingly robust mobile wireless broadband services. In fact, recent announcements by both AT&T and Google underscore how quickly this marketplace is evolving. Just last month, AT&T named 100 candidate cities for broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. In February, Google stated that it has targeted an additional 34 cities for its 1 gig broadband service. I would also note that mobile wireless is rapidly becoming a viable alternative to cable broadband given the ever- increasing capabilities of LTE, as well as continued advances in compression technology. The market for voice is also flush with competition with landline, mobile, and a growing number of over-the-top services, such as Skype. As relatively new entrants into the voice business, Comcast and Time Warner Cable have contributed meaningfully to the competitive of this market, and will continue to do so as a combined company. This transaction will also create new and enhanced competition in the business market. Commercial services traditionally have been dominated by incumbents such as AT&T and Verizon, which leveraged their scale and scope to provide end-to-end services that businesses increasingly demand. Time Warner Cable has gained a foothold, especially with small- and medium-sized businesses. However, our ability to compete effectively in the telco-dominated business of serving larger multi-regional businesses has been constrained by our limited geographic footprint. This transaction will significantly boost competition for commercial services by giving the combined company greater scale, a broader geographic footprint, and efficiencies necessary to meet the needs of business customers, especially the super-regional enterprises that demand a broad network footprint. So in summary, today's dynamic and ever-evolving marketplace presents both new challenges and new opportunities. Enabling the new Comcast to compete with greater scale will yield more robust competition and significant benefits for consumers and businesses. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions. [The joint prepared statement of Mr. Cohen and Mr. Marcus follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Marcus. And, Mr. Polka, before you testify, let me say this. The heat was on in here when I arrived, and I have asked them to turn on the air conditioner, which I understand has now kicked on. But if any of the witnesses or audience, particularly if you have completed your testimony and you want to slip off your coat, or prior to giving your testimony you want to take off your coat, you may save yourself a lot of shine when you give your testimony. [Laughter.] So I would invite and encourage anyone who wants to do that to do that. Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bachus. You all look great, but as this wears on---- Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We certainly appreciate you bringing to life the analogy of being on the hot seat. Mr. Bachus. That is right. And this is a hotter hot seat than normal, and was not intended that way. I think Mr. Issa sometimes does turn up the heat, but we do not do that on this Committee. [Laughter.] Mr. Polka, you are recognized at this time. Mr. Polka. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. Bachus. But it is not stress. It is not stress. TESTIMONY OF MATTHEW M. POLKA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AMERICAN CABLE ASSOCIATION Mr. Polka. Thank you, sir. The proposed combination of Comcast and Time Warner Cable with later divestitures and swaps with Charter is a big deal that threatens consumers and competition. The singular point that I want you to know is that this is a complicated deal that will negatively impact your constituents. Unless the FCC and Department of Justice adopt robust relief, it should not be approved. To begin with, it is important to realize that Comcast is more than just the largest pay TV provider. It is also a very large programmer through its ownership of the NBC Television Network, 10 NBC-owned and operated stations, 13 regional sports networks, and many popular national cable networks. Like Comcast, Time Warner Cable is also a very large cable operator, and also a large programmer through its ownership and/or control of 16 regional sports networks, including those in New York and Los Angeles. I wish I could simplify this deal into a single component, but the fact is that there are three separate elements to consider that each causes harm. First, the combination of the two companies' programming; second, the combination of Comcast programming with the new cable systems Comcast acquires; third, the combination of the companies' cable systems. The first two are similar to ACA's concerns about the Comcast/NBCUniversal transaction that DoJ and FCC addressed through conditions. The third raises new and significant concerns not present in Comcast's previous deal. Regarding the first component, by merging its programming with Time Warner Cable's regional sports networks and selling them in a bundle, Comcast will gain greater bargaining power against all pay TV providers in all regions where Time Warner Cable's regional sports networks are carried. It will be severe in New York and Los Angeles where there is both an owned NBC television station and a must-have Time Warner Cable regional sports network. All pay TV providers and their consumers in these markets will be affected by this harm, including many ACA members. With respect to the second component, Comcast will have an incentive to disadvantage pay TV providers that compete directly with the cable systems it acquires. It will do this by either withholding Comcast programming during negotiation impasses or by demanding higher prices for this programming. However, the competitive harm will not be limited to Comcast's pay TV rivals. Because many of these pay TV providers obtain their programming through the National Cable Television Cooperative, NCTC, Comcast/Time Warner Cable will have an incentive to charge the NCTC higher prices for its programming, and this will harm the 900 pay TV providers that obtain Comcast/Time Warner Cable through the buying group. Regarding the third component, Comcast denies harm arising from combining its distribution assets with the Time Warner Cable and Charter cable systems it is acquiring because it does not compete locally against them. However, this ignores that this massive combination will dramatically increase the merged entity's bargaining power over video programmers. The merged entity will have about 30 percent of all pay TV subscribers nationally. This level of market share has traditionally raised concerns with Federal antitrust authorities. It will also have greater regional market share because of the Comcast-Charter deal. As a result, it will become a must-have distribution outlet for national and many regional programmers. In the short run, it will demand even larger volume discounts than its rival, thereby weakening these rivals' competitive position or worse. And in the long run, Comcast/Time Warner Cable may leverage its pay TV industry dominance to increase its market share in the video programming industry, ultimately reducing this industry's competitiveness, too. The final result: higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. The FCC adopted arbitration conditions designed to ameliorate the first two harms described above in the Comcast/ NBCUniversal order. However, requiring Comcast/Time Warner Cable to abide by these same conditions is insufficient because they are flawed. In particular, arbitration remains too expensive for smaller pay TV providers. Moreover, the conditions incompletely described how bargaining agents for smaller pay TV providers could avail themselves of the arbitration conditions. Lastly, the Department of Justice and FCC will need to fashion new remedies for the harm arising from combining Comcast distribution assets with distribution assets of Time Warner Cable and Charter which did not arise in the Comcast/ NBCU transaction. In conclusion, the DoJ and FCC have some big decisions ahead. ACA looks forward to working closely with Congress and the agencies as the review proceeds and conditions are fashioned to address the transactions anti-competitive harms. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Polka follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Polka. And at this time, Mr. Hemphill, you are recognized--or Professor Hemphill--for your opening statement. TESTIMONY OF C. SCOTT HEMPHILL, PROFESSOR OF LAW, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL Mr. Hemphill. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the antitrust implications of this proposed merger. As several Members have already noted, antitrust protects dynamic and competitive markets, and a number of antitrust concerns have been raised out this merger. These concerns, however, are generally based on mistaken analogies that do not really apply. For example, critics have charged that this merger is just like AT&T-Mobile, and, therefore, it can be expected to raise prices to consumers, but, in fact, this merger is nothing like that. You have heard this already, but I think it bears emphasis. To see why, suppose I want to buy a wireless service where I live in New York City. I can choose from AT&T, T- Mobile, and other providers. Take one of these away, though, and the remaining firms may be able to raise prices, which has the bad effect of squeezing some consumers out of the market. Now, compare that to the video service. Where I live in West Village, I can choose among Time Warner and other options, but Comcast is not a choice unless I am willing to move to Philadelphia, which I currently am not. In fact, Time Warner and Comcast do not really compete anywhere for cable customers, so nothing is lost by their combination. Now, critics offer a second analogy that Comcast is sort of like a powerful grain buyer acting in a predatory way against farmers. Now, in an agricultural market, farmers might well find themselves at the whim of, let us say, the only two grain buyers in town. And if the two buyers merge, they have an opportunity to reduce purchases in order to depress the price. But again, this merger is nothing like that. In fact, programmers, companies like ESPN, are nothing like farmers. When ESPN sells programming to Comcast, nothing is used up. ESPN is free to sell the same programming to other video providers, too, and, of course, it does so to DirecTV, FiOS, and on and on. Put differently, when there is no rivalry in the use of the product, this whole buyer strategy, the strategy of cutting back on purchases in order to force a price drop, just collapses. Now, there is another argument here, which is that Comcast might be able to strike a better bargain thanks to its increased size. Now, that is far from clear. To be sure, the stakes are higher for ESPN compared to today because ESPN loses more revenue if its contract negotiations within Comcast break down, but that is true for Comcast, too. The stakes are higher for Comcast as well as more customers complain or cancel their service. Nor is Comcast such a must-have with programmers that it gains special power that way. The third analogy is that Comcast is just like Microsoft. Now, the idea here is that Netflix and other online video providers will be undermined, foreclosing their ability to compete with traditional video. Now, this deserves careful attention because I think we can all agree that preserving innovation and competition from online video is very important. But this third analogy seems wrong to me as well. For one thing, the cost of foreclosure strategies is quite high, and there are existing protections under the earlier NBCU merger conditions for online video that would actually be extended to Time Warner which could be thought of as a benefit of the deal. What I do think we see here is not so much foreclosure, but an ongoing fight among powerful firms, an ongoing fight to figure out who should pay for the infrastructure that makes possible the dramatic growth in online video and how those payments should be achieved. Thank you again for the opportunity to address these issues, and I look forward to your questions. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] [The prepared statement of Mr. Hemphill follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Professor. And at this time, Mr. Grunes, we invite you to testify. TESTIMONY OF ALLEN P. GRUNES, PARTNER, GEYERGOREY LLP Mr. Grunes. Thank you, Chairman and Vice Chairman, and Chairman--Ranking Member--sorry--of the full Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, and Committee Members. I am very happy to be here. I have practiced antitrust law for about 25 years, and about half of that time I was with the antitrust division. Now, Comcast and Time Warner Cable say they do not compete for subscribers, and you have heard that this morning. But the fact is that Comcast and Time Warner Cable do compete. That is what Brian Roberts, the Comcast CEO, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in Comcast's last mega merger with NBCUniversal. And Mr. Roberts was right. The two companies compete in a number of ways. For instance, they compete to carry local and regional sports teams, and they compete for advertising dollars. Mr. Chairman, to help illustrate how sports programming in particular would be abused post-merger, I would ask unanimous consent to submit for the record an article by former Bush Administration official, Brad Blakeman. The article explains in detail the impact of the merger on sports and sports fans, and it is highly relevant here. Mr. Bachus. And without objection, all the witnesses can introduce any extraneous materials or records into the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Grunes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And as for cable advertisers, they will have less choices if this merger goes through, including smaller local advertisers in your districts who may get shut out entirely. Now, Comcast says that people have a multitude of choices for how they get broadband. You have heard that here today. But at an investment conference in 2011, Mr. Roberts said that Comcast had only one broadband competitor. He was talking about FiOS, which was and still is in only about 15 percent of Comcast's territories. This merger is very likely illegal. The parties know it. That is why they are here talking about how they plan to fix it. But I am here to tell you what they will not, why it is illegal, and why the fix does not cut it. This time it is different. Let us talk about video first since I think that is the easiest. They want to put together Comcast content with Time Warner Cable's wires. The antitrust theory is that after the merger, the company would have both the ability and the incentive to withhold NBC and sports programming from rivals, such as the satellite companies, the telcos, other cable systems, that would drive up their competitors' costs, and make them less competitive. That is called input foreclosure in antitrust jargon. Is it a radical theory? No. It is right out of the Comcast/NBCU complaint that the Antitrust Division filed in 2011. But this time, it is worse. Now, let us talk about the even more serious issue of broadband. Comcast and Time Warner Cable shares of the broadband markets are much higher. We have not heard the witnesses talk about what those shares are, but by some estimates they are 50 percent or even more. So what is the problem? Simple: online video distributors like Netflix, according to the Antitrust Division, are likely to be the best hope for additional video programming competition in Comcast and Time Warner Cable's territories. If Comcast can get a hold of about 50 percent of broadband subscribers through this merger, it puts itself into a position to influence how this new form of competition will play out. The antitrust theory here is called ``customer foreclosure.'' You had input foreclosure. This is customer foreclosure. Keep innovative competitors from being able to connect with their audience or charge them so their costs go up. Again, this is not a radical theory. It was mentioned as a concern in the 2011 Comcast/NBCU complaint. It is very similar to a theory that the Division, the Antitrust Division, actually litigated and won in the D.C. Circuit in the Microsoft case. The same analysis has been applied in other cases where the Internet is threatening an old business model. The key point is that a legitimate role of antitrust is to keep the pathways for innovation open. There is also a buyer power theory, which is discussed in my written testimony. Finally, a word about remedies. If, as I believe, the merger is anti-competitive, the best remedy is simply to say no. Behavioral remedies do not work well. In fact, Professor John Kwoka, who studied empirically how well they work, said they are disastrous on the whole. They do not prevent prices from going up. Partial divestitures, such as shedding subscribers, also often fail. In this case, where Comcast would pick up New York, and LA, and other markets, it is likely to try to keep the most profitable subscribers and the most profitable markets and divest the others. That will not restore lost competition. And I am happy to answer any questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Grunes follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Grunes. And at this time, Mr. Gottsch, you are recognized. TESTIMONY OF PATRICK GOTTSCH, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, RFD-TV Mr. Gottsch. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member Johnson, and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Patrick Gottsch. I along with my daughters, Raquel and Gatsby, who I am proud to say are sitting right behind me today, represent the founders and majority shareholders of Real Media Group, owners of RFD-TV, RURAL TV, FamilyNet, and RURAL RADIO on Sirius XM Channel 80. Thank you for the opportunity to testify about the importance of independent programming and the impact of consolidation in the cable industry from a rural perspective. RFT-TV is about as independent as one can get. After 8 years of rejection, in December of 2000, RFD-TV was finally launched as a public interest channel on DISH, and then added to DirecTV in 2002, thanks to Congress and the FCC establishing Section 335 of the 1992 Cable Communications Act. The 146 independent program producers associated now with RMG, along with the millions of viewers who value the rural and agricultural news, western sports, and traditional family- oriented entertainment featured on our channels, have Congress, the FCC, and Charlie Ergen to thank for having the foresight to create opportunities to give independent channels a chance to exist and prosper. In 2007, RFD-TV evolved into a for-profit entity, and Rural Media Group was formed. Recognized now as one of America's leading independent networks, RFD-TV was ranked most reasonably priced in the recent 2013 Independent Cable News Survey. Nielsen rated and distributed into over 40 million homes in cable and DBS, RFD-TV is the number one channel now for C&D County viewership, number one for time spent viewing, and for adults 50 plus as a percentage of our overall audience composition. In 2008, RFD-TV signed an 8-year master affiliation agreement with Comcast. Following success in Nashville, in October of 2010, Comcast launched RFD-TV on all systems in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. RFD-TV worked closely with Comcast's Denver office and invested heavily in this launch by purchasing billboards, radio ads, organizing radio remotes, and training Comcast telemarketers. The launch was a resounding success with RFD-TV generating an average 2.8 percent lift with connects up 15 percent on the D-1 tier in all these Comcast markets. Independents try harder and have to deliver. As you know, in January 2011, the Comcast/NBCUniversal merger was approved. Since then, Comcast has not launched RFD- TV in a single new major market and has declined to carry RFDHD in any of their markets, despite the provisions added to the merger designed to protect independents. On August 13th of this past year, despite strong ratings, low costs, and over the vehement objections from thousands of Comcast customers represented by these binders in front of me, we were given only a 30-day notice. Comcast dropped RFD-TV on all its cable systems in Colorado and New Mexico. In 1 day, RFD-TV lost 470,000 homes, 43 percent of its very limited Comcast distribution. To date, RFD-TV has worked diligently to understand Comcast's decision and to find a solution. The City of Pueblo, the State of Colorado, and even the Colorado governor's office mobilized significant efforts to persuade Comcast to reverse its decision and return RFD-TV's popular rural and western- themed programming to these two States with such strong ties to the western lifestyle. Meetings have also been held with the regional Denver office and with Comcast programming executives in Philadelphia, to no avail. Why was RFD-TV dropped despite all this support? It is the question that everybody has, no matter who we meet with. But it seems to be simple. We are just a true independent. RFD-TV enjoys excellent relations with most all other cable operators. In fact, this past year, Charter launched RFD-TV on their Fort Worth system, and in October, Time Warner added RFD- TV to franchises in the State of Kentucky. Our concerns with Comcast now taking over this major western city and another rural State should be obvious. In addition, 30 million homes may be denied the choice to access this proven channel and a wall will be built between rural and urban America if Comcast does not reverse its recent behavior with RMG and RFD-TV. In the past, the United States Government has taken critical steps to ensure that rural America has a balance of services offered between rural and urban populations. The information super highway must go down each and every country road and provide two-way communication in order that city and country remain connected, just as it was when the 1893 Mail Communications Act led to the establishment of our namesake, rural free delivery, or RFD-TV. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me not to wear a tie, and I look forward to answering all your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Gottsch follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you very much, Mr. Gottsch. And at this time, Mr. Schaeffer, you are recognized for your opening statement. TESTIMONY OF DAVE SCHAEFFER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, COGENT COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC. Mr. Schaeffer. Well, thank you, Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member Johnson, and the entire Committee for the opportunity to voice our concerns. This particular transaction is not about video, but rather about the future. It is about the Internet. You know, 15 years ago I had the good fortune and maybe the good luck to found a company on a simple principle that the Internet was going to be the only network that mattered, bandwidth was a commodity, technology would allow us to drive down prices forever. Those bets turned out to be correct. It was difficult. We went through a tough market segment, and we have been a good 'net citizen in helping lead that technology fight and driving down the costs of bandwidth. Comcast, however, has not been quite as good of a 'net citizen, and is actually looking to be a worse 'net citizen going forward if they are allowed to combine their network with that of Time Warner. So the Internet is based on the idea of free exchange of traffic. One of the mechanisms that traffic is exchanged is peering. So while Comcast signed a consent decree as part of its last merger with NBCUniversal and said it is not going to interfere with traffic inside of its network, it has actually been very clever. It interferes with traffic before it enters its network. So the Internet today has allowed 2.7 billion people wirelessly and another billion people wire line to connect. Over half of the population of the world exchanges information. The Internet is 44,000 networks. Those networks interconnect one of two ways: they buy connectivity from companies such as ours, or they peer and they connect through those peering connections. Comcast does not operate a global network, in fact, should be buying connectivity to the global Internet, but has used its market scale and scope to extract an unusual concession. It wanted free connectivity peering to the Internet. Even though it did not operate a global network, it did not carry its fair load. But because it represented so many customers, backbone operators, like Cogent and others, agreed to peer with them. That was not good enough for Comcast. As Comcast's market power continued to increase, as consumers had less choice, they actually started to demand payments for connectivity. A larger Comcast will demand even greater payments. Let me use an example of Netflix. Netflix is our largest customer. We are their primary carrier of Internet traffic. Netflix buys that connectivity from Cogent because we deliver the highest quality at the lowest price. We have dozens of competitors. We win business every day by competing and offering the lowest price and the highest quality. Netflix wanted to do business with us. They continue to be our largest customer, but there was a problem. We could not deliver all the traffic that Netflix was delivering to Comcast customers. We deliver no traffic to a Comcast customer that a paying Comcast does not request. When we deliver that traffic, the ports, or connections, between our network and Comcast became full. We went back to Comcast and said could you please upgrade these connections in a normal pattern and practice that we have been doing for years. Even though you, Comcast, are not really qualified to be a global peer, we will give you free connectivity. Allow us to deliver the content at our expense to the customers that you are charging, those 20.7 million customers that you collect $30 million a day from. Comcast refused. They not only refused Cogent, they refused every other major backbone, and in doing so forced Netflix, an innovative company, into a corner. They forced Netflix to have to go and directly enter into a contract with Comcast, paying a higher price for a less robust product. That is not a free market. That is an abuse of market power. A larger and more combined company would have even more market power. So there are two parties that do not sit in front of this Committee today: tens of millions of consumers. I think this Committee cares about them and will protect those consumers, as well the FTC, the Justice Department, the FCC. But there are also entrepreneurs and innovators. We today sell service to thousands of edge providers. I cannot predict where the next You Tube or the next Netflix will come from. I can tell you, though, that their business models are highly dependent on getting inexpensive connectivity. And what they are not dependent on is entering into a bilateral agreement, paying a toll to an inefficient operator, such as Comcast, who has not honored the commitments that they have made to date. Why should you in this Committee expect them to honor those commitments going forward? Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Schaeffer follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Mr. Schaeffer. At this time, Dr. Labovitz? TESTIMONY OF CRAIG LABOVITZ, Ph.D., CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, DEEPFIELD Mr. Labovitz. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member Johnson, and Members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to be here today to discuss some of the technical issues that may be relevant to your consideration of the proposed Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger. At the outset, I want you to know that Comcast and Time Warner Cable are two of the many companies with whom my company, DeepField, has commercial relationships. The views expressed in my testimony are my own. I am both an academic researcher and a commercial vendor. My current company, DeepField, provides network management and analytic solutions to a range of large content companies and consumer Internet providers. My career has included roles as the chairman of the Principal Internet Industry Engineering Association in North America, as well as the project director of several National Science Foundation research project studying Internet architecture. I received a Ph.D. in the study of Internet architecture from the University of Michigan in 1999. In 2010, I collaborated on the largest research study of Internet traffic to date. Earlier this year, my company, DeepField, along with academic and industry research partners, began work on a large- scale follow-up study to the 2010 study. My testimony this morning is largely based on these research efforts. Ten years ago, the Internet was both much smaller and looked very different than it does today. Early on, almost all traffic traveled across an Internet core consisting of 10 to 12 large national and international Internet providers, including companies like AT&T and Level 3. The Internet core connected the majority of content providers with the many thousands of consumer access networks around the world, such as Earthlink and AOL. These interconnections between providers are known as peering. Unlike telephony, the exchange of Internet traffic has largely developed without regulation. Both today and in the early days of the Internet, service providers such as AT&T sometimes negotiate the exchange of Internet traffic with other large providers without paying for access or traffic rights. The industry calls these arrangements settlement free peering. Both today and in earlier Internet periods, consumers have paid access networks, such as AOL, and in turn those access networks have paid larger providers, such as AT&T, for connection to other access networks and large providers. The industry calls these arrangements transit peering. Over the last 10 years, technological advances and market forces have dramatically transformed the landscape of core Internet connection. These market forces include consolidation, such as the Google's acquisition of YouTube, and the rapid growth in Internet content and advertising revenue. Our research has documented the accelerating impact of these market forces. Internet traffic was once broadly distributed across thousands of companies, but by 2009, half of all Internet traffic originated in less than 150 large content and content distribution companies. Today just 30 companies, including Netflix and Google, contribute on average more than one-half of all Internet traffic in the United States during prime time. There have also been significant changes to interconnection at the core of the Internet in recent years. Specifically, today there is much more direct interconnection between access networks, such as Verizon, and content providers, like Hulu and Google, than there were previously. The removal of transit provider ``middlemen'' is because content and access networks seek greater efficiencies of scale and economy. Our research has also found a significant degree of vertical integration and blurring of traditional distinction between companies, content providers, and they will build global backbones. Cable Internet service providers offer wholesale transit. And transit Internet providers offer content distribution and cloud hosting services. For example, Level 3 is both a large transit provider as well as the second largest content distribution provider. Finally, our ongoing work has found growing diversity and complexity in the Internet ``cyber supply chain.'' This refers to the increasingly diverse set of third party infrastructure and services supporting the delivery of Internet content. Websites once came from computers directly owned and managed by the content owners located in tens of thousands of enterprise machine closets and enterprise data centers around the world. Today the majority of Internet content leverages one or more of multiple third party content distribution services, hosting providers, exchange points or cloud providers, often with many diverse direct interconnections to networks like Comcast or Verizon. Examples of companies providing these different services are identified in my prepared statement. I hope my testimony and my research findings help provide the technical context of the increasingly complex economic and engineering issues associated with Internet content delivery and interconnection. I thank you for your time and attention. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Labovitz follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Bachus. Thank you, Doctor. At this time, we will proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions. In order that each Member has sufficient time to ask questions of our large panel, we expect to have two rounds of questioning. And I will say that Members who are not Members of the Subcommittee but Members of the whole Committee, as we start that second round, I will yield my time to you because I am told that that is the only way that we can accomplish that. So, Mr. Gohmert, you have been here the entire hearing, so you will commence the second round. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes. Mr. Cohen, your response to a question by Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is my counterpart in the Senate, was that ``We carry independent networks because we are always focused on the consumer. If you have compelling content and you can make that case that our consumers want to watch that content, we will carry it.'' First, I would ask you if you stand by that statement. But secondly, I would just caution you what may be a consumer in Philadelphia and what may be a consumer in Coosa County, Alabama, which is an agricultural county, or in Colorado, is a totally different consumer. Mr. Cohen. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And the answer is I definitely do stand by that statement, and I completely acknowledge the second part of what you are saying. We try and assess what our customers want in individual local markets, so whereas we do centralize negotiation of content deals out of headquarters in Philadelphia, there is enormous input from local systems as to what channels and what programming their customers might want to say. And just to put flesh on the bones of this, I mean, we think we are, if not the most, one of the most independent programmer friendly distributors in the industry. We carry 160 independent programming networks. And in the last 3 years, we have negotiated and given expanded distribution for 120 of those networks. So we are a company that really does try and find the niches. Most of those networks may not have national distribution, but we really try and find the niches of programming that customers in particular markets are interested in. Mr. Bachus. Thank you. Mr. Gottsch, in your experience, has Comcast lived up to the statement of Mr. Cohen? Mr. Gottsch. Well, of the---- Mr. Bachus. Yes, there we go. Mr. Gottsch. Excuse me. The 160 programmers that Mr. Cohen mentioned, we are proud to be two of those programmers with our RFD-TV channel and our FamilyNet channel. But that has not been the case here in the last year and specifically since the last merger. We, in fact, as I mentioned in our statement, were taken off in Colorado and New Mexico. And in those States, there was not a rate dispute. We were under contract. We had the support of the City of Pueblo, the State of Colorado, and the governor's office in Colorado. When it was announced that RFD- TV would be removed on August 13th, we had a lot of customers that were contacting us directly who said they could not get a hold of Comcast, or that Comcast customer service was telling them that it was a rate dispute. We invited folks to write us and that we would personally deliver their letters and their concerns to the Denver office, which we did. We have seven of these binders, so over 4,000 customers were asking Comcast not to remove us, yet we still were removed in August of 2013. Mr. Bachus. Thank you. And I would say that, you know, and maybe it is not just the numbers, but content. I know that with mergers in the radio business, Birmingham, which is an SEC football town, is getting a lot of hockey news, and we get a lot of soccer, which is growing, but most people my age do not know what the rules of soccer are. There is football, baseball, and basketball. So I would just call it a challenge, but it is a challenge that if you become bigger, you need to be aware of it. Mr. Cohen. Sir, we're--look, I am sympathetic to this argument. I was actually involved at the time of this decision. And, you know, in a perfect world if money was not an issue and if bandwidth was not an issue, and in the RFD-TV case bandwidth was the much more substantial issue, those systems in Denver and Albuquerque are very bandwidth constrained, and our local teams there made a judgment that it was more important for us to add more high definition channels of popular programming, like the Smithsonian Channel and the Food Channel, that those were more valuable to the customers in that market. And it is nothing punitive against RFD-TV. We continue to carry RFD-TV to about 600,000 or 700,000 of our customers, including in Kentucky and Nashville, I mean, the markets where we first started with them. Let us always stay focused on the consumer. It is not that they do not have a choice. If RFD-TV is sufficiently important to them, they can switch to DISH and DirecTV and those markets, both of which carry RFD-TV. So we are not controlling consumer choice here. We are primarily an urban clustered cable company. And this content, even in Colorado, the bulk of our base is in the urban areas of Colorado, and we make the best judgments we can. Mr. Bachus. Yes. I think that sort of encapsulates, I think, the fear that, you know, the rural market gets left out. And I would say we would be very sensitive to that because, you know, there are still a lot of people in rural areas. But I will let Mr. Gottsch respond, and then my time is up. Mr. Gottsch. Yes, just a brief reply. The curious thing here, the question that we cannot get answered is out of the 160 independent channels that Comcast carried, they appear to have taken off one of the most popular channels in the Colorado and New Mexico markets. Our Nielsen ratings are higher than the other 159 channels in many day parts and throughout the week. And then, again it was the support of local governments and the request of Colorado that if there is going to be 160 independents, is there not room for one independent channel devoted to rural interests, which make up 27 million homes in this country. There appears to be 11 million homes of the 29 million that Comcast is taking over and 70 million people. Just one channel devoted to rural America is all we are asking for. Mr. Bachus. Thank you. At this time, I will recognize the Ranking Member of the full Committee, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The minority lead ownership in the video and broadband marketplace is good business, it is an important societal goal, and it helps to expand our economy. And that is a value that many people hold dear. When Comcast announced its merger with Time Warner, it stated that it anticipated that the FCC would require it to get under the 30 percent limit for cable TV systems. And so, there was an agreement that has been worked out with Charter to sell the 3.9 million channels that, or--excuse me--subscribers that would be required to get under that 30 percent benchmark. Did Comcast, Mr. Cohen, consider doing smaller transactions with African-American and Hispanic companies instead of giving the whole 3.9 million to Charter? Mr. Cohen. So, Mr. Johnson, I know you are aware of our commitment as a company to minority participation and ownership as well as in access to minority-centric programming. And so, this was a significant part of our discussion and remains a significant part of discussion. The problem is that there was no way to accomplish the significant tax efficiencies and competition and public interest enhancing efficiencies that we have been able to generate through this three-part transaction with Charter by dividing the systems into smaller pieces and making them available for smaller companies, whether they are minority or not minority to be able to bid for them. It was a topic of discussion. We have had discussions with numerous minority- owned groups who are interested in purchasing cable systems. And I will report to you the same that we have reported to them, which is we will continue to look for opportunities to create minority ownership in the cable system space. Mr. Johnson. And what about enabling already-existing minority-owned providers to get larger? Mr. Cohen. So I am running through my mind and do not think it would be appropriate to disclose the various groups that we have talked to. I honestly am not sure whether any of them are existing minority owners of cable systems. But to the extent we would engage in this kind of a process, we would obviously not exclude those types of groups from participating. And if I can, Mr. Chairman, I mean, I think that I have some credibility speaking to this because 4 years ago when we were doing the NBCUniversal transaction, I talked about our company's commitment to minority ownership in the cable channel space. I referenced TV One, which we helped to create as a cable company after our acquisition of AT&T Broadband, and which we continue to support. And it is one of the great success stories of a minority-owned channel. And in the NBCUniversal transaction, we committed to launch eight new minority-owned independent networks over an 8- to 10- year period. We have launched four of those already, two of them African-American owned and two of them owned by Hispanic- Americans. So this is a space where minority ownership of businesses, wealth creation opportunities, and conversation shaping opportunities is very important to us as a company. Mr. Johnson. All right, thank you. As you know, African- Americans view television programming at a more significant level than the general population. Yet there seems to be a disproportionately small amount of programming geared toward urban and African-American audiences. On its basic cable programming tier, does Comcast carry any African-American controlled and operated networks? And if so, are those networks carried on the basic tier in every market, or only in select franchise areas? Mr. Cohen. So I am not sure what our basic tier is anymore, but I can tell you that our most popular tier is our basic digital tier. And on that tier we carry 11 African-American owned or targeted networks, which is the sum of African- American owned or operated networks that we know about. Now, I know only three of them are African-American owned-- TV One, ASPiRE, and Revolt. We do not necessarily know whether these other networks are majority African-American owned, minority. But they identify themselves as African-American targeted networks, and we carry all 11 of them on our most popular digital tier. Mr. Johnson. All right, thank you. How do you respond to claims that Comcast/NBCU has blocked certain content providers, like Univision Sports, from being carried on your services, or unfairly place channels of other content providers, like Bloomberg News, because they compete with NBCU channels? Mr. Cohen. Two very different questions, but the answer would be the same to both, which is I would deny those charges. I think they are not true. In terms of the way we treated Bloomberg News, the irony of the Bloomberg News situation was that Bloomberg News was positioned in the place it was in the channel lineup before we owned CNBC, so there could not have been any discriminatory intent. But I do not even rely on that argument anymore. We had a dispute with Bloomberg News. It was resolved at the FCC. We have now repositioned Bloomberg News to news neighborhoods as they have requested----. Mr. Johnson. What about Univision? Mr. Cohen [continuing]. And we have resolved that matter entirely. Mr. Johnson. All right. Would you care to respond to the claim about Univision Sports? Mr. Cohen. I am sorry. I was worried about the time, but I am happy to answer that. Mr. Farenthold [presiding]. And I was going to go there in my line of questioning, too. Mr. Cohen. I will quickly say we carry eight Univision networks. Univision has come to us and they have asked for additional carriage of three Univision networks, and we are under discussions with them. We are one of the largest, if not the largest, carrier of Hispanic programming---- Mr. Johnson. What about sports? Mr. Cohen [continuing]. Fifty-eight channels. So as a business matter, we will resolve our issues with Univision in due course. Mr. Johnson. All right, and I will yield back. Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson. I do want to follow up a little bit on that, Mr. Cohen. I do want to point out, I do not want to sound hostile to this merger because I really think that the government needs to stay as much out of the business world as possible. But I have had some concerns raised by constituents and some interest groups that I have agreed to talk to you guys about. And I think that is the purpose of this hearing is to get the stuff on the table. And, you know, one of my concerns is that I learned last week that a combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable will serve 91 percent of the Hispanic households in the U.S., and it will be the top distributor in 19 out of the 20 top Hispanic markets. We know that you guys own Telemundo, one of the current providers of Spanish language programming. And along with what Mr. Johnson was asking, what assurances can you give us that you will not discriminate against non-Comcast/NBCUniversal owned programming produced by other companies? And do you have internal procedures in place to prevent that kind of discrimination? Mr. Cohen. So I should have waited for your follow-up. I would have been able to give a more complete answer. So first of all, we have not been able to verify those numbers, just for the record. But I have observed before in this transaction that sometimes big is bad, and I understand that. But sometimes big is good, and sometimes big is very good. And when you have a company like Comcast, which has this extraordinary commitment to diverse programming, but, in particular, to Hispanic and Hispanic-themed programming, covering a greater percentage of the Hispanic population in the United States is a really good thing because we will bring that commitment to those communities in the same we have brought it to the current Comcast footprint. So we have a significant commitment to carrying Hispanic programming. As I said, we carry 58 Hispanic or Hispanic-themed cable channels currently, and we have a long-term retransmission consent agreement with Univision. And we carry eight Univision networks, so---- Mr. Farenthold. I guess, this kind of follows up on my overall concern about the difficulty for new programmers to break into the market. Univision's Sports Network is a perfect example. They are actually, I think, not on you all's stations, but they end up the number one Spanish language sports, so it kind of argues against being good business to have it on there. You hear Mr. Gottsch here testify about the fact that his ratings in markets where he was removed from your cable system were higher than some of the other channels that you won. So I guess the level of vertical integration there, the fact that NBC owned so many stations that would potentially compete with these---- Mr. Cohen. So let me respond to that, and fortunately for us this is one of the most litigated issues that exists in antitrust law, and that is the percentage of the market that a single company can have before there is a risk that it can foreclose content to its consumers. Twice the FCC had extended proceedings to determine what was that percentage of the market. Twice they concluded that if one cable company had more than 30 percent of the market, there would be an undue risk of that company serving as a bottleneck or extorting improper pricing from channels. Mr. Farenthold. One of the--yes. Mr. Cohen. Twice the D.C. Circuit struck that down finding that there was no evidence that with a 30 percent share a cable company would be able to control the market. We are coming in below 30 percent, and the answer to the question is that any cable channel has more than 70 percent of the country to be able to go after. Mr. Farenthold. All right. I am running out of time. Okay, go ahead, but I am running out of time here. Mr. Cohen. One quick answer. One quick. The protection that exists is the program carriage rules. There are legal rules that prevent us from discriminating against a new channel or an existing channel in favor of content that we own. So that is something that already exists under the law. We are not allowed to do it. Mr. Farenthold. One of the mitigating factors I think that is actually going to gain you support in this is as new technologies are developing out and you are getting more cable companies, you have got FiOS competing. Mr. Cohen. Right. Mr. Farenthold. You have got Google Fiber coming in. There are going to be more options in the short term. But I am also concerned about the programming. I will use an example from Corpus Christie where I live. We have two cable companies. We have Time Warner and we have Grande. Comcast owns the rights to the Astros baseball games. I would assume there is not going to be a lot of incentive there for you to sell the rights to carry the Astros baseball for, you know, a few cents or a buck a subscriber to Grande when you can use it to bring in, you know, hundred-dollar Internet/cable/phone. How are we going to address the issue of fair access to your programs? And that could be taken to the extreme to say, all right, we are going to pull NBC and Bravo and E!, too, or we are going to jack them up to competing cable companies or FiOS in the same market. Mr. Cohen. So I smile only because I wish we had that problem with the Houston Regional Sports Net, and that your concern---- Mr. Farenthold. Well, it is part of the Astros' fault. They are not doing very well. Mr. Cohen. If you really wanted to watch the Astros, that would, like, be good news for that network. But the Houston RSN is a perfect example really of why the fear about our control of this is overstated. That network is really controlled by the two teams, by both the Astros and the Rockets. We have a minority ownership interest in it. We manage it, but they control the pricing of the network. They control the distribution of it. But again, even if that were not true and we were controlling that, that is on the program access side, so you have the program access rules. And I would note that under the NBCUniversal order, a small cable company that does not like the terms that are being offered actually has a right of arbitration just on that regional sports net without any other cable channels bundled with it. Mr. Farenthold. Well, I have run the red light, so we will move along. And I will have a couple more questions in the second round of questioning---- Mr. Cohen. Thank you---- Mr. Farenthold [continuing]. For some of the other members of the panel. We will now go to the Ranking Member of the full Committee, the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank all the witnesses for their important contributions. I have a strong feeling that we may have to have another hearing on this because of the complexity of the material. I would like to start off with, well, just observing that Mr. Hemphill left out the consumer welfare is the key objective of antitrust law. You said the goal of antitrust is to ensure dynamic competition and open markets. But I did not hear a lot about keeping prices low and choices for the consumer. So I would like to turn to Mr. Grunes, who said that 30 percent of the cable market share is not enough to be anti- competitive. But really no court has ruled that 30 percent is, as a rule, not enough to be anti-competitive. And the Supreme Court has also ruled that 30 percent of a market was a troubling trend toward concentration. And also, what about the 40 percent control of the broadband Internet? How do you see this as something that we may not overcome if this merger were to go through? Mr. Grunes. Thank you, Ranking Member Conyers. Two points. First of all, I did not advocate 30 percent as not being a problem. The merging parties---- Mr. Conyers. Oh, Mr. Cohen was the one that made that---- Mr. Grunes. Mr. Cohen, yes. And I would point out a couple of things. First of all, Judge Diane Wood of the 7th Circuit, who is also a former Antitrust Division lawyer and a University of Chicago professor, found that 20 percent was large enough in the Toys R Us case depending on the markets. The issue here is not simply numbers. A subscriber is not a subscriber is not a subscriber. When you have the top 10 or top 20 markets, that gives you power in each of those markets, and that is the power we should be concerned about. In terms of the broadband shares, I am not sure whether it is 40 percent, 50 percent. It could be as high as 60 percent. But the one thing I can say is that we have not heard Comcast or Time Warner Cable come into today and say we are going to get those shares down to 30 percent. They are talking about the video shares. They have not said a word about the broadband shares. Mr. Conyers. Thank you so much. Mr. Hemphill. If I might just add to clarify, if you do not mind, Mr.---- Mr. Conyers. Well, I do mind right now because I am under a very tight time limit. Maybe on the second round. Mr. Hemphill. Maybe on the second round. Mr. Conyers. Let me turn now to Mr. Polka. Comcast is a cable company and a programmer, and that raises a double concern with me because of potentially higher prices and fewer choices, which is what we are concerned about. And I think the Department of Justice is going to take a little while sorting this out, and I do not know if it is resolvable to be honest with you at first blush. What are your cautionary comments to the Committee about this? Mr. Polka. Very cautionary. As I mentioned in my opening comments, these are really three separate mergers that we are talking about, not just a horizontal merger, because you have got the combination of programming assets of both Comcast and Time Warner Cable. You have got the combination of Comcast distribution and other programming assets that combine anti- competitively. And, Mr. Chairman, I would note that Grande Communications is a member of ours and is very concerned about the nature of this big deal and prices that they will be charged ultimately that their consumers will have to absorb. And then the ability of the large company, even though it ma"
