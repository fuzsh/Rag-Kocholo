A variety of concerts in numerous genres are scheduled outdoors and in the Heartland Events Center.\n\nAgriculture is still the backbone of the Nebraska State Fair. The Sheep Barn includes a birthing pavilion. The Cattle Barn includes a milking parlor. The Ag Arena hosts one of the largest draft horse events in the United States. The high school rodeo moved to the fair in 2013 and takes place at the Thompson Arena."
