        "text": "FALL 2023\n\nBRANDING & APP DESIGN\n\nSELF-INITIATED PROJECT\n\nHomebass is a community-based app for all things house in one digital home. Over the past year I got into house music and was immediately drawn to it over other genres because of the community. Originating in the 70’s from a warehouse in my hometown of Chicago, to crowded sweaty basements today, house music thrives on the underground. Birthed by marginalized groups and growing from scrappy subterraean nightlife culture, house music gives a space for people to express themselves rythmically and musically when other environments don’t.\n\nMy goal with this identity system was to honor the subversive culture and channel the movement and atmosphere of the music. The logomark a record warped by sound vibrations. The limited color palette a nod to the grunge atmosphere illuminated by strobing lights."
