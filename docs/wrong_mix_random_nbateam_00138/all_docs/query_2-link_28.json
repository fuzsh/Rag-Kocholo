It’s on YouTube channel as well! Just sharing small milestones as my stomach churns from the disgust I have for the imbalances in this world. There’s so much going on and I have to constantly return to my own center. The world pays more mind to music, entertainment and billionaires than it does to geno€ide and the politics of care. This song itself speaks to the power of the unseen and how it plays a part in our lives. Sometimes I feel unseen and it makes me feel a way. Then I remember that my life and my music is not a commodity. Life itself is the most sacred thing and there’s so much privilege in just being able to exist. Taking breaths today. Focusing the efforts on bringing attention and love to our relatives in PAL£stine. The phone calls, the posts and stories, the people in the streets, the children, babies, families, deep connection to land, the olive trees, the blood and tears. Holding the standards of how to show up in this time. I’m sorry but if you aren’t using the banjo as a way to heal the world WTF are you using it for? I actually dgaf about beyonces country album right now because she has nothing of substance to offer the world in its current time. If Black people want to be apolitical, silent or not choose to have a backbone because they are people pleasing the yt z!onist Hetero patriarchy, it just does nothing for life. I am going to go ahead and continue using the banjo as a tool for liberation. The amount of geno€ide that our own people have endured, the banjo is a testimony to the resilience and the power to live through the horrors based on the strength of people that existed thousands of years before the colonial interruption. This is the legacy of the banjo I choose to align with because it’s a folk instrument, and we the people are the folks. It’s not an elite club that is gatekept and coveted to feel cool. I see community as an essential part of reclaiming the banjo. Not everyone does and it shows. I’m learning to see the humanity and keep a deeper prayer for the unraveling of domination and lack true community care.\".",
