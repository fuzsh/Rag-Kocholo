        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Extreme Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXTR), a leader in high performance networking, and SignalShare, the leading provider of mobile engagement solutions for mass audiences, today announced that the University of Maryland, the newest member of the Big Ten Conference, has selected the companies to deliver high-density Wi-Fi at the Terp's XFINITY Center basketball arena and Maryland's Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium, home to the school's Division I football and lacrosse teams.\n\nMaryland selected Extreme Networks' state-of-the-art wireless solution, IdentiFi® Wireless, along with SignalShare's Live-Fi™ audience engagement platform to deliver reliable connectivity and an in-game interactive experience to Terrapins' fans. SignalShare will also handle system integration - constructing and optimizing the wireless network for the two venues - which have a combined capacity of 68,000.\n\nThe University is rolling out fan-facing Wi-Fi in stages, beginning with the XFINITY Center, which - as of November - is up-and-running for men's and women's basketball games. Next year, SignalShare and Extreme Networks will add Wi-Fi to the upper and lower bowls of Byrd Stadium in time for the 2015/'16 football season. The two companies have already installed Wi-Fi in Byrd Stadium's hospitality suites and Tyser Tower, home to luxury suites and the expanded press area.\n\n\"At Maryland, like at many universities across the country, our students live and breathe with their mobile devices,\" Maryland director of athletics Kevin Anderson said. \"We want to make sure that when students come to a game, not only can they remain connected to their favorite social networks, sites and apps, but that we can entertain them with new fan engagement initiatives, including the eventual addition of in-seat ordering, game day jersey sales and other interactive experiences and promotions. The solution from SignalShare and Extreme will elevate our game day experience to an enhanced level.\"\n\n\"We are excited to put the first Wi-Fi system in place for University of Maryland athletics,\" said Joe Costanzo, founder and CTO, SignalShare. \"The university clearly understands its demographics, and - by delivering reliable Wi-Fi over a backbone that enables new forms of mobile fan engagement - the Terrapins will surely score, not only on the field but in the stands with their fans.\"\n\n\"Maryland is riding a wave of excitement as it joins the Big 10 and it wants to capitalize by delivering a great fan experience through first-class, high-density Wi-Fi technology,\" said Norman Rice, senior vice president of corporate development, Extreme Networks. \"With the upgrade of its primary athletic facilities with speedy and reliable Wi-Fi, the University of Maryland is committed to delivering high-quality Wi-Fi connectivity to students, faculty and fans.\"\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nExtreme Networks IdentiFi® Wireless Solutions\n\nSignalShare LiveFi Audience Engagement Solutions\n\nExtreme Networks Sports & Entertainment Webpage\n\nConnect with Extreme via Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn and Google+\n\nConnect with SignalShare via Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn\n\nAbout SignalShare\n\nSignalShare specializes in mobile engagement for mass audiences.
