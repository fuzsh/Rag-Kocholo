        "text": "Erdinger Oktoberfest\n\nThis seasonal beer offers a synergistic combination of two classic German styles, Oktoberfest and wheat beer; a surprising alliance that works very well together.\n\nCloudy body with some amber hints. The head is frothy, pleasantly white and with a soft texture. Lacing starts with a series of rings but soon breaks into abstract art as the glass progresses. Residual carbonation is very lively. The wheat aroma with a fruit and clove hint combines with a strong malty flavor at the back . Erdinger Oktoberfest blends the advantages of our well known wheat beer with the traditional Oktoberfest taste. A grainy flavor and lovely hoppiness. The feel and crispness of our wheat-based speciality with an Oktoberfest body.\n\nSt George Oktoberfest\n\nSt. George Oktoberfest is a classic German style with roasted malt and caramel flavors balanced by a mild hop bitterness. This beer was traditionally served at the start of fall in celebration of the harvests. Our Oktoberfest is pale copper-color lager. It pairs well with warm pretzels and lederhosen.\n\nO’Connor Imperial Octoberfest\n\nThis Imperial Marzen-Style Lager is brewed with Pilsner, Vienna and Munich Malts; with German Magnum Hops added. Coming in at 8% ABV, this is the perfect strong autumn brew for tailgating, outdoor adventures and of course, celebrating Oktoberfest.\n\nLegend Oktoberfest\n\nPouring a deep red orange color, this lagered brew if built on a strong backbone of Vienna malts and balanced with American Tettnang, German Hallertau, and Czech Saaz hops creating a smooth drinkability.\n\nSmartmouth Princess Oktoberfest\n\nTraditionally brewed for the annual celebration of the marriage of Princess Therese to Bavarian Prince Ludwig, our version of Oktoberfest beer is named for the fair and fertile (she birthed 13 royals) Princess Elizabeth, the namesake of the river that courses through our region. This copper lager boasts the perfect union of caramel toffee sweetness with warm toasty maltiness.\n\nCenter of the Universe (COTU) Oktoberfest\n\nCenter of the Universe’s Oktoberfest is our take on the classic Munich fest biers. German Munich and Vienna malts are used to give the beer a slightly sweet and malty flavor with some toasted notes as well. Noble German hops were added during the boil, adding just enough bitterness to balance with the flavors of the malt. We then chose a Czech yeast strain that accentuated the malt and fermented nice and clean. Golden to amber in color, we think our Oktoberfest would be right at home in the festival tents of Munich. Or Virginia.\n\nStarr Hill Last Leaf\n\nA classic English Brown Ale brewed with several different malts, hopped with East Kent Goldings, and real Virginia maple syrup. The maple aroma, with subtle vanilla notes, leads into a rich and smooth body with a malty character.\n\nDevils Backbone O’Fest\n\nInspired by old school Oktoberfest bier, O’Fest will make you want to hoist a stein at your local bier hall and say “Prost!” We hear that means “cheers” in German. It’s medium-bodied, deep amber in color, and tastes like caramel and toasted dark bread thanks to the traditional blend of malts and hops. You’ll love it whether it’s October or Oktober.\n\nHarpoon Octoberfest\n\nHarpoon Octoberfest is a malty tribute to fall, balanced by a gentle hop bitterness. In keeping with tradition, it is a Marzen-style beer, brewed with abundant quantities of Munich, Chocolate, and Pale malts. Those malts provide a solid, full body and create the beer’s deep color. It is a rich, flavorful beer."
