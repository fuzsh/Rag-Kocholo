        "text": "\"On October 30, 2002, Chinese star Yao Ming made his debut in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Houston Rockets. Yao Ming was not the first Chinese player to don an NBA uniform, but he was by far the most significant in terms of both pure basketball skill and commercial potential. This historic contest against the Indiana Pacers not only marked his first NBA game, but it was the culmination of a long planned relationship between the NBA and China. Yao has made a difference on the court for his team, but his impact is far grander and wider reaching when looking at international marketing and business implications. Sponsors see Yao as the gateway to the Asian market; he is the NBA symbol for globalization. An estimated 500 million Chinese tuned into Yao’s NBA debut on television. In October of 2004 Yao was ranked 19th in the Sports Business Journal’s listing of the twenty most influential people in professional basketball. Yao was one of only two current players on the list, along with mega-superstar Shaquille O’Neal. Both China and the United States share the same capitalist dream for Yao. The whole Yao situation was compared by a Chinese diplomat as similar to that of the United States – China “ping-pong” diplomacy of the 1970s, when the two countries started to build relations through sport. This paper details the relationship that the NBA has worked so hard to cultivate with the Chinese in anticipation of someday being a major player in the region. Following that we discuss complications involved with bringing Yao to the NBA from China. Next we examine what the arrival of the Rockets center has brought to the business world in terms of commercialization. Additionally, what Yao means to the future of basketball marketing, in both the United States, but more importantly in Asia and specifically China, and its 1.3 billion residents will be discussed. \""
