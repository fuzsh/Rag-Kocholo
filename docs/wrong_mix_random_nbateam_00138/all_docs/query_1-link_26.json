        "text": "For a while now, I’ve been pushing kindness more heavily than anything else. For me, it’s a crucial part of the legacy I’m building. I want to build big businesses and buy the Jets, but I want to do it by being a good guy. I have zero interest in building the biggest building by tearing other people down. The problem is that some people see kindness as a weakness. They confuse it with being passive or being a pushover. The truth is, people who view kindness as a negative are just insecure themselves. You can only be kind if you feel that you’re coming from a place of leverage. That’s why I see kindness as a massive advantage, not a passive trait — especially if you’re a naturally “tough” person. As I go through my own life, I’m realizing more and more how kindness is such a big part of the equation. It’s not just about sales and negotiation. It’s not just about doing what you love. That’s why It breaks my heart that so many people think “nice guys finish last.” People don’t get that kindness is the best business strategy."
