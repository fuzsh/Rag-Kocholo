        "text": "When the average person thinks of Houston, Texas, they may recall the city’s preference for dirty Sprite as a choice soft drink. They might even bring up the Houston Rockets’ roster or, more recently, recite lyrics written by a certain famous stallion. However, Solange Knowles is not the average person, which explains why none of these common depictions of down south make an appearance in the Houston native’s companion film for her fourth studio album, When I Get Home. Instead, the stylistic and aesthetic choices Solange makes in her long-form music video, although deeply rooted in traditions of her birthplace, denote a sort of dream-like transcendence from the physical realities of Houston as well as an evocative reclamation of its future potential.\n\nThe synchronicity between origin and evolution is just as evident in the sonic essence of the album as it is in the film. Grounded in the enduring groove of cosmic jazz and neo-soul, Solange’s project features a number of Black musical styles, ranging from the time-honored, Houston-bred chopped-and-screwed audio manipulation tactics found on the song “My Skin My Logo” to the ultramodern, industrial synths that provide the backbone for tracks like “Sound of Rain.” The artist goes as far as to glean inspiration from others in the diaspora: my personal favorite track from the album “Binz” is reminiscent of the legend Sister Nancy’s brand of Jamaican dance-hall. To allow for such an eclectic melding of sounds, Solange ditches traditional song structure and prioritizes the creative process over its outcome.\n\nThe auteur hones in on a “Houston state of mind” as opposed to focusing on form and vocal performance. During an interview at the city’s SHAPE Community Center, one of the film’s nine premiere locations around Houston, Solange asserted that “words would have been reductive to what [she] needed to feel and express.” Thus, on its own, the album has been regarded as thematically ambiguous but, when experienced in tandem with the film, it is made apparent that Solange’s thesis is about recognizing the beauty in a Black southern woman’s idiosyncratic experience of returning to her home. Such a sonically exploratory and personally significant album is not necessarily made for all to relate to; rather, Solange was simply aiming to encapsulate the feelings derived from making music in the place that made her who she is today — Houston. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nOn “Can I Hold the Mic (interlude),” Solange’s voice pierces through ambient noise to proclaim that she cannot exist as a singular expression of herself. These are the musings and meditations of a polymath. Solange is as prolific in a variety of other artistic mediums, including performance art and architecture, as she is in music. And while the album’s thirteen songs and six interludes seamlessly flow into one another, allowing for the listening experience to mirror the artist’s free-form creative approach, fans are given a much deeper insight into Solange’s psyche and purpose by examining the film.\n\nIn a time where music videos are generally regarded as added value to an album’s stand-alone promise, Solange packs the most punch into the otherworldly visual element of her project. The album provides the perfect soundtrack for the Houstonian’s lucid dream though. In the opening scene, Solange beckons the viewer in by playing the record’s first track “Things I Imagined,” which repeats the phrase “I saw things, I imagined.” Repetition is employed throughout the project to signify a fixation on a feeling, a mood, a state of mind. Initially seeming out of place to me, the album’s introduction obviously serves as an invocation of Solange’s cosmic trip back home when placed in the context of the film. We see a man masked in diamonds, a figment of Solange’s imagination, in this opening scene. He is meant to represent a sort of spiritual guide, as she praise dances alongside him in an ensemble made of the same reflective material as his. Seeing to it that the importance of faith in her life is pronounced in the film, Solange recurrently incorporates symbols of divinity.\n\nReligion and spirituality have always been a huge part of the Black experience in America. “Almeda,” one of album’s standout tracks that is named after Almeda Road in Third Ward, Houston and features highly-revered Atlanta musician Playboi Carti, acts as a new-age Negro spiritual, rejoicing in Black expressive culture with its insistent lyrics: “Black skin, Black braids/ Black waves, Black days/ Black baes, Black days/ These are Black-owned things/ Black faith still can’t be washed away.” The sequence of scenes accompanying the song add another dimension to its vocal content as they depict Black people in a variety of settings, cutting from two ominous figures wearing bolo ties in an empty office building to a shot of women sporting gravity-defying protective hairstyles to an aerial view of a Black cowboy on his horse gallivanting around a fleet of Deloreans.\n\nRelatedly, that scene is one of many instances during which Solange, in referencing the tradition of her city, presents an image of the American cowboy that isn’t depicted in mainstream media. A well-established motif in the film, Black cowboys appear often, showcasing not only the versatility in their craft but also their ubiquity within Houston (and the rest of the American West). Case in point, the visual that corresponds with Solange’s somber yet uplifting song “Time (is)” takes place at a rodeo: a group of cowboys cheer on a fellow rider as he tries to overcome a bucking bull. The clip is stylized in slow motion, highlighting the physical exertion displayed by the bull and the man alike. Solange once said in an interview that “[seeing] what [the cowboys] are willing to do to their bodies for the sake of entertainment… is something [she] can relate to.” Being that Solange is more so a performance artist than she is a pop star, the notion of art for art’s sake resonates deeply with her and her work.\n\nAlthough Solange is known to inundate her pieces with symbolism and metaphors, at several points in When I Get Home the artist includes images based solely on the grounds that they are aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Movement art definitely finds its home in the film. Obviously inspired by postmodern choreography, the film features choreographed sequences during which Black characters make expressive, gestural movements, purely for the sake of getting into their own bodies. Solange is no stranger to this herself. Circling back to the track “Binz,” the part of the film correlated with this song shows the singer triumphantly twerking to her own airy vocals. Once again, the expansiveness of Black expressivity is exhibited, as we see Solange sporting a snakeskin full-body jumper, wearing sexy lingerie, and getting cozy in her sweatpants all while emphatically mouthing her braggadocious lyrics: “Get a presidential suite, leave with they linen/ In a Rolls that’s rented, windows tinted.” Throughout the film, the artist effortlessly places what is considered to be high art in conversation with Black culture, and never fails to bring others into the discussion.\n\nFor instance, Solange does not reserve displays of Black Girl Magic for herself. She includes shot of Black women feeling themselves, literally and figuratively speaking, during shots attributed to her sensuous track “Way To The Show.” In watching the film, we are also able to identify the women speaking at the beginning of “Can I Hold the Mic (interlude)” as none other than Diamond and Princess of the influential rap group Crime Mob. Moreover, she pays homage to another iconic Houstonian sister duo — Beyonce is Solange’s biological sister for those of you who live under a rock — by sampling clips of Debbie Allen and Phylicia Rashad on “S McGregor (interlude).” Furthermore, just as she celebrates past legends with these interludes, Solange summons future generations as well, as Black youth are depicted during “Not Screwed (interlude)” and her own son is given a production credit on the track “Nothing Without Intention (interlude).”\n\nAspiring to a limitless future for all Black people, Solange draws upon the cultural aesthetic of Afro-futurism in When I Get Home. She presents the viewer with an alternate, sci-fi universe, but not that of the Wakandian tradition. Instead, for the song “Sound of Rain,” the visual is set in a coliseum-like amphitheater where scantily clad men dance provocatively and a naked cowboy gyrates on a flying horse creature — stylized in surrealist animation. This sequence comes directly after a shot depicting the text of “The Cowboy’s Prayer,” a religious entreaty made by herdsman asking for safety and salvation. The juxtaposition of these estranged representations reveals Solange’s aspiration for a world in which Black men are free to exist wherever they choose within the masculine-feminine continuum.\n\nAnd still, her dreams for the future do not stop here. In one of the most compelling segments of the film, we find a female protagonist, operating on and then lugging around a spaceship console. Here, a Black woman is literally building “the future” and leading the viewer directly into it thereafter. The song playing at this moment boasts “Niggas play games when you flex/ Niggas throw stones, they gon’ feel it on they face,” suggesting that men may feel intimidated by women forging their own paths but ultimately it is only a disservice to themselves. After all, the future is female!"
