        "text": "Heading into the 2022-23 season, the NBA has more incredible talent and elite athleticism than ever before. As opening night approaches, we take a look at five of the game's most electrifying players.\n\nJa Morant\n\nWhen you think of electric players, perhaps none come to mind before Morant. The 23-year-old took the league by storm last season, averaging 27.4 points en route to winning the Most Improved Player award. His dazzling crossovers and high-flying dunks made highlight reels all year.\n\nMorant's 52-point performance - a Memphis Grizzlies franchise record - against the San Antonio Spurs in February was unforgettable. His strong play carried over to the playoffs, where he unleashed a jaw-dropping dunk against the Minnesota Timberwolves and scored 47 points in a game against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe Grizzlies star is an absolute terror for defenses. His quickness makes it nearly impossible to stay in front of him on the perimeter, but once Morant gets in the lane, he can rise up and force defenders to choose between fouling him or being on a poster. This season should be more of the same for Morant and Memphis, one of the league's most exciting up-and-coming teams.\n\nAnthony Edwards\n\nEdwards might be the only player who can claim to be a better in-game dunker than Morant. The T-Wolves swingman is a budding star, perhaps the most likely player to make an All-Star debut in 2023. He showcased his smooth perimeter scoring in the 2022 postseason, shooting above 40% from beyond the arc and averaging 25.2 points in Minnesota's six-game defeat to Memphis.\n\nThe 2020 No. 1 pick's slashing ability sets him apart. He stands about 6-foot-6, and his 41-inch vertical makes him a threat to throw it down over just about anyone when he drives to the rim. Edwards can get an entire arena buzzing with his otherworldly displays of athleticism.\n\nThe addition of Rudy Gobert should help Minnesota become one of the most improved teams this season and a potential contender for home-court advantage in the first round. Gobert will be the backbone of the defense, but Edwards will make this squad so fun to watch.\n\nTrae Young\n\nYoung isn't a high flier, but he's consistently one of the most entertaining players under the rim. He's a wizard in the pick-and-roll, using nasty crossovers and change-of-pace moves to keep defenders off-balance. The Atlanta Hawks point guard is also one of the NBA's best lob-throwers, often setting up John Collins and Clint Capela for emphatic alley-oops. In fact, he's one of the league's best passers, period. Young finished top five in assists per game in each of the past four seasons.\n\nThe 24-year-old has nearly unlimited shooting range. His shooting ability forces defenders to play him well beyond the 3-point arc, opening up driving lanes to loft his patented floaters with a perfect touch or toss those lob passes to Atlanta's big men.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating thing to watch with the Hawks this season will be Young's fit with new backcourt mate Dejounte Murray. Young and Murray are both used to having the ball in their hands on most possessions, and both have made All-Star teams playing that way. Young will have to adjust to working off the ball more often next to Murray, but that isn't a bad thing. If he becomes more of a threat away from the ball, Young will be even tougher to stop when defenders scramble to close out.\n\nZion Williamson\n\nWilliamson broke out in a big way in the 2020-21 campaign, rampaging through opposing defenses on his way to 27 points per game. He shot a remarkable 61.1% from the field on high volume, earning an All-Star appearance.\n\nUnfortunately, the New Orleans Pelicans star missed all of last season due to a foot injury. Now healthy, Williamson enters a much better situation in New Orleans than he found himself in the last time he played. The Pelicans have loaded up with the perimeter shooting of CJ McCollum and wing defense of Herb Jones, perfect complementary players to amplify Williamson's abilities and help hide his weaknesses.\n\nA healthy Williamson is a matchup nightmare. He's a bowling ball of a power forward who can steamroll defenders with his shoulders or just elevate over them to finish at the rim. With his 6-foot-6, 280-pound frame, Williamson's incredible leaping ability seems to defy physics.\n\nJalen Green\n\nGreen is the youngest player on this list. After a shaky start to his rookie campaign, the 20-year-old averaged 20.3 points on a stellar 46.7% from the field over his final 34 games. Green's efficiency was especially impressive considering the difficulty of his shot attempts. He's essentially been the Houston Rockets' top scoring option since the moment they drafted him.\n\nThe 2021 No. 2 pick showed signs of brilliance down the stretch, including a 41-point performance against the Hawks. Green is a three-level scorer; he made 38.5% of his 3-pointers during that 34-game stretch, can create his own midrange jumpers, and can get downhill to attack the rim. Green's wicked ball-handling skills and top-tier athleticism make for an entertaining watch.\n\nThe Rockets have a long way to go before competing in the postseason again, but Green is already one of the NBA's most electrifying young stars."
