        "text": "Throughout my career I’ve been lucky enough to play in venues of all different shapes and sizes, from tiny clubs to massive stadiums all over the world. Without the grassroots clubs, pubs and music venues my career could have been very different.\n\nI support Music Venue Trust because artists need places to start out, develop and work on their craft and small venues have been the cornerstone for this. If we don’t support live music at this level then the future of music in general is in danger.\n\nSir Paul McCartney\n\nThe UK grassroots music circuit is more than just small local venues. It is absolutely crucial to emerging talent. It is the vanguard of independent expression and free speech outside the corporate and commerce-based music industry. It is a labour of love for those who run the venues and it is a rite of passage for new acts cutting their teeth.\n\nWithout this community we would never have gotten our music into the wider world at large. We have played hundreds of these gigs over the last 2 decades, each one unique and intimate in a way that only these smaller venues can provide. We also run a couple of our own. Long live the MVT, long live grassroots venues and long live new music!\n\nThe Libertines\n\nPhoto © Murdo Macleod\n\nWe are in a completely different music industry to the one I came into many years ago with just my guitar, my amp and a nice line in plaid shirts. I think it’s probably safe to say that without small venues there would’ve been no Billy Bragg. How else was an artist who was never going to get onto daytime radio or a major record label going to find an audience and build their own reality? Some things are as true now as back then and remain unchanged – the need for small venues up and down the country to support new bands/artists whilst they learn their trade and find their tribe is still top of that list.\n\nBilly Bragg\n\nWere it not for presence of the Tunbridge Wells Forum while I was growing up, I very much doubt that I would be a professional musician now. The same would be said of countless other individuals who have been inspired and nurtured by similar community live music venues – Southampton Joiners, Bristol Thekla, Oxford Jericho, Manchester Night and Day, Hull Welly, Newcastle Cluny, etc. The UK music industry needs to do more to support its live grassroots, and government needs to recognise that the health and future prosperity of this important British Industry relies on us nurturing these seeds. Very often the commercial value of the property outweighs its commercial value as a music venue, but never its social or cultural value, which is what the Music Venue Trust aims to protect.\n\nJeremy Pritchard\n\nEverything Everything\n\nIt’s massively important that we support Grassroots Music Venues across the country. The reason why is simple… if we lose these venues, we lose our future home-grown talent. In order for artists to be able to perform on the highest stages they need to learn their craft by playing in these smaller Grassroots Venues on their way up. I personally learned my crowd control and stage presence over a period of 10 years in such venues. To not support them means that we’re not supporting culture and let’s not forget heritage.\n\nSuccessful artists bring tourism, revenue and other business to their local towns and cities further down the line once they reach a certain level of success. So, for councils to exploit this at one end with hotels and museums it seems idiotic and bizarre for them not to support at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nOne of the main reasons I wanted to be a patron was because I through my years of being a musician I have formed great relationships with owners of venues and I see first-hand the struggles they face, personally working for 9 years as an electrician in a small family run business I also had my shares of dealing with similar pressures that all grassroots businesses face in the modern world.\n\nSecondly, I was lucky to have loads of great venues to play at in Liverpool when I was coming up, and I want the next generation of musicians to have the same advantages and opportunities. Lastly, the socialism that I believe in teaches that you can do as well as you want as long as you give back to the others who need help. And I’d really like to practice what I preach as much as possible.\n\nJamie Webster\n\nPopular music is an art form. Until it starts to take itself seriously as such, on a par with theatre, opera and classical music, it is unlikely to be deemed so by others. I have been performing in public since the 1960s. I may have picked up a thing or two along the way. I try to put on a very good show. However, venue facilities are often woefully short of what is on offer in Europe. The industry has made money, but this has almost never been reinvested into the grassroots. And there’s absolutely nothing from the Arts Council. We trade on the cultural capital of popular music, but seem to feel musicians do better if mistreated. I’m still offered sub standard dressing rooms, as if it were some sort of rite of passage. Give us the opportunity to do good work and we will.\n\nRhoda Dakar\n\n©Delphine Ghosarossian\n\nI am honoured to be a Patron of the Music Venue Trust. Every musician’s primal instinct is to perform, and those baby steps require a nurturing environment in which to blossom. Music venues around the world from the local church hall to the stadium play an invaluable role in the creative process, allowing an artist’s confidence, technique and craft to flourish. But it does not stop there. Every artist will return to venues of size and location continually throughout their lives, renewing bonds with loyal fans as well as forging new creative avenues. Many of us return with great affection to stages we have trodden many times before, often encountering the same dedicated promoters and sound engineers, often combined into several passionate roles. We sigh at the loss of a venue not through nostalgia or sentimentality, but for the missed opportunities for ourselves as well as future generations. Protecting the network of grassroots venues is to secure livelihoods, access to the arts and to art itself.\n\nBernard Butler\n\nWe wouldn’t be making music if our local Grassroots Venues didn’t give us a chance to cut our teeth on their stages. We gave a demo tape to a venue near my house, they put us on as an opening act a couple of times… eventually we got spotted by our manager at one of the shows, and it all spiralled out of control from there. But yep – that’s where it all began for us. I’ve seen so many of my favourite musicians start out in those venues and go on to wonderful things. It would be terribly sad to lose that platform.\n\nDave Bayley\n\nGlass Animals\n\nGrassroots venues are so important because if we didn’t have them, we wouldn’t have music.\n\nMusic is still alive and this is why venues like this are so important, because if we didn’t have venues I wouldn’t be about, and I know a lot of others wouldn’t be about.\n\nThere are so many artists, so many genres of music, so many different people that are wanting or needing to be found. You don’t need to be glued to your phone to try and find the next big thing because, trust me, the next big things are in venues like this. So, get off your phone, go out and watch and listen to live music, and enjoy it.\n\nTom Grennan\n\nI have a page from a waitresses notebook, the numbered kind, with “Mr Soft £20 received Jimmy”. It’s the landlord of The Corner Pin in Stubbins and it was the very first time our band that eventually became ‘elbow’ got paid for performing. The rush it gave you. it’s like, “Wow!” Even just £20. People are prepared to pay to listen to what we love doing. It pushes you forward.\n\nWithout these pubs and clubs, musicians don’t develop. They don’t get a taste of what it would be like to live as a full time musician. And without musicians, you’ve got no new music and without new music it’s a very bland and shitty world.\n\nSo that’s why we support Music Venue Trust. Because everyone needs a place to start out and you also need to learn how to be in an audience and a lot of those small venues are the first ones that people visit as a music lover.\n\nSo for artists and music lovers, these Grassroots places are absolutely essential.\n\nLet’s look after them.\n\nGuy Garvey\n\nElbow\n\nI am one of the privileged few who has been blessed with the opportunity to travel the world and have a platform on which my voice is heard and minds are met with a plethora of diverse people; after 8 years of playing venues across the UK, some tiny, some ornate, some dank and so on; there is one residing factor that runs through all the stages we have played and that is Community. The communities that have supported us as a band and weary travellers are built from hard-working and passionate individuals that collectively want for a brighter existence. Without those hard-working communities there would be no place for the audience, and without the audience there would be no meetings of minds for the artists to flourish and learn. The commune of music is where love is born and where revolutions ignite, so for that we will always be grateful to the earnest people that house it and defend their vital walls. All is love.\n\nJoe Talbot, Idles\n\nIdles\n\nSupporting the Live Music scene, and in particular supporting your local music venue is something that both myself and all my Skindred band mates are all extremely passionate about. If you come to a Skindred show you will usually hear Benj tell everyone in the room to support their local venues and to support live music on a local level. There are 4 individuals in Skindred all with different local venues that mean the world to them. Mine is Exeter Cavern.\n\nIt was playing these great rooms that initially gave us, along with many other acts, our start. For that we are eternally grateful. We would work there, play shows there and hang out there. The support these venues give young creative people is astonishing. With so many great local venues having to close down in recent years I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that people keep supporting live music on a local level. Plus there are so many great new bands out there to check out.\n\nWe have just finished a 32 date UK tour and played at some amazing venues. These venues are the lifeblood of the UK music scene so keep buying tickets to see music of all genres at your local venues and help keep them in business and music alive!\n\nArya Goggin\n\nSkindred\n\nGrassroots Music Venues are the places where you get to discover new artists supporting the person you went to see. It’s the place where you go again as a punter because you get to know the owners and the staff. On the other side, as an artist touring, they are ports in the seas of motorways and hours on the road. I go back to some venues that I’ve played at for years and feel the warmth from promoters and audiences. It’s like shopping local or supporting small business. You see the heart and the love that goes into them.\n\nGigs are beautiful events that are a one time thing. It’s a kind of magic really that you can get to play and sing and connect in these places. They are so important to me as a player and listener. Music Venue Trust plays a huge part in supporting and promoting and I’m overjoyed to put my name to the good work they do.\n\nKathryn Williams\n\nLike so many bands, Public Service Broadcasting relied on Grassroots Music Venues in our formative, early years to hone and practice our stage show. In the process we moved from a very static, one-man show with no video element at all to the multi-screen, multi-member outfit we are today. Without those venues at which we could practice, experiment and – crucially – get in front of people, I’m certain we wouldn’t have a career in music. I am very proud to have to have been asked to become a MVT patron and as a band we will do our best to pay back our debt to Grassroots Venues, and give artists and bands the chance to find their feet (and voices) the way we found ours.\n\nPublic Service Broadcasting\n\nAs a music artist, you want the best for your career. You want to perform at the massive venues, the arenas to thousands of people. But that sort of thing doesn’t just happen overnight. It is and should be a journey, a journey that small music venues are an integral part of. In fact, some of my most memorable performances have been in the more intimate venues, with a couple hundred people enjoying the show.\n\nHaving just completed a self-managed and self-funded tour I am painfully aware of the scarcity of small music venues across the country. That’s why the work of the Music Venue Trust is so important, not just for protecting our existing venues but also for fostering the right environments in order to bring new venues into existence. I want to make sure there’s always somewhere dope to perform and that’s why I am honoured to be a patron for the MVT.\n\nShaoDow\n\nI have spent most of my adult life in Grassroots Music Venues becoming part of the communities that develop around them. For years & years I have stood on small stages all over the UK and played my heart out. In the early days my performances were pretty awful and I played to empty rooms. But the Grassroots Venues always gave me a space and platform to keep coming back despite the fact they must have been making a loss on the door and at the bar.\n\nIt is therefore thanks to these venues that I learned how to be a performer, how to hold a stage & carry a room with me whilst I deliver the songs I have written without fear or inhibition. To be clear these aren’t skills I learned in any school or extra-curricular class, I have them because of all the quirky & stubbornly passionate people running these gorgeous, unique and utterly brilliant spaces.\n\nSo to all the Grassroots Music Venues, thank you for the friendships, memories and the education. To Music Venue Trust who are fighting hard to keep this sector surviving, consider me an advocate, campaigner & defender, poised & ready to do what I can for the sake of music.\n\nHannah White\n\nIt is my honour, indeed duty, to be a patron of the Music Venue Trust. Right now bands and artists are more reliant on live music to build and support their musical careers than ever before. Small venues are where most musicians start their careers, develop their songs, and first connect to their audiences. They are our superstar nurseries and as such are absolutely vital to the future success of live music in the UK and Ireland. We all know the problems small music venues are facing, every month seems to bring the news that we’ve lost another icon of the music scene to developers, planning issues or due to declining audiences. But perhaps with proper support and investment we can protect the venues that we have left, and ensure they can start many more bands and artists on a path to success.\n\nNeil Hannon\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n\nWithout Grassroots Music Venues we, The Wombats, would never have had a hope at becoming the band we are today. We spent 3 years playing tiny venues all over the country, sleeping on promoters’ floors and having adventure after adventure. These local, small venues are nearly always run by music lovers who want to be a part of the local music scene in their town/city and to give bands of all sizes, whether it’s their 1st or 50th show, an opportunity to perform. Without these venues, new local bands wouldn’t have a chance to learn important lessons in live performance skills and all the fun that goes along with it! We recently did a week of shows in conjunction with Music Venue Trust and had such a good time. The atmosphere at every show was electric. All the promoters we met were so happy to see so many beaming smiles and mosh pits and were telling us how much MVT help them and how difficult it can be as a small venue these days. I think these places are one of the most important crucibles of music throughout the world and need to be treated as such by people and governments alike. Without them, the British music scene and the musicians of tomorrow will not have the opportunities they need to hone their talent. We are very proud to be involved and look forward to doing more shows with MVT in the future!\n\nThe Wombats\n\nI’ve been very fortunate to experience all sizes of venues, both with The Magic Numbers and also with my solo projects. We live in a different age now to when we/the band started, and in many ways those intimate venues are more important than ever. It was where it all started for us, the foundations of our music.\n\nThere’s nothing quite like standing on a stage playing and singing your songs, and hearing others sing them back to you… But there’s nothing quite like doing this in an intimate venue, filled with music lovers who want to be there, to hear every word, experience something special together and surrender to those pin-drop moments. Grassroots Music Venues have and will always be an integral part of our musical culture, they are fundamental to the process of becoming an artist. As a music lover they are also my favourite places to go and see live music.\n\nMany Grassroots Music Venues work tirelessly to promote and support artists they believe in, it’s not done from a money-making belief, which is the same spirit with which we create music… We all do it because we love it. It is an unspoken way of life. I am very proud to be a patron of Music Venue Trust and support their efforts entirely.\n\nMichele Stodart\n\nWe met each other as solo artists, playing the underground music scene in London. Spiritual Bar is an intimate folk/blues venue in Camden founded and run by the legend, Rafael Pesce. Since it opened, it has been a stage, living room, hangout and a home to both musicians and lovers of music. We’ve met some of our dearest friends there and it’s how we met each other. The bar survives on people’s love of music and desire to be part of something special. Especially in such a big and competitive city as London, places like these are gems and need all the help they can to stay open and thrive.\n\nTogether and apart, we’ve played so many unforgettable venues across the country just like Spiritual Bar, without which some of the biggest musicians throughout history wouldn’t get a chance to dig in and develop their craft, night after night. In our case, this has been the most important part of our development. From when we first started, we’ve played over 100 shows a year, sometimes to just the bar man, sometimes to thousands, and we’ve built a following through playing at independent music venues, upon which our career can grow.\n\nThe relationships, memories and comfort that can be found in these venues are priceless. It can be a lifeline for communities to have a creative, inclusive hub and we will continue to do all we can to keep these magical places in existence.\n\nFerris & Sylvester\n\nThere are many great small rooms in this country who do great work with limited resources, and they should be applauded and supported. There are also great bands, great musicians and great audiences who love music and deserve the best. It definitely seems a shame that when you ask musicians around the world about the touring conditions in the UK, backstage, PA system quality… you don’t get a more positive response. I come from years of touring the UK and experiencing the worse and the best, it isn’t a secret for anybody: there is still progress to be made.\n\nThe music industry can definitely affect a change. Labels, managers, big promoters, booking agents, artists and bigger live venues can group together and start to repair the UK’s reputation in live music by supporting initiatives like the Music Venue Trust.\n\nSavages\n\nGrassroots Music Venues are the lifeblood of the UK music scene and I’m absolutely delighted to join Music Venue Trust as a patron, but also deeply, deeply worried about what is currently unfolding around the country. Venues have been shut for months now and the bills are mounting up – MVT have been shouting about this loudly. It was heart-breaking to see the troubles at beloved Manchester venues the Deaf Institute and Gorilla – I was so pleased that someone stepped in so quickly to preserve their future, but I know that many venues around the country will not be so lucky.\n\nI will be doing all I can to amplify their voice, the work of MVT has never been as important as it is now as the whole of the live sector is staring down the barrel of a virus shaped gun.\n\nRen Harvieu\n\nGrassroots Venues come in many guises, but the thing that they have in common is that they are of and for the community that surrounds them. The link between being a fan and a performer. Every successful artist will have a story of Grassroots Venues that were important to them in the early days, and many that still hold relevance to them now. The accessibility and affordability of these venues means that there is less of a divide between performer and audience. Indeed, many audience members will be performers themselves. It is difficult to put into words why these venues are so special, but that is why they are special!\n\nMr Scruff\n\nFor the last 24 years I have been lucky enough to perform yet also attend so many of my favourite shows in small venues across the UK; these Grassroots Venues are the beating hearts that pump the lifeblood through our musical communities, the springboards for your favourite new band, the spark where it all begins.\n\nWithout these pubs, clubs and venues existing, the live scene as we know it will be diminished forever. Can you even imagine a world without live music? Without the sheer joy, excitement and glorious sense of solidarity it brings to us? We MUST fight to save these venues and many of the people’s livelihoods who work there. It is our duty as artists to all club together and put on a united front, for the sake of the future of live music. Thank you to Music Venue Trust, it is an honour to be asked to be a patron and I vow to help them and Grassroots venues in whatever way I can.\n\nEd Harcourt\n\nJames Joseph: If it wasn’t for discovering local bands in Cardiff’s Grassroots Venues, I don’t think I’d be the person I am today. I was so lost at age 14, until I found live music. I think live music is the ultimate unifier, the sense of community at a gig is unrivalled and right now community is so important.\n\nJames Biss: The most important and inspiring thing to me is seeing a band play live, especially up close in a small venue. There’s just something raw and real that you don’t get outside that experience, it’s the number one thing everyone is missing in music right now, which needs to be protected.\n\nJames & The Cold Gun\n\nI’ve always maintained that The Wedding Present are, essentially, a “live” band. By that I mean that one of the main reasons I started playing music in the first place is that I was really excited and inspired by seeing other people’s concerts. So, when it came to my turn, it was incredibly fortunate that there was a network of small venues across the country where we were able to play live. In those venues we honed our craft and developed our style… and obviously enjoyed some memorable nights in the process. And the same applies to countless other artists, of course, which is why these places are so vital. There’s nothing like an intimate venue to experience the raw energy of a band.\n\nDavid Gedge\n\nThe Wedding Present\n\nWhen we first formed The Jellyman’s Daughter we cut our teeth gigging in a wide array of Edinburgh’s amazing venues. Getting these first few gigs under our belt was essential in the development of our sound and learning how to perform live. Sadly so many of those venues have had to shut their doors. In the last few years alone we’ve lost The Electric Circus, Studio 24 and The Picture House (which turned into a Spoons) to name just a few that were once the heart and soul of our wee music scene. Also, when touring internationally, approachable independent venues are vital in providing a platform for us to reach new audiences.\n\nIf we don’t save these venues, where are up-and-coming bands going to get their start, and how can we nourish and promote fresh new talent? It is really important to us that we do all we can to help Grassroots Venues thrive in what is now a really tough climate.\n\nThe Jellyman’s Daughter\n\n©Simon M Scott\n\nIt’s an absolute surprise and honour to be invited to be a Patron for the Music Venue Trust. When I looked at who else they have as patrons I was in shock. The past few weeks have been difficult for absolutely everyone on the planet and I was thinking of ways I could do something positive and all I really have to do that with is music.\n\nWhen I came across the MVT and found out what they do for Grassroots Venues it was a no brainer to put something together to help them and spread awareness. Sofathon Singalong started out as a little idea to play an online gig and get some of the people I know in other bands involved and it obviously struck a chord. It’s unreal that enough artists stepped up to turn it into a 24 hour online festival in just two weeks. Some of Scotland’s best talents all pulled together to create an amazing live music event from our own homes with hundreds of thousands of people joining in from theirs.\n\nEvery artist starts off in these Grassroots Venues, including all the other MVT patrons, however big they’ve got, and without them you have no music business. I’m glad to be part of such a great initiative and will do my bit to ensure that the venues survive and can have us all back playing in front of people before too long.\n\nLuke La Volpe\n\n“Grassroots venues are probably the most important thing in the music industry in the UK. Every music fan you can imagine has a “I remember seeing [this huge band] back at my local venue and I can’t believe how huge they are now” story – and that’s such a big part of the magic of live music. From my experience, Grassroots Venues put so much love and care into their programming, trying to both understand their local area, and push the boundaries a bit so that people can have really exciting new music on their doorstep. Without this kind of venue, people like me would never had their first few shows. Even now, after opening for Elton John for a year, so many of the venues I play are smaller independent and Grassroots Venues, and so often they’re the most rewarding. Britain has so much talent, and there’s no way for that to shine without the initial platform that these venues provide.”\n\nBright Light Bright Light\n\nThroughout the U.K. we have played many great shows in rooms and venues both as The Pearl Harts and for other musical projects. These venues have a deep musical history engrained into them and hold the raw spirit of what made us fall in love with live music. We hope that this raw spirit lives on today in our own music at our own shows thanks to these stages.\n\nMany of these venues are supported by local music fans who work tirelessly and often as volunteers to keep the live music scene alive. They are the life blood of this industry and are crucial to bands like ourselves to continue to develop and grow our craft. We’re proud to be patrons of the Music Venues Trust.\n\nThe Pearl Harts\n\nEven before I worked in them, I loved seeing bands in small, independent venues. Becoming a promoter in spaces like London’s Barfly or Garage (and many others, now closed) wasn’t just a springboard for me but also the DJs, bands, bookers, cashiers, sound & lighting engineers and flyer-ers who worked on the club nights, many of whom have gone on to bigger roles in the live industry.\n\nAs a DJ, with the experience and exposure I got at these Grassroots Music Venues, I went on to – and still do – work with and play at so many other amazing independent venues of all sizes, as well as Festivals, around the UK and abroad.\n\nGMVs are essential for supporting the next wave of artists – bands and DJs alike. And although it’s always been hard, it’s never been harder than now. The creation and growing strength of the MVT may well be the best thing to have happened for GMVs and the best chance of keeping these vital spaces alive. I’m honoured to have become a Patron.\n\nJeff Automatic\n\nIt’s a complete honour for us to be made patrons of this incredibly important charity to help campaign for the protection and funding of Grassroots Music Venues. The thought of losing venues across the country due to our politicians failing to prioritise the value in arts and culture is a real concern for us as a touring band, and we need to make sure the venues and the people that work in the sector are protected so that there is an industry to come back to. We will do everything in our power to support the amazing work that Music Venue Trust do behind the scenes.\n\nDaniel McCarthy & Jim Higson\n\nKAWALA\n\nWe both started playing live music at local venues from the age of 15, and the UK’s Grassroots Venues have been essential to our journey. We toured relentlessly around the UK in the back of cars and vans for ten years before Oh Wonder, and these small venues helped give us a voice and an invaluable opportunity to experiment, learn and develop into the artists that we are today. There is nothing more powerful than being on stage and looking out into the eyes of the crowd, and these intimate rooms are the perfect place to connect with an audience. Without them there would be no playground for young musicians and developing artists who need a stage to get their foot in the door of the music world. Our favourite shows still tend to be in smaller rooms, where the atmosphere is electric. These venues need to live on and keep their doors open to up and coming talent across the UK.\n\nOh Wonder\n\n©Euan Robertson\n\nMusic Venue Trust is such an important organisation for everyone in the music industry. Whether you are a songwriter, musician, agent, promoter or manager then it’s in your best interest to make sure Grassroots Music Venues are thriving. Without them a lot of people wouldn’t be able to tour in the UK. When I was 14 years old I started searching for local open mic nights near my hometown of Dundee and pretty much all of the venues I played in were small and independently owned. It’s at those venues where I found my love for performing. It created a good environment where I could really discover what music I wanted to make and those early experiences helped me to build my confidence. Being able to develop skills in small venues around Scotland inspired me to take my live show all over the world.I don’t want to imagine a music scene without Grassroots Venues at the heart of it, and that’s why I’m so excited to be a patron of Music Venues Trust. The success of these venues is crucial to aspiring musicians all over the country.\n\nBe Charlotte\n\nThese are all bands I saw before they were signed:\n\nSeymour at The Oval Cricketers (before they had the decency to change their name to Blur). Manic Street Preachers at the Bull & Gate in Kentish Town.\n\nElastica at The Camden Falcon.\n\nRadiohead at the Islington Powerhouse.\n\nAgain, at The Falcon, a small band called Coldplay.\n\nYou know what connects all those gigs?\n\nAll those venues are now shut.\n\nAll those opportunities are gone.\n\nEvery town should have a variety of places where people can go. Every town should have somewhere independent of thought and spirit to provide an alternative place where people can meet and make new friends, and come away feeling engaged and inspired. Every community wants a place that it can be proud of. Somewhere which represents them.\n\nThere’s all this amazing music and art which needs a place to go. It might be new music, it might be niché music but it deserves to be seen and heard. I think it’s critical that we encourage people who go against the grain or experiment and give them a space.\n\nI applaud the Music Venue Trust for taking taking on this job. Socially, culturally, creatively, we need venues. There are thousands of bands out there and thousands of music fans who’ve had their lives changed by going to Grassroots Music Venues. Let’s never stop remembering how important they are.\n\nSteve Lamacq\n\nBBC Radio 6 Music\n\nSeeing my first LIVE gig in a small venue as a teenager was a total revelation. As much as large concert halls or sports arenas can be fun; it was seeing the blood, sweat and tears of someone rockin’ out up close and personal, that really struck me. The intimacy, the energy, the electricity… the sheer visceral thrill. Since then I’ve played hundreds of small venues as a musician, touring across the UK and into Europe; and attended many more as a fanboy, journalist and a BBC Radio presenter. Grassroots venues are like petri-dishes, breeding the next generation of LIVE musician and allowing them to make mistakes and cut their teeth. Without these places, performers cannot properly master their craft and move on to mid-sized and larger rooms. To their credit, shows that small touring venues book and promote are always the most exciting, experimental and cutting-edge on the circuit. It’s cross-genre too – indie, punk, metal, acoustic, electronic, reggae, hip-hop and more all find their feet in these hallowed spaces; and for that we should give thanks. Even today, I’d far rather see an act play a wee, sweaty room than watch them on a screen at the side of a festival stage. Music is in the blood of people in all 4 corners of the UK, and our culture draws fans and followers from all corners of the globe to experience it. For the sake of local musicians who perform on a weekly basis, and the millions of punters who experience those performances; it’s a travesty that many are dwindling away and indeed closing. MVT is doing a fantastic job of raising awareness for these types of clubs, pubs and venues and I am delighted to be a patron. Let’s celebrate and champion these essential music hubs across the UK!\n\nVic Galloway\n\nBBC Radio Scotland & 6Music\n\nThe whole tapestry of my life changed due to my first experiences of live music at festivals and venues. I wouldn’t have the same friends, family, job, memories or drive – it made me who I am today. I’ve worked every aspect of the live event – promoter, bar, door, DJ, reviewer, host, and even played one special gig with a band! Yep, just the one!\n\nEarly gigs are a stamp on your brain more vivid than a gig you’ve been to more recently. It has a lasting impression because the intensity, fervour, community, and sense of belonging to a place and a people – it’s such a rare chemistry. Dark, sweaty venues, and small, intense gigs are indeed marmite to people, but to me, growing up in a rural area without a venue, hearing live and loud, cutting edge music, was a connection I’d never felt before. I felt a sense of belonging to my own unique Welsh culture and a gateway to others – an openness for accepting and embracing a melting pot of differences. Hip-hop, drum n bass, touring bands, obscure electro, you name it, I’ve seen it, danced, sung, flung myself around and bought the t-shirt!\n\nIt’s a unique culture, hard to bottle, and MVT have helped bring awareness to its place in the Music Industry ecosystem, and the cultural poverty we’d face in the UK without these venues. In Europe venues enjoy more cultural protection, support and status, allowing the venues to do more for the creative community that surrounds them, becoming a cultural hub for ideas, talent, art, music, film, photography, street art, and all the spiralling micro business that come from this hub – food, fashion, student economy, night time economy, wellbeing, DJs, taxis, poster art, performance, technical crew, touring talent, record labels, promoters, radio DJs … the list goes on!\n\nI’m writing this after months of Covid-19 crisis, with little reprieve ahead. We’re facing an unprecedented threat to the UKs unique, organic, and unmatched music legacy – these venues are the heartbeat of our cities and our culture, and we wait with baited breath to see if they can make it through, the void in our landscape without them doesn’t bear thinking about! To all the unique spaces, tireless promoters, friendly bar staff, enthusiastic Djs, otherworldly musical talent, grumpy engineers, and everyone in the club – we salute you!\n\nBethan Elfyn\n\nBBC Radio Wales\n\nComing from a small rural town in Ireland, I know just how important Grassroots Venues are. They are where I saw a band live for the first time, played my first gig, grew friendships and in general, I was always left in awe at the talents that graced the stage – shaping and forming my love for new and unsigned music forever. Without them I wouldn’t be in the position that I am today. Opportunities that I have been given as a performer and broadcaster wouldn’t have been there if it wasn’t for Grassroots Venues.\n\nAnd this is why I think it’s important that opportunities that come from Grassroots Venues are given to the next generation. Young bands, promoters and crew need venues to learn their trade. They need venues to make those connections, network and just enjoy live music. There’s nothing like the atmosphere of a live gig. These are the memories that stay with you forever.\n\nOnly a handful of these venues remain and right now are hanging by a thread. The music industry can’t be expected to fend for itself any longer, and creatives cannot survive without grassroots venues. That’s why I’m so proud to be helping protect them as a part of Music Venue Trust.\n\nGemma Bradley\n\nBBC Radio 1 / BBC Radio Ulster\n\nOnce you are bitten by the bug of live music there is no going back. I started putting on my own gigs in a tiny room above a pub in my hometown of Omagh when I was 15 years old. The sound system buzzed like a selection of old fridges strapped together filled with plutonium, the venue smelt like yesterdays beer stomped into the carpet and the ceiling was barely tall enough for anyone over 5 foot but it was perfect. Artists need these venues to learn their trade. F1 drivers don’t start out on the Silverstone track in a perfect car, you have to earn it.\n\n15 years later and I am still putting on shows in slightly larger venues throughout the country. The reason being that you can drum up an energy and a vibe in those smaller rooms better than you can in the bigger ones. Nothing will ever beat being flung across a moshpit, losing a shoe, getting showered with a random projectile pint of beer. I feel a strong responsibility to try and give that experience to the people that come through the door at my Slacker shows.\n\nWhen I was playing bass in a band we played every small venue Ireland had to offer and they ranged from the technically proficient, to the bizarre, to the ‘this isn’t a venue it’s a small shed with a plug.’ I feel strongly about the protection of these places because if we don’t chain ourselves to their metaphorical gates then where are the next generation going to play? The Tesco’s or Gastro Pub built in its place?\n\nPhil Taggart\n\nBBC Radio Ulster\n\nOne of my favourite things to do is go to a gig – that amazing, excitable atmosphere, getting to hear the songs you’re obsessed with performed live, feeling a connection in that moment with your favourite artists, sometimes discovering exciting new acts and meeting fellow music fans. It’s such a buzz and that’s why since I went to my first gig aged 12, there’s not a week that goes by where I’m not at a live show.\n\nMany of the best shows I’ve been to have been in tiny independent venues around the country. It’s the most special feeling when you’re watching an act with only a handful of other people & you can tell they’re going to go on to huge things, you know the magic memory of that intimate gig will stay with you forever. I started my Good Karma Club night to give new artists a platform to develop & learn their craft and we’ve had some incredible performances over the last few years. Without one of my favourite local venues, the Tunbridge Wells Forum, the likes of Slaves, Everything Everything & Frank Turner would not have grown to be some of the best live performers on the planet. Socially, culturally, creatively, venues are crucial, we must protect them at all costs!\n\nAbbie McCarthy\n\nBBC Music Introducing, Kent\n\n© Em Marcovecchio\n\nGrassroots Venues are where I’ve solidified friendships, developed my passion for discovering soul-shakingly great new music, and had some of the most memorable and defining experiences of my life. The first piece of music journalism I ever wrote focused on the importance of small town venues supporting new music, and it’s been the central core of every piece of broadcasting I’ve done since then.\n\nWithout them I wouldn’t have the incredible job I do today, the unsigned musicians I work with would be left without audiences to hone their craft with, communities would lose their beating, jumping, dancing heart, and the world would lose its technicolour. Yet despite this the most pivotal venues of my youth – and the early stages for all my favourite mid-size bands – are now closed. Only a handful remain in the South West, and they can’t keep up with the demands for stage time made of them from musicians across the entire artistic spectrum. Like plants without room to grow, they become stunted, left with nowhere to develop and unfurl the leaves they didn’t even know they had. We need a broad spread of music venues catering to all tastes, just as is commonplace with theatres and galleries. The music industry can’t be expected to fend for itself any longer, and creative lives can’t survive without these venues. That’s why I’m incredibly proud to be a small cog working to protect them as part of the Music Venue Trust.\n\nSarah Gosling\n\nBBC Music Introducing, Devon & Cornwall\n\nOur industry is (and our communities are) nothing without Grassroots Music Venues. It’s the start of every band’s dreams. It’s where they learn their craft, meet their fans face to face, share a drink, and form a loyal following for years to come, memories to last a lifetime and the only way to build long term solid foundations. It’s where venue owners, bar staff, door staff, promoters, managers, agents, merch sellers, tour managers, road crew etc go to build themselves, to support their artists, enjoy good music and provide for their own families and communities. It’s where fans get to experience their ‘first’ time with what will be their favourite artists in years to come. A place where they will buy merch to support bands, where they will bring their friends to have a great night out and keep their friendships close and minds healthy and strong. We must all stand by Music Venue Trust and all they do, shout as loud as we can for them, pay them back for all they have done for us, that they continue to do. They need us and I will support them in any way I can.\n\nNatasha Gregory\n\nMother Artists Live\n\nScott Thomas is one of the founding partners and managing directors of X-ray Touring, one of the world’s leading agencies. He became an agent in 1990 and through his career has consistently worked in the UK’s3smaller venues to develop acts from Manic Street Preachers & Stereophonics to Bombay Bicycle Club and even putting pop superstars such as The Black Eyed Peas through the clubs early in their career before taking them to festival and stadia headliners.\n\n“I think as wide a possible selection of small venues throughout the country is essential for the growth of new artists in whatever genre. There is no replacement for the development an act will undergo in their first 50-100 gigs and what is learned there bears fruit on the stages of arenas, festivals and stadia. These venues are also essential to get people into the habit of seeing regular live music on their doorstep.” Beyond the music business, Scott is an avid fan of live sport and Welsh rugby in particular.\n\nScott Thomas\n\nXray Touring\n\nI’ve been a massive admirer of Music Venue Trust since their inception in 2014 and the first Venues Day which we hosted at the Southbank Centre.\n\nI am delighted to be asked to be a Patron of this amazing charity. I look forward to working with Bev, Mark and the incredible MVT team to see where we can take this extraordinary journey next in what is the most difficult time we could ever imagine for the live music industry. Together we are stronger and we will get through this. I look forward to seeing you all down the front.\n\nJane Beese\n\nFreelance Programme Consultant\n\nAfter 10 years of touring internationally as an artist, Alex Bruford started work as an agent at Reprise Agency in London. Alex founded ATC Live Agency in partnership with ATC in 2011, and ATC Live now represent 300 artists including Mac DeMarco, Big Thief, The Lumineers, Shame and Sleaford Mods and books tours worldwide.\n\n“Music Venue Trust is doing a fantastic job of supporting and championing Grassroots Music Venues. My own touring taught me first-hand how important these venues are in developing an artist’s career – they are they crucial first step in building a fan base. A well-run Grassroots Venue that warmly welcomes the artist, provides good facilities and a great audience experience is something we should all cherish. Now as an agent it’s become clear to me that many of these venues are often single-handedly responsible for keeping local music scenes alive and are so important to the community. We must do all we can to support them.”\n\nAlex Bruford\n\nATC Live Agency\n\nGeorge has been MD of DHP Family since 1994 and has overseen its growth from the operator of a single flagship venue Rock City into a live music promotion company with a portfolio of award winning live music venues in Nottingham, Bristol and London. With a concerts business staging more than 1,500 shows a year across small indie venues up to stadiums, with acts like Ed Sheeran, Garbage, Nick Cave, Flaming Lips, Rufus Wainwright, George is a strong believer in the important role Grassroots Venues play in the live music eco-system.\n\n“We welcome the fact that the government is looking more urgently at business rates for music venues. This is certainly an issue for many venues across the country, but it is far from being the only issue. Rent increases, unhelpful bureaucracy and redevelopments are all hitting small venues, especially in the capital. Fundamentally, small venues showcasing grassroots, contemporary music should be seen as cultural venues – in the same way as concert halls and arts theatres – which are eligible for subsidies. We are in great danger of losing the bedrock that has enabled the UK to be one of the world’s great sources of forward thinking music.”\n\nGeorge Akins\n\nDHP Family\n\nTheresa ‘Tre’ Stead is a Tour Manager from Manchester, who has worked in the live music industry for well over 15 years. She has toured worldwide with numerous rock and pop acts, including Django Django, Mystery Jets, Jessie Ware, Take That, and is currently working with Frank Turner and The Sleeping Souls. She has twice won the Live UK Tour Manager of the Year award in 2014 and 2018, and since then has visited a variety of universities, industry events and conferences as a live music industry guest speaker.\n\n“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Grassroots Venues. They were the first place I discovered and nurtured my passion for music as a teenager growing up in Kent, and they were the venues that moulded and shaped me as a Tour Manager – the settings in which I made my mistakes and learnt my craft.\n\nNow more than ever, the live music industry is struggling and needs people who will stand up and fight for it. The MVT team have shown their passion and dedication to saving so many Grassroots Venues, ensuring that music will stay a vital part of our future and culture.”\n\nTre Stead\n\nTour Manager\n\nPhoto Credit: Cesare de Giglio for Southbank Centre\n\nHaving run a music venue myself, I am very aware of the crucial role the Grassroots Venues play in nurturing young talent in today’s competitive music industry. These intimate spaces offer fans an unparalleled gig experience and provide bands an essential platform to be discovered and to grow their audiences at the early stages of their career. Some of my most cherished memories in music are from concerts and gigs at such venues! I am very honoured to be part of this incredible network which is entirely dedicated to keeping the live music industry going and ensuring that the UK remains an amazing hub for emerging music venues with a huge impact on the global music.\n\nBengi Unsal\n\nDirector, Institute of Contemporary Art\n\nRoss Warnock is a live agent at United Talent Agency where he has worked for the past 17 years. Ross currently represents a wide range of talent across multiple genres including; City and Colour, Monster Truck, Richard Thompson, BABYMETAL and Slaves (MVT patrons).\n\n“At United Talent Agency we are focussed on artist development at every stage of an act’s career and we believe those first steps at Grassroots Venues are vital. As well as playing a key part in the early career development of so many acts, smaller venues are often vital community hubs with an underrated cultural significance. In the UK, we are fortunate to have cultivated an extensive network of independent venues and these important institutions need to be protected and supported.”\n\nRoss Warnock\n\nUnited Talent Agency\n\nGrassroots Music Venues are the foundation of the whole live music business, it is essential that we all play our part in respecting their value and help Music Venue Trust in their work to protect them. They are vital in creating and supporting music communities, they are safe spaces for artists to really hone their craft and are incredibly important for career development, not only for artists but for professionals within our industry too. Everyone will have a story about the place where it all started for them, my local venue The Forum in Tunbridge Wells absolutely changed my life.\n\nEmma Davis\n\nBusiness Support Manager at One Fiinix Live\n\n“The establishment of the Music Venue Trust comes at a critical time. There has been a worrying decline in small music venues and the irreplaceable loss of classic venues, such as the Bull & Gate in Kentish Town. Just recently in Bristol, there are signs that Government changes to permitted development rights to change use of buildings from commercial to residential are causing problems for some of the city’s best-loved venues. Small venues have always played a fundamental role in breaking and nurturing new music – their survival is important for ensuring that successful bands continue to emerge from the grassroots (from “a bunch of guys” getting together with “some shitty old instruments”, as Dave Grohl puts it), and not just from the X-Factor or the BRIT school. They also help maintain Britain’s thriving and diverse alternative music scenes, for those bands that may never play to larger audiences. But critically, they also help sustain the cultural scenes and creative economies of many towns and cities, creating employment and attracting people into city centres. I am very pleased to help support the work of Music Venue Trust in its innovative plan to help small music venues to carry on, as part of a protected network.”\n\nKerry McCarthy MP\n\nLabour\n\nGrassroots Music Venues are vital assets to our cities, towns and villages and are hubs of musical communities. They don’t just benefit the local economy but are a place to experience new ideas and avenues for meaning that would be lost otherwise.\n\nI feel like I grew up in Le Pub in Newport. Here I experienced live local music and felt part of a community of music lovers. Sadly, the importance of culture and independent business has often be devalued by Government policy. We must protect small music venues in the name of our cultural heritage, as well as to support future generations of musicians and music lovers.\n\nAmelia Womack\n\nGreen Party\n\nI have always loved live music ever since my teenage years when I was a frequent patron of venues like the Marquee Club and Hammersmith Odeon. Today, I still enjoy gigs at my local Grassroots Music Venues like the Hot Box in Chelmsford and Colchester Arts Centre. I am only too aware that so many of our biggest artists and performers started their careers playing in pubs and clubs, building a fan base and working their way up. Maintaining a wide cross-section of vibrant Grassroots Music Venues across the country is essential if the music industry in Britain is to continue to thrive and I am honoured to become a Patron of Music Venue Trust and to support their work in ensuring that it continues.\n\nJohn Whittingdale MP\n\nConservative Party\n\nLisa Nandy has promised an end to culture wars in her first speech as culture secretary, saying her department will be at the heart of efforts to reflect a more positive and less divisive vision of the UK.\n\nThe venues we work to protect are at the heart of their communities. They’re not just places to watch live music, but where likeminded people can meet, friendships and relationships can spark and blossom. A vibrant music scene can offer opportunities to anybody, from any walk of life; creatively, professionally, and personally. They can offer a sense of belonging, with diverse crowds coming together to connect over a shared love of music.\n\nIn recent years the UK has found multiple ways to divide ourselves from one another. Instead of embracing our differences - they have been weaponised for political gain.\n\nGrassroots Music Venues are about community, and fighting polarisation, division and isolation. We value our communities, our arts spaces, our differences, and our shared future. We welcome the appointment of Lisa Nandy as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and look forward to working with her and the wider department on creating a positive and sustainable future for Grassroots Music Venues. ...
