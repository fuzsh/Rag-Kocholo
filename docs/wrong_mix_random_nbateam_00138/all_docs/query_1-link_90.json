The tweet sparked an immediate backlash, with sponsors and partners cutting ties with the NBA in the league's biggest overseas market, per AFP.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nSince then, matches in China had only been viewable via the internet streaming platform Tencent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe national broadcaster did not give a reason for airing the game on Wednesday and did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nWhile some fans celebrated the league's return to state television, other social media users slammed the broadcaster for having \"no backbone.\"\n\nOn the Twitter-like platform Weibo, users said that the broadcaster was being \"shameless\" and \"greedy for money.\"\n\nThe NBA's business operations in China are worth more than $5 billion, per CNBC. As described by The New York Times, basketball is the most popular sport in the country, with a market representing hundreds of millions of fans.\n\nRead next\n\nWatch: How basketball players get turned into video game avatars for NBA 2K\n\nBasketball NBA China\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
