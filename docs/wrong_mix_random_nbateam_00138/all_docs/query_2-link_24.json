She toys with the balancing act of silliness and seriousness, and often approaches topics like mortality and suffering from a place of lighthearted wit. You are sometimes left with a sense of optimism about the prospect of your inevitable demise. When listening to her music, you might find a warm playful comfort, like the sensation of a yet to rise giggle in your chest, at the prospect of your future dead body being decomposed by worms. This future dead you will turn into other things as part of this constant state of birthing and withering that is manifested in all facets of the universe. Minda may spend too much time thinking about time. She is trapped in a perpetual paradox that she periodically digs herself out of through song writing.\n\nView Event →\n\nRiley Goldstein\n\nRiley Goldstein is a Nashville-based singer/songwriter by way of suburban New York.

Their sound is best described as mesmerizing and, as Sopko says, “trippy.”\n\nThe two have known each other for a decade and have long collaborated on projects and made music together. The duo's musical partnership first started in 2012. Sopko's band “Glimpse Trio” was on tour when their drummer had to drop out and Long was asked to step in.\n\nAnd Then Came Humans’ live performances are heavy on improvisation, which grows out of the band’s spins on songs from Doja Cat and Harry Styles to classic hip-hop, jazz melodies and rock.\n\nIndeed, the psychedelic isn’t ever far from the duo, even when talking to them. Sopko says he and Long have more than a hundred songs in their repertoire, which makes playing really fun and there's a lot of improvising that happens. “That's actually how we get ‘in between’ the transitions and the tunes. It’s kind of psychedelic,” Sopko says.\n\nThey even have their own motto: Be imperfect and accept that unpredictability is OK.\n\nView Event →\n\nRoderick August\n\nRoderick August is a singer/songwriter from Oxnard, CA, currently based in Nashville, TN.
