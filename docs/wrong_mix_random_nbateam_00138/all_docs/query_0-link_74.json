        "text": "When Russell Westbrook was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, it was supposed to be the perfect homecoming for one of the best athletes the city has every produced. NBA Champions in 2020, the Lakers were first round exits in 2021, and felt Westbrook would help reestablish them as title contenders. When that didn't materialize, the situation quickly became about more than basketball.\n\nNot only did Westbrook endure media attacks on his character during his time with the Lakers, but he and his wife had to publicly address the harassment and even death threats they were receiving from fans. This negativity became constant, and ranged from Lakers fans booing Westbrook at home games, to the aforementioned death threats online.\n\nCompounding matters, the national media leaned hard into the anti-Westbrook coverage. From segments suggesting he could be out of the league after his Lakers tenure, to attacks on his character that were framed as reports, the coverage quickly went from critical to dishonest. While this is what Westbrook's situation with the Lakers became, former Los Angeles basketball star Baron Davis said none of this ever reflected who he is or what he means to the city.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with AllClippers, Davis said, \"Russ got love from the real people in this city. When you look at LA as an entertainment space, a media source, and what the national media picks up, he didn't get the attention that he should've gotten [with the Lakers]. But he's always got love here.\"\n\nDavis specifically mentioned what Westbrook means to the youth in Los Angeles when emphasizing his impact on the city. Launching the Why Not? Academy in 2021, Westbrook's foundation partnered with LA Promise Fund to provide education and resources to middle and high-school students in the area Westbrook grew up in.\n\n\"Him being home is always great,\" Davis said. \"It's great for the city, it's great for the kids, Russ is just a stand up guy. He's a great player, a legend, and a future Hall-of-Famer.\"\n\nSigning with the LA Clippers after being traded from the Lakers and agreeing to a buyout with the Utah Jazz, Westbrook spoke openly about what it meant to stay home. This partnership with the Clippers quickly became a successful one, as Westbrook not only felt rejuvenated individually, but he also revived the spirit of his new team. This is something Baron Davis saw up close, attending games as a fan, and also making regular appearances on the team's \"ClipperVision\" broadcasts.\n\n\"[Westbrook's] leadership definitely helped the energy the Clippers played with,\" Davis said. \"That type of determination and will as a backbone, I think that's what the Clippers needed, that backbone and that energy source.\"\n\nDavis is not alone in his assessment, as every single player on the Clippers last season shared something similar. From Kawhi Leonard and Paul George down to the team's rookies, everybody spoke on the renewed energy Westbrook interjected immediately upon his arrival.\n\nThese reports about Westbrook, from those actually around him every day, are nothing new. Numerous Oklahoma City Thunder players called Westbrook the best teammate they've ever had. Austin Rivers, Westbrook's teammate with the Houston Rockets, called him the best teammate he's ever had. Bradley Beal said the same after playing with Westbrook on the Washington Wizards, and Lakers guard Austin Reaves recently shared similar sentiments.\n\nWith these reports continuing to pile up, the perception of Westbrook during his time with the Lakers gets pushed further and further from reality. According to Baron Davis, someone who was born and raised in LA, played collegiately and professionally in LA, and still lives in the city, it never was reality."
