        "meta_description": "Welcome to the Las Vegas EDM Podcast. In this captivating episode, we have a special guest, the founder of Ascension Entertainment, Jordan Berry, known in the EDM realm as JBZL, formerly Tarxan. His transformation from hip-hop to EDM and his incredible story of resilience through addiction is nothing short of inspirational.\nJBZL's name change marked a pivotal moment in his life, symbolizing a shift in his music style and a personal journey of triumph over Xanax addiction. Please tune in to hear his powerful story and the strength it took to make this transformative change.\nThe inception of Ascension Entertainment sprang from a disappointing desert rave experience in California. Dissatisfied with the event's quality, JBZL believed he could infuse his creativity and EDM expertise into hosting exceptional events for artists and the community. His vision materialized with the launch of their first desert festival in March 2023.\nAs a DJ and producer, JBZL's heart beats to the rhythms of dubstep and trap, but he considers himself a multi-faceted artist with diverse musical influences. He's performed at notable events for the Church Of Bass, Ravelation, and various events in Los Angeles, amassing a decade of experience behind the decks.\nBorn in Los Angeles, CA, and a resident of Las Vegas, NV, for 22 years, JBZL brings a unique blend of West Coast energy to his music and events. In this episode, you'll get to know the man behind the music and the visionary behind Asencion Entertainment.\nBut that's not all. Our guest host, Toyss, engages JBZL in a playful game, challenging him to decide who he'd \"fuck, marry, and kill\" among EDM's elite: Skrillex, Subtronics, and RL Grime. It's a lighthearted moment in an otherwise insightful conversation.\nRecorded live at the iconic Jackpot Bar & Grill in Las Vegas, this episode encapsulates the essence of the EDM community and its vibrant personalities. Join us as we explore the EDM universe through JBZL's incredible journey and the electric atmosphere of the Las Vegas EDM scene. Welcome to the Las Vegas EDM Podcast, where the music never stops, and the stories are always extraordinary.",
