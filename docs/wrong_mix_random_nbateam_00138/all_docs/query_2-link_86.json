Our mission is to provide targeted, interdisciplinary services for the most vulnerable homeless clients in order to break or prevent the cycle of homelessness. For the past ten years, we’ve committed ourselves to providing the best care possible for the homeless, focusing on services that will assist families into stable housing. By assessing families and individuals as they enter our care, we can identify their unique needs and provide immediate relief when necessary. We utilize public/private partnerships to ensure that our clients are connected to all community resources available to them.\n\nKids + Family\n\n4 Employees\n\n<p>With the increasing time constraints on peoples lives it's inevitable that somethings will fall through the cracks.
