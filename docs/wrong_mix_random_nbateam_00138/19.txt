CLEVELAND, Ohio -- LeBron James will have to wait at least one more year for his fifth NBA MVP.

James finished runner-up behind Houston Rockets star James Harden for this year's honor, which was announced Monday night during the 2018 NBA Awards on TNT.

"I'm not going to get emotional but she is my backbone, good times, bad times," Harden said while on stage next to his mother. "Sixth Man of the Year (in 2011-12) to MVP... I'll see y'all next year."

Harden received 965 total points in the voting, garnering 86 first-place votes and 15 second-place votes. James, meanwhile, totaled 738 points, getting 15 first-place votes, 79 second-place votes and seven third-place votes. New Orleans Pelicans big man Anthony Davis was the third finalist.

Harden was the NBA's leading scorer, averaging 30.4 points, and ranked third in assists with 8.8 per night. He led the Rockets to a franchise-record 65 victories, which was also good for the top mark in the NBA.

A first time recipient after a runner-up finish to Russell Westbrook last season, Harden edged second-place finisher James in numerous advanced statistics as well, including Offensive Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus, Win Shares, Win Shares per 48, Player Efficiency Rating and Player Impact Estimate.

It took that incredible level of play to beat out James, who enjoyed one of his best statistical seasons.

He averaged 27.5 points on 54.2 percent from the field to go with a career-high 9.1 assists and 8.6 rebounds while playing all 82 games.

After capturing the honor four times in a five year stretch, starting in 2009, James hasn't won the MVP since 2013. He finished fourth in the voting last season.
