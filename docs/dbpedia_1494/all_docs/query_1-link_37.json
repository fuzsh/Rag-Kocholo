        "text": "INVENTORY\n\nTelephone Pioneers Collection 2003-35\n\nInclusive Dates: 1880s-1990s, bulk dates 1930s-1970s\n\nScope Notes:\n\nThis collection contains materials related to the Telephone Pioneers of America organization. Telephone company workers created this organization in 1911 and it became a fraternal type group that focused on service and activities. This is a nationwide organization divided into different chapters. Most of this collection pertains to the “Hawkeye Chapter” or “Chapter 17” which included Davenport. Some of the materials also pertain to the Muscatine chapter.\n\nThe items donated came from a museum, created by the Telephone Pioneers, in the telephone building at 6th and Main in Davenport, Iowa. The museum was created to document the creation of, and continued technology of the telephone and to document the Telephone Pioneers as an organization. Ms. Mary Ann Wilkison, in memory of W. B. “Red” Sebern, donated the items when the museum closed. The reason for the closure of the museum was because the space taken by the museum was needed by the telephone company.\n\nThe collection includes multiple scrapbooks documenting the Telephone Pioneers activities, manuals belonging to the employees, newsletters sent to members, records of pole locations, treasurer records, newspaper clippings mentioning the organization, correspondence from former employees, information about the “Facsimile Picture Service”, and items from binders belonging to members. The collection also includes three large maps, a “Theodore N. Vail” certificate and letter, an “Outstanding Safety Performance Award”, membership and ID cards, and watercolors of the local area. Three-dimensional objects were also donated with this collection.\n\nThe photographic collection includes photographs of early telephone services, prints of telephone buildings in the area, and photographs of Telephone Pioneer activities including retirements and anniversaries. The Memorandum of Gift states that there are approximately 161 photographs. Around 140-150 photographs were counted.\n\nOnly names which were specifically mentioned within a document or those people who where often documented were placed on the cross reference of names. The scrapbooks contained many people who are not referenced on this list. Also, the photographic collection contained many people who have been identified on the envelopes but are not included on the cross reference of names.\n\nStorage Location:\n\nBox 1-7: LIB- ARCH- R6- Cab 1 and 2 Top\n\nBox 8 (Oversized): LIB- ARCH- R9- 55B\n\nOversized Folders: LIB- ARCH- R8-05- Cab 2- D13\n\nBox 1\n\nFolder 1: Muscatine Rural Exchange pole records (1 of 2 folders)\n\n• Record Book with news clippings dated September 13, 1910- July 6, 1916\n\n• Golden Anniversary of the Telephone in Muscatine Booklet by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company\n\n• Muscatine Rural Exchange Pole Records from 1936-1972 (scattered dates)\n\nFolder 2: Muscatine Rural Exchange pole records (2 of 2 folders)\n\n• Muscatine Rural Exchange Pole Records continued– 1936-1968 (scattered dates)\n\nFolder 3: Muscatine Pole Records (1 of 3 folders)\n\n• Muscatine Pole Records from 1925-1975 (scattered dates)\n\n• Two joint use contract billing summaries between the Muscatine Water and Electric Company and the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company (1974, 1976)\n\nFolder 4: Muscatine Pole Records (2 of 3 folders)\n\n• Muscatine Pole Records continued– 1925-1967 (scattered dates)\n\nFolder 5: Muscatine Pole Records (3 of 3 folders)\n\n• Muscatine Pole Records continued– 1925-1959\n\n• Drawings of pole locations by Muscatine Power and Water\n\no Explains which poles are to be sold between Northwestern Bell and Muscatine Power and Water\n\nFolder 6: Muscatine- Wapello pole records and powerline conflicts\n\n• Joint use billing agreement between Iowa Southern Utilities Company and the Northwestern Bell Company\n\n• Muscatine-Wapello Pole Records from 1925-1961 (scattered dates)\n\n• Reports of Proposed Situations of Proximity with foreign lines\n\no Includes two maps of Louisa County, Iowa and one of Muscatine County, Iowa\n\nFolder 7: Muscatine- Wapello pole records and powerline conflicts\n\n• Reports of Power line crossing or conflict\n\n• Reports of higher voltage crossings\n\n• Pole inspection records\n\nFolder 8\n\n2003.35.61c and 2003.35.61d- Two letters announcing and congratulating Daniel Soesbe as a Theodore N.
