        "text": "“A touch of color ‘neath skies of gray … But then the sun came out again, And sent us happily on our way” — Dyrenforth James and Gibbons Carroll\n\nStory and photos by David A. Laws\n\nThe landscape artists of Portland, Oregon, have crafted prize-winning gardens that glow with color and style even under the often overcast, damp, and drizzle endemic to the “City of Roses.” Frank Sinatra’s line “A touch of color ‘neath skies of gray,” from his 1962 recording A Garden in the Rain, eloquently captures the experience of a springtime visit to our northern neighbor.\n\nPortland boasts an urban wilderness of more than 200 parks within the city limits. Four of them are world-class destinations. Their range of cultural, sculptural, and horticultural features offer something to delight the eye throughout every season of the year. The International Rose Test Garden peaks in June and lasts through late summer. Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden glows with luminous blossom in spring and foliage color in fall. And no matter how gray the skies, two traditional Asian landscapes exhibit masterfully crafted details that endure long after their floral displays have faded."
