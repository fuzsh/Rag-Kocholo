        "text": "The Tiny Kahn Discography\n\nby Noal Cohen\n\nNote: For conventions and abbreviations used in this discography, please see: Discography Key.\n\nNote: As of March 15, 2019, most digital download issues will no longer be displayed. This decision was made because of the ephemeral nature of these issues, sometimes deficient audio quality and legitimacy questions.\n\nDiscographies list a session for Columbia Records of March 19, 1947 led by Woody Herman, backed by a group called The Four Chips. One title was recorded, \"That's My Desire\" (CO37499-1). The backing personnel are identified as Chuck Wayne (g), Ralph Burns (p), Joe Shulman (b) and Tiny Kahn (d); however, no drums are audible in this track. Why Kahn is associated with this session is not known.\n\nMany sources indicate that Tiny Kahn was the drummer on a live broadcast of the Kai Winding Sextet from Birdland on September 3, 1951. Two titles, \"Donna Lee\" and \"East of the Sun\" were issued on Spotlite (Eng.) SPJ 143 (Al Haig Meets the Master Saxes, Vol. 3; 1980 LP which lists Kahn as the drummer). But according to Dave Green who has listened to the Voice of America broadcast, the drummer announced by Leonard Feather is Sid Bulkin (see IAJRC Journal, September 2013, p. 34).\n\nFrom April to July 1952, the Elliot Lawrence Orchestra broadcast from the Statler Hotel in New York City and many of these radio shows were recorded privately and have circulated among collectors over the years. The information shown in the sessions below from that venue comes from Tiny Kahn discographer Malcolm Walker. I have auditioned some of the recordings but assigning a precise date to each track is problematic because the band would perform the same material each night and thus several versions of certain titles exist. Here is a listing of the titles I have auditoned with unverified months of recording. Timings are in parentheses:\n\nApril 1952:\n\nWho Fard That Shot? (3:10, 3:21)\n\nJive At Five (2:24, 3:08)\n\nYou Took Advantage Of Me (2:39, 2:30, 2:36)\n\nA Little Wake Up Music (2:56, 3:08)\n\nMay 1952:\n\nYou Took Advantage Of Me (2:39, 2:30, 2:36)\n\nAnytime (4:00)\n\nMy Heart Stood Still (3:12)\n\nJeepers Creepers (2:43, 3:00)\n\nTaking a Chance On Love (3:29)\n\nJune 1952:\n\nYou Took Advantage Of Me (2:39, 2:30, 2:36)\n\nMaybe (2:43)\n\nWho Fard That Shot? (3:10, 3:21)\n\nJeepers Creepers (2:43, 3:00)\n\nMoten Swing (4:12)\n\nSing, Baby, Sing (2:02)\n\nGood Wood (3:17)\n\nA Little Wake Up Music (2:56, 3:08)\n\nJive At Five (2:24, 3:08)\n\nTapeworm (4:18)\n\nJuly 1952:\n\nMaybe (2:43)\n\nMy Heart Stood Still (3:12)\n\nYou Took Advantage of Me (2:39, 2:30, 2:36)\n\nWho Fard That Shot?
