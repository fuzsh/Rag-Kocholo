Woods and starring popular bass-baritone singer Keith Falkner in the first of his three screen performances.\n\nIt was produced at Teddington Studios by the British subsidiary of Warner Brothers.[1] The film was a quota quickie production, starring Falkner as a factory hand whose exceptional singing voice is discovered by the daughter of the factory owner. She then helps him rise to fame and fortune as a professional singer.
