        "text": "In New York City, wealthy businessman Chris Thorne meets lawyer Diane Lightson in an elevator. Chris invites the woman, who is visibly upset, to a party in his penthouse apartment. There, the two professionals realize they share an interest in a land development deal. Although Chris thinks the project is a fraud, Diane convinces him to drive her to a meeting with the client. Two rich Brazilians, Fausto and Renalda, overhear Chris and Diane making plans to leave Manhattan. Thinking the road trip is recreational, they invite themselves along. The next day, while driving down the New Jersey turnpike, the Brazillians insist on taking a more scenic route. Chris dismisses the idea, but Diane suggests a road not too far off the highway. A short while later, they drive through an impoverished town in a sleek BMW, while locals eye them with suspicion. When Chris rolls through a stop sign without hesitation, a police cruiser follows the car out of town. The cruiser signals for Chris to pull over, but Fausto and Renalda urge the businessman to speed away. The police cruiser, outfitted with an unusual array of switches, keeps pace with the BMW. Unexpected roadblocks force Chris to pull over, and Chief Constable Dennis Valkenheiser informs the New Yorker that only “the J. P.” can decide the foursome’s fate. Dennis escorts the BMW through the “Village and Shire of Valkenvania,” where strange metal sculptures and piles of old junk litter the roadside. Town Hall is a decrepit mansion, and the New Yorkers approach the Justice of the Peace with trepidation, stunned when the liver-spotted Hon. Reeve Alvin Valkenheiser sentences them to a hearing the following day. The crazy “J. P.” laughs as he sends the foursome through a trap door into the basement, confining them to his “trick house” for the night. Later, another group of city people get brought in for speeding, but this time, the eccentric judge shows no mercy. He flips a switch, and a mechanical apparatus whirs to life, transporting the offenders to the “Bonestripper,” a modified carnival attraction that spews out their skeletons. That night, Chris, Diane, Fausto, and Renalda are invited to supper with Dennis Valkenheiser, the J. P., and the J. P.’s granddaughter, Eldona, an obese woman who smiles flirtatiously at Chris Thorne. The Valkenheisers serve their guests Hawaiian punch, celery sticks, and hot dogs. Disgusted by the meal, Fausto leaps from his chair and announces that he and Renalda must leave the house. They jump through a window and run from the mansion. Braving filth and contamination, they swim across a small body of water to freedom. However, Constable Dennis intercepts the Brazillians. He listens thoughtfully to their offer of bribe money, relaxation, and fish tacos. Back inside the house, Chris and Diane take advantage of the commotion and flee the dining room, but the J. P. stops them with one of his mechanical contraptions. Eldona escorts the New Yorkers to their room, where they fall asleep. When they awaken, they notice the door is ajar. They again attempt to escape, but are thwarted at every turn by an array of moving walls and mechanized devices. They find their way to the attic, where they discover old newspaper clippings and hundreds of photographic identifications. Diane concludes that the Valkenheiser family has been administering its peculiar form of “justice” since the 1890s. Just then, a passageway opens, leading out of the attic by a funhouse slide. Lacking alternatives, Chris and Diane descend from the attic, but the slide forks in opposite directions, and the two are separated. Chris becomes trapped in the wall adjacent to the J. P.’s room, while Diane emerges outside the house in a scrap metal yard. She locates the BMW, which has been stripped to the frame. Hearing voices nearby, she creeps through the scrap yard until she comes upon two, fat, diaper-clad creatures forging metal. Shocked, she steps backward into a junk pile, alerting the creatures to her presence. A chase ensues, but Eldona thwarts Diane’s escape. The two creatures, Bobo and L’il Debbull, beg Eldona to leave the beautiful woman as their plaything. Back inside the mansion, the J. P. receives a telephone call informing him that a new group of perpetrators have been brought to court. When the judge leaves his bedroom, Chris crawls through a hole in the wall. However, the J. P. returns unexpectedly and threatens Chris with a knife. The businessman runs into the hall, where he collides with Eldona. The J. P. informs Chris of an arcane rule: Any person who touches Eldona must marry her. Pleased with himself, the judge returns to the courtroom, where a group of hip-hop artists await their hearing. The eccentric J. P. asks to see their musical instruments. The rappers perform a song in the courtroom, and the J. P. agrees to let them go without a fine. The judge then offers Chris a deal: death, or marry Eldona and live in Valkenvania forever. Chris reluctantly chooses to marry Eldona, but at the end of the ceremony, he has a change of heart and tries to get away. The angry judge sends Chris to the Bonestripper, but the contraption breaks down, and Chris survives unscathed. Out in the scrap yard, the J. P. threatens to kill Diane unless Chris surrenders. Chris causes an explosion, distracting the Valkenheiser family and rescuing Diane. Together they run from the property and jump onto a passing train. Back in New York City, they inform police about the Valkenheisers’ criminal activities, but are told the criminal family can only be arrested within town limits of Valkenvania. Chris and Diane unwittingly return to Valkenvania, where police reveal their allegiance to the J. P. Just then, the ground trembles as a coalmine fire erupts underground. Chris and Diane escape in the BMW as the mansion and village are engulfed in flames. Sometime later, Chris watches a news report on the Valkenvania fire, and becomes horrified when the J. P. tells a reporter his plan to move in with his “grandson-in-law” in New York City. Meanwhile, Fausto and Renalda, who have employed Dennis as their personal security detail, enjoy cocktails in Rio de Janeiro."
