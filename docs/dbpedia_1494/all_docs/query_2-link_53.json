Even then there were a few\n\npioneer souls who pushed on in the field of education and attained degrees higher\n\nthan a B.A., but the majority of Agnes Scott graduates during those years were\n\nquietly satisfied to frame their diplomas and settle into matrimony or school teaching.\n\nThe Southern woman's problem has been, in several respects, a little different from\n\nthat of her sister in the North or West. For a number of years after this prejudice had\n\nbeen outworn in other sections of the country, Southern families did not take seriously\n\nthe acquiring of an academic degree by a woman. In the early days at Agnes Scott,\n\nthe students wanted to leave college in the early spring. Why wait and take exam-\n\ninations? They did not care at all about getting a degree, nor even receiving credit\n\nfor the year's work. The strange part is that they were staunchly upheld in this\n\nposition by their families. Nancy or Sallie or Bessie would probably be married\n\nsooner or later anyway. What good would a degree or college credits possibly do her\n\nthen?\n\nMarriage was, of course, the great career. While waiting to embark on this\n\ncareer, a young Southern lady, like Mrs. Micawber, \"lived at home with her papa and\n\nmamma.\" If the waiting drew itself out a bit, or the family were distressingly em-\n\nbarrassed financially, the daughter of the house might teach school a pleasant 'and\n\neasy occupation practically the only occupation for daughters of the first families.\n\nAnother idea that is still largely current in the South is that with marriage any\n\nother career ceases for a woman. Married women no matter how successful a start\n\nthey may have made in some profession do not, as a rule, work. Whether this old\n\nidea will completely crumble under the onslaught of present day living conditions is\n\na moot question in the South today. But it has crumbled somewhat. A few Southern\n\nmarried women are continuing careers; a few Southern married women are doing that\n\nunheard of thing carrying on an organized course of study with some university.\n\nTeaching continues to be the greatest door open to Southern college women. The\n\nteaching profession is so overcrowded that the holder of a B.A. degree finds herself\n\npushed into the background by the master's and doctor's degees among her competi-\n\ntors. If she is to hold her own, she, too, must acquire a higher degree. The married\n\nwoman who, after several years spent in the quiet sheltered back-water of her home,\n\ncomes out again to join the main current of the workers of the world, finds that she\n\nis rusty on a number of things she must do a little graduate work to get herself back\n\ninto the \"feel\" of things.\n\nTwenty-one members of the class of '27 are engaged in graduate study this winter.\n\nBy leaps and bounds, the percentage of our graduates who study for higher degrees is\n\nincreasing. Girls who are not financially able to carry on their studies the year fol-\n\nlowing graduation teach a year or two, and then enter some university. Graduates\n\nsome of them married women from the early nineteen hundreds' classes are (to use a\n\nlate nineteen hundreds' term) crashing the gate of universities and matriculating for\n\ngraduate study.\n\nThe merits and disadvantages of the various centres chosen for their later work\n\nform one of the chief topics of conversation at informal gatherings of alumnae at\n\nthe Anna Young Alumnae House.\n\n\"When I think that I saved three years, and then went to the wrong place for\n\nmy master's in English!\" wails one.\n\n\"Knowing what I do now about the department of psychology at Such-and-Such,\n\nI thank my lucky stars every day that I chose it,\" breathes another, with a satisfied\n\n4 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\n\" And I came so near going West for that work!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't take a million for that winter I spent in New York,\" vows one girl,\n\nwhile another answers her with: \"And I shouldn't advise anybody to do graduate\n\nwork in that mob.\"\n\n\"Is it very expensive to spend a year studying abroad?\" \"Where is the best place\n\nfor sociology?\" \"Aren't there any good graduate schools in the South? Are we as\n\nprovincial as all that?\" are questions heard over and over in these informal discussions.\n\nAnd so for the benefit of numbers of the alumnae who are scattered here and\n\nthere, working out their problems alone, unable to get back to these Alumnae House\n\ngatherings, yet deeply interested in the subject, we have planned in this Quarterly six\n\nor eight very informal articles on graduate work by Agnes Scott people.\n\nThey are most decidedly not ads for these specific universities and schools. Several\n\nyears ago it looked as if Agnes Scott girls did not know any other graduate school\n\nthan Columbia existed, judging from the number who went there. In these short\n\nsketches we strive to put before you old Agnes Scott girls the existence and possibilities\n\nof other universities, too North, West, in our own South, and abroad.\n\nDOING GRADUATE WORK IN THE SOUTH\n\n\"Home-keeping youths have ever homely wits.\" Being familiar with this saying,\n\nI have always had an ambition to sally forth into the big wide world to get an edu-\n\ncation. In my prep school days I had rosy visions of Smith, Vassar, Bryn Mawr and\n\nall the farthest of the far-away Eastern colleges, but when the time came, I could\n\nget no farther away from home and homely wits than Agnes Scott.\n\nAt first, I was disappointed, but after two days on the campus, I have never\n\nregretted for a moment that I did my college work in the South, and at Agnes Scott.\n\nYet always there has lingered in my mind the thought that, for graduate work, I\n\nshould go far away to Columbia, to Chicago, or above all, to Yale. But, again, my\n\nplans had to change, and it was in the little village of Chapel Hill at the University\n\nof North Carolina that I had my first year of graduate study.\n\nIt seems that, among Agnes Scott girls, I am a pioneer at staying South for\n\nstudy, for nearly all the master's degrees acquired by \"Hottentots\" have been from\n\nNorthern, Western, or Eastern universities. And the alumnae secretary, in her zeal\n\nto get material for the Quarterly, has tried to persuade me that the alumnae would\n\nbe interested to hear about graduate work in the South.\n\nHaving had no experience with graduate work in other places, I can make no\n\ncomparisons nor contrasts. I can only assert that it is hard to imagine a more con-\n\ngenial atmosphere for study than a little University town like Chapel Hill, full of old\n\ntrees and old buildings and old books a village where practically all the inhabitants\n\nare professors or students, and where casual conversation is less of the weather or\n\nthe movies and more of what one has been studying or reading or thinking. There\n\none finds none of the attractions that a large city might offer to lure away from work,\n\nand it is only too easy in a dim seminar room in the library to lose one's hold on the\n\nworld of the twentieth century and slip back into the world of Plato, of Dante, or of\n\nShakespeare. There where graduate students are numbered by hundreds rather than\n\nthousands, professors have time to know and to help, and there can exist a feeling of\n\nreal comradeship between those who teach and those who study. Often seminar\n\ncourses are held around the fire in the hospitable home of a professor instead of in\n\nthe usual stiff lecture rooms.\n\nIt is comfortable to feel that, though the graduate schools of our Southern uni-\n\nversities are less widely known than those of the eastern ones, their influence on the\n\ncultural life of the country is felt. In the Bookman of October, 1927, Herschel\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 5\n\nBrickelPs article, \"The Literary Awakening of the South,\" speaks of the University of\n\nNorth Carolina as \"one of the most active social and cultural centers in the country\n\nat the moment.\"\n\nMy purpose in writing this is not to encourage you to stay away from the larger\n\nand more distant universities, but to encourage you to go on with graduate work,\n\neven if you are unable to go North or East or West, for sometimes home, and the\n\nSouth are best.\n\nTHE BEGINNER IN GRADUATE WORK AT CHICAGO\n\nBy ISABEL FERGUSON\n\n(Isabel Ferguson is a graduate of Agnes Scott in the class of '2 5. She did personnel\n\nwork in Atlanta for the year following graduation, and from that entered the Uni-\n\nversity of Chicago. She was awarded her master's degree in history in 1927. Miss\n\nFerguson is now teaching at the Western Kentucky State Teachers' College in Bowling\n\nGreen. )\n\nBiologists say to be great you must choose your grandparents with care. To make\n\na success of graduate work it is necessary to choose carefully the place where your\n\nundergraduate work is done.\n\nWe who have had our training at Agnes Scott have done this, and if history is the\n\nchosen field, I know of no better place for subsequent graduate work than the Uni-\n\nversity of Chicago. A very powerful voice has already prepared the way for us.\n\n\"I'm from Agnes Scott College in \" the new student at Chicago begins timidly.\n\n\"Oh, so you're one of Cleo Hearon's students! I suppose you know all about\n\nMississippi and the Compromise of 1850. Well, if you are from Agnes Scott, I\n\nguess you are all right.\"\n\nThen, after such a reception, all that remains is to prove that you are! So\n\nwith the added spur of the fear of reflecting discredit on Agnes Scott and Miss\n\nHearon, as well as yourself, you begin the grind.\n\nThis grind (or perhaps it is not the proper term to use in regard to study which\n\nis done for the love of it, as graduate work is supposed to be!) is lightened and as\n\na matter of fact made much more pleasant due to the similarity in the methods used\n\nat Agnes Scott and Chicago. When you have found your way to the library, had\n\na desk assigned to you in the history reading room and obtained a \"stack permit,\" you\n\nare ready for your graduate work. Oh, what a grand and glorious feeling it is to\n\nmake the great discovery that a term paper for a graduate course is really no different\n\nfrom the one you wrote in History VII, even to the pernicious way op. cit.'s and\n\nibid's in footnotes get mixed.\n\nAs consciousness of what it is all about dawns, you find that the department is\n\ninterested in you and your efforts puerile though they may be. You can take your\n\ntroubles to them and find sympathy, and what is better, usually a solution. The\n\nhead of the history department is now Professor William E. Dodd, who is from\n\nNorth Carolina, and who makes Southerners feel quite at home.\n\nAfter the preliminaries of getting started, comes the joyful realization that you\n\nare not a bewildered freshman but a graduate student. Then it is you want your\n\nterm papers to be good and get a thrill of exultation over writing something from\n\noriginal sources which is possible only in a splendid library.\n\nThe climax of all your experiences is reached when your thesis is accepted. You\n\nfeel that you are now an author although of a document which, it is true, not\n\neven your own family would read. But you can understand why not, for you\n\nwouldn't yourself if it were not your creation and each word had its memories\n\npleasant and otherwise. But a thesis is a valuable possession for it furnishes an excel-\n\nlent threat to hold over future generations. \"If you are not good, I'll make you read\n\n6 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nmy thesis!\" Aladin's magic lamp was not more powerful than this threat can be.\n\nAll of these classes, term papers and theses go on in a very delightful setting of\n\nbeautiful granite buildings, modelled after Oxford, and hidden by ivy. Gargoyles\n\npeep out to jeer at you when you weep and to deride you when you laugh. Then\n\nthere is the Midway, stretching from Lorado Taf t's lovely Fountain of Time to Jack-\n\nson Park and Lake Michigan. In your earned or stolen leisure you can walk down\n\nthis Midway and know you are going the way your mother trod before you when\n\nshe was young and with the rest of humanity attended the World's Fair of 1893.\n\nYou, too, can see the Japanese pagodas and gaze at the exposition buildings once new\n\nand imposing, now old and cracked the last evidences of that former glory. This\n\nis all part of the University of Chicago.\n\nAs for Chicago the Windy City, the Crime Center, the Hog Butcher of the\n\nWorld, Second Largest City it is fascinating.\n\nHISTORY AT LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\nBy FRANCES HARPER\n\n(Frances Harper is another of the class of '22 who is doing splendid work in\n\nthe department of history. A native of Philadelphia, she has spent all her time\n\nsince graduation in Louisiana, teaching and studying. Miss Harper is at present living\n\nin Baton Rouge.)\n\nThe University of Louisiana itself is so beautiful that the mere sight of it is an\n\ninspiration. Imagine how it looks: on a hill overlooking the Mississippi River, the\n\nbuildings all in the Italian style, of cream-yellow stucco with red tile roofs, the\n\ncenter and lovliest of them all is the Campanile, a thing of exquisite beauty and sim-\n\nplicity, facing the green expanse of the parade ground. The second \"wonder\" of the\n\ncampus is the Greek theatre, built on a natural slope, the stage having a background\n\nof giant, moss-hung live-oaks and magnolias. The theatre is used for the university\n\nand high school commencements as well as for dramatics.\n\nBut I suppose you do want to know something about the graduate school here.\n\nFirst, however, I must tell you about something that properly doesn't belong in this\n\nletter at all: the Audubon Sugar School. It is more than nationally famous: men\n\ncome here to study sugar chemistry from South America, the Philippines, Hawaii\n\nand even Columbia University!\n\nOf the academic departments of the university, that of history is especially fine.\n\nI can say that without fear of seeming prejudiced, for I went to L. S. U. with the in-\n\ntention of majoring in English, and after one term's work changed to history. The\n\ninstruction offered in the history department is of the most superior type. There are\n\nfive professors, all men trained in the best universities of the North, and specialists\n\neach in a particular field. In contrast to many of the larger universities, each of the\n\nhistory professors teaches at least two freshman classes; he offers work in his special\n\nfield for more advanced classes, and seminar courses for graduate students. The latter\n\nmay enroll in regular classes if they can attend them; otherwise the courses are con-\n\nducted through weekly conferences between professor and student. Again in con-\n\ntrast to some other universities, graduate students at L. S. U. receive the greatest\n\nhelp and encouragement from their professors. They require a very high standard\n\nof scholarship; and any serious student of history will find a deep satisfaction and\n\ninspiration in his work here.\n\nThe library facilities are good, and are constantly being improved. In particular,\n\noriginal sources for the study of the history of Louisiana are available, through several\n\ncomplete newspaper files and other such valuable material. Relics and documents are\n\nbeing collected; in short, L. S. U. is becoming a center for the study of Louisiana\n\nhistory. By the way, did you know that General Sherman was L. S. U.'s first\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 7\n\npresident? That was just before the war. During the war, the university was used\n\nfor army headquarters, and the old barracks are still in use as dormitories.\n\nYou know it is rather a stupendous task, introducing a university to nearly a\n\nthousand people. I hope this will serve at least to let them know that L. S. U. is \"on\n\nthe map,\" and is becoming more firmly settled there all the time.\n\nMEDICINE AT TULANE\n\nBy IVYLYN GIRARDEAU\n\n(For the past two years, Ivylyn Girardeau, '22, has been studying medicine at\n\nTulane University in New Orleans. This year she is teaching in Silliman College, and\n\nin the fall of '2 8, she plans to return to Tulane for her last two years in the medical\n\nschool. )\n\nI landed in New Orleans two years ago, not knowing a soul in the whole big city.\n\nAfter registering at the university and finding a boarding place I began to enquire\n\nabout opening exercises, but being unable to elicit any information concerning the\n\nsame, I decided the best course to follow would be to report to the first class which\n\nwas scheduled for the following afternoon. This I did, expecting to be given a few\n\npolite directions and allowed to go home. I was soon disillusioned. One hundred and\n\ntwenty-seven of us reported for class and there being only room enough for one\n\nhundred, twenty-seven of us stood for one hour while Dr. Smith lectured. Then we\n\nwere ushered into the anatomy dissecting room where, upon thirty-two tables, as\n\nmany colored gentlemen cadavers were waiting to be carved upon. 'Twas a warm\n\nday, the dissecting room was close, the odor of preservatives heavy upon the air and\n\nthe job not a very inviting one, but I would have bitten my tongue out before I\n\nwould have admitted that I preferred to be anywhere else than right there. To\n\nadd to my troubles, the supply man downstairs had given me a size forty-four dis-\n\nsecting gown which completely swallowed me and trailed all over the floor. After\n\nspending about thirty busy minutes with a razor on \"Roscoe's\" head I asked an in-\n\nstructor who happened to be passing if that would do.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied, \"his hair will all grow out again in a few days, anyway.\"\n\nThere were seven girls in our class, the largest number ever at Tulane. We lost\n\none at the end of the first trimester but the other six stuck until last June. On all\n\nhands I heard reports of Goldie Ham of the class of '19. She had been most popular\n\nwith the Tulane and Newcomb students and had made a splendid record in her\n\nstudies. She finished her course in twenty-three, interned for a year at Charity and\n\nis now practicing in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe first two years of medicine are largely theory, with a great deal of memory\n\nwork attached but we were given a few peeps into the practical side of medicine\n\nthe last part of the Sophomore year. We learned to percuss hearts and lungs, to\n\nauscult chests, to apply bandages of all types, and to make Plaster of Paris splints and\n\ncasts. Occasionally we visited the wards of the hospitals and were shown interesting\n\ncases. With dogs under ether we made numerous interesting experiments, being in\n\nturn chief surgeon, assistant surgeon, anesthetist and technician. During the Christ-\n\nmas holidays my partner and I visited the various hospitals and saw some real oper-\n\nations. That was the biggest thrill of all, and I found myself wishing for the Junior\n\nyear with its practical work to hurry along.\n\nThe medical students are so very busy that they have no time to enter into the\n\nsocial life of the college at all. In fact, we hardly know the rest of the crowd is on\n\nthe campus. But if you want to know where you can get the blackest coffee at the\n\nold French market any of us can give you the information, and we can also describe\n\nall of the night noises of New Orleans for you. Yes, the work is hard, but it's ever\n\nso interesting, and that makes up for the long hours of study.\n\nDr. Reavis has just written me that my application to the foreign board has been\n\nfavorably passed on, so in about four years from now I hope to be prescribing pink\n\npills to our Chinese brothers across the sea.\n\n8 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nA SUMMER AT AN ART ACADEMY\n\nBy LEONE BOWERS HAMILTON\n\n(Leone (Bowers) Hamilton, '26, has done outstanding work in the art department\n\nall during her four years at Agnes Scott. The year following her graduation, Mrs.\n\nHamilton returned to the college on an art scholarship, awarded for exceptional work,\n\nto continue her study under Miss Lewis.)\n\nInformality reigns at the summer session of the Pennsylvania Art Academy, held\n\nin historic old buildings at Chester Springs, each year. Our little art world was a\n\nmedley of races Russians, Italians, English, French, Norwegian, Indian, each seek-\n\ning to realize his ambition by putting on canvas or into clay whatever is beautiful.\n\nEvery week the students in painting and sculpture check their work at the office, and\n\nsome are chosen for the exhibition room. The instructors are such men as Daniel\n\nGarber, George Harding, Joseph Pearson and Albert Laeslie, all wellknown names\n\nin the world of art.\n\nLiving arrangements at the summer school are simple, and very inexpensive. A fee\n\nof twenty dollars a week covers everything, including working materials. And al-\n\nthough the students work hard, after work hours are over, they are very gay! Tennis,\n\nswimming, croquet, baseball, and masquerade balls are the chief forms of diversion.\n\nSPECIALIZING IN NEW YORK CITY\n\nBy HELEN LANE COMFORT\n\n(Helen Lane Comfort, '24, is now in charge of the library at the Presbyterian\n\nCollege in Clinton, S. C. Miss Comfort studied at the New York School of Library\n\nScience in 1926.)\n\nBack in the dim dark past of the writer's career, she heard a talk by the head\n\nof the Atlanta Library School, presenting the possibilities of work in the library field.\n\nWith the superb nonchalance of the undergraduate, the lecture was commented on\n\nwith indifference and straightway forgotten. But life has a fatal propensity for\n\nthrusting one into the most unthought of positions. Accordingly, as a result of one\n\nof these queer turns, in the fall of 1925, an Agnes Scott graduate came to New\n\nYork with the firm determination to acquire the mdiments of library methods, to be\n\nacquired from the school of the New York Public Library.\n\nThe purpose of this article is by no means autobiographical; on the contrary it is\n\nhoped to be of some assistance to those contemplating such work. Since 192 5 three\n\nlibrary schools of the State of New York have merged and now form the Graduate\n\nSchool of Libraries and Library Science of Columbia University. There will be built\n\nup eventually an undergraduate course. At present two years' work will give an\n\naccredited college graduate a degree of Master of Library Science. This may be\n\ntaken in \"broken doses\" one year of school, one year of work, and the second year of\n\nschool.\n\nThe school work is made up of regular class and laboratory periods. There are\n\nvisits to libraries in and around New York City on certain afternoons. And if the\n\nnew school follows the methods of the School of the New York Public Library, an\n\ninspection trip of a week in the spring is taken either as far south as Washington,\n\nor north to Boston. Tn addition, there is one month of practice work, during which\n\ntime there is no school work. This practice work is assigned as nearly as possible\n\naccording to the desires of the students.\n\nTuition at Columbia is on the usual graduate basis and therefore more ex-\n\npensive than formerly. Arrangements, however, can be made for part time work\n\nin some nearby library. Three hundred and fifty dollars will probably cover the\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 9\n\nschool cost. Room and board are to be had at very reasonable rates in Johnson\n\nHall, the woman's graduate dormitory of the University. The whole year might be\n\nhad living expenses and school for $1,100.\n\nThe personnel of the school is pleasing. One finds college graduates from all\n\nsections of the United States and a few from foreign countries. Tea at four in\n\nthe afternoon is a custom of librarians. Sometimes most delightful personages are\n\ninvited to meet the school then such as Christopher Morley, Babbette Deutsch,\n\nAlfred Knopf.\n\nTo one considering this work the choice of undergraduate courses is of ut-\n\nmost importance. The advice of experts in the field is to take all modern languages\n\npossible, especially German, French and Spanish. A general liberal arts education is\n\nthe prime requisite.\n\nA winter in New York City is in itself a liberal education. I count that girl\n\nfortunate who is able to combine special training for her vocation with a year's\n\nresidence in this most fascinating city.\n\nOLD HEIDELBERG\n\nThe University of Heidelberg offers a six-weeks' holiday course for foreigners, in-\n\ncluding lectures and practical instruction in the German language. The lectures\n\ncover a wide range, dealing with subjects drawn from German literature, folk-lore,\n\nmusic, art, pedagogy, history and economics.\n\nThe historic old Castle of Heidelberg, the museum and botanical gardens, will be\n\nvisited, and excursions will be conducted by the professors to nearby cities and points\n\nof interest. The fees for these courses will be twenty-five dollars; board and room\n\nmay be had in Heidelberg for the six weeks for sixty dollars. Anyone interested in\n\nstudying at the University of Heidelberg may obtain more detailed information from\n\nthe Institute of International Education, 522 5th Ave., New York City.\n\nI. F. U. W. COUNCIL MEETING, VIENNA, JULY, 1927\n\nThe Austrian members of the International Federation of University Women were\n\nhostesses to the Council on the occasion of its eleventh meeting, which was held in\n\nthe University of Vienna from the 2 5 th to the 2 8th of July. Besides the officers of\n\nthe Federation, delegates from twenty-one national groups were present, the Ameri-\n\ncan Association being represented by Mrs. Edgarton Parsons, of New York.\n\nFrau Dr. von Zahn-Harnack, the German delegate, spoke on the interest of the\n\nFederation in establishing international fellowships. Professor Winifred Cullis (of\n\nGreat Britain) gave an account of the clubhouses established in many parts of the\n\nworld. Mme. Puech (France) spoke on international intellectual co-operation, dis-\n\ncussing the work of the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Co-operation.\n\nThe question of inequalities in the educational standards of various countries was\n\ndiscussed by Mrs. Skonhoft (Norway). The Council accepted the invitation of the\n\nSpanish delegate, Dr. Clara Campoamor, to hold its next meeting in Madrid.\n\nTHE SPIRES OF OXFORD\n\nIn these latter days, with our broadening horizons, there has come to many\n\nAmerican college students a glimpse of those towers of Oxford that through the\n\nages have beckoned scholars of all lands. These young persons have been fired with\n\nthe ambition to study within sight and sound of these spires. It's a laudable ambition,\n\na splendid idea, but there is not room for all of them! Not every student is quali-\n\nfied for admission. The Rhodes Scholarships have provided opportunities for a\n\nnumber of men to satisfy this ambition, and returned Rhodes Scholars have been a\n\nsource of information about Oxford for men students. Their enthusiasm has added\n\n10 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nto the eagerness of women students to study there, but in the nature of the case\n\nthey have not been able to disseminate information about the admission of such\n\nstudents to the University. It is in regard to the women students especially that this\n\ncolumn is written.\n\nAlthough women students have been admitted to lectures and examinations for a\n\ngood many years, it is only since 1920 that they have been admitted to degrees in\n\nthe University. Even now, the number of students in the women's colleges is not\n\nlarge. But each year, in the interests of international friendship, the women's colleges\n\nSomerville, Lady Margaret Hall, St. Hugh's, St. Hilda's, and the Society of Oxford\n\nHome Students reserve a limited number of places for American women graduates.\n\nThe candidates are admitted on the basis of recommendation of a committee on selec-\n\ntion in this country, of which President Mary E. Woolley, of Mount Holyoke Col-\n\nlege, is chairman a sub-committee of the Committee on International Relations of\n\nthe American Association of University Women.\n\nThe task of selection, difficult enough in itself, is complicated by two things:\n\nfirst, the fact that the Oxford colleges welcome warmly only students who will re-\n\nmain for two years and read for an Oxford degree; and second, the profound lack of\n\nunderstanding by many \"intending students\" of what an English university, and\n\nespecially Oxford, really is of what it offers to and expects from its members.\n\nProbably the very best thing for any student who contemplates study at Ox-\n\nford to do is to read \"Oxford of Today,\" by Crosby and Aydelotte. President Ayde-\n\nlotte, of Swarthmore, himself a Rhodes Scholar, knows American colleges and stu-\n\ndents, and he knows Oxford. This manual for Rhodes Scholars, if it were more wide-\n\nly known and read, would considerably lighten our darkness. Women students should\n\napply for detailed information and for blanks of application to the committee on\n\nselection.\n\nDegrees: Students are admitted to read for degree of B.A. (Honours), and for\n\nthe research degrees of B.Litt., B.Sc, and D.Phil.\n\nThe Oxford B.A. In \"Oxford of Today,\" Laurence Crosby says: \"This degree is,\n\npractically speaking, the most important and certainly the most characteristic Oxford\n\ndegree.\" Students who have received an American A.B., but who have done no inde-\n\npendent research and even those who have done some graduate work, are admitted to\n\nread for the Honour Schools for this degree. (It should be noted that the term\n\n\"school\" here means a set of university examinations and a distinct course of lectures,\n\nnot an institution with separate administrative officers and separate buildings.) The\n\nHonour Schools are: Literae Humaniores (consisting of \"Honour Moderations\" in\n\nGreek and Latin Language and Literature, and a final examination in Greek and Latin\n\nLanguage and Ancient History and Philosophy) ; Mathematics; Natural Science (in\n\none branch) ; Jurisprudence; Modern History; Theology; Oriental Studies; English\n\nLanguage and Literature; Modern Languages; Philosophy; Politics and Economics.\n\nThe work for this degree is specialized, being taken in one of the Honour Schools.\n\nEach school is devoted to one subject or a group of closely related subjects belonging\n\nto the same general field of knowledge. Graduates of approved American colleges\n\nusually complete the work for the B.A. degree in two years.\n\nThe M.A. It should be especially noted that the Oxford M.A., like the Cam-\n\nbridge M.A., is consequent on the B.A. without further study or research. It is con-\n\nferred in the 21st term after matriculation, provided the candidate has kept his name\n\non the books of his college and paid during the period certain college and university\n\ndues and fees.\n\nThe B.Litt. Oxford B.A.'s are admitted to this degree, and American students\n\nwho have done a year or two's research after receiving the B.A. should choose care-\n\nfully between the B.Litt. and the Honours B.A. The courses for the B.Litt. are of\n\nnarrower scope. The candidate begins her work as a probationer student under a\n\nsupervisor, receives training in research, and, when the supervisor is satisfied of her\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 11\n\nfitness to pursue independent research and approves her subject, supplicates for per-\n\nmission to read for the B.Litt. Residence in Oxford of six terms is required for the\n\ndegree. A student who has already kept residence for the B.A. will be allowed to\n\ntake the B.Litt. or B.Sc. after three more terms' residence.\n\nThe B.Sc. See B.Litt. (The course for the B.Sc. omits the probationer stage.)\n\nThe D.Phil. Only students who are at an advanced stage of research can be\n\nadvised to apply to be admitted for this degree.\n\nTerms: The Oxford academic year is divided into three terms of eight weeks\n\neach, beginning about the middle of October, the middle of January, and the end of\n\nApril. No list of lectures is published until about three days before each term, and\n\n\"classes,\" in the American sense of the word, are not part of the Oxford scheme.\n\nExpenses: Board, lodging, and tuition are estimated at about 45 to 60 per term\n\n($225-$300). There are in addition certain expenses on admission, and certain fees\n\nand dues. In the Society of Oxford Home Students the expense varies according to\n\nrooms board and lodging costing from 3 to 5 a week. This does not take into\n\naccount the expenses of vacations between terms, about six weeks in length, nor of\n\nsuch expenditures as are necessary for books, clothes, travelling, entertaining, etc.\n\nPresident Aydelotte estimates that a Rhodes Scholar could not expect to meet his ex-\n\npenses under $2,000.\n\nUndergraduates: American undergraduates may apply for admission to Oxford\n\nin the regular way, on a basis of competitive examination and personal interview,\n\ntaking their chances with the English candidates.\n\nLectures: It is possible for residents in Oxford to obtain permission to attend lec-\n\ntures, but such persons are not in any sense members of the University, and under\n\nsuch circumstances it is difficult to get tutorial assistance.\n\nA summer vacation course for American women teachers and graduates will be\n\ngiven in Oxford, England, from July 6th to 27th, 1928. The subject, \"England in\n\nthe Nineteenth Century: 1815-1900,\" will be treated in its various aspects literary,\n\nhistorical, artistic, political, economic and scientific. There will be lectures by emi-\n\nnent men and women, and discussion groups under the leadership of tutors. Excur-\n\nsions to Stratford, Sulgrave Manor, and other places will be undertaken. The fee\n\nof $125 will include full board and residence in the Women's Colleges, lectures and\n\nclasses, and one or two excursions.\" This is an opportunity for a glimpse of what\n\nOxford is stimulating lectures by English scholars, classes with tutors, such as\n\nthe Oxford student has, a view of England through English eyes, a growing ap-\n\npreciation of the distracting beauty of Oxford, a knowledge of the friendliness of\n\nEnglish hostesses. Application blanks can be obtained from the secretary of the\n\nCommittee on International Relations, Miss Esther Caukin, 1634 Eye St., N. W.,\n\nWashington, D. C.\n\nA STUDENT IN PARIS\n\nBy VIVIAN LITTLE\n\n(Following her graduation in '24, Vivian Little studied in Paris for a year on a\n\nscholarship offered by the French Government to American college students.)\n\nChanging autumn skies, dinner by lamplight, yellowing leaves on trees that are\n\nbeginning to shiver of what do they remind you? Every fall they brought back\n\nto Anatole France memories of the return to school, of the daily walks through the\n\nLuxembourg Gardens on October days when the Gardens are \"a little sad and more\n\nbeautiful than ever, for it is the time when the leaves fall one by one onto the\n\nwhite shoulders of the statues.\"\n\nIf you have classes at the Sorbonne, and live near enough to walk to them every\n\nmorning, you will soon understand why those days were memorable, and why so\n\ni 2 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nmany of the French poets have found their Muse in the Luxembourg. In fact, the\n\nMuses love the whole Latin Quarter. And the Sorbonne is the heart of it.\n\nI wish you could loiter at one of the tables on the sidewalk in the Rue Soufflot,\n\nthe rendezvous of the students and artists of the Quarter, at the bookstalls of the\n\nOdeon, or at the windows of the fascinating book-shops in front of the Pantheon.\n\nThis is that \"promised land of booksellers where every byway seems one more shelf in\n\nan endless library.\"\n\nBut it is \"le jour de la rentree,\" so you must be about the business of registering\n\nfor classes, and finding a pension. You will do well to stop at the entrance next\n\nto the Sorbonne Chapel, and buy from the concierge, the University of Paris Catalogue,\n\nthe \"Livret de L'Etudiant.\" It has in it all the information you can possibly need\n\nthe requirements for admission, directions for registration, information about the\n\ndegrees, diplomas, and certificates offered, schedules of classes, names and addresses of\n\nall the professors and some valuable suggestions for solving the problems of your social\n\nlife and material welfare. There you will find addresses of recommended pensions,\n\nand restaurants, explanation of the various student organizations and societies, of\n\nthe loans and scholarships available, suggestions for possible employment for those who\n\nmay desire places as part-time stenographers, teachers, or tutors. This catalogue will\n\nundoubtedly be your best friend for the first few days, and Monsieur Henri Goy,\n\nsecond-best. He is the director of the Bureau des Renseignements. He will see you\n\nthrough the registration if you can produce a birth certificate, a passport, an identity\n\ncard, your Agnes Scott diploma, and any others you might have. There is a small\n\nregistration fee. The tuition is very low ranging from seventy to four hundred\n\nfrancs. The exact amount depends on the degree for which you are a candidate,\n\nand the kind of courses you take.\n\nThe courses are of two sorts, the \"cours publics,\" which are open to everyone\n\ngratuitously, and the \"cours fermes,\" which may be followed by the registered students\n\nonly. The Sorbonne is primarily for graduate work in philology and French literature.\n\nBut there are for the foreigners who possess an elemental knowledge of the language,\n\ncertain courses which give surveys of French civilization. Each course is a three-hour\n\none, and consists of two lectures a week, and an hour of \"travaux partiques.\" After\n\nhaving completed at least four of these courses and successfully passed the examinations\n\ngiven at the end of the semester, the student receives the \"diplome d'etudes de civilisa-\n\ntion francaise.\" This is the easiest of all the diplomas to obtain. The majority of the\n\nothers require at least two years residence. Of these, the \"diplome d'etudes uni-\n\nversitaires\" and of the doctorates, the \"doctorat de L'universite,\" are generally taken\n\nby foreign students.\n\nThere are no dormitories at the Sorbonne, so you must seek room and board in\n\nFrench families or in a \"pension.\" If you are very lucky, you may find a place in\n\nthe home of one of the professors. The American University Women's Paris Club\n\noffers a charming home, to those who are not trying to forget the English language.\n\nThe American University Union will give you a list of addresses and help you to\n\nmake living arrangements. Then, there is the \"Maison des Etudientes,\" where many\n\nof the students find pension. And out near the Pare Montsouris, on a seventy-acre\n\ncampus, a University City is being built. It will have eventually a population of\n\nthree thousand five hundred students of all nationalities. The aim of the City is to\n\nfurnish at low prices warm, comfortable, cheerful rooms for students. If you have\n\nlived a while in the Latin Quarter you will appreciate that adjective \"warm,\" and the\n\nfact that each building of the City is to have \"chauffrage central.\" Each nation is\n\nconstructing its own dormitory on land given by the University of Paris. Seven of\n\nthe buildings have been completed and have not a single vacant room in the dormi-\n\ntories. Of the foreign buildings, those finished or under construction are the Canadian,\n\nBelgian, and Argentine. Japan and England have secured the funds necessary for\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 13\n\ntheirs. Spain, Holland, Cuba and Mexico have applied for building sites. And funds\n\nare now being raised for an American House. So in the near future, you may live\n\nin this student city. The greatest advantage of this sort of life is, of course, the\n\nassociation with students from all over the world, who are thrown together at\n\nmeals, in sports, in the student organizations and in the varied activities of this \"new\n\nLatin Quarter.\"\n\nWhile this delightful colony is only in the making, there exist already several\n\nstudent organizations to which you will enjoy belonging. First of all, there is the\n\n\"office National des Universites et Ecoles francaises.\" It seems to participate in all\n\nthe student activities and interests. As its aim is to make known to the outside the\n\nworkings of the French educational system, and to encourage the international ex-\n\nchange of students and professors it is always an unfailing source of information on\n\nany subject educational. If you need help in the least problem, you will find it there.\n\nThe director, Monsieur Petit-Dutaillis, has even been called Mr. Petty Details. But\n\nhis work and influence, and that of the office is enormous. And their services to\n\ngovernments, universities, foreign schools and societies for the development of the\n\nstudy of French, of French libraries, museums, etc., are invaluable.\n\nThe assembly room and library of the American University Women's Club will\n\nprobably prove to be the most homelike spots that you will find in Paris. And after-\n\nnoon teas in the garden or on the sun-parlor overlooking it, will be among the\n\nmost enjoyable hours of your sojourn there.\n\nThe library, reading room, and study-hall of the American University Union are\n\nfavorite haunts of the students. And downstairs in the Atelier, they gather every\n\nSunday evening for the musical programmes and plays put on by the students them-\n\nselves and sponsored by the American Church.\n\nAnother, and in many ways, the most interesting, of these organizations is the\n\n\"Association d'Acceuil aux Etudiants des Etats-Unis.\" It was formed by a group of\n\nFrench families who wished to express their gratitude to the young American volun-\n\nteers who fought at the beginning of the war with the Escadrille Lafayette, the\n\nAmerican Ambulance and Field Service, and to the \"godmothers\" and \"godfathers\"\n\nwho adopted the thousands of war orphans. These families of the Amico-America\n\ngroup receive the American students of Paris in their homes, and entertain them all\n\nduring the school year. In a word, each family \"adopts\" temporarily a student or\n\ntwo. They arrange excursions to towns of interest around Paris at Christ-\n\nmas, to Rouen, probably; and at Easter, to the battlefields around Verdun. Then\n\nthere are many sightseeing trips in old Paris. This is a unique organization and one\n\nthat is very successful in realizing its aim to make known to the students an\n\naspect of French life the family life which many of them would miss but for the\n\nfriends made there.\n\nOf course, a year at the Sorbonne is not all work, for there is Paris all around\n\nyou. And Paris but that is another theme.\n\nETERNAL ROME\n\nBy LESLIE GAYLORD\n\n(Miss Gaylord, who received her master's degree from the University of Chicago,\n\nhas been instructor in the mathematics department at Agnes Scott for the past five\n\nyears. In 1925-26 she obtained a leave of absence from the college to spend a year\n\nstudying at the University of Rome on a scholarship offered by the Italy-America\n\nSociety. During the summer of 1927, Miss Gaylord chaperoned a group of Agnes\n\nScott students and alumnae in Europe.)\n\nIn comparison with the number of American students who flock to the uni-\n\nversities of France, particularly to the Sorbonne, those availing themselves of the\n\nopportunities for study in the Italian universities are few. This very fact of the\n\n14 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nscarcity of Americans is to me one of the major arguments in favor of the Italian\n\nuniversity, for it results in personal interest and cordiality on the part of professors\n\nand fellow students and affords an opportunity for an American to become really\n\nacquainted with students of another nation. At the University of Rome I found\n\neveryone most hospitable to foreign students and eager to do all possible to en-\n\ncourage an exchange of students with other countries. The professors gave\n\nmost generously of their time and counsel: one held weekly at his home a\n\nseminar for foreign students (we were of six different nationalities), which was no\n\npart of his scheduled work.\n\nIt is difficult to speak of the University of Rome as a unit, for it is lacking en-\n\ntirely in centralization. Its many departments are scattered over the city and have\n\nabsolutely no intercourse with one another. There is no printed catalogue; each\n\nprofessor begins his lectures when he pleases. This may be six weeks or more after the\n\nso-called official date of opening. Classes are conducted entirely as formal lectures;\n\nattendance is voluntary and the student's credit rests wholly upon the final examina-\n\ntion, which may be taken at the conclusion of the course or any time thereafter\n\nthat the student may wish to present himself.\n\nThe foreign student may enroll either as a listener, for which no tuition is\n\ncharged, or as a candidate for the laurea, in which case he is charged only half the\n\nregular tuition either by way of courtesy, or as encouragement to foreigners. In\n\neither case it is necessary to present full credentials from birth certificate to diploma,\n\nduly legalized by an Italian consul in the United States, and officially translated into\n\nthe Italian language.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention as the first essential for study in an Italian\n\nuniversity a knowledge of the language. Summer schools for foreigners are conducted\n\nin many of the Italian universities, giving short and comprehensive courses in the\n\nlanguage and literature. Private instruction may be had at low rates, or in ex-\n\nchange for English lessons, and a knowledge of the language sufficient to carry on\n\nwork at the university can be acquired in a comparatively short time.\n\nThe university makes no provision for living accommodations for students. There\n\nare, however, numerous pensions where Americans can live most comfortably at\n\nmoderate rates; also the International Federation of University Women has an ar-\n\nrangement with one of the hotels whereby members of that organization can live\n\nthere most reasonably.\n\nIt is needless to speak of all that Rome as a city has to offer the sojourner there;\n\nrather would I complain of the diversity of attractions, and the futility of attempting\n\nto explore them all in the short span of one year! Rome is still the Eternal City,\n\nthe center of the world's art and history, and a lifetime would be too short a period\n\nin which to absorb all that it offers to one seeking knowledge.\n\nThe University of Rome is only one of seventeen universities, administered by\n\nthe Italian government, similar in organization and standards, though varying in the\n\nprominence of different departments. One of these, the university of Bologna, was\n\nthe first university established in Europe, as well as the first to admit a\n\nwoman within its halls: in 1400 Andrea Novella, the first woman to wear the\n\ndoctor's gown, was made Professor of Law in the University of Bologna, under the\n\namusing restriction that she must be separated from the male members of her class\n\nby a curtain! In the five centuries that have elapsed since that day, Italy has de-\n\nveloped a system of co-educational universities, unlike those of any other country,\n\nind as she took the lead then in educational progress, so today her universities rank\n\nimong the first.\n\nIf you are planning to study in Europe and are investigating the merits of various\n\nuniversities, may I ask that you do not forget that \"beyond the Alps lies Italy?\"\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 15\n\nSTUDYING FRENCH IN GENEVA\n\nBy CARA HINMAN\n\n(Miss Hinman is a member of the class of '29. The winter following her sopho-\n\nmore year at Agnes Scott she spent studying in Switzerland.)\n\nGeneva, Switzerland, is an ideal place to study French. It is truly French in\n\ntongue and tradition in spite of the fact that it is part of the Swiss nation. The\n\nlanguage of Geneva, with a few minor differences, is the same as that of Paris. Be-\n\nhind all the international spirit of the town, is carefully preserved the French way\n\nof doing and thinking, purified by the wholesomeness of the mountain atmosphere of\n\nthe Alps.\n\nThere are so many things to tell about this historically renowned town besides\n\nits great international assemblies, that it is necessary to confine oneself to the part\n\nwhich is of immediate interest to the readers of the Quarterly the university and the\n\nstudent life.\n\nWhen we went to Geneva to settle for the winter, the first thing of importance\n\nwas to find a place to live, for there are no dormitories in European universities.\n\nThrough the American Express office, the International Students' Union, and the\n\nsecretary of the university, we obtained names of recommended families and pensions.\n\nThen it was a real task to find the right one, for we were hard to please with our\n\nrequirements. The home must be near the university, only French must be spoken\n\nin the family, the house must be warm (the French people do not heat their houses\n\nnearly as much as we do) . The average charge for board in Geneva in a nice private\n\nfamily is $60 a month. But it does not stop there: that is only the \"first price.\"\n\nHeating, lighting, baths, afternoon tea, even eggs for the \"petit dejeuner,\" are\n\nextra. The board really amounts to about $80 a month. We finally found a home\n\nwhich filled all our requirements.\n\nAfter getting settled in our new home, we went to the university to arrange\n\nmy course of study. We made an appointment with the rector of the university,\n\nMonsieur Rappard, who was very gracious and spoke beautiful English. After satis-\n\nfying himself that I was pleasantly located, and informing himself as to my plans\n\nfor a course of study, he asked me if I was interested in any of the fine arts.\n\nHe explained that the Geneva Conservatory and the university collaborate; that is,\n\nthe students of the one are encouraged to take courses in the other. He also sug-\n\ngested taking lessons at the Dalcroze Institute. Fie emphasized the importance of\n\nrounding out the mental and spiritual development by the study of the arts.\n\n\"I can not help you much in selecting your course,\" continued Monsiuer Rappard,\"\n\nas our plan of work is so entirely different from that of the American university.\n\nUntil recently there have been no American college students trying to exchange a\n\nyear here for one in the American college. In the last three years there have been\n\nquite a few students doing this, but the courses here do not correspond with yours.\n\nIf the influx of students continues, courses of study can be established to meet the\n\nneeds. The initiative, however, will have to come from the American colleges.\"\n\nDuring the first three weeks of a semester the students visit the various classes\n\nand make their choice of courses before registering. Meanwhile, M. Rappard sent\n\nme to M. Martin, dean of the \"Faculte des Lettres,\" who would give me more definite\n\ninformation in the line of studies I was to pursue. But the dean of literature could\n\nnot be of much more assistance than the rector: he did not understand my col-\n\nlege catalogue. The courses in European universities are not standardized as they\n\nare in America: they are more flexible. There are no Freshman, Sophomore, Junior\n\nand Senior years there: a student may take as many years as he likes to complete his\n\nwork and acquire his diploma. My original plan of substituting a year's work in\n\nGeneva for my Junior year at Agnes Scott seemed so hopeless that I decided to give\n\nit up and take advantage of the wonderful opportunity offered me in Geneva in\n\n16 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nlearning to speak French, especially as in other courses I could do quite as well\n\nat Agnes Scott. To this practical course I added courses in French literature.\n\nIn the \"Ecole Practique\" twelve hours a week were devoted to the study in\n\nFrench of advance grammar, translation of English into French, oral and written\n\ncomposition, conversation, and phonetics or pronunciation. The requirement for en-\n\ntrance at the university is a degree called the \"Bacchaulaureate,\" or its equivalent.\n\nThis is about equal to the completion of the Sophomore .year in our best American\n\ncolleges. My credentials from Agnes Scott did not come until later, but I was taken\n\nat my word and allowed to enter, without examination. There is no standard tuition\n\nfee for a year's work. The matriculation fee is $5, the charge for courses is $1.20\n\na semester hour. As the \"Ecole Practique\" is a special course taught by private in-\n\nstructors, not paid by the state, it has its own fee of $36 for the twelve semester\n\nhours.\n\nI consider my actual work in the university a small part of my instruction.\n\nWherever I went French was spoken. I took advantage of the concerts, operas,\n\nand theatrical performances, of which Geneva, being central in Europe, has a fine\n\nchoice. The professors' families were very cordial in inviting students to their homes\n\nand kept things lively for us. My professors in the university were men of the highest\n\ntype. One of them, M. Velleman, was an internationally renowned interpreter of\n\nEuropean languages, and spent much of his time at the League of Nations. He\n\nwas a personal friend of Woodrow Wilson's long before Wilson was President. An-\n\nother professor, M. Portier, was head of the dramatic department in the Moscow\n\nConservatory before the war. Our professor of phonetics, M. Thudicum, had such\n\na keen ear that after a few words of French from any foreigner, he could detect the\n\naccent and tell the student from what section of any country he came, even to the\n\ntown, and could often tell if he had lived in other countries than his own.\n\nThe International Students' Union has attractive club rooms where one could\n\nalways find congenial companions for recreation hours. Here students of all nation-\n\nalities and from each of the Geneva institutions met for frivolity and exchange of\n\nideas. On Thursday, the weekly holiday, and on week-ends, the students went in the\n\ntrain to nearby mountain resorts for winter sports. During Christmas vacation they\n\nwent to \"stations d'hiver,\" and had their fill of skiing, skating, tobogganing, and\n\nmountain climbing. In spring and summer, tennis, swimming and boating follow\n\nwinter sports. All this takes the place of our organized college athletics. Many\n\nbeautiful homes of English and American residents in Geneva are open to students.\n\nThus there is no lack of social life and recreation.\n\nI thought, spoke, slept, ate, drank and breathed French to stich an extent that\n\nwhen I awoke on the Crescent Limited in the good old United States, I looked at\n\nthe conductor and said, \"Comment?\" I lost out a year towards my college degree,\n\nbut I feel that my time and effort were by no means wasted. I hope that in the\n\nfuture Agnes Scott will establish a connection with the European universities, so that\n\nstudents majoring in a foreign language, may be able to spend their Junior year\n\nstudying in Europe.\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF GRENOBLE\n\nBy MARION GREEN\n\n(Marion Green, who will be graduated from Agnes Scott in 1929, spent the year\n\n1925-26 as a student at this French university.)\n\nThose who really want more than a passing acquaintance with French and would\n\nlike to acquire it in the most pleasant surroundings possible, would do well to go to\n\nGrenoble, France, and attend the university there. Grenoble, a town of about\n\nseventy thousand inhabitants, is situated at the foot of the French Alps. In the\n\nwinter time when the tall peaks are covered with snow a huge autobus piled inside\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 17\n\nwith students and outside with skiis plows its way every Sunday far up into the\n\nAlps to the Grande Chartreuse region where skiing is indulged in with great zeal. In\n\nthe springtime, the mountains are even more beautiful, for as the snow melts jonquils\n\nand lilies of the valley bloom in profusion on the slopes. During the summer session\n\nspecial excursions into the \"land of eternal snow\" are arranged by the university.\n\nA course for foreigners is offered at the University in three sessions during the\n\nyear from November to February, from March to June, and from June to the last\n\nof August. This includes for the tuition fee of ninety francs, work in French poetry,\n\nprose, history, civilization, psychology and two courses leading to the \"certificat\n\nd'Etudes Francaises\" a composition and translation conference. An Institution of\n\nPhonetics is maintained in connection with the university, and many delightful hours\n\nare spent in trying to shape the lips so that the right sounds will issue forth. Foyer,\n\nor dormitory life is very interesting, as well as cheap, costing only about three dol-\n\nlars per month. Here are girls of every nationality, and you will be consoled by\n\nthe fact that it is just as hard for a Chinese or Rumanian to speak French correctly\n\nas it is for you. If you do not care for dormitory life, there are many cultured\n\nfamilies at Grenoble where one can live in a real French atmosphere. Some of our\n\nbest friends were French girls to whom we gave exchange lessons one in French,\n\nthe next in English. The French girls were especially keen on learning American slang\n\nbut could never apply it at the right time in the right place. The \"certificat\" men-\n\ntioned above is obtained by passing an examination given at the end of each session.\n\nIt is not, however, required of the course.\n\nGrenoble is a very cultured city, many of the best artists in France and else-\n\nwhere coming there in concerts, plays, or operas. And as it is in the center of\n\nFrance, Paris, Italy, or the Riviera are easily reached in holidays.\n\nIf you do not know much French you will find ample opportunity to learn it\n\nhere. If you do know French well, you will enjoy the courses and atmosphere all\n\nthe more.\n\nWHAT PRICE GRADUATE WORK?\n\nThat American institution Mr. Rube Goldberg originated the well-known\n\nsentence, \"Now you've got it, what are you going to do with it?\" This is pertinent\n\nto graduate degrees as well as to a number of other things.\n\nWhen you finally have a graduate degree in your grasp, and look back over the\n\nway you have come, do you find it was worth all that it cost? Would you advise\n\nothers to go on with graduate work? Standing at commencement time with your\n\nnewly acquired B.A. diploma, and looking far ahead, counting the cost, dividing up\n\nthe years of your life into the most profitable employments, do you think you will be\n\nwise in devoting some of those years to further organized study? By \"most profit-\n\nable,\" I do not mean necessarily in money profits; by \"cost,\" I mean cost of health,\n\nof time, of creative energies. Years are prescious things. Is she who spends them in\n\ngraduate study wise?\n\nAs of every other subject under the sun, much can be said on both sides. The\n\nmajority of the articles in this Quarterly so ardently advocate graduate work, that a\n\nlittle leaven of opinion on the opposite side may not be amiss. Two anonymous\n\nalumnae speak very feelingly on the subject.\n\n\"So obvious and laudable are the virtues of graduate study that numbers will\n\nrise up and call it blessed. I am not among them; I choose rather to set forth cer-\n\ntain imperative disadvantages thorns that mightily beset the rose.\n\n\"Among graduate students there are several types. There is the practical indi-\n\nvidual who invests in graduate work as he does in shoes and soap, because it is indis-\n\npensible to his profession teaching: more degrees, more dollars. Then there is the\n\n18 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\ngenial soul who continues academic pursuits as the line of least resistance. Habits of\n\nstudy have come to fit him like an old coat. It is pleasanter to get another degree or\n\nso than engage in business wholly new, for that demands the learning of new tricks.\n\nAnd there is the genuine enthusiast who would drink deep of beauty and truth, in the\n\ncompany of the immortals. They may have varied motives but they all share one\n\ncommon reward: they are cheated of much of the fullness of life during the year\n\nwhen they could best enjoy it.\n\n\"Too much life about classroom and campus is enervating. A college is not a\n\nworld in miniature. The song that mourns the Seniors \"f-a-r out in the wide, wide\n\nworld\" implies the truth that the college is a corner cosily fenced away from the\n\nrest of life, with special conditions, conventions, requirements. It offers what\n\nSylvia Thompson in \"The Hounds of Spring\" calls \"a temporary artificial irresponsi-\n\nbility, a freedom to read and wander and think one's own thoughts and see one's\n\nown friends.\" This freedom is probably a good thing for a few years, conducive\n\nas it must be to a liberal attitude, a broad vision, a spirit of inquiry. But it should\n\nbe granted only to the adolescent. One who has reached maturity ought to get\n\nout and rub his theories up against the hoi-polloi of actual conditions. Lingering\n\ntoo long in the dim cloister makes one blink on coming outside, where there is\n\nsuch brilliant sunlight and sharp shadows.\n\n\"The academic life is, of course, a sort of living; but it is second-hand seeing\n\nthings through other people's eyes eyes expert and gifted, but after all not as\n\nsatisfying as one's own. Vicarious living is a pallid substitute for actual experience.\n\n\"Now your graduate student may conceivably prefer vicarious life among im-\n\nmortals to actual life among mediocre contemporaries, and perhaps he has a right to\n\nindulge his preference. But there is certainly where purely creative activity is con-\n\ncerned, another objection to graduate work. Formal study tends to destroy original-\n\nity. Research, though termed original, follows certain grooves, involves wearying\n\ndetail of note-taking, card-indexing, compiling of bibliographies, delving in countless\n\ndry-as-dust tomes. It has a deadly effect upon enthusiasm. Some geniuses survive\n\nyears of formal study, but if their creative ability continues to flourish it is in spite\n\nof, not because of, the experience.\n\n\"Such, then, are my 'impressive disadvantages.' They do not deter the hoards\n\nof aspirants to degrees from their onslaught of the universities. For graduate study\n\nis a phase of our modern cult of uniformity. A.B.'s are but preliminary to M.A.'s\n\nand Ph.D.'s circumstances in keeping with an age that must have not a bob merely,\n\nbut a permanent likewise. Perhaps graduate study is a necessary adjunct to civilization\n\nas we interpret it. But it makes severe demands on the individual that might give him\n\npause: it robs him of spontaneity, of the capacity to create, and of wholesome delight\n\nin the life of emotion and action.\"\n\n\"Speaking very casually, I should say that general statements about the value of\n\ngraduate study would be difficult to make either pro or con. It depends so much\n\non the person and what she wants to do and what equipment she already has, and\n\nso on. But I will say this much: I think that the importance which is being placed\n\non graduate degrees is stupid. It is not only that one is economically handicapped.\n\nThere are a number of people who would accept the economic handicap, I suppose, if\n\nthey might have a position commensurable with their ability. As far as I am person-\n\nally concerned, neither of these reasons entered into my decision to do graduate work.\n\nI realized that I most wanted to do something connected with industry, and I chose the\n\nuniversity I did because of the personality of the head of my department there. Now,\n\nanother person might have gone about the whole thing differently getting a job in\n\nindustry, studying on the side, and so on. Maybe that would have been better. Maybe\n\nnot. Various people have various methods of approach.\n\n\"But I really do not feel capable of writing on this subject; I reckon graduate\n\nstudy just about wore me out!\"\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 19\n\nOPEN FORUM\n\n\"What do you think of the idea of an Agnes Scott House in New York?\" writes\n\none alumna studying there this winter. \"Couldn't an apartment for ten or twelve\n\nbe started as a second Alumnae House, where Agnes Scott girls in New York could\n\nstay together?\"\n\nOf course, to live in an apartment with ten other girls with the same background\n\nand from the same environment would defeat the purpose for which some of them\n\nchose New York City as a location for graduate work, but on the other hand, out\n\nof the number who are always to be found boarding often uncomfortably in the\n\nneighborhood of Columbia, ten or twelve might easily be found who would enjoy the\n\nhome environment. A person cannot live in New York at all nor attend Columbia\n\nclasses without coming in contact with numerous new and varied sorts of people\n\nand conditions. At the end of a day of these new, different people and experiences,\n\nSouthern girls working in New York might be quite content to rest in a place where\n\nEnglish was spoken, where the dear old familiar \"you all\" and \"I reckon\" and \"tote\"\n\nwere not verboten, and where in the midst of the world's seething melting pot, \"we\n\nall\" could preserve our individuality as Southerners, and find together a little of the\n\nwelcome atmosphere of home.\n\nWhat do other alumnae thing of this plan? You who have stayed in New York in\n\nthe past, if there had been such a place where you could have gotten a room and\n\nbreakfast at a reasonable rate, would you have boarded there? You who are in New\n\nYork now, do you wish you were living in such an apartment? And you others who\n\nare considering, even distantly, spending a while in that city, would the fact that\n\nan Agnes Scott House was available to you, influence you perhaps in your decision\n\nto go to New York?\n\nThe alumnae office is anxious to have letters from alumnae on this question.\n\n\"Do Agnes Scott girls smoke?\" ask numerous alumnae, in writing back to the\n\ncollege. I am constantly seeing articles in the newspapers about smoking in girls'\n\ncolleges in the country, appropriations for smoking-rooms at Vassar, etc., and I wonder\n\nhow our Agnes Scott students stand on the subject.\"\n\nAgnes Scott students stand together on the subject. \"Do we smoke? We do not,\"\n\nis their emphatic answer.\n\n\"Please tell me what happened to the triangular debates,\" writes an alumna. \"Did\n\nthey die a natural death?\"\n\nSince 1921 the three colleges, Randolph-Macon, Newcomb, and Agnes Scott\n\nhave had the agreement to meet annually in triangular debate. After the debate\n\non the Mexican agrarian situation last spring, Randolph-Macon withdrew from the\n\ntriangle, and the old agreement was terminated. Although Agnes Scott went down in\n\na double defeat last spring, we are very proud of our record over the period of seven\n\nyears covered by the debates. Out of fourteen debates Agnes Scott won eight; twice\n\nwith a double victory.\n\nBut although the triangular debates are a thing of the past, our debating days are\n\nfar from over. We are going further afield this year and seek to win new laurels.\n\nVassar College has accepted our challenge and their debating team will come to Agnes\n\nScott in the spring to meet us on our home ground. Besides the pleasure of crossing\n\nswords with a type new to us the Northern college girl we are glad of the op-\n\nportunity of entertaining on our campus representatives from this college with which\n\nwe have always had only the most pleasant relations.\n\n20 The Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nCOME BACK THANKSGIVING! MOVING PICTURES\n\nOF COMMENCEMENT\n\nThe week-end of Thanksgiving has been regarded for the past two years at\n\nAgnes Scott as homecoming time for alumnae. Commencement gatherings of alumnae\n\nare divided very sharply into class groups. The various working departments of the\n\ncollege are through then with their work for the year. But in November, no class\n\ndistinctions are made: old friend hobnobs with old friend; in the absence of an\n\nimminently graduating Senior class, the spotlight is turned on alumnae, and students\n\nand faculty, not occupied with packing for the summer vacation, have time to talk\n\nto \"the old girls.\" All old Agnes Scott girls who can possibly get back at Thanks-\n\ngiving, are urged to come then, regardless of class, and see the college departments\n\nin action.\n\nThe program for this year's Thanksgiving day will include interclass hockey\n\ngames Thursday morning, Tech-Auburn football game in Atlanta Thursday after-\n\nnoon, formal six o'clock dinner at Agnes Scott, faculty and alumnae coffee in Rebekah\n\nlobby.\n\nFriday morning the college schedule will be resumed, and alumnae can visit the\n\nart studio, gymnasium, or any other department that especially interests them. The\n\nannual alumnae party given on Miss Anna Young's birthday will be Friday afternoon\n\nbetween the hours of four and six in the Alumnae Flouse. (This occasion has been\n\ndesignated as the correct time for anyone who wishes to make a gift to the Alumnae\n\nHouse to do so. The crying need this year is for more cover. If you cannot give an\n\nentire blanket, give a small check which can be put with several more small checks\n\nto purchase the blanket!)\n\nSaturday night the Blackfriars will present three one-act plays, \"The Trysting-\n\nPlace,\" by Booth Tarkington; \"Purple Dream,\" by Donald Breed; and \"Figureheads,\"\n\nby Louise Saunders. Between plays, the moving. pictures taken last commencement of\n\nthe faculty, trustees, Senior and reunion classes will be run. Just this one feature\n\nis enough to draw you back, Alumnae, surely?\n\nBesides these definitely stated attractions, there are always good shows in Atlanta,\n\nthe new gym pool to be tried, old friends to chat with, and the two special gatherings\n\nfor some of you: a reunion of the old members of Hoasc, and the 1927 \"baby\n\nalumnae class\" dinner.\n\nThe maple trees on the campus are scarlet and gold brown oak leaves float down\n\nfrom the tall trees and cover the old brick walks and worn little crooked paths\n\nyou know so well. Won't you come back to Agnes Scott now?\n\nLOCAL ALUMNAE CLUBS\n\nSince the January issue of the Quarterly is to be turned over almost entirely to the local clubs,\n\n,t seems wise not to give club news at length in this issue. Mention should be made, however, of\n\n;everal of our outstanding clubs and their activities.\n\nOn October 18th, fifty-odd members of the Atlanta club met in the Alumnae House living\n\nroom, Dr. McCain being host on the occasion. The Atlanta club has bought almost six hundred\n\ndollars worth of new furniture for the living room, which will be in by Thanksgiving week-end. The\n\n:lub is busy planning their annual Christmas bazaar.\n\nOn the next night, the Decatur Alumnae Club met in the Alumnae House Tea Room for\n\ndinner. The fact that the Atlanta club meets in the afternoon and the Decatur Club meets at 6\n\nP. M. makes it very convenient for mothers and business girls, who join the club whose hours best\n\nsuit their own schedules.\n\nThe Alumnae House linen closet already bore testimony to the skill and love of the Marietta\n\nAlumnae Club, and on October 8th another beautiful box arrived from them, containing hemstitched\n\nlinen tea-table covers and napkins. Since afternoon tea is an institution on the campus, these lovely\n\ngifts have already fitted into the scheme of things and been used and enjoyed numberless times.\n\nThere are hardly enough alumnae in Columbia, S. C, to form an organized club, but on\n\nOctober 2 5th, nine of them met for luncheon at the Green Parrot Tea Room. The alumnae secretary,\n\nPolly Stone, who was in Columbia to represent Agnes Scott on the annual A. A. U. W. college day\n\nprogram, was the guest of the Columbia alumnae on this occasion.\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\n21\n\nONE ALUMNA'S GIFT\n\nIn September, Mrs. Augustine Sams, chairman\n\nof the grounds committee, received the following\n\nletter from an alumna:\n\n\"Having read in the June Quarterly of your\n\nefforts to beautify the college grounds, I thought\n\nthat you might like some evergreens from North-\n\nern Michigan. As this is the season at which we\n\ngather in the supply from the woods, I am\n\ntaking the liberty of sending you some spruce and\n\npines. I knew Anna Young, and I should be glad\n\nif some of the little evergreens could be planted\n\nnear the Aumnae House, which is named for\n\nher. You will find my name among those ex '96,\n\nand I am sure that Miss McKinney and Miss Hop-\n\nkins are the only residents that remember\n\n\"MARIE SCHLEY BROWN.\"\n\nThe little evergreens arrived the next week.\n\nA man from Wachendorff Florist Company was\n\nengaged to set them out, and they are all doing\n\nnicely. Two are planted in front of the Alumnae\n\nHouse, four along one side, and the others between\n\nthe Tea House entrance and Inman Hall. This\n\nwas one of the loveliest gifts that the Alumnae\n\nHouse has ever received.\n\nON THE CAMPUS\n\nSince Miss Hearon's illness, Miss Torrance has\n\ntaken charge of that flourishing organization,\n\nthe Lecture Association, which offers each year\n\nto the college community four prominent speak-\n\ners.\n\nThree contracts have already been signed for\n\nthis season, promising John Erskine in March,\n\nEllenor Cook on November 15th, and Dr. Gordon\n\nJennings Laing about the first of the year. John\n\nErskine is widely known as professor of English\n\nat Columbia University, and author of \"Helen of\n\nTroy,\" \"Galahad,\" and \"Adam and Eve.\" Miss\n\nCook does folk songs and dances in costume. Dr.\n\nLaing is dean of the graduate school at the Uni-\n\nversity of Chicago, and is a personal friend of\n\nseveral of our faculty members who have done\n\nwork there. The exact date of his lecture will\n\nbe decided later. In addition to these three the\n\nLecture Association promises one more speaker who\n\nhas not yet been chosen.\n\nThe Senior class this year is following exactly\n\nin the footsteps of the class of '27 so far as num-\n\nbers are concerned. Again there will be one hun-\n\ndred and three in the graduating class! Numbers\n\nin the other classes are: Juniors, 77; Sophomores,\n\n122; Freshmen, 15 5. There are twenty-nine girls\n\nwhose exact class standing has not yet been de-\n\ntermined, bringing the student body total up to\n\n48 6.\n\nThe Freshman class is a decidedly up-and-com-\n\ning group! They made their debut in college\n\naffairs by winning the coveted black cat from the\n\nSophomores on the annual Fresh -Sophomore stunt\n\nnight. Adele Arbuckle, daughter of . Professor and\n\nMrs. Howard Arbuckle, now of Davidson College,\n\nbut formerly of Agnes Scott, is chairman of the\n\nFreshman class.\n\nSeveral interesting dates and occasions have\n\nalready marked the college calendar. The open-\n\ning exercises of the college featured as the principal\n\nspeaker Dr. Wade H. Boggs, of Atlanta. Mr.\n\nWilfred B. Shaw, the alumni secretary of the\n\nUniversity of Michigan, and president of the\n\nAmerican Alumni Council, spoke on October 7th.\n\nOn November 4th, with the usual impressive cere-\n\nmony, the Seniors were formally invested with\n\ncap and gown. Margaret Bland, '20, Senior class\n\nfaculty member, made the address of the morning.\n\nOn November 15 th, Miss Ellenor Cook opened the\n\ncollege Lecture Association's year.\n\nFACULTY NOTES\n\nMiss Hopkins, beloved dean and \"College\n\nMother\" to every Agnes Scott girl, has received\n\na new honor. At the meeting of the board of\n\ntrustees of the college in May, she was elected to\n\na place on that body.\n\nDr. George P. Hayes, who succeeds Dr. Good\n\nas head of the English department, is a Harvard\n\nman. Elis latest teaching has been as head of\n\nthe English department of Robert College, in\n\nConstantinople. Mrs. Hayes, who is French, is\n\na charming addition to the circle of faculty\n\nwives.\n\nMiss Jean Davis is teaching at Chicago this\n\nyear, and to replace her, Agnes Scott now has\n\nas professor of sociology and economics Dr. James\n\nM. Wright, of Johns Hopkins.\n\nMiss Howson and Miss Phillippa Gilchrist are\n\nboth studying at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nDuring Miss Howson's leave, Miss Helen Gilroy,\n\nB.A. Bryn Mawr, Ph.D. University of Chicago,\n\nis acting as head of the physics department. Miss\n\nGilroy comes directly to us from Canton Chris-\n\ntian College in China. Elizabeth Lynn, '27, is\n\ntaking Miss Gilchrist's place.\n\nDr. Charles A. Logan, while on furlough from\n\nmission work in Japan, is assisting Mrs. Syden-\n\nstricker in the Bible department. Dr. Logan is\n\nthe father of Josephine (Logan) Hamilton, '2 3,\n\nand Mary Nelson Logan, '2 8.\n\nMiss Cleo Hearon had not sufficiently recovered\n\nfrom her summer's illness to take up her classes\n\nat the beginning of the fall session, so Miss Flor-\n\nence Smith, who is completing work on her doc-\n\ntor's thesis at Chicago, is supplying for her.\n\nMartha Stansfield is working on her Ph.D. at\n\nChicago, and in her absence, Charlotte Hammond,\n\n'17, is acting as assistant professor of Latin. Miss\n\nHammond took her M.A. degree at Chicago.\n\nSince Cora Morton deserted mathematics to be-\n\n:ome Mrs. Fraser Durrett, there was a vacancy\n\nin that department to be filled. Miss Grace\n\nStrouss, Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the Uni-\n\nversity of Georgia, was elected to this position.\n\nDaisy Frances Smith and Sterling Johnson are\n\nstudying at the University of Pennsylvania. Miss\n\nSmith's place is taken by Elizabeth Cheatham, '2 5;\n\nand Miss Johnson's by Helen Lewis, 27. Frances\n\nRainey, '27, is a fellow in chemistry.\n\nMiss Isabel Randolph is back this year as head\n\nof the Physical Education department. Miss Har-\n\nriet Haynes is on leave of absence. Miss Carrie\n\nCurie Sinclair is studying at William and Mary\n\nCollege in Virginia, and Miss Estelle North, of the\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin, is taking her place.\n\n22\n\nThe\n\nAgnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\n%\n\n\"LITTLE SISTERS\" in '27 IS\n\nma Mater\n\nand three\n\nNot only do the daughters of Agnes Scott alumnae choose Agnes Scott as their Al\n\ntoo, but \"so do the sisters and the cousins and the aunts!\" Thirty-three of the one hundred\n\nmembers of the 1927 graduating class have near relatives among the alumnae.

She is a Bryn\n\nMawr graduate, and has taught at Vassar College and at Canton Christian College\n\nin China.)\n\nTo acquire a complete idea of life in a foreign country it is well to picture the\n\nphysical surroundings, then the people and finally their aims and ambitions. We\n\narrive in Canton on an English river boat, landing at a warf along the Bund, if the\n\nstrike pickets are not too active, otherwise the boat anchors in mid-stream opposite\n\nShameen, the small foreign concession, and we go ashore in a launch. In either\n\ncase, as soon as the river steamer is anchored, sampans by the dozen crowd around her\n\nlike chicks about a hen. Some take off passengers; others boxes of canned goods or\n\nfish in barrels and still others are only interested in baskets of squawking chickens.\n\nOur way leads to the Bund and to rickshas, which, for twenty cents local silver, will\n\ntake us to the Lingnan University wharf, a small wooden shed containing a few\n\nbenches and a fruit stand, out of the sun and rain. There we \"talk price\" with a\n\nboat woman who will eventually agree to thirty cents, provided a \"tai fung\" is not\n\nthreatening. After about half an hour's row past hundreds of similar sampans, flat\n\nbottomed boats bringing fruit, vegetables and wood from up river, steamers pulling\n\nfive or six flower boats full of soldiers from Wampoa, and gaily painted salt junks, we\n\nreach our destination.\n\nThe entrance to Lingnan University is not through a grey stone arch nor along\n\na stately colonnade, merely a wooden gate in a barbed wire fence with a frame\n\nhouse to protect the gatekeeper. Time and money have been spent on the essentials;\n\ndecorations will come later. The campus covers about fifty acres of land which was\n\nbought literally grave by grave from the village people. In south China land which\n\ncannot be used for rice fields or vegetable gardens is the village burying ground.\n\nTrees now grow where there was only a barren hillside, and more than fifty brick\n\nbuildings in place of gravestones. Two dormitories house the college boys, one the\n\ngirls and four the Middle School. Just beyond the Middle School is the Oversea's\n\nSchool for Chinese boys born in foreign lands, many of whom know no word of\n\nChinese. In another group is the Primary School and way to the south, the Agricul-\n\ntural College with its silk filature and fruit farm.\n\nIf we arrive in the afternoon after most of the classes are over, the campus will\n\nbe full of boys playing basketball, tennis, socker, running, some swimming in the\n\npool by the north gate and one group from the Oversea's School playing baseball.\n\nWhere are the long shams, long nails and queues of the Chinese pictures? The\n\nlast two are a thing of the past for these students.\n\nThe next morning some long shams will appear. Many of the Chinese on the\n\nfaculty, especially those who have studied in the United States or Europe, have adopted\n\nforeign style clothes. The students also, who have lived in one of the port cities or\n\ntravelled much are as likely to wear foreign as Chinese dress. But in warm weather\n\nthey nearly all choose Chinese style, as it is much cooler. Classes begin at 7:3 5 in\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly 25\n\nthe morning and continue, with an hour for lunch, until 5 P. M., a few even until 6.\n\nThis is due to the limited space for classes and the wide range of subjects taught. In\n\nthe college of arts and sciences the curriculum reads much like that of any first\n\nclass college in the United States, except that Latin and Greek are absent and Chinese\n\nand Japanese take their places. Also Business Administration and the Sciences are\n\nmuch larger groups than modern languages. Originally, because this is a college\n\nstarted by Americans, and now, because there are so few text books of Western\n\nlearning translated into Chinese, most of the college instruction is given in English.\n\nThat necessitates the teaching of English in the lower schools as a second language to\n\ntheir own. One required science course is given the year before the students enter\n\ncollege. In spite of the difficulty of study in a foreign language these students do as\n\nwell as many freshmen college classes in this country.\n\nForeign music and foreign plays, adapted to their own modes of expression have\n\na strong appeal. And the Chinese are naturally gifted actors. To read \"The Doll's\n\nHouse\" on Wednesday, have group practices on Thursday and give the play, in\n\nChinese Friday night is typical of their methods. Most of the boys love to make\n\nspeeches and all are keenly interested in politics. The Nationalist movement is theirs\n\nas much as any one's, however high in rank or honored with years. In the production\n\nof foreign music they show more enthusiasm than skill, but can be trained to do very\n\ncreditable singing.\n\nIn recent years the work has been somewhat interrupted by government proclaimed\n\nholidays, but that is balanced by a longer school year and fewer vacations set by the\n\ncollege itself. Most of the students are eager to learn all that the West can teach,\n\nat the same time keeping a strong feeling of the superiority of their own nation in\n\nalmost everything but science. As an illustration of the desire of boys of High\n\nschool age for an education, there is one event of last spring: when the college was\n\nforced by local labor trouble to close for three months, two classes below college\n\nrank organized themselves, rented two floors in one of the hotels in Canton and asked\n\nmembers of the staff to come and lecture to them. Two weeks would be spent in-\n\ntensively on history and maybe the next two on physics. The surroundings were not\n\nconducive to quiet study but they stuck to it and completed their year's work.\n\nOf the staff more than half are Chinese, some foreign trained and some graduates\n\nof Chinese universities on the western plan. A few have the old style Chinese classical\n\neducation, but all speak English more fluently than the foreign staff, with a few excep-\n\ntions, speak Chinese. There must, of necessity, be some divergence of interest and\n\nactivities between the two groups. But the main interest is the same in both, the\n\nbuilding up of a Chinese University, under Christian influence, which shall be able\n\nto train its students to supply the needs of a great nation, and make itself one.\n\nlink in the chain of international friendship. At present international friendship is\n\nbeing stretched to the breaking point, but not there between foreign staff and Chinese\n\nstaff nor between foreign staff and students. It may be apropos to add that the\n\nuniversity held a summer session and has opened this fall under the new board of\n\ndirectors, of whom the majority are Chinese.\n\n26\n\nThe Agnes Scott Alumnae Quarterly\n\nConcerning Ourselves\n\nInstitute Alumnae News\n\nMyrtice Brown is secretary of the Southeastern\n\ndepartment of the Franklin Life Insurance Com-\n\npany in Atlanta.\n\nEmily (Divver) Moorer's only son, Ernest\n\nSamuel, Jr., is a Sophomore this year at the\n\nCitadel, a boy's military school in Charleston, S.
