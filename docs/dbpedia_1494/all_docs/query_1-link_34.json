But, after 10 years of investing blood, sweat, and tears towards creating and growing Community Funded, I am now working with people directly leveraging all I have learned. If you feel you need a sounding board, coaching, a person to help organize your thoughts and think that my 20 years of business, startup, fundraising, people management, and communications can help you thrive, don't hesitate to message me and let's start a conversation. I am a 10 year veteran with regards to the full spectrum of online fundraising and the tools that are available to non profits, as well as how to most effectively use them to engage your community. I also thrive deconstructing problems and assembling solutions. Lastly, I love supporting people and seeing them thrive. If I interacted with you in the past 10 years through Community Funded, don't hesitate to reach out and say hello! Onwards and upwards and I hope 2021 is a year that you all love!"
