Bravo mix engineer, you’ve got some serious restraint. The surround implementation is great in this album, not for what it does, as much for what it doesn’t do. […]\n\nAll About Jazz\n\nAnother solid effort from a singer with a bright future; if pop music ever turns toward beauty and grace again, Diana Krall will no doubt be right in the thick of things. Heck, she may have a hand in starting it turning. […]"
