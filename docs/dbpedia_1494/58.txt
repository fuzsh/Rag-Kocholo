(Carroll Gibbons - James Dyrenforth)

Twas just a garden in the rain

Close to a little leafy lane

A touch of color neath skies of gray.

The raindrops kissed the flower beds

The blossoms raised their thirsty heads

A perfumed thank you they seemed to say.

Surely here was charm

Beyond compare to view

Maybe it was just that

I was there with you.

Twas just a garden in the rain

But then the sun came out again

And sent us happilly on our way.

(Surely here was charm

Beyond compare to view

Maybe it was just that

I was there with you.)

Twas just a garden in the rain

But then that sun came out again

And sent us happilly on our way...
