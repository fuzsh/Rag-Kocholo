Britney Spears is busy gearing up for the highly anticipated ‘Circus’ related tour this spring but her former manager Johnny Wright says the ‘pop princess’ is not ready. “She’s being pushed back into be a money machine,” says Wright who was replaced by Spears’ father. Telling OK Magazine that his wish for Britney is to settle down and find real happiness due to frayed relationships, Wright says “I want her to be happy in her heart, then go back to the business because she wants to, not because people are convincing her she has to, or that it would be good therapy for her. It’s too soon for her to be a part of a manufactured machine that is pushing her to have to be a success.” According to Wright, Britney Spears is being pumped up for a massive ‘Madonna-like’ comeback that she’s simply not prepared for. Wright also believes the recent parting of ways with longtime tour collaborators Wade Robinson and Andre are telling signs that things are going wrong behind the scenes. “They helped create the best tours we ever had with Britney. Wade is a really good influence and understands her. When I heard he was no longer involved, I knew there was a problem, and it is probably just the beginning of more problems to come.” Wright, who has worked with Danity Kane, Ciara, the Backstreet Boys, Nsync and Justin Timberlake, says at the end of the day he wishes Britney the best but hopes she will take time to spend with her children. “Her career can wait. Now it should be about spending time with her kids. That’s where she’ll bring herself back to herself. But she’s gearing up for much more time away from them while on the road.”
