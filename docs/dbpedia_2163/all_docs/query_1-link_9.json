        "text": "We over here at TGH would like to introduce the Discussion portion of our blog. Every week we will be posting a topic to get our readers insight. The first topic up for discussion is Ciara and the current state of her career?\n\nClick below for the full report & to share your opinion..\n\nJust over seven years ago a super infectious song entitled, Goodies, took over summer radio & dominated Billboard Hot 100 chart for 7 long weeks.\n\nThe singer of said song, Ciara, was an 18 year old Atlanta, GA native fresh outta high school. She stormed the industry with her impressive dance moves and live performances. She was crowned the princess of “Crunk & B” as she made her debut amidst the ‘Crunk’ sound blazing from fellow Atlanta artist such as Lil John, the Ying Yangs Twins, and Usher.\n\nCiara wasn’t a one hit wonder, though. As a matter of a fact, she followed her #1 single, Goodies, with two other hit singles, “1, 2 Step” featuring Missy Elliot, and “Oh” featuring Ludacris.\n\nBoth songs were able to peak at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Her debut album, Goodies, was released just 3 months after the single of the same name was released and debut at #3 on the Billboard 200 charts selling 125,000 copies. Things were looking up for Ciara, especially on the urban side of the industry. Things only got better for the singer in 2005 with great performances, award accolades, and two huge collaborations.\n\nCiara’s dancing and performances garnered her comparisons to her Idol, Janet Jackson. She became well known for her ass shaking, hip rolling, and her infamous matrix. Her “1, 2 Step” collaboration garnered her a BET, Teen Choice, and Soul Train award. Her “Lose Control” collaboration with Missy garnered her another Soul Train award along with 2 VMA’s and a Grammy. Ironically, both her “Lose Control” collaboration with Missy & “Like You” collaboration with then boyfriend, Bow Wow, peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The only single Ciara released at that time that failed to make any noise on the charts was her fourth single, And I, which was overshadowed by the success of her collaborative efforts. Goodies was a hit for Ciara, the album sold over 3.5 million copies WW, and was certified 3x platinum in the U.S. with sales just over 2.7 million.\n\nAfter a few months of touring, and some time in the studio, Ciara was back on the scene with her hit single, “Get Up”, from the Step Up soundtrack.\n\nThe song proved to be another hit for Ciara peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Ciara then released, “Promise”, which would serve as the first official single for her sophomore album, Ciara: The Evolution.\n\nThe sexy mid-tempo single peaked at #11 on the BBH100 chart and #1 on the R&B charts. The sexy video showed a more mature and grown up Ciara than we had ever seen. Ciara then released her sophmore album, Ciara: The Evolution, which also proved to be a success debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart with 340,000 copies sold. She also embarked on, The Evolution Tour, which was a 17 city promo tour for the album. Ciara later released “Like A Boy” which peaked at #19 on the BBH100 chart, and then “Can’t Leave ’em Alone” which peaked at #40 on the BBH100 chart. Ciara: The Evolution went on to sell 1.3 million copies in the U.S. & 1.8 copies worldwide. Ciara went on to co-headline the U.S. Screamfest ’07 tour along with rapper, T.I. and opened for Rihanna on the European leg of her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour.\n\nAfter one undeniably successful album, and another solid album under her belt, Ciara seemed like a strong competitor in the industry. Sadly for Ciara, she wasnt’t been able to match the success of either of these albums with her next two efforts. As Ciara moved onto her 3rd album, Fantasy Ride, Ciara’s singles struggled to make any impact and her album sales were deplorable.\n\nIn September of 2008 Ciara started the era with her 1st single, “Go Girl” featuring rapper T-Pain, but never bothered to push the single. Even after releasing a dope Melina directed visual, Ciara and her term pushed the single aside. The single peaked at #78 on the BBH100 charts. Ciara & her people decided to release the mid-tempo song, “Never Ever”, as the first “official” single from the album.\n\nThe song failed to make any impact on the BBH100 charts only peaking at #66, and barely made it into the top 10 of the R&B charts peaking at #9, even after the video was released and the single was given a bit of promotion. Ciara and her people pushed back the album, again, so Ciara could go back into the studio and come back with some hot new music!\n\nA few months later, Ciara released the Justin Timberlake assisted single, “Love Sex Magic”. Although the song was hot, there was nothing new about it. The song was a left-over cut from Justin’s highly successful, FutureSex/LoveSounds, album.\n\nNonetheless, the song did just what Ciara & her people needed it to do. It was a hit, it managed to peak at #10 on the BBH100. The song also was Ciara’s biggest hit overseas since her 3rd single, “Oh”. Because of this, Ciara and her people decided to finally move forward with an album release. The album was filled with songs that had leaked months, some even years, in advance. Ciara claimed she pushed the album back to record new material, yet, there was none. Fantasy Ride made it’s debut on the billboard 200 chart at #3 selling 81,000 copies in it’s first week. Unfortunately for Ciara the next two singles from the album, “Work” & “Like A Surgeon” failed to help album sales or even chart. The album went on to sell 193,000 copies in the U.S. & 240,000 copies worldwide. Even with promotional appearances on SNL, Ellen, Good Morning America, Kimmel, Leno, Regis & Kelly, Fashion Rocks, MTV VMA Japan, Radio shows, Opening for Jay-Z’s 6 date promo tour, and opening for Britney Spears in the UK, the album still failed to sell.\n\nIt was apparent that Ciara’s focus seemed to be more on her image, than her music. Ciara’s style took a drastic change. She went from a sexy tomboy to a high fashion wannabe. She noticeably ditched her Urban sound for a mix of Pop and R&B. I’m guessing her & her people figured the whole new image and sound thing worked for Rihanna, so why wouldn’t it work for Ciara? Well, they were wrong. It didn’t work. Ciara’s new edgy style & Rihanna comparisons only grew when Ciara took things further with the shoot below.\n\nThe short black wig and hazel contacts screamed, Rihanna! After Fantasy Ride flopped, Ciara went back into the lab working on her fourth official studio release, Basic Instinct. Ciara promised her fans & critics that she’d go back to her urban roots, hence the title, Basic Instinct.\n\nAround March of 2010, Ciara’s first official single, “Ride”, featuring rapper Ludacris, made it’s way online. The sexy mid-tempo song seemed to have some potential. The sexy single was accompanied by a sexy video! A video that was too sexy for BET and was banned from being aired on 106 & Park. Ciara took the ban entirely too hard and started making a spectacle over “Ride” not being able to be played on 106 & Park. Why? Who knows. I mean, BET doesn’t control the Billboard charts. The single, “Ride”, started moving up both the iTunes & Billboard charts thanks to Ciara’s fans, but, without any promotion there was only so much the fans could do. Ciara passed up numerous opportunities such as the 2010 BET Awards, where she presented but didnt perform, and BET’s Black Girl Rock special where she once again presented, but didn’t perform. Due to lack of promotion, the song peaked at #42 on the BBH100 chart. Around March/April when “Ride” was released, two other songs from Basic Instinct, “Speechless” & “Gimmie Dat”, leaked online.\n\nSix months after it’s initial leaks online, Ciara & her team decided to release “Speechless” as the albums official 2nd single. The single failed to chart anywhere expect on the Billboard R&B charts where it peaked at #74. She later released “Gimmie Dat” as the 3rd official single from the album. That single also failed to chart anywhere except for Billboard R&B chart where it peaked at #63. Nine months after the release of the first single, “Ride”, Ciara finally released the album, Basic Instinct. With only one week of promotion, Basic Instinct debuted at an embarrassing #44 on the Billboard 200 and only sold 37,000 copies. Rumors began to swirl that Ciara’s label, Jive Records, was planning on dropping her from their roster. Ciara then released the statement below on her facebook.\n\nTo my fans:\n\nThis week the net has been a buzz of the rumor that I have been dropped from my label. At this point that rumor is false.. It is true that I have asked and I pray that my label will release me. I have had some great times and success with my label, but sometimes like all great things, its at that point where I feel we don’t share the same views on who I am as a artist. The past two albums have been very frustrating for me. At times there were songs I chose to lead a project and I was ignored!\n\nThis project, I even tried to get Gimmie Dat started I spent tens of thousands of my own money only to hear the radio pds tell me my label didn’t want the song played. I even spent more than one hundred thousand dollars out of my pocket on the video to bring my vision to it and still no label support. I do understand that some labels are not financially supporting their artists and I have become one of them. You, my fans, know that I strive to do my best to deliver to my you the best songs and creative vision I possibly can.\n\nI’m dedicated to my music, performance and to my fans! I’ve tried to be a team player with the label only to have compromised what I truly believed.. And was not given the right opportunity to promote and inform my fans of the release of this album..I have so much of me as a artist I still want to give to the world and my fans. A release would allow me to go be creative with people who care and understand me as a artist. In a short time, I will be able to bring to you a new music energy and a visual excitement! Thank you so much for standing by me through the good, bad, and the confusion. I love you all.\n\nLove Ciara\n\nCiara has now been released from Jive and is reportedly in talks of joining L.A. Reid in his move to the Epic Label Group fold. Although nothing is confirmed, this move could prove to be beneficial for Ciara.\n\nHere is where I raise a few questions for you, the readers, to answer. Please, don’t answer these questions with malicious or shady intent, also, please put you inner stan aside for just a moment.\n\nWhat exactly do you think Ciara needs to do, musically, once she is signed to a new label. Should continue making urban singles, should try to do pop music, or should try & mix them?\n\nPeople have always questioned Ciara’s talents, mainly her singing, and now people are even starting to question her dance skills. Not to say people think she cant dance, which she obviously can, but to what extent? Since Ciara has been in the industry she’s mainly showcased one style of dance. She rarely switches things up & shows us all of what she can do. Are Ciara’s dancing abilities limited, or is she just choosing to do the same basic things over & over again? (Que matrix)\n\nWhat is your opinion on Ciara, vocally? Clips of some of her best vocals are below…\n\nWith 7 million albums, just over 20 million records WW, a Grammy, both a #1 single & #1 album, and accolades as one of the best performers/dancers of her time, has Ciara done enough to not be forgotten or easily replaced by a younger version herself?\n\nMy final question is, who do you think is to be blamed for Ciara current position in the industry? Is it her team/label or do you think Ciara lost herself while trying to become a superstar?\n\nDiscuss.."
