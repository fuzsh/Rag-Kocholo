        "text": "Zendaya and Jacob allegedly started dating in 2019 after they wrapped the first season of Euphoria — though they never confirmed that they dated. The two were spotted hanging out together a lot, including photos of them kissing in NYC. However, reportedly, after COVID started, the relationship fizzled out as Zendaya was quarantining in LA, while Jacob was quarantining in his native Australia.\n\nThere was a good reason Rashida and John had great onscreen chemistry on The Office, and that's because the two had actually dated for about a year (2005–06) before Rashida joined the show — but, FTR, the two had already broken up when she came on.\n\nThe two briefly dated during the filming of their 2012 movie Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. And while promoting the film in Australia, the two were awkwardly put on the spot during a TV interview when they got asked about their relationship, to which Josh replied, \"We’re not. We were at one point, but she broke my heart... No, I’m just kidding. That was a while ago. We’re really good friends now.\"\n\nThe two began dating in 1999, after reportedly being introduced to each other by their chiropractor. The two broke up in 2003, but the world found out after Daryl Sabara accidentally revealed it in an interview on Today — while promoting Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (a movie Salma also costarred in) — where he said, \"She isn’t with Ed Norton anymore.\"\n\nKeira and Jamie dated from 2003 to 2005, when he was still a model and her career was taking off. A few years after their breakup, Jamie told the Mail on Sunday that he felt \"a bit second-rate\" compared to her, and that put pressure on their relationship.\n\nThe two dated from 2004 to 2006. In a 2016 interview with The Love Bomb with Nico Tortorella podcast, Hilary opened up about the relationship, saying it \"was so intense. It was my life,\" and that \"it was pretty major.\" The two are friends, though, and even went on a group date together recently.\n\nThe pair started dating in early 2012 and broke it off in July of 2013. However, this does actually seem to be one of those breakups that actually was amicable as the two were spotted hanging out together at a Knicks game in November of 2013.\n\nJohn and Katy dated on-again, off-again from 2012 until 2015. After the breakup, the two have only spoken kindly of each other — with John telling Andy Cohen on his Sirius XM radio show last year that there was no jealousy in the relationship and that he liked being the \"first gentleman of Katy Perry.\"\n\nThe two met on the set of their 2011 film, Midnight in Paris, and were together until 2013. Reportedly, the two split because Rachel wanted to settle down and start a family, while Michael — who had already been married and had a child — wanted to focus more on his career.\n\nBen and Gwyneth are both no strangers to high-profile romances, so it's easy to forget that they dated from 1997–2000. They also starred in two movies together during that time: Shakespeare in Love and Bounce.\n\nIn May of this year, Gwyneth appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast, where host Alex Cooper asked who was better in bed: Brad Pitt or Ben, to which she replied that was a tough question...but that \"Ben was, like, technically excellent!\"\n\nReportedly, the two where set up by Will Smith, who invited Sofía to a pre-Oscars party and introduced her to Tom in Feb. 2005. Tom then allegedly kept calling her and sending flowers and chocolates. However, they were only photographed on one date that same month.\n\nThe two dated briefly in 2003 after meeting on the set of their rom-com, Just Married. In 2009, following Brittany's death, Ashton took to Twitter to express his sadness, tweeting, \"2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany's family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon. See you on the other side, kid.\"\n\nThis was a bit of a scandal at the time, as Meg was married to Dennis Quaid when she met Russell on the set of their 2000 movie Proof of Life. It was announced that Meg and Dennis were separating during filming, and people quickly assumed that it's because she had started an affair with Russell.\n\nMeg was labeled as an adulteress — which hurt her Hollywood image — and her and Russell's relationship ended about six months later. To add insult to injury, the bad publicity is sited as being a big reason as to why the movie bombed at the box office. However, in the years since, Meg has been clear to correct the narrative and say that her and Dennis's marriage had been over long before she met Russell and that he had nothing to do with their divorce.\n\nTheir exact dating history is not completely clear. But in an interview, Zooey said that she and Jason started dating in 1999, when they were both 19, and that he was her first \"real boyfriend.\" The two then broke it off at some point and then rekindled their romance, dating from 2003 to 2005.\n\nJennifer and Vince met in 2005 on the set of their film, The Break-Up. The two dated for about a year before breaking up in real life in 2006. But the romance was significant because it was her first relationship after splitting with Brad Pitt. In a 2008 interview with Vogue, Jennifer had this to say about him and their relationship: \"I call Vince my defibrillator. He literally brought me back to life... He was lovely and fun and perfect for the time we had together. And I needed that. And it sort of ran its course.\""
