        "text": "Source: â€˜Ciara has lost her mind!â€™\n\nPhoto by Derek Blanks/DBlanks.com\n\nIn a cover interview with Billboard magazine this month, Ciara revealed her break up with longtime manager Phillana Williams. I reached out to several of my sources for the details on what happened between the two longtime friends. What I learned surprised me because, apparently, Ciara is not the person we thought she was.\n\nItâ€™s beginning to look like Ciaraâ€™s sweet public persona was a carefully cultivated front for something darker.\n\nWhen I first heard these allegations about Ciara, I thought long and hard about putting them out there. Ciara is a friend of this site and she was one of the few celebs whose reputation seemed infallible. But on the other hand, I canâ€™t show favoritism while dishing dirt on every other celebrity, can I?\n\nAccording to one of my sources, Ciara fired Williams mainly because she failed to create the â€œsupermodelâ€ image that Ciara so desperately wanted. My source said Ciara is â€œobsessedâ€ with the successes of both Beyonce and Rihanna, and get this, Ciara believes sheâ€™s bigger than both of them.\n\nFriends say Ciara has gone â€œbeyond Hollywoodâ€ and that her unrealistic desire to be a superstar on the level of Beyonce, is beginning to distance her from her closest friends. â€œAll of Ciaraâ€™s people were brought in by Phillana,â€ said the source, who added, â€œCiaraâ€™s people LOVED Phillana. They are heartbroken that sheâ€™s goneâ€\n\nThe source, who belongs to Ciaraâ€™s close circle of friends, puts the blame for Ciaraâ€™s change in attitude squarely on the shoulders of her boyfriend, rapper 50 Cent. â€œShe really believes sheâ€™s doing something by dating him,â€ said the source. â€œShe sees the both of them as a superstar couple on the level of Jay Z and Beyonce or Chris Brown and Rihanna. They canâ€™t even leave the house because [heâ€™s afraid] people are out to kill him,â€ said the source. â€œWho would want to date a man who has to wear a bulletproof vest everywhere he goes? Ciara has lost her mind!â€\n\nThe source described the atmosphere surrounding Ciara as â€œtenseâ€ and her entourage as â€œwalking on egg shells around her.â€ As an example of Ciaraâ€™s fragile ego, the source described an incident during Riihannaâ€™s Good Girl Gone Bad tour late last year.\n\nCiara, who didnâ€™t have a stylist with her on tour, called her management from the road angrily demanding that a stylist be hired for her and a whole new wardrobe sent to her hotel. Ciara was livid at all the attention Rihanna was receiving from the blogs and Ci thought Rihannaâ€™s style was the reason.\n\nâ€œShe obsessed with [the blogs],â€ said the source. â€œShe stays on the blogs 24/7. [Ciara says] â€˜why am I not on here? Why arenâ€™t they talking about me?â€™â€, said the source. According to the source, other celebrities donâ€™t know what to make of Ciaraâ€™s dark side. â€œBig time celebrities donâ€™t want to work with her because sheâ€™s a beast. Theyâ€™re wondering whatâ€™s wrong with her,â€ said the source.\n\nCiara is set to release her third album,â€œFantasy Rideâ€ in November. But, according to my source, Ciaraâ€™s last album, 2006â€™s Ciara: The Evolution, flopped because she tried to take her image in a completely different direction. â€œHer fans knew Ciara for her dancing, her baggy jeans and her Timbs, but she wanted to be Beyonce,â€ said the source. â€œCiara picked the songs [for Evolution]. She sat down with Phillana and Phillana asked, â€™so, what are your goals for this album?â€™ and Ciara said, â€˜I want to be a supermodelâ€™â€.\n\nWilliams helped CiCi secure a contract with the Wilhelmina Model agency, but Ciara still wasnâ€™t satisfied. A recent effort to increase paparazzi interest in her by staging candid photos of Ci at a recording studio, failed. â€œWhat celebrity leaves the studio and goes outside to a Coke machine?,â€ said the source.\n\n:\n\nhttp://sandrarose.com/2008/08/15/source-ciara-has-lost-her-mind/\n\nmikejmc5580 said:\n\nSteve said:\n\n. However, if she is mad and determined, that can only make her more interesting - the one thing Rihanna lacks is a discernible personality.\n\nYou mean if we take vocal prowess, songwriting talent and the ability to dance without appearing operated by a remote control in a separate building out of the equation?\n\nI think Rihanna is a solid popstar in terms of distinctive vocal (if not technically amazing) and stage presence (I saw a recent MTV airing of one of her Canadian concerts, and whilst not a show of epic pop proportions, as you'd expect from the likes of Madonna or Britney, it was fairly solid show). Isnt her style of choreography meant to be a bit robotic? I agree on the songwriting front, although I'm sure she does have one or two credits in her catalogue.\n\nCiara going to Johnny Wright is an amazing step for her; he is often not credited, but he was a key player in steering Britney to worldwide success, with the contacts and history that Larry Rudolph just wasn't able to provide at the time. I'm excited for her new album, I think \"The Evolution\" is one of the best R&B records of the past 5 years; something Janet would have killed to get hold of."
