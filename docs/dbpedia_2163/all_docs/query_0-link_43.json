        "meta_description": "BeyoncѐManager: Matthew KnowlesBreak-up Year: 2011 - After 20 years, B. shocked her fans by announcing a professional split with her father, Matthew Knowles, who had managed her career since the earliest Destiny's Child days.  Verdict: It's too soon to tell what impact the split will have on B's career, check back after her upcoming album, 4, hits stores.(Photo: Dave Hogan/Getty Images) - Artists and managers have always relied on each other for mutual success. But as with any relationship, managing an entertainment career is a delicate balance of give and take. As Diddy reportedly found out this week with news that Nicki Minaj was dumping him as her manager, terminated management contracts are all too common once a star (or a star's spouse) starts to glimpse greener grass elsewhere. We took a look back at some of the most high profile artist/manager break-ups in recent memory and asked whether the splits made dollars and/or sense.",
