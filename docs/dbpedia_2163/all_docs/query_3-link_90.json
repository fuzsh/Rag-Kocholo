        "text": "LOS ANGELES, July 22 — Barry Weiss, the president of the Zomba Label Group, had been chatting with a guest at his label’s recent party at the Ritual club here when he abruptly cut off conversation and strode toward the dance floor.\n\n“That’s Right,” a song by one of the label’s artists, Ciara, had just begun to play at ear-splitting volume, and Mr. Weiss decided to conduct some impromptu market research.\n\nReaching for his glasses, he watched the partygoers dance as he stood off to one side of the darkened dance floor. “You can still get a feel” for how people will respond in clubs like this, Mr. Weiss said.\n\nAfter more than 25 years in the music business, he has come to trust his instincts more than ever. It fell to Mr. Weiss to guide Zomba after the company’s creative mastermind, Clive Calder, sold it to Bertelsmann five years ago for $2.7 billion, cashing out just as the label’s slate of teen pop stars like ’N Sync waned.\n\nNow, amid financial setbacks in the music industry, Zomba is on a hot streak again, with hits from performers like Justin Timberlake, R. Kelly and T-Pain, a rapper-turned-singer whose new CD surpassed Paul McCartney’s last month to enter the Billboard chart at No. 1.\n\nIt is quite a turnabout for Mr. Weiss, who was one of a handful of longtime Zomba executives to stay on at the company after 2002, even as critics crowed that the label would never again match its earlier success.\n\n“We knew what people were thinking,” he said in a rare interview recently. “We weren’t like, ‘Oh, my God! What’s going to happen here?’ We were too busy trying to stay afloat and stick to our knitting.”\n\nSince the sale, Zomba, which includes Jive Records and the gospel label Verity, has managed to defy the industry’s troubles by discovering new artists, like the R&B singer Chris Brown and the rockers Three Days Grace, while keeping costs down — a tough task in a field given to financial excess.\n\nJohnny Wright, a talent manager overseeing acts including Mr. Timberlake and the Backstreet Boys, remarked, “They overanalyze every penny that’s spent to make sure it’s not just frivolous money being thrown away.”\n\nHe added: “As a manager of an artist, you want a $2 million video budget. Do you really need one? At the time that you’re involved in it, you’re feeling a little frustrated,” but “at the end of the day you’ve made a decent video, and you have an artist that’s actually getting a royalty check.”\n\nThere is little argument that the label’s sales and market share have slid sharply from their pinnacle during the teen pop sales surge; the industry itself has buckled under the weight of widespread piracy and other woes.\n\nBut if any of the corporate-owned labels can be described as succeeding these days, Mr. Weiss’s is one of the few. Zomba has increased its share of new-release sales almost 20 percent so far this year, even as sales of new albums industrywide have dropped 16.5 percent, according to Nielsen SoundScan data. It has remained consistently profitable, having generated more than $40 million in profit last year on well over $200 million in revenue, according to executives briefed on the label’s business.\n\nBeing part of a sprawling media empire has had certain advantages; a Bertelsmann reorganization three years ago shifted established stars like Usher and then-unknown artists like Ciara to Zomba’s roster. But side businesses, including a studio-equipment rental service, that once bolstered Zomba’s success have been sold.\n\nWhat remains at the center is Mr. Weiss, 48, who exudes a feverish energy even when sitting. Since his appointment in 2002, he has taken pains to preserve the internal culture of the label; that has meant, in part, a preference for developing artists in-house rather than through ventures with outside talent finders.\n\nZomba has kept its home in a bare-bones office building in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, apart from the big suites of higher-volume labels in Midtown. It may face new challenges when it relocates to the Madison Avenue headquarters of its corporate parent these days, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a move expected later this year.\n\n“There’s very little ego,” said Max Martin, a Swedish producer behind hits for Ms. Spears and others. “When you meet a lot of other presidents,” he said, declining to specify anyone, “you see lots of big offices, you see a lot of ‘I’m the president of the record company.’ That’s the one thing I that I love about Barry and Jive in general, there’s very little of that thing. It’s a very tight group of people.”\n\nThe chairman of a competing record label, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Zomba’s reputation for frugality was sometimes overstated. Zomba may pour cash into important production and marketing expenses, though “they’re not going to send you a limousine just because you’re going to get an ASCAP award,” this executive said, referring to the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers, the industry professional group.\n\nMr. Weiss makes no apologies, and suggests that some rival labels have chosen to whack away at their overhead costs — resulting in hundreds of layoffs — rather than take on the potentially more difficult pruning of day-to-day production and marketing expenses.\n\n“On the one hand,” he said, “they’re laying off all these people from these companies to the point where you’re cutting into the bone. But nobody’s focusing on the fact that that album that should’ve cost $800,000 cost $2 million. Or the video that the egotistical president of the company decided to scrap, for $400,000, because they didn’t like the color of the pants that the artist was wearing. Those things still kind of go on in the business.”\n\nMr. Weiss’s education in music had begun decades before — at the side of his father, Hy, a music entrepreneur who in the 1950’s built his own label, Old Town Records, which specialized in doo-wop, R&B and pop, recording hits by acts like the Solitaires.\n\nIn addition to working with his father, Mr. Weiss promoted songs to radio stations in upstate New York while attending Cornell. In 1982, Mr. Calder, a South African expatriate, hired him as one of the upstart label’s first employees in the United States, where he struck upon early success pushing acts including A Flock of Seagulls and Billy Ocean.\n\nMr. Weiss stoked Mr. Calder’s early interest in rap music at a time when major music labels largely dismissed the genre, and oversaw the signing of the rap act Whodini, one of a series of hit makers that also included KRS-One and Too Short.\n\nBy the time Mr. Weiss worked his way up to become Mr. Calder’s right-hand man, Zomba had expanded to become the biggest independent record label in the world, turning Ms. Spears, a former Mouseketeer, and The Backstreet Boys into superstars.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. Calder cashed in, exercising a contract option that required Bertelsmann to buy out his share of Zomba at a premium based on the success of the teen pop acts and other big discoveries. Then he all but vanished from the music landscape.\n\nSo, too, has the old way of doing business. In the jubilant days of 2000, ’N Sync shattered a record by selling 2.4 million copies of its “No Strings Attached” album in a single week — more than the combined sum of the top 50 titles on the current edition of Billboard’s weekly sales chart.\n\nNow, labels are scrambling to offset plunging CD sales by cobbling profits from bite-size products like ring tones and digital downloads. Indeed, more than 40 percent of Zomba’s revenue from new releases through the first half of this year came from digital sales.\n\nMr. Weiss said that has made it all the more important for labels to sign artists with commercial potential; Jive has had a particular ear for street-savvy R&B that can attract mainstream pop fans.\n\n“The margin for error has been greatly reduced,” he said, “and the winners don’t pay for the losers the way they used to.”\n\nWith the right songs, he added, the label can generate a profit even without a gold album. When the rap newcomer Huey released his first album last month, for example, it sold fewer than 29,000 copies the first week. But Huey’s hit single, “Pop, Lock & Drop It,” had already turned into a radio hit, fueling sales of more than two million downloads and ring tones, the latter typically costing as much as $2.50 each. By keeping costs low, the label was already in the black when the album reached shops, Zomba executives said.\n\nMr. Weiss’s talents as a manager were on display one recent night at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, where a group of Jive executives and he had gathered to watch a set by T-Pain. Stars from competing labels, Akon and Busta Rhymes, unexpectedly clambered onstage to join T-Pain, sending the already giddy crowd into bliss.\n\nUpstairs, Mr. Weiss danced with colleagues and made no attempt to conceal his delight at the scene of screaming fans. “And the good news?” he said. “It didn’t cost us anything.”"
