A few words that describe the “actors-as-artists” that graduate from our program.\n\nWe specialize in the integration of multi-techniques, celebrating the uniqueness of YOU and cultivating your ability to access all aspects of humanity in service of the craft of transformative acting for theatre, film, and television, and the ever-expanding offerings of multi-media performance platforms.\n\nThe BFA Acting program guides students through a curated curriculum of multiple acting techniques, dynamic approaches to movement and embodied vocal training folded into the four-year training experience.\n\nStanislavski\n\nPractical Aesthetics\n\nShakespeare\n\nActing for Camera/ Film\n\nTV & New Media\n\nMvM Miller Voice & Dialects\n\nYoga/ Pilates\n\nGrotowski\n\nViewpoints & Suzuki Training\n\nClown\n\nSample Curriculumn\n\nMontclair State University is just 14 miles from New York City.

Dedicated to a holistic approach to the craft of acting, the program will give you experience all in areas of the theatre as part of your training including Text Analysis, Theatre History I and II, Directing, Introduction to Technical Theatre and Practicums in Stage Craft, Costumes and Production Operations.\n\nAn ever-expanding menu of electives are available including: Acting for the Camera I & II, Singing for the Actor, Playwriting I & II, Directing I & II, The Business of the Business, Audition Prep, Stage Combat, Stage Dialects, Devised Theatre Projects etc…\n\nActing\n\nYear One: Students learn how to work intimately and collaboratively with an ensemble, actor-to-actor and moment-to-moment with bravery, vulnerability and an honest use of self through technique that progresses into contemporary scene work with an emphasis on diverse playwrights.\n\nYear Two: Fall semester is devoted to Stanislavski technique through intense scene study with characters from diverse contemporary playwrights. Spring semester focuses on Practical Aesthetics and advanced scene work with complex characters from diverse contemporary Greek and contemporary-modern playwrights.\n\nYear three: Centers on the specific challenges and demands of plays by William Shakespeare, including heightened language and given circumstances.\n\nYear Four: The senior year of training in our program transitions students from an academic setting to the profession and culminates in a Senior Capstone Project fall semester and a Senior Showcase in New York City in the spring semester.\n\nMovement\n\nThe Movement for Actor sequence is offered for six consecutive semesters and includes ensemble based Viewpoints Training, Yoga and Pilates to diagnose and release habitual tensions in the body through rigorous classes for flexibility, core strength, and presence, Andrei Droznin Movement for advanced work on flexibility, strength with partner stretches, weight sharing and acrobatics, a year of Mask and Clown work, and an entire year devoted to Suzuki Training.
