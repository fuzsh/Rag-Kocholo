        "text": "Remember I told you that Ciara’s album wasn’t coming out this year? Well, after pushing the album back to December, Ciara’s label has now pushed the album back to the dark ages.\n\nA Zomba label rep tells Entertainment Weekly, “The response to ‘Go Girl’ wasn’t strong enough to ignite an album. Right now, we are anticipating it for spring 2009, but we’re not gonna put another date on it.”\n\nThe bottom line is “Fantasy Ride” might not ever come out.\n\nRemember that ongoing lawsuit I told you about involving producer Jazze Pha who discovered Ciara and helped get her a record deal with LaFace Records?\n\nWell, it turns out Jazze Pha isn’t the plaintiff in that lawsuit after all. The plaintiff is one Anthony “TA” Tate or Anthony “Ray L” Tate, Jazze Pha’s former business partner.\n\nI’m told if you mention Tate’s name around Jazze Pha he will go ballistic. Something about Tate stealing Ciara from Jazze and taking her to Sony BMG. Tate currently has a distribution deal with Capital Records which also distributes Sho’nuff Records, the label that Ciara was signed to.\n\nIt’s all very confusing. But click here to see the ongoing court case.\n\nThe lawsuit names the plaintiff as Futuristic Music 101 LLC, which according to the state of Georgia website, is owned by Tate. Supposedly Tate is going around Atlanta telling people Ciara has to fork over $20,000 a month to him for the rest of her career.\n\nAccording to Tate’s Myspace page, he is currently managing singers J. Holiday and Teairra Mari under his Music Line/Mazz Records imprint. He still lists Ciara as being under his management as well.\n\nCiara is currently co-managed by Kenneth Crear, President of BEST Entertainment, and Johnny Wright, who also manages Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, the Jonas Brothers and Janet Jackson."
