        "text": "Great classrooms begin with great teachers. In the younger grades, each class is taught by a head teacher and assistant teacher. Resource teachers and specialists are available starting in the 4-5s. In the older grades, students and faculty are bound together in intellectual exploration and the dynamic exchange of ideas, knowledge and values. Seventh and eighth grade teachers work as a collaborative team.\n\nAcross the school, faculty and staff place a high level of emphasis on the dynamic relationship between family and school. Talented and dedicated teachers take the time over the years to get to know every student well. The non-teaching staff in various departments support families and faculty throughout the year.\n\nPublished writers, activists, athletes, musicians, artists, actors, farmers, and lifelong learners make up the members of our esteemed faculty and staff.\n\nMCS faculty and staff are affiliated with various organizations outside of MCS that are aligned with our mission and values. Faculty and staff serve as Board members or are on committees to desegregate public schools as well as the Black Lives Matter at School Steering Committee, the Progressive Education Network of New York (PENNY), Brotherhood/SistaSol, and more."
