        "text": "Results\n\nAs shown in , the people included in the sample were predominately Black female, and lived alone with incomes <$30,000. Most participants (>50%) had experienced at least one financial shock in the past year and reported some financial strain, although only 36% reported food insecurity. Participants reported several types of commonly encountered financial challenges including persistent difficulties making ends meet, loss of income due to disability, large unexpected expenses, and debt. Importantly, although participants were not asked about their early life, many commented that earlier experiences with adversity increased their knowledge, skills or confidence and sometimes shaped their identity, such as one participant who described himself as a survivor because he recovered from a devastating motorcycle accident as a teenager.\n\nTable 2\n\nVariableSample characteristicsAge (%)< 75 years4 (36%)75 + years7 (63%)Gender (%)Female9 (82)Male2 (18)Race (%)Black9 (82)White2 (18)Income (%)<$15,0004 (36%)$15,000–$29,9994 (36%)$>30,0003 (27%)Number in household (%)18 (73)23 (27)Median number of chronic diseases (Range)4 (2, 5)Food insecure (%)No7 (64)Yes4 (36)Median number of recent financial shocks (Range)1 (0, 4)Median financial strain score (Range)2 (1, 4)\n\nConsistent with the phenomena of weathering, participants reported that financial challenges worsened physical and mental health outcomes, including depressive symptoms, headaches, high blood pressure, sleep disturbance and well-being, making them feel ‘inadequate’, ‘worthless’ or ‘scared’. Notably, participants consistently used negative terms to describe their financially challenging experiences, including ‘frustrating’, ‘depressing’, ‘frightening’, ‘overwhelming’ and ‘terrifying’. However, participants also consistently describe strategies they employed to handle financial challenges. These findings provided context for the overarching theme of “I guess it balances”. This theme was exemplified within four domains of daily life relevant to financial challenges, including cognitive bandwidth, emotional experience, learned resilience, and meeting daily needs (see ). Within each domain, a pair of sub-themes capture the ‘balancing’ act required to weather financial challenges while also being weathered by them.\n\nTable 3\n\nParticipant characteristicsExemplar quotesOverarching theme of balancing: “I guess it balances”Multiple recent financial challenges; income <$10,000“I realize my limitations. And before, I guess I thought I was invincible or −I don’t know what I thought I was. But I know now that I am limited in a lot of things but I also know that there are still a lot of things that I’m able to do. So I guess it balances, and I hope that keeps balancing all the time.”Financial strain, living with husband on <$30,000“all I can say is it’s rough. It’s really rough, but you just have to learn to live with you’ve got. You learn to live with it. You really can if you don’t mess up…. We just make it work. That’s all I can say. I really didn ‘t even realize that it was really that. We did it. You get used to it and it’s just a daily.”Financial strain, food insecurity, income <$15,000“I’m pretty much a spiritual person so I rely on God for all my needs. And believe it or not, I will run out on theday before I get my benefits. And it’s been happening like that just about since I’ve been in this house.”\n\nSub-themes: Being weatheredSub-themes: Weathering financial challenges1. Cognitive Bandwidth“Think a lot”“Idon’t dwell on that”Only $4 in the bank after household repairs“But right now, I have to just concentrate on paying those bills, because it’s heavy.”“I don’t worry. Whatever will be, will be. Because if I worry, it will not – nothing will happen. I talk to God”Forced to retire because of health“Like I said it affects me a lot but you’d be thinking what you should’ve did but you didn’t do.”“But I tell you, you know you take 1 day at a time. That’s all I can do ”2. Emotional Experience“Depressing”“be thankful”Multiple household and medical expenses; income <$10,000“It’s been frustrating. It’s been depressing. At times, it almost felt overwhelming……I’ve been to the point where I’ve had $5.00. But I had $5.00. I had food. I had a roof over my head. I had heat. You know, I had light. So I was very thankful for that.”Living on <$15,000 with severe food insecurity and financial strain“It makes me feel I guess – well I used to feel inadequate when I couldn’t meet my own needs…”“…I think about all the people who are going through more than I could ever go through…I am just thankful just to be able to put one foot in front of the other.”3. Learned Resilience“that was a shock”“there’s always a way”Lost a substantial amount of expected income after retirement“… that was a shock. It really was. That went through me to my niece and I think that’s one of the few times that I had really, really bad depression…”…And then I said okay, this too shall pass. You will pull up your big girl panties and you will figure this out…after I got over the initial anger and the initial pity party, then I was much better. I was able to really focus on what needed to be done.”Needed to pay for costly car repairs and her partner became disabled“Well, for a little while my pressure started going up and my doctor doubled my blood pressure meds ….… You’d be surprised at – I know I was – at how you can get help if you just reach out. I just told them look, I cant’ do this. Well, maybe we can do this, that and the other for you. I’m like okay, thank you.”4. Meeting Daily Needs“we learned to do without”“cut back” / “take a dollar and stretch it”Childhood poverty“When I said we had nothing, we had nothing…. there was nothing extra anywhere. And we learned to do without.”“I have already cut back … Now I’m just maintaining. …I don’t deny myself the basics. I just don’t bother with the extraneous stuff.”Living on <$15,000 with severe food insecurity and financial strain“Well, I dont’ depend on being warm; I just depend on not having the pipes freeze… So I’ve gone without a heat bill, now… That’s the way to bust it, so you dont’ have to be put out of your house.”“Well, what you do is accept that…whatever all the rest of the people are doing, you just, it’ not open to you. …you know it’s your way of life, and – I dont’ even go to church, because I cant’ afford to go to church.”Was a single mother with four children“Well, baby, all I can tell you is every day is a struggle. … I worked my whole life, but there were years when you worked all that time and you really werent’ making anything.”“You learn to take a dollar and stretch it to do the same things as two. When my kids were growing up, oh, god, I shopped a lot in the Goodwills, but they went to school looking as good as anybody.”\n\n“I guess it balances”\n\nThe overarching concept of balancing captures the experience of living with the stress, uncertainty and limitations placed on them by the financial challenges and their attempt to maintain optimism and proactively handle their financial situations. Participant quotes in reflect the uncertainty they expressed about their financial situations (i.e. “I guess”, “I didn’t even realize” and “believe it or not”) and the precariousness of their situation (i.e. “hope that keeps balancing” and “don’t mess up” and running out of money on the day before benefits). Although every participant described a strategy for managing day-to-day finances, many also reflected on the difficulties of managing their finances despite challenges, exemplified by one participant with multiple recent challenges who said “I don’t really know how [we managed] to tell you the truth”.\n\nParticipants were asked about governmental, non-profit and family systems that are commonly believed to provide support, including public benefit programs, family networks and churches. Importantly, participants reported that systems sometimes helped them handle financial challenges, but also noted that systems sometimes worsened their situation. As examples, the city had provided free major home repairs (i.e. a new furnace or repaired roof) for at least two participants but one participant thought the city was responsible for de-valuing homes in her community by disinvestment in the area. Some participants relied on family or churches, but others described situations in which they were the ones providing financial support to their families or churches. Relationships with families, churches and agencies were complex. As examples, many participants expressed fear of losing their independence or making loved ones worry if they asked family members to help. With regard to church, some reported receiving financial assistance from a church but others said they stopped attending church because they couldn’t afford to tithe. Finally, many participants avoided applying for public benefits because of cumbersome enrollment barriers, as one participant stated: “they give you a hard time. …I’d probably just walk out without the help that I need.” Overall, systems were not viewed as universally supportive.\n\nInstead of relying on systems, participants consistently described using self-reliant strategies and coping mechanisms to handle financial challenges, even if challenges were persistent or intense. For example, instead of asking for help, participants described cutting back on basic necessities and strategies such as “take a dollar and stretch it”. This type of disclosure highlighted the mental and emotional weathering that came from the effort of balancing the challenges. One participant who had both food insecurity and financial strain said “I think a lot about how I’m gonna make it”.\n\nDomain 1: Cognitive Bandwidth – balancing ‘think a lot’ with ‘don’t dwell’\n\nRelevant to the domain of cognitive bandwidth, the sub-theme “think a lot” reflects the mental effort needed to juggle competing demands and cover basic needs ( ). Many participants commented on the vigilance required to handle household finances. Participants were asked to describe how they handled routine monthly finances, and each provided detailed routinized strategies used to keep track of Social Security payment dates, bill due dates and bank account balances. Some tracked due dates and amounts in a notebook or spreadsheet, while others relied on automatic Social Security deposit and automatic withdrawal for routine expenses. Many mentioned late charges for bills and emphasized the need to “make sure that it’s done on time ”.\n\nDespite the vigilance and effort required to handle their financial situation, many participants consciously tried to not worry, as reflected in the sub-theme “I don’t dwell on that” ( ). Some participants suggested having a routine and personal system helped them to worry less. For example, one participant stacked up and set aside bills so he wouldn’t think about them again until payment was due.\n\nDomain 2: Emotional experience – balancing ‘depressing’ versus’ ‘be thankful’\n\nThe sub-theme “depressing” captures the stress of living with financial challenges ( ). Many participants reported that one financial challenge often led to another and the severity and persistency of accumulated challenges affected a person’s well-being. Participants described the situation as ‘overwhelming’ and reported poor mental health outcomes. Importantly, some strategies for addressing financial challenges in the short-term actually added to their longer-term financial challenges. For example, several participants reported needing to use credit cards for an urgent financial need and described the effort required afterward to eliminate credit card debt, reflected by the following participant comment: “I said no, I’m not getting myself back in that blanket no more.”\n\nIn the face of large scale and often-repeated financial blows, participants tried to “be thankful” ( ). Many participants said they tried to focus on the resources and abilities they did have rather than focus on their financial needs. Many participants had either experienced more severe financial challenges in the past or had experienced other types of early life adversity and said that these experiences taught them to be thankful. For example, one participant lost a parent at a young age and stated: “My whole life has somewhat been defined by that, in that I know that tomorrow isn’t guaranteed, and we need to be thankful if we have today.”\n\nDomain 3: Learned resilience – balancing ‘scared to death’ versus ‘there’s always a way’\n\nThe sub-theme “that was a shock” captures the uncertainty and fear many participants expressed about their precarious situation during a financial challenge ( ). For example, one participant described feeling “scared to death” when facing an unexpectedly large water bill due to a glitch in the city’s billing. Most participants said that they had to retire because of health declines. The health declines often led to disability and many said that they not only lost income, but also became more financially vulnerable and were less prepared to handle unexpected large expenses. For example, a participant who had recently faced unexpected large medical and home repair expenses said:\n\n“I didn’t worry too much … when I was working. We did have a little savings account. I could work overtime a couple of days and that would take care of that and [my husband] could do something. And – but since we’ve gotten older and not able to work and [we] can’t save anything either.”\n\nThe sub-theme “there’s always a way” captures how participants tried to maintain hope and optimism despite their fear and uncertainty and proactively handle their financial challenges ( ). Some participants described a reliance on God, making comments such as “God always provides” while others described a confidence that they could handle the situation. With regard to getting help, there was not a collective experience; for example, one participant had been pleasantly surprised that she could “get help if you just reach out” whereas another said that paying a large dental bill had “kind of set [him] back” and he “didn’t even think about [asking them to arrange payments]”.\n\nDomain 4: Meeting Daily Needs – balancing ‘we learned to do without’ versus ‘take a dollar and stretch it’\n\nFinally, participants described a balancing act related to daily necessities. Several participants discussed re-prioritizing their needs, which sometimes included re-classifying basic needs as non-necessities ( ). Most participants considered housing, food, medications, water and electricity to be necessities, but many said they no longer bought clothing and some skipped church to avoid paying tithes or social activities to avoid paying bus tickets. In one case, a participant had sacrificed heating to reduce spending. Notably, several participants described scenarios in which they relied on food stored at home rather than buying food at the end of the month, but did not respond as food insecure on the questionnaire, suggesting that they did not consider themselves to have run out of food.\n\nThe sub-theme “cut back” / “take a dollar and stretch it” conceptualizes the way in which almost all participants had strategies for being thrifty ( ). For example, one participant lost a part-time job that had provided her with critical income and described her response by saying: “I realized that okay, you’ve gotta make some different choices. You don’t have it. Okay, yes, you were able to save most of it but it’s gone. You’re gonna have to be very thrifty with it.” Other participants described learning strategies from past financial challenges and how these strategies had become daily habits, not just something they did while facing an unusual financial challenge. Another participant commented that she was used to “being broke” and “making the best out of whatever it is I happen to run across”. Many strategies were specific to food purchases, including buying discounted foods and timing food shopping to avoid first-of-the month high prices after food stamps are distributed. Approaches such as compromising basic necessities and using thrifty habits demonstrated the ways that participants maintained independence amid financial constraints. As one participant succinctly stated:\n\n“It just comes naturally to me at this stage. I’m so – I’ve been doing it all my life. For one thing, that’s allowed me a certain kind of freedom that a lot of other people don’t have because my life is not tied to my possessions.”\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study explored financially challenging experiences among a predominately Black sample of older adults living with low-income and disabilities. These findings contribute to the literature by showing that individuals weather financial challenges using mostly self-reliant strategies, including compromising basic necessities, and high-effort coping strategies, such as thinking a lot and actively trying to be thankful and find a way to address the problem. Notably, although many systems such as government agencies, public benefit programs, family networks and churches are believed to provide a social safety net, participants of this study who had experienced financial challenges did not necessarily believe these systems to always be helpful. In fact, some expressed surprise or lack of knowledge about getting help to address financial challenges. Finally, although older adults have numerous strategies for weathering financial challenges, they nonetheless also reported experiencing adverse health consequences. Overall, these findings suggest that older adults facing financial challenges are actively addressing their financial challenges but are doing so without a reliable safety net and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by the challenge.\n\nThese findings are consistent with the Weathering Hypothesis5 and inform our understanding of the weathering process. The high-effort coping strategies used to weather financial challenges in this study are conceptually similar to John Henryism, which is defined as a tendency to use high-effort coping strategies to handle the socioeconomic disadvantage and discrimination experienced by many African Americans33 and is associated with poorer cardiovascular health among low income African Americans.34 There are at least three potential reasons why older adults use high-effort coping strategies to weather financial challenges. First, in this study and another study among individuals experiencing mortgage strain (i.e. difficulty paying the mortgage),35 participants reported a lack of system-level supports suggesting a weak social safety net. The lack of system-level supports may force individuals to fend for themselves, spending time, effort and energy to handle the financial challenge(s). Secondly, findings from other qualitative studies among low-income groups have shown that stigma36 and weariness after repeated financial challenges37 are also barriers to asking for help with financial challenges and these factors may influence whether an individual uses more high-effort coping strategies. Finally, since participants reported that lessons learned from experiencing one type of social adversity translated into their approach to different types of social adversity and since most participants were African American, they may have learned high-effort coping strategies, including John Henryism,33 from their own earlier life experiences or from their families. Regardless of the causes for using high-effort coping, findings from this study and prior studies linking John Henryism to poor health outcomes34,38 together suggest that weathering a financial challenge may help an individual address their momentary situation, but may take a toll on their well-being and health.\n\nThese findings build on prior studies linking financial challenges to earlier aging-related health outcomes (reviewed earlier) by suggesting potential mechanisms of action. Findings from this study show that low-income older adults with disabilities temporarily forego basic necessities such as food and medications when funds run low and this may contribute to earlier aging. Similarly, other studies have found that low-income adults typically reduce household spending on food and medical expenses39–42 and have reduced caloric intake and fewer servings of fruits43 at the end of the month when funds tend to run low. Foregoing food and medical care may adversely affect health; one study found that low-income adults have a 27% higher rate of hypoglycemia admissions in the last vs. first week of the month.44 Consistent with other findings45–47, findings from this study suggest that financial challenges trigger stress-response mechanisms. This study builds on prior work by also showing that low-income older adults likely employ high-effort coping strategies to address financial challenges. Since high-effort coping has been associated with poor health outcomes,33,34,38 this may be a pathway by which financial challenges accelerate the aging process.\n\nThese findings among older adults can be compared to those from similar studies in younger populations. Findings from this study about prioritizing necessities, thinking about budgeting and being thrifty were also found in another qualitative study that examined strategies used by young and middle-aged men with disabilities reliant on social benefits.48 However, some strategies used by younger adults in other studies were not recommended by older adults in this study, including borrowing from family or using credit cards or payday loans49 or relying on subsidies or community programs.48 This finding is important because individuals who are older50 and have disabilities51 are more likely to experience financial strain. Therefore, older adults with disabilities not only are more likely to experience financial challenges than younger individuals, but may also have fewer appropriate resources to address the challenge(s).\n\nImportantly, some participants who did not report food insecurity still describe running out of money for food. Together with results about being “thrifty”, these findings suggest that older adults may have grown accustomed to making daily compromises, and may reframe food insecurity as thriftiness. These findings are consistent with other qualitative studies that have shown that low-income households compromise dietary quality even if categorized as food secure52,53 and are often forced to choose between food, housing and medical needs.54–56 This is important because food insecurity tends to co-occur with financial challenges.57–59 Together, these findings suggest that low-income older adults may face trade-off decisions and compromise basic needs and call for refinement of food insecurity measures to screen vulnerable older adults.\n\nSocial desirability may have biased participant responses because financial challenges are socially stigmatizing. Also, this cross-sectional study could not validate findings related to the how the weathering process occurs over time and explore the evolution of adaptive responses over the life span. This study was strengthened by its conceptual grounding in the empirically tested Weathering Hypothesis.\n\nStudy findings have implications for future research. More research using a life course perspective is needed, both to better understand how early life experiences shape experiences of social adversity later in life and to understand how the process of weathering unfolds over the lifespan. Also, findings related to food insecurity in this study suggest that measurement work is needed to develop a more sensitive measure of food insecurity and a more exhaustive measure that accounts for trade-off decisions and the co-occurrence of food insecurity, financial strain and cost-related medication non-adherence. Research is also needed to develop and test strategies to improve access to supportive systems such as public benefits programs and increase the usefulness of those programs.\n\nTogether with results from other relevant studies reviewed earlier, these results have implications for policy. First, these findings highlight the need to reduce financial strain for low-income older adults with disabilities. Financial challenges are modifiable. As examples, there is evidence that implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Medicare Part D were associated with reductions in financial strain60 and cost-related medication non-adherence,61 respectively and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is associated with reduced food insecurity,62 less health care spending,63–65 and less cost-related medication non-adherence.66\n\nSecond, these findings suggest that system-level policies and programs that are intended to support economic well-being are not desirable for some of the most vulnerable in the population - older adults living with low-income and disability. Interventions are needed to develop and evaluate policies and programs that are better suited to the needs, preferences and constraints faced by low-income disabled older adults. Systems should be strengthened to increase benefits for those in need and streamlined to reduce barriers and improve timeliness of access for those with urgent financial needs. Furthermore, these findings show that systems may harm, as well as help. Policy makers should consider not only the health impact of policies,67 but also consider the impact of policy change on social determinants of health, such as the risk of increasing financial challenges for low-income populations. Findings also suggest that low-income older adults with disabilities should be more proactively targeted for food support, such as SNAP and Meals on Wheels because they may not seek out resources even if they need them."
