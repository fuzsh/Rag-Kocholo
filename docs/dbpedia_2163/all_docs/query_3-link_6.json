        "meta_description": "Pebbles – TLC  - The former R&B singer (and L.A. Reid's ex-wife) not only discovered TLC but managed the iconic trio as well. That is until T-Boz, Chilli and Left Eye felt she was ripping them off and parted ways with her management company, Pebbitone.   (Photos from Left: Mike Segar /Landov/Reuters/Hal Horowitz/PictureGroup) - Artists and managers have always relied on each other for mutual success. But as with any relationship, managing an entertainment career is a delicate balance of give and take. As Diddy reportedly found out this week with news that Nicki Minaj was dumping him as her manager, terminated management contracts are all too common once a star (or a star's spouse) starts to glimpse greener grass elsewhere. We took a look back at some of the most high profile artist/manager break-ups in recent memory and asked whether the splits made dollars and/or sense.",
