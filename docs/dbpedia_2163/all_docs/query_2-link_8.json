        "text": "What is something you are thankful for? If you have to think too hard about this then you have to start practicing gratitude. Gratitude is one of those things that I practice daily and is now a habit and way of life for me. Having a roof over your head, food on the table, and access to clean water are fundamental blessings. As a child growing up, some of these basic needs were not readily available to me and those experiences has shaped the way I look at everything in life. Now, I look at the bigger picture! When I wake up the first thing that I am thankful for, is that I woke up and can breathe on my own. I’m also thankful that I can get dressed on my own; some people need assistance. You know...just the little things. ➡ If you type too slow, be grateful that you have fingers. ➡ If your business did well, be thankful that your clients are satisfied and enjoy doing business with you. ➡ If your business struggled, be thankful that you gave it your all, and that you have another day, month or year to get it right next time. ➡ If you have road rage, be thankful that you have a car to express your road rage. ...you get the point! You don’t have to overthink it. If you do, be thankful that you were blessed with so much brain. #gratitudeinbusiness #gratitudeinaction #gratitudepost #gratitudefor2024\n\nHappy New Year 2024! Count your blessings, as you surely have many! Always remember 3 things: first, what makes you unique, second, what drives you for the day-to-day grind, and third, to never give up as this is not an option and should not exist in your vocabulary. And so, if and when you decide to start something, it is your responsibility to ensure that you finish it and that it gets completed. WE are all one. #success #workethic #diversityandinclusion #mentalhealthmatters #entrepreneurmindsets & #growthmindsets\n\nWill you hate me if I say you're blind? I don't mean it. If you feel grateful for → the roof over your top → the food above your table → the clothes on your body. And more privileged to → have hands that hold the mobile → an eye to give it a glimpse → a brain to perceive it → and you have a lot. And a lot to live the life you dream of. Why do you complain about the things that you can't take control of? You're not blind; your thoughts are what make you blind. Want to know the secret to the happiest life? Nothing more than being grateful for what you have. Gratitude helps with: → more productivity → customer retention → stress management → employee motivation → improved relationships If you find things to be grateful for, you're blessed, man. Don't rush. Breathe. Be grateful. Is this day showing you anything to be grateful for? Let me know in the comments. #gratitude #entrepreneurship #personalbrand #ghostwriting\n\nReflection boosts Gratitude 2024 is starting as a great and awesome year. We need to learn the act of gratitude even on the littlest things this year, let us shun ungrateful acts. Don't be an ingrate this year. Always take time to reflect on your wins, losses, and struggles A lot of time we don't take time to reflect on the journey that has made us who we are today. We are always particular about what life has for us more than the journey itself Most of the losses you experience on your path toward success are meant to train you on how to handle success. If you don't learn from it, you will probably make the same mistakes. Mark Mason in his book ' the subtle art of not giving a fuck\" gave a profound message that we need to choose our struggle and learn from both positive and negative sides. The line between successful people and other people is that they understand learning from losses and their wins The process is called the reflection process. Life is built on gratitude. If you can't reflect, you won't know what to be grateful for. Reflect on your journey and be grateful. What are you grateful for in your journey? #grateful #gratitude #2024goals #reflection #journey #wins #losses #process #life"
