I would love to go on tour with Luke Combs, Jimmie Allen, Maddie & Tae, and Chris Young.\n\nWhat is your ultimate career goal(s)?\n\nMy ultimate career goal is to obviously be a country singer songwriter. However, I also want to implement a conference for helping individuals on branding and helping them with connections when they are extremely ready for work."
