The live show is free to the public ages 21 and up.\n\nAt just 23 years old, Smith is one of country music’s most anticipated up-and-coming artists. In 2024, he was nominated among a prestigious group for New Male Artist of the Year. Smith is already a seasoned veteran of Nashville’s elite singer-songwriter community, having spent years matching a honeyed vocal with hints of bluegrass and rays of warmth from ‘90s country.\n\nSmith has an uncommon talent for mixing his prime-of-life passion with an old soul perspective. This results in an artist who knows the past can still inspire the present. His sound takes from the molds of instant-classic country and infuses it with a riveting, modern appeal. Smith’s critically acclaimed debut album, “Smoky Mountains,” featured the gold-certified song “Take It Slow,” the viral hit “I Hate Alabama” and the UK chart-topper “Creek Will Rise.”\n\nIn addition to his ACM nod, Smith was named an Artist to Watch by Spotify, Amazon Music and Opry NextStage and earned acclaim as the only country artist on Pandora’s 2022 Ten List, recognition from 2023’s MusicRow Next Big Thing and the CRS New Faces Class of 2024. Smith is undoubtedly a rising star who will continue to delight and surprise fans with his music and high-energy, fan-forward shows.

The Great Divide continues its much-awaited tour following a long hiatus after frontmen Mike McClure embarked on a solo career. Even after a long break, with many fans questioning the possibility of a reunion, The Great Divide continues to re-establish itself as the torchbearer of Red Dirt music.\n\nThe Great Divide marked their return to music with their first studio album in more than two decades, 2022's \"Providence.\" The album includes the autobiographical track \"Wrong is Overrated,\" which reflects on the band's split while keeping a forward-looking spirit. The album also includes the singles \"Good Side\" and \"Infinite Line,\" which both topped the Texas music charts.\n\nIn 2023, since releasing their latest album, The Great Divide earned three Texas Country Music Awards, including Country Band of the Year. The group has also played sold-out homecoming shows at Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom, Stillwater's Tumbleweed Dance Hall and the legendary Greune Hall.\n\nThe impact of The Great Divide on the alternative country and Red Dirt genre cannot be overstated. The band has not only influenced legions of other artists, but many often classify Red Dirt into two distinct eras: pre- and post-Great Divide. Now, after 30 years as a band, with a new era in the works, it is certain that time will only continue to pave the way for the band to lay claim to its much-deserving place in history.\n\nHard Rock Hotel & Casino Tulsa is the flagship property of Cherokee Nation Entertainment.
