The Graduate Research Forum is an opportunity for graduate students to showcase their research and creative projects and to receive valuable feedback from faculty judges. Awards for presentations deemed exemplary are given.\n\nUCF is canceling Student Research Week 2020, including the Graduate Research Forum.

However, your safety is our top priority, which is why we have made this decision.\n\nFor more details visit: Graduate Research Forum\n\nQuestions?
