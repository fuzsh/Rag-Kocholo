The singer responded by laughing hysterically.\n\n“Thembi, you’re awesome,” Ciara replied as she continued to giggle. “OK, I feel like that says it all,” Thembi replied.\n\nCiara and Future got engaged in 2013 and welcomed Future Zahir, now 9, the following year. The pair called it quits for good in 2014 amid rumors of infidelity on the rapper’s part. Following her breakup, Ciaria found her perfect match with Russell Wilson whom she wed in 2016.\n\nRelated: Inside Future's Family: See the Rapper's Children and Their Moms\n\nBig brood! With recent speculation about how many children are in Future’s family, take a look at the rapper’s paternity history. The Grammy winner, whose real name is Nayvadius Wilburn, wrote separate Mother’s Day messages in May 2020 for six of the women that he has kids with. “Happy Mother’s Day India,” the “Life Is […]\n\n“We’re humans just like everybody else, our relationship is no different in the everyday relationship,” Ciara explained to the outlet of her relationship with Wilson, 34. “We have lives that aren’t the most normal but we are human, our blood is red … I think the most important thing is just living our life as best as we can and being the best example for our kids. That’s important to me.”\n\nIn addition to being a mother to Future Zahir, Ciara also shares daughter Sienna, 6, and son Win, 3, with the Denver Broncos quarterback. In August, Ciara announced she and Wilson are expecting their third child.\n\n“You look at me like that again, we make another kid,” the singer captioned an Instagram video, quoting her new song “How We Roll” with Chris Brown. “You my heart I’m your rib.” In the clip, Ciara posed with her back to the camera before turning to the side to display her growing baby bump.\n\nIn June 2019, Ciara opened up about her 2014 split from Future and how it wasn’t ideal during an appearance on Red Table Talk.\n\n“I grew up with my mom and dad being together, the idea of it being, ‘Mommy and Daddy that made baby.’ Then, all of a sudden, you’re living your life in front of the world,” she said on the Facebook Watch show at the time. “That adds a whole other layer. ‘I feel like I’m failing right now. They’re gonna roast me. Here they come in the comment section.’ … All that stuff. It’s real. You can’t help but to think of it.”\n\nRelated: Russell Wilson and Ciara’s Relationship Timeline\n\nWinning at love! Russell Wilson and Ciara’s relationship has been going strong since they first started dating in 2015 — and it doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon. The Seattle Seahawks quarterback gushed over his love in July 2015, while confirming that the duo had chosen to remain celibate until marriage. “I need […]\n\nWhile the idea of being a single mom terrified her, Ciara realized she wanted her son to be surrounded by love.\n\n“When I was thinking about my son, I know what I want to feel,” she confessed. “Like, I know the kind of love I want for us. If you stay in situations that are not healthy, or if you let them linger too long, you start to lose yourself. I don’t like crying all the time. I don’t like being sad, so I was like, ‘How do I get out of this?’”"
