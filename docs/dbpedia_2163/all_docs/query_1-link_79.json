        "text": "Brian Eno\n\nPress shot by Shamil Tanna\n\nBrian Eno - musician, producer, visual artist, activist. First came to international prominence in the early '70s as a founding member of British band, Roxy Music. His visionary production includes albums with Talking Heads, Devo, U2, Laurie Anderson and Coldplay, whilst his long list of collaborations include recordings with David Bowie, David Byrne, Grace Jones, Karl Hyde, James Blake among many. His visual experiments with light and video continue to parallel his musical career with exhibitions all over the globe. To date he has released over 30 albums of his own music, exhibited extensively as far afield as the Venice Biennale and the sails of the Sydney Opera House and is a founder-member of the Long Now Foundation, a trustee of Client Earth, and Patron of Videre Est Credere.\n\n«I bought Pianoteq 6 a couple of weeks ago. I think it is the most well-realised and intelligently constructed piece of music software I've ever had the pleasure of using. It is an absolute milestone. Aside from its incredible power as an emulator of pianos, the possibilities that unfold when you start to edit the models are astonishing. I've been lost in it since I bought it, and keep dragging friends into the studio to show them this miracle. The randomisation possibilities are so intelligently constructed and are a great help in understanding the enormous variety of possibilities this instrument offer. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a piece of software design and I just wanted to thank the team who put this together.»\n\nBrian Eno's official website: https://www.beatinkuk.com/brian-eno\n\nGlen Andrew Brown\n\nGlen Andrew Brown is a BAFTA-winning music producer, arranger, mixer, sound designer, and composer. Brown is known for his work on numerous AAA video game titles, including PlayStation’s ’Returnal’ (BAFTA-winning, Best Music, Ivor Novello-nominated, Best Original Video Game Score) and ‘Sackboy: A Big Adventure’ (BAFTA-nominated for Best Music). Brown’s next PlayStation score release will be ‘Climate Station’, a free-to-all collaboration between Sony and the United Nations, where he made extensive use of Pianoteq and its features.\n\n«Pianoteq is truly incredible. It accurately recreates the billions of combinations of sympathetic resonances that occur between strings in real pianos, something impossible to capture with traditional samples. The sound and feel are scarily realistic! It's also incredibly lightweight; it barely takes up any space on my hard drive, making it super easy to take my setup anywhere. Plus, the ability to position virtual microphones anywhere in the room is a total game-changer for sound design and mixing, especially when working with Dolby Atmos and other surround formats.»\n\nGlen Andrew Brown's official website: http://www.glenandrewbrown.com/\n\nDavid Hein\n\nDavid Hein, a.k.a. Dramakid, is a Grammy Award-winning music producer and songwriter who has worked with many established artists. Among his collaborations is his production work on Ciara's track 'BRB', as well as Lecrae’s hit song 'Your Power', for which he received a Grammy for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song. He has also recently produced on 'Push Ups' and 'Family Matters' by Drake.\n\n«The physical modeling technology of Pianoteq offers exceptional flexibility and detail that cannot be achieved with traditional sampling methods. This flexibility allows me to shape and customize sounds precisely, greatly expanding my creative possibilities as a producer.»\n\nDavid Hein's official website: https://genius.com/artists/Dramakid\n\nLewis Thompson\n\nLewis Thompson, who is also one half of the dance duo Just Kiddin’, is a Leeds-based artist/producer who has worked with some of the biggest names in pop, writing and producing hits for Joel Corry (‘Sorry’, ‘Bed’, ‘Out Out’), Little Mix (‘Kiss My (Uh Oh)’), Becky Hill (‘Remember’), James Hype (‘Afraid’) and Digital Farm Animals (‘Last Night’).\n\n«I've been using the Modartt Pianoteq for a couple of weeks now, and I couldn't be happier with it. The sheer number of high-quality, professional instruments available is astounding. Whether I need a grand piano, electric piano, or any other keyboard instrument, I can access them quickly and easily, making my workflow extra efficient. One of the standout features for me is how low the CPU intensity is. I can switch between different sounds rapidly without experiencing any latency, which is something I've never encountered with other similar plug-ins. This efficiency allows me to focus more on my music and less on technical issues. Pianoteq has really changed the way I create music, and I highly recommend it to any musician or producer looking for top-notch sound quality and performance.»\n\nLewis Thompson's official website: https://www.lewisthompsonmusic.com/\n\nMike Gorman\n\nMike Gorman is the keyboard player with The Manfreds (original members of the 1960’s group Manfred Mann) and musical director of Kid Creole and the Coconuts (for 12 years). He has toured extensively worldwide with many artists including Boy George/Culture Club, Incognito, Us3, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Marlena Shaw, China Moses, Trevor Horn. Currently, he runs a Patreon site dedicated to his approach to jazz piano playing and improvisation.\n\n«I use Pianoteq every single day. It’s pretty much instant loading time and amazing quality of sounds make it my immediate goto for any writing, recording, working on ideas, learning repertoire for touring/gigs or just sitting and enjoying improvising at the keyboard. I’ll often come in from a gig, sit down, launch Pianoteq and just play a few chords, enjoying the immersive sounds and fantastic responsiveness of the instruments. All the acoustic pianos are outstanding and the electric piano modules are the best sounding and most versatile I’ve come across given how editable and flexible they are. The guitar is amazing too. I can get a great jazz guitar sound out of the inbuilt amplified preset which plays fantastically well on the keyboard! The great thing about the acoustic pianos is how individual and unique they all are in character, which is great for when you want to use the sounds to inspire the musical direction you’d like to pursue on occasion. Keep up the good work Modartt! I’m very excited for the future of this amazing software as well as completely taken with it’s present form..»\n\nMike Gorman's official website: https://www.Patreon.com/MikeGormanMusic\n\nRubén Valtierra\n\nAfter leading the very popular funk/fusion group Rush Hour for many years in Santa Cruz, Ca, Rubén moved to L.A. to seek further fame and fortune. Soon after arriving, he was playing, recording and traveling the world with members of groups such as Santana, Aretha Franklin, Tom Jones, Natalie Cole, Tower of Power, Chick Corea, Elton John, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and others.

When not touring, Rubén is active writing and producing, as well as leading the Valtierra Latin Orchestra featuring some of the best artists in the world of Latin Jazz.\n\n«In studio and concert work with with Al, it is beyond imperative to have the very best pianos available. Pianoteq 8 is very happily exceeding All expectations. Thanks again Modartt!!»\n\nRubén Valtierra's official website: https://rubenvaltierra.com/\n\nMarius de Vries\n\nProducer and Composer Marius de Vries has been behind some of the most culture-defining recordings and soundtracks of the past three decades, and has won two BAFTAs and an Ivor Novello award for his film composition work, as well a Grammy and five Grammy nominations for soundtrack and record production. He is perhaps most widely known recently for his score for the 2022 Academy Award best-picture winner CODA, and his role as Music Director and Music Producer on Damien Chazelle’s multi-award-winning musical La La Land.\n\n«Several versions in, I still find it miraculous that Modartt can do this without samples! Pianoteq sounds fantastic, and it’s as easy as can be, when you need it to be easy, and as deep as you could wish for when you need it to be deep.»\n\nMarius de Vries's official website: https://www.mariusdevries.com/\n\nEvan Shinners\n\nEvan Shinners is the founder of the Bach Store and the host of the WTF Bach Podcast. He is a keyboardist and writer who studied at The Juilliard School.

The WTF Bach Podcast (wtfbach.substack.com) breaks down sophisticated ideas about Bach in a way that's accessible to beginners or those with limited musical background.\n\n«Organteq is absolutely brilliant! I can be at the console- or in the cathedral- with dozens of organs throughout different periods of history. An essential tool to hear different tunings and introduce the art of registration.»\n\nJ.S. Bach - Fugue after Albinoni - BWV 946\n\nPerformed by Evan Shinners\n\nOrganteq 2: Historical Baroque Two-Manual II (Arnstadt)\n\nSimon-Mary Vincent\n\nSimon-Mary Vincent is a Hungarian-British performer and composer of acoustic and electronic music, who has been challenging the boundaries of genre and musical expression with a highly personal language since the early 1990’s. “Visionary, expressive”, “rich, surprising”, “incredibly individual”, “masterful compositions”, “an immersive experience”, her music has been performed worldwide, attracting praise from The Wire, International Piano, BBC Radio 3, Avant Music News and Jazzwise among many others. In 2024, she received an Innovation in Business award as Most Innovative Piano Music Composer 2023 (UK).\n\n«I want to thank you for the amazing software. I have been working with Steingraeber Pianos in Bayreuth on their Transducer Piano since 2018. I was introduced to Pianoteq through them, and use it for all my compositions, practice, and performances, where no acoustic piano is available.»\n\nSimon-Mary Vincent's official website: http://www.simon-mary-vincent.com/\n\nSteve Nathan\n\nNashville based session keyboardist Steve Nathan is a 40 year veteran of the recording industry, who has played on hundreds of records spanning most genres of popular music. A list of artists with whom he’s recorded reads like a “Who’s Who” of American music. A frequent nominee and Winner of The Academy of Country Music’s 2005 Musician Award, he has also been named “Keyboardist of the Year” by Music Row Magazine for a record setting 13 consecutive years.\n\n«Virtual Piano. The Great White Whale. I’ve spent my career playing great pianos, and for nearly 50 years, I’ve had the unbelievably good fortune of hearing those great pianos with many of the world’s greatest recording engineers applying their magic. From the 9’ Baldwin at Muscle Shoals Sound with a pair of Tommy Wright’s hand made microphones and Steve Melton on the board, to Blackbird D’s C7 with Julian King and 3 Elam 251s, to the Steinways, Faziolis, Bechsteins, and more in many of the best studios on the planet. It can spoil a guy! The downside, of course is that I was never satisfied with the piano sound in so many of the smaller rooms. And with today’s preponderance of Home Studios, often with no real piano at all, my quest for a satisfying substitute has been constant. Like a lot of players, I was intrigued by the technology of Pianoteq when it first came out. I bought a few of the earlier versions, but found I always fell back on whatever my favorite “sampled” piano was at that time. For years, Pianoteq has remained a close “second” to the best of the sampled libraries. Recently though my friends on the Keyboard Corner Forum convinced me to listen to Pianoteq 8, and man were they right. I truly believe that Modartt has taken the lead, bypassing the best of the sampled pianos. I own dozens of sampled piano libraries, and Pianoteq 8 is just richer, realer, and more inspiring than all of them. I’m especially blown away by the Steinway D and the Bechstein, but there are so many good choices, a near endless palette of piano sounds, I know I can set up in any room now, and not be hampered with an inferior sounding piano ever again.»\n\nToby Pitman\n\nToby Pitman is a Guitarist/Programmer/Sound Designer based at Air Studios in London. Working mostly in Film and TV production Toby has worked with a host of producers and composers including David Arnold, Giles Martin, Clint Mansell and Simon Franglen. Over the years he has worked on a number of diverse projects ranging from scores like Rocketman, Quantum of Solice and Paul to events and attractions like the London 2012 Olympics and Avatar World. Other musical credits include Paul McCartney, George Michael, Shirley Bassey and Clyde Stubblefield\n\n«Pianoteq has been on pretty much every project I’ve worked on since 2013. It’s not just the Pianos that are fantastic either. Every single instrument in it goes way beyond any sample based product in terms of realism and customisation. Pair that with its layering and morphing functions, Pianoteq also becomes an incredibly fun and versatile sound design platform that is unmatched in my book.»\n\nDavid Arnold\n\nPress shot by Julie Edwards\n\nDavid Arnold is a multi award-winning British film and television composer known for scoring films such as Independence Day, Stargate, The Chronicles of Narnia, Godzilla, Zoolander and Hot Fuzz. He is most recognised for taking the mantle of composer from John Barry for the James Bond film series.

Coming in 2022 is the film “Confess, Fletch” with Jon Hamm; “ Inside Man “ for BBC/Netflix written by Steven Moffat and starring David Tennant and Stanley Tucci; and Season 2 of Neil Gaimans “Good Omens”.\n\n«I’ve been using Pianoteq for some years now and it’s become my go to instrument for pretty much all acoustic keyboard sounds. Its remarkable facility to not only faithfully reproduce classic piano and keyboard instruments but also give you the ability to control so many elements of the sound as well as blending together to create truly unique sounds is almost endless.»\n\nMaor Levi\n\nMaor Levi is no stranger to the dance music scene.

The interface is seamless and the music seems to appear of its own volition. It has always been a challenge to play a virtual instrument and really “get lost” in the experience. The limits of the software, sonically and technically, almost always prevent that kind of connection. Pianoteq 7 is a revelation. Being a modeled instrument, the limits of sampling are removed. And the modeling itself is so masterfully done that I swear I am hearing the “real thing”. Both the D and the B are marvelous, and simply the best virtual piano instruments I have ever experienced. I am looking forward to playing, writing, and recording with these wonderful pianos.

I use Pianoteq to match the sound of pianos I perform on to create the perception of twin piano rising from the acoustic piano as I play. I then use Pianoteq to create an infinite sustain which enables me to transform the piano sound in various ways.

What immediately comes to mind is changing the tuning on the fly. For a new concerto for piano and orchestra by Malte Giesen - which will be premiered with the Wiener Symphoniker this Fall - we use Pianoteq in conjunction with Yamaha’s transacoustic piano and Cycling ’74 Max. Yamaha’s transacoustic piano looks and feels like a grand piano. However, it uses transistors on the soundboard and the piano sound that will be heard will indeed be that of Pianoteq going through the body of a real grand piano. Max is then used to transform the piano in real time, like shortening and prolonging the strings to achieve a glissando effect. It will indeed sound like a electric guitar’s whammy bar has been attached to a grand piano. With Pianoteq I can go where no piano has gone before.»\n\nSebastian Berweck's official website: http://www.sebastianberweck.de\n\nSonya Belousova\n\nSonya Belousova’s unique career presents a rare blend of contrasting genres and forms bringing her equal recognition as a composer and pianist.

As a former owner of an 1899 Steinway grand and various examples of Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos, I’m hard to please - and now I’m pleased!

However, there are situations these days where using an acoustic piano is not possible. Pianoteq offers professional classical pianists the next best thing to a Steinway, making it possible to perform new music requiring different sounds, micro-tunings and remapping of the keyboard. The physically modeled sound is fabulous and requires a fraction of the computer load-time and power required for sample sets, and gives the performer much more control over transferring their individual technique in an acoustic environment to an electronic one of the highest quality.

When I heard Pianoteq 5 I realised that goal had been achieved but what was a revelation to me was how it feels to play. Even the best sounding sampled pianos leave you feeling somehow detached from the instrument by comparison.

He was an early believer in the new electronic music technology and was the first studio drummer to adapt programming into his work. He's responsible for crafting unique sounds and exploring previously uncharted territory, paving the way for contemporary hip hop and innovating beat making techniques that are firmly established as part of the lexicon of modern recording. We have all heard his work in many hit records of the 1980's and 1990's by Madonna, Duran Duran, Mick Jagger, Peter Gabriel, Cyndi Lauper, Hall & Oates, Steve Winwood, Carly Simon, Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, just to name a few. In 2006, Bralower signed soul singer Ryan Shaw to his production company, and through a deal with Columbia Records received a Grammy nomination for the debut album This Is Ryan Shaw. Shaw's first Dynotone release, the album Real Love, has generated two more Grammy nominations. Sax man Mark Rivera's album Common Bond, featuring guest appearances by Ringo Starr and Billy Joel, was recently released to critical acclaim.\n\n«At my studio, I work with some excellent keyboardists who can be very picky about piano sounds, touch, feel etc. The minute I would put the Pianoteq sounds up for my keyboard players, there's been a constant reaction of What's THAT?! They not only sound and play great on their own, but more importantly, they translate straight to the track & sound amazing in a mix. The biggest problem is figuring out which one to use. Pianoteq has set a high bar & the modeling technology not only sounds awesome, but is taking up a fraction of the memory of other similar instruments in my system.»\n\nJimmy Bralower's official website: https://www.jimmybralowerproductions.com/\n\nJason Miles\n\nGrammy Award winner Jason Miles is a producer, arranger, composer, and keyboardist.

A graduate of The Curtis Institute of Music, Hugh joined the faculty in 1993 and currently serves as Director of Student Recitals and Instrumental Accompaniment.\n\n«Working with digital pianos had always been an exercise in frustrating limitations, a bit like being forced to color by numbers with no more than 10 crayons at a time. Even high-end piano sample libraries have been extremely disappointing, offering exquisitely recorded piano sounds completely divorced from any real interaction or control of the sound beyond a relatively sparse range of touch. MODARTT PIANOTEQ, on the other hand, represents a stunning breakthrough, making it possible for the first time for a serious musician to work with a digital instrument that gives virtually the full color palette of a 'real' acoustic piano. PIANOTEQ responds in the widest dynamic range I've ever experienced in a computer instrument, from the most delicate pianissimos to keybed-thumping fortissimos, complete with all the physical phenomena that accompanies such deliveries like sympathetic vibrations, soundboard echo, and an amazing variance of hammer/string interactions. Damper control is amazingly continuous and realistic, enabling the most subtle tapers of note-ends and flutter pedal effects.\n\nYou can actually work on this virtual piano and start to discuss possibilities of tone, color, articulation - all the expressive qualities normally associated only with fully acoustic counterparts! Any digital piano will sound decent at a loud, narrow dynamic range, but PIANOTEQ really shines in the subtleties of pianissimo colorations and the full feel of control throughout sound production. As Josef Hoffman once marveled at the Duo-Art Piano Roll's capability to capture the essence of a great musical performance, I'm similarly inclined to marvel at the way PIANOTEQ is able to express the full musical intentions of the pianist, lending itself elegantly as an artistic tool for the pianists of today's digital age»\n\nChopin - Waltz Op. 69 No 1\n\nPerformed by Hugh Sung\n\nPianoteq 7: I.

I have been aware of Pianoteq for quite some time, and now finally getting around to interfacing it into my workflow. I am intrigued by the approach to replicating, in that this is a model, and not samples. From what I can discern so far, the rendering is pretty faithful to the real thing, and I can definitely see it being one of my \"go to\" software pianos»\n\nKevin McAlea\n\nKevin McAlea played keyboards on the first Kate Bush tour and again in 2014 on Kate's \"Before The Dawn\" series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo.

He has written music for film, TV and songs for Pearson education. He wrote the English lyrics for Nena's 99 Red Balloons.\n\n«I have always been a fan of physical modelling to create a virtual piano as they sound more realistic. As with a real piano the timbre changes with the dynamics you put in, so for example play it harder and it gets brighter. Using samples to emulate this can be hit and miss. The range of historic pianos available in Pianoteq is remarkable. The Pianoteq electric pianos are excellent with a wide range of modelled classics to choose from.

It brings back the joy of playing on an acoustic instrument. I especially enjoy the new electric pianos MKI (R2) and W1 but all instruments are great and deeply customizable. The ability of being able to change the mic placement and also the amount of control you get with \"Note Edit\" opens quite a lot of possibilities. Best of all, it doesn't require a dongle, loads in an instant and has a very small memory footprint so I can make use of my precious SSD memory for something else.

Unfortunately it weights about 900 pounds and is over 7 feet long and 5 feet wide, it just will not fit into my carry-on bag. Pianoteq's AU instrument is not only convenient, it's solid and it sounds amazing. It loads fast, doesn't crash and gives you control over its many parameters that allow the user to shape and contour each sound in any way you can imagine. Whether I'm writing, performing, or recording this piano covers it all.

His recent soundtrack for the independent feature Movement and Location was voted Best Original Score at the 2014 Brooklyn Film Festival.\n\n«Of all the piano sounds I've tried, Pianoteq is by far the most versatile. I love being able to play with every aspect of the sound of the instrument, from the length of the strings to the placement of the mics used to record it. It's also one of the most expressive digital piano sounds I've used. In a live setting, its notes speak with integrity and musicality. As a pianist who is also passionate about math and programming, I particularly appreciate the elegance and economy of Pianoteq — it's amazing that it can achieve what it does with such a minuscule footprint, when sampled pianos can take over entire hard drives. Congrats to the Pianoteq team for digging deep into what it means to build a digital piano from raw math and physics!»\n\nGoldberg Variations #3 (J.S Bach)\n\nPerformed by Dan Tepfer\n\nPianoteq 5: D4 Grand Piano\n\nDan Tepfer's official website: http://www.dantepfer.com\n\nSven Martin\n\nSven Martin is an in-demand performance keyboardist and studio producer/songwriter.

His technical mastery of the instrument and his musical intuition brought him recognition by his contemporaries, which provided him many experiences and collaborations as programmer (from Vangelis to Vladimir Cosma), instrumentalist (Steve Hillage, Jon Hassell, Didier Malherbe and numerous African projects) or arranger (Xalam, Salif Keita, Leonard Cohen, Youssou N’Dour). During the last three decades, Jean-Philippe Rykiel has been involved in many pioneering projects - from Salif Keita's \"Soro\" to \"The Lama's Chant\" and has gained a reputation as one of the world's foremost keyboard players who also has impressive talents as a writer, arranger and producer.\n\n«I have always admired the wonderful work and innovative concept of Pianoteq. When I tried out version 4, I found a real physical pleasure in playing the D4. I didn't want to fiddle with settings or anything, I just wanted to play and it felt real good. In the following audio demo, I used the unique possibilities of Pianoteq Pro. I made a sound derived from the D4 Jazz B/A preset where I tried to simulate what happens when you put your hands on the strings. So the middle of the keyboard has this handMute effect, while the low and high octaves remain unchanged. I alternate this sound with the original D4 Jazz B/A preset, guaranteed without overdubs! Below is a song I wrote as a tribute to Vangelis, who I had the privilege to know and play with. It shows Pianoteq in context. I used the harp in the 1st part of the song and the D4 piano in the 2nd part.»\n\nJohn 'Rabbit' Bundrick\n\nNow established as a composer in the world of film music, John 'Rabbit' Bundrick divides the year between writing and world tours with world class artists. It all started at the age of seven when he received his first piano and began banging on it straight away. Soul music and sessions soon followed, most particularly work with Johnny Nash. Eventually he found his own unique instrumental voice on the Hammond Organ. He worked with Bob Marley, Free and finally, The Who.\n\n«I don’t know how Pianoteq do it, but they just keep on getting better and better. They are my go-to software for all sorts of instruments now. This should be your 1st Stop if you’re searching for fabulous software. GO TO PIANOTEQ... And ORGANTEQ: Never mind the other organs. USE THIS ONE. I was using the demo for while, just to see what it was like. I told myself, \"I wish I could use it in Logic.\" So I bought it, and it is absolutely fabulous.

Their debut album \"One step beyond\" catapulted them into the charts all over Europe, giving the teenagers multiple platinum status.\n\nEvery kid in the UK and Europe danced to Songs such as \"Baggy Trousers\" or \"Night Boat To Cairo\", their trademark 'nutty sound'. After their world smash \"Our House\", with which they entered the US charts for the first time in 1980 Madness became a household name all over the world. The string of hits continued until the band took a break in 1985. They returned with a bang when they organised the 1992 Madstock concerts in London's Finsbury Park, the only Live event to date to literally register on the Richter scale due to the enthusiastic pogo-ing of the 70.000 punters over the two days. Since then Madness have enjoyed continued success of the live circuit worldwide and are currently working on the follow up of the 2005 album \"The Dangermen Sessions\".\n\nMike's keyboard sound has, although intricately layered with strings, mallets and other, more synthetic colours of the sonic spectrum, always had a firm base in the piano. Since most Madness songs are essentially written around a piano part the quality of this instrument is crucial to band's overall sound.\n\nRecently, Mike has changed his hardware rack for a computer set-up, and while a lot of the synthesizers and sample based natural sounds such as strings were relatively easy to port across, even some of the most high-end piano sample libraries ultimately disappointed him. Moving away from samples he discovered in PIANOTEQ the perfect tool, both in the studio and on the road. The moderate CPU load it puts on a system, combined with superb sonic performance and low inherent latency make it the ideal base for his key rig now. In a series of recent concerts PIANOTEQ has proven to be exactly what was called for, both musically and technically.\n\n«PIANOTEQ plays like a real piano and sounds natural like a real piano. I like the fact one can change the different elements, it's very versatile. Unlike many of the other software pianos I tried this one really sounds good, is simple and can deliver drastically different types of Piano sound... they all sound good, which is just what I want!»\n\nNever Knew Your Name\n\nPerformed by Madness\n\nPianoteq 4: D4 Grand Piano\n\nMike Barson's official website: http://www.madness.co.uk/\n\nMiles Black\n\nCurrently based in Vancouver, Miles has a wealth of musical experience as an arranger, producer, composer, session musician, guitarist, bassist, saxophonist, songwriter, musical theatre director, music therapist and college level music instructor.

Some of my film cue arrangements are realized with over 75 tracks of audio and virtual instruments, with dozens of effects plug-ins. In these instances, it's vital to have a solid, expressive piano sound that loads quickly and requires a minimum of CPU resources. PIANOTEQ's customizable capability provides me with every type of sound required for every type of mood and situation. PIANOTEQ has become my 'go to' instrument for sketching and final production»\n\nKlaus Badelt's official website: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046004/\n\nLudovico Einaudi\n\nComposer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi has been described as minimalist, classical, ambient, contemporary and deeply touching the welcome sound of stillness in a hectic world.

The sound is great, it's very easy to use, and I can easily adjust it to my sound needs. Not to mention the important fact that it's very light and it never slows down my computer when I work»\n\nLudovico Einaudi's official website: http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com\n\nSteve Nieve\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Steve Nieve, has provided the signature sound to Elvis Costello from the first note of the Attractions right up to the present day Imposters.

Steve and Muriel are now creating a completely digital opera and Pianoteq software will be an important part of this creation.\n\n«I have always been impressed by the results I am able to achieve with Pianoteq. It sounds as natural or as unnatural as I want. Pianoteq's sound editing facilities make it extremely versatile for the modern pianist with an ear to fine audio tuning. I love the slider that sets the condition of the piano from pristine to totally destroyed. The designers have thought to everything, but have managed to maintain a simple interface which never gets in the way of musical creativity. All the add ons sound equally realistic and the other important dimension is the effects section, absolutely wonderful and simple to operate. Another important consideration, the superb responsiveness of this software, that sets it apart from all other virtual pianos. Every style of music that I'm interested in is instantly playable on Pianoteq. I love working, playing and creating music with this incredibly powerful, deceptively simple software.»\n\nKeyboard Jungle\n\nPerformed by Steve Nieve\n\nPianoteq 4: Bluethner (Studio)\n\nMan With A Musical Lighter\n\nPerformed by Steve Nieve\n\nPianoteq 4: U4 (Midnight)\n\nMore info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nieve\n\nJimmy George\n\nJimmy George is a multiple Grammy nominee for best songwriter.

There weren't really any that could be used professionally, and that was frustrating to me, as I had sold my grand piano when I moved. I was looking for a new one, and, (as an equipment guru), noticed this brand new program at the Guitar Center in Hollywood. The salesman informed me that it had just arrived, and they had not had time to set up a demo. I was a customer they did not want to lose, so I insisted they set it up so I could hear it. I still recall when I plugged in the earphones to the Korg 88 controller, the first note I played, blew me away. At first I thought it was this expensive Korg, but then I had never heard any digital keyboard sound this authentic.\n\nNot only was I amazed, and sat there for two hours, but a line was beginning to form when we put it through some decent stereo speakers. Needless to say, they sold out that day. I was very fortunate to be one of the first to own it. Since then, I've been using my Pianoteq for almost all of my sessions. I strive to get the finest pianists in Los Angeles, and I would get the same reaction from them, that I had, when they first played it. They couldn't believe it either.\n\nI now have Pianoteq 4 Pro, and I love it! It is rock solid as a stand-alone, or a plug-in, and the user interface is classy and beautiful. The presets are incredibly authentic, but you still have the option to tweak any sound from any preset, to your own ears, which is more fun than a task. You can save it as your own, and recall it in a second. You really have to own this, before you can truly appreciate the genius behind this product. It's that one ultimate software you didn't know you could not live without.»\n\nJimmy George's official website: http://www.jimmygeorge.com\n\nBT\n\nComposer and technologist BT is one of the most cutting-edge artists and producers for a dizzying array of musical styles.

Finally it is here, a piano model that surpasses in detail, nuance, accuracy, playability and elegance the most sophisticated of sample based libraries. Math can be beautiful, Pianoteq is proof. Play this now, you won't believe it»\n\nBT's official website: http://www.btmusic.com\n\nThomas G:son\n\nThomas G:son has written many songs in different national pre-selections for the hugely popular Eurovision Song Contest which is watched by a hundred million television viewers every year.

From day one I've been using it in literally every production and I'm always mesmerized and inspired by its sound! Playing Pianoteq just feels fantastic - like painting music with a natural instrument, offering a huge arsenal of colours to paint the picture in the way you want it. You can tweak the acoustic textures and materials whenever necessary, at any time! I love it for the amazing acoustic and e-piano sounds and the add-ons are incredible! But its physical modelling engine is also one of my secret weapons for sound design. It is the perfect studio tool for sculpting new, fresh or inspiring (and sometimes) crazy sounds! Pianoteq has become the number one choice VSTi for my inspiration and my daily work.»\n\nPhilippe van Eecke's official website: http://www.klangzeuger.de/\n\nGunnar Örn Tynes\n\nGunnar Örn Tynes is a front member of the experimental Icelandic musical group múm.

They are regularly touring worldwide and have released 7 albums.\n\n«Amazing things are happening in the world of physical modeling and I think Pianoteq is the cutting edge when it comes to quality in sound and realistic feel. I have always had a problem with most digital pianos / instruments, they never capture my creative side but since getting to know Pianoteq I haven´t been able to stop playing. The idea of preserving old instruments this way is encouraging for musicians and enables them to explore a huge world of historic instruments, sounds that are actually shaped from a physical world. Musicians that travel a lot know the burden of having to carry around say a wurlitzer, vibraphone and a celesta. They now can save their backs because at last there is a fantastic, realistically sounding plugin that doesn´t deplete your computer's processing power»\n\nGunnar Örn Tynes's official website: http://mum.is/\n\nRichard Harvey\n\nRichard Harvey is a sought after film composer and conductor, collaborating with major contemporary composers including John Williams, Stanley Myers, Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Maurice Jarre and many others.

Having said that, it is much more than that, it gives you many pianos with many ways to hear and feel those pianos. Paired with a good physical keyboard the experience is tactile and inspiring and as such I feel drawn to sit and play Pianoteq in the same way that I'm am drawn to a beautiful 9' grand sitting in the corner of a a studio or on a concert stage. It has that magnetism. There have been very creditable attempts at sampled pianos around for a long while. Some are impressive (though profligate with your drive space and processing power!) but they all lack what I call the heart of a piano.... the ability to really \"sing\" in the middle range between A=220 and A=880. This, for me, is the the most significant edge that Pianoteq has over its likely competitors and as such feels to me rather like the dawning of a new age!»\n\nRichard Harvey's official website: http://www.richardharvey.net\n\nMore info: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006124/\n\nJon Vezner\n\nJon Vezner is a songwriter/singer/producer.

I've found it to be very inspiring. And to add to that, being a modeled piano it requires no samples and uses hardly any resources I see no need to go through trying to mic a real piano. And especially for the project studio it is a dream come true»\n\nJon Vezner's official website: http://jonvezner.com\n\nStuart Crichton\n\nStuart Crichton is a successful, Australian based, international songwriter and producer who has garnered several Top 10 UK and international hits.
