Comes Around, Suit & Tie, Mirrors and Canât Stop The Feeling are amongst the most iconic of the period.\n\n“Putting this deal together has been a complete labour of love for Justin, Rick, David and myself and Iâm delighted to welcome them all to the Hipgnosis Family. This is the beginning of what we believe will be an incredible relationship important to us all.â\n\nâI am excited to be partnering with Merck and Hipgnosis â he values artists and their creative work and has always been a strong supporter of songwriters and storytelling.”\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nJustin Timberlake said: âI am excited to be partnering with Merck and Hipgnosis â he values artists and their creative work and has always been a strong supporter of songwriters and storytelling.\n\n“I look forward to entering this next chapter.â\n\nÂ âMerck has a true love for music. His passion is infectious and inspiring.”\n\nRick Yorn, LBI EntertainmentÂ\n\nRick Yorn, LBI Entertainment said: âMerck has a true love for music. His passion is infectious and inspiring. We are so excited to enter this new chapter with Merck and his team.â\n\nDavid Lande and Mitch Tenzer, Ziffren Brittenham LLP, said: “Justin’s incredible catalogue will join other amazing works at Hipgnosis which we know will serve as a great steward of his work. We look forward to a great partnership between Justin and Hipgnosis.”\n\nJustin Timberlake has released five solo albums between 2002 and 2018 â including 2002âs Justified (3x RIAA platinum) 2006âs FutureSex/LoveSounds (4x platinum), 2013âs The 20/20 Experience (2x platinum) and The 20/20 Experience â 2 of 2 (1x platinum), and 2018âs Man of the Woods (1x platinum) â along with 40 solo singles and featured singles alongside such artists as Nelly, Snoop Dogg, The Lonely Island, Timbaland, 50 Cent, Madonna, T.I., Ciara, Jamie Foxx, Jay-Z, The Black Eyed Peas, and more.\n\nHis collective body of work includes four No.1 albums in the US and four No.1 solo singles on Billboardâs Hot 100, including SexyBack, My Love, What Goes Around…Comes Around, and Canât Stop The Feeling!.\n\nTimberlake first came to worldwide fame in 1995 as a member of NSYNC.\n\nWith total worldwide sales now over 70 million, the group earned Diamond certification for 1997âs self-titled debut (currently boasting US sales of over 11 million) and 2000âs chart- topping, 11x platinum No Strings Attached (14.5 million sales), while 2001âs Celebrity earned 5x platinum with sales now approaching 6 million.\n\nThe latter album â which like its predecessor reached No.1 in the US and charts around the globe â saw Timberlake coming into his own as a versatile songwriter on such award- winning hits as Pop, the Grammy Award-nominated Gone, and the worldwide No.1, Girlfriend.\n\nOver their career, NSYNC receive a host of international awards and honors, including eight Grammy Award nominations, three American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, and seven MTV Video Music Awards, with 2000âs No Strings Attached receiving a Guinness World Record as the âfastest selling pop album in US history.âMusic Business Worldwide"
