        "text": "By Dee Dee McNeil\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nCAL TJADER – “LIVE AT THE PENTHOUSE 1963 – 1967 – CATCH THE GROOVE” – Jazz Detective\n\n1963 RECORDINGS: Cal Tjader, vibraphone/composer; Clare Fischer, piano; Fred Schreiber, bass; Johnny Rae, drums/timbales; Bill Fitch, conga/percussion. 1965 RECORDINGS: Cal Tjader, vibes: Lonnie Hewitt, piano; Armando Peraza, congas/bongos; Terry Hilliard, bass; Johnny Rae, drums/timbales; 1966 RECORDINGS: Cal Tjader, vibes; Al Zulaica, piano; Monk Montgomery, bass; Carl Burnett, drums/timbales; Armando Peraza, congas/bongos; 1967 RECORDINGS: Cal Tjader, vibes; Al Zulaica, piano; Stan Gilbert, bass; Carl Burnett, drums/timbales; Armando Peraza, congas/bongos.\n\nPrecious recordings turn back time and remind the world of jazz musicians long gone, but not to be forgotten. Their music lives on to remind us of the wonderful legacy they implanted in our lives. Music, still sweet and fragrant, like freshly bloomed gardenias.\n\nThe amazing vibraphone talent of Cal Tjader contributed greatly to the popularity of Latin jazz. Percussion master, Poncho Sanchez played with Cal Tjader from the 1970s until his death in 1982. Eddie Palmieri was a colleague of Cal’s in the 1960s, and his comments are included in a delightful book that accompanies this album. You will also read remarks and memories from Clare Fischer’s son, Brent Fischer, drummer Carl Burnett and remembrances from three vibraphone icons, Gary Burton, Terry Gibbs, and Joe Locke. This release is a package of brilliance that sparkles from the first strains of “Take the ‘A; Train,” a familiar tune that open this two-disc treat. It was recorded on February 2, 1963, at the famed jazz club in Seattle, The Penthouse. Thanks to the diligence of Zev Feldman, several iconic albums from the past have been released using tapes discovered in the Penthouse radio show archives. They follow this energetic opening tune with “In Your Own Sweet Way” (a Brubeck composition), also presented with excitement and energy. When they finally settle down, it’s on the standard, “It Never Entered My Mind” that is arranged as a ballad and played with sensitivity and charm. Tjader’s love for Latin music is tangible during the arrangement of “Morning of the Carnival” and the composition, “Insight.” In the next breath, the music swings on tunes like “Sunset Boulevard” with Lonnie Hewitt on piano joined by Terry Hilliard on bass. Cal keeps Johnny Rae on the drums and Armando Peraza becomes the new percussionist on these dates. Although the band members play musical chairs, Tjader is the power force propelling this music forward in an unforgettable way. When Cal Tjader plays “Here’s That Rainy” day, he melts my heart with his emotional rendering of this tune. Both of Tjader’s original compositions “Davito” and “Leyte” are arranged with Latin inspiration. In 1966, the band changed again. This time Tjader brings to the bandstand, Monk Montgomery on bass, along with the dynamic Carl Burnett on drums. They play one of my favorite Milt Jackson tunes, “Bags’ Groove” with all the ‘swing’ and reverence that makes this song timeless.\n\nNo matter the personnel, this double-set recording brings joy and authenticity to America’s great artform of jazz. These master musicians will entertain you, from straight-ahead arrangements, to Latin music, shuffles, blues and ‘swing,’ all played with the same precision and dedication that great jazz always inspires. Cal Tjader is one of our unsung heroes of the jazz vibraphone. Here are some of the comments and opinions about Cal Tjader by some of our legendary jazz musicians:\n\nEDDIE PALMIERI: “Cal was unique. He was able to play the most complicated rhythmical patterns in the world. Those rhythmical scales began in the continent of Africa and were later crystallized in the island of Cuba. That’s what we were playing when Cal came in and he was able to comprehend these extremely complex rhythmic patterns. Of course, he was also a drummer. On the vibes, he did a tremendous job. We recorded on of his ballads, a bossa nova, “Samba do Suenho” which I play now constantly because it’s one of the most beautiful Bossa Novas I ever heard in my life.”\n\nCARL BURNETT: “Cal Tjader was a friendly guy, easy to get along with. Everybody liked him, both because of his attitude and for his great musical abilities. He was a wonderful guy, a pleasant person to be around. He not only loved playing Latin music, which was really his heart, he loved playing music, period! … I first heard Cal Tjader in ’59 or so, after I got out of high school. At that time, Latin jazz was growing in popularity. Some friends of mine and I had a band: Roy Ayers, Henry Franklin, and others. We were high school friends. … Cal Tjader was someone I listened to because we were playing Latin Jazz around LA. I was playing vibraphone, timbales, and drums. … Cal loved to play drums. When I first joined him, the band was Cal, Armando Peraza, Al Zulaica, Monk Montgomery and me. A wonderful band. …Because I was able to play vibes and Cal loved to play drums, we would switch off occasionally.”\n\nBRENT FISCHER: “I have many great childhood memories of Cal and my father (Dr. Clare Fischer) hanging out, telling jokes, discussing music and of course, performing and recording together. … When I learned vibraphone, as part of my percussion degree at California State University Northridge here in Los Angeles, my having studied close-up what Cal did gave me the inspiration to progress quickly on this grand instrument. …It took me time as a young musician playing with my father’s group to reach the point where dad and I could be inside each other’s heads and anticipate what the other was going to do next. Cal Tjader and Clare Fischer had that together from the first gig.”\n\nTERRY GIBBS: “I met Cal Tjader in around 1947. I was playing in San Francisco with buddy Rich and Cal came into the club and told me that he was playing drums in a trio with a piano player called Dave Brubeck, who was completely unknown at the time and that he was fooling with the vibes. He said, ‘I sure would love it if you would give me a lesson or two.’ I was only a year older than Cal, but I had much more experience. I’d been a classically trained xylophone player and I had been playing vibes professionally for a while back then. What we did was, we went over to the club after-hours. I had a key. I showed him my short mallets that I prefer. Eventually, he had his own mallets made. They were short because when you play with a long mallet that mallet is going up your sleeve and everything else. … Cal really was one of the best jazz vibe players. And the wildest thing is, this was told to me by Tito Puente, who was my close friend. He said that Cal Tjader, for not being a Latin, was as good as any Latin band leader. … That was a big compliment.”\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTHE DAVE STRYKER TRIO WITH BOB MINTZER – “GROOVE STREET” – Strikezone Records\n\nDave Striker, guitar/composer; Bob Mintzer, tenor saxophone/composer; Jared Gold, organ/composer; McClenty Hunter, drums.\n\nWhen I see Dave Stryker’s name, I know that I’m in for an album that swings hard and upholds the legacy of jazz organ and guitar. This time Stryker has added the talents of Bob Mintzer on tenor saxophone to his trio. Sometimes the very best music is made when it’s on-the-spot and unrehearsed. Although Mintzer had guested with the trio on a few tours, they had never played this current song list together. The musicians arrived at the studio expectant and energized.\n\nThey open with Dave Stryker’s classic jazz shuffle and the title tune, “Groove Street.” It’s a swinging number that lets the musicians introduce themselves to the audience with individual solos. Even though the music was new to the ensemble, most of these songs were recorded on the first take. That’s what seasoned professionals and A-team musicians can do. They bounce off of each other, read and improvise what’s on paper, but even more importantly, they reflect the beauty of musical communication and camaraderie. I hear that brotherly love in these songs.\n\nBob brought a couple of originals to the session. Track #2 is Mintzer’s original called “Overlap” with a melody that dances over the organ changes as Mintzer and Striker play it in unison. I enjoyed their ‘cover’ of the Eddie Harris hit song, “Cold Duck Time,” as well as the way they put their groove into “The More I See You,” shuffling the tune into place. I spent many a night in the Southern California Valley Club of Jimmy & Lola Smith, listening to Jimmy grind out groove after groove of spectacular jazz on his organ. I am thankful that Stryker and his trio, (McClenty Hunter on drums and Jared Gold on organ), are keeping the jazz organ and guitar tradition alive and well.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCIARA MOSER – “BLIND SO WHAT” – Independent Label\n\nCiara Moser, bass/producer/composer/arranger/spoken word; Aditi Malhotra & Nishant Shekar, lead vocals; Lumanyano Mzi, drums/ assistant producer/electronic design/backing vocals & spoken voice; Juan Sebastian Sanchez & George Lernis, percussion; Warren Pettey, keyboard/producer; Stephanie Weninger & Anastassiya Petrova, piano/keyboard; Amaury Cabral, Liam Garcia & Isaac Romagosa, guitar; Salim Charvet, alto saxophone; Shahar Amdor & Lihi Haruvi, soprano saxophone; Masa Vujadinovic & Nishant Shakar, backing vocals; Shivaraj Natraj, backing vocals/beat boxing.\n\nI am drawn to this artist as soon as I hear the voice of Nishant Shekar, lead-singing Ciara’s original composition. Shekar’s voice is so pure, honest, and emotional. The lyrics are clear and the story of living life, putting trust in others is a universal lesson, not confined to just the blind community. When a bass solo steps into the spotlight, I snatch the CD cover up from my office desk. Who is that playing the bass? It’s Ciara Moser. The artist is a brilliant bassist, producer, songwriter, and arranger. Moser’s bass solo is masterful, and Ciara’s songwriting floats fresh across my listening apace. Her music is a lovely combination of smooth jazz and the traditional, historic jazz of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. I hear it when the lead vocalist sings scats to Ciara arrangements. These lead vocals sound nothing like either of these legendary divas, still, I can hear the roots of jazz pushing upwards, blending traditional jazz with Ciara Moser’s modern jazz genre.\n\nMoser’s debut album also presents a package of fusion jazz intended to raise awareness for the blind community. She’s making her unique artistic contribution to the music world in a very transformative way. Her songs reflect the various perceptions that blind people have of the world. They inform us, while at the same time, introducing the listening audience to a very talented female musician.\n\nDuring her time pursuing a master’s degree at the Berklee Global Jazz Institute, Ciara made up her mind to include social consciousness in her music, as well as focusing on her journey as a blind musician. However, like the title of this album, “Blind, So What,” she is unapologetic and tenacious in her own abilities and talent. Although Ciara Moser wants to raise awareness about the blind community, I am listening to an artist who shares her heart with us and who plays her bass instrument with talent and power.\n\nThe second track is called “I Trust” and speaks of how unsighted people trust friends and family to help them navigate through a sighted world. On a tune she calls, “Memory” Aditi Malhotra uses the art of performing percussion with her voice, inspired by South Indian Carnatic music and perhaps reflecting a bit of the late great Al Jarreau.\n\nMemorizing is crucial to a blind person; Ciara reminds us in her liner notes. It takes discipline and determination, concentration, and energy to not only recall melodies, chords, and lyrics, but directions, physical placement of belongings, the simple task of walking, cooking, cleaning, or just living life. Ciara Moser says she has internalized music and uses it, like a language or a code.\n\nEvery musician is aware of how important it is to communicate with their listening audience. Moser’s accompanying musicians present a supportive and sensitive addition to interpreting her original music. On “Traveling” we hear the tenacious drums of Lumanyano Mzi, who also lends his talents as assistant producer, electronic design specialist, backing vocals and spoken word. Stephanie Weninger shines on piano and keyboard. The alto saxophone of Salim Charvet is a haunting prayer atop this original music with Middle Eastern overtones. Her eleventh song really drew me in, like the open doors of a cathedral or a prayer rug beckoning my subservience. The final tune, “The Lady With A Green Cane” features Ciara Moser’s spoken word, gliding above the rhythm section offering us prose to ponder.\n\nHere is an artist who is developing her own style, while employing a fusion funk groove. This CD makes me thankful that young people are taking up the shield and fighting for jazz relevance, while expanding the artform like a rainbow over universal musical horizons.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nRAY GALLON, RON CARTER, LEWIS NASH – “GRAND COMPANY” – Cellar 20 Music Group\n\nRay Gallon, piano/composer; Ron Carter, bass; Lewis Nash, drums.\n\nThe crisp, clean sound of a great jazz trio can inspire and entertain like no other. Pianist, Ray Gallon has joined talents with the legendary Ron Carter on bass and the sensationally gifted Lewis Nash on drums. This piano master brings spark and fire to his current trio project as a bandleader. Gallon is also an impressive composer. On his tune, “Acting Up,” I hear a great deal of Thelonious Monk influence in the melodies he plays, as his fingers race across the piano.\n\nAfter this swiftly moving, up-tempo presentation, Gallon settles down to play another original titled, “Zombette,” as a ballad. The trio is a dream-come-true for the piano connoisseur.\n\n“Both Ron and Lewis played significant roles in my musical development, particularly during formative years. Recording a trio album with these two remarkable artists has been at the top of my bucket list, ever since doing it at Rudy Van Gelder’s on that hallowed Steinway B, was icing on the cake. The date was smooth sailing, with everything recorded in one or two takes,” recalls Gallon in his press package.\n\nAnother original composition he calls “Two Track Mind” is a blues and you can never lose with the blues. I enjoyed his take on the Miles Davis standard, “Nardis.” Once again, I hear quite a bit of Monk in Gallon’s approach and interpretations. His arrangement of “If I Had You” painted the familiar tune with fresh colors and gave Ron Carter a bright spotlight during his bass solo. Lewis Nash stepped out of his shuffle to tap-dance a solo on his trap drums. All in all, Ray Gallon is a jazz pianist and composer that is splashing his way onto the music scene and making big waves.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nLES McCANN – “NEVER A DULL MOMENT! – LIVE FROM COAST TO COAST – 1966 – 1967” – Resonance Records\n\nLes McCann, piano/composer; Stan Gilbert, LeRoy Vinegar & Victor Gaskin, bass; Paul Humprey, Frank Severino & Tony Bazley drums.\n\nLes McCann knows how to put the blues into everything he plays and has a natural ability to pump funk, gospel, and energy into music that is uniquely his. McCann both entertains and inspires his audiences. That’s why I was so excited to receive this newly released Les McCann album on the Resonance record label titled, “Never a Dull Moment!” It’s a three-disc CD set, with the first disc featuring my old friend Stan Gilbert (R.I.P.) on bass, recorded in January of 1966, with the dynamic percussionist, Paul Humphrey playing drums.\n\n“When my manager, Alan Abrahams, told me that there were some recently uncovered recordings from the 60s that have never been released before, I was really curious if they were any good. People were always sending me cassettes that they have come across over the years and the sound was usually shit. When I was informed that these live recordings were from the Penthouse in Seattle (a cool venue) and also from the Village Vanguard in New York (another really cool venue), I held my breath. Then I heard them, and I said, damn!” exclaimed Les McCann.\n\nA distinctive pianist, exceptional singer, composer and bandleader, Les McCann was born September 23, 1935, in Lexington, Kentucky. His dad loved jazz and his mother was said to hum opera songs around their house. As a youth, McCann played tuba and drums, performing in his school marching band. He picked up piano with an uncanny, natural ability to play the eighty-eight keys without much study or piano education. It seemed to come natural to him. Les, along with his siblings, attended church regularly. You can clearly hear the gospel influence in his playing. He has the ability to merge gospel, soul, funk, and world rhythms into his arrangements. A master of both upright, grand and electric piano, clavinet, synthesizer and, I must remind you that Les has a beautiful voice. He was one of the first to add electric instruments to his concerts. This came before electronic jazz was popular. I would say, Les McCann helped to make electronic jazz acceptable.\n\nHowever, on this early performance, McCann and his group are all acoustic. Recorded ‘live’ at the Penthouse in Seattle, his recent release opens with a Dizzy Gillespie composition, “Blues ‘n’ Boogie” that sets the mood for the Les McCann genius, style, and piano technique to introduce himself to concertgoers. McCann has a formidable style. Once you hear Les McCann, you won’t forget him. The second song on this exciting release is “Could Be,” a Les composition, originally recorded with Gerald Wilson’s Orchestra. The third cut is a Monty Alexander tune called, “The Grabber.” It swings hard at an up-tempo pace with lots of staccato notes dancing beneath Les McCann’s fingertips.\n\nYou may not know this, but some years back, it was Les McCann who brought Monty Alexander from Kingston, Jamaica to the United States, introducing him to the world on an LP titled, “Les McCann Introduces Alexander the Great.” Humphrey shines like a meteor shower during his drum solo. The next piece is a song he calls “Yours is My Heart Alone.” It’s a beautiful ballad, where his left-hand trembles against the mid-register, while his right hand tenderly plays the melody. I am stunned when he reaches inside the grand piano to caress the strings, strumming them as he pulls surprising music out while using this technique. It’s as though he’s playing a harp.\n\n“The Shampoo” was one of the Les McCann big hit records back-in-the-day. It still sounds like a hit, incorporating a drum lick that comes close to being a tambourine player. This song takes you to church and to the juke joint, all in the matter of five and a half minutes. Stan Gilbert steps into the spotlight briefly to show off his double bass skills. I used to work often with Gilbert in my trio, and he always knew how to padlock the groove into place. Between him and the groove master himself, Les McCann, this tune will make you want to walk the room and wave a white hanky.\n\nThe Baptist church continues to inspire McCann’s arrangements, holding hands with the blues on “Wait for it,” another McCann original. They close with Steve Allen’s standard tune, “This Could Be the Start of Something Big.” It’s arranged at a thrilling pace, with Humphrey’s drumsticks sounding like machine guns firing rounds. This is just the first of three discs in this wonderful package of music. There’s not one bad tune on this complete “live” recording. You will feel as though you are seated in the front row center section at this concert. This CD is a historic treasure and will add entertainment and value to any album collection.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nSARAH McKENZIE – “WITHOUT YOU” – Normandy Lane Music\n\nSarah McKenzie, vocals/piano/composer; Romero Lubambo, guitar; Peter Erskine, drums; Geoff Gascoyne, bass; Rogerio Boccato, percussion; Jaques Morelenbaum, cello; Bob Sheppard, flute/saxophone.\n\nAn Australian vocalist, currently based in Los Angeles, brings her warm voice and piano excellence to interpret music by the legendary Carlos Jobim. She also offers us her composing skills and woos us with her original and well-written songs. I am happy to hear a voice that is not nasal and that makes me believe the lyrics. Sarah McKenzie, with her pitch-perfect tone, offers familiar tunes like Gentle Rain, Corcovado and Wave in her own comfortable and lovely way. She took piano lessons from age five. At fifteen, she heard Oscar Peterson’s Night Train record and knew that she wanted to play jazz like that for the rest of her life. She also admires Gene Harris, Ahmad Jamal, Nat King Cole, Harry Connick Jr., Shirley Horn, and Blossom Dearie. In 2012, Sarah McKenzie arrived in America to attend Berklee School of Music. She has spent time working in Paris, in London and played at the Montreux Jazz Festival while signed to the Impulse label. I am impressed with her original tune, “Quoi. Quoi, Quoi.” Sarah collaborates with her guitarist, Romero Lubambo, adding lovely lyrics to his song titled, “Without You.” Her voice is perfect for the Portuguese songs she sings on this current project. Her simplicity of style and occasional scat vocals colorfully decorate some of McKenzie’s arrangements. She illuminates her talents without over-the-top vocal gymnastics and offers a sense of honesty that sells these songs.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWES MONTGOMERY/WYNTON KELLY TRIO – MAXIMUM SWING – THE UNISSUED 1965 HALF NOTE RECORDINGS” – Resonance Records\n\nWes Montgomery, guitar; Wynton Kelly, piano; Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Larry Ridley & Herman Wright, bass; Jimmy Cobb, drums.\n\nBe still my heart! When I opened my mail and saw that a never-before released album of music featuring Wes Montgomery, Wynton Kelly and Jimmy Cobb lay trembling in my palms, I was full of anticipation! It did not disappoint. I felt as though I was sitting in New York’s Half Note Club, sipping cocktails with friends in 1965. The greater part of this incredible music was aired on a radio broadcast hosted by Alan Grant for his WABC-FM radio show, “Portraits in Jazz.” Now, it’s a priceless collectors album.\n\nRon Carter clearly recalls the night he subbed for Paul Chambers to join this iconic trio.\n\n“I remember there were no music stands and I was trying to figure how to hold the music up for the songs I didn’t know. Still, it felt good to walk into a situation with the great Jimmy Cobb, the fabulous Wynton Kelly and this smashing guitar player Wes Montgomery. …but to walk into that meeting place with all those guys and perform with them live onstage was astonishing for me. There were other guys they could have called for this sub gig, but I got chosen. No one in the band complained,” Carter proudly shared in the press package.\n\nYou’ll find some of the most energized, exciting, and inspired samples of the Wes Montgomery genius on guitar during this performance. His freedom and joy bounces off my CD player and plants a huge smile across my face.\n\nAs one of the masters of the guitar, Wes Montgomery has inspired a number of today’s jazz guitar legends like George Benson, Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Lee Ritenour, Emily Remler, John Scofield and Pat Metheny. Metheny credited the Smokin’ at the Half Note release in 1965 on the Verve label to be an album that “taught me how to play.”\n\nOf course, pairing with the iconic Wynton Kelly on piano just propels the music to the highest standard possible. The way they interact and complement each other is both entertaining and impressive. Needless to say that Jimmy Cobb, on drums, is the cherry on top of a rich, delicious musical sundae.\n\nOn Disc 2 you’ll enjoy a dynamic solo by Jimmy Cobb, during their up-tempo arrangement of “All The Things You Are.” Next, the trio swings hard on the standard jazz tune, “I Remember you.” In fact, there isn’t one bad song on this two-set disc. This trio presents pure and historic pleasure at “Maximum Swing.”\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nBILL EVANS – “TALES – LIVE IN COPENHAGEN (1964)” – Elemental Music\n\nBill Evans, piano/composer; Chuck Israels & Eddie Gomez, bass; Larry Bunker & Marty Morell, drums.\n\nIt was the very first European tour for Bill Evans, and he had to be excited. Bill and his trio arrived in Copenhagen, Denmark to perform on August 10th and 25th of 1964. The concert was recorded by the Evans bassist at that time, Chuck Israels. One recording happened at the Danish radio’s Radiohuset Studio. The other was recorded in front of a ‘live’ audience. What a find for Zev Feldman, fondly known as the Jazz Detective. These are never before heard of tapes. Historically, they are the earliest known European recordings by Bill Evans. Israels fondly recalls that European tour with Bill Evans.\n\n“The thinking when I started with Bill was, you can play quarter notes, you can play half notes. You can play dotted quarters and quarter-note triplets, and you can play anything that fits the pulse and makes a good counterpoint with the melody. You can make it all feel rhythmically propulsive and swinging. So why be restricted when music really doesn’t need to be that restricted? … I didn’t feel restricted at all. I was just so glad to be part of Bill’s musical design, the texture of how that trio worked, how Bill planned the music; how he set it up so that you could fit yourself in with personal expression and freedom to find nuances and details that occurred to you. Bill would leave room for that to happen,” Chuck Israels remembered.\n\nThey open with the Evans jazz standard, “Waltz for Debbie.” This is followed by a tender and emotional rendition of “My Foolish Heart.” Track #4 swings hard as they interpret ”Sweet & Lovely.” Bill Evans opens “I Never Knew What Time it Was” with a rubato solo for the first two verses of the song. Then Israels and Bunker join in, putting the swing in place.\n\nBassist, Chuck Israels replaced Scott LaFaro after his sudden death in a car accident. The new bass player was still settling in with the trio, sounding similar to Scotty, but very much bringing his own bass style. The three musicians work in harmony like a well-oiled machine. My heart melts when I hear them play “My Foolish Heart” again on track #7. It’s totally fresh, pensive, and uniquely different from their former recording of this beautiful composition. In fact, you get to hear four of the first five songs as “take #2’s” during this awesome listening experience. The tempos change and the moods differ, refreshing the songs and making them sound brand new.\n\nThere is an accompanying book with this album, containing interviews with former musicians and historic photographs. However, the most compelling piece of this album is the elegant, august, gorgeous music performed by Bill Evans and his trio.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTHE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET “LIVE FROM THE NORTHWEST, 1959” – Brubeck Editions\n\nDave Brubeck, piano; Paul Desmond, alto saxophone; Eugene Wright, bass; Joe Morello, drums.\n\nIt was April of 1959. Wally Heider, the legendary sound engineer, had just packed up his Ampex 350-2 tape recorder, packed it into his station wagon, then put the pedal to the metal on his way to Portland, Oregon. Brubeck’s Quartet was appearing at the historic Multnomah Hotel in Portland and the next night at Clark College. That was where this “Live from the Northwest, 1959” album was created.\n\nThe Dave Brubeck Quartet opens this amazing and historic recording with “When the Saints Go Marching in.” The quartet swings right out the gate, propelled by Joe Morello’s drums and featuring Paul Desmond with that warm alto saxophone sound. Once Desmond completes his solo, Dave Brubeck’s solid trio soaks up the spotlight like three sponges in a bathtub full of champagne. The pumping bass of Eugene Wright (fondly called “the Senator”) locks step with Morello’s drum licks and they provide a platform for Brubeck’s piano to dance. This recording was made just months before their album “Time Out” made the world stop, listen, and take note.\n\nThe talent and skills of these four musicians remain a heated topic of conversation. Some say it was their contrapuntal abilities that wooed crowds across the planet. They did it with such ease, even though it was happening spontaneously. You hear it prominently in their arrangement of “Basin Street Blues.”\n\nDave Brubeck’s Quartet flies through “Gone with the Wind” at a surprising pace, swinging harder than a George Foreman punch. Brubeck has recorded two original songs. One is the “Multnomah Blues” and the blues speaks for itself. The other is called “Two Part Contention,” attacked with Brubeck’s two-fisted piano brilliance. Here is music that is over sixty years old and still sounds vibrant and fresh. This is a surprise addition to Dave Brubeck’s amazing discography and a pleasant piece of ear candy for the public’s consumption.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTags: Bill Evans, Cal Tjader, Ciara Moser, Dave Brubeck Quartet, Dave Stryker, jazz cd reviews, Les McCann, Ray Gallon, Sarah McKenzie, Wes Montgomery & Wynton Kelly"
