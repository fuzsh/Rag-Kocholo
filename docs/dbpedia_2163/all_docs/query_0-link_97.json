        "text": "Justin Timberlake’s Ex-Manager Johnny Wright Tells Janet Jackson She Needs To Forgive Him\n\nJustin Timberlake’s manager is urging Janet Jackson to forgive him over their Super Bowl ordeal.\n\nThe singers’ issue dates back to 2004 when Justin Timberlake ripped off a part of Janet Jackson’s top, exposing her breast during their halftime performance.\n\nWhile Justin Timberlake went on to perform in the 2018 Super Bowl solo, Janet Jackson was rumored to be blackballed, which the NFL previously denied.\n\nJanet Jackson recently shared a quote about forgiveness that reads,\n\n“Always choose to heal, not to hurt. To forgive, not to despise. To persevere, not to quit. To smile, not to frown. And to love, not to hate.”\n\nJustin Timberlake’s former manager Johnny Wright wrote:\n\n“You should take this advice and apply it to your relationship with Justin.”\n\nThe comment has since been deleted.\n\nAn insider told Page Six Justin Timberlake didn’t know his manager posted the comment.\n\n“Justin was not aware of his comment to her. Johnny did this all on his own.”\n\nJustin Timberlake apologized to Janet Jackson in February."
