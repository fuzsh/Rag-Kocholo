BUT, how many times do we have to keep pointing out that it was not Janet's choice to release RWU as the second single. This was even confirmed byRodney Jerkins. He specifically said Janet wanted Luv to be the second single and it was supposed to be the second single but the label decided not to support it. Rodney went on the say that the label just through Luv to urban but didnt support it at all.\n\nPost by Mike Tuinstra on\n\nWell.. what to say about last era? it came to prove us Janet no longer cares about her carreer, and probably just keeps recording music because she cares about US (not enough to perform in Japan, though, LOL).. it came to prove that she doesn't handle all the bad stuff that happens\n\nBut i have to praise her that she came with great music even not being directly involved with the writing, production.. if she at least chose the songs, she chose well.. cause Discipline is a great album like almost all of the others..\n\nThere were plenty of songs i didn't get tired of listening to (and still don't).. like feedback, luv, rollercoaster (MAN THAT ONE I LOVED SO MUCH), rock with u, 2nite, curtains, what's ur name... basically i loved almost everything..\n\nThe music videos were.. hmmm feedback was stupid cause she can't do a video like that when she knows people ain't ready to welcome her.. rock with u was GREAT but.. why the f**k did she release that song when she coulda released Luv? 2nite?\n\nThe tour was awesome... i loved it.. maybe her best tour after TVR.. i just didn't like that it looked like a giant medley.. but still it was great.. i also HATED all the mishandling and all the chances she gave the h.a.t.e.r.s (aka delusional madonna fans) to talk she wasn't selling tickets and so on..\n\nBut overall it was better than the 20Y.O. era, musically better than the Damita Jo era... but lacked the will to promote, which she had during the DJ era\n\nThis is a very random question but does anyone know what the writing on Janet's shirt in the \"Pleasure Principle\" video means?\n\n1987 something LOL\n\n20 Y.O. beats them all.

New decade, new round.\n\nAbsolutely not. 20 Y.O is a great album, but it is most definitely not better than DJ or AFY. Damita Jo was one of her strongest, most eclectic efforts. She really found the right balance between Pop & R&B, whilst having single worthy songs, as well as album tracks that seamlessly blended into one another to create a whole ALBUM, not just a few singles and filler.\n\nDamita Jo was actually critically acclaimed as well before the sales figures came in and dissing Janet became cool. With this said, 20 Y.O and Discipline, although not up to her previous flawless standards, are still better than almost every single pop/r&b album her contemporaries are releasing. It was certainly much better than Usher and Mariahs latest efforts which were mentioned earlier.\n\nPost by cyrax on\n\nDJ was one of Janet's strongest albums that's why it was able to go platinum even with all of the negative press surrounding her. Discipline is just weak and the only songs that I even still listen to are Feedback.\n\nIf only quality and sales would go hand-in-hand.\n\nDJ went Platinum because it had very strong initial hype that was reflected in the opening sales, had 2 songs charting in the top 50 and I believe there was more promo for it.\n\n\"Feedback\" was the only song to be heard by the general public from Discipline, it wasn't a huge airplay hit, the other singles were totally ignored and of course sales were much higher in 2004 than in 2008. Most people didn't even hear enough from Discipline to decide about its quality.\n\nThe overall quality of an album has little to do with its sales. There are dozens of huge selling albums that had like 4 strong songs released as singles and the rest was pure filler...\n\nPost by Adonis the DemiGod! on\n\n@cyrax said:\n\nDJ was one of Janet's strongest albums that's why it was able to go platinum even with all of the negative press surrounding her.

I want You got to #65 and JALW went to #45.\n\nIn any case I am glad Janet has another album coming out in September 2009 and a new website going up. Hopefully it's more WEB 2.5-ish..."
