        "text": "With plenty of heart and soul, singer/actress Virginia Capers served up loads of music in an entertainment career that spanned several decades. The benevolent, plus-sized talent was born Eliza Virginia Capers on September 22, 1925, in South Carolina and attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., before studying voice at Juilliard in Manhattan.\n\nShe began her career on the Yiddish stage in 1950. By happenstance, Virginia was introduced to band leader Abe Lyman who hired her for his radio program and for on-the-road tours. In the late 50s, she had made it to all the way to Broadway with productions of \"Jamaica\" (1957) and then \"Saratoga\" (1959) albeit in chorus/understudy roles. Playing older than she was, the 34-year-old went on to take over the role of Grandma Obeah in the \"Jamaica\" production.\n\nMoving to TV and occasional film roles into the 1960's, Virginia found work on such TV programs as \"Have Gun, Will Travel,\" \"General Electric Theatre,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"Daniel Boone,\" \"Death Valley Days,\" \"Judd for the Defense,\" \"My Three Sons,\" \"Marcus Welby,\" \"Bracken's World,\" \"Longstreet,\" \"The Rookies,\" \"Mannix\" and a recurring role on Julia (1968). Infrequent movie work included minor roles in Revolte in Block A (1962), Ritt zum Galgenbaum (1967), Es führt kein Weg zurück (1969), Norwood (1970), Die große, weiße Hoffnung (1970), Big Jake (1971), Trouble Man (1972) and as Billie Holiday's mother in Lady Sings the Blues (1972) starring Diana Ross as the tragic jazz singer.\n\nThe singer reached the apex of her career on Broadway in 1974. Handed the role of her career as matriarch Lena Younger in \"Raisin,\" the musical stage version of Lorraine Hansberry's classic drama \"Raisin in the Sun,\" Virginia copped the Tony Award for \"lead actress\" and was given the honor to perform the part later in a straight dramatic version.\n\nWith this success, Virginia worked diligently in its aftermath to fight off rigid Hollywood stereotypes and, on occasion, played judges, nurses and other professional types. Just the same, she still found herself all too often typecast as poor, husband-less mothers or proud domestic help. Nevertheless, her nationwide recognition led to plentiful work on such TV dramas as \"The Waltons,\" \"Quincy,\" \"Dynasty,\" \"Highway to Heaven,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"St. Elsewhere,\" \"Knot's Landing,\" \"Party of Five,\" ER\" and a recurring role on Downtown (1986), as well as the TV comedies \"Mork & Mindy,\" \"227,\" \"The Golden Girls,\" \"Evening Shade,\" \"Married...with Children,\" and recurring roles on both Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990) and Allein unter Nachbarn (1998).\n\nOn the film front, Virginia had latter roles in the film Der Spielgefährte (1982), Ferris macht blau (1986) (as Nurse Sparrow), Howard - Ein tierischer Held (1986), Final Night - Die letzte Nacht (1987), Pacific Palisades (1990), Eine Familie namens Beethoven (1993), Dependent (1994) and Bad City Blues (1999).\n\nHaving long made her move from New York to Hollywood, Virginia went on to found in 1984 the Lafayette Players West, a performing arts repertory troupe that provided stage work for (primarily) black actors. She also received the National Black Theatre Festival Living Legend Award, the Paul Robeson Pioneer Award and the NAACP's Image Award for theatre excellence. The unmarried actress died complications from pneumonia on May 6, 2004. She was 78 and survived by a son and brother. At the time of her death, Virginia was in rehearsal for a tribute to Oscar-nominated character actress Juanita Moore.\n\nDonald Frank Cheadle was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on November 29, 1964. His childhood found him moving from city to city with his family: mother Bettye (née North), a teacher; father Donald Frank Cheadle Sr., a clinical psychologist; sister Cindy; and brother Colin. After graduating from high school in Denver, Colorado, Cheadle attended and graduated from the California Institute of the Arts with a bachelor¹s degree in fine arts. Encouraged by his college friends, he attended a variety of auditions and landed a recurring role on the hit series Fame - Der Weg zum Ruhm (1982), which led to feature film roles in Dennis Hopper's Colors - Farben der Gewalt (1988) and John Irvin's Hamburger Hill (1987).\n\nEarly in his career, Cheadle was named Best Supporting Actor by the Los Angeles Film Critics for his breakout performance opposite Denzel Washington in Teufel in Blau (1995). His subsequent film credits include Traitor (2008), an international thriller that he produced, starring opposite Guy Pearce; Kasi Lemmons's Talk to Me (2007), with Chiwetel Ejiofor; the 2006 Oscar-winning Best Picture, L.A. Crash (2004), which Cheadle also produced; Hotel Ruanda (2004), for which his performance garnered Oscar, Golden Globe, Broadcast Film Critics and Screen Actors Guild award nominations for Best Actor; Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's 13 (2007), starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney; Mike Binder's Die Liebe in mir (2007) with Adam Sandler; the Academy Award-winning Traffic - Macht des Kartells (2000) and Out of Sight (1998), with George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, both films also directed by Soderbergh; Paul Thomas Anderson's acclaimed Boogie Nights (1997) with Julianne Moore and Mark Wahlberg; Bulworth (1998), directed by and starring Warren Beatty; Passwort: Swordfish (2001), with John Travolta and Halle Berry; Mission to Mars (2000) with Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise; John Singleton's Rosewood Burning (1997), for which Cheadle earned an NAACP Image Award nomination; Brett Ratner's Family Man (2000), starring Nicolas Cage; and the independent features Manic (2001) and Things Behind the Sun (2001).\n\nCheadle was honored by the CineVegas Film Festival and the Los Angeles Film Festival and received ShoWest's Male Star of the Year award. He is also well-recognized for his television work, including his portrayal of Sammy Davis Jr. in HBO's Frank, Dean und Sammy tun es (1998), for which he received a Golden Globe Award and a Best Supporting Actor Emmy nomination. That same year, he also received an Emmy nomination for his starring role in HBO's adaptation of the best-selling novel A Lesson Before Dying - Nachhilfestunden in der Todeszelle (1999), opposite Cicely Tyson and Mekhi Phifer.\n\nHe also starred for HBO in Eriq La Salle's Rebound: The Legend of Earl 'The Goat' Manigault (1996). Cheadle's TV series credits include his two-year stint in David E. Kelley's acclaimed series Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992), a guest-starring role on Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994) (earning yet another Emmy nomination) and a regular role on Golden Palace (1992) He also starred in the live television broadcast of Fail Safe (2000) opposite George Clooney, James Cromwell, Brian Dennehy, Richard Dreyfuss, and Harvey Keitel. He also co-executive produced the TV version of L.A. Crash (2008).\n\nHis most recent big-screen appearances have been in Antoine Fuqua's ensemble crime thriller Gesetz der Strasse - Brooklyn's Finest (2009) and Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), another mainstream breakthrough where he played Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, replacing Terrence Howard from the first film. The Guard - Ein Ire sieht schwarz (2011), an art-house hit directed by John Michael McDonagh and co-starring Brendan Gleeson, followed.\n\nCheadle stars in House of Lies (2012) on Showtime. Late in 2012, he was seen in Flight (2012), Robert Zemeckis's return to live-action filmmaking. In 2013, he reprised his role as Rhodey in Iron Man 3 (2013). Among his projects in development is a movie based on the life of jazz legend Miles Davis.\n\nA talented musician who plays saxophone, writes music and sings, he is also an accomplished stage actor and director and was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Spoken Word Album for his narration/dramatization of the Walter Mosley novel 'Fear Itself.'\n\nOther notable off-stage achievements include the 2007 BET Humanitarian Award for the cause of the people of Darfur and Rwanda, and sharing the Summit Peace Award by the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome with George Clooney for their work in Darfur.\n\nUndoubtedly the woman who had come to epitomize what we recognize today as \"celebrity,\" Zsa Zsa Gabor, is better known for her many marriages, personal appearances, her \"dahlink\" catchphrase, her actions, gossip, and quotations on men, rather than her film career.\n\nZsa Zsa was born as Sári Gabor on February 6, 1917 in Budapest, Hungary, to Jolie Gabor (née Janka Tilleman) and Vilmos Gabor (born Farkas Miklós Grün), both of Jewish descent. Her siblings were Eva Gabor and Magda Gabor. Zsa Zsa studied at a Swiss finishing school, was second runner-up in the fifth Miss Hungary pageant, and began her stage career in Vienna in 1934. In 1941, the year she obtained her first divorce, she followed younger sister Eva to Hollywood.\n\nA radiant, beautiful blonde, Zsa Zsa began to appear on television series and occasional films. Her first film was at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Männer machen Mode (1952), co-starring Kathryn Grayson and Red Skelton. She next made a comedy called Wir sind gar nicht verheiratet (1952) at 20th Century Fox with Ginger Rogers. It was far from a star billing; she appeared several names down the cast as a supporting actress. But in 1952 she broke into films big time with her starring role opposite José Ferrer in Moulin Rouge (1952), although it has been said that throughout filming, director John Huston gave her a very difficult time.\n\nIn the following years, Zsa Zsa slipped back into supporting roles in films such as Lili (1953) and Im Zirkus der 3 Manegen (1954). Her main period of film work was in the 1950s, with other roles in Death of a Scoundrel (1956), with Yvonne De Carlo, and The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1958) with Anna Neagle; again, these were supporting roles. By the 1960s, Zsa Zsa was appearing more as herself in films. She now appeared to follow her own persona around, and cameo appearances were the order of the day in films such as Pepe - Was kann die Welt schon kosten (1960) and Der Diamantenprinz (1967). This continued throughout the 1970s.\n\nShe was memorable as herself in Die nackte Kanone 2 1/2 (1991), in which she humorously poked fun at a 1989 incident where she was convicted of slapping a police officer (Paul Kramer) during a traffic stop. She spent three days in jail and had to do 120 hours of community service. Such infamous incidents contributed to her becoming one of the most all-time recognizable of Hollywood celebrities, and sometimes ridiculed as a result. She was also memorable to British television viewers on The Ruby Wax Show (1997).\n\nIn 2002, Gabor was reported to be in a coma in a Los Angeles hospital after a horrifying car accident. The 85-year-old star was injured when the car she was traveling in hit a utility pole in West Hollywood, California. The reports about her coma eventually proved to be inaccurate.\n\nZsa Zsa's life, spanning two continents, nine husbands, and 11 decades, came to an end on December 18, 2016, when she died of cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, California. She was 99.\n\nGenial character comedian Bernie Kopell is undoubtedly best known as Dr. Adam Bricker, doling out sage advice on TV's Love Boat (1977) for its entire run of ten seasons and 250 episodes. He once described the experience as \"a paid vacation. We got to be in 98 countries\". While this may have been his longest engagement on a series, his most memorable comic creation remains the iconic Siegfried in Mini-Max oder die unglaublichen Abenteuer des Maxwell Smart (1965).\n\nBernie was born in Brooklyn, of Ukrainian and Jewish ancestry, as Bernard Morton Kopell to Abraham Bernard Kopell (1905-1965) and his wife Pauline (née Taran, 1911-2011). After finishing high school, he studied at New York University, graduating in 1955 with a bachelor of fine arts.\n\nA year later, Bernie was drafted into the U.S. Navy, happily accepting the opportunity to serve as librarian at the Naval Operations Base, the Naval Air Station at Norfolk, Virginia, and (between 1956-57), aboard the World War II battleship U.S.S. Iowa. He later quipped \"I got to read more books than I'd gotten to read at NYU, so it was just a glorious thing for me.\"\n\nBack in New York after demobilization, Bernie was invited to Los Angeles by fellow NYU alumnus James Drury (of Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962) fame). His first agent turned him down for being 'not handsome enough to be a leading man, not ugly enough to be a heavy.' For a while, he earned a crust as a taxi driver and vacuum cleaner salesman. A chance audition for casting director Marilyn Howard (then Marilyn Bodgen) then led to a small part in an early CBS daytime soap, The Brighter Day (1954), as a Cuban bad guy named Pablo. Bernie's aptitude for dialects impressed TV execs to the extent that he found himself typecast as Mexicans or Puerto Ricans in episodes of Make Room for Daddy (1953), Jack-Benny-Show (1950), Mein Onkel vom Mars (1963) and The Flying Nun (1967). Ultimately, his innate ability to bring levity to any scene earned him numerous guest starring turns on sitcoms like McHale's Navy (1962), Hoppla Lucy! (1962), Petticoat Junction (1963), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962), Run Buddy Run (1966) and Green Acres (1965).\n\nAt the age of 33, Bernie got his first big break, cast as KAOS chief Siegfried in Get Smart by executive producer Leonard Stern. This character, replete with leather jacket, neat moustache and Heidelberg duelling scar, was essentially the primary nemesis of Control agents 86 and 99. Bernie, by his own admission, adopted Siegfried's German accent from an Austrian psychiatrist he was visiting at the time. The character became so popular with fans that the actor would often be asked to sign autographs with the catchphrase \"we don't shush at KAOS, Shtarker\". A classic line from the episode 'Rub-a-Dub-Dub... Three Spies in a Sub' has Siegfried explaining to Don Adams \"As you go through the world of espionage Shmart, you will find that there are the good guys and the bad guys. I happen to be one of the bad guys.\"\n\nIn between Get Smart and Love Boat, Bernie alternated dramatic roles with comic ones, appearing in a wide variety of shows, ranging from Wo alle Wege enden (1969) (as a TV executive), Der Nachtjäger (1974) (Dr. Gravanites) and the live-action CBS children's sitcom The Ghost Busters (1975) (as Dr. Frankenstein) to the Mel Brooks spoof of Robin Hood, Robi Robi Robin Hood (1975) (a recurring role as Alan-a-Dale). He appeared in nine episodes of Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964), variously as the ancient Postlethwaite, aka Mr. Apothecary, the hippie warlock Alonzo, psychiatrists Chomsky and Rhinehouse and the Siegfried clone Baron von Fuchs). Bernie also had a co-starring role in a short-lived 1973 sitcom, Mode, Mädchen und Moneten (1973), as a salesman for a ladies' clothing manufacturer in New York. His more recent appearances have included an ill-fated men's room attendant in Monk (2002), a coroner in Charmed: Zauberhafte Hexen (1998), a hayseed in My Name Is Earl (2005), a Holocaust survivor in Hawaii Five-0 (2010) and a senior citizen in the medical sitcom B Positive (2020).\n\nFor the stage, Bernie has appeared in Los Angeles productions of Death of a Salesman, and, as a Russian peddler, in The 49th Cousin. He had a leading role as Lenny Ganz in the Neil Simon farce Rumors at the Whitefire Theatre, Sherman Oaks (1996-97). As late as 2022, he headlined off-Broadway, alongside Hal Linden, as biblical characters Lou and Bud in Ed. Weinberger's comedy play, Two Jews Talking. Seemingly impervious to age, Bernie continues make regular appearances in films and on TV, albeit in smaller supporting roles. He is an avid tennis player and has hosted pro-celebrity tennis and golf tournaments with proceeds benefiting the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nSherman Hemsley played characters known to be wise-cracking, \"Weezy\" loving, boisterous fools which America and the entire world laughed with kindheartedly. Sherman Alexander Hemsley, Air Force veteran and actor, was born on Feb. 1, 1938 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, William Hemsley, worked at a printing press while his mother worked at various factories during the war. As a child, Hemsley was introduced to acting during school where the teachers would ask students to play different characters. The first play he did as a kid in school was about fire prevention and Hemsley played the fire. He eventually ended up dropping out of school and joined the Air Force. During his adolescence he never considered acting as a profession until after he served in the military. Hemsley then moved from south Philadelphia where he had spent most of his life to New York City. He worked graveyard shift as a post office clerk during the night and actor during the day. He considered New York the best place to be as it had several acting workshops and theater companies such as The Negro Ensemble Company (NEC)founded by Robert Hooks which helped actors/actresses obtain roles on theater, television and movies. His former co-star, Roxie Roker, was also part of the NEC alumni. Hemsley made his professional acting debut on the Broadway play, Purlie, and toured with the show for a year. In 1971, while on tour for Purlie, he received a call from producer/creator/writer Norman Lear. Lear wanted Hemsley to audition for a role which was going to be part of his sitcom Es bleibt in der Familie (1971). Due to his commitment to the Purlie project, Hemsley declined the role. Norman Lear said he would have the role open for him and Hemsley joined the cast two years later. Hemsley and co-star, Isabel Sanford were chosen to do a spin off of the show All In The Family called Die Jeffersons (1975). Despite the age difference between Hemsley and Sanford (twenty years apart), many described their on-screen marriage as truly hilarious. Hemsley was nominated for a Golden Globe for his outstanding performance as George Jefferson. The Jeffersons turned out to be a success spanning eleven seasons ending in 1985. After The Jeffersons, Hemsley steadily started working on other projects and in 1986 joined the NBC sitcom Amen (1986) where he played religious deacon Ernest Frye. The show ran for five seasons until 1991. Hemsley then made his debut as a voice actor as part of the ABC live action-puppet series, Die Dinos (1991). Hemsley played Bradley P. Richfield, Earl's cruel boss. The show ran successfully for four seasons. In 1997, the remaining cast of The Jeffersons had a reunion on the Rolonda (1994) talk show, still having the same charm they did decades ago. Isabel Sanford and Sherman Hemsley made television guest appearances together on well-known television programs such as Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990) and were in commercials for The Gap, Old Navy and Denny's. Hemsley and Marla Gibbs guest starred on the TBS show House of Payne (2006) in 2011. Sherman Hemsley will be remembered as an actor who was on shows that addressed serious issues but also one who brought laughter into homes every week.\n\nVanessa Lynne Williams was born on March 18, 1963 in Tarrytown, Greenburgh, New York and raised in Millwood, New Castle, New York to Helen Williams & Milton Williams, both music teachers. Vanessa and her brother grew up in suburban New York in comfortable surroundings. Vanessa sang and danced in school productions and signed her high school yearbook with a promise to \"see you on Broadway\". After winning a performing scholarship to Syracuse University, she left school and tried to make it in New York show business. She began entering beauty contests in 1984, eventually winning Miss New York and then becoming the first African-American Miss America.
