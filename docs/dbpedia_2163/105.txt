Last week it was reported that well-respected manager Johnny Wright offered to meet with Ali Lohan and possibly become her manager. This would have been a huge coup for Ali and possibly led to an actual career where she could be more than just the lead-in to a joke about Dina Lohan. Dina, however, being Dina, completely blew the entire thing for her. She still wanted to keep Aliâs entire manager fee for herself â which leads one to wonder, exactly how she thought Johnny Wright should be compensated.

The whole thing reeked of ego. And though Aliâs camp confirmed that they took a meeting with Wright, his side is now saying that theyâve never met with the Lohans and heâd never consider managing Aliâs career. The response is really terse and itâs clear heâs pissed as hell about something. Iâm guessing Dinaâs ego and the resulting wasting of his time.

FAMED music manager Johnny Wright is not only saying, “Thanks, but no thanks” to Dina Lohan – he slams her and her daughter Ali in a statement to Page Six. Lohan sources said Wright – who steered the Jonas Brothers and Justin Timberlake to the top – offered to manage Ali’s career. At the time, Dina told us via a rep she was interested and would take the meeting. But forget that.

A scathing statement from Wright’s company states: “Johnny Wright would like to set the record straight regarding his involvement with Ali Lohan.

“Johnny Wright has never met with Ali Lohan, has never been introduced to Ali Lohan, nor has he had a meeting with Ali or Dina Lohan regarding Ali’s music career. While he wishes Ali Lohan the best in all her endeavors, Mr. Wright has never had any intention of speaking with Ali Lohan regarding her career. Any story that has surfaced about such a meeting holds no merit and is completely false.

“Wright Entertainment Group has never had any interest or intention of adding Ali Lohan as an artist on the company’s roster, which currently includes Justin Timberlake, Jonas Brothers, Janet Jackson and Ciara amongst others.

That last paragraph implies a lot. Both that Dina is a moron for passing on the opportunity to have Ali managed by someone with such a client roster… and it also is implying that Ali isnât good enough to be a part of Wright management. Which she definitely isnât at this point, but part of being a good manager is cultivating a career. Dina obviously has some experience because she managed Lindsay, but I would think it takes a special kind of talent and experience to successfully brand a younger sister in a way that is unique and separate from the older one.

Though they deny ever taking a meeting with the Lohans, itâs pretty clear that Wright is pissed and insulted â not that I blame him. But really, the joke is on Dina. Sheâs so dumb and full of herself that she has no clue that whatever attention sheâs getting is because people are laughing at her stupidity, not admiring her business savvy like sheâd hoped.
