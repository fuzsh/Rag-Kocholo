Ciara‘s manager Johnny Wright joins producer, Darkchild aka Rodney Jerkins and Yobi.TV on “Take The Stage–” a new online talent show that’s searching for the next big thing. Poor CiCi–even her manager won’t pay attention to her.

Jerkins says the internet has created a new strategic platform for talent to be discovered and allows the people to tell us what they want to hear. So he and Wright are tapping into this market to uncover a superstar. And unlike most talent shows, the contestants don’t have to sing other people’s songs, they get to create their own!

Over a period of 18 weeks, pop hopefuls will compete for the chance to be managed by Wright–who also managed/manages Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and will see them create original material with Jerkin’s stellar production skills.

Well, while Johnny Wright’s busying himself with starting careers of a few unknowns, Ciara’s going to be pushing One Woman Army by herself. How fitting.
