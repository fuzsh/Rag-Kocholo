The Kardashian family is dancing to the beat of its own recording-industry connections.

Family matriarch Kris Jenner, who already serves as her kids' managers and comanages girl group BG5, has formed a joint venture with Wright-Crear Management to turn this talent-grooming side business of hers into a full-time gig, E! News has exclusively confirmed.

But with Kim, Kourtney and Khlo already pretty busy with their various pursuits, who did mom get to help out, while still keeping it all in the family?

"Music is in my blood and this is my dream job," Rob Kardashian tells E! News of his new position handling the venture's day-to-day operations.

"I'm so proud of Rob," added Kris. "I am looking forward to him following his passion. I know Robert Sr. [Rob's dad] would be so proud to see his son in the music business. The BG5 are going to be his first priority."

BG5 is pretty psyched, too, with singer Brooke Adams telling us they're "thrilled to be working with Rob."

"What Kris has done with her own girls, and already with BG5, is insanely impressive and will be applied to other music artists. It is a win-win for both parties," company partner Kenneth Crear told us at the launch party for Ciara's latest album at Hollywood hot spot Drai's.

In addition to Ciara, Crear and Johnny Wright's client roster has included Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and the Backstreet Boys.

"Rob will be signing clients on his own," Crear said. "Kendall may want to get into music, and that could be an option."

Big brother wouldn't say for sure whether his aspiring-model little sis is interested in adding "pop star" to her rsum, but he did promise that there will be "a lot more than the BG5" coming out of the Kardashians' corner.

We don't doubt it.
