Heber City is a city and county seat of Wasatch County, Utah. The population was 16,856 as of the 2020 United States census. The city is located 43 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.

History

Heber City was first settled in 1859 by Robert Broadhead, James Davis, and James Gurr. John W. Witt built the first house in the area. The area was under the direction of Bishop Silas Smith, who was in Provo. In 1860, Joseph S. Murdock became the bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Heber City and its vicinity.

On May 5, 1899, the Wasatch Wave published this on the 40-year anniversary of Heber. "Forty years ago this week [April 30, 1859], this valley was first settled by a company of enterprising citizens from Provo. This company consisted of John Crook, James Carlile, Jessie Bond, Henry Chatwin, Charles N. Carroll, Thomas Rasband, John Jordan, John Carlile, Wm. Giles and Mr. Carpenter, the last five named persons having since died. Forty years ago today, John Crook and Thomas Rasband commenced their first plowing in the beautiful little valley of the Timpanogos. A wonderful change has taken place in the appearance of the valley since that time. Delightful meadows and fields of waving grain have taken the place of sage brush and willows. Beautiful homes have erected where then was heard only the dismal howl of the coyote."

Economy

Heber City has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Utah. Local developers and business leaders cite that there are not enough jobs in the city itself (as 27% of residents commute to Park City or Salt Lake City for work) and wish to improve the city's self-reliance. Average home prices in the valley doubled from 2002 to 2008, and the population has grown by 25% in that same time period.

Tourism is a year-round industry in the Heber Valley. The winter season features cross-country and downhill skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling on several trails and the nearby ski resorts of Park City. In the summer and fall, golfing, off-roading, hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities are abundant. Heber is also home to the Heber Valley Historic Railroad (HVRR), which was known as the Heber Creeper before 1989.

Heber City's youth are employed largely in the surrounding golf courses, restaurants, and specialty shops in Heber City and the surrounding area. Local contractors and farmers are also a major source of employment for the youth. The adult population work mostly in Park City, Salt Lake City, Provo, and Orem. Skiing and Snowboarding are very popular among Heber City's youth, and many people go to Park City mountain resort, Canyons, or Deer Valley, all of which are in Park City. Farming and ranching are a large economic force, but this has diminished slightly. The largest local employer is the Wasatch County School District.
