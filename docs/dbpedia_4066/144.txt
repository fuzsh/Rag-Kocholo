Heber City is a midsize town of 7,000 situated in a farming valley between the Wasatch and Uinta mountain ranges. In summer, it serves as a convenient stop for travelers exploring the Wasatch Mountains. In winter, it not only serves as a relatively inexpensive bedroom community for skiers from the town of Park City and from Sundance Ski Resort, but has many snowy activities of its own.

Heber City is a recreational playground for everyone. Snowmobiling, skiing (both downhill and cross-country), horseback riding, mountain biking, camping, golfing, boating, hot air ballooning, water sports and even scuba diving are all readily done here. The Provo River cuts through the heart of the valley and boasts some of best Utah fishing out there, attracting fly fishermen from around the country.

There are many unique attractions in the area, including the historic Heber Valley Railroad, the Homestead Crater's 90Ã¸ mineral water, which makes scuba diving possible, Soldier Hollow's day lodge and trails that provided a home for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games biathlon and cross-country skiing events. There are also three reservoirs, four ski resorts, three national forests and state parks within an hour's drive.

Heber is located on Highway 40, about 18 miles south of Park City and 16 miles southwest of Kamas on the edge of the Uintas. Heber City has numerous motels, several restaurants/cafes and lots of restaurants, both fast food and fine dining.
