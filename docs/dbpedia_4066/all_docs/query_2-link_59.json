While it doesn't have a particularly large population, it plays an important role in the local politics of Wasatch County. The town has elected several representatives to the Utah State Legislature over the years, and its members have played an important role in deciding key local issues such as infrastructure projects and public education initiatives. Heber also elects local leaders for numerous county offices such as Clerk, Treasurer, and Sheriff. These elected officials are responsible for making sure that the citizens of Heber are well cared for and their voices are heard in local government decisions. The people of Heber take great pride in their political representation and ensure that their thoughts and ideas are taken into consideration when making decisions that affect their daily lives.\n\nThe political climate in Heber, UT is moderately conservative.\n\nWasatch County, UT is strongly conservative.

R if the Republican Party candidate won, D if the Democratic Party candidate won and I if the Independent Party candidate won. The six elections (2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020) would be expressed as six-letter word (R R D R R).\n\nThen we went a little further and added the dimension of magnitude. If the difference of victory was greater than 10 percent, the letter is upper case, and lower case if the difference was less than 10 percent. This allows us to see interesting voting patterns at just a glance.\n\nHere's the VoteWord for Iowa d r d d r. In the last six elections the state has been closely contested, voting narrowly for the Republican Party candidate in 2016 and 2020 after voting for the Democratic Party in 2008 and 2012. Virginia (r r d d d D) has voted for the Democratic Party in the last three elections.\n\nIndividual Campaign Contributions in Heber, UT\n\nIn the last 4 years (2018-2021), there were 1,113 contributions totaling $362,838 to the Democratic Party and liberal campaigns, averaging $326 per contribution.\n\nIn the last 4 years, there were 699 contributions totaling $149,973 to the Republican Party and conservative campaigns, averaging $215 per contribution.\n\n(source: Federal Election Commission)"
