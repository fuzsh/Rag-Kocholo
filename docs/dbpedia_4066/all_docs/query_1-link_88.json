        "text": "HEBER CITY, Utah — The Heber City Council voted to approve the Fitzgerald annexation at its December 6 meeting.\n\nThe 66 acres of newly annexed land sits at 2000 North Highway 40, and will bring 50 single-family homes and 296 townhomes to the community.\n\nThe annexation agreement also dictates that the developer will dedicate a portion of the land for a new fire station if requested by the Wasatch County Fire Department. If the fire department does not need a new location, the land will instead be dedicated as part of a public park.\n\nSimilar Reads On TownLift\n\nCouncil members Mike Johnston, Rachel Kahler, and Scott Phillips voted in favor of the Fitzgerald annexation, and Yvonne Barney and Ryan Stack voted against.\n\nStack cited the area’s designation as a rural residential cluster area in the city’s North Village Overlay Zone for his disapproval of the annexation.\n\n“This is designated as an area that is rural residential clusters in the NVOZ, that’s one to two dwelling units per acre. It was designed and incorporated to be a buffer area between the segments of higher density. For that reason I simply can’t support any up-zoning of this from rural residential,” he said, “While I may be in the minority on this, that is the reason for my forthcoming no vote.”\n\nThis is one of several recently approved annexations into Heber City that are expected to bring exponential population growth to the area."
