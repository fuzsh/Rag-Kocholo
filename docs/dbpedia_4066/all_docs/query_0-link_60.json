        "text": "Utahns may be accustomed to the snow, but they should also get used to a booming economy, modern infrastructure and exceptional education with the state ranked best in the nation for the second year.\n\nThe U.S. News and World Report study, and other recent reports, might not come as a surprise to residents in the Wasatch Back. Around 90% of attendees at the 2024 Zions Bank Wasatch Back Economic Summit on Tuesday said they feel somewhat or very optimistic about the state’s economy.\n\nThe results are significantly higher than the national average, according to Zions Bank Senior Economist and state Rep. Robert Spendlove. About 63% of voters nationally said they don’t think the U.S. economy is in a good place. There are a variety of reasons, such as overall inflation and interest rates. Consumer prices are also up about 20% since 2020.\n\nMortgage rates are now around 7%, down from last year. While that’s still below the 30-year average, around 72% of Utahns have home loan rates at or below 4% which means they’re effectively locked in and can’t easily move.\n\nHousing has also become increasingly unaffordable as the ratio of home prices to household income continues to soar — especially for lower-income families and first-time homebuyers.\n\n“The prospect of buying a home is really completely out of reach,” Spendlove said.\n\nYet Utah remains strong even as new data continues to change the overall economic outlook — particularly in Park City, Summit County and the broader Heber Valley, which serve as gateway communities to natural amenities.\n\n“We do continue to see strong population growth, people moving out of coastal areas moving out of California, Oregon, New York and moving into, well you know, they’re moving right here,” Spendlove said. “Within the state, you see that we … have relatively slower growth in the urban core, in the Wasatch Front, but there’s really strong growth in the Wasatch Back.”\n\nJob growth slowed overall in April with the national unemployment rate around 3.9%. Labor shortages are more pronounced in Utah, where the rate is 2.8%.\n\nHowever, the state’s job growth is strong. It took nearly a decade for workers to bounce back after the Great Recession, but they’re quickly back on track despite the drastic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere’s also about 70% labor participation in Utah compared to 63% nationwide. Most workers are between 25 to 54 with around 3 million people 55 and older opting out as part of the silver tsunami.\n\nSpendlove indicated inflation would start to slow when the extra cash swimming around dries up. Services and housing prices are driving the increases. He said the delinquency rate on revolving credit is also starting to rise, which means people are starting to get tapped out.\n\n“There’s this disconnect going on where it’s that the higher income have tons of capital and tons of cash to spend, but the lower income is running out and they’re getting grumpy as they run out of cash,” he said.\n\nA recent Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute consumer sentiment survey showed a 2.2% decrease in April, the second consecutive month of lower sentiment among Utahns than the nation. While it’s a minor difference, Utah is 76% and the U.S. is 77%, some analysts suggest it could signal nervousness about the economy and a possible decline in growth.\n\nEconomists are anticipating a few different scenarios for how the economy might pan out over the next year with the goal of a soft landing, or something similar to the market downturn of 2002. This allows the economy to slow down without creating a recession.\n\nBut Spendlove warned it could easily swing negative depending on how much various sectors soften. For example, there was accelerated growth in health care, but a big decrease in construction. He’ll be watching with a careful eye.\n\n“The U.S. economy is very strong. Within the U.S., Utah is the strongest economy. So we’re the strongest economy in the strongest economy in the world,” Spendlove said. “Yes, there are some risks. But it’s a great time to be in Utah and especially in the Wasatch Back.”\n\nThe annual Wasatch Back Economic Summit was organized in partnership by the Park City Chamber/Bureau and the Heber Valley Chamber of Commerce. This year’s theme was “Beyond Boundaries.”\n\nAttendees were invited to participate in breakout sessions hosted by planning, transportation, economic, housing and technology officials as well as elected leaders from Summit and Wasatch counties throughout the day."
