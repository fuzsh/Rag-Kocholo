        "text": "HEBER CITY, Utah — The Heber City Council approved the North Village Annexation at its meeting on Tuesday, November 14, which will bring five Wasatch County properties and four new developments to the city.\n\nThe newly approved 60-acre annexation will consist of 80,000 square feet of commercial space, townhomes, close to 350 homes, and an assisted living facility up to three stories tall are expected to add to the exponential growth Wasatch County is likely to see in the coming years.\n\nThe Heber City Council initially discussed the annexation at its November 1 meeting and chose not to make a decision at that time, citing concerns about affordable housing.\n\nSimilar Reads On TownLift\n\n“There were concerns expressed about Section 3.6 (Low-income housing) and the proposed affordable housing bonus density of 10%.” A city staff report said. “The developers have followed the direction of that discussion and are proposing that 5% of the dwellings will be affordable to those earning 60% or less of Average Median Income (AMI). The developers have agreed to decrease their bonus density from 10 percent to 5 percent.”\n\nOut of the nearly 350 homes to be built, 17 will be designated as affordable housing. The land will not officially become a part of Heber until Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson signs off on the annexation."
