        "text": "Antique & Classic Power Museum\n\n50 Starks Lane, Wallsburg\n\n“My dad was a teenager in the 1950s and spent a lot of time then fixing cars and riding bikes,” says Pam Williams, daughter of Richard W. Erickson, and one of seven trustees of her father’s Antique & Classic Power Museum in Wallsburg. “He was a factory hillclimber for a Harley-Davidson dealer in Minnesota and spent a lot of time participating in hill climbs in Wisconsin. Back then, he was like the Fonzie of Litchfield, Minnesota.”\n\nFollowing a career in the military, Erickson and his wife, Rita, relocated in the late 1960s from the Upper Midwest to Utah to start a construction company. In 1972, he purchased 350 acres in upper Provo Canyon just outside of Wallsburg, “thinking he’d store tractors on it,” Williams says. The land soon became a repository for Erickson’s passion: power engines. In 1999, Erickson started a foundation and, over the following years, slowly developed his collection and the property into a museum.\n\nThe Antique & Classic Power Museum now encompasses 23 buildings housing an array of antique vehicles. The museum includes Erickson’s more than 150 motorcycles dating to the 1900s, a collection of dozens of classic cars, 120 farm tractors, and a belt-driven sawmill. The museum also features a pioneer village that includes a church with a functioning pump organ, 1800s-era log cabins, historical replicas of small shops and stores and the original Erickson family home, moved to the site from Minnesota."
