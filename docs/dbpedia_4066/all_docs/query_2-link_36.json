        "text": "How expensive is it to live in Heber City?\n\nBased on our Heber City cost of living calculator, Heber City is 1% less expensive than the national average and 6% more expensive to live in than the average city in Utah. This assumes a $72,000 annual salary and a 2 Bedroom Apt. Food costs in Heber City are more affordable than average in the United States. Transportations costs in Heber City are more affordable than average in the United States. Housing costs in Heber City are as affordable than average in the United States. Health care costs in Heber City are more affordable than the US average.\n\nWhat does it cost to move to Heber City?\n\nThe cost of moving to Heber City depends on a lot of factors. The biggest factor is the difference in cost of living between the two locations, which can be determined using ERI's cost of living calculator. The other major factor is the distance between the two locations.\n\nWhat is a cost of living index?\n\nA cost of living index is a broad measurement of the cost of different expenses expected by the average person living in a certain location. Some of the categories tracked include health care costs, transportation, housing, groceries, and more. These numbers are tracked in specific locations to gauge how much it costs to live in a certain area over time.\n\nAnother good way to interpret this general number is to ask the question, \"How many goods and/or services does a specific amount of money purchase in a given location?\" An easy example would be that $100 goes further in Reno, Nevada, than it does in San Francisco, California. The goods and services tracked are need-based, meaning entertainment and other incurred expenses not required to live in a certain area are not tracked.\n\nThe main purpose of a cost of living index is to help a person quickly decide if moving from one location to another will increase or decrease quality of life.\n\nHow did we calculate our cost of living index?\n\nCost of living data are derived from ERI's cost of living surveys and web digitization of public domain records. Data are comprised of health care, transportation, housing, and grocery costs, which are then averaged out across the county. On the graphs above, the \"0\" represents the countryâ€™s average. The percentage can either be lower, expressed by a negative number, or higher than the national average, expressed by a positive number. The important part to remember is the locations are compared to an average of other locations."
