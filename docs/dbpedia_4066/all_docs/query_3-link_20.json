        "text": "Steve Neal — a retired cosmetic surgeon and member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — has been working for 29 years to erect a statue garden with religious and patriotic scenes. Tuesday, he came to Heber City’s council meeting to share his vision for the project, which he plans to put in the municipality.\n\nThe statues, he said, will depict notable scenes from The Book of Mormon — a book within his church’s scriptural canon that members believe was written by ancient inhabitants of the American continent who testified of and were visited by Jesus Christ.\n\nNeal said there will also be statues devoted to the country’s founding, something he said his religious sect considers a divine act. He believes “the founding fathers were very religious people, and they ascribed their actions to God,” and he wants to share his view with others.\n\nThe project, Neal said, will go in a private garden on private land and will be owned by his nonprofit, Christ in America Legacy Park.\n\n“14 years ago, my colleagues and I made the Mormon battalion monument up in Salt Lake,” Neal said. “This is a greater work. There is much more sculpting going on. … We’ve looked at lots of different sites, and Heber is the most ideal place we’ve ever found.”\n\nThe statues will include a Book of Mormon prophet’s vision of America, Christ giving the Sermon on the Mount to ancient inhabitants of America and a parallel between George Washington and The Book of Mormon prophet Moroni.\n\nThere are 71 planned sculptures, and so far 18 have been paid for.\n\nThat, however, doesn’t mean the project hasn’t already received substantial vows for funding.\n\n“Our best, biggest donors are from the states of Idaho and Arizona, so we hope to find some good pens here in this area as well,” Neal said. “Our biggest donor has put us in his wheel for $15 million. That will be our endowment fund.”\n\nMayor Heidi Franco said Heber City is astounded it has been chosen as the location for the garden.\n\n“The quality of your work is absolutely amazing,” she said. “This is bigger than I could have ever thought. I couldn’t thank you enough.”\n\nCouncilor Yvonne Barney asked if the garden will be a visitors’ center for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nNeal said it will not be. While there will be a suggested but unnecessary donation asked of visitors, the garden is meant “to be open to all.”\n\n“We want people to actually come and spend an afternoon,” he said. “There will be juried art shows at the visitors’ center. There will be summer concerts we want to have.”\n\nAccording to Neal, the garden and its visitors’ center will be located near the Jordanelle Amphitheater."
