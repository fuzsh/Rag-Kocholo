        "text": "Are you planning a visit to Heber Valley?\n\nI have to admit that when I first got the opportunity to visit Heber Valley, I went in with a completely open mind. I had no idea what to expect or what awaited me in this hidden gem in Utah.\n\nI say a hidden gem because when people (me, I am people) think Utah, they think Salt Lake City and Park City. So, for me, Heber Valley was a hidden gem.\n\nBut after spending three days in Heber Valley, I could not stop talking about it. The food, the people, and the outdoor activities blew me away. During our visit, we got to go fly fishing, swim in a crater, and taste some of the best craft chocolate this side of the world.\n\nAnd this was only a tiny taste of what Heber Valley, Utah, offers.\n\nThings to do in Heber Valley\n\nHeber Valley, known as the Utah Alps, has so much to do year-round. In the winter, visitors come for snow sports like skiing and snowmobiling; however, in the summer, visitors come to enjoy hiking and water sports.\n\nWe had the opportunity to enjoy a bit of spring during our visit, which was a great time of year for fly fishing and even swimming in the Homestead Crater.\n\nFly Fishing\n\nDuring our trip to Heber Valley, one of the first activities we tried was Fly Fishing. We met with Rocky Mountain Outfitters, who guided us to the Provo River for catch and release fly fishing. The day began with gearing up, followed by a quick 10-minute hike to a great spot on the river.\n\nCrossing the river was an adventure, but once we across we were taught the art of fly fishing. Our guides were fantastic, splitting us into pairs for better instruction and assistance, especially when catching our first fish. Impressively, we each caught at least two fish.\n\nSpending a few hours on the river was an incredible experience. Although Fly Fishing might not immediately come to mind as a luxurious or wellness activity, I have to say being alone with your fishing rod against the backdrop of the mountains is incredibly therapeutic.\n\nHomestead Crater (Utah Crater)\n\nAnother favorite thing we did was visit the Homestead Crater (AKA Utah Crater). Nestled in a beehive-shaped limestone rock, this geothermal spring gives visitors the opportunity to swim, snorkel, or scuba dive in its warm, mineral-rich waters. The water temperature stays around 90-96 degrees Fahrenheit all year, offering a soothing soak anytime of year.\n\nWhile the crater is open to the public, reservations are required. You can reserve a swim, snorkle or scuba session. Swim sessions last about 40 minutes while scuba sessions last about an hour.\n\nVisiting was easy and organized. We checked in at the Homestead Crater, then followed a short tunnel to the crater. There are changing rooms and lockers available at the crater for your convenience however they are limited so plan accordingly.\n\nAll you need is your swimsuit and a towel for your visit, however I opted to wear my favorite water shoes.\n\nA trip to the Homestead Crater is a must when you're in Heber Valley. It blends adventure with the healing qualities of mineral waters. It was the perfect way to unwind after a day of adventure.\n\nChocolate Tasting at Ritual Chocolate\n\nIf you love chocolate then you definitely need to make time to visit Ritual Chocolate. Not only is the choclate phenomenal but learning about its origin and process will deepen your appreciation for craft chocolate.\n\nRitual Chocolate was founded on a deep commitment to quality, ethical sourcing, and chocolate-making artistry. The founders aimed to produce exceptional chocolate that adheres to ethical practices and showcases the unique flavors of cacao from various regions.\n\nAs we discovered, craft chocolate stands apart from mass-produced chocolate by focusing on the quality of cacao beans and the intricate processes that enhance its flavor. Every step from bean to bar is carefully controlled at Ritual Chocolate to ensure superior taste and preserve the cacao's integrity and complexity.\n\nWhat sets Ritual Chocolate apart is its dedication to the craft. It sources cacao beans directly from select farms, using only the finest beans. This direct sourcing supports sustainable farming and ensures farmers receive fair pay.\n\nOur tasting at Ritual Chocolate was extraordinary. The chocolate's rich flavors and subtle notes varied from bar to bar, offering a unique taste journey with each piece. We enjoyed a range of chocolates, from dark and intense to fruity and light, each telling the story of its origin.\n\nI personally walked away with a couple of bars to enjoy at home. I couldn't resist.\n\nHeber Valley Railroad\n\nThe Heber Valley Railroad, previously known as the “The Heber Creeper,” is one of the most popular things to do in Heber Valley.\n\nThis historic gem offers unforgettable journeys through Heber Valley and Provo Canyon's stunning landscapes.
