        "text": "North village overlay zone information (nvoz)\n\nNews & Announcements\n\nHeber City has begun a process of simplifying and updating our Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances. Over the next 9 months many changes will be introduced to improve the consistency within the ordinances, to repeal unused or redundant ordinances, to comply with recent State Law requirements, and to improve the quality of the ordinances. All changes will require a properly noticed Public Hearing with the Planning Commission and a subsequent adoption by the City Council.\n\nLand User Code & Applications\n\nThe Planning Department is responsible for implementation of the Land Use Code, which involves the processing of Land Use Applications. The Land Use Code addresses a wide variety of topics ranging from affordable housing to signage, design criteria, and open space. Land Use Applications include a variety of land use or development requests, such as zone changes, subdivisions, commercial developments, and conditional use permits.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe Planning Department processes all development applications through:\n\nCity Council Stages\n\nCity Staff\n\nDevelopment Review Committee\n\nPlanning Commission\n\nThe Planning Staff coordinates other City departments’ review of projects as they are submitted. The Staff also provides direct assistance to Boards, Commissions, and Committees. The Planning Department maintains and updates the City’s Zoning/Development Code, the official Zoning and Future Land Use maps, and the City’s General Plan. The Planning Department conducts long-range planning for future growth in the City. Long Range Planning includes more \"big picture\" projects that usually involve public engagement.\n\nAdministrative Fees and Escrow Fees\n\nAdministrative fees cover costs for Planning Commission, City Council and Staff in preparing for and conducting public meetings and development review meetings for each particular application. Administrative fees are a fixed amount per application.\n\nEscrow fees cover estimated costs for engineering and planning consultant reviews of the application. Consultants are paid monthly based on submitted invoices. As the escrow is drawn down each month to pay consultants, applicants must bring the balance of the escrow back to the original amount to ensure there is an adequate amount to pay for consultant review time. Once the application review has been completed, any remaining balance after consultants have been paid is refunded back to the applicant."
