        "text": "Your relative may want to think about issues such as someone with a medical condition of any kind that may need quick access to hospital or clinic facilities. Even with no conditions there are still emergencies that can arise.\n\nI don't know about Timberlakes, but it sounds similar to a neighborhood nearer to Park City called Tollgate Canyon. Again, unpaved roads, not on the plow route, the realtor I have in that area stated she would have to meet the listing agent at a lower elevation and take their HUGE SUV up to show a lisiting in winter.\n\nHeck, even paved neighborhoods can get hairy in some of those Wasatch Back / Heber Valley neighborhoods, I actually had to bring my rental car to a stop for busting out laughing while driving in the Summit Park neighborhood in Park City when one wheel was compressed almost to rubbing the rim while another was nearly suspended in air. It was like simultaneously trying to drive through a gully, over a ridge, and around the side of a basketball at the same time. And this was late May, what it would be like in winter? Not sure I want to know.\n\nI would think one would need to be more self sufficient and cautious living in these types of neighborhoods and developments."
