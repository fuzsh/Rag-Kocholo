New growth in residential real estate is an indication that people are choosing to move to Heber City, and putting down their money on brand new construction. Heber City’s real estate is, on average, some of the newest in the nation. Heber City does seem to be experiencing an influx of affluent people, because the median household income is $98,934.00.\n\nHeber City home prices are not only among the most expensive in Utah, but Heber City real estate also consistently ranks among the most expensive in America.\n\nOf important note, Heber City is also a city of artists.

This concentration of artists helps shape Heber City’s character.\n\nA relatively large number of people in Heber City telecommute to their jobs. Overall, about 10.26% of the workforce works from home. While this may seem like a small number, as a fraction of the total workforce it ranks among the highest in the country. These workers are often telecommuters who work in knowledge-based, white-collar professions. For example, Silicon Valley has large numbers of people who telecommute. Other at-home workers may be self-employed people who operate small businesses out of their homes.\n\nBecause of many things, Heber City is a very good place for families to consider.

Is Heber City perfect? Of course not, and if you like frenetic nightlife, it will be far from your cup of tea. But overall this is a solid community, with many things to recommend it as a family-friendly place to live.\n\nThe education level of Heber City ranks among the highest in the nation. Of the 25-and-older adult population in Heber City, 41.44% have at least a bachelor's degree.
