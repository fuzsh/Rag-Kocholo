        "text": "Weber State University announces 2024-25 theatre season\n\nWeber State's School of Performing Arts has announced its highly anticipated theatre season for the 2024–25 academic year. Featuring a mix of classic tales, innovative storytelling and musical splendor, this season promises something special for every theatre enthusiast.\n\nTheater, art open professional doors for award-winning Weber State grad\n\nPorter Lance made headlines last year for his award-winning scenic design of Weber State’s production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, earning top prize at the national Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival in Washington, D.C.\n\nScholarships help respiratory therapy grad succeed amid family hardships\n\nRachel Okwabi chose Weber State because it’s one of the few universities offering a bachelor’s degree in respiratory therapy. She earned that degree in April 2024, thanks in part to scholarships during a particularly difficult time.\n\nWeber State alum finds success with dental innovation\n\nJeremy Ellis, a Weber State University alum and dentist in Logan, Utah, was helping his daughter use fiber optic glass to build a jellyfish for a science fair project, when it occurred to him the material would be fantastic for repairing a chipped tooth."
