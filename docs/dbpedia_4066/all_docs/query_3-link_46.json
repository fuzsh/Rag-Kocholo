        "text": "WASATCH COUNTY, Utah — The Wasatch County Council passed a resolution last week supporting the US-40 to US-189 bypass around Heber City. This decision endorses the design and construction of transportation alternatives aimed at alleviating traffic congestion on US-40.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Wasatch County Manager’s Office, the council’s resolution highlights the “crucial need for enhanced mobility in Wasatch County.” This move aligns with the community’s long-standing commitment to maintaining its rural character, evidenced by the passage of open space bonds in 2018 and the adoption of agricultural protection areas in 2022.\n\nCouncil member Mark Nelson emphasized the dual priorities of mobility and conservation, stating, “We have as a high priority both of these things. These two things that seem to conflict each other when, in fact, there’s a process for working that out, and we’re in favor of both of them.”\n\nSimilar Reads On TownLift\n\nThe council expressed confidence that both objectives can be simultaneously achieved. It remains dedicated to “actively pursuing means to responsibly preserve the rural character of the community through perpetual conservation agreements and continuing to work with all parties to accomplish these outcomes.”\n\nShare your thoughts on the US-40 to US-189 bypass and how it might impact Heber City’s future.
