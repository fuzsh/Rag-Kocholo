        "text": "Less than a year after being announced as a new temple by President Russell M. Nelson in October 2021 general conference, the Heber Valley Utah Temple now has an official site location, artist’s exterior rendering and a set date for its groundbreaking.\n\nThe three milestones were announced Monday, Sept. 19, on ChurchofJesusChrist.org — the same day that a site location made public for the Teton River Idaho Temple.\n\nHeber Valley Utah Temple\n\nThe three-story temple of approximately 88,000 square feet will be built on a 17.9-acre site southeast of 1400 E. Center St. in Heber City, Utah.\n\nA groundbreaking ceremony will be held Saturday, Oct. 8, at the temple site, with Elder Kevin R. Duncan, a General Authority Seventy and executive director of the Church’s Temple Department, presiding at the event.\n\nThe Heber Valley temple is one of the Church’s 28 temples in Utah in various stages of operation, construction or development.\n\nThe 14 dedicated and operating temples are the Bountiful, Brigham City, Cedar City, Draper, Jordan River, Logan, Monticello, Mount Timpanogos, Ogden, Oquirrh Mountain, Payson, Provo City Center, Provo and Vernal temples. Another three dedicated temples are undergoing major renovations — the Manti, Salt Lake and St. George temples.\n\nTen temples in Utah are under construction — the Deseret Peak, Ephraim, Layton, Lindon, Orem, Red Cliffs, Saratoga Springs, Smithfield, Syracuse and Taylorsville temples. The Heber Valley temple will fall under that designation after the Oct. 8 groundbreaking."
