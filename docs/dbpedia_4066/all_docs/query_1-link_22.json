        "text": "Eligible buyers are households with one or more persons employed in Wasatch County and having a gross annual household income less than $129,840 (120% AMI). If your income is slightly higher than the amounts listed above, we would still encourage you to apply for a home as there may be options available to higher income families if the situation is warranted.\n\nApplicants employed as teachers, firefighters, police officers, municipal staff, service district staff, medical staff, etc. within Wasatch County will have first priority. Applicants employed in other fields within Wasatch County will have second priority. All units will have an owner-occupancy requirement, a maximum resale price and other requirements to maintain affordability over time.\n\nMountainlands does not provide financing, so applicants will need to secure their own financing (typically a loan from a mortgage company or bank). As a first step, you may consider reaching out to a mortgage lender to determine your readiness to buy a home. We will require, as part of the application process, that you demonstrate an ability to obtain financing to purchase a unit. This will be in the form of a preapproval letter from a lender."
