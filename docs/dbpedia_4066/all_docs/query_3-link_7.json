        "text": "County in Utah, United States\n\nCounty in Utah\n\nWasatch County ( WAH-satch) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 34,788.[1] Its county seat and largest city is Heber City.[2] The county was named for a Ute word meaning \"mountain pass\" or \"low place in the high mountains\".\n\nWasatch County is part of the Heber, UT Micropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Salt Lake City-Provo-Orem, UT Combined Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first settlers were Mormon pioneers, in 1859, settling near present Heber City, Midway, and Charleston. On January 17, 1862, the Utah Territory legislature created the county, annexing areas from Great Salt Lake, Green River, Sanpete, Summit, and Utah counties. Heber was selected as the county seat. Wasatch in Ute means \"mountain pass\" or \"low pass over high range\". Heber City was named for Mormon Apostle Heber C. Kimball. The county boundaries were altered in 1880 and 1884, and then on January 4, 1915, the eastern portion was partitioned off to become Duchesne County. The Wasatch County boundaries have remained unchanged since 1915.[3]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nHeber Valley has a relatively cool climate since it is mountain-ringed, and over half the land is 7,500 feet (2,300 metres) above sea level. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches (410 millimetres). The county is divided into two watersheds—the Colorado and the Great Basin drainage systems.[4] Flowing from the East are Daniels, Lake Fork, and Center creeks. From the north and northeast is the Provo River. Flowing from the west is Snake Creek. The county's highest point is the west slope of Murdock Mountain[4] in the Uinta Mountains, at 10,840 ft (3,300 m) ASL.[5]\n\nWasatch County has a total area of 1,206 square miles (3,120 km2), of which 1,176 square miles (3,050 km2) is land and 30 square miles (78 km2) (2.5%) is water.[6]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nSalt Lake County - northwest\n\nSummit County - north\n\nDuchesne County - east\n\nUtah County - southwest\n\nProtected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nLakes\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18701,244—18802,927135.3%18903,59522.8%19004,78633.1%19108,92086.4%19204,625−48.2%19305,63621.9%19405,7542.1%19505,574−3.1%19605,308−4.8%19705,86310.5%19808,52345.4%199010,08918.4%200015,21550.8%201023,53054.7%202034,78847.8%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 23,530 people, 4,743 households, and 3,870 families in the county.
