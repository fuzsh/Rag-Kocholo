        "text": "DISCOVERY\n\nThe Heber Valley (Wasatch County) area was originally discovered by Native Americans - the Timpanogos Utes being the most recent. The area was used primarily as a summer hunting ground and as an area where materials for hunting tools could be found and produced. \"Wasatch\" in the Uto-Aztecan language means \"mountain pass\" or \"low pass over high range.\" Learn more about the Legend of Mount Timpanogos.\n\nPARADISE LAND\n\nOn a summer morning in 1857, workers employed at a sawmill in Big Cottonwood Canyon hiked to the summit of the Wasatch Mountain Range and viewed a high alpine valley to the southeast that had been reputed as a \"Paradise Land.\" Hearing promising reports from the sawmill workers and others, a group of cattlemen left Provo in the spring of 1858 and drove their herds up Provo Canyon to establish ranches in the south end of the valley.\n\nFROM LONDON TO HEBER VALLEY\n\nA pioneer party consisting primarily of Latter-Day Saints converts from Great Britain arrived on May 2, 1859. They camped about one mile north of present Heber City and christened the townsite \"London.\" The townsite was surveyed in June 1859 at what is now the north end of Heber City Main Street. In 1862, Wasatch County was created by the territorial legislature and, at that time, the London townsite was renamed Heber City in recognition of one of the prominent settlers, Heber C. Kimball. As the largest settlement in the area, Heber City was established as the county seat. Learn more about the history of Midway, Utah.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n1776 - The first white men visit the area. Members of the Dominguez-Escalante expedition traveling down Diamond Fork to Spanish Fork Canyon and on to Utah Valley.\n\n1825 - Fur trappers enter the area. Etienne Provost from Taos, New Mexico, and William H. Ashley from St. Louis both led groups in the area to trap beaver in the Uinta and Wasatch Mountain ranges.\n\nOctober 1858 - A road is completed up Provo Canyon at the Latter-Day Saints Church President, Brigham Young's request. A bridge was also constructed to cross the Provo River at the mouth of the canyon.\n\nJuly 1859 - Settlers build their houses closely together to form a fort, named Fort Heber, located between 100 West and 300 West and between 200 North and 500 North. The homes were built closely together for protection from Native Americans.\n\n1860s - During the 1860s and 1870s, a large number of Swiss immigrants arrived. The two Snake Creek settlements reached an agreement to build a fort halfway or midway between the two existing communities, hence the name Midway.\n\n1862 - Issac O. Wall carries mail on horseback to the community during summer months. During spring, the Provo River is too high to cross and Wall extends a cable from trees on either side of the river to transfer mail pouches with the Provo mail carrier. This same year, the territorial legislature created Wasatch County (which then included all of the Uinta Basin to the east.) Heber City, named after Mormon leader Heber C. Kimball, was selected as the county seat.\n\n1864-1865 - Homes and community buildings are built from native red sandstone.\n\nSpring 1866 - Heber City's population grows as people from surrounding settlements move together for protection from Native Americans during the Black Hawk War.\n\n1867 - The leader of the pioneers, Joseph Murdock, and the Ute tribe chief, Tabby-To-Kwanah, met over a feast and established a peace treaty.\n\n1887 - Martin Hansen discovered what became known as \"Hansen Cave\" in October 1887 while cutting timber and tracking cougar footprints. This is one of three caves that comprise Timpanogos Caves National Monument.\n\nMarch 23, 1889 - The Wasatch Wave newspaper publishes its first edition under the ownership of William H.
