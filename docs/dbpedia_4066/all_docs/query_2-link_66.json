        "text": "Heber City was founded in the late 1850s by English Mormon emigrants and is named after the Mormon leader Heber C. Kimball. The city was historically pastoral, focusing largely on dairy farms and cattle ranching, but has since become a commuter town for those working in Park City and Salt Lake City, among others. Heber City was named one of the 10 Best Small Towns by Livability.com in 2014. Heber City currently has a high growth rate but has long been one of the top local destinations for residents around Utah and elsewhere. It also has an appealing high employment, low-crime status, great schooling, and more natural amenities (clean mountain air, breathtaking panoramic views, and wide-open back country space) than you could hope for. Recreational activities are an everyday part of life at Heber City, such as hiking, biking, golfing, horseback riding, boating, skiing, and many more. Red Ledges Golf Club is right next to the city. Culture is also a big part of Heber City, where there are plenty of special events and activities that take place almost every week. In the summer months, a farmers market is set up every Thursday at Main Street Park, close to shops that inhabit buildings dating back to the city's beginnings in the early 1900s. The Heber Valley Historic Railroad takes you on a nostalgic and scenic 16-mile excursion to Vivian Park in Provo Canyon. Heber City proudly hosts the annual week-long Wasatch County Fair with a carnival, parade, rodeo, demolition derby, and beauty pageant.\n\nRecreational activities are an everyday part of life at Heber City, such as hiking, biking, golfing, horseback riding, boating, skiing, and many more.
