        "text": "I get lots of calls from people inside & outside of Utah who are interested in purchasing a cabin in Timberlakes. It’s one of the few locations in our area where you can buy a home on an acre of land with beautiful views for under $400,000. Timberlakes offers mountain living at its finest. It is both accessible to the stores and restaurants of Heber City, and peaceful with an abundance of wildlife. But there are definitely some drawbacks and things to know before making a decision to own a property there.\n\nWhere is Timberlakes? Timberlakes is 7 miles east of Heber City in Lake Creek Canyon, just up the road from Red Ledges. It’s about a 45 minute drive from Park City. Timberlakes has 1504 lots (it’s big!), and each is about one acre. While the entrance to Timberlakes is 6,600 feet, the upper areas rise to over 9,000 feet, meaning abundant snow! There are 3 miles of paved road and over 30 miles of gravel roads. The roads are maintained by the Timber Lakes Property Owners Association (TLPOA) up to the “tree line”. Above the tree line, one must snowmobile to their property or limit use to the summer months.\n\nWhile TLPOA does an exceptional job of clearing the roads, when heavy storms hit, guests and even some emergency service vehicles may have trouble accessing the roads. If you decide to live in Timberlakes, four-wheel drive and good tires are essential. Good driving skills and judgment are also important in this mountain environment.\n\nThere are several small lakes and ponds in Timberlakes. Deer, moose, fox, raccoons, porcupines, squirrels, chipmunks, badgers and many varieties of birds inhabit the area. Occasionally coyotes, mountain lions, elk and bear have been spotted within the subdivision.\n\nAlmost all homes use propane gas, electricity and septic tanks. Cell phone service is non-existent in certain parts of the subdivision, so many residents keep a landline. Curbiside trash pickup is not available. All residents use the dumpster provided by the main gate. Timberlakes has its own water special services district for culinary water hookup.\n\nThe residents of Timberlakes are like a large family and look out for each other. Those who share the desire to trade some conveniences for the peace and tranquility of the wilderness share a special bond. There is a community Facebook page in which residents post amazing photos of the wildlife, report missing dogs, and ask each other for recommendations on everything from ticks to plumbers.\n\nNevertheless, Timberlakes is not for everyone. I sold a home to a young coupe there a few years ago. In the spring, they called to tell me that the wife moved out because she could no longer stand the “deer and the snow”. I listed their home for sale less than a year after they moved in. Before showing homes in Timberlakes, I like to make sure it’s the right community for my clients. Timberlakes is a very special place to live. The views are some of the best in the Heber Valley and the residents are generally friendly and helpful.\n\nShane Jackman snapped all of these amazing pictures. Thank you Shane."
