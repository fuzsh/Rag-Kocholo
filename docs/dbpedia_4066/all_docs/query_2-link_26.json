        "text": "In the in the country, one Utah town is seeing a particularly strong jump in its influx of new residents.\n\nHeber City, located in Wasatch County, saw an increase of 4.7 percent in net in-migration in 2020, according to data from the U.S. Postal Service compiled by the .\n\nCompared to a much smaller growth rate of 0.7 percent in 2019, that’s a shift of nearly four percent for Heber — the fifth-highest shift in the country, according to the Times. Most of the other areas on that list are located on the east coast.\n\n“I’m not entirely surprised,” said Heber Mayor Kelleen Potter. “But in the entire nation, to be number five, that’s a little bit shocking.”\n\nPotter said she regularly meets people who have moved to Heber from other states including California, Georgia, and Illinois.\n\n“It’s just a really desirable place to live when you look at quality of life,” said Potter, “and so we’re just seeing the impact of all of that.”\n\nThe mayor attributes the jump to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ability of people to move elsewhere while working remotely. Church Zuercher, a realtor, said Heber is very popular for people looking to move in.\n\nIt’s buyers from anywhere in the United States,” Zuercher said. “You definitely feel the influx of new people, for sure.”\n\nZuercher said he has sold homes in the Heber area for more than 20 years, and he notices the growth firsthand.\n\n“We see more traffic,” he said, “we see more people in the restaurants.”\n\nThat’s good news for establishments like Granny’s Drive-In, located on Heber’s Main Street. Owner Mike Motyka, who’s preparing for the restaurant to open for the season this Friday, said he’s not surprised Heber has seen such pronounced growth.\n\nYou can just tell people want to come here for what it has to offer, for the outdoors and everything,” Motyka said.\n\nNoting Heber still has a small-town feel, Motyka said signs of growth are everywhere. “You can just kind of tell,” he said, “it’s coming.”\n\nThis latest growth is just an example of a bigger picture for Heber City. According to , Heber grew from roughly 11,000 people in 2010 to about 17,000 in 2019 — almost a 50 percent jump."
