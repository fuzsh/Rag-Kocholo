They’ll be installed on several acres of land donated to the project by the Jordanelle Ridge development.\n\nThere will be an 18-foot statue of Jesus, bronze panels depicting stories from the Book of Mormon and statues commemorating the country’s founders.\n\nThe sculpture park will be adjacent to a larger Heber Valley arts district, the future home of an outdoor amphitheater, performance spaces and art classrooms.\n\nCity manager Matt Brower said the city council will get acquainted with the plans because of the park’s proximity to the future arts district."
