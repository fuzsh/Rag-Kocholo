Heber City, city, seat (1862) of Wasatch county, northern Utah, U.S. Named in 1859 to honour Mormon leader Heber C. Kimball, the original town site contained a fort to protect settlers from Indian attacks, as well as a handful of homes. The city grew to become a locally important centre of agricultural and dairy production; with the completion of the Denver and Rio Grande Western railroad line in 1899, it became a shipping point for lumber and ore taken from the nearby Uinta Mountains. The picturesque city, located 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Salt Lake City, is now a suburb of the metropolis. Inc. town, 1889; city, 1901. Pop. (2000) 7,291; (2010) 11,362.
