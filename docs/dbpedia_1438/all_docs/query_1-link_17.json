        "text": "No law, written rule, or regulation specifies who may lie in state; use of the U.S. Capitol Rotunda is controlled by concurrent action of the House and Senate. Any person who has rendered distinguished service to the nation may lie in state if the family so wishes and Congress approves. In the case of unknown soldiers, the president or the appropriate branch of the armed forces initiates the action. Since 1865, most services in the Rotunda have used the catafalque constructed for the coffin of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhen the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is notified that a ceremony will occur, teams are coordinated across the Capitol campus and a commitment to excellence ensures that no detail is overlooked.\n\nThose Who Have Lain in State or in Honor in the U.S. Capitol\n\nThe prominent individuals who have been so honored are listed below. These figures have lain in state, or in honor, in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda unless otherwise specified (indicated by an asterisk *). In addition to the Rotunda, other areas such as National Statuary Hall, the Old Supreme Court Chamber, the entrance to the House Chamber and the East Central Front Portico have been used for those who have lain in state or in honor.\n\nDownload the list below as a PDF."
