        "text": "A central question in comparative politics—and one of the foundational questions of economics (Smith Reference Smith1776)—asks why some nations have grown, prospered, and developed more rapidly than others. While explanations of differing rates of development range from genetic to biological to geographic to environmental (see Baker Reference Baker2013 or Diamond Reference Diamond1997 for syntheses), major cross-national research projects argue persuasively that political competition lies at the heart of this story (Acemoglu et al. Reference Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson2019; Acemoglu and Robinson Reference Acemoglu and Robinson2006; Ansell Reference Ansell2010; Bollyky et al. Reference Bollyky, Templin, Cohen, Schoder, Dieleman and Wigley2019; Lindert Reference Lindert2004; North, Wallis, and Weingast Reference North, Wallis and Weingast2009; Paglayan Reference Paglayan2021; Stasavage Reference Stasavage2005). Comparative politics has shown that varied political institutions can set nations on different trajectories in the educational levels, wealth, and well-being of their residents.\n\nYet in the field of American state politics—an arena where, unlike in the international realm, we can examine variation among states that are all, at least nominally, democratic—this question has been all but ignored. This is not because the American states lack variation in levels of prosperity or health or education. But why have some states prospered, while others have faltered? What set some states on a path to higher growth, a broader expansion of educational opportunities, or an earlier elimination of illiteracy? Why have some states been able to reduce infant mortality rates more sharply than others and even seen something as essential as the life expectancies of their residents grow more rapidly?\n\nFew scholars have taken up these questions. Those who have are primarily economists, and they have focused almost exclusively on growth in income levels (Besley and Case Reference Besley and Case2003; Besley, Persson, and Sturm Reference Besley, Persson and Sturm2010; Frank Reference Frank2009; Goldberg, Wibbels, and Mvukiyehe Reference Hixson, Hepler and Kim2008; Malloy, Pearson-Merkowitz, and Morris Reference Malloy, Pearson-Merkowitz and Morris2016; Mitchener and McLean Reference Smith2003) rather than the broader notion of human development described in the work of Amartya Sen (Reference Sen1999). Political scientists have done landmark research detailing the differences in policy choices across states (Brown Reference Brown1995; Caughey and Warshaw Reference Caughey and Warshaw2017; Caughey, Warshaw, and Xu Reference Caughey, Warshaw and Xu2017; Dawson and Robinson Reference Dawson and Robinson1963; Dye Reference Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson1966; Hofferbert Reference Hofferbert1966; Rose Reference Rose2013; Schneider Reference Dye1988; Smith Reference Schneider1997; Winters Reference Mitchener and McLean1976), but we have found no work at the state level looking comprehensively at the policy outcomes that these choices bring. While Aldrich and Griffin (Reference Aldrich and Griffin2018) do begin to examine these questions, their units of analysis are regions (North, South, and Border States) rather than individual states.\n\nOur argument is that political institutions in general—and party competition in particular—are central to explaining variations in development across the states. Parties give their members individual electoral incentives to pursue the collective goal of improving the public welfare, at the same time that they create the political ties necessary to move a major policy program through government (Aldrich and Griffin Reference Aldrich and Griffin2018; Key Reference Key1949). When parties compete most fiercely, these incentives and advantages are magnified. Close competition between two parties in a statehouse leads to investments in human capital and infrastructure, with these investments later paying off for the wealth, health, and educational attainment of state residents.\n\nIn this new quantitative historical analysis of data on all 50 states, we test whether party competition has—by facilitating public investments—led to more robust levels of economic growth, higher levels of education and literacy, lower infant mortality rates, and longer life spans. We separate our empirical tests into two linked questions. First, does party competition lead states to invest in human capital and infrastructure, spending more on policies promoting education, health, and transportation? Next, following the patterns identified in cities and regions by Cutler and Miller (Reference Cutler and Miller2005), Kunitz (Reference Kunitz2015), and Chetty et al. (Reference Chetty, Stepner, Abraham, Lin, Scuderi, Turner, Bergeron and Cutler2016), do these investments by states pay off in future levels of well-being and development?\n\nWe leverage our historical approach to provide a research design that is better suited to causal inference than a cross-sectional snapshot analysis of the modern era, which could confound institutional differences across states with other, unmeasured features. Instead, we employ the “difference-in-differences” approach used in recent historical, comparative works showing how shifts in political factors within nations over time led to changes in economic development (Acemoglu et al. Reference Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson2019) and school enrollment (Paglayan Reference Paglayan2021). In these studies, the models include country fixed effects to hold constant the distinct features of a nation, isolating the impact of changes within that nation over time, and include year fixed effects to hold constant common shocks or trends that could account for secular trends across all nations. Analogously, we estimate difference-in-differences models that include state and year fixed effects to study patterns across the 50 American states at 10-year intervals from 1880 to 2010, looking at both their spending choices and a range of key policy outcomes.\n\nAnalyzing a broad array of data, we find that states with competitive party systems do, in fact, spend more on education, health, and transportation. We then find that this spending leads to longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, better educational outcomes, and, in the pre–New Deal era, higher incomes. Thus we discover that party competition is not just healthy for a political system but for the life prospects of a state’s residents."
