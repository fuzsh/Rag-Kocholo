        "text": "I first encountered Jeremiah Haralson as I worked on a story on Alabama’s bicentennial in November. While researching a section about Reconstruction, I found a few online biographies of Haralson that outlined an exceptional life. Each of these ended the same way: he had become involved in coal mining in Colorado and was killed by wild beasts in 1916. This struck me as odd. The manner of death was bizarre, and it seemed unlikely a man who had worked as a farmer and a civil servant had the money to open a mine, or – at age 70 – had the physical stamina to become a coal miner. I was curious to see if I could find anything about it in contemporary records or newspaper accounts.\n\nThis one question led to months of research through online sources and the Alabama Department of Archives and History, as well as document requests sent all around the country. Early in the research I learned of Haralson’s 1894 trial in Little Rock, Arkansas; some digging led me to the National Archives at Fort Worth, which provided me copies of the documents in Haralson’s court file. I spent a great deal of time trying to trace the origins of the wild beasts story, which eventually led me to the 1928 Biographical Directory of Congress compiled by Ansel Wold and his staff; I wrote to the Office of the Historian of the U.S. House of Representatives to see if the files collected by Wold survived, and they generously shared the documentation, which gave insight (and raised questions about the credibility of the tale).\n\nThe vast majority of the story came from newspaper articles published between 1868 and 1900 on newspapers.com. This posed a challenge. Most newspapers in Alabama at the time were owned by Democrats and were unrelentingly hostile toward Haralson and other African-American politicians. But amid the bias and rage were valuable pieces of information, I did my best to sift through the rhetoric. The Montgomery Advertiser and the Selma Times were my chief sources for Alabama (though they need to be used cautiously). The State Journal, published in Montgomery at the time, was one of the few Republican newspapers in the state, though it turned on Haralson during the 1876 campaign.\n\nI refer to Haralson as “Jeremiah” throughout this piece. During his lifetime, Haralson appears to have referred to himself as “Jere;” he signed letters and court documents as “Jere Haralson” and newspaper accounts usually referred to him by that name. Whitefield McKinlay, who knew Haralson, told congressional researchers in the 1920s that Jeremiah was his “real name,” and I have chosen to use that to reference him.\n\nRead Jeremiah's story: The lost congressman\n\nIntroduction\n\nHaralson testified before a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Privileges and Elections on Feb. 13 and 14, 1877. His testimony provides a rare glimpse of on-the-ground politics at the end of the Reconstruction era, and provides some valuable personal insights. Malcolm Graham, who also testified at the hearing, is buried in Montgomery’s Oakwood Cemetery. Haralson’s papers challenging Charles Shelley’s election have also survived; these papers contain depositions (mostly taken in the late winter and early spring of 1877) from witnesses on Haralson’s behalf, as well as Shelley’s response and his own witnesses.\n\nFrederick Douglass recorded his impressions of Haralson in a May 2, 1872 article in his New National Era newspaper, printed in Washington D.C. Haralson made his joke about the activist in his 1877 testimony before the U.S. Senate subcommittee. The Selma Times reported Haralson’s comments about marriage in an August 15, 1876 article (and seemed to struggle to control its rage over them).\n\nTwice a piece of merchandise to white slaveholders\n\nHaralson’s congressional biography was first printed in the congressional directory in December 1875, and appears to have been unchanged through revisions in 1876. Ben Perley Poore, the clerk of printing records for the House, wrote in an introduction to the December 1876 edition of the directory that said congressional members supplied their biographical information “in response to circulars sent them by the direction of the Joint Committee on Public Printing, as it could not be obtained in any other way.”\n\nFor background on slavery in Muscogee County, see Anthony Gene Carey's \"Sold Down the River: Slavery in the Lower Chattahoochee Valley of Alabama and Georgia\" (Tuscaloosa; University of Alabama Press, 2011). Databases on ancestry.com provided Census records and slave schedules from 1850 and 1860 that shed some light on Haralson’s youth in slavery. I also searched newspapers from Columbus, Georgia, during Haralson’s childhood hosted by the University System of Georgia to try to learn what I could about the men who held Haralson in bondage. The Columbus Enquirer ran a brief (but hostile) biographical profile that was reprinted in the Atlanta Constitution on Feb. 9, 1876; much of it appears derived from Haralson’s official congressional biography. The article identifies Haralson as a field hand, a likely possibility in Muscogee County at the time.\n\nSearches of Census records and Columbus newspapers in the 1840s and 50s brought up multiple men named John Walker who owned slaves, and a clear match to Haralson's first owner was not possible. Attempts to find an account of Haralson’s sale through the numerous advertisements for slaves in the Columbus newspapers of the time were unsuccessful. John W. Thompson appears in in the 1850 census in Columbus and in multiple newspaper accounts of the time, serving on various committees. A search on findagrave.com suggested Thompson died on June 28, 1858. This seems to be buttressed by an Aug. 3, 1858, notice in the Columbus Enquirer signed by Thompson’s widow and eldest son and dated July 8, 1858, announcing they would administer Thompson’s estate.\n\nMattie Thompson appears as John Thompson’s daughter in the 1850 census. An ancestry.com search produced a marriage certificate for Mattie Thompson and Jonathan Haralson in Muscogee County, Georgia, on March 30, 1858. Haralson did not describe his acquisition by these people as a sale in his 1875 biography, and it seems likely the Haralsons inherited him, either shortly before Thompson’s death or after his estate was settled. Jonathan Haralson’s 1860 slave schedule can be found on ancestry.com.\n\nJacob Stroyer’s account of the sale of his sisters can be found in his 1885 autobiography, \"My Life in the South\" (which can be read here). Richard Busteed’s account of Haralson’s scars, delivered at a Republican nominating convention in August, were reported in the Aug. 27, 1874 Selma Times. The Winfield (Kansas) Courier reported on the scars on Haralson’s back in an April 20, 1876, article, one that was reprinted in other newspapers. Haralson made his remarks about the psychological impact of slavery in his remarks to the U.S. Senate subcommittee in February 1877.\n\nHow Haralson learned to read when so many in power opposed black education\n\nNo statement from Haralson about his life during the Civil War appears to have survived. Benjamin Turner filed a property claim in 1871 that provides insight into his life in slavery in Selma during the conflict (accessed on ancestry.com).\n\nFor African-American education after the Civil War, see James D. Anderson’s \"The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860 – 1935\" (Chapel Hill; The University of North Carolina Press, 1988) and Eric Foner’s \"Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution\" (New York; Harper Perennial, 1988). Haralson’s self-education was described in an unsigned article in Our Mountain Home, a Talladega newspaper, on April 30, 1873, which also noted that he was “quick to perceive the intention of his opponent in discussion.” William J. Stevens, a political ally of Haralson’s, also described Haralson as self-educated in a Jan. 12, 1874, article in Douglass’ New National Era, and Haralson described himself as “self-instructed” in his 1875 biography. Booker T. Washington’s account of his self-education is found in his autobiography, \"Up From Slavery,\" published in 1901. \"Boyd’s Directory of Washington,\" an 1877 directory, listed five teachers living at 1526 M St. NW in Washington, Haralson’s address during his time in Congress.\n\nHaralson described himself as a farmer in his 1875 biography. The marriage certificate between Ellen Norwood and Jeremiah Haralson can be found on ancestry.com. Henry Haralson is listed as a 9-year-old student in the 1880 Census.\n\n‘Feared … more than any other colored man in the Legislature of Alabama’\n\nHaralson was reported speaking at public events for Seymour and Blair in the Aug. 25, 1868, Selma Times and the Aug. 28, 1868, Livingston Journal. William Stevens said that this was a show in his Jan. 12, 1874, New National Era piece. It should be noted that the white-owned newspapers which covered Haralson’s speeches in 1868 did not give any sense of Haralson playing a double game.\n\nHaralson was repeatedly identified as a member of the Dallas County Republican Executive Committee through the 1870s, such as on flyers held at the Alabama Department of Archives and History from 1872 and 1878. A B.H. Howard described Turner and Haralson (referred to as “Haraldson”) campaigning in Monroeville in an Oct. 17, 1870, letter to Robert McKee, found at the Alabama Department of Archives and History.\n\nFor Haralson’s time in the Legislature, see the journals of the Alabama House and Senate between November 1870 and March 1875. The Montgomery Advertiser often reprinted portions of the journal in its daily coverage. Haralson offered his amendment to strike “challenge” during a Nov. 27, 1871, debate; the Advertiser reported his game amendment on Nov. 30, 1871. Haralson wrote in his 1875 biography that he defeated “Gen. G.W. Pettus Jr.” for State Senate; the Selma Times-Argus of Nov. 1, 1872, lists Edmund Pettus as the Democrats’ local candidate for state Senate. Haralson’s 1872-73 term in the Senate shows him introducing more than 50 bills, resolutions and petitions, including the civil rights bill. The Advertiser bitterly criticized the passage of the measure in its April 6, 1873, issue.\n\nA united Republican front behind his congressional candidacy helped win Haralson his seat\n\nFrederick Bromberg’s biography can be found in the online Biographical Directory of Congress. The Equal Rights Association met at the Alabama State Capitol on June 25, 1874; the divisions that ensued led to some of the state’s Democratic newspapers publishing the proceedings in detail. See, for example, the July 1, 1874, Weekly (Montgomery) Advertiser and the July 9, 1874, Troy Messenger. The Advertiser printed the text of the resolutions on June 30, 1874. The Messenger printed Haralson’s stated reasons for introducing the anti-desegregation language on July 9, 1874.\n\nHaralson described the harassment he encountered on the train to Mobile in his Feb. 13-14, 1877, testimony to Congress. He spoke on behalf of the federal civil rights bill in June 1874 in Mobile; hostile summaries of his talk were printed in the June 20, 1874, Columbus Enquirer and the June 25, 1874, Marion Commonwealth (reprinting an account from the Mobile Register). Bromberg, then over 90 years old, wrote a brief description of the election in a March 14, 1928, letter to congressional staffer Ansel Wold, who was updating the Biographical Directory of Congress; the letter is found in Wold’s file on Haralson. The U.S. House of Representatives’ summary of its findings on Bromberg’s complaint can be found here. Bromberg speculated in his 1928 letter to Wold that the large Democratic majority that year, combined with his Republican antecedents, made Democrats less interested in hearing his case.\n\nA list of African-American members of Congress from 1870 onward can be found here. Haralson defended his amnesty vote in a Jan. 19, 1876, letter to a “Cashin;” the letter was widely reprinted, including in the Jan. 29, 1876, Montgomery Advertiser. The Princeton Clarion-Leader of Feb. 10, 1876, published an account of Haralson’s confrontation with the House sergeant-at-arms. Haralson met with Ulysses S. Grant sometime in March, 1876; the Chicago Tribune of April 1, 1876, printed a brief account of Haralson denying a report that Grant had made a presidential endorsement at the meeting. The Inter-Ocean (Chicago, Ill.) printed an account of Haralson’s work for Bruce P. Thomas on June 8, 1876. Thomas registered to vote on July 17, 1867, in the Athens district of Dallas County. His grave in the Masonic section of the Congressional Cemetery can be viewed on findagrave.com.\n\nDivision in the Reconstruction-era Alabama Republican Party\n\nFor splits within the Alabama Republican Party, see the online Encyclopedia of Alabama’s entries on William Smith and George Spencer; Foner’s \"Reconstruction\" and Loren Schweninger’s \"James T. Rapier and Reconstruction\" (Chicago; University of Chicago Press, 1978). The Columbus Enquirer of Feb. 8, 1876, reported Haralson accusing Spencer of voting for Alabama’s 1875 Constitution. The Eufala Daily Times of Aug. 23, 1872, reported Haralson criticizing white Republicans locking African-Americans out of the spoils. The Smith faction appears to have used the GOP’s poor showing in the 1874 elections to justify to reorganization of the state party; see the June, 20, 1874, State Journal (a Spencer mouthpiece). Haralson made an apparent attempt to heal the breach that resulted from the RNC split in a letter published in the June 30, 1876, New York Times. Schweninger writes that Rapier began his campaign for the 4th Congressional District seat that summer.\n\nThe Selma Times claimed that Spencer was targeting Haralson in its August. 29, 1876, issue; two days later, it reported Haralson being “repudiated by a large portion of the radical party in this county.” The State Journal reported the proceedings of the Marion convention in its Sept. 16, 1876, including Haralson’s allegations of bribery; it reprinted a resolution denying the accusations in its Sept. 21, 1876, issue. The State Journal sided with Rapier through the campaign.\n\nHaralson’s recommendation of Charles Shelley’s appointment can be found in the papers of the Haralson-Shelley challenge; Foner notes that Republicans generally did not have the resources to put up bonds required to hold these positions.\n\nJoseph Gothard outlined his objections to Shelley’s appointments in a Feb. 14, 1877, deposition, found in the Haralson-Shelley challenge papers. Haralson described his respect for Rapier in his Feb. 13, 1877, testimony before the U.S. Senate subcommittee. The National Republican (Washington, D.C.) reported Haralson presiding over a memorial service for Rapier in its June 28, 1883, issue.\n\nCharles Harris gave a deposition describing the 1876 campaign on Feb. 7, 1877, in the Haralson-Shelley challenge papers. The State Journal accused Haralson of being handled by “white pimps” on Oct. 24, 1876. Haralson described being threatened by a knife in his U.S. Senate testimony.\n\nHaralson’s arrest is described in the Haralson-Shelley papers and in Haralson’s U.S. Senate testimony. Shelley claimed that there was no violence and that Haralson came to him without coercion and willingly signed the documents, but this seems dubious: several African-Americans who gave depositions in the case (for instance, Rev. M.E. Bryant on Feb. 1, 1877) recalled Shelley and other white Democrats using the papers to threaten Haralson’s black supporters. In addition, the Selma Times of Nov. 7, 1876, threatened violence against Haralson and anyone who supported him, while acting as if Haralson was still a candidate for office. Noah Moore gave a deposition in the case on Aug. 20, 1878, which can be viewed here.\n\nThe July 3, 1877, Weekly Advertiser quoted the Selma Times recording Haralson’s return (and its implication that his fears of lynching were overblown). Haralson gave the Senate subcommittee his prophecy about black voting rights in his Feb. 13, 1877, testimony.\n\nThreats from Shelley forced Haralson to flee to Washington with his family\n\nHaralson’s proclamation of Republican unity in 1878 can be found in a flyer stored at the Alabama Department of Archives and History. The Montgomery Advertiser of November 17, 1878, reported the vote of that year’s 4th Congressional District contest (including a suspiciously small number for Haralson in Dallas County). The New York Tribune reported Haralson being harassed and leaving Selma on May 4, 1879. (Shelley read this article in the congressional record and denied its contents.)\n\nThe New York Times reported Haralson’s appointment at the Baltimore Customhouse on Nov. 9, 1879. Haralson appears on an 1881 civil list making $3.50 per diem (accessed on ancestry.com) and in an 1883 list of federal employees as making $1,200 a year in the federal pension office. The Chicago Tribune interviewed Haralson after he arrived at the 1880 Republican National Convention on May 31, 1880. Haralson wrote to Secretary of State James Blaine on Dec. 17, 1881, requesting the return of all recommendation letters he sent for an application for a diplomatic post in Haiti; the letter is in the National Archives. (Regrettably, the recommendation letters do not appear to have survived.)\n\nAnsel Wold’s file on Haralson recorded him resigning from the pension office in August 1884; the Montgomery Advertiser reported Haralson attempting to win the regular Republican nomination for the 4th Congressional District in early September, leading to a split in the party. An extended biography of Haralson on the U.S. House of Representatives’ web site mentions the outcome of the 1884 race.\n\nWandering after the election and settling as a pension agent in Pine Bluff, Arkansas\n\nA search of public and Census records did not turn up any trace of Ellen Haralson after 1880. Tuskegee University confirmed Henry Haralson’s enrollment at Tuskegee in 1885-86 in a January phone call; Booker T. Washington made reference to Henry’s enrollment in a Dec. 21, 1885, letter. This is the last trace of Henry Haralson in the records. A “Henry Haralson” is recorded as enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1905. This Haralson said he was born in Brown’s Station in Dallas County. But he identified himself as the son of a W.H. Harrelson, a preacher in Alderson, Alabama, and gave his birthdate as about 1881, a decade after Jeremiah Haralson’s son was born and at a time when Haralson was working in the Washington D.C. area. (The 1880 census lists multiple Haralsons who were African-American in Dallas and Lowndes counties.) E.J. Lavender wrote to Ansel Wold in a Nov. 30, 1925, letter that Haralson had one son who “died in Selma Alabama about 37 years ago.” A recent walk around Selma’s Live Oak Cemetery did not uncover any graves for Ellen or Henry Haralson.\n\nJeremiah Haralson’s 1885 arrest was recorded in the Nov. 28, 1885, Selma Times and the Dec. 1, 1885, Weekly Advertiser. Haralson’s Jan. 18, 1886, letter denying any intent of slandering Shelley was published in the Jan. 20, 1886, Montgomery Advertiser; the Daily Dispatch reported his release on Jan. 30, 1886. The timing of the letter and the release raises questions about whether the letter was coerced.\n\nThe Weekly Advertiser reported Haralson at a Republican convention on Mary 24, 1888. The Montgomery Advertiser recorded his signature on the Conference of Colored Men Resolution on Jan. 12, 1889.\n\nDocuments and reporting related to Haralson’s 1894 trial state that he moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, some time around 1891. Haralson is listed as the attorney for Lewis Osbrooks on his pension record (accessed through ancestry.com); the first date on the record is Nov. 30, 1891. The Daily Arkansas Gazette reported on Dec. 9, 1894, that Haralson had “settled at Pine Bluff three years ago.” Carl Polk, a former Arkansas state legislator, wrote in a Dec. 17, 1894, affidavit that he had been acquainted with Haralson “for the last three years.”\n\nFor background on Pine Bluff, Arkansas, see the online Encyclopedia of Arkansas’ entries on Wiley Jones and Ferd Havis. Contemporary accounts of Pine Bluff can be found in “Pine Bluff and Jefferson County Arkansas,” published in May 1893 and accessible here. Also see “Racial Possibilities as Indicated by the Negroes of Arkansas,” written by David Gaines in 1898, which can be found here. For the 1890 pension law and the difficulties African-Americans encountered claiming benefits, see Larry Logue and Peter Blanck’s excellent article, “’Benefit of the Doubt’: African-American Civil War Veterans and Pensions,” published in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Winter, 2008. Carrie Kiewitt’s 1996 article, “A Study of Fraud in African-American Civil War Pensions” is also valuable.\n\nThe trial of Jeremiah Haralson: 16 charges of violating pension laws\n\nThe federal court file on Haralson was obtained from the National Archives at Fort Worth, Texas. The file mostly contains documents filed by Haralson’s defense team, but it also includes the original indictment, the sentencing order and records of Haralson’s delivery to Albany, New York. The Daily Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock, Arkansas, covered both the trial and the sentencing.\n\nBackground information on Lewis Osbrooks was pulled from Census records and military service records on ancestry.com. Information on pensions and prosecutions for pension fraud was found in the Report for the Commissioner of Pensions for 1895, found here. A pension examiner named George Crutchfield based out of Memphis is mentioned in “African American Veterans, the Memphis Region, and the Urbanization of the Postwar South” by Andrew Slap, published in \"Confederate Cities: The Urban South During the Civil War Era\" (Chicago; the University of Chicago Press, 2015). The Daily Arkansas Gazette identified a “Pension Examiner Crutchfield” as identifying fraud in the filings during Haralson’s trial, and Osbrooks was recorded living next to a number of Crutchfields in the 1900 Census.\n\nWaters’ filings on Haralson’s behalf and Mary Sherrelly’s affidavit (dated Dec. 17, 1894) are found in the federal court file. Judge Edgerton rejected the defense’s request for continuance and later, a new trial, but neither the court file nor contemporary press accounts provide any reasons for his decision. Ferd Havis and Wiley Jones both signed Haralson’s bond, as seen in the court file, and the Gazette reported Mifflin Gibbs testifying on Haralson’s behalf.\n\nW. Bowen Moore and George Van Leuven were both cited in the 1895 U.S. Attorney General’s report; Van Leuven received a pardon for health reasons the following year. The Quad City Times of April 16, 1896, reported Van Leuven being in improved health afterward. The Buffalo Commercial of April 22, 1896, reported Moore moving about freely.\n\nThe Albany County Penitentiary made regular reports to the Albany County Board of Supervisors in the late 19th and early 20th century, recording conditions in the prison. The Prison Association of New York reported on black workers in the prison in its 1894 report, viewable here.\n\nThe signed March 25, 1895, document recording Haralson’s arrival in Albany is the last record I could find of Haralson alive. A contemporary record of daily prison entries at Albany on or around March 25, 1895 only lists New York State prisoners. Albany County’s annual reports listed one prisoner (presumably Haralson) incarcerated for pension law violations in 1895, and two in 1896, but Haralson is not named and does not appear on any reports of dead inmates. The U.S. Attorney General’s Office regularly listed presidential pardons in its annual reports; Haralson's name does not appear on any pardon lists between 1895 and 1903. The U.S. Attorney General’s Office noted its inability to check on the condition of federal inmates in state prisons in its 1896 report. In response to an emailed request in January, the Colorado Department of Vital Records said they had no death certificate for Jeremiah Haralson. In response to two inquiries, the Albany County Hall of Records said it did not have any records of Haralson’s entrance or exit from the prison. The Advertiser has requested a 46-page file on Haralson’s case identified at the National Archives.\n\nThe Montgomery Advertiser said Haralson was dead in a Sept. 7, 1901, article, but it provided no source for the assertion, or date of death. The New York Age said on Dec. 9, 1933, that Haralson (who would have been 87 at the time) was a minister in the west, but provided no evidence. For the issues with the 1928 biography, see “Wild Beasts: The strange story of Jeremiah Haralson’s ‘death.’”\n\nContact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com."
