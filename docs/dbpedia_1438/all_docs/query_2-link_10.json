        "text": "The manner of electing a national president sparked one of the most contentious debates at the federal Constitutional Convention. The convention rejected direct election of the president by “the people,” in favor of a system of electors equal to the number of senators and representatives and to be chosen by the states. Designed to insulate the electors from undue influence, the system required that they cast independent votes for president and vice president.\n\nLeaders of the Federalist and Jeffersonian Republican parties knew that the key to the presidential election of 1800 was controlling the manner of selecting the electors. In this letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson outlines plans for manipulating the selection of presidential electors in the key states of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n\nAs the campaign for the presidential election of 1800 was about to begin, Thomas Jefferson wrote a long “profession of my political faith” to Elbridge Gerry (1744–1814) of Massachusetts. Although Jefferson formally insisted it be kept private, it is clear that he expected Gerry to circulate this letter among friends to assure them of Jefferson’s steadfast belief in republicanism and the federal Constitution.\n\nThis patriotic engraving was created just before the contentious election of 1800, in which Thomas Jefferson defeated John Adams. The sixteen states then in the union surround President Adams. Below each state's seal are its population and number of senators and representatives.\n\nOver the top is the defiant motto, \"Millions for our Defense Not a Cent for Tribute,\" a slogan that became popular during the late 1790s when the U.S. expected tensions with its Revolutionary War ally France. Americans were angered by French demands for tribute and France's seizures of U.S. merchant ships.\n\nWithin a decade of deciding to move the new federal capital to the banks of the Potomac River, the city of Washington, District of Columbia began to emerge out of partisan politics and a tidal marsh. The federal city had just begun to take shape when the government moved there in 1800. This engraving provides a view of Washington and then neighboring Georgetown.\n\nBefore the site of the new capital was carved out of Maryland and Virginia, the land was a largely rural area of trees and farms along the Potomac River. Two small port towns, Georgetown, Maryland, and Alexandria, Virginia, were originally included in what is today known as the “District of Columbia.” This 1795 view shows the area along the Potomac River looking toward the future site of the Federal City.\n\nAfter learning of the Republican victory in New York City, Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton (1757–1804) argued that unity behind their candidates, John Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (1746–1825) of South Carolina, was “the only thing that can possibly save us from the fangs of Jefferson.” He wrote those words to Theodore Sedgwick (1746–1813), a Federalist who served as a representative and, later, a senator from Massachusetts. However, when the presidential election of 1800 ended in a tie, Hamilton supported his old rival Jefferson against fellow New Yorker Aaron Burr.\n\nPublished in London shortly after the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty, this map is one of the first published in Europe to recognize the new nation's independence and the first to incorporate the United States flag into the iconography of the map's cartouche. Also included in the cartouche are the likenesses of George Washington paired with a figure representing Liberty and Benjamin Franklin paired with the figures of Wisdom and Justice.\n\nMysterious fires in the offices of the War Department on November 8, 1800, and the Treasury Department on January 20, 1801, kindled fears of civil unrest. With tensions already running high because of the hotly contested presidential election and a slave revolt in Virginia, many Americans feared that a revolt, such as those in France or Haiti, was about to break out in the United States.\n\nIn the aftermath of his defeat in the 1800 presidential campaign, in this letter to his youngest son Thomas Boylston Adams (1772–1832), John Adams accused some of his opponents of being “old Tories” or “British Agents” and others of conspiring to foment a war with France to secure changes in the federal Constitution. The only constitutional change that resulted from the election of 1800 was the twelfth amendment requiring separate electoral votes for president and vice president.\n\nThe Constitution calls for a federal district, separate from the states, to serve as the permanent national capital. The federal government located its new capital on land carved from Maryland and Virginia as a result of the Compromise of 1790, whereby some Southern representatives agreed to support federal assumption of state debts in return for a bill locating the permanent capital on the Potomac River. George Washington selected the site and in 1791 chose Pierre L’Enfant (1754–1825), a French engineer and veteran of the American Revolution, to design the new city.\n\nState and federal laws governing elections and citizenship are listed in this anonymous broadside, clearly published with an eye to the elections leading up to the national presidential election of 1800. In Pennsylvania, Federalists and Republicans battled to elect supporters for the state legislature so that they could control the selection of presidential electors. In the end, Pennsylvania’s electors split their votes between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1800, critics accused President John Adams of rushing to move the capital to the federal district on the Potomac River to court votes from the southern states. The President’s House was unfinished (Benjamin Latrobe’s plan to complete the main floor was done in 1807) and Abigail Adams expressed her fear in this letter that moving into an unfinished house “would prove his death.”\n\nIn 1800 Virginia and Rhode Island were the only states to choose presidential electors on a statewide general ticket. Republicans and Federalists distributed lists of electors to help voters to select their electors. These electors, pledged to Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, were promoted by the Republican Party in Virginia."
