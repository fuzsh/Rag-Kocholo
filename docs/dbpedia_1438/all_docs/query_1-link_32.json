        "text": "Start Date:\n\nAs part of the long-term planning process for Cama Beach State Park, a Special Commission meeting regarding the cabins at the park is being held on Mon., July 15, in Stanwood, Wash. Parks staff will present what we’ve learned relative to the complex issues facing the cabins and infrastructure in the beach area of the park.\n\nWe invite the public to comment in-person, virtually and/or in writing. Staff will ask the Commission for a decision related to whether or not the cabins can be reopened where they currently sit. The Commission will not vote on a decision in July. Written public comment will continue to be accepted until Fri., Sept. 27 at 5:00 p.m. The Commission will vote on a decision at their regularly scheduled meeting in October. Learn more at the Cama Beach project page.\n\nCama Beach Project Page\n\nStart Date:\n\nAs of Feb. 26, 2024, the cabins and restrooms in the lower area at Cama Beach State Park will be closed until further notice. Day-use in that area will remain open, but restrooms will only be available in other parts of the park. Significant parts of the septic system recently failed in the area, and the repairs will require extensive disturbance of the area, which has known environmental and cultural complexities.\n\nReservations will be refunded in full, and we’re very sorry for the disruption this may cause. We hope you’ll consider visiting one of the other parks in the area. As we continue to evaluate the site, it is possible additional mitigations or closures of parts of the park will take place. Please keep checking these alerts for the latest information.\n\nVisit our Cama Beach project page for more information"
