The collection also includes correspondence between Garfield and his wife Lucretia (\"Crete\") Rudolph Garfield; papers (1881-1889) of Garfield's daughter Mary (\"Mollie\") Garfield Stanley-Brown; and Garfield family correspondence.\n\nNotable correspondents include Chester Alan Arthur, Harmon Austin, Jeremiah S. Black, J. M. Bundy, Alexander Campbell, William E. Chandler, Julius Orrin Converse, Jacob D. Cox, John Jay Curtis, Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren, Ulysses S.

Robinson, John P. Robison, William S. Rosecrans, John Sherman, Platt R. Spencer, and Samuel Ward.\n\nThe Index to the James A. Garfield Papers, created by the Manuscript Division in 1973 after the bulk of the collection was microfilmed, provides a full list of the correspondents and notes the series number and dates of the items indexed. This information is helpful in finding individual letters or documents in the online version. Additional letters received by the Library after 1973 are not listed in this index.\n\nA current finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the James A. Garfield Papers is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nBrief History of the Garfield Papers\n\n\"General Garfield's habit was to keep everything,\" Lucretia Garfield thus described her husband's relationship to his papers in a draft of a letter to Mary Abigail Dodge, who was collecting the letters of Garfield's secretary of state James G. Blaine. Garfield's custom of keeping everything reverted to the preservation habits of his mother, Eliza Ballou Garfield, who kept the first letter he ever wrote her, which he titled \"The First Epistle of James.\" His deep interest in his own papers continued throughout his life, an interest perpetuated by his widow until her death in 1918, and then by his children.\n\nOn the backs of many letters will be found a note in Garfield's hand, \"To be preserved.\" His diary contains numerous references to his papers. He even arranged his wife's letters and sometimes identified the correspondent. From 1863 to 1869 the Garfield papers were kept in his office in the House of Representatives, at the various residences in which the Garfields lived in Washington, and in their Ohio home. In 1876, Garfield purchased a farm near Mentor, Ohio, subsequently known as \"Lawnfield.\" Gradually the Garfields enlarged the house, and a number of books and papers were moved to his office and library there. Garfield's presidency effectively ended when disappointed office-seeker Charles J. Guiteau shot the president on July 2, 1881. Garfield survived until September 19, 1881, and during the interval when he lingered, Lucretia Garfield took several actions which are now reflected in the Library's collection of Garfield Papers. She sought through the press a copy of everything printed about her husband. The clippings received as a result are now in scrapbooks labeled \"Eighty Days,\" the interval of the president's survival.\n\nFollowing Garfield's death, his secretary Joseph Stanley-Brown resigned as private secretary to President Chester A. Arthur to \"put in order and prepare for the biographer the letters, papers, and literary remains of the late President.\" The papers were finally prepared in 1885 and shipped to Mentor, where they were stored in a secure and fireproof \"Memorial Room\" added on to Mrs. Garfield's spacious farmhouse. Once Garfield's authorized biographer Theodore Clarke Smith completed his Life and Letters of James Abram Garfield in 1925, long-deferred decisions were made about the ultimate location of the Garfield papers. After numerous delays, James R. Garfield wrote to the Librarian of Congress on December 30, 1930, that he was sending eight boxes of papersâ€“150 bound volumes of letters and 10 of indexes. A second and third shipment followed shortly afterwards, with subsequent gifts and purchases following through 2000.\n\nA fuller history of the provenance of the collection was prepared for the Index to the James A. Garfield Papers, pp. v-xvi and was subsequently reproduced in the finding aid (PDF and HTML). A version appears on this website as the essay Provenance of the James A. Garfield Papers.\n\nDescription of Series\n\nThe James A.
