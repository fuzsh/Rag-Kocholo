If so, how will his death impact the relationship between Queen Mary of Scots and France?\n\nI'm counting on it (Charles also had poor health throughout his short life). At which point the relationship goes very far south; Henri believes that at that point, his 10-year-old son Charles is the legitimate King of Scotland, and he is Regent of Scotland until his son's majority (and on his death, France and Scotland will be in personal union). The Scots have...very different ideas on the matter. Mary and Henri will each regard the other as usurpers, Henri will send an army to enforce his son's claim, and that army will not actually accomplish much (except perhaps to make Mary and Elizabeth more interested in cooperation).\n\nBetween annihilating French Protestants, invading Scotland, and occasionally fighting Spain, Henri will be keeping his realm on something like a permanent war footing, with probably quite negative economic impact. On the other hand, he'll solve the Huguenot problem in a manner that makes his wife's massacres seem like small potatoes...\n\nWhy would Charles have any claim to Scotland? His brother Francis was married to the Queen, but Charles wouldn't have any right to the throne.\n\nI suppose he could arrange that Mary marry Charles when the Dauphin dies. I think she could consider it, as it was certainly suggested before she decided to return home. Catherine de Medici was also somewhat \"rivals\" with Mary Stuart and vetoed the idea.\n\nHe could also be bargaining on the fact that that Mary Stuart was forced to sign several dubious documents upon her marriage. One gave Francis the crown matrimonial (ie he would remain king if she died before him, he could also pass on the crown to issue by someone else should he have no issue with Mary). She also pledged the Scottish inheritence to the French crown should her line go extinct and also agreed to heavy financial demands to make up for the French paying her education as well as garrisoning Scotland. Of course she was sixteen and essentially signed these under duress, but we'd have to assume Mary is dead for any of these articles to take effect. And she'd still be very much alive in 1560.\n\nNow, marrying Charles to Mary and bolstering French troops to support their claim? That makes more sense. Elizabeth I is certainly going to be more pro-Spanish in this scenario, especially if Henry is more aggressive in supporting Catholic rule in Scotland and perhaps the eventual enthronement as his son and daughter-in-law as King and Queen of England, too.\n\nHenri already had great debts from the Italian Wars (some 29-30 million Livres) and I believe he was forced to declare bankruptcy sometime in 1559. Henri may have all these awesome ideas to smash the Protestants at home, protect his son's inheritance in Scotland, but he doesn't have the finances to pull it off. He's going to have to make strategic choices or else make some early financial reforms to bolster his income (which seems unlikely -- even Henri IV, as a reformist, changed the taxation system little aside from creating new ways to tax people, such as the Paulette). He's also going to have to deal with the rising power of the Guises -- he's not going to marry Margot to the upstart Duke of Guise. Sebastian of Portugal seems like a better idea. If a Guise gets a royal bride, it's giving them too much legitimacy IMO and will make them believe their station higher than it is. Henri needs to smack them down, not rise them up. His ideal situation is stabilizing the Protestant heresies, but letting the Bourbons and Guise factions bleed each other dry. But chaos in the provinces is not good for taxation purposes, especially for the Taille in particular."
