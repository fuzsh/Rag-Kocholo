        "text": "When the fourteen-year-old small, slight Catherine de' Medici arrived in France from Florence to marry the Dauphin, she wanted to make a grand entrance to the French court. So to increase her height, she commissioned a Florentine artisan to make a what were considered to be the first modern high-heeled shoes.\n\nThe wedding took place in Marseille on 28 October 1533. Prince Henry danced and jousted for Catherine. She was reported to have been pleased with what she saw, .The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to consummate their marriage\n\nThroughout his reign, Henry II excluded Catherine from influence and instead showered favors on his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Catherine became the Queen Mother of France after Henry's death of Henry II, of whom some people wrongfully accused her of poisoningReine Margot (1954) is a superb film that provides great insight into Catherine's personality with the great Jeanne Moreau as Catherine.\n\nCatherine introduced a wide variety of Italian foods to French cooking, including ice cream, sweetbreads, truffles, artichokes, broccoli, and spinach. Catherine, who was known throughout France as la Florentine, because of her hated family's association with Florence, loved spinach so much that any French dish which incorporated spinach was called a la florentine."
