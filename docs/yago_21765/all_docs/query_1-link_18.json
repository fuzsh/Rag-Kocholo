        "text": "Buckle up, this is a long one\n\nHey everyone,\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, considering that my coverage of Catherine de Medici ran to three episodes, this is also our longest Too Long; Didn’t Listen yet! I’ve put in links to the episodes where they break in Catherine’s story, in case you want to go back and listen.\n\nAre you a student or teacher who wants to use this outline to help build a lesson? Great! Send me an email for discounted access. Hit reply or email me at unrulyfigures@substack.com.\n\nBig thanks to Niko for painstakingly putting this one together. Enjoy everyone!\n\nEpisode 22: Catherine de Medici, Part 1\n\n·\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nListen now (74 mins) | It has been a minute, and I’m so glad to be back today with this episode covering Catherine de Medici. She is often maligned in historical circles, remembered as The Serpent Queen with a love for the occult. But as we’ll see, this is a somewhat unfair portrayal of her.\n\nCatherine de Medici\n\nEarly Life\n\nCaterina Maria Romula de Medici was born in Florence, Italy, on April 13, 1519.\n\nHer parents were Lorenzo de Medici, Duke of Urbino, and Madeleine de la Tour d’Auvergne. Both of them died soon after her birth.\n\nThe Medici family was a prominent merchant family in Florence. In the 14th century, they rose to become papal bankers and used their fortune to patronize the arts.\n\nCatherine was first sent to live with her aunt, and then in the Santa Lucia convent in San Gallo. She stayed there for three years and was educated in Catholic ritual and doctrine, but the conditions were harsh.\n\nWhen Catherine was around twelve or thirteen, Pope Clement VII and King Francis I of France arranged for her to marry Henry, Duke of Orléans, the French king’s second son.\n\nIn March 1526, at an early age, Henry and his older brother went into captivity in Spain after France suffered a military disaster. They were kept in squalid conditions and weren’t released until July 1530.\n\nPope Clement arranged Catherine’s dowry and trousseau, wanting it to benefit her new status as a princess of France.\n\nThe family ordered such enormous quantities of lace, gold, and jewelry that they levied a new tax on Florence.\n\nArrival in France:\n\nCatherine arrived in Marseille on October 23, 1533, dressed in gold and silver silk and riding a horse dressed in gold brocade cloth for the wedding.\n\nCatherine was adored personally by Francis I but the French resented her Italian heritage.\n\nDespite their marriage, Henry maintained a strong relationship with his mistress, an older woman named Diane de Poitiers about twenty years Henry’s senior.\n\nAugust 10, 1536, the Dauphin of France, Henry’s brother Francis and next in line for the throne, died suddenly at age 18 after a tennis game.\n\nAssassination rumors dampened Catherine’s reputation after an Italian man confessed to the murder under torture.\n\nCatherine, as the Dauphine now, urgently needed to have children with Henry or risk being put aside.\n\nOn January 19, 1544, Catherine gave birth to her first son, Francis.\n\nOver the course of twelve years, Catherine and Henry went on to have nine more children; seven survived to adulthood.\n\nIn 1545, Charles, Henry’s younger brother and Francis’s favorite son, died suddenly of the plague.\n\nIn 1547, King Francis’s health deteriorated aggressively.\n\nWhen it became clear to him in March that he was dying, he sent for Henry and spent days talking frankly and earnestly with him about how to rule.\n\nFrancis died on March 31, 1547, from various health complications.\n\nCatherine was devasted by his death and followed his example to become a supporter of the arts and project royal grandeur.\n\nQueen of France:\n\nHenry II’s coronation took place on July 26th, 1547. Catherine’s coronation took place on June 10th, 1549, in Saint-Denis.\n\nReligious factionalism reached France and the conflict cast a dark shadow over the festivities.\n\nIn 1548, Mary, Queen of Scots, arrived in France. She had been engaged to Francis, Catherine and Henry’s eldest son since she was a baby."
