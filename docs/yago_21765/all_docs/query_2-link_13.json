        "text": "The war between England and Scotland and France was ended with the signing of the Treaty of Boulogne. The English withdrew from Scotland. This allowed the French king, Henry II to concentrate on his enemy, Charles V, The Holy Roman Emporer. ยน\n\nThis treaty signed by Henry II brought peace with Charles V. France came out well in the deal as the three bishoprics, Metz, Toul and Verdun remained in their possession.\n\nIn the first week of January the French attacked the town of Douai on the Flemish border. This broke the Treaty of Vaucelles and war between France and Spain was formally declared.\n\nHenry II of France drew up some extra conditions for the marriage of his son to Mary Stuart. The princess was too young to understand the implications of them and signed in good faith. The secret conditions gave Henry II and his heirs a claim to the Scottish throne and England as well through Mary's claim. They also secured a payment from the Scottish revenue and a clause prevented Mary from trying to reverse the agreement in future. ยน\n\nThe defences of Calais had not been maintained as Queen Mary had been spending the country's wealth elsewhere and when the French laid siege to the city it did not take long for it to fall. The shock of losing Calais was felt all over England.\n\nAn agreement was reached between the Scottish commissioners and the French king Henry II for the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the Dauphin of France. The terms of the agreement allowed the Scots to maintain their traditional rights and would become united with France when Francis became King of France. It was also agreed that if Mary died without having children the Scottish throne would go to the Earl of Arran. ยน\n\nA peace treaty signed by both Henry II of France and Philip II of Spain bringing an end to the conflicts between their countries. Part of the treaty was the agreed future marriage of Philip and Elizabeth of Valois, the French kings daughter, who had originally been promised to Philip's son Carlos.\n\nHenry II, the French king, was accidentally injured during a tournament celebrating a wedding. He was taking part in a joust and the tip of a lance went into his eye. Infection set it and he died a short time afterwards. Henry was succeeded by his son Francis II, the husband of Mary Stuart. ยน"
