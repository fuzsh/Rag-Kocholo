        "text": "It is surprising how an Italian woman can greatly influence and modernize the French cuisine.\n\nDespite my fair share of efforts into the eating habits of my French husband and our household,\n\nthe woman I am referring to, is not me.\n\nSome 15 years ago, right after settling in the South West of France, I traveled for the first time\n\nto Saint Emilion and bought myself a whole box of macarons. They are not as colorful, as the\n\npopular ones for sale a bit everywhere in France – and now abroad too.\n\nThis particular macaron is made today with a recipe that hasn’t changed since 1620.\n\nBehind them is the influence of pastry chefs and bakers who came to France along Catherine de\n\nMédicis who left Florence at the age of 14 to marry Henry de Valois and eventually became\n\nqueen of France in 1547.\n\nCatherine was born in a rich family of Florentine merchants and bankers. Her parents died\n\nwithin the first month of her life, so that the most influent figures in her upbringing were two\n\nPopes, members of her family: Giovanni de Medici, known as Pope Leo X and later on, Giulio de\n\nMedici, elected Pope with the name of Clement VII. The latter not only interceded with King\n\nFrancis I of France for her to marry his second son, but also celebrated the wedding in Marseille\n\nin 1533.\n\nShe brought to the kingdom of France a rich dowry of gold coins and pearls.\n\nAnd possibly, an even more interesting cultural treasure in various fields: from the art of the\n\ntable and the cuisine, to fashion and perfumery (a fragrance concocted for her with bergamots,\n\nl’Acqua della Regina, still available for sale today!), her influence is still undeniable today!\n\nWhen she left Florence for Marseille, she knew it was a one way journey and she brought with\n\nher as much of Florence that could be transported: from fashion items (she loved hunting and\n\nhorse riding and for that she introduced underwear that allowed women to ride amazon style,\n\nand compensated her short size with high heels) to food and books of recipes, not forgetting\n\nthe people who had the know-how to execute them.\n\nMeals at the French court of Catherine included the ancestors of unmissable classics: onion\n\nsoup, known then as carabaccia, and vegetables with béchamel sauce, salsa colla (it was made\n\nusing olive oil instead of butter). She loved broccoli, peas, artichokes cooked in wine and a\n\nclassic of the French south west: asparagus!\n\nHer tables were decorated with precious cloths and the fork started appearing by the side of\n\nindividual plates not just as a tool to portion food but to eat it: forks were common across the\n\nAlps, but had not reached French tables yet. Meals started being served in course and savory\n\nand sweet were offered separately.\n\nFrench cuisine, that was still following on the medieval tradition, was brought forward into the\n\nrenaissance by the Italian taste of a woman who enjoyed a good meal, sometime a little too\n\nmuch to the point of paying for her sins of gluttony.\n\nIsn’t it peculiar to think of a woman of the 16th century as a very modern one? She would have\n\nnot made the pages of history if it wasnt for her inner strength, endowed with a fine intellect\n\nand enormous intelligence that allowed her to rule France more or less indirectly, for three\n\ndecades.\n\nDuring those years, France went through mysterious deaths, all in all poisoning was an Italian\n\ntradition back then, and wars of religions.\n\nHer contemporaries have been quite hostile reporting about her. Only more recently, with the\n\nperspective of time, historians have rehabilitated the memory of this woman, who tried to keep\n\nup the dialogues among various factions, brought the court of France on the road for over two\n\nyears and influenced European monarchies, behind the French borders.\n\nSo, going back to my macaron, they were first introduced to the royal table without a precise\n\nname, during the week-long celebration that followed the union between Catherine and Henry\n\nII who really liked this crispy biscuit that still didn’t have a creamy filling (that will arrive only\n\nfour centuries later!). The name followed in 1552 when French author François Rabelais\n\nassociated the sweet with its creators, the Italians, those eating maccheroni, with no\n\nderogatory meaning.\n\nAnd one last thing about her: while speaking French, Catherine never lost her Italian accent.\n\nJust like me!\n\nBy Simona PALENGA, Villandrauts own 21st c. Italian Queen\n\nREAD MORE :\n\nhttps://www.macarons-saint-emilion.fr/macarons/la_fabrique_saint_emilion\n\nhttps://www.history.com/topics/renaissance/medici-family\n\nhttps://culturacolectiva.com/fashion/history-of-high-heels-catherine-of-medici/\n\nhttp://www.asperges-blayais.com/les-asperges/\n\nhttp://www.eatingutensils.net/history-of-cutlery/fork-history/"
