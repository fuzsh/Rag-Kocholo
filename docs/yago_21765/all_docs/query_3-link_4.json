        "text": "Henry II (born March 31, 1519, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, France—died July 10, 1559, Paris) was the king of France from 1547 to 1559, a competent administrator who was also a vigorous suppressor of Protestants within his kingdom.\n\nThe second son of Francis I and Claude of France, Henry was sent with his brother Francis, the dauphin, as a hostage to Spain in 1526 and did not return to France until 1530, after the conclusion of the Peace of Cambrai. When the dauphin died in 1536, Henry became heir to the throne. Strong differences between Henry and his father were accentuated by the rivalry between Henry’s mistress, Diane de Poitiers, and the king’s, Anne, Duchess d’Étampes, as well as by Henry’s continuing support of the constable Anne de Montmorency, who had lost favour with the crown. Henry’s reputation has suffered by contrast with his father’s brilliance, and his melancholy made his character unsympathetic. Although he continued many of his father’s policies, he dismissed many of his father’s ministers and raised Montmorency and the house of Guise to favour.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nUpon his accession, Henry undertook administrative reforms. The functions of the different sections of the king’s council became more specialized; the commissaries sent into the provinces “to exercise the king’s orders” were the forerunners of the intendants; and intermediary tribunals were established between the local justices and the parlements (high courts). In foreign affairs Henry continued his father’s warfare against the Holy Roman emperor Charles V. He signed the Treaty of Chambord in 1552 with the German Protestant princes, promising them troops and subsidies; in return, they agreed to France’s taking the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun. Though Henry made a truce with Charles in 1556, war was soon resumed when a French expedition was sent into Italy under François, Duke de Guise (1557). The Spanish in the Netherlands, however, besieged the town of Saint-Quentin in Picardy, and Montmorency was defeated in an attempt to relieve it. After Guise had somewhat improved the situation by taking Calais, Guînes, and Thionville, the financial difficulties of both France and Spain and Henry’s desire to fight Protestantism in France led to the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559).\n\nA bigoted Roman Catholic, Henry was rigorous in the repression of Protestantism, which was approaching the zenith of its power in France. In 1547 he created the Chambre Ardente in the Parlement of Paris for trying heretics. His Edict of Écouen (1559) laid the ground for systematic persecution of the Protestants."
