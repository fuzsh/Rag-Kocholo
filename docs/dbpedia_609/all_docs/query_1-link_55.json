        "text": "Step 1: Lean as an Instrumental and Technical System with Negative Effects on Worker Health\n\n37Because of the decision phase’s turn of events, the first step of the implementation phase was designed on lean theory based on a methodology that adhered to key lean principles, scrupulously modelled on what had been done elsewhere, and involving carefully imitated, ‘formatted’ practices.\n\n38In Company A, the first step of implementation was a source of tension among employees as well as managers: “At the beginning, we first experienced phases that were somewhat summary, poorly prepared, poorly supported, which resulted in semblances of things, failures that ultimately destabilized the employees of the company” (A - HR manager). The focus was clearly on technical lean tools, and the human side was overlooked. This focus had a negative effect on employee wellbeing: stress for the managers who had to follow indicators with which they were not particularly familiar; unease in the operators and technicians who had to use tools and methods that did not make sense to them; employee difficulties in, or even resistance to, adopting unilaterally imposed methods; disinclination on the part of the workers and a tense work atmosphere between the workers who willingly used the lean methods and tools and those who were reluctant to use them.\n\n39In Company B, when lean was first put into use, no more than 10 people were involved, mainly employees in charge of production lines, technicians, and top managers. All of them attended training sessions led by external consultants. Implementation was difficult given the limited amount of managerial resources allocated. The lean manager, also responsible for purchasing, admits to becoming overwhelmed by the amount of work: “Many improvements could have been resolved through brainstorming and other lean tools. Unfortunately, I had a little bit of trouble keeping up because of my heavy workload in purchasing tasks” (B- Lean Manager). This difficulty was reinforced by the structure of the company, which has no middle management, and by values that are more declared than shared. Shared philosophy and principles of lean were not established within the company, especially because of the top-down decision to adopt lean. While some people associated lean with good manufacturing practices oriented towards customer satisfaction, others associated it with principles oriented towards productivity, quality or waste reduction. For some operators, lean represented something external to their workplace: “I don’t see lean in my work” (B - Technician). One respondent noted that practices related to continuous improvement, JIT or quality were not systematic: “I do not have the time to do preventive maintenance. It is a black spot” (B - Technician). Company B also saw lean as a solution to the growing problems of workers suffering from musculoskeletal disorders but did not consider the necessity of including HIPs. It only placed a strong emphasis on versatility, job rotation and autonomy to facilitate fast hand-offs and make jobs less difficult. Lean had no effect on schedules, but hand-off times were greatly optimized, as was working pace. This is one of the positive effects of lean on worker health, but it was low because Company B had not realized the consequences of the just-in-time phenomenon, through ignorance. “It may be a little tenser. Because in fact, the flow is tighter, so necessarily ...” (B - HRM).\n\n40In Company C, the first steps of lean implementation were marked by dissonances and misunderstanding about lean. For the CEO, ‘lean’ was just a word for a global process of continuous improvement or ‘only a theory’, not achieved in the field. He underscored the disconnection between the quality approach supported by the quality manager, and lean supported by a line manager. Lean philosophy was not shared throughout Company C. The CEO still believed that ‘experts’ (here, the quality manager) must think about the work while others execute. This lack of experience with lean led to oversimplification. This in turn led to the production and consumption of lean without an in-depth grasp of its underlying foundations. Few HIPs were in place, and they were not considered as necessary for lean implementation. Furthermore, the CEO “lacked a delegating style” (Consultant B) and there were some difficulties within the executive committee. ‘In short, it was a can of old crabs’ (Consultant B). Training and skills development were limited and disconnected from the lean process. The CFO denounced the mismatch between firm needs and training, noting the latter was “made to please everyone”. In fact, Company C had just begun to set up individual interviews initiated by the CFO: “We try to ask them questions, to target, with open questions, to make them talk”. This initiative surprised some operators, who were not used to talking about their work. Motivational incentives and recognition practices remained limited and widely non-formal. The line manager tried to increase daily team recognition. “Recognition? It is given every day by being present and available” and by promoting some employees “in relation to what guys have done ... but the board has unfortunately declined all my requests” (C - Middle Manager). Finally, communication and information sharing in Company C was largely informal: billboards near the coffee machine communicated training and “a mini corporate network that everyone can access to publish some interesting news” (C - CEO). The CFO reported a lack of management and several organizational dysfunctions.\n\nStep 2: First Difficulties Related to the Addition of High-Involvement Practices to Lean\n\n41As noted above, all three companies reported difficulties and negative effects on employee wellbeing in the preliminary stages of implementation: stress; unease in the operators and technicians; resistance to adopting unilaterally imposed methods; feeling overwhelmed, especially for managers; feeling helpless; work intensification because of just-in-time production; dissonances and misunderstanding about lean; lack of management support. These first steps led two of the three companies to re-examine the way that they managed its adoption. Therefore, HIPs were gradually integrated into lean practices and methods more or less successfully, depending on the companies.\n\n42Company A adopted several HIPs that were increasingly incorporated into the lean approach. Amongst these HIPs, Company A first adopted participative practices such as workshops to involve all employees in the new definition of work procedures. “When you are in a working group, you can be consulted. And, lastly, we can influence decision-making” (A - Operator 1). Second, the firm renamed lean to use an internal label: Atlas. “I think that the change of name is an element that nevertheless contributes to the appropriation of the approach. It was necessary to give a connotation from our universe” (A - Middle manager 1). Formal communication practices were developed, with meetings at several levels and time scales. The workshops organised around Atlas projects were also opportunities for discussions and for sharing information, achievements, shortfalls, and emerging issues. “The working groups around the Atlas pillars are motivating for them [operators]. They are meeting points, places for discussions. They are keen on that” (A - Middle manager 2). The employees valued the ‘bottom-up’ and participatory orientation of these workshops: “It’s basically top-down, we’re not going to hide it … except the workshops. That is why they are so important for them [employees]” (A- Industrial Director). Company A also developed a dynamic ad hoc training program focused on the Atlas approach. In 2014, 2.9% of the wage cost was devoted to training compared with 2.8% in 2013 and 2% in 2012. Some specific training was also developed for managers to help them to deal with Atlas practices, methods and indicators and lead working groups. Last, the degree of maturity both in terms of lean and HIPs of Company A was reflected by a growing awareness of the importance of including a grasp of health and safety issues. A specific pillar of the Atlas approach was developed on this focus, which became a central element. Specific indicators of health and safety were communicated and analyzed daily. Regular safety audits, effort studies and stress enquiries were performed. “In the Atlas program there are 12 pillars. The health and safety pillar is now the most important one. Therefore, yes, it is totally integrated” (A - Operator 3).\n\n43Company B put in use some lean practices, while maintaining a work organization in which the degree of employee autonomy remained limited, due to the precise standards, highly standardized procedures, and strict quality control system. Indeed, Company B can be considered as a hybrid system since it included lean practices that coexisted with a Taylorian philosophy and principles. Employees noted thresholds above which they had no decision-making power: “When serious problems arise, the decision is no longer in my hands” (B - Operator 2). The managerial maturity of Company B appeared to be weak. The lack of managerial practices was partly offset by managerial proximity with top managers. First, training and skills development was mainly based on a peer training support system. Trained technicians provided the basic tasks and procedures to operators in charge of production lines, who in turn provided their know-how and interpersonal skills to other operators. While trainers regarded this system as beneficial to their own work, trainees were more critical, considering that “training could include other aspects than [technical] manufacturing operations; it is something we know how to do very well!” (B - Operator 1). Social data confirmed that efforts in terms of continuous training did not increase during the 2012-2014 period. Company B had no annual individual interviews, motivational incentives or recognition practices because “the company’s management doesn’t want that” (B - Quality Manager). Employees expressed frustration and demotivation: “It’s really a lack of symbolic gestures. I would say that it discourages me” (B - Operator 2). By contrast, other employees saw increased responsibility as a benefit despite low wages. Furthermore, apart from billboards in the shop area, communication remained informal. A consequence is the overload of certain top managers or committees. In the absence of team or workshop managers, the chief human resource officer had to deal with all types of problems on the work floor. Moreover, the lean manager admitted that the works council, as well as the hygiene, safety and working conditions committee (HSWCC), had become ‘catch-all’ bodies because employees did not know from whom or where to get information.\n\n44Concerning worker health, practices such as versatility, job rotation and teamwork made work less difficult. However, all the health and security issues were entirely delegated to the HSWCC. Its annual budget amounted to €250,000 for 2014 (compared with €150,000 for 2012). In this context, quarterly meetings with occupational physicians and ergonomists were organized and seemed to produce positive effects: “I would say that about half the requests led to something” (B - Lean Manager). Employees were more critical as the focus was more on safety with the diffusion of information (about the right movements to use) and the acquisition of new machinery and equipment that made work less difficult but that were not often used. However, “what has really changed is the comfort of machinery and the workplace environment as it gets warmer” (B - Operator 1). The approach remained reactive and did not allow for the implementation of proactive solutions. “It must be said there are reactions when accidents occur. I myself will tell you, there is a lack of prevention” (B - Operator 2). Social data confirmed employees’ perceptions, specifying that the cases treated by the HSWCC over the period 2012–2014 focused exclusively on safety and workstation ergonomics. Health and safety issues delegated to this committee appear to be completely disconnected from the lean approach. Concerning health issues, working in Company B appears to have been physically fatiguing for operators (5/5) and stressful for managers (3/4). Absenteeism due to accidents at work increased substantially, from 65 in 2012 to 197 in 2014, despite the increase in budget allocated to improving working conditions. Employees perceived that efforts had been made about safety to comply with legislation, but little progress had been made on health: “There is no overall improvement on this issue” (B - Technician). Moreover, the lack of HIPs did not help the integration of this issue in the lean context even though “people [have] become more involved” (B - Human Resource Manager). The consultant’s report states that they “failed to anchor the lean and managerial routines’ and that Company B tended to ‘embellish the truth when they self-assess their lean maturity level” (Consultant B).\n\n45Company C was still at the beginning of the implementation phase five years after the decision to adopt lean. There was no vision or philosophy of lean shared among the CEO, the chief financial officer (CFO), the quality manager, the line manager, and operators. For the consultant who was working with the company, “The real job was at the board level. It was necessary to encourage people to evolve in terms of management”. He called on another consultant in order to bring more cohesion within the board but “things did not function well” (Consultant B).\n\n46First, training and skills development remained limited, disconnected from the lean process: “Training about lean? There isn’t any” (C - Quality Manager). Second, Company C had just begun to set up individual interviews initiated by the CFO. Third, communication and information sharing in Company C remained largely informal: billboards near the coffee machine communicated training and “a mini corporate network that everyone can access to publish some interesting news” (C- CEO). This network was not limited to corporate discussions but also contained current discussions. A survey on communication modalities indicated “poor communication between departments, ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’” (C - Quality Manager). A weekly planning meeting was organized but “sometimes cancelled for three weeks”, and “people come without preparation” (C - Quality Manager), making any progress difficult.\n\n47Working in Company C appears to have been fatiguing and stressful for top managers (2/3) and stressful for other respondents. Faced with these difficult working conditions, one top manager planned to change jobs. The CEO, on the other hand, considered that “working conditions are awesome in our firm!”, underscoring that the transition from a historical directive management to a participative one was still in progress. At the same time, the quality manager seemed less convinced: “I don’t know if it is linked with lean... Why not? lean and our own management!”. This shows that the combination of incompatible, even contradictory, practices destabilized all the company staff except the CEO. Concerning occupational health and safety indicators in the period 2012–2014, while Company C reported no accidents at work or occupational diseases, absenteeism due to illness increased from 18 days in 2013 to 26 in 2014. Expenditure for improving working conditions and preventing risks in terms of health and safety was not disclosed."
