        "text": "As of January 1, 2021, the World Bank has modified its practices with respect to the “Grounds” column of both Table 1 (“Debarred & Cross-Debarred Firms and Individuals”) and Table 2 (“Other Sanctions”). All entries posted after January 1, 2021 will state, in the “Grounds” column, the sanctionable practice for which the firm or individual has been sanctioned. The “Grounds” column will also designate whether the firm or individual is a controlled affiliate, controlling affiliate, or successor/assign of a sanctioned entity. Cross-debarred firms and individuals will continue to be identified in the “Grounds” column.\n\n---\n\nSuch sanction was imposed as the result of:\n\n(1) an administrative process conducted by the Bank that permitted the accused firms and individuals to respond to the allegations. Through July 2007, this process was conducted in accordance with the Sanctions Committee Procedures adopted on August 2, 2001. The process is currently conducted in accordance with Bank Procedure: Sanctions Proceedings and Settlements in Bank Financed Projects. For more information on the two-tier sanctions process go to Sanctions Management webpage.\n\nOR\n\n(2) cross-debarment in accordance with the Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions dated 9 April 2010, which, as of July 1, 2011, has been made effective by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American Development Bank, and African Development Bank.\n\nClick here to see additional notes on debarred firms and individuals and here to see an explanatory note on the application of cross-debarment.\n\nThe Bank may also apply other actions to firms and individuals that do not result in debarment. For the current list, see Table 2: Other Sanctions which is located further down this page.\n\nTo report allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank-financed projects, please contact the Integrity Vice Presidency.\n\nTable 1: Debarred & Cross-Debarred Firms & Individuals\n\nThe firms and individuals listed in Table 1 below are debarred and thus ineligible to participate in World Bank-financed contracts for the periods indicated. The full scope of ineligibility resulting from debarment is described in the Bank Procedure: Sanctions Proceedings and Settlements in Bank Financed Projects (see Section III.A, sub-paragraph 9.01(c)). These entities are ineligible as a result of prohibited conduct defined in the applicable Procurement or Consultant Guidelines or in the World Bank Procurement Regulations for Investment Project Financing Borrowers; different guidelines may apply depending on the project at issue. More information on the basis of each entity’s sanction is available in the “Grounds” column and/or in the Notes on Debarred Firms and Individuals PDF.\n\nNote: To obtain the best results when performing a search, it is advised that only a portion of the firm/individual name be entered. This allows for the greatest chance of seeing all sanctioned entities with names close to or exactly as those being searched. For example, to search for:\n\nC.V. ABCD, enter ABCD;\n\nABCD Engineers SRL, enter ABCD or ABCD Engineers; or\n\nABCD Royal Consulting Co., enter ABCD, or ABCD Royal, or Royal Consulting\n\nPlease also avoid accentuated characters and generic terms such as: Ltd.; Limited; Corp.; etc. Also note that this site works best when using Chrome as browser."
