        "text": "THE TOURNAMENT: WTA INTERNATIONAL Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem\n\nFrom 015/01 to 05/07\n\nMoney prize: $ 226,750\n\nSurface: Clay Outdoor\n\nLocation: Société Wifaq Tennis Rabat S.A , Km 6,8 Route des Zaers Lot Ambassador , Rabat , 20000, Morocco\n\nHow to get: Tennis courts are far about 10 km from famous Rabat’s Hassan Tower.

It is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and the medina of Rabat is listed as a World Heritage Site. Lonely Planet writes about this town: “Morocco’s political and administrative capital may be short on top-drawer tourist attractions, but it compensates with plenty of charm. The Ville Nouvelle’s palm-lined boulevards are clean, well kept and relatively free of traffic – a blessed relief for those who have spent time in Casablanca. There’s a clean central beach, an intact and evocative kasbah, and an attractive walled medina that is far less touristy than those in other large cities. All in all, the city is a good choice for a short sojourn.”\n\nTOP 3 ATTRACTIONS IN RABAT:\n\nHassan Tower\n\nMohammed V Mausole\n\nKasbah des Oudaias\n\nBEST PLACES TO STAY:\n\nHotel des Oudaias.
