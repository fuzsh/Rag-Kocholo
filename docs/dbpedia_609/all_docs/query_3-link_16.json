Vaclav Intl Airport is situated at 17,5 km from venue (30 minutes taxi ride).\n\nPast champions: 2016 Antonia Lottner (Ger) – 2015 Maria Teresa Torro Flor (Esp)\n\nEntry list: Marketa Vondrousova (Cze) – Evgeniya Rodina (Rus) – Richel Hogenkamp (Ned) – Denisa Allertova (Cze) – Irina Khromacheva (Rus) – Jasmine Paolini (Ita) – Dalila Jakupovic (Slo) – Elitsa Kostova (Bul) – Rebecca Sramkova (Svk) – Lucie Hradecka (Cze)\n\nTHE TOWN: Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. Founded during the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque eras, Prague was the capital of the kingdom of Bohemia and the main residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably of Charles IV.

It is home to a number of famous cultural attractions and from 1992 the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nLonely Planet’s writer explains the reasons why he loves so much this town: “How can you not love a city that has a pub with vinyl cushions on the wall above the gents’ urinal, so you can rest your head while you ‘go’? Where you can order a beer without speaking, simply by placing a beer mat on the table? And where that beer is probably the best in the world? But it’s not just exquisite ale and a wonderfully relaxed drinking culture that keep bringing me back to Prague. There’s also wit and weirdness in equal measure: a public fountain where two figures pee in a puddle, spelling out literary quotations; a 1950s nuclear bunker hidden beneath a city centre hotel; and a cubist lamppost. Quirky doesn’t even begin to describe it.”\n\nTOP 5 ATTRACTIONS:\n\nCharles Bridge\n\nOld Town Square\n\nSt. Vitus Cathedral\n\nPrague Castle\n\nAstronomical Clock Tower\n\nBEST PLACES TO STAY:\n\nCloister Inn Hotel.
