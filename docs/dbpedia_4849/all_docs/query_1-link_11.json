        "text": "Contact Joel\n\nResponsibilities: My primary responsibility is that of the caretaker of the Camp Tecumseh YMCA culture. This includes everything from year-round staff hiring, to involvement on programmatic changes, to facility and grounds decisions to sharing the mission of camp with our community. I absolutely love telling the Camp Tecumseh story and touring folks around camp whether for the first time or after being away for decades.\n\nCamp Experience: I have worked full-time at Camp Tecumseh since 2007, for six summers each as the Day Camp Director and Summer Camp Director and two years as the Associate Executive Director. I started as CEO in 2021. Prior to Camp Tecumseh I worked as the Day Camp and Youth Sports Director for the Chicago YMCA and served as a counselor. I also worked as a counselor at both Camp Tecumseh and the Decatur (IL) YMCA during high school and college.\n\nPassionate about: Telling the Camp Tecumseh story to anyone who will listen. This includes community leaders, alumni, donors, and others. It sounds cliche, but camp really does change lives and I love to talk about it.\n\nMost important lesson Camp teaches: You are loved! God loves each and every one of us and wants to have a relationship with us.\n\nFavorite Hobby: Basketball. It may be cliche given my above average height, but I love watching, playing and talking about basketball.\n\nFavorite Family Activities: My family loves to be outside – hiking, campfires, and riding bikes. My wife and I enjoy playing board games.\n\nHow have I helped someone else: While working for the YMCA in Chicago, I performed CPR on a member on the racquetball court which led to the man surviving.\n\nBucket List: Snorkel the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nWhat do you want to learn: The ukulele. I’m not terribly musical, but would love to be able to play at camp. Plus, a big guy holding a “tiny guitar” makes a great impression!\n\nJoel Recommends: Talking to people face-to-face rather than via email or text. Wow, wouldn’t the world be so much better if people just sat down and talked to each other seeking to understand where each person was coming from?\n\nJoel lives at Camp Tecumseh with his wife Renee, son Elijah and daughter Ayla. Joel graduated from Calvin College (Michigan) with a degree in Psychology and Recreation. After growing up around the YMCA, Joel has worked for the Y since age 15. Joel served on the YMCA Mid America Camping Conference Committee for 10 years and was the committee chair in 2014. Joel has attended and led various YMCA-USA trainings and currently holds his “Organizational Leader” certificate.\n\nContact Stacey\n\nResponsibilities: Annual fund & capital fundraising.

Member of the Senior Leadership Team. Point person for ACA Accreditation.\n\nCamp experience: As a directionless young adult from a foreign land, I signed up for one summer of fun in 1999! Little did I know how much it would change my life. The camp journey led me through twenty consecutive Camp Tecumseh summers, filled with deep friendships, positive growth and endless learning. I poured myself into different positions as counselor, coordinator, asst. dir of the leadership center, village director, outdoor ed director and director of programs. After a few years away, I’m glad to be back helping create positive, growth filled experiences again.\n\nPassionate about: Helping others feel included, valued, and connected.\n\nCamp teaches us all how to: Love God, others, and ourselves well.\n\nFavorite series: The West Wing.

Katrina and I met at camp, she fell for the accent (it was the only thing I had going for me) and we married a year later. We have three kids (two teenagers – Ouch!) and live in West Lafayette outside of the summer season. We all love being part of this positive, inspirational community.\n\nContact Dayna\n\nResponsibilities: Working with the Overnight Camp Director to recruit and hire staff that will be role models to our campers, Working with new and returning mentor groups to provide the camp experience to bring many kids to camp.

We see that growth summer after summer in our campers who brave new things everyday without fear of failure. We see it in our staff who truly believe in the impact of camp and want to give every kid the best experience. And we see it in ourselves, constantly working harder to improve how we support our staff so they can give their all to our kids.\n\nMaking Camp better: I have been given so many opportunities to learn and grow from full time staff and I want to give everything I have gotten and more to our staff so they continue to develop into their best selves so that they can make the best experiences with the kids that come to camp through any program.\n\nSpecial talent: Handstands. Or crying immediately when watching cute animal videos.\n\nHelping Others: Coming to camp. I have always wanted to work with kids and never found the right opportunity or put myself out there. Camp gives me the ability to make a difference in so many lives, including my own.\n\nTravel: Brazil to see my best friend or Ireland to see all of the green landscape, historic crosses and churches and experience an incredible culture.\n\nNerdy about: Science and nature. Hiking with me always takes twice as long because I have to stop so often to identify or ask questions about what I’m seeing.\n\nWhat to learn: To speak another language.\n\nBucket List: To have enough money to open an etsy store and try out all of the latest craft trends.\n\nDayna Recommends: Grey’s Anatomy. It’s full of helpful life advice, teaches people to be more empathetic and lets you have a good cry once in awhile… or every episode…\n\nDayna grew up in the Chicago suburbs with her parents and two sisters. She was a competitive gymnast for about 8 years, and began coaching recreational and pre team gymnastics shortly after. She now lives at camp and is blessed to have the best backyard in the world.\n\nContact Joy\n\nResponsibilities: Coordinating with groups to help them achieve their organization’s mission.
