Camping retreats in Almost Heaven are filled with one-of-a-kind experiences and lasting memories.\n\nBackpacking Escapes\n\nAwe-inspiring landscapes await you at these backpacking escapes in West Virginia. Grab your gear and get ready for a camping trip of a lifetime at these destinations. Starry night skies, the tranquil sounds of nature and unparalleled sunrises and sunsets all come along with these incredible backpacking locations.\n\nThis type of camping can be called by many different names car camping, established campsites, standard campsites, or basic campsites. These campsites allow you to drive right up to your spot or only have a short walk. This is great for people who are looking for a nice and easy get-a-way in nature. Either tent campers, campervans, or RVs can use a front country campsite.\n\nBackcountry campsite generally requires hiking into a remote area. Backcountry campsites are typically for tent camping only. There are spots where you can drive small campers into nature. Some backcountry sites have fire rings as well. Backcountry campgrounds will not have any facilities or running water. These take a little more energy to get to but the views you see on the way make it all worth it.\n\nPrimitive Campsites are very similar to backcountry campsites. These generally not have designated camping spots. These campsites are not maintained and do not include any amenities. These campsites are great for those who want to escape in nature. The majority of these campsites will be for tents only. Although you might be able to find a secluded spot for smaller campervans.\n\nGroup or Family Campsites are very similar to the front country campsite. The main difference is they are meant to accommodate a larger number of people. Depending on the side they can fit anywhere between 4-10 people. Most sites will include 1 or 2 parking sites, picnic tables, and a grill or fire pit. Some group or family sites are multiple sites side by side.\n\nThis is a great option for RVs and campers who want more amenities. Partial hookup campsites vary in what amenities they provide. A full hookup campsite is an RV or campervans area that will include water, electrical, and sewer hook-ups. Depending on the campground they can provide additional amenities for each spot. If you’re not sure what you need, a quick call to the campground will quickly clear up any confusion.\n\n7 off-the-grid camping spots in WV\n\nEscape the crowds and experience the remote, rugged wilderness of West Virginia.
