        "text": "On the evening of October 29th, 2022, Michael passed away in his favorite place on earth, the Little Blackfoot, doing what he loved most, hunting with his son, Wil. He was born on January 1st, 1968, shortly after midnight, in Helena, Montana to Susan and Mike Spotorno. Michael graduated from Helena High School in 1986. He married his wife, Leslie, June 15th, 2001.\n\nHe had many accomplishments, including building a business and fathering three children. He had a passion for hunting, sports, animals, helping people, and being a dad. He was a great friend to many. For people that knew him, he will always be remembered as someone that would put everyone before himself and do his best at anything he tried. He would light up a room and always knew how to put a smile on your face.\n\nMichael is survived by his wife, Leslie Wilson, children Sarah (Alex, Nova, and Atlas) Koerner, Chase Spotorno and Wil Spotorno, parents Mike and Susan Spotorno, brother Ryan (Drenda, Devyn, and Dylan) Spotorno, sister Wednesday Williams (Shane, Steven, and Connor). Michael leaves behind many beloved aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends.\n\nMichael, we love you and will miss you. We are thankful for the short time we had you in our lives. We look forward to the day we meet again.\n\nDonations may be made in Michael’s name to the American Heart Association, Lewis and Clark Humane Society, or any wildlife/wilderness organization of your choice.\n\nA memorial service celebrating Michael’s life will be held at 1 p.m. on Friday, November 4th at Anderson Stevenson Wilke Funeral Home, 3750 N. Montana Ave. A reception will follow the service at Chubby’s, 9 E. Clancy St., Clancy, MT."
