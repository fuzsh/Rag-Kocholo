        "text": "Chanda\n\nCertified Veterinary Technician and Hospital Administrator\n\nEver since she was a child, Chanda Holschbach had a passion for learning about, helping and loving animals. Her mother's nursing background laid a foundation of \"bedside manner\" and her father's entrepreneurial business background provided a real understanding of economics.\n\nA graduate of the University of Minnesota with a degree in Animal Health, family ties brought Chanda back to Wisconsin. She began her tenure at Packerland in 1993 and purchased the clinic in 2007.\n\nHer strong understanding of the business end of the clinic, in addition to her hands-on work with families and their pets, created the perfect recipe for Chanda to pursue the next level of patient care.\n\nAmy K.\n\nReception Coordinator\n\nAmy is Packerland’s Reception Coordinator and has been with us since 2002. She currently has one dog and 3 cats: Skips, Jordan, Daffodil and Cheddar. Amy was born and raised in Green Bay. Amy loves nature and all the beauty it provides and has the privilege of living on the water which allows her to enjoy many amazing sun rises and sunsets. When she is not working here, she volunteers her time for Keshena Animal Help & Rescue working with their spay/neuter/vaccination clinics.\n\nJulie\n\nReceptionist\n\nJulie was born here in Green Bay and, after graduating from high school, joined the US Army. She was enlisted for 12 years and is a veteran of the first Gulf war. One of our longest tenured employees, Julie has been a part of our Packerland team since August of 1998. She enjoys the challenge each day presents – learning new things, meeting new people and their pets and working closely with the staff. She loves spending time with her husband Rick and pets: a cat named Karma and new dog Rusty. She loves living out in the country in their new home.\n\nSusie\n\nReceptionist\n\nSusie joined the PVC family in 2014, but brought with her over 30 years of experience in veterinary reception and assisting. As a coast guard wife for 23 years, she moved every 4 years while on active duty and has been in the Green Bay area since 2000. She has 3 grown kids; a daughter and twin boys. Susie is crazy about her family! Her extended household includes her daughter Kat, her son Jason, his wife Liz and their very adventurous kiddos Tanner and Lexi. She has found a home at PVC and her knowledge and experience adds so much to our patient and client care.\n\nCerissa\n\nReceptionist\n\nCerissa (C.C) has a full, happy household of pets with her husband Dan. Tommy, their 7 year old Shepherd mix, is a devoted older brother to Frankie, their 5 year old Sharpei mix and Perdita (Perdy) their 1 year old Blue Merle Golden Doodle. They fostered Tommy as a puppy, eventually adopting him, and Frankie is sweet but energetic girl that joined them two years later. Perdita came to the family in 2021 at 8 weeks old and has completed their very hairy household. Their three cats consist of ‘big girl' Mimi, Sugar (who is as sweet as her name), and their petite but feisty Jewls.\n\nThe animals will often find a soft spot to lay in C.C's crafting room while she sews, or get under her feet to beg for veggies when she makes dinner at night. In addition to her pets, C.C. has a passion for Monarch butterflies. In the summer, she raises them from caterpillar eggs to butterfly. To date she has released over 700 into the wild!\n\nWhen you visit Packerland Vet, don't forget to say hi to Junior, the cockatiel in the lobby. He has been in her family for 10 years and is now also an extension of the clinic family as well.\n\nAlli\n\nReceptionist\n\nAlli grew up enjoying the great outdoors, hunting and fishing and had many pets from dogs and cats to hamsters and cattle. After graduating from Oconto Falls High School she tried a year at NWTC, but did not feel the career path was quite right. She then found a good fit here at Packerland and enjoys each day seeing all the critters and helping their families. Pets at home include Jake the beagle, Buck the chocolate lab, 2 cats Honey and Kansas and Tigger the hamster. She enjoys kayaking, camping, hiking, reading and watching comedies.\n\nBecky\n\nCertified Veterinary Technician\n\nBecky grew up on a farm in the town of Shirley which lead to lots of early experience in animal care. After graduating from De Pere High School it was only natural for her to transition to Madison Area Tech where she received her veterinary technician training. She has two cats at home, Henry and Aggie. When Becky isn't helping out on the family farm or spending time with nephews she enjoys reading, painting, baking, decorating cakes and video games in addition to many outdoor activities such as swimming, 4-wheeling, snowmobiling and jet skiing. She and her husband most enjoy spending time together backpacking in beautiful wilderness areas.\n\nBritt\n\nCertified Veterinary Technician\n\nBritt graduated from the Veterinary Technology program at Globe University in Appleton in March of 2014. She loves working at Packerland because of the wide variety of cases that we see each day. She particularly enjoys watching the improvement of our physical therapy and acupuncture cases and loves working with our doctors on advanced diagnostics for sick patients. In her free time, she enjoys anything outdoors with her husband, daughter, and family. She loves bow hunting and was fortunate to get an 8 point buck for her first deer! She shares her home with her senior cat Charlie.\n\nJaden\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nJaden was born in Vicenza, Italy and grew up as a military brat. In her free time she enjoys spending time with friends and family, reading and sleeping. She is a lover of all animals and wishes she could (and sometimes tries to) take them all in. Currently she has her childhood dog Odie, a 17 year old Chihuahua that she grew up with, who is still going strong. She also has Roman, a boxer, and 3 cats – Luna, Simba and Mama Kitten rounding out her household.\n\nBrooke\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nBrooke grew up around horses which lead to her pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Large Animal Science at UW-River Falls. She has worked at several boarding facilities as well as a research facility at the University of Minnesota. For several years she also worked as an assistant dog trainer.\n\nShe is a collector of hobbies, new music and crystals. In her free time she enjoys camping with her husband and stepson and is always up to try something new. She has three dogs that keep her busy – Willow, Raen and Zazz, and three cats – Moco, Ru and Mister Kitty, that keep her dogs busy.\n\nEli\n\nVeterinary Technician Assistant\n\nEli, soon after graduation from Wrightstown High School, decided to take up a job in a veterinary clinic. He is the son of a veterinarian and is often described as a romantic intellectual with a multitude of stories and ideas to share and has found that animals are often content to listen without judgement. Besides spending time with animals and telling crazy stories, he is most interested in the principles and practice of Parkour which is defined as the art of traversal between two points in space.\n\nCandi\n\nKennel Coordinator\n\nCandi had an office job, but after realizing how much she preferred working with animals over people, she joined PVC in 2021 and hasn’t looked back! Caring for animals is what drives Candi and what brought her to us. She is a lifelong animal lover who has found that her happy place is with rescue dogs. She has been involved with animal rescue for over 15 years. She has a long history with Green Acres Boxer Rescue and serves as a board member, foster home and volunteer for many events throughout the year. She has a special interest in fostering dogs with behavioral issues as well as medically needy dogs. She has fostered and placed over 100 dogs into their forever homes. When not working, Candi loves spending time with her husband, two kids and two dogs, Dozer and Stasha. In her free time she enjoys photography, hiking, crafting and kicking back for a lazy day at home."
