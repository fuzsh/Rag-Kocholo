        "text": "Home » About Us » Mission + History\n\nEisner Camp is rooted in a long history and rich traditions of excellence. A second home to 550 children each session, campers come together to experience the fun and magic of Jewish camping from across the Northeast.\n\nThe Eisner Camp Community (sometimes referred to as “The Bubble”) offers a fun, supportive environment where campers can explore, challenge themselves, and develop their passions. At camp, kids of all abilities and backgrounds strengthen their Jewish identities, all while surrounded by expert staff and beautiful facilities.\n\nOur caring and committed staff members (many of whom were campers themselves) strive to enrich the campers’ experiences by helping them build lasting friendships. These relationships provide encouragement and support and offer the opportunity for every camper to realize their full potential.\n\nOur campus-style facility and tech-free environment allow campers to embrace the challenge of learning new skills in athletics, aquatics, the arts, and outdoor adventure programs. Along the way, campers learn communication, collaboration, creativity, grit and empathy – the predictors of success in camp, school and beyond.\n\nIn addition to daily activities and special events, campers and staff immerse themselves in a wide range of innovative Jewish pursuits and creative spiritual experiences that are the soul of Eisner Camp. Campers from different backgrounds join together to create an intentional, meaningful community.\n\nFrom the youngest of our campers to the oldest of our Machon (Counselors-in-Training), every child who spends a summer at Eisner Camp returns home a wiser, more self-confident, a bigger part of our community and more connected to the Jewish community.\n\nEisner Camp is more than a summer of fun, it is an experience that lasts a lifetime.\n\nHineini – Here I am\n\n… I am here to strengthen my own self-esteem and that of everyone in the camp community.\n\n… I am here to strengthen my own Jewish identity and spirituality and that of everyone in the camp community.\n\n… I am here to strengthen my connection to the Eisner community and the Jewish community and to help everyone around me to do the same.\n\n… I am here to do as much as I can, in the time that I have, in the place that I am, and to inspire others to join me in this holy work.\n\nלֹא עָלֶיךָ הַמְּלָאכָה לִגְמוֹר, וְלֹא אַתָּה בֶן חוֹרִין לִבָּטֵל מִמֶּנָּה.\n\nFor it is written: “Lo alecha hamlacha ligmor, v’lo ata ben horin, l’heebatel mimena.”\n\n“You are not required to complete the work, nor are you free to ignore it.” Pirke Avot 2:16\n\nOur intimate (tech-free and parent-free) environment allows campers to embrace the challenge of learning new skills in athletics, aquatics, the arts, and adventure and nature programs. What campers don’t realize, is they are learning communication, collaboration, creativity, grit and empathy – the predictors of success in camp, school and beyond.\n\nIn addition to daily activities, inter-camp games, and special events, campers and staff immerse themselves in a wide range of innovative Jewish pursuits and creative spiritual experiences that are the soul of Eisner Camp. Campers from different backgrounds join together to create an intentional, meaningful community.\n\nFrom the youngest of our campers to the oldest of our Machon (Counselors-in-Training), every child who spends a summer at Eisner Camp returns home a wiser, more self-confident, a bigger part of our community and more connected to the Jewish community.\n\nEisner Camp is more than a summer of fun, it is an experience that lasts a lifetime.\n\nEverything done at Eisner Camp stems from a good foundation. Campers and counselors alike strive every day to embody our mission statement, which we believe help us to be the best selves and community we can be.\n\nHISTORY OF EISNER CAMP\n\nEisner Camp’s history dates back to long before it was a summer camp. Beginning as land inhabited by the Mohican, to farm to estate to school to summer camp, the property that is now Eisner Camp has a rich history as an important part of life in the Berkshires.\n\n1749\n\nRev. Samuel Hopkins becomes the first person believed to settle the land near 53 Brookside Road. Hopkins was the first pastor of the Congregational Church of Great Barrington. In 1788, Elisha Blinn bought the property to be used as farmland.\n\n1813\n\nDaniel Wilcox is the first person to develop the property and run it as a farm. Wilcox previously owned a water mill and clothing factory and built a house on the present-day location of the Manor House, as well as the avenue of elm and maple trees that line the driveway of 53 Brookside Road. Wilcox is believed to have owned the property through 1852.\n\n1852\n\nDavid Leavitt (sometimes referred to as Lewitt) buys the property and coins the term “Brookside Estate” or “Brookside Manor” as the name for the property. Leavitt held two esteemed positions during his career as the CEO of the American Exchange Bank and CEO of the Housatonic Railway. Leavitt took on incredible agricultural pursuits, but most notably constructed a cascading barn on the property which housed livestock, grain, farming machinery, and a saw mill. The barn construction was started in 1852 and cost approximately $120,000. In all, the barn was seven stories tall, two below ground and five above ground. There were few other structures like it in the country. On July 7, 1885 the barn caught fire and was burned to the ground. The livestock were saved, but most everything else was destroyed.\n\n1887\n\nWilliam Stanley purchases the estate. Stanley was an inventor and is best known for pioneering alternating current, also known as AC power. His most famous invention was the induction coil, a coil that makes AC current possible. In his life, Stanley was granted 129 patents for various electrical related products. Because of Stanley’s work, Great Barrington, MA was one of the first municipalities in the U.S. to have working electric street lamps. Stanley was the owner and principal of the Stanley Electric Manufacturing Company (originally part of Westinghouse), which was purchased by General Electric in 1903. Aside from his inventions in electrical engineering, Stanley invented the steel vacuum bottle in 1913, which we all now know as the “Thermos.” Stanley remained in Great Barrington until his death in 1916, but sold the property in 1908 to William H. Walker. Sometime in the early 1900s, Stanley’s house burned down and he began design and construction on what is now known as Manor House. After extensive legal battles over some of his patents, he suspended construction on the house and decided to sell the property.\n\nWalker also constructed a number of buildings including a ranch house, slaughter house, Italian style house, and carriage house that were said to have been in the style of buildings from around the country and world. According to camp legend, Walker built these buildings in a number of different styles of architecture to capture the spirit of buildings around the country and world. The story goes that his daughter Gertrude was wheelchair-bound and unable to travel, so Walker brought the world to her. There is no proof that Walker’s daughter was actually confined to a wheelchair. Many of these buildings remain and continue to be renovated to both sustain them and offer enhanced programming space. Walker passed away on Thanksgiving Day of 1917 and left the property to Gertrude, who lived there until her death in 1942. It was stated in William Walker’s will that the property be used in some form or fashion for the public good.\n\n1943\n\nThe Brookside Estate becomes the Altaraz School.\n\n1955\n\nRabbi Dan Davis, Director of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues (aka NYFRS, a region of the UAHC, now URJ), begins to collect information about potential camp sites throughout the northeast.\n\n1957\n\nDavis enfranchised Sidney Roos, president of NYFRS, and appointed Gilbert Tilles and Martin Cowan as the chairmen of the newly-established Camp Commission. Together, Davis, Roos, Tilles, Cowan, and others formed the site committee. According to the first camp brochure, they inspected more than 100 locations to try and find the perfect site for the new camp. Brotherhoods, sisterhoods, rabbis, and whole congregations gave money to support the purchase of the camp. Finally, at the time when all of these supporters were in place, the site committee inspected a private school owned and operated by the Altaraz family in Great Barrington. According to Cantor Norman Swerling, a former director of Eisner Camp, “As soon as they walked through the gates, viewed its buildings, and traversed its fields and gardens, the committee felt the magic of the place. Rabbi Davis knew that his dream had found a home.”\n\n1958\n\nThe committee established the Massachusetts Trust for the Camp Institute for Living Judaism in February of 1958 and officially purchased the camp on February 7, 1958 for $250,000. It was clear to everyone at that time that one name stood out among the roster of devoted workers and benefactors of the UAHC (now URJ) and the new camp: Joseph Eisner. In 1958, after Joseph Eisner’s death at the age of 57, the leaders of the Reform movement approached his wife, Helen Eisner, and asked if the Union could recognize Joseph’s connection and devotion to Reform Judaism by naming a camp in his honor. The UAHC accepted the resolution proposed by the Camp Commission and officially named the camp the UAHC Joseph Eisner Camp Institute for Living Judaism.\n\nThe camp officially opened its gates for its first summer in 1958 with Rabbi Leonard Zion as its first director. The brochure stated that Zion was chosen because he was “an expert in the training of young people.” He welcomed 173 campers and 18 staff members in this first summer. With little time to convert the property into a summer camp, the staff and campers lived among the property’s original buildings, including the chicken coops and Pink House. In addition, the property had no place of prayer. Thus, the founding camp class of 1958 took the initiative to build a sanctuary. They created a beit knesset in the old palm and orchard house on the quad.\n\n1959\n\nThe camp was formally dedicated in a ceremony widely attended by the leaders of the Reform Movement. To present Thousands of kids attend Eisner Camp every summer to play, grow, learn and to gain a sense of confidence and develop a strong Jewish identity.\n\n2008\n\nEisner Camp welcomes more than 1500 alumni to celebrate 50 years!\n\nWelcome to Eisner Camp!\n\nA Camp for Everyone! URJ Eisner Camp is a camp where everyone feels at home. We strive to make every camper's experience nurturing and fulfilling, and we do so by making sure that every child feels welcomed and supported.\n\nWhat happens at a URJ Camp? Camp is fun! Our campers enjoy engaging activities and programs, develop life-long friendships, and live with a super-star staff that acts as role models, living Jewish values-not just teaching them. When you entrust your children to us, they will experience what it is like to live in an immersive Jewish community. This complete immersion allows children to see the world through a Jewish lens, giving them a fuller appreciation of the richness of Judaism and strengthening their Jewish identities along the way. They live the Jewish values of Rachamim (compassion), Kavod (honor and respect), Derech Eretz (civility), G’milut Chasadim (kindness), Tikkun Olam (repairing our world), and so many more! And we know they’ll take these values home with them at summer’s end.\n\nWhat if my family isn’t very involved in Jewish life? Campers come to us from a variety of Jewish backgrounds. Some children come from families who are very involved in their synagogues attending Shabbat services regularly, and some do not. Some children attend Jewish Day Schools, and some attend Religious School only once a month. And everyone in between! We help our campers learn what they don’t know, and embrace what they do know. Living in an immersive Jewish community offers all of our campers the opportunity to strengthen their Jewish identities while learning more about Judaism.\n\nEisner Camp is a welcoming community for interfaith families who have made Jewish choices for their children, including Jewish overnight camp. We welcome children from a variety of backgrounds, and know they will quickly mesh into one community.\n\nWhat if my camper needs extra support while at camp? Camp has inclusion staff on site to work with campers who might need extra support and with the staff who will be caring for them. Before campers arrive at camp, we ask any parent who anticipates that his/her child will need extra support to complete a Background Questionnaire. This way, we can begin to prepare for the camper before he/she arrives. As necessary, our inclusion staff stays in touch with parents throughout the summer.\n\nTo learn more about Eisner for your child:\n\nContact: Paul Isserles, Director\n\npisserles@urj.org\n\n413-305-7780\n\n2024 Camp Brochure\n\nTOUR EISNER CAMP\n\nMeet the team, explore our beautiful grounds, and get a taste of what it's like to be a camper at Eisner Camp!\n\nEisner camp rookie day\n\nMeet the team, enjoy a delicious camp meal, participate in some fun camp activities, and get a taste of what it's like to be a camper at Eisner!\n\nProspective camper weekend\n\nAn opportunity for new and prospective campers to get a taste of what a summer at Eisner and Crane Lake Camps is all about.
