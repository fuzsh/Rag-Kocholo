Be Proud of your hard work and accomplishments. -Christine Maynard, '23\n\nCongratulations! You've just completed an important step in your life's journey.

I'm sure you know there will be ups and downs, and sometimes those downs will define your future...in a GREAT way.

Your degree will do great things for you and for others -Kevin Kasnick, '86\n\nThis is just a little note to let you know: YOU ARE an amazingly awesome individual! You DO Matter! You ARE enough!

I am grateful you are here and so are your fellow Beavers! Take Care!!! -Sarah Martinez, '08\n\nThere are no easy paths to get to where you want to be, and that's what will make all your suffering, trials and tribulations worthwhile.

I was a graduate student in what is now CEOAS in the 1970s. The best advice I received about graduate school was...it's a passage not a lifestyle. Get in, get out. The skills required to successfully complete graduate school will support you your entire career.

What you are doing -- taking classes online and juggling other many important responsibilities in your life -- is a HUGE undertaking. There may be days when you wonder if it's worth it. I'm here to tell you ... it is! I have worked at Ecampus for over 20 years, and every year at commencement, I am simply in awe of graduates I meet.

You are also an inspiration to others around you. Best of luck this fall term ... you've got this! -Jessica DuPont, '97\n\nRemember you’re still evolving - keep pushing your boundaries outwards beyond OSU and into the broader community.

I believe in YOU! -Liana Louie, '13\n\nHow can the tools you get from a broad education can be leveraged for a multitude of careers? At OSU I was an “unconventional” student; oldest in my class. I hadn’t planned to major in geosciences. I got C’s and D’s in STEM classes in high school!! One high school teacher wrote on my report card that I was, “…the gayest non achiever I have ever known.” I lived a few blocks from CEOAS and was interested in just taking one intro geology class. Then one more! It snowballed. To major in it, I was required to take physics, calculus, and chemistry in addition to the geology curriculum. Best thing that ever happened to me. Because I CHOSE to be there, vs being there because it was the default from high school, I worked hard and got straight A’s. I credit my success to the support of CEOAS faculty and to my co-students with whom I had study circles. We playfully competed against each other as well as shared everything we learned to make sure each of us achieved our individual best. Because of this rich experience I chose to prolong my education by staying in the department for an MS degree. I may not have gotten my dream job of geologic mapping and volcano research, but due to the depth of my education I am having the time of my life animating Earth-science concepts for an international earthquake consortium. -Jenda Johnson, '95\n\nWelcome to OSU! May your time here bring life-long connections, new adventures, inspiration and the opportunity to be the person you have always wanted to be.

Took awhile between being a wildland firefighter. Stay focused, driven and have fun. -Benjamin Clason, '20\n\nIt may feel like you're just going through the motions. You may have even thought, what's the point? I definitely faced those same emotions during my time at Oregon State. But I'm so glad I stuck it out and finished my degree. It's led me to travel the world, try new things, start my own company, and recently, get hired for a dream job. Learning never stops and this is one of the big first steps. Good luck! -Jana Hodgins, '13\n\nLife will give you joy but will also give you lemons from time to time. Be a fighter, you can do this and never give up. -Carrie Campbell, '21\n\nThere will be times when you feel like everyone else has a better handle on things, but looks are misleading.

Working through an engineering curriculum is designed to be challenging. Finishing this degree was just the start in helping me find my voice. Eventually, I would go on to lead hundreds of people and be involved with exceptionally important work with the Department of the Navy developing sensitive technology. It all started at OSU! -John Richerson, '98\n\nYou are capable. You can do anything you put your mind to. You've got this!

My Bachelor of Science in Animal Science helped set a strong foundation for my career in animal health. I am so proud to be part of the OSU alumni community.

Get involved, sign up for clubs in your major. I encourage all students to take on impactful assignments. No matter how overwhelming, at the same time, it will challenge you to grow. Lean on your professors and classmates to keep motivation and you will be successful together. You’ve got this. Go Beavs. -Madison Wall Odomirok, '14\n\nLearning what you DON’T want is just as valuable as discovering what you DO want (academically, professionally, socially, and everywhere in between). The hard work is worth it. Enjoy the adventure! -Dani Boyd, '15\n\nI have always loved the great outdoors, hiking, and hunting. I moved to Corvallis, Oregon, from Atlanta, Georgia, to pursue my Bachelors of Science in Forest Operations Management. I spent a lot of time studying in Peavy Hall.

As a Beaver, that diligence is in your DNA! Looking forward to having all you current students as alums in the near future!

She was right, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. -Leonard Rydell, '68\n\nA little progress every day leads to significant results! Congrats on your achievements.

I did and discovered the value of knowing a bit of many professions, and it vastly helped me in my career.

I ended up with a rich and wonderful career spanning many fields and you can too! Folks you interact with, either in person or via electronic means, may become life-long associates.

But more than anything, be excited for this next grand adventure you’re about to embark on. -Caleb Chandler, '19\n\nWhen I decided to join the Computer Science program in 1982, I had no idea what I was getting into.

Ask for help even if you are the most shy person in the room. I loved my time at OSU. It gave me the time to show my parents that I wasn't that lazy girl who sat in her room all day long. I showed myself I could achieve something more to make myself a better life in the future. You matter, your experiences are valid, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. -Payton McCoy, '21\n\nAs I earned my MS and PhD, OSU provided technical education and leadership experiences that led to 19 life saving drugs, basic science discoveries and a family of children leading in medicine and law and 9 grandchildren with fabulous gifts such as world-class music contributions. -Grant Schoenhard\n\nIt is going to be a wild and sometimes difficult but awesome ride.

You are magic! -Annie Lesny, '18\n\nGraduating with an OSU degree made all the difference in the world. It was the necessary first step in my professional ladder of life. Apply yourself now and you’ll be greatly rewarded later. Best wishes and my full support. -Gary Gustafson\n\nTwo years and two months after graduation from OSU, I was on my way to Okinawa.

Working with patients in the hospital, their family members and other interdisciplinary team members is so incredible fulfilling. Every day is different, every day has its own challenges. I feel like I truly make an impact in my daily work and with my community members. This pandemic has been especially challenging but being able to say that I get to wake up every day and help those who truly need it makes it worth all of the struggle it took to get here. Being a Registered Dietitian was my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream and I am proud to be an OSU alumni! -Taylor Kayfes, '15\n\nDon’t be afraid of making mistakes. It happens! There are so many resources at OSU to support you along the way. If you need help, reach out! And have fun! College can be stressful but it should also be fun. Go Beavs! -Cory Badger, '93\n\nThe four or more years you spend at OSU may seem like a long time, but you will use what you learn and develop friendships that will be with you the rest of your life. It will be a source of pride for you and for your parents. Do not lose sight of the goal. -Paul Freeman, '69\n\nMy years at OSU were the most formative years of my life -- take advantage of every social and educational opportunity and you will leave OSU with lifelong friendships & skills for a successful career! Enjoy!! -Melodee Bluhm, '82\n\nYou are not alone. Everyone else is working hard to get through classes, balance their lives, and manage to find time to sleep. Keep focused, stay motivated, and work until the last final is finished. You'll be rewarded for the dedication. -Steven Fenaroli, '14\n\nCongratulations Beaver! You've got this. Like our namesake - you are smart, strong, resilient, resourceful, and determined. Believe in yourself - you will not fail. -Janice Boatwright, '85\n\nI got an FE degree and a MBA from OSU. My first job was in the financial district of San Francisco, followed by multiple jobs in forest products manufacturing and engineering, steel component manufacturing, a paralegal and finally a manufacturing engineering manager for multiple facilities. I faced many different challenges and a great variety of rewarding experiences. I credit OSU for giving me many of the skills to meet those opportunities. I am sure it will prepare you, too. -Paul Freeman, '69\n\nFellow Beaver, there are thousands of us out there cheering you on to the finish line! Your time at OSU will have such a positive impact on your future! You've got this and can always rely on us for encouragement & support! -Pam Johnson, '83\n\nThank you for being part of the Beaver family. Please know we are behind you and rooting for you as you embark on this year. Take care of yourself as you go, and take care of others when you have the opportunity. You are appreciated. Go Beavs!! -Paul Sutherland, '89\n\nI look back on my days at OSU very fondly and the school is part of who I am. I hope that it becomes that for you too. -Lee Hower, '73\n\nWelcome to OSU. It is an amazing place. You will be a different and better person when you graduate. You will retain all of your good qualities, but also expand on and add to those qualities. You will also have over 200,000 alumni willing to help you achieve your dreams. -Rick Rush, '69\n\nYou are not alone. There are over 200,000 alumni cheering for you and supporting you. Ask for help, we are here for you. I had an awesome experience at OSU, and I know you will too. Have fun! Go Beavs! -Lori Rush, '78\n\nYou’re going to succeed! College was a time to explore and even doubt yourself but in the end it all works out! Enjoy the time, enjoy the relationships built, and enjoy Corvallis. You’ll never have the time when everything is within a 10 mile radius. Enjoy it and you will succeed. -Jessica Davidson, '18\n\nYou really can't hear this enough, but: You've Got This! I am SO excited for you to be starting a new school year with Oregon State. This place has brought so many fond memories - and I know it's going to do the same for you. Go Beavs! -Heather Doherty\n\nStudy hard to obtain the goal you have set for yourself and nurture the friends you make along the way. I have been friends with a classmate for over 50 years. We can still clearly recall OSU incidents from 1968/69, and we have traveled together and visit each other as frequently as we can. Friendships at OSU can last a lifetime. -Paul Freeman, '69\n\nGood days and not so good days face you, but Beavers are dam good at obstacles! Eye on the prize, Beavs: graduation! -Jane Reeder, '17\n\nAlmost there! Stay focused and get ready for the exciting next phase – entering the working world. Seek the truth in all endeavors and learn to make up your own mind. The OSU experience has prepared you well. Go for it! -Kelsie Sullivan\n\nI still think about my time at OSU on a regular basis. The beautiful spring blooms, the raucous fall football weekends, the seemingly endless rainy winter that forced us to become even closer friends. The last year + has been so tough, but you are all resilient and I can't wait to see the amazing things you will do! -Doug Kutella, '98\n\nWelcome to campus, all first year and transfer students, and welcome back to everyone else! OSU is a beautiful campus with many educational and social opportunities. Be bold and embrace this academic year, and do all you can to connect with the university. I have many fond memories of my engineering education, which prepared me for my professional career. Enjoy and learn! -Jay Boatwright, '78\n\nHey fellow Beaver! Welcome to the new school year! OSU has opened so many doors for me and I'm thrilled you've chosen to join Beaver Nation!! -Jill Brown, '09\n\nI started college weeks after 9/11 happened. Suddenly, the world felt a lot less safe, and no one knew what this meant going forward. The last year and a half have felt very similar to those times 20 years ago, and I am sure you have felt like this is not the college experience you were hoping for. It is how I felt then. What I will say is that these years will help shape you going forward but will not define you. There are a lot of positives to be mined during challenging times that will serve you well later. Try your best to find those nuggets while also enjoying a time in your life with new freedoms, responsibilities, and dreams that is unlike any other. Be safe, be respectful, be kind, and allow yourself the space to grow (i.e., make mistakes) by practicing empathy and humility. You got this! You really do. :) -Casey Farm, '05\n\nBeavers are the hardest working, most kind and most generous people you will meet. This is your family and network. They are here for you now and forever, helping and cheering you on. Go Beavs! -Justin Smith\n\nDear incoming students- you are embarking on one of the greatest journeys. Education is such a gift and a privilege and I hope you get out of it everything you put in and more. You could have gone to school anywhere, but you choose OSU. You are joining the ranks of the best our state has to offer - you smart cookie! My degree wasn't just a piece of paper on my wall- it provided me with skills and experience I use every single day! It doesn't matter if you are a student studying on campus or online- there are great opportunities for you. My best advice is to go to class and see your advisor every term! -McKenzie Huber, '10\n\nCollege is about school and learning, of course. But it's also about meeting new people, having new experiences and learning about who you truly are. You can have a balance of everything if you want to, don't forget that. Enjoy the ride, it's the best time of your life! -Colin Huber, '10\n\nBest wishes as you begin this incredible OSU journey. Study, make friends, study, get out of your comfort zone and take on leadership opportunities, and study! This is your time… make the most of it. Welcome to the OSU family! -Candy Pierson-Charlton, '73\n\nIt's been a rough last couple of years, but that's no reason to stop working hard. All of us fellow Beaver alumni can't wait for you to join us. You can do it! -Tony Lee, '13\n\nHi Beaver! By now you're getting used to being away from home (sure you miss home-cooked food). Can you find your classes without getting lost or made some new Beaver friends? I loved being an Oregon State student. I had great classes, was active on campus and met lifelong friends. Best of luck to you! -Judy Laird, '59\n\nCan you believe another school year has arrived? Wishing you the happiest moments of your life here at Oregon State. All of us in Beaver Nation are thrilled you are here. -John Valva\n\nOregon state provided some of the best and most challenging times of my life. Yet, when I look back at my four years, I only remember the fun. I credit my success to the challenges and late nights studying that I often forget. All that is to say, power through the tough times and remind yourself during them, this is only a moment, it will get easier and future-you will thank you for all the hard work that’s been replaced by memories of the good times. GO BEAVS! -Tyler Forst, '11\n\nI look back on my days at OSU very fondly and the school is part of who I am. I hope that it becomes that for you, too. -Lee Hower, '73\n\nYou come from a unique perspective in history. Take on this new chapter with an extra appreciation for the everyday gifts of coffee with a friend, the roar of a full crowd at Reser, the anticipation of in-person classes and the wonderful experiences unique to our beautiful OSU campus. Enjoy the fall beauty and remember to breathe when things feel tough. -Gabrielle Homer, '88\n\nYou’re about to experience the fastest and most significant evolution of yourself in these next four-ish years. Be open to that change and all possible new connections, and don’t be afraid to reinvent yourself. -Ioana Cosmin, '21\n\nYOU GOT THIS. I know sometimes you feel like giving up...don't. You are making a huge investment in yourself. It might not seem like it now, but your degree will mean you have more flexibility to choose jobs, choose where you live, and will make you that much more marketable. I know it's tough: it took me seven years to get my degree as a single mom at age 17, but I did it. My faculty and academic advisors were huge supporters, and they can be for you too, if you reach out. We're all here for you; we believe in you; and we can't wait to see you at the finish line :) Go BEAVS!! -Faith Vawter, '06, '08\n\nWelcome back!

One thing that hasn’t changed in 38 years: You’ve done it! The future awaits you. Never forget those who paved the path you walked, but now it’s time to pave a new path, so future students will never forget *you*. -Dean Moore, '86\n\nYou've got this! Obtaining your degree WILL make a huge difference in your life. The knowledge your receive and the relationships you build will lay the foundation for your future. Take it in. Enjoy the day. And know that your future is bright! -Marc Welker, '92\n\nI wouldn't be where I am today without my experiences at OSU. It is often an uphill battle, but the views from the summit are definitely worth it-- keep up the hard work! -Tara Pesterfield, '18\n\nWhen I first stepped onto OSU's campus I had no idea what a formative experience it would be. I can thank OSU for some of my closest friends, my career and even the chance to meet my wife and start a family. Perseverance pays off, and make sure to take time to enjoy the journey. -Aaron Kerosky, '12\n\nLast year was tough, but you’ve made it this far! Keep pushing to the end and make it all worth it! -Minnette Tiamsic, '20\n\nHey beavs - Welcome! You are now part of the OSU Beavers family.

Beaver Nation (both current and alumni) is pulling for you. You got this! -Jeff Davis, '89\n\nHave fun; make new friends and memories. New can be scary but it's also a really good thing. My Business degree proves to employers that I am coachable and capable. BE coachable and capable and you'll be fine. -Ian Maarefi, '12\n\nI am so happy for you that campus is open again and you will be able to experience college and campus life. Congratulations for being there! You have achieved so much by just getting there and have so much more ahead of you. These are the days you will remember for a lifetime. Enjoy them and make memories you can't wait to share. -Jodi Rosenberg, '90\n\nI am not an OSU alumna, but I’ve worked at OSU for 30+ years. YOU are the reason I love my job. Thank you for inspiring me and making me proud of our university every single day. Have a great year! -Molly Brown\n\nAll the best as you begin or continue your educational pursuits at OSU.

Wishing you all the best! -Abigail Beers, '13\n\nWhen I started college in 1964, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to be and for two years pursued that goal. At that point, my thinking of the ideal job changed and so did my major. The pre-engineering courses I completed opened up many alternatives at OSU and, coupled with a MBA, offered opportunity way beyond my first vision. Stay focused, it will pay off. -Paul Freeman, '69\n\nWelcome to OSU! At OSU, I earned a valuable degree, developed vital teamwork and leadership skills, and found many lifetime friends! Bottom line, my years at OSU were some of the best of my life and I know yours will be too!

You got this! Alums will be waiting to welcome you! -Casey Anderson, '13\n\nMy time at OSU set the trajectory for my life.

Very happy with how things turned out - I never imagined this outcome. Life can bring amazing surprises and outcomes. -John Borden, '69\n\nWelcome to OSU!! Take a moment to take in all the feels; the excitement, the anxiety, the unknown. There are so many new friends, new ideas and new experiences in store for you. Enjoy the journey!! -Kim MacLean, '06\n\nCongratulations on your decision to attend Oregon State!! I got my start in Corvallis in 1974 after feeling lost and detached due to the social change and upheaval of the late 1960's.

I enrolled in the Fisheries and Wildlife program and it changed my life in so many wonderful ways!! I am confident that OSU will be your foundation for a richer and more exciting life! -Jim Esch, '79\n\nWe retired to Corvallis, and part of what we love about our new home is getting to know all the amazing students like you.

Finally, don’t ever lose the spark to continue learning, especially after graduation. -Gregory Becker, '15\n\nWelcome back to the beautiful OSU campus! Work hard on your studies, so you have no regrets when you graduate. -Richard Marston, '80\n\nMy bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from OSU got me started--it was the diving board to launch me into so many exciting opportunities.

Breathe, slow down, take it in-- you got this! -Kelsey Strand, '17\n\nHey students welcome to Beaver Nation! While going to class is important be sure to check in with your academic advisor.

It was 15 years later that I was re introduced to OSU career services. With their guidance and suggestions, I took my career to the next level.

Priceless. -John Schilp, '03\n\nThe things you learn and people you meet at OSU will open many doors for you in the future. When things get tough, keep going. You can do it! And also ask for help.

I hope you’ll soon join me as a proud alumni, my degree has served me well. -Shannon Walker, '88\n\nYou've got this and it will be worth it!

We can't wait to welcome you to the ranks of Beaver Alumni. -Tim Holl, '92\n\nWork hard. Have fun. Be open to change. I profile successful Beavers for a living.

(And don't forget that part about having fun.) -Kevin Miller, '78\n\nHi Beaver! By now you're accustomed to dorm food (not like home but not too bad either), found your classes without getting lost and met some new Beaver friends. I loved being an Oregon State student. I feel like I got a great education, met lifetime friends and had a lot of fun. Best of luck to you! -Judy Laird, '59"
