        "text": "Phytophthora infestans protein kinase functions revealed by CRISPR/Cas12a genome editing\n\nPhytophthora infestans is a pernicious plant pathogen that has caused severe crop damage in many regions across the globe. The main crops that are affected by this fungus-like pathogen are potatoes and tomatoes, which, when infected, display mold-like growth on the inside and outside of the plant. Protein kinases are enzymes that are responsible for numerous functions in living organisms, which may potentially play a role in how this pathogen functions. Understanding the functions of these kinases may be a key to preventing this plant pathogen from causing any more harm. Cas12a is a gene editing tool that can provide insight on the functions of protein kinases in P. infestans. In this study, we will use the CRISPR/Cas12a tool to cut and mutate kinase genes of interest. We will then insert a gRNA-encoding cassette into a plasmid containing Cas12a and introduce the engineered plasmid into P. infestans via protoplast transformation. Following DNA treatment, the transformants will be screened for proof of editing. The type of editing we want to achieve is bi-allelic editing (editing both alleles of the gene of interest in this diploid species), although there is a chance mono-allelic editing may also occur. Thus far, mono-allelic editing has been confirmed, proving that editing can occur and paving the way for further tests to achieve bi-allelic editing.\n\nThe Function of RCB in Chloroplast Development\n\nWhen flowering plants are exposed to light, phytochromes, red/far-red light photoreceptors, perceive light signals and initiate a light-grown program called photomorphogenesis that turns plants green. During this process, activated phytochromes remove phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs), negative regulators of photomorphogenesis. In the nucleus, PIFs directly repress nucleus-encoded photosynthesis gene activation. Simultaneously, they indirectly repress the assembly of the plastid-encoded RNA-polymerase (PEP) complex in the plastid which activates plastid-encoded photosynthesis gene expression. Recently, our lab identified a central component of the phytochrome signaling pathway, the Regulator of Chloroplast Biogenesis (RCB). RCB is a dual-localized protein in the nucleus and plastid. rcb-10, a null mutant, is albino as it fails to degrade PIFs and develop chloroplasts under light. This suggests that RCB is required for the degradation of PIFs in the nucleus and is essential for chloroplast biogenesis. Because removing four PIFs is sufficient to restore greening in rcb-10, RCB appears to have a major role in the nucleus. However, its role in the plastid is unclear. In this project, we showed that svr4-1; an RCB mutant with a single amino acid change, has a yellow cotyledon. Surprisingly, svr4-1pifq cannot restore greening. This result suggests that RCB plays a role in regulating chloroplast biogenesis in the plastid. We will test how this occurs by testing the protein-to-protein interactions of RCB with the PEP complex components and see whether they are altered in SVR4-1 by using the Yeast-Two-Hybrid system and a protein-protein interaction prediction software to further study RCB’s role in the plastid.\n\nUnderstanding the Relationship between Nutrient Availability and Exodermal Rice Suberization\n\nAs the effects of climate change continue to worsen, many crops are being subjected to more intense drought and nutrient stress. Under these conditions, some plants form a protective apoplastic barrier comprised of a long-chain fatty acid polymer called suberin between specific cell layers of their roots. In rice, the endodermis and the exodermis can be suberized. Apoplastic exodermal suberin provides a paper to diffusion and limits water loss during drought. The interaction between nutrient availability and suberin production has been studied in the model organism for vascular plants, Arabidopsis thaliana, which only deposits suberin in its outer endodermal cell wall. This project investigates the interaction between suberin production in the exodermis and nutrient uptake in rice. We subjected rice plants to varied levels of iron or nitrogen, both on plates in the lab and in pots in a greenhouse. We used fluorol yellow staining to analyze suberin produced in the exodermis of rice. Spatial evaluation with a flat-bed scanner determined that seedlings grown in an iron-deficient environment on plates significantly increase suberin production when compared to iron-sufficient roots. This result is opposite to that observed for endodermal suberin synthesis of Arabidopsis grown in low iron conditions(1). This could be for several possible reasons: iron deficiency could promote abscisic acid signaling in rice, a hormone that induces suberin in the endodermis of Arabidopsis and also the exodermis of rice. Alternatively, ethylene, the hormone triggered by iron deficiency in Arabidopsis that inhibits suberization, may induce exodermal suberization in rice. To test these two hypotheses, we will apply a precursor of ethylene to iron-sufficient seedlings and evaluate changes in suberin, and separately test if inhibition of abscisic acid signaling reduces suberization in iron-deficient environments. The impact these hormones have on suberization in these seedlings will further expand our understanding of the relationship between iron nutrition and suberization in rice, which could contribute to the development of climate-resistant crops.\n\nRole of Chloroplasts in Mitochondrial Structure and Function\n\nMitochondrial dynamics are an important process in animals, plants, and yeasts for the maintenance of mitochondria functionality and cellular function as a whole. Part of mitochondrial dynamics is mitochondria fusion and fission which is a cyclical process by which mitochondria can change shape to maintain their functionality. Presently, the specific proteins in plants related to mitochondrial fusion have yet to be discovered. This is possibly due to the likelihood that defects in the mitochondria fusion and fission cycle are lethal because of the loss of mitochondria functionality. We have found that mitochondrial fusion can be induced under high-light stress, resulting in elongated mitochondria shapes. Since high light induces responses in chloroplasts which can then affect the mitochondria, there is likely some form of communication between the mitochondria and chloroplasts inducing mitochondria fusion or inhibiting fission. Furthermore, under high-light conditions, mitochondrial fumarate and malate levels have been observed to increase 2-fold and 1.5-fold respectively. Whether the increased intermediate levels are a cause or result of mitochondrial elongation is currently being explored. To understand this relationship, A. thaliana plants are treated with fumarate and malate during growth, and the transcript levels of genes encoding for the TCA cycle enzymes that produce and convert fumarate and malate are analyzed via Real-time qRT-PCR\n\nSpecies Differentiation and Correlations between Genetic and Environmental Variation in Manzanitas\n\nThe genus Arctostaphylos is composed of woody shrubs with twisting branches, red bark, and bright green leaves, commonly known as Manzanitas. There are more than 60 species of Manzanitas located in California that have adapted to the chaparral biome characterized by hot and dry summers and mild winters, as well as frequent fires. Manzanitas are notable for their diversity and have several widespread species, but around 30 species are considered to be threatened or endangered. Additional work is needed to further differentiate between species and to understand genetic variation that may be correlated with environmental variation. Morphological and statistical analyses, geographic associations, and Genome-Wide Association Studies will be used to analyze environmental, genomic, and morphological data that may be correlated with significant traits. Initial analysis of stomatal distributions shows that Manzanita populations located at higher elevations are more likely to have leaves with stomata on both sides rather than the more common lower side only (p-value = 3.615e-05) and stomatal density on the abaxial side of leaves decreases as the CO2 concentration (from the January before sample collection) increases (p-value = 0.03291). Another finding was that the mean abaxial stomatal length of diploid Manzanitas was generally smaller than that of tetraploid Manzanitas, supporting the hypothesis that a smaller genome size allows for a smaller minimum cell size (p-value = 0.0123). More traits will be analyzed throughout the summer to determine if there are correlations between genetic variation and environmental variation as an important part of understanding species differentiation.\n\nCircadian Clocks in Plants\n\nThe circadian clock is an intrinsic timekeeping mechanism that controls the physiological activities of many organisms including plants and animals over 24-hour cycle. The clock help organisms align their metabolism with environmental changes, which allows them to perform biological processes at relevant times of the day. In Arabidopsis and other crops such as soybean and barley, transcriptome experiments show that up to 50% of genes responsive to abiotic stress experience circadian rhythms. The effects of the biological clock on the plant transcriptome includes genes that control a variety of plant responses including defense against pathogen, leaf positioning, stomata opening and many others. Here, this research studies how the clock controls the response to pathogen exposure in Vitis vinifera (grapes). Specifically, grape plants were exposed to Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, to help understand how clock genes are expressed during pathogen exposure. RNA expression of three main clock genes (LUX, ELF4 and RVE 6) were measured at two different times of the day using RT-qPCR in samples from two grape varieties (Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia) exposed to crawlers and eggs of D. vitifoliae. Clock genes responsible for plant defenses and growth (ELF4, LUX and RVE 6) are projected to be over-expressed in gall-infested grape plants during midday to evening, when pathogen activities are predicted to be high. Insight into this work will help in understanding the role of the clock in regulating plants' response to biotic stress.\n\nCellular Response to Hypoxia\n\nPlants and animals require oxygen for mitochondrial respiration and energy production. In plants, a decline in oxygen availability (hypoxia), such as during submergence, triggers cellular responses. Within the cell, membraneless organelles, called biomolecular condensates, composed of biomolecules (i.e., nucleic acids, proteins), regulate molecular processes. Previous studies show that in response to stress such as hypoxia, RNA HELICASE 6 (RH6), forms biomolecular condensates named processing bodies (Chantarachot et al., 2020), where mRNAs are modified and degraded. Another protein that connects to hypoxia response is OLIGOURIDYLATE BINDING PROTEIN 1 (UBP1C), which forms biomolecular condensates called stress granules associated with the “storage” of mRNAs. However, observation methods have been lacking in plant cell biology to precisely monitor real-time cellular responses during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Using a high-end microscope and protoplast from transgenic lines expressing p35S-UBP1C-GFP (ubp1c-1) and pRH6-RH6-GFP (rh6-1) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we monitored the formation of biomolecular condensates in comparison to our control CCA1-GFP (cca1-1). We did this within an oxygen-level controlled chamber by time-lapse images of 3 different conditions (oxygenation, hypoxia, reoxygenation). For this process, we constructed a microscope-compatible chamber where living cells can be observed in real-time at different atmospheric and dissolved oxygen levels. Consistent with past studies, we found that both RH6-GFP and UBP1C-GFP do form biomolecular condensates. This project establishes the groundwork to understand further the role of biomolecular condensates within plant responses and adaptation to acute stresses.\n\nAdapting Agricultural Systems during Climate Change\n\nWith the repercussions of global climate change only beginning to be felt and the global population projected to grow to 10 billion by 2070, we must urgently adapt our agricultural production systems to meet the challenges of the future. Greater incorporation of urban controlled environment agriculture (CEA) can offer more sustainable future food production and increased crop yields. However, currently only leafy greens are compact and fast-cycling enough to cost-competitively be grown in such a way as a result of high capital and operating costs for urban CEA. The incorporation of additional staple crops, such as tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), into urban CEA will require them to be re-engineered for compactness and FAST CYCLING. Here we show the construction of CRISPR/Cas9 multiplexing plasmids for direct plant transformation of S. lycopersicum. CRISPR/Cas9 multiplexed gene editing has previously been shown to result in transformed lines exhibiting different combinations of gene edits that produced a phenotypic spectrum of traits. We are taking this approach in tomato plants by targeting mutations in genes involved in tomato architecture and development (SELF PRUNING, SELF PRUNING 5G, ERECTA, SPACE, and DWARF). We constructed the multiplexing plasmids using golden gate cloning and then transformed the constructs into Escherichia coli and then Agrobacterium tumifacens. The future steps of this work will be link genotype and phenotype in transformed tomato plant lines to determine which produce phenotypes ideal for urban CEA. We hope that these plants will help improve the feasibility of urban CEA and ultimately help feed the future.\n\nTo sustain growth in response to unfavorable conditions, plants must constantly respond to developmental and environmental cues.\n\nFor example, plants must respond to the aging process (senescence) that can be accelerated by dark treatment. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of such a response will fill in the existing knowledge gap. The Dehesh lab has identified a cis-regulatory element found in the promoters of 30% of stress-response genes. This element was coined the Rapid Stress Response Element (RSRE). Transgenic plants were generated to express a tetramer of 4xRSRE fused to luciferase (LUC) as a reporter to examine plant stress responses. These plants were used in a mutagenesis screen to identify the regulatory components of RSRE. One such mutant with constitutive LUC activity proved to be the result of a single amino acid change from Glu to Lys in a conserved sequence of a member of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, COG7. cog7 mutant was shown to grow indistinguishable from that of the wild-type (WT) plants under standard conditions. However, under dark conditions, cog7 displays accelerated senescence. A second screening using the FOX-hunting system was performed to identify lines reverted in their accelerated senescence phenotype. The screening identified that overexpression of two genes, COG2 and COG5, reduced LUC activity, but only COG5 reverted the accelerated senescence phenotype. Additional analysis revealed dark-induced ubiquitination of proteins in the cog7 mutant background and reversion in COG5 overexpressing lines. Collectively these results indicate that overexpression of COG5 in cog7 background could recover the accelerated stress response as well as the associated ubiquitination, whereas overexpression of COG2 in cog7 background did not recover these phenotypes.\n\nClimate change is a prominent global issue s climate change persists, it is imperative that we understand how this will affect plant species in their environments.\n\nI explored the effects of climate change on three California plant species within the Riversidean alluvial fan sage scrub community (RAFSS). The three focal species are the abundant turkey Mullein(Croton setigerus), the sensitive Parry’s spineflower(Chorizanthe parryi), and the endangered slender-horned spineflower(Dodecahema leptoceras). In California, climate change is predicted to cause an increase in drought, but the RAFFS community has already adapted to dry environmental conditions so species may be less vulnerable to these changing conditions. Because of their drought tolerance, I hypothesized that all species would have an increase in available habitat suitability, with the abundant species retaining the highest proportion of suitable habitat under climate change.To conduct this research, I used species occurrences and current climatic and soil data to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each species. I then used those models to identify suitable habitat in geographic space under current climatic conditions (years 1980-2010) and future climate change under a warm, dry scenario (years 2040-2069). all species experienced an increase in habitat suitability. owever, urkey mullein experienced a decrease in available habitat suitability in the southwestern region of California, an area where the RAFSS community occurssuggesting a habitat shift meaning the currently suitable areas are not the same suitable areas in the future This approach shows that abundant species can be more vulnerable to habitat shift and that in the future, conservation efforts can focus on dispersal dynamics to ensure species have the mobility to move into more suitable habitats.\n\nThe symbiosis between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is emerging as key dynamic to successful plant establishment\n\nSymbiosis between plants and AMF occurs in 70 to 90% of land plants with plants receiving water, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) from the AMF in exchange for photosynthates. Naturally there is a fair amount of variation in this symbiosis with certain plants producing root resource acquisition structures including root hairs and roots with high specific root length (SRL) to extract water, N, and P from the soil. Because root resource acquisition structures and AMF provide plants with the same set of resources, we hypothesize that in response to AMF colonization plants will produce less root resource acquisition structures reducing the prevalence of high SRL and high root hair densities in their root systems and leading to an increase in biomass. To assess the variability in root resource acquisition traits in response to AMF colonization, we grew 14 species of native California grassland plants in a greenhouse in either field soil or an AMF inoculant with sterile controls for each soil type. After several weeks plants were harvested, and SRL, root hair density, root and shoot biomass, and percent AMF colonization were assayed. With the results from these assays, we will be able to determine how plants change their root structure in response to different levels of AMF colonization and inform land mangers whether the restoration of the 12 species examined will be aided by restoring AMF symbiosis via AMF inoculation.\n\nNatural products produced by plants, animals, and microorganisms have been shown to have beneficial health effects when combating illnesses in humans\n\nPlants specifically continue to be used in traditional medicine practices by different cultures. In the pharmaceutical industry, plant bioactive small molecules (PBSMs) have been an important resource for drug discovery due to their diverse biological activities and drug-like properties (Sorokina and Steinbeck 2020). Recently, various PBSM databases have become available, such as the Collective Molecular Activities of Useful Plants (CMAUP), COlleCtion of Open Natural prodUcTs (COCONUT), and the Food Database (FooDB). These databases provide information about the structure, target sites, biological pathways and organismal sources of over hundred thousand PBSMs (Zeng et al. 2019). Using computational analysis, we aim to identify natural plant bioactive molecule alternatives to FDA-approved drugs based on their molecular structure, bioactivity, and target protein annotations. A combination of SQL queries, structural similarity searches, and queries of target protein and pathway annotations of PBSMs will be conducted using R and the Bioconductor packages ChemmineR and drugTargetInteractions (Backman et al. 2011; Cao et al. 2008; Huber et al. 2015). In addition, drug perturbation gene expression signature databases will be searched to identify putative mode of actions for the most interesting PBSMs (Duan et al. 2020). After identifying natural plant bioactive molecule alternatives, novel translational uses can be proposed such as plant-based therapies and food supplements. Further research will need to be conducted to ensure that the identified PBSM alternatives pass safety and nutritional value requirements.\n\nExploring the Requirements for Grape phylloxera Infection in Native and Non-native Grape Species\n\nDaktulosphaira vitifoliae, also known as Grape phylloxera, are aphid-like insects that can induce gall formation on its host plant. The formation of galls from G. phylloxera is largely controlled by the genes of this parasite, therefore it is considered an extended phenotype of the G. phylloxera. However, like many herbivores, Grape phylloxera must overcome plant defenses, an active plant immune system, and tissues and fluids with suboptimal nutrients. Fortunately, in the case of G. phylloxera on several species of grapevine plants they have successfully overcome all of these obstacles. Provided that G. phylloxera have successfully infested their host plant, the insect has caused three major changes to happen to the plant’s physiology, such as: the induction of plant stress signals, the introduction of an extended phenotype, and obtaining nutrients without negatively affecting the host plant. In this project the main objective is to study whether it is nutrient availability or hormone defense that affects the performance of Grape Phylloxera on native and non-native plants. Thus far, I expect reduced defenses and enhanced nutrient mobilization in co-evolved interactions and more manipulation at the cost of the plant in naive species interactions. In assessing nutrient mobilization relative to defense status and performance, it will correlate what nutrients may determine insect success if defenses are similar.\n\nFlowering plants, such as the angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana, require a light signal to initiate chloroplast biogenesis, the process which develops the photosystem of the plant allowing it to convert sunlight to energy\n\nThis process requires the activation of two sets of photosynthesis-associated genes, one encoded in the nucleus and the other in the plastids. Photoreceptors localized in the nucleus perceive the light signal and activate the photosynthesis-associated genes in the nucleus. At the same time, a signal is sent through the nucleus to the plastid signaling pathway, and the genes encoded in the plastid are also activated. However, the mechanism by which this signaling pathway works remains poorly understood. Our lab is working with Regulator of Chloroplast Biogenesis, (RCB); a dual localized protein, located in both the nucleus and plastids, recently identified as a central component of this signaling mechanism. An rcb null mutant fails to generate the nucleus-to-plastid signal, resulting in an albino phenotype. To further elucidate the function of RCB in nucleus-to-plastid signaling, we are performing a genetic screen for rcb suppressor mutants that restore the ability to undergo chloroplast biogenesis. The suppressor mutants are expected to define novel genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis in plants and allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular events contributing to chloroplast biogenesis.\n\nCell Division and Differentiation are essential for overall organ development and tissue patterning within plants\n\nCell division and differentiation are essential for overall organ development and tissue patterning within plants. These processes are oriented, though the mechanisms in which this orientation occurs remains unknown. In the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, oriented cell divisions can be further investigated within the root ground tissue. In root cell types, polar localization is observed for thePLKs, POLAR LOCALIZED KINASEs, which are transmembrane receptor kinases . A specific PLK named INFLORESCENCE AND ROOT APICES KINASE (IRK) is polarized within the endodermis and functions to restrict stele area size and inhibiting longitudinal anticlinal divisions (LADs). A closely related protein is PXY/TDR CORRELATED 2 (PXC2), which polarized similar to IRK in the root and functions to repress stele area. To understand the function of these proteins and determine if increased stele area is a secondary or primary defect, we explored IRK and PXC2 function when misexpressed within the stele, using the SHORT ROOT promoter. I found that the stele area phenotype in irk pxc2 double mutant roots was rescued when IRK or PXC2 were expressed solely in the stele. Further, total root length and straightness phenotypes in the double mutant were rescued when IRK or PXC2 were expressed in the stele. Stele-specific expression of IRK and PXC2 is also expected to rescue the increased LAD phenotype in the double mutant. Overall, stele-specific expression of IRK and PXC2 rescues double mutants back to the wildtype in stele area, root length and straightness, and possibly endodermal cell divisions with IRK rescuing these phenotypes to a greater degree than PXC2. This suggests that enlargement of stele area in irk, pxc2, and the double mutant is a (primary or secondary) defect as related to cell proliferation in the endodermal layer.\n\nGenome-wide association mapping of field performance traits in a diverse collection of citrus germplasm\n\nThe citrus industry in California is valued at more than $1 billion annually and has potential to grow its percentage of the US market share. The growth of the California industry is dependent on developing desirable cultivars that aid in taste, appearance, and tree vigor. However, the breeding cycle of citrus ranges from 4-10 years, which is a major obstacle for crop improvement. To increase the efficiency of the UCR breeding program we have begun to use high-throughput phenotyping methods to rapidly measure many traits. We conduct aerial imaging of trees using drones to capture phenotypic traits such as size, shape, and overall health. Once we have measured these traits, we can investigate their genetic basis using genotype data for the entire UCR Citrus Variety Collection (CVC). Using genome-wide association, we can identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with our desired phenotype. In time, we will perform whole-genome sequencing for the entire CVC to enhance our use of marker assisted breeding. This will enable us to more accurately and confidently identify desirable genetic variants to produce the best tasting, quality, and visually appealing fruit.\n\nGenetic Associations with Climatic Variables in Barley\n\nGlobal climate change poses one of the greatest threats to agricultural and environmental sustainability. Understanding how plants adapt at the genetic level in response to environmental variation or change is essential in preserving our agricultural systems through the predicted and drastic effects of climate change. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is the fourth most highly grown grain in the world and is remarkable for its ability to grow across hugely variable environments such as in regions of high altitude and extreme temperature. Therefore, its versatility and tolerance makes Barley an ideal system to study associations between genotypes and climatic variation to predict which parts of the genome are expected to adapt in response to global warming. In particular, we will analyze single nucleotide variants in the coding sequences of heat shock proteins of Barley varieties grown in harsh temperatures and compare them to those of Barley grown in more moderate temperatures. With this, we hope to find climatic ranges in which alternate heat shock protein variants are most predominant and fit a linear model to further express the association between climate and genotype. Our study will provide insight to the genetic differences most optimal for various environments and elucidate how organisms will adapt to Earth’s rapid climate change.\n\nViral Genomics and Discovery from Metagenomics\n\nViruses are likely the most abundant organisms on the planet, however limited work has studied viruses from environmental sampling, and they represent a largely unexplored genetic diversity, despite likely having an important role in the biology of their hosts. Previously, Dr Stajich’s lab has sequenced DNA from environmental samples to investigate the microorganisms that make up biocrusts. In these diverse datasets there are unanalyzed viral sequences. Web based tools will be utilized such as Cyverse and iVirus protocols to run bioinformatic analysis of the different samples. My goal is to analyze samples from two dominant crust types in drylands, light algal crusts (LAC) and cyano lichen crusts (CLC), which exhibit intrinsic differences in stability, community compositions, and successional age. Processing of biocrust samples through iVirus procedures will generate results to be documented in a digital lab notebook inputting raw outputs and then a summary table that has the information for only the viral contigs from VContact2. My hypothesis to be tested is that viruses found from metagenome data collected from Sheep-Hole Biocrust datasets will reflect distinct viruses unique to crust type and be possibly novel among all described viruses. These dryland associated viruses may hold additional diversity.\n\nHeat stress effects on the metabolome of California-grown ‘Wonderful’ pomegranate juice\n\nPomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an ancient fruit tree crop that has cultural significance throughout much of Eurasia. Pomegranates have also been historically believed to have putative medicinal and pharmacological properties; in modern times, there has been a large effort to elucidate the biochemistry and metabolism of its fruit. Multiple studies indicate that pomegranates have many unique metabolic properties, including high antioxidant activity, which is implicated in preventing numerous diseases in humans, and significant amounts of poly-caryopsis, making pomegranate a candidate model system for ovule development in fruit. Although baseline studies for pomegranates exist, thorough studies of pomegranate metabolics are limited. Furthermore, pomegranates are susceptible to heat stress at temperatures above 35 C. Extreme heat events can lead to large losses in pomegranate crop yields, and these events are projected to become more common and unpredictable with changing climate patterns. It is also unknown how these extreme heat events significantly impact juice quality and metabolism of surviving pomegranate fruits.\n\nThe Jia Lab’s current metabolomics study both further refines the metabolome of California-grown Wonderful pomegranate juice, and compares polar metabolites in sunburnt and unburnt pomegranate juices to better understand the effects of extreme heat stress on the pomegranate juice metabolome. In this metabolomic dataset, 65 unique polar metabolites were detected, 10 of which were significantly different between unburnt and burnt juice samples. Individual metabolite and full pathway analyses are currently being conducted. This study will help characterize California-grown pomegranate cultivars, as well as the damage pomegranates face with extreme heat stress.\n\nMysteries of messages: discovery of mechanisms beyond synthesis and translation\n\nEsperanza Garcia, Maureen Hummel and Julia Bailey-Serres\n\nGene regulation in eukaryotes occurs at multiple steps, from the initiation of gene transcription to the production of a functional protein. Once transcription begins, the nascent transcript undergoes co-transcriptional addition of a 5’ cap, splicing of introns, and addition of a 3’ poly(A) tail, prior to export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where mRNAs are translated by ribosomes into polypeptides. These highly energy consuming cellular processes are vital for the growth, development, and stress survival of plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, translation of mRNA is highly regulated in response to stresses such as low oxygen, to conserve energy. While mRNAs important for stress survival are preferentially translated, many cytoplasmic mRNAs become translationally inactive and are sequestered in stress granules. An RNA-binding protein (RBP) assists in sequestration of mRNAs, which is reversible upon return to normal conditions. This RBP is localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. The goal of this project is to explore the nuclear function of this RBP under low oxygen stress and extended darkness, both energy limiting conditions. First, mRNA-seq, RBP-associated (obtained by RNA-binding protein immunopurification (RIP)) will be performed to identify putative targets of this RBP under extended darkness and control conditions, using existing datasets. Second, by combining the Isolation of Nuclei Tagged in specific Cell Types (INTACT) with RIP, we will compare mRNAs associated with this RBP in the nucleus. We will test the hypothesis that this RBP is important in controlling splicing during low energy stress. This project will shed light on the role of an RBP in post-transcriptional regulation within the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to low energy stress.\n\nDivision plane orientation in plant cells\n\nCell division is crucial to proper development, and plants have mitotic structures delineating the division site to ensure this process is completed correctly. The preprophase band (PPB) is a microtubule and actin structure that forms during G2 and marks the future division site. Although it is disassembled before metaphase, the cell “remembers” the location of the division site by using proteins that remain at the former PPB throughout mitosis, such as TANGLED1 (TAN1) in maize ( Zea mays ). TAN1 is a microtubule-binding protein that assists in correct phragmoplast placement, a cytokinetic microtubule structure that indicates where the new cell wall will be formed.\n\nThis project aims to determine TAN1 behavior in cells that cannot form PPBs by observing its localization patterns in discordia1(dcd1) and alternative discordia1 (add1) double mutants. DCD1 and ADD1 encode B’’ regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase type 2A, that direct the phosphatase to specific locations in the cell, and without which PPBs cannot form. In Arabidopsis , the DCD1 and ADD1 homolog, FASS , encodes a protein required for PPB establishment. FASS is also necessary for TAN recruitment to the division site during metaphase and telophase. Without these genes, Arabidopsis TAN did not accumulate at the division site; however, their role in maize TAN1 localization is less clear. In order to determine if TAN1 still localizes to the division site in cells without PPBs, we imaged wild type and double mutant embryos using spinning disk confocal microscopy. Further understanding how TAN1 is recruited to the division site provides more information regarding division plane orientation, an essential part of plant development.\n\nInvestigating Abscisic Acid Catabolism through Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening of Plant cDNA Libraries\n\nAbscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone involved in abiotic stress signaling, and initiates responses related to seed dormancy, germination, root architecture, leaf senescence, and stomatal closure. The rise of global temperatures due to climate change makes plants more susceptible to heat and drought stress, creating a need for novel methods of regulating ABA levels within plants. Controlling ABA catabolism may provide a way to control ABA-mediated responses in plants. The main objective of this study is to design a yeast based system to identify novel genes involved in ABA synthesis and catabolism from plant cDNA libraries. We will develop a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain containing a yeast two-hybrid based ABA sensor and the genes responsible for ABA biosynthesis from Botrytis cinerea. Expression cassettes of the necessary genes will be constructed and assembled into a linear construct. The construct will be integrated into the genome of a MaV99-based strain containing the ABA sensor. After assembly we will use metabolic engineering to optimize ABA synthesis for best performance with the sensor. As a proof of concept, the system will be used to screen an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library and identify the known ABA-catabolizing genes CYP707As. We will use our platform to screen various plant cDNA libraries to facilitate the discovery of novel ABA catabolic enzymes. Our platform will serve as a tool to complement ongoing efforts to elucidate plant secondary metabolism.\n\nArctostaphylos glauca genome assembly and annotation\n\nThe genus Arctostaphylos (Ericaceae), commonly referred to as Manzanita are shrubs and small trees, with a high endemic diversity in California. Though they are ecologically significant and have received much attention from California botanists, the boundaries among Manzanita species and subspecies remain unclear. As part of a larger investigation using next-generation sequencing data to evaluate species diversity of Manzanitas, we are assembling a Manzanita genome sequence, specifically Arctostaphylos glauca. We used Oxford nanopore sequencing and short-read Illumina sequence data to produce an assembly of high contiguity with a low sequencing error rate. This is the first genome assembly for the genus Arctostaphylos and subfamily Arbutoideae. Here we perform a number of analyses on the genome assembly including masking repetitive elements and annotating likely gene function. We also compare our constructed genome assembly of A. glauca to other chromosome-level assemblies within the family Ericaceae and order Ericales. Specifically, we analyze synteny and estimate times of divergence between the subfamily Arbutoideae and other members of the Ericaceae and Ericales. Analyses of this assembly may shed light on genetic and evolutionary forces in the evolution of the genus and subfamily. This genome assembly helps us to improve detection of genetic differences and relationships among Manzanita species and enable future research.\n\nFunctional Characterization of Arabidopsis LOB-DOMAIN 42\n\nIn many plants, leaves are divided into two distinct regions. The adaxial side faces the meristem and becomes the “upper” side of the leaf; whereas the abaxial side faces away from the meristem and becomes the “lower” side of the leaf. In previous research, it has been shown that the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) transcription factor contributes to leaf polarity by conferring adaxial cell fate in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of AS2 in the abaxial region changes cell fate, producing an entirely adaxialized leaf. However, in an as2 mutant, the leaf maintains polarity, suggesting that there may be another gene that contributes to the adaxial cell fate. LOB DOMAIN PROTEIN 42 (LBD42) has been identified as a candidate gene that may be redundant to AS2. The goal of this project is to characterize the expression pattern of LBD42 in Arabidopsis thaliana, and to determine the phenotype in lbd42 mutants and lbd42 as2 double mutants. In order to characterize the expression pattern of LBD42, transgenic plants containing a pLBD42:GUS construct will be stained for GUS activity at various developmental time points to determine the expression of LBD42. In order to determine the consequence of loss of LBD42 function, we will generate lbd42 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. I will screen for LBD42 mutations in wild-type and as2 backgrounds and examine the resulting plants for phenotypes. If the hypothesis that LBD42 has a function in adaxial-abaxial polarity if correct, we should see abaxialization of leaves in lbd42 single mutants or lbd42 as2 double mutant.\n\nThe nonconventional yeast, Yarrowia Lipolytica has garnered much interest in the field of biotechnology primarily for its ability to synthesize, modify, and store intracellular lipids at a high capacity. A number of established gene-editing tools such as Cre/loxP system, the I-SceI endonuclease-mediated system, and a variety of CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been applied for both gene disruption and regulation. To facilitate the yeast’s survivability under rapid strain development conditions that are common in large-scale industrial manufacturing, we require an efficient genome-wide tool that can simultaneously disrupt and regulate gene expression. We propose the use of a novel CRISPR-Cpf1 system that meets both functions. As opposed to Cas9, Cpf1 can mature its own crRNA array and does not require a transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), making it highly desirable for multiplexed genome editing. It was previously shown that by reducing the length of the sgRNA, catalytically active Cas9 could bind to the genomic target without effecting a double-stranded break and gene regulation was achieved when fused to a transcriptional repressor or activator. We will incorporate this strategy into a Cpf1 based system to achieve genome wide regulation of genes to better understand the expression of phenotypes and their genetic underpinning. A previous genome-wide mutational screen in Y. lipolytica has picked out genes crucial for response to various stress factors such as salinity, acidity, and temperature. With a genome-wide tool that can regulate gene expression, investigating the relationships between genetic architecture and phenotype will identify industrially relevant phenotypes in a more feasible manner.\n\nUnderstanding Mechanisms of PLK1 and PLK4 Polarization\n\nIn plants transmembrane receptor kinases (RKs) have extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an intracellular kinase domains. LRR domains interaction with small molecules and peptides leads to the activation of signaling cascades that are important for plant growth, development, and stress responses. In the root of the model plant Arabidopsis, polarly localized proteins PLK1 and PLK4 are found in the outer and inner plasma membrane domains of endodermal cells, respectively. The specific mechanisms involved in the polar localization of PLK1 and PLK4 proteins are not well understood. To gain insight into these trafficking mechanisms we are taking a chemical genetic approach. Chemical genomics relies on low molecular mass molecules that act in a tunable, dose dependent and reversible manner to target specific pathways. Using fluorescently tagged PLK1 and PLK4 expressed in Arabidopsis roots, along with high content confocal image analysis we will perform a high throughput chemical screening to identify molecules that disrupt the localization of one or both of these proteins. The selected candidates will be subject to a secondary screening to further characterize the action of the molecules. Finally, and beyond the scope of this work, it will be possible to identify the molecular targets of the selected chemicals in order to discover new players in lateral protein polarization.\n\nAnalysis of Downstream Targets and Effects of WUSCHEL\n\nHomeodomain transcription factors responsible for maintaining and regulating stem cells within the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana. One example, Wuschel (WUS), is primarily synthesized within the rib meristem and migrates into layer L3 of the SAM. From there it migrates into L2, and L1 of the SAM at progressively lower concentrations. One gene controlled by WUS is Clavata 3 (CLV3). It is a peptide hormone, which acts backwards to repress WUS’s expression. To explore interactions between different chromatin regions within and around CLV3, chromosome conformation capture (3C) will be used to quantify the interaction of the CLV3 transcriptional region with others. Using 3C protocol modified for Arabidopsis thaliana, plant tissue will be fixed and their nuclei extracted. The DNA within the nuclei will be digested by restriction enzymes and then ligated. Regions with higher interaction are more likely to be ligated together. Through the use of quantitative PCR it is expected that the DNA region of the CLV3 transcriptional start site will interact at a high level with other regions linked to WUS regulation such as the 970 region of clv3.\n\nIdentification of whitefly defense genes in Arabidopsis.\n\nDecreasing crop yields worldwide, whiteflies are notable herbivorous pests and vectors of viruses. These depleted crops include cassava, an important subsistence crop and source of nutrients for small-scale African farmers and citizens. Developing resistance to pesticides quickly, there are few known, effective mechanisms for whitefly control. However, understanding the genetic basis of whitefly resistance in plants shows potential to address the control of these devastating pests. The Walling lab has gathered transcriptome data of whitefly-resistant and -susceptible cassava genotypes after response to whitefly herbivory, as well as two defense hormones: salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Using these data, the Walling lab identified an association between whitefly resistance and response to SA. Among genes showing this association, a known modulator of SA/JA responses, WRKY70, was strongly induced in the susceptible but not the resistant genotype. As a known susceptibility factor to certain pathogens in Arabidopsis, I hypothesize that WRKY70 may act as a whitefly susceptibility factor in cassava. As it is both difficult and expensive to test gene function in cassava, the Walling lab is testing the role of this gene in whitefly defense in the model plant Arabidopsis by using T-DNA knock-down mutants and assessing whitefly (Bemisia tabaci MEAM1) nymph development. I hypothesize that wrky-70.1 and wrky-70.3 mutants will hinder nymph development compared to naturally whitefly-susceptible wild-type Arabidopsis. Furthermore, I will utilize RT-PCR to assess effects of this transcription factor on pathways of defense signaling that may be important in whitefly-resistance. Lastly, I will be performing informatics analyses on time source RNA-seq data sets to define SA- and JA-responsive transcriptomes in Arabidopsis for later comparison to cassava.\n\nDefining metabolic pathways regulated by G protein signaling through integration of transcriptomic and metabolomics data\n\nThe filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a model organism for the study of eukaryotic biochemistry and cell biology due to its ease of growth, haploid life cycle, and more recently its fully sequenced genome. N. crassa is used to study G protein signaling, an important regulator in many eukaryotic biochemical pathways such as signaling with hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as controlling aspects of growth and development. G protein signaling involves G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) and a heterotrimeric complex composed of α, β, and γ subunits. GPCRs activate the heterotrimeric (αβγ) G protein by facilitating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP at the Gα subunit. The Gα and βγ subunits then disassociate and go on to perform downstream signaling, such as stimulation of the enzyme adenylate cyclase by the Gα subunit to produce cAMP. In N. crassa there are three Gα subunits, one β subunit, and one γ subunit. Previous work in N. crassa has indicated that the intracellular protein RIC8 is directly involved in the activation of two Gα subunits (GNA-1 and GNA-3) and contributes to maintaining normal levels of these proteins. Preliminary transcriptomic data has revealed that loss of ric8 leads to the mis-regulation of many genes involved in metabolic pathways. As there is no current data connecting RIC8 to metabolism, the present study seeks to determine how G proteins and RIC8 regulate metabolites in N. crassa. Profiling of polar metabolites will be obtained via mass spectrometry for wild type and five different mutant strains of N. crassa. These will include knockout mutants of gna-1, gna-3, ric-8, and cr-1 (the adenylyl cyclase gene), as well as a double knockout mutant lacking gna-1 and gna-3. Samples of wild type conidia, Δric8 conidia, peptone supplemented wild type, and peptone supplemented Δric8 will also be analyzed. Principal component analysis will be conducted to determine consistency between replicates and differences between strains. Additionally, comparisons will be made for presence of specific metabolites in all strains.\n\nUnravelling Ca2+-dependent transcriptional machinery for induction of general stress responses in plants\n\nDima Younes, Jin-Zheng Wang, and Katayoon Dehesh\n\nPlants have developed a myriad of sophisticated general adaptive/tolerance mechanisms in response to continuous biotic and abiotic stresses. To gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of general stress responses, we searched for and identified a cis element that we coined Rapid Stress Response Element (RSRE). RSRE is comprised of six G/C rich core elements with A/T rich flanking regions. Bioinformatics analyses found the element to be present in 30% of genes known to rapidly respond to biotic and/or abiotic signals. To investigate the transcriptional machinery responsible for stress-mediated induction of this transcriptional hub, we generated transgenic plants expressing 4XRSRE-Luciferase (RSRE:LUC). Detailed studies of these plants showed critical function of Ca2+ in induction of RSRE. To investigate the general and Ca2+-dependent component of transcriptional machinery, seeds of the RSRE:LUC plants were EMS mutagenized, and the resulting plants were screened for constitutive LUC activity. Among the mutants we focused on the one herein designated constitutively activated RSRE 16 (car16). Second generation sequencing and genetic analyses identified the mutant gene that codes the Golgi localized protein. To unravel the role of Ca2+ as a potential bridge between Golgi and nuclear transcription, several calcium markers are introduced into the RSRE:LUC wildtype background and car16. The resulting homozygous line will be employed to examine the site of Ca2+ release for activation of RSRE and the function of CAR16 in the process.\n\nBacteria inside fungi! Microbiome analyses to study bacteria associated with fruit rotting fungi\n\nSymbiotic interactions between fungi and bacteria are evolutionarily and ecologically important. The mutualistic relationship between the fungus Rhizopus microsporus and bacterium Burkholderia is integral to the reproduction and proliferation of the fungal host. However, little is known about when and how these relationships are established, and how they change and whether they also occur among evolutionarily related Rhizopus species. To better understand the interactions between fungi and bacteria and their impact on fungal growth we hypothesized that the strawberry microbiome would change in the presence of R. stolonifer, and that the removal of symbiotic bacteria from R. stolonifer would alter the host asexual reproduction cycle. In order to test the first hypothesis, we chose to examine the effect of R. stolonifer on the strawberry microbiome over a time course of rotting. Comparing the strawberry microbiome at different time points, using next-generation sequencing tools, allows us to more clearly understand how they change over time in the presence of fungus and different postharvest rot preventative measures. In order to test our second hypothesis, we further explored bacteria interactions directly by growing R. stolonifer in the presence of antibiotics to test the effect of removing symbiotic bacteria on the fungi life cycle. Together these studies will further illuminate the importance of fungal-bacterial interactions in fungal biology and post-harvest disease.\n\nEnzymatic Activity of a Possible Cowpea Aphid Effector\n\nThe cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora, is an insect pest that is found worldwide and is responsible for significant yield loss of legume plants, primarily the cowpea, Vigna unguiculata. Cowpea is an important crop that is cultivated in several developing countries due to its short growing period, drought tolerance, and high nutritional value. Cowpea aphids feed on plant phloem sap by inserting their stylets in plant tissues to reach the phloem where they feed on plant sap. In the stylet penetration path and during feeding they deposit saliva containing a cocktail of proteins and other molecules. Molecules found in the aphid saliva are speculated to interfere with plant defense biochemical pathways against aphids. Both plant monosaccharides and disaccharides have been found to play roles in regulation of defense gene expression and signaling in plants. One such disaccharide, trehalose, is involved in resistance to the aphid Myzus persicae in Arabidopsis thaliana. trehalase, an enzyme that breaks down trehalose into glucose, identified in aphid saliva, could be countering the effect of trehalose. The aim of this project is to clone the A. craccivora trehalase and express the recombinant protein in E. coli for functional characterization. The purified trehalase will be tested for in vitro trehalase activity.\n\nCharacterizing the Role of ERF72 in the Response of Arabidopsis to Whiteflies\n\nManihot esculenta, also known as cassava, is a tropical root crop that is the fourth highest source of calories in the world. In the past few decades, high densities of whiteflies have devastated cassava crops in Eastern and Central Africa. At high population densities, whiteflies are able to create physical damage to cassava through feeding alone as well as through their ability to vector cassava viruses. Previous RNA-sequencing studies from the Walling Lab identified candidate whitefly defense genes that are strongly induced in a whitefly-resistant cassava genotype, but not in whitefly susceptible cassava. One of these candidate genes is the ethylene response factor ERF72. We hypothesize that ERF72 plays an important role in whitefly resistance in cassava. We are also interested in understanding possible roles of this gene in regulating different defense hormone signaling pathways. As making transgenic cassava is time consuming, I will test the role of ERF72 in resistance to whiteflies using Arabidopsis ERF72 homozygous knock-out T-DNA lines (erf72-1 and erf72-2). I will infest erf72-1,erf72-2, and the wild-type with Bemisia tabaci B. As resistance to whiteflies is manifested as a slowing of whitefly development, the numbers and stages of nymphs (immature whiteflies) will be determined at day 21 after infestation. Additionally, I will use semi-quantitative RT-PCR to determine if transcript levels of defense sentinel genes in the erf72 lines and wild type change in response to whitefly infestation. These experiments will determine if ERF72 plays a role in the whitefly defense response of Arabidopsis. Future work can then confirm its role in resistance to whitefly in cassava. Possible findings will contribute to our understanding of the plant-whitefly interaction at the genetic level.\n\nCharacterization and Localization of PAP1\n\nAnthocyanin is a pigment that protects plants by absorbing high-energy UV light, in response to environmental stress, improving the survival of plants. Production of Anthocyanin Pigment-1 (PAP1) is a transcription factor that regulates the production of the pigment anthocyanin. PAP1 has both a DNA binding domain and an activation domain that regulate gene expression. Although we have a broad understanding of the PAP1 protein, the activation domain has yet to be characterized. The transcription activation domain (TAD) is a short sequence of amino acids that helps trigger the activation of a particular set of genes. To identify the TAD of PAP1, we will construct clones incorporating various truncations of PAP1, then transform these constructs into yeast. By utilizing theYeast- two Hybrid (Y2H) system, we expect to identify if a particular truncation we insert into the plasmid is a TAD. Previous studies have revealed that PAP1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, but requires a certain amino acid sequence to instruct the transcription factor where to move. This amino acid sequence is a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which tags a protein for import into the cell nucleus by nuclear transport. To investigate the NLS, we will clone potential NLS candidates and transiently transform tobacco via Agrobacterium. By attaching a fluorescent protein, mClover3, to our PAP1 truncations, we will use confocal microscopy to identify the localization of the protein. Through the characterization of PAP1, we can further understand gene regulation of plants under environmental stress.\n\nElucidating the Molecular Basis of Genome Size Variation in Asian Rice (Oryza sativa)\n\nThe genome size of flowering plants varies dramatically between and within species. Most of this variation is not due to changes in the amount of genic DNA sequence but is instead due to changes in the amount of repetitive sequences such as tandem satellite repeats, microsatellites, and transposable elements. Repetitive sequences make up the majority of eukaryotic genomes and can contribute to phenotypic variation, yet the processes by which repeat content rapidly changes remain obscure. Using approaches in cutting-edge bioinformatics, we will analyze variation in genome content of over 3000 resequenced accessions of Asian Rice (Oryza sativa), an important staple crop that feeds over half of the world. We will use a novel approach based on counting K-mers – DNA sequences of length K – in various Asian Rice accessions to evaluate genome content variation. We will then determine the genetic regulation of variable sequences in the genome using association studies. This project will provide insight into the significance of the variation of these repetitive sequences, the regulation of this variation, and the role of this variation in genome size.\n\nFrom Mutation to Mutant: identifying genes that may be involved in synthesizing a novel hormone\n\nWildfires are a common environmental stress that hinder plant growth. Fire following seeds have adapted to the stress of wildfires by sensing smoke. Wildfire smoke contains karrikins, a chemical that causes seeds to germinate and increases light sensitivity. Sensing karrikins requires the receptor KAI2, which is not fire follower specific; this suggests that KAI2 has an alternative purpose to karrikin sensing. Additionally, the KAI2 pathway shares many similarities with the D14 pathway. D14 mediates plant responses to strigolactones: endogenous plant hormones that share structural similarities with karrikins. Phylogeny suggests that D14 evolved from KAI2, yet KAI2 has not been observed to sense endogenous signals. Using the karrikin sensitive fire follower Whispering Bells, or Emmenanthe penduliflora, this study aims to gain a better understanding of the KAI2 pathway and KL, a hypothetical endogenous signal sensed by KAI2. We will extract the RNA of E. penduliflora seedsand use next generation sequencing to de novo assemble a transcriptome. This transcriptome will then be used to identify KAI2 genes within E. penduliflora, compare their protein sequences with other karrikin-recognizing plants, and locate related genes. Because of the similarities between KAI2 and D14, this study hypothesizes that KL is an endogenous signal recognized by KAI2, and transcription of KL genes will increase in tandem with KAI2 gene transcription.\n\nComparative phenomics at the plant-insect interface\n\nDaktulosphaira vitifoliae (grape phylloxera) is a global pest of grapes, the world’s most culturally and economically significant fruit. When D. vitifoliae feeds on Vitis (species), proteins called effectors are released into the plant to manipulate the host plant systems. There are over two thousand predicted effectors determined by their secretory codes and expression in feeding life stages. To characterize the unknown function of candidate effectors we used bioinformatics to analyze gene expression in populations that differ in successful colonization of the same host plant. Several effector genes were differentially expressed and contained common protein structure motifs one of which being the EF Hand domain. The EF hand domains bind with calcium ions, suggesting a possible target in the Ca+ signaling pathways of the plant immune system. Our second step was taking the predicted effector genes containing EF hand domains and test them using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) experiments. Y2H experiments are used to identify the plant proteins that our effectors interact with in vitro. This process involved techniques in creating primers, conducting PCRs to amplify our effector genes, and cloning into yeast. I predict we will see a positive interaction in the yeast two hybrid that suggests our predicted effectors are true effectors that manipulate the calcium signaling pathways in grape.\n\nIn Vivo Fluorescent Tagging to Determine Co-localization and Protein-Protein Interactions Between HeterotrimericGαSubunits and other Proteins in Neurospora crassa\n\nNeurospora crassa is a filamentous, multicellular fungus with low nutrient requirements, a short-haploid life cycle, a sequenced genome and easy, tractable genetics, making it an ideal organism to study cell biology and signal transduction. In eukaryotes, G protein signaling regulates normal growth, development, and environmental sensing. The G protein is a heterotrimer consisting of an α, β, and γ subunit. When a signal is detected, the Gα dissociates from the heterotrimer, leaving the Gβ and Gγ as a dimer. Both the Gα and the Gβ-Gγ dimer go on to perform downstream signaling. In N. crassa, there are three Gα, two Gβ, and one Gγ subunits. A previous study in N.crassa found that two of the three Gα proteins interacted with RIC8, a type of guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. The aim of this study is to determine whether the three Gαs co-localize with other proteins, such as RIC8. The three Gα subunits will be tagged with mCherry (Red), while the other protein of interestwill be tagged with GFP (Green), all at the native chromosomal locus. The Gα-mCherry construct will insert mCherry into a conserved loop region of the Gα subunits. Assemblage of the Gα-mCherry construct will require the polymerase chain reaction, which will create specific DNA fragments. The fragments will be integrated into a plasmid via homologous recombination in yeast. The plasmid will be isolated and transformed into N. crassa. We will then utilize cellular fusion, a process in which different strains of N. crassa can grow as one, to bring together fluorescently tagged proteins together in the same cell. We will fuse a strain with the mCherry tag on the Gα protein and a strain with the GFP on the protein of interest and the resulting fused strain will produce both the mCherry tagged Gα protein and GFP-tagged target. These cells will then be analyzed using a fluorescent confocal microscope to determine whether the proteins co-localize.\n\nDelineating plastidial metabolite MEcPP regulated interorganellar signaling cascade\n\nPlants have evolved elaborate endogenous signaling pathways which allow them to respond to environmental stresses. Plastids play a key role in sensing and responding to stress partially through altering nuclear gene expression. However, the underlying mechanisms of this communication are still unknown. MEcPP, the plastidial produced intermediate of MEP pathway, identified as retrograde signaling molecule, conveys information from the chloroplast to the nucleus in response to environmental stimuli. Upon stress, elevated MEcPP levels increase the expression of the nuclear encoded plastidial localized ICS1, thereby raising the levels of the stress related hormone Salicylic Acid (SA). To delineate the signaling cascade regulated by MEcPP, the second-round genetic screen was performed to identify mutants that can suppress SA accumulation in mutant plants (ceh1) that accumulates high endogenous levels of MEcPP and SA. One of the mutant designated recovery of ceh1 (rceh1) was screened out. To demonstrate the function of RCEH1 in MEcPP mediated retrograde signaling, genetic, cellular imaging, and biochemical analysis were preformed to identify interacting proteins of RCEH1 in the signaling cascade. Two proteins were identified that regulate cellular redox status and which may play a role in this pathway. We will use a split luciferase construct to identify and locate interactions. Further work will confirm the RCEH1 interacting proteins to elucidate the specific mechanism of MEcPP regulating the RCEH1 function in intraorganellar communication.\n\nCharacterizing the Localization and Function of PLK4 in Root Development\n\nTransmembrane receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are a large family of transmembrane receptor kinases that are important for cell-to-cell signalling in plants. Due to the fact that plant cells are surrounded by rigid cell walls, signaling at the plasma membrane is predicted to be critical for plant development. Despite this, many RLKs remain poorly understood. The Van Norman lab has identified a specific RLK named POLARLY LOCALIZED KINASE 4 (PLK4) that is expressed in the endodermis and the central stele with stronger expression as cells begin to differentiate. Preliminary work reveals that PLK4-GFP fusions are polarly localized to the inner polar domain of undifferentiated endodermal cells, suggesting that PLK4 perceives a signal originating from the stele. Additionally, PLK4 appears to be expressed only in a subset of endodermal cells and is only present in cells that will form the Casparian Strip – a selectively permeable, belt-like structure that wraps around differentiated endodermal cells. Using laser scanning confocal microscopy, we will conduct a detailed analysis of PLK4 expression and localization in space and time. We predict that PLK4 is important for differentiation of endodermal cells that will form a Casparian Strip. Two T-DNA insertion alleles of PLK4 have been obtained; one of which is likely a null allele. To test our hypothesis for PLK4 function, we will examine plk4 mutant roots.. Specifically, we will examine the timing and function of the Casparian Strip and passage cells in the plk4 mutants as compared to wild type.\n\nUsing Arabidopsis to determine defense devices against the deadly and devastating fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina\n\nPlants have evolved sophisticated immune systems that allow them to recognize and respond to pathogens. A particularly devastating pathogen, Macrophomina phaseolina, is a necrotrophic fungus causing diseases like charcoal rot and stem blight on its broad range of over 500 hosts. As global temperatures rise M. phaseolina will have increased habitat availability. Although this pathogen causes significant economic losses globally, defense mechanisms against it are not well studied. We have established agar plate-based assays using Arabidopsis thaliana to study genes important in defense against M. phaseolina. Using mRNA sequencing, genes upregulated in infected plants were identified. I am using A. thaliana T-DNA mutant lines, which have a loss of function in one or more of these genes to analyze their role in host immunity. The mutants are grown and infected with M. phaseolina to determine if the gene contributes to disease resistance. By the end of this project, I expect to identify many key players in the defense system of A. thaliana to M. phaseolina, especially those controlled by plant stress hormones like ethylene, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. With this information, I hope crop varieties that are more resistant to M. phaseolina will be developed.\n\nIncreasing the Versatility of Genome Editing in Yarrowia lipolytica through the Application of Type 5, Class 2 Nucleases in CRISPR-mediated Systems\n\nThe costly and detrimental nature of modern fuel sources necessitates the study of alternative methods to produce oil. Oleaginous microorganisms capable of accumulating a large amount of lipids are thus sought and studied with the objective of amplifying their lipid production. The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica demonstrates a capacity to generate a high degree of metabolic precursors for lipid biogenesis and a lipid mass amounting to 90% of its dry cell weight. As a nonconventional yeast with a complete reference genome amenable to new gene integration, Y. lipolytica is a model candidate for studies involving the use of CRISPR-mediated genome editing technologies to enhance the productivity of lipid biogenesis pathways. A CRISPR-Cas9 system effective in driving new gene integration in Y. lipolytica was developed in 2016, however, the capability of Type V, Class 2 CRISPR nucleases such as Cms1 and Cpf1 with Y. lipolytica has yet to be demonstrated. Cms1 and Cpf1 nucleases do not require a trans-activating crRNA, or tracrRNA, and are therefore shorter and easier to synthesize than Cas9 nuclease systems. Additionally, Cms1 and Cpf1 complexes provide versatility in cut-site sequence composition by cleaving target DNA located near T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences, while Cas9 requires a G-rich PAM sequence. These qualities, in conjunction with the capacity of Cpf1 nuclease to generate overhangs in cleaved DNA that aid new gene integration, illustrate the potential of Cms1 and Cpf1 nucleases to increase the versatility of genome-editing technology in model organisms. Here, four CRISPR-Cms1 and Cpf1 systems were proven functional in Y. lipolytica, allowing for their use in future investigations of lipid biogenesis in this key oleaginous organism.\n\nFunctional Role of Membrane Microdomains in Auxin-mediated Pavement Cell Formation\n\nMembrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and sterols have been implicated in the functioning of a plethora of cellular signaling processes. The overarching goal of this project is to explore the functional role of membrane microdomains in the formation of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal pavement cells. The central hypothesis to be tested is that auxin regulates the dynamics of membrane microdomains at the plasma membrane, leading to the establishment of the lobe-indentation asymmetry. To test our hypothesis, we propose two main aims. Aim 1 will test whether the integrity of lipid microdomains is required for PC formation. The sterol-and-sphingolipid-deficient Arabidopsis mutants will be used for this part of the work. PC phenotype in these mutants will be visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. If our hypothesis is correct, we should observe defected PC formation in these mutants. Aim 2 will investigate how auxin regulates the specific recruitment of proteins into membrane microdomains. It has long been suggested that proteins involved in signal transduction can be selectively induced or excluded from the lipid microdomains during intracellular signaling. Biochemical approaches will be used for this part of the work. We anticipate an altered protein composition of membrane microdomains after auxin treatment. Uncovering the link between auxin signaling and membrane dynamics in PC formation will be an important advancement in plant developmental biology and cell signaling.\n\nLocal Adaptation of Barley to Climatic and Competitive Environments\n\nRapid, global climate change is one of the most urgent threats to our natural and agricultural systems. It is imperative that we understand how organisms can survive in vastly different environments to combat the negative consequences of climate change. Beginning in 1927, Harlan and Martini initiated a series of evolutionary experiments to explore the genetic basis of local adaptation in an agricultural context. They intercrossed barley lines collected from diverse environments and competed the progeny of these crosses against each for nearly half a century in two vastly different climatic environments (Bozeman, MT and Davis, CA). We will compare material from each of these conditions to search for the genetic and phenotypic basis of adaptation to climate. We will first compare the performance of barley landraces, as measured by seedling growth rate, under conditions mimicking the climates found at both sites in 14 day trials. Subsequent experiments will compete early and late generations of Bozeman and Davis adapted populations under greenhouse conditions in a six week trial. In parallel, we will use molecular techniques to explore the genetic changes in each population over time to search for alleles that may have contributed to local adaptation. These experiments will provide insight into the genetic basis of adaptation to local environments, and will elucidate how standing genetic variation in a composite cross population impacts overall plant growth.\n\nWoolly Apple Aphid resistance in a variety in apple plants\n\nThe Woolly Apple Aphid (WAA) is an insect that is native to Eastern North America but has been able to spread world-wide. Apple trees are its main source of food and it mainly feeds on wounds, cuts and axils of the tree. When the Woolly Apple Aphid feeds on apple trees it reduces the quality and amount of the apples by reducing the nutrient movement in the tree. In this study, we tried to find out the fecundity and death rate of the Woolly Apple Aphid in various types of apple plants. The plants vary in resistance to the WAA and the experiments will be held in a greenhouse in Riverside California. After assessing the WAA, the data will be analyzed using R a statistical programming language. Another form to understand the plant defenses when they are exposed to the WAA is Callose staining which will be performed to see the differences in the resistance response of various types of apple plants. The plants 02-O3R5-001, 02-O3R5-099, Geneva 935 and Geneva-16 will most likely be the most susceptible to aphid attack and will show the greater aphid colony growth. It is important to understand how the WAA infests various apple trees because it is a great source of food around the world. By understand why the WAA attacks the plants and how we can stop it we can increase our food production going into the future.\n\nGenome Wide Quantification and Analysis of Master Plant Regulator WUSCHEL/DNA Interaction\n\nPlant growth above ground is regulated by a structure called the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) which contains a group of undifferentiated cells that must be constantly maintained to ensure a balance is kept between their undifferentiated identity and fully differentiated organs. The WUSCHEL (WUS) protein is essential in meristem activity in Arabidopsis thaliana as it works by regulating several key components of the SAM molecular network. In previous studies, when WUS is mutated to an inactive form, no meristem is formed at all. WUS upregulates and is in turn negatively regulated by CLAVATA3 (CLV3) forming a feedback loop that is a critical component of meristem growth. While WUS activity relating to individual targets has been investigated, a more comprehensive inquiry into its full range of targets would be helpful to characterize the nature and role of this factor. The first focus of this study is on large-scale patterns of DNA binding interaction with WUS in Arabidopsis. This will be done through gathering and analysis of ChIP-Seq data from Arabidopsis inducible LER p35S:WUS-GR ap1-1 cal-1 plants and pure ap1 cal-1 control plants, allowing for an accurate comprehensive in vivo snapshot of WUS activity throughout the genome. The second scope of this study will be looking at the transcriptional regulation events surrounding a WUS forced dimer that will be introduced in plants in a variety of different conditions. This will open different avenues for tracking the forced dimer itself and the different phenotypes produced by the WUS dimeric protein over time.\n\nTranslocating mechanism of HEMERA from plastids to nucleus\n\nFor cells to survive and grow in different environments, communication between subcellular organelles is the key. Notably, various studies showed that there are many dual-localized proteins with multiple functions in plants, and a number of those enact the retrograde pathway from plastids to the nucleus. HEMERA (HMR) in Arabidopsis thaliana plays important roles in chloroplast biogenesis as well as light signaling in nucleus regarding hypocotyl growth. Although previous studies showed that HMR first goes to plastids via a transit peptide at the N-terminus, due to the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR does not function as expected, the sorting mechanism of this protein from plastids to the nucleus is still poorly understood. Besides, the discovery of the protein RCB (Regulator for Chloroplast Biogenesis) suggested that this protein could interact directly with HMR, and together they affect the processes of light signaling in nucleus and chloroplast biogenesis. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that the interaction between HMR and RCB enhances the translocation of HMR into the nucleus, I will use Agrobacterium containing genes which encode for various versions of HMR fused with YFP and RCB fused with CFP, then expressing them separately and together in tobacco by infiltration. The result of each transformation will be observed under Fluorescent Microscope. The outcome of this experiment is expected to provide new insight into how HMR translocates from chloroplast to nucleus specifically, and the communication between plastids and nucleus in general.\n\nFluorescent Tagging of a Family of G-Protein Coupled Receptors Involved in Plant Cell Wall Degradation\n\nG-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane associated proteins that are important for regulating growth and sensing environmental stimuli in many organisms, including, fungi, plants, and humans. The PTH11-like GPCRs are of interest because little is known about this class outside of the organism Magnaporthe oryzae, which is a pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa). The GPCR PTH-11 is necessary for host surface recognition and pathogenicity in M. oryzae. Better understanding of this protein can lead to advances in agriculture. In particular, greater knowledge of PTH11-like GPCRs could help increase yields of rice by targeting the pathogenicity of M. oryzae. The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has 27 putative genes for PTH11-like GPCRs, which is of interest because N. crassa is responsible for the turnover of cellulose in the environment, rather than functioning as a plant pathogen. In addition, N. crassa has a fully sequenced genome and a full library of gene deletion mutants for each gene. These qualities make it an ideal model organism for study of the PTH11-like gene family. In this study, a green fluorescent protein tag was added to each of the putative genes, as well as a V5 tag, which is a small epitope with an easily accessible antibody. The vectors with the genes coding for tagged proteins were transformed into N. crassa, creating tagged versions of each PTH-11 like GPCR. The fluorescent GPCRs were used to study localization of the GPCR when growing on different carbon sources as well as co-localization with red fluorescent protein-tagged heterotrimeric Galpha proteins.\n\nPhosphoChloroplast Retrograde Signaling in Response to High Light Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana\n\nThe metabolite 2-C-methyl-D-ethyritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) is produced in the MEP pathway and accumulates in plants in response to external stress. Generally speaking, when a plant is exposed to a stress, it first senses the stress, activates a signaling pathway, and then initiates a response. Our experiment focuses on high light stress, which is sensed by the chloroplast. When high light is sensed, MEcPP accumulates triggering a signaling pathway from the chloroplast to the nucleus, ultimately regulating gene expression. How this signal localizes to the nucleus is still unknown. Our hypothesis is that the accumulation of phosphoinositides in the nucleus regulates gene expression in response to high light. This response can be observed using a phosphoinositide sensor molecule and observing the sample by confocal microscopy. Additionally, we will compare the capabilities of triggering the retrograde response to high light conditions or MEcPP treatments in Col-0 wild type plants and various knockout mutants impaired in PI production. To isolate the homozygous mutants we will use PCR. Then, we will use quantitative RT-PCR to determine which plants are knockouts. Once we have selected the homozygous knockout mutants, we will expose them to the high light or MEcPP and use quantitative RT-PCR to determine if specific genes are activated by the retrograde response. If our hypothesis is correct we should find HPL and bzip60.\n\nSolubilization and renaturation of plant cell wall methyltransferases expressed in E. coli\n\nResearch on plant cell walls has value towards increasing knowledge about plant structure and function and towards providing environmentally friendly energy for society. While combustion of petroleum deposits directly releases climate-changing carbon dioxide into the environment, production and combustion of biofuels derived from plant cell walls is nearly carbon neutral and thus environmentally advantageous. This project focuses on methyltransferases that add O-methyl ethers to sugars in plant cell walls. Two methyltransferases, MT1 and MT6, encoded by Physcomitrella patens genes cause synthesis of 3-O-methylgalactosyl residues when transgenically expressed in tobacco. This result is curious because the moss cell wall contains many 3-O-methylrhamnosyl residues but few, if any, 3-O-methylgalactosyl residues. The hypothesis is that the MT1 and MT6 methyltransferases can methylate either rhamnosyl or galactosyl residues, depending on substrate conditions. The approach is to separately express the methyltransferases in E. coli, purify the tagged proteins, and biochemically assay their enzymatic activities under controlled conditions. Physcomitrella cDNAs corresponding to MT1 and MT6 were modified to remove the transmembrane domain and to add a short N-terminal peptide that binds to modified streptavidin to enable affinity purification. This modified cDNA was cloned into the pASK-IBA16 plasmid under the control of the tetA promoter so expression is induced by anhydrotetracycline. The plasmid also adds a signal sequence targeting the periplasmic space, promising easier downstream purification. Protein gel electrophoresis indicates, however, that the transgenic polypeptides probably accumulate in inclusion bodies. Solubilization and renaturation of polypeptides from inclusion bodies are currently under investigation.\n\nTranslatome Analysis of the Phosphate Starvation Response of Oryza sativa\n\nThe human population is predicted to reach ten billion over the next three decades. This estimate coupled with climate change will demand greater and more effective agricultural output as changes in arable land occur. In order to sustain crop yield, food production requires application of fertilizers containing phosphorus on agricultural fields. Modern agriculture largely depends on phosphorus derived from phosphite rocks. Phosphorus current global reserves may be depleted in 50-100 years. This rapid decline is predicted to produce a significant rise in prices that may make this fertilizer unaffordable to poor farmer’s communities. Consequently, farmers who cannot afford phosphorous fertilizer will struggle to grow rice in low phosphate conditions. This project aims to find genes critical to the low phosphate survival, a signaling network that reorganizes root and shoot development to maximized phosphate absorption and utilization. Specifically, rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) will be grown with or without a phosphate source, and the root/shoot tissue will be harvested for mRNA and phosphate level analysis. Techniques used for mRNA analysis include Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), RNA-Sequencing, and confocal microscopy. By use of these tools we will decipher the regulation of genes at different levels of gene expression, between transcription and translation, as well as within specific cell-types of roots and shoots. The effective long-term goal is to grow sustainable rice in low-phosphate conditions to the same level of rice grown with an exogenous phosphate source enhancing low input production of the major source of carbohydrates for half the world.\n\nProfiling the nuclear transcriptome and translatome of discrete cell populations in Oryza sativa exposed to waterlogging and water deficit conditions\n\nPlants are multicellular organisms composed of distinct cell types, each cell with a unique composition of RNA populations. Technologies such as INTACT (Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types) and TRAP (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) facilitate access to nuclear mRNA (nuclear transcriptome) or translating mRNA (translatome) populations from specific cell types. Here we examine next-generation sequencing data obtained through the use of these technologies in transgenic Oryza sativa lines. These lines were developed and selected for the examination of cell types from the meristematic and differentiated zones in roots and meristematic region in shoots. We also examine data generated from lines for root barrier cells such as exodermis and endodermis, to evaluate their plasticity in production of suberin in roots subjected to waterlogging and water deficit conditions. The purpose of this project is to use bioinformatic tools to analyze the RNA populations of specific cell types of O. sativain order to answer the following three questions: How do RNA populations differ between cell types in the context of their biological functions? How do nuclear RNA populations differ from those involved in translation? How do RNA populations in exodermal and endodermal cells differ between control, waterlogged, and water deficit treatments? We aim to identify genes with enriched expression in these cell types and under these conditions. This will aid understanding of how genes and gene networks specify cell functions, as these networks are dynamically modified in response to water stress in this important crop species.\n\nExploring Unique Cellular Features of the Middle Cortex Using Fluorescent Reporters and Confocal Microscopy\n\nIn the root of Arabidopsis thaliana, the outer cell layers are concentric around the central vasculature. From the outermost layer toward the vascular there are: epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and pericycle layers. The endodermis and the cortex make up the ground tissue and are derived from a single stem cell. The middle cortex is a ground tissue cell type that comes from a later periclinal division of the endodermis, and the middle cortex has been thought to simply be another, second cortex layer. However, the middle cortex seems to have properties that are distinct from the endodermis and cortex. We have identified a protein that shows unique localization in the middle cortex, suggesting that it is a distinctly different cell type and may have different functions than cortex cells. For my project, I am examining the spatial and temporal expression of PLK1 and CO2 in middle cortex cells. We predict this information could show how long it takes for the middle cortex to gain its own identity. To analyze changes in polar localized proteins during middle cortex formation, I am also exploring different methods to increase the number of middle cortex cells and decrease the time of initial formation. Among other treatments, I will be using paclobutrazol, a gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor, to accelerate middle cortex formation. If the paclobutrazol successfully increases middle cortex formation by at least 50%, we can use fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate the middle cortex cells. Through my project, we hope to provide evidence that middle cortex is indeed a unique cell type and use its formation to further our understanding of the basic processes of development and how cell fate is specified during root growth.\n\nPhysical interaction between MORC1 proteins and putative targets of MORC1-regulated miRNA\n\nRobust immune systems protect plants from various pathogens, but immune activity also competes for finite resources required for growth and development. Thus, immune responses are often highly controlled to balance defense with other physiological needs. Microchidia (MORC) proteins, members of the GHKL ATPase superfamily, have recently been described as players in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and heterochromatin silencing. MORC1 and its closest homologs regulate multiple layers of plant immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and Solanaceous plants (tomato, potato and tobacco). Interestingly, the effect of MORC1 is species specific, positively regulating immunity in Arabidopsis and potato and negatively regulating immunity in tomato and tobacco. While MORC1 proteins have highly conserved N-termini amongst the four species, their C-terminal regions, comprised of a linker (disordered region) and a coil coil (CC) domain, harbor key amino acid differences. These CC domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, and recombinant protein analysis has attributed the species specificity of MORC1 to this region. In addition, MORC proteins have been shown to physically interact with some RdDM factors and Resistance (R) proteins. Small RNA deep sequencing conducted at Dr. Manosalva’s laboratory identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting additional regulators of the RdDM pathway and plant immunity. By tracing these miRNAs to their predicted target genes, four MORC1 candidate binding partners were selected to test for MORC1 interactions. Three of them correspond to proteins involved in the RdDM pathway, and the fourth target is a tomato R protein. Yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screens will be implemented to test for physical interaction between tomato/potato MORC1 proteins and the aforementioned candidate proteins. Various Y2H pairings of full-length and truncated proteins also aim to identify particular domains responsible for binding activity. Characterization of MORC1’s molecular interactions will help elucidate its role in epigenetic regulation and plant immunity.\n\nLOF1 and Interacting Transcription Factors in Plant Development\n\nTranscription factors (TFs) help ensure proper gene expression in developing tissues, and thus play a role in plant development and plant architecture. LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1, or LOF1, is a TF expressed in the organ boundaries of Arabidopsis thaliana. lof1 mutants have fused axillary branches and cauline leaves, which indicates importance in boundary development. Because transcription factors are known to act in complexes, we wanted to discover what other proteins interact with LOF1. We executed a yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screen that identified several TFs as potential interactors: WHIRLY 3 (WHY3), MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN32 (MYB32), HOMEOBOX-LEUCINE ZIPPER PROTEIN4 (HB4), and LIGHT RESPONSE BTB2 (LRB2). WHIRLY1 (WHY1) and HOMEOBOX ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA3 (HAT3) are thought to be redundant with WHY3 and HB4, respectively, and are included in our study. To gain evidence that the interactions between the potential protein interactors and LOF1 is biologically relevant in planta, we will characterize T-DNA insertion lines in which the genes that encode these interactors are disrupted. Our goal is three-fold: genotype the T-DNA lines to identify homozygous mutants; characterize the phenotypes of these mutants and compare to known phenotypes; and create double- and triple-mutants between lof1 and the other TFs. Because the boundary region is involved in determining leaf angle and leaf angle affects planting density, changes in leaf angle have the potential to impact crop yield. In the future, we may be able to apply the knowledge we obtain in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to crop species in order to improve crop yield.\n\nNeurospora crassa\n\nG-protein signaling is essential to normal growth, sensing, and development in eukaryotes. G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are Guanine-Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) for Ga subunits that interact with Ga, Gb, and Gg proteins. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFS) activate the signaling pathway of Ga subunits by instigating the release of GDP and subsequent binding of GTP. RIC8 is a non-GPCR GEF found in animals and filamentous fungi that is essential for the regulation of Ga subunits. Previous research has found that RIC8 interacts with Ga proteins GNA-1 and GNA-3 in Neurospora crassa. RIC8 knockout mutants (Dric8) possess significant defects in sexual and asexual development and growth. Dric8 mutants were also shown to have decreased levels of Ga (GNA-1, GNA-2, GNA-3) and Gb (GNB-1) subunit proteins and shown to regulate GEF activity of GNA-1 and GNA-3. Alignment of N. crassa RIC8 with proteins from animals identified numerous conserved amino acids. Mutation of these residues showed that several were essential for normal interaction with GNA-1 and/or GNA-3 and GEF activity. We are studying the phenotypic effects of 5 ric8 point-mutations in N. crassa. We will quantitate hyphal growth rate, aerial hyphae height and conidiation. We will also assess colony morphology and the development of sexual structures. The effect of ric8 point-mutations on GNA-1 and GNB-1 production will be determined. RIC8 protein levels will be measured using Western blots and the quantity of mRNA will be assessed using Northern blots. This research will help us to further understand the role of RIC8 in Ga regulation in eukaryotic organisms.\n\nRole of Microtubule Dynamics in Cell Division using Maize tangled-1 Mutant\n\nIn maize, tangled1 (tan1) mutants exhibit shorter stature compared to wild-type, rougher leaves, and misplaced cell walls. Timelapse analysis shows that the tan1 mutant has slower division times in metaphase and telophase compared to wild-type. There is no correlation between longer metaphase division times and misoriented divisions, suggesting that mitotic progression does not affect placement of cell wall. Phragmoplast expansion and disassembly is slower in the tan1 mutant, suggesting a role for TANGLED in regulating microtubule disassembly. We are interested in testing if the TANGLED protein alters microtubule dynamics. Another undergraduate in the lab and I will be growing wild-type and mutant plants that express YFP-TUBULIN in taxol (a microtubule stabilizing drug) and propyzamide (a microtubule depolymerizing drug) and assessing growth by measuring root length. My hypothesis is that tan1 mutants have hyperstabilized microtubules so when grown in taxol media the mutant will have proportionally smaller roots compared to wild-type. tan1 mutants grown in low concentrations of propyzamide may have partially complemented root growth. Using live-cell imaging, we will assess phragmoplast dynamics in the tan1 mutant with and without taxol by measuring phragmoplast expansion and disassembly rates. We expect the mutant to be more sensitive to taxol so expansion and disassembly rates will be proportionally slower compared to wild-type at the same drug concentrations. These experiments will help us understand the role of the TANGLED protein in regulating microtubule dynamics in vivo.\n\n“super synthetic elicitor” and a better understanding of the plant immune system\n\nPlants are exposed to different environmental factors that they must cope with to be able to survive in their respective agro/ecosystems. To be able to defend themselves from one of the major threats, phytopathogens, plants have evolved a complex inducible immune system. Phytopathogens typically produce elicitors that can be recognized by plant immune receptors. Elicitors are small molecules or fragments of macromolecules that are specific to certain pathogens or microorganisms. Some of the genes and pathways required for plant immune responses have been studied, but are still poorly understood. Synthetic elicitors are drug-like compounds that can induce plant immune response, but are distinct from natural defense elicitors. Previously, our lab had performed a high-throughput screening of 60,000 diverse organic compounds for defense inducers and identified 114 new synthetic elicitors. This project is focused on the analysis of possible synergistic effects triggered by co-application of some of these compounds. Combinations of different synthetic elicitors applied at varying concentrations will be tested for their efficiency in protecting susceptible wild type Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants against virulent strains of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). Synergism can result from interactions between two or more agents that results in quantitatively greater effects than the sum of the individual effects of each agent. Such synergistic effects may allow for the design of new super synthetic elicitor cocktails containing ultra low doses of bioactive chemicals. In order to gain a better understanding of the genes involved in synthetic elicitor triggered immune response, I am testing different Arabidopsis T-DNA mutants bearing mutations in genes previously found by our lab to be highly expressed after synthetic elicitor treatment. I will test if any of these mutants exhibit enhanced susceptibility against Hpa and possibly other phytopathogens. Taken together, this study can lead us to a super synthetic elicitor that may serve as prototype for new pesticide alternatives avoiding excessive use of toxic pesticides. In addition, we may identify new components of the plant immune system that are important for the bio-activity of synthetic elicitors.\n\nImmunity against root-knot nematodes in Arabidopsis thliana and tomato\n\nPlant parasitic nematodes are responsible for $US157 billion in crop losses annually. The Kaloshian lab studies immunity to the root-knot nematodes (RKN, Meloidogyne spp.) which infect a vast number of plant species. Plant immunity to pathogens relies on a two-tiered process: pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In the past, research on plant immunity against RKN has been centered mainly on ETI. To characterize PTI responses, the Kaloshian lab used mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and identified a well-known co-receptor, BAK1, that is required for early RKN perception. To identify the RKN recognition receptor, they performed gene expression analysis with RNAseq in wild-type and mutant bak1 plants, RKN-infected and control, and identified 11 candidate genes. Screening mutants of a subset of these with RKN identified a negative regulator of immunity. This project aims to further investigate these PTI mutants and identify the tomato homolog of this negative regulator to evaluate conservation of its role in immunity. This negative regulator belongs to G-type lectin receptor kinase family with limited information. Therefore, as a first step, we identified the Arabidopsis members of this family. We are now currently investigating their tomato homologs and will use this information to develop constructs for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in tomato to evaluate with RKN. With this research we aim to use negative regulators of immunity to develop broad-spectrum resistance in crops against RKN.\n\nThe effect of drought stress on gene expression of the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem\n\nWater scarcity is a se"
