        "text": "Joye Moon\n\nRealism, Abstraction and Non-Objective Motifs\n\n(July – September 2023)\n\n“Since I enjoy painting many different types of subject, presenting them through realism, abstraction and non-objective motifs, this exhibit is a combination of the many ways I like to present paint on paper.\n\nPainting a variety of subject matter keeps me fresh and enthusiastic. I can present these subjects in countless ways. Portraits can expand into semi-abstraction, landscapes can take on a fantasy quality and florals can combine lots of design elements and techniques.”\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nDaniel Klewer\n\nLinear Tactility: Paintings as Sculpture\n\n(March 2 – May 8, 2020)\n\nDaniel Klewer is best known for his painting process, which has evolved over the years into nearly doing away with the brush and implementing a non-traditional paint application process. Viewers of his work will experience an investigation into the visual and psychological resonance of color relationships and texture.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJames Barany\n\nAmalgamated Anthropologies\n\n(June 17 – August 3, 2019)\n\nThrough a compendium of interdisciplinary and time-based means, artist James Barany attempts to embrace the emotion and memory of the human condition. His newest studio works are a return to the human form, offering an infusion of visceral media and a new platform to investigate time and empathy.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJon Horvath & Hans Gindlesberger\n\nStreet Scene\n\n(April 22 – June 8, 2019)\n\nIn choreographing a mashup of content that offers varied perspectives of a place, artists Jon Horvath and Hans Gindlesberger overlay iconic images with the virtual landscape. Photography, cinema, and newer technologies like Street View share a relation as mediums that have been used as surrogates for travel and a way of augmenting our lived experience.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nMelissa Dorn & Kate E. Schaffer\n\nThe Everyday Feminist: Fine China\n\n(February 25 – April 13, 2019)\n\nWhat does it mean to be a feminist? What does it mean to be a feminist every day? The exhibition will explore this question through installation, paintings and sculpture. The work of Melissa Dorn and Kate E. Schaffer revolves around commonplace objects, those often overlooked, just as women’s work is often overlooked.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nTimothy Haglund\n\nNocturne: Landscapes of the Milwaukee River\n\n(January 7 – February 16, 2019)\n\nArtist Timothy Haglund strives to capture the world of nature at night: a dramatic, mysterious, and magical time wherein senses are heightened, sounds and temperature become more distinct, and one’s presence in the landscape is often solitary. With this exhibition, Haglund emboldens viewers to come to know their landscape and go beyond viewing beauty to be enveloped in nature’s nuances.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nKelly Frederick Mizer\n\nTraces & Threads\n\n(October 29 – December 21, 2018)\n\nWhen Mizer's youngest son was four, he asked, “Mom, you know that voice in your head? Who is that?” Her work is an attempt to answer that question, exploring the idea of memory and identity as they relate to relationships—particularly the relationships that must change in order to grow. For Mizer, drawing and painting give voice to hurt, intrigue, and betrayal, examining those parts of the past that continue to reside in the present.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJoseph Mougel\n\nHerbarium\n\n(September 4 – October 20, 2018)\n\nHerbarium reveals the desire to capture and preserve things that comprise a place. The subjects include botanical specimens native to the prairie, as well as introduced varieties that now encroach upon the landscape, and the components describe narratives of transition, colonization, and exploration of the prairie ecosystem.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nNina Ghanbarzadeh & Ethan Krause\n\nConversations\n\n(June 16 – July 26, 2018)\n\nIn a celebration of printmaking, artists Nina Ghanbarzadeh & Ethan Krause will draw inspiration from each other’s process. Krause’s current screen printed work uses four-color process printing to enter into dialog with print culture, scanning and photographing old material, (re)arranging it digitally, and returning it to print. The recent focus in Ghanbarzadeh’s work has been the intersection of text and image and the potential of using text to create movement and texture.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nRobin Jebavy\n\nGlass Utopias\n\n(April 28 – June 7, 2018)\n\nFor years, artist Robin Jebavy has been making densely layered paintings of glassware arrangements with a focus on fusing the unbounded expanse of the inner, intuitive world with private, domestic environments. Glass Utopias, experiments with glassware imagery to reference our fragile and often precarious human condition and ask questions about our intimate relationship with the external world.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nCynthia Brinich-Langlois\n\nWater Sheds\n\n(March 3 – April 19, 2018)\n\nThe lithographic prints that comprise Water Sheds present a variety of landscapes altered by drought, with small figures moving through panoramic compositions. The environments depicted are drawn from deserts and boulder formations that evoke regions of the Southwest, to references to agriculture and livestock that speak to uses of the Midwestern landscape.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nKristen Bartel\n\nWater Works\n\n(January 13 – February 22, 2018)\n\nWater Works is an exhibition of prints and photographs that look at the incongruous relationship we have with our landscapes. Looking at both the large and small aspects of constructed landscapes, this exhibition is an inquiry into how we understand the natural.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nPacia Sallomi\n\nAbove & Below\n\n(November 26, 2017 – January 4, 2018)\n\nArtist Pacia Sallomi paints as a way of exploring the spiritual qualities of lived life. It is an intuitive process that is informed by experience, research, and journaling. She works in series; each exploring an idea that comes to completion when the underlying questions have been resolved and/or another question becomes more compelling.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nTonia Klein\n\nMythologies\n\n(July 10 – September 3, 2016)\n\nTonia Klein's screen prints are influenced by fairy tales and world mythology. She uses these as a basis for sharing personal stories and investigating the role of women throughout history. In this way her work addresses and represents the social and political spheres of women.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nDigging Deep | Exploring Process & Presentation\n\nCurated by Lena Vigna, Curator of Exhibitions at the Racine Art Museum with assistance from Jim Charles\n\n(May 22 – July 3, 2016)\n\nSeven artists were asked about what motivates them and how they work through ideas. This exhibition is the result of visits to the artist’s studios and in-depth conversations with them regarding their interests and their process for making work.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nKay Knight\n\nScavenged\n\n(November 7, 2015 – January 2, 2016)\n\nInfluenced by apocalyptic novels and real-time disasters, Knight’s paintings have begun to comment on our society’s collective fear of defeat. In the paintings, houses are destroyed beyond rescue. Left behind are colorful pieces of structure remnants. These fractured parts become the residue of our past, as well faceted patterns of light reflecting a brighter future. Rebuilding is still possible.\n\nSarah Marie Becker\n\nFree Advice and Define Yourself\n\n(January 9 – 31, 2015)\n\n2014 Wilson Center Hidden River Art Festival Emerging Artist People’s Choice award winner, Sarah Marie Becker utilizes photography and self-portraiture to investigate the ways in which social media dictates contemporary human behavior. Her exhibition will feature works from the series Free Advice, a performance photography series that relies on the advice of strangers, and Define Yourself, an exploration of self-identity through the eyes of others.\n\nKatie Musolff\n\nMy Peeps\n\n(September 6 – October 25, 2014)\n\nActivated by a sense of curiosity and wonder, Katie Musolff’s creations invite us into her neighborhood, her home, and her backyard. These sensitive and witty watercolors will make you laugh and marvel at the vibrant world around us.\n\nSarah Stonefoot\n\nIn Her Absence\n\n(March 9 – April 27, 2013)\n\nThe photography of Sarah Stonefoot invites us to stop and stare. What at first glance appears to be a white pillowcase with an ornate red design is in fact a pillowcase covered in intricately placed red ladybugs. Stonefoot describes: “The botanical objects I have brought into the home are stopped in transformation. Their location is often questionable and their capacity for self-motivation is ambiguous. Fluent in a secret language that’s rich in mythic rawness, they crawl, branch, sprout and mimic their surroundings.” The subtlety and humor of her work set it apart. In 2009 Sarah was singled out as a “Pick of the Month” artist in Photo District News and was recently selected to participate in the Catherine Edelman Gallery’s Chicago Project.\n\nCraig Blietz\n\nYard: The Art of Craig Blietz\n\n(January 5 – February 23, 2013)\n\nBest known for his rural inspired imagery, Craig Blietz's work amalgamates that vision with a formal and conceptual approach to painting. Blietz received a BS from The University of Denver. He continued his art and design studies at Harrington College of Design and finished his formal studies at The School of Representational Art. Blietz studied privately with master draftsman and Chicago figurative artist Fred Berger, Chicago portrait artist Richard Halstead, and painter/printmaker/illustrator John Rush.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Lois Clementi and Karleen Haberichter\n\nCourtesy of Tory Folliard Gallery\n\nRory Burke\n\nFinite Differences\n\n(November 3 – December 21, 2012)\n\nInterested in the shared experience of our finite existence, Rory Burke creates work that strips humans, quite literally, to the bone. Working with cast resin, ashes, ink, and other mixed media, Burke creates skulls and busts that provide a unique, introspective interpretation of the human condition. Burke exhibits her work internationally, has been awarded an Outstanding Scholastic Achievement award by the International Sculpture Center, and was the Arts/Industry Resident at the Kohler Company, Kohler Wisconsin during the winter of 2011.\n\nWilson Center | 10th Anniversary Retrospective\n\n(June 1 – July 30, 2012)\n\nSince the opening of the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in 2002, exhibiting the work of Wisconsin visual artists has been integral to the Center’s mission to be the catalyst for lifelong discovery and exploration of the arts. The Ploch Art Gallery has featured the work of Wisconsin artists who spark conversation, engage imagination, and connect us to our humanity. The Wilson Center 10th Anniversary Retrospective is a celebration of the artists, committee members, staff, and community who have been part of making the Ploch Art Gallery one of southeast Wisconsin’s premier visual art venues.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Andrea & Anthony Bryant\n\nDean Valadez\n\nOur Plastic Visage and the Rainbow Machine Complex\n\n(January 6 – February 26, 2012)\n\nUsing acrylic paint, paper collage, and printing techniques, Valadez creates futuristic, mechanical worlds that feel like a deconstruction of space and matter. Drawing inspiration from George Orwell’s 1984, Valadez focuses on the ways in which technology shapes our experience of the world and how we are in turn seen by it.\n\nJane Foster Doud Collection\n\nEducator, Innovator, Promoter, Collector\n\n(November 4 – December 26, 2011)\n\nJane Foster Doud’s many years of energetic involvement within our regional arts community have resulted not only in an extensive collection of works by Wisconsin artists, but a vast historic knowledge of their lives. She has had a unique vantage point to observe the dynamic changes to our state’s visual arts scene to which she has made a significant and lasting contribution. The late Doud was a local artist, educator, and arts patron. Her collection represents well-known and highly respected artists of the mid 20th century in Wisconsin such as Schomer Lichtner, Aaron Bohrad, John Colt, Ruth Grotenrath, and Karl Priebe. Doud’s illustrious collection is greatly enhanced by the stories and experiences of her full-filling life and the strong relationships she had with the work.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Lois Clementi and Karleen Haberichter\n\nKatie Musolff\n\nThe River Journal\n\n(September 2 – October 23, 2011)\n\nKatie Musolff’s oil paintings and drawings present a study of landscapes, figures, fish, and botanicals that reveal a delicate sensitivity in painting as well as her observations of life. Musolff is a graduate of the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, completed a residency at the Pfister Hotel, and is a 2008 Hidden River Art Festival \"Best in Show\" award winner.\n\nThe League of Milwaukee Artists\n\n(June 1 – July 28 2011)\n\nThe League of Milwaukee Artists formed in 1947 as a visual arts organization whose purpose was to bring together artists for the mutual advancement of its members and their work, and to promote interest, appreciation, and understanding of art in Milwaukee. In the 1950s the LMA became the first art group in the midwest to hold outdoor art fairs. Since then the LMA has become a staple in the Wisconsin arts community and has become a resource for many outstanding Milwaukee area painters by promoting art through exhibitions and fairs, and has exhibited in such venues as the Museum of Wisconsin Art, The Cedarburg Cultural Center, and the Charles Allis Art Museum. This exhibition at the Wilson Center features over 30 juried members. Selected works will include drawing, oil painting, watercolor, and acrylics.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Lois Clementi and Karleen Haberichter\n\nRodger Bechtold\n\nLandscape Fascination\n\n(March 4 – April 22, 2011)\n\nPainting with a colorful and vibrant palette, Rodger Bechtold gives the viewer a transformative vision of landscapes through his rich interpretations of the Midwest. Bechtold says his subject has always been landscape, and his artwork as a whole has always been about color. He frequently works and teaches en plein aire, working directly outdoors.\n\nExhibit Sponsors • Pat & Phil Crump and Elaine Peterson\n\nYevgeniya Kaganovich\n\ninhabit/infest\n\n(January 14 – February 23, 2011)\n\nYevgeniya Kaganovich is a Belarus born, Milwaukee-based artist, whose hybrid practice encompasses jewelry/metalsmithing and sculpture/installation. She has created site-specific artwork for installation in the Ploch Art Gallery using sheets of latex draped from the ceilings, extending over the walls, and transforming the space. In writing about her work Kaganovich says, “inhabit/infest implies that the Wilson Center is more than an edifice for art and culture; it is a living organism that we, too, are a part of.”\n\nJoann Engelhart\n\nAt Garden's Edge\n\n(November 5 – December 24, 2010)\n\nJoann Engelhart’s mixed media pieces combine textile, print, and found organic materials to present us with a balanced, harmonious, and artistic use of nature. In addition to using various processes of fibers surface design, Engelhart also incorporates decayed leaves and tediously hand-stitches them. Dried and preserved in shellac, they represent the passage of time and create extraordinary color, patterning, and texture.\n\nEmily Belknap\n\nWetlands\n\n(September 11 – October 29, 2010)\n\nEmily Belknap uses large stone sculpture to create a sense of time, describing its impact on nature. By focusing on simple patterns and movements, she reminds us of how fragile a moment can be. Belknap graduated from the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in 2007. She has shown her work throughout the Milwaukee area, including the Museum of Wisconsin Art, the Mitchell Park Domes, and has also participated in three Hidden River Arts Festivals.\n\nKathleen Raash\n\nThe Lake Studies\n\n(March 10 – April 30, 2010)\n\nKathleen Raash’s paintings reflect the influence of living on a small lake in northern Wisconsin. Her interest is in capturing the rippling reflections on the lake, flickering images of trees, texture of bark, moss, and water, and the strong colors of the sunsets and northern lights. Raash finds that, in lake studies, the quality of light reflected in the water is not a direct reflection of sky in the water, but rather an expression of changes caused by the motion of the surface. A Wisconsin native, Raash completed her undergraduate work at UW-Eau Claire and her graduate studies in fine art at UW-Milwaukee.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • The Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank\n\nBarry Roal Carlsen\n\nShifting Ground: Paintings, Prints, and Drawings\n\n(January 4 – February 27, 2010)\n\nBarry Roal Carlsen works frequently in oil and encaustic on panel, but has incorporated both drawing and prints for this show. This body of work speaks to Carlsen’s breadth of approach in interpreting the imagery and feeling of landscape. His paintings, drawings, and prints provide a sense of the artist’s own history and imagination. Carlsen states, “My paintings are reconstructions of another time, spawned from memory, at once real and yet imagined. They are amalgamations, the kind of blending and restructuring of place and situation that revisiting the past creates.”\n\nExhibit Sponsors • Pat & Phil Crump and Elaine Peterson\n\nMelanie Kehoss\n\nDecorario\n\n(November 6 – December 28, 2009)\n\nUsing silhouettes and cut-outs as imagery, Melanie Kehoss’ work seamlessly combines drawing and sculpture with printmaking in intimate light and shadow boxes. Commonplace materials—scrapbook paper, paint swatches, and fleece—are props for ambiguous narratives, almost “peep shows,” to which the viewer brings their own interpretation. Kehoss is interested in public space, human interaction, and awkward moments between strangers. “The interactions I tend towards are a balance between warmth and tension. Warm in the sense that people are attempting to connect and sometimes having a positive experience that way, but also tense because it’s hard, it’s awkward trying to connect with someone. That’s all portrayed in the body language.”\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Lois Clementi and Karleen Haberichter\n\nAron Meudt\n\nIf I'm Gone Before You Wake Up\n\n(September 4 – October 28, 2009)\n\nPhotographer Aron Meudt caught the attention of the judges at the 2007 Hidden River Art Festival with her striking photographs documenting the realities of Wisconsin farm life, and her concern over the disappearance of the family farm. A graduate of the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design, Meudt’s youthful perspective earned her the Best in Show Award. Her current body of work is no less personal, capturing memories associated with a dear childhood friend who passed away. These evocative, thoughtful images convey Meudt’s grieving for a shared past.\n\nWisconsin Visual Artists Juried Exhibition\n\n(June 1 – July 24, 2009)\n\nAt 109 years of age, the Wisconsin Visual Artists (formerly the Wisconsin Painters and Sculptors) is the oldest juried member art organization in the state. Founded in 1900, the group has included many of Wisconsin’s most prominent artists, sponsors the Wisconsin Biennial and the Japan Art Exchange, and co-sponsors the Wisconsin Visual Arts Lifetime Achievement Awards. This exhibition features the work of the Southeast Chapter, comprising the region including and surrounding the metropolitan Milwaukee area. Artworks were chosen by Ray Gloeckler, a noted artist/printmaker and Professor Emeritus of Art at UW-Madison.\n\nAmy Arntson\n\nA Visual Dance\n\n(March 2 – April 18, 2009)\n\nAmy Arntson, a retired Professor of Art from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, has had gallery showings in cities around the world from Milwaukee to Beijing, China. She has been the Artist in Residence at both Isle Royal National Park and Voyageurs National Park, and given lectures about her work at international conferences in Sweden, Peru, Spain, Costa Rica, China, and England. Influenced by a range of work from 17th century illuminists’ wash drawings to 20th century abstraction, Arntson’s paintings focus on light, texture, shape, and the movement of water.\n\nGary Gresl\n\nI Am Solitaire\n\n(December 8, 2008 – January 31, 2009)\n\nGary Gresl, a Manitowoc native, has been featured in exhibitions throughout Wisconsin. He has received numerous awards for his work including multiple best in show awards and jurors’ selections. He is the founder and co-chair of the Wisconsin Visual Art Lifetime Achievement Awards, as well as one of the co-founders of the Milwaukee Visual Arts Roundtable.\n\nMichael Foster\n\nTransitions\n\n(October 8 – November 21, 2008)\n\nMichael Foster uses his natural interest in working with people to find the primary subject matter of his art: the human figure. His art focuses the attention on the subject, with minimal detail in the background and searching for highly expressive personalities. He deliberately paints the background using colors from the figure so that the finished piece harmonizes with the subject. Foster is a full-time art teacher at Waukesha South High School and a graduate of Cardinal Stritch University with a Masters in Art. He was commissioned to produce a series of paintings for the Waukesha Public Library which now hangs in the entryway of the new addition and won the 2006 Hidden River Art Festival’s Best in Show award.\n\nGovernor's Awards in Support of the Arts\n\nA 25 Year Retrospective\n\n(September 2-28, 2008)\n\nShown together for the first time, a collection of twenty-five commissioned works by Wisconsin artists given as the annual Governor’s Award in Support of the Arts. This retrospective exhibit of artworks was created in honor of more than 135 individuals, businesses, and organizations which have made extraordinary contributions to the vitality of the arts. The Governor’s Awards in Support of the Arts is a program of the Wisconsin Foundation for the Arts, an independent citizen body advocating for the arts in Wisconsin.\n\nLaurel Lueders\n\nNether Realm\n\n(June 5 – July 25, 2008)\n\nLaurel Lueders takes photographs of what constitute personal symbols, then weaves them together creating a map that can be followed by a public audience. Her work is deeply layered with overlapping and emerging images, and deals with history, political situations, and an underlying element of inner disturbance. In describing her most recent work, Lueders said, “I went around Germany and photographed archeological dig sites of lost cities, many of them 1000-2000 years old. I was fascinated by this cycle … a city built over a city, how cities (and also people) go back to the earth, how it is built and rebuilt … both in a physical way and also symbolically.”\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Dolan Productions\n\nJeremy Wolf\n\nMagnus Bestia\n\n(March 3 – April 18, 2008)\n\nSculptor Jeremy Wolf’s objective is to strike a balance between the natural world and our increasingly artificial one. Wolf has adopted animals, for their easy personification, as a symbol of nature as a whole. By giving his sculpted animals human features and qualities, or having them interact with symbols of modern life, he forces us to consider them as part of our world. “I often create my artwork with the goal of blurring the boundary between humans and animals,” states Wolf. He creates standing sculptures as well as those that are suspended in the air, giving viewers the feeling that they are sharing the space with the artwork and not merely looking at it.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • Holly & Jon Sorenson\n\nWendy Mukluk\n\nWorldview\n\n(January 7 – February 22, 2008)\n\nFor Wendy Mukluk there is more than meets the eye and this is apparent in her digital photographs. “I’m basically a historian … I draw what I can’t photograph,” says Mukluk. She sees the artist’s role being similar to that of a shaman, as a vehicle by which things from other realms can surface for everyone’s benefit. It is in a very holistic sense that Mukluk tries to record “the wonders all around us,” focusing especially on those that exist in “ordinary” objects. With a background in traditional photography, digital techniques, drawing, lithography, etching, and painting she is well qualified to, through painterly manipulations, impose her own sense of aesthetic and beauty onto her digital prints.\n\nExhibit Sponsors • Karleen Haberichter & Lois Clementi, Faye's 1 and Faye@play\n\nAmy Ruffo\n\nFlats; Fissures; Elevations\n\n(November 5 – December 30, 2007)\n\nMethodical would be one way to describe Amy Ruffo’s drawings. Being exposed to the Great Plains and expansive horizon of her native Nebraska, Ruffo has developed a taste for a particular sort of line. She has identified this line in views of treetops against a clear sky, a mass of power lines, and a detailed view of newly leafing trees. Ruffo uses her camera to capture and recall the lines she observes, then transfers the lines from photographs to her sketchbook where she works them extensively—as if in a conversation to get to know them. It is this working relationship with lines that allows her to create drawings that reveal the individual character and energy of each line that Ruffo so sensitively delivers.\n\nExhibit Sponsor • George Watts & Sons, Inc.\n\nDerrick Buisch\n\nSplitscreen\n\n(September 4 – October 26, 2007)\n\nDerrick Buisch started as a landscape painter and while he would no longer be classified as such, his present work could be described as abstract, in a way he still paints landscapes. A precedent was set for Buisch’s style of abstract painting by American abstract painters of the 1950s. Abstract painter Barnet Newman painted time by painting a line to divide an otherwise solid field of color on his canvas. This sort of painting makes time more real; viewing one you can appreciate finitude and an amalgamation of energy and stillness. Buisch’s paintings work with something even more nondescript than time. He concentrates on the development of an idiosyncratic abstract visual language, while focusing on the drawing, structure, and color of pedestrian sources such as roadside signs, strip malls, graffiti, tattoos, and product symbol design."
