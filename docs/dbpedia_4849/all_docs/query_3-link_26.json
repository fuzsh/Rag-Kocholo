        "text": "Leading the Oklahoma State Equestrian program is head coach Larry Sanchez. Entering his 25th year at Oklahoma State, Sanchez continues to bring national titles home to Stillwater year after year.\n\nUnder the guidance of Sanchez, Oklahoma State Equestrian has made its presence known at the National Championships every year, winning the overall national title in 2022 and individual titles in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2013. Sanchez also led the Cowgirls to Big 12 Championships in the 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons.\n\nAs one of the most respected and successful equestrian coaches in the country, Sanchez has been essential in the move toward varsity recognition in the sport of equestrian. He currently serves as the spokesperson for the Varsity Equestrian Steering Committee, which is responsible for the development, organization and implementation of all aspects\n\ninvolved with assembling varsity equestrian as an emerging NCAA sport.\n\nA native of Colorado, Sanchez began his intercollegiate coaching career at New Mexico State in 1993 and quickly organized one of the nation's top programs in the IHSA. Under his leadership, NMSU won national titles in 1995, 1997 and 1998.\n\nSanchez moved to Stillwater to launch Oklahoma State's team in 1999. In his 25-year coaching career, 17 of his qualifying teams have placed in the top four at the national level. Additionally, he has coached an impressive 23 riders to individual national championships and 13 riders to reserve championships.\n\nDuring his time at Oklahoma State, Sanchez has coached numerous All-American and All-Big 12 selections. Last season alone, the Cowgirl roster boasted six All-Americans and four All-Big 12 riders.\n\nOSU’s success under Sanchez began almost immediately as his 2000 team won the program’s first NCEA national championship. The Cowgirls then won four-straight NCEA titles from 2003-06.\n\nDuring his years leading the Oklahoma State program, Sanchez has earned his share of individual coaching accolades, including being named the NCEA Coach of the year in 2022 and collecting Big 12 Coach of the Year honors five times.\n\nIn 2022, Sanchez led the program to new heights, guiding the program to both Big 12 and NCEA overall national championships, earning him NCEA Coach of the year honors.\n\nIn 2013, he earned both NCEA and Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year honors after leading the Cowgirls to their third Big 12 Championship and third NCEA Western National Championship.\n\nIn 2014, Sanchez added another impressive accomplishment to his resume, becoming the first coach in Big 12 Equestrian history to lead his team to three consecutive Big 12 championships. Sanchez and the Cowgirls would repeat this feat from 2021-23, and has yet to be matched by other Big 12 programs.\n\nDuring his time at Oklahoma State, Sanchez has coached numerous All-America and All-Big 12 honorees. Since 2011, Stillwater has been home to 73 NCEA All-America selections.\n\nThirty-eight different Cowgirls have earned All-America honors. Five of those - Lauren Halvorson, Harley Huff, Kary Krshka, Abigail Brayman and, most recently, Jojo Roberson - earned All-America accolades four times in their distinguished careers, while the list of OSU three-time All-Americans includes five Cowgirls: Jenna Blumer, Jorden Davis, Ebba Lange, Lindsey McMullen and Hannah Mitchell.\n\nUnder Sanchez’s watch, 17 Cowgirls have been named Big 12 Rider of the Year in their respective disciplines, and OSU has had 52 All-Big 12 honorees since the conference began recognizing those in 2012.\n\nSanchez’s riders have found great success in the classroom as well. The program’s emphasis on academic success is evident in the team’s frequent appearances on Big 12 and NCEA honor rolls. OSU has earned 189 selections to Academic All-Big 12 teams, and five Cowgirls have been named the Big 12 Scholar-Athlete of the Year.\n\nCoach Sanchez completed the coursework for his M.A. in agricultural education at NMSU and received his B.S. in equine science from Colorado State. He is a carded judge, breeder and competitor within the American Quarter Horse Association.\n\nLarry and his wife, Julie, who is a registered nurse, have two children, a son, Colton, and a daughter, Caitlyn."
