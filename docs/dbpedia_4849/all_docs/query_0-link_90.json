He entered the service of The Canadian Bank of Commerce in August 1912. Enlisting in August 1914 from the Humbolt, Saskatchewan branch, he joined the 9th Canadian Battalion and was later transferred to the 1st Canadian Battalion. Mockler fought at Langemarck and the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915. He was severely wounded during the first German gas attack at Ypres and succumbed to those wounds on May 7, 1915.\n\nExcerpt from his obituary:\n\nWith sincere sorrow we chronicle the sad death of this promising young soldier who died in the military hospital, Cambridge, on 7th (May) from wounds received in battle in France on 23rd of April. He belonged to the first Canadian Regiment.\n\nFrom the particulars we have been able to obtain it appears that, on account of his knowledge of the French language, he was taken by his commanding officer on a special mission in the carrying out of which they had to cross the enemy's line of fire, and had only covered about five hundred yards when the Major fell mortally wounded. The gallant young soldier, immediately in the face of a storm of shot and shell, went to the assistance of his officer, who on point of death, ordered him to go on.\n\nIn obedience he resumed his perilous journey, but had not gone far when he received what turned out to be his death wound - a shrapnel charge in the back, which penetrated a lung. To avoid further injuries, he threw himself down on the ground but did not escape other wounds of a more or less serious character, as well as the gas which had been directed against the French lines which he was trying to reach, and which caused the French to break away.\n\nAfter crawling inch by inch for about six hours he succeeded in reaching his own lines, and although suffering awful agony he got into the ambulance unassisted, and was conveyed to the base. Passing through four hospitals, always on a stretcher, he eventually arrived at Cambridge at midnight on the 1st [of May]. Here he lingered until Friday last when he passed away, having received every care and attention from the hospital staff.\n\nBaptism Details as Recorded in Magheragall Parish Church Co Antrim, Northern Ireland\n\nName Edward Cecil William Mockler\n\nParents Edward & Alice\n\nAddress Parish of Ballinderry\n\nOccupation Gentleman\n\nDate of Birth 24th June 1893\n\nDate of Baptism 15 August 1893\n\nMinister Revd Mockler Rector of Magheragall\n\nExtract from Clergy of Magheragall Parish by (Canon Dundas 1907-1940)\n\nRevd Edward Mockler, B.A.  1863-1894\n\nRev. Edward Mockler graduated in T.C.D. in 1836. His grandfather had been Archdeacon of Cloyne. Before coming to Magheragall he had been curate in Ballinderry in 1839, in Skerry and Rathcavan (1840), and in Killead from 1841. After 31 years of ministry he resigned the parish in 1894, and died on 10th October, 1894., aged 82 years. He also is buried in the N.W. portion of the graveyard, where a monument is erected. There is also a mural tablet in the church.\n\nFriends School Lisburn Presents Archive World War One\n\nhttp://www.friendsschoollisburn.org.uk/ww1/print.asp?pagehead=db\n\nMOCKLER, Lance Corporal Edward Cecil William. Born in Ballinderry on the 24.6.1893 he was educated at the local school. At the aged of 13 he won an Incorporated Societys exhibition which entitled him to three years free education at Dundalk Institution. A second exhibition gave him two more years and residence at Mountjoy School in Dublin. On completing his education he emigrated to Canada, against the advice of his principal who wanted him to go to Trinity. Having secured a post with the Canadian Bank of Commerce he sailed for Montreal in July 1912 and lived in Humboldt, Saskatchewan for two years before joining up at Valcartier Camp, Quebec on the 22.9.14 aged 21 years and 3 months. A single man, he had no previous military experience, was 5 8½ inches tall, of a dark complexion with blue eyes and dark hair, he had a scar on the left side of his head. After training at Valcartier he served in 1 CI WOR (I8822) being posted first to Salisbury and then to the Western Front in late march or early April 1915. He died in the military hospital in Cambridge on the 7.5.15 age 21 from wounds received at Langemarck near Ypres on the 22 or 23 April. Because of his knowledge of French, he had been asked by Major Kimmins to accompany him to the French lines. On their way there Kimmins was killed and Mockler hit in the back by shrapnel which punctured his lung. Although he took cover, he was hit several more times as well as being exposed to the gas which the Germans had released on the French. It took him six hours to crawl back to his own lines from where he was taken back to base, eventually arriving in hospital in Cambridge late on the 1 May. His father was able to visit him in hospital before his death and had his remains brought home on Sunday the 9th for burial on Tuesday 11th. The son of Edward Mockler of Fruithill, Rose Lane Ends, Ballinderry, Co. Antrim who sat on the Lisburn Board of Guardians, he is buried in the family plot in Ballinderry Middle Church Cemetery, Ballinderry. According to a report of the funeral in the Standard, There was a large number present and it was evident from the tear-brimmed eyes seen on all sides that the deceased was held in very high esteem in the neighbourhood in which he was born and reared. Numerous wreaths were sent by relatives and friends. There is no headstone inscription. A separate headstone records the death of Alice Maud Mockler on the 28.4.1895 and Thomas McCleavy Mockler on the 26.10.1922. A Miss Mockler of Ballinderry is also recorded in the Belfast News Letter of 4.7.16 as a contributor to comforts sent out to soldiers in 11 RIR in the first half of 1916.\n\nThe events in which Mockler was involved were described by John McCleland a Dunmurry man who was also serving in the CEF. In a letter home to a friend in the village he wrote, I expect you have heard all about our heavy casualty list. We got it good and hard while it lasted, but I might tell you we gave quite as much as we got until the Germans started shelling with the poison gas fumes. I could fill quite a few sheets of writing paper with what I came through from April 22nd up until the morning of the 24th when I got hit and half poisoned as well. We made two charges with fixed bayonets. I came through the two charges without a scratch, but three hours later I was giving a wounded comrade a drink and I got it good with a large chunk of shrapnel in the shoulder fracturing some of the bones; but the gas is worse than their biggest shells. The Germans did their best to break through our lines, but all efforts failed. They even drove the French Algerians out of their position, and thats where we lost so many in recapturing the lost ground. We lost very heavily but we saved the situation. To tell you proper, if they had got through and crossed safely over the Yser canal there would have been nothing to prevent them being in Calais. It is not clear whether John McClelland survived the war or not. There are a number of casualties with that name in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission register but it is impossible to say whether he is one of them. As for Major A. E. Kimmins, the CWGC records that he died on the 24 April 1915. He has no known grave and is commemorated on the Menin Gate Memorial.\n\nHeadstone in Magheragall Grave Yard\n\nErected to\n\nThe Memory\n\nOf John Mockler\n\nLate of Kingstown\n\nBorn 27th November 1813\n\nDied 21st July 1882\n\nRev Edward Mockler died 1894\n\nHis wife Gracilia 1893\n\nTheir daughters\n\nAlice Lucinda 1885\n\nEleanor Jane 1906\n\nGracilia 1921\n\nCharlotte Sophia March 1943\n\nMagheragall Burial Book\n\nJohn Mockler of the Rectory Moneybroom Buried July 25th 1882 Died July 21st 1882 Aged 68 Ceremony preformed by Robert Lindsay\n\nAlice Lucinda Mockler of the Rectory Moneybroom Buried 23rd September 1885 Died 19th September Aged 37 Ceremony preformed by Robert Lindsay Lisburn.\n\nGracilia Mockler of the Rectory Magheragall Buried 23 December 1893 Died 20th December 1893 Aged 76 Ceremony preformed by Robert Lindsay\n\nRevd Ed.

And as I am satisfied it will remain Comfortable and Incouraging to thyself, so I am persuaded it is to many more and that thy affectionate visitt and labours of Love will not be Easely forgotten, For indeed and sweetly revived the days of our youth and the love of our Espousalls which in a good degree ( I hope ) United to our Cheifest Beloved, the Lord our God, and one unto another, and may we not say of a truth that Love waxeth not old, May I am in my smal measure a Witness of that flowings of it in many oppertunitys we had together, and at this present time makes me willing to take pen in Hand and scribble a little though Im but poorly in Health at psent, I am my ffrd really sorry for ye acct thou gives abt Rombelone and ye two poor women I wish some means could be found out to keep such at Home. I find theyr Quite weary of Betty Smith in Ireland, and have agreed to appoint her no more Meetings. I suppose thou hast heard that Jno haslara is returned Home from His American journey and in pretty good Health. His acots of his travills and remarks was highly acceptable to us in our last 2rly meeting, Sam Hopwwood came with Him and is on his way for London. As thou requested I must give thee some acot of ye meeting at Armley which often thou wast gone gave the a great deall of pain of mind, for I heard the People were much disappointed so I ventured to let ffrds give them notioe that Bro Longmire and self wd be there at a meet: on first Day afternoon following, which we did wth our ffrds on that side And Abundance of Sober tender people attended the ffrds thought above 500, and mostly Methodists it was ( I think ) a solled open time, and we came home very easey and left them Inquiring wn we wd goe again , that in­deed It was sorry my ffrds thou missed so much satisfaction as I believe thou would have found amongst yrs. What will be the consequence of things I can't tell, But Certainly there is a Devine Hand at Work amongst the people, and many are seeking Savation to yr souls - Amongst ye Externalls of Worship who I humbly Hope will in time be Brought to find it at Home and be made to Retire to ys Gifts of God in themselves. I must confess I find my love and good desires Increase towards these peoples and I never meet wth em ( as we frequently did at one opportunity or other ) But I find a degree of ye Gospell spring to roll towards them.\n\nThe Young woman thou mentions is gone to Robt Bells to live. I am oblidged to ye, for thy readiness to serve me abt ye Cloth in R. Bells Hand, And as thou hasst ( I presume ) An Interest in S. Fledger I wish could persuade Him to goe buy then theyr good Goods and Cheaps and tho find He can dispose of them I doubt not to advantage If he pleases; Bros and Sister Longmire are not got home from Kendall where they have been some weeks.

I am glad thou art favoured with good health and strength to travel about as in the morning of thy day to be sure it must afford both thee and thy ffriends gt joy and satisfaction. yet those who oannot do so (are-added) attended with ye heart warming influence of divine virtue at Home, and truely acceptable to their ffriends there.\n\nHave also much Reason to be both content and thankful. through mercy I must enjoy a good degree of health which can scarce be enough valued but I (--) not much to say of traveling abroad not being required thereto, nor free to move much without a degree of necessity, friends here of thy acquaintance are all as well as ussuial for ought I know thy niece direy beging to look brgith(sic) upon us again but they are all well as can be expected. I delivered thyn love to them and many more who all acknowledge with the return of theirs, which I disir thee to aceept in the Wholesale way. and may say that upon the whole I hope truth gains ground among us in our meeting which dos not only much increase in number but in a religous concern As I think does our love one to another. I am much joined in Heart to friends here as I also have reason to believe thy are to me in every general way. I am sorry to hear Mr. Putts is but poorly, if he should be removed it will seemingly be a great loss. But we have need to be a resigned people in all things to ye Divine will. my heart is often heavy in the remembrance of London, Heaven only knows how things will turn out there and everywhere.\n\nI sincerely wish we may all be prepared steady on such abuttance as will stand all tryals. I notte thy kind request of seing me once more there but I also hope and disir with submission to the divine will that I never shall be seen there any more, being for ought I know clear yea fully clear there labouring at and about home appears to be my proper work yet the spreadings of Gospel love is many times as open free and extensive as ever in my heart. but thou knows that every one has but their time and season to every purposs and for ought I find the little erants alotted me to run abt was done in their season for which I do not want my reward. I have been long in writing - for which I have thought to drop that part except when found it matter of duty being old and bad at it. also my acquaintance is so large it would (be-added) almost impossible for me to answer all the letters I receive, so hope thou and others will excuse me for that deficencey and take the will for the deed my dear Love salutes thy sister Bell and thy children also my beloved friends D. and G.

Barclay, but realy such has been the case with me of late that notwithstanding Ive several times attempted to write my mind has been so uncommonly restricted in that respect that I found I Could not write with satisfaction; but least my dear Frd. shd be uneasy on my accot.

Plumstead as well as that of thy Cousin Oxley, they both being likely to be very serviceable in their Stationes but providence knows best how to effect the purpose of his unerring Will, nor is it fit for us poor short sighted mortals to call in question his Dispensations usward or so muoh as to say, What doest thou! I can assure my dr. ffrd it is no small Probation with me to be tried as Ive been of late and am likely still to be, if my life be spared; yet far be it from me to Reprove He who has hitherto been my Ebenezer and helped thro many Tribulations is still all sufficient; in whom I trust come life or come Death.\n\nI was much pleased to hear thou had been favoured with the Company of our dear and worthy frd.

Millyin to NewYork as there may probably be a conveyance to England from that port earlier than Quebec; I sent a few Lines by a Vessel that we met on the Banks of Newfoundland giving you an account of the very disagreeable Passage we had so far; since that time the Weather has been more favourable and we are now in the River St. Lawrence abt 20 Legs from the Isle of Bic ( he place for destination) on our arrival there we must go on board another Ship to reach Quebec wch is abt 50 Leags distant (the Blonde being ordered to New York to join Ld Howe instead of going to Quebec) - Till within these few days we have had one continued severe Gale of Wind from the Time of our departure from England, which has made our passage more disagreeable than a person who has never been at Sea can possibly conceive, our Style of Life has been thoroughly uncomfortable, in the morning we would attempt to Breakfast perhaps as soon as we were seated the Cups and Saucers would be all thrown into our Laps, from that to dinner we endeavour to read, walk the Deck and employ ourselves in recovering from our Fall, of wch we have had some very bad ones, at Dinner our meat was frequently in our Laps as in our Mouthes till we contrived to make the servants set to Seeward and hold their dishes instead of placing them on a table : One day Mrs. Caldwell and myself were thrown over the Backs of our Chairs on our Heads,\n\nMrs. C fortunately fell on a Bed wch was spread on the Floor, and therefore received no Injury. I fell on the Gun but without any bust, indeed I was lucky in meeting with no great Injury once I broke a small piece of a Tooth another time as I was pouring out a Glass of Wine I was thrown with the Bottle and Glass out of my Chair agt the Bayonets wch hang upon the Side of the Ship and cut my hand in 2 or 3 places. - the good Company of Col Caldwells Family and the Civility of Capt Hillyes have so much at abates(?) the Rigor of this Confinement and unpleasant Situation. Our passage has been so remarkably rough and boisterous, our Ship so sickly and many occurences so thoroughly distressing and disagreeable that if we get safe back to our native land I am sure it must be a great Temptation that will induce sny of our Party to venture a second time to cross the Atlan­tic; on Saturday 31st May two Strange Ships were seen, when Signal was made to chase, the Drum beat to Arms and every Man ordered to Quarters, it being 4 oclock in the Morning wee suddenly changed the pleasure of Tranquility and Sleep to the preparation for engageing but on coming up with the vessells they proved to be our Friends; they having mistaken to make the proper Signal gave us every reason to expect a different Tirmination to this Affair; we had another Alarm a few days since, by hearing a continued Canonading and having great Reason to suppose one of our own Fleet was engaged with a privateer but on our bearing down to them we had the Mortification to find they were celebrating the Kings Birth day; the Alacrity of the people and the Expertness of stowing every Thing away when a Ship\n\nThe musquitoes ( a kind of fly ) are a horrid Tax upon travelling in this Country. they sting thro leather and they are so venemous that the wound they make swells surprisingly, there was a man so stung the other day that he was blind and kept his Bed a week. They are thousand (times - added) more venemous than the Flies are at Stamford Hill in the Middle of July; I have hitherto been very fortunate as they have taken an antipathy to me and keep away from me wch is a very uncommon thing for a stranger.\n\nI am stopped in my career of writing by a letter I have just received from Quebec wch informs me that some Ships are going to England. I must forward my letters immediately as several vessels sail together. I have only time by the others to write a line to say that I arrived safe and am well lest the vessell wch carries this should fall into hands of the provincials.\n\nAdieu, Accept a large share of affection. give my Dear love to my Father, Betsey Lucy, Charlotte Becky, Chrissy Jonathan and Caroline and believe me wth every sentiment of Regard and Affection.\n\nYr dutyfull son,\n\nD.

Mrs. Bevan (-------------------------------------------------------- ?)\n\nMontreal Ist July 1777\n\nTo Bell from her son Daniel Bell\n\nDated 14th June 1777\n\nMy Dear Mother,\n\nOn my arrival at the Isle of Bic I wrote to my father and sent my letter by New York which I dare say will reach you before this, as there is no ship at present going to England. I arrived at this place after a very disagreeable passage of 2 months on Wednesday 11th June, and have since been introduced to almost all the Families of any Consequence in the place and have met with great Civility and Respect.\n\nI find that when a ship is going away for England I shall be so much hurried that it will not be in my power to write to many of my friends, I shall therefore make a kind of Journal of this letter and remark in it any occurence that happens to me wch is worth notice, as I think it will convey a better Idea to my Frs of my Situation than a few lines written in a hurry; almost immediately after my coming to Shore I took a walk round this town wch is so famous for the Signal Victory gained by Genl Wolfe ( over the French - added ) and the attack made on it last year by the american Rebels.\n\nIt is situate on a point of Land wch is formed by the Rivers St, Lawrence and St. Charles, the Country around it very romantic and pleasing. The Town itself dirty and disagreeable, Here are still remains of the attack made by Genl Wolfe on the plains of Abraham and too many dreadful marks of the late attempt by the Rebels.\n\nI have been too short a time to form any accurate Idea of the disposition or manner of the Canadians, tho they differ much from the English; as the Inhabitants were originally French they now retain the Language and customs of that Country; of late years several English and Scotish merchants have settled here and as they increase it is probable the French Customs will gradually wear away.\n\nI live with my Frd Mr. Davison who has introduced me to everybody here, I am just returned from dining with a large party at the Lt. Governors where there was every Elegance and Luxury that this Country affords.\n\nI was always too much attached to my own family and home to be equally happy in a Country where I no scarcely any body, but now look upon myself as a Citizen of the World and must endeavour to reconcile myself to any Situation and to pass my time happily in any place that my lot may be cast in; the present uncertain State of political matters makes it impossible for me at present to form any judgement of the time of my return tho it is probable that I shall be able to determine on this matter before I should have an opportunity of sending this letter.\n\nLetter from Daniel Bell to his father Daniel Bell\n\nDated at Quebec 7th August 1777\n\nMy Dear Father\n\nAfter an Absence of near 4 Months from my Friends, I had on Sunday the Pleasure of receiving a packet of Letters from home, amongst them was your Favor from the May, that, wch contained an account of little Occurences from our parting at Ports­mouth, wth letters from my sisters and has not reached me.\n\nYour Journal has been very entertaining to me and I should follow yr plan, but being now engaged in an entire new Set of Acquaintance, an account of the manner of passing my time would not be very interesting, as you are quite unacquainted with the Company with whom I associate, the Civility and Attention I receive from People in general here, makes my time pass as pleasantly as I can expect it at so great a distance from all my old Friends and Acquaintances \n\nLast Week I went out with a Gentleman an hour or two Cock Shooting, on the 24th July (strange time of year for this Diversion) we killed 3 couple - They are much smaller than ours, The plumage on the Back and Head the same, but their Breast are nearly as red as our robins - tomorrow I am going to look a parcel of Whistling Plover wch I have heard of for the first this Year, they are very plenty in the Fall - I believe there are few Countries in wch a Sportsman cannot find Entertainment.\n\nI am glad to find that you took notice of our Cosn Jaffrays and altho I spent some weeks at their House I brought my heart safely away  I fancy to their great astonishment; they seemed surprised and perhaps I may say, without Vanity, mistified, that Dawson Street had more Charms to me than their house - but so it was  Their Good Sense had more Effect on my Judgement and their Civilities on my Gratitude than their Beauty or Charms on my heart - in the other Place I had Good Sense - Civility and every Thing than can render a woman pleasing to struggle againts and therefore it is not much to be wondered at, that much possessions and Accomplishments get the better of a Resolution, wch wanted the Aid of Inclination for its Support.\n\nIn answer to my Mothers letter I have wrote my Mind very fully in this subject to wch I refer you, as I am sure you are interested in my Feelings on a Matter wch affects me so nearly - I am still quite at a loss to think when I shall return, but from what I can gather,\n\nI begin to doubt the possibility of getting to the Southuran eiiher by Land or Water; in wch Case I shall very probably eat my Xmas Dinner at Stamford Hill - altho the immense Atlandtic Ocean is between us.-\n\nI have wrote to you very frequently lately and therefore as I am now much hurried I shall new (sic) finish  Remember me to all my Friends and believe me wth most affectionate Regard to all the Family.\n\nYour dutiful son D.B.\n\nGen Burgoyn is proceeding fast on his way to Albany and does not at present expect to meet much resistance from the Rebels.\n\n7.3.3 Agatha (Barclay) Gurney Death\n\nMrs Bell at Mr John Gurney, jnr Norwich\n\nProb eldest son of Daniel & Katherine Bell.\n\nLondon, 2nd April 1776\n\nMy dear mother,\n\nThy own feelings on the melancholy events of the dissolution of my dear Cozn Agatha (Gurney) will enable thee to judge of those friends she has left here  If to a husband the removal of the best of wives, to a father that of the best of children & to a friend, the best of friends is distressing, what must not these near relatives have suffered in this dispensation of Providence; that the ways of the Almighty are just we can never doubt & that whatever is to him is right we may rest assured, yet nevertheless we at a loss to account for what valuable purpose a person of such eminent virtue & so many most excellent qualities can have been taken from us, one who might have lived a bright example to lead other in the same paths of rectitude & purity which doubtless have conducted her to endless felicity\n\nI hope that the same power which has been pleased to deprive them of this most valuable blessing will enable her friends to support with becoming resignation & fortitude this severe and afflicting stroke.\n\nI am full of apprehension on account of my dear sister Gurney, this effect that a knowledge of this calamitous circumstance once may have on her on her present critical situation may be of the most material consequence What a loss must she suffer?\n\nI am very anxious to hear how she goes on.\n\nPray give my dear love to my brother John, tell him I would write to him but as I can afford him no particular consolation, I think it better to avoid enlarging on a subject so replete with the most distressing circumstances to all our connections as he will know my anxiety on account of Kitty?? & hope he will relieve it by writing frequently\n\nWe are all well, - give my dear love to Kity, Beccy, Jonathan & Caroline & believe me with sincere affection,\n\nYour dutiful son\n\nD Bell jnr?\n\nRefers to Agatha Barclay, married John Gurney, died 31/3/1776\n\n7.3.4 Daniel Bell, later generations, Letters\n\nAddressed Mrs Bell, Stamford Hill, London.\n\nDublin Wednesday 2nd 17?\n\nMy Dear Mother,\n\nI am so well convinced that it will add to your pleasure to hear of my safe arrival on this side, that I gladly embrace the first opportunity to communicate\n\nWe arrived this day after a pleasant journey and passage\n\nThe pain of leaving my friends was not a little increased by the consideration of the indisposition in which I left you, I most anxiously hope to receive accounts of your continuing to mend & I flatter myself with the pleasing expectation of meeting you again in a few weeks in perfect health.

However, I assure you, much as you are in my thoughts, our way of life is so very monotonous that it affords at present little scope for remark. How different are your delightful journals to us! You can guess the routine of every day with us but we can know nothing of you except from what you tell us & the complete satisfaction your charming letters bestow can be better conceived than described. Last night we were gratified by one to Kate, by which I am most happy to find you are becoming more . & accustomed to a way of life .. & in some respects so trying. I have no longer any fears for your happiness, my dear Maria, nor any doubt that you will derive great advantages in many ways from the exertions you are obliged to make. By the way, we have not yet seen the promised letter to Emma, containing many things we want to know, but we conclude it is coming by the Ambassadors Bag.\n\nWe never had our time so much to ourselves as now since the year 1814. Since the Gaussis left Hornsey, we have not had a single engagement I think at home or abroad. Last Friday however deserves notice. I went to town to shop, & met Mrs Trimbey in Watling Street. That house is often now the . Of assignations of one sort or other. She gave me a very good account of all the Bathamites, but a letter lately from James speaks of a severe bilious attack he has had, in consequence of which he writes in rather low spirits, & no wonder, poor fellow, at such a distance from his home. He has been very unlucky in missing several important letters from his family about the recent occurrences, which is very vexatious to them here. I do not find any movements making towards towards a conclusion of the matrimonial affairs, but I fancy Mr H is growing very important as the courting interferes very much with his business. I think this should induce them to shorten his probation. I returned by the coach, & went to tea to Mrs Cornthwaites with Kate & Emma, quite en famille & spent a very pleasant evening. I had not been there since the 6th Septer: when you, dear Maria, were of the party. Mrs T. told me she heard Mrs Hankin had been very poorly, we have seen or heard nothing of Chrissy or the young man.\n\nFriday 15th: I have just had the great delight of hearing good part of dear Maryannes letter to Eliza read. It has made me feel so happy & thankful! I am always fancying my dear Maria in some of the situations described in your various letters: & always my heart dilates with the belief that she will act worthy of her principles, & make the most & best of every thing with a cordial reliance on Devine support & protection. While I think of it I must beg you to furnish yourself as opportunity & funds will allow, with a good stock of cambric hanks, as many as you can bring over made & washed without risk, as they will be most useful & acceptable. I suppose you might bring two dozen without suspicion, as the French I believe keep generally a good stock of linen. If you are obliged to mark them put only a B. J. Trimbey is much better.\n\nSunday 17th: This is the second Sunday we have been detained at home by weather. Papa has been looking over the Port folios, & has selected your sketch of boys to hang up in his room, & we have also determined to decorate the parlour with Reston & the Feeling Drawing. You cannot imagine dear Maria how pleased your father has been! He said I will bet a wager Maria will bring home some capital drawings from France!\n\nThursday 21st: Our Xmas gaieties began on Tuesday eveg. my dear Maria, by a very agreeable party at the Johnstons, abt 40 persons assembled to what was a called & appeared in their large rooms, a small party. The greater part were young, & danced Quadrilles; we knew almost every Lady. The St Johns took us in their coach. Papa self, Kate & Emma. Dramatis Personae. Daviss, Rhodes, Prescots, Barons (to whom I made apologies which were graciously received) & Miss Henderson of Newington, Hayters, Misses Watrrd, Mr Shaw, & other beaux whose names I could not learn, & pour comble de bonheur, the Gillmans & Coleridge,[147] who was in high tune. He talked of Animal Magnetism, the Magnetic Pole, the Queen, the progress of civilizations, etc. Poor Miss Johnston can only speak in a whisper, but was very cheerful & agreeable as usual, they mean to keep her entirely at home thro the winter, but hope their friends will go to see them, which, of course, we shall not object to. I am truly grieved to tack to this cheerful scene a circumstance of real concern to us all: but thus it must be in journal writing, for, as we have often observed, every day has its vicissitudes of joy & grief, pleasure & pain. Our amiable & promising friends the Cauries are on the list of sufferers by the late dreadful failures in the mercantile world, of which I dare say, the report has reached Bordeaux. I have heard no particulars yet. Also the Mr Lasue whom we met at Trimbeys at a dance long ago, has failed.- Tomorrow, my dearest Maria, we shall become more at liberty, & I wish I must not listen to voices in my heart: that only beloved girl could be transported here just for one month: Instead of indulging such thoughts, I must dwell with delight on the conviction that you are well & happy, & in the path of duty, & let me add, that nearly three tedious months are elapsed of your absence.\n\nChristmas day. I have thought so much of you, my dearest Maria, this day, that I cannot be satisfied without telling you so. We have just left the dinner room & the young ones are looking over their money boxes. Dillon & his cousin Robert made us just a dayson. The Boardalais were drank in Claret. I long to know how you spend this festive day. Last Friday we had a grand musical treat. Mr Horn & his son Chat & a pupil of his who played the violin delightfully. They played almost missantly from 4 oclock to one in the morning & from 9 to 12 the next day & then left us. Arpold near here, & highly pleased. This reminds me of Kates Dahlias which are finished & beautiful. Their children were later than usual this time. The day of breaking up was the 22d, but the Pryors, Bolston & Carston staid till the 23rd. You swill be glad to hear their Exercises in general were capital: quite as much improved as could be expected. Miss Lees made two excellent translations into French & Italian. Minnie & Louisa transposed extremely well: the former Cowpers poor family in the winter evening: the latter, the Introduction of the Last Minstrel. EK worked very hard to finish her mass, which she did except a few words. They have all been perfectly well, thro the half-year, which is a blessing for which we can never be thankful enough. Farewell dearest.\n\nSunday 31st: I have been from home, my dearest girl, since Xmas-day: On Tuesday I went to my Mothers, & staid till the next day. She & Louisa & Aunt Hannah are quite weak. On Wednesday I met Mrs Trimbey at Clapham Church, & had the unexpected pleasure of a sermon from Mr Deattry, 16th verse 3d Ch: 1 Epis: Timothy. I spent three most happy days with them & retd home yesterday. As Maria sent you a letter on Friday, I shall add nothing but that they are all remarkably well. I saw your account of the S. family in your letter to her. Did I not mention to you that I had seen Mr Harrison? He is a very agreeable looking man I think, & I was sorry to see so little of him. It is droll enough he should think I scrutinised him so much, but indeed I could not help looking at him. I heard there that Dan, George & Chrissy Hankin had all been very ill of a fever of some kind, & the former still continues so. Kate Holdsworth is in the same situation, but was rather better before I came away. Emma Danvers & Jane Hamilton are also seriously ill, & Mrs Mason still confined to the house. Here is a formidable sick list, but it is to be hoped, before this reaches you, they will all be convalescent. I am happy to tell you that the Gaweirs affairs are not so bad as was at first represented. They have however lost a large sum of money & will probably be obliged to make some retrenchments. Who knows but they may come back to Hornsey? Tuesday we are all going to Mr Oliphants, & shall call in Tupel Square. I am not going to my Mothers till the latter end of the holidays, but Kate & Emma are to pay her a visit, & also to Balham  I must now, dear, turn to your delightful letter received yesterday with one to Eliza & one from M. to the same, all of which contained matter highly interesting. I am afraid you will think you wait a long while for another letter, but there are so many to write that we are obliged to take turns. On the whole, I think you have, with those to your cousins, a letter a week, & that is a good deal. I have not yet had any application about a scholar, not a word of Mr Crawley Wards or of Miss M. Browne. But the Xmas account is not of such a nature as to make me dread a discontinuance of our present happy plan of united industry. The terms of E.S. are not quite settled: but of course I shall make them as moderate as I can. While on this subject, my dear Maria, I wish to ask you how you think we should proceed with the mass. A good many are done, but not looked over. I think to do this; & make the girls learn them after their return, the younger ones are going thro the disputed mass. Julia gets on rapidly now, you would like to see her trudging up to her Papa every morning, with her bible under her arm, to read a few verses, with such an important air! I am almost afraid, my beloved girl, to enter on your next subject. The prospect of your return seems involved in obscurity. Edward never writes a letter to any of us, which, I must own, surprises me: Kate is expecting to hear from him every post, but I suppose he cannot yet form his plans with any decision. I sincerely hope his rise  consulship will not stand in the way of our seeing him, as to the time, I certainly would not wish you to come over till you may reasonably expect good weather, that is, after the Equinox, & if your Uncle wishes very much that you should accompany the girls to the Pyrenees, I should be concerned to prevent your taking such a beautiful tour: & I think you would also regret having missed it, merely for the sake of shortening your absence a month, which I suppose would be the outside. However you must not take this as a positive permission. While Kate is with us, we can spare you pretty much, especially if there should be no great accession of scholars: but I should be sorry to put any obstacle in the way of that conclusion which I knst will give satisfaction to us all. Thus, dear, you see I can say nothing: we must be guided by circumstances as they arise, but you will not fail to acquaint me with your uncles plans & wishes, & with all the probable chances there may be of a safe & proper conveyance for you, if Edward is obliged to disappoint us. I hope, at least, you will now enjoy his company uninterrupted during the rest of your stay, & may the next three months pass, on the whole, as well as the three last, & we may be well contented.\n\nHobbes lost Miss Vaux by neglect before they went to Brighton. He is elected to the Naemonists instead of Edward. I am grieved to say E. Vaux is again very poorly, & Barclay Head has sunk under an attack of consumption  Indeed, my dearest Maria, I dare not think of parting with your darling sister: but I believe the thought of her happiness will reconcile me to it: & it seems quite Dillons wish as much as ours, to find a house in our road at least. It must be near town, as he has always a great deal of walking, but not in town. He hopes to find a house about the City Road. I did not think this event would come so near without disturbing my tranquility more than it does: but her prospects, with a man of such persevering affection, appears so comfortable that I own the agreeable feelings predominate. A Thans and Thanks, my dear girl, for your dutiful & affectionate expressions on this subject. What a happy Mother am I, who in parting with a daughter like Kate, can yet feel assured that her place will be amply supported!  I have lately finished Butlers Analogy, which I admire more than ever. At present, my studies are at a stand-still, as is usually the case when I seem to have most leisure: but visiting & needle-work then claim their dues. I have begun a beautiful piece of lace-work to Miss Reess pattern, which I enjoy very much. It is three yards long, & I have done a quarter.\n\nThere has been no news of Ellen Browne since Emma wrote you. All your friends here are constant in their enquiries after you. Eliza is at this moment writing to you, but you must not expect the letter immediately. She desires one to express her warmest thanks for the two received yesterday. We are all perfectly well thank God! I think the riding lesson must be very serviceable to you, as walking exercise seems hard to obtain. How very kind of Uncle! But no generosity of his can ever surprise me. Pray remember me affectionately to him, & also the dear girls & Edward. Tell the latter he must write. I am happy to hear a good account of Fanny & the children. I am glad to find you like Miss Trent, & that Annie improves. You are so many people it would be hard to find them all frivolous or inspired: but we are rather spoiled for general society. We are perpetually talking of, & wishing for you: the holy days seem wrong without you, but they, like the months of school, will soon pass away. Believe me my dearest Maria, your most affectionate Mother Maria Bell.\n\nKate sends her love aux belles jumelles. & Papa, & all the boys & girls theirs to you. I have just recollected I have not wished you all a happy new-year, which I now do with all fervency. May the Great Disposer guide, protect, and lead you into all good, & keep you from all evil Amen!\n\nMrs Brett in her last, Desires me to reserve a little corner for her kindest love.\n\nShe is well, & so is Emily & her two fine boys. The Lloyds are now in town, but Mrs B. says nothing of the affair at Midhurst.\n\nHornsey 27th Jany 1821.\n\nNear gailach\n\nTo my greatest delight, my dearest Maria, I am once more at home; & seated at my own desk, intend to begin a letter which I hope to dispatch on Tuesday next, just four weeks since my last. I will give you a sketch of the party in the dining room, which is but small. Tea being dismissed, Papa & Mr Martin are chatting. Jonny & Louisa at draughts, Jasper looking on, & Emma Simpkinson at work. I brought her up from Kingston this morning, & having put her with Nomrey work, I went to meet Mrs Trimbey in Watling Street & walked about with her paying bills, etc. On returning to Suffolk Lane to go home, I saw uncle Bell & was glad to hear a very good account of them all, particularly Lucy. I will answer now your enquiries after the sick list in yours to Emma, (which I found here, & accounted to read, as she will not be at home till the middle of next week: but Edwards to Kate, & those to Eliza are under lock & key till their return.) Jane Hamilton is convalescent tho so weak as only to lifted from one bed to another. E Danvers sometimes better, sometimes worse, still very ill. D. Handin recovering but very weak. Poor Kate Holesworth in a very critical & dangerous state, as Mr Pryor says, the fever not subdued. What reason we have to be thankful for our happy exemption from these trials! I am most happy to hear your account of your own health & that of the dears with you, & we here are equally flourishing, granering blowing, all alive! As your last letter my dear girl is in my trunk, which I cannot get at to-night, I will employ the present in giving you some account of my proceedings, tho it is likely you will have a tried-told tale, as the girls are not here to refer to. But first, methinks you exclaim all & Ma Where are they? Well then Kate is at my Mothers since Thursday, & El & Em are gone to Baldack to celebrate the majority of Mr John Pryor. You are quite right in your speculations for twelth day, which was kept in due form on the Friday preceding at Mr Cornthwaites . All went but Jonny & Julia. The former had a young friend with him for a few days, named Lawrence, who did not like dancing: the latter was invited, but, for various reasons, I did not like her to go, so she drank tea, played at Posse with the aforesaid, & kept her eyes wide open till 11 oclock. The next Tuesday Louisa was asked to a similar party at Mrs Misages where she slept, & we all dined that day at Higginsons. Met the Carnthwaites & Pages, & spent a pleasant day. Mrs H. in good spirits. Wednesday, the 10th W Eade came, & Thursday the little Co. 3 Tioays & Juke Trimbey, with Messrs Jones & Dillon made up a grand Inadrille at our house which they all seemed to enjoy. W. Eade left us the next day, & Louisa went to pay a London visit to Miss Greenhill, Emma to Clapham Rise & I to Mrs Brett, whom I found pretty well. I staid till Saturday, when Edward came to see us & staid till Tuesday. I found him better than I had expected from the account we had heard, but he is far from well. The complaint has now taken a different turn & affects his spirits in a sad way. It appears a sort of hypochondria, which is often the result of a deranged stomach. Poor fellow! He has been & is a great sufferer, & he is so truly amiable, one cannot but feel greatly interested about him. I must not, however, pass over dear Wm without a word of remark. He is indeed a charming youth, & I do not wonder his sisters are so fond of him. I do not recollect any-thing worth particular mention during this time except our [Papa] reading the play of the Rivals at last, which made us laugh quite as much as we expected, & Edward was much amused. Also Mr Lingee read prayers on the 14th & preached in the afternoon, but I was not much struck with him. He preached again a very fine sermon last Sunday, but that I lost. Thursday the 18th Jonny & Jasper went to a childs dance at St Johns & on Friday I went to Clapham Rise, having called in my way at Balham Hill where I found all well. Aunt Louisa was in bed with a bad headache, & could not go to a dance at Mr Joseph Bonds: but Miss Bond was so kind as to insist on Emmas going & to continue the manner of it, & as she met the Lavenhills/bride & all/ & the Newington Moncey she passed a very pleasant evening. The next day she returned to Hornsey, & Aunt, having applied six leeches by Mr Pryors order, was quite recovered, & I enjoyed my short visit there very much. I am sorry to say, however, that Grand Mama was several times teaged with her spasms, but P. says they are not alarming tho very painful. Papa Th. Ed, Jonny went on that Friday to a grand party at Johnstons. On the 24th my Mother took me to Kingston/ Kate went to Balham the 22d/. They were all well except colds, but uncle was gone to see after his uncle, who had been seriously indisposed, but I believe the good gentleman will hold a good fight yet. I called on the hetelier & was sorry to find Elizabeth with a constant little cough & stooping very much. I never think of her without regretting that she did not return to School for another year, for I feel confident that Gillman would have set her up in health, & she would have been a different creature now. Caroline I think much improved in appearance & manners, but their way of life is almost too retired. I called at Ruvislidly they were out walking, but finding my card on their return, Mrs R ordered the carriage & came to see me; which gave me great pleasure, for I have not seen them for a twelvemonth. I assure you, my Dear Maria, I feel, as you will think, that I have had enough of engagements & long to return to a course of useful employment. However I believe there accession all dissipations are beneficial, & I could not be happy without sometimes seeing my friends. I flatter myself E. Surite be lucky to us. One or two others are on the tapis, but I cannot speak with certainty, therefore will not name them. I will not attempt a description of my new scholar till I have seen more of her, for three years make a great difference in a child, & she appears much improved in person & manners. Good night my dearest! May you rest well beneath the wings of our Heavenly Guardian!\n\nTuesday morn: 30th: This, my dearest Maria, is the day appointed for assembling our little flock & I cannot help wishing you were by my side to share our labours, tho I can truly say, I have more & more earnestly wished for you to share our holy day pleasures, but of amusement you do not seem to stand in need just now. I am very sorry that not the least glimmering of certainty yet appears about your return. I wish, my dear girl, you would write to me confidentially, what you really prefer yourself, by which I mean whether you would choose to come home if possible with Capt Baxter in April or May, or whether you could be willing to remain a few months longer if I could make up my mind to spare you, on thinking of Edwd bringing you over in the Autumn. Also if you can discover what are your Uncles real wishes on the subject, as to the girls there can be no doubt. I do not say that I could without detriment to the School, do without your assistance so long: but the knowledge of your own inclinations might assist me in deciding, for if you were not perfectly happy, nay, desirous to prolong your stay, it would not be worth while to make any sacrifice for it. As to Kates affair, I have no idea of the precise period when it is likely to terminate, but I will not throw any impediment in the way of that. She returned home yesterday as Edwad letter contains not a syllable on your subject, which has disappointed me, but I shall write to him shortly. We had a dinner party. The Gillmans Coleridge, Hilary, Mrs & Miss Reynolds, a pleasant day. I have not yet noticed your dear long letters. I was much entertained by the debate on Geaneology & required to find Eds ideas so worthy of the subject of immortality, tho not perfectly congenial with my own, I believe I said something about it, in a little note sent in a parcel thro a friend of Dillons to the Ambassador .. from hence, which we hope will arrive safe & free & Its very horrid to lose letters, ûnstant comme les nôtres. I think M.J. has had the one you mention, as she showed me a passage in one from you concerning the Scotts. Your account of Xmas-day is very amusing, as well as Le jour des Etrennes, in fact, nothing can be more delightful than to engage this free communication which so completely brings you before our eyes. I think you do not mention what books you get to read. I should like much to know: & what Signre Bellvere recommends to you. Have you read Ceonelle or Jacine? Or any of Voltaires? The Hornade for example. I should think his prose words unfit for you. I shall think of my dear girl with peculiar interest next Sunday, when I hope to receive the sacrament. I .. that you had the gratification of communicating with dear Edward. I suppose you will only have it administered on the great festivals, as I believe most foreign churches think it right to use that solemn ordinance sparingly, I mean of course, the Reformed Churches. And as you have but a small congregation, perhaps your English clergymen may find it often enough. I am glad, my dearest Maria, you are beginning to flow out a little towards your present society, as it will make your stay with them much more agreeable. Do the girls pursue their dancing with you, or have they a Master? Edward does not mention his wife or children. He seems to think you female writers leave him nothing to say: but that is a little mistake, as I wish to hear his opinions on various points, which I can hear only from himself. However I shall write him soon & then I suppose he will answer not. Kate brings account that B. Holesworth is rather better, so I trust she will have no relapses. I called on Mrs Magan Sunday, but she was too weak & poorly"
