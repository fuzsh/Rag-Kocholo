        "text": "Joan and her husband Eugene raised their 9 children in the Catholic faith, spending many of their young family years within the community and parish of St. Thomas Aquinas church & elementary School in Milwaukee. It wasn't always easy for such a large family, but there were other large families within the parish too. Eugene sometimes had to work two jobs. Joan, who had worked in the telephone industry as an operator, took other work as a receptionist for St. Anthony's Hospital. Soon, shifting her vision, she began attending MATC to become a Registered Nurse to help support their growing family and continued in this field until she retired from Watertown Hospital in 2001.\n\nJoan's young family were not all brought up in the big city of Milwaukee. She, Eugene and the younger half of their children not yet attending college, lived a good many years on their Neillsville farm. Attaining the dream of her husband Eugene to return to an agrarian life. Joan continued on as an RN, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield, when economic pressures of the 1980's were putting many small family-owned farms out of business, they sold their farm and moved to Watertown. Joan got a position as an RN with Watertown Hospital. Joan's now smaller family, moved from town to a small farm they purchased outside of town on Engelhardt Road. They resided there until her husband Eugene retired from working a rural route for the Watertown Daily Times. Joan was still employed as an RN at Watertown Hospital. At this point, their children were grown and living lives of their own. Joan and Eugene moved again, downsizing their lives to their current home on Oak Hill Court in Watertown.\n\nBoth, in their elder years, they were attended by their youngest daughter Karen as both advocate and caretaker. Joan's husband Eugene passed away on April 17th, 2019. Joan followed just 4 years later. Their children love and greatly miss them both.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials in Joan's name to St. Henry's Catholic Church would be appreciated.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 12:00PM on Saturday, January 6, 2024 at St. Henry's Catholic Church of Watertown with Fr. Timothy Renz presiding. Visitation will be held from 10:00AM until the time of service at the church. Joan will be laid to rest at St. Henry's Catholic Cemetery following the mass.\n\nThe Schmutzler-Vick Funeral Home is caring for the family. To place an online condolence please visit www.sv-fh.com"
