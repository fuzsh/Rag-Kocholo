        "text": "ADAMS CENTER, New York (WWNY) - Roselyn June Taylor, 78, of Adams Center, passed away at Upstate Medical Center on April 20, 2024 surrounded by her family. A memorial service will be at 4:00 pm Saturday April 27 at the Piddock Funeral Home in Adams, NY with David Woodruff pastor, officiating. Calling hours will precede the funeral beginning at 2:00pm. Burial will be private at a later time.\n\nArrangements are with the Piddock Funeral Home Inc, Adams, NY.\n\nBorn January 16, 1946 in Adams Center, daughter of Raymond and Mable (Sampson) Churchill, she was one of seven children. She attended the Burrville school house and then Watertown High School and received her Bachelor’s Degree from Empire College. She worked at GTE Sylvania in Camillus NY, Northland Electric in Watertown, NY, Shearson Lehman in Watertown NY and she then found her passion in her professional work at Fort Drum in EEO as an Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor.\n\nShe devoted her career advocating for women, minorities and people with disabilities, making a path for people both individually and organizationally. She made a point to find strengths in people and made sure they knew their value, championed those in need and was the voice who had none. She retired from Fort Drum in 2008.\n\nGrowing up in Burrville she had the most awesome childhood. Her father was an avid beekeeper as he and her mother were renowned for excellent\n\ncomb honey production. She and her siblings grew up in a world filled with bees and honey at Churchill Honey Farms.\n\nWhen she was 5 years old, she got a pony and from then on became an avid horse woman. Rosey spent much time on her grandparent’s farm in Rutland (Tylerville). Everyone enjoyed her company with and without comedic twists. Even her horse ‘Bear’ thought it was funny to run really fast to the pond at the Churchill Road farm but stop on the edge while Rosey flew sailing into the pond for an unexpected swim. Gathering sap with a team of horses and making maple syrup at the sugar house was a yearly tradition. It was common to see Rosey and her horse “Betsy” pulling the buggy about Burrville with all the siblings in tow much to the neighborhoods delight.\n\nA previous marriage to Reginald Edmonds ended in divorce. She later married Howard Dennis Taylor on May 18, 1990. The couple lived a peaceful life on the Sheepy Hollow Farm in Rodman. Together they carved out a piece of heaven in love and devotion to family and a passion for farm life, love of horses and RV camping wherever the trails would take them.\n\nRosey loved nature, spending many summers camping with her horses at Otter Creek. On the weekend they would embark on a horse camping trip to Otter Creek or most anywhere hitting the trails. Her children and grandchildren were with them nearly every trip. She was a Master Gardener, a member of the Jefferson County Garden Club and an avid reader. Most of all, she loved spending time with her family, hosting many family gatherings. Dinners and foods, paintings, crafts, activities or just to hob knob it was all the same to her. She loved the sweets at those family gatherings especially blackberry pie, everything chocolate, lush and all things maple. She also enjoyed listening to Helen Reddy, Kris Kristofferson, Rita Coolidge, Gordon Lightfoot, Rolling Stones and of course Creedence Clearwater Revival.\n\nSurviving besides her husband Howard Dennis Taylor, is son Scott (Shayne) Edmonds, Tylerville, NY; daughter Kristen Edmonds (Jason Rarick), Rodman, NY; grandchildren Erik (Megan) Edmonds, Dexter, NY, Elise (Shawn) Keefe, Moravia, NY, Hailey (Hayden) Birtch, Kempner, TX, Madison Wilks (fiancé Tyril Farmer), Rodman, NY; great-grandchildren Wyatt, Leo, Hollis, Harper & Hazel; stepsons Jason Taylor, Eric Taylor, Travis (Becky) Taylor; stepgrandchildren Alexandra, Isabella, Caitlin, Hannah, Adelaide, Iris, Juliette and Arlo; and many nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nShe is also survived by six siblings, Rebecca Churchill, Buskirk, NY, Rita (Lloyd) Woodruff, Copenhagen, NY, Rhonda (Richard) Daniels, Eustis, FL, Roxanne (Edward) Mustizer, Sackets Harbor, NY, Roland ‘Rolly’ (Vicky) Churchill, Burrville, NY and Rae (Paul) Haynes, Canastota, NY.\n\nShe was loved by friends, family and all the many who knew her.\n\nDonations in her memory may be made to the South Jefferson Rescue Squad, PO Box 126, Adams, NY 13605.\n\nCondolences and memories may be made at www.piddockfuneralhome.com"
