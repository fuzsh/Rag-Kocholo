And all this in her first few months.\n\nThe future of the agency is certainly bright with Dani in the hot seat, with one eye on the present and one in the future, she recently appointed a new senior executive team, made up of a cross section of digital and creative talent, not only the best of the best but also the right fit for her future vision, those committed to the team and to take the agency into its next era.\n\nI’m where I am today because… of my amazing family, friends and colleagues who supported me and all those who didn’t (fuel to the fire).\n\n@dannibass\n\nDipa started her career in the fashion industry, working on digital design and art direction for brands such as Burberry, Warehouse, TOPSHOP and Ted Baker. She also made her mark across the revamped Crabtree & Evelyn brand redesign.\n\nNow Senior Digital Designer at Wunderman, her work across a broad sector base doesn’t just start and end at design. She fully immerses herself into the strategy and UX teams striving to find the best design solution possible and feeding into customer experience.\n\nSince leaping into the ad agency world, she has broadened her skillset to work across more digital tech-led projects such as apps, AI and VR. You can see some of Dipa’s work in the recent Fund Female campaign as well as across the Selfridges ecommerce experience, style guide and online look and feel.\n\nGiven the chance, I’d tell… my younger self to trust my own instincts and take more risks!\n\n@DipaThanki\n\nEmma is a creative, author, blogger, vlogger, budding stand-up comedian, five times TEDx speaker and regular on the tech conference circuit.

Emma is also Creative Lead at Parkinson’s UK and last year spearheaded the creation of their Devices and Apps library to help those with the condition discover effective and safe tech.\n\nMy favourite quote/saying is… ‘Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.’ Andre Gide\n\n@ems_lawton\n\nGemma started a global movement that encourages and celebrates the achievements of IT architects, with a particular focus on women, who are vastly underrepresented. In 14 months, over 2,000 people globally have been inspired to start progressing towards technical project leadership roles. Thanks to this movement, Gemma has helped a small corner of IBM cover new ground in the salesforce.com technology space.\n\nGemma also writes a blog that provides exam tips and tells the personal story of her fight with breast cancer. Gemma values learning and now strives to become a technical authority, having recently attempted the Salesforce Certified Technical Architect exam. Only 5% of the 250+ certification holders worldwide are women, so she is keen to show others that it’s achievable.\n\nAt school I… was often in trouble, because I wanted to know why the rules existed in the first place\n\n@gemziebeth\n\nJared is a data scientist at Atos- Google AI Lab a global leader in digital transformation.

Recently Jared has been working in the Atos-Google AI Lab alongside AI experts from both Atos and Google to show clients the power of artificial intelligence and how it can be applied within their organisations.\n\nI am where I am today because… I’ve had an amazing family supporting me who I strive to make proud, in particular my little brother.\n\nAs Director of Marketing at WPP martech agency, Cognifide, Josie champions CSR and sustainability. Over the last 2 years, she has coordinated the establishment of a strategic sustainability framework that allows colleagues across the organisation to determine where and how they make a difference. Last year alone, the company supported 13 individual projects, involving over 100 staff and over 390 hours of volunteering. Josie oversees all UK initiatives and has personally advocated for several, with a particular emphasis\n\non gender balance and inclusion. In 2018, these included working with the charity Hestia to help women suffering from domestic abuse; with #techmums, to reconnect women with technology and with the charity, You Make It, to help transform young lives.\n\nMy desert island luxury would be… Friends. Is that allowed? I can’t imagine being stranded anywhere on my own for too long.\n\n@JosieKlaf\n\nAs Client Strategy Director, Karen Pearce has shaped Digirank into what it is today: a people-powered, insight hungry, award-winning, and strategic digital marketing agency.\n\nKaren leads our team of talented digital experts.

It’s shaped by people and creativity, there really are no limits to what can be achieved.\n\n@karenhowells1\n\nSince taking over as Head of Digital Marketing for Jellyfish Connect, Matthew has transformed the way the digital marketing team works, both structurally and with regards to its progressive approach to technology and growth. Under his leadership, the team have been able to deliver 22% year-on-year growth across its 3 core products whilst still being able to reduce costs, streamline procedures and work more efficiently.\n\nKey to this success over the last year has been down to Matthew bringing all channels into one central team, moving away from a siloed approach and moving towards an omni-channel strategy that allows for greater expansion across all channels and has now set the framework for continued future growth.\n\nMy favourite quote is… ‘A man who stops advertising to save money is like a man who stops a clock to save time.’ Henry Ford\n\n@matthewread88\n\nPhil is Founder and Creative Director of BAFTA-winning gamestudio PRELOADED.

It is his mission to ensure all the developers, across the globe feel supported and well-informed on client projects whilst also leading into new digital frontiers.\n\nWhen it comes to innovative agency projects he leads the way in tech on client proof-of-concepts including a Virtual Concierge (Microsoft Chatbot) for travel giant, Red Carnation Hotels.\n\nAs well as being the first developer to write Augmented Random Search in C#; a cutting-edge AI technique like Google DeepMind and can teach a robot to walk by experience.\n\nMy favourite quote/saying is… let one walk alone, committing no sin, with few wishes, like elephants in the forest.\n\n@richardbrisley\n\nHaving previously led the marketing function he stepped into a newly formed role to lead the development of the organisation’s digital programme – building direct relationships with the fans, grassroots volunteers and players in the game. The work so far has involved the development of a single customer database and a step- change of The FA’s digital platform to directly support engagement in the game across both men’s and women’s football from elite to grassroots. The launch of Matchday with PayPal and FA Superkicks apps are at the heart of a modern engagement approach.\n\nThe future potential of OTT, wearables and how technology innovation will shape the football experience for all is also a key part of his focus.\n\nMy favourite quote/saying is… “If it matters enough to you, you’ll find a way to get it done, if it doesn’t then you’ll find an excuse.”\n\n@jamesrm\n\nAccording to their website, anything is possible. They believe it so much they made it their brand.\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Sam and the agency he co-founded in 2018. Multiple awards, client wins andrapid growth followed, proving integrated media, creative and consultancy services deliver a compelling proposition. Sam is challenging the traditional client/ agency model and bringing back client trust in their agency partners.\n\nSuccess is measured by their impact on a client’s triple bottom line – profit, people, and their impact on the planet. They link their payment models directly to success. His introduction of development funding for life and a tech innovation fund supporting self-build projects has made Anything is Possible a great place to work.\n\nNot many people know that I… gave up my job and spent a year on honeymoon, travelling the world with my wife. It was the initial spark that inspired Anything is Possible.\n\n@sjfe\n\nBefore joining Facebook, Zaynah studied at The Global Academy where her passion for tech grew. Previously she attended a grammar school, an environment she could not thrive in. Even though facing societal and family pressure, she took a risk and decided to build a new path for herself. She set up her own business using Instagram called Zaynah’s Bakes, a home-sale cupcake business where she reached 16,000 people within the first 2 weeks. Zaynah also built a strong portfolio through various work experience and internships. She is now working in the marketing team at Facebook where she is responsible for managing regional campaigns which run across Facebook & Instagram. Currently she is working on a program which supports young BAME women in Tech\n\n& Apprenticeships, which she wishes to launch in the near future.\n\nGiven the chance, I’d tell… my younger self: “You’re doing great sweetie”.\n\n@zaynahdin\n\nAlice has been a revelation since joining Tribal Worldwide London from AKQA in Melbourne. She is the safest of hands, in terms of account handling, but never rests on her laurels challenging both the internal team and the client to do better, to try new things or a different approach. She is brilliant at balancing the client needs of today around performance, but also with a view to thinking about the future of their business and how the agency can support them on that journey. This strategic thinking has been developed further through her MBA studies, which somehow, she is able to pursue at the same time as working full time with the demands of our clients – truly a superhuman effort.\n\nAlly has worked day and night to make the BFS a huge success. She has transformed the lives of so many people and most importantly addressed an overlooked part of the creative industry: she has created ‘equity’. This means giving people who would not have access or opportunity to our ‘network’ driven sector means and a pathway in. Ally herself grew up on the Grenfell Council Estate in London and knows first-hand what classism feels and looks like, having experienced it throughout her career. Self-funding and building from scratch is a massive task which takes guts, courage, setbacks and a tireless work ethic to create something that is meaningful within the industry. We all know there is a lot of ‘diversity PR’ around where people will host dinners and ‘talk’, but the Brixton Finishing School is where the real, raw, action happens. If anyone deserves an accolade, it’s Ally. She was even working at 7.30am on the morning of her birthday this year.\n\nTwitter: @BrixtonFSchool\n\nEconsultancy was founded 20 years ago on a simple but powerful idea – to nurture and connect a community of like-minded, digital pioneers. Bringing together fresh thinking, best practice and learnings from a wide range of digital thinkers and activators. Paul has stayed true to this original insight but reinvented it for his clients for the 2020s. Modern Marketers are drowning. Cognitive overload means that learning essential new skills is pushed to the end of an ever increasing to do list. Paul has introduced and deployed a new learning concept that helps teams be inspired and equipped whenever and wherever they want. Giving them access to curated, relevant resources that are easy to find, easy to consume and easy to apply. Delivering this success to large, complex, global organisations with multiple stakeholders has required Paul to deliver project management and client service of the very highest caliber. The highest proof being that 100% of clients have renewed the ‘learning as a service’ in year 2.\n\nTo deliver this success, Paul has led, coached, nurtured, cajoled and learned from a highly motivated and talented team of project managers, consultants, researchers, analysts and account managers across two global hubs in New York and London.\n\nTwitter:\n\nViv has almost 10 years of experience in advertising and talent management and has managed top influencers at Gleam futures in London including household names such as Zoella, Tanya Burr, Pixiwoo and the Saccone Jolys. She has managed multi faceted branded sponsorships with famous brands such as Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Nike, Waitrose, Amazon, Natwest and Real Techniques. As well as publishing awards winning books such as ‘faces’ by pixiwoo, the third best selling makeup book of all time. She has bought all of this experience back to the north west and is pioneering the benefits of this type of marketing across a much wider range of industries and companies. She is building a company that is out to prove that influencer marketing can be used in so many ways across so many different types of industries and across all sizes.\n\nTwitter: @beeinfluenceuk\n\nInsta:\n\n@beeinfluenceuk\n\nJonny Tooze is a successful entrepreneur and public speaker, actively helping to shape and influence the digital industry in the UK.\n\nJonny founded his first digital business and was pitching to VCs when he was eighteen.

LAB Group has offices in London, Kent, and Cape Town.\n\nJonny has been hooked on digital from the start of his career and has regularly won awards for his industry involvement, including BIMA 100 six years running and The Drum Digerati.\n\nHe is passionate about creativity, leadership, psychology and emerging technology.\n\nHe also runs an advisory service for agencies outside of LAB Group and is an active mentor in the digital community.\n\nGet in touch with Jonny on Linked In: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonnytooze/.\n\n2019 also saw LAB successfully establish a four-day working week for all staff, boosting creativity, productivity and happiness.\n\nBeyond his day job, Jonny has continued to use his digital powers for good, giving a talk on agency life to 250 students at George Abbot School.\n\nTwitter: @JonnyTooze\n\nA worthy winner because…\n\nElizabeth’s passion for creating change is very evident. When she approached me to tell me about her vision behind 1000 Black Voices and becoming a mentor her passion for it made me sign up in an instant. Many people talk about wanting a more equitable and inclusive world but few put the hard graft in to do it and she is one of the few.\n\nShe’s managed to pull together some of the best and brightest minds in digital including companies like Microsoft and Cyber-Duck to offer their knowledge and their skills to under-represented Black entrepreneurs in Europe & Africa who would previously not have those opportunities available to them. The opportunities and doors she’s opening and the inclusion-barriers she is breaking down are making a huge difference to everyone involved in the scheme.\n\nThe work Elizabeth is doing has a positive impact on a diverse community. She gains commitment to support her work with individuals extending their support to increase diversity in industry. More importantly, she is making a difference for every community she seeks to serve. I cannot be more proud of being able to support the work she does and nominate her for this award.\n\nGet to know Elizabeth:\n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/1000BlackVoices\n\nInsta: www.instagram.com/1000BlackVoices\n\nLinkedin: www.linkedin.com/company/1000-black-voices/\n\nWorthy winners because…\n\nAt a time of great uncertainty and anger, particularly among students, this initiative went completely against the grain. It gave children in the local area inspiration and excitement and a sense of pride at seeing their designs made into animations at a very bleak time in history. By bringing their drawings to life through social media it instilled faith in the future. The project was all run alongside study and often Jo and Izzy were putting in many hours to get the animations up for the children to see. The pair are hugely ambitious and intend to roll this out across more boroughs. They have also managed to flex and adapt in the different lockdowns. I am excited to see what they do next.\n\nGet to know Izzi & Josephine:\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephine-miller-a15351134/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/izdez___\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/josephinemiller\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/colouringin__\n\nA worthy winner because…\n\nAcross the engagements that Aman has delivered in the 9 months she has worked at This Place, Aman has brought a blend of robust insight and analytical rigour, problem solving and creative flair to shape solutions to business challenges that will not only solve the problems of today but endure in the years to come. Aman has been pushing boundaries both within our organisation and with our clients, challenging teams to enact change at pace to survive the pandemic. Aman led the definition and delivery of a net new proposition for This Place in light of COVID-19, enabling us to pivot how and what we sell and to test new methodologies and approaches for supporting our clients. Aman’s ability to use her experience working in digital strategy to enable other practice areas such as our creative, innovation and product teams has meant that her impact has been truly cross-organisational.\n\nOver and above her professional achievements, Aman has also managed to find the time to set up a virtual at-home cooking class business during the pandemic, demonstrating her business and entrepreneurial spirit both within and outside of her day-to-day work. Aman has even run a cooking class for the very lucky This Place team!\n\nGet to know Aman:\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-paul-76340687\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wearetnk/\n\nA worthy winner because…\n\nJilly’s grown her one-woman web-build company into a fully-fledged responsible digital solutions organisation with a diverse and talented team of over 25 talented team members. She’s leading the way on how to treat people in the gig economy which she feels is the future of work, and her commitment to her morals has forced her to turn down opportunities with large organisations when their morals don’t align with hers. She seeks new clients and projects that do good work, including mental health platform Togetherall, fundraising platform Collection Pot, human rights organisation EachOther, The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, and children’s charity Little Village.\n\nEveryone that works on a Team Bravand project knows exactly how things stand money-wise, gets paid well for the value that they bring and gets paid on time (early). Her commitment to do this has not just been because it’s a decent way to treat people, it makes for good work – because no talented person is going to do a good job if they’re worried about overdue invoices.\n\nAnd she’s also always fought to ensure that Bravand does it’s best to give back where it can.\n\nGet to know Jilly:\n\nTwitter: @bravandtweeting\n\nInsta: @bravandbeautiful\n\nLinkedin: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jillycross\n\nA worthy winner because…\n\nIf you require dynamism and versatility to win this category, then Nirup has that in spades. The projects he has covered could simply not have been delivered without an adaptive, learning mindset and commitment to ingenuity, not to mention the know-how to be able to take a digital product from strategy through to delivery.\n\nAside from that, Nirup’s overall commitment to quality is also unwavering and inspires a lot of our junior team. He holds himself and his team to the highest standard and will not sleep until that is achieved. He has been involved in every step of shaping the strategy team, using his smarts on new approaches that convert into tangible impact for our clients and their people. He lives and breathes Strategy, and brings depth of insight, decisiveness, humour and wit to each project he is on and the team.\n\nClients love him because of his considered style and the relationship he builds. He continuously demonstrates an ability to bridge the deeply analytical with the creative to solve genuine problems, whether that be educational disadvantage or business sustainability. His work stands testament to the way in which digital, and its ability to democratise access to information and guide users, can improve the lives and decision-making of people – whether that’s a marketer in a bank, a person on the shop floor or a headteacher in a school.\n\nGet to know Nirup:\n\nLinkedin: linkedin.com/in/nirup-chawhan-56bb1447\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/NirupChawhan\n\nRecognising you need to help people & make things happen enables Richard to deliver Xeim Econsultancy’s strategies for growth & the opportunities to foster awesome new talent in our industry.\n\nRichard is passionate about supporting talent in our industry and here are just 2 examples of how he has used his skills to mentor BIMA members:\n\nAK Connor, Senior Brand Manager. Audible: I was lucky to be matched with Richard as part of the BIMA mentoring program, and after our first meet I can confirm the internet, on this occasion, had it spot on – Richard is the real deal, a champion of women, diversity & progress. Not just in words, but in everyday action. There is no BS, no empty words, just clear, wonderful, action. As his mentee, I benefitted greatly from his advice, network & ongoing & steadfast support, which I’m very glad to say continues, unabatedly, to this day two years later. He is worthy of this category because he leads every day in his own company and still finds time to lead many others in other companies.\n\nSasha Suzdaleva. Marketing Manager, 93digital (and current BIMA mentee): It’s been a real pleasure being mentored by Richard, which has left me feeling motivated, inspired, a little wiser, and ready to achieve more. Richard has been generous with his time and countless gems of wisdom. He recommended me for the Marketing Week Mini MBA and got me a discount! It was a great experience & one I feel has already added huge value towards my personal growth, plus he helped me set up for a great appraisal that delivered everything I hoped for.\n\nGet to know Richard:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LondonRobinson\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/richardlondonrobinson/\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rprobinson/\n\nA worthy winner because:\n\nMatt has relentless energy and passion for helping companies all over the world and at all scales to navigate the modern web world. Everything from IoT to eComm and he has the practical experience (just have to see his desk full of gadgets he has built). He is never afraid to tackle something new and doesn’t stick to one sphere of influence – he still lectures at Reading University on IoT and AR, as well as teaches kids to code in his spare time. He can be found teaching the technology or even teaching people how to run the workshops.

It’s another opportunity for brands to figure out and it’s driving huge growth for our in-housing service.\n\nMy great idea is…\n\nMetaverse, AI and our future digital self. It’s coming. We need to figure out the NFT energy issue. That’s coming too.\n\nI got into digital because …\n\nIn the late 90’s my brother did a post grad in AI and went to work for Google. He helped me see the future.\n\nTaavi is Design and Innovation Lead at Potato, a digital product studio that combines design-thinking, lean start-up and agile software development to launch purposeful and effective digital products.\n\nHe’s worked with clients including Google, Visit Sweden and Cambridge Audio and most recently he led the design effort on our start-up venture Fictioneers. Prior to Potato, Taavi began his career as a visual designer at companies like Microsoft and most recently prior to his time at Potato, was the design lead at a peer-to-peer cooking startup, bringing it to market in the UK and Spain.\n\nMy great idea is that…\n\nBeing a generalist can be a specialism in its own right!\n\nI got into digital because…\n\nI was a nerdy kid who grew up in the middle"
