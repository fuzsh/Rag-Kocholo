The company said two-thirds of this demand would be met from fossil fuels – oil, gas and coal – and that this would lead to a 25% increase in carbon emissions. This growth is well above the path recommended by scientists to keep emissions below the ceiling of 450 parts per million that would provide a 50% chance of stabilising global temperatures at 2% above pre industrial levels. “The projections highlight the scale of the challenge facing policy makers at this year’s UN-led discussions in Paris. No single change or policy is likely to be sufficient on its own”, BP said. The company predicts that even with rapid growth in the use of renewable forms of energy, this will account for only 8% of energy demand by 2035.\n\nBP: No UK shale oil production for two decades BP predicts no significant production of shale oil or gas in the UK and Europe for at least 20 years, according to the report in the Independent. The company says the poor prospects for developing a global shale – or “tight oil” – industry also mean the current low price of oil is unlikely to last for more than a few years. It predicts the dramatic growth of US shale oil production will run out of steam and is unlikely to be replaced by new tight oil reserves outside the US.\n\nBooming US shale industry will run out of steam and surrender ground to Middle East production by the end of the decade, according to BP MailOnline reports on BP’s energy outlook report, forecasting that the US will have become self-sufficient in producing oil by 2030. The report adds that global demand for energy is likely to climb 37 per cent by 2035. Last year the predicted increase was 41%.BP expects Middle East production to ‘gain ground’ by the end of this decade and the Middle Eastern oil cartel OPEC will remain ‘a central force in the oil market for the next 20 years’.\n\nBP’s 2035 outlook sees OPEC gaining ground as US shale growth flattens BP predicts OPEC will regain ground and exceed its historic record production levels by 2030 as US shale oil growth flattens, Reuters reports. The news agency quotes BP chief economist Spencer Dale: “The story is that over time the oil market will grow out of its current weakness, reflecting the call that tight oil does not continue to grow so rapidly and demand will grow sufficiently to absorb it”.\n\nCuadrilla CEO says proceeding with shale gas development in UK Bloomberg reports Cuadrilla is proceeding with its shale gas development in northern England, even as environmental opposition grows and other regions impose temporary bans. “Where we are in Lancashire, we are still going forward,” Chief Executive Officer Francis Egan said on Bloomberg television. “We have all the permits from the environment agency now.” Commending on development of shale gas in the UK, he added: “We are pretty confident it will happen”.\n\nBill to police fracking protests runs into hundreds of thousands Chester First reports that protesters against fracking have said drilling companies should foot the £280,000 bill for policing anti-fracking demonstrations.

The information came in a FOI request by campaigner Matt Bryan, who is standing as a Labour candidate in Upton.\n\nUCG exclusion from Scottish fracking moratorium “bizarre” ENDS reports that underground coal gasification may still go ahead in Scotland because of a loophole in January’s moratorium on fracking. The Scottish parliament does not have powers over offshore activities, including UCG. Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, described this as “bizarre”, ENDS says. “As far as I’m concerned it’s incompatible with where we need to be with regards to carbon emissions in Scotland,” he said.\n\nFracking boosts humming birds The Belfast Telegraph reports noise of machinery at gas extraction sites in the US appears to benefit the nectar-loving birds, boosting their nesting capacity and the rate at which they pollinate flowers. Scientists believe the racket of compressors is driving away the hummingbirds’ natural predators, enabling them to raise their chicks in peace despite the din.\n\nThe Hydraulic Fracking Blog reports that Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that a local municipality cannot enforce its own permitting scheme in addition to the state-wide scheme. The case arose after Beck Energy Corporation (Beck) obtained a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) in 2011 to drill an oil and gas well within the city limits of Munroe Falls, Ohio. Munroe Falls then obtained a permanent injunction from a trial court blocking the drilling until Beck complied with five local ordinances.\n\n16th February 2015\n\nFracking definition in Infrastructure Act alarms campaigners Our report\n\nOverturning National Park fracking ban a “sensible change” The industry group, the Onshore Energy Services Group tells Shale Energy Insider the decision by MPs to overturn the proposed fracking ban in National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty to allow drilling “under but not in” the protected areas is a “sensible change. The group stated that any blanket ban on fracking for National Parks or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty would be a “fundamentally flawed concept”.\n\nSpecial meeting on impact of fracking The Lancashire Evening Post reports on plans by Woodplumpton Parish Council to hold a separate meeting to discuss shale gas exploration company Cuadrilla’s plans to drive HGVs through the village. .The council is waiting for details of the company’s revised traffic management plan and will announce the date of the meeting on its website.

Gary Haywood, the executive leading the company’s fracking plans, told a conference last week that Scotland’s biggest manufacturing plant, also one of the country’s biggest employers, could only rely on cheap supplies of US-sourced ethane gas for up to 15 years. After that, gas from local fracking projects would be needed. But in a message to employees John McNally, chief executive of Ineos’s UK petrochemicals arm, told Grangemouth employees some of Haywood’s comments “had been taken out of context” and that the site believed it had secure supplies until 2031 at the earliest.\n\nFiery train crash forces W Virginia towns to evacuated Two towns in West Virginia were evacuated after a freight train carrying crude oil derailed and burst into flames, the BBC reports.

A new six-person expert panel would also be empowered to allow fracks at shallower levels. Shale gas industry groups welcomed the proposal for its potential to crack open the German shale gas market, but it has sparked outrage among environmentalists who view it as the thin edge of a fossil fuel wedge, the Guardian says.\n\nThe New Forest Authority has raised the alarm over fears fracking may be allowed in national parks The Bournemouth Echo reports on a comment by the New Forest National Park Authority that it would be “concerned if the [Infrastructure] Bill was enacted as it currently stood”. A spokeswoman said “That could still leave open development happening under the park, but we would want to know what the regulations governing the process would be.” A DECC spokesman said: ““There’s a bit of uncertainty. We will provide further clarity in secondary legislation, by the end of July.” At least eight licences for possible fracking have already been issued to gas companies in south Hampshire.\n\nSean Lennon approves Bez bed-in protest against “evil” frackers The Salford Star reports approval by Sean Lennon of Bez’s Bed In anti-fracking protest which is re-creating John and Yoko’s famous bed in for peace in 1969.

It says the trend in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US shows the shale oil industry is in severe crisis. The paper says the rig count has been falling since a peak in early October (1,609) but the past two weeks have seen acceleration in the trend, with a falloff 94 in the week ending 30th January and 83 in the week ending 6th February.\n\nWhat impact will cheap gas have on UK climate policy The Carbon Brief reports that rising fuel prices are part of the reason why UK homes have used less energy over the past decade. Falling prices might slow or reserve that trend, it says. The Committee on Climate Change says energy efficiency is underfunded and consumers would save £95 of the average annual bill in 2020 if efficiency was properly supported. Spending on energy efficiency has been cut and the number of homes fitted with energy efficiency measures fell 80% between 2011/12 and 2014/15. If gas remains cheap, supporting renewables will be more expensive because the guaranteed strike price for renewable energy depends on future wholesale electricity prices.\n\nResidents and councillors attend public meeting in Malton to debate fracking The Gazette Herald reports on a sell-out event at Malton’s Milton Rooms.

She said shale gas extraction had to be done “extremely safely” and, the Chronicle reports, stopped short of saying where in the north east would be suitable for fracking. She said: ““I think fracking is a positive thing to have in the UK, as long as we can do it extremely safely and reassure communities that that’s the case, and I think we can. I think it is also something that young people can get into, both in terms of developing the technology and in the wider area of supporting renewables.”\n\nFracking no place in balanced energy policy Tommy Sheppard, SNP candidate for Edinburgh East, writing in the Edinburgh Evening News welcomes the Scottish Government’s halt to fracking planning permissions while an investigation is carried out. He says fracking is not the answer to energy needs because it is a finite fossil fuel that involves burning carbon to create carbon dioxide.\n\nNo fracking will lead to sky high prices The Scotsman reports on a presentation by Professor Gordon Hughes, a former world bank advisor, who says Scotland be sleepwalking into key decisions over its energy future without a “genuine debate about reality rather than phantasms”. He told a conference in Edinburgh “If Scotland decides it wants to be cold and green, fine that’s a choice it can reasonably make.

The company has applied for planning permission for a site halfway between Ballintoy Harborough and Dark Hedges. An environmental impact assessment maintains there will no significant impacts to the landscape, ecology, water quality, public health or noise levels. 43 homes are within half a mile of the proposed site, the paper says.\n\nIEA says scope of US shale oil output fall will be limited The FT reports forecasts from the International Energy Agency of a swift pullback in US shale oil production although output decline will be “limited in scope”. The supply build up could “grind to a halt” as early as July. The price correction will lead to a pause in the North American supply party but not bring it to an end.

Annual consumption in 2013 was down more than 9% on the 2006 peak, reflecting economic troubles of the Eurozone as well as cuts in energy use and improved efficiency. Despite this, Europe remains dependent on fuel imports, with more than half energy supplied for production abroad. 46.4% of UK primary energy comes from overseas.\n\nBritain’s fracking fight is a test of our democracy Human rights campaigner, Andrew Wander, writing in the Huffington Post says the government’s proposals on fracking in the Infrastructure Bill would not have been approved in stand-alone legislation. The bill was deliberately designed, he said, to be too big to fail. He asks: “Are our leaders serving the interests of the people, or their wealthy friends in the fracking industry? Whatever the answer, one thing is clear: the government’s wilful disregard of legitimate public concerns over fracking is a shameful attempt to impose a future on this country that three-quarters of us do not want”.\n\nTwo thirds of residents near Doncaster oppose fracking The Star reports findings by Misson Community Action says 71.8% of households who took part in a household survey in villages on the Doncaster-Nottingham border oppose fracking. 19% of those surveyed said they were still undecided and 5% said they were in favour.

Don’t give up on fracking Matt Ridley, a supporter of shale gas extraction, writes in the Times it would be a big mistake to forget about shale. “Gas really is rather special”, he writes. “It provides us in this country with 84% of our domestic heat, 27% of our electricity, much of the feedstock for our synthetic consumer products, and pretty well of the nitrogen fertiliser that has fed the world and largely banished famine. All this from a surprisingly small number of surprisingly small holes in the ground and the seabed.”\n\nNFU fracking issue Lisa-Marie Nelson, of NFU Mutual writes to the Southern Daily Echo to explain why the company has clarified its insurance cover for fracking. She said as oil and gas production is not a farming activity, the company has included wording on our farm business policy to tell policyholders that their farm environmental liability insurance would not cover damage to other people’s property which they had caused by fracking or other oil and gas exploration or production.\n\nBez bed-in week long anti-fracking protest The Salford Star reports that Salford Reality Party candidate Mark ‘Bez’ Berry begins his bed-in protest at 9pm tonight at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City Hotel.

Organisers of the Time to Act march on March 7th have been told police will no longer facilitate the temporary closure of roads along the agreed route.\n\nFracking company defies Wales’s shale gas moratorium The Ecologist reports that IGas insist the Welsh Government is powerless to stop them test drilling near Wrexham, despite the assembly passing a motion calling for a fracking moratorium. IGas said “The decision by the Welsh Government was not a moratorium. They can refuse applications on planning grounds, but they have no power to stop fracking.”\n\nFears for US economy as shale industry goes into hibernation The Guardian reports that America’s fracking revolution is becoming a victim of its own success. The boom drove US economic recovering and helped lower world crude prices. But a price plunge from £115 a barrel last June to just over $50 last week means many shale operations no longer pay.\n\nLibDem MP under fire over fracking vote The Milngavie Herald reports criticism of Jo Swinson MP for not voting for a moratorium on fracking in the UK.

Claims, therefore, that fracking can help prevent climate change are clearly false”, he said.\n\nResidents urged to ignore fracking “scaremongering” Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg tells the Somerset Guardian people in north east Somerset should look to the “positive economic consequences” when considering shale gas exploration. He dismissed concerns voiced by opponents and said the possibility of fracking ‘was very exciting but extremely important it is done in a safe way’ and said it would now go ahead irrespective of who wins the general election.\n\nConcerns about fracking The Somerset Guardian also reported on the first public meeting of Frack Free Somer Valley, which packed Midsomer North Town Hall. When asked their biggest concerns, members of the audience said they were worried about the use of fresh water on an industrial scale, water contamination and disposal, traffic, air pollution, fracking waste, leaking wells, radioactive contamination, methane migration, earthquakes and the impact on property values.\n\nStrong risk of regulatory delays to the UK shale gas sector Oil and Gas Insight reports that the Environment Agency’s permits for Cuadrilla’s proposed fracking operations marked a milestone in shale gas exploration in the UK.

She says fracking is a political hot potato and the expense of having to pay off a community has so far proven too much of an expense. But as reliance on gas continues and the supply burns away, it may become a more lucrative proposition – but not necessarily the right one. “It looks like we’re like sacrificing the North to fuel the South and that just does not sit well with me.”\n\nProspects for fracking in Britain are “bleak” as the industry loses ground Geoffrey Lean, in the Telegraph, says fracking has recently lost an “awful lot of ground – literally as well as figuratively”. He says some experts believe its prospects are now bleak, following a moratorium in Scotland and moves towards one in Wales. The picture in England does not provide much comfort, with Labour’s 13 conditions accepted by the government during the debate on the Infrastructure Bill. The effect on the industry – and, even more, on investors – is likely to be serious. “The industry will now be thinking long and hard about its plans,” said Philip Mace, an oil and gas specialist and partner in the law firm Clyde & Co, in the Guardian. “Investors loathe this sort of uncertainty, so the prospects for shale oil, and gas in the UK look bleak for the short and medium term.”\n\nHolyrood’s fracking indecision Former Labour MP, Brian Wilson, in the Scotsman, says ministerial mishandling of fracking is short-changing Scotland’s economic future. He asks if shale gas can be achieved with stringent safeguards “why would we not explore such potential? A moratorium only delays an answer to that basic question.”\n\nEU plans to increase energy security The Guardian reports on a discussion paper on a European Energy Union, which proposes closer co-operation among member states on energy production, distribution and consumption. Plans outlined include more liquefied gas terminals would be built in northern Europe and gas pipelines across the Mediterranean, to improve security of supply.

Investigation findings\n\nWorld’s largest sovereign wealth fund divests from coal Norway’s Government Pension Fund Glob, worth £556bn, reveals it divested from 39 companies in 2014 on environmental and social grounds, 22 because of high carbon emissions. A spokeswoman told ENDS: “As part of our focus on climate change, we have looked at emissions of greenhouse gases from companies in the portfolio. Companies that rely on value chains with particularly high greenhouse gas emissions may be exposed to risk from regulatory or other changes leading to a fall in demand.”\n\nTighter fracking rules not needed, says EA chair Sir Philip Dilley, giving evidence to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee, said “risks of fracking are relatively easily mitigated or avoided by doing things competently”, Utility Week reports.

Details here\n\nPlans to test drill at Wrexham for underground gas will go ahead, IGas bosses insist The Daily Post reports that IGas plans to go ahead with plans to drill on farmland at Borras, despite a Welsh Assembly motion for a moratorium on fracking. An IGas spokesman said: “Nothing has changed in our plans to test drill for underground gas in Wrexham, which we will be continuing with. And if we were to put in a planning application in the future, which is rejected by Wrexham council, the appeal would go to the Welsh Secretary, which comes under Westminster, not the Welsh Government.”\n\nFracking’s methane risk cannot be ignored Jane Burston, head of centre for carbon measurement at NPL writes in The Engineer about her evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee investigation on fracking risks. She says the baseline status of the environment is critical. Measuring background levels of methane in the atmosphere around a site would allow regulators to compare measurements taken during and after fracking with those taken before.\n\nI definitely oppose fracking – just look at my record Theo Simon, Green Party parliamentary candidate for Somerton and Frome, tells the Frome Standard if elected he would press for a vote in parliament to half fracking and withdraw existing licences. He says shale gas extraction would potentially have a “disastrous impact on the Mendip Hills and Somerset’s water table. It would mean rapid industrialisation of our countryside for short-term profit, disrupting tourism and rural life with drill rigs, gas flaring and truck convoys carrying contaminated water down the lanes”.\n\nFracking freeze welcomed Scottish Farmer reports a welcome for the Scottish moratorium from the country’s Tenant Farmers Association (STFA). The organisation has backed residents of Canonbie opposing unconventional gas extraction. Over the past few years, Scottish Farmer reports, many many farms and houses in that region have been cleared of tenants – moves widely interpreted as making way for local landowners to sell lucrative rights to shale gas extractors.\n\nHow did your MP voted in fracking suspension? The Dewsbury Reporter says north Kirklees MPs were divided on a parliamentary vote to suspend shale gas that was rejected by the House of Commons. Batley and Spen MP Mike Wood (Lab) voted in favour of a moratorium, but Dewsbury MP Simon Reevell (Con) voted against.\n\nWe cannot afford not to get fracking Irvine Inglis, of Reston Berwickshire, writing in the Scotsman, likens opponents of fracking to those who believe in Santa Clause and the Tooth Fairy. He says: “the hard fact is that we cannot afford not to get fracking and the sooner our spineless politicians face up to that blindingly obvious fact the better it will be for both Scotland and Britain”.\n\nGroup’s first meeting in fracking battle The Somerset Guardian reports that Midsomer Norton Town Hall was packed for the first public meeting of Frack Free Somer Valley. The meeting was told UK Methane holds the local licence, which was renewed for a further 12 months in July, and gives the company just a couple of months to apply to start drilling. The paper says many people living in the area believe this will lead to hundreds of wells being drilled in the area once known as the Somerset Coalfield.\n\n4th February 2015\n\nHorse Hill shale is world class and overturns current thinking on drilling in the Weald, investors told.

The party is accusing the force of “political policing”. A document labelled “Meeting Summary” states: “Ch Insp [name redacted] requested that CI [name redacted] and DI [name redacted] register to attend the university debate.” It says there will be “some high profile figures present, one being Mr Ian Driver, the Green Party Councillor for Thanet. Links have been made with local security”. Cllr Driver said: “It’s deplorable. This was a public debate. It was not a meeting planning any actions, protests or demonstrations. It was simply a public discussion about a controversial issue.”\n\nTraffic fears raised over new HGV route The Garstang Courier reports on ears that local roads around Woodplumpton in the Fylde district of Lancashire could become major fracking routes.

Mr Wheelhouse said: “Today’s announcement of a planning moratorium on subsequent applications for commercial scale unconventional gas activity in Scotland will be very much welcomed by communities across the country who have been alarmed by the gung-ho stance taken by the Tory-led Westminster Government”.\n\nAnthony Hilton: Fracking just doesn’t pay, so why bother? Anthony Hilton, writing in the London Evening Standard says for a large number of people fracking has been an extremely good way to lose a great deal of money. He says that explains why large oil companies, having tried it, are now “heading rapidly in the opposite direction”.
