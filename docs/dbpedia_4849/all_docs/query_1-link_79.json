        "text": "Founder and Lead Creative\n\nOwen Garitty\n\nOwen Garitty founded FPW Media in 2013 for a reason–to dismantle the extrinsic nature of a traditional marketing agency and forge a path for an innovative, fresh, and transformative creative vision. Today, that vision remains with FPW’s three connective divisions: brand, films, and merchandise, which design and implement client services entirely in-house, effectively cutting out the potential for misinterpretation of any client’s message or goals. FPW was founded as an “unagency”–a concept pioneered by Garitty that prioritizes a client-first outlook, meaning clients’ visions come to life organically through unconventional but efficacious processes.\n\nGaritty has had an aptitude for photography since the age of ten when he got his first camera–a Pentax 35mm–and has since amassed over 15 years of photographic experience. He won his first photography award at thirteen, began working professionally at fifteen, and went on to pursue a career in visual storytelling that grew to encompass design, marketing, and creative direction. In a lifelong pursuit of creating compelling visual narratives, Garitty’s passion lies in garnering brand recognition for his clients with impactful visuals and stimulating design. His profound understanding of the millennial zeitgeist makes him an invaluable asset in a new media landscape.\n\nToday, Garitty oversees brand vision and implementation for privately and publicly traded companies. He cultivates ongoing partnerships with a host of companies, ranging in specialty from large-scale manufacturers to apparel, agriculture, and heavy industrial equipment. He remains present and hands-on: clients have his personal cell phone number and can trust that Garitty is carefully guiding the creative direction of their project.\n\nIn 2018, Garitty directed the award-winning and critically acclaimed film, Lionhearted, which elevates veterans’ combat stories. The film focuses on the post-war lives of veterans, emphasizing the need for a sustained platform through which they can relay their experiences. The film’s moving visuals, made up of interviews juxtaposed with combat footage, highlight the profound and moving realities of many of our nation’s heroes.\n\nGaritty’s passion for vivid visual storytelling continues to emanate from the page, screen, or billboard–venturing beyond the ordinary and garnering clients the recognition they want by involving viewers in the narrative. As someone who values place and community, Garitty ensures that FPW is regularly involved in projects with local organizations such as nonprofits, government agencies, and educational institutions. When he isn’t at the office, Garitty can be found boxing, enjoying craft coffee, or gardening organic fruits and vegetables.\n\nVP of Creative Services\n\nAdam Plantenberg\n\nAdam was born and raised in Springfield, Oregon. From a very young age Adam loved interacting with people on a personal level. It was this love for people that led him to work for Dutch Bros. coffee where he quickly advanced through the company, and by the age of 20 he was running his own Dutch Bros. store. When Adam wasn’t loving on people he was being drawn to the world of technology. He instantly fell in love with cinema, and has continued his love for it to this day where he is now a Production Manager at FPW Media. He brings with him experience in the field operating and rigging cameras, setting up lighting, and taking photographs. His unique vision for the world around him brings a new perspective to the projects he works on. In his spare time Adam enjoys getting together with friends for a barbeque, sitting back to watch the game or a great film, and going to the gym.\n\nVP of Administration & Finances\n\nJessica Kirby\n\nJessica puts her skills in organization and problem solving to use every day as the Chief of Staff at FPW. Jessica grew up in Montana and spent her weekends helping on her family’s cattle ranch where they bred and raised thoroughbred racehorses and over 200 head of Certified Black Angus cattle. She earned her Bachelor of Science in business administration marketing and a minor in communications from the University of Montana in 2014. She traveled to Oregon the following year to take an internship at the University of Oregon Athletic Department’s ticket office. This experience served her well in the following five years spent as the Director of Operations for the UO women’s volleyball, lacrosse, and softball teams. Jessica managed daily operations for all three teams, including travel, budget strategy, collaboration across the department, and more. She now gets to feed her love of sports as a spectator while also enjoying traveling, checking out local wineries, and taking on an occasional DIY project!\n\nCreative Director\n\nBrian Campbell\n\nFor Brian, being an art director and photographer is more than what he does. Art is part of his DNA.\n\nWhether creating as a senior member of a marketing team or working directly with clients on individual projects, Brian thrives on producing highly successful marketing and communications campaigns that include core messaging, integrated fundraising, and thoughtful creativity. It has been his pleasure to be an active part of the creative and strategic planning and production of digital and printed magazines, newsletters, blogs, and other publications such as the annual reports, holiday gift-giving catalogs, donor stewardship pieces, and captivating art installations.\n\nAs a citizen of the world, he has been on numerous assignments in over 15 countries as an award-winning lead photographer, traveling everywhere from Northern Ireland to Madagascar. He has shot inspiring video stories from the dumps of Mongolia to the sweaty jungles of Sri Lanka and written compelling stories for clients from Ethiopia to Eugene.\n\nBrian is well versed in producing everything from t-shirt art to company identity, family, wedding, individual, and product photography, as well as video productions, complete interior design, and art installations. From putting a pencil on paper to color separating art on the computer and capturing a moment on film, Brian has a plethora of tools that allow him to hammer out the designs in his head.\n\nWhen not circumnavigating the globe on assignment, Brian enjoys working with his hands in the yard, in the woodshop, and with his family’s various projects. A bit of a foodie with an international palette, he obsesses over the flavors, spices, and the pairing of food with beverages while making embarrassing noises of appreciation in front of dear friends.\n\nCheers!\n\nAdministrative Manager\n\nLizbeth Ball\n\nBefore moving to Eugene, Oregon for school, Lizbeth lived in the small, rural town of Glendale, Oregon. Though small, this town offered her the opportunity to grow as a storyteller. From working at her mom’s food truck to participating in sports and extracurricular activities (such as softball and 4-H), she learned she could find an interesting story wherever she went. Attending the University of Oregon on an academic scholarship, her love for storytelling turned into an academic endeavor. As an advertising and journalism student, she was able to learn from talented professors and explore the various realms of media. At FPW Media, she continues to learn more about the art of storytelling and the mediums used to tell a visual story. In her spare time, she enjoys watching just about any movie with her twin sister, exploring the outdoors, painting, dining, and writing.\n\nOutside Sales\n\nDan Clark\n\nDan moved with his family to the Eugene area in 1974 and has been here ever since. Dan has been married for 35 years and has two daughters that are both very successful in their own careers. Starting his work experience at the age of eleven, Dan quickly learned the value of hard work. Dan and his family owned a Ski Shop in Eugene for over 20 years. This is where he learned the importance of customer service, employee loyalty, and the highs and lows of running your own business. After selling the business, Dan became the Director of Operations at one of the largest tennis facilities on the West Coast. There, he got to experience how to work for a member-owned club, as well as how to work with a board of directors. For the past 20 years, Dan has been in the team athletic, corporate merchandise, and promotional product industries. His experience shows in how he deals with his clients and the care, detail and respect he takes in working with them. Dan enjoys staying active and being outside playing golf, snow skiing, waterskiing, wake surfing, running, and working out.\n\nPrint Production Lead\n\nJon Danner\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Jon has always been passionate about technology and the arts. After graduating high school, Jon joined the United States Marine Corps and served for five years as a Ground Radio Repair Technician, including one tour of duty in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Upon leaving the military, he continued with his love of electronics and became a HP/Dell/Toshiba certified computer repair technician, providing comprehensive repairs for a wide range of consumer computer systems. At the age of 30, he took a extended hiatus from corporate employment to hike the Appalachian Trail twice and to hitchhike across the country multiple times, hoping to experience some of the freedom outlined in the classic works of American literature by Steinbeck and Kerouac.\n\nIn 2014, he settled in Eugene, OR and earned a degree in Graphic Design from Lane Community College, merging his love for technology and art. Aided by his passion for detail-oriented and logic-driven design, he has since been working in the capacity of design production across a variety of applications, including laser cutting of metals with tight tolerance machined parts to more artistic acrylic design features, as well as architectural signage. He is now applying his skills to the print production arena, producing high quality graphics and printed materials for our clients.\n\nJon spends most of his off-time at home now, enjoying the company of his wife, Becky and his new son, Tristan, who was born in late February 2021. While he is always fully engaged in the ever challenging world of being a new father, he still finds time to romp and play with his two dogs, Shaman and Mars, as well as continuing to enjoy all the wonderful outdoor adventures the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Other hobbies include video games and reading epic sci-fi and fantasy novels. He has probably seen the Lord of the Rings series 100 times and looks forward to a good second breakfast whenever he can get it.\n\nOutside Sales\n\nDylan Kattengell\n\nDylan Kattengell is a sales professional who has seamlessly blended his passion for sports, education, and business throughout his career. Originally from the Bay Area with a background in the wine industry, Dylan moved to Oregon for school and has set down roots. Formerly associated with Richardson Sports, Dylan has recently embarked on a new journey here with FPW Media, where he is dedicated to empowering brands through innovative marketing strategies and goods. A graduate of the University of Oregon, Dylan’s academic foundation coupled with his keen interest in sports and wine business reflects his commitment to holistic development. An avid golfer and enthusiastic runner, Dylan not only values personal fitness but also channels his energy into coaching youth sports, demonstrating his dedication to community engagement and mentorship. Dylan finds joy in the art of sales, excelling in closing deals that not only benefit his clients but also empower companies through the delivery of top-quality branded goods.\n\nScreen Print Lead\n\nBrandon McMullin\n\nBrandon grew up on a farm in Iowa and moved to Oregon in 2013. He has been screen printing since 2011. He started out at Adidas and worked at a handful of shops in Oregon. From big print shops to little, Brandon has been able to gather some great experience and knowledge. He always gets excited when he sees his work being worn. Whether it’s an NHL hockey team or a small town business, knowing he took part in making that shirt happen is pretty cool. Outside of work, Brandon loves spending time with his daughter.

By high school Austin’s family had finally settled in California’s beautiful central coast, where he was inspired to develop his cinematography skills. Academic video production assignments would often rapidly transform into passion projects, and crafting submissions for local film festivals became a common pastime. Dreams of attending film school at USC and his love of the art were ultimately placed on the backburner as he pursued more practical interests at Northern Arizona University. He eventually returned “home,” deciding to spend the next two years completing Arabic language prerequisites for graduate school and using the stunning coastline as a backdrop for a successful real estate marketing business. Seeking experience with state-of-the-art equipment and a diverse client portfolio, Austin happily settled down at FPW Media in Eugene. In his free time he enjoys smoking meat, hiking, mountain biking, paddle boarding, driving, and embracing all that the PNW lifestyle has to offer. Regardless of the next avenue Austin travels down, film will always remain one of his major passions.\n\nSourcing Specialist\n\nMonica Payne\n\nMonica, who also tends to go by Mon to most new faces, was raised in Puyallup, Washington and moved to Eugene, Oregon in October 2022 to pursue opportunities for emotional and mental growth.

During that trip, she fell in love with the state and all it has to offer, and she decided to call it home. Samantha worked as an Embroidery Machine Operator for five years before transitioning into the mental health field. She was inspired by her brother—who passed away during his time serving in the military—to give back as he did, helping those who are unable to help themselves. This led her to work as a Medication Technician Supervisor for the next five years. Later, Samantha felt drawn to return to the creative industry, joining FPW Media to further her education and experience in embroidery. In her free time, she enjoys gardening outdoors, watching documentaries, and painting. Out of all her achievements, she considers her son to be the greatest.\n\nAccount Manager\n\nLogan Zozaya\n\nLogan is a proud Oregonian who was born and raised in Grants Pass, OR.
