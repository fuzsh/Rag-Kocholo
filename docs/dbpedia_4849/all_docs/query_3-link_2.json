Beki worked as a journalist for print, before later moving into television and presented the British Broadcasting Corporation show Top Gear during the 1980s. Print Beki has published several books related to motoring, including ‘Star Cars’, ‘Cobra’ and ‘Ferrari V8’.\n\nCannabis Beki spent time investigating the prohibition of cannabis during the 1990s, resulting in her opening a cannabis cafe in Brighton in 1993.\n\nThe cafe was shut down by police after 57 minutes. Fracking Beki’s independent research and opposition of fracking led her to become a contributor of evidence during the Infrastructure Bill committee debates in 2015.\n\nBeki campaigned against the Infrastructure Bill in 2015 and suggested that it was the “arguably the most irresponsible piece of legislation ever to be laid before a British Parliament”. Electronic Cars Beki advocates electric car use, \"The more people buy electric cars, the more the price will come down.\n\nWe need a 21st century vision.\" Spiritual During her seventeen years of ordination, she spent three years in the United States in silent retreat and taught meditation in Mid Sussex.\n\nBeki featured in a short documentary about her life as a nun titled ‘Unusual Choices’ filmed in 2009. Beki was a candidate in the 2015 British General Election for the Mid Sussex constituency. She has never voted in an election.\n\nDuring campaigning, Beki spoke of her desire to launch a local bank providing small loans to local traders and small businesses, with her aim in office to bring economic controls back to “support and protect people and place”."
