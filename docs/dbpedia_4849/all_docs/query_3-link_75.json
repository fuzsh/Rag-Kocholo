        "text": "This guy broke into our London office (twice). And today, I'd like to send him a thank you. This is a picture from our nest, catching him on camera after helping himself to our beer fridge, all of our computers (for a second time), camera kit, an old super 8 camera with huge sentimental value and a random jacket (oh, and bank statements which he later used to steal my identity) I came across this picture while looking for something on my drive today, it's the moment before he stole the damn nest camera! At the time, our covent garden office was a big investment for the business. As a sole founder, I felt we'd made it the first time I walked into that office. We had an awesome team, awesome clients and finally, an awesome office to make the magic happen in. The first time he broke in was really tough. The second time (2 weeks later) almost broke me. And the business. The financial and mental stress was quite overwhelming. It was the first time the team saw me shed a tear (or two). But coming across this picture again today made me realise how far I, and the business, have come. As a founder, and leader, this man taught me about resilience and empathy as a leader...and that has strengthened not only my relationship with the whole team, especially our MD of the London office at the time Beki Gard, but also our incredibly supportive clients. (It also proved how unbreakable Google Workspace is) So today, my cigarette smoking beer stealing laptop grabbing Steve Wheen impersonator at HSBC, thief...I thank you. #resilience #leadership"
