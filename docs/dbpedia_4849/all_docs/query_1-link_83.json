        "text": "Kristin’s latest solo album, entitled Stringworks, on Mountain Home Records, was released in July of 2016. It debuted in the top-ten on Billboard’s Bluegrass album chart and the self-penned opening track, Great Waterton, was nominated for IBMA’s Instrumental Recorded Performance of the Year. The record is a mixture of styles, reflecting her tastes, and features original and traditional instrumentals, as well as vocal songs, all showcasing her banjo playing.\n\nKristin has been featured on The Grascals’ albums since 2008, including the latest release, Before Breakfast, which topped The Bluegrass Unlimited Album Chart, holding the #1 slot for 8 consecutive months. As part of the Grascals, Kristin’s media performances include The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Fox & Friends, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and CBS’ The Talk, among others. The band has also performed for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as accumulating nearly 200 performances on The Grand Ole Opry.\n\nKristin plays a 1930 Gibson TB-3 banjo. After 13 years in Nashville, Kristin relocated back near her original home in the Carolinas, where she lives with her husband and son.\n\nTheir first album, Shaking Down the Acorns (2012) gained attention worldwide and led them to open for Steve Martin at the Toronto Jazz festival in 2013. The band’s second album, Queen City Jubilee (2019) garnered a Juno Nomination, and for their latest release, Up the Hill and Through the Fog (2023) won the Ensemble of the Year award at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.\n\nIn 2020, Evans moved to Nashville, TN and within a few months was invited to perform at the Ryman Auditorium with the Old Crow Medicine Show. Since moving to Nashville, Evans has been in demand as a session player, performer and in March of 2023 was invited to be a member of the International Bluegrass Music Association Leadership Program at the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nEvans has recorded several critically acclaimed albums over the course of his career, each showcasing his incredible musicianship and unique approach to the banjo. His most notable projects include the duo album with fiddler Ben Plotnick, Madison Archives (2022), which won the CFMA Traditional Album of the Year Award, as well as earning a Juno Nomination. He is featured on two albums with Natalie McMaster, Sketches (2019), and her most recent album with Donnell Leahy, Canvas (2023).\n\nEvans tours the US, Canada and Europe, and has played on some of the most prestigious stages including Rockygrass, Merlefest, and Jacob’s Ladder Folk Festival in Israel. His exceptional ability as a teacher has resulted in invitations to teach at some of the most acclaimed camps including The Nashville Acoustic Camp, RockyGrass Academy, and Midwest Banjo Camp.\n\nFrank has become known for his distinctive style which blends traditional folk music with contemporary influences, creating a sound that is uniquely his own.\n\nHis striking vocal stylings distinguish him as an original and captivating performer, both live and in recordings. Whether he is performing on stage or in the studio, Frank Evans is a true master of the banjo and a musical icon in his own right. His contributions to the world of folk music and beyond will undoubtedly continue to inspire and influence generations to come.\n\nBilly’s distinct sound has lead him to collaborations with Edgar Meyer and Mike Marshall in the Porous Borders of Music, alongside Jerry Douglas (and many ResoSummit instructors) on Tut Taylor’s Tribute album, Southern Filibuster, and with Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones.\n\nBilly’s unique stylings and expertise attracted innovative analog music mogul, Moog Music. During 2010, he helped design their first electric slide guitar which he debuted at MoogFest that same year.\n\nAmongst Billy’s own recording projects, his “Six String Swing” helped bring the Dobro into the world of Swing Jazz.\n\n“The swing music Billy Cardine is tackling on the resophonic guitar on this project is some of my all time favorite music, and in his hands, the music itself takes on an all new meaning to me. It all sounds so natural to the resophonic guitar that one is almost forgiven for not realizing that this is pretty much impossible to pull off so convincingly.” — Mike Auldridge\n\nHis newest release, Concrete Garden, features musicians from around the world and groupings of instruments maybe never heard before. And next years release, Old Crooked Mountain, poises the acoustic Dobro alongside drums, bass, horns, and more, in a Covid fueled exploration of new sounds.\n\nAs an engineer and producer, Billy’s distinctive voice shines through any instrument he plays, song that he composes, and album that he produces. His works have won national and international awards and recognition including Indie Acoustic Music Project’s Roots Album of the Year, Apple’s playlist of the year, and Chicago Tribune’s Best Bluegrass records of the year. His memorable compositions and emotive playing have been featured on Television productions such as The History Channel’s “Our Generation”, BBC World’s “Destination Music”, and PBS’ “RoadTrip Nation”.\n\nIn addition to his busy touring schedule with a variety of lineups, Billy has been teaching workshops throughout Europe, India, Canada and the USA, as well as taking part in cross cultural programs thru the US State Department.\n\nBilly ‘the farmer’ is in year six of building a permaculture food forest on his land outside of Asheville NC where he lives with his amazing wife Mary, 2 boys Bodie and Julian, and 2 of the best dogs ever.\n\nAfter graduating he joined the Seldom Scene with whom he received a Grammy nomination in 2007. In 2005 he founded the critically acclaimed bluegrass band The Infamous Stringdusters. At the 2007 International Bluegrass Music Association awards Eldridge and his Stringdusters bandmates won Emerging artist of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year for their debut album, Fork in the Road.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2005 he had caught the attention of mandolinist Chris Thile, who enlisted him, along with banjoist Noam Pikelny, violinist Gabe Witcher, bassist Greg Garrison (and later, bassist Paul Kowert) to start working on an ambitious side project. Soon after they decided to focus all of their collective energies into band and Punch Brothers was born. The band has since released 6 critically acclaimed albums, won a Grammy for Best Folk Album in 2018 and toured the world.\n\nEldridge also plays in a duo with guitarist Julian Lage. They have released 2 full length records and an EP. Their most recent, Mount Royal, was nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Chris Eldridge has worked with a diverse cast of musical luminaries including Paul Simon, Renée Fleming, John Paul Jones, Marcus Mumford, Justin Timberlake, T-Bone Burnett, Jon Brion, Fiona Apple, The War and Treaty, Jerry Douglas, I’m With Her, and Del McCoury.\n\nIn 2019, Eldridge was named Instrumentalist of the Year by the Americana Music Association.\n\nEldridge was the house guitarist on the public radio show, Live From Here (formerly known as A Prairie Home Companion), from 2016-2020. He is currently Visiting Associate Professor of Contemporary American Acoustic Music at Oberlin College.\n\nThe latest Grant Farm album, Broke In Two, released June 2019, is an ambitious concept album which furthers the stories of characters and archetypes introduced on the previous release, Kiss The Ground. Tyler was also host of the Meeting on the Mountain® LIVE Broadcast, a radio-style musical program based in Fort Collins, CO, from 2015-2018. The “Great Pause” of 2020 brought Tyler back to the outdoors, where he became involved as an entertainer and raft guide on RiverWonderGrass Expeditions through Adrift Adventures Dinosaur on the Green and Yampa Rivers in Dinosaur National Monument. Outdoor leadership has blended well with his musical endeavors, and River Life has permeated his music.\n\nIn addition to the National Flatpicking Championship at Winfield in 2008 and Merlefest Doc Watson Guitar Championship in 2009, Tyler has also won the Rockygrass, Wayne Henderson, and the New England Flatpicking Championships. He has been featured in Acoustic Guitar, Flatpicking Guitar, Fretboard Journal and Bluegrass Unlimited Magazine. Tyler has been an instructor at CalArts, Kaufman Kamp, Rockygrass Academy, Sore Fingers UK, Augusta Heritage Center Bluegrass Week, Grand Targhee Bluegrass Camp, Julian Family Fiddle Camp, Nimblefingers, and St. Louis Flatpick among others. Tyler’s Flatpicking Academy on ArtistWorks.com is his primary instructional site, and he is also a regular contributor to online guitar instruction sites Jamplay.com & Truefire.com.\n\nWhen he is indoors, Tyler hosts a Monday Night Playalong Bluegrass Jam for all levels on his Youtube channel.\n\nwww.tylergrant.com\n\nThe all-female Della Mae has performed in over 20 countries with the US Department of State’s cultural diplomacy program “American Music Abroad”. Woodsmith spoke about her experiences with travel and music at TEDx Piscataqua River in Portsmouth, NH in a talk called “A Soft Drink and a Song in the Hills of Pakistan”.\n\nIn 2016 Woodsmith took a hiatus from touring to write, listen, and reflect about her years on the road. During that time she bicycled 2,000 miles from Geneva, Switzerland to Vlorë, Albania. Post hiatus, she released her solo record “Cast Iron Shoes”. The all-original album combines raw, roots-rock with heart-searing songs like “Sicily” which paint a solemn picture of the global refugee crisis. When not on the road with Della Mae, Woodsmith performs with roots-rock band Say Darling and with them has released two albums of original music.\n\nShe currently lives in Kittery, ME with her husband and dog. Amidst touring full-time with Della Mae, she teaches songwriting, singing, stage craft and guitar.\n\nNear the end of his study at MIA, Marcus traveled to Los Angeles, CA to attend the National Association of Musical Merchants show with instructors from the Academy.\n\nWhile attending the show, Marcus requested of Santa Cruz Guitar Company production manager Daniel Roberts, to be accepted to come and do a 3 month apprenticeship. After being accepted and receiving a visa, Marcus came and studied with Dan, first for 3 months, then later, worked side by side with Dan at the SCGC repair and R&D facility for another two years.\n\nNext Marcus moved to Bozeman, MT and worked for Music Villa doing their repair and new instrument setups for a number of years. When finally opening his own shop in Bozeman, Marcus became the Martin warranty repairman for the area and continued to do repair for Music Villa as well as having developed a personal client list of discriminating top tier players. Marcus’ career as an instrument builder and repairman is only limited by his time spent playing in multiple bands in the Bozeman area.\n\nAfter some time at Gibson, Dan realized that his real interest was building custom guitars and so sometime around 1990 he accepted a position as production manager with the Santa Cruz Guitar Company. SCGC was small enough that Dan would be able to work building guitars, build the SCGC archtops, do some of the repair, and do design and tooling as well as his management duties so it was a perfect fit. Dan worked with owner Richard Hoover and SCGC for almost 18 years, working with the likes of Chris Hillman, Herb Pedersen, David Crosby, Janis Ian, Tony Rice, Norman Blake and many more before leaving in 2008, after 25 years in the industry, to start his own Company, Daniel Roberts Stringworks.\n\nSince starting his own company about 13 years ago,Dan had a constant flow of repair as well as new builds. Since 2009 Dan has built Guitars for Dave Stewart, Brian May, Waddy Wachtel, John Jorgenson, Eric Clapton, Ronnie Wood, Brent Mason, Don Everly, Joe Walsh, Stevie Nicks, David Frizzell, Sonny Curtis, Vince Gill, Amy Grant. He is currently building for TBone Burnett,Carlos Santana, Kevin Kastning, as well as countless other wonderful musicians. Dan loves to build instruments and has had many apprentices through the years. He really enjoys sharing his talents with the builders every year at Rockygrass!"
