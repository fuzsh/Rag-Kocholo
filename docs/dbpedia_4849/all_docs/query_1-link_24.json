        "text": "Maine is famous for its coastline, and this Beach Chillin’ trip will take you to some of the best beaches Maine has to offer! You will explore a total of three different beaches during your three-day trip. All of these spots have beautiful white sand, views, and salty water. Be prepared to soak up the sun rays and enjoy three days of playing beach games, swimming, and making new connections.\n\nEvacuation Access Level: 1\n\nFrontcountry\n\nActivity Level: Moderate\n\nAmenities: Running water, showers and flush toilets\n\nSleeping Arrangements: Camping in tents\n\nMeet the leaders!\n\nBeach Chillin 2\n\nHey everyone, I am so excited to welcome you all to Bates! My name is Julia (she/her) and I’m from New York City. Growing up in NYC, I knew I wanted something smaller and slower but still with all four seasons. Fall in Maine is my absolute favorite!!! I’m a senior Politics and Psychology double major. On campus I am a Restorative Practices Advisor, avid member of our student run theater group, The Robinson players, and a student carpenter in the woodshop. I also love to play games, read, paint, thrift, and spend time with friends. I am thrilled to meet all of you and lead this beachy AESOP with Sophia :)\n\nHI EVERYONE! My name is Sophia (she/her) and I’m from Skaneateles, NY. I am a senior Sociology major and Hispanic Studies minor here at the lovely Bates College. In my free time you can find me playing trumpet or messing around in the theater, which is where I met my co-leader Julia <3. I love spending time outside and meeting new friends so I am ECSTATIC to be able to lead an AESOP trip this year. I remember so clearly the nervous excitement I had coming into freshman year and I hope to help you all navigate that space, meet new people, get acclimated to Bates, and have some fun! Can’t wait to meet you all very soon :)\n\nBeach Chillin 3\n\nHey Bobcats, welcome to Bates!! I’m Rohini! I’m super excited to be a part of your AESOP experience and to enjoy the beaches of Maine with you all. I’m from Branchburg, NJ and can be found driving around Jersey listening to music or working at my favorite local vintage store in Flemington when at home. I’m working towards an Economics major and Music minor. At Bates, you will find me singing a cappella with the Merimanders, writing or editing for Snaggletooth Magazine, playing my guitar, buying a chai from The Ronj, or hanging out with my lovely friends. My first-year AESOP trip was awesome (Portland Exploration!) and I met one of my best friends on the trip! In my time at Bates so far, I have really grown to love this community and the beautiful state of Maine, and I can’t wait for you all to have similar experiences. AESOP is a truly wonderful start to your life at Bates – I’m so glad I get to be there for you through it!\n\nHey y’all! My name is Alex and I am beyond excited to be a part of your AESOP adventure. I loved my AESOP group as it spurred so many new opportunities and relationships. A little about myself, I am from White Bear Township in Minnesota and you can often catch me anywhere near the water, I love swimming, surfing, and almost anything that includes water. At Bates I am on the rowing team as well as part of an a capella group called the Manic Optimists. I am hoping to study neuroscience with a minor in spanish. Here on campus I enjoy spending my time drinking coffee, hanging out with friends, or studying in The Ronj as well as exploring the Lewiston-Auburn area. I feel incredibly honored to be a part of your journey as we show you around your new home here in Maine through AESOP.\n\nBeach Chillin 4\n\nHi everyone, welcome to Bates!!! I’m Noa and I’m from Hastings, New York (J.O.NYC one might say). I am so excited to lead Beach Chillin’ with my good friend and roommate Willow. I’m a rising sophomore, English and Econ double major, and a member of the women’s rowing team. I’m spending my summer lifeguarding at a day camp, and can’t wait to get back to school and meet you all! Here’s a little more about me: some of my favorite artists are Noah Kahan, Zach Bryan, and Lucy Dacus. I have two dogs, Wes and Fig, who are the joys are my life. In my spare time, you can find me spending time with friends, reading, and exploring the wonderful state of Maine! You can be sure that our trip will include lots of chilling in the sun, listening to good music, and being driven around in the 15 person van by yours truly (absolutely cannot wait)!\n\nHi everybody! My name is Willow and I’m from Shirley, Massachusetts (just outside the outside of Boston). I’m so excited to be leading Beach Chillin’ 4 with my dear friend and roommate, Noa! I’m a rising sophomore and planning to major in Sociology. Here’s a little bit more about me: I have two awesome cats named Bob (after Bob Dylan) and Joni (after Joni Mitchell). They are my pride and joy and the light of my life. If I am listening to music you can pretty much guarantee I’m listening to Gracie Abrams, Phoebe Bridgers, or of course Taylor Swift. I absolutely love the summer and swimming in the wonderful Atlantic Ocean! I’m so excited to meet all of the incoming first years.\n\nExplore Camden Hills State Park and its sweeping views of Penobscot Bay.

I’m Milo and I’m a rising sophomore. I’m from Brooklyn, New York. I’ve lived in NYC my whole life, but I have family in Maine. I’m an English major and I love listening to almost every kind of music and also making it. My other hobbies include biking, frisbee, film photography, and playing a lot of pickleball! At Bates I’m a DJ at the radio station (with Clem!!), editor for the literary magazine, and I play ultimate frisbee for OWHIP! I’m super excited for some camping, hiking and meeting you all. See you in August!\n\nHi!! My name’s Clem and I’m a rising sophomore! I’m from Brooklyn, New York, and I’m thinking of majoring in Environmental Studies or English.

I can’t wait to meet you all!\n\nCamden Basecamping 2\n\nMy name is Eleanor Lynch (she/her) and I’m a rising senior from Westchester, New York (though I now live in Massachusetts). As a neuroscience major and hispanic studies minor, I’ll gladly talk about anything brain or Spanish language related. In my free time I like to run while listening to reggaeton, climb the leaderboard in Duolingo, and table hop in Commons. I loved my AESOP largely because of my leaders and so I’m super excited to lead the wonderful trip we have lined up for you! Get excited.\n\nMy name is Eric Treyz. I prefer he/him pronouns and am from Amherst, Massachusetts. I am a captain on the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee team (Orange Whip) and also enjoy getting lost, stargazing, and watching Survivor.

I am very excited to get the opportunity to explore Camden’s mountains and ocean with you all!\n\nCamden Basecamping 3\n\nWhat’s up everybody!! I’m Grace Martin, a rising sophomore who is psyched to meet so many future Batesies. A little about me, I’m from Lyndonville, Vermont, the land of maple trees, and spend my summers in Cordova, Alaska, with folk music, salmon, and mountains. In my free time you can find me playing mandolin, skiing, writing songs, singing with the Bates Crosstones, or tossing a frisbee with my friends. I am beyond thrilled to explore Camden Hills with my fabulous co-leader Iris and start off the school year strong by getting to know new faces!\n\nHey! My name is Iris Petrin and I am so excited to co-lead Camden Basecamping 3 with the incredible Grace Martin! I am a rising sophomore from Leeds, Maine and my pronouns are she/her.

My name is Aleisha and I am a rising junior from Mexico City, Mexico. I am majoring in Biochemistry and Politics here at Bates and could not be more excited to welcome you to our lovely community. As someone who did not grow up close to many outdoor activities moving to Maine has provided me with the chance to hike, ski, and swim in some of the most beautiful places. With that, I am forever biased and think that AESOP is one of the best parts of the Bates experience: not only do you get to explore, but you also get to spend time with an amazing group of people that will grow alongside you and support you throughout the next four years. Hadley and I are bffs (she explicitly told me not to use this word) and roommates are committed to giving you the best AESOP ever!!! We cannot wait to meet you!!!! Safe travels and see you in Maine! P.S I am in the one in the dark grey hoodie in the snow pic and the striped shirt in the other picture :).\n\nHey y’all, I’m Hadley and I’m also a rising junior. I’m majoring in Earth and Climate Sciences (EACS) and Music. Since I’m from Buckfield Maine, I have had the privilege of growing up with the wilderness and nature at the tip of my fingers. Hiking, camping, and skiing were just things I thought everyone was doing. I didn’t think anything of it until I moved to college and rediscovered just how breathtaking and peaceful Maine can be. I also recognized the lucky situation that I had in my childhood. Some brief interests of mine include writing, anything outdoors, needle felting, playing piano, and photography. But as fun as these things are, something I hold dear to my heart is exploring the state with my friends and sharing with them the experiences they didn’t have before coming to Bates. Now, I can’t wait to share the magnificent state which you’ll now call home for the next four years. Excited to meet you!\n\nDay Hiking 2\n\nHi Y’all! My name is Hannah, and I am super hyped to be leading day hikes around the best state on the East Coast. I am a senior Biology major and Earth and Climate Sciences minor from New Hampshire, and I spent my childhood being bribed to hike with lots of Skittles. After developing a positive relationship with both nature and candy, I started to love all things mountains, oceans, and chocolate. At Bates, I am on the rowing team, and I cross train with my job as a Student Sweeper and my frequent walks to Dunkin. I am a lifeguard, but if you get injured, go to Ian – he is pre-med! I can’t wait to meet y’all soon and go on some wild adventures around both Maine and the Puddle.\n\nHey everyone!! My name is Ian and I’m going to be a Senior majoring in Biology and minoring in Chemistry. I’m from Seattle, so I bring a little west coast representation among all these east coasters. While there, I love to get out and hike the beautiful, majestic, awe-inspiring, and some might say, better mountains that we’ve got. You know, it’s just hard to find that same kind of magic all the way out here! Kidding… kind of. Obviously, I’m super excited to get out day hiking with y’all and explore some of the awesome hiking trails around the area! Like Hannah, I’m a member of the rowing team so we’ve gotten to know each other pretty well. I plan to eventually become a doctor, but I’ll never be able to compare to Hannah’s craaazy lifeguard skills so be sure to direct any first aid problems her way :). All jokes aside, we both can’t wait to meet everybody and introduce y’all to Bates!!\n\nGrafton Notch has so many spectacular views of Maine. This 20-mile backpacking trip will carry you through Grafton Notch State Park. Explore scenic views in this highest-level difficulty trip. Due to the remote nature of campsites, there will be no access throughout the trip to bathrooms and running water. However, those who hike this will experience a great outdoor bonding experience in some of the most beautiful parts of Maine.

Like Mitch, I’m also studying Earth and Climate Science at Bates, mostly for the crazy places you get to go to do research (my favorites have been Alaska and Greenland so far). I’m the commodore of the Bates sailing club and a trip leader with the outing club, and will be shamelessly plugging both during our trip. I’m currently studying abroad in Denmark which has been amazing and has given me the chance to travel to a whole bunch of places in Europe. I do miss Bates and Maine though. Excited to meet you all!\n\nWhat’s (ae)SOP everybody?? I’m Mitchel, a senior from Bedford, NH studying Earth and Climate Science. I absolutely love a good adventure, which is why I co-managed the Outing Club for a year and continue to be involved. I’ve enjoyed being a part of the sailing and club alpine skiing teams, and my favorite part about Bates is its cozy community. I’m currently studying abroad in Svalbard, an island between Norway and the north pole, so hopefully I’ll have time to defrost before our trip. I can’t wait to meet you all and welcome you to Bates! Go Grafton!!\n\nGrafton Backpacking 2\n\nWhat is up Class of 2028! My name is Ellie (she/her) and I am a senior double majoring in math and politics. I am from Colorado Springs, Colorado where I first developed my love for mountains and cannot wait to traipse through the Maine wilderness this fall with you. I am SO SO excited to be leading AESOP this year and can’t wait to get to know all of you. Here are some things I love that we can talk about on the trail. Making aesthetic yogurt bowls in commons, laying down fire beats on the recorder, Bates Cold Front (Women’s and Gender Non-Conforming Frisbee Team), the Ronj at early hours of the morning, running along the ‘scog, crocs, pikas, the first snow of the season, and my fearless co-leader and wonderful friend LIV MYERS. Happy summer and see you in the fall!\n\nHeyo, my name is Liv (she/her) and I am a senior biochemistry major with a minor in religious studies. I am from Stillwater, Minnesota and I am thrilled to meet you all and go backpacking. Some hobbies of mine include cross country skiing, biking, reading, listening to music, frisbee, making ice cream, and chilling with dogs. I cannot wait to show you all of the sunny spots on campus and my favorite common’s creations. Here’s to sweaty hiking, mountain views, and Nerd’s gummy clusters™ by day and hot cocoa/ tea, card games, and stargazing by night.\n\nWant to give back to the community whilst working on your home-building skills? If so, then this trip is for you! This will be a great opportunity to work on projects that will serve as a great service to the community of Rockland, Maine. Students will be working on projects in Rockland and/or St. George (subject to change). First years will be able to get out and explore Maine while offering great service to those in need and bonding with each other over different games! Students will have access to bathrooms and will be sleeping off campus near the worksite for this trip.\n\nEvacuation Access Level: 1\n\nFrontcountry\n\nActivity Level: Intermediate\n\nSleeping Arrangements: Inside a local church with sleeping bags\n\nMeet the leaders!\n\nWhat’s up class of 2028! It’s me, Adam Joseph, and I couldn’t be happier to welcome you to your new habitat(see what I did there), Bates! I am a Sociology major in the class of 2025 hailing from the great state of Connecticut, although as you’ll see from my hats and sweatshirts I like to think of myself as a New Yorker (the first 8 months of my life really affected my sports team allegiances). Haley and I are soooo excited to lead this trip as AESOP is what initially brought us together! Here on this wonderful campus I can be seen in many different locations, so I thought I’d use this as an opportunity to refresh your memory of some of Bates’ best spots(as a tour guide I feel obligated to do so). In the Olin Arts Center you can find me singing with the Manic Optimists, my jaw-dropping a cappella group. When the weather is warm I love to play spikeball, toss the baseball, study, and relax on Garcelon Field. My claim to fame is the intramural basketball trophy that Haley and I hoisted within the four walls of Alumni Gym, getting buckets and hanging out with our beloved team, nah, family. As a seasoned Habitat for Humanity veteran(I led this trip sophomore year), I can’t wait to show you all the ropes and the beautiful town of Rockland, Maine. We are so stoked to welcome you to this amazing campus… See you in August!!!\n\nHi team! Writing to say hi and give you another (one of many more to come) “Welcome to Bates”! I am a senior and prior to my time at Bates, my home was New Jersey (yes I’ll go to bat for it!) but I went to high school in New York City so I sometimes claim I’m from there (yes real New Yorkers are not big fans of this). At Bates, I spend my time studying (American Studies and Digital and Computational Studies mostly), touring prospective students around campus, working hard with and for my intramural sports team (aka my family, aka current intramural basketball champions), lingering and procrastinating in the comfort of Commons, adventuring to enjoy Maine’s beautiful coast and mountains, cruising down the Quad on my pink razor scooter (when the snow finally melts), and enjoying the some of the greatest company I ever have! You are becoming a part of something really special here at Bates and I am so excited for you all to experience and join in on the energy of this campus. The first smart choice you made was choosing Bates, the second should be joining Adam and I on this exciting adventure! Cheers to August and AESOP!\n\nHi! I’m Drew (she/her) and I’m from Guilford, Connecticut, which is 30 minutes outside of New Haven. I’m an Environmental Studies major, Math minor and I’m on the tennis team. I love to run, hike, and eat ice cream (preferably cookies and cream). I am so excited to be an AESOP leader this year to get to know everyone and introduce Bates!\n\nMy name is Will Phillips and I am a senior Econ Major and Spanish Minor. I also play on the Golf and Hockey team at Bates. I enjoy listening to music, getting outside, and photography in my free time. I am so excited to get to know you guys and help you through the first weeks of college!\n\nSpend your days exploring a variety of lakefront beaches including Sebago Lake, Range Pond, and more! Return to your campground on Sebago Lake each night for meals cooked on camp stoves, smores on the fire, relaxing, and games by firelight. Swimming, beach games, lounging in the sun… what more could you ask for?!\n\nEvacuation Access Level: 1\n\nFrontcountry\n\nActivity Level: Low\n\nAmenities: Running water, showers and flush toilets\n\nSleeping Arrangements: Camping in tents\n\nLake Chillin 2\n\nHey and welcome class of ‘28!! My name is Risa and I’m a rising Senior from Queens, New York majoring in Sociology and minoring in Japanese with a Public Health concentration. At Bates, I’m the vice president of the South Asian Student Association, the community liaison for the Bollywood Dance Team, and I work as a Restorative Practices Advisor. Growing up in Queens surrounded by different kinds of cuisines has fueled my love for good food so I’m always looking to try new eats! In my free time, I love to run, dance, and rot in the sun. Johnny and can’t wait to show you the Bates experience that we love so much. We’re here to build an AESOP community that will last for your entire time at Bates and beyond! You can reach me at rhoriuch@bates.edu if you want to talk or if you have any questions. I love AESOP and I am so so excited to meet and get to know you all!\n\nHey everyone, super excited to meet you all, and welcome to Bates class of ’28. My name is Johnny and I am a Junior from New York, New York majoring in Economics and minoring in Digital Computational Science. At Bates, I am a part of the lacrosse team here on campus, have a radio show, and participate in community engagement with various partners with Bates. Me and Risa became great friends because of the AESOP trip and we hope to create the same relationship for all of you. You can reach me at jnunez@bates.edu if you want to talk or if you have any questions. Once again super excited to meet and get to know you all!\n\nLake Chillin 3 (LGBTQ+ Affinity)\n\nHiiiiii Bob Kittens! I’m Kendall Jones (She/Her) and I’m super excited to be an Aesop Leader this year! I’m a rising senior with a double major in biochemistry and theater. Much like Sophie, I can often be seen on campus cruising on a skateboard (but mine has light up wheels)! I also love throwing a disc around with ColdFront- one of the ultimate frisbee teams, and shredding the slopes of Lost Valley with the Club Ski Team. For inside adventures you can often see me focusing a light, or building a table for the Rob Players or various performance showcases. Similar to Sophie, coming to Bates was a thrilling but exciting experience for me, however pretty much for opposite reasons. I’m from a small town in New Hampshire, so coming to L/A with its 60K (ish) people was a huge leap for me. AESOP was an incredible experience for me as it introduced me to so many people and places in the area around campus. Beyond introducing me to the local community, I was also introduced to the Bates community – which is full of some of the most friendly and passionate people you will ever meet. Bates and L/A have allowed me to become far more confident in myself, so I am ecstatic to introduce them to you all!\n\nHeyyy bob kittens!! My name is Sophie (she/they), and I’m a senior majoring in Stage Management for Theater with a GEC in Environmental Studies. Around campus, you might see me skateboarding from class to class, soaking in every bit of sun I can get, and hanging out with my friends! I’m involved in the Robinson Players- Bates’ century-old and student-run theater group on campus and the Asian Student Association! Coming to Bates was a thrilling and scary experience for me- I was so excited to meet new people and be in a totally different environment from New York City where I grew up, and explore all Maine has to offer. Bates’ student population is full of kind, generous, passionate students, and immediately made me feel welcome in this small tight-knit community. AESOP was such a great opportunity for me to meet others in my year that had similar interests as me, and I’m still really close with some of them! I led a base camping trip to Rangeley my sophomore year, and am so excited to be able to lead another trip and meet y’all!\n\nLake Chillin 4\n\nHey y’all! I’m Iulia (she/hers)! I’m from Westchester, NY and I am an incoming sophomore at Bates. I am a neuroscience major and planning on going pre med (basic I know). I am wicked excited to be Lake Chillin’ with you guys (and Leo)!! When I’m not leading this wonderful aesop with Leo, I play lax (shoutout women’s club lax), sing in an acapella group (a surprise to everyone), teach fourth graders in Lewiston, ski (no park though), hike, and of course chill with my friends (usually forcing them to listen to my country music). Even though I’m forced to say I’m from Westchester, I’m a Maine girl at heart. Living in Maine during the summer (ew, annoying summer kid incoming), I’d like to say I know my way around pretty well aka you’re in good hands (no promises though). Get hype for swimming (and a lil bit of tanning) during the day, sick lake games (to be determined), and sweeeet campfires at night all mixed in with a lil bit of chillin (whatever that even means). In a second, you’re about to meet my fellow co-leader Leo. He’s pretty cool (except for when he makes me type out his whole bio because he can’t spell half of the words)!\n\nThanks for that introduction Iulia!!! Hey guys! I’m Leo (he/him) and I’m also from Westchester, NY (we did not plan that)! I’m a sophomore studying BioChem on the pre-med track. When I’m not locked in Ladd Library studying for Chem, you can find me at Lost Valley making the slopes safer, where I work as a ski patroller. I love hiking, backpacking, skiing, and just being outside. Once the snow has melted you can catch me at our local pond practicing for the Bates Sailing Team. I could not be more excited to lead Lake Chillin with Iulia! Pack your bathing suits because this trip will be 75% Lake and 25% chillin. We will be exploring the beautiful waters of Sebago Lake and Range Pond (seriously look them up, they are so amazing). I will personally see to it that every participant has a perfectly melted s’more in their hand and a warm fire to sit around. By day we will definitely swim, hike, explore, and maybe even “chill”. By night we will cook by the campfire, play some beach games, and tell some campfire stories. Iulia and I can’t wait to chill with you guys in the fall!!\n\nLocated in the mesmerizing wilderness of western Maine, Richardson Lake offers the best of both worlds when it comes to experiencing the outdoors. After a 5-mile paddle to your campsite, you will get camp set up and enjoy the beauty that Maine offers. This canoeing trip allows you to spend your days on the water and enjoy plenty of downtime at night. All the wilderness campsites have a fire ring, outhouse, and picnic table. This trip is perfect for anyone who wants to experience the picturesque natural landscape that Maine has to offer and spend time on the water.\n\nEvacuation Access Level: 4\n\nBackcountry\n\nActivity Level: High\n\nAmenities: Privy toilets\n\nSleeping Arrangements: Camping in tents\n\nMeet the leaders!\n\nRichardson Canoeing 1\n\nMaple is a rising senior with a major in Politics and a concentration in English literature. She is a trip leader in the Outing Club and is very excited to get back into the Maine wilderness after a semester abroad in Madrid, Spain!! She’s also involved with the school newspaper, orchestra, and club sailing team, and enjoys volunteering in the Lewiston elementary schools. Her favorite flavor of ice cream is black raspberry chip. Can’t wait to meet all of you and enjoy some days on the beautiful Maine water :))\n\nCharlotte is a rising senior majoring in Chemistry with a concentration in The Ancient World. She is an avid outdoor enthusiast, spending much of her time in the summer hiking, fishing, swimming, and, of course, walking her dog. At Bates she is a member of the club skiing and sailing teams. She loves to read, cook with her family, but bake alone, and is just learning how to crochet. Charlotte is lactose intolerant but when she decides to eat ice cream her favorite flavor is moose tracks. So excited to meet everyone and spend some time floating and paddling on our lake!!\n\nRichardson Canoeing 2\n\nHey, there! I’m Colby (he/him) and I’m from (Hopkinton) Massachusetts. Here at Bates, I’m studying physics and spending time outside as often as I can. Canoe camping is, in my (correct) opinion, the best version of camping, so I am HYPED to bring you all out to Richardson Lake. In my free time, you’ll find me hanging at commons with my friends, making music, or trying way too hard to make people laugh. My goal during AESOP is to, of course, give you all a GREAT time, cultivate bonds that last through the entirety of your time at Bates, and make your first few days/weeks/months an easy transition (with my excellent advise and the support system of our group). Also, it was “suggested” that I share my favorite animal and ice cream flavor: cow for both. Can’t wait to welcome you all to campus!\n\nHi everyone! My name is Sam Turtle (she/her) and I’m from Belmont CA, which for those of you not familiar with, it’s in the Bay Area/outside of San Francisco. I’m a senior Earth and Climate Science + Biochem double major, meaning I spend lots of time looking at rocks and nature and dabble in the sciences. On a similar note I’m president of the Earth to Bates club (which is super fun and I am 100% not doing self promo here but you should totally join) as well as co-President of the Asian student association. I’m super excited to get to go canoeing and spend some time outdoors camping before the year starts. I am also looking forward to introducing the incoming first years to bates and the community we have here! In my free time I enjoy reading, hiking, embroidering not very well, running, and of course hanging out with my friends in the L.L. Bean flagship store at midnight. My favorite gelato is Maine wild blueberry crisp from gelato fiasco. Favorite animal would have to be a pangolin."
