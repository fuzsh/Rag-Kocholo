        "text": "The limits and possibilities of integration and development strategies in Latin America Emine Tahsin, Istanbul University, Faculty of Economics, Istanbul, Turkey Prepared for delivery at the 2014 Congress of the Latin American Studies Association, Chicago, IL May 21 - 24, 2014 This paper briefly aims to focus on the integration and development strategies regarding the last decade of Latin America. As it is known Latin America is one of the unique geography that the developmentalist approaches and integration policies have strong historical roots. Given that Latin America has its own specific characteristics that is historically defined and goes back to 19th century(Dabene, 2010) during the last decades regarding alternative policies, integration and cooperation initiatives have been on the agenda of the most Latin American governments. Besides in the 20th century, it seems that the divergence and convergence of independency and developmentalism ideas lead to the emergence of two important schools (structuralism and dependency) from Latin America that also have worldwide influences. Based on these, this paper aim to define the roots of neostructuralism, development within,endogenous develeopment and integration concepts in today’s Latin America and aim to analysis the links of related titles with the past and differentiate the changing conditions both on internal and external level. Given that the paper will try to discuss the dimensions of emerging integration and developmentalist alternatives in real terms. The possibilities, limits and contradictions within the international economy and neoliberal era and also the possible effects of the crisis to these initiatives would also be considered. The paper would defragment these two paradigm change in the field of integration and development theory and investigate the place of the integration and cooperation experiences within the multilateral trade system and their reactions with the development process. Key words: Latin America Integration, Alternative development policies in Latin America, Developmentalism, Neostructuralism\n\nIn recent years major international football (soccer) events have been hosted by core nations in Europe and North America. Germany has won the right to host the 2006 World Cup, beating out England and South Africa for the honour. When the deadline for formal candidacy for the Euro 2008 European football championships passed in February 2002, several collaborative bids by peripheral European nations appeared. This paper analyses the domestic and trans-national politics of governments and sporting associations in examining the three bids given the best chance of succeeding (by the time of the conference the winner will be known). Primary focus will be on the Scotland-Ireland joint bid, but discussion will also take in the combined Nordic country bid and the Austria-Switzerland collaboration. Even Greece and Turkey have come together in an effort to win the right to host the championship. The Scottish-Irish case study is particularly salient as Scotland has recently been granted its own assembly with greater governing powers, though not fully independent from Westminster and Ireland faced an election on 10 May 2002. Scottish officials rejected including the northern English stadiums in Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough in preference to a Celtic bid linked with Ireland. The bid faced several crucial hurdles such as local politics surrounding the building of a new stadium in Dundee and the historic politics of the Gaelic Athletic Association and its international class stadium of Croke Park. Soccer has never been played at Croke Park due to an historic ban on English sports on GAA grounds. Finally, the bid hinged on the building of Stadium Ireland, a new state of the art national stadium to be built in Dublin. The paper will focus on themes of intersection between the local, national and global as the relatively small and geographically peripheral European nations of Scotland and Ireland have come together in an effort to host what is regarded as the third most prestigious international sporting event in terms of viewing figures, sponsorship and media interest only being eclipsed by the Olympics and the World Cup of soccer. Following the collaboration of Korea and Japan for the 2002 World Cup, the paper analyses the trend towards collaborative bids for major events and the shifting political economy issues that emerge when formerly less significant nations band together to attract major events.\n\nThis paper is a part of the major study of the Republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia (KChR), an important player on the geopolitical map of Russia’s North Caucasus. By taking a close look at the Batalpashinsk Cossacks from historical, social, and cultural perspectives, this work will attempt to analyze their changing role in this region. The role of local Cossack governance in the development of civil society and the strengthening of democracy in this Republic is on the rise. It is promoted through Christian-Islamic co-existence and interaction, support of the old institutions of fraternity and brotherhood, such as kunachestvo, as well as development of the new ones among the republic’s many nationalities. In contemporary post-Soviet studies, there is no comprehensive study of the Batalpashinsk Cossacks, in particular, nor of the socio-political situation in Karachaevo-Cherkessia, in general. While aiming at filling in this gap, this research will help to expand our knowledge of the North Caucasus as a strategically important region in the southern borderlands of Russia."
