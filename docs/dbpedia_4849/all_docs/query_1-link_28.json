        "text": "\"I Was Meant to Come Here\"\n\nHali has three beautiful children: James, 7, and twin girls Lyla and Lillie, age 2. Hali and the kidsâ father had been in an on and off relationship since high school. When his substance abuse issues started getting out of control and creating a negative environment for her children, Hali decided to break it off with him for good. It was the right decision, but it left her and her kids with no place of their own. They moved in with her parents for a while, but that got to be pretty complicated, so they ended up living with Haliâs friend in Indiana, PA. But there was little stability or consistency. Haliâs mind was constantly racing, trying to figure out ways to care for her kids. She had calls in to some local shelters, but none had called her back. Then, her Mom, who just so happens to be our President Emeritus, Dean Gartlandâs niece, told her about City Mission. âWhy didnât you tell me about this place sooner,â she told her mom, and she made the call to City Mission. Becky McDonald, our Intake Coordinator called her back right away. We didnât have a room available immediately, but Becky called her back to check in every few days, and within a couple of weeks, a spot opened up for her. But Hali had no vehicle and no way of getting to the Mission. So the City Mission van made the two-hour drive out to Indiana to pick her up and give her a ride back here. At the Mission, she found peace and stability, and she began to develop trust and build strong relationships. Hali grew up primarily in Munhall, about twenty minutes from Pittsburgh, but she and her family moved around quite a bit. She was the second youngest of five kids. Her dad was an avid fisherman, and she has vivid memories of going on fishing and camping trips with him and her brothers. In high school, she was a good student. She enrolled in a vocational education program in high school and planned to be a nurse. At the end of the program, she would have finished with a Certified Nursing Assistant license. But her family moved during her Senior year, and she was unable to complete the program. When she was 19, she got pregnant with her son, James. âI had always wanted to be a mom,â she explained. When she was young, her family called her a âmother hen,â because she was always pretending to be a mom for her cousins and her younger sister. So when she found out she was expecting, she was extremely excited, and her parents were very supportive. But it was a rough pregnancy, filled with anxiety. Finally, at 41 weeks, she had an emergency C-section, and her son was born. âThat moment was perfect,â she said. When Hali finally came to City Mission, it gave her a sense of peace for her and her family. âMoms donât typically like to ask for help,â she said. âBut I know I was meant to come here, and everyone has been so nice and welcoming. You literally get support from everybody â staff, residents. And my kids love it here too.â Her children love hanging out on our playground, and they are building strong relationships with the other kids. They also love spending time with Victoria, City Missionâs new Childcare Coordinator. City Mission has given Hali a sense of hope for her future. She wants to go back to school and learn a trade â maybe welding or general construction. And during her time here, she has also learned to trust others. It has been difficult for her to entrust her kids with other people, but her son, who she had previously homeschooled, is now going to public school and is making friends. Her daughters often stay in our childcare area during the time when Hali is going to classes and working to create a brighter future for her family. âCity Mission gives you a sense of relief,â Hali said. âIt gives you the knowledge that you have support and that youâre not alone. You donât ever be afraid to ask for help.â Hali is learning to put her trust in God, and she even hopes to get baptized someday soon. She wants to raise her kids in the church and teach them to grow in their faith day by day. This Mothersâ Day, and every day, you can help moms like Hali find a fresh start and a sense of hope for the future.

He always had nice clothes and cool stuff. He got away with everything. He was the baby of the family. But he also experienced more than his share of trauma when he was young. âMy story is full of the deaths of loved ones,â he explained. Gregâs childhood idol, Roger, rode motorcycles. âRoger would pick me up and put me on his bike and ride me up the hill,â Greg explained. âWhenever I heard the engine of that bike, no matter where I was or what I was doing, I dropped everything and came running.â When Greg was just six years old, Roger wrecked his bike and was killed. It was devastating for Greg to lose his boyhood idol at such a young age, but it didnât diminish his lifelong love of motorcycles. When Greg was 12, his dad died on Christmas. âThatâs when my addiction really took off,â he said. âI hated God. I was angry all the time. I worried about everything. I started having nightmares. I would sleepwalk and wake up shouting, âJesus doesnât love me. He never loved me.ââ Drugs and alcohol momentarily took his anger and his worry away, so he started chasing after them so he could stay in that feeling of numbness as often as possible. But he never learned to deal with his problems or his pain, so everything just continued to get worse. He did receive some social security benefits after his fatherâs death. His mom had a job and didnât need the money for the household, so he spent it all on cool sneakers, nice clothes, and alcohol. He bought himself a dirtbike and learned to ride. In high school, he was a star athlete, but he dropped out of school so he could party. He was getting into fistfights all the time. âI was never really fighting anyone else. I was just fighting what was inside of me,â he explained. âI was fighting my own demons.â When he was 19, he got his first DUI, but the charges were dropped. When he was 21, he went away to state prison for four years. He ended up spending most of the 1990âs in prison. While he was in prison, his Mom passed away. He never really got to say goodbye. He tried to turn his life around, and he got clean for a while in his 20âs and was even engaged to be married to a good, stable young woman who was studying to work in the medical field. On July 4th, she died suddenly of a brain aneurysm, and his life spiraled again. When he was 29, he had his first operation. Arthritis was wreaking havoc on the whole left side of body, and between ages 29 and 47, he would have 13 total operations, including an ACL replacement in his left knee, a reconstruction of his left ankle, reconstructive surgery on his jaw, shoulder reconstruction, and five total hernia surgeries. After one of his hernia surgeries, his body had a bad reaction to the surgical mesh used in the operation, and he was in constant pain for the next eight years. âI went to the emergency room 52 times in eight years,â he explained. During that time, he started doing heavier drugs to help deal with the constant pain he was enduring. âI was angry all the time,â he said. âAngry at myself. I would lash out, get into fights. For me, frustration and depression always turned into anger, because I didnât know how to handle it.â When the surgical mesh was finally removed and the previous surgery corrected, he started feeling better physically, and he started to put together some clean time. He got a good job in a manufacturing plant in Lancaster County. âI was running my own department,â he said. âIâd be a superviser there now if I had stayed.â But he relapsed. He moved back to Pittsburgh and stayed clean for a while. Only to relapse again. And he had his first experiences with fentanyl. âIt got really weird,â he explained. âI was yelling out the windows and talking to dead people. I broke everything in my house. I broke the tv. I had obituaries of strangers just spread out all over the house. I was losing my mind.â In a short period of time, Greg overdosed 24 times. âEight of those times were really serious,â he said. âI woke up in the hospital. But sometimes, Iâd come to on the floor, soaked in sweat. Every three times I would do drugs, I would OD. I was slowly dying. I had no desire to live anymore, but I was too scared to blow my own head off.â Greg believed that suicide was a mortal sin and that he wouldnât see his loved ones in the afterlife if he killed himself. So he just kept killing the pain with drugs. âThey gave me energy and took away all my pain,â he explained. âI didnât feel nothing. No physical pain. No mental anguish. Addiction is a disease of feelings. I just didnât want to feel anything anymore.â His body deteriorated to 150 pounds. He was simply withering away, waiting to die, until one day, his biker friends all came over to his house for an intervention. Each one of them poured out their hearts and let him know how much he meant to them. He went to rehab that night. While in rehab, he met City Mission Chaplain and Housing Coordinator, Doug Bush. And Greg knew that if he was really going to change, he needed to get right with God. After rehab, he came to City Mission to get his life back on track. âAfter eight months at the Mission, I accomplished so much,â he said. âIâm not at all the angry person I was not that long ago. I got my social security benefits. My resentments are pretty much all gone. Even my resentments against myself. Now, when I start to worry or when I feel the anger starting up, I just pray to God. I pray for strength. I pray prayers of gratitude. I pray for the anger to get pulled away from me. And it always does. And mostly, I pray for others.â âCity Mission has given me a place to sit still,â he added. âThey taught me patience. They taught me how to trust people again. They gave me something to believe in and taught me that there is something bigger than myself. They taught me how to pray and how to deal with my anxieties.â âYou know, if anybody else would have done the things to me that I did to myself, I wouldâve beat them up. Instead, I just beat myself up. And I just always thought that I deserved all the pain in my life and all the problems. But the Mission taught me that Iâm not a bad person. They taught me how to be able to deal with myself.â âYou canât worry about yesterday,â Greg added. âYesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery, so you gotta live in the present. When you look in your rearview mirror, you only see a small picture, a limited view. Doing that kept me in my addiction for a long time.â Recently, Greg moved out of the Mission. He moved in with his stepson, while he looks for a place of his own. Today, he is looking forward to his future. âToday, I have no desire to put that junk in me ever again. I have no desire to die. I want to live. I want to have happiness.â And even with all his pain and physical ailments, he still wants to ride his motorcycle. âIâm going to ride my motorcycle for as long as I can. Thatâs my passion. To me, itâs freedom. Itâs the best therapy Iâve ever had. When I get on a bike, all my pains are gone. I can ride for miles.â Greg has been given a second chance. Every day, more people just like Greg, come through our doors in need of healing and restoration.

Boardley worked for 36 years in the coal mine before retiring in 2011. He was ready to relax and play golf and enjoy his retirement, but God had a different plan for his life. Once he reluctantly accepted the position as Maintenance Manager at City Mission, he realized immediately that it was not just a job. It was a ministry! âEvery day, God gives me the opportunity to come alongside the guys I work with,â said Boardly. âItâs really a blessing. The most important thing I do at the Mission every day is to let these guys know how much I love and care about them. And to let them know that weâre a team â a brotherhood. Iâm so thankful every day for these guys.â Last month, Boardleyâs maintenance crew fulfilled 78 work orders all over campus, with jobs ranging from changing a light bulb, to hanging blinds, to painting â anything that is needed. âThe numberâs not important,â Boardley explained. âItâs about getting done what the Mission needs to keep going.â But the Mission Maintenance crew saves City Mission thousands and thousands of dollars on jobs that would have otherwise had to be contracted out to vendors. This past week, Boardley and his team of three residents, Adam, Drew, and Eric, worked in our Womenâs Shelter. They fixed a leaky toilet and replaced the damaged floor around it as well as part of the ceiling in the room below it. They also installed a brand-new sink in the bathroom and replaced a rotted-out window. Additionally, they serviced all of the window air-conditioning units in the Womenâs Shelter. Before coming to City Mission from the Washington County Jail two months ago, Adam owned his own plumbing and construction business, so he has all the skills needed to do professional work all over campus. âI lost everything prior to coming here,â Adam explained. âI lost my business and all of my equipment, but now none of that really matters. This place has changed my life. God really changed me for the better, and Iâm getting it all back tenfold.â At first, Adam was reluctant to come to a homeless shelter. âBut this place is more like a home than a homeless shelter,â he said. âItâs a powerful place. Everybody here is so compassionate and open to listening to my thoughts and feelings and opinions. Thatâs pretty awesome. I used to keep everything bottled up. Being here has really helped me to open up.â Adam is grateful for the opportunity to give back to the Mission by using his construction skills to take care of the building and the grounds around campus. âItâs really satisfying to be able to give back,â he said. âThis place has helped us. The least we can do is to do a good job and do things right.â And today, his future looks bright. âAnything I do for the rest of my life is going to be centered around Christ.â Drew came to City Mission 3 months ago. After living in California for 20 years, he moved back to the area recently to help care for his mom, who is struggling with dementia. When she moved into a nursing home, he started drinking heavily and realized that he couldnât stop on his own, so he went to rehab in Aliquippa. But that proved to be too far from his mom, so as soon as he could, he came to City Mission. And he visits her every chance he gets. âIâm really impressed with Drewâs dedication to visiting his mom,â said Boardley. Twenty-some years ago, Drew moved out to California to help get away from the influences that were leading him down the road to addiction. âIt was a sort of geographical cure,â he explained. For the most part, it worked. He had some bumps along the way, but he was able to work and develop years of experience in construction while living in California. With a degree in Aeronautics and decades of experience in construction, Drew brings a well-rounded skills and knowledge base to the Maintenance crew. On June 25, Drew and Adam were both baptized at the Porter Pillow and Peggie Beaver-Pillow Chapel on City Mission campus. It was a life-changing moment for both of them. Eric, the third member of the Maintenance crew, has been at City Mission for just over three months. This is his second stay at the Mission. âI was successful when I left here the first time,â he said. âIt wasnât that it was unsuccessful. How many times to Peter deny Him? We all have faults. We all have setbacks.â After he left the Mission a few years ago, Eric ended up back in the Washington County Jail. While he was there, he attended every Bible study he could. âIn jail,â he added, âthe whole time I just felt this yearning to come back to the Mission and to be closer to God.â âItâs hard to even put into words how I feel about this place,â he said. âThe Mission has helped me in the process of completely getting out of my own way. Itâs given me an opportunity to figure out how to love other people. To take the focus off of myself and put it on others in a truthful way. Mercy is love in action. If I can show mercy to others, then Iâll receive mercy in return. Iâm just trying to figure out how to do it on a daily basis. And whenever Iâm here at the Mission, itâs not about me.â âEvery job is important,â explained Boardley, âwhen you do it for the Lord. God has us all here at the Mission for a reason. Itâs not a coincedence. This is our chance to honor God with our lives. And God is doing tremendous work here at the Mission â changing lives, reuniting families, and saving souls.â You can help further the ministry at City Mission.

Twenty-some years ago, Drew moved out to California to help get away from the influences that were leading him down the road to addiction. âIt was a sort of geographical cure,â he explained. For the most part, it worked. He had some bumps along the way, but he was able to work and develop years of experience in construction while living in California. With a degree in Aeronautics and decades of experience in construction, Drew brings a well-rounded skills and knowledge base to the Maintenance crew. On June 25, Drew and Adam were both baptized at the Porter Pillow and Peggie Beaver-Pillow Chapel on City Mission campus. It was a life-changing moment for both of them. Eric, the third member of the Maintenance crew, has been at City Mission for just over three months. This is his second stay at the Mission. âI was successful when I left here the first time,â he said. âIt wasnât that it was unsuccessful. How many times to Peter deny Him? We all have faults. We all have setbacks.â After he left the Mission a few years ago, Eric ended up back in the Washington County Jail. While he was there, he attended every Bible study he could. âIn jail,â he added, âthe whole time I just felt this yearning to come back to the Mission and to be closer to God.â âItâs hard to even put into words how I feel about this place,â he said. âThe Mission has helped me in the process of completely getting out of my own way. Itâs given me an opportunity to figure out how to love other people. To take the focus off of myself and put it on others in a truthful way. Mercy is love in action. If I can show mercy to others, then Iâll receive mercy in return. Iâm just trying to figure out how to do it on a daily basis. And whenever Iâm here at the Mission, itâs not about me.â âEvery job is important,â explained Boardley, âwhen you do it for the Lord. God has us all here at the Mission for a reason. Itâs not a coincedence. This is our chance to honor God with our lives. And God is doing tremendous work here at the Mission â changing lives, reuniting families, and saving souls.â You can help further the ministry at City Mission.
