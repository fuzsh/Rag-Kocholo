Our panel will share their experience and stories of individual successes and failures with you.\n\nMany of the mentees we work with have come through some sort of art school experience. Translating the knowledge gained through achieving that qualification into the knowledge required to start or maintain a business can be a larger leap than it appears in prospect. How do you bridge that gap?\n\nSmall scale selling is usually quite easy to make happen, but ongoing and sustainable growth towards establishing a career in the area is a different matter. How do you scale up?\n\nThere is an ever changing environment for finding and maintaining customers. Things can go very well â€“ or not - in spite of all efforts. How do you manage this?\n\nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A.\n\nOur panel:\n\nChristopher Brown - Illustrator\n\nChristopher Brown attended the Royal College of Art where he was introduced to, and eventually assisted, Edward Bawden, the master of the linocut.
