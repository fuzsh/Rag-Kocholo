When listening closely and delivering on promises to clients, good things seem to happen for everyone.\n\nWhen my wife allows for it, endurance sports such as ultra-running, mountain-climbing and mountain biking are my current passions.\n\nclose\n\nTammy Carniel\n\n\"Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives puts us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.\" - Anonymous\n\nRead More\n\nTammy Carniel\n\nI love the outdoors when it's summer, but I struggle quite a bit during winter time, as I dislike being cold. During winter I spend a lot of time indoors. Don't get me wrong, I do go out during winter, but to stay inside somewhere else.\n\nSince I was little I liked nail designs, so when I am not working, I am probably doing someone else's nails. I even have an Instagram page where I post all my designs.\n\nclose\n\nTammy Sewray\n\nI love spending time with my family and friends! In the summer I enjoy relaxing by the pool, four wheeling or out on the lake fishing. During the winter you will find me in the Ice Castle ice fishing and enjoying time with my family.\n\nclose\n\nTaylor Bekken\n\nI love the outdoors and spending time with family. In the winter, you can find me snowboarding or ice fishing. During the summer months, I will most likely be playing frisbee golf or floating on the water. I also have a do-it-yourself mentality. I enjoy tackling hands-on projects like automotive work, landscaping, and carpentry.\n\nclose\n\nTaylor Frost\n\nI am a hobby baker in my spare time, with a mild sprinkle addiction.

But someone will say, \"You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.” - James 2:17 & 18\n\nRead More\n\nTim Holzmann\n\nWhen I am not working, I enjoy eating good food and watching shows about food and food culture, historical documentaries, and movies with more dialog than CGI. On a pleasant spring or fall day and all holidays, I will most likely be grilling or smoking something for a meal that day. I enjoy sports and when I get the chance will be on the golf course with two of my four daughters. Activities with my family are most important to me whether it be at home an event or our church.\n\nclose\n\nTim O'Leary\n\nI am a Rock n Roll enthusiast and enjoy the live music scene, especially with family.

I enjoy all sports, particularly college football, which you can find me watching most Saturdays - Minnesota Gophers or Notre Dame Fighting Irish.\n\nclose\n\nTodd Jacobs\n\nPassion for technology is in my blood. Ever since a ninth-grade computer science class where we made a stick man go across the screen programming in machine language and getting on “the internet” after my parents bought me a modem in 1986, I have been hooked. I very much enjoy serving and have been on five mission trips (Guatemala and Honduras) where I get a chance to practice speaking Spanish and live out my Christian faith. Outside of work, I like to be outside, play video games, RC cars/planes/drones, motorsports, fishing and obviously, embrace technology in most everything I do.\n\nclose\n\nTracey Jones\n\nI am an avid outdoorsman and enjoy farming, camping.

Love chasing a little white ball around a golf course and am approaching 20 years of playing Fantasy Football (only one championship). I went to the University of Memphis when it was known as Memphis State (Go Tigers Go). What I love about my job is the interaction and connection with people. I have friends that happen to be clients.\n\nclose\n\nWendy Martin\n\nI love spending my free time hanging out with the family. I have recently become an “empty nester,” which I am not happy about.
