        "text": "she/her\n\nCatey joined Tremont as President and CEO in the Fall of 2018. A Tennessee native, Catey formed an early connection to the outdoors and first attended Tremont Institute in the sixth grade with her school.\n\nInspired by her time in nature, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Ecology and Environmental Biology from Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. After graduation, she completed an internship with the Fisheries Department in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and then hiked 400+ miles of the Appalachian Trail through Virginia.\n\nCatey has worked in non-profit administration for nearly 20 years, previously as SOAR’s Chief Financial Officer. She is strongly committed to conservation, having served on the Conservation Trust of North Carolina and their Future Leaders Conservancy advisory board. She has also served as a board member for Alliance For Better Nonprofits. She is currently servings as Board Treasurer for SOAR, Inc.\n\nHer certifications include CPR, Wilderness First Aid, and PADI Open Water Diver. Catey enjoys climbing and paddling and is working on completing all 800 miles of trails in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nhe/him\n\nPete grew up in central Kentucky, where he enjoyed outdoor sports and was active in scouting. He attended graduate school at the University of Tennessee and spent time in the Smoky Mountains before leaving to begin his career in New Mexico. Upon returning to Knoxville, he worked in local government and non-profits, and had a 21+ year career in facility management, operations, and property development in the private sector.\n\nPete holds an undergraduate degree in Industrial Education and Technology from Murray State University and a Master’s Degree in Planning with concentrations in land-use and educational facilities planning from the University of Tennessee.\n\nPete’s hobbies include running, hiking, and kayaking. He enjoys spending time with his family and is active in the Knoxville trail running community.\n\nhe/him\n\nJohn grew up catching snakes and turtles in the creeks of upstate South Carolina, and he has never lost his love of wild things and wild places. He has a BA in English Literature from Notre Dame and an MS in Natural Resources from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. In over 15 years experience in environmental education, he has worked in places as far-flung as New England, Georgia, Yosemite NP, and far eastern Russia; but there is no place he’d rather be than the southern Appalachians. He enjoys hiking, biking, kayaking, turning over logs, and playing/singing folk tunes.\n\nshe/her\n\nAs a Maryville native, Kathy grew up with the Smokies in her backyard. As a child, she and her family would visit Cades Cove and the Tremont area regularly – she distinctly remembers swimming in the river just beyond the entrance to Tremont. In sixth grade, she joined her class for a multi-day field trip to Tremont, an experience thousands of students still get to have each school year. Kathy still enjoys spending as much time as possible outdoors, especially when her family is able to join her. Kathy received an associate’s degree from Hiwassee College and a BS in Accounting from Tennessee Wesleyan University – she’s excited to bring her years of experience back home to the Smokies.\n\nhe/him\n\nAlthough he was born and raised on the eastern shore of Maryland, Logan has found a home in Walker Valley and the Smokies. He’s excited to have a job where he can help people make their own connections in such a special place. Logan has undergraduate degrees in English Literature and French Language from St. Mary’s College of Maryland, and an M.A. in Environmental Education from Prescott College. Logan’s favorite things to do outside include birding, wildlife tracking, and freshwater snorkeling, but most of all exploring the natural world with his family. His favorite food is pad thai and if he had the opportunity he would totally adopt a raven as a pet. Logan is a professional-level wildlife tracker certified by Tracker Certification North America.\n\nshe/her\n\nOriginally from the tiny town of Bat Cave, North Carolina, Erin grew up in a house sandwiched between a river and mountain. Many of her earliest memories include watching tadpoles, swinging on kudzu vines and playing in a rhododendron fort with her brother. Erin earned a degree in sustainable community development from Berea College in Kentucky, and then went on to receive the Compton Mentor Fellowship. Erin has worked in marketing with regional and national nonprofit organizations for over a decade. She serves on the Keep Knoxville Beautiful board of directors, and is the past chair of the board for the International Storytelling Center based out of Jonesborough, Tennessee. Erin lives in Knoxville with her husband, two cats and a playful pup. She can often be found hiking her favorite trails, rock climbing at her local gym, or curled up on the couch with a good book.\n\nshe/her\n\nRaised outside of Washington, D.C., Megan regularly retreated to the Appalachian mountains during her childhood summers for respite from a demanding schedule of school, music lessons, and Beltway traffic. Moving south to Richmond, VA, to study Vocal Performance and Marketing at Virginia Commonwealth University, she stayed in the area after graduation to build her career in communications, marketing, and relationship management at regional and national companies and non-profits. Her time at the Virginia Wine Board, where she explored wineries throughout the Blue Ridge, reignited her passion for the Appalachian mountains that helped raise her. Early in 2021, Megan and her family finally answered the call of the Great Smoky Mountains, which had been knocking on their hearts for years. She counts herself lucky to be living in these revered peaks and valleys and is honored to be a part of Tremont’s story by drumming up the support it takes to continue its bold mission. Megan lives in Walland, TN with her husband, son, mother-in-law, dog, and two cats.\n\nKelly grew up surrounded by pecan orchards in South Georgia near the Flint River, where she spent much of her time swimming in the nearby natural springs and bike riding country roads. She later moved to Florida and enjoyed fishing, kayaking, and snorkeling while living on both the east and west coasts of Florida for 13 years before moving to Tennessee. She and her family have always loved the mountains and beauty each season holds in East Tennessee. Kelly and her family vacationed in the area for many years before making Maryville their home in 2021.\n\nIn her spare time, Kelly enjoys spending time with her family, gardening, beekeeping, hiking, traveling, and just being outdoors.\n\nElizabeth is a native east Tennessean who grew up exploring and backpacking in the Southern Appalachians before moving away to the snowy mountains of the northeast. She received a B.A. in Environmental Studies and Conservation Biology from Middlebury College, worked at John C. Campbell Folk School in North Carolina, spent a few seasons at the Ashokan Center in the Catskills, and hiked from Maine to Georgia on the Appalachian Trail before finding her way back home. She has worked at Tremont full-time since 2014, and in her free time enjoys long hikes and paddling trips in wild places, woodworking, growing food, and reading good books.\n\nAlexis grew up around Birmingham, Alabama, where she spent much of her life outdoors playing competitive soccer (though she also loves many other sports, including hockey.) She quickly learned that Alabama is one of the most biodiverse states in the country and wanted to learn more about how to protect it. She graduated from the University of Montevallo in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies and a minor in Political Science. At Montevallo, she was part of a hiking club – her favorite hike was caving in Raccoon Mountain, and the toughest hike was the Fiery Gizzard Trail in Tennessee because they hiked 15 miles in one day. She interned at the Alamanba Wildlife Center, where she found a love and appreciation for songbirds and raptors. She came to Tremont with her National Parks and Public Lands class, where she fell in love with the mission of connecting people to nature.\n\nJeremy was born and raised in the foothills of Southern Appalachia. He has a deep-rooted love for the biodiversity that encompasses the Great Smoky Mountains and loves to connect people with nature, especially with salamanders. His career has taken him out west to the Klamath Mountains of California where he has monitored for a variety of threatened amphibians and reptiles. He eventually became interested in fisheries sciences and began getting involved with salmonid conservation projects across the Northern California Coast with Americorps. But now he has returned to the mountains that he calls home, and is excited for his next adventure with Tremont. When the weather’s warm, you’ll find Jeremy backpacking. When the skies are clear, you’ll find him stargazing, and when the weather is cold, you’ll catch him snowboarding. Jeremy loves to cook, and would happily serve anyone a plate full of his homemade pierogies. If you find a moment when he is not doing any of these things, then he is likely playing with his dog named Toast.\n\nshe/her\n\nLindsey hails from the suburbs of Nashville, in Franklin, Tennessee, and grew up playing outside and exploring nature as much as possible. The Smoky Mountains run deep in her veins, having grown up visiting the park almost yearly to bike the Cades Cove loop and swim in Laurel Creek with her family. Even before she was born, her parents loved this area so deeply they gave her the middle name of Cades, after the cove!\n\nLindsey earned her B.S. from Mississippi State University in Environmental Geosciences with a minor in GIS and Remote Sensing. While she was in school, she spent a summer as a Community Science Intern at Tremont, putting her on the path to a career in outdoor education. She is thrilled to be working full-time in Walker Valley! While not at work she enjoys life with her fiance, Adam, and cat, Biscuit.

Her connection to nature and concern about ecological issues led her toward a career in environmental education. She stayed in the Midwest for college and graduated from Loyola University with a degree in Environmental Science. Her love for outdoor education grew through her work at nature center day camps and a conservation district, and she is continuously energized by working outdoors and seeing the effects of programs on participants.

In her free time, you might find her reading, running, looking for bears, or doing the same puzzle for the tenth time.\n\nKristen grew up in the backwoods of Southern IL, spending the days catching fish in the creek, picking wildflowers in the fields, and exploring the woods surrounding her home. She recognized the profound power of the outdoors, and pursued a degree in Outdoor Leadership at Young Harris College to initiate a life-long mission: sharing nature as a tool to heal, connect, challenge, and grow. This passion led Kristen to work across the country, guiding long canoe expeditions in the Minnesota Boundary Waters, teaching survival skills in the Ozarks, and mushing dogs across remote glaciers in Alaska. Kristen also embarked on personal adventure challenges, and completed the Triple Crown of thru-hiking (over 8,000 miles!), paddled the 750-mile Northern Forest Canoe Trail, and undertook many long wilderness expeditions.
