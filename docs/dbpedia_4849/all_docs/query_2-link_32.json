        "text": "Dear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on the Colgate Board of Trustees meetings, which took place Thursday, May 2, through Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Hamilton. We were pleased to return to campus after our fall meetings and see the progress of the many campus projects.\n\nThe meeting was a celebratory one. Along with faculty, students, and special guests, the board attended the naming ceremony for Bernstein Hall — in the shadow of Peter’s Glen, which is dramatically taking shape on the hillside leading to the Upper Campus. We attended the Academic Awards Convocation and the faculty tunk at Raab House, and we celebrated retiring trustees at dinner in the now finished Robert H.N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Center at Olin Hall.\n\nDuring a special topics session with the board, Vice President and Dean of the College McLoughlin and Provost and Dean of the Faculty Cushing led a discussion about artificial intelligence and its potential impact on the University. Panelists included students, staff, and faculty members, who shared how they are currently using AI and what they believe Colgate should consider as the impact of that technology grows.\n\nFriday evening, we celebrated and honored four trustees whose terms are ending this year. I want to thank Gretchen H. Burke ’81, P’11,’20, Jeanne A. Follansbee ’78, P’08, and Gus P. Coldebella ’91 for their dedicated service to the board and to Colgate. Together, they have given 45 years of service on the board.\n\nThe formal board meeting took place Saturday morning with committee chair reports and official board actions — including the approval of faculty appointments and the conferring of degrees. The following trustees were re-elected to another three-year term: Daniel C. Benton ’80, H’10, P’10, Udayan Das Roy ’04, Carmine Di Sibio ’85, P’18,’21, Julian W. Farrior ’93, Yvonne M. Gyimah ’01, Christian B. Johnson ’02, Denniston M. Reid Jr. ’94, Tom B. Tyree Jr. ’83, and Carlton W. Walker ’10. The board voted to welcome Gabriel Schwartz ’00, Leslie F. Seidman ’84, and Tal-ee Roberts ’01 as new trustees in the fall. Christine J. Chao ’86 and Joseph P. McGrath Jr. ’85, P ’15,’20 were elected as vice chairs of the board. In addition, Angela Carrizosa Aparicio was elected secretary to the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe board recognized $11,830,000 million in new gifts received since the board’s winter meetings. These gifts are designated for an endowed scholarship, financial aid, athletics facilities, and undergraduate research.\n\nLast May, Thomas “Toby” S. Bozzuto ’96 was announced as the next board chair. He will formally take this new leadership position in July. I have greatly enjoyed working with him during this year of transition.\n\nAs I complete my tenure on the Colgate Board of Trustees, I am both saddened and excited. I am sad to leave this group of extraordinary volunteers who care so much about our beloved Colgate. However, I am excited to see what Toby, the board, President Casey, and Colgate University will achieve in the coming years.\n\nWith regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Colgate University Board of Trustees\n\nDear Colgate Faculty, Staff, and Students,\n\nI write to share an update to the campus from the Colgate Board of Trustees meetings that took place Thursday, January 25 through Saturday, January 27, 2024.\n\nMembers of the board, together with senior administrators and faculty members, engaged in meaningful discussions about some of the most pressing issues about higher education that have been much in the nation's consciousness for several months: free speech and discourse, campus policies, and the potential impact of artificial intelligence on college and universities. I’d like to thank the faculty members who joined and significantly enriched our discussions.\n\nOne of the key outcomes of our discussions, with respect to the first topic, was that the trustees and the faculty members saw the continued strength of our Statement on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression, and the trustees called upon the administration and faculty to consider meaningful ways to make this statement both more known on the campus and a resource to all as we seek to continue our commitment to free academic inquiry and the needs of our community.\n\nFriday evening, President Casey hosted a panel on artificial intelligence, technology, and the liberal arts at The Times Center. Here is a short clip of that event.\n\nThe board heard about the considerable progress on the Third-Century Plan and the Campaign for the Third Century that included updates on continued planning for the Lower Campus Initiative, village housing, campus improvements, and the extension of the Colgate Commitment. Of particular note, the trustees were updated about the progress on the two new academic centers that will be open later this year.\n\nIn addition to the progress on the Third-Century Plan, President Casey shared that Colgate received more than 20,000 applications for the Class of 2027. This year’s applicant pool continues Colgate’s trend of attracting some of the most academically talented students.\n\nTrustees were also pleased to hear that year-end fundraising has produced record-breaking results for the University. The total amount raised in the campaign to date is $565,534,902. Since July 1, 2023, the University has received over $50 million in new gifts and commitments. The year-end challenge strengthened the Colgate Fund.\n\nThe board discussed the AY24-25 budget, and the administration is on track to present the final recommendations for the budget at the May meeting of the Board. Senior Vice President J.S. Hope offered the very good news that Standard & Poor’s (S&P) affirmed Colgate’s AA rating in its annual review of the institution’s financial health.\n\nSpecific actions of the board were taken in the formal session, which included recognizing new gifts to the endowment. Among the highlights of new gifts were the following donations to Colgate:\n\n$25,000,000 bequest intention from an anonymous donor for endowed financial aid support for first-generation students;\n\n$4,000,000 from J. Christopher Clifford ’67, H’11, P’93 and Caroline M Clifford ’93 for numerous elements of the Third-Century Plan;\n\n$2,500,000 from Eric J. Andersen ’87 and Pamela S. Andersen ’88, P’16, ’22, ’23 for the athletics capital plan for football;\n\n$1,000,000 from Toby Bozzuto ’96 and Robin Bozzuto to establish the Toby and Robin Bozzuto Scholarship Fund in support of the Colgate Commitment;\n\n$1,000,000 undesignated bequest intention from James P. Digan ’87;\n\n$1,000,000 from an anonymous donor for endowed financial aid in support of the Colgate Commitment; and\n\n$1,000,000 from an anonymous donor for endowed financial aid in support of the Colgate Commitment.\n\nThe board expressed great interest in how Colgate is communicating progress on Third-Century Plan initiatives to regional and national communities as well as to campus constituents and alumni. With two major academic buildings opening this year, we need to ensure that we are not shy about our leadership position in higher education.\n\nThe trustees wished to express their gratitude to all members of the Colgate community for their continued work in service of the University’s academic mission and for all the progress made to meet the ambitions of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Colgate University Board of Trustees\n\nDear Colgate Faculty, Staff, and Students,\n\nI write to report to the Colgate community today to share news from the Board of Trustees meetings, which took place Thursday, Sept. 28, through Saturday, Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nAt the meetings, we welcomed new board members: Michele Alexandre ’96, Chad Cooley ’00, Susie Becker Gould ’03, and Noah Wintroub ’98. The new Alumni Council president, Lauri Curtis Hadobas ’77, began her ex officio service on the board during these meetings as well.\n\nThe strategic sessions on Friday, led by President Casey, focused on the four pillars of the Third-Century Plan:\n\nI. Attracting and Supporting Outstanding Students, Faculty, and Staff;\n\nII. Strengthening Colgate’s Academic Enterprise;\n\nIII. Enriching the Student Experience;\n\nIV. Improving the Campus and Its Environs.\n\nAs part of this portion of the board meetings, Provost and Dean of the Faculty Lesleigh Cushing provided updates on Middle Campus capital and programmatic planning, with a particular focus on the teaching and research that will take place in the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation. She also spoke about future Middle Campus projects, such as the planned renovation of James C. Colgate Hall and an upcoming arts pavilion.\n\nVice President and Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin then updated the trustees on Lower Campus Initiative progress, highlighting the first projects that will begin in May. He emphasized the fundamental principles underlying this long-term effort, including creating additional social spaces for all Colgate students and providing greater equity in residential living for juniors and seniors. Interim Director of Athletics Yariv Amir gave an update on the progress in planning new athletics facilities to replace Reid Athletic Center and other enhancements to both our athletic programs and the student-athlete experience at Colgate.\n\nFinally, Vice President JS Hope shared plans for the redevelopment of 18–22 Utica Street, which will provide new housing options and additional retail and office space downtown. This project is designed, among other things, to help address the acute housing needs of Colgate faculty and staff.\n\nThe trustees next focused on how the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to end affirmative action will impact the University’s admissions processes. That discussion was led by the Jones and Wood Family Vice President for Admission and Financial Aid Gary Ross and Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Tara Bubble. Vice President Renee Madison then shared planning for the next iteration of Colgate’s DEI Plan. President Casey also discussed with the Board an ambitious vision for new enhancements to the Colgate Commitment — work on which he and Colgate’s advancement team will focus on in the coming months.\n\nThe programmatic committees of the board (Academic Mission and Programs; Campus Life and Programs; University Outreach; and University Resources) also met during the weekend, as did the board’s governance committees, including Audit, Legal Affairs and Risk Management, the DEI Committee (which met for the first time as a standing oversight and governance committee), and Nominating, Governance and Trustee Development.\n\nThe formal meeting of the full board took place Saturday morning. President Casey provided a report on various matters and plans on campus, JS Hope provided the treasurer’s report, and committee chairs reported on their respective meetings. Formal board actions following the reports included the approval of faculty appointments. The board also acknowledged receipt of $3,000,000 in gifts since the May 2023 meeting.\n\nThe board was excited to see the progress on a variety of campus capital projects and to hear about how the many initiatives outlined in our long-term strategic plan will support the work and life of faculty, students, and staff. They were especially pleased to meet Links, FSEM faculty, and Presidential Ambassadors over meals.\n\nThe year is off to a great start, and the board thanks the entire Colgate community for helping fulfill our mission and the promise of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nWith regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Colgate University Board of Trustees\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on the Board of Trustees meetings, which took place Thursday, May 11, through Saturday, May 13, 2023, in Hamilton. We were pleased to return to campus after our fall meetings and see the progress on the Ho Mind, Brain, Behavior construction and Olin Hall renovation as well as the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation construction. Many board members were able to tour these sites and were excited to see these Third-Century Plan capital projects.\n\nA major highlight of the weekend was the announcement of a $20 million gift from John Hoyns ’76 — which puts the Campaign for the Third Century halfway to our $1 billion goal. The gift is designated to the Colgate Commitment, a key initiative of the Third-Century Plan. The board considered other issues vital to achieving the goals of the Third-Century Plan, including updates on Lower Campus planning, the athletics facilities planning, and the financial and capital frames that support these and other initiatives. It also learned about plans to strengthen Thought Into Action and its integration into the Middle Campus Initiative in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation.\n\nDuring a special topics session, President Casey and Dean Cushing led a discussion about academic freedom and freedom of expression using Colgate’s statement as a foundational document. This robust conversation provided trustees with insights into how the University promotes academic freedom and freedom of expression and how we can continue to make freedom of expression central to Colgate’s goals and objectives.\n\nThe programmatic committees of the board also met during the weekend. Among the highlights of these meetings were a discussion of changing our accreditors from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education to the New England Commission of Higher Education; further discussions about the governance of Colgate’s centers and institutes; five-year trends in admission and financial aid; and the long-term financial model for the University.\n\nFriday evening, we celebrated and honored three trustees whose terms are ending this year. I want to thank Eric A. Cole ’93, P’24,’26, Andy S. Greenfield ’74, P’12, and Robert C. Johnson ’94, P’24,’26 for their dedicated service to the board and to Colgate. Together, they have given 33 years of service on the board.\n\nThe formal board meeting took place Saturday morning. Committee chairs reported on their meetings. Formal board actions followed these reports — including the approval of faculty appointments, the conferring of degrees, and changing our accreditors from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education to the New England Commission of Higher Education. The following trustees were reelected to another three-year term: Eric J. Andersen ’87, P’16,’22,’23, Jean-Pierre L. Conte ’85, Theresa Donahue Egler ’77, P’07,’11, Nora Gleason Leary ’82, Joseph P. McGrath Jr. ’85, P’15,’20, and Andrew W. Sweet ’93. The board will be welcoming the following new trustees in the fall: Michele Alexandre ’96, Chad Cooley ’00, Susie Becker Gould ’03, and Noah Wintroub ’98.\n\nIn addition to accepting and acknowledging the $20 million gift from John Hoyns ’76, the board recognized a $1 million gift from Michael E. Crown ’10 and Jackie K. Crown ’09 for the new athletics facilities and the formal transfer of the Thought Into Action trademarks to Colgate University by Andy Greenfield and Wills Hapworth ’07.\n\nFinally, upon completion of this meeting, Thomas “Toby” S. Bozzuto ’96 was announced as the next board chair. He will formally take this new leadership position in July 2024. I look forward to working with him in the coming year as I complete my tenure as board chair.\n\nIt’s exciting to see the extensive work taking place on campus, and the board looks forward to gathering again in Hamilton in September.\n\nWith regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Colgate University Board of Trustees\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nThe Colgate University Board of Trustees gathered in New York City for its winter meetings, which included full meetings of all the trustees as well as committees. The meetings concluded with a full-board session on Saturday, January 28. The meetings were rich and informative. Further, the trustees were especially happy to return to their first in-person mid-winter meeting since 2020. This format afforded us an opportunity not only to engage in many meaningful discussions, but also to reconnect with members of the Trustee Emeriti Council — again, for the first time since 2020.\n\nAs the trustees noted during these meetings, this is truly an exciting and transformative time for the University. The board was very pleased to learn more about the over 21,000 applications for admission into Colgate’s Class of 2027. It has become increasingly apparent that Colgate’s significant increases in financial aid, including the removal of federal loans in most student aid packages under the Colgate Commitment, have made the University more appealing to an ever-wider group of the nation’s (and, indeed, the world’s) strongest students.\n\nThe trustees were also pleased that momentum in admissions is being matched in Colgate’s fundraising efforts. At these meetings, the board formally accepted more than $38 million in new gifts, all in support of the four pillars of the Third-Century Plan. These new gifts are earmarked for increasing faculty support with new endowed chairs; additional funding for arts, creativity, and innovation; and a number of gifts dedicated to capital projects within the Third-Century Plan.\n\nThe trustees spent considerable time with senior administrators reviewing ongoing and upcoming construction and capital projects on campus, including work to construct the Ho Mind Brain Behavior Center and complete renovations of Olin Hall. The board also heard construction updates for the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation, Reid Athletic Center, and early stage reviews of plans now in development for the Lower Campus Initiative.\n\nAdditional strategic discussions focused on developing initiatives for new housing for faculty and staff and increasing support for faculty. In light of the national conversation about mental health on college campuses, the board held a special session focused on how Colgate is addressing mental health support and accommodations on campus. All recognized that national trends in anxiety and other mental health challenges are placing enormous pressure on Colgate students, and staff and faculty members. This will be a topic that we will continue to monitor this year and in the years to come.\n\nBoard committees discussed the governance of Colgate’s centers, institutes, and programs, and heard a number of updates from the Provost and Dean of the Faculty, the Dean of the College, and the departments of Athletics, and University Communications. Additionally, each committee of the board engaged in discussion of diversity, equity, and inclusion issues in higher education relevant to each committee, including a discussion of how Colgate can harmonize its commitment to freedom of expression with its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nFormal board actions on Saturday included approval of new faculty appointments; approval of an updated faculty dismissal policy; approval of the first capital projects of the Lower Campus Initiative; a bylaw revision regarding voting privileges for contingent faculty; and approvals of a number of capital project budgets.\n\nThe board acknowledged the extensive work taking place on campus to continue to strengthen Colgate and its academic mission and the dedication of the University’s faculty and staff as the new semester begins. We look forward to gathering again in Hamilton in May.\n\nWith regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Colgate University Board of Trustees\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on the Board of Trustees meetings, which took place Friday, Sept. 30, through Saturday, Oct. 1, 2022. At the meetings, we welcomed a new Board member, Garfield Smith ’85, who previously served as a young alumni trustee from 1985 to 1989.\n\nFriday’s general strategic sessions focused, first, on long-term planning for Colgate’s Lower Campus, the area of campus along Broad and College streets, housing the vast majority of the University’s juniors and seniors. Presentations by architects from Robert A.M. Stern and Beyer Blinder Belle showed trustees the extensive planning that has taken place alongside campus governing bodies to understand the long-term needs for and possibilities of the Lower Campus.\n\nThe architectural advisers and planners also outlined the necessary regulatory hurdles to be addressed as we consider the long-term plan for the development of the neighborhood. Vice President and Dean of the College Paul McLoughlin, Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration JS Hope, and Associate Vice President for Planning Steve Hughes have done an incredible job pulling together a thoughtful framework that will allow for the development of a comprehensive upper-level residential system — one that will meaningfully enhance the experience for all of our students in their junior and senior years. The planning is still very much under development, but the trustees are confident in the process and the results so far.\n\nVice President and Director of Athletics Nicki Moore then presented the Third-Century Plan for Athletics, which prioritizes the reimaging and renovation of the Reid Athletics Center to meet the needs of the current Colgate student body and athletic program as well as raising new endowments for the program, which will support student scholarships, coaching positions, and program activities.\n\nDuring the weekend, the trustees, together with students, faculty, and staff, gathered on Whitnall Field to break ground for the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation. The generosity of Dan Benton ’80, H’10, P’10 has provided the first move in the transformation of the Middle Campus Plan for Arts, Creativity, and Innovation, a key initiative of the Third-Century Plan. I would like to thank Professor Lynn Schwarzer, Jessica Steib ’23, and Leila Ribeiro ’25 for posters depicting student work that would take place in the Benton Center when it is completed.\n\nThe programmatic committees of the Board then met in the afternoon following the general presentations on the Third-Century Plan. Among the highlights of these meetings was an update on the expansion of the Colgate Commitment. Due to the generosity of our alumni and careful stewardship of resources by the senior administration, Colgate has expanded the Colgate Commitment such that federal student loans will be removed from all financial aid packages for those coming from families with incomes of $175,000 or less. The Board was also pleased to hear of the increase in the cost of attendance portion of student financial aid packages to meet the average cost of textbooks and course materials.\n\nThese meetings were followed by dinner at the newly renovated Seven Oaks Clubhouse, during which time the trustees met with students from the Colgate Class of 2023 who have been selected as Presidential Ambassadors.\n\nThe formal Board meeting took place Saturday morning. Committee chairs reported out on the meetings they have held this fall. Formal Board actions followed these reports — including the approval of faculty appointments; the approval of extension of voting privileges to contingent faculty; the formal appointment of architects of record for a variety of capital projects; the approval to move forward with the master planning of Lower Campus; and the approval to move forward with the planning of the landscape potions of the Middle Campus, including the Ravine, which will connect the Upper and Middle campuses. Finally, the Board acknowledged receipt of new gifts to the University’s endowment. Since the Board last met, the University has received three new gifts of over $1M, totaling more than $3.5 million in new endowment.\n\nThe Board is excited about the work being done across campus and looks forward to even more momentum by the time of the January meetings.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nBoard Chair\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report to Colgate faculty, staff, and students on the just-completed Board of Trustees meeting, which took place May 6–7, 2022, in Hamilton. The trustees were pleased to return to campus to hold meetings in person and to have an opportunity to spend time with faculty, staff, and students.\n\nThe meetings began with a faculty and trustee event to honor and thank Interim Provost and Dean of the Faculty Ellen Percy Kraly for her exemplary year of service to the University, following many years as a teacher, scholar, and administrator. Many trustees also attended the Academic Awards Convocation and witnessed the announcement of the 1819 Award winners for 2022: Hilary Almanza and Alex Tran. Finally, they attended the groundbreaking of the Robert H.N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Center, a major component of the Third-Century Plan. The weekend marked an important time in Colgate’s history, as it embarks on the Campaign for the Third Century, a fundraising effort that will support the ambition of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nThe University launched the Campaign for the Third Century with two events in New York City in April, and we will soon share that message with the thousands of alumni, who will soon return to Hamilton for two alumni reunion weekends to be held this June. As part of the Campaign for the Third Century, the Board formally acknowledged and accepted more than $42 million in new gifts, bequests, intentions, and pledges received since its last meeting in January. The following are highlights of those gifts:\n\nMore than $32 million for financial aid endowments and gifts for the Colgate Commitment\n\n$3 million in new gifts for the renovation of Reid Athletic Center\n\n$2.5 million for the creation of a new endowed faculty chair\n\n$2 million in endowment for academic programs\n\nThese gifts demonstrate the momentum of the campaign.\n\nIn the Board’s strategic session, President Casey and members of the Cabinet reviewed many updates to the Third-Century Plan, including progress on the planning for the Robert H. N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Center and the renovation of Olin Hall; plans for the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation, which will break ground in the fall; progress on fundraising for new endowed chairs; and continued improvements to our admission and financial aid programs. Another year of record-breaking applications has the Office of Admission and Financial Aid planning carefully for the Class of 2026 to enroll a target class size of 795. In addition to the acceptance of gifts to the University as noted above, the Board also approved the allocation of $3 million toward the design costs of the Reid renovation. Throughout the strategic session, the Board received updates on the University’s long-term financial model and how third-century plans are aligning with institutional resources.\n\nThe Board dedicated Friday morning to DEI discussions with regard to Board operations and to learning about campus-based DEI efforts.\n\nThe trustees expressed sincere gratitude to the Colgate community for its efforts this past year. Despite the challenges of the pandemic and its aftermath, the University continues to move forward with the initiatives set forth in the Third-Century Plan. The newly launched Campaign for the Third Century will help the University achieve its ambitious goals and transform all aspects of Colgate.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Board of Trustees\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report to Colgate faculty, staff, and students on the just-completed Board of Trustees meeting, which took place January 28, 2022, via Zoom.\n\nPresident Casey began the series of meeting sessions by sharing some extraordinary campus highlights. First, as has been reported widely, Colgate received over 21,000 applications for the class of 2026, representing 21% growth over last year's record number. In two years, applications to Colgate have increased 146%. Importantly, this year's applicant pool is the most academically talented and most diverse group the admission office has ever seen.\n\nNext, the trustees received reports on Colgate's fundraising efforts over the past few months. The trustees were pleased to hear that year-end fundraising has produced record-breaking results for the University. Since July 1, 2021, the University has received $81 million in new gifts and commitments. At the meeting, the Board formally accepted $49 million in new gifts to Colgate, all received since its October meeting.\n\nAmong the highlights of these new gifts were the following donations to Colgate:\n\n$23,000,000 from Chase '76, Wendy, Steve '12, and Tara '13 Carey to support the renovation of Reid Athletic Center\n\n$9,950,000 to allow for the creation of four new endowed faculty chairs\n\nFrom James E. '65 and Margaret Sue Himoff P'95 for the Himoff Family Chair in Legacies\n\nFrom Becky B. '81 and Christopher T. '81 Hurley P'12,'12 for the Hurley Family Chair in Dialogue, Deliberation, and Decision Making\n\nFrom Nora Gleason Leary '82 and Robert G. Leary for an Endowed Chair in Environmental Studies\n\nFrom Andrew W. Sweet '93 and Alexis Sweet for the Sweet Family Professorship\n\n$5,000,000 from Robert A. '76 and Sydney W. Kindler P'04,'08,'12,'17,'20 to support the Initiative in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation.\n\n$7,200,000 in new gifts to financial aid endowment in support of the Colgate Commitment\n\nFinally, a significant gift to support the restoration and improvements to Oak Drive\n\nIn the strategic session of the Board meetings, President Casey and members of the Cabinet reviewed the Third-Century Plan Status Update. The Board discussed the continued implementation and expansion of the Colgate Commitment; the Olin Hall renovation to create the Robert H. N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative; the construction of the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation; planning for the renovation of the Reid Athletic Center; developing plans for a new performing and visual arts center in the Middle Campus; and new programming in entrepreneurship and innovation. President Casey also discussed with the Board ongoing initiatives relating to data collection and analysis and appropriate resourcing of our Division I athletic programs. Finally, Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Renee Madison shared how she is engaging members of the campus community to develop the next iteration of the DEI Plan with a focus on garnering even more faculty, staff, and student input.\n\nThe Board also had a dedicated DEI session. Renee Madison presented research on how institutions move from being monocultural to multicultural, inclusive organizations. Consultant partner Dr. Cathy Trower then presented the roadmap and expectations for the Board's own diversity and inclusion work. Finally, Dr. Marc Nivet, another consultant partner, provided background on the challenges of complexity in DEI issues and the means through which the Board might improve its own DEI efforts.\n\nThe formal Board meeting formed the last session of the day. The Board approved the tenure and promotion of a number of Colgate faculty members, extending their congratulations to newly promoted faculty colleagues. In addition to the acceptance of gifts to the University noted above, the Board also passed a resolution to approve moving forward with the planning and design of the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation and the renovation of Wynn Hall Research Lab.\n\nThe trustees wished to express their gratitude to all members of the Colgate community for their continued work to maintain the University's academic mission through this pandemic, and wanted to express their great appreciation for all the progress made, even in these challenging times, to meet the ambitions of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Herling '79, P'08,'09,'12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report to Colgate faculty, staff, and students on the just-completed Board of Trustees meeting, which took place May 6–7, 2022, in Hamilton.

The weekend marked an important time in Colgate’s history, as it embarks on the Campaign for the Third Century, a fundraising effort that will support the ambition of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nThe University launched the Campaign for the Third Century with two events in New York City in April, and we will soon share that message with the thousands of alumni, who will soon return to Hamilton for two alumni reunion weekends to be held this June. As part of the Campaign for the Third Century, the Board formally acknowledged and accepted more than $42 million in new gifts, bequests, intentions, and pledges received since its last meeting in January. The following are highlights of those gifts:\n\nMore than $32 million for financial aid endowments and gifts for the Colgate Commitment\n\n$3 million in new gifts for the renovation of Reid Athletic Center\n\n$2.5 million for the creation of a new endowed faculty chair\n\n$2 million in endowment for academic programs\n\nThese gifts demonstrate the momentum of the campaign.\n\nIn the Board’s strategic session, President Casey and members of the Cabinet reviewed many updates to the Third-Century Plan, including progress on the planning for the Robert H. N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Center and the renovation of Olin Hall; plans for the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation, which will break ground in the fall; progress on fundraising for new endowed chairs; and continued improvements to our admission and financial aid programs. Another year of record-breaking applications has the Office of Admission and Financial Aid planning carefully for the Class of 2026 to enroll a target class size of 795. In addition to the acceptance of gifts to the University as noted above, the Board also approved the allocation of $3 million toward the design costs of the Reid renovation. Throughout the strategic session, the Board received updates on the University’s long-term financial model and how third-century plans are aligning with institutional resources.\n\nThe Board dedicated Friday morning to DEI discussions with regard to Board operations and to learning about campus-based DEI efforts.\n\nThe trustees expressed sincere gratitude to the Colgate community for its efforts this past year. Despite the challenges of the pandemic and its aftermath, the University continues to move forward with the initiatives set forth in the Third-Century Plan. The newly launched Campaign for the Third Century will help the University achieve its ambitious goals and transform all aspects of Colgate.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nChair, Board of Trustees\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report to Colgate faculty, staff, and students on the just-completed Board of Trustees meeting, which took place January 28, 2022, via Zoom.\n\nPresident Casey began the series of meeting sessions by sharing some extraordinary campus highlights. First, as has been reported widely, Colgate received over 21,000 applications for the class of 2026, representing 21% growth over last year's record number. In two years, applications to Colgate have increased 146%. Importantly, this year's applicant pool is the most academically talented and most diverse group the admission office has ever seen.\n\nNext, the trustees received reports on Colgate's fundraising efforts over the past few months. The trustees were pleased to hear that year-end fundraising has produced record-breaking results for the University. Since July 1, 2021, the University has received $81 million in new gifts and commitments. At the meeting, the Board formally accepted $49 million in new gifts to Colgate, all received since its October meeting.\n\nAmong the highlights of these new gifts were the following donations to Colgate:\n\n$23,000,000 from Chase '76, Wendy, Steve '12, and Tara '13 Carey to support the renovation of Reid Athletic Center\n\n$9,950,000 to allow for the creation of four new endowed faculty chairs\n\nFrom James E. '65 and Margaret Sue Himoff P'95 for the Himoff Family Chair in Legacies\n\nFrom Becky B. '81 and Christopher T. '81 Hurley P'12,'12 for the Hurley Family Chair in Dialogue, Deliberation, and Decision Making\n\nFrom Nora Gleason Leary '82 and Robert G. Leary for an Endowed Chair in Environmental Studies\n\nFrom Andrew W. Sweet '93 and Alexis Sweet for the Sweet Family Professorship\n\n$5,000,000 from Robert A. '76 and Sydney W. Kindler P'04,'08,'12,'17,'20 to support the Initiative in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation.\n\n$7,200,000 in new gifts to financial aid endowment in support of the Colgate Commitment\n\nFinally, a significant gift to support the restoration and improvements to Oak Drive\n\nIn the strategic session of the Board meetings, President Casey and members of the Cabinet reviewed the Third-Century Plan Status Update. The Board discussed the continued implementation and expansion of the Colgate Commitment; the Olin Hall renovation to create the Robert H. N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative; the construction of the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation; planning for the renovation of the Reid Athletic Center; developing plans for a new performing and visual arts center in the Middle Campus; and new programming in entrepreneurship and innovation. President Casey also discussed with the Board ongoing initiatives relating to data collection and analysis and appropriate resourcing of our Division I athletic programs. Finally, Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Renee Madison shared how she is engaging members of the campus community to develop the next iteration of the DEI Plan with a focus on garnering even more faculty, staff, and student input.\n\nThe Board also had a dedicated DEI session. Renee Madison presented research on how institutions move from being monocultural to multicultural, inclusive organizations. Consultant partner Dr. Cathy Trower then presented the roadmap and expectations for the Board's own diversity and inclusion work. Finally, Dr. Marc Nivet, another consultant partner, provided background on the challenges of complexity in DEI issues and the means through which the Board might improve its own DEI efforts.\n\nThe formal Board meeting formed the last session of the day. The Board approved the tenure and promotion of a number of Colgate faculty members, extending their congratulations to newly promoted faculty colleagues. In addition to the acceptance of gifts to the University noted above, the Board also passed a resolution to approve moving forward with the planning and design of the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation and the renovation of Wynn Hall Research Lab.\n\nThe trustees wished to express their gratitude to all members of the Colgate community for their continued work to maintain the University's academic mission through this pandemic, and wanted to express their great appreciation for all the progress made, even in these challenging times, to meet the ambitions of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Herling '79, P'08,'09,'12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on the recent Board of Trustees meetings that took place Sept. 30 through Oct. 2, 2021. The last time the trustees met on the Colgate campus was Oct. 5, 2019. After two years of Zoom meetings, we were all thankful to be able to meet in person. Like all guests on campus, we followed University event guidelines and all went quite smoothly.\n\nThe Board welcomed several new trustees: Steven N. Cho ’93, P’23, Udayan Das Roy ’04, Yvonne M. Gyimah ’01, Christian B. Johnson ’02, Carlton W. Walker ’10, and Susan L. Becker Gould ’03, who joins the Board as President of the Alumni Council. For Eric J. Andersen ’87, P’16,’23,’23, and Jean-Pierre L. Conte ’85, who joined the Board last year, this weekend’s meetings marked their first in-person meeting in Hamilton. Finally, we welcomed Daniel C. Benton ’80, H’10, P’10, and Christine J. Chao ’86 back to the Board.\n\nThe Board’s Friday morning strategic sessions were dedicated to hearing updates on and discussing the Third-Century Plan. President Casey presented an overview of the University’s progress on the following major initiatives:\n\nAttracting and supporting outstanding students;\n\nAttracting, supporting, and retaining outstanding faculty and staff;\n\nEnsuring diversity, equity, and inclusion;\n\nStarting key academic initiatives, specifically the Initiative in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation (the Middle Campus) and the Initiative in Mind, Brain, and Behavior (Olin Renovation and Ho Center);\n\nEnriching the student experience I: Residential and Social Life;\n\nEnriching the student experience II: Colgate’s Division I Athletics Program;\n\nEnhancing the Village of Hamilton.\n\nTogether, these initiatives will transform Colgate over a long period of time. Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration and Chief Investment Officer JS Hope ’97 and Vice President for Advancement Karl Clauss ’90 provided the Board with an overview of the financial plan to fund these initiatives. They described the funding plan they reviewed with the Endowment Management and Finance Committee of the Board and one that positions Colgate well to execute the Plan over the coming decade. This funding plan involves a combination of substantial fundraising, incremental debt, and operating reserves to provide the necessary resources.\n\nThe Board then heard about plans to keep the campus, alumni, and supporters apprised of the Third-Century Plan and the progress made under these initiatives. It is essential that the wider Colgate community stay informed about all that we seek to do over the next several years.\n\nThirteen student leaders nominated by deans, vice presidents, faculty, and other staff members then joined the trustees for lunch discussions. Representing the Student Government Association and elected class officers, the Links staff, Student Athlete Advisory Council, Maroon-News editors, and SORT leaders (among others), the students shared with the trustees their Colgate stories, current academic plans, and plans following graduation.\n\nAfter lunch, the trustees participated in its first dedicated diversity, equity, and inclusion engagement program, which was led by DEI consultants Dr. Cathy Trower and Dr. Marc Nivet. In the summer of 2020, the Board moved forward on a number of DEI initiatives, including increasing the number of trustees in order to expand the diversity of the Board faster than normal turnover of trustees would allow, creating an Ad Hoc DEI Committee to help focus DEI issues across all the Board committees, and developing a DEI Board engagement program to strengthen the Board’s governance and oversight functions. Through this work, the Board will improve its culture and decision-making framework by becoming a more diverse and inclusive group that makes smarter and better decisions.\n\nFollowing the DEI engagement program, Professor Lesleigh Cushing and Professor Lynn Schwarzer guided one group of trustees on a tour of the Middle Campus, while Vice President and Director of Athletics Nicki Moore and Vice President and Dean of the College Paul McLoughlin guided another group through the Reid and Lower Campus Project. Both tours provided the trustees with insights into the challenges and opportunities of our current capital planning in these parts of campus. With this background, the Board’s programmatic committees are better equipped to discuss and engage in the long-term planning process that includes not only capital projects but also programmatic needs.\n\nFriday ended with a reception with the members of the Task Force on Reopening and the Task Force on Remote Learning. The trustees were pleased to meet many of the people who helped, and continue to assist, Colgate’s efforts to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 public health crisis.\n\nAt the formal Board meeting on Saturday morning, the Board took a series of formal actions, including the approval of faculty appointments and the approval of a revised Fiscal Year 2021–22 endowment spending rate.\n\nNext, an additional $3 million was approved toward the planning and design costs for the renovation of Olin Hall. The total project development costs of $5 million, which the Board has now approved, are funded entirely from donor contributions.\n\nIn addition, the Board acknowledged donors who made gifts and commitments over $1,000,000, and these new gifts and commitments total $30,700,000 to the University:\n\n$10,000,000 to replace Gatehouse and build the first residence hall of the Fifth Residential Commons;\n\n$6,000,000 in revocable bequest intentions;\n\n$5,500,000 for the renewal and restoration of Seven Oaks Golf Course and Clubhouse;\n\n$5,200,000 in support of the Colgate Commitment;\n\n$2,500,000 to endow the director of First@Colgate and First@Colgate programming, DEI programming, and the Colgate Fund;\n\n$1,500,000 to endow the director of Career Services.\n\nThe Board also acknowledged the 43-year career of Thomas O’Neill, Associate Vice President and Controller, and thanked him for his exemplary service to Colgate.\n\nIn the executive session, the Board discussed the tremendous efforts and leadership of President Casey and his cabinet during these challenging times. The Board passed a resolution of deepest gratitude and appreciation for the outstanding work of this team in guiding the University through the pandemic while continuing to drive the execution of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nThe trustees were excited by the progress made toward the Third-Century Plan and the work of the faculty and the administration to keep strengthening the University even as we continue to navigate the long-term effects of the global pandemic.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on two meetings of the Board of Trustees: a special meeting dedicated to the University’s DEI efforts on March 24, 2021 and the final Board meeting of the academic year, which took place May 1–2, 2021, and both meetings were conducted remotely via Zoom.\n\nThe March 24 Special Board Meeting on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nThe Board convened a special meeting to review the University’s DEI Plan, the status of key initiatives and planning for the continual update to the plan, as well as the work of the newly-formed Board ad hoc DEI Committee. Trustee Emeriti Daniel C. Benton ’80, H’10, P’10, Christine J. Chao ’86, and H. Leroy Cody Jr. ’71 also attended. The meeting was led by ad hoc DEI Committee Chair Giovanni Cutaia ’94 and Vice Chair Clarissa V. Shah ’10. President Casey provided the Board with the framing context of the development of the DEI Plan, which was based on an external evaluation of the campus climate and the work of a campus-based task force of more than 70 faculty and staff.\n\nThe administration provided a summary of the current structures in place on campus to address DEI concerns and plans, specifically the DEI Advisory Group and the DEI Coordination Group. The trustees received an update on the search for a Chief Diversity Officer “CDO” and the work of the Acting Chief Diversity Officer, Laura Jack.\n\nThe bulk of the meeting focused on the Board’s ongoing work to address DEI matters impacting the Board and its work. The Board discussed future Board DEI initiatives, including the electing of trustees with more diverse backgrounds, developing an ongoing engagement process for the Board to address DEI matters with a focus on building a Board culture and processes that address continuous improvement in this area. This summer, the Board will begin to work with a consultant to facilitate engagement on DEI matters. The Board also discussed the expansion of the size of the Board for a period of time to allow for an increase in Board diversity.\n\nThese actions were discussed further at the May Board meeting and are described below.\n\nThe May 1–2 Board Meeting\n\nTrustee Emeriti Daniel C. Benton ’80, H’10, P’10 and Christine J. Chao ’86 were in attendance at the May meetings. The administration provided updates on the admissions of the Colgate Class of 2025, preparations for the fall 2021 semester, and the FY21 budget. The Acting CDO Laura Jack briefed the Board on the status of the CDO search as well as some DEI updates from campus, including Colgate’s membership in LACRELA, the Graduate School Access Fund, which was generously supported by trustee Giovanni Cutaia ’94, and his wife, Maree, and the Alumni Council’s creation of a new DEI position on its executive committee.\n\nThe trustees received an update from President Casey on the initiatives that are part of the University’s Third-Century Plan. The trustees were enthusiastic about the level of planning that has continued on the campus and have asked the administration to finalize plans for, 1) the Olin Hall addition and renovation as part of the Robert H. N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative and; 2) the Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation as part of the Initiative in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation. The trustees also called on the administration to continue developing plans for the renovation of the Dana Arts Center as part of the development of the Middle Campus.\n\nFurther, the trustees were excited about the continuing development of plans to significantly enhance student residential life both up the hill and along Broad Street, as the University seeks to continue the full development of the Residential Commons system. The Board reviewed preliminary plans for the enhancement of housing for juniors and seniors along Broad Street and College Street that involve a true transformation of the entire upper class residential, dining and social experience. The Board approved significant funding for the continuing efforts to complete plans for this project, which the Board hopes to embark on as funds and other resources become available. With these residential life initiatives, the Board remains committed to ensuring that Colgate’s residential life system provides a greater sense of inclusion and belonging for all Colgate students.\n\nFinally, and as a significant part of the entire transformative vision for Colgate under The Third-Century Plan, the Board endorsed and enthusiastically backed, a new and significant financial aid initiative that will be announced to the entire Colgate community on June 1, 2021.\n\nIn short, the Board was pleased to see such ambitious planning for Colgate’s future while the University was navigating its pandemic response. The trustees look forward to working with campus groups as we continue to pursue the transformative vision for Colgate detailed in The Third-Century Plan.\n\nBoard Actions\n\nThe Board approved a number of recommendations regarding faculty, most notably the appointment of two new endowed chairs. Timothy Byrnes, Charles A. Dana Professor of Political Science, will become the Third-Century Chair in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics and DeWitt Godfrey, Professor of Art and Art History, will become the Peter L. and Maria T. Kellner Endowed Chair in the Arts, Creativity, and Innovation. The creation of new endowed chairs is an important Third-Century Plan initiative.\n\nThe University continued its capital planning despite the challenges of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board approved three capital projects that are priorities of The Third-Century Plan. First, $2 million was allocated toward residential life planning. Second, $1.5 million was approved toward renovating the Chenango Nursery School. Finally, the Board approved the beginning of the renovation of the Seven Oaks Clubhouse and Golf Course. This $9.5 million project is entirely donor-funded. The Board also approved the FY22 budget.\n\nBoard actions also included the election of officers. I will be serving as Board Chair for a term of three years. Gretchen H. Burke ’81, P’11,’20, Gus P. Coldebella ’91, and Jeanne A. Follansbee ’78, P’08 will serve as vice chairs for a term of one-year. The Board also recognized the service of four retiring trustees: Celia A. Colbert P’14, Thomas W. Dempsey Jr. ’72, Sonya A. Falcone ’12, and John A. Hayes ’88, P’19.\n\nFinally, as part of the University’s DEI efforts, the Board voted formally to expand the number of trustees in order to diversify its membership faster than the normal turnover would allow. The New York State Board of Regents approved Colgate’s request to expand the Board from 35 to 38 members in March. The Nominating, Governance, and Trustee Development Committee worked throughout the year to identify new trustees to start their terms in fall 2021 and fall 2022. I am pleased to report that Daniel C. Benton ’80, H’10, P’10 and Christine J. Chao ’86 will be returning to the Board in fall 2021. Joining them will be Steven N. Cho ’93, P’23, Udayan Das Roy ’04, Yvonne M. Gyimah ’01, Christian B. Johnson ’02, and Carlton W. Walker ’10. In addition, the Board elected Garfield O. A. Smith ’85 and Clarissa V. Shah ’10 to be the cohort of new trustees starting in fall 2022.\n\nAcknowledgement of Gifts\n\nIn an ongoing effort to recognize the arrival of contributions of $1 million or more in support of The Third-Century Plan, I am pleased to announce the following gifts.\n\nFirst, Colgate computer science emeriti faculty members Thomas and Elizabeth Brackett, who received honorary degrees from Colgate in 2015, generously contributed $1 million to endow a fund that will provide permanent support to Colgate’s Computer Science Department, with a focus on advancing DEI initiatives. This gift represents the largest single contribution by a Colgate faculty member.\n\nSecond, former Board Chair Denis F. Cronin ’69, H’16, P’09,’10, and his wife, Linda, made a generous year-end contribution of $1.5 million, which is yet to be designated.\n\nFinally, I want to recognize a generous $1 million contribution prior to the close of the calendar year from trustee Brion B. Applegate ’76, representing an additional investment in a special scholarship endowment honoring the memory of his mother, Ruth C. Applegate, in support of student athletes.\n\nLastly, the Board recognizes what an incredible year it has been for the entire Colgate community. We are grateful to end the year with a celebration of the Class of 2021. As we honor and recognize the Class of 2021, we look forward to the moment when the entire Colgate community can gather again on our beautiful campus.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08, ’09, ’12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on the Board of Trustees meeting, which took place January 29–30, 2021, via Zoom. Two emeriti trustees, Christine J. Chao ’86 and Daniel C. Benton ’80, P’10, H’10, were also in attendance.\n\nPresident Casey began the series of meetings by sharing two extraordinary campus highlights. First, applications for the Class of 2025 grew by more than 102% compared to last year. This year’s applicant pool is the most academically talented and most diverse group the Admission Office has ever seen. Second, the Colgate Together Challenge closed out the 2020 calendar year and provided record-breaking results for the Colgate Fund.\n\nPresident Casey then walked the Board through the long-term frame of The Third-Century Plan. We heard updates on 1) the development of The Initiative in the Arts, Creativity, and Innovation; 2) progress on The Robert H.N. Ho Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative; 3) plans for completion of the residential life system “up the hill” for first- and second-year students and initial plans for a comprehensive residential life system “down the hill” for juniors and seniors; and 4) progress in establishing priorities for renovation of athletics facilities. All of this planning (and other work on priorities and initiatives in The Third-Century Plan) is going on in parallel with planning on an impending comprehensive campaign, and the Board learned about the continuing research being done by Grenzebach Glier and Associates, Inc. toward a feasibility study, which will form a multiyear campaign. Campaign co-chairs Gretchen H. Burke ’81, P’11,’20 and Christine Chao reported on their efforts engaging donors, who have been participating in Zoom meetings about The Third-Century Plan and more focused Zoom meetings dedicated to specific initiatives. Overall, the Board is confident in Colgate’s ability and readiness to launch the campaign in the coming year.\n\nA highlight of the strategic session was the announcement of Dan Benton’s transformational $25 million gift to support The Initiative for the Arts, Creativity, and Innovation. His gift will enable the University to construct The Benton Center for Creativity and Innovation, which will be a hub for interdepartmental collaboration and experimentation. As the first capital gift toward The Initiative for the Arts, Creativity, and Innovation, Dan Benton’s generosity begins the plan to energize the area of campus from the Dana Arts Center to the Case Library and Geyer Center for Information Technology, collectively known as Middle Campus.\n\nThe Board continued discussion of and progress toward goals of The Third-Century Plan during the formal Board meeting. The Board passed a resolution to approve moving forward with the design of the Olin Hall renovations by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, LLP. It also accepted the creation of two new endowed chairs from Peter L. Kellner ’65 and his family. The chairs — the Third-Century Chair in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics and the Peter L. and Maria T. Kellner Chair in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation — move Colgate closer to the goal of 25 new endowed chairs as part of The Third-Century Plan.\n\nA final Board action set the endowment spending rule for the coming fiscal year. The Colgate endowment has surpassed $1.1 billion, and in recent years, Colgate has been conservative in its draw from the endowment in order to align with its draw policy rules. Recent endowment performance and these conservative practices now allow Colgate to increase the spending rule, providing additional funds to the operating budget to support Third-Century Plan initiatives.\n\nFinally, the Board wants to acknowledge and thank the faculty and staff who have worked so hard to reopen campus successfully. Despite the challenges of the current academic year, the Board is impressed and enthused by the efforts being made toward planning for Colgate’s third century.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nI write to report on the Board of Trustees meeting, which took place Saturday, September 26, via Zoom, with two new Board members: Eric J. Andersen ’87, P’16,’23,’23 and Jean-Pierre L. Conte ’85. Also in attendance were two emeriti trustees: Christine J. Chao ’86 and Daniel C. Benton ’80, H’10, P’10. In the strategic sessions, the Board focused on four key topics: an update on Colgate’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, planning to move forward with the initial Third-Century Plan initiatives over the next several years, fundraising and campaign planning, and recent college and university rankings.\n\nThe Board heard reports regarding operations on campus in the COVID-19 environment. Vice President and Dean of the College Paul McLoughlin shared information and insights regarding the University’s testing regimes, the data analysis provided by the Health Analytics Team, challenges faced by the Dean of the College division during this extraordinary time, and the challenges faced by our students and their resiliency through these difficult times. Provost and Dean of the Faculty Tracey Hucks provided information about current semester instruction, new and modified teaching spaces, and the creativity of faculty in shifting all courses offered this semester to hybrid teaching modalities. Finally, Senior Vice President Joseph Hope outlined the state of the current operating budget given the extraordinary expenditures required to execute on our plan to keep Colgate open this year. Since the University has exhausted half of the COVID-19 contingency that was built into our budget, we will need to remain fiscally conservative in ongoing expenditures due to the uncertainty in the coming months.\n\nWhile campus has been rightfully focused on current operations during these challenging times, the Board considered and endorsed continuing with planning for future capital projects associated with The Third-Century Plan. Colgate started calendar year 2020 with great optimism and momentum regarding the renovating of Olin Hall for the Robert H.N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative, continued planning on the first few building projects associated with the Middle Campus, reimagining residences and social spaces along Broad Street, and considering enhancements to athletic facilities. Much work and effort have been invested in planning for these projects, and the Board endorsed ongoing planning efforts with respect to all of these projects so that the University is ready to move forward when fiscal resources become available.\n\nThe Board was pleased to welcome Karl Clauss ’90 as the new Vice President for the Office of Advancement and Trustee Emerita Christine Chao as the new co-chair of the Campaign Leadership Committee. Co-Chairs Gretchen H. Burke ’81, P’11,’20 and Christine Chao reported on the anticipated resumption of small-group briefings with key alumni and parent leaders regarding campaign priorities and donor analysis. The result of this work will be a formal campaign feasibility study, which will provide the University with the information needed to launch the multi-year campaign. The Campaign Leadership Committee will resume its work in earnest in October.\n\nFinally, the Board reviewed Colgate’s position in the recent U.S. News and World Report (USNWR) and Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education (WSJ/THE) rankings. A preliminary analysis of USNWR rankings (Colgate #20) revealed several areas of possible focus for improvement, including two key factors that Colgate should examine further as it seeks to increase its reach and reputation: 1) the University’s overall financial resources and expenditures per student, and 2) “social mobility,” defined by the publication as the ability of an institution to see all students move toward degree completion. Colgate fared quite well in the WSJ/THE ranking: coming in 50th overall (in a combined university and college ranking) and 12th among private liberal arts colleges. The administration will delve more deeply into the USNWR factors and conduct continued analysis of the WSJ/THE rankings.\n\nDuring the formal Board meeting, the trustees approved a resolution to award emeritus status posthumously to Professor Bruce W. Selleck ’71 in recognition of his many years of dedicated and unwavering service to Colgate. The Board also approved a resolution to renovate Chenango Nursery School. The chairs of the Board’s four programmatic committees (Academic Mission and Programs, Campus Life and Programs, University Outreach, and University Resources) provided brief reports of their upcoming work in the coming year. The Board also heard an update from the new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee.\n\nFour community groups addressed the Board during the annual community time. Director of Sustainability John Pumilio and Sustainability Intern Jaanvi Sachdeva ’21 discussed the strong history of sustainability at Colgate and current programs. Helen Ferguson ’21 and Sofia Perez-Dietz ’21 shared the work and goals of the Medusa Movement. Jailekha Zutshi ’21 described various aspects of the international student experience, and she joined Jake Gomez ’21 in a discussion on the Konosioni Senior Honor Society’s name. The Board thanks these community members for their excellent presentations.\n\nFinally, Colgate has been able to reopen this fall only because of the dedication of our faculty and staff. The long days of hard work that the campus community has put in since March set the foundation for the resumed Colgate experience this fall, and the careful management of expenditures has provided the financial safety net that allowed the University to implement new public health measures, adjust teaching, and support students through a series of challenging transitions.\n\nThe University still has a long way to go if we are to complete a successful academic year in the midst of a pandemic, but at this moment, the Board of Trustees and I wish to express our profound admiration and gratitude for what Colgate's faculty and staff have accomplished. Accordingly, the Board passed this resolution of heartfelt thanks and appreciation.\n\nWe thank you for your work, your financial prudence, your commitment to our mission, and for everything you will do to help the University move forward in the months ahead.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nOn Thursday, June 18, 2020, the Colgate Board of Trustees convened for a special meeting to address two important topics: the University’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our plans for reopening to in-person education this fall, and Colgate’s plans regarding race and equity and the actions needed to fight ignorance and hatred to become a more equitable and inclusive campus community.\n\nReopening the Colgate Campus\n\nThe Board reviewed and discussed recommendations from the Presidential Task Force on the Reopening of the Colgate Campus. As mentioned in President Casey’s statement to the Colgate community, distributed yesterday, the Task Force made comprehensive, science-based recommendations to promote reopening of campus to full in-person operations for the fall semester, consistent with CDC and New York State guidance. The Board offered its thoughts on the recommendations to President Casey and considered the actions and investments necessary to address those recommendations and to meet the requirements of campus operations for the 2020–21 academic year. The Board wholeheartedly endorsed the Task Force’s recommendations and committed to provide the resources necessary to enable the administration to achieve the milestones set forth in the report. The Board was extremely grateful for the hard work undertaken by the Task Force.\n\nBut it was not just the Task Force that put in extra time over the past few months. The Board truly appreciates all the hard work of the faculty and staff throughout this past academic year and as we enter this summer. Your efforts have been thoughtful, comprehensive, and sensitive to the needs of the entire Colgate community. We also applaud the resilience and determination of our students, who made an otherwise difficult semester successful and rewarding. Every member of this community has had to adjust — often at a moment’s notice — to rapidly changing circumstances and to changed financial conditions.\n\nThe Board also heard a report on the University’s continuing financial circumstances and applauded all efforts that allowed the University to balance the 2019–20 operating budget. These actions, combined with the University’s adherence to sound financial practices, has placed Colgate on a solid foundation as we continue to pursue our mission during these extraordinary times.\n\nAddressing Racial Inequity\n\nThe Board spent more than half of this special meeting reviewing and considering the University’s ongoing plans to address racial inequity at Colgate and to support all members of our community. This was an important, constructive, and sometimes difficult discussion about an area in which Colgate must do better to fulfill our mission at the highest level and live by the values that we hold dear.\n\nThe Board praised and endorsed President Casey’s May 31 statement and strongly affirmed the sentiments he expressed in his letter to the Maroon-News, especially the creation of The Colgate History Project to address the justifiable calls to action from students and alumni. That effort is especially admirable because it applies a liberal arts approach to understanding Colgate’s own record on race: while we cannot change the past, by better understanding it we can improve the campus climate for students, faculty, and staff, both now and in the future.\n\nThe Board also reaffirmed its commitment to the University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan. This DEI Plan was the product of more than two years of work, involving dozens of faculty and staff members and was created after multiple campus and Board discussions. Soon after the announcement of this plan, the Board created an ad hoc Board Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to engage the Board in the work of the DEI Plan and to help support change on our campus.\n\nThe Board firmly believes that steps outlined in the plan will help allow Colgate to become a more inclusive and equitable institution. The DEI Plan shows what can be accomplished when the University adheres to its core values and practices: creating a shared vision through rigorous debate and careful deliberation. We are at our best when we bring a diverse set of opinions, skills, and talents to bear on the creation of a path forward. This work has and must continue to involve all of us — faculty, staff, alumni, students, and trustees — and must not rest on the shoulders of Colgate’s community of color. That work is more important now than ever before.\n\nThe Board urged the administration to integrate the DEI Plan more fully into Colgate’s Third-Century Plan. The Board further made clear its commitment to provide the resources necessary to achieve the DEI Plan’s objectives, including supporting the search for a Chief Diversity Officer, identifying physical space on campus for DEI offices, and addressing — within the context of a comprehensive planning effort — access and availability of student residential and social spaces on Broad Street, especially for students of color. While a comprehensive plan for Broad Street is still in development, clearly some interventions will be needed. The Board directed the administration to move forward with this planning and begin to provide tangible short- and long-term recommendations to address these issues.\n\nThe past weeks have revealed the work that each of us, as individuals, needs to do to understand our own biases and to recognize how racism negatively impacts our community and harms its members. Toward that end, the trustees will engage in diversity and unconscious bias training throughout the coming year and in the future and will focus on improving the diversity of Board membership.\n\nBecause freedom of expression and academic freedom are intimately connected to diversity and inclusion, the Board also discussed and reinforced its commitment to the principles set out in the report issued by Colgate’s Task Force on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression, a very thoughtful and diverse group of faculty, students, trustees, and administrators, in 2018. In particular, the Board reaffirmed Colgate’s commitment to freedom of expression and the Task Force report urging that “free expression is more powerful when we, as members of [the Colgate] community, consider the perspectives of the people with whom we are communicating and when we approach discussion and debate with a spirit of humility, generosity, and care.”\n\nSince our meeting, we have learned of racially insensitive videos that have been posted on social media by members of the Colgate community and, in one case, by a student who had been admitted to Colgate for this coming fall. These situations have been or will be dealt with through the processes and based on the principles that Colgate has established for such incidents.\n\nOn a personal level, I find these social media posts to be deplorable and not consistent with the values of the Colgate community, and I applaud the actions the University took immediately after these videos came to be known. As with all these cases, it is important to note we must proceed here thoughtfully and with due deliberation. The Task Force on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression urged us all to commit ourselves both to Colgate’s community values and to the principles of freedom of expression and academic freedom, recognizing that our commitment to freedom of expression and inquiry will occasionally come into conflict with certain of our shared values. The Task Force noted that “[f]reedom of expression should not be stifled in service of other values; however, while this freedom must be defended, the Task Force urges all of us to cultivate by example the values of the Colgate community.” We all should be mindful that freedom of expression exercised without considering our community values can cause harm to our community. I hope all members of our Colgate community will reflect on this and will take it to heart.\n\nThe past three months have been challenging in a variety of ways. The coming months will continue to test our strength, abilities, and resilience. I have confidence in our community’s ability to face the coming months with the same grace and care that it has so recently demonstrated. Thank you for your part in helping Colgate through these challenging times. I remain optimistic that, through our work together, we can emerge an even stronger University, one dedicated to its highest principles and its mission of teaching, learning, and inclusivity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMike Herling\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, I write to provide you with a summary of the May 2, 2020, Board meeting. Our meeting was held in an online format at an extraordinary time for Colgate and the world. Before reporting on board actions, I want to acknowledge the remarkable effort by our faculty and staff during the past several weeks. Faculty retooled hundreds of courses for remote instruction. Since January, the 55 members of Colgate’s Emergency Operations Center helped steer the University’s COVID-19 response in operations and logistics. Many of you worked from home while homeschooling your children. The campus community cared for the approximately 250 students who stayed on campus. And faculty and administrators are now planning a robust academic year for 2020–21. The Board thanks the entire Colgate community for taking such great care of our students and our community and being so thoughtful about our future.\n\nThe Board began the year with momentum and excitement to continue the work set forth in The Third-Century Plan. While the COVID-19 pandemic has no doubt affected the pace at which we will achieve our ambitious goals, the Plan continues to guide our future. In fact, the Plan and the guiding principles underlying it have formed the basis for the Board to establish priorities for Colgate at this uncertain time. Below, I report that, despite the current crisis, we continue to move forward with key elements of the plan.\n\nUnlike past Board meetings that included committee meetings, we spent our entire time meeting as a full board. The May 2 meeting focused on the University’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the plan forward to the 2020–2021 academic and fiscal year. After a summary of the response since March 13, when students left campus, the Board reviewed the fiscal implications of the emergency on the current year’s operating budget. Conservative operational practices established more than a decade ago ensured that Colgate’s cash management could withstand the sudden shock to the final months of the fiscal year. This means that the institution continues to meet all of its obligations with substantial cushion; it also had enough liquidity to provide a 50% refund on room and board charges to our students.\n\nThe refunds of room and board and additional technology costs to move hundreds of courses online created a potential deficit of approximately $8–$10 million for the current academic year. Thankfully, on-campus efforts at cost savings and the structural surplus that we had built into the budget will allow the closing of this operating budget gap without drastic action. The Board thanks all faculty and staff for their efforts to help ensure that FY2020–21 operating budget will not be burdened with a deficit.\n\nThe Board also received updates on the University’s endowment. I am happy to report that Colgate’s endowment has withstood well the financial shock of the past few months with manageable declines. The endowment reached an all-time high of $959 million at the end of January. In February, when equity markets started to see significant declines, the endowment performed very well with a decline of only 2% compared to the S&P, which lost more than 8%. In March, the endowment declined about 6% as compared to the S&P with a decline of more than 12%. For the first quarter, the endowment declined to a value of $872 million, which was an investment decline of 8%. The S&P declined by 19% in the first quarter. From peak to the trough, which occurred mid-March, the S&P lost more than 33% compared to University endowment losses of approximately 10%. The Board is very pleased with the management and performance of our endowment, which continues to produce very strong risk-adjusted outcomes.\n\nThe Board then considered plans for FY2020–21 — specifically, the return to classroom teaching and the budget implications for various scenarios. Dean of the Faculty Tracey Hucks and Associate Dean Lesleigh Cushing informed the Board about the developing academic plan, and the Board appreciated the thoughtfulness in creating a plan that mitigated against many risks and conditions that are currently not known. The Board acknowledged that the current plan calls for instruction to commence in late August but accounts for multiple potentialities, including a return to normal instruction in August, or, if circumstances do not fully permit that, partial remote instruction in the fall or to a return to normal classroom instruction in the spring. The plan’s commitment to ensuring the continuation of a full Colgate educational experience from off-campus study programs, student research, and FSEMs are principles as is the commitment to ensuring students could progress toward degree completion. Our clear desire, in service of our mission and our strengths, is to return to normal in-person operations as swiftly as circumstances and safety permit, and Colgate is working diligently to achieve this. The Board thanks the faculty for their thoughtful deliberations and planning work.\n\nThe academic plan feeds directly into the FY2020–21 operating budget. Senior Vice President JS Hope then presented potential budget scenarios, given this plan and other factors, which are still very uncertain. The Board is, however, aware that many variables in the current budget likely will change in the coming weeks and months. We are planning a special meeting of the Board in July, when more factors are certain. The Board commends the administration for its continual modeling, thus preparing for multiple eventualities and thoughtful, well-informed decision making.\n\nThe Board reviewed a new model for capital planning, which focused on high-priority projects not requiring significant or new resources (Hamilton Housing, Collection Annex, Frank Dining Hall, and Chenango Nursery School) and projects that will require meaningful investment over the near-term and that align with the goals of The Third-Century Plan (Olin Hall renovation, Gatehouse replacement, Dana renovation, and Broad Street planning). Other projects, such as new buildings in the Middle Campus and the development of West Campus, will resume when resources are available. Again, the Plan provided guidance in making these shifts to the capital planning.\n\nAmong its formal actions, the Board was pleased to establish four new endowed faculty chairs:\n\nDaniel C. Benton ’80 Endowed Chair in Arts, Creativity, and Innovation\n\nRebecca C. Chopp Chair in the Humanities\n\nCarl Benton Straub ’58 Endowed Chair in Culture and Environment\n\nW. Bradford Wiley Chair in International Economics Endowed Fund II\n\nThe creation of these endowed positions demonstrates that, despite the current crisis, work of The Third-Century Plan continues.\n\nThe Board will welcome two new members, JP Conte ’85 and Eric Andersen ’87, P '16, '23, '23 in the fall, and approved the addition of Gretchen Burke ’81, P’11,’20 as a board vice chair, with responsibility for oversight of the campaign. The Board meeting acknowledged three retiring trustees: Dan Benton ’80, P’10, H’10; Christine Chao ’86; and Leroy Cody ’71. Between them, they represent 36 years of dedicated and exemplary service to Colgate. While we will miss them on the Board, we look forward to their continued engagement and leadership on the Emeriti Council.\n\nFinally, and with great pleasure, the Board is pleased to announce that President Brian W. Casey’s contract has been extended for five years by a unanimous and enthusiastic vote of the Board. At this critical moment in history, it is important to have his steady and caring leadership continue. Brian’s love for this University and his dynamic leadership have served Colgate well, and they will serve us well for many years to come.\n\nAs mentioned numerous times above, the Board is immensely grateful to the administration, faculty, and staff, who have worked tirelessly to help Colgate not only weather the current crisis but also prepare for an uncertain future. This is not the first time Colgate has been tested; it survived world wars, the Depression, and numerous economic crises. At each of these inflection points, Colgate emerged stronger, though changed. The coming months and year will challenge us in ways unknown, and I have faith in the Colgate community to see us through the uncertainty.\n\nTake care, stay safe, and be well.\n\nMike Herling, ’79, P’08,’09,’12\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, I write to provide a summary of the\n\nJanuary 24–25, 2020, Board meeting, which took place in New York City. The momentum and energy of the October meeting extended to the January meeting, as the agenda reflected progress made since hiring a campus planner to assist with the complexity and the integration of emerging capital projects with programmatic goals. The meeting began with presentations from Professor Douglas Johnson, associate dean of the faculty; Professor Lesleigh Cushing, Murray W. and Mildred K. Finard Professor in Jewish studies and associate dean of the faculty; and Vice President and Athletic Director Nicki Moore.\n\nProfessor Johnson provided an overview of the Robert H.N. Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative (MBB), explaining some of the programmatic features, including: the intellectual foundations for MBB, cross-departmental research opportunities, and student-faculty research. The initiative builds on Colgate’s existing strengths, especially in student and faculty research and the securing of outside grants. MBB will improve Colgate’s ability to attract and retain the best faculty, expand opportunities for students to conduct research with faculty, and enhance research in numerous departments.\n\nProfessor Cushing provided the Board a comprehensive understanding of the Arts, Creativity, and Innovation Initiative, a comprehensive intellectual program that will connect a number of growing academic units — most notably computer science and film and media studies — to the arts. The work of the Middle Campus Working Group and Users Group identified four intellectual blocks that will occupy Middle Campus. First, a Center for Arts, Creativity, and Technology builds on existing strengths in digital creativity. Second, a renovated Dana Center for Curricular and Co-Curricular Innovation and Design combines various design modes, co-locates entrepreneurial activities including TIA, and provides makerspaces for faculty and students. Third, University Collections and Materials Labs will integrate object-based learning across the disciplines. Finally, a Center for Music and Culture will explore music, performance, and cultural artifacts.\n\nVice President Moore outlined the capital planning priorities for Physical Education, Recreation, and Athletics. The objective of the capital planning efforts is to develop a plan to transform what we are now calling West Campus into a space that supports championship-level Division I Athletics, recreational sports, and the overall Colgate student experience. The first priorities, to be completed in two to five years, include a New Athletic Center at the site of Starr Rink and improved grounds and circulation in West Campus. The New Athletic Center will house a competition arena for multiple sports, a health and performance center, multiple gathering spaces, all while creating an improved southern entrance to West Campus and Colgate. In five to ten years, the second priorities are proposed upgrades to Andy Kerr Stadium and other facility improvements.\n\nWith a clearer understanding of the programmatic elements connected with each of these initiatives, RAMSA/WXY, the planners hired soon after the October board meeting, and Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates (MVVA), the landscape design firm looking at the campus experience, presented initial ideas on the physical manifestation of these three programs and the connections among them.\n\nThe Board enthusiastically approved the direction of planning presented by the administration and the vision for the campus presented by RAMSA/WXY and MVVA. The Board also reviewed a five-year capital financing plan that showed the funding and expected timing for capital projects in the coming years. (In the coming months leading into its May meeting, the Board will work with the administration to continue refining project plans with the expectation of announcing first steps for all these initiatives in May.) The Board also endorsed the emerging plans for the creation of additional housing and other investments in the village and looks forward to the further development of these proposals.\n\nAt the formal Board meeting on Saturday morning, the Board approved faculty appointments and the fiscal year 2020–2021 endowment spending guidelines. The Board also acknowledged receipt of more than $6,000,000 in gifts since the October 2019 meeting.\n\nThe Board is grateful to the administration, faculty, and staff who are working hard to implement the first initiatives of The Third-Century Plan. There has been tremendous momentum from last year through the fall and January meetings, and we look forward to even more progress by the May meeting.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79\n\nBoard Chair\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, I write to provide highlights of the October 4–5, 2019 Board meeting, which took place in Hamilton. The meeting was the first of the new Board Leadership team, which includes Gus P. Coldebella ’91 and Jeanne A. Follansbee ’78, P’08 as new vice-chairs. With the newly approved and endorsed Third-Century Plan, the Board is energized to work with campus bodies to implement the initiatives outlined in the Plan and monitor our progress.\n\nTo help with the complexity and integration of our emerging physical campus planning requirements, we will hire a campus planner to assist with capital planning for the Arts, Creativity, and Innovation initiatives (the Middle Campus), the Broad Street Neighborhood, Athletics, and overall parking and circulation across campus. Accordingly, members of the Board, President Casey, Provost Hucks, Dean McLoughlin, and Professor Padma Kaimal, as chair of the University Property Committee, reviewed proposals from and met with planning firms during the weekend. The Board intends to select a planning firm by mid-October, and expects this firm to help Colgate with the identification of the first buildings in the Middle Campus, a review of the current Olin renovation plans, and conceptual designs for long-term Broad Street and athletics facilities enhancements.\n\nThe Board reviewed long-term financial models that provided a comprehensive view of how the initiatives of the Third-Century Plan will be funded, and they considered details of how new programmatic costs may affect future operating budgets. While these models are still being refined, they are critical to future planning and will help guide the work of the campus, the campus-based Advisory and Planning Committee, and the work of the Board itself. It is deeply important that resources are carefully allocated in service of the Plan’s priorities so that Colgate achieves meaningful enhancements in the key areas of our University enterprise.\n\nDuring the Board meeting, Trustee Gretchen Burke gave a presentation about the current status of our fundraising efforts, our initial priorities for fundraising, and next steps in this multi-year campaign. Fundraising and the campaign will be critical to achieving the goals of the Plan, and I am grateful to Gretchen for her leadership of the Campaign Leadership Committee.\n\nTwo community members addressed the Board. Anne Getz Eidelhoch ’20 proposed a scholarship to further the connection between Colgate and its surrounding community, especially the Indigenous people of upstate New York. Professor Ferdinand von Muench asked the trustees to keep fundamental issues of social justice and the well-being of body, mind, and environment in their minds and hearts as the Board works on shaping Colgate’s future in its next century. I would like to thank these community members for their presentations.\n\nFormally, during the Board’s meeting on Saturday, the trustees approved faculty appointments, and gratefully acknowledged the gift of property that allows the University to begin work on the Hamilton Housing Plan as part of Section IV of the Third-Century Plan.\n\nBoard members enjoyed interacting with numerous members of the Colgate community throughout their time on campus. They had lunch with 10 members of the Student Government Association, which submitted its own report to the Board. With members of the Admission Office and others, the Board gathered to celebrate Robert ’72 and Debra Jones who generously established the Jones and Wood Family Vice President for Admission and Financial Aid, a position held by Gary L. Ross ’77. Many Board members attended the Hall of Honor reception, which preceded the induction of 10 men and women into the Hall. The Hall of Honor 2019 Class included former Chair of Colgate’s Board of Trustees Daniel B. Hurwitz ’86. Finally, the Board enjoyed dinner with 13 current and former faculty members of the Advisory and Planning Committee.\n\nThe Board also welcomed eight new trustees: Patricia Apelian Aitken ’76, Brion B. Applegate ’76, Melissa J. Coley ’79, Giovanni Cutaia ’94, Kimberly Huffard ’87, Amy Vullo MacMillan ’83, Clarissa V. Shah ’10, and Jeffrey W. Sharp ’89. As the new president of the Alumni Council, Christian B. Johnson ’02 also joined the Board.\n\nWe are all very excited to implement the initiatives of the Third-Century Plan, and the weekend demonstrated the Board’s desire to work with campus colleagues to move toward their swift implementation. With President Casey’s leadership and his team’s level of commitment, we are confident that we can make progress along these lines very quickly. I wish to close, theretofore, by thanking you for all your efforts as we work to make Colgate the best it can be.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMichael J. Herling ’79\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nThe recently concluded meeting of the Colgate Board of Trustees marks the end of my tenure as both chair and trustee of this fabulous institution. As such, this will be my final notice to the Colgate community. While there are many people I would like to thank for enabling me to enjoy the thrill of a lifetime during more than a decade of service, I would like to take a brief moment to recognize those a bit less obvious; but, who impactfully made my experience truly special.\n\nThank you to the members of the buildings and grounds team for putting a smile on my face every time I walk our spectacular campus or enter one of our iconic buildings. Your effort helps distinguish Colgate from others and creates the perfect environment to work and learn.\n\nThank you to all those hard-working individuals who prepare our wonderful meals, stay late, and start early during board weekends to ensure that all runs smoothly. Your work is greatly appreciated and the pride with which you consistently execute is always evident.\n\nThank you to every ticket taker, usher, and concession stand operator who has so pleasantly welcomed me to sporting events, artistic performances, and numerous lectures. Your embracing, warm smiles reinforce the notion that Colgate is always a warm, welcoming place regardless of the outside temperature.\n\nThank you to all the personal assistants and clerical staff who work for administrators, faculty, and coaches. It is obvious to all that this University could not operate without your tireless efforts, and I am very grateful to each of you.\n\nI would like to thank the residents of Hamilton who, with outstretched arms, have welcomed me to their village every time I have arrived since my first day in August 1982. Hamilton is truly a majestic town, open to all, and special in more ways than words can describe.\n\nI would like to thank the students of Colgate. It is your spirit, passion, intellect, and enthusiasm that make the long days and nights worthwhile and difficult tasks seem easy. Your appreciation of this institution is clear and your expectations inspiring. Thank you.\n\nAs Colgate heads into our third century, we advance knowing the entire Board of Trustees, under the leadership of Chair Mike Herling and vice chairs Jeanne Follansbee and Gus Coldebella, has never been stronger. President Casey and his administration are focused and empowered to deliver boldly on the Third-Century Plan. Our faculty is distinguished and world-renowned alumni extremely dedicated, athletic department first class, and student body a source of motivation and pride. I thank you all for the honor to serve Colgate.\n\nFinally, I am especially excited to witness the future greatness that I am confident you all will bring to this institution in the days ahead. Godspeed!!\n\nAll My Best, Always,\n\nDaniel B. Hurwitz ’86\n\nDear Members of the Colgate Community,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, I offer this report of the January 24–26, 2019 Board meeting, which took place in New York City. The focus of our general sessions and committee meetings was the planning work devoted to turning last year’s vision statement into a Third Century Plan.\n\nAs part of the effort to coordinate the important work of campus and Board governance groups, the meetings began with a dinner Thursday evening, January 24 that included members of the Advisory & Planning Committee (APC). President Casey provided an overview of this effort and offered several questions for those present to address in our conversations during dinner. The resulting dialogue among trustees, administrators, and APC members was both productive and enjoyable.\n\nOn Friday the Board heard short presentations about each of the major planning areas, including academic affairs; residential life; athletics; admission and financial aid; diversity, equity and inclusion; and housing in the Village of Hamilton. We also received an update regarding the University’s finances and planning efforts to encourage strong levels of charitable gift support.\n\nThe Board’s programmatic committees met throughout the afternoon and were engaged in more in-depth discussions about the various plans being developed by campus committees. The subjects discussed in each of the committees were:\n\nThe Academic Mission and Program Committee heard campus updates on the Middle Campus – Integrated Arts Planning; Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative; an emerging policy initiative; the Scholars Program; faculty support; and national fellowships and scholarships. The overarching theme of the meeting was on how best to structure the results of these various planning efforts to achieve an increased level of excellence across the University’s academic program.\n\nThe Campus Life and Programs Committee reviewed updates to the residential life planning underway and athletics facilities and program planning. It also discussed the national and Colgate-specific mental health trends and the ways Colgate is responding to student needs in this area. Regarding athletics, the committee reviewed and discussed current admissions, financial aid, and scholarship data related to Colgate student-athletes and how those factors can be revised to ensure continued competitive success. Financial data was presented that provided insight into Colgate’s varsity sport program operations, compensation, and scholarship budgets compared with other conference and similar institutions across the NCAA. Finally, a long-range comprehensive athletics facilities plan presented a vision for a renewed athletics village.\n\nThe University Outreach Committee discussed gift acceptance policies and other procedures that are important to successful fundraising efforts. The committee also received an update regarding various new communications initiatives. A preliminary admission and financial aid strategic plan was also outlined and discussed.\n\nThe University Resources Committee reviewed the progress in developing the 2019–20 operating budget that will be advanced for Board approval at our May meeting. It also reviewed the status of current and new capital projects as well as the financial framework to support the various strategic plans being developed. The committee will play an important role in ensuring there is a strong financial resource plan to fund Colgate’s near-term and long-term ambitions.\n\nAt the formal Board meeting Saturday morning, trustees were briefed on the efforts of each of the committees and approved expenditures to renovate the Hamilton Movie Theater and to replace the artificial turf on Tyler’s Field. The Board also approved the endowment spending guidelines that will guide the development of the 2019–20 operating budget.\n\nIn addition, the Board approved the recommendations from the President regarding faculty tenure appointments and promotions. We congratulate all those recognized. In September, the Board elected Mr. Michael J. Herling ’79, P’08, P’09, P’12 to serve as Board Chair following the Board meeting in early May. At our January 26 meeting, the Board elected Gus P. Coldebella ’91 and Jeanne A. Follansbee ’78, P’08 as Vice Chairs. They will also begin their terms of service after the May meeting. I would like to thank both Jeanne and Gus for their outstanding leadership on the Board, especially now as they are willing to assume these important vice chair positions.\n\nOn Friday night, members of the Board and Cabinet had dinner with emeriti and former trustees. The highlight of the dinner was President Casey’s announcement of a $15 million commitment by Robert Hung Ngai Ho ’56, H’11 to establish the Robert Hung Ngai Ho Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative at Colgate University.
