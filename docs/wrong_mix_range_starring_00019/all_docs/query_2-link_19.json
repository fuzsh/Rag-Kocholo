        "text": "Well, you want the characters to be better\n\nthan you so you can learn something from them.\n\nAnd if they're much worse than you,\n\nthen you can learn something from that too.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGrosse Pointe Blank was the first film\n\nthat I actually made myself.\n\nI wrote the script and was a producer on it.\n\nWe were working with Joe Roth at the time,\n\nwho had run Disney,\n\nso he was a great friend to me and to filmmakers.\n\nAnd so it was a great time.\n\nThe studios were still makin' weird movies like that,\n\nthat probably wouldn't get made today.\n\nSo I sort of wrote the character for myself.\n\nAnd we'd hired George Armitage,\n\nwho had made a film that I really liked\n\nwith another psychotic lead,\n\nMiami Blues with Alec Baldwin in the lead,\n\nAlec Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh.\n\nSo I thought he understood the tone\n\nthat we were going, that I was going for.\n\nAnd then we wrote parts for Alan Arkin\n\nand Dan Aykroyd and Minnie Driver.\n\nIt was a good time.\n\nSo that was the first kind of film that I produced.\n\nWhen I started to become a filmmaker,\n\nwhat I would do is I'd get the script\n\nsort of 70, 80% done.\n\nAnd then I would know that you're gonna\n\nhave all these great actors coming in\n\nand they're gonna have great ideas.\n\nSo Dan Aykroyd's gonna come in,\n\nand you know he's an improvisational genius.\n\nSo he'll come in with stuff\n\nfrom the book of Revelations and crazy stuff.\n\nHey, mental telepathy,\n\nastral projection, you know. [chuckles]\n\nHere you are, right.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nSo you wanna get the script sort of pregnant,\n\nbut not fully, not fully done.\n\nAnd then just sort of let the actors finish it.\n\nThey all came in and had things that they wanted to do,\n\nand I was happy to let 'em do it.\n\nAlan Arkin came in and said,\n\nLet's rewrite the scene before we shoot.\n\nAnd some of the other producers, they were worried.\n\nI was like, Don't worry.\n\nThat's Alan Arkin.\n\nAnything he's gonna do is\n\ngonna make this thing even better.\n\nWhatever level it's at,\n\nit's gonna go up two or three levels.\n\nDon't kill anybody for a few days.\n\nSee what it feels like.\n\n[Martin] I'll give it a shot.\n\nNo, no, don't give it a shot.\n\nDon't shoot anything.\n\nUgh.\n\nAnd so then you would just incorporate\n\nall this stuff in.\n\nWhen I started making films,\n\nI didn't have to worry about offending the writer\n\nif I was the writer.\n\nI just wanted to be open,\n\nespecially in a comedy,\n\nthings that happen on the set\n\nand things had happened in the moment\n\nand surprises and accidents.\n\nSo it's really just sort of not only being open\n\nto those things, but actually cultivating them.\n\nObviously, I didn't know who would play Debi,\n\nbut as soon as Minnie came in to audition,\n\nthat just seemed right.\n\nSo we knew that right away,\n\nand then, from that point on,\n\nwe started tailoring around her.\n\nI had a feeling we would get Alan to do it.\n\nWhen he said yes then I knew that that.\n\nSo I was writing it to try to get him\n\nat least interested enough to come play\n\nand work on it a bit.\n\nDan Aykroyd, the same thing.\n\nI just knew that, you just better buckle up.\n\nAnd the best thing with those actors is\n\nthat you end up getting run over\n\nby a cement truck on screen,\n\nand then you wanna make sure that the camera's rolling.\n\nThat's what happens with my sister.\n\nShe's just basically runs you over\n\nwith a cement truck,\n\nand you wanna make sure you're filming for it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nBrian's life had been,\n\nhe was sort of like he was in a kind\n\nof a musical arms race with the Beatles,\n\nwhere John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Harrison,\n\nRingo Starr, and those great producers\n\nwere creating these sounds.\n\nAnd there was Brian writing\n\nfor all the Beach Boys with one ear.\n\nFrom about 18 to 26, he was either making a film,\n\nmaking an album, they were on TV.\n\nAnd then he really sort of went away,\n\nand sort of went to a bit of an abyss for awhile.\n\nWhen he emerged from that 15 years later,\n\nthat part of his life wasn't chronicled or filmed.\n\nIt was secret.\n\nSo I was very lucky\n\nthat Brian and Melinda gave me access to them.\n\nLet me ask a lot of questions\n\nand let me hang out with them\n\nand try to find out what that was like for him,\n\ngoing into that dark place\n\nand then coming out of it.\n\nAnd also just trying to have a sense of,\n\ngetting a sense of who he who he really is,\n\nan incredible combination of things.\n\nHe's the most vulnerable, sensitive person\n\nyou could ever meet,\n\nalmost like a heart with two legs.\n\nBut then he's also very tough, like really tough\n\nand really committed to his art and what he wants to do\n\nand really, really tough.\n\nSo he's this strange combination of things\n\nwhere it's almost like water and steel.\n\nAnd he's kind of a wizard\n\nand a bit of a magician in so many ways.\n\nWhen he's talking to you,\n\nhe'll talk to you and look above your head,\n\nlike he's seeing colors or something.\n\nI don't even know what he sees,\n\nbut he's definitely a heavy kind of cat\n\nin a lot of ways.\n\nHe said he was happy with it,\n\nwhich made me really happy.\n\nAre these your shoes?\n\nWhat, yeah, yeah, they're my shoes.\n\nI didn't want to, you know, mess up the car,\n\nbecause I jog.\n\nYou see, I jog on the beach.\n\nAnd I get sand in my shoes, you know.\n\n[Woman] Ah.\n\nSo.\n\n[Woman] Well, that's very considerate.\n\nYou know, I also get sand in my socks.\n\nAnd I get holes in my socks,\n\nso I did make a mess anyway.\n\nSo I'm sorry about that.\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe project came about\n\n'cause I'd made Grosse Pointe Blank\n\nwith Disney, with Joe Roth and Kathy Nelson.\n\nAnd then Kathy called Joe\n\nand said, You know, we have this 'High Fidelity' project.\n\nAnd he said Why don't you get John to write that\n\nor adapt that?\n\nAnd so Joe and Kathy called me,\n\nand they said, What do you think of this book?\n\nAnd I loved the book.\n\nAnd I said, Oh yeah, I could do that.\n\nAnd I read the book,\n\nand I thought that I could adapt it for Chicago,\n\nbecause the only difference, really,\n\nwas, when I was growing up, we were obsessed\n\nwith English, like the punk, the new wave stuff,\n\nand, in the book, they were obsessed\n\nwith Wilson Pickett and Solomon Burke\n\nand all those kinds of sounds.\n\nBut besides that and the accents, it was the same guys,\n\nand it was the same kind of story\n\nabout male insecurity and insanity.\n\nSo I knew the record store where I grew up,\n\nand I knew those guys.\n\nAnd I knew everybody.\n\nYou just have to take away the British accents.\n\nI thought of sending it to Stephen Frears,\n\nwho I'd worked with.\n\nAnd he liked the idea.\n\nAnd then he came and worked to do it with us.\n\nI sort of had a little secret secret information\n\nbecause I'd worked with Tim Robbins a lot,\n\nand he had an acting company in LA that did\n\na lot of cool, radical theater called The Actors' Gang.\n\nAnd I'd worked with them.\n\nSo, during some of those midnight shows,\n\nI'd seen Jack play with his band Tenacious D.\n\nAnd he hadn't really had that great breakout role yet,\n\nbut I knew how talented he was.\n\nAnd I knew what a great musician and singer he was\n\nand how hilarious he was.\n\nSo, in the book, when Jack's character finally plays\n\nat the end and kills it,\n\nI knew Jack was the,\n\nas soon as I was writing it,\n\nI knew Jack should be Barry.\n\nJack didn't know that, but so I had to convince him.\n\nBut I think he thought maybe me and Stephen\n\nwere scary at first.\n\nOr we might be scary people.\n\nBut then I was like, no, no, we're nice, we're nice.\n\nSo I think he was, he, might've been\n\na little bit spooked by Stephen.\n\n'Cause Stephen can,\n\nhe's this British guy,\n\nand he just sort of looks over at you and studies you.\n\nAnd he's super intense.\n\nAnd so I said, Ah, don't worry about him.\n\nFinally, Jack said yes.\n\nBut I knew it was perfect.\n\nAnd I knew that I knew what the rest\n\nof the world didn't know,\n\nwhich was the Jack was a brilliant comedian\n\nand a brilliant musician.\n\nI knew that it would just sort of,\n\nthat part would just explode.\n\nAnd just happy for him.\n\nHe's such a great guy,\n\nsuch a great actor.\n\n♪ I've been really tryin', baby ♪\n\n[crowd cheering]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThat was a cool, weird one,\n\n'cause I was at an agency in LA at the time.\n\nI remember saying to them,\n\nI want to know what's your,\n\nthe most unproducible, weirdest script.\n\nYou guys have all have a black box\n\nor the red book or whatever those things are\n\nwhere it's like the scripts that can never get made.\n\nAnd they said, Well, there's these things.\n\nI go, No, no.\n\nI mean what is the most unproducible script you have.\n\nI wanna know what's your jewel\n\nof kryptonite for commerciality.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nI know you guys have it somewhere in your vaults, right?\n\nAnd he goes, Well, you mean 'Being John Malkovich'?\n\nI said, What?\n\nAnd literally I found the script there,\n\nand I said to them, Okay, here's the deal.\n\n'Cause I read the script, and it was insane.\n\nSo I said, I want to be first in the door\n\nto the financier whenever this gets,\n\nif this ever gets made.\n\nAnd if you guys do that,\n\nI'll stay with you.\n\nAnd like Indiana Jones, I'd found this,\n\nI'd gone to the jungles and found this rare treasure.\n\nIt was just good.\n\nIt was, like kind of being in a Wonka\n\nfun house all the time.\n\nAnd so I do remember they had a chiropractor on set,\n\n'cause by the end of the day, everybody was all twisted.\n\nSo everybody'd get cracked at the end of the day.\n\nCharlie's script was so brilliant\n\nthat it was kind of perfect tonally.\n\nBut even within that, there were still things\n\nthat you'd come up with on the day.\n\nI remember the character in the film\n\nthat Malkovich is friends with was,\n\nin the script, it was Kevin Bacon.\n\nJohn Malkovich and I were talking,\n\nand then we said the guy you should really get\n\nis Charlie Sheen.\n\nJohn just started laughing at the idea that\n\nin his great hour of need\n\nhe would call Charlie Sheen\n\nto come over and confide in.\n\nSo there was still some give and take in that way.\n\nIt was great fun to make that film, great fun.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'd seen John Sayles' film Matewan\n\nand Brother from Another Planet.\n\nHe was a guy that I admired a lot.\n\nSo I heard about the project,\n\nand he wanted to meet me.\n\nAnd he offered me the role of Buck Weaver.\n\nAnd I knew a lot about the Black Sox history.\n\nI'd grown up going to the Wrigley Field\n\nand the old Comiskey Park.\n\nAnd the old Comiskey Park was where\n\nthe Black Sox had actually played.\n\nSo I knew all about the history.\n\nSo I was very excited to do it.\n\nExcited to work with John.\n\nI was a big baseball fan,\n\nand I was also, I'd seen a lot\n\nof the Bang the Drum Slowly\n\nand some of the other, Fear Strikes Out.\n\nBut there hadn't been a really good modern baseball film.\n\nAnd then I thought this could be really, really great.\n\nImmediately, I read the Eliot Asinof book,\n\nwhich is a real page turner.\n\nAnd then you just go back\n\nand would read about the letters\n\nthat Weaver wrote, and there's footage\n\nand there's archives of him.\n\nYou just tried to capture the spirit of him.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nRoland Emmerich asked me to do it.\n\nAnd I read the script\n\nand thought it was pretty wild and outrageous.\n\nI knew it would be sort of a huge movie.\n\nBut I really liked Roland.\n\nHe was a really great guy to work to work with,\n\nvery collaborative and very interested\n\nin your opinion about things\n\nand how you can make it better.\n\nSo it's always interesting working with people like that.\n\nWhat I thought was interesting about him as well\n\nis that the sets in the scope of the thing\n\nwere so complex, but he managed it so effortlessly.\n\nSo he would have huge sets\n\nwith cars and trucks and boulders and all that stuff.\n\nBut then in the back of the set would be a green screen.\n\nSo it wasn't all green screen,\n\nwith just people in front of the green screen,\n\nit was a mixture of sets with green screen.\n\nAnd then you would have three or four different cameras.\n\nBut he would manage to do these things every day.\n\nHe'd have an entire city block\n\nthat would be on a moving machine or a shaking machine.\n\nSo we could have a limousine driving\n\non a city block and you'd see a white picket fence,\n\nand you'd see four houses, and it would all be shaking\n\nlike it was an earthquake.\n\nSomebody had to make that in Vancouver,\n\na football field worth of moveable stuff that can do that.\n\nAnd it seemed like every day\n\nyou'd come on and there'd be another\n\nmassive major contraption that he would\n\njust be like, all right, let's go.\n\nAnd he would have it all sorted out.\n\nSo just technically amazing,\n\nbrilliant kind of filmmaker that way.\n\nHe would say, I think today, you're getting out\n\nof this thing, and you're running,\n\nand there's this huge ash cloud.\n\nAnd it's the size of Las Vegas.\n\nAnd you're running, and I think you're really scared.\n\nGot it.\n\nSo he did a lot of Harrison Ford running away from things.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThat was interesting.\n\nThat was a Sony thing.\n\nI did a couple of things for Sony.\n\nAnd I think John Calley was running the studio then,\n\nwho was another great consecutive.\n\nAnd James Mangold had the project.\n\nHe asked me to do it.\n\nAnd the whole thing sort of centered\n\non the reveal at the end of the third act.\n\nAnd if you sort of had disguised it well enough,\n\nit would really be shocking.\n\nAnd so it's kind of fun to have everything,\n\nto be on a tightrope, where if you screw it up at all,\n\nand the audience knows what's going on,\n\nthe movie's dead.\n\nBut I think we seemed to manage to pull it off.\n\nI was very excited to work with Ray Liotta,\n\nwho I always admired.\n\nI think also, when you're,\n\nif you're doing a thriller\n\nor a psychological thriller,\n\nyou withhold information about the characters\n\nand so people are leaning into it a little bit.\n\nSo yeah, it's a little bit more of an austere thing,\n\nwhere you're playing silences\n\nand are working with the ambiguity\n\nthat people don't know who the person is.\n\nAnd so it was more of kind of a straight leading man role\n\nwith a twist, because as it went on,\n\nyou realized that people weren't who they seem to be.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThat was a strange one.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I was a big fan of Jim Thompson.\n\nAnd I remember Jim Thompson made\n\nthe Kubrick film The Killing.\n\nI was a huge fan of Jim Thompson's stuff.\n\nAnd I tried to option the book as a kid,\n\n'cause I thought I'd love to play Roy Dillon.\n\nAnd I thought the whole thing\n\nwith the mother and the Oedipal theme there\n\nwas very intense and cool and twisted.\n\nAnd then, as I got older,\n\nI found out they were gonna make the film,\n\nthat Stephen Frears was gonna make it.\n\nAnd I think I'd made Say Anything\n\na few years before.\n\nSo I was a little bit hot in the business at the time.\n\nSo he met me and just sort of walked\n\naround and stared at me and then asked me to do it.\n\nI always loved movies about the con, the grift.\n\nSo it was great to do that\n\nand to work with that kind of source material,\n\nwhich is as good as it gets.\n\nTo work with Angelica Houston,\n\nAnnette Benning, Stephen Frears, it was.\n\nI felt like Jack.\n\nI was like, oh boy, I'm with the big boys now, I'm scared.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think the Dostoevsky quote at the beginning\n\nthat you can know all you need to know\n\nabout a civilization by looking at its prisons.\n\nSo I added that to the proceedings.\n\nBut then it was such a crazy kind of whacked-out cartoon\n\nthat I thought all these people\n\non the plane are so eccentric and crazy.\n\nso I said, what can I do?\n\nSo I thought what I'll do is,\n\nI'll be the first non-biblical action star.\n\nCharlton Heston did a lot of stuff\n\nwith no shirt and sandals,\n\nbut I've never seen a modern movie\n\nwith a action star wearing sandals.\n\nSo I wore Birkenstocks,\n\nand that was sort of the extent\n\nof my thinking on that one.\n\nOnce I had the sandals,\n\nI think everything was came from there.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhen I did 1408, I loved being\n\nin that Stephen King mindset.\n\nHe doesn't get the credit as a writer that he deserves.\n\n'cause he draws, I don't think it was a 20-page short story,\n\nbut it filled up 2 1/2 hours,\n\nand it could have felt up four hours.\n\nIt was like walking into Dr. Who's telephone booth.\n\nAnd you see this small little thing,\n\nbut it's just gotten way more space in there than you think.\n\nThat's sort of the way his writing is.\n\nBut it came about,\n\nand I read it, and I thought it was really interesting.\n\nAnd I just thought it had that feel\n\nthat Identity had where it was\n\nlike a supernatural, psychological thriller\n\nor even like in that Being John Malkovich way,\n\nwhere you questioned what ground you're actually on.\n\nI love that sort of that element more than\n\nthe jump scares or the gore.\n\nI like that Rod Serling kind of psychological,\n\nsupernatural horror.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIt was a thing where I was sitting at,\n\nand this happens sometimes,\n\nyou just get a phone call.\n\nSomebody'll say, do you want to come to China\n\nand do an action movie with Jackie Chan?\n\nAnd you're like excuse me?\n\nWhat?\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nThat just sounds like way too crazy an adventure to pass up.\n\nOf course I'm gonna go do that.\n\nAnd this was sort of like that.\n\nGillian Flynn had reconceived this show Utopia.\n\nAnd she wanted to shoot in Chicago.\n\nSo I was like, wow, that sounds great.\n\nAnd then she sent me the scripts,\n\nand I read them all.\n\nI read them until four in the morning,\n\n'cause I couldn't put it down.\n\nIt was just great writing\n\nand very provocative and shocking.\n\nI thought this could be good.\n\nSo I think this character was,\n\nin a way, a captain of industry.\n\nHe's what is marketed these days\n\nas one of the great benevolent billionaires,\n\nwho are just there working\n\nfor all of our safety and our future.\n\nA glorious, unified, multi-racial, democratic,\n\ngreen new world that we're all moving towards.\n\nSo it's set up that way.\n\nAnd then, as usual with Gillian,\n\nhowever you think you've pegged it,\n\nthe floor's gonna drop out.\n\nAnd it's gonna drop out another six times after that.\n\nTo me, it was a good take on this idea\n\nof change coming from the apex of power down\n\nfrom the 1% of the 1% down.\n\nIt was a good twist to take on that."
