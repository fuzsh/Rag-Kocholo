        "text": "The above photo says it all. I cannot resist 1960’s California modern architecture and will watch literally any movie that features it. Lucky for me, Brian Wilson apparently owned a seriously cool house, straight out of Blake Edward’s The Party. Wilson also wrote some great songs with The Beach Boys, but let’s be clear- I’m here for his swimming pool. Grab your sunblock and antidepressants—we’re watching Love & Mercy (Disc/Download).\n\nAs far as music biopics go, this one doesn’t follow the standard formula. Switching back and forth between 1960’s and 1980’s Brian Wilson, the film stars Paul Dano and John Cusack as two versions of the same complicated man. In the heyday of The Beach Boys, he was the mad genius behind so many of their hits, crying out for help in his lyrics, with a family unwilling and/or unable to see that he needed serious medical attention. By the time the 1980’s hit, he’d lost a brother, spent a decade in bed, and hooked up with crooked doctor Eugene Landy (played by a villainous Paul Giamatti). Shuffling through life like a sad, lonely child, he’s trapped in a haze of pharmaceuticals until he meets Cadillac saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (played by Elizabeth Banks), who helps him find a way out from under Landy’s control. While Paul Dano gets the splashier role of young Brian, mixing it up in the studio and harmonizing over Pet Sounds, John Cusack’s performance is so quiet and lovely you almost miss it. The romance he shares with Melinda makes you feel like this is what he’d been singing about all that time– he just didn’t know it yet. God only knows what he’d be without her.\n\nAlthough I love the ‘60s aesthetic in half of the movie, I also adore Elizabeth Banks going full-on ‘80s with her hot-rolled hair and pastel sweaters. If this lady were a cocktail, she would be something light, refreshing, and sweet. She would be a Sea Breeze.\n\nSea Breeze\n\n1 ½ oz Vodka\n\n4 oz Cranberry Juice\n\n1 oz grapefruit juice\n\nLime Wedge\n\nCombine vodka, cranberry, and grapefruit juices in a shaker with ice. Shake until well mixed, then dump entire contents of shaker into a glass. Garnish with a lime wedge.\n\nThe real Brian Wilson is still touring the country, packing venues full of middle-aged men in Hawaiian shirts and one very nostalgic Liz Locke. And good for him! Between this film, his records, and those concerts, I’m left with nothing but Good Vibrations, and a Smile. Cheers!\n\nIf you could crawl into the mind of a celebrity, who would it be? For me, the answer is easy- Nicolas Cage. Not only would it likely be a weird and wacky ride, but I might be able to save him (and the rest of humanity) from some truly terrible films. In this week’s film Being John Malkovich (DVD/Download), one of the great American actors of the 20th century becomes the host du jour. Why did screenwriter Charlie Kaufman choose actor John Malkovich? Because it’s just fun to say Malkovich.\n\nDirected by Spike Jonze, Being John Malkovich has all the movie elements I love. Unusual sets (7 ½ floor, anyone?), puppets, and famous actors playing themselves. As greasy-haired puppeteer Craig Schwartz, John Cusack slides through the portal into John Malkovich’s mind and eventually opens the actor up to a slew of other people taking possession. As the film progresses, we start to examine what makes a person uniquely themselves, and how much of our minds are controlled by outside influences.\n\nAlthough many people try to inhabit the mind of Malkovich, the 105-years-young Dr. Lester has perhaps the biggest claim to this coveted mental real estate. It’s his building where the portal on the 7 ½ floor exists, and he’s spent his life drinking carrot juice to stay vital. Wouldn’t it be great to find a cocktail that reverses the aging process? I’m willing to try if you are. While watching Being John Malkovich, I recommend drinking a Carrot Collins.\n\nCarrot Collins\n\n3 oz carrot juice\n\n¾ oz lime juice\n\n1.5 oz spiced rum\n\n¾ cup ginger beer\n\n1 oz mint simple syrup\n\nCombine all ingredients in a collins glass over ice. Stir gently, and garnish with a sprig of mint.\n\nOne of the most interesting scenes in the film is when John Malkovich goes through his own portal, landing inside his own mind. What he encounters is a collection of Malkovich clones, who can speak only his surname; or as he puts it, “a world no man should see.” I can empathize. A room full of Liz Locke’s? TERRIFYING. Cheers!\n\nTrue story- the one and only time I’ve ever been carded and turned away from a movie was High Fidelity (DVD/Download) in April 2000. I was 16 years old, a recent transplant to Central Pennsylvania, and stunned to find myself smack dab in the Bible Belt. For months afterward, I waited impatiently to see what erotic, taboo tales awaited me in the R-rated and undoubtedly-risque High Fidelity. Imagine my surprise and outrage that not only was there nothing “R” about it, but also that I was unnecessarily delayed from seeing what would become one of my all-time favorite films.\n\nMy Top 5 lists on Cinema Sips are a direct homage to this comedic gem, so in lieu of a proper plot description I think it’s more appropriate to list off my Top 5 High Fidelity Scenes:\n\nWhen John Cusack plays the new Beta Band LP in his niche Chicago record shop, causing all the customers fall under its spell. Perfect music moment.\n\nLisa Bonet sings “Baby I Love Your Way” by Peter Frampton. I too, always hated that song. And now I too, kinda like it.\n\nJack Black berating a customer for wanting to buy a copy of Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. In answer to his subquestion, it is definitely better to burn out than to fade away.\n\nThe making of a Top 5 List of songs about death. This is absolutely a conversation I want to be a part of.\n\nBarry Jive and the Uptown Five singing “Let’s Get it On”. And just like that, Jack Black the Movie Star was born.\n\nAlthough the Nick Hornby novel this film was based on is set in London, I love the decision to set the movie adaptation in Chicago. The city itself becomes like another character in the film, so to that end we should definitely celebrate this midwestern metropolis with its namesake drink. While watching High Fidelity, I recommend drinking a classic Chicago Cocktail.\n\nChicago Cocktail\n\n2 oz Brandy\n\nDash of Triple Sec\n\nDash of Bitters\n\n1 oz Champagne\n\nStir Brandy, Triple Sec, and Bitters together in a shaker filled with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe, and top with champagne.\n\nIf you happen to find yourself celebrating Record Store Day later this month, don’t be too put off by the employees at your local vinyl shop. They actually do know a lot about music, so let them make suggestions. They may not be able to give relationship advice, but if you’re looking to find a band that picks up where Echo and the Bunnymen left off, they’ve got your back. Cheers!\n\nThis past week I had the pleasure of celebrating Valentine’s Day a little early at my local drive-in movie theater with a screening of Say Anything (DVD/Download). Without being tacky, I’ll just say that this movie is best watched from the backseat. It’s not really a movie that celebrates cocktails in any way, but it DOES feature one of the greatest romantic leads in cinematic history, Lloyd Dobbler.\n\nWhat can be said about Lloyd Dobbler that hasn’t already been shouted from the rooftops by every teenage girl? As Lloyd, John Cusack is a guy so great that he could only ever exist in the movies. I feel almost bad for him that he’s lovesick over Diane Court “whoa”, a smart, pretty girl who will never truly appreciate what she has (he gave her his heart and she gave him a pen. I rest my case). This is a guy who will stand outside your house with a boombox blasting Peter Gabriel, with no hint of embarrassment. This is a guy who will not comment on the fact that you are WAY overdressed for a high school keg party, then end the night by being a dependable designated driver. Who is this guy? He’s Lloyd Dobbler. And goddamn it he doesn’t want to sell, buy, or process anything.\n\nLurking over the love story of Lloyd and Diane (besides her father’s IRS troubles) is brainy Diane’s eventual move to England on a scholastic fellowship. Lloyd, being a well-travelled army brat, offers to give her tips- English tips (whatever that means). I’m assuming those tips would include the knowledge that Pimm’s No. 1 is an amazing British liquor export and should be drunk whenever possible. Plus, for a Valentine’s Day cocktail, you can’t get much more festive than this one. While watching Say Anything, I recommend drinking a Pimm’s Royale.\n\nPimm’s Royale\n\n1.5 oz Pimm’s No. 1\n\n4 oz pink champagne\n\nStrawberry for garnish\n\nPour Pimms into a champagne flute, then top with champagne. Garnish with a strawberry.\n\nWritten and directed by Cameron Crowe, Say Anything features amazingly astute dialogue, great music, and above all, teen angst. To me, it’s his greatest achievement as a filmmaker, and Lloyd his greatest character. Sometimes, it just takes the simple courage to pick up a phone and call the girl up. Lloyd gives us all hope. Cheers!\n\nThis week, I’m surrounded by gardens, southern society, cocktails, and guns in the Southern classic Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (DVD/Download). This was one of my favorite movies of the 1990’s, and it still holds up well today. It paints Savannah as a mythical place full of people who drink at all hours of the day, sassy drag queens, and gun-toting antiques dealers. I’d say I’m eager to catch a plane there, but who am I kidding- I live in Austin! We’re practically twin cities.\n\nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is based on the bestselling non-fiction book of the same name by John Berendt. In it, he chronicles the trial of a wealthy member of Savannah society who is accused of murdering his paramour. Kevin Spacey plays the antiques dealer/bon vivant on trial, and Jude Law has a few brief scenes as his victim/lover. This film was a great place for Kevin Spacey to hone his eventual House of Cards accent, which he does to perfection. Not so great in the accent dept. is Jude Law, who does a sort of cockney/southern hybrid, but I’m willing to overlook it because he’s young and gorgeous (albeit in a redneck-psycho sort of way). The true star of this film (and the book) is of course The Lady Chablis. I love that the character was played by the real life Chablis Deveau because really, who else could possibly do this part justice? And I also love John Cusack as the fish-out-of-water reporter who stumbles into this world of, as he puts it, “Gone With the Wind on mescaline.”\n\nAs I have said, this film is excellent with a cocktail pairing because most of the characters treat drinking like a competitive sport. As one person says, “If you’re thirsty, a drink will cure it. If you’re not, a drink will prevent it. Prevention is better than a cure.” This beverage definitely feels medicinal, with its refreshing combination of rum, cognac, and LOTS of ice. When watching Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, I recommend drinking this Savannah Julep.\n\n8-10 mint leaves, roughly torn\n\n2 tsp simple syrup\n\n2 oz cognac\n\n1/2 oz dark rum\n\nMint Sprig\n\nPowdered Sugar\n\nIn a cup (a metal julep cup is great if you have it, but I’m going even more southern and using a mason jar), muddle mint leaves and simple syrup. Pour in cognac, to rinse off muddler; remove muddler. Fill the cup ¾ full with crushed ice and stir with a bar spoon. Add a small dome of crushed ice, and pour the rum over the top. Garnish with a mint sprig and a dusting of powdered sugar.\n\nThis cocktail is so refreshing that it might be my summer go-to when the temperature spikes above 100. It’ll always make me think of Spanish moss, long languorous afternoons that stretch into warm, humid nights, and genteel southerners with secrets for miles. As you watch Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, concern yourself less with whether or not Jim Williams is guilty, and more with the eccentric group of people that populate Savannah. In this instance, the truth is definitely stranger than fiction. Cheers!"
