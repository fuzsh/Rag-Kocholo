        "text": "The 1990s were a good time to be making films, according to John Cusack, who is on the road sharing his stories about what it was like with audiences.\n\nHe will be in Riverside Saturday, March 16, for a screening of 1997’s “Grosse Pointe Blank.” Cusack starred in the film as a hit man attending a high school reunion and questioning his life choices in the affluent Michigan city. The black comedy, directed by George Armitage, was Cusack’s first producing credit and an early writing credit as well.\n\nThe screening is part of a series put together by The Backlot Project, a division of Creative Artists Agency that specializes in movie star Q&As. This screening, at the Fox Performing Arts Center, is Cusack’s only Southern California appearance. The Backlot Project is doing another series with William Shatner, who will attend a screening of “Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan” at the same venue on May 18.\n\n“They asked me if I would do some screenings of some of the movies that are popular and I said ‘Sure, as long as they don’t suck. Pick good ones.’ And they picked ones I think people want to see in a big hall with a great sound system,” Cusack said in a phone interview from Illinois, where he lives.\n\n“I’ve done a million Q&As for the things when you’re making the films. I haven’t gone back and done one that I made 10 or 20 years ago, but I said I’m open to it.”\n\nOne of the other films in the series is “Say Anything,” a1989 romantic comedy/drama from writer/director Cameron Crowe about a high school misfit pursuing his class valedictorian (Ione Skye) before she heads to college in England. It has the iconic scene of Cusack standing on her lawn playing her a Peter Gabriel song on a boombox he is holding over his head.\n\nCusack is also doing Q&As for “High Fidelity,” the 2000 adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel about a record store owner trying to win back a girlfriend who dumped him for being immature. Stephen Frears directed, and Cusack shared a writing credit on the screenplay as well as co-producing.\n\nAlthough set near Detroit, “Grosse Pointe Blank” was filmed in Southern California and had its origins in the Inland Empire. The original story was by the late Tom Jankiewicz, an Upland resident who was originally from Michigan. He was substitute teaching and an working part-time in a Big Lots store at Foothill Boulevard and Mountain Avenue while pursuing a career in screenwriting in 1991 when he got a letter about a high school reunion that became the basis of his plot.\n\nCusack played Martin Q. Blank, the hitman, and Dan Aykroyd played a rival attempting to either turn him into an employee or rub him out. They share scenes of verbal sparring and gunfights.\n\nThe cast also included Minnie Driver as a love interest and Alan Arkin as Blank’s analyst.\n\nHere are some of Cusack’s comments about the films.\n\nQ: Are audiences different at the three films?\n\nA: Obviously “Grosse Pointe Blank” is a rowdier, black, satirical film. “High Fidelity” is I think a little bit more about men and men’s craziness and all of our secrets, whereas “Say Anything” is super nostalgic for people. So yeah, they all have different reactions.\n\nQ: What was it like making “Grosse Point Blank”?\n\nA: I just recall it being a great time in the film business. (Producer) Joe Roth, who was a great benefactor to my career, allowed me to make “Grosse Point Blank” and “High Fidelity.” He supported us wonderfully. I remember it as being a very good time in the business, less corporate. It felt like you could make some really good stuff.\n\nQ: Even though it’s set in Michigan, it was shot in Southern California, wasn’t it?\n\nA: We shot a lot of it in Pasadena because the money in Pasadena wanted to recreate the Midwest, so had a lot of the same streets and trees. You can actually drive around neighborhoods in Pasadena that look eerily like the Midwest. There aren’t a lot of place like that, but there are some in Pasadena, and Monrovia as well.\n\nQ: What about the material was interesting to you?\n\nA: I liked the idea of making a black comedy about people not connecting their behavior with who they are … so it looked like a very commercial film, but it was actually far more subversive in its bones. And I think we were among the first people starting to do the hitman having the existential moral crisis and seeing a shrink. It spurred a little cottage industry after that. But it’s nice to be first.\n\nQ: What was it like shooting those scenes with Dan Aykroyd?\n\nA: Oh, it was great. One of the reasons I like to write is that I don’t have to worry about offending the writers. So we have improvisational actors like Dan Aykroyd or Alan Arkin or people of that caliber, you can really riff with them and use their best stuff.\n\n‘Live Conversation with John Cusack — Grosse Pointe Blank’\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, March 16; doors open at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Fox Performing Arts Center, 3801 Mission Inn Ave., Riverside\n\nTickets: $59-$79; VIP experience, $150\n\nInformation: 951-779-9800, riversidelive.com"
