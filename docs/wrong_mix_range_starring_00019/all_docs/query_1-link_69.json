I'm Peter Clowney filling in for Terry Gross.\n\nJohn Cusack has been making movies since he was a teen-ager. His films\n\ninclude \"The Sure Thing,\" \"Say Anything,\" \"The Grifters,\" \"Being John\n\nMalkovich,\" and \"High Fidelity.\" Now he's starring in the new movie\n\n\"America's Sweethearts.\" It's a satire about mediocre Hollywood melodramas\n\nand the publicity junkets, which studios organize to pitch their films to\n\nthe\n\npress. \"America's Sweethearts\" also stars Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, and\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones. Later on today's show we'll hear what our movie\n\ncritic\n\nthinks of the film.\n\nTerry Gross talked with John Cusack last year after the release of \"High\n\nFidelity,\" the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel. Cusack\n\nplayed Rob Gordon the owner of a used record store who defines himself in\n\nterms of his favorite songs. He defines everyone else in terms of theirs.\n\nHere he is in the record store with a couple of fellow pop music obsessives\n\nwho work for him. Rob is declaring his list of the top five albums with\n\ngreat\n\nfirst tracks. The guy mocking him is played by Jack Black.\n\n(Soundbite of \"High Fidelity\")\n\nMr. JACK BLACK (Actor): Rob, it's your turn.\n\nMr. JOHN CUSACK (Actor): OK. I'm feeling kind of basic today. Top five\n\nside-ones--track-ones. Janie Jones, \"Clash\" from \"The Clash.\" \"Let's Get\n\nIt\n\nOn,\" Marvin Gaye, from \"Let's Get It On.\" Nirvana, \"Smells Like Teen\n\nSpirit\"\n\noff of \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMr. BLACK: Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough--not at all. How about\n\n\"Point of No Return\" on \"Point of No Return,\" Louis(ph), so you couldn't get\n\nup...\n\nMr. CUSACK: Shut up. \"White Light/White Heat,\" Velvet Underground.\n\nMr. BLACK: OK. That would be on my list.\n\nUnidentified Man #1: Not on mine.\n\nMr. CUSACK: \"Massive Attack,\" no protection, the song is \"Radiation Ruling\n\nthe Nation.\"\n\nMr. BLACK: Oh, kind of a new record very--in a minute--very nice, Rob. A\n\nsly\n\ndeclaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old, safe\n\nones--very\n\n(censored).\n\nUnidentified Man #2: Excuse me, I was...\n\nMr. BLACK: In a minute. Couldn't you be any more obvious than that, Rob?\n\nHow about, I don't know, The Beatles? How about Beethoven--track-one,\n\nside-one of the \"Fifth Symphony\"? How can someone who has no interest in\n\nmusic own a record store?\n\n(Soundbite of 2000 interview with Cusack)\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nJohn Cusack, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Hi.\n\nGROSS: Do you know any people who are like the characters in the used\n\nrecord\n\nstore in \"High Fidelity\"?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, when I read Nick's book--Nick Hornby's book, I immediately\n\nknew the equivalent in Chicago. I even knew all the geography. I knew\n\nwhere\n\nthe record store was when I was growing up in suburban Chicago. I knew the\n\nrecord store in downtown Chicago, when I was a little older and living\n\nthere.\n\nI knew where Rob went when he was depressed, he went right to the Green\n\nMill.\n\nYou know, I knew where he spun records. I knew the clubs he went to. I\n\nknew\n\nthe music scene there. And I think that's kind of, you know, the genius of\n\nNick's book, is that it really could be anywhere. It could be in Seattle,\n\nBoston, Chicago. I mean, I don't know if it would play in Beijing; but any\n\nWestern-style country. I mean, everybody knows these people.\n\nGROSS: Did you know those stores from buying records there?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, yeah. And you just know the whole culture. You just know\n\nthat whole music culture.\n\nGROSS: In a way, you know, like if you were really into buying books or\n\nrecords, those stores are almost like museums--where all the rare stuff is.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, yeah.\n\nGROSS: And the guys who work there are the people who are the real experts.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, and that's, I mean, one of the things that's so great\n\nabout\n\nthe book and, hopefully, we've captured it in the film, is, you know, these\n\npeople who are Rob, Dick, and Barry--the people who run the record\n\nstore--and\n\nwho are so obsessed by and define their lives through music, they really see\n\nthemselves as misplaced royalty, you know, as these great, underappreciated\n\nexperts and scholars who really know more about anything that's ever been\n\nrecorded than the entire world. So there's really a great sense of fun\n\nabout\n\nthat because they're so full of themselves.\n\nGROSS: One of the things that I think really works in the movie is the way\n\nyou've managed to preserve the main character's voice. I think one of the\n\ndifficult transitions in making any novel into a book is how do you get that\n\ninterior monologue in a movie? And the way you solved that problem in \"High\n\nFidelity,\" was to have the main character, Rob, actually give monologues and\n\ntalk to the camera, just talk to us, the audience. You're one of the\n\nco-writers of the screenplay and one of the producers of the film. Was that\n\na\n\nbig discussion about whether there should be these monologues within the\n\nmovie\n\nor not?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yes. I sort of--when we first started adapting it, we played\n\naround with the idea and then we sort of put it to rest for a while and were\n\nworking on the script. And then finally we couldn't really figure out a way\n\nto get all of those interior monologues sufficiently into the film. Because\n\nthe parts of Rob that, you know, are a slacker and in denial and inert and,\n\nyou know, lazy and all those fun things, that was easy. I mean, it was easy\n\nto play him as the fool. But I think what gives Nick's characters, and\n\nespecially Rob, you know, a redemptive quality is their courage at sort of\n\nlooking at all those hard, uncomfortable truths that we'd rather avoid. And\n\nit was very difficult to get those out. So I think the best thing we came\n\nup\n\nwith was we should just have him kind of confess it to the audience and\n\nstart\n\na relationship with the audience as a confidant, or, you know, something of\n\nthat nature.\n\nGROSS: Can I ask you to do a few lines from one of the monologues or read a\n\npassage from the book that I know that you have with you, that you adapted\n\ninto one of the monologues?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Sure. I'll read you something that we sort of start the film\n\nwith, which is--the setting is that Rob's girlfriend Laura has just left\n\nhim.\n\nAnd he has retreated into his usual sort of isolated world of music. And\n\nhe's\n\ngot his headphones on and he's got some angry music blaring, and he just\n\nlooks\n\nup in the camera and says the following:\n\n(Reading) What came first, the music or the misery? Did I listen to music\n\nbecause I was miserable, or was I miserable because I listen to music? Do\n\nall\n\nthese records turn you into a melancholy person? You know, people worry\n\nabout\n\nkids playing with guns, and teen-agers watching violent videos, or scared\n\nthat\n\nsome sort of culture of violence will take them over. But nobody worries\n\nabout kids listening to thousands--literally thousands of songs about broken\n\nhearts, rejection, pain, misery and loss. The unhappiest people I know,\n\nromantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most. And I\n\ndon't\n\nknow whether pop music has caused this unhappiness, but I do know that\n\nthey've\n\nbeen listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living unhappy\n\nlives.\n\nGROSS: That's a great passage. So that was one that you and the other\n\nwriters knew had to be in the movie?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, well, we wanted to sort of anchor, sort of, the\n\nheartbreak\n\nwith the obsession with music right off the bat. So that's sort of how we\n\nopened the film.\n\nGROSS: Now is it hard to do a monologue into the camera? You're not\n\ntalking\n\nto a person, you're not reacting to anything. What do you have to think\n\nabout\n\nto make that work? Because it can be really stagey and not work. I think\n\nit\n\nreally does work in the movie.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, we sort of--we thought of \"Alfie,\" you know, with Michael\n\nCaine as one that really worked. And then there were many, many instances\n\nwhere it didn't. But I think just choosing the right content is the most\n\nimportant thing. I mean, you certainly can't have be a casual aside. It\n\neither has to be very, very funny or very honest, but it can't move the plot\n\nforward or anything like that. And I think once you start doing it, it's\n\nactually very liberating.\n\nGROSS: How?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, it just seems to cut to the chase in some kind of\n\nfantastic\n\nway. And it's so direct that it's kind of startling to do.\n\nGROSS: Now I was wondering if, like, the soliloquies in Shakespeare's time\n\nwere the equivalent of this--it's like talking to the audience.\n\nMr. CUSACK: We should be so lucky. But I've spoken to other actresses and\n\nactors about it who've done it, you know. Nicole Kidman did the same thing\n\nin\n\n\"To Die For.\"\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. CUSACK: And she said, you know, she's very nervous to do it but then\n\nonce\n\nshe started, you know, she didn't want to stop. And I sort of felt the same\n\nway. Once I really committed to it, it was one of my favorite parts of the\n\nprocess.\n\nCLOWNEY: John Cusack speaking with Terry Gross. Cusack appears in the new\n\nfilm \"America's Sweethearts,\" which opens today. We'll hear more of their\n\nconversation in a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nCLOWNEY: Let's return to our interview with John Cusack. Terry Gross spoke\n\nwith him last year after the release of the film \"High Fidelity.\"\n\n(Soundbite of 2000 interview with Cusack)\n\nGROSS: Watching \"High Fidelity,\" helped me, I think, figure out one of the\n\nthings that really works for you as an actor. I always believe you have an\n\ninner life. Like when you're on screen, I always believe that you're\n\nthinking\n\ninteresting thoughts and that the world is registering on you and you're\n\nhaving, you know, like a dialogue with yourself about the meaning of it, and\n\nthat dialogue is, I always imagine, kind of funny also. And there's a lot\n\nof\n\nactors who just don't quite have that; you don't imagine having them having\n\nan\n\ninner life.\n\nMr. CUSACK: They're probably more adjusted, in some way.\n\nGROSS: Well, some of them, you imagine, are too busy looking in the mirror\n\nto\n\nspend time having an inner life.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, yeah, they have that disease, too, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Is that something that you think about when you're acting, or\n\nsomething that you think either exists or doesn't--that one projects?\n\nMr. CUSACK: I would imagine that would just be an aesthetic that someone\n\neither has or they don't. You know, it would have to do with maybe their\n\nmind\n\nracing around a bit too fast for their own good, or maybe something more\n\npoetic, I don't know. But it's--I don't quite know why that is, but some\n\npeople just have a certain complexity to their personalities that comes\n\nthrough on film.\n\nGROSS: I think that is also key in \"Being John Malkovich,\" where you play\n\nthe\n\navante-garde puppeteer.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Real malcontent.\n\nMr. CUSACK: It's been a season for malcontents for me.\n\nGROSS: Yes, right. Did that movie, the \"Being John Malkovich,\" where you\n\nplayed the avant-garde puppeteer give you a chance to work through the\n\npretentiousness of some bad avante-garde art that, I'm sure, you were\n\nexposed\n\nto?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, yeah. I knew those guys. And I've known a lot of them\n\nover\n\nthe years and--but also, I mean, I sort of know that person, you know,\n\nwithout\n\ngetting Bravo channel about it all. I knew that person within myself too.\n\nI\n\nmean, there's a part of every, you know, actor or artist, I think, that\n\ntakes\n\nhimself incredibly seriously and thinks that his perceptions and feelings\n\nand\n\nintuitions are a great burden because of their depth. And so I sort of had\n\na\n\nwonderful time playing that sort of pompous, arrogant character. It's a lot\n\nof fun to do that stuff.\n\nGROSS: What did you first think of the script when you read it?\n\nMr. CUSACK: \"Being John Malkovich\"?\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. CUSACK: I thought--I read it five years ago, before it was even an idea\n\nto be made; it was just a writing sample from this brilliant writer named\n\nCharlie Kaufman. And I could conceive of a world where Charlie would write\n\nthat script, but I couldn't conceive of a world where someone would finance\n\nthat as a film. But just, you know, to be safe I told my agents, I said,\n\n`This is a film I want to do. If anyone else does this film and you lose\n\ntrack of it, you know, I'm off to another agency because this is the most\n\noriginal piece of writing I think I've ever read.' And I imagine that\n\nwould--that would've been what it would be like to read, you know, \"Python,\"\n\nwhen it first came out, \"The Monty Python\" script or something, just a\n\ncompletely original comic voice. So when I found out that it was financed\n\nand\n\nI said, `Well, if it's financed, that means John must be doing it--John\n\nMalkovich must be doing it.' And I know John, so I called him up and he\n\nsaid,\n\n`Oh yeah, you should do it.' And so I jumped at the chance.\n\nGROSS: Did things play out differently on screen than you had imagined it\n\nfrom your reading of the script?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Not at all. The script was really, you know, a brilliant\n\ndocument. And, I mean, Spike and Charlie worked on it a bit, but it was all\n\nthere on the page. And it sort of cried out for the actors to really play\n\nit\n\nas a drama. I mean, it was very--it just had a completely unique tone. It\n\nwas completely absurd and inventive and kept topping itself in ways you\n\ncouldn't imagine. But it was emotionally very, very straightforward, so you\n\njust had the sense that, you know, you can never get caught winking at the\n\ncamera and you can't get caught enjoying the madness of the piece that must\n\nbe\n\nplayed with pure emotional sincerity. And if you do that, you know, we have\n\na\n\nchance at doing something new, which doesn't really come up that often.\n\nGROSS: Did you need a chiropractor or an Alexander teacher after working in\n\nthe set with the floors like half the height of a regular floor?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, they actually had a chiropractor sort of on the set,\n\nso...\n\nGROSS: Oh, really?\n\nMr. CUSACK: ...you know, at lunch you'd see--you'd just hear these terrible\n\npopping and cracking sounds and people would be lined to be adjusted. But\n\nthen I thought maybe that they just made the set on that floor because I was\n\na\n\nlot taller and Spike and Charlie are short guys and they could walk around\n\ndown there. And so that was just sort of their revenge against those of us\n\nover, you know, 5'7\".\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is John Cusack.\n\nYour sister Joan Cusack has a role in \"High Fidelity.\" You've worked with\n\nher\n\nin several of your films. Is it important to you, when possible, to have\n\nher\n\nin movies that you're making?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, it's important to me and it seems to be important to the\n\npeople that I'm making the movies with. If there's a role that Joanie's\n\nright\n\nfor, you know, when we start casting, they all just sort of look at me and\n\ngo,\n\n`Can you get your sister?' Because everybody wants Joanie, because she's so\n\nfabulous. And I know I'm biased, but I think a lot of people share my\n\nopinion\n\nof her work. So the idea of getting her to come in and do a week or two on\n\nthe film is kind of a no-brainer.\n\nGROSS: She's a few years older than you. How many was it?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Let's see.\n\nGROSS: Four?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: So she started acting first in a children's theater in Chicago. How\n\ndid you get started in it? Did your parents think, `Well, he's nine now;\n\nit's\n\ntime to send him over there'?\n\nMr. CUSACK: No, I think, you know, I'd seen Joan and my sister Ann perform\n\nwith this theater in suburban Chicago; and, you know, it just seemed sort of\n\nlike a magical place. It seemed like those people up there were doing all\n\nthese fun things and they were getting a lot of attention. There was a\n\nwhole\n\naudience full of people who were quietly watching them, with sort of rapt\n\nattention. And so I said, `That looks fun. I've got to try that.' And I\n\ntried it, and I think it was just a great way to get people to pay attention\n\nto you.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that's how it starts?\n\nMr. CUSACK: I think so. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You did your first movie when you were 16. The movie was \"Class.\"\n\nTell us a little of what the plot was.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, let's see, that was the Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy vehicle\n\nback in around 1983 and...\n\nGROSS: It was the whole Rob Lowe era.\n\nMr. CUSACK: It was the Rob Lowe era, yes. We were all a part of that. And\n\nI believe it was two people who were in a prep school, and one of the\n\nroommates has an affair with the other one's mother, played by the glorious\n\nJacqueline Bisset. So I was kind of in the right place at the right time.\n\nI\n\nwas 16 and they were making films about teen-agers and they made two of them\n\nin Chicago. And since I had been in the theater and I sort of had my chops\n\nup, I guess I had an instinct for auditioning and I got those roles. And\n\nthat's what really started to give me a career.\n\nGROSS: So it was \"Class\" and \"Sixteen Candles\"?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Did the kids that you played in those movies reflect your character\n\nat\n\nall, or the kids that you knew in high school, or did these just seem like\n\nmovie people?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Let's see, I think, certainly when I was in \"Class,\" I was--you\n\nknow, I always thought--where I probably had the instinct that the first\n\nthing\n\nyou do is sort of play yourself, and if you can get comfortable as yourself\n\nin\n\nfront of the camera, then you can start to play different aspects of\n\nyourself\n\nand different characters. So I think when I was in \"Class,\" I, you know,\n\ntried to play a version of myself, or maybe who I'd like to be, or a part of\n\nme that I thought would be funny--or, you know, if I was in a prep-school\n\nwhat\n\nwould I be like? You know, I think that's the thought process that goes\n\nthrough a 16-year-old actor's mind.\n\nGROSS: Tell us something about what you were like when you were in high\n\nschool.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well I just couldn't wait to get out of high school and, you\n\nknow, I just really hated it, if I remember correctly.\n\nGROSS: Why?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, I don't know, probably for the same reasons that most\n\neveryone does, you know. Feeling like you were just required to, you know,\n\nretain data rather than think or, you know, all the cliques and, you know,\n\nsort of the social stuff seemed kind of disgusting. You know, that kind of\n\nthing.\n\nGROSS: I would imagine you were pretty highly regarded in high school\n\nbecause\n\nyou were making movies.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, I really wasn't highly regarded in high school and then\n\nwhen I started making movies, of course, I was, which was another valuable\n\nlesson.\n\nGROSS: Oh, an early introduction into hypocrisy.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yes. Yes. I mean, I didn't really get much play with the\n\nladies. But then, all of a sudden, when I did a few films, I was taking the\n\njocks' girls.\n\nGROSS: Well, did you try to teach anybody a lesson?\n\nMr. CUSACK: No. Not me. No, ma'am.\n\nGROSS: You told Premiere magazine that when you were young you had this\n\nbizarre amount of focus that came from a competitive desire to prove\n\nyourself.\n\nYou said, `I'd walk into an audition with an attitude like, if I'm in this\n\nroom, you damn sure are going to look at me.' Tell me more about that\n\nattitude when you went into an audition.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, I just sort of--I don't know, I think auditioning is a\n\ntotally different muscle than acting. And right now, if I had to audition\n\nfor\n\nmy parts, I would probably be doing community theater. It's just a totally\n\ndifferent muscle. But what I've figured out is that when you walk through\n\nthat door, you know, no one's going to want to wait for you to warm up.\n\nThey're not going to want to wait for you to sort of get loose and rev your\n\nengines up. You sort of have to come through that door already going 60.\n\nThey don't want to wait for you to go from zero to 60. So you really sort\n\nof\n\nhave to make an impact and get to a performance level right away. You have\n\nto\n\nget someone's attention, and they're looking for sort of solutions and\n\nanswers, so you have to come in and be an answer. So I really sort of, you\n\nknow, would listen to whatever music would get me revved up and sort of\n\ndefiant and then just sort of try to channel my energy into focus.\n\nGROSS: What music would that have been?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, God, at the time probably some Who song or something\n\nridiculous like that.\n\nGROSS: Now would you be relying on ego power to get that, `I am here. All\n\neyes are on me' sense, or would you use acting skills to do it?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, clearly not the acting skills. I think--it's not really\n\nlike an ego--well, I guess it is an ego that you feel like you're better\n\nthan\n\nsomeone. You feel like you're the best person for the part. But it's much\n\nmore of like a focusing of your energies and a concentration so that, you\n\nknow, you're very, very alive, and you're in a state of flow, but yet you're\n\nvery precise with the text and, you know, you have to come in and give a\n\nvery\n\nconfident impression of yourself. So I just decided, you know, that's just\n\nnot going to happen. I'm going to have to sort of work my way up to that,\n\nget\n\nto that state, get to that place. And I think that's really what\n\nauditioning\n\nis all about and a lot of people don't understand that. You know, you\n\nreally\n\nhave to make it a mini performance.\n\nCLOWNEY: John Cusack speaking with Terry Gross. He's co-starring in the\n\nnew\n\nfilm \"America's Sweethearts,\" which opens today. We'll hear more of their\n\nconversation in the second half of today's show. I'm Peter Clowney and this\n\nis FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nCLOWNEY: Coming up on FRESH AIR, we continue our conversation with actor\n\nJohn\n\nCusack. And Henry Sheehan reviews \"America's Sweethearts.\"\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nCLOWNEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Peter Clowney sitting in for Terry Gross.\n\nLet's return to Terry's interview with John Cusack, who co-stars in the new\n\nfilm \"America's Sweethearts.\"\n\n(Soundbite of interview)\n\nGROSS: One of your early breakthrough roles was \"The Sure Thing,\" in which\n\nyou played a freshman in college who isn't getting the girls like he thinks\n\nhe\n\nshould. Then a friend in Los Angeles tells him that there's a gorgeous\n\nyoung\n\nwoman in LA who's a sure thing and so all your character has to do is get a\n\nride to LA. What effect did this film have on your career?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, that sort of gave me a career, really. Because I'd been\n\ndoing--I'd done two supporting roles in films and then I was--I'd take my\n\nmoney from that and I was flying out to Los Angeles and sleeping on my\n\nagent's\n\ncouch and, you know, doing auditions. And Rob Reiner gave me my first\n\nbreak.\n\nAnd he gave me a lead in the film and so--and the film did pretty well\n\ncritically and commercially, and so I was kind off to the races.\n\nGROSS: I want to play a short scene from the film, and this is a...\n\nMr. CUSACK: From \"The Sure Thing?\"\n\nGROSS: From \"The Sure Thing,\" yeah.\n\nMr. CUSACK: My God. Wow.\n\nGROSS: This is the scene--you're hitch-hiking--well, you have a ride to Los\n\nAngeles--a ride with a couple of strangers because you want to...\n\nMr. CUSACK: Am I required to listen to this?\n\nGROSS: Yes, you are.\n\nMr. CUSACK: All right.\n\nGROSS: So, you've just gotten this ride to LA, and as you get into the back\n\nseat, you realize that this woman--this young freshman who has been tutoring\n\nyou, who you don't get along with, is the other passenger. So, Tim Robbins\n\nis\n\nthe driver in the car who's giving them a lift, and the scene starts with\n\nTim\n\nRobbins and his girlfriend introducing everybody in the car.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Sure Thing\")\n\nMs. LISA JANE PERSKY (As Mary Ann Webster): Are you Gib?\n\nMr. CUSACK (As Walter \"Gib\" Gibson): Yeah.\n\nMs. PERSKY: Hi, welcome aboard. I'm Mary Ann Webster.\n\nMr. TIM ROBBINS (As Gary Cooper): And I'm Gary Cooper. But not the Gary\n\nCooper that's dead. Hop in!\n\nMs. PERSKY: Alison, this is Gib.\n\nMr. ROBBINS: And Gib, this is Alison.\n\nMs. DAPHNE ZUNIGA (As Alison Bradbury): I knew I should have taken the bus.\n\nMr. CUSACK (As Walter \"Gib\" Gibson): Why? And wind up sitting next to some\n\nsleaze bag--some sleaze bag you don't know?\n\nMs. PERSKY: Oh! You two know each other!\n\nMr. CUSACK: We're old friends.\n\nMs. ZUNIGA: We're not old friends. We're acquaintances--very distant\n\nacquaintances.\n\nMr. ROBBINS: Kids, come on. Let's make this a fun trip, OK?\n\nMs. PERSKY: You guys know any show tunes?\n\nMr. ROBBINS: That's a great idea! `When the moon is in the seventh\n\nhouse...'\n\nMs. PERSKY: `...and Jupiter lines with Mars...'\n\nMr. ROBBINS: `...well then peace will guide the planets...'\n\nMs. PERSKY and Mr. ROBBINS: (In unison) `...and love will steer the skies.\n\nThis is the dawning of the age of Aquarius. The age of Aquarius...'\n\n(End of movie soundbite)\n\nGROSS: Oh, John Cusack, I chose that scene because I think that's the first\n\nscene that you did with Tim Robbins, with whom you've become good friends\n\nand...\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...you're in his film \"Cradle Will Rock.\" He's in \"High Fidelity,\"\n\nin\n\na small, but very funny role. So was this your first scene together?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, that's where I met Tim. That's where I met Tim. He was\n\n26 and I was 16.\n\nGROSS: Wow.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, it was a long time ago.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Yeah, what was it about you that connected?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, I think he's, you know, a very deranged individual in a\n\nlot of ways, so we just along great--and very, very funny and smart and so\n\nwe\n\njust became fast friends.\n\nGROSS: Now I know that you created a theater company, I think, in Chicago,\n\ncalled New Crime Theater, that I read was inspired by the one that Tim\n\nRobbins\n\nhad created. Is that true?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah. Well, Tim was in a theater company called The Actors'\n\nGang. And when we did \"The Sure Thing,\" we became friends and, you know,\n\nhad\n\nsimilar interests in films and plays. And then I think what happened was we\n\nwere in New York somewhere together, Tim and I, and I think Reagan had\n\nbombed\n\nLibya. And we found it such a depressing time--well, all the Reagan\n\nadministration seemed like a horribly depressing time. But that moment we\n\nfelt was so horrible that we decided to go off and just, you know, do some\n\npiece of political theater about that. And I went out and worked with The\n\nActors' Gang and did a play with them. I was introduced to the committee\n\ndel\n\narte(ph) style.\n\nActually, I'd been introduced to it earlier. I'd come out and we'd done a\n\nworkshop with--he was working with some people at UCLA and the Theatric de\n\nSoule(ph) in Paris, George Begow(ph). And I'd come out and done that with\n\nhim. And then once Reagan bombed Libya, we decided to go do a play, and\n\nthat\n\nwas when I worked with The Actors' Gang. And then later I took that style,\n\nthat I had learned, and started a company in Chicago. And Tim came out and\n\nwe\n\ndid a play there, and so it was just sort of like--yeah, it was kind of like\n\na\n\nbrother-sister company kind of thing.\n\n(End of interview soundbite)\n\nCLOWNEY: John Cusack talking with Terry Gross. We'll hear more of their\n\nconversation after this break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nCLOWNEY: Let's return to our interview with John Cusack. Cusack co-stars\n\nin\n\nthe film \"America's Sweethearts,\" which opens today.\n\n(Soundbite of interview)\n\nGROSS: Let me get to your movie \"Say Anything,\" which is, I think, another\n\nearly role that really helped establish you. And in this you play someone\n\nin\n\nhigh school who falls in love with the class valedictorian. But you have no\n\nacademic gifts and she's like the really smart one so this seems to a lot of\n\npeople like an incredible mismatch. You're also kind of directionless\n\noutside\n\nof your love for kick boxing. So in this scene you're at a dinner at your\n\ngirlfriend's father's house, and all the adults at the table are asking you\n\nquestions to figure out whether you're a worthy boyfriend.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Say Anything\")\n\nUnidentified Man #1: So Lloyd, you graduated Lakewood, right?\n\nMr. CUSACK (As Lloyd Dobler): Yes sir.\n\nUnidentified Man #1: What are you going to do now?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Have a life. I don't have any plans for the future. Spend as\n\nmuch time as possible with Diane before she leaves.\n\nUnidentified Man #2: Seriously, Lloyd.\n\nMr. CUSACK: I'm totally and completely serious.\n\nUnidentified Man #2: No, really.\n\nMr. CUSACK: You mean a career? I don't know. I've thought about this\n\nquite\n\na bit, sir. And I would have to say considering what's waiting out there\n\nfor\n\nme, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a\n\ncareer. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed or buy anything\n\nsold or processed, or process anything sold, bought or processed. Or repair\n\nanything sold, bought or processed. You know, as a career I don't want to\n\ndo\n\nthat. So, my father's in the Army. He wants me to join, but I can't work\n\nfor\n\nthat corporation. So what I've been doing lately is kick boxing. Which is\n\na\n\nnew sport, but I think it's got a good future. As far as career longevity,\n\nI\n\ndon't really know because you can't really tell ...(unintelligible) six as a\n\nfighter, you know, it's no good. You know, you have to be great. But I\n\ncan't\n\nreally tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I\n\nhaven't\n\nbeen knocked out yet. I don't know. I can't figure it all out tonight, so\n\nI'm just going to hang out with your daughter.\n\n(End of movie soundbite)\n\nGROSS: John Cusack in a scene from \"Say Anything.\" There's some very funny\n\nline readings in that. Did you do those lines many different ways before\n\nfiguring out how you wanted to do it for the actual shoot?\n\nMr. CUSACK: No, not really. What I did was--Cameron and I were working on\n\nthat scene and...\n\nGROSS: This is Cameron Crowe the director.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Cameron Crowe--I'm sorry. Cameron Crowe and I were working on\n\nthat scene, and we sort of wrote that speech together because I felt like--I\n\nfelt like there was a lot more that we could say. And we really wanted to\n\nsort of give him a sort of distinct worldview. And it was sort of a\n\nworldview\n\nthat, I guess, matched my own when I was--I was that age so when I was 20,\n\n21.\n\nIt was sort of about fears of joining into a society that you don't quite\n\nreally understand or have a lot of respect for in a lot of ways. So, it\n\nwasn't really line readings, as much as once we sort of--Cameron and I were\n\nworking and we just came out with that rap. And then we just sort of said,\n\n`All right. That's it. Let's do it.' And then we just tried it a couple\n\ndifferent ways. We tried a few of them longer, a few of them shorter. But\n\nit's not really about line readings as much as it is just sort of getting\n\ninto\n\nthe right kind of state of flow, I think.\n\nGROSS: I think some people who get started in, you know, quote, \"youth\n\nfilms,\" have a hard time getting out of it and having adult careers. Were\n\nyou\n\never worried about that? Was that ever a problem?\n\nMr. CUSACK: I was never really worried about it because when I was playing\n\nteen-agers and young people I was a teen-ager and young person. So I always\n\njust sort of assumed, maybe naively, that when I got older I'd play older\n\nroles. So, I didn't have that worry. I mean, you know, of course, when\n\nyou're younger you want to do more substantial stuff. And you always think\n\nthat there's better roles waiting for you as you get older. But I didn't\n\nhave\n\nthat kind of concern.\n\nGROSS: Did you go to drama school?\n\nMr. CUSACK: No, I didn't.\n\nGROSS: How come?\n\nMr. CUSACK: I never did. Well, I always thought that--I mean, I was\n\nworking\n\nalready, in films. I mean, I'd done three films and a lead in a film before\n\nI\n\ngraduated high school. And I had had a lot of training at the Piven Theatre\n\nWorkshop, you know, in Chicago and Evanston, so I'd been doing theater and\n\nworking. And I always sort of thought that, you know, the people I met who\n\nhad sort of gone to theater school and stuff, they always seemed to be--I\n\ndon't know, they seemed to be sort of--there's something precious about\n\nthem.\n\nThis is just my own opinion. I'm not saying it's true. But there used to\n\nbe\n\nsomething sort of precious about it all. And I always thought, `Well, if\n\nyou're going to go to college, you should learn about everything else you\n\ndon't know,' because you can get a lot of experience acting by just doing it\n\nand working with great people. So when I went to NYU I was studying liberal\n\narts for a semester. I wasn't studying theater.\n\nGROSS: A whole semester, huh?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, I made it all the way through.\n\nGROSS: You dropped out after that?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, I went--well, I had sort of too much fire in the belly\n\nreally. I wasn't ready to go to school because I was working and I was\n\ngetting offers. And I really wanted to work.\n\nGROSS: John Cusack is my guest. Let me get to another film that, I think,\n\nshowed a completely different side of you from your earlier films. And I'm\n\nthinking of \"The Grifters.\" You know, after playing all these like lovable,\n\nloser teen-age roles, in \"The Grifters,\" you played a guy in his mid-20s who\n\nis a con artist and his mother, played by Anjelica Huston, is a long-time\n\ncon\n\nartist. And his girlfriend, played by Annette Bening, is a con artist, too.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, Roy was doomed from the day he was born. That's what I\n\nuse to say.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. And it's a terrific film. A kind of film noir, contemporary\n\nfilm noir. And instead of--I mean, you're really opaque in this movie. I\n\nmean, it's hard--you watch this movie and you know your character is always\n\nthinking, but you're not necessarily sure what. And you're not quite a\n\nbenign\n\ncharacter in this either.\n\nMr. CUSACK: What do you mean by that?\n\nGROSS: Well, in your other movies, even if you're kind of a loser or you're\n\nthoughtless about something, you're not dangerous in the way that this\n\ncharacter has the potential of being, although he seems to have this kind of\n\ndecency beneath. But you're kind of braced for any kind of surprise,\n\nbecause\n\nthe character is so opaque. Let me play a scene from the movie. This is a\n\nscene with Annette Bening, who plays your girlfriend in the movie. And she\n\nhas a scheme for this really ambitious con that she wants to team up with\n\nyou\n\non. And you've been taught the hard way that it's dangerous to have a\n\npartner\n\nfor a con man, so you don't want to go along with the plan to be partners.\n\n(Soundbite from movie \"The Grifters\")\n\nMs. ANNETTE BENING (As Myra Langtry): What's going on? Why don't you want\n\nto team up?\n\nMr. CUSACK (As Roy Dillon): The best reason I can think of is that you\n\nscare\n\nthe hell out of me. I have seen women like you before, baby. You're double\n\ntough and you are sharp as a razor and you get what you want or else. But\n\nyou\n\ndon't make it work forever. Sooner or later the lightning hits, and I'm not\n\ngoing to be around when it hits you.\n\nMs. BENING: My God, it's your mother. It's Lily.\n\nMr. CUSACK: What?\n\nMs. BENING: Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.\n\nMr. CUSACK: What's that?\n\nMs. BENING: Oh, don't act so God damned innocent. You and your own mother?\n\nOh, you like to go back where you've been, huh?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Watch your mouth.\n\nMs. BENING: Yeah, see, I'm wise to you. I should have seen it before, you\n\nrotten son of a bitch. How is it? Huh? How do you like it when...\n\n(Soundbite of fighting and sobbing)\n\nMs. BENING: Ow. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.\n\nMr. CUSACK: That's not like me. I don't do this. That's why we wouldn't\n\nwork together. You're disgusting. Your mind is so filthy it's hard to look\n\nat you. Goodbye.\n\n(End of movie soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's a great scene. John Cusack, what did \"The Grifters\" enable\n\nyou\n\nto do that you hadn't done on film before?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, I'd say a kind of a level of sophistication and drama that\n\nI'd never had an opportunity to do, not even close.\n\nGROSS: Stephen Frears, who also directed your new movie \"High Fidelity,\"\n\ndirected \"The Grifters.\" What did you have to do when you auditioned for\n\nthis\n\npart to prove that you could play somebody as tough as this character is and\n\nas--both tough and vulnerable, but not the kind of like more kind of cute,\n\nlovable, loser role that you'd been playing in the teen movies.\n\nMr. CUSACK: The cute, lovable, loser role. Well, I think what happened was\n\nI'd read \"The Grifters,\" and I was a fan of Jim Thompson from high school.\n\nAnd when Stephen wanted to meet me, you know, I told him that I had always\n\nwanted to do the book. And I'd actually tried to option the book, I\n\nremember,\n\nwhen I was 19 or 20 because I thought it was so great. I thought it was\n\nthis\n\ngreat definition of, you know, a pulp crime novel and Greek tragedy--I just\n\nthought it was so fantastic. And so I went to meet him, and I think it was\n\nat\n\nthe Algonquin Hotel. And Stephen is a very strange, strange, strange man,\n\nwonderful man, but very, very odd processes. And he met me in the Algonquin\n\nHotel. And I sat down and he just started circling me. He just started\n\nwalking around me, looking at me, sort of rubbing his lip. And so what I\n\ndid--I just looked back. And he turned around and said--he went behind me,\n\nand I turned my chair around and followed him around. And we just sort of\n\ndid\n\nthis dance. And then we started talking about the film, and talking about\n\nthe\n\nscript, and the book. And then that was it. I never auditioned. He just\n\nhired me.\n\nGROSS: That's great. In one of the first scenes, you're doing a con in\n\nthat\n\nscene. You're at a bar. You hold up a 20 to the bar tender. And as you\n\nactually give him the bill, you're making eye contact with him so he can't\n\nsee\n\nthat you've replaced the 20 with a 10. I'm wondering where you learned the\n\ngrifts from. Are these grifts from the book?\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, many of the grifts are from the book. But we also\n\nbrought\n\nin a lot of professional cheaters and some experts on the subject, like\n\nRicky\n\nJay(ph)--he came on in. And we actually found a few mechanics--mechanics\n\nare\n\npeople who do that for a living. And they came in and they gave me little\n\ntutorials on lying and deception. It was a great way to spend a September.\n\nGROSS: I imagine you learned a lot about acting from that, because that's\n\nwhat these guys have to do is act.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Well, I learned a lot about how to play the character from\n\nthose\n\nguys, because they were almost like--you said opaque, and I mean, they were\n\nalmost like invisible. You'd be in a room with them and they'd be the most\n\nkind of personable guys, but they'd be guys who you'd leave the room and you\n\ncouldn't remember what they were wearing or what they really looked like.\n\nOr\n\nthere's was nothing distinctive about them. They were just--they were kind\n\nof\n\njust non-persons. And I think it's by choice because they don't want to be\n\nremembered or noticed. So they were kind of fascinating characters.\n\nGROSS: But I'm wondering if even you learned about things like eye contact\n\nin\n\nways you hadn't before--like using your eyes to divert somebody when you're\n\ndoing a con on them.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Or to hold their attention so they don't see the slip of the hand.\n\nYou know, they don't see what your hands are doing.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Yeah, I mean, most--I think mostly you find out that it's--I\n\nmean, you find out about all of these diversions and you find out\n\nabout--that\n\nthere's a real power in not asserting any aggressive energy. So you do sort\n\nof learn about the great power of restraint. But more than anything else\n\nyou\n\nfind out that the grifts are just about having information that the other\n\nperson doesn't have in many various forms. You just have some information\n\nthat he doesn't have and that makes him very, very gullible.\n\nGROSS: You said that when you were young acting was about getting\n\nattention--this was when you were really young--like nine, 10. What's\n\nacting\n\nabout to you now?\n\nMr. CUSACK: I just think it's about expression and trying to tell stories\n\nand find out how people are alike, you know, what it means to be kind of\n\nhuman\n\nand go through the same experiences. And I think it's just a very personal\n\nform of expression that--it's a strange one because it's such a--you know,\n\nthere's not a more expensive art form in history. And there's so much money\n\nand pressure about it, but ultimately it comes down to these very, very,\n\nvery\n\npersonal kind of performances, on this large scale. So I just--I'm sort of\n\nhooked.\n\nGROSS: John Cusack, a real pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much\n\nfor\n\nbeing with us.\n\nMr. CUSACK: Oh, thank you for having me.\n\n(End of interview soundbite)\n\nCLOWNEY: John Cusack spoke last year with Terry Gross. He co-stars in the\n\nnew film \"America's Sweethearts,\" which opens today. What does our film\n\ncritic think of \"America's Sweethearts\"? A review coming up after this\n\nbreak.\n\nI'm Peter Clowney and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: New movie \"America's Sweethearts\"\n\nPETER CLOWNEY, host:\n\n\"America's Sweethearts\" is a new backstage comedy about Hollywood. It stars\n\nBilly Crystal, who also co-wrote the film, as a veteran press agent. Julia\n\nRoberts is a harried personal assistant to her movie star sister played by\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones. And John Cusack is the movie star's movie star\n\nhusband.\n\nFilm critic Henry Sheehan has a review.\n\nHENRY SHEEHAN reporting:\n\n\"America's Sweethearts\" promises all sorts of send-ups of Hollywood egos and\n\npractices. But its most shocking revelation isn't a joke at all: It's that\n\npeople in the movie business consider Larry King a tough interviewer. Yes,\n\nthe king of the journalistic big, wet kiss, who naturally plays himself in\n\nthis wet noodle of a farce, is portrayed as a dangerous, probing\n\ninterrogator.\n\nLess an insider's satire of the movie business and a primer for\n\npsychiatrists\n\nspecializing in self-delusion, \"America's Sweethearts\" focuses an occluded\n\nlens on the fun-house mirror world of Hollywood publicity.\n\nThis distortion of a distortion does feature a handful of straightforward\n\npleasures. Billy Crystal, who co-wrote the script and produced the film,\n\nhas\n\nmade sure that his character, publicist Lee Phillips, has a suitable ration\n\nof\n\nbelly laugh inducing one-liners. And Julia Roberts, who is now in the\n\nunexpected prime of a solid career, demonstrates that the last hurdle\n\nbetween\n\nher and greatness is her inability to pick a good script. But what's really\n\ninteresting about this film is how it reveals the weird perspective of stars\n\nand apparently studio executives.\n\nThe movie's directed by Joe Roth. Now running his own hybrid operation\n\nafter\n\nheading the Disney and Fox film studios, Roth isn't much of a director. His\n\nmodel seems to be the railroad station master who keeps trains running on\n\ntime. But this isn't just a filmmaking blemish, it's an insight, for if\n\nRoth\n\nthinks he has done a fine job directing, that explains why so many mediocre\n\ndirectors have found Hollywood sinecures while legitimate talents have gone\n\nbegging. Roth and his ilk think clumsy and quick is the way to go.\n\nThe movie takes place at a Nevada hotel, part of a chain, which gets plenty\n\nof\n\nfree plugs, where Crystal's Phillips is running a press junket. A junket is\n\none of those notoriously cushy gatherings where the entertainment press is\n\ninvited, often at a studio's expense, to spend a day or a weekend attending\n\nscreenings and doing interviews for soon-to-be released movies.\n\nIn tune with the movie's moral obtuseness, a number of journalists have\n\ntaken\n\nparts in the movie. How can they possibly pretend to maintain some sort of\n\ncritical distance ever again from Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, or Joe Roth\n\nin\n\ntheir future projects after having a high old time making a movie with them?\n\nAmidst all this corruption, Crystal and his writing partner Peter Tolan,\n\nslap\n\ndown a love story involving Roberts' character. She plays Kiki Harrison,\n\nthe\n\nsister of and personal assistant to movie star Gwen Harrison, played with an\n\nastonishing lack of wit by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Phillips, the publicist,\n\nis\n\ntrying to manufacture press interest in a movie by pretending that Gwen is\n\nreuniting with her long-time co-star and husband Eddie Thomas, played by\n\nJohn\n\nCusack. As much as Gwen is horribly egocentric, so Eddie is a pussy cat.\n\nThis naturally means he must be more suited to the doormat Kiki, though the\n\ndumb lug doesn't realize it yet. Here Crystal's Phillips and Roberts' Kiki\n\ndiscuss the vagaries of junket love.\n\n(Soundbite of movie \"America's Sweethearts\")\n\nMr. BILLY CRYSTAL (As Lee Phillips): What the hell happened?\n\nMs. JULIA ROBERTS (As Kiki Harrison): Bad morning, preceded by 33 bad\n\nyears.\n\nMr. CRYSTAL: Does this have something to do with Gwen?\n\nMs. ROBERTS: Of course not. I love my sister. I love everything about\n\nher.\n\n`Kiki, Kikikins, who's smoking? I smell smoke. Is someone smoking within a\n\nsix mile radius of where I'm standing? Stop them, Kiki! Stop them!'\n\nMa'am,\n\nthe butter. What? Are they out of butter? How can you run out of butter?\n\nMr. CRYSTAL: Well, I have one theory.\n\nMs. ROBERTS: You know what? I need an assistant. Because if I had an\n\nassistant, she would be outside right now milking a cow and I would never\n\never\n\nrun out of butter. `Oh Kiki, my butter has touched another food. I need\n\nnew\n\nbutter.' `Anything you want, honey.' That's the way it goes, Lee. Right?\n\nYou're a publicist, you know. Anything they want, right?\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nSHEEHAN: Sounds all right, doesn't it? Crystal and Roberts do seem to\n\nconnect a bit, so cleverly the filmmakers have insured that this is one of\n\nthe\n\nvery few scenes in the movie the two share. For the most part Crystal stars\n\nin a comedy vehicle, while Roberts leads a romance featuring the unpalatable\n\nJones and the awkwardly miscast and antsy Cusack. Yes, by all means, let's\n\nhave some fun about the personal lives of Hollywood citizens. Anything to\n\ndistract us from the despiriting mediocrity of their professional output.\n\nCLOWNEY: Henry Sheehan is film critic for the Orange County Register.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nProfile: Scott Merrill, Broadway actor, died at the age of 82\n\nPETER CLOWNEY, host:\n\nWe've learned that Broadway actor Scott Merrill died last month on June,\n\n28th.\n\nHe was 82. One of Merrill's most celebrated roles was as Macheath, Mack the\n\nKnife in Kurt Weill's \"The Threepenny Opera.\" From the 1954 production,\n\nhere's Scott Merrill singing \"Ballad of the Easy Life.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Ballad of the Easy Life\")\n\nMr. SCOTT MERRILL (As Macheath): (Singing) They tell you that the best in\n\nlife is mental. Just to starve yourself and do a lot of reading, up in some\n\ngarret where the rats are breeding. Should you survive, it's purely\n\naccidental. If that's your pleasure, go on, live that way.

So listen closely to Mack the\n\nKnife.\n\nThe bulging pocket makes the easy life.\n\nNow once I use to think it might be worthy to be a brave and sacrificing\n\nperson. I soon found out it wasn't reimbursing, decided to continue being\n\nearthy. The noble boar are nobly underfed. And being brave will bring an\n\nempty fame. You're all alone with no one else to blame. You're mingling\n\nwith\n\nthe great but you are dead. Where's the percentage? Ask Mack the Knife.\n\nThe\n\nbulging pocket makes the easy life.\n\nCLOWNEY: Scott Merrill as Macheath in \"The Threepenny Opera.\" Merrill died\n\nlast month. He was 82.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)"
