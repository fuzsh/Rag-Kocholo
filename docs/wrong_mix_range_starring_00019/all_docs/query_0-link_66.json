        "text": "Some movies feature scenes so romantic that you can't help but swoon — think Casablanca, The Princess Bride, Gone With the Wind. Others are supposed to drum up those warm and fuzzy feelings — and are even hyped by critics and audiences as super-romantic — but on closer inspection, come across as weird/creepy/bordering on stalker-ish. Here's a look at some of those fine cinematic moments:\n\n1. Say Anything\n\nIt was a classic case of mismatched love: Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) was an underachiever, while Diane Court (Ione Skye) was her school's valedictorian. They gave romance a go the summer after they graduated from high school, but with too many outside influences, things became rocky. So what does Lloyd do to win Diane back? Stands outside her window holding a boombox playing Peter Gabriel, of course! Everyone thought it was so adorable that he stood so stoically outside, but if this was real life Diane would have requested a better song and probably would have called the cops. There's nothing sweet about trespassing.\n\n2. The Notebook\n\nEveryone gushes about how this movie is just so romantic and how Ryan Gosling (as Noah) is just the dreamiest guy ever. That could be true, if you overlook the fact that he emotionally blackmailed Rachel McAdams (Allie) into going out with him. First he climbs onto a moving Ferris Wheel like a lunatic, then he threatens to let go of the wheel and fall to his certain death if Allie doesn't agree to a date. Conning a girl into going out with you — even if you are an otherwise stand up guy — is creepy and sounds like the beginning of one of those unhealthy relationships they warned you about in health class.\n\n3. Love Actually\n\nIn a movie filled with multiple story lines, one stands out: Keira Knightley's Julia is approached by her husband's best friend, Mark, who silently tells her (thanks to giant cue cards) that he is madly in love with her and always will be. He leaves, she runs after to give him a kiss, and he announces, \"Enough, enough now,\" signaling that he's moving on and will stop pining for Julia. Well, how nice for him! He got all of that off his chest and feels great, but now she has to go around knowing that her husband's BFF has the hots for her; their next meeting is going to be awkward. Guys, don't follow this move unless you want the object of your affection to hate you.\n\n4. Never Been Kissed\n\nIf you started watching Never Been Kissed about 3/4 of the way through, you would think, \"Oh my gosh, Drew Barrymore and Michael Vartan are the cutest couple! I hope they make it!\" If you started watching Never Been Kissed at the beginning like most people, you would think, \"Oh my gosh, this 30-year-old man is falling in love with a girl who he thinks is his student! Didn't I see this on Dateline last night?\"\n\n5. Twilight\n\nBasically, pick a scene, any scene from the original or any of the sequels, and I guarantee it will give you the heebie jeebies."
