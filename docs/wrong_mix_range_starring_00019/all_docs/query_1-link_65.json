        "text": "Emma Freud — the partner of “Love Actually” director Richard Curtis — dishes on behind-the-scenes details of the original film to tease an upcoming sequel for charity. Freud says she worked on the 2003 hit not only as a “script editor,” but also as “kissing consultant” to Colin Firth, in a new column.\n\n“In 2002, I was the script editor for the movie ‘Love Actually.’ My boyfriend wrote and directed it so I literally slept my way into that job (and can highly recommend it as a way of operating),” Freud writes for The Reset. She adds, “One of my other roles was as the ‘Kissing Consultant’ (it IS a proper job, it IS) in the scene where Colin Firth proposes to Lucia Moniz in the Portuguese restaurant. My strongest memory of filming was how much it embarrassed my 7-year old when she saw us rehearsing my signature move with Colin (brushing a thumb gently over her bottom lip before leaning in), again and again. And again.”\n\nCurtis is currently making a “mini-sequel” to his 14-year-old quintessential rom-com with original stars including Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Bill Nighy, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Andrew Lincoln reprising their roles. The new film’s being made to benefit the Curtis’ Red Nose Day UK charity.\n\nFreud writes in her Reset column that today, “it’s one month until Red Nose Day UK, the fundraising event Richard (the boyfriend) invented and where I work as a Director (yup – slept my way into that one too),” and explains that “Red Nose Day Actually,” will be “10 minutes long, and through donations and sponsorship, it will end up making millions of pounds for people living in extreme poverty all over the world.”\n\nThe film airs on NBC on May 25.\n\nA teaser released this week shows the mini-movie’s stars each holding up cue cards — mimicking a climactic scene in the original. The cards read in part, “tune in to see what happened to everyone… And, amongst other things, which one of us has aged best.” Grant then holds up his card that asserts, “it’s not Colin Firth.”"
