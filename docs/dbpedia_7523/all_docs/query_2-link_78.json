        "text": "A six-figure deal to finance the Lega in view of the European elections. Russian money for the Italian nationalists of the Vice Prime Minster Matteo Salvini. The same who publicly announced that he was not interested in Vladimir Putin’s money, but only supported him because they were in political harmony. The deal to finance the Lega was brought forth during the last few months in absolute confidence. Meetings, trips, emails, handshakes and drafts of contracts worth millions. On one side of the table a loyal follower of Salvini, on the other a prestigious figure in Putin’s establishment. At the center, a stock of fuel such as “Gasoil EN 590 standards Udsl”. At least three million tons of diesel, given by a Russian company and purchased by an Italian company. Thanks to this sale the Kremlin would be able to fill the cash register of Salvini’s party on the eve of the European elections to be held next May. We must use the conditional because while we are writing, we do not know if the deal was sealed. However we can indicate various events that make up this international plot that certainly has taken place between Rome, Milan and Moscow. And above all we can reveal the aims declared: secretly support Salvini’s party. The right wing political force that is growing the most in Europe. According to the polls it is able to pull other sovereign movements in the Old Continent.\n\nThe deal to finance the Lega that we are reporting on L’Espresso is one of the chapters of “The Black Book of the Lega”, published by Laterza, coming out on February 28. An investigation on the dark side of Matteo Salvini’s party: from the 49 million euro scam, to the unfit candidates of southern Italy, up to the international sovereigns that goes from Moscow to Washington, passing through the Vatican.\n\nBut lets get back to the deal. Everything evolves around the former spokesman, Gianluca Savoini. Matteo’s «advisor»: as he is defined by the Russian media in the articles in which the activities of his Lombardy-Russian Cultural Association are praised as well as Lega’s stand against the sanctions imposed by Europe against Russia. Although Savoini has no official role in the party and in the government, he has always been present in Salvini’s official visits to Moscow. He sealed the alliance between Lega and Putin’s party, United Russia. He made dozens of trips to Moscow, in Crimea and in Donbass. He led the deal for the Russian financing right from the beginning.\n\nBut lets go in order, starting from an address. At number 31 of Novinsky Boulevard, a six-lane street in Moscow, three subway stops from the Red Square, there is a modern glass and concrete building. In the background the so-called “seven sisters” rise, the impressive skyscrapers Stalin had made the prisoners of the gulags build. On the ground floor of the building, there is a big shopping center, with shops and restaurants. Above there are the offices of some of the biggest multinational companies in the world: Exxon Mobil, Repsol, Shell, Glencore, Samsung. Instead on the fifth floor there is a rather unknown company. It is called Tsargrad; at least this is what the back-lit glass wall says at the entrance to the office. Who is it? It is one of the many companies belonging to the oligarch Kostantin Malofeev. A publishing company with a website and TV that is dedicated to transmitting religious messages in line with the conservative policies of the Kremlin. In the same office, at number 1, another two enterprises are registered. One is Marshall Capital, the investment fund of the Oligarch. The other is a small and unknown oil company. It is called Avangard Oil & Gas, it currently does not have a website (it disappeared from the Internet while we were finishing this investigation) nor is there a public presentation of its owners and its assets. Following Avangard we arrive directly to Savoini, Salvini’s representative in Russia. Some documents in fact prove that the former spokesman of the leader of Lega has been in direct contact with the managing director of Avangard, Alexey Mustafinov. The deal consisted in a commercial offer sent by the Russian oil company in July 2018 and received by Savoini. The purpose: the sale of a quantity of diesel. Subsequently, Avangard left the scene, but the deal did not vanish. Indeed.\n\nTHE OLIGARCH OF GOD\n\nBefore going into the details of the deal, it is useful to further understand the figure of Mr K that is Konstantin Valerevich Malofeev. The biggest connection between him and the Lega is Alexey Komov, his great friend, who on December 15, 2013 was present at the coronation of Salvini as secretary of the party at the Lingotto of Turin. Komov is the Russian ambassador of the World Congress of Families, an international association that fights against abortion, homosexual marriage and works for Malofeev in San Basilio, the biggest Russian foundation supported by private funds.\n\nMalofeev is a Muscovite Oligarch born in 1974, with a law degree and a financial expert who started his career by working for Russian banks. Then in 2005 he founded Marshall Capital, which today has become one of the most important investment companies in the country, with an important share, in the past in public companies of the Federation such as Rostelecom. The Muscovite financial expert is not only one of the local moneybags, he is very loyal to Putin and suspected by the United States and by the European Union of having financed the conquest of Crimea and the war in Donbass, the reason for which the United States Treasury and the European Council put him on the black list. He is also accused of having had an active role in the financial relations between the Kremlin and the French of Front National. As revealed by the newspaper “Mediapart” in 2015, the Russian billionaire would have in fact contributed in making the 9 million euro loan obtained by Marine Le Pen’s party, through a bank controlled by Moscow, easier (the First Czech Russian Bank) and another 2 million by a Cypriot company (the Vernonsia Holdings).\n\nScrolling down the list of Malofeev’s companies and foundations, we feel as if we are before a global economic empire. Some of these family companies take us to the British Virgin Islands, to the Seychelles, to Cyprus. Tax havens where capital is anonymous and can circulate with extreme ease. But this is not new for oligarchs like him. What is most interesting is the ideology of the person. And his connections with various extreme right wing European sovereignists. The Russian entrepreneur defines himself as a Monarch, hoping in the restoration of the Czar in Moscow. Who would be his ideal Czar? Obviously Vladimirovich. «He has never tried to be elected, he was found and put to work, in the end he was revealed as sent by God», he stated in 2017 to the British daily newspaper “The Guardian”. Malofeev is actually working on his absolutist project, the restoration of the Russian ancien régime. He even founded a college with this aim in mind. He called it the Great School of San Basilio, he wants to make it a prestigious institute where the élite of the new Russian Monarch can be bred, the one that will be able to «supply a backbone to the inevitable Czarist future» of the country.\n\nPUTIN'S PHILOSOPHY\n\nMalofeev knows that in order to achieve his political project he must also convince the élite, in the homeland as well abroad. Because on an international level, the aim is to form a new continent, a new geopolitical block led by Moscow. Eurasia. One of the structures created by the billionaire with this aim is the “analytic center”."
