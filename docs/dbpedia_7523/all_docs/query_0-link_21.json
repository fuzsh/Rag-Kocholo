        "text": "2 Min Read\n\nThe party led by Salvini has criticised the decision to increase military support for Ukraine, emphasising the need for diplomatic solutions. However, Defence Minister Crosetto reassures about the unity within the government, focusing on aiding Kyiv as essential for achieving a fair peace\n\nTensions within the governing majority in Rome… have escalated due to the positions of Matteo Salvini’s Lega party.\n\nAccording to Andrea Crippa, the deputy secretary of the Lega, “Given that Ukraine has been attacked and Russia is the aggressor, we must end this war and prioritise political and diplomatic solutions over weapons, missiles, and aircraft.”\n\nCrippa also noted, “At this time, there are continuous shipments of weapons resulting in deaths, yet there are no negotiations taking place to bring peace to Ukraine and Russia.”\n\nCritics have arisen… both from the opposition and within the majority. In an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto addressed accusations of escalating tensions with Russia, which followed the recent decision of the Italian government to increase military spending to reach the NATO 2% target and provide military support to Ukraine.\n\n“Working towards peace is the goal for all of us,” he stated.\n\nMinister Crosetto responded to these criticisms by emphasising that giving Ukraine the means to defend itself does not equate to not wanting peace. It means striving for a fair peace.\n\n“We must be logical,” he pointed out, “those who suggest not sending weapons are also implying that they do not want to assist the Ukrainians in defending themselves from the missiles that indiscriminately target hospitals, schools, and homes. You do not pursue peace by simply letting one side succumb.”\n\nAs tension… within the majority sparked debate, Crosetto clarified, “I have never encountered dissent from the Lega” when discussing the decree to provide weapons to Ukraine in either the Parliament or the Copasir, the Parliament’s Intelligence Committee.\n\nHe stated, “The important thing is to remain united on these issues rather than someone occasionally emphasising a position for publicity.”\n\nYou may also like\n\nThe Italian shipbuilder is expanding its sights to the underwater domain, set to become ever more strategic for Italy’s geopolitical and defence...\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive in Russia's Kursk region continues to challenge President Vladimir Putin, complicating his military strategy and domestic...\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail address:\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:"
