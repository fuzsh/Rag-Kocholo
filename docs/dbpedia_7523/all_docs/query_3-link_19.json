        "text": "In the next European elections \"I am convinced that the League will largely be the second force of the centre-right\". The leader of the League stated this, Matteo Salvini, speaking to the foreign press. “If being sovereign means defending the sovereignty of Italy then I am because sovereignty belongs to the people and not to the European Union. It's 2024 and we need to look beyond the cover. Those who divide the center-right in Europe are only serving the interests of multinationals, of Macron and of those who have an interest in ensuring that the war does not end,” she concluded.\n\n“We will never allow the sending of a single Italian or European soldier to fight and die in Ukraine and we will never allow, we will never give consent as a league, to the use of the weapons we sent to Kiev to defend itself, to attack in Russia \" he said.\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nClick here and receive updates on WhatsApp"
