        "text": "“Italy is not at war with Russia, our Constitution repudiates war, Italy is not entitled to attack Russia”. This was stated by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Matteo Salvini, on \"Radio Anch'io\" on Rai Radio1 on the situation in Ukraine. “On behalf of myself and the League, I will never allow a single missile or bomb to hit or kill civilians in Russia because I don't want to leave the world war on the doorstep to my children,” she added.\n\n“On the left they are in total confusion. A defensive alliance of free and democratic countries is essential. Defensive”, said Salvini on the dissolution of NATO proposed by some exponents of the centre-left. “NATO and the European community were not born to start war but to defend peace. There are too many people talking out of turn about war in this period,” he concluded.\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nClick here and receive updates on WhatsApp"
