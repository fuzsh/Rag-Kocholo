        "text": "Giorgia Meloni is poised to become Italy’s first female prime minister after leading her far-right party, the Brothers of Italy, to victory in national elections.\n\nIn a victory speech to her cheering supporters early Monday, Meloni, who has spoken out against what she calls “the LGBT lobby” and mass immigration, said it was “a night of pride and a night of redemption.”\n\nMeanwhile, Italy’s left warned of “dark days” ahead and vowed to keep Italy in the heart of Europe.\n\nNear-final results indicated that the center-right coalition netted some 44% of the vote, with Meloni’s Brothers of Italy snatching some 26%.\n\nHer coalition partners divided up the remainder, with the anti-immigrant League of Matteo Salvini winning 9% and the more moderate Forza Italia of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi taking around 8%.\n\nThe center-left Democratic Party and its allies had around 26%, while the 5-Star Movement — which had been the biggest vote-getter in 2018 parliamentary elections — saw its share of the vote halved to some 15% this time around.\n\nItaly’s lurch to the far right immediately shifted Europe’s geopolitics, placing a euroskeptic, anti-immigrant party in position to lead a founding member of the European Union and its third-largest economy.\n\nHowever, voter turnout was at a historic low — just 64%. Pollsters suggested voters stayed home in protest, disenchanted by the backroom deals that had created the last three governments.\n\nMeloni, whose party traces its origins to the postwar, neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, tried to sound a unifying tone in her speech Monday, noting that Italians had finally been able to determine their leaders.\n\n“If we are called to govern this nation, we will do it for everyone, we will do it for all Italians and we will do it with the aim of uniting the people,” Meloni said. “Italy chose us. We will not betray it as we never have.”\n\nWhile the center-right — led by Meloni’s more conservative party — was the clear winner, the formation of a government could take weeks and will involve consultations among party leaders and with President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nIn the meantime, outgoing Premier Mario Draghi remains in a caretaker role.\n\nThe elections, which took place some six months early after Draghi’s government collapsed in July, came at a crucial time for Europe as it faces Russia’s war in Ukraine and the related soaring energy costs that have hit ordinary Italians’ pocketbooks as well as industry.\n\nA Meloni-led government is largely expected to follow Italy’s current foreign policy, including her pro-NATO stance and strong support for supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend against Russia’s invasion, even as her coalition allies stake a slightly different tone.\n\nBoth Berlusconi and Salvini have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While both have distanced themselves from his invasion, Salvini has warned that sanctions against Moscow are hurting Italian industry, and even Berlusconi has excused Putin’s invasion as foisted on him by pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas.\n\nA bigger shift and one likely to cause friction with European powers will probably come over migration. Meloni has called for a naval blockade to prevent migrant boats from leaving North African shores, and has proposed screening potential asylum-seekers in Africa, before they set out on smugglers’ boats to Europe.\n\nSalvini made clear he wants the league to return to the interior ministry, where as minister he imposed a tough anti-migrant policy. But he may face an internal leadership challenge after the league suffered an abysmal result of under 10%, with Meloni’s party outperforming it in its northeastern stronghold.\n\nSalvini acknowledged the league was punished for its governing alliances with the 5-Stars and then Draghi, but said: “It’s a good day for Italy because it has five years of stability ahead of it.”\n\nOn relations with the European Union, analysts note that for all her euroskeptic rhetoric, Meloni moderated her message during the campaign and has little room to maneuver given the economic windfall Italy is receiving from Brussels in coronavirus recovery funds.\n\nItaly secured some 191.5 billion euros, the biggest chunk of the EU’s 750 billion euro recovery package, and is bound by certain reform and investment milestones it must hit to receive it all.\n\nThat said, Meloni has criticized the EU’s recent recommendation to suspend 7.5 billion euros in funding to Hungary over concerns about democratic backsliding, defending Viktor Orban as the elected leader in a democratic system.\n\nOrban’s political director, Balazs Orban, was among the first to congratulate Meloni. “In these difficult times, we need more than ever friends who share a common vision and approach to Europe’s challenges,” he tweeted.\n\nFrench far-right leader Marine Le Pen praised Meloni for having “resisted the threats of an anti-democratic and arrogant European Union.”\n\nSantiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox opposition party, tweeted that Meloni “has shown the way for a proud and free Europe of sovereign nations that can cooperate on behalf of everybody’s security and prosperity.”\n\nMeloni is chair of the right-wing European Conservative and Reformist group in the European Parliament, which gathers her Brothers of Italy, Poland’s Law and Justice Party, Spain’s Vox and the Sweden Democrats, which just won big in elections there on a platform of cracking down on crime and limiting immigration.\n\n“The trend that emerged two weeks ago in Sweden was confirmed in Italy,” acknowledged Democratic Party leader Enrico Letta, calling Monday a “sad day for Italy, for Europe.”\n\n“We expect dark days. We fought in every way to avoid this outcome,″ Letta said at a somber news conference. While acknowledging the future of the party and his own future required reflection, he vowed: “The PD will not allow Italy to leave the heart of Europe.”\n\nMeloni proudly touts her roots as a militant in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, which was formed in the aftermath of World War II with the remnants of Mussolini’s fascist supporters. Meloni joined in 1992 as a 15-year-old.\n\nDuring the campaign, Meloni was forced to respond after the Democrats used her party’s origins to paint Meloni as a danger to democracy.\n\n“The Italian Right has handed fascism over to history for decades now, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws,” she said in a multilingual campaign video.\n\nWith Post wires"
