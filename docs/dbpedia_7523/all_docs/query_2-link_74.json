        "text": "VFX house DNEG has appointed Paul Salvini as Global Chief Technology Officer.\n\nIn his new role, Salvini will be responsible for developing a “new and innovative technology vision” for the company, managing its global technology and R&D teams and overseeing technology initiatives across all of its key offerings: visual effects for film and episodic content, feature animation, stereo conversion, virtual production and its ReDefine division, which serves expanding international markets and independent filmmakers.\n\nIn recent years, DNEG has added new facilities in North America and India, and grown to over 7,000 employees across its global offices.\n\nBased in Canada, Salvini has more than 25 years of experience in C-Suite roles, including 15 years as CTO at SideFX, where he oversaw and guided the development of industry-standard visual effects and animation software tool Houdini from beta onwards. He also spent several years as CTO of audiovisual technology leader Christie Digital.\n\nMost recently, Salvini was CEO of The Accelerator Centre, a not-for-profit business accelerator that provides guidance, mentorship and support for technology start-ups.\n\nDNEG Global CTO Paul Salvini said: “Technology and science is playing an ever-more important role in the art and creativity of storytelling. I’ve been fortunate enough to have had a hand in many firsts during my career in the entertainment industry – from enabling collaboration for a newly emerging global talent-base of artists and technicians, to the development of software and processes that have fundamentally changed what is possible to achieve digitally. I feel that we are on the cusp of the next big change in our industry, and it is an honour for me to have the opportunity to explore the possibilities with a global leader of the caliber of DNEG.”\n\nDNEG CEO Namit Malhotra said: “Paul has a huge breadth of technical, academic and managerial experience and an entrepreneurial edge which makes him the perfect addition to our senior team as we begin the next phase of DNEG’s journey.\n\n“His industry credentials speak for themselves, and his academic and professional experience in fostering technical innovation, guiding research and development, mentoring creators and securing and commercializing IP reflects and supports our ambitions as we move forward in a very changed industry landscape.\n\n“If 2020 has done anything, it has proven the need for more innovation, more flexibility and new ways of thinking in order to continue offering the highest levels of quality and support to our filmmaking clients. With Paul’s strategic vision and direction, and our aspiration to be the very best in everything that we do, we are building a spirit of innovation that will rewrite ‘what’s next’ for our industry.”\n\nJon Creamer\n\nShare this story"
