        "text": "ROME — Italy’s Democratic Party will put forward a motion of no confidence against Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.\n\nThe opposition party’s announcement came after Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, refused to appear in parliament to answer lawmakers’ questions on allegations that his party has sought Russian funding.\n\nOn Wednesday, Salvini left it to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to address the Senate in his place.\n\nConte told lawmakers that he has “full confidence” in his interior minister and that there is no proof of any wrongdoing on Salvini’s part.\n\nThe prime minister also said that Salvini had not answered his questions about his aide Gianluca Savoini’s trip to Russia in October, when he reportedly met with Russian officials to discuss funneling millions of euros to the League via a secret oil deal.\n\nThe center-left Democratic Party deemed Conte’s explanation insufficient and said it is unacceptable that the minister refused to attend in person. Senator Andrea Marcucci said that Salvini had “escaped his responsibilities” and would therefore have to face a no-confidence vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the populist 5Stars Movement — the League’s coalition partner in government — exited the Senate hall when Conte began his address.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Wednesday evening that senators did so in protest against Salvini’s absence, but 5Stars lawmakers told reporters in the Senate that they walked out over Conte’s decision to green-light a controversial high-speed rail project.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s no-confidence motion is unlikely to pass, as for a majority in parliament, the 5Stars would have to vote against their coalition partner, which would effectively collapse the government — a possibility neither governing party appears keen on at the moment."
