        "text": "The Puerto Rican hero Eugenio Maria de Hostos sponsored in the Dominican Republic between 1875 and 1903 the most transcendental pedagogical movement in our history. He created the first normal schools, aimed at males and females, and in them he was a pioneer in the teaching of science. He was also a flawless patriot and fought for the independence of Cuba and Puerto Rico and for the Confederation of the Antilles.\n\nAlthough he only published two books in life \"Social Moral\" and \"Treaty of constitutional law\", his work has been collected in more than twenty volumes. Pedro Henríquez Ureña called him an apostle of action. He was a thinker, organizer, executor and dreamer. For José Gabriel García, father of our historiography, he must have been the Dominican historian because he taught a critical and interpretive history. His pedagogical method has not yet been overcome: he taught through reason and emotion, and he did not skimp on art as a pedagogical tool. Thanks to him, the country was able to give a systematic and rational organization to the studies. He was an enemy of memorism and hollow scholarship. The textbooks he used were made by himself with the help of his students. He taught reasoned reading, that is, reading to think. The only judge of truth was one's own conscience, but for it to be objective, it must be constantly instructed and put into practice and tested in reality.\n\nHostos is still a great unknown; I knew he was and he always considered himself posthumous. Without being religious dogmatic believed that religion could be a model of morality. Although a supporter of secular education and freedom of worship, went to the Cathedral of Santo Domingo every day and came first that the bishop. He was attacked without mercy. He was the first to teach social morals at school, but was accused of creating a school without morals or religion. A disciple of his said that he was a martyr every day and according to the Jesuit historian Tom Lluberes, he was a lay saint.\n\nHostos lived in San Carlos, in a very modest house. He remembered it from Chile, where he could live a little more comfortable, and said he did not change it for any palace. In an interview with a Chilean president, he did not stop seeing the hero's broken shoes and when the meeting ended, Hostos said goodbye saying: I hope that next time you look me in the eyes and not my old shoes.\n\nHostos was Dominican by adoption. \"I love Santo Domingo as much as my own Borinquen and I will probably choose it as the native home of most of my children, for final residence and burial,\" he said at 1895. This is your land, your grandparents and children.\n\nHostos died in the middle of the worst Dominican civil war, the 11 of August of 1903. Disciples of his died in the fratricidal bands. His small house in San Carlos was set on fire and he lost his library and his theater equipment, teaching stories and legends to his children and children in the neighborhood. He suffered a lot for the country because he loved it so much. He requested that his remains not be transferred to Puerto Rico while his country was not a free and sovereign State. That is why it rests in our country, in the Patria Pantheon. José Ramón López, his disciple, said that the Master was like the seeds found in the Egyptian pyramids, which after thousands of years were capable of germinating.\n\nTo know the life and work of Hostos is a beautiful spiritual commitment. Children and young people will love it when they know it and then they will understand why they said that the promising future rests with children, young people and women. The future is always created in the present.\n\nThe Hostosian thought is very pertinent to think and rethink scientific and moral education in a time of crisis like this. His holistic ideas - he thought everything was related to everything - allow us to break the sealed behaviors of our careers and subjects. Education gains its full meaning in the formation of the human being in all its dimensions, within which consciousness, social morals and citizenship can not be lacking. For Hostos, a human being who does not have the necessary cognitive skills or be a conscious and active citizen is a danger to society. Immorality is a lack of natural, social and individual duty: to put the particular good before the general, dignity to interest and justice to passion.\n\nTaken from the notes of Professor José Guerrero, Professor of Anthropology INTEC."
