        "text": "Mayagüez, city, western Puerto Rico. Created in 1760 as Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Mayagüez, it was elevated to the royal status of villa in 1836 and to a city in 1877. In 1918 the city and port were ravaged by an earthquake and a tidal wave, but they were quickly rebuilt. Mayagüez has been one of the most progressive cities of Puerto Rico and, since the late 19th century, has been a centre of political activity.\n\nWith its excellent deepwater harbour, Mayagüez has long been the chief shipping port of western Puerto Rico and the centre of the island’s needlework and tuna-processing industries. The establishment of the Mayagüez Foreign Trade Zone, with heavy rent and tax subsidies, has fostered assembly and electronics industries that make products for reexport. Other products include foods, beer, liquor, furniture, clothing, tiles, soap, cigars, and agricultural tools. The city is linked by a modern highway and by commercial flights to San Juan.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s experimental station at Mayagüez has one of the largest collections of tropical plants in the Western Hemisphere. Mayagüez also is the site of the only zoo in Puerto Rico. Among the city’s educational institutions is the Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico. There are some nuclear research facilities associated with the campus."
