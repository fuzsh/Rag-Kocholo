        "text": "Hello parents and students,\n\nWelcome back to the 2022-2023 school year!\n\nMy name is Ms. Garcia and I will be teaching seventh grade at Hostos. I am extremely excited to meet and get to know you and your children! It is important for me to connect, bond, and understand each child (and their families) in order to provide a high quality education.\n\nAs the teacher's aides and myself work as a team, I would like to emphasize the essence of parent involvement. Our job is incomplete without the participation of our parents and/or guardians. Together we can make a difference for our students and help them progress. With that being said, I welcome you to our team and I look forward to meeting and working collaboratively with you all.\n\nPlease take a peek at our classroom supply list below:\n\n- 2 sketch pads (no lines) → Example here\n\n- 4 dry erase pocket folders → Example here\n\n- 1 pack of dry erase markers → Example here\n\n- 1 tissue box\n\n- 1 clorox wipe\n\n- 1 hand sanitizer\n\nShould you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact me here.\n\nThank you kindly,\n\nMs. Garcia"
