        "text": "It is not enough to impart knowledge, you must teach how to acquire it; it is not enough to teach constructed knowledge, you have to teach how to construct it; it is not enough to submit yourself and to submit your teaching to a method, you have to teach how to use it. In a word, it is not enough to teach to know; you have to teach how to reason.\n\n—Eugenio María de Hostos\n\nForjando el porvenir americano-II, O.C. (1939), 52\n\nWednesday, February 26, 2014 (Bronx, NY) - This year marks the 175th anniversary of the birth of the man for whom Hostos Community College was named. Born in Puerto Rico on January 11, 1839, Eugenio María de Hostos excelled in many fields, including literature, sociology, education, jurisprudence, and philosophy.\n\nWith Hostos175 the College will commemorate the life and work of Eugenio María de Hostos by hosting lectures; workshops for students and faculty centered on curriculum integration; conferences; and civic and cultural holdings with distinguished leaders, scholars and artists beginning in March and through the end of 2014.\n\nThe intention of Hostos175 is to highlight the work of this illustrious educator, who was committed to the social, political, and the cultural development of society with the goal of justice and equality for all; to reflect on the richness and diversity of Hostos’ own intellectual and ethical pursuits; and bring to light his many significant contributions to Latin America, the Hispanic Caribbean, and Latinos and Latinas in the United States and throughout the world.\n\nPresident of Hostos Community College Félix V. Matos Rodríguez notes, “The real possibility of creating stable republics, with citizens who were ready to incorporate the most innovative ideas of the time for the benefit of industry, good governance, and the arts, was the goal that inspired Hostos’ educational theories.”\n\nSome Hostos175 highlights are:\n\nMarch 19, 2014 / Inaugural Lecture: Dr. April Mayes, “Hostos (and the Woman Question) in Santo Domingo: A Consideration of Gender and Nation Building in Hostosian Thought and Practice.”\n\nAs the leadoff event for the 175th Anniversary Celebration of the birth of Eugenio María de Hostos, Hostos Community College is pleased to announce our inaugural lecture by Dr. April Mayes of Pomona College. Dr. Mayes, Associate Professor of Latin American and Caribbean History, Dean of Women at Pomona College, and author of the forthcoming book The Mulatto Republic: Class, Race, and Dominican National Identity (University Press of Florida, 2014), will deliver a lecture titled “Hostos (and the Woman Question) in Santo Domingo: A Consideration of Gender and Nation Building in Hostosian Thought and Practice.” The presentation, in recognition of Women's History Month, describes Hostos's influence on women's education and on the development of a generation of normalistas who applied Hostosian pedagogy in their female-run schools and Hostosian thought in their social reform activism. The lecture will then detail how Hostosian thought, while not necessarily feminist, influenced Dominican feminism in its early, inchoate years. Finally, Dr. Mayes explores why Hostos addressed the \"woman question\" in the first place and what significance women had in his thinking about civil society, the state, and the nation.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on March 19 for our first event in a year-long series dedicated to our college’s namesake.\n\nFor further information please contact Professor Orlando Hernández at ohernandez@hostos.cuny.edu or Professor Ernest Ialongo at eialongo@hostos.cuny.edu.\n\nTime: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.\n\nPlace: Savoy Multipurpose Room\n\nMarch 28, 2014 / Open Forum / Hostos: The Man, The College, The Bronx\n\nPresented by Professor Emeritus Gerald Meyer, Hostos Archivist William Casari, and Hostos\n\nscholar Professor Orlando J.

He made major contributions to education in the Dominican Republic and Chile. He was also an exemplary figure for the New World societies: an activist who fought for human and national rights at a time when these were hardly acknowledged as fundamental values; a committed abolitionist; and a staunch advocate for the recognition and enfranchisement of marginalized groups: women, Chinese, Native Americans, mestizos, and peoples of African ancestry. All of this made him a champion for inclusiveness and one of the most powerful voices for diversity in the Hispanic world.\n\nHostos’ views on education are worthy of note for their visionary character. His pedagogy was student-centered and based on scientific and rational methods of teaching that included observation, experiential learning, reasoning, and critical thinking. It brought to teaching the motivational theory of learning as well as an awareness of the relevance of context.\n\nHostos was an early promoter of offering scientific education to women, while in Chile in 1873.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, in the 1880s, he founded teacher schools for men, and with Dominican poet Salomé Ureña, he opened a normal school for women. He also supported the establishment of kindergartens and created evening schools for workers in that country. As Dr. Félix Matos Rodríguez, president of the Hostos Community College, points out, “His educational legacy in the Dominican Republic earned him the affection and respect of generations of Dominicans that has endured to this day.”\n\nHostos also worked tirelessly for the independence of Cuba and his native Puerto Rico. He was in favor of Latin American unity and supported the creation of an Antillean confederation of independent states. For his important contributions to Latin America and Caribbean countries Hostos was conferred the title “eminent Citizen of America” at the 8th Pan American Conference in Lima, Perú, in 1938.\n\nAbout Hostos Community College\n\nEugenio María de Hostos Community College is an educational agent for change that has been transforming and improving the quality of life in the South Bronx and neighboring communities since 1968.
