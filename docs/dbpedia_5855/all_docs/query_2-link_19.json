This municipality bears the name of the Puerto Rican educator and writer (1839-1903) known as the Great Citizen of America for promoting the independence of Puerto Rico and Cuba and the concept of the Antillean Confederation.\n\nAbout[]\n\nThe origin of this community dates back to the end of the 19th century. It was known as Monte Abajo or La Ceiba, whose first settlers dedicated themselves to agriculture and livestock.\n\nLike many towns in the northeast of Cibao, La Ceiba benefited economically from the construction of the Sánchez-La Vega railroad in 1887.\n\nLa Ceiba was declared a municipal district of San Francisco de Macoris on September 2, 1913.\n\nIt was given its current name on April 19, 1928.\n\nIt received the category of municipality in 2004.\n\nGeography[]\n\nIt has two municipal districts: Hostos and Sabana Grande. It is limited to the north with the Castillo municipality , to the east with the Villa Riva municipality , to the south with the Sánchez Ramírez province , and to the west with the Pimentel municipality .\n\nEconomy[]\n\nEugenio María de Hostos's economy generally consists of agriculture. Its main products are rice, cocoa, banana, coffee and tobacco. In addition, this municipality benefits from raising livestock for the production of meat.\n\nHeritage[]\n\nThe Hostos patron saint festivities are celebrated every year from January 12 to 21 in honor of the Virgen de la Altagracia.\n\nAmong its main tourist attractions is the Cueva de los Indios, its spa on the Yuna River, and the Boulevard Gastón Fernando Deligne that has a replica of the Sánchez-La Vega railway.\n\nReferences[]"
