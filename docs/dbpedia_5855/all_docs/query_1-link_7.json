        "text": "Today marked the birth of Eugenio María de Hostos [for biography, see previous post Eugenio María de Hostos (1839-1903)]. This week there have been events all over the Puerto Rico as tributes to this abolitionist, pro-education, pro-independence intellectual who dreamt of a Caribbean Federation [Federación Antillana].\n\nThis morning, many diverse university, trade union, political, social, community and religious organizations gathered today in front of the bust of Eugenio María de Hostos at the University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras to celebrate, demonstrate, and speak in defense of public education and freedom of expression. The act commemorated Hostos and affirmed the community’s commitment to an excellent public education, accessible to working people, as well as upholding civil rights including freedom of expression, association, and assembly.\n\nEmphasizing a reaffirmation of democracy, this tribute underlined the life and work of Hostos as an educator, politician, writer, journalist, philosopher, and sociologist, recognized throughout Latin America. His sociological work formed generations of students and educators with a curriculum inclusive of scientific, ethical, and aesthetic thought from the primary grades to the university level. For Hostos, work and education were universal human rights and this activity was meant to reiterate that education is the heritage of the people."
