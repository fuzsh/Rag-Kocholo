        "text": "The American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) is pleased to announce the 2019 Mellon/ACLS Community College Faculty Fellows. This is the first year of this program, which supports research projects from humanities and social science faculty who teach at two-year colleges. The program is made possible by a generous grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe fellowships this year will support 26 scholars as they conduct research on a wide range of topics, and bring their findings back to their classrooms and communities. Projects range from an archaeological investigation of Classic Mayan society, involving College of the Redwoods undergraduates in field research in Mexico; to a study of celebrity portraiture through nineteenth-century portrayals of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, resulting in a book, an art exhibition at Delaware County Community College, and a student symposium on celebrity in contemporary media; to a faculty-student collaborative oral history of Chicago’s Latino suburbs, culminating in jointly authored scholarly articles, conference presentations, and community events at Elgin Community College\n\n“We’re thrilled to announce the recipients of these awards,” said ACLS program officer Rachel Bernard, “each of whom exemplifies the kind of rich humanistic research, innovative pedagogy, and deep community engagement that is flourishing within humanities programs at two-year colleges across the country. This program serves an unmet need by supporting teacher-scholars at community colleges through flexible stipends that fellows can use to fund their research, teaching, and public programming.”\n\nThis is the first of three annual competitions funded by this grant. Fellows receive a $40,000 stipend over 18 months and will participate in a convening to meet, share their work, and discuss broader issues in the humanities in the community college sector.\n\nMellon/ACLS Community College Faculty Fellows are listed below; for more information about the recipients and their projects, click here.\n\nMonika Bilka (Professor of History, Chandler-Gilbert Community College) Remaking a People, Restoring a Watershed: Klamath Tribal Empowerment though Natural Resource Governance\n\nTanya N.Cook (Professor of Sociology, Community College of Aurora) Always Keep Nerd Fighting: Fandoms as Social Movements\n\nMaggie Dickinson (Assistant Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, City University of New York, Guttman Community College)Repairing Inequality?: Disaster Relief, Deservingness, and the Growing Wealth Gap in the United States\n\nWanda Little Fenimore (Assistant Professor of Speech Communications, University of South Carolina, Sumter) Elizabeth and Waties Waring: Paving the Rhetorical Road to Brown v.
