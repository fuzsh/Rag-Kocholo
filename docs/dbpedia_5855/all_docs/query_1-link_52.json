        "text": "Chapter 6\n\nIt’s Decided: We Say No to Mining!\n\nA Tool for Resistance\n\nThe Specter of Mining Returns\n\nWe began 1993 with our brothers and sisters in the diaspora by commemorating the birthday of our national hero, Eugenio María de Hostos. We designed an activity centered on Puerto Rican identity, calling it We Are Boricuas to honor our Indigenous roots. The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and New York City Lore co-sponsored the event, which featured the musical groups Melodía Tropical, Trío Internacional, Los Pleneros de la 21, and Cuerdas de Borinquen. We presented the Arts and Culture Workshop’s highest honor, the Eugenio María de Hostos Prize, to the illustrious musician from Adjuntas and resident of the Big Apple, Nerí Orta. From the countryside and from many towns, people came to pay homage with flowers, plaques, and gifts to this student of Ladislao Martínez Otero, a.k.a., El Maestro Ladí, historically the most influential composer and player of the Puerto Rican cuatro, the five-stringed instrument used to play traditional jíbaro music. The town square was full of life until one in the morning, affirming our group identity: Boricuas all, regardless of where we had been born or raised.\n\nIn February, we participated in a meeting of the coordinators of alternative economic projects, organized by our friend José Enrique Ayoroa Santaliz. We made a presentation about our Madre Isla Coffee and eco-tourism projects to an audience of nearly a hundred. Atilano Cordero Badillo, president of the Grande supermarket chain, made the promise, which he subsequently fulfilled, of collaborating with the Arts and Culture Workshop on our economic projects. We closed the month with a think-tank of students from the University of Puerto Rico at Casa Pueblo.\n\nIn March, we successfully completed multiple projects. One weekend, the distinguished Puerto Rican Sylvia Henríquez brought a group of twenty-seven teenagers from the Pro-Youth Association of Cucharillas in Cataño to visit the Finca Madre Isla Project for an intensive exchange with students from Adjuntas. It was an amazing learning opportunity for both groups, as was the visit by members of the Teacher’s Association interested in learning about our model of community self-governance. During a week in April, twenty students from Roberto Clemente Community Academy in Chicago stayed in the cabins at the Finca Madre Isla. From this base camp, they went on day trips to various areas across Puerto Rico as part of a cultural immersion project. In May, we offered a workshop on the Puerto Rican tiple, the smallest of the three string instruments, which, along with the cuatro and the bordonua, compose the traditional orquesta jíbara (jíbaro orchestra). On March 28, the Julián Acosta Elementary School celebrated its Poetry Recital Festival at Casa Pueblo. As usual, week by week, and month by month, we processed and sold Madre Isla Coffee. Our community enterprise was now generating enough revenue to fund three part-time salaries, one student scholarship, and the cost of the physical maintenance of Casa Pueblo.\n\nDuring the six years after our 1986 victory over mining interests, all our work was directed toward securing and strengthening the community’s self-governance through national and cultural affirmation and through the development of alternative economic self-sufficiency via the Madre Isla Coffee Farm and the Eco-Tourism project. But at the beginning of June, we received information from residents in the mining zone that companies were conducting new work in places known to have copper, gold, and silver deposits. After some research, we found out that these activities were related to scientific exploration in the area. We asked ourselves, “again?” Our country has always been preyed upon. When it wasn’t coal plants, it was the radars in Vieques and Lajas, landfills, improper use of land to plant cement instead of crops, and the destruction of the environment. We had to go back and review all the information we had archived in the Hostos Library about the anti-mining fight between 1980 and 1986. Immediately, we protested through every means of communication, just like our stalwart brothers and sisters in Utuado had done to denounce new mine exploration on the outskirts of their town. On June 17, 1993, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources was forced to clarify the situation. Within a week several mining companies publicly acknowledged that mining explorations were indeed under way, and one company took out an advertisement in several newspapers, including El Vocero, stating:\n\nOur company, Southern Gold Resources (USA) Inc., is currently evaluating the environmental aspects and the economic potential of the Cala Abajo deposits, under a permit granted by the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources.We have not yet concluded the study; it will take one and a half more years to complete. Nor have we requested a permit to begin mining these deposits.1\n\nIt was clear that mining explorations were underway, and there was no question about what we had to do. We understood that a new anti-mining fight had begun, and, as before, we were ready to do whatever was necessary to bring it to an end, this time for good. From that moment forward, all of our projects—Casa Pueblo, Madre Isla Coffee, and the Finca Madre Isla—would be managed with the goal of stopping the mines in perpetuity. The defense of our land and the resources that give life to this country would be integrated into all our cultural affirmation activities. The profits from selling coffee would be invested in the anti-mining campaign. This time we had more experience and three self-sustaining projects to rely on. We had become stronger as a community, and we knew we could stop the mines again.\n\nA New Strategy: Unity\n\nWe reconvened at Casa Pueblo to start redesigning our strategy in response to these new circumstances. We decided this time to focus on three main objectives, all in Adjuntas: creating opportunities for youth participation; developing new leadership; and incorporating other groups, such as religious, civic, and cultural organizations. We knew that if we succeeded in connecting with these sectors, it would strengthen the people’s will to act on other matters affecting the community. We understood that change only came about through community unity, action, and hard work. We also thought it would be beneficial to create a wide opposition front, with Casa Pueblo as only one among many other organizations.\n\nAs a first step, we agreed to share our plan with the community, so that the people would know what was happening. On June 26, 1993, we participated in a radio program with Luis Francisco Ojeda in Ponce, and then on June 13 with WPJC Radio Gigante in Adjuntas. We also published our first report, Work Starting at the Mining Zone 5KM from Adjuntas, and distributed 3,000 copies of it in both rural and urban areas. As a sports commentator would later say, we turned the heat up. Based on our experience that successful community struggle cannot involve partisan attitudes, petty divisiveness, or elitism, we joined forces with the Utuado Pro-Environmental Foundation on July 11 and 14. Miguel Báez, Toño Rodríguez, and Capellita, among others, stood together as models of inter-organizational unity. We co-wrote and signed the document For Our Life and for Puerto Rico and when we finished, we said our goodbyes late that night, agreeing to continue working in our respective communities while still maintaining mutual communication and collaboration. This alliance would prove fundamental to our efforts.\n\nAfter holding several smaller meetings, on August 5, 1993, we called a large assembly in Adjuntas. In good faith, we proposed that it would be best for the struggle if we created a large, united front of opposition. After two hours of discussion, the attendees turned down the proposal. In the end, we agreed that the coordination of the initiative would remain at Casa Pueblo. Proponents of this decision argued that, since we had been successful in the past, there was no reason to change our strategy. Under these circumstances, we resolved to boost participation in the fight. We reached out to new and old collaborators, like the university professor Lourdes Torres, Father José, surveyor Israel Plaza, members of the Pro-Environmental Committee of Tanamá, high school students, religious groups, and Ulises Torres, who had worked as an inspector in the US Bureau of Mines. With an expanded and diversified voice, we moved toward organizing a village forum.\n\nA Village Forum\n\nWe decided to celebrate our new strategy with a forum featuring a special guest, the Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. Several people expressed concerns, wondering why we would invite the principal proponent of the exploitative mining to Casa Pueblo. Some were sure that we had gone crazy. Nevertheless, we celebrated the Village Forum in Casa Pueblo on September 16, 1993, and the Secretary arrived on time, accompanied by an expert in mining geology and legal advisors. Tinti Deyá served as the moderator. Everything suggested that we were headed for a showdown, and indeed we were. It was a full house at Casa Pueblo, and the event was broadcast throughout the country via WPJC of Adjuntas, Radio Casa Pueblo, and WPAB of Ponce. We had ensured good attendance by sending out written invitations, making phone calls, and organizing the broadcast by WEUC-FM in Ponce. When the Secretary finished his presentation on the low environmental impact of what he called “small-scale” mining, others voiced their opposition to the mining proposal with a variety of arguments. We heard from anthropologist Ivor Hernández, of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture; professor and poet Antonio Álvarez; agronomist María Eugenia Beck; Lilly Vélez, representing merchants; engineer Ulises Torres; Sister Gregoria of the Mercy Home for Girls; and fifteen university and high school students from Adjuntas. In the final part of the Village Forum, we organized a panel with Father José of the Catholic Church; Dr. Adalberto Lugo Boneta; the agronomist and farmer Ariel Massol Deyá; Johanna Delgado, a junior at the José Emilio Lugo High School; and me. We put the visiting Secretary through an intense interrogation from people with different perspectives and specialties. The panel lasted an hour and a half.\n\nWe countered all his arguments in favor of mining with clear rebuttals. Each of the Secretary’s main points—that the mining would be small-scale, that it amounted to only 10% of what was proposed in 1980, and that it would only exploit the Cala Abajo deposit—were refuted. The Secretary even conceded that, once the million-dollar investment of infrastructure was completed, mining would not stop at that 10%, affirming that once a deposit was exhausted, the companies would continue to look for others. On several occasions, he had to seek the advice of his team. It is worth noting that our panel of local representatives held various meetings before the forum to prepare ourselves to effectively ask our questions and counter the Secretary’s responses. There was no room for improvisation, and in the panel, we successfully put all our technical, scientific, and social science expertise to work for the benefit of the Adjuntas communities. The then-mayor of Adjuntas, Rigoberto Ramos, who was among the participants, asked for the floor. After listening to both arguments, he said, he had changed his position and had decided to oppose the project. The president of the Municipal Assembly made the same announcement and promised to come up with a resolution. To those who were listening on the radio, saw the video that we showed, or read our news bulletin, it was clear that we could not accept this new exploitative mining proposal. The Village Forum was a powerful blow to mining interests at exactly the right time and place. We brought the opponent to the count of nine, and almost scored a knockout.\n\nThat day we realized that we could win again. We saw the potential of a unified community to transform a situation. We learned that we had to act with imagination and as a united front, expressing clear, forceful, and respectful arguments. We learned that we could create our own forums and that we did not have to depend on public hearings put on by the government where everything was fixed in advance. The Village Forum taught us to be protagonists and not just spectators. We also started to follow through on our promise to integrate local youth into our work and to open our spaces to other sectors of the community.\n\nAt the end of the Village Forum, we served Madre Isla coffee to all the guests, including those we considered to be our adversaries, but not our enemies. This was an important distinction to aid us in knowing where to aim our cannons. The unified voice of the people was beginning to have an impact. Other immediate results of the Village Forum included the Assembly of the Cultural Centers of the Mountain Regions, celebrated two weeks later at Casa Pueblo. There, the resolution Por la Vida y Puerto Rico (For Life and Puerto Rico) was written and approved by cultural centers in Utuado, Ángeles, Lares, Castañer, Jayuya, Barranquitas, Aibonito, and Adjuntas. The mayor of Adjuntas also signed the anti-mining resolution on behalf of the municipal assembly. As part of our overall strategy, we surveyed the teachers and students at the José Emilio Lugo High School in Adjuntas. The results revealed that 501 out of the 526 students, and 33 out of 36 teachers, also opposed mining. On October 27, we participated in another forum on mining at the Cultural Center of Utuado. The newspaper Diálogo interviewed us, and a professor of sociology at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras brought her class to the event. The students pledged to support our fight through their studies and signed the anti-mining petition that was now circulating across Puerto Rico. Once again, the cycle of unity and solidarity grew from the center outward, and from the local to the national. However, there was still much to do and no time to rest on our laurels. We concluded 1993 in the spirit of the old saying: “There is no triumph without struggle, nor struggle without sacrifice.”\n\nDiversity in the Struggle\n\nWe started 1994 in much the same way as we did the previous year: commemorating the birth of Eugenio María de Hostos in the public plaza. This time, we awarded the Hostos Prize to a young improvisational singer-songwriter from Adjuntas, Edgardo Rivera Vega. Edgardo had started his career in the Arts and Culture Workshop as a child, singing about the defense of natural resources with the Puerto Rican traditional music group Mapeyé at one of their concerts in Adjuntas. Years earlier, in 1986, he had participated in the historic signing of the Manifiesto de un pueblo que quiere vivir (Manifesto of a People Who Want to Live), along with Andrés “El Jíbaro” Jiménez in Casa Pueblo. That night, which we called Fiesta del Cafetal (Coffee Farm Festival), we presented him with the book Trova borincana, by Juan Manuel Delgado, and celebrated with the music of Café Colao. The event became very emotional when Neri Orta, master of the Puerto Rican cuatro who had received the Hostos Prize the year before, made a surprise appearance. Accompanied by other musicians from many areas of Puerto Rico, he came to pay homage to his successor.\n\nLater that month we received a delegation of students from Columbia University and had a very rewarding conversation with them about the anti-mining struggle. In February 1994, we started offering sculpture classes under the direction of Francisco Pérez Cardona, an artist from Añasco who lived in San Francisco and had learned of Casa Pueblo through a serendipitous series of events. Ten years earlier, in 1984, Casa Pueblo had been touring the United States as part of our anti-mining campaign, visiting universities in eight states. At the University of San Francisco in California, we established a friendship with a man named Jimmy Emerman, who returned our visit in 1989. His interview of us was subsequently published with the title “The Environmental Struggle in Puerto Rico: Poison Paradise” in the Earth Island Journal of San Francisco. Pérez Cardona read the piece and became so enthusiastic about our work in Adjuntas that he reached out to us and offered his solidarity. Eventually, he attained a year-long sabbatical to do community volunteer work with us. His sculpture workshops were the product of another project from another time and another place, and this taught us is to keep putting energy into every interaction, even those that might seem insignificant.\n\nAny relationship can someday bear unexpected fruit. It almost always takes time to see the results of our actions, and that is why we must be patient and persistent. Some people shy away from small interactions because they believe they will not lead to anything and are not worth the trouble. They forget that to build any tall structure, it is necessary to lay a foundation that may, in the end, be concealed. It was the accumulation of many smaller acts between 1980 and 1986 that led us to our first major victory against mining, and that would soon lead us to a second victory. We did not reach the summits of these mountains without first following an arduous and winding path to the top.\n\nOn February 21, we attended the wake of another unforgettable patriot who also accompanied us on many occasions: Oscar Collazo. Oscar was one of those who marched in 1985 through the streets of Adjuntas with a tree in hand as we sowed seeds of hope. He also helped produce the first golden beans of Madre Isla Coffee, to register books in the Hostos Library at Casa Pueblo, to reforest the Finca Madre Isla, and contributed to other important projects. Oscar lives on in our memory and in the important wisdom that he imparted to us.\n\nMarch was a time of many different experiences. On March 1, Tinti and Alexis participated in a forum on mining at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez and made new alliances. Back in Adjuntas, we sponsored a conference at the José Emilio Lugo High School on the lyrical poetic form known as décima in the Caribbean and Latin America. We participated in radio programs at WPJC in Adjuntas and WEUC-FM in Ponce. As usual, we attended the bimonthly meeting of self-governing groups and economic design groups in San Germán. On March 19, we commemorated the birth of Puerto Rico’s illustrious poet Julia de Burgos, though her birthday is actually on February 17. The distinguished group Flor de Caña came directly from Boston to perform their latest song in the public plaza of Adjuntas. Two younger members of the Workshop, Johanna and Ariel, were the speakers that night, explaining the concept of community self-governance. We sold coffee from our kiosk (we do not sell alcoholic beverages at our events), and we gave a demonstration on how to plant hydroponic lettuce greens. The demonstration was co-sponsored by the Monte Río Hotel, which also provided housing and food for the artists; the Ponce Bank; and the Panelli Hardware Store. Other supporters, like Paco Ramos, René Vera, Joe, and Mencho, also contributed. WPJC Radio Gigante broadcast the event in Adjuntas. It is crucial to note that the simultaneous efforts of a great many people resulted in significant communication and unity. There was no room for isolation or for people to be forgotten. Thus, little by little, we won over the town, while the mining company quietly continued to drill more exploratory boreholes in the rocks of our Boricua motherland.\n\nEcotourism and Mining\n\nA highlight for us at this time was the daylong symposium Ecotourism in Puerto Rico: Realities and Projections, held at the University of Puerto Rico on March 24th, 1994. It yielded terrific results. I was asked to speak on Ecotourism Development Within a Community, and I took the opportunity to unveil our Finca Madre Isla Project. The talk quickly summarized our fight against mining, focusing on our efforts to design an authentic ecotourism project in the mountains of Adjuntas. After the talk we met with people who were interested in alternative, pro-environmental economic designs and enthusiastic about our project. That month we also received a visit from two professors of ecology from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who were familiar with our work because we had visited their university a decade earlier. On March 24, 25, and 26 we facilitated an exchange between high school students in Philadelphia and Adjuntas. The visiting students stayed at the Finca Madre Isla and became spokespeople for the anti-mining fight back in their home state of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn April 15th, we were invited to lead an event in Aguadilla to celebrate José de Diego’s birthday and his contributions to the philosophy of self-governance, a topic dear to Casa Pueblo. José de Diego is commonly regarded as the father of the Puerto Rico independence movement in the nineteenth century, the poet whose firm NO against malicious attackers planted the seeds of the struggle for national liberation. “Among the poets,” he once wrote, “I launch my rebellious verses, my cries of protest combatting the tyrants of our land, to the winds and the heart of the world.” The invitation turned out to be very important for us. It focused our study on José de Diego and we discovered how close our thinking was to his. We felt that de Diego, like Corretjer, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Lolita Lebrón, and Carmín Pérez, lived within us, and we in them. Here was another dimension of unity and spiritual respect that both transcended time and humbly accompanied our group. On April 17, we presented the Camerata Coral in Concert, first at the San Joaquín School and then at the House of Mercy, both in Adjuntas. In addition to other activities, we offered a talk about sustainable agriculture at the Adjuntas High School, and I read children’s stories at the Yahuecas School. For a week, students from the Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago returned to the Finca Madre Isla, joyful to be back again on their land.\n\nOn May 3, 1994, representatives of Southern Gold Resources came to Adjuntas. First, they went to visit the mayor intending to convince him that the mining project would confer many benefits and to get his approval. Then, they arrived unexpectedly at Casa Pueblo soliciting a meeting with me, to which I agreed. When I asked the purpose of the visit, they explained that the mayor had told them to talk to Casa Pueblo first, and, if they convinced us, to return to see him. Our response, of course, was a resounding NO, imbued with the same spirit that drove José de Diego’s resistance to the colonial powers in his day. The experience speaks for itself: our social power had deeply penetrated and transformed the town’s political power structure. Late May and early June of 1994 brought another significant milestone for the anti-mining struggle. More than two hundred representatives from South, Central, and North America, Asia, Europe, and Puerto Rico, attended the World Tourism Congress for the Environment in San Juan. At this international summit, we shared our perspective on eco-tourism, explaining that successful eco-tourism must be sensitive to the environment and to the country. It should be the type of tourism that respects the trees, birds, and endangered species, and it must also respect the people and culture of Puerto Rico, both of which are today threatened with extinction by exploitative mining. One of the field seminars of the Congress took place in Casa Pueblo. During the meeting, we approved a resolution opposing exploitative mining and supporting eco-tourism as an economically viable alternative that was compatible with the environment and eliminated mining. The resolution was later presented and approved during the plenary session of the Congress at the Condado Hotel Plaza, with the governor of Puerto Rico and the Secretary of the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources in attendance. This time, we refuted mining with concrete and viable alternatives. Unfortunately, our victory did not come with the support from the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization, or C-24, an assembly sometimes marked by diplomatic hypocrisy. Instead, it came about thanks to our ongoing work of building a self-governing community.\n\nExtending our influence from the local to the national and then to the global levels yielded positive outcomes for our self-governing community and became a new formula in our work. A week later, we inaugurated a sculpture exhibit titled “Recovering What Was Once Lost in Casa Pueblo.” The sculptor Francisco Pérez Cardona returned from San Francisco on another sabbatical and unveiled his bust of the workshop activist Osvaldo Rodríguez Blondet, in a small park that now carries his name. In a virtuoso performance, clarinet master Ricardo Velázquez elevated the ceremony to the level of sublime inspiration. In October 1994, we held a ceremony to harvest our first coffee crop at the Finca Madre Isla, with more than thirty children and as many adults. The ceremony started when we all dropped, in unison, the first beans we had gathered into large tin cans. The sound reverberated like drums of war and of peace. In two and a half hours, we had collected close to 10 bushels of coffee beans. That night in Casa Pueblo, the children dramatized the work they had done during the day and the Gira Criolla Group, along with improvisational folk singers Edgardo Rivera and Julio César Sanabria, affirmed our identity and desires through their exquisite music and singing.\n\nA Sting Operation and the Community’s Response\n\nUntil this point, all our work had continued at a steady pace to prepare us for an open confrontation with the mining interests. The companies had already finished their tests and were preparing to present their mining proposals. Then, we received a low blow that knocked the wind out of us for a few days. On October 16, 1994, and in the same location where we had celebrated our first coffee harvest a few weeks before, over a hundred FBI agents came looking for Puerto Rican independence activist and militant Filiberto Ojeda Ríos. It turned out that when my mother died, he called the funeral home to express his condolences from Hartford, Connecticut, where he was under house arrest. Furthermore, he had visited us wearing an ankle monitor to learn about our project. One of his visits coincided with an event in the plaza. He stayed on the sidelines until someone identified him and people began to approach him to talk, embrace him, and take pictures. He later removed his ankle monitor and went underground. Sometime after that, the front page of The San Juan Star reported having spotted Filiberto on the streets of Adjuntas distributing Madre Isla Coffee. When national hero Oscar Collazo heard about it, he wrote to ask if he also qualified to distribute Madre Isla Coffee. The show of force that came down upon us included helicopters, planes, dogs, and boats. It was a massive operation. Heavily armed, they detained many people on the street with no explanation. Some were handcuffed, others were made to lie face down on the road, and still others were pulled out of their cars, cited, and detained. The FBI also harassed the fishermen in Garzas Lake, which borders our farm, and entered a local factory, thinking that Filiberto might be working there. With guns in hand, they marched through our town and neighborhoods, putting up signs on light posts, trees, and stores, offering a reward to anyone who would help find the wanted man. In their search at the Finca Madre Isla, they found a tall flagpole with the single-starred flag aloft and free. They also found the footprints of children, men, and women; of musicians, poets, and workshop members, all Boricuas who were searching for the path to a “future without fail,” as the poet Juan Antonio Corretjer taught us. Two weeks later, they would also face a community’s response.\n\nGroups regularly confront the issue of community conflict mediation. When conflicts develop, it is important not to lose sight of the main objectives of the group, nor should one improvise by addressing individual issues as they arise. Instead, one should conduct careful analysis of the situation and seek suitable responses. In the community response to the FBI operation,practiced the three central principles of community development according to sociologist Alain Touraine:\n\nThe Identity Principle: We kept focused on what we were doing and indentified us—the fight against mining.\n\nThe Opposition Principle: We defined the opposition as the government and the companies advocating for the mining operations, not the FBI.\n\nThe Totality Principle: We never lost sight of the big picture or our ultimate goal, which was to stop the mining.\n\nWe deduced that the barbaric FBI sting operation was, among other things, intended to divert us from our core mission and isolate us from the community by using fear tactics at the precise moment the mining companies were readying their proposal for exploitation.\n\nRealizing how dire the situation was, we lost no time in stopping these new attempts to destroy Puerto Rico’s lands and territory. To go back into isolation would be the path to community failure. We needed to respond to the operation immediately. We decided to use the tool that we always carried with us: Puerto Rican culture. In less than two weeks, we organized a Community Festival at the Finca Madre Isla. First, we visited neighbors and friends to secure their commitment to participate and contribute to the activity on October 30. We also invited artists to join us: Trío Río Mar, Jaime Reyes, Gregorio Rivera, Edgardo Rivera, Tato Ramos, Zualbi, Iván and Aniel Irizarry (from Adjuntas), and Mapeyé with Rolando Silva. When we visited neighbors to invite them to the festival and inform them that Filiberto was not at the Finca Madre Isla, they frequently interrupted us to say that protecting him and having him there would be the right thing for us to do. They mentioned that, had they known about his presence, they would have offered him food and lodging themselves. Most people were in favor of protecting a person who they believed hadn’t hurt anybody. It was an unforgettable experience and a testament to our fierce community solidarity. Between the sun and the rain, falling like petals from the sky, the festival began with some 500 people in attendance. Among the national supporters were members of the Cultural Centers of Jayuya, Utuado, Vega Alta, Manatí, Casa Corretjer, the Pro-Environment Foundation of Utuado, and friends from San Juan, Ponce, Guayama, Aguada, and San Sebastián. Of all the people from the neighborhood that we invited, ninety-six percent came to the event and many brought food and refreshments. Two percent excused themselves, and the other two percent had joined the party of the fearful. Doubts were dissipated. The community responded resoundingly to the aggression and all feelings of helplessness and isolation dissolved.\n\nUnited in songs of rebellion, we took a deep breath that night and reaffirmed our faith in the community and our stance against mining. We spent November and December 1994 reevaluating what to do and how to do it. Through this process, a new organizational strategy came about. We decided to expand Casa Pueblo’s board of directors. We chose twenty candidates and divided the task of approaching them with our invitation. We thought that it was possible that the FBI operation would negatively affect their decision to join the leadership body. However, the next week when we met to share the results, we found that of the seventeen people we invited, sixteen said that it would be an honor for them to join Casa Pueblo’s board of directors. And, oh, what great a joy it was to feel so supported by our community! The reorganized structure made us stronger and put us in a better situation to go back on the offensive. With a larger and revitalized board in place, we bid farewell to 1994 and left the FBI operation behind us. We launched into 1995 with faith, hope, and our eyes set on victory for the community.\n\nA New Alternative Project\n\nOur participation in various forums on eco-tourism throughout 1994 allowed us to get to know several distinguished people with exceptional personal qualities. Among them were Edgardo González, Ivelisse Gorbea, Fernando Silva, Vicente Quevedo, Carmen Pérez, Digna Delgado, Judith Amador, and others who had joined us before at Casa Pueblo. With their help, a plan was born for improving a project already underway: interpretive guides for ecological and cultural tourism. We inaugurated the new project in 1995 by training young people to identify and teach about the flora, fauna, and socio-cultural aspects of Adjuntas. We received forty applications for fifteen positions. Training took place at the Finca Madre Isla. We started to build an inventory of birds, native trees, and endangered species of trees, and we created self-guided trails for visitors to walk on and learn about the local ecosystem. The eco-tourism project was evolving at the Finca Madre Isla and would eventually become a self-sufficient source of revenue and jobs. We conducted similar work at nearby areas of interest, like the Guilarte Forest, the Garzas Lake, rivers, ponds, and historic places in the neighborhood. The experience enriched our concept of what an ecotourism community project could be, and it now included the element of sensitivity towards nature, history, and culture. Some people who had participated in the early days of the anti-mining struggle became guides, thus bringing our struggle full circle. In this period of working with the fifteen youths and field technicians, we learned that the mining deposits were below an important life-sustaining ecosystem: the humid, subtropical forest. The forest, with the crystal-clear waters of the Pellejas and Viví Rivers, an annual rainfall of one hundred inches, and a particular range of temperatures, has important ecological functions. It controls sedimentation and erosion and supports a healthy flora and fauna. Preserving this vigorous, biodiverse ecosystem, would become a major argument for eliminating mining. Our data supported an alternative proposition: turn the mining zone into a forest of the Puerto Rican people, a People’s Forest. But to make this idea a reality and a legacy to the island and global humanity, we would first have to vanquish the mining project.\n\nOnward to Victory\n\nOn February 17, we celebrated the third anti-mining rally with an all-day program that featured a concert by the international group Sol y Canto who played for a bustling crowd in the plaza. We also enjoyed the performances of other musicians, poetry readings by local authors, and artisanal exhibitions. TV Channel 6 devoted an episode of their program Desde Mi Pueblo (From My Hometown) to the event, including a demonstration of our hydroponic lettuce cultivation system designed by Ariel Massol Deyá. On May 24, our neighbors at the Pro-Environment Foundation in Utuado held a grand municipal assembly formally closing the door to mining Utuado. The Finca Madre Isla continued to be the star of the moment. Students from the Roberto Clemente School in Chicago, young people from Philadelphia, a community from the Cu-cha-ri-llas de Cataño neighborhood, and twenty-seven U.S. students from sixteen different states came to visit us and stayed at the farm. We also trained our young guides to give talks about mining at their schools. Sharing our stories through print media, radio, and television was part of a strategy to reach all of Puerto Rico. We participated in radio programs on WEUC-FM, WPAB, WKAQ with Luis Francisco Ojeda, Noti Uno, Radio Raíces of San Sebastián, and WPJC of Adjuntas. We were featured on the TV program Ocurrió así (That’s How It Happened), and, through CNN, news of our struggle spread to the rest of Latin America and the continental United States. These media platforms, along with Obed Cintron’s program Hacia el 2000 (Toward 2000) and the articles published in the high school’s Revista Escolar (Student Newspaper), were crucial in winning over the Puerto Rican people to our side in the struggle.\n\nShifting our thinking from the local to the national level, we carried out three decisive actions in May and June 1995:\n\nA press conference “from the sky.” In a meeting between workshop faculty and the young guides, we agreed that saying a lot with few words would be most powerful. After debating various ideas, Inés thought of having high school students spell out a message with their bodies. Tinti led the operation. Almost all the teachers embraced the idea and made it happen. Rosa Delia Meléndez of Channel 4 and other journalists attended the press conference, which consisted of eight hundred students in the parking lot of the José Emilio Lugo High School, forming the words NO MINAS (“NO MINES”). The image was captured from a helicopter and broadcast on television for all of Puerto Rico to see. The interviews with the students were also impressive, and this symbol of unity, strength and the will to overcome had a great national impact.\n\nNO A LA EXPLOTACIÓN MINERA (NO TO MINING) was the front page news story of El Nuevo Día on May 28, 1995. The report covered four full pages and highlighted Casa Pueblo’s role in the struggle.\n\nOn June 10, 1995, Casa Pueblo called for a march to the Cala Abajo deposit, with the slogan We Already Decided: NO MINING. Children, teenagers, adults, and businesspeople from Adjuntas participated in this historical act, alongside members of the national anti-mining movement. Together, we planted trees to express our intent to transform the mining zone into a forest for the Puerto Rican people and hoisted the Puerto Rican flag on land that we proclaimed to be free of mining.\n\nThese three events marked the end of the anti-mining struggle. Two weeks later, open-pit mining was prohibited by law. Some said it was a pyrrhic victory because legislators could change the law again at any moment. However, as Ariel Massol Deyá put it, “The truth is that the Puerto Rican people wrote their own law from the streets, ruled out mining, and saved Puerto Rico from an ecological catastrophe. And if the mining companies come back and try again, they know that we will return and write the law again, like we just did.”\n\nLooking Back on Our Anti-mining Campaign\n\nThe anti-mining campaign marked the first fifteen years of Casa Pueblo, from 1980 to 1995. The following are some of the highlights of what was, and continues to be, a learning process. They stand out as worthy of reflection and analysis and provide lessons on how to confront Puerto Rico’s colonial reality:\n\nThe first anti-mining rally, which only one person attended, was an act of faith. We understand that faith is not just hope, but also, an action that goes along with a promise of love and justice. This first failure taught us an important lesson: one must design effective fighting strategies. Improvising is an unacceptable error.\n\nTo activate the community, we planned the concert The Motherland Within around areas of particular interest to different people. This way, everyone could participate in accordance with their personal motivating factors and, regardless of the size of their contribution, take part in a process of participatory democratization. It was an inclusive experience; what was exclusive was left behind. We discarded the kind of individualistic protagonism that marginalized individuals and social sectors.\n\nScience became an educational tool and its study a constant practice whenever seeking answers and reliable explanations to help the community make informed decisions.\n\nThe process taught us that science alone cannot further the cause; culture also needs to be incorporated as an instrument of identity, belonging, and action. The participation of a community with both knowledge and cultural pride yielded positive results. Territory and culture, especially useful in a colonized country, became essential concepts in our fight.\n\nFrom this interpretation and practice emerged our work equation: science + culture + community = change and victories. The social-community economy was an important outcome of this formula.\n\nOne of our first challenges as a group was to learn for ourselves about mining so that we would not have to depend on outside experts; this does not mean we should isolate ourselves.\n\nFrom within, we developed a new concept: voz propia, a voice of one’s own. The result of having a firm and independent position led us to this clear idea: “Republic or colony, zero mines in Puerto Rico.”\n\nAnother key lesson emerged from voz propia: do not enter into alliances with politicians or political parties. Such alliances weaken community self-governance and stunt its growth.\n\nApplying the principles of identity, opposition, and totality, which proved to be essential for strengthening governance, avoids errors and clarifies strategies.\n\nWe proved that defense of the territory is a necessary condition for guaranteeing the development of self-sustaining communities.\n\nThe nascent projects of self-sustaining development helped to establish a new community paradigm of growth and stability.\n\nCombining voz propia with independent strategies moves community self-governance along a path of action “from the bottom up, and toward social-political change.”\n\nI will close this summary of our first stage by stating the obvious: had mining started, we would not be here to chronicle the origins of Casa Pueblo. Because of this, I would like to add a community perspective on the current global problem of neoextractivism, which has been adopted by both progressive and conservative governments as official state policy. Neoextractivism is causing unprecedented ecological and social catastrophes, such as the loss of our forests, including the lungs of our planet in the Amazon Basin. It is also degrading our bodies of water, including glaciers, and contributing to the loss of biodiversity, including long-established human communities. The following are some news summaries that point to the gravity of the problem."
