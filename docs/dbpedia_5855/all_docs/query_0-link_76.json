        "text": "Eastern Connecticut University continues its theatrical season with \"Hecho en Puelto Rico,” written and performed by Ángel Vázquez, one of Puerto Rico’s most popular performers. \"Hecho en Puelto Rico\" is a funny and touching piece that will be presented only in English in the Fine Arts Instructional Center Proscenium Theater on Thursday, October 20, 2022 at 7:30 P.M.\n\nIn this poignant tale of discovery and pride, a student prepares to graduate and leave Puerto Rico to escape the economic crisis and Hurricane Maria. As he arranges to leave, the man unearths his cultural roots through the lives of such noted men and women in the island’s history as José de Diego, Julia de Burgos, Eugenio María de Hostos, and Roberto Clemente. With great comic flair, Vázquez reveals both the promise and the pain of migration to the mainland from the island.\n\nÁngel Vázquez, is one of Puerto Rico’s leading writers and television and film performers. He premiered \"Hecho en Puelto Rico\" in Puerto Rico and has toured to Chicago, Orlando, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and New York, where he performed at the Lincoln Center for the Arts. He is only the third Puerto Rican born actor to have started in the most important cultural center of the world. The other ones being Miguel Pinero and Raul Julia.\n\nThis performance at Eastern is supported by Eastern Connecticut State University’s Theater & Performance Media Program; the Department of Sociology, Anthropology, Criminology, and Social Work; the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program; the World Languages & Cultures Department; and the Office of the Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences."
