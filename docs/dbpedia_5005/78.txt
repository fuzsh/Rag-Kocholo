Fifty years ago on Sunday, the Saskatchewan Roughriders suffered a chilling playoff loss that put their best-ever regular season on ice.

For Bill Baker, bitter memories of the CFL’s 1970 Western Conference final — which concluded 50 years ago this coming Sunday — are frozen in time.

“The field was sheer snow and ice,” recalls Baker, who was then a third-year defensive lineman with the Saskatchewan Roughriders when they collided with the Calgary Stampeders at Taylor Field with a Grey Cup berth at stake on Nov. 22, 1970.

“We all had broomball shoes on. We couldn’t get any traction. It was terrible.”

To this day, Baker finds the outcome rather chilling.

Thanks to a 32-yard field goal by Larry Robinson into the teeth of a forbidding wind, Calgary posted a 15-14 victory in the third and deciding game of the best-of-three series.

“I didn’t think there was a chance that he would make that field goal,” Baker says. “It was into the wind and the ball was rock-hard.

“Bob Kosid (who was stationed in the Roughriders’ end zone) said the ball just fell right over the goal post. Unbelievable.

“When the ball went through, I fell to the ground and said, ‘I’m never playing this game again. I’m quitting this.’ It was just too painful.”

Especially when you consider that the Roughriders of 1970 posted what is still the best regular-season record in franchise history — 14-2-0. Calgary, by contrast, was 9-7-0.

“What makes it so tough to take is that with this record we can’t even play in the big game,” Roughriders head coach Eagle Keys said after the game.

Calgary shocked Saskatchewan in the series opener, winning 28-11 in Regina on Nov. 11, 1970. Seven days later, the Roughriders forced Game 3 by winning 11-3 at McMahon Stadium.

It was a costly conquest, however, because Roughriders quarterback Ron Lancaster suffered cracked ribs and a bruised muscle in his back during Game 2.

Consequently, Lancaster — who would soon be named the CFL’s most outstanding player for 1970 — would be limited to a cameo appearance in the deciding game. With Lancaster sidelined, Gary Lane started at quarterback in Game 3.

Before the opening kickoff, it was decided to dispense with the player introductions and playing of the national anthem due to the adverse conditions, which included a wind that was gusting up to 60 kilometres per hour.

“Prior to the game, a rule was made that when punting into the wind the ball would be called dead at the top of its flight,” noted Dick White, who attended the game with his brother, Bill.

The calls from the broadcast booth also presented a challenge.

“It’s very difficult to pick out the stripes on the field, the markings,” CBC play-by-play announcer Don Wittman said early in the telecast. “We are giving you approximate yardages throughout this contest, as the snow that fell on Regina this morning has pretty much obliterated the lines.”

Not to mention the Roughriders’ passing game.

Hampered by the biting wind, Lane completed only two of five throws for 58 yards — including a 45-yard touchdown toss to Bob Pearce. Lane also rushed 11 times for 44 yards.

After an interception by Kosid late in the third quarter, Lane rolled out to his left and attempted to score from 12 yards away. He thought he had crossed the goal line, which was obscured by snow, only to be ruled out of bounds at the one-yard line.

The plan on second down was for a handoff to George Reed, but he slipped on the icy turf and Lane was forced to improvise. He lunged toward the goal line and was adamant that he had scored but, again, the officials ruled differently.

Lane fumbled on third-and-goal, leading to a turnover on downs and leaving the Roughriders with a 14-12 advantage that held up until Robinson settled matters.

“(The officials) took it away from us twice,” Lane, who went on to spend 18 seasons as an NFL official while working as a line judge in the 1989 and 1990 Super Bowls, said after the game.

As the contest proceeded, 18,385 spectators attempted to brave a wind chill exceeding minus-35.

“The day was so-o-o-o-o cold,” White recalls. “It was one of those days when if there wasn’t a Rider playoff game, there’s no way most people would want to go outside, let alone sit on a cold, wood bench for three hours.”

Another attendee, Lorne Kazmir, remembers “agonizing groans of people walking out with frostbite.”

John Lynch, a member of CJME’s broadcast crew that day, said to call the weather “cold” was “an understatement.”

“Worse than the actual temperature was the wind and snow,” Brad Voth notes. “My face was numb and using alcohol as a heater only worked for a second or two. The Coke that we purchased for mix froze solid in no time. When you consider how much clothing we had on and then looked at the players, I don’t know how they managed to play.”

But play they did, with the outcome in question until the final snap, which took place with three seconds remaining.

“We thought the Riders had the game in the bag when they forced Calgary to try for a field goal at the end of the game,” Voth says. “Our faces were too numb to cheer, but we were already congratulating ourselves on the win when that damn kick somehow made it through the uprights.”

Robinson was as surprised as anybody when, as Jack Cook of the Saskatoon StarPhoenix wrote at the time, the ball “curved inside (the right goal post) by about six feet.”

“I didn’t think there was a chance,” Robinson, who died in 2018 at age 76, reflected in a 1988 interview with the Regina Leader-Post. “I tried kicking into the wind from there before the game and never even got one to the goal line. When I did kick it, I thought it was going to make the goal line but go wide. Then a gust hit it and, whew, it went through.”

The kick was especially miraculous when you consider that Robinson had made only 12 of his 32 field-goal attempts — a 37.5-per-cent accuracy rate — during the regular season. Earlier in the game, the Stampeders’ kicker had missed two attempts with the wind at his back.

“We didn’t think he had a chance in the world to make the thing,” Keys, the Roughriders’ head coach from 1965 to 1970, said in 2006. “It was like somebody took the ball and dropped it over the goal posts.

“We felt like we should have won that one and gone to the Grey Cup again.”

Keys had coached Saskatchewan to its first Grey Cup title, in 1966, and to subsequent championship-game appearances in 1967 and 1969. The 1970 league final, however, featured Calgary against the 7-6-1 Montreal Alouettes, with the Eastern Conference representative winning 23-10.

A half-century later, the climax of the 1970 season still gnaws at Baker — a 1994 Canadian Football Hall of Fame inductee who, despite his many accomplishments on the field, never played for a Grey Cup champion during 11 seasons as a player.

“It was one of those bitter, bitter experiences,” he says. “As a sports guy, that was my darkest day.”

And certainly the coldest.

“It’s a big investment to sit in a blizzard for three hours and watch a game, and so hard when you lose,” White laments. “As I remember it, the talk after the game was the calls at the goal line that were missed as much as Robinson’s kick … but such is life as a Rider fan.”
