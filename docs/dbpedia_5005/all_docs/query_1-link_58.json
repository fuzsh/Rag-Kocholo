        "text": "The NFL Draft continues after an exciting second day in Detroit. Here are my top prospects available for Saturday’s final rounds:\n\n1. Ja’Tavion Sanders, TE, Texas, Jr., 6-3, 245\n\nSanders was the No. 1 athlete in the 2021 recruiting class, and was ranked No. 13 overall nationally. He was originally planning on playing defensive end, but settled on tight end after Steve Sarkisian took over at Texas. Sanders features an above-the-rim skill set, soft hands and ability after the catch. The two-time first-team All-Big 12 honoree was highly productive for the Longhorns the last two seasons, making 99 receptions for 1,295 yards and seven TD receptions on 139 targets. Only Georgia’s Bowers had more receptions and targets among FBS tight ends over that span. Sanders is more scheme-dependent than Bowers, and shouldn’t be utilized in an in-line role at the next level, but he could thrive as a big slot in a wide-open attack.\n\n2. Kris Abrams-Draine, CB, Missouri, Sr., 5-11, 179\n\nAbrams-Draine is a former wide receiver who was selected first-team All-SEC and second-team All-American last season. Size will be an issue for some teams — he might not be an asset against the run in the NFL — but he held up well at college football’s highest level while essentially learning on the job. Abrams-Draine produced 40 passes defensed and seven interceptions the last three seasons. He could begin his NFL career as a return specialist while he continues to learn the nuances and develop the anticipation required to play the position.\n\n3. TJ Tampa, CB, Iowa St., Sr., 6-0, 194\n\nThe three-star recruit was a wide receiver when he first joined the Cyclones before becoming a three-year starter at cornerback. Tampa’s size, speed and physical mentality is ideal for bump-and-run coverage. He gambles a bit, but his ball skills and long arms usually bail him out.\n\n4. Cedric Gray, LB, North Carolina, Sr., 6-1, 234\n\nGray was a three-star recruit who became a three-year starter for the Tar Heels, producing 100-plus tackles his final three seasons in Chapel Hill. He was the only Power 5 player to average double-digit tackles per game in both 2022 and 2023. He was a multiyear team captain in both high school and college. Gray needs to bulk up a bit, and his aggressive nature can be used against him at times, but his premium athleticism, production and football IQ is indicative of an impact player in the pros.\n\n5. Troy Franklin, WR, Oregon, Jr., 6-1, 176\n\nFranklin was the No. 3 wide receiver in the 2021 recruiting class. He features a rare size-speed-agility combination and projects to be a major open-field, big-play threat. He produced eight receptions of 40-plus yards last season. For being such a burner, he’s actually a crafty route-runner too, although I’d like to see him expand his route tree. Franklin led the Pac-12 in TD receptions each of the last two seasons, and his 25 career touchdowns are a school-record. Only Marvin Harrison Jr. had more TD catches the last two seasons. Franklin will need to get stronger or NFL press corners will bully him and focus drops are part of the package.\n\n6. Jaylen Wright, RB, Tennessee, Jr., 5-10, 210\n\nWright didn’t start a single game for the Volunteers his sophomore season, but led the team in rushing nonetheless with 875 yards and 10 TDs. He did it again as a full-time starter his junior season, gaining more yards (1,013) despite fewer carries, leading all FBS running backs in yards per carry (7.4). Wright is an explosive back with good size and breakaway speed, a quarter of his runs went for 10-plus yards (tops in the FBS). Mastering pass-protection and securing the football will determine whether he reaches his full potential in the pros.\n\n7. Brandon Dorlus, DT, Oregon, Sr., 6-3, 283\n\nDorlus is a plug-and-play pass rusher from the interior, with an array of pass-rush moves, but he’s kind of a tweener. He primarily played off the edge for the Ducks, but his athleticism won’t translate there in the pros. Still, he’s a high-floor, high-character player who can contribute right away.\n\n8. Tanor Bortolini, OL, Wisconsin, Sr., 6-4, 303\n\nBortolini put on one of the more impressive performances for an O-lineman at the combine, where his 40-yard dash (4.94) tied for second and his two agility runs (4.28 short shuttle and 7.16 three-cone) were first — the three-cone mark broke Jason Kelce’s combine-record for interior lineman. On top of the top-tier athleticism, he’s also highly intelligent (recruited by Harvard and Yale), and features premium versatility. He logged starts at five different positions, including center, both guard positions, right tackle and tight end. Bortolini missed five total games in 2021 and 2022 due to injuries to his right knee.\n\n9. Jaden Hicks, S, Washington St., So., 6-1, 215\n\nHicks is a two-year starter and tone-setting striker who consistently makes plays downhill. His size and athleticism could make him a capable slot eraser in the NFL. Hicks was highly-productive for the Cougars in 2023, producing 79 tackles, including six for a loss, with 2.5 sacks, six passes defensed, two interceptions (one for a TD), a forced fumble and a blocked field goal. I almost certainly would have included him in my 2025 way-to-early mock draft as a potential first-rounder had he returned to Pullman for his junior year.\n\n10. Mason McCormick, OL, South Dakota St., Sr., 6-4, 309\n\nA former no-star recruit, McCormick ended up a three-time team captain and two-time consensus All-American in the FCS for the Jackrabbits. He’s durable, starting 57 straight games, all at left guard, and played in 70 total games in college (he’ll be a 24-year-old rookie). McCormick made the pre-snap adjustments for protections at South Dakota St., a responsibility coaches usually give to the center. McCormick’s athletic testing at the combine placed him in the 99th percentile for offensive linemen, and earned him a Relative Athletic Score of 9.96, which is the seventh-best all-time out of over 1,500 guard prospects.\n\n11. Devontez Walker, WR, North Carolina, Jr., 6-1, 193\n\nThis Kent State transfer made third-team All-ACC and led the Tar Heels in TD receptions (seven) despite missing four games due to an eligibility battle with the NCAA. Walker’s speed is undeniable, but he struggled with drops throughout Senior Bowl week. He also runs a very limited route tree, essentially all vertical outside of the occasional screen, but you draft him as a dangerous field-stretcher and hope he can develop into something more. Walker suffered a torn ACL his senior year of high school.\n\n12. Theo Johnson, TE, Penn St., Jr., 6-6, 259\n\nThe Canadian was the No. 3 tight end in the 2020 recruiting class. Johnson oozes athletic traits, and led the Nittany Lions in TD receptions (seven) last season, but he only topped 50 yards receiving five times in 45 games. I would’ve liked to see more production, but those are the expectations when you’re this talented. His run blocking is below average for his size, but he’s coachable enough to get better. Johnson produced one of the most impressive athletic showcases ever for a tight end at the combine, earning a 9.99 Relative Athletic Score, the second-highest value for the position in the past 37 years.\n\n13. Austin Booker, Edge, Kansas, So., 6-4, 240\n\nBooker was a three-star recruit who also played basketball in high school. It shows up in the crossover he uses against tackles, and an impressive wingspan attached to a wiry frame. He’ll need to get bigger and stronger, but he features a surprising amount of nuance in his pass-rush abilities for someone who barely stepped on the field before 2023. Booker produced eight sacks for the Jayhawks despite only starting one game and has barely played 500 total snaps of collegiate ball.\n\n14. Christian Mahogany, OL, Boston College, Sr., 6-3, 314\n\nMahogany is a big, powerful, tone-setting presence on the interior. He has a bully mentality and presents himself as the bouncer of the pocket. The two-time team captain pulls with ease, and is capable of erasing smaller defenders in his way. He may need to learn patience in the pros once he realizes you can’t go for the knockout every play. Mahogany missed his entire junior season after tearing his right ACL over the summer, but he bounced back in a big way, earning first-team All-ACC honors last year.\n\n15. Caelen Carson, CB, Wake Forest, Jr., 5-11, 193\n\nI wish Carson had more ball production, but he’s a fiery competitor who wins with physicality in coverage and against the run. The four-year starter is also experienced in both man and zone coverage, and versatile enough to play inside or outside. Carson has missed 11 games the last three seasons, and wasn’t able to participate in the Senior Bowl and combine because of a strained left foot.\n\n16. Cade Stover, TE, Ohio St., Sr., 6-3, 247\n\nStover was the No. 7 outside linebacker in the 2019 recruiting class, and didn’t move to the offensive side of the ball full time until 2022, where he became a two-time team captain and two-time All-Big Ten honoree. He has soft, reliable hands (only two drops on 108 collegiate targets) and was a finalist for the John Mackey Award last season. Stover’s basketball background is obvious, the way he locates and adjusts to the ball, and he features enough speed to threaten teams vertically. He still needs to develop as a blocker to be a three-down asset, but he’s certainly a willing participant.\n\n17. DJ James, CB, Auburn, Sr., 5-11, 175\n\nThe Oregon transfer chose to be closer to home after three seasons in Eugene. James led the Tigers in passes defensed both seasons at Auburn and was second-team All-SEC in 2022. Most of his career snaps came on the outside (almost 90 percent), but his size might dictate he competes for a starting nickel role in the NFL.\n\n18. Spencer Rattler, QB, South Carolina, Sr., 6-0, 211\n\nRattler was the No. 1 pro-style quarterback in the 2019 class, spending three seasons with Oklahoma before transferring after being benched in favor Caleb Williams. Rattler’s pocket presence has improved dramatically from his days in Norman. He was a two-time team captain for the Gamecocks after gaining a reputation for immaturity early in his collegiate career. (Hmmm, kids being immature when they first get to college? Weird.) Behind a banged-up offensive line, Rattler threw for the third-most passing yards (3,186) in school history last season. He’s an accurate, fundamentally sound QB with decent arm talent, but he’s almost played exclusively in a shotgun system. Rattler will turn 24 in September.\n\n19. Braelon Allen, RB, Wisconsin, Jr., 6-1, 235\n\nA wrestler since the age of four and national champion on the mat as a freshman in high school, this former four-star recruit at linebacker switched to running back because of depth issues for the Badgers. Allen is super-sized, but features an impressive burst and hitting him high is just a waste of time. Almost 70 percent of his yardage came after contact last season. He’s also one of the better pass-protectors available in this draft at the position. Ball security is an issue (nine fumbles in three season), he doesn’t have much experience as a receiver and his feel for open space is inconsistent, but he’ll only be 20 years old for the entirety of his rookie season so there’s still plenty of time to develop. Allen is the youngest player in this draft class.\n\n20. Jeremiah Trotter Jr., LB, Clemson, Jr., 6-0, 228\n\nTrotter’s father, Jeremiah Sr., was a two-time All-Pro with the Philadelphia Eagles. Junior shares some of his father’s skills such as his ability to fly around, trust his instincts and make plays. He led the Tigers in tackles, tackles for loss and sacks in each of the past two seasons. In coverage, NFL athletes will give him some trouble, but he has the pedigree to adjust.\n\n21. Sedrick Van Pran-Granger, OL, Georgia, Jr., 6-4, 298\n\nVan Pran-Granger was the No. 1 center in the 2020 recruiting class (ahead of Peter Skoronski).\n\nHe was a two-time team captain for a two-time national champion, and stockpiled All-American and All-SEC accolades while in Athens. He’s a finisher in the run game and features enough athleticism, natural instincts and strength to make an impact in pass protection. Van Pran-Granger is battle-tested and capable of eventually taking on a leadership role for whomever drafts him.\n\n22. Audric Estime, RB, Notre Dame, Jr., 5-11, 222\n\nEstime wins with power, agility and balance. He has an average burst through the line of scrimmage, and ran poorly at the combine, but he has enough speed to threaten explosive gains at the second and third level. Estime ranked third in the FBS with 14 carries of 20-plus yards last season. He doesn’t have a lot of experience as a receiver, but he utilizes his size and bulk well in pass protection. Estime led the Irish in rushing as a sophomore and junior (6.2 yards per carry) and set the single-season school record with 18 rushing TDs last season.\n\n23. Ray Davis, RB, Kentucky, Sr., 5-8, 211\n\nDavis was the first college football player to ever rush for 1,000-plus yards at three different FBS programs (Temple, Vanderbilt, Kentucky). He should give a TED Talk on his performance against Florida last season, where he ran for 280 yards and four total TDs. There are bigger and faster running backs than Davis, but his vision, one-cut ability and shiftiness in space makes him a solid prospect for the middle rounds of this draft. He turns 25 in November.\n\n24. Tommy Eichenberg, LB, Ohio St., Sr., 6-2, 233\n\nThe two-time team captain is an old-school thumper with impressive instincts and a relentless motor who thrives playing downhill. However, there are limitations to Eichenberg’s sideline-to-sideline range as a run defender, and he’ll need to work on identifying routes in coverage at the next level.\n\n25. Leonard Taylor, DT, Miami, So., 6-4, 303\n\nTaylor was one of the top recruits at his position coming out of high school. He’s an explosive interior defender who can overwhelm opponents when he’s on his game. He has a pro-ready build, but needs to play with more discipline and awareness to unlock superstar mode.\n\n26. Javon Baker, WR, Central Florida, Sr., 6-1, 202\n\nBaker was buried on the depth chart at Alabama, so he took his talents to Orlando. The athletic play-maker finished second in the nation with 21.9 yards per reception and produced five catches of 50-plus yards last season. Baker has NFL-caliber ball skills, but his hands come and go. He features a nice blend of size, athleticism and physicality, but he needs to fine-tune his route running.\n\n27. Dadrion Taylor-Demerson, S, Texas Tech, Sr., 5-10, 197\n\nThe former three-star recruit at running back won the state championship in the 200 meters (21.66 seconds) as a senior in high school. He’s undersized, and doesn’t possess the type of play strength the position requires, but he runs like the wind and has the instincts and ball skills to potentially thrive as a nickelback. He had never played defense in his life before committing to the Red Raiders and developed into a rangy ball-hawk, who led the team in interceptions the last three seasons.\n\n28. Malik Washington, WR, Virginia, Sr., 5-8, 191\n\nThe senior captain spent four years at Northwestern, before his breakout season with the Cavaliers. Washington set a new ACC-record with 110 receptions and led the FBS with 10 games of 100-plus yards, all coming in his final 11 games. He’s undersized, and needs to develop his route tree, but his instincts and feel for the position are off the charts. Plus, he’s equal parts quick and tough. He produced 35 forced missed tackles last season, which was first among FBS wide receivers. Washington suffered a torn ACL his junior year of high school.\n\n29. Brenden Rice, WR, USC, Jr., 6-2, 208\n\nRice transferred from Colorado in 2022 to play for Lincoln Riley. I feel like I shouldn’t have to say Jerry Rice’s son has reliable hands, but he does. He also uses his size well. During Senior Bowl week, he displayed the physicality he’s capable of bringing to the table, whether it be as a blocker or in a contested-catch scenario. Rice worked mostly with vertical concepts in Riley’s offense, so it’ll be interesting to see him expand his horizons as a route runner in the NFL, considering his DNA. An impressive 12 of his 45 receptions were for a TD (Almost 27 percent) of last season.\n\n30. Javon Solomon, Edge, Troy, Jr., 6-1, 246\n\nSolomon is short for an NFL edge defender, but he balances that with impressive athleticism and an advanced plan-of-attack to rush the passer — he led the FBS with 16 sacks last season. His size could hinder him against the run at the next level, possibly limiting him to a role as a third-down pass-rush specialist.\n\n31. Cam Hart, CB, Notre Dame, Sr., 6-3, 202\n\nThe former three-star recruit started out at wide receiver in South Bend before moving to cornerback during his freshman season. The 2023 team captain earned a spot (No. 32) on Bruce Feldman’s “Freaks List” for his lower-body explosiveness and on-field GPS numbers (23.01 mph). Hart had two interceptions against Wisconsin his sophomore season, but produced zero interceptions in his other 47 collegiate games. However, he did play a significant role in helping to hold Marvin Harrison Jr. in check last September in a 17-14 loss to Ohio State. Hart has a history of shoulder injuries dating back to high school.\n\n32. Isaac Guerendo, RB, Louisville, Sr., 6-0, 221\n\nThe former three-star recruit at wide receiver was an accomplished track athlete in high school, winning a state championship as a senior in Indiana in the 100 meters (10.51 seconds). Guerendo spent five seasons at Wisconsin before transferring to Louisville. He’s an impressive blend of size, agility and toughness, but he only started a single game in college, rushing for 161 yards and three TDs against USC in the Holiday Bowl last season. Guerendo is one of just two 220-plus-pound prospects in the last two decades to run a 4.33-second or better 40-yard dash at the combine, joining DK Metcalf. He missed 23 games combined due to multiple hamstring and foot injuries during his time in Madison.\n\n33. Gabriel Murphy, Edge, UCLA, Jr., 6-2, 247\n\nMurphy was a three-star recruit who transferred from North Texas ahead of the 2022 season. He’s short-armed, but he’s slippery and features a premium mix of athleticism and agility. The Bruins used him in creative ways across various alignments. The versatility will serve him well in the pros.\n\n34. Khyree Jackson, CB, Oregon, Sr., 6-3, 194\n\nJackson was the nation’s No. 4 JUCO recruit when he signed with Alabama before ending up in Eugene. He led the Ducks in interceptions (three) and passes defensed (10) after attending four different programs in the previous five years. He gets handsy, but he showed significant improvement in his approach last season. His rare size and strength points to a bright future as a man-to-man defender in the NFL if he continues his ascension. He will be a 25-year-old rookie.\n\n35. Mohamed Kamara, Edge, Colorado St., Sr., 6-1, 248\n\nKamara doesn’t feature prototypical size and he’ll be a 25 years old as a rookie, but you’d be hard-pressed to find a more productive or tenacious player than the 2023 Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year. He produced 45.5 tackles for loss, 30.5 sacks and five forced fumbles in his five years at Fort Collins.\n\n36. Anthony Gould, WR, Oregon St., Sr., 5-8, 174\n\nThe former three-star recruit was recruited as an athlete because most schools believed he was too small to play wide receiver. Gould features electric speed and shiftiness. He has experience at all three receiver positions for the Beavers, but he only had 100-plus yards twice in the 43 collegiate games (20 starts) he played. His return talent will likely get him on the field first in the pros. Gould was an All-American punt returner his junior season, and led the FBS with 18.3 yards per return, including a pair of touchdowns.\n\n37. Myles Cole, Edge, Texas Tech, Sr., 6-6, 278\n\nCole spent four years at Louisiana-Monroe before transferring to Lubbock. The production doesn’t match the traits, but the former two-star recruit made himself some money at the NFL combine where he showed a rare combination of height, weight and speed. In a class lacking prototypical size, he stands tall (and wide). His wingspan measures to a full 7-foot-3.\n\n38. Will Shipley, RB, Clemson, Jr., 5-11, 206\n\nThe former five-star recruit was also a standout lacrosse player in high school, who won the indoor state championship in the 55-meter dash the only year he ran track. Shipley is a versatile running back with talent as a runner, receiver and kick returner. The two-time All-ACC honoree is the only player in the conference with 2,700-plus rushing yards the last three seasons. Shipley was banged-up throughout college, but he consistently played through injuries.\n\n39. Mekhi Wingo, DT, LSU, Jr., 6-1, 295\n\nScouts are concerned with his length, but Wingo has used his quickness and low center of gravity to his benefit for three seasons as a starter in the SEC — with LSU and Missouri.\n\n40. Khristian Boyd, DT, Northern Iowa, Sr., 6-4, 317\n\nBoyd dominated the Shrine Bowl and his impressive 38 bench press reps at his pro day would’ve been second-best at the combine. These are the types of things an FCS/small-school prospect needs to do during the draft process to get noticed. He features an explosive first step and has proven disruptive against the run. There’s a lot to work with here.\n\n41. Jordan Magee, LB, Temple, Sr., 6-1, 228\n\nMagee was a high school quarterback who became a three-year starter at linebacker for the Owls. He’ll need to add bulk in the pros, but the two-time team captain is an effective blitzer who has proven capable of creating negative plays (23 tackles for loss the last two seasons). Magee can be a special teams contributor right away.\n\n42. Isaiah Davis, RB, South Dakota St., Sr., 6-0, 218\n\nDavis is a power back with nimble feet. The senior team captain led the FCS in rushing last season (1,578) and was instrumental in the Jackrabbits’ back-to-back national championships. Half of Davis’ 24 career 100-yard rushing performances came in the playoffs. He doesn’t appear to get tired towards the end of games or as a season progresses. Davis missed eight games as a sophomore with a left shoulder injury.\n\n43. Daijahn Anthony, S, Ole Miss, Sr., 6-0, 194\n\nThe former no-star recruit began as a walk-on for Shepherd, earning a scholarship, before transferring to Liberty as a preferred walk-on when Shepherd’s season was canceled because of the pandemic. Anthony’s play earned him an opportunity in the SEC with the Rebels as a super senior, where he led the team in interceptions, passes defensed and forced fumbles. He doesn’t feature premium athletic traits, but he brings the pain every time he hits someone. It sounds similar to when a batter in baseball makes contact on the sweet spot of the bat and blasts a moonshot.\n\n44. Cody Schrader, RB, Missouri, Sr., 5-8, 202\n\nThe zero-star recruit spent four seasons at Division II Truman State — leading the NCAA in rushing yards with 2,074 in 2021 — before walking on at Missouri, where he went from seventh on the depth chart when he arrived to leading the SEC in rushing (1,627 yards) last season. Schrader lacks explosiveness, but he balances the ledger with elite vision and fearlessness, plus he’s a capable pass-protector with three-down ability. Schrader will turn 25 in September.\n\n45. Jarvis Brownlee, CB, Louisville, Sr., 5-10, 194\n\nBrownlee spent three up-and-down years at Florida State before joining the Cardinals. He was voted the top cornerback on the American Team during practice at the Senior Bowl, and also had an interception in the game. Brownlee is an aggressive press corner with average size, but above-average competitive toughness.\n\n46. Trey Taylor, S, Air Force, Sr., 6-0, 206\n\nTaylor is quicker than fast, but he features solid size for the position and an embarrassment of riches when it comes to intangibles. He was the first player in school history to win the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation’s top defensive back in 2023. He was also honored with last season’s Defender of the Nation Award, which is given to a player from one of the nation’s service academies based on exceptional leadership qualities, performance on and off the field, and a high standard of integrity. Some teams might shy away based on his speed, but he’s technically proficient at everything he’d be asked to do in the pros. Taylor’s cousin is Pro and College Football Hall of Fame safety Ed Reed.\n\n47. Bucky Irving, RB, Oregon, Jr., 5-9, 192\n\nA former four-star recruit who wanted more playing time, Irving transferred from Minnesota after one season. He’s shifty and punches above his weight-class. Irving surpassed 1,000 yards rushing in each of his two seasons in Eugene and led all FBS running backs in receptions (56) last season. He also protects the football (one fumble on 570 offensive touches). Irving showed a concerning lack of explosiveness at the combine considering his size, but his floor is probably as a complementary back who can make an impact as a third-down specialist.\n\n48. Jared Wiley, TE, TCU, Sr., 6-6, 249\n\nAfter three seasons at Texas, Wiley joined the Horned Frogs in search of a bigger role on offense. He led all FBS tight ends with eight TD receptions as a super senior, five of them coming in the red zone. Wiley features the height and length to play above the rim, with impressive ball skills and a massive wingspan. He has reliable hands, only one drop on 120 collegiate targets, but doesn’t break a lot of tackles and he’s surprisingly ineffective as a blocker for a player of his stature.\n\n49. Jamari Thrash, WR, Louisville, Jr., 5-11, 188\n\nThrash led his team in receptions each of the last three seasons (two at Georgia State, one at Louisville). He’s quicker than fast, but he made plays at all three levels for the Cardinals, including two receptions of 70-plus yards last season. Thrash is a savvy route-runner and a friend to his QB when he’s forced to scramble outside of the pocket. His play strength could be an issue in the pros.\n\n50. Dallin Holker, TE, Colorado St., Jr., 6-3, 234\n\nThe former three-star recruit served his two-year church mission (2019-20) before returning to BYU. Frustrated with his role, Holker transferred to Fort Collins for his junior season and led all FBS tight ends in receptions (64) and receiving yards (767). He received 105 targets in one season with the Rams compared with only 59 in his three seasons with the Cougars. He doesn’t add a lot of value as a blocker, but he’s a smooth athlete in space with good feel for making catches in traffic. Holker had 11 receptions of 20-plus yards last season, third most among FBS tight ends behind only Georgia’s Bowers and Texas’ Sanders. His 15 forced missed tackles also ranked third most among all FBS tight ends. Holker was named team captain for Colorado St. despite only spending a single season on campus.\n\n51. Tyrice Knight, LB, UTEP, Sr., 6-0, 233\n\nKnight wasn’t ranked by recruiting services and was forced to go the JUCO route before ending up in El Paso. He’s proven versatile enough to play inside or outside, and has been a tackling machine for the Miners. Knight finished No. 1 in the FBS in solo tackles in 2023 — 84 of his Conference USA-leading 140 tackles were all him. He plays faster than he tests, with no wasted movement when he’s in pursuit. Knight will be a 24-year-old NFL rookie.\n\n52. Tyler Owens, S, Texas Tech, Sr., 6-2, 216\n\nOwens was the No. 9 safety in the 2019 recruiting class and an accomplished track athlete in high school — he was No. 29 on Bruce Feldman’s “Freaks List” in 2023. After playing primarily on special teams his first two seasons with Texas, Owens entered the transfer portal in a search of more playing time. He’s only started 12 games in five seasons, but he features the type of rare size/speed combo defensive coaches salivate over. He’s also been elite on special teams with 10 career tackles and two blocked punts.\n\n53. Tyrone Tracy Jr., RB, Purdue, Jr., 5-11, 209\n\nThe former three-star recruit at running back played wide receiver at Iowa for four seasons and was a team captain in 2021 before transferring to West Lafayette. Tracy switched back to running back as a super senior, leading the Big Ten in rushing yards per carry (6.3) and scoring nine total TDs, including a 98-yard kick return. His versatility, elusiveness and natural instincts with the ball in his hands are enticing, but overall production was lacking in college, and he will turn 25 in November.\n\n54. Darius Muasau, LB, UCLA, Sr., 5-11, 225\n\nThere are some athletic limitations for the Hawaii transfer, but the production is hard to argue against. Muasau led his team in tackles in each of the last four seasons (two for the Rainbow Warriors, two for the Bruins). He was a special teams MVP as a freshman in Hawaii and has played in all 63 games across five seasons — Bill Parcells famously once said, “Availability is the best ability.” Muasau’s vision, play recognition and tackling acumen will translate at any level.\n\n55. Beau Brade, S, Maryland, Sr., 6-0, 203\n\nBrade was a backup and played special teams until his junior season. As a two-year starter, he produced 170 tackles, 14 passes defensed, eight tackles for loss, three forced fumbles and three interceptions for a program known for producing solid defensive backs. The two-time All-Big Ten honoree led the Terrapins in tackles both seasons and was voted team captain in 2023. Brade possesses adequate athleticism to compete in the pros. He is a capable run defender and doesn’t fall for a quarterback’s tricks in coverage.\n\n56. Beaux Limmer, OL, Arkansas, Sr., 6-4, 302\n\nThe former three-star recruit was also a competitive power-lifter in high school. It showed at the combine, where he led all participants with 39 bench press reps of 225 pounds. Limmer needs to play with better balance, but he’s athletic, tough and durable with starting experience at both guard positions and center. He’d fit perfectly with any team running Kyle Shanahan’s offense or a variation thereof.\n\n57. Nathaniel Watson, LB, Mississippi St., Sr., 6-2, 233\n\nWatson’s size/speed combination and production are impressive. He became the first player to lead the SEC in both tackles (137) and sacks (10) in the same season in 2023. He’s a heat-seeking missile when he has eyes on the ball-carrier, but his tight hips make him a liability in coverage. Watson’s off-field decision-making will also be scrutinized by NFL front offices.\n\n58. Jaheim Bell, TE, Florida St., Jr., 6-2, 241\n\nThe former three-star recruit suffered a torn ACL that ended his senior season of high school. After three seasons with South Carolina, Bell transferred to Tallahassee, where he set career highs in receptions and receiving yards. He was one of 12 FBS tight ends with 35-plus receptions and 500-plus receiving yards. He’s a bit undersized, and a mixed bag as a blocker, but he’s talented with the ball in his hands. Bell’s 8.1 yards-after-catch per reception ranked third among FBS tight ends last season. Both the Gamecocks and Seminoles used him in the backfield, either through motion or at running back, where he would receive carries. He scored three rushing TDs his final season in Columbia and another rushing score with Florida State last year.\n\n59. Brennan Jackson, Edge, Washington St., Sr., 6-4, 264\n\nCoaches will probably like the Temecula native more than scouts do. Jackson is an average athlete with above average play strength, but the two-time team captain wins with all-out hustle and the persistence of a seven year old asking their mother for a candy bar at checkout.\n\n60. Erick All, TE, Iowa, Sr., 6-4, 252\n\nAll was the No. 12 tight end in the 2019 recruiting class and committed to Michigan despite growing up in Ohio. After earning honorable mention All-Big Ten in 2021, spinal surgery limited him to only three games in 2022 and he joined the Hawkeyes through the transfer portal. All appeared in only seven games before an ACL injury ended his season. He led Iowa in receiving yards (299) and receiving TDs (three) despite missing half of the season. When healthy, All has prototypical size and features the athleticism and receiving acumen to threaten defenses at all three levels. He also gives consistent effort as a blocker and is capable of intercepting linebackers at the second level. If he checks out medically, he could develop into a major draft steal.\n\n61. Decamerion Richardson, CB, Mississippi St., Sr., 6-2, 188\n\nThe former three-star recruit barely touched the football in his four seasons with the Bulldogs. Richardson only had 10 passes defensed and no interceptions. However, he’s an excellent tackler. He led all SEC cornerbacks in tackles both his junior and senior seasons. There’s a lot of work to do in coverage, but his top-tier size and elite speed (4.34 40-yard dash at the combine) are catnip for defensive coaches.\n\n62. Tanner McLachlan, TE, Arizona, Sr., 6-5, 244\n\nAfter four years at Southern Utah, the Canadian walked on for the Wildcats (while rehabbing an ACL injury). In two seasons in Tucson, McLachlan earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors as a super senior and broke Rob Gronkowski’s school record for career receptions by a tight end (79 to Gronk’s 75). He has room to grow as a blocker, but his athleticism (he has a knack for hurdling defenders), ball skills and basketball background may foretell a promising NFL ceiling if teams look past his age (he turned 25 in March).\n\n63. James Williams, LB, Miami, Jr., 6-4, 231\n\nWilliams was the No. 1 safety in the 2021 recruiting class, and a top-15 overall prospect nationally. The further he is from the line of scrimmage, the more questions I have, so a defense that utilizes him primarily in the box in attack mode or to neutralize tight ends will likely put him in position to succeed. Williams features outstanding length and premium athleticism, but he’ll need to play with more discipline (17 penalties in his collegiate career, including nine personal foul/unnecessary roughness flags). There are also some durability concerns (he’s had surgeries on his left shoulder and groin).\n\n64. Sataoa Laumea, OL, Utah, Sr., 6-4, 319\n\nThe former four-star recruit became a four-year starter with extensive experience at both right guard (18 starts) and right tackle (26 starts). Laumea is a four-time All-Pac-12 honoree who is scheme-versatile as a run blocker with smooth movement skills and natural power. He needs to be more consistent at sustaining blocks in pass pro and can be susceptible to inside moves. Laumea suffered a sprained MCL and multiple concussions in college.\n\n65. Jacob Cowing, WR, Arizona, Sr., 5-8, 168\n\nThe former two-star recruit and UTEP transfer is an explosive athlete with sprinter speed. Cowing is undersized and his routes lack continuity, but he finished as a two-time All-Conference honoree in Conference USA and the Pac-12. Over 60 percent of his receiving yards (1,,882) in two seasons with the Wildcats came after the catch. His receptions increased in each of his five collegiate seasons. Cowing is the only FBS player with 85-plus receptions in each of the last two seasons.\n\n66. Jaylen Harrell, Edge, Michigan, St., 6-4, 250\n\nThe former four-star recruit’s father, James, was a linebacker at Florida before playing in the NFL and USFL. Harrell features an impressive wingspan, and has room to add extra weight to his frame. He’s shown promise as a run defender and has a legitimate inside spin move he can win with rushing the passer.\n\n67. Tahj Washington, WR, USC, Sr., 5-9, 174\n\nDespite playing for four different head coaches in his five collegiate seasons, Washington was productive when on the field for Memphis and the Trojans. The two-time honorable mention All-Pac-12 honoree is small, there’s no way around it, but he’s also speedy, athletic and fearless. He makes contested catches underneath that others his size can’t. Washington was one of six Pac-12 wide receivers to eclipse 1,000 yards last season, while leading the conference with five receptions of 50-plus yards. He’s an explosive punt and kick returner who also possesses talent as a gunner.\n\n68. Michael Pratt, QB, Tulane, Sr., 6-2, 217\n\nPratt is four-year starter and three-year team captain who has improved every season in New Orleans. His arm talent won’t wow you, but he throws a very catchable ball. Pratt is lacking top-tier physical traits, but he’s developed a nice feel for the game and offensive coaches will appreciate his efficiency, decision-making and light feet in the pocket.\n\n69. Nelson Ceaser, Edge, Houston, Jr., 6-3, 254\n\nCeaser was a productive two-year starter and 2023 team captain for the Cougars. There’s work to do if he’s going to be an asset against the run, but he already has a diverse rush toolbox, including a long-arm bull rush, Eurostep, and an effective spin move as a counter, inside and outside.\n\n70. Nehemiah Pritchett, CB, Auburn, Sr., 6-0, 190\n\nPritchett is long, lean, and extremely fast. He’s special with the ball in his hands. He averaged 27.3 yards per interception return in his career, and 31.3 yards per return as a kick returner his junior season. Pritchett’s tackling technique leaves a lot to be desired, and he’s inconsistent downfield with his back to the ball, but NFL teams are always in the market for the traits he possesses (speed and play-making ability).\n\n71. Ainias Smith, WR, Texas A&M, Sr., 5-9, 190\n\nThere are some off-the-field and durability concerns that need to be cleared up, but the five-year starter was a dynamic playmaker for the Aggies. He blends elusiveness and power with the ball in his hands, becoming the the only 2,000-yard receiver in SEC history to also produce at least 250 yards on rushing attempts, punt returns and kickoff returns. He’s one of better punt returners in this draft class, averaging 10.2 yards per return with a pair of TDs.\n\n72. AJ Barner, TE, Michigan, Sr., 6-6, 251\n\nBarner was a captain at Indiana before transferring to Ann Arbor. He has prototypical size for the position, but lacks the explosive athleticism to be a consistent threat as a receiver. He does have the ability to catch balls in traffic, and can be hard to bring down once he picks up steam. Barner is a technically sound blocker with the toughness and competitive nature teams seek. His ability to consistently get the dirty work done as a blocker in the run game and pass protection will likely earn him a roster spot in the pros. Barner had the largest wingspan among all tight ends at the combine.\n\n73. Dwight McGlothern, CB, Arkansas, Sr., 6-1, 185\n\nThe former four-star recruit spent two years at LSU, but transferred to Fayetteville following head coach Ed Orgeron’s departure. McGlothern allowed only one catch of more than 15 yards in 2023, and led the Razorbacks in interceptions and passes defensed in each of the last two seasons. His outstanding route recognition is indicative of a former wide receiver (he played the position at a high level as a prep). He’s long and disruptive, but he’s an average athlete who will need to develop his technique in the pros.\n\n74. Kitan Oladapo, S, Oregon St., Sr., 6-2, 216\n\nOladapo was a former no-star recruit with a rugby background who was a walk-on for the Beavers, spent six years in Corvallis and was voted team captain in 2023. He isn’t going to wow you with his athleticism, but he’s strong, instinctive and earned All-Pac-12 honors each of the last three seasons. Oladapo would complement a ball-hawking safety, where he could mostly wreak havoc around the line of scrimmage and be utilized as a blitzer.\n\n75. Johnny Wilson, WR, Florida St., Jr., 6-6, 231\n\nA former four-star recruit and Arizona St. transfer, Wilson features rare size and a wingspan made for the hardwood. He isn’t elusive after the catch, but he does break perimeter tackles and rumbles for additional yardage. He doesn’t win as many 50-50 balls as you’d expect, and might benefit from a switch to tight end in the pros. Wilson missed most of his freshman season because of a hamstring injury.\n\n76. Josh Newton, CB, TCU, Sr., 5-10, 190\n\nNewton started 59 games across five seasons in college, starting at the University of Louisiana-Monroe before transferring to Fort Worth in 2022. He could thrive as a press-man coverage defender, but there was definitely a dip in play last season compared to when he first joined the Horned Frogs (especially against Texas’ talented group of receivers).\n\n77. Jaylin Simpson, S, Auburn, Sr., 5-11, 179\n\nThe former four-star recruit spent most of his collegiate career at cornerback before switching to free safety last season. He may be switching back in the pros depending on who drafts him. Simpson earned second-team All-SEC honors in 2023, but most teams will consider him too lean for the position. His above-average athletic traits and ball skills should earn him a shot. Simpson suffered a litany of injuries in high school, including a fractured wrist, turf toe and he had to have ankle surgery.\n\n78. Curtis Jacobs, LB, Penn St., Sr., 6-1, 241\n\nJacobs was a five-star recruit, and the No. 3 outside linebacker in the 2020 recruiting class. The three-year starter checks the size and athleticism boxes, but he never quite fulfilled the hype at State College. I’d like to see more aggression as a tackler, and he’ll have to be more consistent in coverage if he hopes to be more than a backup or special teams contributor in the pros.\n\n79. Sione Vaki, S, Utah, So., 5-11, 213\n\nAfter serving a religious mission, he joined the Utes prior to the 2022 season. Vaki was a finalist for the Hornung Award in 2023, given to college football’s most versatile player — Colorado’s Travis Hunter won. He played safety and running back (520 total yards and five TDs) because of injuries, and became the first Utah defender with two rushing touchdowns in a single game since Eric Weddle in 2006. There are significant limitations in coverage, but the second-team All-American is a productive tackler with a nose for the ball on special teams.\n\n80. Trevor Keegan, OL, Michigan, Sr., 6-5, 310\n\nKeegan was the No. 16 offensive tackle in the 2019 recruiting class. He was voted captain as a senior and started every game at left guard for the 2023 national champs, while earning All-Big Ten honors in each of his three seasons as a starter. Keegan is an average athlete, but he wears a hard-hat to work and has shown improvement every year at Ann Arbor. He was a key member of a Wolverines’ offensive line that won the Joe Moore Award (nation’s top offensive line) in 2021 and 2022.\n\n81. Kalen King, CB, Penn St., Jr., 5-11, 190\n\nKing led all cornerbacks in the country with a 93.3 overall grade and an 18.3 passer rating allowed in single-coverage as a sophomore for the Nittany Lions, according to Pro Football Focus. However, his play took a significant step back in 2023 and he hasn’t tested well during the draft process.\n\n82. Christian Jones, T, Texas, Sr., 6-5, 305\n\nJones is a former three-star recruit who grew up playing soccer with hopes of going professional and had zero prior experience playing football until his junior season in high school. He has athletic limitations that can be covered up by his strength, dogged mentality, outstanding wingspan and huge hands. Jones was a four-year starter and two-time honorable mention All-Big 12 for the Longhorns, with double-digit starts at right tackle (35) and left tackle (13).\n\n83. Jaylan Ford, LB, Texas, Sr., 6-2, 239\n\nThe two-time first-team All-Big 12 linebacker finished with at least 101 tackles and 10 tackles for loss in each of the last two seasons. He also accounted for 10 turnovers (six interceptions and four forced fumbles) over that span. Ford has a tendency to over-pursue and struggles to disengage once a blocker locks on to him, but an NFL strength program and coaching could help alleviate that issue.\n\n84. Javon Foster, T, Missouri, Sr., 6-5, 313\n\nFoster was first-team All-SEC and team captain as a super senior in 2023. He played primarily at left tackle, but he does have experience on the right side. He’s a durable three-year starter whose arm length and cerebral approach as a pass-protector provides more than enough for an offensive line coach to work with. Improving below-average footwork should be the first point of emphasis. Foster’s father (Jerome) was a defensive lineman who was a fifth-round pick (No. 139 overall) in the 1983 NFL Draft, playing four seasons with the Houston Oilers, Miami Dolphins and New York Jets.\n\n85. Brevyn Spann-Ford, TE, Minnesota, Sr., 6-6, 260\n\nThe former three-star recruit struggled badly with drops (nine) this past season, but teams may be intrigued by the potential matchup issues he could create as a big slot target. Spann-Ford led the Gophers in receptions (42) in 2022. He’s an aggressive blocker with impressive size and toughness for the position. There’s no way he gets drafted based on his 2023 performance alone (it was that bad), but he was an ascending player the year before and he possesses enough premium physical traits (something coaches can’t teach) to earn him an opportunity. Spann-Ford caught a 2-yard TD pass from Bo Nix for the National Team in the Senior Bowl.\n\n86. Hunter Nourzad , OL, Penn St., Sr., 6-3, 317\n\nNourzad was a two-time All-Ivy honoree at right tackle for Cornell before transferring to Happy Valley, where he became a two-time All-Big Ten honoree at guard and center. Nourzad is a mauler who gets his kicks punishing anyone attempting to blitz his quarterback. He isn’t an elite athlete, but he’s technically proficient in four of the five offensive line positions. Nourzad turns 25 in November.\n\n87. Ladarius Henderson, T, Michigan, Sr., 6-4, 309\n\nA former three-star recruit with zero football experience prior to his junior season of high school, spent four seasons with Arizona St. before transferring to Ann Arbor. Henderson was a team captain his final year in Tempe and earned first-team All-Big Ten honors his only season with the Wolverines. His playing time was almost evenly split between left tackle (20 starts) and left guard (19 starts). Henderson possesses the athleticism and length an NFL offensive line coach will be happy to work, but there’s a lot of development still required when it comes to technique considering his inexperience.\n\n88. Dylan McMahon, OL, NC State, Sr., 6-3, 299\n\nThe former three-star recruit played all three interior positions for the Wolfpack. McMahon made 22 starts at right guard, 14 starts at center and eight starts at left guard. Before his senior season, his position was almost always dictated by another lineman getting hurt, which speaks to McMahon’s durability and adaptability. His lack of size and play strength only makes him viable at center in the pros, but his solid technique, awareness and movement skills will give him a fighting chance. McMahon was No. 63 on Bruce Feldman’s “Freaks List” in 2022.\n\n89. Aaron Casey, LB, Indiana, Sr., 6-0, 230\n\nCasey is limited in coverage, and his range will be tested against NFL speed, but he’s an enforcer who brings the hammer down when he hits. The Hoosiers’ team captain was the only Division I player with 100-plus tackles and 20-plus tackles for loss in 2023.\n\n90. Javontae Jean-Baptiste, Edge, Notre Dame, Sr., 6-5, 239\n\nJean-Baptiste spent four years at Ohio State before transferring to South Bend. A stomach virus in January caused him to lose 20 pounds, but he was able to regain about half of it back before participating in the Senior Bowl where he struggled. Then he contracted food poisoning right before field testing at the combine, dropping eight pounds overnight. He put together an impressive overall athletic performance despite the bad luck. Jean-Baptiste features a combination of size and movement skills worth taking a chance on day three of the draft.\n\n91. Tyler Davis, DT, Clemson, Sr., 6-2, 301\n\nThere are durability concerns after suffering biceps, knee and ankle injuries in college, but the former four-star recruit is an anchor against the run and capable of pressuring the quarterback when healthy.\n\n92. Qwan’Tez Stiggers, CB, Toronto Argonauts, 5-11, 204\n\nUsually CFL players are free to sign with NFL teams once they complete their contracts, but Stiggers’ case is different because he never played college football. After winning the CFL’s Most Outstanding Rookie award — he produced five interceptions and 12 passes defensed — he declared for the 2024 NFL Draft (and was released from his Toronto contract). Stiggers earned positive reviews at the East-West Shrine Bowl in February, but was snubbed by the NFL Combine. He recently showcased his talents at a pro day, providing solid measurables while running a 4.45 40-yard dash. Stiggers would only be the fourth player in the common era to be drafted into the NFL with no collegiate playing experience.\n\n93. Isaiah Williams, WR, Illinois, Sr., 5-9, 179\n\nA former four-star recruit at quarterback, Williams switched to wide receiver in 2021 and led the Big Ten in receptions (82) last season, becoming the conference’s first player in almost two decades to post back-to-back seasons of 80-plus receptions. The two-time team captain plays bigger than his size, and is capable of using a defender’s leverage against him while varying the speeds of his routes. Williams had 10 fumbles in his collegiate career, including three muffed punt returns.\n\n94. Rasheen Ali, RB, Marshall, Sr., 5-11, 206\n\nAli hits homers with his patience, explosiveness and agility. He was first in the FBS with seven plays of 50-plus yards (six rushes, one reception) last season. However, his durability is a question mark. Ali ruptured his left bicep at the Senior Bowl, which sidelined him for most of the draft process, and he missed the first 10 games of his junior season after suffering an MCL injury. His touchdown production (40 total during his two healthy seasons) and third-down ability should earn him an opportunity at the next level.\n\n95. Andrew Raym, OL, Oklahoma, Sr., 6-4, 314\n\nRaym was a former four-star recruit, and the No. 2 offensive guard in the 2020 class. He took over starting center duties after Creed Humphrey was drafted in 2021. The three-time All-Big 12 honoree is an average athlete with a high football IQ, and will have to win with technique and toughness in the pros.\n\n96. Kendall Milton, RB, Georgia, Sr., 6-1, 225\n\nMilton was the No. 7 running back in the 2020 recruiting class. Everything screams traditional workhorse, but Milton was rarely asked to handle a workhorse load for the talent-rich powerhouse program. He produced nine rushing TDs and 7.9 yards per carry his final five games for the Bulldogs. He’s a bruiser with a nose for the end zone, but he’s an unproven receiver (only 13 career targets). Milton battled numerous injuries (knee, shoulder and groin) during his time in Athens.\n\n97. Kalen DeLoach, LB, Florida St., Sr., 5-11, 210\n\nThe three-year starter looks more like a safety, but only Jared Verse had more sacks for the Seminoles (seven) in 2023. DeLoach is a fast (ran a 4.47 40-yard-dash at the combine), run-and-hit talent with a nose for the football, but he may not have the size or strength to be an every-down player unless he switches positions or he ends up with a creative defensive coordinator. He’s a potential special-teams ace at the next level — 10 career tackles for Florida St.\n\n98. Tulu Griffin, WR, Mississippi St., Sr., 5-10, 181\n\nGriffin was the No. 8 athlete in the 2020 recruiting class. He’s dangerous on reverses and manufactured touches, but he’s undersized and his targets primarily came within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage. Griffin’s speed and talent in the open field will attract suitors. He averaged 29.3 yards per kick return in college, including two return TDs of 90-plus yards.\n\n99. Xavier Thomas, Edge, Clemson, Sr., 6-2, 244\n\nThomas was the No. 3 overall recruit in the 2018 class. After tasting early success with the Tigers, he dealt with injuries and depression (something he’s discussed with NFL teams). Thomas is a bit undersized, but he tested extremely well in Indy and at his pro day. His 4.56 40-yard-dash actually improved from the combine where he ran 4.62. Despite playing six seasons in college, he still relies on pure talent and will require more seasoning in the NFL.\n\n100. Walter Rouse, T, Oklahoma, Sr., 6-5, 314\n\nThe former three-star recruit and Eagle Scout was two-time honorable mention All-Pac-12 in four seasons at Stanford before joining the Sooners for his final collegiate season. Rouse improved significantly during his short amount of time in Norman. He features functional athleticism, but coaches will appreciate his size and intelligence. Rouse has played exclusively as a left tackle (52 starts) but could be considered as a solid swing tackle prospect with some upside."
