        "text": "How do you pick between five Heisman Trophy winners and an all-time great safety (No. 20)? How do you compare a 1980s wide receiver to a 2010s quarterback to a 1920s fullback (No. 1)?\n\nPicking the best player to wear every number in college football is a tall task. Placing numbers on uniforms officially began in 1915, and in the ensuing century-plus, numerous stars have worn every number from 1-99. That’s what happens when college football players have just four years, and in many cases less than that, to craft a résumé.\n\nThough a handful of choices are obvious because numbers were worn by the most transcendent college stars, most have debates between two or sometimes several more worthy candidates.\n\nIt can be difficult to avoid being heavily influenced by what players did as professionals, but these choices are based on college accomplishments. Because of the extensive scope of the sport, the starting point here was players who have received the highest of honors in college football: Heisman winners (and top contenders), consensus first-team All-Americans and College Football Hall of Fame inductees, with other deserving names considered when applicable.\n\nA panel of The Athletic’s college football editors made the selections, with writing contributions from across the staff.\n\n1: Anthony Carter, Michigan\n\nCarter returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown in his first game at Michigan, setting the tone for a career that would make him one of college football’s most electrifying players. Carter left Michigan in 1982 as the school’s career leader with 3,076 receiving yards and 37 receiving touchdowns, including a memorable game-winner against Indiana, and was fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting as a senior after two previous top-10 finishes. — Austin Meek\n\nHonorable mentions: Kyler Murray, Oklahoma; Larry Fitzgerald, Pitt; Ernie Nevers, Stanford; Percy Harvin, Florida; Tavon Austin, West Virginia; Braylon Edwards, Michigan; Charles Rogers, Michigan State; Ken Swilling, Georgia Tech; Ja’Marr Chase, LSU; Mike Williams, USC\n\n2: Charles Woodson, Michigan\n\nA throwback to the era of two-way stars, Woodson remains the only defensive player to win the Heisman Trophy in the modern era. He returned a punt for a touchdown against Ohio State in 1997 to help Michigan complete an undefeated regular season, then recorded an interception in a Rose Bowl victory against Washington State that earned the Wolverines a share of the national championship. — Austin Meek\n\nHonorable mentions: Cam Newton, Auburn; Johnny Manziel, Texas A&M; Deion Sanders, Florida State; Derrick Henry, Alabama; Chase Young, Ohio State; Adoree’ Jackson, USC; Chris Canty, Kansas State; Mike Doss, Ohio State; Derrick Strait, Oklahoma; Sammy Watkins, Clemson; Jerry Gray, Texas; Malcolm Jenkins, Ohio State; Willis McGahee, Miami; Jamar Fletcher, Wisconsin; Tim Couch, Kentucky; Deon Figures, Colorado; David Palmer, Alabama; J.K. Dobbins, Ohio State\n\nKeyshawn Johnson’s 102 catches in 1995 set the single-season Pac-10 and USC records. Getty Images\n\n3: Keyshawn Johnson, USC\n\nThe 1990s were largely a forgettable decade for USC, but Johnson was its brightest star. In two seasons, Johnson posted 168 catches, 2,796 yards and 16 touchdowns. He was a unanimous All-American in 1995 and is the only receiver in the past three decades to go No. 1 overall in the NFL Draft. — Antonio Morales\n\nHonorable mentions: Carson Palmer, USC; Joey Harrington, Oregon; Joe Montana, Notre Dame; Roquan Smith, Georgia; Trent Richardson, Alabama; Vic Beasley, Clemson; Bill McColl, Stanford; Anthony Poindexter, Virginia; Tripp Welborne, Michigan; Marlin Jackson, Michigan; Aqib Talib, Kansas; Derwin James, Florida State; Lee Evans, Wisconsin; Todd Gurley, Georgia; Tony Eason, Illinois; Kevin Faulk, LSU\n\n4: Deshaun Watson, Clemson\n\nWatson makes a strong case as the greatest player to come through Clemson. The quarterback finished his three-year career 32-3 as a starter with 10,163 passing yards and 116 total touchdowns. He capped off the 2016 season by delivering the program its first national championship since 1981. — Grace Raynor\n\nHonorable mentions: Champ Bailey, Georgia; Terence Newman, Kansas State; Charles Alexander, LSU; Devin Hester, Miami; Steve Fuller, Clemson; Byron Hanspard, Texas Tech; Brett Favre, Southern Miss; Jerry Jeudy, Alabama; Plaxico Burress, Michigan State; DeAngelo Hall, Virginia Tech; Jim Harbaugh, Michigan; Roy Williams, Texas; Dalvin Cook, Florida State; Steve Walsh, Miami\n\n5: Reggie Bush, USC\n\nThough Bush gave back his Heisman and has been disassociated from USC for 10 years, his legacy as college football’s most electrifying playmaker this century still lives on. In three seasons, Bush totaled 6,551 total yards and 42 touchdowns and captured the imagination of the nation with his cutbacks, spins and transcendent skill. — Antonio Morales\n\nHonorable mentions: Christian McCaffrey, Stanford; Kenny Easley, UCLA; Jameis Winston; Florida State; Paul Hornung, Notre Dame; Manti Te’o, Notre Dame; Darren McFadden, Arkansas; Michael Crabtree, Texas Tech; LaDainian Tomlinson, TCU; Larry Johnson, Penn State; Terry Hanratty, Notre Dame; Jabrill Peppers, Michigan; Antoine Cason, Arizona; Donovan McNabb, Syracuse; Derrick Brown, Auburn; Edgerrin James, Miami; Garrison Hearst, Georgia; Pat White, West Virginia; Marquise Brown, Oklahoma\n\nOnly six players are ahead of Baker Mayfield on the NCAA all-time passing yardage list, but his career will not be replicated by anyone. Peter G. Aiken / Getty Images\n\n6: Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma\n\nMayfield — a two-time walk-on — is arguably the greatest player in Sooners history. In three seasons, he threw for 12,292 yards, 119 touchdowns and 21 interceptions with three Big 12 titles and two Playoff appearances. He was a top-four Heisman finisher all three years, winning it in 2017. — Jason Kersey\n\nHonorable mentions: Dave Brown, Michigan; Paul Palmer, Temple; Tim Dwight, Iowa; Santana Moss, Miami; Quentin Jammer, Texas; Chuck Cecil, Arizona; Robbie Bosco, BYU; Harry Kipke, Michigan; Jerome Bettis, Notre Dame; DeAndre Hopkins, Clemson; Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Alabama; Thomas Jones, Virginia; Tyrone Wheatley, Michigan; Jordan Lynch, Northern Illinois; Tevin Coleman, Indiana; Antrel Rolle, Miami; Graham Harrell, Texas Tech; Marc Wilson, BYU\n\n7: Danny Wuerffel, Florida\n\nSteve Spurrier’s Fun ‘N’ Gun offense got a lot of the credit for the numbers Wuerffel posted, but Wuerffel put up those numbers by being the perfect quarterback for Spurrier’s offense. Wuerffel threw the fade better than anyone, and he averaged more than 10 yards an attempt in each of his two full seasons as Florida’s starter. His senior season in 1996, he threw for 3,625 yards and 39 touchdowns — winning the Heisman Trophy and leading the Gators to their first national title. — Andy Staples\n\nHonorable mentions: Michael Vick, Virginia Tech; Jadeveon Clowney, South Carolina; John Elway, Stanford; Tyrann Mathieu, LSU; Mel Hein, Washington State; Eric Crouch, Nebraska; Leonard Fournette, LSU; Pat Sullivan, Auburn; Joe Theismann, Notre Dame; John Huarte, Notre Dame; Ted Ginn, Ohio State; Michael Bishop, Kansas State; Brandin Cooks, Oregon State; Patrick Peterson, LSU; Michael Huff, Texas; Toby Gerhart, Stanford; Byron Leftwich, Marshall; Chris Gamble, Ohio State; David Klingler, Houston; Mark Carrier, USC; Collin Klein, Kansas State; Rick Leach, Michigan; Bert Jones, LSU; Brad Banks, Iowa\n\n8: Davey O’Brien, TCU\n\nThe smallest player to ever win the Heisman (5-foot-7, 151 pounds) backed up Sammy Baugh to start his career and shined when he got his shot, leading the Horned Frogs to an undefeated season and national championship in 1938. — Max Olson\n\nHonorable mentions: Lamar Jackson, Louisville; Marcus Mariota, Oregon; Troy Aikman, UCLA; Jalen Ramsey, Florida State; Julio Jones, Alabama; A.J. Green, Georgia; Marvin Harrison, Syracuse; Deltha O’Neal, Cal; Brick Muller, Cal; Rex Grossman, Florida; Napoleon Kaufman, Washington\n\n9: Joe Burrow, LSU\n\nBurrow shattered passing records. He was efficient. He took big shots downfield. He evaded sacks. He broke big runs. He took down seven top-10 opponents in one season. He took LSU out of the Stone Age and led maybe the best offense in NCAA history. The Heisman winner achieved everything. — Brody Miller\n\nHonorable mentions: Steve McNair, Alcorn State; Peter Warrick, Florida State; Major Harris, West Virginia; Marqise Lee, USC; Derek Barnett, Tennessee; Amari Cooper, Alabama; Jim McMahon, BYU; Don McPherson, Syracuse; Lawyer Milloy, Washington; Dat Nguyen, Texas A&M; Tony Rice, Notre Dame; Jaylon Smith, Notre Dame; Mark Herrmann, Purdue; Jeremy Maclin, Missouri; David Boston, Ohio State; Bradley Chubb, NC State; Josh Doctson, TCU; Mario Williams, NC State; Travis Etienne, Clemson; Tommy Kramer, Rice\n\nVince Young prevented a USC three-peat with a legendary Rose Bowl performance. Wally Skalij / Getty Images\n\n10: Vince Young, Texas\n\nYoung probably would have put up even bigger numbers had he played on a less-talented team, but the fact that the 2005 Longhorns scored an astonishing 81 touchdowns in 13 games — three years before the clock rules changed to incentivize tempo — is a testament to Young’s dominance. And when he needed to play like the best player on the field, he did. With two Heisman Trophy winners (Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush) on the other sideline in the Rose Bowl following that 2005 season, Young put up the most dominant single-game performance in the sport’s history. — Andy Staples\n\nHonorable mentions: Robert Griffin III, Baylor; Troy Smith, Ohio State; Derrick Brooks, Florida State; Babe Parilli, Kentucky; Ed Oliver, Houston; Paul Giel, Minnesota; Chase Daniel, Missouri; Steve Slaton, West Virginia; Jimmy Saxton, Texas; Art Schlichter, Ohio State; Bobby Engram, Penn State; Tajh Boyd, Clemson; Devin Bush, Michigan; Ryan Shazier, Ohio State; Marshawn Lynch, Cal; Brady Quinn, Notre Dame; Chad Pennington, Marshall; AJ McCarron, Alabama; Steve Bartkowski, Cal; Thomas Davis, Georgia; Rex Kern, Ohio State\n\n11: LaVar Arrington, Penn State\n\nThe two-time All-American and 1999 Bednarik and Butkus Award winner compiled a staggering highlight reel with a knack for blocking kicks, chasing down ball carriers and even leaping over the entire line and landing on running backs, showing off nearly unmatched pure athleticism for a linebacker. — Matt Brown\n\nHonorable mentions: Steve Spurrier, Florida; Matt Leinart, USC; Andre Ware, Houston; Terry Baker, Oregon State; Kellen Moore, Boise State; Bo McMillin, Centre; Derrick Johnson, Texas; Teddy Lehman, Oklahoma; Antwaan Randle El, Indiana; Isaiah Simmons, Clemson; Alex Smith, Utah; Ken Dorsey, Miami; Chris McAlister, Arizona; Drew Bledsoe, Washington State; Dede Westbrook, Oklahoma; Hart Lee Dykes, Oklahoma State; Casey Weldon, Florida State; Antoine Winfield, Ohio State\n\n12: Roger Staubach, Navy\n\nThe 1963 Heisman Trophy winner led Navy to a No. 2 final ranking that season, and he is the last service academy player to win the award. He finished his career with a then-school-record 4,253 yards of total offense and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981. — Chris Vannini\n\nHonorable mentions: Doug Williams, Grambling; Charles White, USC; Andrew Luck, Stanford; Colt McCoy, Texas; Shawn Moore, Virginia; Earl Thomas, Texas; Jake Gibbs, Ole Miss; Kerry Collins, Penn State; Trent Dilfer, Fresno State; Bob Griese, Purdue; Joe Namath, Alabama\n\nKenny Washington was UCLA’s first All-American and first College Football Hall of Fame inductee. (Photo by Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images)\n\n13: Kenny Washington, UCLA\n\nWashington led the NCAA in total offense and earned All-America honors in 1939. His legacy extends beyond that: Washington was one of four black players on his team, along with Jackie Robinson, Woody Strode and Ray Bartlett — a rarity at that time — and broke the NFL’s color barrier in 1946. — Christian Caple\n\nHonorable mentions: Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama; Dan Marino, Pitt; Gino Torretta, Miami\n\n14: Ty Detmer, BYU\n\nThe 1990 Heisman Trophy winner threw for 5,188 yards that season, breaking 59 NCAA records and tying three others by the end of his career. His 16,206 career passing yards (including bowl games) were more than 4,000 yards greater than the next closest player at the time and are still fifth-most in FBS history. — Chris Vannini\n\nHonorable mentions: Don Hutson, Alabama; Terry Hoage, Georgia; Vinny Testaverde, Miami; Sam Bradford, Oklahoma; Johnny Lattner, Notre Dame; Eric Berry, Tennessee; Clint Frank, Yale; Josh Heupel, Oklahoma; Jerry Tagge, Nebraska; Joe Hamilton, Georgia Tech; Carlos Rogers, Auburn; Todd Blackledge, Penn State; Craig Morton, Cal; Chuck Fusina, Penn State; Timmy Chang, Hawaii\n\n15: Tim Tebow, Florida\n\nA quarterback and one of the most accomplished players in college football history, Tebow helped Florida win the 2006 and ’08 BCS championships, while he became the first sophomore to win the Heisman and was a finalist twice more. He still holds the SEC career record with 145 touchdowns responsible for. — Stewart Mandel\n\nHonorable mentions: Tommie Frazier, Nebraska; Myles Garrett, Texas A&M; Ezekiel Elliott, Ohio State; Drew Brees, Purdue; Mike Phipps, Purdue; Sandy Stephens, Minnesota; Dak Prescott, Mississippi State; Colt Brennan, Hawaii\n\n16: Peyton Manning, Tennessee\n\nManning finished his career with 11,201 passing yards and 89 touchdown passes, leaving Rocky Top with 33 school records, seven SEC records and two NCAA records. He led Tennessee to 32 wins over his final three seasons and threw 36 touchdowns as a senior. — David Ubben\n\nHonorable mentions: Jim Plunkett, Stanford; Chris Weinke, Florida State; Gary Beban, UCLA; Jake Plummer, Arizona State; Chuck Long, Iowa; Russell Wilson, NC State and Wisconsin; Troy Edwards, Louisiana Tech; Brad Smith, Missouri; Trevor Lawrence, Clemson; Ryan Leaf, Washington State; Rodney Peete, USC; Len Dawson, Purdue; J.T. Barrett, Ohio State\n\nCharlie Ward was one of the most evasive quarterbacks any defensive player ever faced. Rich Pilling / Sporting News via Getty Images\n\n17: Charlie Ward, Florida State\n\nImagine being so good at sports that you can win the Heisman Trophy and then decline to participate in the NFL pre-draft process because you’re probably going to be a first-round pick in the NBA Draft. That was Ward, a true dual-threat QB who would have annihilated defenses in today’s offenses and who likely would have wound up an NFL quarterback in the current game. Instead, he led Florida State to its first national title in 1993 and then embarked on a 10-year NBA career. — Andy Staples\n\nHonorable mentions: Gordie Lockbaum, Holy Cross; Jerry Rhome, Tulsa; Don Meredith, SMU; Johnny Mack Brown, Alabama; Philip Rivers, NC State; Billy Kilmer, UCLA\n\n18: Archie Manning, Ole Miss\n\nA three-year starter at Ole Miss, Manning threw for 4,753 yards and 31 touchdowns over the course of his college career. He finished in the top four of Heisman Trophy voting twice and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989. He is the patriarch of the so-called First Family of Football and the father of Cooper, Peyton and Eli. — Nicole Auerbach\n\nHonorable mentions: Jason White, Oklahoma; Jim Leonhard, Wisconsin; Roman Gabriel, NC State; Vernon Davis, Maryland; J.J. Stokes, UCLA; Cade McNown, UCLA; Tre’Davious White, LSU; Dale Carter, Tennessee; Gene Washington, Stanford; Billy Lothridge, Georgia Tech\n\n19: Eric Dickerson, SMU\n\nThe leader of the Pony Express rushed for 4,450 yards, scored 48 touchdowns and finished third for the Heisman Trophy in 1982 while splitting carries with Craig James throughout his career.

Tittle, LSU; Ka’Deem Carey, Arizona; Matt Forte, Tulane\n\n26: Sean Taylor, Miami\n\nThe 6-3, 225-pound hard-hitting All-American safety became an idol for thousands of high school and college players over the past two decades. He played a role for an all-time great national championship team in 2001 as a freshman, then intercepted 14 passes in two years as a starter . — Manny Navarro\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Woodson, Purdue; Saquon Barkley, Penn State; Landon Collins, Alabama; Vaughn Dunbar, Indiana; Lawrence Elkins, Baylor; J.C. Caroline, Illinois; Clinton Jones, Michigan State\n\n27: Joe Bellino, Navy\n\nThe 1960 Heisman Trophy winner did it all.

He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977. — Chris Vannini\n\nHonorable mentions: Eddie George, Ohio State; Irving Fryar, Nebraska; Al Wilson, Tennessee; Terrell Buckley, Florida State; Johnnie Johnson, Texas; Hank Lauricella, Tennessee; Benny Friedman, Michigan; Thomas Everett, Baylor; Nick Chubb, Georgia; Steve Atwater, Arkansas\n\nMarshall Faulk averaged 6.6 yards per play from scrimmage in his career with the Aztecs. Mike Powell / Allsport / Getty Images\n\n28: Marshall Faulk, San Diego State\n\nA breathtaking all-purpose back, Faulk finished as the Heisman runner-up in 1992 and followed it up with a fourth-place finish in ’93, when he ran for 1,530 yards and gained 644 receiving. In three seasons, he gained 5,562 all-purpose yards and scored 62 touchdowns. — Stewart Mandel\n\nHonorable mentions: Anthony Davis, USC; Adrian Peterson, Oklahoma; Troy Davis, Iowa State; Montee Ball, Wisconsin; Warrick Dunn, Florida State; Wilbert Montgomery, Abilene Christian; Dee Milliner, Alabama; Bob Ward, Maryland; George Cumby, Oklahoma; C.J. Spiller, Clemson; James Washington, Oklahoma State\n\n29: Rickey Dixon, Oklahoma\n\nDixon was a Jim Thorpe Award winner and All-America safety for Barry Switzer in the late 1980s, helping the Sooners to the 1985 national championship. He played several NFL seasons and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2019. — Jason Kersey\n\nHonorable mentions: Minkah Fitzpatrick, Alabama; Jarvis Jones, Georgia; Leon Hall, Michigan; Russell Carter, SMU; Eric Turner, UCLA; Hugh Gallarneau, Stanford\n\n30: Mike Rozier, Nebraska\n\nThe landslide 1983 Heisman winner over Steve Young and Doug Flutie, Rozier remains Nebraska’s all-time leading rusher. His 2,148 yards as a senior ranked then as the second-most nationally in a season. And his 7.81-yard average stands as the highest figure among 29 all-time 2,000-yard rushing seasons. — Mitch Sherman\n\nHonorable mentions: Greg Pruitt, Oklahoma; Napoleon McCallum, Navy; Alex Wojciechowicz, Fordham; James Lofton, Stanford; Wes Fesler, Ohio State; LaRon Landry, LSU; Chuba Hubbard, Oklahoma State\n\n31: Paul Posluszny, Penn State\n\nPosluszny joins Shane Conlan as iconic No. 31s at Linebacker U. Posluszny led three consecutive top-10 scoring defenses nationally, won the Bednarik Award as the nation’s top defender twice and served as the defensive centerpiece of a Penn State turnaround that resulted in the 2005 Big Ten title. — Matt Brown\n\nHonorable mentions: Shane Conlan, Penn State; Vic Janowicz, Ohio State; Dre Bly, North Carolina; Aaron Ross, Texas; Darqueze Dennard, Michigan State; Aaron Glenn, Texas A&M; Jim Grabowski, Illinois\n\n32: Johnny Lujack, Notre Dame\n\nWhen Heisman winner Angelo Bertelli moved to active military duty during the 1943 season, Lujack stepped in to finish a national championship season.

South Carolina swooped in offering opportunity, and boy did the Gamecocks ever deliver on that. Rogers still holds the school record for carries (954) and rushing yards (5,204), and he is South Carolina’s only Heisman Trophy winner. — Josh Kendall\n\nHonorable mentions: Roy Williams, Oklahoma; John Michels, Tennessee; Sam Francis, Nebraska; Burr Baldwin, UCLA; Ed Bock, Iowa State; T.J. Hockenson, Iowa\n\n39: John Kimbrough, Texas A&M\n\nThe Aggies haven’t won a national title since 1939, when Kimbrough barreled through opposing defenses as a hard-driving fullback who scored both touchdowns in a 14-13 Sugar Bowl win to finish an unbeaten season. He returned in 1940 for a second consecutive All-America season, finishing as the Heisman runner-up. — Matt Brown\n\nHonorable mentions: Larry Csonka, Syracuse; Curtis Enis, Penn State; E.J. Junior, Alabama; Sam Cunningham, USC\n\n40: Howard Cassady, Ohio State\n\nA Buckeye through and through, Cassady used to sneak into Ohio Stadium as a kid growing up in Columbus. Later, he became Ohio State’s third Heisman Trophy winner and a key piece of the 1954 national champions. In his final game, he had an interception and a touchdown against Michigan, finishing his career as a two-time All-American. All these years later, he’s still top five in all-purpose yards in program history. — Bill Landis\n\nHonorable mentions: Luke Kuechly, Boston College; Devin White, LSU; Dana Howard, Illinois; Von Miller, Texas A&M; Mike Alstott, Purdue; Elroy Hirsch, Wisconsin and Michigan; Ron Simpkins, Michigan; Eddie Lee Ivery, Georgia Tech; Mike Haynes, Arizona State; Leon Heath, Oklahoma\n\nGlenn Davis was a Heisman winner and two-time runner-up. Army West Point Athletics\n\n41: Glenn Davis, Army\n\nThe 1946 Heisman Trophy winner was a three-time consensus All-American, rushing for 2,309 yards (8.7 per carry) and 36 touchdowns as “Mr. Outside.” He also caught 12 more touchdown passes. Army went 27-0-1 during his career, and Davis was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1961. — Chris Vannini\n\nHonorable mentions: Keith Byars, Ohio State; Josh Allen, Kentucky; Rob Lytle, Michigan; Charlie Flowers, Ole Miss; Travis Prentice, Miami (Ohio); Ian Johnson, Boise State\n\n42: Ronnie Lott, USC\n\nLott is one of the greatest safeties in the history of the sport as a member of Pro Football, College Football and USC athletics Halls of Fame. He was a four-year letterman and consensus All-American in 1980, when he led the NCAA with eight interceptions. He was also a member of the Trojans’ 1978 national title team. — Antonio Morales\n\nHonorable mentions: Ricky Bell, USC; Chuck Muncie, Cal; Lenny Moore, Penn State; Dick Kazmaier, Princeton; Marshall Goldberg, Pitt; Sid Luckman, Columbia; Bob Suffridge, Tennessee; Christian Wilkins, Clemson; E.J. Henderson, Maryland; Jevon Kearse, Florida; Paul Warfield, Ohio State, Terry Kirby, Virginia\n\n43: Troy Polamalu, USC\n\nLike Lott, Polamalu is also one of the greatest safeties in football history. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame last year and will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year. At USC, he was a two-time All-American (2001 and 2002) and was eventually selected to the Pac-12’s All-Century team after he posted 281 tackles and six interceptions in four seasons with the Trojans. — Antonio Morales\n\nHonorable mentions: Terry Kinard, Clemson; Rod Shoate, Oklahoma; Bob Crable, Notre Dame; Darren Sproles, Kansas State; Antonio Langham, Alabama; Dave Ball, UCLA; Terry Miller, Oklahoma State; Joe Routt, Texas A&M; Johnny Bright, Drake\n\n44: Jim Brown, Syracuse\n\nIs Brown the best player to never win the Heisman? The four-sport star exited Syracuse with 2,091 rushing yards … and eight interceptions. Brown is one of many reasons why the No. 44 carries such lore with the Orange, who retired the number in 2005 before bringing it back in 2015. — Matt Fortuna\n\nHonorable mentions: Ernie Davis, Syracuse; Floyd Little, Syracuse; Brian Bosworth, Oklahoma; John David Crow, Texas A&M; Dan Morgan, Miami; Kyle Rote, SMU; Ray Guy, Southern Miss; Tony Gonzalez, Cal; George Taliaferro, Indiana; Andre Williams, Boston College; Bobby Majors, Tennessee; Dallas Clark, Iowa; Brian Urlacher, New Mexico; Robert Jones, East Carolina\n\n45: Archie Griffin, Ohio State\n\nCollege football’s only two-time Heisman winner rushed for 5,589 yards in his Buckeyes career, a mark that will likely never be matched. Woody Hayes called him “the best football player I’ve ever seen.” Griffin started in four Rose Bowls, and Ohio State went 40-5-1 with Griffin as its starting running back. — Bill Landis\n\nHonorable mentions: Sammy Baugh, TCU; Johnny Majors, Tennessee; Herman Hickman, Tennessee; Carlos Alvarez, Florida; Glenn Dobbs, Tulsa; Andy Katzenmoyer, Ohio State; Art Monk, Syracuse\n\nBob Ferguson averaged five yards per carry and won a national title with the Buckeyes. Julian C. Wilson / Associated Press\n\n46: Bob Ferguson, Ohio State\n\nThe power back rushed for 2,162 yards in his career, No. 2 all-time at Ohio State when his career ended. They say he was never tackled for loss in his career. The College Football Hall of Famer, Maxwell Award winner and two-time unanimous All-American finished No. 2 in the Heisman voting to Ernie Davis in 1961. The margin of 53 points was the third-closest ever. — Bill Landis\n\nHonorable mentions: Khalil Mack, Buffalo; Roosevelt Leaks, Texas; Harry Newman, Michigan; Bill Enyart, Oregon State\n\n47: Bennie Oosterbaan, Michigan\n\nOosterbaan was an all-around star who earned All-America honors in both football and basketball at Michigan in the 1920s. He was regarded as one of the best pass-catchers of his era and threw three touchdown passes against Ohio State in 1927, the day Michigan Stadium was dedicated. He went on to coach the Wolverines from 1948 to 1958. — Austin Meek\n\nHonorable mentions: David Pollack, Georgia; A.J. Hawk, Ohio State; Chris Hudson, Colorado; Nick Eddy, Notre Dame; Dicky Maegle, Rice; Michael Irvin, Miami; Woodrow Lowe, Alabama; Ottis Anderson, Miami\n\n48: Terrell Suggs, Arizona State\n\nYou often hear a player is unstoppable, and it’s often a stretch. But maybe not in the case of T-Sizzle. In high school, Suggs was a standout running back. At Arizona State, he used that explosiveness at defensive end. Put simply, he was a nightmare. In 2002, Suggs posted 24 sacks and 31.5 tackles for loss, which set school, Pac-10 and NCAA records. — Doug Haller\n\nHonorable mentions: Gale Sayers, Kansas; Angelo Bertelli, Notre Dame; Otto Graham, Northwestern; Ki Aldrich, TCU; Percy Snow, Michigan State; Chet Moeller, Navy; Johnny Karras, Illinois\n\nJulius Peppers also honed his footwork as an on-court contributor to the Tar Heels’ men’s basketball team, which helped make him an even better defender on the football field. Craig Jones / Allsport\n\n49: Julius Peppers, North Carolina\n\nPeppers finished his three-year career at North Carolina with 30.5 sacks and 53 tackles for loss, which both rank second in UNC history. His 15 sacks in 2000 led the nation, and he was a unanimous first-team All-American in 2001. In 2001, he won the Bednarik Award winner as the nation’s top defensive player. He went on to be picked second overall in the 2002 NFL Draft. — Nicole Auerbach\n\nHonorable mentions: Patrick Willis, Ole Miss; Sedrick Ellis, USC; Bob Mathias, Stanford; Bob Chappuis, Michigan\n\n50: Dick Butkus, Illinois\n\nThe Butkus Award goes to the nation’s best linebacker. Butkus, however, also played center. The versatile hitter was a two-time consensus All-American, finished third in the 1964 Heisman voting and led the Illini to the 1963 Big Ten and Rose Bowl titles. — Matt Fortuna\n\nHonorable mentions: Dave Rimington, Nebraska; Bob Pellegrini, Maryland; Chris Zorich, Notre Dame; Reese Dismukes, Auburn; Jeff Hartings, Penn State; Frank Emanuel, Tennessee; Jerry Groom, Notre Dame\n\n51: Jim Ritcher, NC State\n\nRitcher earned consensus All-America honors in each of his last two years and anchored the offensive line for the Wolfpack’s last ACC championship team in 1979, when he became the first center to win the Outland Trophy. — Matt Brown\n\nHonorable mention: Pat Fitzgerald, Northwestern; Kevin Hardy, Illinois; Kurt Burris, Oklahoma; Brandon Spikes, Florida; Joshua Garnett, Stanford; Harry Olszewski, Clemson; Randy Cross, UCLA\n\n52: Ray Lewis, Miami\n\nOne of the NFL’s greatest linebackers didn’t win any championships in his time with the Hurricanes (1993-95), but he earned All-American honors in his final two years, finished runner-up to Kevin Hardy for the Butkus Award as a junior in 1995 and ranks sixth all-time in tackles at The U. — Manny Navarro\n\nHonorable mentions: Harry Gilmer, Alabama; Jack Del Rio, USC; David DeCastro, Stanford\n\n53: Randy Gradishar, Ohio State\n\nOne of three Buckeyes to finish in the top six of the 1973 Heisman vote, Gradishar left Ohio State that year as the program’s all-time leading tackler. His 320 stops are still No. 12 in OSU history, and he had 22 tackles in one game against Washington State in ’73. Woody Hayes called the two-time All-American “the greatest linebacker I ever coached.” — Bill Landis\n\nHonorable mentions: Jerry Tubbs, Oklahoma; Glenn Ressler, Penn State; Clay Shiver, Florida State; D.D. Lewis, Mississippi State; Greg Jones, Michigan State; Corey Simon, Florida State; Ray Childress, Texas A&M\n\n54: Bruce Smith, Minnesota\n\nSmith’s stirring Heisman Trophy acceptance speech in 1941 may precede his football prowess, but the halfback was just as electric in guiding Minnesota to consecutive national titles. In 1940, Smith scored three game-winning touchdowns. With Smith as the backbone, the 1941 Gophers were even more powerful, outscoring foes 186-38. — Scott Dochterman\n\nHonorable mentions: Lee Roy Jordan, Alabama; Bob Johnson, Tennessee; Dwight Freeney, Syracuse; Dominic Raiola, Nebraska; Tom Brahaney, Oklahoma; Bruce Clark, Penn State\n\n55: Derrick Thomas, Alabama"
