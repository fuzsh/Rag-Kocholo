Dwyane Wade followed a few days later. BUFFALO, N.Y. -- A Buffalo Bills fan group uncovered documents that suggest a Toronto-based prospective ownership group has plans to relocate the franchise north of the border. In a release issued Thursday, the Buffalo Fan Alliance identified several announcements referring to Rogers Communications consultant, Roger Rai, as part of the ownership group \"attempting to acquire and move the Buffalo Bills to Toronto.\" Rai told The AP on Wednesday hes not involved with the groups ownership bid. He added the references connecting him to the proposed Bills purchase were \"a mistake on my behalf,\" and the result of a misinterpretation made by a co-worker who wrote the biography. The alliance, made up of fans, former Bills players and business leaders, said the references made in the documents \"would seem to cast further doubt on the credibility\" of the Toronto groups assurances to keep the Bills in Buffalo. Rogers is part of a Bills prospective ownership group that includes rocker Jon Bon Jovi and Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. The Associated Press has verified the documents exist. One of the references to Rai was included in an announcement issued in July by Marketwired, a Toronto-based press release distribution company. Another was included in Rais biography published in a public filing in January announcing a special meeting to approve Primary Petroleums merger with Keek Inc. Rai is listed as Keeks vice-president of business development. The announcements also to refer to Rai as someone who \"assists in sports ownership affairs of Rogers Communications and was responsible for the acquisition of the Toronto Blue Jays,\" which the company purchased in 2000. Collin Sexton Jersey. Rai said he first became aware of the error when the reference was published in a release on July 8 announcing his appointment to Pinetree Capitals board of directors. A day later, Marketwired issued an updated release removing any mention of Rais ties to Rogers, except that he held various managerial positions at the company. The Bills are on the market after Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March. And questions of the franchises long-term future in Buffalo have been an issue throughout the sale process. Though a lease agreement essentially locks the Bills into playing at Ralph Wilson through the 2019 season, there is a one-year opt-out clause that would allow them to move in 2020. Last month, Bon Jovi attempted to address questions regarding his ownership plans in a seven-paragraph letter published in The Buffalo News. He wrote it was his objective \"to carry on the legacy of Ralph Wilson and make the Bills successful in Buffalo.\" A person familiar with the sale process told The AP that the Toronto group attended a presentation on Tuesday during which Bills officials provided extensive financial and background information on the franchise. A second person said Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula attended a similar presentation on Wednesday. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the sale is private. New York real estate mogul Donald Trump also attended a presentation last week. The presentations are an opportunity for prospective ownership groups to gain information to prepare formal bids, which are expected to be submitted within three weeks.

What color would that be? Well, I would say orange but PRADA‘s interpretation would be “papaya”. Truthfully papaya can be used all year round but it just feels more appropriate this time of year with Halloween and Thanksgiving upon us. This Saffiano Executive Tote bag by PRADA (prada.com) in papaya is the perfect functional accessory for the man on the go. It’s practical, sturdy, sleek lines and craftsmanship exude luxury that has become the PRADA signature. It is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable names in fashion. This Italian luxury fashion house has been providing beautiful pieces in every aspect of fashion since 1913. It was founded by Mario Prada and was originally known as Prada Brothers. They began making and selling shoes, leather handbags and trunks. The classic PRADA trunk was originally made of heavy walrus skin. In 1978, Miuccia Prada, Mario’s granddaughter, spearheaded the company’s expansion into clothing that became a favorite among us mere mortals and celebrities worldwide. On a side note, Miu Miu (miumiu.com), was named after Miuccia Prada and launched in 1992. The men’s ready-to-wear collections also launched in the mid 1900’s and the first menswear shop opened in Los Angeles in 1998. PRADA‘s nylon tote was one of their first biggest releases, which was also designed by Miuccia. To this day they still provide the nylon tote for their faithful fashionistas and fashionistos. Aside from the one-0f-a-kind and sophisticated bags and clothing, PRADA also provides fragrances, eyewear, jewelry, cell phones (yes, cell phones), cosmetics and confectionary.

Bob is the Chairman and CTO of ADS. Prior to founding the company, he was a senior fellow at Pratt & Whitney leading turbomachinery CFD development and application efforts. FLOW: How did you get your start with CFD? BOB: I joined Pratt in 1974, and the company really started to invest in CFD in the early 1980s. it was still in its infancy then and only able to handle simple 2D problems, but it became clear that CFD could serve as a kind of virtual test rig with the potential to reduce redesign, improve safety and contain costs. FLOW: From an industry standpoint, what were some of the specific requirements you had for CFD? BOB: To get the operational requirements we went to our engine designers. They told us that it had to be something they could trust, meaning that it had to be independent and not subject to user biases. It had to provide the highest resolution into problems and deliver valid answers for a variety of geometries it had never encountered. Ultimately, it had to mimic the physics and do it in design time. FLOW: That sounds challenging. BOB: Yes, but we took it in steps and persevered. Our foundation was a process by which learnings were never lost but always captured to augment our predictive capability. We consistently applied our methodology and never took shortcuts; we knew we wanted a continuous chain of accountability, because that's what building trust meant to us. And during the course of my 28 year tenure we did in fact develop great confidence in the CFD because that chain of accountability was not broken. The CFD increasingly became a \"system of truth\" for exploring uncharted design spaces, so we protected the integrity of the model vigorously. When data and simulations did not match, we studied all sides of the problem before incorporating the knowledge into our model. It took years and a lot of sweat, but it's clear that CFD truly helped the company deliver some of the world's most capable turbomachines. FLOW: What led you to found ADS? BOB: It's a funny story. I retired from Pratt in 2003 with an intent to play golf, travel and eat lots of sushi, but my side consulting work quickly became a passion. As part of that consulting I began a search for codes that I felt I could count on for turbomachinery aero, but I just couldn't find something with the appropriate domain expertise and industry bent to make me feel comfortable. So after a year I took out a clean sheet of paper and started working on a solver an mesher that would let me analyze designs with confidence and stand up to the rigors of modern turbomachinery design. This led to the founding of ADS. FLOW: What were some of the key design principles you embraced for your CFD? BOB: First, I wanted to craft CFD that turbomachinery clients could use to design with confidence. I'd learned how to achieve this at Pratt and wanted to impart the best of my experiences into ADS CFD. Second, I wanted CFD that could address modern turbomachinery design challenges. Third, I wanted to bring these aerospace-class capabilities to the broader turbomachinery market to empower designers at large to be their best. FLOW: Let's elaborate. What do you mean by \"design with confidence?\" BOB: \"Confidence\" is a very subjective word, but to me it means that the CFD consistently discerns design improvements from design mistakes. CFD that when used correctly, serves as a system of truth for exploring new design spaces. Confidence also means CFD that's ready for use out of the box, without having to invest years of effort to mature and adapt a generic code to specific needs. Given my background, I believed I could capture and reflect the learnings I'd accumulated over the years in applying CFD to compressor and turbine design challenges. FLOW: What are the \"modern turbomachinery design challenges\" you allude to? BOB: Whether it be a jet engine, a turbocharger or industrial compressor, it's pretty clear that the path to higher performance and efficiency is to reduce size and operate at higher temperatures. This requires designer insight into the adverse time-varying flow phenomena impacting performance and durability--in other words, time accurate analysis. I therefore set my sights on delivering a solver that was designed from the ground up for unsteady analysis, and fast enough to be applied inside tight commercial design windows. FLOW: How are you making your CFD more accessible to turbomachinery designers? BOB: I'm a big believer that turbomachinery aero designers deserve best-in-class, turbomachinery-specific CFD. We aim to make turbomachinery CFD more accessible by distilling it down to its absolute essence: CFD that has been amply matured in compressor and turbo design, CFD that reduces a myriad of simulation options to the ones that really count, CFD that speaks the language of turbomachinery, and CFD that automates workflows so that designers can focus on design, not on debugging meshes or writing custom scripts. FLOW: Are there any common pitfalls for companies seeking to take better advantage of CFD for turbomachinery aero? BOB: The biggest pitfall has less to do with the CFD itself, but rather the analysis methodology by which it is used. No amount of talent or CFD horsepower can overcome a faulty analysis process. This problem is becoming more prevalent as CFD expands its reach downmarket to organizations less experienced in its proper application. Often, the best way for these companies gain their footing is to draw on mentorship from outside experts or CFD vendors like us. FLOW: Thanks, Bob. BOB: My pleasure.

Today the company revealed Shoelace, a new social network centered around finding people with similar interests and meeting in up with them in the real world. A lot of people organize events using Facebook, so it's definitely a worthwhile niche to chase after. You can create a listing for an event or activity you're participating in, and invite friends and strangers to join you. More news: Over 370000 sign petition to release rapper A$AP Rocky Then, each day you'll see nearby events - which Shoelace thematically calls \"Loops\" - that match those interests you've selected. While Google says it plans to eventually bring Shoelace to cities around the United States, there seems to be no immediate thoughts of launching the service internationally. Believed to have been first reported by Android Police, the search giant's experimental 'Area 120' team has now launched a new hyper-local news service called Shoelace that also doubles up as a social network of sorts. Contradicting most expectations, Google has announced Shoelace, a social networking app that lets people connect using different activities. \"It's great for folks who have recently moved cities or who are looking to meet others who live nearby\". It is now being tested exclusively in NY, but if it proves successful, a wider roll-out could be in the cards. More news: Rob Gronkowski catches passes from Tom Brady It's now invite-only, and promises to help you \"connect with others who have the same interests.\". \"We also work hard to make sure that everything you see in Shoelace - from profiles to Loops - is aligned with our House Rules and community standards\". Even after the shut down of Google+, which was meant to be a Facebook-competitor but it could never quite get to where Google imagined it, the company is reportedly working on another social network.

Photo by Napa Valley Register THE Filipino community in Los Angles is still in shock over last Wednesday’s mass shooting in a bar in Thousand Oaks where a Fil-American college novice was among those who died. In a phone interview, Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles, Adel S. Cruz, expressed sadness over the death of Alaina Housley, 18, a resident of Napa Valley. He said the news has devastated Filipino Americans even more, as they try to absorb the news of the senseless death of 12 people. Consul General Adelio Angelito Cruz Photo © Philippine Consulate General Los Angeles California Cruz said he has talked to Housley’s grandfather, Ernie Punzalan, who lives in a valley around Los Angeles. “I told him that the Philippine Consulate General is ready to assist and help in whatever way possible,” Cruz said. Earlier in his Facebook post, Cruz expressed shock and sadness over what he called “senseless and brutal mass shootings in Thousand Oaks, California.” “My deepest condolences and prayers to her family and the families of the other victims of this tragedy.” To drive home a point, Cruz also sent to local media entities a link to the “Gun Violence Archive” at www. Gunviolencearchive.org The site seeks to provide free online access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. Meanwhile, former executive at the Philippine Department of Tourism in Los Angeles Manny Ilagan, broke the news of Housley’s death to the Filipino American community through a post in his Facebook page. “So Sorry to be the bearer of a heartbreaking news — One of the victims in the Thousand Oaks shooting incident is a grandchild of a family friend Fil Am couple,” wrote Ilagan in his post. Ilagan added that Alaina was the daughter of Hannah Punzalan and Arik Housley, and grandchild of Ernesto and Leticia Punzalan. Alaina was the niece of host Tamera Mowry-Housley and her husband Adam Housley. “I was blessed to know you ever since you were five. You stole my heart,” the TV personality wrote in her Instagram account. “I will miss our inside jokes, us serenading at the piano. Thank you for being patient with me learning how to braid your hair, and I will never forget our duet singing the national anthem at Napa’s soccer game.” Alaina started at the Pepperdine University in August. She was a resident of DeBell house, an English major involved with the Pepperdine Choir and was starting Mock Trial. Thousand Oaks is situated 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Suspected gunman Ian David Long. Photo by Sky News Reports said a 28-year-old US Marine veteran Ian David Long entered the Borderline Grill and Bar at about 11 pm on Wednesday night (November 7) where a “college night” was being held. Armed with a Glock .45 caliber pistol, Long went inside the bar at started shooting at people. He killed 12 people, including a Ventura County Sheriff’s sergeant Ron Helus. Helus was on the phone talking to his wife when he heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. About 200 people were believed to be in the country music bar during the shooting, many of them students from nearby colleges.

Any documents relating to the running of UTC, to UTC’s teaching curriculum, or to research done at UTC, can be deposited and archived here. With a floor area of 200m² and storage stacks equipped with mobile and fixed shelving, the storage capacity is approximately 1890 linear meters. Accessing the archive center : The archive center reception desk, for UTC personnel and for the general public, is the desk of the Royallieu library (at the Centre de Recherches). Archive material is to be deposited on the ground floor of the archive center, near the gate on \"Rue du Docteur Schweitzer\". The role of UTC’s archive services UTC has had a full-time archivist since December 2004. The role of the archive services is to collect and conserve documents produced and received by UTC as part of its activities, and to make them available to those who wish to view them. The archive services decide which documents are archived, and how they are conserved and made available. Archived documents come from UTC’s administrative divisions and from its different academic departments and research labs. In this way the archive services are creating what is intended to be a resource for historians of UTC, a repository of material to record and exhibit UTC’s administrative, scientific and educational heritage. The UTC archives The earliest archived UTC documents go back to the beginning of the 1970s and there are press cuttings relating to UTC that are dated 1969. The archives include minutes of all meetings of the University Board (“Conseil d’administration”) since 1972, and of the Executive Board (“Directoire”) since 1973. They also include the earliest student magazines, yearbooks, student guides, course catalogues, collections of statistics, and group photos. The earliest reports produced by UTC end-of-semester examination panels have also been collected and classified. The archives of Guy Denielou, UTC’s founding president, and those of subsequent presidents, secretaries-general and chiefs of staff have been put together over a series of moves and transfers and represent a valuable resource for historians of UTC. Collections of documents relating to administration, research and teaching are regularly added to the archives. Examples include the Vocational Training archive, the Industrial Design archive, and the Acoustics and Vibrations Division archive. In terms of volume, UTC’s archive of photographs and images forms only a small part of the whole, but it is nevertheless of great interest: black and white photographs by UTC’s celebrated photographer Jean-Pierre Gilson, posters, negatives from research labs, and so on. The audiovisual archive includes hundreds of VHS and U-matic videocassettes recording events such as graduation ceremonies, conferences, joint projects with industry and overseas institutions, and student activities. It also includes a number of filmed lectures. Only a small part of the whole has been completely classified or pre-classified. One archive that has so far been classified is the Guy Denielou archive. Access to the archives is subject to the regulations concerning access to public archives, and in addition it depends on to what extent any requested archive has been classified.

Their songs chart decently enough by mid-tier girl group standards, their Orange Caramel sub-unit is a big hit, they’ve got a handful of members with successful solo activities, and they’ve got some presence as hallyu stars in both China and Japan. That’s why I’m surprised to learn that the girls are desperate to make a full group comeback in Korea, but it’s Pledis’ lack of finances that’s stopping them. Queen of Trot Lizzy and Onew’s Mrs. Robinson Jungah have both expressed their desire for an After School comeback over social media recently, with Lizzy revealing that it’s a lack of cash that’s standing in their way. “We need money for a comeback but we don’t have any… I also want one [a comeback],” Lizzy wrote. How bad is Pledis doing that they can’t afford to fund an After School comeback? I know they lost Son Dam Bi and Hello Venus and that Nu’est crashed and burned, but I assumed they’d be getting some dough from Orange Caramel and UEE. After School hasn’t promoted in Korea since 2013’s romantic stripper anthem “First Love,” so I’m guessing that Avex Trax has been paying for their Japanese activities for the past few years. Perhaps Pledis invested all their money into Seventeen and have now gone broke? A 13-member boy band can’t be cheap, especially one that was in the works for years before they even debuted. At least Seventeen’s been successful so far, so that’s something. Whatever happens, I hope Pledis doesn’t disband After School. I stand by the group’s graduation concept and have always thought that it’s a great idea when used properly. My advice is for Pledis to keep After School in the basement until they get enough cash to do the group’s long-awaited comeback justice, and then relaunch with a handful of graduations (UEE and Jungah, obviously) and a number of fresh new members. Maybe even do a survival program, something similar to The KARA Project, and have Kahi and Jungah as judges. And it wouldn’t be a bad idea to rehire Shinichi Osawa, who did the group’s ridiculously good Japanese singles “Heaven” and “Shh,” although his sound might not be commercial enough for Korea. Either way, I look forward to an After School comeback. I refuse to give up hope!

Brain enhancers fall into two different categories: naturally occurring substances like Ginkgo biloba, creatine and phenibut; and manmade prescription drugs, like Adderall, and over-the-counter supplements such as Noopept. Two additional studies assessed the effects of d-AMP on visual–motor sequence learning, a form of nondeclarative, procedural learning, and found no effect (Kumari et al., 1997; Makris, Rush, Frederich, Taylor, & Kelly, 2007). In a related experimental paradigm, Ward, Kelly, Foltin, and Fischman (1997) assessed the effect of d-AMP on the learning of motor sequences from immediate feedback and also failed to find an effect. Potassium citrate powder is neither expensive nor cheap: I purchased 453g for $21. The powder is crystalline white, dissolves instantly in water, and largely tasteless (sort of saline & slightly unpleasant). The powder is 37% potassium by weight (the formula is C6H5K3O7) so 453g is actually 167g of potassium, so 80-160 days’ worth depending on dose. If you’re concerned with using either supplement, speak to your doctor. Others will replace these supplements with something like Phenylpiracetam or Pramiracetam. Both of these racetams provide increased energy levels, yielding less side-effects. If you do plan on taking Modafinil or Adrafinil, it’s best to use them on occasion or cycle your doses. The Trail Making Test is a paper-and-pencil neuropsychological test with two parts, one of which requires shifting between stimulus categories. Part A simply requires the subject to connect circled numbers in ascending order. Part B requires the subject to connect circled numbers and letters in an interleaved ascending order (1, A, 2, B, 3, C….), a task that places heavier demands on cognitive control. Silber et al. (2006) analyzed the effect of d-AMP on Trails A and B and failed to find an effect. But where will it all stop? Ambitious parents may start giving mind-enhancing pills to their children. People go to all sorts of lengths to gain an educational advantage, and eventually success might be dependent on access to these mind-improving drugs. No major studies have been conducted on the long-term effects. Some neuroscientists fear that, over time, these memory-enhancing pills may cause people to store too much detail, cluttering the brain. Read more about smart drugs here. Nootropics are a great way to boost your productivity. Nootropics have been around for more than 40 years and today they are entering the mainstream. If you want to become the best you, nootropics are a way to level up your life. Nootropics are always personal and what works for others might not work for you. But no matter the individual outcomes, nootropics are here to make an impact! Most diehard nootropic users have considered using racetams for enhancing brain function. Racetams are synthetic nootropic substances first developed in Russia. These smart drugs vary in potency, but they are not stimulants. They are unlike traditional ADHD medications (Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, etc.). Instead, racetams boost cognition by enhancing the cholinergic system. …Phenethylamine is intrinsically a stimulant, although it doesn’t last long enough to express this property. In other words, it is rapidly and completely destroyed in the human body. It is only when a number of substituent groups are placed here or there on the molecule that this metabolic fate is avoided and pharmacological activity becomes apparent. In the nearer future, Lynch points to nicotinic receptor agents – molecules that act on the neurotransmitter receptors affected by nicotine – as ones to watch when looking out for potential new cognitive enhancers. Sarter agrees: a class of agents known as α4β2* nicotinic receptor agonists, he says, seem to act on mechanisms that control attention. Among the currently known candidates, he believes they come closest “to fulfilling the criteria for true cognition enhancers.” The hormone testosterone (Examine.com; FDA adverse events) needs no introduction. This is one of the scariest substances I have considered using: it affects so many bodily systems in so many ways that it seems almost impossible to come up with a net summary, either positive or negative. With testosterone, the problem is not the usual nootropics problem that that there is a lack of human research, the problem is that the summary constitutes a textbook - or two. That said, the 2011 review The role of testosterone in social interaction (excerpts) gives me the impression that testosterone does indeed play into risk-taking, motivation, and social status-seeking; some useful links and a representative anecdote: My general impression is positive; it does seem to help with endurance and extended the effect of piracetam+choline, but is not as effective as that combo. At $20 for 30g (bought from Smart Powders), I’m not sure it’s worthwhile, but I think at $10-15 it would probably be worthwhile. Sulbutiamine seems to affect my sleep negatively, like caffeine. I bought 2 or 3 canisters for my third batch of pills along with the theanine. For a few nights in a row, I slept terribly and stayed awake thinking until the wee hours of the morning; eventually I realized it was because I was taking the theanine pills along with the sleep-mix pills, and the only ingredient that was a stimulant in the batch was - sulbutiamine. I cut out the theanine pills at night, and my sleep went back to normal. (While very annoying, this, like the creatine & taekwondo example, does tend to prove to me that sulbutiamine was doing something and it is not pure placebo effect.) An additional complexity, related to individual differences, concerns dosage. This factor, which varies across studies and may be fixed or determined by participant body weight within a study, undoubtedly influences the cognitive effects of stimulant drugs. Furthermore, single-unit recordings with animals and, more recently, imaging of humans indicate that the effects of stimulant dose are nonmonotonic; increases enhance prefrontal function only up to a point, with further increases impairing function (e.g., Arnsten, 1998; Mattay et al., 2003; Robbins & Arnsten, 2009). Yet additional complexity comes from the fact that the optimal dosage depends on the same kinds of individual characteristics just discussed and on the task (Mattay et al., 2003). None of that has kept entrepreneurs and their customers from experimenting and buying into the business of magic pills, however. In 2015 alone, the nootropics business raked in over $1 billion dollars, and web sites like the nootropics subreddit, the Bluelight forums, and Bulletproof Exec are popular and packed with people looking for easy ways to boost their mental performance. Still, this bizarre, Philip K. Dick-esque world of smart drugs is a tough pill to swallow. To dive into the topic and explain, I spoke to Kamal Patel, Director of evidence-based medical database Examine.com, and even tried a few commercially-available nootropics myself. Took pill #6 at 12:35 PM. Hard to be sure. I ultimately decided that it was Adderall because I didn’t have as much trouble as I normally would in focusing on reading and then finishing my novel (Surface Detail) despite my family watching a movie, though I didn’t notice any lack of appetite. Call this one 60-70% Adderall. I check the next evening and it was Adderall. Bacopa is a supplement herb often used for memory or stress adaptation. Its chronic effects reportedly take many weeks to manifest, with no important acute effects. Out of curiosity, I bought 2 bottles of Bacognize Bacopa pills and ran a non-randomized non-blinded ABABA quasi-self-experiment from June 2014 to September 2015, measuring effects on my memory performance, sleep, and daily self-ratings of mood/productivity. Because of the very slow onset, small effective sample size, definite temporal trends probably unrelated to Bacopa, and noise in the variables, the results were as expected, ambiguous, and do not strongly support any correlation between Bacopa and memory/sleep/self-rating (+/-/- respectively). Common environmental toxins – pesticides, for example – cause your brain to release glutamate (a neurotransmitter). Your brain needs glutamate to function, but when you create too much of it it becomes toxic and starts killing neurons. Oxaloacetate protects rodents from glutamate-induced brain damage.[17] Of course, we need more research to determine whether or not oxaloacetate has the same effect on humans. When I spoke with Jesse Lawler, who hosts the podcast Smart Drugs Smarts, about breakthroughs in brain health and neuroscience, he was unsurprised to hear of my disappointing experience. Many nootropics are supposed to take time to build up in the body before users begin to feel their impact. But even then, says Barry Gordon, a neurology professor at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, positive results wouldn’t necessarily constitute evidence of a pharmacological benefit. Although piracetam has a history of “relatively few side effects,” it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “We don’t use it at all and never have.” I take my piracetam in the form of capped pills consisting (in descending order) of piracetam, choline bitartrate, anhydrous caffeine, and l-tyrosine. On 8 December 2012, I happened to run out of them and couldn’t fetch more from my stock until 27 December. This forms a sort of (non-randomized, non-blind) short natural experiment: did my daily 1-5 mood/productivity ratings fall during 8-27 December compared to November 2012 & January 2013? The graphed data28 suggests to me a decline: Since dietary supplements do not require double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmaceutical-style human studies before going to market, there is little incentive for companies to really prove that something does what they say it does. This means that, in practice, nootropics may not live up to all the grandiose, exuberant promises advertised on the bottle in which they come. The flip side, though? There’s no need to procure a prescription in order to try them out. Good news for aspiring biohackers—and for people who have no aspirations to become biohackers, but still want to be Bradley Cooper in Limitless (me). The important factors seem to be: #1/MR6 (Creativity.self.rating, Time.Bitcoin, Time.Backups, Time.Blackmarkets, Gwern.net.linecount.log), #2/MR1 (Time.PDF, Time.Stats), #7/MR7 (Time.Writing, Time.Sysadmin, Time.Programming, Gwern.net.patches.log), and #8/MR8 (Time.States, Time.SRS, Time.Sysadmin, Time.Backups, Time.Blackmarkets). The rest seem to be time-wasting or reflect dual n-back/DNB usage (which is not relevant in the LLLT time period). Your mileage will vary. There are so many parameters and interactions in the brain that any of them could be the bottleneck or responsible pathway, and one could fall prey to the common U-shaped dose-response curve (eg. Yerkes-Dodson law; see also Chemistry of the adaptive mind & de Jongh et al 2007) which may imply that the smartest are those who benefit least23 but ultimately they all cash out in a very few subjective assessments like energetic or motivated, with even apparently precise descriptions like working memory or verbal fluency not telling you much about what the nootropic actually did. It’s tempting to list the nootropics that worked for you and tell everyone to go use them, but that is merely generalizing from one example (and the more nootropics - or meditation styles, or self-help books, or getting things done systems - you try, the stronger the temptation is to evangelize). The best you can do is read all the testimonials and studies and use that to prioritize your list of nootropics to try. You don’t know in advance which ones will pay off and which will be wasted. You can’t know in advance. And wasted some must be; to coin a Umeshism: if all your experiments work, you’re just fooling yourself. (And the corollary - if someone else’s experiments always work, they’re not telling you everything.) Another ingredient used in this formula is GABA or Gamma-Aminobutyric acid; it’s the second most common neurotransmitter found in the human brain. Being an inhibitory neurotransmitter it helps calm and reduce neuronal activity; this calming effect makes GABA an excellent ingredient in anti-anxiety medication. Lecithin is another ingredient found in Smart Pill and is a basic compound found in every cell of the body, with cardiovascular benefits it can also help restore the liver. Another effect is that it works with neurological functions such as memory or attention, thus improving brain Effectiveness. Accordingly, we searched the literature for studies in which MPH or d-AMP was administered orally to nonelderly adults in a placebo-controlled design. Some of the studies compared the effects of multiple drugs, in which case we report only the results of stimulant–placebo comparisons; some of the studies compared the effects of stimulants on a patient group and on normal control subjects, in which case we report only the results for control subjects. The studies varied in many other ways, including the types of tasks used, the specific drug used, the way in which dosage was determined (fixed dose or weight-dependent dose), sample size, and subject characteristics (e.g., age, college sample or not, gender). Our approach to the classic splitting versus lumping dilemma has been to take a moderate lumping approach. We group studies according to the general type of cognitive process studied and, within that grouping, the type of task. The drug and dose are reported, as well as sample characteristics, but in the absence of pronounced effects of these factors, we do not attempt to make generalizations about them. He used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn’t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics — some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers — said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation. l-Theanine – A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that concurrent caffeine and l-theanine use had synergistic psychoactive effects that promoted alertness, attention, and task switching;[29] these effects were most pronounced during the first hour post-dose.[29] However, the European Food Safety Authority reported that, when L-theanine is used by itself (i.e. without caffeine), there is insufficient information to determine if these effects exist.[34]\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0070.json.gz/line38\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.603981\n\n0.396019\n\nHome Forums > Football > College Football Stars > Brandon Wegher Discussion in 'College Football Stars' started by white lightning, Sep 12, 2009. Page 9 of 9 < Prev 1 ← 4 5 6 7 8 → 9 Borussia Guru Not the best outcome so far here for BW. At minimum he should try to just get back to a school and see if he can earn a scholarship. Preferably close to home. A school such as N. Iowa or Iowa St, etc. Besides football opportunities, he needs to at least finish his degree and do something positive with his life. Something obviously went sour between BW and the Iowa coaches. Although this is not the end of the world for BW. Maybe he would be wise and see if he can patch things up with the young lady and settle down with her and see if they can make it work. There is no confirmed fact that any 2nd girl got pregnant. If that was indeed the case though, this really complicates things big time. I can understand some of you guys berating BW for his choices, but imho the whole purpose of sites such as Caste is to support our athletes and young men and women in their greatest time of need. It's easy to love and support folks when they are on top. It's lonely for people when they screw up. Have some compassion and many young people make poor choices. Yes, this is not exactly getting drunk at a party and getting into a fight or something. It's much more life altering for BW. Having said that, it's not a bad thing and will (hopefully) make BW grow up faster and focus his life. Really, something is truly off with 'white people' when it comes to having children, especially when young. You notice this streak of embarrassment or that they are not happy at beautiful new babies. in the grand scheme, this is a wonderful thing. BW and the Mom should be thrilled. You think those millions of Mexicans would be upset and shamed at a new born? LOL, no way, that's a celebration to them. That is what they so. Wait until this rumor of a 2nd girl getting pregnant and who it may be before passing total judgment on BW. BW needs to get his a$$ back to a school and focus his life. Maybe he should marry the girl and raise a family together. Good luck to BW and let us hope none of you ever make a poor choice in life.

There is a lot to be said about how everyone is there when things are going great but it shows true character to stand behind someone when things aren't so hot. Reminds me of the Tracy Lawrence: \"Everybody wants to slap your back wants to shake your hand when you're up on top of that mountain But let one of those rocks give way then you slide back down look up and see who's around then This ain't where the road comes to an end This ain't where the bandwagon stops This is just one of those times when A lot of folks jump off\" Electric Slide, Apr 12, 2011 AJ Newbie Old thread but ill post my opinion anyway. Wegher transfered from iowa because he was not given a fair shot to start, he was going start the season #3 RB and He actually wanted to play some safety but the coaches wouldnt let him. <div></div><div>He left OU because he would have to sit out another year even tho he didnt play in 2010 which was bs. The whole him getting Adam Robinsons sister pregnat is bstoo ARob doesnt have a sister</div> AJ, Jun 26, 2011 My guess is he has to sit this season out correct? whiteathlete33, Jun 26, 2011 White Power Mentor Where is he going to play college ball? White Power, Jun 26, 2011 He would have had to sit out this year as well at oklahoma.<div></div><div></div>I bet he ends up at a FCS school like UNI or south dakota state. I've heard he wanted to go to uni instead of oklahoma but one thing or another didnt work out. hawkeye Guru Why does he have to sit out yet last year Jeremiah Masoli didn't have to sit out when he tranfered to Mississippi. hawkeye, Jun 28, 2011 hawkeye said: all NCAA Division I players that transfer to another Division I school must sit out one year, per NCAA guidelines. the lone caveat to this rule was recently introduced (off the top of my head, i think it was put into place two years ago), and it allows players who have graduated (academically) to transfer to another school for graduate school if A) they still have one year of athletic eligibility remaining, and B) the new school has a Master's program that their previous school did not that they wish to enroll in. that's why Masoli could transfer without penalty and Wegher couldn't. Jimmy Chitwood, Jun 28, 2011 Riddlewire Master According to a post on an Iowa State fan forum, Wegher has enrolled at a JUCO for the fall, Iowa Western Community College. I can find no evidence of this on their website. Although JUCOs don't generally make media announcements for transfer students.

Mackintosh Chair, c.1903 Ebonised oak and beech and original rush This chair comes from a set of 137 designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for the Willow Tea Rooms, Glasgow. It was probably made by Alexander Martin, Glasgow, and is one of a pair. A chair, c.1903. The tall and narrow ladder back is dished to accommodate the sitter between angled rectangular back posts; the trapezoid slip seat is rushed and raised on slender square legs, joined by a spindle front stretcher and with double side stretchers. H: 41” (104cm) Seat height: 16 ½ ” (42cm) W:18 ” (46cm) D: 15 ½ “ (39cm) Designer/Maker C. R. Mackintosh Oak, beech, and possibly other woods, rush. This design was first produced for the Willow Tea Rooms, Glasgow, which opened in 1904. The back is formed of two oak posts into which the curved slats or ‘rungs’ are tenoned. The seat rails are presumably tenoned into the back posts and into the tops of the front legs, the front rail likewise. There is an additional seat rail which supports the back of the seat and is tenoned into the side rails. All four corners are braced with shaped and screwed braces. All stretchers are turned and presumably doweled into their respective legs. The back of the chair has slim oak batten screwed across the top, which could be original but equally could be a later addition. The slip seat is constructed in the traditional manner with oak corner blocks and roughly-shaped rails woven with rush; however, it is not a good fit in the rails and the inside front corners of the rails are radiused as if to accept an upholstered seat. The seat may not be original. The brace at the back of the seat rail is marked 61. The whole chair is covered with a dark wash to suggest an ebonised finish. There has been a great deal of re-touching and in many exposed areas e.g., the seat rails, the wash has largely worn off. The chair is now sound but the design clearly has inherent structural problems, particularly where the curved rungs are fitted into the uprights; there are numerous repairs at these points, indicating that the mortises were cut too close to the edge of the post. This is a well-known Mackintosh design, first produced for the Willow Tea Rooms, on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. These opened in 1904, but it is thought most of the furniture was designed between July and November 1903. Roger Billcliffe, Mackintosh Furniture, Cambridge (1984). Purchased H.

Most of that criticism is justified, as the Bruins were on the wrong side of some bad calls all night. But even if the officials did not stink up the place the Bruins were not the better team that night. Tampa took it to them all game long and out worked them in every aspect of the game. The Bruins did not have a shot on goal for most of the first period and were out shot 31-20 on the night. They were also playing on their heels far too much, not making enough plays through the neutral zone and getting quality second chances. Photo Credit: Eric Russo The Bruins just could not handle the pressure the Lightning put on them all game. But it was not just the Lightning, it was the Bruins’ sloppy play that cost them the game. The B’s turned the puck over 13 times and Tampa had eight takeaways. Both are far too many against a team of Tampa’s stature. The Bruins were also noticeable less physical than the Lightning, as they got out hit 42-24. Overall, everyone will take a split in Tampa heading back to Boston for Game 3. But if the Bruins want to get back on track, they need to tighten things up through the neutral zone and clean up the turnovers. Grade: D @JamieGatlin1217 Game Two Grade The Bruins knew Tampa Bay would come into Game 2 highly motivated after being dominated on their home ice in Game 1. The Bruins struggled offensively in the beginning, as they were unable to record a shot on net in the first thirteen minutes of the game. They fell behind early as Tampa scored the game’s first goal eleven minutes in. The Bruins gained some momentum later in the first period, as Charlie McAvoy scored his first goal of the postseason to tie the game at one. Tampa Bay scored the next two goals while the Bruins struggled with their puck management. Rask played well in this game, but turnovers hurt the Bruins and led to good scoring opportunities that Tampa Bay capitalized on. In the third period Torey Krug cut Tampa’s lead to one. The Bruins seemed poised to tie it after Marchand got a breakaway that was broken up after he was clearly slashed on the hands by Anton Stralman. This was one of the many controversial calls by the officials that changed the momentum of the game. Tampa put the game out of reach with an empty net goal that made it 4-2 with less than thirty seconds left. Photo Credit: Douglas R. Clifford/ Tampa Bay Times Overall Grade C: In Game 3 they will need to put the puck in the net. They will have to tighten up on defense as stretch passes and turnovers have hurt them all year. They will need to be more physical and help Rask. If they can do this then Game 3 could end very differently than Game 2. @Lizzie88 Game Two Grade The Bruins knew Tampa was going to come out strong after losing 6-3 on home ice. The Bolts hit back, and Boston just couldn’t catch up. In the first 13 minutes, the Bruins were held without a shot on net. The Black and Gold fell behind, and for once it wasn’t all on Rask. The Bruins were a bit sloppy at times before changing the momentum after Charlie McAvoy tied the game up in the first period. But the night belonged to Tampa. One thing stood out in this game and continues to be a problem throughout the league: the inconsistent officiating in the NHL. Not to use it as an excuse for how disjointed the Bruins looked, but blatant missed calls can change the play of the game. After Krug brought the B’s within one goal in the third, Brad Marchand was poised to tie the game on a breakaway. However a head scratcher non call stopped the B’s momentum as Marchand was clearly slashed on his hands by Anton Stralman. The interesting part is Torey Krug got called on a “slash”–a love tap up against the pad that did not interfere with any play. Other non calls included a clear cross check to David Pastrnak against the boards. And for the refs, an even more frustrating aspect is the continued shifting of players during the face off. As a fan of the game, just drop the puck. Photo Credit: NHL. Com The Bruins need to play better, hit better, and just shoot the puck on net. This series is expected to be chippy and exhausting. The B’s will be bringing the series back to Boston tonight, and with home ice advantage, the Garden will be vibrating. Let’s hope the boys will feed off the crowd and win these next two games. As Marchand puts it: “We have home ice advantage now, we’ll go home. This games’ over, it’s done with and we’ll move on” OVERALL GRADE: C- The Bruins need to stop with those turnovers. It’s been their issue all season long. Top line is allowed one off night. Tighten up the D, help Rask out more and get more physical. This series won’t be easy. Stay out of the penalty box, hoping the refs will call a better game. PreviousXander/Didi is Jeter/Nomar: Part Deux NextWhat If the Red Sox Didn’t Sign David Price?

After a fever-dream of a Game 3, the Pacers look to take command of the series in Game 4-here are some things to watch for tonight. Bogdanovic admitted his key to defending James is staying aggressive, per Mark Monteith of Pacers.com. Asked to translate, Lue said, “Catch the ball in our spots, don’t push us out to the 3-point line”. Starter Darren Collison and backup Cory Joseph played 528 minutes together in the regular season but just 15 in the first three games of this series. Coach Ty Lou stated after the game that the big man will be good to go for Game 3 on Friday, and Love confirmed that notion, noting that it will hurt, but he’ll wrap it up and play. And he did not have a whole lot to say in the immediate aftermath of Game 3, either, when in erased a 17-point deficit and then held on for a 92-90 victory over the Cavs. However, Lue revealed in the days that followed the game that he considered Korver to be a part of the “best” lineup the Cavs have. Forward Bojan Bogdanovic scored 30 points to lift hosts the Indiana Pacers to a come-from-behind 92-90 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who led by 17 at half-time. Golden State will confirm the first second-round pairing Sunday, as it finishes off the San Antonio Spurs to set up a matchup with the New Orleans Pelicans. The Cavs routinely get MRIs, I’m told, and this one confirmed that no structural damage was done. The men from Indianapolis have shown resiliency all season and had to do so again to overcome the 17-point deficit they faced in game three. “As a player you always want to be out there and play with your team”, Hill said.
