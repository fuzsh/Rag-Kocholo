        "text": "Ohio State’s offensive line has been underwhelming through the first five games of the 2023 season. This statement won’t surprise anyone who has watched the Buckeye offense play this season.\n\nWhile this group has given first-year starting quarterback Kyle McCord time to throw more often than not, as the Scarlet and Gray rank as a top-40 pass blocking team, according to Pro Football Focus, Ohio State’s rushing attack is as bad as it has been in recent memory.\n\nStatistically, the Buckeyes average 131.6 rushing yards per game, No. 98 in the country. That includes TreVeyon Henderson, averaging 73.75 yards per contest. Without Henderson, who was unavailable with an injury, on Saturday against Maryland, the Scarlet and Gray averaged 1.9 yards per carry. Even taking out non-running back rushes, Chip Trayanum and Miyan Williams only managed 3.2 yards per attempt.\n\nThese numbers don’t reflect a team that can run through the remaining seven games of the season without a slip-up and contend for a Big Ten title and a national championship, especially considering Ohio State isn’t as elite passing the ball this season.\n\nDONATE TO 'THE FOUNDATION':Click here now to assist with Name, Image and Likeness compensation for Ohio State football and basketball student-athletes.\n\nOhio State 2023 season is here and the Buckeyes are ready to make another run at a Big Ten title and a national championship. Stay on top of the latest Buckeye news by BECOMING A BUCKNUTS SUBSCRIBER with our FREE 7-day trial!\n\nWhile the running backs could do some things to help the ground attack, they don’t appear to be the problem. All three players average more than five rushing yards per carry for their careers, so there is a track record. Yet this Buckeye offensive line isn’t as proven and is the issue when turning on the tape.\n\nOhio State’s offensive line was a concern throughout the offseason. The group the Buckeyes settled on – left tackle Josh Simmons, left guard Donovan Jackson, center Carson Hinzman, right guard Matthew Jones and right tackle Josh Fryar – features two returning starters (Jackson and Jones), a player with one career start heading into the year (Fryar), another with 13 stars but in the Mountain West (Simmons) and a player (Hinzman) who took his first college snap this season.\n\nHead coach Ryan Day has continued to back this group despite the struggles in the run game largely stemming from an offensive line that isn’t getting enough push and finding its blockers.\n\n“I watched the film and I think we have the personnel to do it,” Day said of Saturday’s game. “When you look at some of the plays that we ran, I think there was probably one play that schematically, I felt like we were going uphill. I think, for the most part, the schemes we ran, there was really pretty good looks. Now, there was an extra guy there a lot, especially when we had two tight ends in the game. And that opened up some things in the pass game, which was good. But we've just got to execute better. We've got to coach it better.”\n\nAccording to Sports Info Solutions, the Scarlet and Gray were stopped at the line of scrimmage 47 percent of the time on their 17 first down runs against the Terrapins, averaging just 3.4 yards per carry on those plays, below what Day expects in these situations. This meant Ohio State often started drives or series behind the sticks, leading to the Buckeyes going 3-of-12 on third downs.\n\nNumbers like these would often lead to changes being made, but Day isn’t ready to adjust his starters on the offensive line. He doesn’t believe any of the Scarlet and Gray’s backup offensive linemen have proven they are ready to take over a starting spot.\n\n“I don't see any of those guys right now pushing,” he said. “I'd like to see that. But I don't see them pushing on the door enough to say someone deserves 20, 30 snaps in the game just yet. But there's still a lot of football left to play, and feel free to big push. We would want that in practice.”\n\nDuring fall camp, there was a buzz about a few of Ohio State’s projected second-string offensive linemen. Day said freshman Luke Montgomery was in contention to start at tackle. Junior Zen Michalski and sophomore Tegra Tshabola also received first-team reps and were talked about as adding quality depth on the offensive line.\n\nFollow Patrick Murphy onTwitter andInstagram for more Ohio State coverage\n\nWhat's next for the Buckeyes?

Only Montgomery has played with the first team, coming into the game as a swing lineman in bigger sets. Tshabola and Enokk Vimahi have each played 10 snaps. No other lineman has played more.\n\nBased on Day’s comments, a change on the Buckeyes’ offensive line isn’t coming, at least not unless something changes. But the head coach believes the Scarlet and Gray can execute better and improve the offensive line play in the run game.\n\n“I think you’ve got to figure out, 'Okay, what are the areas that will maybe come up short in?’ Now this is just with everybody,” Day said. “Just like anybody else in any other line of work, I'm sure. If there's areas you’ve gotta improve on, we’ve got to look at everything. We’ve gotta look at what we're doing, how we're doing it, how we're preparing, how we're practicing it, how we're calling it. I mean, every part of it. And that's going on.”"
