Earlier this season, NCCU moved into the Stats Perform FCS Top 25 poll at No. 25 on Sept. 19, which represented the Eagles' first regular season national ranking since Oct. 16, 2017.\n\n• The 2022 Eagles join the ranks of five other teams at NCCU to win nine games or more in a season. The last team to do so was in 2016 with a 9-3 record.\n\n• With a victory in the Celebration Bowl, the 2022 Eagles would become just the third team in NCCU history to reach double-digit wins in a season. Under the direction of head coach Rod Broadway, NCCU won 10 games in 2005 and 11 in 2006. Current NCCU head coach Trei Oliver was an assistant coach on both of those squads.\n\n• NCCU has captured three Black College National Championships (1954, 2005, 2006).\n\n• The 2022 Eagles have already broken single-season NCCU records for scoring (422 points - 371 in 2006), third quarter scoring (99 points - 96 in 1982), first downs (249 - 234 in 2005), and total offense (4,862 yards - 4,614 in 2016).\n\n• This is the fourth gridiron meeting between NCCU and Jackson State.

The Eagles scored 40 points or more in three straight games for the first time in 37 years, and they have scored more than 40 points in six of 10 games this season, including three 50-point performances.\n\n• The 2022 MEAC Offensive Player of the Year, NCCU junior quarterback Davius Richard was named MEAC Offensive Player of the Week seven times this season, and leads the conference in passing yards (2,486), passing touchdowns (24), and rushing touchdowns (13).\n\n• NCCU junior quarterback Davius Richard is fifth in the nation (FCS) in points responsible for, averaging a MEAC-high 20.4 points per game. Richard has passed for 2,486 yards and 24 touchdowns, and has rushed for 691 yards and 13 touchdowns, leading the league with an average of 288.8 yards of total offense per outing, which ranks 10th in the nation (FCS).\n\n• NCCU junior quarterback Davius Richard has broken the NCCU single-season record with 3,177 yards of total offense, surpassing Earl Harvey's standard of 3,008 yards in 1985. Richard needs 13 pass completions to break the NCCU single-season record, held by Michael Johnson (196, 2011), and three passing touchdowns to break the NCCU single-season record, held by Stafford Brown (26, 2006).\n\n• The 2022 MEAC Defensive Player of the Year, NCCU junior safety Khalil Baker is tied for 13th in the nation (FCS) with four interceptions. Baker registered a pick in each of the Eagles' first four games this season. As a team in 2021, NCCU totaled five interceptions.\n\n• For just the second time in Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference history, the MEAC Offensive and Defensive Players of the Year, Offensive Lineman of the Year, and Coach of the Year award winners are all from the same team - North Carolina Central University. The only other time was in 2005 (Hampton).\n\n• During NCCU's 22-20 road victory over Tennessee Tech on Nov. 19, NCCU played its first penalty-free game, dating back to at least 1994.\n\n• NCCU junior kicker Adrian Olivo, a two-time First Team All-MEAC honoree (2022, 2021), ranks fifth in career scoring at NCCU with 193 points, needing four points to pass running back Joe Simmons (196; 1990-93) for the fourth spot.\n\n• Following a 347-yard passing performance at Norfolk State on Nov. 12, junior quarterback Davius Richard passed Malcolm Bell (2013-16) for the number two spot on NCCU's career passing list.

Hicks and sophomore receiver Devin Smith are second and third in the league with seven and six receiving touchdowns, respectively. Smith ranks second in the conference in receptions (35) and fourth in receiving yards (496), while Hicks ranks third in receiving yards (529).\n\n• NCCU senior Robert Mitchell was voted as the 2022 MEAC Offensive Lineman of the Year, topping a dominant Eagles' offensive front with a 90% grade on blocking assignments and amassing 63 pancake blocks without allowing a sack in 659 snaps through 11 games.\n\n• NCCU junior Corey Bullock was tagged as the best offensive guard in the NCAA Division I-FCS, according to a position-by-position breakdown on NCAA.com.\n\n• After NCCU's 50-21 homecoming victory over Howard, the Eagles extended their home win streak to six games, including a 4-0 record inside O'Kelly-Riddick Stadium this season. In those four home victories, NCCU out-scored its opponents 209-55, averaging 52.3 points and 502.8 yards of total offense per contest. Defensively, the Eagles held the opposition to just 13.8 points and 214.5 total yards per game.\n\n• Twenty-two NCCU Eagles have already earned their undergraduate degrees. Seventeen began the season with undergraduate degrees and are currently pursuing a master's degree or second degree, while five Eagles graduated on Dec. 10.\n\n• Among NCCU's 44 student-athletes listed on the season-opening offensive and defensive two-deep chart, 25 (57%) are underclassmen (16 sophomores, 9 freshmen), including 14 underclassmen (9 sophomores, 5 freshman) on offense, while 28 (64%) are from North Carolina.\n\n• NCCU is under the direction of third-season head coach Trei Oliver, who was an all-region safety and punter (1994-97) at NCCU, as well as an Eagles' assistant coach (2003-06).\n\n• Davius Richard's 140 rushing yards at New Hampshire on Sept. 17 are the most by an NCCU quarterback in 23 years.\n\n• Following the 28-13 win over North Carolina A&T in Bank of America Stadium on Sept. 3, NCCU improved its record to 6-2 in games played in an NFL stadium since 2000.\n\n• Since the start of the 2012 season, NCCU has scored 43 touchdowns on defense and special teams, including a 33-yard interception return by Khalil Baker at New Hampshire on Sept. 17.\n\n• NCCU's Davius Richard is just the second quarterback in NCCU history to record 2,000 passing yards in three consecutive seasons, joining NCCU hall of famer Earl Harvey (1985-88). Richard threw for 2,020 yards in 2019, and 2,133 yards in 2021.\n\n• NCCU's Davius Richard ranks second in NCCU history with 6,616 career passing yards, 7,915 yards of total offense, and 51 career passing touchdowns, trailing only NCCU hall of famer Earl \"Air\" Harvey (1985-88).\n\n• Running back Latrell \"Mookie\" Collier led NCCU with nine touchdowns (6 rushing/3 receiving) last season. The West Virginia native also topped the Eagles in 2019 in touchdowns scored with five trips to the end zone (3 rushing/2 receiving).\n\n• Davius Richard's 74-yard touchdown run versus S.C. State (Oct. 30, 2021) is the longest rush by an NCCU quarterback since Lawrence Fuller raced 74 yards against Morris Brown on Sept. 30, 2000.\n\n• As a freshman in 2019, NCCU quarterback Davius Richard achieved the sixth-best passing performance in school history versus Norfolk State (Nov. 9, 2019), amassing 384 passing yards with three touchdowns, completing 30 of 46 throws. Only NCCU hall of fame quarterback Earl \"Air\" Harvey (1985-88) has thrown for more passing yards, as he holds the top five single-game passing efforts in school history.\n\nTHE SERIES\n\nThis is the fourth meeting between NCCU and Jackson State.

With 23 years of college coaching experience that includes five conference championships and three Black college football national titles, Oliver returned to his alma mater as North Carolina Central University's 24th head football coach in December 2018. A native of Yorktown, Virginia, Oliver earned all-conference and all-region honors as a defensive back and punter during his four-year playing career at NCCU from 1994-97.

During that time, NCCU's only losses were in the Georgia Dome (2016, 2010).\n\nRecent Trips to NFL Stadiums:\n\nBank of America Stadium - Carolina Panthers (Sept. 3, 2022 vs. N.C. A&T - W 28-13)\n\nGeorgia Dome - Atlanta Falcons (Dec. 17, 2016 vs. Grambling - L, 9-10)\n\nLucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis Colts (Oct. 6, 2012 vs. S.C.

In addition, nine Eagles have caught touchdown passes. Senior E.J. Hicks (30 catches, 529 yards) leads the way with seven trips to the end zone, followed by sophomore Devin Smith (35 receptions, 496 yards) with six touchdowns.\n\nHOME SWEET HOME\n\nThe Eagles extended their home win streak to six games by posting a 4-0 record inside O'Kelly-Riddick Stadium this season. In those four triumphs, NCCU out-scored its opponents, 209-55, averaging 52.3 points and 502.8 yards of total offense per contest. Defensively, the Eagles held the opposition to just 13.8 points and 214.5 total yards per game. That equates to a differential of +38.5 points and +288.3 total yards per outing.\n\nALUMS AS HEAD FOOTBALL COACHES AT NCCU\n\nTrei Oliver is the third alumnus to lead the NCCU football program, following in the footsteps of Bishop Harris, a 1963 graduate who coached the Eagles from 1991-92, and Herman Riddick, a 1933 graduate who guided the Eagles to a school record 112 victories from 1945-1964.\n\nYOUTH MOVEMENT\n\nAmong NCCU's 44 student-athletes listed on the season-opening offensive and defensive two-deep chart, 25 (57%) are underclassmen (16 sophomores, 9 freshmen), including 14 underclassmen (9 sophomores, 5 freshman) on offense. Of the nine freshmen, seven are true freshmen, who were playing high school football last year. With nine seniors on the depth chart, 35 Eagles (80%) are projected to return next season (10 juniors, 16 sophomores, 9 freshmen).\n\nFOCUS ON RECRUITING NORTH CAROLINA\n\nThe NCCU football program's emphasis on recruiting talent in North Carolina is demonstrated with 28 Eagles calling the Tar Heel state their home, out of the 44 student-athletes listed on the team's season-opening two-deep chart (64%). The next most-represented states are South Carolina and Florida with three each, followed by Virginia and Maryland with two apiece.\n\nEAGLES TURN DEFENSE, SPECIAL TEAMS INTO POINTS\n\nSince the start of the 2012 season, the Eagles have demonstrated a knack for finding the end zone when the offense is off the field. In the past 112 games, NCCU has scored 43 touchdowns on defense and special teams, including a 33-yard interception return by Khalil Baker at New Hampshire, two in 2021, two in 2019, two in 2018, three in 2017, three in 2016, six in 2015, five in 2014, nine in 2013 and 10 in 2012.

The Eagles won back-to-back football conference championships and a Black College National Championship in their final two years in the Division II ranks (2005 and 2006) before starting the transition to Division I in 2007.\n\n• During its storied gridiron tradition, NCCU has produced 156 all-conference selections (first team), 70 all-Americans, 41 NFL draft picks, 12 conference championships and three Black College National Championships (1954, 2005, 2006).\n\n• Three Eagles have represented NCCU on the National Football League's grandest stage - the Super Bowl. The first NCCU Eagle to make a Super Bowl appearance was Richard Sligh, who was a reserve tackle with the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl II against the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 14, 1968. Sligh, who holds the distinction as the tallest player in NFL history (7'0\"), played at NCCU from 1962-64 and was later drafted by the Raiders in the 10th round of the 1967 NFL draft. On Jan. 24, 1982, former NCCU Eagle Louis Breeden was a starting cornerback for the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI against the San Francisco 49ers. Earlier in the season (Nov. 8, 1981), Breeden intercepted a pass thrown by San Diego Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts and returned it a team-record 102 yards for a touchdown. The following year, he was selected as a First-Team All-Pro. He completed his 10-year NFL career with 33 interceptions for 558 return yards and two touchdowns. The third Eagle to play in the Super Bowl was Ryan Smith with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Feb. 7, 2021, as Smith became the first NCCU Eagle to play in a Super Bowl victory.\n\n• The first Eagle selected in the NFL Draft was Matt Boone, who was taken by the Giants with the eighth pick in the 18th round in 1956. The latest Eagle announced during the NFL Draft was Ryan Smith, who was chosen by the Buccaneers in the fourth round in 2016. NCCU's highest draft pick was Doug Wilkerson, who was selected in the first round with the 14th overall pick of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Oilers. The Eagles have also had three second-round NFL draft picks, including Robert Massey in 1989 by the Saints, Charles Smith in 1975 by the Broncos and Chuck Hinton in 1962 by the Browns.\n\n• HBCU football pioneer John Brown, who represented NCCU (then North Carolina College) on the gridiron in the 1940s, was one of the first to play professional football out of a historically Black college or university. Brown shares the honor with Ezzret Anderson of Kentucky State and Elmore Harris of Morgan State, who all began their professional football careers in 1947. Brown and Anderson were teammates on the Los Angeles Dons, while Harris was a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. According to NCCU records, Brown was the first of the three to sign a professional football contract. He played center and linebacker with the Dons from 1947-49, before moving to the Canadian Football League.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#20 Khalil Baker\n\nDB\n\n6' 0\"\n\nJunior\n\n#81 Tyler Barnes\n\nTE\n\n6' 4\"\n\nSenior\n\n#45 Jaki Brevard\n\nLB\n\n6' 0\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#51 Corey Bullock\n\nOL\n\n6' 4\"\n\nJunior\n\n#2 Brandon Codrington\n\nDB\n\n5' 9\"\n\nJunior\n\n#5 Latrell Collier\n\nRB\n\n5' 10\"\n\nRedshirt Junior\n\n#4 E.J.
