An ugly loss, which even today remains the most lopsided ever, and then a mad scramble.\n\n“It’s the worst sporting disaster that has ever happened to the west,” the Edmonton Journal wrote indignantly, “and will take a long time to live down.”\n\nIt started, a few months earlier, with a sparse first workout and a plea in the paper for players to attend practice.\n\nThe Regina Rugby Club — nicknamed “Roughriders” or “Rough Riders” by papers outside the city, but not yet in Regina — were far removed from today’s high-definition television appearances and 33,000-seat gridiron palaces. They were amateurs, bolstered by one coach, a general manager, and a trainer.\n\nThe Grey Cup, meanwhile, was firmly planted in eastern Canada. The Edmonton Eskimos were the first western team to take a crack at it: They lost 23-0 to the Toronto Argonauts in 1921. In 1922, the Edmonton Elks lost 13-1 to Queen’s.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe west pined for its first victory, but 1923 did not start smoothly for the aspirational Regina Rugby Club.\n\n“The squad has a hard old grind ahead,” reported the Leader on Sept. 10, “for the boys have been regarding the future too lightly and have failed to turn out at full strength for practice. Several of the best ruggerists in town, especially Leigh, Milne, Rowand, Bird and Blacklock, have been so wedded to baseball that they have almost forgotten that there is such a game as rugby. These men will have to step fast if they are going to get a place on the team this fall.”\n\nThey trickled in. Soon a full squad was on the field, getting noticed.\n\nCaptain Tare Rennebohm, a lineman, “is going great guns and ready to face the barrier right now”; end Stew Leigh “pulls them down anything but tenderly”; Howie Milne “is hitting the line like a battering ram”; Scotty McEachern is “elusive as an eel”; Jack Arnot and Curtis Bates “will be buckling on the armour again in a few days and the addition of these two stars will round out a team which should prove worthy representatives of the capital.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHow much have things changed in a century? In 1923, a problem cropped up: The Roughriders were set to play six games against the Saskatoon Quakers, but it looked like Saskatoon might not get a team together.\n\nRegina had dominated its northern rivals dating back more than a decade, with the exception of a 1921 provincial-final upset, and Saskatoon football was hurting.\n\nOn Sept. 29, the two cities finally met in the first of four contests — Saskatoon after just four days of practice — and the Roughriders eked out a 6-0 victory, causing a bit of anxiety in the Queen City.\n\n“Saskatoon’s senior rugby squad,” wrote the Saskatoon Star, “is not near so rotten as some crepe hangers would lead one to believe.”\n\nThe following week, at Regina’s Park Hughes, the hosts beat Saskatoon 15-5.\n\nThen, controversy. Saskatoon led 3-1 in the dying seconds of their third game, when McEachern returned a punt to the Quakers’ 20 yard line. A Saskatoon player was injured on the play; the referee blew his whistle, but it went unnoticed on the field. McEachern drop-kicked the ball through the uprights, and Regina thought it had won 4-3.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the bedlam, and with fans on the field, Regina players departed, many heading into downtown Saskatoon. Back at the park, it was determined that not only was the score still 3-1, but there was also time on the clock.\n\nRegina didn’t have enough players on hand to finish, so it forfeited, and took its first loss of the season.\n\nSaskatoon needed to win bout No. 4 to send the series to a one-game playoff, and a chance of dashing Regina’s Grey Cup hopes. It was a nasty affair, with a fourth-quarter brawl. Fans ran onto the field to join the fray.\n\nRegina’s 15-10 victory sent it to the western semifinal against the Edmonton Eskimos. Regina won 9-6, setting up a western final against the Winnipeg Victorias. A Grey Cup berth was on the line. Regina won 11-1, and was off to the dominion championship.\n\nNobody knew what to expect from the western squad. Guess-work, all around.\n\nQueen’s clinched the eastern title with a 13-5 victory over the Hamilton Tigers, and on the night of Nov. 26, Regina’s squad — backed by local fund-raising and a promised cut of the game receipts — put 19 players onto a Toronto-bound train, along with coach Jack Eadie, general manager Al Ritchie and trainer Jimmy Thompson.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOn Thursday, Regina’s players, wearing red and black uniforms, trotted onto the Toronto field for a practice session before hundreds of curious onlookers. According to the Leader, they were eager “to see these men from the great West show their stuff.”\n\nSome reports touched on the team’s presumed speed and size, but renowned Toronto Star sportswriter Lou Marsh was unimpressed. They didn’t look good, he opined; so bad, in fact, that one might think it was a ruse.\n\n“Some of the red and black players,” he wrote, “did some things so badly that it looked as if they were out there to kid the natives.”\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE GREY CUP COVERAGE\n\nFor more stories, a festival schedule and everything you want to know about the CFL championship in Regina, go to the Leader-Post’s Grey Cup section.\n\nHe did profess an admiration for the “baby elephant” size of Creighton, Bill Kerr, Tare Rennebohm and Jerry Crapper.\n\nThe field was buried in ankle-deep mud following a 24-hour rain, which was thought to favour Regina, even if nothing else did.\n\nThe Leader’s optimistic game-day headline, in big letters:\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQUEENS WILL MEET STRONGEST TEAM\n\nTHAT EVER CAME OUT OF THE WEST\n\nIN DOMINION FINAL TODAY, IS VIEW\n\nOn Monday:\n\nQUEENS SMOTHER WESTERN CHAMPIONS\n\nRegina trailed 20-0 at halftime, and 43-0 after three quarters before a crowd of 8,528. Their only scoring opportunity came in the second quarter, when McEachern drop-kicked a 15-yard field-goal attempt into the line of scrimmage.\n\nHowie Milne, inducted into the Roughriders’ Plaza of Honour in 1992, was one of the team’s few bright spots. He had two long carries, and “crawled out from under mountains of flesh time after time, when Regina succeeded in stopping Queen’s advance.”\n\nThere wasn’t much else to say. That team still holds the Grey Cup record for most points allowed, Creighton got the game ball, and the Roughriders made seven more appearances — all of them without winning — until they beat Ottawa 29-14 in 1966.\n\nPlayers never forgot that day.\n\n“For those — like Tare Rennebohm — who played in this debacle, it was a humiliation forever seared in their memories, a score to be referred to defensively as the ‘five-four-oh!’ game,” wrote Bob Calder and Garry Andrews in their 1984 history book ‘Rider Pride.’\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA British Pathe crew filmed the contest for a silent short they called “No Game For Weaklings!” and it can be viewed on YouTube nearly 100 years later. The camera pans Regina players on the sidelines, shows footage of a chained bear, and then moves to bits of the game — black-and-white players run and dodge on the sodden field; there’s a fumble, a roaring crowd, a long Queen’s run.\n\nIt’s Regina’s first Grey Cup, a bleak little affair, sprung from the dead through moving pictures.
