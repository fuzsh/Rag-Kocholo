        "text": "The Saskatchewan Roughriders are a Canadian Football League team based in Regina, Saskatchewan, founded in 1910. They play their home games at 2940-10th Avenue in Regina, which has been the team's home base for its entire history, even prior to the construction of Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field. Originally known as the Regina Rugby Club from 1910 to 1923, they changed their name to the Regina Roughriders in 1924 and finally to the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1948. The team draws fans from across Saskatchewan and Canada who are affectionately known as the \"Rider Nation\". They have won three Grey Cups over their 100 year history, despite playing in the championship game 18 times. The fans are known for their loyalty and \"Rider Pride\", and it is not unusual to find a group of Rider fans following the team on their road games across the country. The Roughriders play in the CFL's West Division. The team has had 17 players inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. Their rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers is arguably the most passionate and intense in the league, as games between the two are often sold out before the beginning of the season.[1]\n\nTeam facts[]\n\nFormerly known as: Regina Rugby Club 1910 to 1923, Regina Roughriders 1924 to 1947\n\nHelmet design: Green helmet with a black and white \"S\" and stalks of wheat on each side with a black background.\n\nRetro helmet design: Green helmet with logo of a green wreath surrounding a green S on a white background\n\nUniform colours: Green and white, with black and silver accents\n\nNickname: Riders, the green and white, jolly green giants\n\nWestern 1st place regular season finishes: 7—1951, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1976, 2009\n\nGrey Cup final appearances: 18;—1923 (lost), 1928 (lost), 1929 (lost), 1930 (lost), 1931 (lost), 1932 (lost), 1934 (lost), 1951 (lost), 1966 (won), 1967 (lost), 1969 (lost), 1972 (lost), 1976 (lost), 1989 (won), 1997 (lost), 2007 (won), 2009 (lost). 2010 (lost)\n\nGrey Cup wins: 3—1966, 1989, 2007\n\nHosted the Grey Cup two times: 1995 (83rd Grey Cup), 2003 (91st Grey Cup)\n\nMain rivals: Winnipeg Blue Bombers (see Labour Day Classic and Banjo Bowl), Edmonton Eskimos, Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes.\n\n2010 regular season record: 10 wins, 8 losses. 20 points\n\nFranchise history[]\n\nThe team was founded as the Regina Rugby Club on Tuesday, September 13, 1910, adopting the colours of old gold and purple. Regina played their first game against the Moose Jaw Tigers on October 1, 1910 at the Moose Jaw Baseball Grounds where they were defeated 16-6. For the 1911 season, the team changed their colours to blue and white and changed them again in 1912 to red and black. They changed their name to the Regina Roughriders in 1924, then unofficially to the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1946. Officially, they changed their team name to the Saskatchewan Roughriders on April 1, 1950 while changing their team colours from red and black to green and white in 1948.[2]\n\nThe formation of what became the CFL brought them into an 8-team league which also included the Ottawa Rough Riders. Both teams were allowed to keep their established names, identically pronounced although different in spelling, and this situation continued until the Ottawa Rough Riders folded in 1996. The Rough Riders were named for the log rollers of the region's rivers, while the Roughriders were named for an elite North-West Mounted Police corps of expert horsemen.\n\nTragedy[]\n\nThe Roughriders' darkest day came on December 9, 1956 when four members of the team were killed in a plane crash while returning from the CFL All-Star game in Vancouver. Gordon Sturtridge, Mel Becket, Ray Syrnyk, and Mario DeMarco were killed when Flight 810 crashed into Slesse Mountain near Chilliwack, British Columbia. The team retired the numbers of the four players shortly after the tragedy.[3]\n\nGrey Cup championships[]\n\nThe franchise has won three Grey Cup championships; a 29–14 victory over the now-defunct Ottawa Rough Riders in 1966, a 43–40 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1989 and also a 23–19 victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2007. Four times, the Roughriders and (Ottawa) Rough Riders met in Grey Cup finals, prompting joking predictions from sportswriters that 'the Riders' would win it all. Led by Hall of Fame quarterback Ron Lancaster, a string of 11 straight appearances in the Western finals 1966–76 remains a CFL record. The Roughriders also posted the best regular season record in all of pro football over that time period.[4]\n\n2007 season[]\n\nIn the 2007 season, the Riders jumped out to a 7–2 start, their best since 1976. Notable was a last-minute victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the annual Labour Day Classic. The Riders wore retro uniforms for the occasion, with stylistic similarities to jerseys worn in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe 2007 season brought along with it the Roughriders' first home playoff game since 1988, which was played at Mosaic Stadium on November 11 against the Calgary Stampeders. The Riders once again wore their retro uniforms and took a close victory 26–24. This was also their first home playoff win since 1976.\n\nThe team followed up on November 18 with a 26–17 win at BC Place over the BC Lions in the West Division final to give the Roughriders a berth in their first Grey Cup final since 1997.\n\nOn November 25, 2007, the Riders played the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 95th Grey Cup. This marked the first time that two Labour Day Classic opponents played each other in a Grey Cup game. Saskatchewan won 23–19 in a game where James Johnson recorded three interceptions, a Grey Cup record. He was named MVP of the 2007 Grey Cup, with Roughrider Andy Fantuz being named the Canadian MVP in the game. He had 70 yards receiving and the game-winning touchdown.\n\n2008 season[]\n\nA month and a half after capturing the 2007 Grey Cup, Kent Austin stepped down as head coach to become the offensive co-ordinator at Ole Miss. In accepting this position in the NCAA, Austin turned down a very lucrative contract that the Riders had offered. On February 6, 2008, Roughriders GM Eric Tillman announced that the new head coach would be Ken Miller. Miller was formerly an offensive coordinator under Austin.\n\nOn April 5, 2008, a report was released saying that the Roughriders set a new record for earnings in a single season. In 2007 the Roughriders generated $22,950,489 in revenue, with a profit of $1,737,377[citation needed]. These earnings were due in part to the championship season the Roughriders sported, which included 8 home game sellouts and their first home playoff game in 19 years.\n\nThe 2008 season began with a 6–0 record with wins shared between three quarterbacks. This is the team's best record since 1934 when they were still known as the Regina Roughriders. This was despite suffering 6 broken legs and a total of 18 injuries[citation needed].\n\nOn August 24, 2008, the team's General Manager, Eric Tillman, announced the acquisition of Quarterback Michael Bishop; the Toronto Argonauts backup quarterback at the time of the trade, he went 11–1 as a starter for the Argonauts in 2007. As predicted[citation needed], this was the end of Marcus Crandell's run with the Roughriders, who released him four days later.\n\nAfter the 6-0 start, the Riders would go on to finish the 2008 CFL Regular season with the same record they finished with in 2007, at 12-6. The Roughriders finished in second place in the CFL West Division and earned the right to host the CFL West Division Semi-Final for the second consecutive year.\n\nA devastating 33–12 loss to the BC Lions in the western semi-final game on November 8, 2008, caused the Roughriders to announce that Michael Bishop had played his last game for the franchise.[citation needed].\n\nMascots[]\n\nThe current official Rider mascot is Gainer the Gopher, who made his first appearance in 1977.[5] \"Gainer\" is an anagram of Regina and the gopher, or more properly, Richardson's Ground Squirrel (not a Gopher) is a common animal on the Canadian Prairies.\n\nPopularity[]\n\nFan support[]\n\nRider fans have been referred to as the best fans in the league and were ranked the rowdiest fans of any sports team in Canada by MSN Sports, ranking ahead of the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team and the Montreal Canadiens.[6] The team is third behind the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs for merchandise sales of Canadian sports teams,[7] and in 2009 the team played in 5 of the 6 most viewed games on television[citation needed] as well as breaking a ratings record for the West Final against the Calgary Stampeders and a Grey Cup ratings record of 43% of the national population against the Montreal Alouettes.[citation needed] The Riders typically bring an upsurge in attendance at all or most of their various away venues, drawing crowds of their own fans, as well as home-town fans whose interest is heightened when the Roughriders come to town.[8] The province of Saskatchewan went through tough economic times during the 1980s and 1990s and as a result thousands of Rider fans left the province for work, particularly to Alberta. In Edmonton and especially Calgary, Rider fans make up to half the crowd, and many violent clashes between fans have resulted in recent years between Roughrider and Stampeder fans.[9][10] The Riders have led road attendance in the CFL every year this decade,.[11] and local support has skyrocketed in recent years due to the on-field success of the club, including the first sold-out season in 2008.[12] The Roughriders attendance record came in 1995 in a win over the Calgary Stampeders as 55,438 (more than 25% of Regina's population) fans watched on.[13] This crowd was attainable that year because of the increased capacity of Taylor Field in preparation of hosting the Grey Cup. Rider fans are also known for dressing up in unique and often bizarre Rider-themed costumes, the most popular being the watermelon helmet[citation needed].\n\nUniversity Section[]\n\nThe University Section is a notorious group of season ticket holders who occupy Section 28 in the East Side bleachers at Taylor Field. They are known for their strict allegiance to the Riders[citation needed], standing through the entire game, and often being merciless to opposing fans who sit in the section and cheer for the road team. They enjoy taunting the opposing team's bench with a series of chanting and slandering. The University Section got its nickname from the section's main purpose in the 1980s and 1990s and was a discount section offered to university students in Saskatchewan. The section no longer serves as a university section but still retains the name because of the rowdy behaviour of the fans.[14]\n\nFight and theme songs[]\n\nThe Roughriders are unique among sports teams for the amount of songs written about them[citation needed]. The official Rider songs are played regularly at the stadium, and include \"Green is the Colour\", \"Rider Pride\", and \"Paint the Whole World Green.\"[15] In addition, during every fourth quarter intermission, the P.A. system plays the cult hit \"The Last Saskatchewan Pirate\" by Captain Tractor, and the Riders Cheer Team leads the crowd in a fourth quarter stretch. There are many other songs that have been created over the years to tribute the team as well. Many of these songs have proved so popular in Western Canada that they have become popular culture phenomena[citation needed].[16] The music selection at Mosaic Stadium is mostly consisted of mainstream popular music.\n\nRadio and television[]\n\nCKRM Radio launched in 1926, and serves as the primary home of the Saskatchewan Roughriders during the football season, and the Regina Pats during the hockey season. Rod Pedersen is the play-by-play announcer, and game broadcasts are available throughout much of Saskatchewan via CKRM and worldwide on the internet through the station's website. Sirius Satellite Radio also enjoys an exclusive deal with the CFL, including the Saskatchewan Roughriders, and all games are available on Sirius.[17] On television in Canada, all Roughrider games are broadcast nationally in English on TSN and select games are available in French on RDS. Outside of Canada, some of the team's games can be viewed in the United States on NFL Network and on the Internet via ESPN3.\n\nPublic company[]\n\nThe Roughriders are one of only a few publicly owned professional sports companies in North America, complete with a board of directors. The Roughriders' public ownership model is similar to the Green Bay Packers where a limited number of shares have been sold to the public. It is not possible to resell these shares, no dividend payment is possible and no person may hold more than 20 voting shares. A recent public offering of Rider Shares — Series 1 — commenced in 2004 at an offering price of $250 per share[18] In 2006 the Ottawa Sun reported that the Roughriders had sold around 3,000 at $250 each.[19] The Series 1 offering closed in 2008 after all 6,000 shares were sold. A second public offering, Series 2, was launched in 2010 in honour of the team's 100th anniversary.[20]\n\nCurrent roster[]\n\nSaskatchewan Roughriders roster\n\nQuarterbacks\n\n17 Cole Bergquist\n\n8 Ryan Dinwiddie\n\n4 Darian Durant\n\n12 Chris Leak\n\nRunning Backs\n\n24 Graeme Bell FB\n\n20 Wes Cates\n\n21 Hugh Charles\n\n22 Stu Foord\n\n32 Neal Hughes FB\n\n33 Chris Szarka FB\n\n28 Brandon West\n\nWide Receivers\n\n6 Rob Bagg\n\n18 Obed Cetoute\n\n87 Aaron Fairooz\n\n80 Efrem Hill\n\n84 Cary Koch\n\n88 Terrence Nunn\n\n12 Jordan Sisco\n\n86 Ernie Wheelwright\n\nSlotbacks\n\n82 Jason Clermont\n\n7 Weston Dressler\n\n89 Chris Getzlaf\n\nOffensive Linemen\n\n61 Bart Archdekin OL\n\n66 Chris Best G\n\n65 Michel Boudreault OL\n\n67 Dan Clark OL\n\n58 Marion Dukes OL\n\n68 Alexandre Gauthier OL\n\n64 Justin Glover OL\n\n64 Dan Goodspeed T\n\n52 George Hudson C\n\n69 Nick Hutchins OL\n\n60 Gene Makowsky G\n\n57 Marc Parenteau G\n\nDefensive Linemen\n\n92 Calvin Fance DL\n\n91 Tearrius George DE\n\n90 Brent Hawkins DE\n\n94 Ikenna Ike DE\n\n96 Ryan Lucas DT\n\n95 Luc Mullinder DE\n\n91 Montez Murphy DE\n\n94 Dario Romero DT\n\n74 Keith Shologan DT\n\n99 Shomari Williams DE\n\n98 Rodrique Wright DT\n\nLinebackers\n\n30 Byron Bullock LB\n\n50 Jerrell Freeman OLB\n\n31 Sean Lucas OLB\n\n45 Mike McCullough MLB\n\n2 Barrin Simpson MLB\n\n46 Kye Stewart OLB\n\nDefensive Backs\n\n29 John Eubanks DB\n\n15 Lance Frazier HB\n\n37 Tamon George DB\n\n27 Nick Graham DB\n\n41 Ludovic Kashindi DB\n\n24 Tad Kornegay DB\n\n39 Chris McKenzie DB\n\n25 Leron Mitchell DB\n\n14 James Patrick S\n\n9 Courtney Robinson DB\n\n38 Tristan Jackson DB\n\nSpecial Teams\n\n10 Luca Congi K\n\n59 Jocelyn Frenette LS\n\n47 Cory Huclack LS/LB\n\n11 Eddie Johnson P/K\n\n16 Warren Kean K\n\nInjured List\n\nPractice Roster\n\nUnsigned Draft Choices\n\n-- Craig Butler DB\n\n-- Kyle Exume RB\n\n-- Alexander Krausnick-Groh OL\n\n-- Christopher Milo K\n\n-- Matt O'Donnell OL\n\nItalics indicate Import player\n\nupdated 2011-05-08\n\n•\n\n66 Active\n\n→ More rosters\n\nCurrent coaches and directors[]\n\nSaskatchewan Roughriders Staff\n\nFront Office\n\nPresident and CEO – Jim Hopson\n\nVice President of Football Operations – Ken Miller\n\nGeneral Manager – Brendan Taman\n\nDirector of Football Administration – Brendan Taman\n\nDirector of Player Personnel – Craig Smith\n\nDirector of U.S. Scouting – Vacant\n\nHead Coaches\n\nHead Coach – Greg Marshall\n\nOffensive Coaches\n\nAssistant Head Coach/Offensive Coordinator – Doug Berry\n\nReceivers/Passing Game Coordinator – Bob Dyce\n\nRunning Backs – Bill MacDermott\n\nOffensive Line – Steve Buratto\n\nDefensive Coaches\n\nDefensive Coordinator – Richie Hall\n\nDefensive Line – Mike Walker\n\nLinebackers – Alex Smith\n\nDefensive Assistant – Gary Etcheverry\n\nSpecial Teams Coaches\n\nSpecial Teams Coordinator – Craig Dickenson\n\nStrength and Conditioning\n\nStrength and Conditioning – Vacant\n\n→\n\n→ More CFL staffs\n\nPlayers of note[]\n\nRecent regular season and playoff results[]\n\nSeason-by-season records[]\n\nMain article: Saskatchewan Roughriders seasons\n\nThe 1990s[]\n\nLegend:\n\nF = For, A = Against\n\n* For the 1995 Season, all 8 Canadian teams were featured in the Northern Division.\n\nThe Danny Barrett era[]\n\nSeason Won Lost Tied Points* F A Home Away Division Standing Playoff Results 2000 5 12 1 11 516 626 2–6–1 3–6 3–6–1 4th Missed Playoffs 2001 6 12 0 12 308 416 2–7 4–5 3–7 4th Missed Playoffs 2002 8 10 0 18* 435 393 7–2 1–8 4–6 4th Crossover: Lost East Semi-Final 24–14 to Toronto 2003 11 7 0 22 535 430 7–2 4–5 7–3 3rd Won West Semi-Final 37–21 over Winnipeg\n\nLost West Final 30–23 to Edmonton\n\n2004 9 9 0 18 476 444 6–3 3–6 4–6 3rd Won West Semi-Final 14–6 over Edmonton\n\nLost West Final 27–25 to B.C. in OT\n\n2005 9 9 0 18 441 433 5–4 4–5 6–4 4th Crossover: Lost East Semi-Final 30–14 to Montreal 2006 9 9 0 18 465 434 6–3 3–6 4–6 3rd Won West Semi-Final 30–21 over Calgary\n\nLost West Final 45–18 to B.C.\n\nTotals 57 68 1 117* 3176 3176 35–27–1 22–41 31–38–1 - -\n\n* From 2000 to 2002, the CFL awarded a single point to teams losing in overtime.
