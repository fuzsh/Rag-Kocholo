        "text": "That trait was mentioned to the Roughriders by Beau Baldwin, who coached Adams Jr., at Eastern Washington University.\n\n“(Baldwin) said (Adams Jr.) was probably the best leader he ever had,” McAdoo said following Thursday’s practice at Mosaic Stadium. “That’s big when you’re the quarterback because you’re the general of the offence.\n\n“Getting guys to rally behind you and being that leader and making them believe in you, that’s big.”\n\nAdams Jr., appeared in 11 games with the Roughriders in 2017, mostly as the short-yardage quarterback. He rushed for three touchdowns that season.\n\nHe was traded to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats prior to the 2018 season for defensive end Charleston Hughes. Adams Jr., never played a game for the Tiger-Cats and was released in June 2018.\n\nHe then joined the Alouettes and came into 2019 as the backup to starter Antonio Pipkin. When Pipkin injured a leg in the Als’ first game of the season June 14 against the Edmonton Eskimos, Adams took over as the Als’ starter. He has them sitting at 6-4 and in second place in the East Division.\n\nAdams Jr., has thrown for 2,121 yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions in nine games. He also has rushed for 10 TDs.\n\nMcAdoo said the biggest thing that has helped Adams Jr., emerge as a CFL quarterback is getting more experience in the Canadian game.\n\n“It’s a different game than down south. The coverages that you see are a little bit different,” McAdoo said. “It takes a maturation part of it, just guys understanding and getting out there and taking the reps to believe what they are seeing.”\n\nThe Roughriders’ defence is also aware of the game-breaking ability Adams Jr., has shown this season.\n\n“The team goes where Vernon Adams goes,” linebacker Solomon Elimimian said. “He’s a player that at any given moment can hurt you with his feet or his arms. He can have a bad quarter and then just pick things up.”\n\nThe Alouettes haven’t lost a game since a 17-10 loss to the Roughriders on Aug. 9 in a game that was called early due to lightning. In that meeting, Adams Jr., was on the sidelines as he continued to recover from a concussion.\n\nThe game Saturday will mark the first time Adams Jr., starts a game against the Roughriders in his career.\n\nSaskatchewan’s defence wants to get back on track after Saturday’s 35-10 loss to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The last time a team scored more than 20 points against the Green and White was in its 38-25 win over the B.C. Lions on July 20.\n\nThe Roughriders’ defence will also need to handle Montreal running back William Stanback, who missed the teams’ previous meeting with a heel injury. Stanback has been enjoying a breakout season with the Alouettes thus far, running for 689 yards and four touchdowns in eight games.\n\n“I think for us it’s all about team defence,” Elimimian said. “It’s not one man that has to stop one player.”"
