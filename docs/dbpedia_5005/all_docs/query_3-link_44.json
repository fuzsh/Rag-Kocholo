        "text": "SUITOR The way John Gregory handled it also helped. I remember sitting in his office and he said, “You’re going to play. I know what the fans are saying, but you’re our starting safety and I have confidence in you.”\n\nGREGORY When I brought him into my office he thought I was cutting him. Honestly, I think that’s what he thought.\n\nELGAARD The next day when Gregory brought us together he said, “We’re f—ing starting over. We’re better than this.” That’s when this psychologist guy showed up.\n\nSUITOR Gregory had a sports psychologist work with us throughout the year. I had talked to him after that B.C. game. His question for the team was, “Have you thought about where you would wear your Grey Cup ring?” I thought, “Wow, if we’re serious, if we really think we can do this, why shouldn’t I think about where I’d put my Grey Cup ring?” So we all put a piece of tape on the finger we’d put the ring on — it was a team thing and we didn’t tell anybody about it. If you look back at replays, you’ll see that on the finger I wanted to wear the Grey Cup ring, I had a piece of white tape. I wore it in practice and I wore it in games.\n\nELGAARD There’s more of a story to that than just tape on the fingers. The scene is: The team’s f—in’ falling apart. We were at the bottom of a dip in the season, lots of struggle and desperation — the typical Roughriders story. So the idea was that we needed to get the baggage of the Roughrider history off our backs and start the ’89 season over. [Gregory] made a new roster, new schedule. Like, “We’re starting the ’89 season today.” They did all kinds of weird crap. They made a tinfoil Grey Cup and put it on a little stand in the corner of the dressing room. All sorts of weird shit.\n\nSUITOR I’m not sure if it affected every player like it did me, but it crystallized the vision and let you know what you played for. Some guys rolled their eyes, but it was cool for me.\n\nELGAARD I’m a big believer in “plays make games, players make plays.” It’s gotta be done on the field; I don’t care how much you talk about it. You need to be properly prepared and physically prepared. And you need to play like an a–hole. Those are the things that actually win the games. But I didn’t discount the effect of psychology on the physical player. I didn’t drink the Kool-Aid, but I didn’t spill the jug on the floor either.\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Riders bested a 10-8 Calgary Stampeders team, 33–26, despite lingering injuries to the receiving core. Moving on to face the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western Final, they were all-but-completely written off. The beat the Esks convincingly, 32–21, thanks to a complete effort on both sides of the ball.\n\nVANSTONE The night before the Western Final against Edmonton a buddy asked me, “What would you do if the Riders beat the Eskimos? Would you make the trip to Toronto for the Grey Cup?” I just laughed at him. It just seemed like the most absurd question. If someone asked me to join Chippendales it wouldn’t have been as absurd.\n\nSUITOR Absolutely nobody thought we had a chance against the Eskimos. Even their team was very vocal about the fact that this was going to be a walk in the park. They were talking about booking flights to Toronto early.\n\nRIDGWAY We heard and saw all of it. We had the clippings in our lockers.\n\nGREGORY [Against Edmonton] we started Kent Austin at QB and in the first series of the game he got an ankle injury. But Tommy Burgess came in and just had a whale of a game.\n\nELGAARD Burgess went in, threw a couple of touchdown passes, finished the game, and then the controversy began.\n\nGREGORY One of the [radio] stations out of Saskatoon had a poll as to who I should start, but I didn’t want nobody to tell me the results of the poll, didn’t want that to have any effect on my decision. But Tommy won the poll. Everybody loved Tommy Burgess.\n\nTOM BURGESS, Roughriders quarterback That was the third year both Kent and I were on the team. In ’87, I had gotten hurt and that’s when Kent first came in. Then ’88 and ’89 were two platooning years — whoever had the hot hand played.\n\nSUITOR We knew we had great quarterbacking — we had confidence in both our guys.\n\nGREGORY Look, the key issue for which QB would play was which kind of coverage we were facing. Tommy Burgess was especially good against man-to-man coverage, which was what Edmonton was using and that’s why he was so effective in that game. But Hamilton was mainly a pattern-read coverage, mainly a zone coverage, and Kent was just really good at picking apart zone coverages.\n\nELGAARD That’s a bunch of crap. They were both good quarterbacks; they both knew how to run the offence. We could win with either of them and we’d won lots of games with Tommy at QB. But in the end it was Kent, and he played unbelievably well like he did so many times.\n\n[snippet id=4071101]\n\nBURGESS Obviously I wanted to start, and that game was bittersweet for me because as an athlete you want to play on the biggest stage, and I didn’t. In hindsight I realized, even shortly after the game, Kent had played extraordinarily well during the second half of the season. And I had just demonstrated that I could be impactful if you needed me off the bench. So it was probably the safer and wiser call for coach Gregory. And he was right. Kent was unbelievable.\n\nELGAARD When push came to shove and the chips were down, f–k, they couldn’t stop [Austin].\n\nWith Saskatchewan Grey Cup–bound, it became a scramble to mobilize Rider Nation. An estimated 20,000 fans made the trek to Toronto.\n\nGREGORY It was planes, trains and automobiles. Or planes, trains and buses. The whole city was coming to Toronto. Everybody was trying to find a way. There’d be advertisements in the paper that there were two free seats in the car, or whatever.\n\nVANSTONE It became an issue not only for the fans, but for the franchise: How do you get the wives and tertiary people in the organization to Toronto? The Riders had an unofficial assistant equipment manager everyone called “Shorty.” The whole team got to Toronto and then realized, “Hey, Shorty’s not here.” So Ridgway stood up and said, “Listen, Shorty should be here,” so the players all chipped in to get him to Toronto.\n\nRIDGWAY Normally, we would go in between 36 and 48 hours ahead of time. For championship and playoff games you go in earlier. We got in Tuesday night and as the week progressed, you started to see more and more Saskatchewan people in Toronto. One day, we came out of the Eaton Centre and there were several hundred Saskatchewan fans who had decided to hold an impromptu parade on the sidewalks down Yonge Street.\n\nELGAARD It seemed like a long week. Normally you’re at home and fly out on Friday and play on Saturday or whatever it is. You’re out there for a week living in a hotel. There was a lot of downtime and ass-dragging going on. Meanwhile, some of the Tiger-Cats were a bit more relaxed.\n\nELGAARD I don’t remember being overly nervous or awestruck, struggling with the noise or anything like that. You’re aware of what’s going on around you, but I don’t remember anything affecting me. It was just a big game.\n\nSUITOR Looking back we probably all realized that we weren’t the best team in the league skill-wise, but that didn’t mean we couldn’t win. We were doing it for each other and we were doing it for a province that hadn’t seen it for a long time. We knew we were facing a great team, but we were on this roll, this mission. It wasn’t cocky, there wasn’t a swagger. It was more of a roll-your-sleeves-up-do-your-job-and-we’ll-see-what-happens confidence. Then we kicked the thing off.\n\nThe game opened with something Ti-Cats fans had become very familiar with that season — a Tony Champion touchdown. But still early in the first quarter, Champion re-aggravated a rib injury on a rough hit.\n\nSTEEN I was right down there when he hurt himself in the Eastern Finals. He exposed himself on a catch and landed on the ball. It was pretty evident that he was seriously hurt. I didn’t really expect that he was going to be playing in the Grey Cup. I thought he’d be a scratch. When he came out of the tunnel I just thought, “Holy smokes, this is one tough dude.”\n\nTONY CHAMPION, Tiger-Cats receiver [as told to Vanstone in 2010] I broke my ribs [in the first quarter of the Grey Cup]. I told the doctor, “Put an H bandage around them and see how long they last. I’ve got all winter long to heal up.” This is what you play for. I’m going to miss the biggest game of the year because my ribs are broken? I don’t think so.\n\nGORRELL I saw him putting on the flak jacket and I went over and told him, “We gotta keep going, keep fighting. We need you.”\n\nSUITOR Never did our coaches suggest that we should target an injured player. But I knew he was hurt, in all honesty. It wasn’t to deliberately hurt him, but I knew he was banged up and any more shots on him could have a lingering effect. Maybe he drops a pass late in the game because of some wear and tear early. There was one hit on the sideline [in the first half], and I thought it was a tad late but I didn’t get penalized for it. I probably should have. When I hit him, I heard him wheezing and gasping for breath a little.\n\nDIPIETRO Most of us knew from experience [a comeback] could happen. Thirteen points is nothing in a CFL game. They had all kinds of good receivers — we were well aware of their potential.\n\nGREGORY We were down a couple of early touchdowns and then Jeff [Fairholm, Riders receiver] made a great catch and went all the way on a hot route, right down the seam. That was critical in that zone coverage, hitting those seams.\n\nRIDGWAY Jeff was probably one of the fastest players I ever had as a teammate — just incredible speed and great hands — a super athlete. And you could just see Kent’s confidence starting to build at that moment.\n\nVANSTONE The Tiger-Cats were still celebrating a touchdown catch by McAdoo when all of a sudden Austin hit Fairholm with a bomb. It just shut down the Tiger-Cats’ celebration. From then on it was just an emotional roller coaster. Very stressful. It was absolute murder on your nervous system because you knew that every play could be the decisive play. It ripped your heart out in one second and left you three feet off the ground the next.\n\nThe Fairholm touchdown grab came partway through a wild second-quarter run in which both teams went back and forth, combining for five scores on five consecutive drives. At the half, Saskatchewan had clawed within five as the score sat at 27-22.\n\nSUITOR It was this chess match that was happening at light speed.\n\nDIPIETRO There were a few times I said, “Man, these [fans] must be having a great time” because it was a great game. But as a player you’re just gnawing inside. It felt like one of those games where the last team with the ball was going to win.\n\nSUITOR It was amazing how little we celebrated when we made a play or how little we mourned when we were beaten on a play. We were in for a battle and we knew it. When you got the opportunities it was important to take advantage.\n\nNear the end of the third quarter, with Hamilton still up five after the clubs traded field goals, the usually reliable Tiger-Cats special teams made an uncharacteristic error.\n\nOSBALDISTON We were punting out of the end zone. It was a pretty tight part of the ball game and I got a high snap I had to jump up for. That throws off your timing and it takes you longer to get the ball off and makes you susceptible to a blocked punt. So when I came down, I took a peek up and there was a period where I probably could have kicked the ball, but I would have had to rush it and my steps were off. This is all going through your head really fast, but I didn’t want to give them good field position at that time. I decided I’d rather take the safety than have a short or blocked punt. Play it safe and live another day.\n\n[snippet id=4269767]\n\nOsbaldiston tucked the ball and hit the ground. The safety narrowed Hamilton’s lead to three, 30–27.\n\nBRUNO That was the right decision. I congratulated him afterwards. If he’d gotten rid of it, it woulda been a lousy kick. Those two points didn’t beat us.\n\nSaskatchewan scored on a one-yard run by Tim McCray later in the third to take the lead for the first time in the game. After the teams again exchanged field goals to open the scoring in the fourth, Kent Austin was picked off in the end zone by Will Lewis, a controversial interception that was ultimately called back.\n\nSTEEN Hamilton was beginning to play very tight. The preceding play had gone to the other side of the field and I was a long ways away out on the left hash mark and my partner was on the boundary. The pass goes into his area and I saw a lot of contact but thought, “He’s closer than me, so I’m not getting involved.” I knew I had to be very careful with my calls. The next play comes out to my side and Will Lewis got a little grabby, and I banged him with a pass interference call.\n\nELGAARD I see [Lewis] all the time. He always comes up to me and says, “Hey, you’ve got my ring on” [laughs].\n\nVANSTONE That looked like an interception to me. If there had been video replay back then, you may be reading a different story. That play could have and probably should have been turned over on video replay. Instead, the Riders keep the ball and kick a field goal to go up 40–33.\n\nSTEEN After the game we were in our dressing room and the director of officiating, Don Barker, was there with his assistant Neil Payne, and Neil came running over to me and gave me a hug. He said, “Bud, thank God you got that pass interference call right.” I told him, “So I guess that one’s going to grade OK, huh Neil?”\n\nStill down 40–33 with 48 seconds left, Hamilton had the ball on the Riders’ 10. That’s when a controversial non-call set the stage for “The Catch.”\n\nSUITOR I remember talking in the huddle with [defensive back] Richie Hall: “Who should we double team?” The coaches wanted me to help on Rocky DiPietro. We thought Mike Kerrigan would go there. And on first down he did.\n\nDIPIETRO I had a chance to score but the defence made a good play and got a hand in.\n\nBRUNO The defender held him by the jersey. DiPietro would have caught that ball — I know he would’ve.\n\nELGAARD There were lots of calls and non-calls that were a little bit questionable on both sides. There were three or four head-scratchers, but that’s the way it goes.\n\nSTEEN The term we used was “there has to be blood on the knife.” It wasn’t enough for a guy to have a knife out — you had to see blood on it before making a call. We didn’t want to be the deciding factor.\n\nSUITOR Before the next play, there was the same discussion, “Should we double DiPietro again, or should I go to [Tony] Champion?” The call from the bench was, “Back on DiPietro. Stay hard on the middle.” Me and [defensive back Richie] Hall had a quick discussion as to whether or not we should change the call, “Shouldn’t we be thinking about Champion?” Richie wanted to make the change, [but] we ended up staying on DiPietro.\n\nBRUNO We had a couple plays lined up and I told Kerrigan to look for Champion. If we’re going to score, he’s the one who can do it.\n\nChampion had been Hamilton’s big-play weapon all season, setting a Tiger-Cats record with 15 touchdowns. Despite his broken ribs, he was still a constant threat to score.\n\nCHAMPION [as told to Vanstone in 2010] I came back to the huddle, and [Kerrigan] looked at me and I looked at him. I knew I was getting the ball, and I was going to do anything I could to get it. The first hand the ball touched was my left. My right hand wasn’t on it yet. I turned around but, if you watch the replay, you can see that I never took my eyes off the ball. Then I fell backward and caught it.\n\nVANSTONE I was trying to digest what I just witnessed. Not only had the Roughriders won a Grey Cup, 23 years to the day after they’d won their first one, but they won it in this amazing game following an amazing upset and a season that was all over the place. I was just in shock. Like, “What have I just seen?”\n\nELGAARD On the field it was immediately hugs and congrats and “Oh my God, we won the Grey Cup.” There’s the usual milling about while they bring the Cup out and the commissioner stands up to talk. Baker’s out there on a podium with the Cup and we stormed the podium. We all went up there and grabbed the damn thing. Then it was party time. In the dressing room we go. Booze is flowing, girlfriends, wives, brothers, sisters. The place was packed.\n\nSUITOR Everyone’s jumping on each other, and there are grown men crying. You can’t believe it just happened.\n\nGREGORY I tried to give a quick talk afterwards, get ’em settled down a bit, but that was almost impossible. Everyone was having fun and dumping all kinds of — I don’t know what it was — beer and champagne and whatever else.\n\nRIDGWAY After the game, you do your interviews and you head to the locker rooms and have a beer or two with the guys. Most of the guys had family that had come in, and the higher-ups in the organization, they’re all there getting pictures with the guys. I just sat down at my locker. Yeah, I got my picture kissing the Grey Cup, and then I sat down. One by one, people are straggling out of the ballpark. And when I was finally getting changed, there were four or five guys at that end of the room — Roger Aldag, Bob Poley, James Ellingson, myself — who just didn’t want to leave. You just wanted to drink in the atmosphere—and I’m not talking about the beer.\n\nSUITOR A couple of buddies back home in Vancouver were watching, and the CBC was doing interviews and my friends were wondering why I wasn’t on any of them; they were wondering where I was. I had found a little quiet spot — and I guess I have to hand in my man card now — but I was emotional, just crying my eyes out. Because it had happened. It was that unbelievable season, everything that you work for, here it was. That white piece of tape was going to be replaced by the ring."
