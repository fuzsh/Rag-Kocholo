        "text": "As is tradition, I’m rolling out my complete 2018 NFL mock draft. This is for the entire league. All 256 draft picks and as we’ve done over the past few years, five UDFAs for each team just for fun. We have explanations for each pick, a look into the value or need, so take an extended lunch break before diving in.\n\nFor anyone new reading this, my final Pittsburgh Steelers focused mock draft will look different than this one. That mock will be posted Thursday morning.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy. Leave your feedback below.\n\n2018 Seven Round Mock Draft\n\nRound One\n\n1. CLE – Sam Darnold/QB USC: Despite flirtations with Josh Allen and Baker Mayfield, the Browns get back on the right path and take Darnold, who threw 57 touchdowns in two year’s as USC’s signal caller. The Browns hope to finally land their franchise QB.\n\n2. NYG – Saquon Barkley/RB Penn State: Gotta keep it simple and go with the best player on the board. Giants have lacked a true feature back and Barkley is the top one in this class. They averaged 3.9 yards per carry in 2017 and found the end zone just six times on the ground, one of the worst figures in the league. Barkley is special with his blend of size and speed.\n\n3. NYJ – Baker Mayfield/QB Oklahoma: We’ll see how real the reports are of Mayfield going to the Jets are. Though he’s controversial for mostly the wrong reasons, his height and “antics,” he’s a more refined QB than people assume but is a special player beyond the structure of the play. With Josh McCown back and Teddy Bridgewater around, the Jets can sit him for some portion of time if they feel that’s what is best for his development.\n\n4. CLE – Bradley Chubb/DE NC State: Hue Jackson waxed away about pairing Chubb with Myles Garrett earlier in the offseason. With Barkley off the board and the Browns taking their quarterback, Jackson gets his wish. Chubb probably isn’t quite as good as Garrett but it’ll make their pass rush potent. With Larry Ogunjobi clogging the middle, the Browns are going to have a solid defensive line.\n\n5. DEN – Josh Allen/QB Wyoming: Not everyone is going to agree with Allen going top five and I don’t think I do either. But history shows NFL decision-makers always fall in love with size, arm strength, and potential, which Allen has in spades. They signed Case Keenum but that’s a short-term option and Paxton Lynch definitely isn’t the answer.\n\n6. IND – Tremaine Edmunds/ILB Virginia Tech: It’s fair to argue taking Edmunds here is too high but again, teams love upside and potential. Edmunds is one of the highest ceiling guys in the draft, only 19 years old on draft day. He’ll be 24 when his rookie year is up, a unicorn for the NFL, and someone you can feel completely comfortable with giving a second contract to. Edmunds has the athleticism of a three down linebacker to replace Jon Bostic, who almost never missed a snap before missing the final two weeks of the season. Chris Ballard’s job is to fix this defense top to bottom. It needs a lot of paint but with plenty of draft picks at his disposal, he’s got a large brush.\n\n7. TB – Quenton Nelson/OG Notre Dame: Arguably the best player in the draft who feels like the only slam dunk to have a prolific career, Nelson falls into Tampa’s laps. He has the size, physicality, and a great OL coach in college in Harry Hiestand to make him a true plug ‘n play offensive linemen. He’ll replace Evan Smith at left guard and be the anchor of the line from Day One.\n\n8. CHI – Harold Landry/OLB Boston College: The first surprise of the draft. But the Bears needs pass rush help coming off a year where their production came more from scheme than it did the individual. Only DL Akiem Hicks had more than five sacks. Vic Fangio gets his center piece along the edge. Landry is one of the best pass rushers in the draft, showing tremendous bend around the edge and excellent production, especially as a junior.\n\n9. SF – Minkah Fitzpatrick/DB Alabama: He’ll off talent and versatility to the 49ers secondary, even after inking Richard Sherman to a deal. He could play corner or safety for San Francisco. He was dominant as a sophomore in 2016, picking off six passes. Eric Reid was let go and Jimmie Ward, who is moving back to corner, hasn’t been able to stay on the field. So help is needed. I think Fitzpatrick sees a lot of work in the slot.\n\n10. OAK – Roquan Smith/ILB Georgia: It’s been reported the Raiders have their heart set on taking Smith with this pick. A player who can do it all and is widely viewed as the top ILB in this class, he’ll anchor the middle of the Raiders’ defense. Bruce Irvin can do what he does best – rush the QB. Smith can run and cover and has some underrated sideline to sideline ability, allowing him to recover the rare time he make a mistake or bad read.\n\n11. MIA – Lamar Jackson/QB Louisville: It’s hard to be sold on Ryan Tannehill’s future at this point of his career with the injuries and middling success. Adam Gase definitely wouldn’t be someone who would shy away from a player (wrongly) thought to be just a running QB and he’s innovative enough to play to his quarterback’s strengths. The Dolphins could easily look to add in the secondary here, I debated between Jackson and CB Denzel Ward, but settled on Jackson and the upside and excitement he brings.\n\n12. BUF – Leighton Vander Esch/MLB Boise State: The names at linebacker in Buffalo are…weak, and that’s probably being kind. Matt Milano, Lorenzo Alexander, Tanner Vallejo. They lost Preston Brown in the offseason, who soaked up plenty of snaps, but LVE can fill those shoes and to a much higher level. A great athlete who plays hard every snap, he’ll begin rebuilding that unit. And a rush defense that allowed nearly 125 yards a game in 2017. The biggest concern now is the medical and Vander Esch is rumored to have some teams scared off. If he’s healthy, he’ll be the one scaring opposing offenses.\n\n13. WSH – Denzel Ward/CB Ohio State: This could be a little lower than reality for where the first corner, widely expected to be Ward, will end up being selected but that just means the value is too tough to pass up here. Ward is a little light in an age where corners are bigger and bigger but still viewed as the top dog in his class, a shutdown player who left school a year early. He’ll start opposite Josh Norman.\n\n14. GB – D.J. Moore/WR Maryland: Debating between Moore and Marcus Davenport but wide receiver is the larger need after the team dumped Jordy Nelson and didn’t address it in free agency. Moore has been compared to fellow Terp Stefon Diggs and tested like a top-notch athlete with solid production (1033 yards, 8 touchdowns in 2017). With Jimmy Graham in the fold and now Moore, Aaron Rodgers will have plenty of weapons to spread the ball around to.\n\n15. ARI – Kolton Miller/OT UCLA: The Cardinals need all the help they can get along the offensive line, especially after signing the brittle Sam Bradford to try and survive 16 games. Whether that’s at left tackle to replace the struggling D.J. Humphries or right tackle with the unimpressive Andre Smith, Miller will fit. He’s a good athlete but there’s a lot of work to do to max him out.\n\n16. BAL – Marcus Davenport/DE-OLB UTSA: Maybe Baltimore isn’t the cleanest place for Davenport to go, widely viewed as a pure 4-3 end than a stand-up linebacker. But the Ravens run a hybrid front and plenty of sub-packages where Davenport can put his hand down or kick inside when some of their big uglies up front, like Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce, are removed from the front. Davenport has an eclectic personality but there’s nothing wrong with that. He has to be a more consistent pass rusher and strong at the POA but there’s plenty of upside here. Without a huge need at any one position and 16 being too high for a TE like Dallas Goedert, the Ravens focus on talent. That’s how Ozzie Newsom has always come out on top.\n\n17. LAC – Vita Vea/NT Washington: It’s fair to question if Vea can truly be an impact pass rusher but it sounds like the consensus is a “yes.” Meaning he’s one of the rare nose tackles who can be selected in the first round. LA had a strong pass defense, though they have to replace Tre Boston at FS, but the league’s worst run defense, a near-historically bad 4.9 YPC allowed. Vea will clog the middle and if he can collapse the pocket, make Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram all the more potent.\n\n18. SEA – Derwin James/SS Florida State: At some point, you just have to put the focus on talent. There’s too much uncertainty of Kam Chancellor’s future and even if he plays at 2017, who knows what will happen beyond that. A Pete Carroll defense doesn’t work without great safeties and James will be next in line who at worst, should get heavy work in sub-packages his rookie season.\n\n19. DAL – Courtland Sutton/WR SMU: The only way the Cowboys release Dez Bryant so late in the offseason, well after free agency, is if they have their heart set on a wide receiver early in the draft. Moore is off the board and Ridley didn’t test well so I think they go with the local product in Sutton, who caught 68 passes and averaged 16 yards on each of those last year. He’ll start Day One.\n\n20. DET – Taven Bryan/DT Florida: A bit of a late riser in the process, Bryan is a quick athlete off the ball and although he isn’t as refined of a pass rusher, is expected to go in the first round. The Lions need a three tech to wreak some havoc. They won’t get that from 23-going-on-57 year old A’Shawn Robinson and the rest. With Ziggy Ansash, the surprise Anthony Zettel brought on the edge, and Kerry Hyder, the Lions can have an impactful front four.\n\n21. CIN – Frank Ragnow/C Arkansas: Most expect Iowa’s James Daniel to be the first center off the board but Ragnow has been a popular name over the last week, known for his physicality and play strength as opposed to Daniels’ quickness and lateral movement. The Bengals look to replace the very replaceable Russell Bodine and better establish a ground game that finally found its footing late in the year, in large part due to Joe Mixon becoming the guy in the backfield. The Bengals can’t expect to win with their hold-your-nose offensive line.\n\n22. BUF – Josh Rosen/QB UCLA: Buffalo gets the last of the tier-one quarterbacks, taking Rosen. He may not fall this far on draft day but without us predicting trades, he slides. There’s not much going on at QB for the Bills after moving on from Tyrod Taylor. Personally, Rosen is my favorite QB of the whole class. The knocks on him are somehow weaker than most of the QBs, mainly coming from his health and vague “character” concerns.\n\n23. NE – D.J. Chark/WR LSU: The draft loves speedy receivers and taking Chark is like when the Houston Texans selected Will Fuller 21st overall in 2016. Chark was underused in a run-central offense but performed well at the Senior Bowl and parlayed that into a strong Combine (4.34 40, 40 inch vert). The Patriots quickly replace Brandin Cooks with Chark.\n\n24. CAR – Josh Jackson/CB Iowa: Carolina does have a new defensive coordinator and it’s a little unclear how much the scheme will change. But the Panthers played more zone coverage than any other team last year and Jackson is an ideal zone corner. Aggressive on the ball with excellent length, he’s too stiff in his turn and pedal to play a lot of man but could thrive in a zone-driven defense. They traded away Daryl Worley to the Eagles and haven’t found the right replacement for Josh Norman yet.\n\n25. TEN – Lorenzo Carter/LB Georgia: There’s a big hole at ILB after losing Avery Williamson to the New York Jets. Rashaan Evans is a possibility but the flexibility Carter brings – not to mention athleticism – is hard to ignore. The Titans get a flexible linebacker who played inside and outside in a similar scheme. An excellent fit.\n\n26. ATL – DaRon Payne/NT Alabama: A plugger up front, Payne adds some much-needed depth to the Falcons’ defensive line. Like Vea, and even moreso with Payne, it’s a question of if he can be an every down player but the Falcons don’t have many choices with Bryan off the board in this mock. The Falcons’ run defense was middling, allowing 4.1 YPC, and don’t have anyone else on the roster who could reasonably be counted on as an upgrade. He’ll slide in next to Grady Jarrett.\n\n27. NO – Mike Gesicki/TE Penn State: Sean Payton drafted Jimmy Graham and Gesicki hopes to be the next version of him. A slightly better blocked than given credit for, Gesicki is still going to win with his size and leaping ability. He needs to be a more consistent route runner who shows more snap at the top of his route and run with effort even when not the primary read but he’ll add another weapon to an already loaded Saints’ offense.\n\n28. PIT – Rashaan Evans/ILB Alabama: One of the most popular picks in mock drafts. Evans fills the role held by Ryan Shazier, whose future is in question and already ruled out for 2018. Evans has been hampered by a groin injury throughout the pre-draft process, never running a 40, but is physical, productive, and DL coach Karl Dunbar knows him well, serving as the Crimson Tide’s DL coach the previous two seasons. Evans can play a little on the edge too, something the Steelers often ask their ILBs to do on third down.\n\n29. JAC – Mike Hughes/CB UCF: The Jaguars have two top corners in Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Boyue but lost Aaron Colvin to the Texans this offseason, leaving a hole in the slot. That’s where Hughes comes into play. There’s some off the field concerns with him, he transferred from North Carolina to Central Florida after multiple issues but physically, he’s blessed with elite tools and intercepted four passes in 2017.\n\n30. MIN – Mike McGlinchey/OT Notre Dame: The Vikings look to fill out the holes in their offensive line and Mike Remmers is speculated to move from RT to guard. They don’t have great in-house options to replace him, compelling them to take a tackle early in this one. McGlinchey was a three year starter and two-time captain.\n\n31. NE – Jaire Alexander/CB Louisville: If the Patriots keep both their picks, corner could be high on their list. Trading for Jason McCourtey isn’t good enough. Alexander is the ideal corner. Nearly 200 pounds who runs in the high 4.3’s with seven interceptions under his belt, including five in 2016. He’ll replace Malcolm Butler.\n\n32. PHI – Derrius Guice/RB LSU: Finally, a running back to round out the first round. The Eagles have shown interest in Guice, who had an excellent career at LSU and considered the second-best back in this class. Philly lost LeGarrette Blount to Detroit and though their committee approach worked last year, having a clear #1 certainly isn’t a bad thing. Guice would be that guy from Day One. Guice is the pick as the Cowboys boo the entire time Philly is on the clock.\n\nRound Two\n\n33. CLE – Mason Rudolph/QB Oklahoma State: In reality, it’s unlikely Rudolph lasts to the second round but without any trades, he falls. It’s been reported the Browns are considering taking two QBs, even with picks one and four, though that would be extreme. A little similar to what Washington did with Robert Griffin and Kirk Cousins, the Browns get a QB after nabbing Josh Allen and Bradley Chubb in the first.\n\n34. NYG – Isaiah Wynn/OG Georgia: Great value here in the second. The line is a mess pretty much across the board even after adding Nate Solder. Wynn’s lack of size has most projecting him to guard but on tape, he is someone who can play tackle. Either way, it’ll fill a hole along the Giants’ front.\n\n35. CLE – Carlton Davis/CB Auburn: Cleveland has a couple interesting corners but no one you can fully trust. Davis is a long, press corner who despite playing only three seasons, recorded 32 starts. No defense allowed a higher completion percentage than the Browns (68.6%).\n\n36. IND – Terrell Edmunds/SS Virginia Tech: Capable of playing free or strong, Edmunds will play the latter alongside Malik Hooker. The Colts have drafted some athletic safeties in recent years (Hooker, Clayton Geathers, T.J. Green) and Edmunds fits that bill. Ran a 4.47 at the Combine to go along with a 41.5 vert and 11’2” broad. Doesn’t get much better than that. Fun story of the draft, they take both Edmunds brothers and turn them into the new Sedin twins.\n\n37. IND – Calvin Ridley/WR Alabama: Value too hard to ignore here as the Colts add a receiver after losing Donte Moncrief in the offseason. Ridley’s athleticism is questionable based on how he tested but he’s a guy you trust the tape on. High level of success despite below average QB play in college.\n\n38. TB – Isaiah Oliver/CB Colorado: Underrated corner whose name hasn’t gotten much attention during this process. Standing in at 6’0, 210 with great ball skills will. Bucs need corners. Maybe a starter, definitely depth.\n\n39. CHI – Will Hernandez/OG UTEP: Hernandez is an old-school guard with a Greg Lloyd disposition. Had a fantastic Senior Bowl week and got great coaching from his HC in college, Sean Kugler. Reminds me of Josh Sitton, released by Chicago in the offseason.\n\n40. DEN – Sony Michel/RB Georgia: Only the third running back to be selected so far. Value here is strong. Denver released C.J. Anderson and didn’t add anyone else in the offseason. Devontae Booker is still very much in the mix but the draft can change plans when a guy like Michel falls to here.\n\n41. OAK – Quenton Meeks/CB Stanford: Maybe a bit of a stretch but Meeks has the makeup of an NFL starter. Stays local, strong pedigree, with the triangle numbers and production. Oakland has one of the worst cornerback situations in the NFL.\n\n42. MIA – Maurice Hurst/DT Michigan: Now cleared from his heart issue at the Combine, Hurst is in the late first-round conversation. Miami curiously dumped Ndamukong Suh in the offseason and don’t have a replacement on the roster for him at 3T. Hurst racked up 32 TFL in his Wolverine career.\n\n43. NE – Connor Williams/OT Texas: In addition to Butler, the Pats lost Nate Solder to free agency and there’s a big hole at left tackle. Williams started 28 games for the Longhorns. This is good value and truthfully, Williams probably goes 10 spots higher. Still, the Patriots take a flier and hope to mold him.\n\n44. WSH – B.J. Hill/DT NC State: A little higher than expected but Hill and teammate Justin Jones had a strong week at the Senior Bowl. Both move eally fluidly for his size. Washington’s defensive line is a mess and their run defense was in the bottom five of the NFL last year. He’ll anchor the middle of the line. He and Jonathan Allen can try to turn things around.\n\n45. GB – Austin Corbett/OG Nevada: Another OL with an excellent week at Mobile that put him on the map, there aren’t many who have the strength and violence that he plays with. Corbett played tackle and guard in college but should slide into the RG spot left by Jahri Evans.\n\n46. CIN – Christian Kirk/WR Texas A&M: A.J. Green is a top flight receiver but there isn’t much behind him. The Bengals did draft John Ross a year ago the it legitimately feels like they’ve moved on from him already. So they selectt Kirk, who tested well and had a solid, though unspectacular, college career.\n\n47. ARI – James Daniel/C Iowa: Cardinals go offensive line heavy. A.Q. Shipley shouldn’t be a long-term starter at this point in his career. Daniel could go 10-15 spots higher and is lauded for his lateral agility. Had an excellent Combine workout. Arizona looks to reinvent its o-line.\n\n48. LAC – Justin Reid/FS Stanford: Bit of a fall for him, Reid could sneak as high as a late first round selection. Tre Boston was allowed to test free agency and the Chargers haven’t replaced him. Reid played a lot of slot corner in college but has a safety mentality in coverage with a great ability to find and track the football. Tremendous athlete and a seemingly high football IQ.\n\n49. IND – Nick Chubb/RB Georgia: Considered going with a corner here but instead, it’s Chubb. Marlon Mack brought some spark to an offense that desperately needed one but it’s hard to count on him being the guy. Chubb tested as a better athlete than I expected and recovered nicely from his knee injury, rushing for over 1300 yards and six yards a carry last season. The replacement for Frank Gore.\n\n50. DAL – Dallas Goedert/TE South Dakota State: Goedert could go higher in this draft but he falls to Dallas, who needed to find Jason Witten’s replacement two years ago. One of the top small school players in this class.\n\n51. DET – Mark Andrews/TE Oklahoma: Mini tight end run. Andrews isn’t much of a blocker but hopefully will hit the potential Eric Ebron didn’t quite reach, though he was better than perceived. Detroit brought in former Seahawk Luke Willson in the offseason but that isn’t good enough, even if they are high on Michael Roberts.\n\n52. BAL – Dante Pettis/WR Boise State: A dynamic receiver, returner, the Ravens add another wideout despite bringing in two during free agency, neither who are certain to be long-term options. Pettis can replace Michael Campanaro in the return game and offer plenty out of the slot.\n\n53. BUF – Donte Jackson/CB LSU: Buffalo had a ton of success in taking Tre White last year so why not draft a LSU teammate? Corner is certainly a position of need for the Bills. Hard to trust Vontae Davis’ health in the short-term and he’s definitely not in the long-term plans.\n\n54. KC – Tyrell Crosby/OG Oregon: The only trouble spot along the Chiefs offensive line is left guard, which seems wide open right now. Crosby played tackle in college but they’ll try to convert him to guard. Easier said than done but still, not an impossible task. Nose tackle is a position to address after losing Bennie Logan but there simply wasn’t a good enough option left on the board.\n\n55. CAR – Sam Hubbard/DE Ohio State: Hubbard’s 40 time may ding him a bit but I can’t get over the bend he shows on tape and the 6.84 three cone at 270 pounds. Carolina racked up the sacks last season but Julius Peppers is 87 years old and they have to have an eye to the future. Taking Hubbard is strong value.\n\n56. BUF – Billy Price/C Ohio State: A torn pec on the bench press at the Combine hurt his stock but it turns into a steal for the Bills. If healthy, Price would’ve squarely been in the first round conversation. The Bills need to add to the offensive line after Eric Wood retired and Richie Incognitio has at least threatened doing so.\n\n57. TEN – Ronnie Harrison/SS Alabama: Good value here for the Titans. The Titans might not need a safety but Harrison is too talented to pass up and will push Jonathan Cyprien at strong safety. Failing that, he can work in a sub-package role. Probably not a selection everyone reading this will agree with.\n\n58. ATL – Anthony Miller/WR Memphis: Falcons need more than just Julio Jones – who just went MIA on social media – to throw to. Miller dominated Conference USA to the tune of 37 career touchdowns, including 32 the past two seasons. He is likely to start right away and could be in contention for rookie of the year.\n\n59. SF – Malik Jefferson/ILB Texas: The 49ers have to figure out what to do without Reuben Foster, whose NFL future is in total doubt and rightfully so. Jefferson is a good enough athlete to play all three downs though he has to prove he can be as consistent against the run, too.\n\n60. PIT – Jessie Bates III/FS Wake Forest: Falling into the end of the second round, Bates has been on the Steelers radar throughout the draft process. He’s young, productive, with good character and Pittsburgh dined with him at their Pro Day. Bates is unlikely to be a full-time starter out of the gate but will play in dime packages right away.\n\n61. JAC – Micah Kiser/ILB Virginia: Call him the next Paul Posluszny. He tested much better at Indy than I expected and it’s impossible to ignore the off-the-charts production he had at UVA. Led the ACC in tackles for three straight years. Only he and Luke Kuechly can say that, good company to be in. Base linebacker though, he won’t see the field in nickel and dime.\n\n62. MIN – Josh Sweat/DE Florida State: Excellent value here late in the second round. Sweat could play either an end or outside linebacker but he’ll obviously keep his hand down in the Vikings’ even front. Vikings disappointed with just 37 sacks in 2017.\n\n63. NE – Ronald Jones/RB USC: New England is constantly is looking to add at running back and they’re unpredictable in the draft altogether. Jones is another value selection at the end of the second round. He rushed for over 1500 yards and 19 touchdowns last season at USC.\n\n64. CLE – Brian O’Neill/OT Pittsburgh: The Browns offensive line is in good shape. It was in great shape before Joe Thomas retired. Big shoes to fill but they can’t role with what they have right now on the blindside. O’Neill looks the part but didn’t play like a top tackle on tape.\n\nRound Three\n\n65. BUF – Harrison Phillips/DT Stanford: Kyle Williams is still kicking for Buffalo and they inked Star Lotulelei to a big deal in the offseason. I’m not crazy about Phillips’ game and thought he overachieved in college but he’s expected to go in the second to third round. In 2016-2017 combined, he recorded 29 TFL and 16.5 sacks, which to be fair, is difficult to ignore.\n\n66. NYG – Rasheem Green/DE USC: The Giants need pass rush after underachieving and then trading away Jason Pierre-Paul to the Bucs, finishing last year tied for 29th. This won’t be the last time in this draft they select a pass rusher. Green had 10 sacks last season.\n\n67, IND – M.J. Stewart/CB UNC: Colts keep adding to the defense, their third selection already. Stewart is likely to play in the slot. He’s tough, supports the run with everything he’s got, and times his blitzes really well. Ideal spot in the nickel. Colts allowed 8 YPA last year, tied for worst in the NFL.\n\n68. HOU – Kerryon Johnson/RB Auburn: Bit of good value here for the Texans, who dip their toe into draft waters for the first time. 213 pounds who jumped 40 inches in the vert is pretty rare. He’s averaged a touch under five yards per carry in 2016 and 2017.\n\n69. NYG – Duke Ejiofor/DE Wake Forest: Another pass rusher for the needy Giants. Ejofor had a strong career at Wake, wrapping it up with 24 sacks, but a torn labrum held him out of the pre-draft process. Could turn out to be a steal.\n\n70. SF – James Washington/WR Oklahoma State: Some help for the 49ers offensively at a spot without much top-end talent nor depth. Washington doesn’t run a crazy fast 40 but is a true downfield threat who tracks the football well.\n\n71. DEN – Holton Hill/CB Texas: 1st round talent with off the field concerns of a UDFA. But he’s well worth a flier for the upside he brings. Aggressive in coverage, closes on the ball, and packs a punch. Denver looks to replace Aqib Talib.\n\n72. NYJ – Kemoko Turay/OLB Rutgers: Turay stays local to a team who seemingly forever has needed OLB help. Turay tested at a tremendous level at his Pro Day and bends the edge as well as nearly anyone in this class. That helps make up for an average frame. The Jets finished last year with only 28 sacks. Demario Davis and Muhammad Wilkerson led the team and neither are still a Jet.\n\n73. MIA – Ian Thomas/TE Indiana: Thomas is another late riser at tight end with only one year of college production, snagging 25 passes for the Hoosiers a year ago. But he made the most of it, averaging 15 yards per grab and five touchdowns. Miami needs help all over the map but tight end is barren.\n\n74. SF – Alex Cappa/OG Humboldt State: Cappa is one of the top small-school linemen in the draft and left a trail of defenders in his wake in college. He’ll kick inside after playing tackle the last four years. That shouldn’t be a shock – he got work at guard at the Senior Bowl. 49ers have several maulers up front.\n\n75. OAK – DaeSean Hamilton/WR Penn State: One of the best route runners in the draft, Hamilton tore up the Shrine Game and Senior Bowl. Oakland did add Jordy Nelson but with after a rough year from Amari Cooper, they need all the weapons they can get. For Hamilton, he needs to work on his hands, which has been the same issue as Cooper.\n\n76. GB – Uchenna Nwosu/ILB-OLB USC: The Packers racked up plenty of sacks last year but Clay Matthews is getting long in the tooth. Nwosu is similar to Matthews in plenty of ways. Inside/outside versatility and obviously, came from the same school. Impact player with 9.5 sacks and some excellent coaching, led by Kenechi Udeze.\n\n77. CIN – Fred Warner/ILB BYU: Strong value here in the third round. Warner is an easy-mover and takes on blocks better than he’s given credit for. Bengals need some every-down linebackers; too often in recent years, they’ve tried to mix and match without consistent success. Vontaze Burfict is talented but impossible to count on.\n\n78. KC – Ogbonnia Okoronkwo/OLB Oklahoma: Chiefs need pass rush help opposite of Dee Ford. Okoronkwo uses his lack of height to dip and rip under and consistently does a good job on the edge, though he has to be strong at the point of attack and make up for his smaller frame.\n\n79. ARI – Tarvarius Moore/FS Southern Miss: A sleeper whose name has been kicked around plenty over the last two weeks. Blew his Pro Day out of the water with a 4.38 40 and 38.5 vert. Forgotten about early in the draft process because he has just one year of production, though it was a good one (87 tackles, 3 TFL, 3 INTs as a senior). He replaces Tyrann Mathieu and it’s no surprise to see a former DB coach like Steve Wilks add someone in the secondary.\n\n80. HOU – Geron Christian/OT Louisville: Texans focus on athleticism in a weak class. RT is a mess after Derek Newton’s severe knee injury, now released, and though they seem high on Julie’n Davenport, that’s just one tackle spot. Mel Kiper Jr. talked him up a week ago as a potential early pick. He started three seasons for the Cardinal.\n\n81. DAL – Dane Cruikshank/FS Arizona: Another name that’s gained steam over the last month. Byron Jones has officially moved to corner under Kris Richard and there aren’t great in-house options at safety. Cruikshank tested like a ridiculous athlete at 6’1, 209 pounds. He ran a 4.41 40, 38.5 inch vert, and 10’1” in the broad. Picked off three passes a year ago.\n\n82. DET – Shaquem Griffin/ILB UCF: Griffin is mainly known for his story but the on-field tape warrants a Day Two draft pick. Trying to figure out exactly where to play him is going to be a little difficult and probably all over the map but he can be a cover linebacker on third downs and elite special teamer. Matt Patricia is someone who is going to be creative and think outside the box to make Griffin fit, who has the drive and talent so succeed on Sundays.\n\n83. BAL – Mike White/QB Western Kentucky: The Ravens miss out on a top QB and dip into the second tier with White, who impressed in the Senior Bowl game. The Ravens know a thing or two about developing big quarterbacks from smaller schools.\n\n84. LAC – Rashaad Penny/RB San Diego State: The Chargers are mostly set with Melvin Gordon but depth is lacking. Andre Williams might be the worst #2 in the league. Penny can earn backup snaps and become the team’s starting KR day one. He was one of college football’s best.\n\n85. CAR – Jerome Baker/OLB Ohio State: Baker is light at 229 pounds but this is a defense that took Shaq Thompson who weighed 228 and tested similar across the board. He’ll bridge the gap of Thomas Davis’ four game suspension. Griffin would be a good option here too had he been available.\n\n86. KC – Rashaan Gaulden/FS Tennessee: Gaulden didn’t have a great Combine and his college production is limited. That probably doesn’t project as high of a pick as some believe. But the Chiefs need help at safety next to Eric Berry. Robert Golden won’t cut it.\n\n87. LAR – Josey Jewell/ILB Iowa: After smartly trading away Alec Ogletree, the Rams need to find his replacement. Jewell had a strong Pro Day and is an old-school football player who just produces. 433 career tackles is no joke.\n\n88. CAR – Equanimeous St. Brown/WR Notre Dame: The Panthers still haven’t properly replaced Kelvin Benjamin though Devin Funchess stepped up last year after struggling his first two seasons. St. Brown is built like Benjamin but has more slot potential. Cam Newton needs another weapon beyond Funchess and Torrey Smith.\n\n89. TEN – Hayden Hurst/TE South Carolina: Could be considered a fall for Hurst but his tape doesn’t stand out in any one way, he’s already 25 after an unsuccessful baseball career, and tight ends take time to develop. That’s not a recipe to drafting someone high. He’ll slide in behind Delanie Walker.\n\n90. ATL – Anthony Averett/CB Alabama: Some corner depth for the Falcons, who already don’t have a ton of needs and play the value game. Averett’s a two-year starter who intercepted a pass last season. Nick Saban’s pattern match-heavy scheme makes his corners NFL ready.\n\n91. NO – Nathan Shepherd/DT Fort Hayes State: Shepherd could easily go a lot higher, though sometimes the small school DL get too much hype and wind up going a round later than expected. Shepherd blew up at the Senior Bowl. Good interior help for New Orleans.\n\n92. PIT – J’Mon Moore/WR Missouri: Though he didn’t run a blazing 40 yard dash, he tested in the 90th percentile at receiver who made big plays downfield and gives it his all as a blocker. Steelers are working under the assumption this will be Martavis Bryant’s last season – a safe bet to make.\n\n93. JAC – Marcus Allen/SS Penn State: Pretty good value here for the Jaguars. Allen is as steady as they come. Good tackler, effective as the Robber in underneath zone. But he’s a pure box safety, at best, Patrick Chung, who doesn’t make many impact plays. Only one career interception.\n\n94. MIN – Andrew Brown/DT Virginia: An explosive three tech who doesn’t quite know what to do with it, he’s a good pick to try and mold and turn into a starter in two years. Recorded 26.5 TFLs for a loss, 23.5 over his last two seasons.\n\n95. NE – Kyle Lauletta/QB Richmond: One of those guys who you just look at and go, “yeah, this dude is going to be a Patriot.” Popular FCS sleeper. Bill Belichick gets his backup QB after trading away Jimmy Garoppolo last season.\n\n96. BUF – Dalton Schultz/TE Stanford: Schultz is arguably the best blocker in this year’s draft. Doesn’t have a tremendous ceiling but you know what you’re getting from him. He should slide in ahead of Nick O’Leary as Charles Clay’s backup.\n\n97. ARI – Bo Scarbrough/RB Alabama: I can definitely see someone like Scarbrough as someone who guys higher than others predict. Blend of size and athleticism, even if he never quite lived up to that potential in school (1517 career rushing yards). They rolled the dice on another physical freak in David Johnson and that clearly worked out.\n\n98. HOU – Arden Key/OLB LSU: Projected to be a top five pick a year ago, Key had a terrible 2017. He left the team for rehab, his weight ballooned up to 280 pounds, and his production fell of a cliff (5.5 TFL, 4 sacks in eight games). Effort has been an issue with him, too. But if he can get back to what he was, this is one of the best picks in the draft. With J.J. Watt back, this unit can take a much needed step in 2018.\n\n99. DEN – Michael Gallup/WR Colorado State: They still have Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders but not much behind either. Gallup has great hands who had two outstanding years in college. Combined, nearly 2700 yards and 21 touchdowns.\n\n100. CIN – P.J. Hall/DT Sam Houston State: To end the third round, the Bengals dip into the small school pool. Hall had an insanely productive career, critical for anyone looking to make the jump to Sundays, and the Bengals struck gold with the height-challenged Geno Atkins. A 4-3 front like the Bengals needs excellent depth to keep fresh bodies in and keep the pressure on throughout the entire game.\n\nRound Four\n\n101. GB- Duke Dawson/CB Florida: Excellent value here for someone with Day Two talent. Dawson can be over-aggressive in coverage but he’s physical with great short area quickness. Makings of a strong nickel corner for a unit that needs help in the secondary. Packers allowed 7.9 YPA last year, third worst in the NFL.\n\n102. TB – Justin Jackson/RB Northwestern: A sleeper back, he averaged 4.8 yards per carry and caught 122 passes. NFL-ready which is good because he might wind up starting for them Day One after moving on from Doug Martin and Charles Sims.\n\n103. HOU – Christopher Herndon/TE Miami (FL): Not a lot going on at tight end, though I thought Stephen Anderson made a couple nice plays for them last year. Herndon caught 40 passes and four scores as a senior.\n\n104. IND – Joseph Noteboom/OT TCU: Colts get some tackle help for the right side of the offensive line. Noteboom was a three-year starter for the Horned Frogs. Everything rests on Andrew Luck’s mending shoulders.\n\n105. CHI – Allen Lazard/WR Iowa State: A big receiver with great vertical and better route runner than most of his frame, he’ll give Mitch Trubisky an easy target. Lazard was a huge recruit who stayed in the family at ISU and had a successful career. 26 career touchdowns, including ten a year ago.\n\n106. DEN – Braden Smith/OG Auburn: A little taller than you’d expect at 6’6 but he had an extensive career at right guard for the Tigers. And a good one, named an AP All-American in 2017. The Broncos have a big hole at right guard and this will help address it. Good value.\n\n107. NYJ – Derrick Nnadi/NT USF: They did bring back Mike Pennel but Nnadi can be a backup and clog the middle of that run defense at 6’1 317. Steve McLendon is 32 years old. Nnadi picked up 24.5 career TFL.\n\n108. NYG – Daurice Fountain/WR Northern Iowa: Giants replenish themselves at receiver after releasing Brandon Marshall, even though it looks like they’ll hang onto Odell Beckham Jr. Fountain dazzled at the Shrine game and at 6’1 206 with a wild 42 inch vert, looks the part.\n\n109. WSH – Orlando Brown/OT Oklahoma: After one of the worst Combine workouts ever, Washington finally takes a flier on the big-bodied Brown. They need depth behind Trent Williams and Morgan Moses, who have been plagued by injuries.\n\n110. OAK – Chukwuma Okorafor/OT Western Michigan: The man who kept Taylor Moton on the right side in school, Okorafor has the frame of a tackle (6’6 320) and the starting experience. He could compete for time over on the right side, a spot that looks weak.\n\n111. LAR – Royce Freeman/RB Oregon: Only the second pick in the draft for the Rams. Maybe a bit of a luxury but the Rams don’t have much to offer behind All-Star Todd Gurley. Freeman averaged six yards a pop last year and has 79 career receptions to his name. He’ll be out there for the 15% of snaps Gurley won’t play.\n\n112. CIN – Ade Aruna/DE Tulane: Bengals double-up on defensive linemen though Aruna will play defensive end. Bengals like guys with height and length (6’5, 34 inch arms). Impressive numbers at the Combine. He’ll have to hope for a better NFL career than college, however. Just 11 career sacks, one season with more than two.\n\n113. DEN – Dorian O’Daniel/ILB Clemson: O’Daniel is one of the lightest linebackers in the draft, coming in at 223 was an improvement for him. O’Daniel isn’t as impressive on tape as I’d like him to be but he’s a good athlete and someone I think can become an excellent special teamer. Denver did bring back Todd Davis during free agency and he’ll add depth behind that.\n\n114. CLE – Troy Apke/FS Penn State: Only a one-year starter who turned heads at the Combine with an insane workout. Being a one-year starter hurt him but it’s worth the flier. Could be an excellent gunner. Offers some standard safety depth, even after trading for Damarious Randall.\n\n115. CHI – Darius Leonard/ILB South Carolina State: Chicago lost Christian Jones to the Detroit Lions. Leonard can replace him. A quad injury hindered some of his workouts but he had a good Senior Bowl week.\n\n116. DAL – Martinas Rankin/OG Mississippi State: Rankin could kick inside at the next level as the Cowboys add another piece to their offensive line. Though unlikely out of the shoot, maybe it helps keep La’el Collins at tackle. Rankin was an All-SEC pick as a senior.\n\n117. DET – Isaac Yiadom/CB Boston College: One of my favorite CBs in the draft, Yiadom reminds me a bit of Darius Slay. Long, capable in press, and more than willing in run support, he’s an aggressive corner that fits well with their scheme.\n\n118. BAL – Jamarco Jones/OT Ohio State: Ravens offensive line is in a weird situation. Not positive what’s going to happen at LG with Alex Lewis’ return or the long-term viability of James Hurst at right tackle. Jones is a little undersized. I’d probably start him off at guard and try to make the transition there.\n\n119. LAC – Oren Burks/ILB-OLB Vanderbilt: A heady safety turned linebacker, Burks is a good athlete but not as consistent in coverage and has to do better disengaging from blocks in the run game. But he’s easy to like and reminds me a bit of Jatavis Brown. Bit of a project but there’s potential to unlock.\n\n120. SEA – Scott Quessenberry/C UCLA: Stop me if you’ve heard this one before – Seattle needs offensive line help. Nothing new here. Quessenberry didn’t have a great Senior Bowl week but moves well who started the past two years at center.\n\n121. BUF – Tre’Quan Smith/WR UCF: Time to get Rosen some weapons. Zay Jones future is on shaky ground right now. Smith is a deep threat who averaged nearly 20 yards per catch in 2017.\n\n122. KC – Genard Avery/ILB Memphis: The Chiefs went out and got Anthony Hitchens last year to pair with Reggie Ragland, who had a surprisingly strong 2017. But depth is still weak and one injury could put them in the same hole as the past, moving Daniel Sorensen into the box and having issues stopping the run. Avery is an inside/outside guy with a whopping 44.5 TFL throughout his Tigers’ career.\n\n123. MIA – Kyzir White/S West Virginia: Like the value here. White played a sort of Star position at WVU and moved all around the defense. He timed like a SS and that’s probably ideal for him but I think he has more range than some of his measurables suggest. Depth behind T.J. McDonald and the always underrated Reshad Jones.\n\n124. KC – Tremon Smith/CB Central Arkansas: Small schooler who zipped up mock drafts over the past two weeks leading up to Thursday. Chiefs begin their work to replace Marcus Peters, dealt to the Rams this offseason. Smith ran a 4.36 and intercepted five passes last year, giving him 15 for a career.\n\n125. TEN – Jeff Holland/OLB Auburn: Another edge rusher for the Titans, though Lorenzo Carter is going to be moved around. A well-built outside linebacker, Holland has flashed on tape and did a great job replacing Carl Lawson in 2017, finishing it with 9.5 sacks.\n\n126. ATL – Nyheim Hines/RB NC State: Hines could go higher after a blazing fast 4.38 40, though his lack of size could cap his upside. Hines’ main contribution will come in the return game. Tevin Coleman is entering the final year of his contract and could move on, no longer wanting to be stuck second fiddle to DeVonte Freeman.\n\n127. NO – Jack Cichy/OLB Wisconsin: Cichy has medial concerns but that didn’t stop the organization from drafting Alex Anzalone last year who played a grand total of like, three games at Florida. Cichy probably made evaluators feel better about rolling the dice on him after a strong Pro Day workout.\n\n128. SF – Michael Dickson/P Texas: The top punter on the board, Dickson could go 20 or 30 spots higher. Bradley Pinion hasn’t worked out as well as the team hoped when they drafted him. Dickson averaged a cool 47.4 yards per punt each of the last two years. 49ers look for their next Andy Lee.\n\n129. JAC – Chase Litton/QB Marshall: It’s always hard to figure out what QBs are going to go on Day Three. It’s going to vary so much board-to-board. So while taking Litton on the fourth might feel like a bit of a reach, anything is possible. He looks like Blake Bortles at 6’5 230 pounds and threw at least 20 touchdowns each year as a starter.\n\n130. PHI – Justin Jones/DT NC State: Welcome back to the draft, Philadelphia. Their first selection since the end of the first round, they go with Jones. Philly lost Beau Allen to Tampa this offseason and though Haloti Ngata is in the fold, Jones will be around for much longer. He didn’t test well at the Combine but he’s a better athlete on tape. Quick first step and a surprisingly effective spin move.\n\n131. MIA – Desmond Harrison/OT West Georgia: The Dolphins offensive line is pretty much a mess all over the place. Releasing Mike Pouncey, issues at tackle on the right side. They definitely could take one higher. Harrison tested well and rebounded after getting sick for the Senior Bowl.\n\n132. PHI – Kentavius Street/DE NC State: Two NC State teammates with three picks and another member of the Wolfpack off the board. Street might not be an ideal fit to play defensive end due to a little lack of height and length but the Eagles are a team that relies on their pass rush and front four. Street tore his ACL in a workout for an NFL team but that didn’t prevent the Eagles from taking Sidney Jones coming off his Achilles injury last year.\n\n133. GB – Kevin Toliver II/CB LSU: Pretty good value here. The Packers took Duke Dawson in this mock to play in the nickel, Toliver can play on the outside and is built similarly to Kevin King, who Green Bay scooped up last season. Production, however, is limited. Just two career picks.\n\n134. ARI – Da’Shawn Hand/DE Alabama: Another value-driven selection. Five tech who can beef up the Cardinals odd front. Arizona though, to their credit, had a stout run defense but let go Josh Mauro, who went to the Giants.\n\n135. LAR – Joshua Kalu/FS Stanford: Rams don’t have a huge amount of holes in the roster after all the trading they did. Some view Kalu as a 7th round pick but I can’t see how a 6’0, 203 pound safety who runs in the 4.5’s, jumps 41 inches, with decent production at an excellent school falls that far. Kalu stays local with the Rams.\n\n136. LAR – Skylar Phillips/OG Idaho State: Here, the Rams go small-school, something Sean McVay wasn’t afraid to do in his first draft. Phillips had a decent week at the Senior Bowl and provides some interior depth.\n\n137. DAL – Kallen Ballage/RB Arizona State: The Cowboys lost Alfred Morris and there’s a void behind Zeke Elliott. Ballage needs to run tougher and can’t rest on the laurels of a seven touchdown game forever but he’s got the size and hands out of the backfield that could see him get work on third down right away.\n\nRound Five\n\n138. GB – Poona Ford/NT Texas: Zero tech with good hand use and someone who can make more plays than the typical plugger. Defensive line depth is on the thin side, even if the front lines are really strong, led by Mike Daniels, one of my favorite players to watch.\n\n139. NYG – Brandon Parker/OT North Carolina A&T: Mountain of a man at 6’8, 305 pounds. The Giants keep adding to the o-line, especially as trade rumors swirl around Ereck Flowers. Started all four seasons for the Aggies.\n\n140. IND – Darius Phillips/CB Western Michigan: Two birds, one stone with this one. Phillips helps out at cornerback but just as importantly, offers plenty as a return man. Averaged nearly 24 yards in his career and over 26 in 2017. Picked off 12 passes too. That’s nothing to sneeze at.\n\n141. SEA – Cedrick Wilson Jr./WR Boise State: A better version of Jermaine Kearse, Wilson isn’t going to run the fastest 40 but is a vertical threat who does a great job of being able to track the football downfield. NFL bloodlines with his dad playing years in the NFL. Could get work in the return game though I imagine most of those duties will be kept by Tyler Lockett.\n\n142. WSH – Josh Adams/RB Notre Dame: A big but explosive back, Washington is looking for help in the backfield on first and second down. Chris Thompson is a tremendous third down back but after Matt Jones failed, there’s no lead horse on this team. He averaged close to seven yards a carry in his career.\n\n143. SF – DeShone Elliott/SS Texas: Replacement for Eric Reid, even if Reid spent a large chunk of last year at linebacker. Good depth and Elliott is a talented player, even if he isn’t a natural ballhawk. Solid athlete sideline-to-sideline who can run and hit and always seems to be in the right spot. A junior with room to grow.\n\n144. TB – Toby Weathersby/OT LSU: Another tackle off the board as the Bucs try to get back to the strong o-line they had several years ago. Physically, he looks like a tackle but injuries have stunted his career.\n\n145. CHI – Jalyn Holmes/DE Ohio State: A classic five tech to add depth to an impressive starting DL. Holmes, however, had a quiet career, having trouble cracking the starting lineup and ending his time as a Buckeye with a light 14 TFL and five sacks.\n\n146. SEA – Matthew Thomas/OLB Florida State: SPARQ-type off-ball linebacker. Standing in at 6’3 232, he jumped 41.5 inches at the Combine, 10’11” in the broad, and a 6.85 three cone to top it all off. Maybe he finds the starting lineup at some point in 2018.\n\n147. NO – Gregory Senat/OT Wagner: Saints know the value of hitting on their offensive line. And they haven’t been afraid to dip into the small schools either, striking gold with Terron Armstead several years ago.\n\n148. PIT – Kylie Fitts/OLB Utah: Steelers look to add to its edge rush with Bud Dupree not developing the way the team had hoped – even after they scooped up his 5th year option – and the release/retirement of James Harrison. Fitts has good size and an impressive sub 7 three cone time. Unfortunately, injuries slowed him down and he never had more than seven sacks in a year, coming back in 2015.\n\n149. DEN – Jordan Whitehead/SS Pittsburgh: The Broncos took a flier on Su’a Cravens but that won’t stop them from taking someone like Whitehead, who may go a round higher. He didn’t run great though at Indy (4.6 flat) and has only three career interceptions, partially why I have him dropping nearly out of the Top 150.\n\n150. CLE – John Kelly/RB Tennessee: The Browns signed Carlos Hyde, who overall did well to stay healthy last year, but it’s hard for him to shake the injury-prone label. The Browns woefully underutilize Duke Johnson, hopefully that changes under Todd Haley, but Kelly can be added to the mix. A big back, similar to Hyde.\n\n151. CIN – Will Richardson/OT NC State: Cincinnati rolled the dice on letting Andrew Whitworth walk and put the trust in their high draft picks, Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher. It hasn’t worked out so the Bengals will take another crack at it with Richardson, who weighs in at 6’6 306 pounds.\n\n152. ARI – Joel Iyiegbuniwe/ILB Western Kentucky: The Cardinals wisely brought back Josh Bynes, an underrated linebacker who did well in spot starts last season, but depth isn’t great and Deone Bucannon is coming off a poor season. He had a solid combine workout.\n\n153. DET – Matthew Gono/OG Wesley: Small school riser through the pre-draft process, the Lions showed interest in him. Interior depth for a group that isn’t quite sturdy yet. Matthew Stafford was sacked 47 times last year.\n\n154. BAL – Deadrin Senat/NT USF: Senat may only be a plugger but Baltimore doesn’t mind that. He’ll provide depth behind Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce. He’s definitely similar to Pierce.\n\n155. LAC – Daniel Carlson/K Auburn: While the Chargers did sign Caleb Sturgis and brought in Robert Aguayo, neither are great options. Aguayo could be cut to let Carlson and Sturgis battle it out. He had a great 2015 and 2016 who holds 14 Tigers’ kicking records.\n\n156. SEA – Cole Madison/OG Washington State: More offensive line help for a unit that will take all it can get. Good value here for Madison, though his base gets too wide and he has trouble anchoring in pass protection.\n\n157. NYJ – Nick Nelson/CB Wisconsin: An injury while working out for a team in the pre-draft process could hurt him a little but the prognosis sounds good. It didn’t slow fellow Badger Aaron Colvin down years ago. The Jets allowed 30 touchdown passes last year, one of the worst marks in the league.\n\n158. CIN – D.J. Reed/CB Kansas State: The Bengals have a strong return man in Alex Erickson but Reed is sort of Pacman Jones like in terms of on-field use and return value. He has seven career INTs and two return touchdowns, one on kicks and punts.\n\n159. OAK – Akrum Wadley/RB Iowa: Different looking back to Doug Martin and Marshawn Lynch. Wadley could become the #3. He had a better junior year than 2017 campaign but has a couple fans in the draft community.\n\n160. DEN – Mason Cole/C Michigan: Matt Paradis is an excellent center so this is a depth move. Cole can become an interior swing player, who converted from tackle to the pivot. Every team needs a swing linemen who can play up and down the line and save a spot on the gameday roster.\n\n161. CAR – Jaylen Samuels/RB NC State: Big back to replace Jonathan Stewart. Could steal a couple snaps away from Christian McCaffrey. Tyler Gaffney retired to play baseball for the Pirates. Samuels has been listed as a tight end and worked out as such at Indy but his best home in the NFL is in the backfield.\n\n162. TEN – Deon Cain/WR Clemson: Good value pick here for the Titans. Cain proved to be a big-play threat with Deshaun Watson in 2016, averaging nearly 20 yards per catch. He finished his career with 20 touchdowns.\n\n163. WSH – Joe Ostman/OLB Central Michigan: Productive MAC pass rusher who put up 19 TFL and 13 sacks as a senior. Tested really well in the pre-draft process, too. Strong value who can rotate with Preston Brown and make an impact on special teams. Good special teamers are often good pass rushers who know how to work off blocks on the coverage unit.\n\n164. NO – Avonte Maddox/CB Pittsburgh: Don’t see a ton of needs here for the Saints so focusing on value. Maddox is an underrated slot corner who reminds me of former Pitt player K’Waun Williams. Ran a scorching 4.39 40 at Indy.\n\n165. PIT – Bilal Nichols/DL Delaware: Small school sleeper who will have to play up and down the line in Pittsburgh’s defense. Should enter the year the backup to NT Javon Hargrave and a reserve defensive end in case of injury. Came on strong with 6.5 TFL and 5.5 sacks last season although career production is limited.\n\n166. BUF – Trayvon Henderson/SS Hawaii: Limited athlete but physical and has great ball skills who shut down some of the top tight ends in Mobile. Think at worst, he’ll make for an excellent special teamer who could come in on third and long.\n\n167. MIN – Godwin Igwebuike/FS Northwestern: Another safety off the board as the Vikings finally select out of the trenches. 5’11, 213 and ran in the mid 4.4’s. Whopping 324 tackles in his career, surpassing the 100 mark as a junior.\n\n168. SEA – Luke Falk/QB Washington State: There’s no depth behind Russell Wilson. Falk doesn’t have a big arm but played well under Mike Leach. 119 career TDs. He stays local.\n\n169. PHI – J.C. Jackson/CB Maryland:. Mid-rounder prospect who intercepted four passes as a junior in 2017. Good Combine showing – 4.46 40, 35 inch vert, 10 foot broad. Eagles add some corner depth.\n\n170. CIN – Deon Yelder/TE Western Kentucky: Yelder is an athletic pass-catcher. Tyler Eifert was brought back but his injury history is as long as the big plays he’s made over his career. Yelder had a good week at the Senior Bowl.\n\n171. DAL – Tyquan Lewis/DE Ohio State: Steady pass rusher against solid competition, Lewis had between seven and 8.5 sacks the last three seasons. Cowboys get pass rushing depth with question marks up front. The Cowboys finished middle of the pack with 38 sacks a year ago.\n\n172. GB – Johnny Townsend/P Florida: The Packers finished in the bottom third in punting average last year. Townsend averaged well over 47 yards per boot the last two years, finishing first in college football in 2016 and first in the SEC his senior season.\n\n173. OAK – R.J. McIntosh/DE NC State: Interior depth for the Raiders even though they might have found a good one in Eddier Vanderdoes, who surprised last year. Excellent value here. Depth guy who had 12.5 TFL as a senior for the Hurricanes.\n\n174. GB – Trey Quinn/WR SMU: Good value here for someone who could go much higher. Packers reloading their wide receiver group for Aaron Rodgers. Quinn can work out of the slot and had an amazing final year to salvage his career. 114 catches, over 1200 yards and 13 scores. Next Jordy Nelson?\n\nRound Six\n\n175. CLE – Justin Watson/WR Penn: Another value-driven selection for a big-play receiver who turned heads at the Senior Bowl and his Pro Day workout. Browns focusing on the few positions they haven’t addressed yet. Watson is capable of making some high degree of difficulty catches.\n\n176. LAR – Folorunso Fatukasi/NT UConn: Gained steam in the back half of the draft process. Athletic, which will fit well under Wade Phillips hybrid 3-4 defense. Four sacks as a senior for the Huskies.\n\n177. HOU – Trenton Thompson/DE Georgia: Dig the value value here for the Texans in the 6th round. He’ll work as a five tech for the Texans. Their run defense allowed 14 tackles last year; granted, that was without J.J. Watt for most of the year.\n\n178. IND – Bradley Bozeman/C Alabama: Colts could definitely focus on the offensive line higher than this but went with a defense-driven draft instead. Bozeman has good size for a center and provides interior depth for an OL that has struggled for several seasons, keeping Andrew Luck on the sidelines.\n\n179. NYJ – Gerhard de Beer/OT Arizona: Late riser with a really interesting back story. Track and field star who quit it to play football full-time. Even offered to punt for the Wildcats. Bulked up from 262 pounds as a freshman. Born in South Afirca. Jets add a project to protect Mayfield down the road.\n\n180. TB – Quin Blanding/SS Virginia: Steady, reliable tackling safety with one of the most productive careers in Cavalier history. All-time leader in tackles with nearly 500 in his career. Worry about his range and ability to make plays in space and he may end up as just a special teamer. But a guy who will make the bottom of the roster more competitive and therefore, better.\n\n181. CHI – Tim Settle/NT Virginia Tech: Many believe he’ll go higher than this but a one-dimensional run stuffer doesn’t hold a ton of value in the draft. The Bears get some beef up front on the interior defensive line.\n\n182. ARI – Tyler Conklin/TE Central Michigan: Maybe with a new coach, the Cardinals will place more of an emphasis on a pass-catching tight end and not treat them like a glorified tackle. Conklin tested well and caught 11 touchdowns his past two years combined.\n\n183. LAR – Marquis Haynes/OLB Ole Miss: A raw edge rusher who is older than you’d like, Haynes has to be a more consistently powerful pass rusher. But he flashes with his first step and we’ll see what Wade Phillips can try and turn him into.\n\n184. SF – Skai Moore/OLB South Carolina: Didn’t test well but hard to ignore some rare production at linebacker. 14 career interceptions – that’s more than what a lot of DBs end their careers with. 49ers picked off only 10 passes last year, one of the ugliest marks in the NFL.\n\n185. OAK – Deatrick Nichols/CB USF: Undersized nickel/dime corner. The team took a flier on Senquez Golson, who has a similar profile. Nichols didn’t pick off quite as many in college but still had a respectable 11 in his career.\n\n186. GB – Hercules Mataafa/OLB Washington State: A terribly undersized 3T in school, he didn’t test well to make teams feel like he could transition to playing in space. But his production was outstanding and the Packers are a versatile enough defense to try and figure out a niche role for him.\n\n187. BUF – Byron Pringle/WR Kansas State: Excellent athlete who is a big play threat as a receiver (24.6 yards per catch last year) and return man (2 career KR scores). Pringle could go higher than this. Turned some heads in Mobile.\n\n188. CLE – Christian Campbell/CB Penn State: Browns have more picks than what they know to do with, even for a roster that’s rebuilding like they are under John Dorsey. Campbell tested like a quality athlete, one of many coming out of Happy Valley’s strength and conditioning program. Second one they select.\n\n189. NO – Dejon Allen/OG Hawaii: Calling Allen a guard but he moved around in college, playing everywhere but center. Smaller school player who can get ignored because of the conference and time zone he plays in.\n\n190. BAL – Siran Neal/FS Jacksonville St: Small-school prospect – Ozzie Newsome isn’t afraid to draft those guys (in his last season before taking a reserve role). Neal is one of the most grabby DBs in this class but that mentality can work well at safety instead of corner, where he’d be a penalty machine.\n\n191. LAC – Durham Smythe/TE Notre Dame: Like the value here. Smythe was predominantly used as a blocker but he’s an underrated receiver with great body control and a solid pair of hands. Antonio Gates is still a free agent. Smythe can compliment Hunter Henry after his breakout year.\n\n192. DAL – Breeland Speaks/DE Ole Miss: Speaks is a quality athlete who can offer more pass rush help, especially with the recent allegations against David Irving. Taking one of the best players still on the board. Impressive 2017, his junior season, finishing with 8 TFL and 7 sacks. This is a steal.\n\n193. DAL – Marcell Ateman/WR Oklahoma State: Good value here and a sort of Dez Bryant replacement in terms of use/size. He averaged 19.6 yards per catch with eight scores in the Cowboys – which plays well in a draft story – high-octane college offense.\n\n194. LAR – Nick Stevens/QB Colorado State: Underrated QB who tossed 29 touchdowns as a senior while holding a career completion percentage of nearly 62%. Will battle for the #3 spot as Jared Goff’s understudy.\n\n195. LAR – Tony Brown/CB Alabama: Pretty good value here though I don’t love Brown’s game. Rams rounding out their already strong cornerback group as a team without really any other needs to address at this point of the draft.\n\n196. KC – Joshua Frazier/NT Alabama: Back-to-back Bama boys. Frazier is mostly a one-note plugger but got good coaching from Nick Saban and Karl Dunbar. Someone who can plug the middle the way Dontari Poe did all those years, though Frazier isn’t even in the same universe in terms of athleticism and ability to play a large chunk of the snap count like Poe could.\n\n197. CAR – Tracy Walker/FS Louisiana: Panthers could take a safety higher than this. Nabbing Walker in the 6th would be a mini-steal. He has plenty of starting experience and eight career interceptions.\n\n198. NE – Will Dissly/TE Washington: One of the best blocking tight ends in the draft. Pairs well with how often the Patriots use 12/22 personnel or in year one, some of the heavy three tight end sets Bill Belichick can use. No one wham blocks more than the Patriots.\n\n199. TE – Chase Edmonds/RB Fordham: Derrick Henry is the guy now and they added Dion Lewis. But the #3 spot is pretty open. Edmonds has plenty of talent but injuries have followed him throughout his career. Worth taking the chance on.\n\n200. ATL – Colby Gossett/OG Appalachian State: General offensive line depth for Gossett. Team showed interest in him at the Senior Bowl. He was a 3 1/2 year starter in college at right guard. He’s their guy with the 200th pick of the draft.\n\n201. NO – Quadree Henderson/WR Pittsburgh: Adding Cameron Meredith helped but the Saints march on to take another receiver (though Gesicki is functionally one). Willie Snead was wrangled away by Baltimore. Henderson is listed as a receiver but think of him as a return man. And he was a good one, too. Electric player at Pitt who could do kicks and punts from the word go, or if not, post-Ted Ginn’s time.\n\n202. TB – Tanner Carew/LS Oregon State: Long snapper alert! The best one in the draft, Carew is a sincerely impressive athlete who can be a force running down punts. The Bucs have just one long snapper, signed to a futures deal this winter. Crazy as it sounds, when long snappers get drafted, it happens in the 5th or 6th round, not the 7th.\n\n203. JAC – Dylan Cantrell/WR Texas Tech: Big-bodied receiver to help fill the loss left by Allen Robinson. Blake Bortles needs more to work with, though DeDe Westbrook should be able to pick up where he left off from his rookie campaign.\n\n204. MIN – Richie James/WR Middle Tennessee State: A broken collarbone pulled him off the radar for most of the year but he secured a combine invite and impressed. Laquon Treadwell has 21 receptions two years removed from being a first round pick.\n\n205. WSH – Brian Allen/C Michigan State: More offensive line help. Allen is a little undersized though. Reminds me of Austin Blythe, drafted in the 7th round back in 2016 by the Colts.\n\n206. PHI – Leon Jacobs/OLB Wisconsin: Athletic off-ball linebacker. Eagles have been rumored to move on from Mychael Kendricks for awhile now though the need here was lessened considerably after the surprising re-signing of Nigel Bradham to a long-term deal.\n\n207. GB – David Bright/OT Stanford: Bright (Ed Note: bad um tiss), versatile linemen to round out depth along the Packers’ offensive line. Maybe never a star but could turn himself into a solid swing tackle. Like his size.\n\n208. DAL – Tarvarus McFadden/CB Florida State: 200 pound corner who ran terribly at the Combine, turning in a 4.67. Dallas drafts him for what he did in 2016, picking off a whopping eight passes. Worth taking a flier on, though I wonder if he’s going to be a good enough athlete to stick.\n\n209. MIA – Sean Welsh/OG Iowa: More offensive line depth for a team that needs the help. Welsh could go a little higher than this given his size and pedigree. Captain, extensive starting experience, most of which came at guard but a couple at right tackle.\n\n210. NE – Michael Joseph/CB Dubuque: Doesn’t have top flight speed but above average ball skills who works hard to get back in-phase when beat. Held his own at the Senior Bowl. Someone who showed he can hang with Division One competition.\n\n211. HOU – Mike McCray/ILB Michigan: Like his physicality versus the run and how versatile he was in Don Brown’s defense. But he’s a limited athlete who is only going to work in a 3-4 defense as a run stopper. Maybe they can squeeze some special teams value out of him, too.\n\n212. OAK – Kameron Kelly/FS San Diego State: Safety who offered to move to corner to help the team after losing several players there, including Damonte Kazee. His time speed and tape says he’s going back to safety. Big frame, physical, and made some big plays in his career, including a game-clinching interception versus Stanford last year.\n\n213. MIN – Tanner Lee/QB Nebraska: Looks the part with his frame, arm strength, and occasional flash when it all comes together. But his decision-making is poor, accuracy worse, and he’s a total project. Will compete as the #3 with Kyle Sloter.\n\n214. HOU – Armani Watts/FS Texas A&M: Fluid safety who has seemed to fall down draft boards for reasons I’m not totally clear on. Safety depth even after the team signed Tyrann Mathieu to a one-year deal.\n\n215. BAL – Jordan Thomas/TE Mississippi State: Tight end taken probably later than what it will be come draft day. Thomas is a physically imposing tight end with limited college production. 22 receptions as a senior but I kinda like his game.\n\n216. OAK – Wyatt Teller/OG Virginia Tech: Some potential there but his game has never really panned out and he had a tough showing at the Senior Bowl. Tom Cable looks to work his…uh, magic?\n\n217. OAK – Jester Weah/WR Pittsburgh: High-upside receiver who could go in the mid-rounds as opposed to the end of it. As a junior in 2016, he averaged more than 24 yards per grab and finished over the 20 mark for his career. Stands in at 6’2, 211.\n\n218. MIN – Quentin Poling/LB Ohio: Back to Minnesota to round things out as the draft feels like it’s in Groundhog Day at this point. Oakland, Minnesota, Houston. Poling came on strong during the process. Good athlete (4.58 40, 38 vert, 10’7” broad) and the Bobcats all-time leader in solo tackles and TFL.\n\nRound Seven\n\n219. NE – James Looney/DE Cal: Looney is a top athlete who can offer more pass rush help. He ran a sub .500 40 at Indy with 20.5 career TFL. Could line up in a variety of places\n\n220. PIT – Jermaine Carter Jr./ILB Maryland: Captain and leader of the defense, he was an every-down player. Could play a little on the edge but will round of the bottom of the inside linebacker depth chart.\n\n221. IND – David Steinmetz/OT Purdue: Late round flier as the tackle pool dries up. Great size (6’7, 321) who started three years at Rhode Island before transferring to the Boilermakers. Colts getting late draft help along the offensive line.\n\n222. HOU – Kurt Benkert/QB Virginia: He’ll be the #3 behind Deshaun Watson and Brandon Weeden, though Weeden feels like a rough option as their #2. Benkert has a couple of fans in the draft community.\n\n223. SF – Dimitri Flowers/FB Oklahoma: 49ers love to get their fullback involved and though they have one of the league’s best, Flowers is the best at his position out of the draft. He can block and is a really good receiver relative to the position who made a couple of big plays against Oklahoma State in a shootout victory.\n\n224. CHI – Jarvion Franklin/RB Western Michigan: Bruising back who can try to eek out one of the final spots on the 53 or failing that, the practice squad. Jordan Howard’s name keeps coming up in trade rumors, though I don’t expect anything to happen.\n\n225. MIN – Travon Blanchard/SS Texas A&M Commerce: Talented Baylor product who left school after being arrested on assault charges, causing him to fall off the radar. When he was there, he played three seasons and picked off four passes. Could be a hybrid player who was a safety/linebacker in school. Nine TFLs, four sacks in 2017.\n\n226. SEA – Kendrick Norton/DT Miami (FL): Interior depth for the Seahawks. Norton finished his career with 84 tackles, 18 of them for a loss and has good size at 6’3, 314. Big body, one-tech type.\n\n227. MIA – Brandon Shed/WR Hobart: Small-school All-Star the Dolphins showed interest in during the Pro Day circuit. 2016 was his best year, hauling in 74 passes and 17 touchdowns. Numbers dipped across the board last year.\n\n228. OAK – Dorance Armstrong Jr./DE Kansas: Looks the part with his size and length but tested like a terrible athlete. Could go higher but I don’t think he’s hitting enough benchmarks for teams to love him or the severe drop off in production, going from 10 sacks in 2016 to only two last year.\n\n229. MIA – Reggie Bonnafon/RB Louisville: Listing him as a running back but could make a full-time move to receiver too. Maybe it’s a dumb idea but I like bringing in a player from the same school as the QB I take to give my new franchise guy a familiar face in an otherwise chaotic situation. Bonnafon is a legit athlete and this is an area of need for the Dolphins. Could be addressed higher.\n\n230. JAC – Troy Fumagalli/TE Wisconsin: Jaguars did add Austin Sefarian-Jenkins and this is obviously for depth. Fumagalli makes combative catches and was asked to block than most tight ends but nothing he does really stands out.\n\n231. WSH – Deontay Burnett/WR USC: Potential slot receiver who ran an impressive 4.43 40 at the Combine and caught 86 balls a season ago. Left school a year early.\n\n232. GB – Christian Sam/ILB Arizona State: Average athlete but an impressive 2017 campaign. 127 tackles, 9.5 for a loss, and a trio of sacks. May end up going higher but it’s a strong class overall. A little Jake Ryan-esque.\n\n233. KC –Antonio Callaway/WR Florida: Chiefs didn’t have any problems taking Tyreek Hill and Callaway carries his own baggage, too. The talent is there. Everything else is the question. But a low-risk move in the final round.\n\n234. CAR – Will Clapp/C LSU: Generic offensive line depth as we near the end of the draft. He was a Rimington Finalist and captain of that Tigers’ offense.\n\n235. NYJ – Jordan Atkins/TE UCF: His age hurts him, he embarked on a baseball career and now he’s 25, but he’s a good athlete than had an underrated week in Mobile. Had a big 2017, averaging over 16 yards per grab and four scores.\n\n236. DAL – Riley Ferguson/QB Memphis: Not much behind Dak Prescott. Ferguson is a big-bodied QB who threw 38 touchdowns to only nine picks last year. Completed over 63% of his passes, too.\n\n237. DET – Keke Coutee/WR Texas Tech: Late round flier on someone who projects to play in the slot. Big junior season, 93 grabs for over 1400 yards and ten touchdowns.\n\n238. BAL – Ja’Whaun Bentley/ILB Purdue: Two-down thumper who has flown under the radar. Led the Boilermakers with 97 tackles (11.5 for loss) as a senior. Ran a 4.75 at his Pro Day and overall, is a marginal athlete.\n\n239. GB – Mark Walton/RB Miami (FL): An ankle injury limited his 2017 season and his Combine workout was poor but he’s a one-cut runner with burst who finishes his runs and one of the best pass protectors in this draft. Sneaky good value, akin to Corey Clement last year.\n\n240. SF – Marcell Frazier/OLB Missouri: Tested well at his Pro Day and got on the radar. Ran a 4.63 Pro Day, 33.5 vert, and 9’10” broad, respectable across the board. 15.5 sacks the last two seasons.\n\n241. WSH – Shaun Dion Hamilton/ILB Alabama: They let Will Compton go to free agency, probably a wise move. Dion Hamilton is undersized with a checkered medical history, a bad combination, that causes him to go in the back end of the final round.\n\n242. CAR – Michael Carrizosa/P San Jose State: Big-legged punter with a career long of 73 yards. Panthers need a punter. So…here’s a punter.\n\n243. KC – Davontae Harris/CB Illinois State: Value here. Popular small-school sleeper who started three seasons for the Redbirds. Problem is he has as many interceptions as sacks (three). Ran a 4.43 at the NFL Combine.\n\n244. ATL – Natrell Jamerson/FS Wisconsin: Guy who came on strong at the Combine, running a 4.4 flat and jumping 35 inches in the vert. Good coaching from Jim Leonard. Picked off a pair of passes last season and offers some kick return value.\n\n245. NO – Dee Liner/DL Arkansas State: Little extra defensive line depth to wrap things up for the Saints. They took a good look at him at his Pro Day. Liner clogged the middle of their defensive front at 337 pounds and recorded 6 TFL last season. He makes the All-Name team, if nothing else.\n\n246. PIT – Grant Haley/CB Penn State: Super athletic corner. Local product and though he didn’t coach him, new DB coach Tom Bradley was at Penn State for decades. Haley picked off five career passes, two of them coming in 2017.\n\n247. JAC – Mike Needham/LB Southern Utah: Small-name prospect who ran a 4.6 flat at his Pro Day, topped off by a 35 inch vert and 10’6” broad. A cool 100 tackles a year ago. Jaguars showed some interest in him.\n\n248. SEA – Marcus Martin/FB Slippery Rock: One of the best pass rushers in D2 history, the Seahawks worked him out as a fullback, a common trend they’ve done in the past. He finished his career with an absurd 92.5 TFL and 56 sacks. Of the latter, 16 of those happened as a freshman. 15.5 more came as a senior.\n\n249. CIN – Matt Linehan/QB Idaho: Good coaching, big frame, and a tough player who had an underrated and successful college career for the Fightin’ Potatoes. And those were some” bad” to “meh” teams. A.J. McCarron won his grievance and became a Bill.\n\n250. PHI –Jonah Trinnaman/WR BYU: Potentially draftable based on his Pro Day workout alone. Crazy stuff. A 4.3 40, 40.5 inch vert, 12 foot broad at 5’10, 192 pounds. So not a pipsqueak either. Stash him on the practice squad for a year in a pretty crowded WR group. Eagles like taking vertical threats.\n\n251. LAC – Tristan Nickelson/OT Texas: Mountain of a man at 6’9, 305 pounds. JUCO transfer who spot started throughout his career and though he could easily fall out of the draft, it’s a weak class top to bottom so he’s worth taking the flier on.\n\n252. CIN – Ryan Nall/FB Oregon State: Calling him a fullback but he’s really more of a H-Back. Reminds me of a guy already on their roster, Ryan Hewitt. 165 carries, 27 receptions last year for the Beavers.\n\n253. CIN – Brandon Facyson/CB Virginia Tech: No such thing as too much corner depth in the NFL. 47 career starts with five interceptions, all of which curiously came as a freshman. 131 career tackles.\n\n254. ARI – Rico Gafford/CB Wyoming: End of the draft usually pops up some names most people don’t know. Gafford was one of those guys for me but he may have run one of the fastest 40s ever. Officially, he turned in a 4.22 but some timed him as fast as 4.19. It’s not all on paper either – he intercepted four passes as a senior.\n\n255. TB – Tegray Scales/ILB Indiana: Undersized, underweight, and slow is a bad combination. But he’s better in coverage than given credit for and will try to carve out a role on special teams first.\n\n256. ATL – Julian Taylor/DT Temple: Another value pick for this year’s edition of Mr. Irrelevant. Rose after a solid Pro Day workout, running in a sub five second 40 at 6’4, 294 pounds. Burst onto the scene with 11 TFL last season.\n\nUndrafted Free Agents\n\nArizona\n\nTroy Pelletier/WR Leigh\n\nAzeem Victor/ILB Washington\n\nFrank Ginda/LB San Jose State\n\nRod Taylor/OT Ole Miss\n\nTray Matthews/S Auburn\n\nVictor is a better player on tape than he tested. Matthews reminds me of Rudy Ford (going to the same school helped) while Taylor had a strong Combine and is a candidate to get drafted.\n\nAtlanta\n\nTyrone Crowder/OG Clemson\n\nSimmie Cobbs Jr/WR Indiana\n\nChris Covington/MLB Indiana\n\nRay Bolden/WR Stony Brook\n\nJoJo Wicker/DE Arizona State\n\nCrowder is a wide body but a sloppy one. Bolden didn’t run a fast time at his Pro Day but jumped 35 inches in the vert and 10’1” in the broad. Covington had 85 tackles, third on the Hoosiers last year.\n\nBaltimore\n\nJordan Brown/FS James Madison\n\nChris Warren III/RB Texas\n\nSam Jones/OG Arizona State\n\nDeion Pierre/LB Samford\n\nJordan Thomas/CB Oklahoma\n\nThomas may get drafted and had some of the craziest agility drills in Combine history (3.94 short shuttle, 6.28 three cone). Brown was an FCS All-American, a ballhawk as a senior with nine interceptions. Warren’s a big back.\n\nBuffalo\n\nJaMarcus King/CB South Carolina\n\nJamil Demby/OG Maine\n\nLowell Lotulelei/DT Utah\n\nSherman Badie/RB Tulane\n\nDamon Webb/SS Ohio State\n\nBuffalo showed interest in Demby at the Senior Bowl. Lotulelei follows big brother to Buffalo. King has size but woefully slow, causing him to fall out of the draft. Meanwhile, Badie was a sub 4.4 runner at his Pro Day.\n\nCarolina\n\nJeremiah Briscoe/QB Sam Houston State\n\nParry Nickerson/CB Tulane\n\nJustin Stockton/RB Texas Tech\n\nGarret Dickerson/FB Northwestern\n\nTavares Martin Jr./WR Washington State\n\nBriscoe put up monster numbers at the FCS level while Nickerson’s workout, including a 4.32 40, could get his name called on draft day. Martin was the opposite with horrendous numbers across the board and benefited from a pass-drunk system where the head coach never called a run play.\n\nChicago\n\nJonathan Peterson/OLB San Diego\n\nAndre Chachere/CB San Jose State\n\nEddy Pineiro/K Florida\n\nTyler Lancaster/NT Northwestern\n\nKamryn Pettway/RB Auburn\n\nPeterson, following the footsteps of Jamal Agnew, was one of the most impactful pass rushers in all of college football. 25 TFL, 18 sacks, seven forced fumbles in 2018. Lancaster put up 36 on the bar at his Pro Day. Pineiro could become the Bears starting kicker.\n\nCincinnati\n\nJ.C. Hassenauer /C Alabama\n\nJ.T. Barrett/QB Ohio State\n\nWill Geary/DT Kansas State\n\nShay Fields/WR Colorado\n\nKahlid Hagens/SS UT-Martin\n\nMore interior line help for the Bengals by bringing in Hassenauer. Barrett stays local while Geary is one of the shortest defensive linemen, under six foot tall.\n\nCleveland\n\nRyan Yurachek/HBack Marshall\n\nJohn Atkins/NT Georgia\n\nRonnie Scott/DB Alabama State\n\nDevin Gray/WR Cincinnati\n\nDewey Jarvis/OLB Brown\n\nAtkins is an interior plugger. Jarvis was a Senior Bowl invite while Scott ran in the 4.4’s and transferred from Florida Atlantic. Yurachek reminds me a bit of former Brown MarQueis Gray, minus the QB conversion.\n\nDallas\n\nQuinton Flowers/QB-WR-FS South Florida\n\nSharime Devin/OG Georgia Tech\n\nTyshon Dye/RB East Carolina\n\nDarion Clark/TE USC\n\nStephen Roberts/FS Auburn\n\nFlowers will likely convert to some other position, just as Isaiah Stanback and Jameill Showers have done for the Cowboys. Devin is one of the heaviest players in the draft at 380 pounds, so large the school had to remove the ceiling tiles to let him complete his vertical. Clark is a basketball player, a road this team traveled down with Rico Gathers, while Dye is a bit of a sleeper and transferred from Clemson.\n\nDenver\n\nBrogan Roback/QB Eastern Michigan\n\nJaleel Scott/WR Northern Illinois\n\nNick DeLuca/ILB North Dakota State\n\nKorey Cunningham/OT Cincinnati\n\nA.J. Moore/FS Ole Miss\n\nScott comes in at 6’6. DeLuca is a bit Todd Davis like, both in their small school background and style of play. Cunningham is a borderline draftable prospect.\n\nDetroit\n\nColeman Shelton/C Washington\n\nSam Mentkowski/WR UW Oshkosh\n\nDejuan Butler/DB Hawaii\n\nChris Lacy/WR Oklahoma State\n\nNate Wozniak/TE-OT Minnesota\n\nLacy is a good get off a solid junior season. Wozniak will likely try to convert to OT at over 6’9. The Lions have Dan Skipper, who towers over everyone the same way. Mentkowski had a breakout 2017, averaging an absurd 22 yards per catch and 13 touchdowns.\n\nGreen Bay\n\nTaron Johnson/CB Weber State\n\nGarrett Dooley/OLB Wisconsin\n\nVirnel Moon/WR Colorado Mesa\n\nWill House/OG South Nazarene\n\nMatt Bayliss/LS UTSA\n\nJohnson had a good week in Mobile and I like his aggressive mindset. Dooley stays local as a technical pass rusher with limited upside. House has gotten some buzz while Bayliss has rare size and length for a long snapper.\n\nHouston\n\nVyncint Smith/WR Limestone\n\nTony Adams/OG NC State\n\nBoston Scott/RB Louisiana Tech\n\nGarrett Hudson/TE Richmond\n\nChandon Sullivan/CB San Jose State\n\nNot a ton of “known” names here; Sullivan might lead the pack in that regard. Smith has drawn interest from several times after a solid 2017. Scott ran a 4.4 flat at his Pro Day with a 38.5 inch vert and 6.67 three cone. Averaged close to six yards per carry as Tech continues to churn out excellent athletes. On paper, anyway.\n\nIndianapolis\n\nBrad Lundblade/C Oklahoma State\n\nMcKay Murphy/DE Weber State\n\nD’Montre Wade/CB Murray State\n\nLogan Woodside/QB Toledo\n\nJanarion Grant/WR Rutgers\n\nMurphy had a strong Pro Day workout despite being sick and losing five pounds before performing for scouts. The Colts have shown interest. Wade is someone who may get drafted. Grant was a dynamic return man with five KR touchdowns and another three on punts.\n\nJacksonville\n\nLuis Perez/QB Texas A&M Commerce\n\nLevi Wallace/CB Alabama\n\nTimon Harris/OT Stony Brook\n\nSharif Finch/DE Temple\n\nGus Edwards/RB Rutgers\n\nPerez has gotten plenty of buzz as a sought after UDFA. Wallace struggled at the Senior Bowl and Harris is a sleeper. Finch quietly recorded 8.5 sacks for the Owls in 2017.\n\nKansas City\n\nNick Bawden/FB San Diego State\n\nJacob Pugh/OLB Florida State\n\nNick Gates/OT Nebraska\n\nSteven Mitchell/WR USC\n\nChris Cooper/S Stony Brook\n\nBawden has a little bit of juice at fullback. Mitchell ran an electronically timed 4.43 40 at his Pro Day. Cooper was a two-year starter with 88 tackles, 12.5 for a loss as a senior.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nMike Love/OLB South Florida\n\nJaryd Jones-Smith/OT Pittsburgh\n\nJavon Wims/WR Georgia\n\nIshmail Wainwright/TE Baylor\n\nAndre Smith/ILB North Carolina\n\nWims is a solid prospect. Wainwright is following Rico Geathers as a basketball player turned tight end. Love had five sacks a year ago, jumping 35 inches in the vert and 10’1” in the broad at his Pro Day workout.\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nNick Keizer/TE Grand Valley State\n\nKenny Young/OLB UCLA\n\nDarren Carrington II/WR Utah\n\nJake Wienke/WR South Dakota State\n\nDonovan Olumba/CB Portland State\n\nWienke sort of reminds me of Cooper Kupp. Young had a steady, productive career. Carrington’s near 4.8 40 time really hurts him, though he tested well pretty much everywhere else.\n\nMiami\n\nAuden Tate/WR Florida State\n\nTaylor Hearn/OG Clemson\n\nRoc Thomas/RB Jacksonville State\n\nAfolabi Laguda/S Colorado\n\nRussell Gage Jr./WR LSU\n\nTate’s poor workout pushes him out of the draft. Gage is a special teams ace, similar to former LSU Tiger James Wright, drafted by the Bengals a few years ago. Thomas transferred to JSU from Auburn.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLarry Rose III/RB New Mexico State\n\nJason Cabinda/ILB Penn State\n\nJoseph Davidson/P Bowling Green\n\nDanny Etling/QB LSU\n\nNick Orr/FS TCU\n\nRose had a tremendous sophomore season, rushing for over 1600 yards but he has a lot of mileage on him. Etling was a forgottable college QB. Davidson is 6’7…and he’s a punter.\n\nNew Orleans\n\nMatt Oplinger/LB Yale\n\nChristian LaCouture/DE LSU\n\nJordan Lasley/WR UCLA\n\nEmmanuel Moseley/CB Tennessee\n\nKC McDermott/OT Miami (FL)\n\nThe Saints showed interest in Oplinger in the Pro Day process. LaCouture is run stuffer while Moseley posted fantastic workout numbers (4.42, 38 vert, 10’6” broad, 6.84 three cone). Lasley could get drafted.\n\nNew England\n\nPhillip Lindsay/RB Colorado\n\nPeter Kalambayi/OLB Stanford\n\nSebastian Joseph/DT Rutgers\n\nJK Scott/P Alabama\n\nBrett Toth/OT Army\n\nLindsay is a scat back after losing Dion Lewis. When it comes to Belichick, you gotta take someone from Rutgers, as is law. New England drafted Navy LS Joe Cardona a couple years ago so any service obligations Toth might have shouldn’t bother them.\n\nNew York Giants\n\nRyan Smith/TE Miami (OH)\n\nKeishawn Bierria/OLB Washington\n\nGriffin Oakes/K Indiana\n\nCameron Roane/CB Columbia\n\nSaeed Blacknall/WR Penn State\n\nSmith is regarded as a plus blocker while Roane ran in the low 4.4’s at his workout. Blacknall was little-used in college but has great triangle numbers and produced a couple big plays in Happy Valley.\n\nNew York Jets\n\nTrenton Cannon/RB Virginia State\n\nJohn Franklin-Meyer/DE Stephen F. Austin\n\nTre Flowers/SS Oklahoma State\n\nOlasunkanmi Adeniyi/OLB Toledo\n\nIan Park/OG Slippery Rock\n\nCannon rushed for over 1600 yards in 2017, including a pair of 200+ rushing yard performances. 4.4 flat at his Pro Day weighing in at 5’10, 185. Flowers is a jack-of-all-trades safety but a poor athlete while Adeniyi brings some intrigue off the edge.\n\nOakland\n\nMartez Carter/RB Grambling\n\nKhalil McKenzie Jr./DT Tennessee\n\nRyan Neal/FS Southern Illinois\n\nMax Browne/QB Pitt\n\nUlrich Jones/DT-OT South Carolina\n\nYou know McKenzie Jr. is going to play for Oakland. Tom Cable, true to form, will try to move Jones to the offensive line. He blocked two field goals in his career. Browne never worked out at Pitt.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nIto Smith/RB Southern Miss\n\nAndrew Vollert/TE Weber State\n\nSean Chandler/FS Temple\n\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling/WR USF\n\nNic Shimonek/QB Texas Tech\n\nSmith reminds me of Donnel Pumphrey, a pint size back without much return experience (but needs to stick there). Valdes-Scantling ran a 4.37 40 at his Pro Day, though his other testing wasn’t as impressive. Vollert had a good workout.\n\nPittsburgh\n\nCurtis Cothran/DE Penn State\n\nAndy Smigiera/DB Robert Morris\n\nBraxton Berrios/WR Miami (FL)\n\nJaleel Wadood/S UCLA\n\nDanny Johnson/CB Southern\n\nPittsburgh brought Cothran in for a visit. He’ll play 5T/4Iifor them. Berrios is a tough return man while Johnson is a twitchy corner, a great story, and reminds me of Mike Hilton. Smigiera was invited by the Steelers to a local Pro Day and Tom Bradley coached Wadood at UCLA last season.\n\nSeattle\n\nRobert Foster/WR Alabama\n\nDavin Bellamy/DE Georgia\n\nKeion Crossen/CB Western Carolina\n\nFoyesade Oluokun/OLB Yale\n\nEvan Brown/C SMU\n\nFoster is a solid receiver and Bellamy has a good chance to get drafted – calling him a UDFA is proabably too low. Crossen racked up 67 tackles for the Catamounts a year ago.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nDe’Lance Turner/RB Alcorn State\n\nJeremy Reaves/DB South Alabama\n\nGreg Gilmore/DE LSU\n\nMax Redfield/SS IUP\n\nMarcus Baugh/TE Ohio State\n\nTurner broke out in 2017, averaging an absurd 7.5 yards per carry and found the end zone a total of 13 times. Reaves is a versatile DB while Redfield was held back by injury and a rainy Pro Day, hurting his numbers. He began his career at Notre Dame.\n\nTampa Bay\n\nDarrel Williams/RB LSU\n\nDonnie Ernsberger/HBack Western Michigan\n\nKorey Robertson/WR Southern Miss\n\nNate Andrews/S Florida State\n\nNaashon Hughes/DE Texas\n\nWilliams is a big back but shows smooth hands out of the backfield. Ernsberger reminds me of a bigger Alan Cross. Hughes has 12.5 career sacks on his resume.\n\nTennessee\n\nJordan Wilkins/RB Ole Miss\n\nJohn David Moore/FB LSU\n\nZach Sieler/DE Ferris State\n\nJeff Badet/WR Oklahoma\n\nMike Ford/CB Southeast Missouri State\n\nWilkins is a big back and David Moore a burling lead blocker. Badet had a strong workout; ditto Sieler, who is rising up boards and has an outside shot to be selected in the top 256.\n\nWashington\n\nKeith Kirkwood/WR Temple\n\nDavid Wells/TE San Jose State\n\nChad Thomas/DE Miami (FL)\n\nJordan Mailata/OT South Sydney\n\nTre’ Williams/ILB Auburn\n\nWilliams is a two down thumper while Washington was one of the teams Mailata, a rugby star trying to pick up football, set up a pre-draft visit with. Kirkwood bounced between Hawaii and Temple, catching 45 passes and seven touchdowns last year for the Owls."
