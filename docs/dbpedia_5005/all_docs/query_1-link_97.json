        "text": "25. Brad Roberts, Air Force\n\n24. Xazavian Valladay, Arizona State\n\nRoberts rushed for a team-high 1,357 yards and 13 touchdowns on nearly 300 carries as a dependable, every-down option for the Falcons. ... Herm Edwards and Arizona State will lean on Valladay, a graduate transfer from Wyoming who has rushed for 3,274 yards and 19 touchdowns during his career including 1,000-yard plus campaigns during the 2019 and 2021 seasons. He is the second notable playmaker from Wyoming to leave this offseason, joining leading wideout Isaiah Neyor, who entered the portal and ended up signing with Texas.\n\n23. Keaton Mitchell, East Carolina\n\n22. DeWayne McBride, UAB\n\nTwo more ballcarriers from the Group of Five ranks, Mitchell and McBride are the key cogs for their respective teams, each coming off breakout campaigns last fall. Mitchell led the Pirates to bowl eligibility for the first time in years with 1,132 yards and nine touchdowns, also adding 11.5 yards per reception out of the backfield. Mitchell is a big baseball fan, too. ... After averaging 9.3 yards per carry as a freshman in 2020 on limited totes, McBride handled RB1 duties for the Blazers last season and exploded as a result, rushing for 1,371 yards and 13 scores.\n\n21. Kendall Milton, Georgia\n\n20. Will Shipley, Clemson\n\nWith Zamir White and James Cook off to the NFL, the floodgates have opened for Milton to take full advantage with the lion's share of carries for the Georgia Bulldogs this season. Kenny McIntosh may have something to say about that, too. A former top-60 recruit, per the 247Sports Composite, Milton is \"hungry\" for his chance to shine in the Bulldogs' rushing attack. ... As a five-star freshman last fall, Shipley rushed for 739 yards and 11 touchdowns behind an underperforming Clemson front. At times, he was the only offense for the Tigers, who failed in their quest to return to the College Football Playoff.\n\n19. Chase Brown, Illinois\n\n18. Mohamed Ibrahim, Minnesota\n\nThis freakish pair from the Big Ten know how to move the sticks when their numbers are called. Despite facing stacked boxes throughout his redshirt junior season, Brown rushed for 1,005 yards and was Mr. Reliable for the Illini. ... Ibrahim is back for another go-around with the Golden Gophers after suffering a season-ending injury in September last fall. He has two 1,000-yard seasons to his credit, and rushed for 163 yards and two scores during last season's near upset of Ohio State in the opener. He is the front-runner to win the Big Ten's comeback player of the year.\n\n17. Travis Dye, USC\n\n16. Eric Gray, Oklahoma\n\nDye earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention recognition last season at Oregon after rushing for 1,271 yards and 16 touchdowns on 211 carries, while adding 46 receptions for 402 yards and two more scores. He transferred to USC this spring, and gives Lincoln Riley a workhorse option in the backfield. ... Gray found new energy at Oklahoma last season after playing two years at Tennessee as one of the Volunteers' featured options. He averaged a career-best 5.3 yards per attempt in 13 appearances last season with the Sooners, and made 23 catches for 229 yards and two touchdowns. Small in stature at 5-foot-9, Gray still packs a punch and runs behind his pads.\n\nRasheen Ali was Marshall's best player as a redshirt freshman, bulldozing his way to 1,401 yards and a jaw-dropping 23 scores. He didn't fumble all season, despite the heavy workload, and was nearly unstoppable in Marshall's stacked Pistol look. At 6-foot, 200 pounds, Ali runs slender — almost like a wide receiver en route to the second level. A freshman All-American in 2021, Ali should put up big numbers once again if Marshall's offensive line performs as expected.\n\nOne of the reasons we've projected Utah to reach the College Football Playoff this season is due to the return of Tavion Thomas as one of the Pac-12's top players. Thomas rushed for 1,108 yards and 21 touchdowns during his first campaign with the Utes in 2021 after two years under Luke Fickell at Cincinnati. He knows the expectations are high once again as potentially the Pac-12's rushing leader in 2022. Utah opens at Florida and has several spotlight games on the docket.\n\n“There ain’t no pressure…pressure bust pipes,” Thomas said after spring practice. “There ain’t no pressure to it, I’m just ready to work. I know how good we all can be as a team. I’m ready, I’m trying to be a leader and pick up the team and have us work.”\n\nThat's right — Lew Nichols led college football in rushing last season. He earned the MAC's Offensive Player of the Year honor after rushing for 1,848 yards and 16 rushing touchdowns, to go along with 40 receptions for 338 yards receiving. Central Michigan made sure to get his hands on the football as often as possible. He might not be as quick or dynamic as a few of the guys ahead of them, but there's something to be said about running to daylight and when Nichols hits the hole, he is rarely brought down by the first tackler.\n\nUCLA coach Chip Kelly knew he signed a special player when Zach Charbonnet landed with the Bruins after leaving Michigan ahead of the 2021 season, and his first season in the Pac-12 did not disappoint. Charbonnet notched 1,137 yards and 13 touchdowns, giving UCLA a formidable ballcarrier in the ground game. He'll be a 2023 NFL Draft selection if he manages to post another campaign of equal success and the Bruins could be playing the spoiler role out West against the likes or heavyweights Utah, USC and Oregon in the conference.\n\nAs a sophomore in 2021 at TCU, Zach Evans managed 648 yards rushing and five touchdowns. His numbers should pop as one of the focal points of a transfer-rich Ole Miss offense that will include several new starters coming off the program's first 10-win regular season under coach Lane Kiffin. Evans was a five-star recruit in the Class of 2020, according to the industry-generated 247Sports Composite. The 247Sports Composite considered Evans to be the No. 16 overall prospect, No. 2 running back and No. 1 player in Texas for the 2020 cycle. With enough touches, Evans should exceed 1,000 yards of total offense this fall as a speed threat for the Rebels.\n\nNearly a transfer portal casualty this offseason for Auburn, elite ballcarrier Tank Bigsby was convinced to stay by running backs coach Cadillac Williams and others. As a sophomore, Bigsby carried the ball for 1,099 yards and 10 touchdowns. He averaged 4.9 yards per rush and caught 21 passes for 184 yards. He rushed for 403 yards and four scores through Auburn's first four games, before the SEC gauntlet began. As a freshman in 2020, Bigsby tallied 834 yards on the ground with four 100-yard games against league competition.\n\nOne of America's fastest players at his position, Devon Achane will get more touches for the Aggies following the exit of Isaiah Spiller to the NFL — which means more opportunity for explosive players. He's been a dynamic threat on Texas A&M's track team this spring and brings similar blaze to the gridiron as a multi-position headache for opposing defenses. Achane galloped his way to 910 yards and nine touchdowns as a sophomore, averaging 7 yards per carry. Over his first two years in College Station, he has also registered 29 total receptions for a 12.3 yards per catch average.\n\nOne of five Alabama transfers this cycle rated in the final top 50, according to 247Sports, Jahmyr Gibbs is the headliner. Gibbs first stepped on campus during prep for the College Football Playoff last season, and made an instant impression on his new teammates and coaching staff as a player with a different gear out of the backfield. The Dalton, Georgia, native arrived in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, after spending the last two years at Georgia Tech, where he contributed 2,773 all-purpose yards and 14 touchdowns on 323 plays (8.6 yards per play). As a sophomore this past season, he rushed for 746 yards and four touchdowns on 143 attempts.\n\nOne of the top returning players in the SEC, Chris Rodriguez rushed for 1,371 yards — 12th nationally — and 10 touchdowns last season, averaging better than six yards per carry for the second consecutive campaign. His status for the 2022 campaign remains up in the air according to insiders due to off-the-field issues. Rodriguez enjoyed a breakout season as a sophomore in 2020, rushing for 785 yards in just nine games and 11 touchdowns on just 119 carries. Despite missing two games that season, Rodriguez ranked sixth in the SEC in rushing yards and 17th nationally and first in the SEC in yards per carry (6.6). Rodriguez, who scored on runs of 79 and 74 yards that season, was one of just five SEC backs with double-digit rushing scores.\n\nThere might not be a player for a team ranked inside college football's preseason top 25 that means more to his squad's success in 2022 than Blake Corum. According to PFF's advanced stats, Corum registered 553 yards after contact last season, which ranks near the top of college football. Corum was one of only four Power Five running backs with at least 100 carries who averaged at least 6.5 yards per attempt, a notable statistic given Michigan's reliance on his production alongside Hassan Haskins in a two-headed attack.\n\nPer 247Sports' Stephen Bailey, Sean Tucker earned Syracuse's starting job four games into his true freshman season in 2020 and the rest is history. The 5-foot-10, 209-pound wrecking ball finished fourth nationally last season with 1,496 yards rushing — numbers that eclipsed Joe Morris' single-season record at Syracuse in the team's 11th game of the season. Tucker broke another program record with seven straight 100-yard performances. He also recorded 12 rushing touchdowns to go along with 20 receptions, 255 receiving yards and another two scores as a pass-catching option.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch Kansas State games this season. If not, you're missing out with one of the nation's most electrifying athletes. Defenses were supposed to do a better job bottling up the Wildcats' 5-6, 170-pound weapon as a sophomore given his freshman film, but it didn't happen, as Deuce Vaughn accumulated 1,872 yards from scrimmage and 22 touchdowns. His 1,404 yards rushing were mesmerizing weekly, highlighted by several long touchdowns. He averages nearly 6 yards per carry in his career.\n\nBraelon Allen is one of two Wisconsin running backs capable of 1,000 yards this season, but senior Chez Mellusi didn't quite make this top 25. Much like Jonathan Taylor and other star Badgers in the backfield before him, Allen has a chance to win the Doak Walker as college football's potential leading rusher. Allen, who played the entire 2021 season as a 17-year-old, rushed for 1,268 yards and 12 touchdowns last year, while averaging a Big Ten-best 6.8 yards per attempt. Good luck catching him from behind in the open field or making a 1-on-1 tackle on the outside.\n\nOnly at Ohio State can you tally a program record 19 touchdowns as a true freshman and be the third-most talked about player on offense entering the 2022 season behind C.J. Stroud and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. TreVeyon Henderson was unstoppable as a five-star, first-year player last year, rushing for 1,248 yards (6.8 yards per carry) and 15 scores. He added 27 receptions for 312 yards (11.6 yards per catch) and four additional touchdowns. There's a reason Henderson was the 247Sports Composite's No. 1-ranked running back in the Class of 2021, and he showed early why scouting comparisons to Christian McCaffrey held water.\n\nDespite not playing a full season last fall, Bijan Robinson wrapped up his sophomore campaign as the Longhorns' leading rusher with 1,127 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns over 10 games. Robinson finished third on the team with 295 receiving yards (11.4 yards per catch) and four receiving scores. Robinson hopes to return to 2020 form after averaging 8.2 yards per carry as the nation's breakout freshman ballcarrier. He's a preseason Heisman Trophy candidate in 2022 and a primary factor in how the Big 12 Championship picture will shake out."
