        "text": "COLUMBUS — Week 2 is in the books and Ohio has proven yet again to be a football state.\n\nLet’s check out some of the top performances from all around the Buckeye State with this week’s Ohio Prep Sportswriters Association High School Football Notebook.\n\n*Ashland Crestview’s Liam Kuhn threw for 205 yards and three touchdowns as the Cougars beat East Knox 20-14 giving him his first win as a varsity quarterback. Kuhn’s two older brothers were QBs at Crestview before he took the helm this year.\n\n*Ontario’s Bodpegn Miller threw for 154 yards on just 10 completions with a touchdown and also ran for one more during the Warriors’ 35-0 win over Centerburg. Through two games this year, Miller has already thrown for 351 yards and is competing 60% of his passes.\n\n*Mansfield Senior’s Nate Dismuke made his first start at quarterback since the 8th grade and didn’t disappoint. He completed 6-of-11 passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns in the Tygers’ 24-14 win over defending Division III state champ Canfield.\n\n*Shelby’s Issaiah Ramsey piled up 202 receiving yards and three touchdowns to lead the Whippets to a 50-19 win over Lexington. The Whippets now have 91 points through the team’s first two games and Ramsey is a key reason why.\n\n* Buckeye Central scored a school record for points in a 67-0 home shutout over Fremont St. Joseph.

The Bucks had 482 yards of total offense and limited SJCC to -2 yards overall.\n\n* Wynford’s Anthony Evans rushed 16 times for 172 yards and two touchdowns in the Royals’ gutsy 22-20 win over Pleasant, he accounted for 61% of the team’s offense.\n\n* Colonel Crawford’s Micah Thomas carried the ball 10 times for 122 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles’ 57-13 win over Cardinal Stritch.\n\n* Nelsonville-York’s Gavin Richards made 12 tackles, two tackles for loss and two pass breakups, forced a fumble and had one interception on defense, and rushed for 93 yards and two touchdowns on 18 carries on offense, in the Buckeyes’ 21-9 victory over Newark Catholic on Friday night.\n\n* The Coal Grove Hornets allowed Lucasville Valley to return the opening kickoff for a touchdown on Saturday, then answered with the game’s final 52 points in a matter of 33 minutes —en route to a 52-6 victory.

Terry first caught a 77-yard first-quarter touchdown pass, then rushed for two fourth quarter touchdowns of 51 and 52 yards.

The last non-conference home loss for Coldwater was to Kenton in 2013.\n\n* Michael Farrell, junior quarterback at Bay High School (Bay Village, Cuyahoga County) specializes in two of a kind. In Bay's opening win he threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions. This past Friday he threw two touchdown passes and lost two fumbles in a win over Field. It would seem that a pair of two-point conversions and two-point safeties are in his future.\n\n* Cleveland Villa Angela-St. Joseph put a damper on Youngstown Cardinal Mooney's celebration of its 1973 Class AAA state championship team.
