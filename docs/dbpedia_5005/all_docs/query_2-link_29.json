        "text": "The best one was the first one.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe best one was the first one.\n\nOn Sept. 29, 1962, the Toronto Argonauts made their first appearance at Taylor Field during a CFL regular-season game — one year after interlocking play had been introduced. The teams had met in Toronto the previous year.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n10 memorable visits by the Toronto Argonauts Back to video\n\nMore than a half-century later, it is difficult to find an Argonauts game in Regina that was ultimately as entertaining as the landmark contest of 1962.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Regina Leader-Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Regina Leader-Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nOn the strength of three fourth-quarter touchdowns, the Roughriders overcame a shaky start and won 21-17 in front of 11,758 spectators.\n\n“The Roughriders atoned for a listless offensive display in the first three quarters,” Hank Johnson wrote in the Regina Leader-Post.\n\n“Supporters looked on with dismay as the Riders floundered around hopelessly in the first half,” Johnson continued, “and rain, which started to come down in the third quarter, added to the discomfort of those assembled.”\n\nBut “all was forgiven,” in the words of Johnson, thanks to a stirring rally led by quarterback Bob Ptacek.\n\nA 60-yard pass-and-run collaboration between Ptacek and Ray Purdin set up a two-yard touchdown run by Bill Gray early in the fourth quarter. Four minutes later, Ptacek found Ferd Burket for a 27-yard touchdown pass and the Riders were ahead, 14-11.\n\nToronto stormed back with a touchdown to restore its lead, setting the stage for a scintillating finish.\n\nWith just under two minutes left in the game, the Roughriders assumed possession on their 16-yard line. Following an incompletion, Ptacek found Jack Gotta for a 14-yarder. Ptacek then looked for Purdin, who caught the ball on Saskatchewan’s 50-yard line, eluded a would-be tackler, and sped to the end zone to complete an 80-yard play. He crossed the goal line with 57 seconds remaining for what proved to be the game-winning touchdown.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The joy of the fans was unconfined,” Johnson concluded.\n\nThe remainder of the top 10 Toronto-at-Saskatchewan games is as follows:\n\n2. Aug. 9, 1991: The Roughriders lost, 37-35, but John Candy won the day.\n\nCandy, a Hollywood actor and a co-owner of the Argos along with Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky, watched the game from the sideline — with frequent pauses to affably sign autographs for a procession of fans.\n\nAlso on display was former Notre Dame Fighting Irish star Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, who had been wooed away from the NFL by a four-year, $18.2-million contract. Ismail, who would help the Argos win the 1991 Grey Cup, caught seven passes for 146 yards in his Taylor Field debut.\n\nSaskatchewan was outscored 12-0 in the third quarter before producing the game’s final 16 points.\n\nIt wasn’t enough, but it was still a good show.\n\n3. July 4, 1987: As in 1991, there was a sideshow — in the form of professional wrestling.\n\nBefore the game, the stars of the World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) appeared on Taylor Field.\n\nOnce the football game began, the Roughriders’ offence was barely noticeable until early in the fourth quarter.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTom Burgess, replacing ineffective rookie Jeff Bentrim at quarterback, rallied Saskatchewan from a 26-9 deficit by guiding the Green and White to 17 consecutive points and forcing overtime.\n\nToronto scored a converted touchdown in the first overtime period. In the second five-minute stanza, Burgess found Troy Armstrong for a 12-yard touchdown pass. Dave Ridgway’s convert tied the game at 33-33 and ultimately concluded the scoring.\n\n4. Oct. 28, 1990: Ridgway was the hero, nailing a 47-yard field goal as time expired to give Saskatchewan a 33-31 victory over Toronto.\n\nToronto had assumed a 31-30 lead before Kent Austin marched the Roughriders into field-goal range in the final minute. A third-down completion from Austin to Ray Elgaard put Saskatchewan in range for Robokicker’s decisive field goal.\n\n5. July 5, 2015: Led by quarterback Trevor Harris, the Argonauts posted a 42-40, double-overtime victory on Taylor Field.\n\nToronto forced overtime when Harris found Chad Owens for a 16-yard touchdown pass on the final offensive play of regulation time. The convert created a 28-28 tie and forced overtime.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBoth teams scored a touchdown on each of their two overtime possessions. The final touchdown was scored by Chris Getzlaf, who caught a 25-yard scoring pass from Kevin Glenn. However, Glenn misfired on a pass to Getzlaf that, if successful, would have produced a game-tying two-point conversion.\n\n6. July 12, 1997: As it turned out, Saskatchewan was one of only three teams to defeat the 1997 Argonauts, who won 15 regular-season games.\n\nSaskatchewan trailed 23-13 midway through the fourth quarter before scoring back-to-back touchdowns — courtesy of a 69-yard scoring bomb from Reggie Slack to Curtis Mayfield and a three-yard run by Robert Mimbs. The latter major, which came with 38 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, provided the winning points as the Riders prevailed 27-23.\n\nThe Doug Flutie-quarterbacked Argonauts got the last laugh, though, defeating Saskatchewan 47-23 in the 1997 Grey Cup game.\n\n7. Aug. 26, 1988: The Roughriders squandered a 17-0 halftime lead after head coach John Gregory switched quarterbacks, replacing Austin with Burgess to begin the third quarter.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBurgess proceeded to throw two interceptions within a span of six plays. Toronto turned the picks into two touchdowns and ended up winning 23-21.\n\n“I will take 100-per-cent credit for the loss,” Gregory said afterwards. “So crucify me.”\n\n8. Oct. 15, 1989: The Roughriders won 24-18, scoring the go-ahead touchdown midway through the fourth quarter when Austin found Jeff Fairholm for a 12-yard TD pass.\n\nThe rest of the final frame was suspense-filled until 49 seconds remained, when Bobby Jurasin sacked Argos quarterback John Congemi on third down.\n\n9. Aug. 28, 1978: After an 0-6 start that cost head coach Jim Eddy his job, the Roughriders finally broke the ice against Toronto, winning 31-10 in Walt Posadowski’s debut as a CFL field boss.\n\nThe Roughriders’ top performer on the day was Bob Macoritti, who kicked seven field goals to set a since-eclipsed CFL single-game record.\n\n10. Oct. 10, 2009: Leading up to the game, Roughriders head coach Ken Miller told the media that he was open to using backup quarterback Steven Jyles if starter Darian Durant did not perform.\n\nDurant performed. He threw three first-half touchdown passes to power Saskatchewan to a 32-22 victory.\n\nIt was a costly victory, though, as diminutive slotback Weston Dressler was lost for the season with a fractured right fibula.\n\n“They may only be Size 9s,” one observer said after the game, “but those are awfully big shoes to fill.”\n\nrvanstone@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/robvanstone\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
