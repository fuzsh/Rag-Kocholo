        "text": "Jul 18, 2024 | 7:58 AM\n\nMiles Brown knows versatility is a strength when it comes to pro football.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Roughriders defensive lineman had to change jerseys and play offensive guard near the end of the CFL club’s 35-20 loss to the B.C. Lions after Trevor Reid left the game late. Offensive tackle Jermarcus Hardrick had left the game earlier with what turned into a long-term quad injury.\n\n“It was a little unexpected but I’m fortunate – it’s unfortunate – but fortunate enough to be the guy and an opportunity to show that I am versatile and available,” the 26-year-old Cheverly, Md. product said. “Take it as it is and keep going.”\n\nSo, when he got told to switch from his #90 jersey to #69 to be eligible to be on the offensive line, he was ready.\n\n“When there’s a job to do, you have to do it,” Brown said. “It was my time to be called to do the job.”\n\nSo how did Brown feel he did when he had to drop back into pass protection?\n\n“I think I did well,” Brown said. “I put the mitts on the guy as best I could and kept him from getting a sack.”\n\nHe said that, as a defensive lineman, it can pay off to know how the offensive linemen think and attack each play.\n\n“I think in training, it’s good for us to know how to block, how we’re being blocked, know how to defeat blocks. I think when we are training sometimes, I get some work at offensive line, but not a lot of practice or a lot of detailed work at the position,” Brown said.\n\nThe last time he played the position with some regularity was when he was a member of the Tennessee Titans in 2020 and was a practice squad offensive lineman.\n\n“That’s where I got all my skills at,” Brown said.\n\nIn high school, Brown was also used at the running back position.\n\n“It’s good to be versatile,” He said.\n\nBut Brown will look to make a big impact on the defensive side of the ball as the Riders take on the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on Friday at Mosaic Stadium. Kickoff for the game is set for 7:30 p.m.\n\nBrown has dressed for three of the team’s five games so far, but is expected to see his playing time increase due to injuries to defensive lineman Charbel Dabire and defensive end Christian Albright.\n\n“I’m excited to really get into a good rhythm and really get rolling,” Brown said.\n\nThe defensive line will try to stop last year’s most outstanding Canadian in Winnipeg, running back Brady Oliveira, who is coming off of back-to-back games with over 100 yards rushing — it’s the first time he’s accomplished that feat in his career.\n\nThe Riders have been the CFL’s best when it comes to stopping the run so far, only giving up 47.4 yards per game.\n\n“Our job is to be gap sound. When the ball is on the ground, tackle the ball (carrier) in under two yards,” Brown said. “That’s the plan.”\n\n—"
