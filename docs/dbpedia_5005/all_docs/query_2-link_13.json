        "text": "Along with a new quarterback comes a new set of weapons and a revamped offensive line to try and get the Riders back into the playoffs.\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Zerrick Cooper, Jake Dolegala, Mason Fine, Trevor Harris, Levi Lewis, Shea Patterson\n\nThe Riders have a new starting pivot for the 2023 season. After ownership issues muddied the waters in Montreal, Harris signed with the Riders early in the negotiation window.\n\nHarris, 36, is entering his 11th CFL season and has thrown for 28,610 yards, 154 touchdowns and 71 interceptions in his career.\n\nThe signing of Harris marked the end of Fajardo’s time in Saskatchewan. While Fajardo was named the West Division’s most outstanding player in 2019, his production has dipped since then.\n\nLast season, Fajardo threw for 3,360 yards, 16 touchdowns and 13 interceptions before being relegated to the backup role for the final two games of the season.\n\nFine was the primary backup last season and was the team’s starter for the final two games. He threw for 364 yards and one touchdown in those two starts.\n\nDolegala appeared in two games for the Riders, both times as illness ravaged the team. He was the starter against the Toronto Argonauts in Week 7 as the team dealt with a COVID outbreak. He threw for 131 yards, a touchdown and an interception in that game.\n\nA stomach flu swept through the Riders’ locker room for the Banjo Bowl, which led to Dolegala being the backup in that game.\n\nLewis is back after joining the team partway through last season, spending the last part of the year on the practice roster. Patterson had a stint with Montreal in 2021.\n\nRunning backs\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Albert Awachie, Thomas Bertrand-Hudon, B.J. Emmons, Javian Hawkins, Frankie Hickson, Jace Jordan, Kienan LaFrance, Bruno Labelle, Jamal Morrow, Morgan Runge, Rodney Smith\n\nThe Riders have their 1-2 punch at running back, but depth will be something the team is after this season.\n\nThe running back room was ravaged with injuries late in the season with Morrow, Hickson, and LaFrance all injured at the same.\n\nMorrow is set to return as the team’s primary back. In 12 games of action last season, he had 666 yards and three touchdowns on the ground while adding 366 yards and a touchdown when thrown the ball.\n\nHickson, who was the Riders’ most outstanding rookie last season, had 533 yards and a touchdown on the ground in 13 games.\n\nLaFrance is back as the Riders’ veteran in the backfield. The Winnipeg product is entering his 10th season and fifth with Saskatchewan.\n\nLaFrance, who suffered a knee injury in 2022, dressed for 11 games, recording 39 yards on the ground and 28 yards through the air.\n\nAwachie and LaBelle are listed as the team’s primary fullbacks. Awachie appeared in 17 games in 2022, mostly used as a blocker. LaBelle saw action in 15 games last season as well, recording one catch for 18 yards.\n\nBertrand-Hudon was the Riders’ fourth-round (30th overall) pick in the 2023 CFL draft. The Quebec product spent four seasons at Delaware State, registering 239 carries for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nWide receivers\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Shawn Bane Jr., James Basalyga, Juwan Brescacin, Keith Corbin III, Sam Emilus, Jake Herslow, Tevin Jones, Brayden Lenius, Kalija Lipscomb, Jake Parker, Mitch Picton, Kian Schaffer-Baker, Tabashi Thomas, Derel Walker, Kendall Watson, Jester Weah, Jake Wieneke\n\nThe receiving corps is seeing a number of changes heading into 2023. Gone are Shaq Evans (Ottawa Redblacks), Duke Williams (Hamilton Tiger-Cats) and Kyran Moore (Edmonton Elks).\n\nBrought in during free agency to replace those three Americans were Bane Jr., Walker, and Wieneke.\n\nWieneke joined Harris in leaving Montreal due to ownership uncertainty. The 28-year-old spent three seasons in Montreal, amassing 2,056 yards and 21 touchdowns – with 11 of those majors coming in 2021.\n\nBane Jr. is a 27-year-old speedster who spent the past two seasons with the Calgary Stampeders. He had 288 yards and a touchdown in nine games last season.\n\nWalker is entering his eighth CFL season with 6,653 receiving yards and 33 touchdowns to his name. His best season came in 2016 with Edmonton, where he recorded 1,589 yards and 10 touchdowns. Walker was the Elks’ leading receiver last year with 894 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nJones and Weah return for their second seasons with the Green and White.\n\nJones dressed for 14 games last season, hauling in 20 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns. Weah was at Riders’ training camp in 2022, but was released and then re-signed in July. He only dressed for two games, hauling in two passes for nine yards.\n\nThe Canadian receiver room will have a lot of competition this season as well.\n\nJustin McInnis left to join the B.C. Lions in the off-season and last year’s leading receiver, Schaffer-Baker, could miss the first half of the season after undergoing hip surgery.\n\nSchaffer-Baker had 960 yards and five touchdowns for the Riders’ struggling aerial attack in 2022.\n\nBrayden Lenius is expected to be one of the team’s starters this season. After recording 471 yards and four touchdowns in 2021, the Regina product signed with the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. He was released following training camp and rejoined the Riders in August. In seven games, Lenius had 172 yards and a touchdown.\n\nSaskatchewan signed Brescacin in free agency. The Mississauga product is entering his seventh CFL season – four with the Stamps and two with Toronto. While he only compiled 97 yards and two touchdowns the past two seasons with Toronto, he recorded 567 yards and three touchdowns with the Stamps in 2018.\n\nEmilus returns for his second season with the Riders. He was taken in the first round (seventh overall) of the 2022 CFL draft. He dressed for 15 games with Saskatchewan last season, recording 10 catches for 165 yards.\n\nPicton is once again back with his hometown team. The 27-year-old was drafted by the Riders in 2017 and has become Mr. Versatility for the team, able to line up at any receiver or slotback position. He dressed for 12 games in 2022, recording 220 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nOffensive line\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Diego Alatorre Montoya, Logan Bandy, Philip Blake, Matthew Derks, Logan Ferland, Evan Floren, Zack Fry, Peter Godber, Jerald Hawkins, Evan Johnson, Colton Lamson, Andrew Lauderdale, Eric Lofton, Jeremiah Poutasi, Kooper Richardson, Phil Saleh, Jordan Tucker\n\nThe group that will draw many eyes at camp this season will be the offensive line.\n\nPass protection was the most criticized part of the 2022 season after giving up 77 sacks – the most in the CFL by 24.\n\nWith the struggles, the Riders are revamping their offensive line, including a new O-line coach in Anthony Vitale.\n\nThe biggest name the Riders won’t have in 2023 is centre Dan Clark. The Regina product wasn’t signed to a new contract after the 2022 season, though he remains active in the community with the Riders.\n\nClark appeared in 131 games for the Riders during his career.\n\nThe favourite to replace Clark is Godber, who was signed in free agency after spending four seasons with B.C.\n\nBandy is entering his third season with the Riders and dressed for 17 games in 2022 – 11 of them as the starting centre after Clark suffered a broken leg in Week 2 against Edmonton.\n\nReturnees from last season include guards Logan Ferland and Evan Johnson and tackles Kooper Richardson and Andrew Lauderdale.\n\nFerland, a former member of the Regina Thunder, is entering his fifth season with the Riders after signing as a territorial junior in 2018. He has started 30 games for the Riders since 2021.\n\nJohnson joined the Riders in 2021 after spending the previous three seasons in Ottawa. In his career, he has started 84 CFL games – 32 as a member of the Riders.\n\nRichardson returns after a rookie season where he was thrust into the starting lineup due to inconsistent play throughout the season at the right tackle spot. He dressed for six games.\n\nIn the off-season, the Riders signed Blake to a contract, marking his second stint in green and white. He was with the Riders in 2018-19.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who was a fourth-round pick in the 2012 NFL draft, came to the CFL in 2015 as a member of the Alouettes. He played there until a trade sent him to Saskatchewan in 2018. He played the last two seasons in Toronto, where he won the Grey Cup last year.\n\nBlake not only brings a veteran presence to the group but versatility as well; he’s able to play any position along the line.\n\nFry returns for his second Riders training camp. He participated last year but played his final year of university eligibility at Western. A five-year starter for the Mustangs, Fry was the Riders’ second-round pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nFloren was selected by the Riders in the seventh round of the 2023 CFL draft. He played four seasons at Queen’s.\n\nHawkins was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL draft and appeared in 19 games. He also spent time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Houston Texans, New England Patriots and New Orleans Saints.\n\nPoutasi, a third-round selection by the Tennessee Titans in 2015, started seven games for the team in his rookie year. In 2016, he started one game with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also spent time with the Los Angeles Rams, Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nDefensive line\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Charles Akanno, Christian Albright, Stefen Banks, Miles Brown, DeMarcus Christmas, Bryan Cox Jr., Charbel Dabire, Nicholas Dheilly, Valentin Gnahoua, Micah Johnson, David Kenney, Lake Korte-Moore, Weston Kramer, Anthony Lanier II, KeShaun Moore, Pete Robertson, Cody Roscoe, Marcus Webb\n\nThe Riders released a key member of their defensive line group from previous seasons but went out and brought back a familiar face in free agency.\n\nDefensive end A.C. Leonard, the CFL sack-leader in 2021 with 11, was released by the Riders in January. Leonard signed with Edmonton in short order.\n\nDuring free agency, the Riders signed Banks and Johnson.\n\nBanks, 26, spent the past two seasons with Calgary. He recorded eight sacks in 23 games there.\n\nJohnson is back for a third stint with Saskatchewan after spending 2022 with Hamilton. Last season, the 34-year-old recorded seven sacks – his highest total since he had 14 in 2018 in Calgary.\n\nLining up next to Johnson will be Lanier II, who signed a contract extension in the off-season. Lanier had eight sacks in just 11 games played in 2022.\n\nAnother familiar face is Robertson. The defensive end led the Riders with nine sacks last season, with seven of those coming in the first four weeks of the season before he suffered an ankle injury in Week 5.\n\nCurrently, there are only three Canadian defensive linemen on the roster.\n\nKorte-Moore was the Riders’ first-round pick in this year’s draft after playing at UBC.\n\nDabire was taken in the 2019 draft (fifth round) by the Riders and has dressed for 37 games in his three-season career. He has four career sacks.\n\nDheilly, who is from Regina and played university football at both Regina and Saskatchewan, spent 2021 in Winnipeg before signing with the Riders for 2022. He dressed for eight games last season.\n\nBrown dressed for 13 games for the Riders in 2022, recording two sacks and 21 defensive tackles.\n\nChristmas was also with the Riders in 2022, dressing for 15 games. In CFL action, he recorded 22 defensive tackles and one sack.\n\nLinebackers\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): A.J. Allen, Tommy Bringi, Larry Dean, Matt Dean, Kyrei Fisher-Morris, Jerry Garner Jr., Kolby Harvell-Peel, Ryan Henry, Justin Herdman-Reed, Alvin Jones Jr., La’Akea Kaho’ohanohano, Derrick Moncrief, Lukas Ruoss, Micah Teitz, Nick Thomas\n\nThe Riders will welcome back two of their three starters from their 2022 linebacker group, as well as their most outstanding Canadian from 2021.\n\nTeitz missed all of 2022 after suffering a hip injury in the off-season. In 2021, his first as the team’s starting weak-side linebacker, he recorded 64 tackles and three sacks. He was named the team’s most outstanding Canadian for that campaign.\n\nLarry Dean, who was Saskatchewan’s weak-side linebacker in Teitz’s absence, is expected to move back into the middle following the departure of Darnell Sankey to the XFL.\n\nIf the CFL had a comeback player of the year, Dean would’ve been one of the frontrunners for that award last season. After missing 2021 due to a torn Achilles, the 34-year-old recorded 101 tackles, three sacks and two interceptions in ’22.\n\nMoncrief is expected to be the strong-side linebacker once again after a divisional all-star campaign – the only member of the Riders to be named one. Moncrief had 49 tackles and four interceptions.\n\nWith those players entrenched as the starters, the backup spots will be up for grabs with players like Allen and Jones Jr. continuing to improve as CFLers.\n\nDefensive backs\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Jordan Beaulieu, Jeremy Clark, Rodney Clemons, Jayden Dalke, Julius Faulk, Jaxon Ford, Justus Harris, Amari Henderson, Devin Jones, Austin Joyner, Nelson Lokombo, Nick Marshall, Rolan Milligan, Leon O’Neal Jr., Godfrey Onyeka, Kosi Onyeka, C.J. Reavis, Rashard Robinson, La’Andre Thomas, Kendarius Webster, Deontai Williams\n\nSaskatchewan brought back most of its defensive backfield but it could be an open competition for the safety and one of the halfback spots.\n\nThe Riders moved on from Canadian safety Mike Edem in the off-season, choosing not to re-sign the nine-year CFL veteran.\n\nIf the plan is to still have a national player at the position, it could be a race between three players – Lokombo, Dalke and Ford.\n\nLokombo was the second overall pick in the 2021 CFL draft, but missed his rookie season after suffering a torn Achilles a day before camp opened. The former Huskie, who was praised for his athleticism during his draft year, hasn’t translated that to the CFL yet. He was in and out of the lineup in 2022, dressing for 12 games.\n\nDalke, a former member of the PFC’s Edmonton Wildcats and University of Alberta Golden Bears, was called upon in many different situations last season as an in-game replacement for injured players. He was the team’s starting safety in its final regular-season game.\n\nFord, the Riders’ second-round pick in this year’s draft, could battle for the starting spot as well. Ford, a 2022 Canada West all-star, had five interceptions in four seasons as a member at the U of R.\n\nMarshall returns and is expected to hold down one of the cornerback spots. He has been a starter for the Riders since 2018 and has 15 career interceptions. He also holds the Riders’ record for most pick-sixes in a career (five).\n\nMilligan is expected to return as a starting halfback after a solid outing in 2022. He played in 17 games last season, recording 71 tackles, one sack and one interception.\n\nClark could play either halfback or cornerback for the team in 2023. He started 2022 at halfback but played cornerback to end the year due to injuries. Clark played in 17 games last season, recording 30 tackles.\n\nGodfrey Onyeka and Reavis could battle for a halfback spot but have also played strong-side linebacker as well.\n\nHenderson was in and out of the lineup for the Riders, appearing in 11 games.\n\nSpecial teams\n\nOn the roster (in alphabetical order): Mario Alford, Jorgen Hus, Brett Lauther, David Solie, Kaare Vedvik\n\nThe Riders aren’t expected to make many changes when it comes to their special teams this season.\n\nAlford was one of the most electrifying returners in the CFL last season and was named the league’s most outstanding special-teams player. He returned one punt, two kickoffs and a missed field goal for a touchdown last season.\n\nLauther converted on 82 per cent of his field-goal attempts last season.\n\nVedvik, a product of Norway, averaged 44.5 yards per punt last season with a long of 78-yards.\n\nHus has been a steady presence at long snapper for the Riders since 2015."
