But a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Matt Nichols in August and later an ankle injury to Chris Streveler meant the the club would use three different starters at the position — including Zach Collaros, acquired at the trade deadline — and still managed to finish the campaign with a dominant 33-12 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 107th Grey Cup.\n\nWinnipeg went just 2-4 in the final third of the regular season to finish in third place with an 11-7 record, but was 4-0 with Collaros behind centre beginning with a regular-season finale win over the Calgary Stampeders. That was followed by two ‘upset’ victories on the road — over the Stamps in Calgary in the Western Semi-Final and the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Regina in the Western Final — to earn a berth in the Grey Cup for the first time since 2011.\n\nThe Bombers flexed their muscles not long after the national anthem on championship Sunday, as Brandon Alexander intercepted Ticat QB Dane Evans on the first possession. Bombers defensive end Willie Jefferson — just three days earlier crowned the Canadian Football League’s Most Outstanding Defensive Player — then strip-sacked Evans later in the first quarter, with the ensuing fumble scooped up by Adam Bighill and capped by Andrew Harris with the game’s opening score.\n\nThat set an early tone and copied what had become a familiar blueprint in Bombers victories over the past few years, as the club dominated the line of scrimmage by rushing for 186 yards while the defence forced seven turnovers and Justin Medlock kicked six field goals to tie a Grey-Cup record.\n\nFittingly, it was Harris, the proud Winnipegger, who was front and centre as the Bombers ended the longest drought in franchise history — 28 years dating back to 1990 — to win an 11th Grey Cup. Harris rushed 18 times for 134 yards and a touchdown while pulling in another five passes for 35 yards and a score and for his efforts was named both the Grey Cup MVP and Most Valuable Canadian.\n\nGiven the championship drought, what followed next was hardly surprising: the team’s loyal fan base wrapped its collective arms around the Bombers in a huge hug at a Grey Cup parade that drew more than 10,000 fans to downtown Winnipeg, with the warm and fuzzy feelings from that celebration lasting well into 2020.\n\n2019 Grey Cup MVPs\n\nMVP: Andrew Harris, RB, Winnipeg\n\nCanadian: Andrew Harris, RB, Winnipeg\n\nThe 2019 Blue Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\n78th Grey Cup\n\nDate: November 25, 1990\n\nSite: B.C. Place, Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 50 EDMONTON ESKIMOS 11\n\nThe 1990 Bombers were hardly an offensive juggernaut, finishing with a league-low 472 points. But they did have some offensive stars and, coupled with an absolutely stifling defence, cranked out 12 wins during the regular season en route to the 10thGrey Cup title in franchise history.\n\nThe 1990 season began with most experts predicting the Bombers would finish last in the East Division, especially after a 1989 campaign that saw the club finish 7-11 following seven-consecutive defeats before a loss in the East Final. As the new season neared, and with Lee Saltz and Sam Garza listed 1-2 on the Bombers quarterback depth chart, GM Cal Murphy pulled off a shrewd deal that would be critical in the team’s success.\n\nJust prior to the start of the season, on Canada Day to be exact, Murphy swung a trade with the Saskatchewan Roughriders to land veteran pivot Tom Burgess. He was gritty, intelligent and gave the Bombers exactly the kind of efficient quarterbacking they needed – including a critical 30-yard run in the dying moments of the 1990 East Final that set up Trevor Kennerd’s game-winning field goal over the Toronto Argonauts.\n\nBurgess came up big again in the championship, as he was named the Grey Cup offensive MVP after completing 18 of 31 passes for 286 yards with three touchdowns to Lee Hull, Perry Tuttle and Warren Hudson. Danny McManus came off the bench later in the game and connected with Rick House for the other offensive TD.\n\nBut, as was the case all season, it was the defence that was the backbone in the championship win. Linebacker Greg Battle, the CFL’s Most Outstanding Defensive Player in 1990, intercepted two passes in the Grey Cup – returning one 32 yards for a TD – and was named the game’s defensive MVP with James West and Tyrone Jones registering sacks.\n\n1990 Grey Cup MVPs\n\nOffence: Tom Burgess, QB, Winnipeg\n\nDefence: Greg Battle, LB, Winnipeg\n\nCanadian: Warren Hudson, FB, Winnipeg\n\nThe 1990 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Mike Riley\n\nGM: Cal Murphy\n\nQuarterbacks: Tom Burgess, Danny McManus, Sammy Garza\n\nRunning backs: Robert Mimbs, Warren Hudson, Matt Pearce\n\nReceivers: Lee Hull, Perry Tuttle, Rick House, Eric Streater, Ken Winey, Rob Crifo, (injured: James Murphy)\n\nOffensive line: Chris Walby, David Black, Lyle Bauer, Bob Molle, Nick Benjamin, Steve Rodehutskors, Scott Redl\n\nDefensive line: Quency Williams, Stan Mikawos, Mike Gray, Leon Hatziioannou, Jeff Croonen\n\nLinebackers: Tyrone Jones, James West, Greg Battle, Paul Randolph, Albert Williams\n\nDefensive backs: Less Browne, Ken Hailey, Dave Bovell, Darryl Sampson, Rod Hill, Michael Allen\n\nKickers: Trevor Kennerd, Bob Cameron\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (50) – TDs: Warren Hudson (2); Lee Hull, Greg Battle, Perry Tuttle, Rick House; FGs: Trevor Kennerd (2); Converts: Kennerd (6); Safety touch (West sacked Ham in end zone)\n\nEskimos (11)– TD: Larry Willis; FG: Ray Macoritti; Convert: Macoritti; Single: Macoritti\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 7:11 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 13 yds\n\n1 10:38 Wpg TD, Hull, 11-yd pass from Burgess; Convert, Kennerd\n\n2 6:35 Edm Punt single, Macoritti, 56 yds\n\n2 14:59 Edm FG, Macoritti, 37 yds\n\n3 5:16 Wpg TD, Battle, 32-yd INT; Convert, Kennerd\n\n3 8:56 Wpg TD, Tuttle, 5-yd pass from Burgess; Convert Kennerd\n\n3 10:35 Wpg TD, Hudson, 18-yd pass from Burgess; Convert Kennerd\n\n3 15:00 Wpg TD, Hudson, 2-yard run; Convert Kennerd\n\n4 2:34 Edm TD, Willis, 20-yard pass from Ham; Convert Macoritti\n\n4 5:09 Wpg Safety, West sacks Ham in end zone\n\n4 10:24 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 14 yds\n\n4 12:54 Wpg TD, House, 56-yd pass from McManus; Convert Kennerd\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 50 Edmonton 11\n\nAttendance: 46,968\n\n1990 Grey Cup Game video\n\n76th Grey Cup\n\nDate: November 27, 1988\n\nSite: Lansdowne Park, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 22 B.C. LIONS 21\n\nThe 1988 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season opened with the finish of the 1987 campaign still stinging.\n\nThe ’87 Bombers were 12-6 and placed nine players on the CFL All-Star team but where upset at home in the East Final by the Toronto Argonauts. It had earned them the inauspicious label as ‘the best Bombers team never to win a Grey Cup.’\n\nThere was a ton of change heading into 1988, as well. Gone were quarterback Tom Clements, the CFL’s Most Outstanding Player in 1987 who had retired, along with Willard Reaves and Tyrone Jones to the NFL while the league’s top Canadian, Scott Flagel signed with Calgary.\n\nThey were 9-6 in October, but dropped their last three games to finish 9-9. That meant that as the playoffs opened, the Bombers were the longest of long shots. Just 12,210 fans showed up to watch the club knock off Hamilton at home in the East Semi-Final.\n\nBut momentum or, at least, hope, began to build after the Bombers knocked off the heavily-favoured Argos – 14-4 that season – in the East Final, leading to a Grey-Cup matchup against the 10-8 B.C. Lions.\n\nThe first-ever Grey Cup played in the nation’s capital was impacted by the weather. Conditions at kickoff were listed as 14C, but with winds gusting at 40 km/h. That made the kicking game critical, and punter Bob Cameron – the best wind-kicker in CFL history – played a mammoth role. Named the top Canadian, Cameron kicked two singles, but handled the wind conditions perfectly in a game that was all about field position.\n\nBombers QB Sean Salisbury connected with James Murphy for the team’s only touchdown, Trevor Kennerd hit four field goals and the win was sealed by one of the most-memorable moments in club history. Lions star pivot Matt Dunigan had driven his club to the Bombers seven-yard line with 1:45 left in the game when Delbert Fowler tipped a pass attempt into the end zone that was then grabbed by Michael Gray. It was a play dubbed ‘The Immaculate Interception’ and it was massive in the club’s 9thGrey Cup title.\n\n1988 Grey Cup MVPs\n\nOffence: James Murphy, WR, Winnipeg\n\nDefence: Mike Gray, DE, Winnipeg\n\nCanadian: Bob Cameron, P, Winnipeg\n\nThe 1988 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Mike Riley\n\nGM: Cal Murphy\n\nQuarterbacks: Sean Salisbury, Lee Saltz\n\nRunning backs: Tim Jessie, Tony Johns, Terry Cochrane, Vernon Pahl\n\nReceivers: James Murphy, Ken Winey, Buster Rhymes, Paul Shorten, Randy Fabi (injured: Perry Tuttle)\n\nOffensive line: David Black, Lyle Bauer, Brad Tierney, Bob Molle, Nick Bastaja, Steve Rodehutskors, (injured: Chris Walby)\n\nDefensive line: Stan Mikawos, Mike Gray, Leon Hatziioannou, Willie Fears\n\nLinebackers: James West, Paul Clatney, Dan Wicklum, Aaron Brown, Delbert Fowler, Romel Andrews\n\nDefensive backs: Ken Hailey, Darryl Sampson, Rod Hill, Michael Allen, Ken Pettway, James Jefferson, Bennie Thompson\n\nKickers: Trevor Kennerd, Bob Cameron\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (22) – TDs: James Murphy; FGs: Trevor Kennerd (4); Convert: Kennerd (1); Single: Bob Cameron (2); Kennerd.\n\nLions (21) – TDs: Anthony Cherry, David Williams; FG: Lui Passaglia; Convert: Passaglia (2); Single: Passaglia (2); safety touch\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 5:14 Wpg Cameron, 42-yd punt single\n\n1 7:43 BC TD, Cherry, 14-yd run; Convert Passaglia\n\n1 14:01 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 22 yds\n\n2 4:40 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 43 yds\n\n2 8:22 BC TD, Williams, 26-yd pass from Duigan; Convert Passaglia\n\n2 9:46 Wpg TD, Murphy, 35-yd pass from Salisbury; Convert Kennerd\n\n2 13:55 BC Single, Passaglia, missed field goal\n\n3 1:53 BC FG, Passaglia, 28 yds\n\n3 5:20 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 20 yds\n\n3 12:34 BC Single, Passaglia, 84 yds\n\n3 15:00 Wpg Single, Cameron, 49 yds\n\n4 12:05 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 30 yds\n\n4 14:02 BC Safety touch\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 22 B.C. 21\n\nAttendance: 50,604\n\n1988 Grey Cup highlights:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy0FRcSKleQ\n\n72nd Grey Cup\n\nDate: November 18, 1984\n\nSite: Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, Alberta\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 47 HAMILTON TIGER-CATS 17\n\nThe Blue Bombers lived the life of rock stars after capturing the 1984 Grey Cup, as it had been 22 years since their 1962 victory and 19 years since the team’s last appearance in the championship.\n\nAnd so, when the team returned home from the first-ever Grey Cup played in Edmonton, they were greeted like conquering heroes.\n\nThat wasn’t surprising. Not only had the Bombers not appeared in the title game since 1965, some solid clubs under head coach Ray Jauch and led by Dieter Brock in the late 1970s/early 1980s had unfortunately worked in the shadow of the CFL’s greatest dynasty in the Edmonton Eskimos of 1978-82.\n\nThe Bombers were led by former B.C. Lions head coach and Eskimo and Montreal Alouettes assistant Cal Murphy, then just in his second season as the team’s head coach, and finished 1984 with a 11-4-1 record. After knocking off the Esks in theWest Semi-Final, they upset the B.C. Lions at a sold-out B.C. Place to win the division.\n\nWinnipeg faced the Ticats in the title game and lined up against a familiar face – Brock, who had demanded and been granted a trade a year earlier in a deal that landed the Bombers quarterback Tom Clements.\n\nIt was Brock who snuck in for the game’s first score and the Ticats roared out to a 17-3 advantage before the Bombers found their footing on the icy grass at Commonwealth Stadium.\n\nWinnipeg set a record for points in a quarter with 27 (later broken by the Bombers in the 1990 Grey Cup, with 28) in what became a thorough spanking of the Ticats. Clements was named the offensive MVP, running back Sean Kehoe was the top Canadian while Tyrone Jones, who set a record with four quarterback sacks, was the top defensive player.\n\n1984 Grey Cup MVPs\n\nOffence: Tom Clements, QB, Winnipeg\n\nDefence: Tyrone Jones, LB, Winnipeg\n\nCanadian: Sean Kehoe, RB, Winnipeg\n\nThe 1984 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Cal Murphy\n\nGM: Paul Robson\n\nQuarterbacks: Tom Clements, John Hufnagel\n\nRunning backs: Pat Cantner, Sean Kehoe, Willard Reaves\n\nReceivers: Jeff Boyd, Jerome Erdman, Rick House, James Murphy, Kevin Neiles, Joe Poplawski\n\nOffensive line: Nick Bastaja, John Bonk, Mark Moors, Richard Nemeth, Chris Walby\n\nDefensive line: Doug MacIver, Stan Mikawos, Tony Norman, Brent Racette, John Sturdivant\n\nLinebackers: Aaron Brown, Delbert Fowler, Tyrone Jones, Vernon Pahl, Frank Robinson\n\nDefensive backs: Scott Flagel, Ken Hailey, Donovan Rose, David Shaw, Wylie Turner\n\nKickers: Trevor Kennerd, Bob Cameron\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (47) – TDs: Willard Reaves (2), Joe Poplawski, Stan Mikawos, Jeff Boyd; FGs: Trevor Kennerd (4); Converts: Kennerd (5)\n\nTiger-Cats (17)– TDs: Dieter Brock, Rocky DiPietro; FGs: Bernie Ruoff; Convert: Ruoff (2)\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 8:03 Ham TD, Brock, 15-yd run; Convert Ruoff\n\n1 11:24 Ham DiPietro, 7-yd pass from Brock; Convert Ruoff\n\n1 15:00 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 25 yds\n\n2 3:29 Ham FG, Ruoff, 20 yds\n\n2 4:58 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 46 yds\n\n2 7:28 Wpg TD, Reaves, 3-yd run; Convert Kennerd\n\n2 11:58 Wpg TD, Poplawski, 12-yd pass from Clements; Convert Kennerd\n\n2 12:34 Wpg TD, Mikawos, 24-yd fumble return; Convert Kennerd\n\n2 14:03 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 19 yds\n\n3 12:18 Wpg FG, Kennerd, 16 yds\n\n4 7:23 Wpg TD, Reaves, 3-yd run; Convert Kennerd\n\n4 11:10 Wpg Boyd, 4-yd pass from Hufnagel; Convert Kennerd\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 47 Hamilton 17\n\nAttendance: 60,081\n\n1984 Grey Cup video\n\n50th Grey Cup\n\nDate: December 1-2, 1962\n\nSite: Exhibition Stadium, Toronto, Ontario\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 28 HAMILTON TIGER-CATS 27\n\nA dominant side again during the regular season – Winnipeg would post a league-best 11-5 record in ’62 – the Bombers were fortunate just to make it to one of the strangest Grey Cup games every played.\n\nThe Calgary Stampeders had captured the first game of the best-of-three West Final and, after losing the second, were ahead with just one play remaining in the decisive game at Winnipeg Stadium.\n\nGerry James had a 17-yard field-goal attempt partially blocked by Jim Furlong of the Stamps, with the ball bouncing into the Calgary end zone. Calgary’s Harvey Wylie opted to kick at the ball to get it out of play, but his attempt hit a charging Farrell Funston of the Bombers, who fell on it for a touchdown and a 12-7 Bomber win.\n\nThe 1962 Grey Cup – which became known as ‘The Fog Bowl’ — featured the Bombers meeting the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for the fifth time in six years and was carried live for the first time on a commercial U.S. TV networks (ABC). But as the fog rolled in off Lake Ontario for the late Saturday afternoon telecast the conditions worsened dramatically. That’s when CFL commissioner G. Sydney Halter opted to postpone the game with 9:29 remaining and the Bombers leading 28-27.\n\nThe two clubs returned to Exhibition Stadium the next day – with just 15,000 fans returning – but there was no more scoring.

Winnipeg had posted a league-best 14-2 record in 1960, a winning percentage that remains unmatched by any other Bomber side in club history.\n\nBut in the three-game divisional final the Bombers beat the Edmonton Eskimos 22-16 and then fell 10-5 and 4-2 – the key play in the clinching-game a fumble by quarterback Ken Ploen.\n\nPloen would more than redeem himself in 1961 after hammering the Calgary Stampeders 14-1 and 43-14 in the West Final.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Bombers – 13-3 that season – would meet the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for the Grey Cup. The Ticats were led by Bernie Faloney and held a 14-7 lead heading into the fourth quarter as the star quarterback connected with Paul Dekker for a 90-yard TD in the first and followed with a 23-yard scoring strike to Ralph Goldston in the third.\n\nBut the Bombers, led by superb two-way lineman Frank Rigney, would limit the Tabbies to just 25 yards rushing. And while Ploen and Hal Ledyard would combine to complete only 12 of 22 passes the ground attack of Leo Lewis and Roger Hagberg were able to rumble for 268 yards.\n\nAs the game wore on the Bombers grew stronger. And when Gerry James slammed home from three yards out in the fourth quarter, the game was sent into extra time – the first Grey Cup to be decided in overtime.\n\nPloen would play the hero in OT in one of those moments that will be forever etched in Bombers and CFL history in one of the greatest single plays in the league’s history. In the second overtime, Ploen dropped back to pass, but finding no one open opted to run.\n\nHis 19-yard scramble to pay dirt – in which he eluded several would be Ticat defenders – is one of the most-spectacular runs football fans have ever seen and was part of an effort that made Ploen the game’s MVP.\n\nGrey Cup MVP: Ken Ploen, QB, Winnipeg\n\nThe 1961 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Bud Grant\n\nGM: Jim Ausley\n\nRoster: Jack Delveaux (FB, P), George Druxman (C, LB), Farrell Funston (E), Herb Gray (DE, LB), Farrell Funston (E), Herb Gray (DE, G), Roger Hagberg (FB), Roger Hamelin (T), Rod Humeniuk (G), Gerry James (FB, K), Henry Janzen (DB), Ray Jauch (HB), Ron Latourelle (HB), Hal Ledyard (QB), Leo Lewis, Jr. (RB), Cec Luining (E), Ron Meadmore (DE), Nick Miller (HB), Baz Nagle (HB), Steve Patrick (T, G), Cornel Piper (G), Ernie Pitts (E), Kenny Ploen (QB), Rick Potter (HB), Norm Rauhaus (DB, E), Frank Rigney (T), Gordie Rowland (HB, LB), Roger Savoie (T), Garland Warren (C), Mike Wright (T)\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (21) – TDs: Gerry James, Ken Ploen (OT); Field goal: Gerry James (2); Convert: Gerry James (2); Single: Jack Delveaux\n\nTiger-Cats (14)– TDs: Paul Dekker, Ralph Goldson; Convert: Don Sutherin (2).\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 7:45 Ham Dekker, 90-yd pass from Faloney; Convert Sutherin\n\n2 11:40 Wpg Single, Delveaux, 46-yd punt\n\n3 5:46 Wpg FG, James, 18 yds\n\n3 11:33 Ham TD, Goldson, 23-yd pass from Faloney; Convert Sutherin\n\n3 14:59 Wpg FG, James, 28 yds\n\n4 9:57 Wpg TD, James, 28-yd run; Convert James\n\nOT (2) 1:58 Wpg Ploen, 18-yd run; Convert James\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 21 Hamilton 14\n\nAttendance: 32,651\n\n1961 Grey Cup video (courtesy CBC)\n\n47th Grey Cup\n\nDate: November 28, 1959\n\nSite: Exhibition Stadium, Toronto, Ontario\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 21 HAMILTON TIGER-CATS 7\n\nFollowing another dominant regular season in which the Bombers finished with a 12-4 record, the club would knock off the Edmonton Eskimos en route to another Grey Cup showdown with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n\nAfter years of playing the Grey Cup at Varsity Stadium, the 1959 championship was held at Exhibition Stadium, a new park on the Canadian National Exhibition fairgrounds right on the shores of Lake Ontario. But there were troubles with the change of venue. The field was covered with a tarpaulin the night before the game, but it did little to protect the turf. During the contest, groundskeepers were often seen scrambling onto the field during breaks in the action to replace giant chunks of sod which had become uprooted.\n\nThe Ticats led 7-3 into the third quarter in what would have to be dubbed a yawner, especially in comparison to the classic the same two teams served up the year previous in Vancouver. All that said, there was some brilliance in the game, both on the field and in the strategy used by head coach Bud Grant en route to victory. Grant utilized the talents of fullback Charlie Shepard while also employing the quick kick and, following TDs from Shepard and Ernie Pitts on a 33-yard pass from Ken Ploen, the Bombers cruised to victory\n\nGrey Cup MVP: Charlie Shepard, FB/P, Winnipeg\n\nThe 1959 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Bud Grant\n\nGM: Jim Ausley\n\nRoster: Walt Bilicki (C, LB), Dave Burkholder (LB, T), Jack Delveaux (FB, P), George Druxman (C, LB), Farrell Funston (E), Herb Gray (DE, G), Gerry James (FB, K), Henry Janzen (DB), Ed Kotowich (G), Ron Latourelle (HB), Leo Lewis, Jr. (RB), Cec Luining (E), Ron Meadmore (DE), Nick Miller (HB), Steve Patrick (T, G), Cornel Piper (G), Ernie Pitts (E), Kenny Ploen (QB), Rick Potter (HB), Norm Rauhaus (DB, E), Frank Rigney (T), Rae Ross (DB, E), Gordie Rowland (HB), Roger Savoie (T), Carver Shannon (HB, K), Charlie Shepard (FB, P), Buddy Tinsley (T, DT), Jim Van Pelt (QB), Gene Wlasiuk (HB)\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (21) – TDs: Charlie Shepard, Ernie Pitts Field goal: Gerry James; Convert: Gerry James (2); Single: Charlie Shepard (4)\n\nTiger-Cats (7)– Field goal: Steve Oneschuk (2); Single: Vince Scott\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 5:18 Wpg FG, James, 21 yds\n\n2 5:45 Ham Single, Scott, blocked punt into end zone (Wpg recovered)\n\n3 7:50 Ham FG, Oneschuk, 10 yds\n\n3 14:46 Ham FG, Oneschuk, 28 yds\n\n4 2:48 Wpg Single, Shepard, 37-yd punt\n\n4 4:54 Wpg TD, Shepard, 2-yd run; Convert James\n\n4 6:32 Wpg Single, Shepard, 76-yd punt\n\n4 10:45 Wpg Single, Shepard, 53-yd punt\n\n4 13:36 Wpg Single, Shepard, 69-yd punt\n\n4 14:50 Wpg TD, Pitts, 33-yd pass from Ploen\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 21 Hamilton 7\n\nAttendance: 33,133\n\n46thGrey Cup\n\nDate: November 29, 1958\n\nSite: Empire Stadium, Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 35 HAMILTON TIGER-CATS 28\n\nBefore the heroics of Ken Ploen in 1961, before the Tom Clements-to-Tony-Gabriel big finish for Ottawa in 1976 and Dave Ridgway’s dramatic kick for Saskatchewan in 1989, there was the 1958 classic – still to this day ranked as one of the greatest Grey Cups of all time.\n\nThe Bombers and Hamilton Tiger-Cats met in a rematch of the 1957 title game, won easily by the Ticats 32-7, in a match=up that would become common over five of the next six Grey Cups. In 1958, the Bombers and Ticats would trade shots like heavyweight contenders in a prize fight.\n\nHamilton jumped to a 14-0 lead early by capitalizing on Bomber miscues, including a fumble by Winnipeg rookie QB Jim Van Pelt that was returned 75 yards by Ticat defender Ralph Goldston. The Bombers other QB, Ken Ploen, had injured his shoulder in the sixth game of the regular season and had been replaced by Van Pelt. Ploen, showcasing his amazing athleticism, would still suit up for the Grey Cup and star in the secondary.\n\n“Van Pelt looked like a little bitty kid down the street,” former Bomber Buddy Tinsley told Graham Kelly in Kelly’s book ‘Grey Cup: A History.’ “But he was a really smart quarterback.”\n\nBefore the day was over Van Pelt and a number of other Bombers all took turns leading Winnipeg to victory to end a 17-year drought from the winner’s circle.\n\nVan Pelt scored on a sneak to get Winnipeg on the board and then kicked two field goals to cut the Ticat lead to 14-13. That’s when Hamilton head coach Jim Trimble – who had said before the game his team would ‘waffle’ the Bombers – made one of those coaching blunders that lives to this day. On the last play of the first half Trimble elected to punt with Hamilton scrimmaging from their own 13-yard line. Norm Rauhaus busted through the line to stuff the punt and recover it in the end zone to give the Bombers the lead.\n\nIn the second half Leo Lewis connected with Van Pelt for a TD on a trick play as part of a day that saw the Bombers QB finish with 22 points – a Grey-Cup record that stood for 19 years until Montreal Alouettes kicker Don Sweet racked up 23 points in the 1977 Grey Cup.\n\nOf the four Grey Cups the Bombers would win over a five-year span from 1958-62, most of those involve savour the 1958 championship the most.\n\n“Winnipeg hadn’t won a Grey Cup in 18 years,” said Bombers coach Bud Grant. “After what we had gone through the year before and then playing Hamilton again and Jim Trimble – who had been my coach in Philadelphia – saying they were going to waffle us, 1958 was the most satisfying.”\n\n(No MVP awarded prior to 1959)\n\nThe 1958 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Bud Grant\n\nGM: Jim Ausley\n\nRoster: Walt Bilicki (C, LB), Dave Burkholder (LB, T), George Druxman (C, LB), Frank Gilliam (E), Herb Gray (DE, G), Bob Hobert (T), Tony Kehrer (HB), Ed Kotowich (C, G), Ron Latourelle (HB), Buddy Leake (QB), Leo Lewis, Jr. (RB), Bob McNamara (HB, K), Ted Mikliechuk (G, LB), Nick Miller (HB), Steve Patrick (T), Keith Pearce (E), Cornel Piper (G), Ernie Pitts (E), Kenny Ploen (QB, HB), Rick Potter (HB), Norm Rauhaus (DB, E), Barry Roseborough (QB), Gordie Rowland (HB), Roger Savoie (T), Bob Stransky (HB, K), Buddy Tinsley (T, DT), Jim Tonn (HB), Jim Van Pelt (QB, K), Gerry Vincent (E)\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (35) – TDs: Jim Van Pelt (2), Norm Rauhaus; Charlie Shepard; Field goal: Jim Van Pelt (2); Convert: Jim Van Pelt (4); Single: Charlie Shepard\n\nTiger-Cats (28) – TDs: Ron Howell (2), Gerry McDougall, Ralph Goldston; Convert: Steve Oneschuk (4)\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 4:20 Ham TD, McDougall, 10-yd run; Convert Oneschuk\n\n1 6:49 Ham TD, Goldston, 70-yd fumble return; Convert Oneschuk\n\n1 11:35 Wpg TD, Van Pelt, 20-yd pass from Lewis; Convert Van Pelt\n\n2 6:56 Wpg FG, Van Pelt, 22 yds\n\n2 10:12 Wpg FG, Van Pelt, 27 yds\n\n2 15:00 Wpg TD, Rauhaus, blocked punt recovered in end zone; Convert Van Pelt\n\n3 4:41 Ham TD, Howell, 12-yd pass from Faloney; Convert Oneschuk\n\n3 10:54 Wpg TD, Shepard, 3-yd run; Convert Van Pelt\n\n3 13:48 Ham TD, Howell, 34-yd pass from Faloney; Convert Oneschuk\n\n4 1:47 Wpg TD, Van Pelt, 1-yd run; Convert Van Pelt\n\n4 5:24 Wpg Single, Shepard, 52-yd punt\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 35 Hamilton 28\n\nAttendance: 36,567\n\n1958 Grey Cup video\n\n29thGrey Cup\n\nDate: November 29, 1941\n\nSite: Varsity Stadium, Toronto, Ontario\n\nBLUE BOMBERS 18 OTTAWA ROUGH RIDERS 16\n\nThe Rough Riders were making their third consecutive appearance in the title game, while the Bombers arrived for their fifth Grey Cup in seven years dating back to 1935. The two squads served up a dandy final in a game played in perfect conditions – 15 degrees Celsius at kickoff.\n\nThe Bombers opened the scoring on a 24-yard field goal by Ches McCance, with Ottawa taking the lead back when Tony Golab’s short punt bounced back to him before he scrambled 45 yards for a TD. The Bombers tied the score at 9-9 in the second quarter after some shrewd work by punter Wayne Sheley. Noticing the Rough Riders appeared to be lining up for a punt block, Sheley completed a pass to Bud Marquardt and raced downfield before lateralling to Mel Wilson for a play that covered 45 yards.\n\nWinnipeg took the lead early in the second half when Marquardt scooped up a fumble and rushed 44 yards for a TD and a 15-9 advantage. The Rough Riders countered with two field goals to tie the score at 15-15, but McCance hit on a 38-yard field goal while an Ottawa attempt from 17 yards out with less than four minutes remaining sailed wide to preserve an 18-16 win.\n\nKey to the victory was some considerable scouting work done by the Bombers. After the game, Bombers coach Reg Threlfall held up a five-cent notepad and two scratch pads with contained all of Ottawa’s plays.\n\n“This scribbler I’ve had for years,” Threlfall told reporters. “When we played Ottawa two years ago in the final I made diagrams of all their plays. This pad (holding up another) has diagrams of the Ottawa plays noted by (assistant coach) Bert Warwick when he scouted the Ottawa versus Hamilton Tigers game last week in Ottawa.\n\n“And this one, I drew in the first quarter of the game today.

Conditions were far from perfect and the field was rock hard. In an attempt to soften the turf, organizers poured 400 gallons of gasoline on the field and let it ablaze the day before the game. But freezing conditions overnight didn’t help those efforts.\n\nOttawa opened the scoring, but the Bombers countered after recovering a fumble deep in Rough Rider territory, with Andy Bieber waltzing in for a seven-yard TD. The game’s scoring then came from singles on missed field goals. With the score tied 7-7 Jeff Nicklin recovered a fumbled punt for the Bombers at the Ottawa 34 to change field position. A subsequent Bombers punt into the end zone was kicked out by the Rough Riders, but shanked out of bounds only to their eight-yard line. And with 45 seconds remaining, Winnipeg’s Art Stevenson crushed a kick into the stands for a single and an 8-7 victory. Fritz Hanson, who played a critical role in the Bombers first Grey Cup win, was again superb in his punt returns and finishing with 126 yards rushing.\n\nThe 1939 Bombers Grey Cup lineup:\n\nHead coach: Reg Threlfall\n\nGM: Joe Ryan\n\nRoster: Harry Badger (HB), Andy Bieber (HB), Bill Boivin (HB), Bill Ceretti (G), Percy Daigle (HB), Marty Gainor (T), Fritz Hanson (HB), Ben Hatskin (C), Greg Kabat (G, HB, K), Les Lear (G), Bud Marquardt (E), Ches McCance (E), Lou Mogul (T), Bill Nairn (G, T, K), Jeff Nicklin (FW), Herb Peschel (T), Wayne Sheley (QB), Art Stevenson (HB), Mel Wilson (C)\n\nScoring:\n\nBlue Bombers (8) – TDs: Andy Bieber; Singles: Greg Kabat (2); Art Stevenson\n\nRough Riders (7) – TD: Andy Tommy; Convert: Tiny Herman; Single: Tiny Herman\n\nScoring Summary\n\nQtr Time Team Scoring play\n\n1 7:00 Ott TD, Tommy, 65-yd pass and run (Burke to Perley and then lateral to Tommy for final 28 yes); Convert Herman\n\n1 11:00 Wpg TD, Bieber, 7-yd run (convert failed)\n\n2 0:30 Wpg Single, Kabat, 42-yd missed field goal\n\n4 2:00 Wpg Single, Kabat, 24-yd missed field goal\n\n4 8:00 Ott Single, Herman, 25-yd missed field goal\n\n4 14:15 Wpg Single, Stevenson, punt through end zone\n\nFinal: Winnipeg 8 Ottawa 7\n\nAttendance: 11,738\n\n1939 Grey Cup video\n\n23rd Grey Cup\n\nDate: December 7, 1935\n\nSite: Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds, Hamilton, Ontario\n\nWINNIPEG ‘PEGS 18 HAMILTON TIGERS 12\n\nThe headline in The Winnipeg Free Press after the 1935 Grey Cup screamed: ‘Zowie! ‘Pegs Win’ and it captured the magnitude of the moment.\n\nNot only did the victory mark the franchise’s first championship, it was the first Grey Cup title captured by a team from Western Canada and marked the first time a team had won with American players in its lineup.\n\nThe Tigers had dominated their opponents in the East and were heavily-favoured heading into the game.
