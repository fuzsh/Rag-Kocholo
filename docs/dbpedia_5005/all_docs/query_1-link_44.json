First and foremost, a player must have received First Team All-America recognition by a selector organization that is recognized by the NCAA and utilized to comprise their consensus All-America teams.\n\n2. A player becomes eligible for consideration by the Foundation's Honors Courts ten years after his final year of intercollegiate football played.\n\n3. While each nominee's football achievements in college are of prime consideration, his post football record as a citizen is also weighed. He must have proven himself worthy as a citizen, carrying the ideals of football forward into his relations with his community and fellow man. Consideration may also be given for academic honors and whether or not the candidate earned a college degree.\n\n4. Players must have played their last year of intercollegiate football within the last 50 years*. For example, to be eligible for the 2010 ballot, the player must have played his last year in 1960 or thereafter. In addition, players who are playing professionally and coaches who are coaching on the professional level are not eligible until after they retire.\n\n5. A coach becomes eligible three years after retirement or immediately following retirement provided he is at least 70 years of age. Active coaches become eligible at 75 years of age. He must have been a head coach for a minimum of 10 years and coached at least 100 games with a .600 winning percentage*.\n\n* Players that do not comply with the 50-year rule and coaches that have not won 60% of their games may still be eligible for consideration by the Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) and Divisional Honors Review Committees, which examine unique cases.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME\n\nIncluding the 2011 FBS class, only 896 players and 192 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame from the nearly five million who have played or coached the game over the past 142 years. In other words, less than one percent (.0002) have been deemed worthy of this distinction.\n\nFounded in 1947, The National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame inducted its first class of inductees in 1951. The first class included 32 players and 19 coaches, including Illinois' Red Grange, Notre Dame's Knute Rockne, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Carlisle's Jim Thorpe.\n\n284 schools are represented with at least one College Football Hall of Famer.\n\nInduction for this class of Hall of Famers will take place December 6, 2011 at the NFF Annual Awards Dinner in New York City's historic Waldorf=Astoria.\n\nCARLOS ALVAREZ\n\nUniversity of Florida\n\nWide Receiver, 1969-71\n\nA first-ballot College Football Hall of Famer, Carlos Alvarez remains one of the most prolific players in Florida history and becomes the sixth Gator to enter college football's ultimate shrine.\n\nAlvarez made his mark early in Gainesville, setting single-season records for receptions (88), yards (1,329) and touchdown catches (12) en route to becoming the youngest player to ever make the AFCA All-America team.
