        "text": "While the showdown between the Saskatchewan Roughriders and Montreal Alouettes has been highly anticipated since free agency, the quarterbacks doing battle might not be the pair many expected.\n\nFor the Riders, Mason Fine will start his fourth straight CFL game this season after a knee injury to Trevor Harris, who was the Alouettes’ quarterback in 2021 and ’22.\n\nAls starter Cody Fajardo — who was the Riders’ main pivot from 2019 through ’22 — is listed as a game-time decision for Friday’s game at Percival Molson Stadium due to a shoulder injury. Kickoff for the game is set for 5:30 p.m.\n\nIf Fajardo can’t go, either Caleb Evans or Davis Alexander would start in his place.\n\nIf Fine and Fajardo face off, it will be a battle between two former teammates and someone from whom Fine learned a lot during his first two seasons as a backup.\n\n“Even last year at the end, it was more of a big-brother-little-brother type of thing,” Fine said. “It’s how it is and I still look up to Cody and I learned a lot from him.\n\n“He has been in the league and has had success. Overall, it’s a good relationship and there’s nothing negative there. I’ll always wish him and his family the best.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Fine won his first game as a CFL starter last week with a 26-24 decision over the Ottawa Redblacks. This season, Fine has thrown for 998 yards with three touchdowns and four interceptions as the Riders now have a 4-4 record.\n\nFajardo has the Alouettes standing at 4-3 and has thrown for 1,877 yards with six touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also added 174 rushing yards and three touchdowns on the ground.\n\nFine replaced Fajardo for the final two games of 2022’s 6-12 campaign after the Riders elected to bench the veteran.\n\n“We’re all competitive and we are all professionals and we are highly competitive,” Fine said. “In his situation, I’m sure he was upset, but in the same way he was able to be a professional and try to make me the best quarterback I could be and try to get a win for the team.\n\n“He was all about the team and how can we be successful.”\n\nFajardo isn’t the only major piece from the Riders’ past two seasons to now wear Als colours. Jason Maas is now Montreal’s bench boss after he was the Riders’ offensive co-ordinator in 2021 and ’22.\n\n“We weren’t good enough on offence and we felt like we needed to make changes,” Riders head coach Craig Dickenson said of the decision to part ways with Maas. “I had a pretty good visit with Jason when we let him go. He didn’t like it but he understood.\n\n“He landed on his feet just fine. I would never wish anybody to not have success and I’m happy both have found a new home in Montreal and that they are doing well.”\n\nMaas said the Riders made a decision to let him go, but he is now in a better position.\n\n“I got another opportunity to be a head coach and I am thankful for that. I’m thankful for my time in Saskatchewan as well,” Maas said. “I’m full focused on our team.\n\n“I shake the hand of every head coach after the game the same. I’m very thankful for competition and the fact we compete for a living and play and coach a game for a living.\n\n“It’s not personal for me at all.”\n\nWhile it’s the first time a few former Riders play their former team, Saskatchewan is employing a couple of former Alouettes of its own.\n\nIn addition to Harris, slotback Jake Wieneke also left Montreal in free agency to join the Riders.\n\n“I’m just excited – excited to go back and see a bunch of my teammates and friends so it’s going to be a fun game,” Wieneke said. “I think it’s good to reflect on it and think about some great memories I have and how I have grown as a man and a player.\n\n“I’m just excited to step foot in Montreal and look around and play in a stadium I am familiar with.”\n\nThe Alouettes will be without a couple of key contributors in the contest, with running back William Stanback and defensive tackle Almondo Sewell slated to miss the game.\n\nWhile the Als will miss Sewell’s presence, Montreal recently brought in defensive end Shawn Lemon, who had 14 sacks with the Calgary Stampeders last season. He recorded two sacks in last week’s game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n\nThe Riders’ offensive line will look for a repeat performance from last week’s game, in which the team surrendered zero sacks to Ottawa.\n\n“We made sure the five of us were all on the same page so we all knew what we were doing,” said offensive tackle Colin Kelly. “When you’re able to go out there and know what you’re doing, you’re able to play fast and play physical.\n\n“(Lemon) is an older player so he probably has some crafty veteran moves out there. As long as we are on top of things and know what we are doing out there, I think we will be fine.”\n\nDickenson expects a physical game when the two teams clash.\n\n“They are really strong across the board, they play really hard and they are known for being physical guys,” Dickenson said."
