        "text": "Kevin Boothe\n\nWhen Kevin Boothe entered Cornell, he came as a lightly recruited, 370-pound lineman. He left as a three-time first-team All-Ivy selection, a first-team All-American, an NFL Draft pick, and is generally regarded as one of the top offensive linemen ever to suit up for an Ancient Eight school.\n\nBoothe was named to the All-America first team by the American Football Coaches Association and to the second team by the The Sports Network and the Associated Press as a senior. Boothe was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy pick in each of his final two years. He was then picked by the Oakland Raiders in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft and ended up starting 14 of the team's 16 games as a rookie. Boothe played for the New York Giants from 2007-13, winning a pair of Super Bowl titles in the process before returning to Oakland for the 2014 season. Hillary Chollet\n\nChollet established himself as one of Cornell's greatest modern athletes. A four-year letterman in both basketball and football, he was captain and the outstanding all-around player on the 1948-49 basketball team. He set Cornell's all-time game record with 37 points against Syracuse in 1949, scoring on 19-of-21 foul shots, which set a national collegiate record. He was a standout running back and defensive safety in football and the team's best kick returner from 1946-49. He missed the 1947 season with an injury was given permission to play in 1949. Chollet led Cornell to a record of 21-5-1 over his career, including 8-1 records in 1948 and '49 and the unofficial Ivy League championship both seasons. Following his outstanding play during the '49 season, he was accorded many honors, including Chicago Tribune All-America first team; Associated Press All-America second team; and first teams of the AP All-East, AP All-Ivy and Collier's All-East; and was named The Cornell Sun Athlete of the Year. Bob Dean\n\nDean won three letters in football as a back, punter and place-kicker. A punting specialist, his 41.9 average in 1947 was good enough for second place in the East and ninth in the country. As a senior, he was second in team scoring with 44 points on 23 PATs, one field goal and three touchdowns. Among Eastern teams in 1947, he placed ninth in total offense with 690 yards. He was instrumental in helping Cornell to an 8-1 overall record en route to winning the Ivy League championship. He garnered All-East honorable mention honors in 1947, and was an AP All-Ivy honorable mention pick the following year. Dean was ranked second in the East in punting his senior year in 1948. He was selected to play in the Eastern College All-Star game vs. the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in September of 1949. He was the Cornell Sun Athlete of the year in 1949. Gilmour \"Gil\" Dobie\n\nOne of the game's most successful coaches of all time, his reputation as a dour pessimist earned him the nickname \"Gloomy Gil.\" But no one would dare argue with his success. In 33 years of coaching at Agricultural College of North Dakota, University of Washington, the Naval Academy, Cornell and at Boston College, his teams scored 180 victories against just 45 losses and 15 ties. His Washington team went undefeated from 1908 through 1916. At Cornell his men had an undefeated string of 26 straight from 1921 through the first two games of 1924. His best team at Cornell was the 1922 squad which boasted a backfield of George Pfann, Eddie Kaw, Floyd Ramsey and Charles Cassidy. Pfann and Kaw are members of the Cornell Hall of Fame and both, along with Dobie, are in the National Football Hall of Fame. Dobie was known as a demanding perfectionist, His teams were usually characterized by precision and hard hitting power. Keith Ferguson\n\nFerguson graduated as the school's career leader in receptions (202) and receiving yards (2,569), becoming just the seventh Ivy League player to register more than 200 catches. His 14 career touchdowns also ranked fourth all-time at Cornell upon graduation. Ferguson caught 70 passes for 852 yards as a senior, a mark that ranked fourth all-time in a season at the time. He had seven career 100-yard receiving games, including a 177-yard effort at Brown in 2002, a mark that ranked second in a single game in Cornell history. He set a Big Red and Ivy League record with at least one catch in all 39 career games. Ferguson was a second-team All-Ivy League pick as a senior in 2002. He captured the team's Pop Warner Award as the squad's most valuable player in 2002, took home the Charles Colucci Award as the senior who most contributed to the varsity in 2001 and won the Jack Murphy Big Play Award as a sophomore in 2000.\n\nGrant Gellatly\n\nGellatly was named to the Capital One Academic All-America second team and to the Beyond Sports Network second team and College Sports Madness All-America third team as a senior in 2013. He was a first-team All-Ivy League selection after setting Cornell single season receiving records with 91 catches for 1,224 yards to go along with eight touchdowns. He led the league and ranked second nationally in receiving yards per game (122.4) and receptions per game (9.1). Gellatly finished his career ranked second at Cornell in career receptions (194) and receiving yards (2,486) and was fifth in all-purpose yardage (3,766 yards). He had a school-record 10 career 100-yard receiving games and two 200-yard games in his career. Gellatly was a two-time All-Ivy pick and served as a team captain during his senior year. Pete Gogolak\n\nA football innovator, Pete Gogolak introduced soccer-style kicking to American football. He was the first player to kick soccer-style in the college and professional ranks.\n\nWhile at Cornell, Gogolak set a major college record by connecting on 44 consecutive kick conversions from 1961 to 1963 and still holds the Cornell record for consecutive conversions and career conversion percentage (.982, 54-of-55). His 50-yard field goal vs. Lehigh in 1963 was the nation's longest in a major college game. He booted nine career field goals, including eight of 40 yards or more.\n\nAfter Cornell, Gogolak signed with the Buffalo Bills after being drafted in the 12th round of the AFL Draft. He played two seasons with the Bills, including kicking for the 1965 AFL champion team. He was named kicker of the AFL all-pro team and in 1984, was named to the Silver Anniversary all-time team. After playing out his option with Buffalo, Gogolak signed with the New York Giants and played 10 seasons, becoming the franchise's all-time leading scorer and kicking the longest field goal in team history (54 yards). As of 2006, he is still the leading scorer in Giants history.\n\nGogolak's family came to the United States from Hungary in 1956. His brother, Charlie, is the all-time top place-kicker in the history of Princeton football. The family's story was featured in Life Magazine in 1963. Brad Greenway\n\nOne of the school's all-time best place-kickers, Greenway was an honorable mention All-American, first-team All-Ivy and All-ECAC selection and a finalist for the Fred Mitchell Award as the nation's best kicker as a senior in 2011. He ranks among the school's most accurate place-kickers and dangerous weaon on special teams.\n\nHe led the Ancient Eight in scoring (7.5 points per game), ranking 41st nationally. Greenway set the Cornell kick scoring record for a career (189 points) and season (75 points), while his 189 career points ranks third all-time in Big Red history. Greenway finished 18th nationally in field goals (13, 1.3 per game), a mark that was second in the Ancient Eight. He was the only kicker in the Ivy League to post a perfect season on extra-point kicks (36-of-36) and was 5-of-5 on field goals of 40 yards or more. The two-time Special Teams Player of the Week also kicked off and punted for Cornell and was the team's captain on special teams. Luke Hagy\n\nHagy graduated as one of the most versatile running backs in Ivy League history, becoming the first player to post 2,000 rushing yards and 1,500 receiving yards in a career. He was a three-time All-Ivy selection, including a first-team pick as a senior.\n\nHagy was a second team All-Ivy pick as a junior and an honorable mention selection as a sophomore and became the first Cornell player to lead the Big Red in rushing all four seasons as well as the first player in school history to average at least 100 yards from scrimmage per game in all four years. Hagy ranked third in the Ivy League in rushing as a senior in 2015 despite missing one full game, a quarter of a second and all but one play of a third (equivalent of 2 1/4 games). Despite that, he still had had four 100-yard rushing games, including 117 yards against Yale and 128 yards at Princeton. He ended his Cornell career in the top five at Cornell all-time in all-purpose yardage and top 10 in rushing, touchdowns, receptions and receiving yards.

He was a first-team All-Ivy pick in 1998 as a senior, and was named to the second-team in both 1996 and 1997. As a freshman in 1995, Hanson was an Honorable Mention All-Ivy pick and selected as the runner-up for the Ivy League Rookie of The Year Award. In his senior season, he was named co-captain and received the Pop Warner Most Valuable Player Award. During the 1998 campaign he lead the Big Red in tackles for the third straight year with 135 (100 solo, 35 assists). Hanson finished his Cornell career with 530 tackles (359 solo, 171 assists), becoming the school’s all-time tackle leader. A starter in all 40 games during his career, he had a game-high 22 tackles (14 solo, eight assists) against Colgate on Sept. 27, 1997. Derrick Harmon\n\nTailback Derrick Harmon excelled on both the playing field and in the classroom. He was a two-time Academic All-American and made the Associated Press Division I-AA All-America second team as a senior.\n\nIn his final season, Derrick won the Asa Bushnell Award as the Ivy League's Player of the Year, after being named the league's Sophomore of the Year in 1981. He became only the fourth person in the history of the league to go over 1,000 yards in one season when he ran for 1,056 markers in seven Ivy games in 1983.\n\nA two-time All-Ivy first-team selection, Harmon rushed for 3,074 yards on 546 carries in three years and ranks third on Cornell's all-time rushing list and in career rushes.

He was drafted in the ninth round by the San Francisco 49ers and earned a Super Bowl ring in 1985 against the Miami Dolphins. Jerome \"Brud\" Holland\n\nThe college football Hall of Famer is known for much more than being the first black football player at Cornell. A two-time first-team All-American at end, Holland scored 10 career touchdowns, and later watched as his son, Joe Holland ‘78, became one of the school’s all-time leading rushers. But it was his greatness as a statesman that earned him international fame.\n\nThere was a special warmth to his youth in Auburn, N.Y. His 12 brothers and sisters called him \"Brud\" and his father instilled the first seeds of self-respect and knowledge. Brud Holland once said, \" I was born with slightly deformed legs. My grandmother, Julia Bagby, massaged my legs daily, and they became normal.\" Holland worked his way through Cornell as a dishwasher and furnace-tender. He was a straight-A student and two-time All-America end. In 1937 he scored twice on Colgate on end-around plays and once on a pass reception. In 1938 he went 57 yards on an end- around, again against Colgate. He graduated with highest honors in 1939, obtained a master's degree at Cornell in 1941 and Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950. The Associated Press in 1938 said of Holland the football star: \"He wrecked interference, blocked and tackled, snagged passes and carried the ball.\"\n\nHONORS AND TITLES\n\n• U.S. ambassador to Sweden\n\n• Chairman American Red Cross\n\n• Chairman Salvation Army\n\n• Chairman Planned Parenthood\n\n• First African American director of the New York Stock Exchange\n\n• 1985 Medal of Freedom Award (nation’s highest civilian award)\n\n• President of Hampton Institute\n\n• President of Delaware State\n\n• Trustee Emeritus, Cornell University\n\n• Sports Illustrated’s Silver Anniversary Award (outstanding contributions to American life) Eddie Kaw\n\nOne of Cornell’s great football halfbacks, Kaw was named to the All-America first team in 1921 and 1922, leading the Big Red to two undefeated, untied seasons and was declared the national champion both years.

At the age of 67, he returned to his permanent residence of Palo Alto, Calif., and served as an advisory coach at San Jose State from 1939-40.\n\nAfter coaching 44 All-Americans and introducing so many of the football practices that we still use today, Warner returned to his oil and water paints, and to his work bench. His imaginative mind produced the screen pass, the rolling block, the naked reverse, series plays and the unbalanced line. He also introduced the numbering of players, huddle, wearing of headgear, spiral punt and the blocking dummy. Warner was the only coach ever to actually invent a system of offense. \"Pop\" died on Sept. 7, 1954, at age 83, 25 years after founding the Pop Warner Youth Football League, which is still a mainstay for nearly all young football players.\n\nThirty-nine years after his death, Warner passed the late Amos Alonzo Stagg and became the second winningest coach in major college football.

On July 25, 1997, the U.S. Postal Service issued four stamps commemorating Warner, Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers, George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Paul \"Bear\" Bryant of the University of Alabama. Bill Warner\n\nWarner was the rock upon which Cornell built one of the best lines in the nation at the turn of the 20th century. He was hailed as a workhorse guard who rarely missed an assignment. He was a two-time first-team All-America selection, earning the honor in 1901 when Cornell went 11-1, and again in 1902. He was captain of the team as a junior and senior. Upon his graduation, he became the head coach at Cornell for the 1903 season, and his team opened with six straight shutouts and finished the campaign with a 6-3-1 record. He later coached at Colgate, North Carolina, Oregon, St. Louis University, and the Sherman Indian School at Riverside, Calif."
