The 27-year-old tight end was knocked to the turf of Toronto’s Exhibition Stadium by Saskatchewan defensive back Lorne Richardson, and linebacker Bill Manchuk landed on him a split-second later, delivering an elbow to the back of Gabriel’s helmet.\n\nToday’s officials would throw a penalty flag and penalize Manchuk for unnecessary roughness. Gabriel would likely be ordered to the sideline for assessment of a possible concussion. No flag was thrown on Nov. 28, 1976, though, and television images from the game posted online showed a woozy Gabriel bending over and putting his hands on his knees before heading back to the huddle. He never left the field.\n\n“I don’t know if (Manchuk) did it intentionally. I never assumed that, but he hit me late with his elbow across the back of the helmet, and it shows that,” Gabriel said in a recent interview. “That’s when I’m getting this dual feeling: seeing stars and (Rough Riders offensive tackle) Jim Coode saying, ‘Gabber, get back! Time’s running out!’ I had to bend over and just put my hands on my legs for a moment and look back at the referee. ‘What the hell? What does it take (to warrant a penalty call)?’ I’m trying to do that for my teammates, but it’s too late. He’s not going to make a decision at that point in the game.”\n\nThus the unpenalized late hit by Manchuk was just one several footnotes to Gabriel’s touchdown play.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAll 10 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nFor example, before The Catch, there was The Play Call.\n\nRough Riders coaches sent out wide receiver Gary Kuzyk with instructions to relay to Clements.\n\nHowever, the quarterback at the end of just his second CFL season didn’t want to hear from Kuzyk. Jeff Avery, another wide receiver on the field with the game on the line, said Clements had already begun his play call, so he stopped the receiver quickly and continued with his own choice.\n\nAccording to Gabriel, it was Rob-I-Fake-34-Tight-End-Flag.\n\nRob indicated “right” and Rob-I instructed Gabriel to station himself at the right side of the offensive line. “I” stood for “I formation,” with fullback John Palazeti immediately behind Clements and running back Art Green at the back of that line of three. “Fake 34” indicated a fake handoff to Palazeti, the 3 back, for a run through the 4-hole in the offensive line between right guard and tackle.\n\nWhen you think about it, though, it would have been crazy for the Rough Riders to run the football. The 31 seconds remaining after Gabriel was tackled by Richardson were already dwindling as Clements addressed his teammates and directed them back to the line of scrimmage, and the rest could have disappeared altogether if another play ended with a tackle inside the boundaries of the field.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe only option, really, was a pass play. “Tight-End-Flag” designated Gabriel as intended receiver and instructed the man who had been seeing stars to fake toward the goalpost before running toward the flag at the rear corner of the end-zone.\n\nThis, in Gabriel’s description, was where Fate smiled again upon the eastern Riders. Saskatchewan’s defence was in an “inverted” alignment, so end Jesse O’Neal was lined up outside of linebacker Roger Goree, and that made it easier for Gabriel to break free at the line of scrimmage.\n\nAs he approached Provost, Gabriel planted hard with his right foot and took a few strides toward the goalpost in the centre of the field. After the Roughriders’ safety took that bait, Gabriel crossed back to his right and headed toward the flag.\n\nClements accepted the snap from centre Donn Smith and skipped a couple of steps to his right. Guard Tom Schuette blocked low, dropping Roughriders defensive tackle Tim Roth to the turf. Coode also blocked low, but O’Neal stayed on his feet, so fullback Palazeti, after carrying out his fake, threw a chip blow to keep the end from rushing at Clements. With time to throw, Clements lofted the ball into the air, and Gabriel ran away from Provost. Saskatchewan cornerback Ray Odums, whose primary assignment had been to cover Kuzyk, drifted in Gabriel’s direction to help out Provost, but was also too late.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGabriel made the catch, took two strides and spiked the ball backwards over his head with both hands. He was quickly surrounded by raucous fans and Rough Riders teammates, starting with receivers Avery and Jim Foley, Kuzyk and Palazeti.\n\n“At a time like that, when you’ve got to score a touchdown, you can’t run the ball. You run and you get tackled, the game’s over,” said George Brancato, head coach of the staff whose call was over-ruled by Clements. “It wasn’t the greatest call in the world, but it worked. The Saskatchewan defence bit on it. They saw the fake run, the defensive guys came up and didn’t look at Tony and Tony was in behind them right away.”\n\nGabriel said one thing that flashed through his head after the catch was that he had helped himself and his teammates to the winners’ shares of Grey Cup game bonuses: $6,000 each.\n\n“If you’ve heard me say this before, then I apologize,” Gabriel said, “but I said, ‘Do you know what I would have done had I dropped the ball? I would have kept running out of the end-zone. I would have retired right there. Being the scapegoat of ’76, I don’t think I’d be to too many hero banquets. I don’t think they do that for scapegoats.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGabriel wasn’t a scapegoat that day, though, but he was a blocker on the kicking team, so he pulled up his socks and settled near the end of the line in front of Gerry Organ, who added the one-point convert to give Ottawa its 23-20 advantage. After that Gabriel settled into place near the Rough Riders’ 45-yard line, joining his colleagues on the kickoff-cover team.\n\nIt was, after all, an era when CFL teams had 32-man active rosters, more than one-third less than the current limit of 44, so even the star tight end who had days earlier been named the CFL’s outstanding Canadian player for the 1976 season had to do his part on special teams.\n\nThat Fake Punt\n\nGerry Organ could have been a scapegoat if he had been stopped short on a fake-punt run nobody else knew was coming. Instead, it was a momentum-changer.\n\nA Rough Rider since 1971, Organ said he had noticed during the first two quarters that Saskatchewan’s punt-return unit applied little to no pressure before he kicked the ball. So, during half-time, he called an impromptu meeting with Brancato and linebacker Mark Kosmos, the special-teams captain.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOrgan pointed out the lack of a rush and the difficulty of gaining more than 20 to 25 yards on any punt into the stiff breeze. He also suggested a fake punt and asked for an endorsement.\n\n“Of course, George just looked at me with these wide eyes and walked away, didn’t make a single comment,” Organ said recently. “Obviously the answer was, ‘I’m not touching that question. Goodbye.’\n\n“Mark, to this day … in fun, he’ll deny that I ever spoke to him, which is obviously an ongoing, humorous feud that he and I still have to this day.”\n\nLate in that third quarter, Foley, under modest defensive pressure from Provost, had been unable to hold onto a pass from Clements, so it was third-and-10 at Ottawa’s 37-yard line. Brancato ordered the kicking team onto the field. “Punt the damn ball.”\n\nSo, officially, nobody on either team knew what would come next, maybe not even Organ, but he caught the snap, looked up and saw no Roughriders in his path. He took some short steps to his right and then decided to run for a first down.\n\nGabriel, standing opposite Saskatchewan’s Rhett Dawson at the line, started his own sprint down the field to cover what he thought would be a punt flying overhead. That left Kosmos to block Dawson as Organ got going, but Kosmos released his block and Dawson threw himself at Organ’s feet near the 45-yard line.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat was two yards short of the first-down marker. If Organ had hit the turf there, Saskatchewan would have taken possession of the football in Ottawa territory with the wind at its back and a 20-16 lead.\n\n“I just kept on running and showed my deceptive speed. That’s Canadian Football League terminology for slow,” Organ said. “But I ran 52 yards, ran through a crowd, actually switched the ball from my right arm to my left, doing all the right things. I passed (teammate) Bill Hatanaka — he and I have a joke about it, too — initially because he was trying to just hold up his block as well on the punt. But, 20-30 yards down the field, I noticed that Bill Hatanaka passed me to try to throw another block.”\n\nBrian O’Hara, the intended punt returner, finally tackled Organ at the Roughriders’ 21-yard line. Clements threw an interception on the next play, but, instead of taking possession at Ottawa’s 45, Saskatchewan was at its own 15. The offence directed by veteran quarterback Ron Lancaster gained some yards, but the quarter ended soon after, so Bob Macoritti had to punt into the wind that had caused Organ to ponder his fake in the first place, and the change in field position proved to be critical in the fourth quarter.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOrgan jokes that he played 12 CFL seasons overall, but the highlight video he shows during speaking engagements lasts 108 seconds and consists only of a 40-yard field goal early in the third quarter and that 52-yard run.\n\n“It’s hilarious to watch it. It was a very cool moment,” he said. “but the really big story is that George and Mark didn’t want anything to do with the discussion at halftime, but somehow I still did it. I could just have avoided it, saying I didn’t get any green light from anybody, but it was just one of those intuitive athletic (actions). Athletes do strange things in strange moments and sometimes it backfires, but in that case it worked great.”\n\nBreaking one for a touchdown\n\nBill Hatanaka, who caught up to and passed Gerry Organ during his 52-yard jaunt down the field, had an opportunity to throw a block that might have the Rough Riders veteran kicker to reach the end-zone for a touchdown, but the Roughriders’ Brian O’Hara eluded Hatanaka before making the tackle.\n\nMaybe Hatanaka was still tired after establishing what was then a Grey Cup record with a 79-yard punt return for a touchdown in the first quarter. It was the only other touchdown the Rough Riders scored that day.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Just a dumb rookie” from Toronto’s York University, Hatanaka had bought so many Grey Cup game tickets for family and friends “that I would have been in the hole if we had lost the game,” referring to the difference between the winners’ and losers’ bonuses.\n\nHe said the Rough Riders punt-return team had come close to “breaking one” for a touchdown in previous contests and its members were positive they could make something happen against the Roughriders. A return down the left side of the field was called, so, after the kick by the left-footed Bob Macoritti, Hatanaka’s teammates retreated into their designated positions.\n\nThe 40-yard punt landed on the turf and bounced into the arms of Hatanaka at Ottawa’s 31-yard line. Wayne Tosh blocked Ken McEachern, the “contain” man at the edge of Saskatchewan’s cover unit, and Hatanaka cut to his right to avoid an arm tackle by another Roughrider before sprinting between his wall of blockers and the sideline. He stepped past Macoritti at the Roughriders’ 45-yard line, pulled away from Lou Clare and avoided a desperation attempt by Randy Graham at the five-yard line before completing his run into the record books.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I remember working hard to get by that player and it was a full-on sprint to the end-zone and I remember working hard to keep my stride, to keep my breathing calm, and I just thought, ‘We’re going to get this done. This is going all the way,'” Hatanaka said. “To this day, the vision I have of each of my teammates in slow motion taking on each one of the Saskatchewan Roughriders was an amazing thing to recall.\n\n“I’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of that over the years, as a matter of fact. It has been a lot of fun to recount that with all sorts of people I’ve met in the business world and in personal relationships. In particular, I have to say I get the gears whenever I meet someone from Saskatchewan. They definitely ride me about that game and that year and we have a lot of fun going back and forth on that.”\n\nHatanaka played in the CFL until 1979, when he was a Hamilton Tiger-Cat, so the 1976 Grey Cup game was the only one in which he played. He has since attended others in Toronto and Montreal, but business commitments kept him from following the Redblacks, the national capital’s newest franchise, to Winnipeg for their failed bid to win a title last November.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe vows, however, that he’ll be at the 2017 Grey Cup game in Ottawa — CFL commissioner Jeffrey Orridge will eventually make that long-awaited and long-expected announcement — “and I’m going to be cheering for the Redblacks.”\n\nThere’s one final note worth making about Hatanaka’s punt return, still third-longest in Grey Cup history behind only an 82-yard romp by Baltimore’s Chris Wright in 1995 and an 80-yarder by Toronto’s Jimmy Cunningham a year after that.\n\nHatanaka didn’t know it, but a review of the video from the television broadcast revealed that the Roughrider whose outstretched arm wasn’t long enough to keep Hatanaka from breaking through the first wave of would-be tacklers and sprinting along the sideline was none other than Ted Provost, the same Ted Provost who would bite on Tony Gabriel’s fake to the post and be forever remembered for that.\n\ngholder@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter.com/HolderGord\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
