        "text": "Kickoff for Saturday’s game is set for 5 p.m. The Green Zone Game Day pre-game show is to start at 3 p.m.\n\nIn the battle of the Dickensons — Dave Dickenson is the head coach of the Stamps — the younger brother has emerged victorious more times than not against the older brother.\n\nCraig has a 1-6 regular-season record against his brother, but also has one playoff win.\n\nRiders linebacker Derrick Moncrief, who is in his sixth CFL season, knows any sort of ground you can make up in the CFL’s West Division can pay dividends down the road.\n\n“In the West, every game counts. It doesn’t matter if it’s early in the season or late in the season,” said Moncrief, who will make his season debut after missing time due to a shoulder injury.\n\n“You want to trend up as the season goes but you want to impose your will. You want to get turnovers (and) you want to make sure you win a football game to get that home playoff spot.\n\n“That’s what we want to do.”\n\nRiders quarterback Trevor Harris will look to build off his best game as a member of the team, throwing for 413 yards and three touchdowns in the loss to the Bombers.\n\nThe 37-year-old veteran said there are lessons a team can take away from a loss.\n\n“Each game is a life in itself and if you take the things you watch on film and you don’t learn from them regardless of win, loss or draw — whatever it would be — then shame on you,” Harris said. “This is pro football and everyone is going to prove every week. That’s why it always matters who is playing their best football late in the season.\n\n“To me, it’s about who we are becoming in the process, and we learned a lot from that game. We will take some things away from it and hopefully just get better and better every week.”\n\nWhile the Stamps will be without defensive back Titus Wall (hamstring) this week, Harris and the Riders’ offence will need to deal with former CFL all-star Tre Roberson. So far, the 30-year-old cornerback has seven tackles and one interception on the year.\n\n“He’s hyper-athletic and not only that, him and (Riders corner) Nic Marshall see the game the same because they used to play quarterback,” Harris said. “They do a good job of being able to plan and read and understand what you’re trying to do with your eyes and shoulders as a quarterback.\n\n“(Roberson is) just a really smart player on top of being really athletic.”\n\nOn offence, the Riders are dealing with some injuries that could have an effect on what they want to do.\n\nReceiver Juwan Brescacin (shoulder) has been added to the six-game injured list and running back Frankie Hickson (shoulder) has been put on the one-game injured list.\n\nSlotback Kendall Watson will make his CFL debut in the game and Canadian running back Thomas Bertrand-Hudon could see some more action.\n\nCentre Peter Godber is a game-time decision as he deals with an illness.\n\nThe Riders will make some changes at offensive tackle as well. Jerald Hawkins will start at left tackle and Colin Kelly will get the start on the right side.\n\nHawkins left the Riders’ training camp prior to the team’s second pre-season game to attend to a family matter. Kelly, who has 90 career CFL starts under his belt, was suspended by the CFL for two games after testing positive for a banned substance.\n\nThe defensive side of the ball will see more changes as the unit battles injuries.\n\nWhile Moncrief and Marshall (shoulder) return to the lineup, the Riders will be without safety Jayden Dalke (back), defensive lineman DeMarcus Christmas (knee), defensive back Rodney Clemons (ankle), and defensive end Nic Dheilly (head) as they have all been added to the injury list. Defensive back Jeremy Clark was also added to the injury list though he practised all week.\n\nDefensive back Nelson Lokombo will start at safety with Charbel Dabire starting along the defensive line. Deontai Williams will start at cornerback for a second week in a row, replacing Clark.\n\nThe defence will try to stop a Calgary offence that’s trying to move on from the Bo Levi Mitchell era. Mitchell was traded to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the off-season, making way for Jake Maier to become the new franchise pivot.\n\nWhile Maier struggled in Week 1, he bounced back last week against Ottawa, throwing for 332 yards.\n\n“He can make every throw in the pocket and he’s a great leader in that team,” Moncrief said. “They put a lot of trust in him as they moved on from the other quarterback situation that they had. That tells you everything you need to know.”\n\nThe Stamps could also rely on their running game to counteract a strong Saskatchewan pass rush.\n\nWhile starter Ka’Deem Carey is injured, Dedrick Mills filled the role well, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown against Ottawa."
