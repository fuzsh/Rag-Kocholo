        "text": "Collaros engineers late scoring drive to salvage victory over cellar-dwelling Tiger-Cats\n\nJeff Hamilton 8 minute read\n\nIt was a quiet night for Kenny Lawler until the game was on the line.\n\nThe veteran receiver, playing in his second game back from a broken arm, reeled in a 10-yard catch for a touchdown in the dying seconds to edge the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 26-23, in front of a sold-out crowd at Princess Auto Stadium Friday night.\n\nFacing a second-and-goal from Hamilton’s 10-yard line, with 21 seconds left on the clock, quarterback Zach Collaros delivered a sharp pass to Lawler, who before the game-clinching score had just one catch for seven yards. It capped off a drive that began on Winnipeg’s 38-yard line, lasted 11 plays and registered 62 yards, as the Bombers staved off a late comeback by the Ticats, who had erased a 13-point lead, only to give it up at the worst possible time.\n\n“Basically, it came down to who wanted it more, what’s in your heart,” Lawler said after the game. “We had to go out there, put our hard hat on and pull it out, and that’s what happened.”\n\nRead\n\nBlue need to strike early and often\n\nJeff Hamilton 8 minute read\n\nThe Winnipeg Blue Bombers hope to keep the good times rolling when they welcome the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to Princess Auto Stadium Friday night.\n\nThe Bombers are winners of two consecutive games for just the second time this season, with the chance to improve their streak to three for the first time in 2024. The recent victories, both of which have come against the B.C. Lions, have improved the Blue and Gold to 4-6 and catapulted them back into the West Division playoff race, with just five points separating first and last place.\n\n“It’s the wild, wild West and it’s anybody’s game right now,” Bombers running back Brady Oliveira said following Thursday’s walk-through. “We still need to focus, obviously, one week at a time, come in here and continue to have good performances, stacking good performances onto good performances. I’m excited to see how this thing plays out.”\n\nMeanwhile, it hasn’t been much fun for the Ticats this year.\n\nRead\n\nArbitrator rules in favour of CFL’s indefinite suspension of Lemon\n\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press 5 minute read\n\nTORONTO - Shawn Lemon won't be returning to the Montreal Alouettes' lineup any time soon.\n\nThe CFL announced Wednesday an independent arbitrator had upheld its indefinite suspension of the defensive lineman for sports betting. The arbitrator’s decision is binding and could spell the end of Lemon's 13-year career as there was no indication regarding if or when the 36-year-old American could apply for reinstatement.\n\n\"It is clear this is an important issue,\" CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said. \"It speaks to the integrity of the game.\n\n\"It's why we've seen across the world of sports leagues have dealt with this harshly . . . as leagues, we watch each other because there are precedence issues.\"\n\nRead\n\nArgos star quarterback has a history of blowing second chances\n\nJeff Hamilton 8 minute read\n\nChad Kelly spoke for the first time Tuesday afternoon following the conclusion of a lengthy suspension by the Canadian Football League for violating its gender-based violence policy. Months earlier, an unidentified employee filed a wrongful dismissal suit against the Toronto Argonauts and Kelly, the team’s starting quarterback, accusing Kelly of harassing her while she was an athletic therapist, and when she complained to the team, they fired her. Allegations against Kelly included repeatedly asking her out on dates and, on at least one occasion, was aggressive in his behaviour towards her, which included threats of physical harm. The case was […]\n\nRead\n\nRedblacks victory would clinch CFL playoff berth for defending-champion Alouettes\n\nThe Canadian Press 2 minute read\n\nTORONTO - They're idle, but the Montreal Alouettes could still cement a CFL playoff berth this week.\n\nMontreal (10-1) would secure an East Division post-season spot if the Ottawa Redblacks (7-2-1) defeated the B.C. Lions (5-6) on Saturday.\n\nThe Alouettes would also punch their playoff ticket if Ottawa and B.C. tied and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (5-6) beat the Saskatchewan Roughriders (5-5-1) on Sunday.\n\nMontreal can't fall lower than third in the East Division based upon Hamilton’s 2-9 record. The Alouettes could only be denied a post-season berth by way of a crossover.\n\nRead\n\nRedblacks quarterback Brown, Lions defensive lineman Covington net CFL weekly honours\n\nThe Canadian Press 2 minute read\n\nTORONTO - Ottawa Redblacks quarterback Dru Brown and tackle Christian Covington of the B.C. Lions were the top offensive and defesive players in the CFL honour roll Tuesday.\n\nBrown captured top offensive honours with a grade of 86.1 for his performance in Ottawa's 34-27 home win over B.C. Brown completed 28-for-37 passes for 390 yards and three touchdowns in the game.\n\nCovington was the top-graded defensive player (89.6) for his play on that contest. He registered his first forced fumble and participated in 32 total defensive snaps.\n\nThe CFL honour roll highlights players in nine positions based on data points registered and compiled by Pro Football Focus, an American sports analytics company.\n\nRead\n\nAlouettes sign all-star wide receiver Austin Mack to four-year contract extension\n\nFrédéric Daigle, The Canadian Press 3 minute read\n\nMONTREAL - Austin Mack didn’t take long to make up his mind.\n\nAfter being released by the Atlanta Falcons on Aug. 12, there was only one place he wanted to play outside the NFL: with the Montreal Alouettes.\n\nThe all-star wide receiver rejoined the CFL club last week and signed a four-year contract extension through the 2028 season on Tuesday.\n\n\"For me and my family, I think we're ready to close that chapter,\" Mack said. \"And look forward to this deal as something to create something special here in Canada, and create a legacy.\n\nRead\n\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers to induct Charles Roberts into ring of honour\n\nThe Canadian Press 3 minute read\n\nWINNIPEG - The Winnipeg Blue Bombers will honour the franchise's all-time leading rusher next month.\n\nSeven-time all-star Charles Roberts, who led the CFL in rushing in 2003, '05 and '06, will be inducted into the team's ring of honour during the Sept. 7 Banjo Bowl against the Saskatchewan Roughriders at Princess Auto Stadium.\n\n\"This is a big deal for me, I’m humbled and I’m very appreciative that I’m being honoured as one of the legends of the organization,” Roberts said Monday in a release. \"All those years ago when I first came to Winnipeg it never dawned on me that I’d receive a call 20 years later informing that I’d be saluted in this way by being added to the ring of honour.\n\n“So many guys come up to Canada and want to use it to get back to the NFL. After my first year in Winnipeg, I didn’t want to be anywhere else because I was so comfortable thanks to the fans, my teammates, and the people in that community. I had found a home.”\n\nRead\n\nSpieker, Fajardo lead Alouettes to 21-17 comeback win over Elks\n\nDaniel Rainbird, The Canadian Press 5 minute read\n\nMONTREAL - Cody Fajardo and the Montreal Alouettes looked out of sync with a 17-6 halftime deficit against the Edmonton Elks on Sunday night, but head coach Jason Maas wasn’t sweating it.\n\nFajardo, wide receiver Cole Spieker and an unwavering Alouettes defence led a second-half comeback as league-leading Montreal defeated Edmonton 21-17 in nail-biting fashion for its fifth straight victory.\n\n\"We don't ever give up on anything, and we just learn,” Maas said. “We know it's a 60-minute game no matter what the score says at halftime, you got to play for 60 minutes in this league and finish games.\n\n\"We do an incredible job of doing that.”\n\nRead\n\nRedblacks lose Acklin, but beat Lions 34-27 to remain unbeaten at home\n\nLisa Wallace, The Canadian Press 5 minute read\n\nOTTAWA - The Ottawa Redblacks earned a hard-fought 34-27 victory over the B.C. Lions on Saturday night, but the win was bittersweet.\n\nAfter watching teammate Jaelon Acklin leave the field by ambulance, the Redblacks were determined to get a win, but celebrations were muted as they thought of their injured teammate.\n\nWith 8:33 remaining in the fourth quarter, both teams were shaken when Acklin, who had jumped to catch a pass, collided with T.J. Lee and fell awkwardly, remaining motionless on the field.\n\nOn the ensuing play, the Redblacks were able to extend their lead after Dustin Crum muscled his way across the one-yard line to take a 34-24 lead.\n\nRead\n\nCody Fajardo starts at QB as league-leading Alouettes host surging Elks\n\nDaniel Rainbird, The Canadian Press 5 minute read\n\nMONTREAL - The league-leading Montreal Alouettes are getting even better on Sunday.\n\nGrey Cup MVP Cody Fajardo returns as Montreal’s starting quarterback against the Edmonton Elks at Molson Stadium after missing four games with a hamstring injury.\n\nLed by Davis Alexander, who rose from third-string QB to starter, the Alouettes (9-1) have won four straight since Fajardo left in the first quarter of a 37-18 loss to the Toronto Argonauts on July 11.\n\n“It just goes to show how talented this team is,” Fajardo said. “To have a deep, talented quarterback room, it's just beneficial for the team. And so it's just been really exciting, but nothing's going to change.\n\nRead\n\nBombers scratch past Ticats 26-23 with late TD drive\n\nJudy Owen, The Canadian Press 5 minute read\n\nWINNIPEG - Kenny Lawler believes determination and desire pushed the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to a 26-23 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on Friday.\n\n“Basically, it came down to who wanted it more, what’s in your heart,” Lawler said. “We had to go out there, put our hard hat on and pull it out, and that’s what happened.”\n\nLawler caught a 10-yard pass in the end zone with 19 seconds remaining as the Blue Bombers avoided a Tiger-Cats’ comeback.\n\nHamilton trailed 16-3 at halftime, but a pair of Greg Bell rushing touchdowns helped the visitors build a 23-19 lead with 1:48 left in the CFL contest.\n\nRead\n\nLions, Redblacks meet in battle of second-place teams moving in different directions\n\nLisa Wallace, The Canadian Press 5 minute read\n\nOTTAWA - On paper the Ottawa Redblacks and B.C. Lions appear to be headed in opposite directions.\n\nThe Redblacks (6-2-1) are undefeated in their last five games, while the Lions (5-5-0) are mired in a four-game losing streak.\n\nDespite their respective success and struggles, both teams sit second in their division. The Lions are just one point back of Saskatchewan in the West, while Ottawa trails Montreal, first overall, by five points in the East.\n\nWhen the teams meet Saturday night at TD Place the Lions will be desperate to put an end to this brutal stretch of games and Nathan Rourke will be looking to rebound from last week’s less than impressive performance against Winnipeg.\n\nRead\n\nHajrullahu’s single earns Argos 20-19 home win in Kelly’s ’24 debut\n\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press 6 minute read\n\nTORONTO - On a night of missed opportunities, fittingly an errant field-goal try made Chad Kelly's season debut a winning one.\n\nLirim Hajrullahu's single on the game's final play earned Toronto a wild 20-19 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders on Thursday night. After making his first four attempts, Hajrullahu missed from 40 yards out but the ensuing single earned the Argos (6-4) their fifth home victory in six games.\n\n\"First game back I had a lot of nervousness in me and we came out on top,\" Kelly said. \"Obviously a win is a win.\n\n\"It was one point (Hajrullahu's single) but it's a huge win against coach Mace (Saskatchewan head coach Corey Mace) who knows all of these players, he knows what we're good at and what we're bad at.\"\n\nRead"
