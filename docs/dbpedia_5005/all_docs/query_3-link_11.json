        "text": "On behalf of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, I am the keeper of an album that is old and new.\n\nNew from the standpoint that it arrived at Mosaic Stadium on Friday.\n\nOld because this classic collectible dates back to 1963.\n\nFor the longest time, Post Cereals’ Canadian Professional Football Album was carefully stored away in a trunk that belonged to Lillian Glencross.\n\nAfter Lillian passed away in 2000, her son Pete sorted through his mother’s prized possessions and found, among other items, the CFL album and the accompanying player cards.\n\n“I had it up on a bookshelf at home,” Pete Glencross said on Friday after he and his wife were kind enough to drop off the album. “Then I heard you on the SportsCage (on CKRM) and told Karen, ‘I think I’m going to give this to Mr. Vanstone.’ ”\n\nPete proceeded to leave a message at the Roughriders’ office. I returned his call and was soon informed of the aforementioned treasure from 1963.\n\nI suggested to Pete that he might want to contact a sports collectibles expert to determine the value of the album before donating it to the team.\n\n“It might be worth a lot of money,” I recall telling Pete, “and I wouldn’t want to cost you a trip to Hawaii.”\n\nSo he made an inquiry, thought things over for a few days, and decided that his original offer would stand. We arranged to meet outside the stadium late Friday afternoon.\n\nAt the designated time, Pete emerged from his truck and handed me a keepsake that, until a week ago, I didn’t even know existed.\n\nAfter thanking Pete profusely, I hurried back to the office and began flipping through page after page.\n\nI was instantly reminded of 1971, when a grocery chain distributed a CFL sticker album and set. I couldn’t wait for Mom to return from the supermarket with the latest additions and, for good measure, I ate all the fish sticks as well.\n\nA mere half-century (and change) later, I felt like the seven-year-old version of myself, the grey hair being an afterthought for the moment.\n\nThere was the Jackie Parker — as a member of the Toronto Argonauts. He is most identifiable with the Edmonton Football Club, but there were other stops (see also: B.C. Lions).\n\nThe end zone was a frequent stop during the heyday of Ol’ Spaghetti Legs. He was capable of scoring a touchdown on a run, a reception or a return — when he wasn’t throwing touchdown passes, that is.\n\nFlipping to another page, I was greeted by the smiling face of Russ Jackson.\n\nAt the time, the Ottawa Rough Riders employed Jackson and another future Hall of Fame quarterback, Ron Lancaster.\n\nWould the album contain a Ronnie card? No such luck. In fact, there wasn’t even a Ronnie spot, because he was not among the 18 Ottawa players selected for the album — which was printed just before The Little General was traded to Saskatchewan.\n\nThe turning of pages continued as I was greeted by legend after legend.\n\nHal Patterson. Bernie Faloney. Joe Kapp. Willie Fleming. Ken Ploen. Leo Lewis. Charlie Shepard. Herb Gray. George Dixon. Earl Lunsford. Dick Shatto. Whit Tucker. Ron Stewart.\n\nI purposely skipped past the Roughriders pages on the first run-through, wanting to save them for last.\n\nFinally, I gave myself a chance to take a close look at the football cards of Bill Clarke, Jack Gotta, Billy Gray, Neil Habig, Bob Ptacek, Ray Purdin, Don Walsh and Dale West.\n\nSpaces were also allocated for Ron Atchison, Clair Branch, Bill Burrell, Larry Dumelie, Garner Ekstran, Len Legault, Ted Urness and Reg Whitehouse.\n\nThe lack of a full set wasn’t the slightest concern. What is football, after all, without an incompletion?\n\nThe opportunity to hold one of these cards would have felt like a lottery win before I was informed of the album’s existence.\n\nJust seeing it, holding it, was an experience.\n\nAll the pictures are in full colour, from the era of black and white.\n\nFrom a Green and White perspective, this piece of memorabilia was issued shortly before Ronnie, George Reed and Hugh Campbell emerged as stars in Saskatchewan.\n\nI was reminded of Gluey Hughie, though, while marvelling at the enduring strength of an adhesive that has affixed the football cards to the pages for 60-plus years.\n\nI, too, am attached to the album, because I can’t seem to put it down."
