        "text": "Beloved actor and former CFL linebacker Carl Weather passed away Thursday in his sleep, according to his family, at the age of 76.\n\nWeathers is best known for his portrayal of Apollo Creed in the “Rocky” franchise. He also recently had a prominent role in the hit “Star Wars\" series “The Mandalorian” and starred in the Adam Sandler hit “Happy Gilmore.\"\n\nWeathers also had a career in professional football, playing in both the CFL and NFL. Coming out of San Diego State, he played in parts of two seasons for the Oakland Raiders until being released in 1971. Weathers signed with the BC Lions, playing in 18 games through the 1973 season. He retired from pro football in 1974.\n\nThe Lions paid tribute to Weathers on social media Friday.\n\n“We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Carl Weathers,” according to the family statement. “Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life.\"\n\nEdmonton Elks Sign Linebacker Romeo McKnight\n\nThe Edmonton Elks kept their focus on the front lines by signing defensive lineman Romeo McKnight on Friday.\n\nMcKnight makes his return to a CFL roster after missing the 2023 season. He was a member of the Calgary Stampeders in 2022, recording seven tackles and one sack in four games. The Stampeders released him during training camp ahead of last season.\n\nMcKnight went undrafted in the 2021 NFL Draft and was signed by the Cleveland Browns. He had a short stint with the team before being released.\n\nHe played his last collegiate season with Charlotte in 2020 and was named an honorable mention All-Conference USA after recording 24 tackles, five tackles for loss, and 1.5 sacks in six games.\n\nHe played at Illinois State in 2018 and 2019. He had 111 total tackles, 15 sacks, five pass deflections, and two forced fumbles in 26 games for the 49ers.\n\nEdmonton announced the signing of offensive lineman Patrick Davis on Thursday.\n\nMontreal Alouettes Sign Linebacker Myles Manalo\n\nThe Grey Cup champion Montreal Alouettes announced an agreement with 24-year-old linebacker Myles Manalo.\n\nManalo (6-2, 230) played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from 2021-23. He totaled two special teams tackles.\n\nThe Burlington, Ont. Native was drafted by Hamilton in the sixth round of the 2021 CFL Draft (54th total).\n\nManalo played 21 games over two seasons for the Western University Mustangs (2017 and 2019), registering 70 total tackles, 6.5 tackles for loss, one fumble recovery, one interception and two knockdowns. He helped Western capture the 2017 Vanier Cup.\n\n“We are adding depth to our Canadian ratio,” Als general manger Danny Maciocia said. “Myles has been in the CFL for the past three seasons, he knows our league well and we are happy to have him join our team.”\n\nFree-Agent Running Back Priority for Alouettes\n\nThe Montreal Alouettes front office has been clear about wanting to “reload” the defending Grey Cup champions in 2024.\n\nTo that end, general manager Danny Maciocia plans to meet with running back William Stanback before the start of free agency. Stanback, 29, is coming off another productive season, running for 800 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHe rushed for 68 yards and a score in the Grey Cup victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Stanback has spent five seasons total with the Als, coming back to the franchise in 2020 after a stint with the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nMontreal has 22 potential free agents. Free agency opens Feb. 13.\n\nBlue Bombers QB Wants to Keep Gang Together\n\nAfter falling 13 seconds short of another Grey Cup title, Winnipeg Blue Bombers quarterback Zach Collaros made a plea to bring the gang back together.\n\nSo for his teammates going into free agency, consider how good it is in Winnipeg before moving on.\n\n“The grass isn’t always greener,” Collaros told TSN earlier this week. “I put that in the ears of a lot of guys.”\n\nThe Bombers have been to four consecutive Grey Cups, which is a feat not seen in the CFL in more than 40 years. Winnipeg has lost the last two, including 28-24 to the Montreal Alouettes on a touchdown pass in the final seconds.\n\nBombers Running Back Considering NFL Move\n\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers star Brady Oliveira could be leaving the defending West Final champs and go the NFL a shot, according to TSN reporter John Lu.\n\nThe free-agent-to-be running back is considering trying out with NFL teams to “potentially realize a lifelong dream.” Oliveira also said his return to the Winnipeg will be partially dependent on the continuity of the Blue Bombers offensive line.\n\nOliveira, 26, was recently received the Most Outstanding Canadian award after leading the CFL in rushing yards with 1,534 yards and rushing touchdowns with nine in 18 games. He’s been Winnipeg’s lead back for the last two seasons.\n\nThe Bombers lost 28-24 in the Grey Cup to the Montreal Alouettes.\n\nHow to Watch Grey Cup\n\nThe 110th Grey Cup between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Montreal Alouettes is Sunday, with kickoff slated for 6 p.m. ET.
