        "text": "Article content\n\nIn 1966 Vancouver authorities decided to hold the Grey Cup parade at night.\n\nThey would come to regret it. The actual parade went well, drawing 150,000 people to a 20-block route downtown on Nov. 25, 1966. But afterwards, some of the revellers went wild, sparking a riot.\n\n“More than 300 persons were arrested Friday night and early today as billy-swinging police fought three pitched battles with screaming, bottle-throwing mobs who turned Grey Cup eve celebrations into a riot,” Jes Odam reported in The Vancouver Sun.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“Street signs were uprooted, flags and decorations torn down, windows smashed and ornamental refuse signs torn from their steel supports.”\n\nOn Nov. 28 the Province reported the final tally of arrests was 443, then ran a list of the people charged.\n\n“Police have charged 251 with being drunk in a public place, 162 with unlawful assembly, seven with obstructing police, one with assault on a policeman,” said a story that ran with the list.\n\n“Four with possession of an offensive weapon, five with impaired driving, two with theft, one with wilful damage, one with dangerous driving, one with being in a dwelling unlawfully and one, a minor, with being in possession of liquor.”\n\nA quick scan of the names shows that most of the people arrested were young men. But some women were arrested, and at least one senior, 75-year-old Axel Wallin of Aldergrove. (His 1972 death record says he was a retired logger.)\n\nThe story of the actual Grey Cup game (where Saskatchewan beat Ottawa 29-14) was relegated to the sports pages, as local newspapers concentrated on the riot.\n\n“Deputy police chief John Fisk blamed staging of the Grey Cup parade on Friday night, rather than Saturday morning as in past years, for starting the trouble early and concentrating the hoodlum element in a relatively small downtown area,” Odam wrote in The Sun.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“But Mayor Bill Rathie said … a police inspector at the scene told him the hoodlums did not converge on the area until an hour after the parade.”\n\nIn any event, it sounded pretty crazy.\n\n“Police trying to subdue the angry mobs were met with a hail of bottles from the crowd, many of which missed individual officers by inches,” Odam reported. “Others crashed into the sides and roofs of paddy wagons.\n\n“Fights developed as persons in the crowd tried to rescue arrested persons or those in the wagons tried to get out when doors were opened to a new arrival.”\n\nSt. John’s Ambulance workers set up a first aid post in the Hotel Vancouver to treat the injured.\n\n“Most of the injuries came during a battle between some occupants of the Devonshire Hotel, hurling water and glasses from windows overlooking the Georgia Street, and the crowd below, throwing bottles back up at the hotel windows,” Odam wrote.\n\n“At the end of the riot, the battle area was ankle-deep in broken glass in places in places, and special city crews were sent in to clear it for today’s traffic.”\n\nIt shouldn’t have come as a surprise that Grey Cup fans were unruly — three years earlier there had been a Grey Cup riot in Vancouver on Nov. 30, 1963.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Acts of violence on the playing field and downtown streets cast an unprecedented scar on Canada’s Grey Cup football final played here Saturday,” said a story in the Monday, Dec. 2 Sun.\n\n“At Empire Stadium, 36,465 fans winced when Hamilton lineman Angelo Mosca crippled B.C. Lions’ all-star halfback Willie Fleming.\n\n“Later, hoodlums downtown caused two riots. Shouting, cursing crowds estimated between 6,000 and 8,000 hurled countless beer bottles, beer glasses, firecrackers, eggs and tomatoes at police.”\n\nAccording to The Sun, 171 people were arrested in the 1963 riot. But Mosca’s hit on Fleming had more of a lasting impact.\n\nMosca flew through the air to hit Fleming when the Lions star was already on the ground, and perhaps out of bounds. With Fleming out, the Lions lost to Hamilton 21-10. Some think it was the dirtiest hit in Grey Cup history.\n\nLions quarterback Joe Kapp certainly didn’t forget it. Forty-eight years later, he got into a fight with Mosca during a luncheon at the 2011 Grey Cup festival in Vancouver. Kapp was 73 at the time; Mosca was 74. A video clip of the fight went viral online.\n\njmackie@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nThis Week in History, 1916: A bus plunges into the frigid Fraser River, killing nine people\n\nThis Week in History, 1911: The Greatest Stadium in the World is proposed for Lost Lagoon\n\nMore news, fewer ads: Our in-depth journalism is possible thanks to the support of our subscribers.
