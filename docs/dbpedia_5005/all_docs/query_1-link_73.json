Veterans Committee candidates must still meet First Team All-America requirement.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME QUICK FACTS\n\nWhen the 2023 Hall of Fame Class is officially inducted in December, only 1,074 players and 230 coaches will have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame from the nearly 5.62 million who have played or coached the game during the past 153 years. In other words, less than two one-hundredths of a percent (.02%) of the individuals who have played the game have earned this distinction.\n\nFounded in 1947, The National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame inducted its first class of inductees in 1951. The first class included 32 players and 22 coaches, including Illinois' Red Grange, Notre Dame's Knute Rockne, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Carlisle (PA)'s Jim Thorpe.\n\n320 schools are represented with at least one College Football Hall of Famer.\n\nInduction for the 2023 Class will take place Dec. 5, 2023, during the 65th NFF Annual Awards Dinner Presented by Las Vegas.\n\n2023 College Football Hall of Fame Class Bios\n\nPAUL JOHNSON\n\nGeorgia Southern University (1997-2001), United States Naval Academy (2002-2007), Georgia Tech (2008-2018)\n\nHead Coach, 189-99-0 (65.6%)\n\nCapitalizing on his patented spread option offense – one of the most innovative offensive schemes in all of college football – Paul Johnson took three programs to the top of their respective conferences and the national rankings, winning two national titles, five conference championships and making 18 bowl appearances. The Newland, North Carolina, native now becomes the first coach from Georgia Southern, the fourth coach from Georgia Tech, and the fifth coach from Navy to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn his last stop at Georgia Tech, Johnson went 82-60 during 11 seasons, and the Yellow Jackets appeared in the final national rankings in 2008 (No. 22), 2009 (No. 13), and 2014 (No. 8). He led Georgia Tech to nine bowl games, including two New Year's Six bowls (Orange 2009, 2014). The Yellow Jackets appeared in three ACC Championship games during his tenure and won the ACC Coastal Division four times. His Georgia Tech teams led the ACC in rushing offense every year, and he was named ACC Coach of the Year three times (2008, 2009, 2014). He is the fourth-winningest coach at Georgia Tech behind John Heisman, William Alexander, and Bobby Dodd, who are all in College Football Hall of Fame. He coached two of nine total 10-win seasons and one of five 11-win seasons in Georgia Tech history.\n\nAt Navy, he inherited a program that had gone 1-20 in the previous two seasons. Johnson transformed the program, and during his six seasons in Annapolis, the Midshipmen went 45-29, landing at No. 24 in the Associated Press poll in 2004. He coached Navy to five bowl berths. Johnson went 11-1 in Commander-In-Chief's trophy games, winning five CIC trophies, which represents the annual winner of the Air Force-Army-Navy round-robin. He never lost to Army, going 6-0 against the Black Knights, and in 2007 he led Navy to a victory over Notre Dame for the first time in 43 years.\n\nIn his five seasons at Georgia Southern, the Eagles notched a 62-10 record, making five FCS playoff appearances and winning the FCS championship twice (1999 and 2000). He won the Southern Conference with Georgia Southern every year. He was twice named Southern Conference Coach of the Year (1997 and 1998) while heading the Eagles program. The 1999 team led the nation in scoring, rushing and total offense, and set the NCAA single-season record for average rushing yards per game (419.0) while breaking 197 schools records. Johnson was inducted into the Georgia Southern Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nJohnson coached 11 First Team All-Americans and one First Team Academic All-American. He coached 1999 Walter Payton Award winner and 2017 College Football Hall of Fame inductee Adrian Peterson at Georgia Southern and 2010 Burlsworth Trophy recipient Sean Bedford at Georgia Tech.\n\nJohnson was recognized as the CBS National Coach of the Year in 2008, the Bobby Dodd National Coach of the Year in 2004, and the Eddie Robinson Award winner as the I-AA National Coach of the Year in 1998. He was twice named the AFCA NCAA Division I-AA National Coach of the Year (1999, 2000).\n\nBefore becoming a head coach, Johnson served as offensive coordinator at Navy (1995-96), Hawaii (1987-94), Georgia Southern (1985-86) and as defensive line coach at Georgia Southern (1983-84). During his first stint at Georgia Southern, he was part of the coaching team that won consecutive FCS National Championships (1985-86) with the Eagles, and as the offensive coordinator at Georgia Southern, he mentored College Football Hall of Fame inductee Tracy Ham. His coaching career began with roles as an offensive coordinator at Avery County (N.C.) High School from 1979-80 and at nearby Lees-McRae College from 1981-82.\n\nHe has participated in a wide variety of charitable endeavors at each of his schools over the years, including his annual participation in the Bobby Dodd and Chick-fil-A charity golf tournaments, which raise money for the Bobby Dodd Foundation, WinShape Homes and the schools' scholarship funds. Johnson earned his bachelor's degree in physical education from Western Carolina in 1979 and his master's in health and physical education from Appalachian State in 1982.\n\nMONTE CATER\n\nLakeland [WI] (1981-1986), Shepherd [WV] (1987-2017)\n\nHead Coach, 275-117-2 (70.1%)\n\nAfter 37 years as a head coach, Monte Cater retired following the 2017 season as the nation's winningest active football coach among all NCAA levels, earning wins in more than 70 percent of his games and notching a total of 275 victories. The Shelbyville, Illinois, native now becomes the first person from either Lakeland University (WI) or Shepherd University (WV) to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nCater's teams made 13 postseason appearances (NAIA – 2, Division II – 11) during his career, and his teams appeared 16 times in the final national rankings. In 2015, he led Shepherd to the Division II championship game, finishing as the national runner-up. His teams claimed three Super Region One titles, and Shepherd led the nation in rush defense from 2011-2014. He coached 24 First Team All-America players, including 2007 Division II Rimington Award winner Ryan Pope, and he was named the Vince Lombardi Foundation Coach of the Year in 2015.\n\nNamed conference coach of the year 13 times during his career, he won at least a share of 17 conference titles (13 WVIAC and 4 MEC), giving him the most victories and coaching titles in West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) history. His teams went undefeated in conference play 11 times, and he coached 182 First Team All-Conference players.\n\nCater had only four losing seasons in his 31 years at Shepherd, and he posted winning records during each of his final 14 years with the Rams. He posted six undefeated regular seasons, including his last three from 2015-17, and his 245-93-1 (.724) record in 31 seasons at Shepherd makes him the winningest coach in school history.\n\nPrior to coming to Shepherd, Cater was the primary architect in reviving the Lakeland College program in Plymouth, Wisconsin. He led the Muskies to a 30-24-1 record in six seasons, winning three conference titles in his last four seasons while garnering Coach of the Year honors twice.\n\nCater began his collegiate coaching career as an offensive line coach at his alma mater, Millikin University (IL), where he would also serve as co-offensive coordinator. During his coaching stint at Millikin, the Big Blue posted a record of 28-8.\n\nCater has been inducted to the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame (2020), Shepherd Hall of Fame (2007) and the Millikin Athletics Hall of Fame (1999). He served as Shepherd's athletics director from 1993-2004, and he served as a member of the NCAA Division II Football Committee and the AFCA Board of Coaches. In addition to graduating with a degree in physical education from Millikin in 1971, Cater earned his Master's in physical education from Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.\n\nROY KRAMER\n\nCentral Michigan University (1967-77)\n\nHead Coach, 83-32-2 (71.8%)\n\nDuring his 11 seasons heading the Central Michigan program, Roy Kramer won an impressive 71.8 percent of his games, including the 1974 Division II National Championship. The Maryville, Tennessee, native now becomes just the second person from Central Michigan to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn his 11 seasons leading the Chippewas, Kramer compiled an 83-32-2 (.718) record. In 1974 Kramer was named NCAA National Coach of the Year after guiding the Chippewas to a 12-1 record and the Division II National Championship. In addition to the 1974 national title, Kramer twice led the Chippewas to IIAC titles in 1967 and 1968.\n\nAt CMU, Kramer produced one First Team All-American, defensive lineman Rick Newsome, and three First Team Academic All-Americans. He coached 38 First Team All-Conference selections, and he played an integral role in Central Michigan's move in 1975 to Division I-A as a member of the Mid-American Conference.\n\nKramer began his coaching career as a high school coach in Michigan, and during a decade in the high school ranks his teams won three state championships. In 1965, Kramer joined the staff at Central Michigan University as an assistant, coaching the freshman team to a 7-1 mark before being bumped up to head coach.\n\nKramer had hired Herb Deromedi as an assistant coach in 1967, promoting him to defensive coordinator in 1969. When Kramer left in 1977, Deromedi took over from his mentor as the CMU head coach, going on a run that would also land the protégé in the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2022, Central Michigan recognized the close connection between the two coaches and their outstanding contributions to the Chippewa program by officially naming its football venue as the Kramer/Deromedi Field at Kelly/Shorts Stadium.\n\nAfter his coaching career, Kramer served as the athletics director at Vanderbilt University from 1978-1990 and as commissioner of the Southeastern Conference from 1990-2002. He expanded the SEC from 10 to 12 members with the additions of South Carolina and Arkansas, and he created the SEC Football Championship Game, making the SEC the first conference to have a title game. During his time at the SEC, he also led the creation of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), the precursor to today's College Football Playoff system, pitting the two top-ranked teams in the country in a national title game.\n\nKramer graduated from Maryville College (TN), and he was a standout lineman on the football team as well as a wrestler. He played in the inaugural Tangerine Bowl (now the Citrus Bowl) on January 1, 1947, as a freshman for Maryville and losing to Catawba (NC) 31-6. During his senior year at Maryville, he was called to serve during the Korean War, delaying his graduation. After his service and graduating from Maryville in 1953, Kramer earned his master's degree with a double major in history and education from the University of Michigan in 1954.\n\nKramer has been inducted into the Central Michigan Athletics Hall of Fame (1987); Vanderbilt Athletics Hall of Fame (2008 as an inaugural member); Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame (1989); Alabama Sports Hall of Fame (2003). He has been awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (2008), NCFAA Contribution to College Football Award (2011); Duffy Daugherty Award (2013). The Men's and Women's SEC Athlete of the Year Award is presented annually as the Roy F. Kramer Award in his honor, and the NFF presented him its Distinguished American Award in 1998.\n\nMARK RICHT\n\nUniversity of Georgia (2001-15), University of Miami, FL (2016-18)\n\nHead Coach, 171-64 (72.8%)\n\nDuring his 18 years as a head coach, Mark Richt established himself as one of the top coaches in the history of college football, winning nearly 72 percent of his games at Georgia and Miami (FL) and never failing to make the postseason. The Omaha, Nebraska, native, and Boca Raton (FL) High School product, becomes the fifth coach from Georgia and the fifth Hurricanes coach to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRicht is one of only five coaches in FBS history to record 145 or more wins in their first 15 seasons, including Hall of Famers Bob Stoops, Barry Switzer and Tom Osborne. At the time of his retirement, he ranked No. 48 in the NCAA record books on the FBS all-time win list, behind only five coaches who had coached within five years of his retirement.\n\nRicht headed the Georgia program for 15 years, winning 74 percent of his games, which ranks first all-time among Bulldog coaches, and amassing an overall record of 145-51. His UGA win total is second to only Hall of Fame coach Vince Dooley. He led Georgia to 15 consecutive bowl appearances (10-5), including three New Year's Six bowls (Sugar Bowl 2002, 2005, 2007). His Georgia teams appeared 11 times in the Top 25 rankings, including seven Top 10 finishes (No. 3 in 2002, No. 7 in 2003, No. 7 in 2004, No. 10 in 2005, No. 2 in 2007, No. 5 in 2012, No. 9 in 2014). He led Georgia to two SEC titles, including the Bulldogs' first in 20 years in 2002 and then again in 2005. The Dawgs appeared in a total of five SEC championship games (2002, 2003, 2005, 2011, and 2012) during his tenure. He was named the 2002 and 2005 SEC Coach of the Year, and he is currently the 10th winningest coach in SEC history.\n\nReturning to his alma mater (where he played quarterback from 1979-82), Richt led Miami to a 26-13 record for the final three seasons of his head coaching career, securing three more bowl appearances, including one more New Year's Six Bowl, the Orange in 2017. Two of his three Miami teams posted top 20 finishes, the 2016 team at No. 20 and the 2017 team at No. 13. He led Miami to the 2017 ACC Coastal Division title, the school's first division title since joining the ACC, and he was named both the ACC Coach of the Year and the Walter Camp Coach of the Year in 2017.\n\nRicht coached 15 First Team All-Americans, including 2020 College Football Hall of Fame inductee David Pollack. He coached 52 First Team All-Conference players, and he also coached four NFF National Scholar-Athletes at UGA and one at Miami.\n\nRicht began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Florida State from 1985-86 after being hired by College Football Hall of Fame Coach Bobby Bowden.
