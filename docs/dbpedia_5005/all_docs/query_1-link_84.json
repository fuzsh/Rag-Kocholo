        "text": "Hail to the victors of Michigan.\n\nNobody has it better than the Wolverines, as Michigan beat the Washington Huskies, 34-13, in the College Football Playoff national championship game to win their first title since 1997.\n\nMichigan jumped out to a quick lead and didn’t look back, never trailing in the title game at NRG Stadium in Houston to capture its 12th national championship in program history.\n\nThe Michigan defense didn’t crack against a team that went into the game with a top 10 offense and the best passing offense in the country, led by Michael Penix Jr. Washington entered Monday averaging 37.6 points per game, but were held to a season-low in points, while Penix and company were never able to recover from playing-from-behind. Washington hung around for a majority of the game before the Wolverines pulled away in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe ground game led the way for the Wolverines offense, with the two-headed monster of Donovan Edwards and Blake Corum paving the way with all touchdowns for the offense. Corum ran the ball 21 times for 134 yards and two touchdowns, while Edwards had 104 yards on six rushes and two touchdowns. J.J. McCarthy played mistake free football at quarterback with 10-of-18 passes completed for 140 yards.\n\nDespite two suspensions from recruiting violations and a sign-stealing scandal, Jim Harbaugh captured his first national championship as head coach of the Wolverines and the first 15-0 season in the team’s long history. Questions will arise if this was Harbaugh’s final game with Michigan, but he and his team will celebrate the first title in 26 years in the meantime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWhat does Jim Harbaugh want? That will be the question on the minds of many throughout college football and the NFL as the Michigan coach weighs his options after winning the national championship with the Wolverines on Monday night. The allure of a potential return to the professional ranks is evident for a coach who has interviewed with teams in each of the last two years. With that in mind, here's our ranking of all five NFL franchises with a coaching vacancy, based on their potential fit for Harbaugh. — MIchael Middlehurst-Schwartz\n\nMichigan won its first national football title since 1997, defeating Washington behind 303 yards rushing and a defensive effort that held Heisman Trophy runner-up Michael Penix Jr. to just one touchdown pass.\n\nMaybe no national champion in the playoff era so firmly embodied the ethos of its head coach quite like the Wolverines, who shrugged off and embraced criticism in equal measure during this incredibly tumultuous season. But all eyes are on Harbaugh and his immediate future. He hired a new agent, Don Yee, who specializes in NFL contracts. He's again interviewed for NFL openings. Harbaugh's name has come up in connection with the Los Angeles Chargers, among other teams.\n\nTo ignore the itch and come back to Michigan will come with the increasingly likely chance that Harbaugh faces more penalties for NCAA violations that have occurred under his watch. After missing six games due to suspension during the regular season, he could be sidelined again next year. Is that what he wants? Has winning a national championship satisfied what he wanted to achieve at Michigan, freeing him up to join his brother in the NFL?\n\n\"That'll check the biggest box,\" Harbaugh said of the title. Should he leave, Harbaugh will pass on a program that views itself as bigger than one coach or player — the sort of deep self-confidence that might have flowered during Harbaugh's absence. Read Paul Myerberg's full story here.\n\nLet’s start talking about the 2024 college football season. Where will the Michigan Wolverines land in the USA TODAY Sports way-too-early Top 25 given the uncertainty over whether Jim Harbaugh returns for another year? Can the Huskies make another title run as members of the Big Ten? It’s a way-too-early list that’s heavy on the Big Ten and SEC. Those two powerhouse leagues make up the entire top five, nine of the top 10 and 15 of the 25 teams overall. Here’s our guess for how things will look at the end of next season.\n\nBetting odds, according to BetMGM, to win the 2024-25 College Football Playoff national championship:\n\nGeorgia +350\n\nAlabama +550\n\nOhio State +800\n\nMichigan +900\n\nTexas +900\n\nOregon +1000\n\nOn the field, the Michigan Wolverines left no doubt. So why, after it was all over, did Jim Harbaugh come into a press conference and feel compelled to say the following words: “We’re innocent.” I’m not here to tell you that Michigan’s long-awaited national title — its first outright championship since the Korean War — is tainted. The way Michigan closed out this season, beating the best college football had to offer this year under multiple clouds of uncertainty off the field, cannot be questioned. The best team won — and in the most important games, did so fair and square. But the Wolverines made it easy to be cynical about what should have been a great college football story. Read Dan Wolken's full column here.\n\nMichigan's Jim Harbaugh led college football coach bonus totals this season with $3 million — by far the largest single-season haul since USA TODAY Sports began tracking these amounts in 2019. He picked up $1 million for the Wolverines’ win in Monday night’s CFP title game after getting $500,000 for the team playing in the Big Ten Conference championship game, $1 million for winning the Big Ten title and $500,000 for being selected to play in the CFP semifinals.\n\nThis set of bonuses was introduced into Harbaugh’s contract with Michigan after the 2020 season, when he took a roughly 50% cut in his basic annual pay from the school to $4 million after the Wolverines had gone 9-4 in 2019 and 2-4 in the pandemic-affected 2020 season.\n\nHarbaugh claimed $2.225 million in 2021, although he redirected about $1.5 million of his bonus money to members of the Michigan athletics department who had taken pandemic-related pay cuts during an 11-month stretch of 2020 and 2021 and had remained on the payroll. He picked up $2.2 million last season. Read Steve Berkowitz's full story here.\n\nMichigan ends the year No. 1 in the USA TODAY Sports NCAA Re-Rank 1-133 after beating Washington 34-13 for the program’s first unshared national championship since 1948. Washington comes in at No. 2, followed No. 3 Georgia, No. 4 Texas and No. 5 Alabama. Michigan was ranked No. 2 in the preseason 1-133 behind Georgia. The Huskies were ranked No. 21. The same preseason re-rank had Pittsburgh at No. 25, so it’s obviously not an exact science. See Paul Myerberg's full Re-Rank here.\n\nThe four-team College Football Playoff period featured its share of controversy, from the inclusion of Ohio State in the debut field in 2014 to this year's exclusion of unbeaten Florida State. But by nearly every metric, the playoff has been a resounding success and one of the great advancements in the history of the sport.\n\nOn the field, the past decade has been defined by SEC dominance. Monday night marked the first time since 2014 that no SEC team had at least played for the national title. The conference won six during the four-team playoff: Alabama in 2015, 2017 and 2020, LSU in 2019, and Georgia in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThis era also saw the dramatic rise of Clemson, which unseated the Crimson Tide in 2016 and 2018. The 2018 team was the first in more than a century to go 15-0. The 12-team format will take the title race in a new and unpredictable direction. In one last look back at the past 10 years, here's how the champs of the four-team era rank among their peers.\n\nJim Harbaugh is so full of hyperbole on a regular basis that he will sometimes say outlandish things that go largely unnoticed. But it should probably be a little bit more of a conversation piece when Michigan’s coach (who was also a great Michigan quarterback) puts current Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy in the same sentence as a former Michigan quarterback who happens to be the most accomplished football player of all-time.\n\nAnd the crazy part is he might be right – at least in the way Harbaugh is framing the argument. Though his passing statistics are rarely spectacular and may not resonate 30 years from now when people look back at this Michigan team without the proper context, McCarthy may well be at the top of the list if the Wolverines beat Washington on Monday to win the school’s first national title since 1997. Read Dan Wolken’s full column here.\n\nEntering the 2023 season, Pro Football Focused projected Michigan running back Blake Corum as the second-best running back in the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nHow will Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh celebrate his team’s national championship? With a tattoo of course.\n\nEarlier in the season, Harbaugh had said he doesn’t have any tattoos, but would get one if his team went undefeated. Now that mission has been accomplished, he is standing by his word.\n\n\"I did say that to our players,\" Harbaugh told reporters after the game. \"I said if we go 15-0, I'm getting a tattoo. It's 15-0. I'm going to put it on my shoulder. I don't know if it's my left or right yet. I'm a right-handed quarterback, I'll probably get it on my right, and then an M too. An M that's maize and blue M.\"\n\nEven during the celebration, Harbaugh was asked about if he’d one day want to celebrate a Super Bowl victory. He didn’t want to think about it as there are rumors of him departing for the NFL after this season.\n\n\"I just want to enjoy this. I hope you give me that,\" he said. \"Can a guy have that? Does it always have to be what's next, what's the future?\"\n\nThe head coach was also asked about overcoming all the off-the-field issues that surrounded the team. Despite two suspensions, Harbaugh still claims his innocence.\n\n\"The off-the-field issues, we're innocent and we stood strong and tall because we knew we were innocent, and I'd like to point that out,\" Harbaugh said. \"And these guys are innocent. And overcome that, it wasn't that hard because we knew we were innocent.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nA battered and bruised Michael Penix Jr. spoke postgame following Washington’s loss to Michigan in the College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\n\"I had ups and downs, but I’m thankful for it all. To meet Coach (Kalen) DeBoer at Indiana and for him to lead me here. To be playing in the biggest game in college football. We didn’t come out how I wanted it to but each and every player knows that they gave it their all. It wasn’t enough today,\" Penix said. \"Blessed to be here. Blessed to be on this team and these guys will be my brothers forever.\"\n\nThe Heisman Trophy runner-up and senior QB will be on his way to the NFL following Monday’s defeat. He’s rated as a top-five quarterback prospect on many NFL draft boards. — Tyler Dragon\n\nMichigan's national championship gear is available for purchase at https://shop.collegefootballplayoff.com. A book from the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, chronicles Michigan football's dominant run to its first national championship in 26 years. Order your copy here.\n\nIn addition to commemorative caps and shirts, Michigan players were collecting another keepsake from their College Football Playoff national championship win over Washington.\n\nPostgame video showed Wolverines players heading out of NRG Stadium with what appeared to be personalized locker room folding chairs featuring the College Football Playoff logo.\n\nIf Michigan wins the national title on Monday night, the stage will be set for a seminal moment in college sports.\n\nAll season long, and once again Saturday prior to the College Football Playoff championship game, coach Jim Harbaugh has advocated for players to share in the billions being generated by this sport. To do it with a trophy in his hand, on the night the entire country is paying attention, would be arguably the most significant stance for athletes’ rights ever taken by a prominent coach.\n\n“People come to watch the players,” Harbaugh said Saturday. “They really don't come to watch the coaches. They don't come watch the administrators. They come to watch the players. And in a world where the revenue is ever growing, the student-athletes being able to participate in that ever-growing revenue, who could argue against them?”\n\nEven now, in an era of players being able to profit off name, image and likeness, arguing for schools and the NCAA to share revenue with athletes is a bold step for a college coach. Few have had the foresight, desire or guts to do it.\n\nBut if Harbaugh believes that sincerely and isn’t merely using it as media chum to distract from his multiple imbroglios with NCAA rules, then he needs to do it by staying at Michigan and fighting the fight. It’s easy to talk. It’s a lot easier when you have one foot out the door waiting for an offer from the NFL. Read Dan Wolken’s full piece here.\n\nAtlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host the 2025 national championship game, the first with an expanded 12-team playoff field, and Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium is scheduled to host the 2026 title game.\n\nWill Johnson was named the defensive player of the national championship after Michigan beat Washington. The defensive back nabbed an interception off Michael Penix Jr. on the first play from scrimmage in the second half. The Wolverines picked off the Heisman Trophy finalist twice in the victory. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nJim Harbaugh couldn’t celebrate the national title win without his dad, former coach Jack Harbaugh. As the team was on the podium to claim the championship trophy, Jim Harbaugh had his dad take the mic and do his rally cry. \"Who has it better than us?\" Harbaugh said. \"Nobody!\" he, the crowd and team yelled back. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nRunning back Blake Corum set the tone before kickoff that he was ready to take the reins by showing up in a cowboy-inspired outfit. The senior was named the offensive player of the national championship after finishing with 21 carries for 134 yards and two touchdowns. Corum missed the end of last season with a knee injury and was named a 2023 Comeback Player of the Year. \"This is everything I imagined,\" Corum said on the stage after beating the Washington Huskies for the title. \"… We said we had unfinished business, so I’ll leave you all with this: The business is finished!\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWashington was given a second chance to attempt a fourth-and-13 after a chaotic play that landed incomplete and featured two offsetting penalties. Instead of converting, Michael Penix Jr. threw an interception to Michigan's Mike Sainristil, who ran it back 81 yards to the Washington 8-yard-line. Michigan handed the ball to Blake Corum, who pounded for 7 yards and then a 1-yard score to essentially finish off the Huskies. The Wolverines are up 34-13 with 3:37 on the clock. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nThe Wolverines have scored their first touchdown since the first quarter. It only took Michigan five plays to go 71 yards for the score. Michigan’s touchdown drive was highlighted by a 41-yard catch and run by tight end Colston Loveland that put the team on Washington’s 30-yard line. A few plays later, running back Blake Corum broke a tackle and scampered for a 12-yard rushing touchdown to give the Wolverines a 27-13 lead with 7:09 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nMichigan has dominated Washington on the ground. The Wolverines have produced 296 rushing yards on 33 carries. Corum has a game-high 125 rushing yards. — Tyler Dragon\n\nMichael Penix Jr. seemed to have redemption for overthrowing Rome Odunze in the first half when he connected with the star receiver for a 32-yard play in the fourth quarter. But the play was called back when offensive lineman Roger Rosengarten was penalized for holding. Facing second-and-20, the quarterback threw two short passes, but couldn’t move the chains and Washington punted the ball away. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nIt’ll be a one-score game heading into the final quarter of the national championship game, with Michigan leading 20-13 with 15 minutes left to go. Both sides added a field goal in the third quarter, but it wasn’t a mostly dominant effort defensively on both sides. After both teams combined for 450 yards in the first half, both sides only got 130 yards in the third quarter.\n\nWashington will begin the fourth quarter with the ball, getting another chance to cut the deficit or tie the game. The Huskies have only headed into the fourth quarter losing once this season, when they completed a comeback to beat Arizona State in October. Michigan continues to do most of its damage rushing the ball with 273 of its 360 yards coming on the ground. Both Donovan Edwards (104 yards) and Blake Corum (103 yards) have eclipsed the century mark on the ground. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nBoth teams' defenses are stepping, forcing the offenses to get off the field quickly in the middle of the third quarter. After Washington added a field goal, Michigan went three-and-out and punted the ball back to the Huskies. They couldn’t do much either, picking up one first down before punting it to Michigan. The Wolverines get the ball at their own 7-yard line with just over five minutes left in the third quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nIt’s an ACC crew officiating the national championship game, headed by Marcus Woods. Here is the full crew:\n\nReferee: Marcus Woods\n\nUmpire: Danny Worrell\n\nHead linesman: Troy Gray\n\nLine judge: Deon Lawrence\n\nField judge: Wayne Rundell\n\nSide judge: Michael McCarthy\n\nBack judge: Michael Griffith\n\nCenter judge: Larry Saunders\n\nAlternate: Michael Roche\n\nReplay official: Mark McAnaney\n\nCommunicator: Jeff Roberson\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nIt’s back to a one-score game in Houston after Grady Gross drilled a 45-yard field goal for Washington to make it a 20-13 Michigan lead. Michael Penix Jr. was able to get back on the field after he appeared to be injured on the previous offensive drive. Two passes were able to get the Huskies to midfield and they were aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty by Makari Paige to get into Michigan territory. The Huskies were unable to pick up another first down and opted to kick a field goal. Gross is now 2-for-2 on field goals on the night. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan had to settle for a field goal after forcing a turnover. The Wolverines took possession at Washington’s 32-yard line, but a couple penalties cost them a golden opportunity to go up by two touchdowns. Michigan had to settle for a 38-yard field goal by kicker James Turner to push their advantage to 20-10 with 11:55 left in the third quarter. Turner has made both his field goal attempts in the game. — Tyler Dragon\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines do not have a mascot. Nissan’s Heisman House commercial starring former Michigan star cornerback/wide receiver and Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson makes fun of the fact that the college football powerhouse does not, in fact, have a real life wolverine with them on game days. In fact, the Wolverine State barely has any of the fluffy, and not so friendly, animals at all. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWashington had a chance to tie the game out of halftime, but its momentum was taken out with Michigan’s Will Johnson picking off Michael Penix Jr. On the second play out of halftime, Penix looked to get the ball to Tybo Rogers, but the ball came out awkwardly, and Johnson was able to tip it and catch it before he hit the ground. Not only was it an interception, but Penix appeared to be injured after one of his offensive lineman stepped on his ankle. He was getting looked at on the sideline as the Michigan offense got on the field. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe College Football Playoff will expand to 12 teams during the 2024 season. Under the 12-team system, the field will be composed of the six conference champions ranked highest by the selection committee and the six highest-ranked non-conference champions. The 12-team format will allow access for at least one team from the Group of Five.\n\nAccording to the playoff, the first round of the 2024 bracket will occur during the week ending Dec. 21, at \"either the home field of the higher-seeded team or at another site designated by the higher-seeded institution.\" These games would pit seeds No. 12 and No. 5, No. 11 and No. 6, No. 10 and No. 7, and No. 9 and No. 8.\n\nThe top four highest-rated conference champions would have an open date and not play until the quarterfinals. For 2024 and 2025, the four quarterfinal and two semifinal games will be played at rotating bowl sites. In 2024, the quarterfinals will be the Fiesta, Peach, Rose and Sugar bowls, with the semifinals at the Cotton Bowl and Orange Bowl. In 2025, the Cotton, Orange, Rose and Sugar will host the quarterfinals and the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl will host the semifinals. The national championship games will be held on Jan. 20, 2025, in Atlanta, and Jan. 19, 2026, in Miami. — Paul Myerberg\n\nWashington receiver Rome Odunze pronounces his name “ROAM oh-DUNE-zay.” — Ryan Ford, Detroit Free Press\n\nIt was a first quarter dominated by Michigan, but Washington is still alive after getting a touchdown right before halftime to make it a one-score game.\n\nAfter Michigan jumped out to a 14-3 lead, the Wolverines were stopped in the red zone in the opening minutes of the second quarter and opted to take the three points. Washington’s offense still struggled to move the ball, including a missed wide-open catch on a fourth down, but the defense prevented Michigan from adding more points.\n\nWashington finally put together its best drive of the night in the final minutes, capping it with Michael Penix Jr. finding Jalen McMillan on fourth-and-goal for its first touchdown of the game.\n\nMichigan had 229 yards in the first quarter, but only picked up 61 yards after that. The Wolverines are still outgaining the Huskies 290-161, with 209 of those yards coming on the ground.\n\nLeading the way for Michigan is Donovan Edwards, who scored two touchdowns on his first two carries, finishing the first half with 93 yards on three carries. Blake Corum has also helped with 84 yards on eight carries.\n\nIt had been a mostly difficult first half for the Heisman Trophy runner-up, but Penix is 13 for 21 with 128 yards and a scoring toss.\n\nWashington has trailed at halftime twice this season – against Arizona State and Utah, but those were eventual wins. The Huskies will get a chance to tie the game to open the third quarter, something head coach Kalen DeBoer likes.\n\n\"We get the ball to start the third quarter. Great spot,\" he told ESPN before heading into the locker room. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington QB Michael Penix is 13-of-21 passing for 128 yards and one touchdown pass after one half of action.\n\nMichigan might end up regretting going for it on fourth down.\n\nAfter Michigan turned it over on downs, Washington marched down the field on a 11-play, 61-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Washington’s touchdown, ironically, came on fourth down.\n\nWashington needed four plays inside the 10-yard line to reach paydirt. The Huskies scored on fourth down when Michael Penix passed to running back Jalen McMillan for a 3-yard touchdown. Washington’s TD cut its deficit to 17-10 with under a minute remaining in the first half.\n\nPenix completed four passes during Washington’s touchdown drive. The Heisman Trophy runner-up has 128 passing yards and one touchdown in the first half.\n\nWashington gets the football to begin the third quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nIt’s typically not a good idea to bother the head coach in the national championship game.\n\nUnless you are the older brother.\n\nJohn Harbaugh snuck up on Jim Harbaugh on the sidelines to greet him, as the Ravens head coach was able to make it to Houston to see his brother coach in his first national championship game. The two embraced before the elder Harbaugh brother let his younger sibling get back to coaching. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThere will be a halftime show for the College Football Playoff national championship.\n\nUnlike other major sporting events such as the Super Bowl or NBA All-Star game, this halftime show will not feature a chart-topping artist. Instead, the Michigan Marching Band and the University of Washington Husky Marching Band will entertain fans at Houston's NRG Stadium while their football teams debrief in the locker room.\n\nFans at home can watch the halftime show on the ESPN app via the All-22 view. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nThe Washington defense is hanging on, preventing Michigan from converting a fourth-down play to give its offense great field position.\n\nMichigan got into Huskies territory and faced a fourth-and-3 at the Washington 38-yard line. Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh initially sent his punting unit out, but took a timeout to send the offense back out instead.\n\nQuarterback J.J. McCarthy looked to Roman Wilson to pick up the first down, but Edefuan Ulofoshio played great coverage and broke up the pass to give Washington the ball back. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nFBS stands for Football Bowl Subdivision, which is the highest level of college football in the country. Previously called Division I-A, FBS includes 10 conferences and 133 programs.\n\nMichigan got its best field position of the day, but couldn’t capitalize on the Washington turnover-on-downs.\n\nThe Wolverines started at their own 47-yard line but couldn’t gain a yard on the drive. Blake Corum was stuffed on the opening play and J.J. McCarthy couldn’t connect with Colston Loveland or Cornelius Johnson on the following plays, a big stop for a Huskies defense that was gashed in the opening quarter.\n\nThe ensuing punt went into the end zone, so Washington will start at the 20-yard line in an attempt to cut the deficit. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nKalen DeBoer’s first big decision backfired.\n\nDeBoer and Washington elected to go for it on fourth-and-7 from Michigan’s 47-yard line. Michael Penix took the snap in shotgun formation and fired the football over the head of a wide open Rome Odunze.\n\nMichigan took over possession of the football at their own 47-yard line as a result.\n\nWashington did convert two first downs during the drive, but two penalties hurt the team. — Tyler Dragon\n\nThe Michigan offense is rolling, but a defensive stop from Washington kept the Wolverines out of the end zone.\n\nBlake Corum got the drive started with a 59-yard run on the opening play of the drive, but the Washington defense held its ground for the first time of the game, preventing the Wolverines from picking up another first down.\n\nKicker James Turner came in for a 31-yard field goal, and snuck it in through the upright to make it a 17-3 game. This is now the largest deficit Washington has faced this season, and it’ll need to match history to win this game. The largest deficit to be overcome in a CFP national championship is 14 points, done by Clemson in 2017. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe cheapest ticket listed on TicketIQ on Thursday afternoon was about $1,200 while the most expensive was listed at more than $21,000, a seat near the 50-yard line. As of Monday afternoon, the cheapest ticket listed by TicketIQ was more than $3,000 and the most expensive was more than $67,000.\n\nIt’s been all Michigan in the first quarter of the national championship game.\n\nThe Wolverines lead 14-3 and are threatening another score after the first 15 minutes of the game in which Michigan displayed its power over Washington.\n\nMichigan had two touchdown runs from Donovan Edwards on its first two drives, while Washington had a field goal on its first and punted on its second.\n\nThe running game has done a majority of the damage for the Wolverines, picking up 174 rushing yards in the opening frame. In total, Michigan has 229 yards while Washington has 74.\n\nOn the final play of the first quarter, Michigan’s Blake Corum broke free for a 59-yard run to set his team up at the Washington 20-yard line at the start of the second quarter. It was one of several big plays from Michigan, as they picked up four plays of at least 30 yards in the first quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Huskies failed to answer Michigan’s second touchdown.\n\nMichael Penix and Washington went three-and-out in their second series and were forced to punt the football back to Michigan down 14-3 late in the first quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nTwo touches, two touchdowns.\n\nDonovan Edwards is turning into a Michigan legend, as the running back had another big run for his second touchdown of the first quarter.\n\nThe junior running back found an open hole on the fourth play of Michigan’s drive and outran the Washington defenders to give the Wolverines a 14-3 lead with two minutes left in the first quarter. The quick four play, 88-yard drive was aided when J.J. McCarthy showcased his arm by finding Roman Wilson on a 37-yard pass on the second play.\n\nEdwards already has 87 yards and two touchdowns on his two carries. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington’s 14-play opening drive stalled in the red zone.\n\nOn third-and-goal, Michal Penix’s pass to Rome Odunze sailed over the wide receiver’s head. The Huskies had to settle for a short 25-yard field goal by kicker Grady Gross that snuck between the uprights.\n\nThe Huskies trail 7-3 with under four minutes remaining in the first quarter.\n\nWashington faced some early adversity during their first possession. Starting running back Dillon Johnson reaggravated his foot injury during the series but he was able to check back into the game. — Tyler Dragon\n\nLeading up to the national championship game, all eyes were on whether Washington running back Dillon Johnson would be able to play, and if how healthy he is.\n\nBut one play in and Johnson is already in pain.\n\nOn the first offensive play for the Huskies, Johnson took the handoff for six yards when a Michigan defender fell on his left foot as he got tackled. Johnson gingerly walked to the sideline, pointing at his left ankle. He went into the injury tent looking to be in discomfort.\n\nBut the junior running back would return eight plays later, and even was the lead blocker on the play after his return. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJim Harbaugh brought back helmet stickers when he arrived at Michigan in 2015 and awards them for various achievements, on-field and off-field. For the 2023 season, Harbaugh introduced a new sticker, according to Michigan Live, this one bearing the acronym EUTM. It stands for “enthusiasm unknown to mankind,” Michigan Live reported.\n\nIt was previously announced that Grammy-award winner Fantasia Barrino will perform the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to kickoff of the College Football Playoff national championship.\n\nFantasia burst onto the scene as the third winner of the famed reality TV show \"American Idol.\" She won at just 19 years old, beating out several other soon-to-be stars including Jennifer Hudson.\n\nMost recently, Fantasia was nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her role as Celie Johnson in The Color Purple.\n\nFantasia had previously worked on Broadway as the lead in the The Color Purple between April 10, 2007 and January 6, 2008. — Jon Hoefling\n\nMichigan's backup running back is junior Donovan Edwards.\n\nEdwards has only rushed for more than 50 yards in one game this year (52 against Penn State), and has accumulated 393 yards and three touchdowns on the ground, while catching 30 passes for 249 yards in the passing game.\n\nMichigan has made it a habit of being physically dominating this season, and it displayed the power on the opening drive with a touchdown.\n\nThe Wolverines had no issues getting into Washington territory, but took a sack on a first down play that sent them back to the 41-yard line. On the very next play, Donovan Edwards bounced off Washington defenders and found an open lane to his left, breaking free for a 41-yard touchdown run to get the scoring started.\n\nIt was an eight play, 84-yard drive that saw Michigan pick up 66 of those yards on the ground. Now Michael Penix Jr. and company will get their chance to respond.\n\nIt was Edwards' first touchdown since the Nov. 11 matchup against Penn State. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nYes. It's been nearly 25 years since Michigan last claimed a national championship, last winning one in 1997. Michigan also won most of its national championship before the poll era, which began in 1936. Here’s everything you could want to know about Michigan’s championship history. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Huskies have two (1960 and 1991), but it kind of depends who you ask. In 1960, after beating Minnesota 17-7 in the Rose Bowl and finishing with a record of 10-1, Washington was named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation. When the Helms Foundation eventually dissolved in 1969, much of its archives went to the Amateur Athletic Union. Want to know something even weirder about the 1960 national championship? The Huskies didn’t claim it until 2007 — and that’s when they had a trophy made for it. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nBehind legendary coach Don James, and following Washington's 34-14 thumping of Michigan in the 1991 Rose Bowl, the coaches poll (at the time administered jointly by USA TODAY and CNN) named the Huskies national champs. The Associated Press poll, on the other hand, selected the Miami Hurricanes as the No. 1 team, with the Huskies coming in at No. 2. Miami had also finished 12-0 that season, ending with a 22-0 win over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. Because of this, Miami also claims the 1991 national championship. Some consider the 1991 Washington team one of the best college football squads of all time. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since Michigan last claimed a national championship, last winning one in 1997. Michigan also won most of its national championship before the poll era, which began in 1936. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington called tails and won the toss. The Huskies deferred.\n\nThe Huskies' captains were Michael Penix Jr., Rome Udunze, Edefuan Ulofoshio, with former standout defensive end Steve Emtman as a special captain. Emtman played at Washington from 1988-91 and was drafted No. 1 in the 1992 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nMichigan's captains were Zak Zinter, Blake Corum, Kris Jenkins, Trevor Keegan and Mike Sainristil. Zinter suffered a season-ending injury during the Wolverines' win against Ohio State.\n\nWhat time is kickoff for the national championship game tonight?\n\nKickoff is 7:30 p.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024.\n\nHow to watch Michigan vs. Washington?\n\nYou can watch or stream on ESPN.

With the Huskies, he’s racked up 1,162 yards and 16 touchdown on 222 carries. Over his three seasons with the Bulldogs, he played in 35 games and recorded 1,198 yards and 11 touchdowns on 229 carries.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 213-pound quarterback was 342-of-576 passing (59.4%) for 4,197 yards, 29 touchdowns with 32 picks in four years at Indiana. He has more than doubled that production in two seasons with Washington, where he’s completed 66% of his passes (698-of-1,058) for 9,289 yards, 66 TDs and 17 picks. In 2023 alone, Penix was 336-of-504 for 4,648 yards, 35 touchdowns and nine interceptions.

He is the 14th live mascot for Washington and resides in Sammamish, Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan doesn’t have a live mascot, as it might be tough to have an actual wolverine on the sidelines. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWashington went 11-2 last season, its only two losses coming on the road against Pac-12 foes, UCLA and Arizona State.\n\nThe Huskies won their bowl game, the Alamo Bowl, which, ironically came against Texas, which Washington beat in this year's CFP semifinal.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, the Wolverines have titles in: 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1918, 1923, 1933, 1948, 1997. Michigan says it also has won titles in 1932 and 1947. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHere are all the receivers on Washington's roster: Rome Odunze, Ja’Lynn Polk, Jalen McMillan, Giles Jackson, Rashid Williams, Germie Bernard, Denzel Boston, Taeshaun Lyons, Camden Sirmon, Luke Luchini, Jake Parnagian, Mason Wheeler, Owen Coutts, Jackson Girouard, Keith Reynolds. Read Paul Myerberg on how the Huskies' offense matches up against Michigan.\n\nWashington running back Dillon Johnson is expected to play tonight against Michigan, the team has said. Johnson went down in the College Football Playoff semifinal against Texas, nagging lower leg injuries leading him to being carted off the field. ESPN's Molly McGrath reported Monday afternoon that Johnson is dealing with right foot and left knee injuries.\n\n\"This is just something he's been working through for a couple months now and just played through it,\" Washington head coach Kalen DeBoer said last Wednesday. \"There's nothing as far as above and beyond what's happened in the past. Just kind of throughout the game, he'd reaggravate it and shake it off and go back out there and play.\"\n\nJohnson was seen on the sideline before the game playing catch with quarterback transfer Will Rogers.\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas, including Blake Corum’s outfit.\n\nThe Michigan running back arrived at NRG Stadium sporting a classic Texas look, wearing a big black cowboy hat, white shirt, jeans and a massive belt buckle. As if the belt buckle wasn’t enough, Corum is also iced-up with a custom “BC2” chain on his neck.\n\nWolverines are actually extremely rare in the state of Michigan. When a female wolverine was spotted in Michigan's Thumb-region (Huron County) in 2004, it was the first confirmed appearance in the state in more than 200 years.\n\nThe wolverine reportedly died sometime in late 2009 or early 2010. It was stuffed and has been on display at the Saginaw Bay Visitor Center in the Bay City State Recreation Area.\n\nIt will be a contrast in colors for the national championship game with both teams going for all-color looks in Houston.\n\nAs the home team, Michigan will wear its \"big game blue\" uniforms – traditional blue and maize helmet with blue jersey and pants. The Wolverines have worn the uniform combination three times this season, all wins against Bowling Green, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nWashington will go for an all-white uniform set, with white jersey and pants combining with the classic gold helmets. The combination has been worn twice in wins at Michigan State and at Oregon State. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWeather won't be a factor at NRG Stadium on Monday, but it could still have an effect on the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\nHouston is part of a swath of Texas and Louisiana that is under a tornado watch until 10 p.m. ET as parts of the Gulf of Mexico are hit by extreme weather. As a result, Houston's Office of Emergency Management has advised fans to get to the stadium and indoors early so as to avoid the worst of the inclement weather.\n\nBeyond the ongoing tornado watch, high winds are also expected to be a more pressing issue.\n\nNRG Stadium is an indoor stadium and neither the Houston OEM nor National Weather Service has given no indication of an imminent postponement. Things could change if weather poses a threat to fan safety. — Kevin Skiver, USA TODAY Network\n\nRose Bowl: Michigan 27, Alabama 20 (OT). Here are all the highlights from the thrilling overtime matchup.\n\nSugar Bowl: Washington 37, Texas 31. Here are all the top plays and best moments from the Huskies’ win.\n\nThe 6-foot Michigan senior has 735 yards and 12 touchdowns on 45 catches this season. For his career, Wilson has played in 45 games and caught 104 passes for 1,653 yards and 20 TDs. Read Tony Garcia’s feature on Wilson and other seniors for the Detroit Free Press here.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 202-pound quarterback has played in 39 games in three seasons for Michigan, completing 472 of 695 passes (.680) for 6,086 yards, 49 touchdowns and 11 picks. He’s also rushed for 601 yards and 10 TDs on 157 carries. In 2023 alone, McCarthy went 230-of-314 passing for 2,851 yards (203.6 yards per game), 22 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also rushed for 171 yards and three scores on 60 carries. Read Dan Wolken on why Jim Harbaugh calling J.J. McCarthy the greatest Michigan QB isn't nuts.\n\nThe 5-foot-8, 213-pound senior running back has rushed for 3,603 rushing yards and 56 touchdowns in his four-year career at Michigan. In 2023 alone, he carried the ball 237 times for 1,111 yards (4.69 yards per carry, 79.36 yards per game) and 25 touchdowns.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 215-pound Washington senior has caught 209 passes for 3,185 yards and 24 touchdowns in four seasons with the Huskies. In 2023 alone, he recorded 87 catches for 1,553 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter the win over Alabama in the Rose Bowl, a reporter asked Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh the big question: “There's a lot of interest in your future; I wonder if you can tell me what the chances are that the championship game might be your last one at Michigan?” Harbaugh danced away from it: “My future consists of a happy flight back to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Can't wait.\"\n\nSo, while Harbaugh isn’t talking, there is plenty of noise about his return to the NFL. So, the drum beat is there; and if this is Harbaugh’s last game, what will his legacy be at Michigan? Harbaugh has not just brought Michigan back. He has elevated the Wolverines to a new level. The Wolverines are 39-3 in the last three years. This team will finish in the top three for the third year in a row — the greatest stretch in school history. — Jeff Seidel, Detroit Free Press\n\nJim Harbaugh's total pay for the 2023 season is $8,254,600. He has a maximum bonus amount of $3.275 million. His total earnings since going to Michigan in 2015 are $66,456,280, according to USA TODAY Sports’ database of college football coaching salaries.\n\nOne season-ending injury is disappointing; two is heartbreaking. Incredibly, Michael Penix Jr. had to overcome four in as many years with the Indiana Hoosiers, the final two coming just as his college career seemed to be taking flight. Penix tore his ACL three games into his true freshman season in 2018, with the injury coming as he was splitting time with starter Peyton Ramsey in a close loss to Penn State. He injured his non-throwing shoulder nine games into the 2019 season, with Indiana sitting at 7-2, matching the Hoosiers' highest win total since 2007.\n\nHe put himself on the map during the COVID-19 season, tossing 14 touchdowns through five games before suffering another ACL tear in a win against Maryland. And he suffered another shoulder injury five games into the 2021 season, which saw Penix and Indiana struggle through a winless finish in Big Ten play.\n\n\"Yeah, man, those times were tough, but it just showed that I can get through anything. I can persevere and push through any hardship that comes my way,\" said Penix. \"But I'm just super blessed to be in this position now. I wouldn't change anything I've been through for anything. I feel like it's shaped me into the player and the person that I am today.\" Read Paul Myerberg's full feature on Penix here.\n\nIf Michigan wins its first outright national title since Harry Truman was president, it will be a massive perception-changer in the Midwest. But what does any of that really mean when college football is no longer a sport where regionality matters? What's the fun of comparing one conference to another when we now know the real argument is about which one makes the most money from its television contracts?\n\nSure, they’ll continue to keep score, but the most important game — the SEC vs. Big Ten — is going to continue until they finish consuming whatever parts they want from the rest of college sports. A few years ago, fans from both leagues could get into any SEC-Big Ten matchup because it was a clash of styles and ideologies. Now it’s a fight for TV windows and the scraps of other leagues that might collapse in the near future (looking at you, ACC). That’s not nearly as charming.\n\nBut on Monday, before college football goes completely corporate, we’re going to get a national champion that truly represents a conference and a region of the country. Sadly, it's the last time that will mean anything. Read Dan Wolken’s full column here.\n\nMichigan head coach Jim Harbaugh has reportedly had a contract extension in front of him that will make him one of the highest-paid figures in the sport. There have also been reports lately that he isn’t on board with all of the provisions in the deal, including one that would prevent him from engaging with NFL teams for at least the next year. There are also, perhaps, some contentious issues surrounding Michigan’s ability to get out of the contract if there are more significant NCAA violations found. — Dan Wolken\n\nJim Harbaugh started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Western Kentucky in 1994 under his father. He was still playing in the NFL at the time, but held both jobs through the 2001 season. He then made the leap to full-time coaching in 2002, becoming the quarterbacks coach with the Oakland Raiders, a role he held for two seasons, which included a Super Bowl victory. He headed to Southern California to become the head coach of the University of San Diego, where he spent three seasons (2004-06), before helming Stanford (2007-10) and the San Francisco 49ers (2011-14). He has been at Michigan since 2015. Read Dan Wolken's column on what Harbaugh brings to college football.\n\nThe biggest factor in deciding the national championship may come down to this: Which team can dictate the flow of action on offense? Michigan will be hard to beat if running the ball effectively on first down and putting together the sort of sustained drives that would wear down the Huskies' defense. If able to get up and down the field by sharing the wealth among three of four receivers, Washington could give Michigan nightmarish flashbacks to the humbling loss to the Horned Frogs.\n\n\"Yeah, I think the aggressiveness is just who we are,\" Washington coach Kalen DeBoer said.\n\nDon't look for either team to shrink from the challenge. If ever in doubt in the first place, Michigan's physical and mental toughness has been solidified by the overtime win against the Crimson Tide. Washington's fortitude has been on display all throughout a season defined by narrow, single-possession wins. Which team blinks? Read Paul Myerberg’s full preview here.\n\nIt's since leaving Indiana for Washington that quarterback Michael Penix Jr. has entered a new stratosphere, etching his place among the most successful quarterbacks of the decade with two seasons that stack up against the best in Pac-12 history.\n\n“He's different,\" said Washington running back Dillon Johnson.\n\nHe's \"the reason we're in the spot that we're in,\" said offensive lineman Julius Buelow.\n\n“He's that guy,\" wide receiver Rome Odunze said.\n\nPenix is special: In his production, in his unorthodox throwing motion, in his place in this record-setting offense and most of all in the way he's overcome injury, the Huskies' senior quarterback has built a name for himself that will outlast Monday night, when Washington meets Michigan in the College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\n\"He's got the 'it' factor,\" Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"He's just got it.” Read Paul Myerberg’s full feature here.\n\nWashington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is a case study in perseverance after suffering season-ending injuries in each of his four years at Indiana. He's remained healthy since joining the Huskies in 2022 and made a serious run at this year's Heisman Trophy before finishing second to LSU's Jayden Daniels. Injury concerns could lead Penix to drop a bit come April's NFL draft, but he shouldn't fall far. — Paul Myerberg\n\nYes, Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is left-handed. Read Paul Myerberg's full feature on Penix here.\n\nMichigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy might be a first-round pick this spring but would be in contention to be the first quarterback off the board if he delays that draft decision another year, so the true junior will have a difficult decision to make after the national championship. He's agile, careful with the football and perhaps a little constrained by the Wolverines' offensive scheme, so McCarthy's best ball could ahead of him. — Paul Myerberg\n\nJ.J. McCarthy turns 21 on Jan. 20, 2024. Read Paul Myerberg on the greatest Michigan QBs ever and if McCarthy tops the list.\n\nThe Wolverines haven't faced a quarterback anywhere close to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr. The closest analog might be Maryland's Taulia Tagovailoa, who threw for 247 yards and completed 67.7% of his attempts on Nov. 18 but was undone by two interceptions in Michigan's 31-24 win. Penix is in a different class. On the biggest stage of his career, he showed why he might be the best quarterback in college football − and why Washington is poised to ride his arm to a national title. \"Man, the job's not finished,\" Penix said. \"I feel like it's definitely going to take more. I'm going to push myself to get this team more next week. And, man, we're just super excited for the opportunity for sure.\" Read Paul Myerberg's full story here.\n\nA good bit of faith is required in this projection — J.J. McCarthy going 13th to the Oakland Raiders. The Michigan quarterbak is hardly a finished product as a potential early first-round prospect – and he hasn't even declared his intentions for next year yet. But his athleticism and arm strength will position him to be selected far earlier than some might expect based off his production. After the failed Jimmy Garoppolo move, it's time for the Raiders to make a substantial investment in a young quarterback to develop for the long term. — Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, in his latest NFL mock draft\n\nThe Wolverines and Huskies have played 13 times since 1953. Michigan holds the edge, 8-5.\n\nKalen DeBoer is in his second season with Washington and earned $4.2 million in 2023 with a max bonus of $1.25 million, according to USA TODAY Sports’ database of college football coaching salaries. In 2022, he earned $3,100,008 with a max bonus of $1.175 million.\n\nThe Huskies and Wolverines last played in on Sept. 11, 2021. Michigan won, 31-10."
