It reads as follows:\n\n\"In the grove of Erastina, is the Wild West encampment, adjoining the exhibition grounds. It is not unlike a military camp, with its headquarters under canvas, and its grouped tepees savagely ornamented with scalps and feathers. The picturesque Indian children playing under the trees, the uncouth, extemporized comfort and the prevailing air of organization give it a novel interest. There are no restrictions upon visitors, who are allowed to enter the tents, chuck the Indian babies under the chin, watch the squaws at work, and interview the patriarchial chief who sits grim and stoical on his blanket. Of the exhibition on the grounds (and the proprietors will not allow you to call it a performance), especially at night when lit by the electric lights, the wild beauty of it is an entirely new element in our arena sports. When I saw it there were, by gate record, 12,000 people on the stands, which you will understand is the population of a goodly town. A stentorian voice in front of the grand stand makes the announcements, and as he does so, the bands make their entry from the extreme end of the grounds, dashing up to the stand, a third of a mile, at a whirlwind pace. As an exhibition of equestrianism nothing in the world can equal this. Pawnees, Sioux, Cut Off Band, Ogalallas, cowboys, make this dash in groups, successively, and pull up in a growing array before the stand 200 strong. Such daredevil riding was never seen among Cossacks, Tartars, Arabs. All the picturesque horsemanship of the famous Bedouins sinks to child's play before these reckless mamelukes of the plains. When the American cowboys sweep like a tornado up the track, forty or fifty strong, every man swinging his hat and every pony at its utmost speed, a roar of wonder and delight breaks from the thousands and the men reach the grand stand in a cloud, welcomed by a thunderburst. Col. Cody, the far-famed Buffalo Bill, comes last. I don't know that anybody every described Buffalo Bill on a horse. I am inclined to think nobody can. Ainsworth's description of Dick Turpin's ride stood for many years as the finest thing of its kind, and then young Winthrop in his clever story of 'John Brent' excelled it in his ride to the Suggernell Springs. Either one of these men, given a month and a safe publisher, might have wrought Buffalo Bill upon paper. He is the complete restoration of the Centaur. No one that I ever saw so adequately fulfills to the eye all the conditions of picturesque beauty, absolute grace, and perfect identity with his animal. If an artist or a riding master had wanted to mould a living ideal of romantic equestrianship, containing in outline and action the men of Harry of Navarre, the Americanism of Custer, the automatic majesty of the Indian, and the untutored cussedness of the cowboy, he would have measured Buffalo Bill in the saddle. Motion swings into music with him. He is the only man I ever saw who rides as if he couldn't help it and the sculptor and the soldier had jointly come together in his act. It is well worth a visit to Erastina to see that vast parterre of people break into white handkerchiefs like a calm sea suddenly whipped to foam, as this man dashes up to the grand stand. How encumbered, and uncouth and wooden are the best of the red braves beside the martial leadership of this long-limbed pale-face! There they are, drawn up in platoon front. No circus can approximate its actuality. Look down the line. Every man has a record of daring, and there, shaking her long hair, is Georgie Duffie, the Colorado girl. A word of command, the line breaks. Away they go with shouts and yells. In an instant the grounds are covered with the vanishing hoofs. Feathers and war-paint glimmer in the mad swirl and they are gone in the distance. It is impossible to escape the thrill of this intense action. The enthusiasm of the multitude goes with them. All the abeyant savagery in the blood and bones comes to the surface, and men and women shout together. An impression prevailed among some of the spectators that these wild bucking horses are trained after the manner of circus horses. Nothing can be further from the truth, as I had occasion to learn after staying at the camp for two or three days and making their acquaintance. There is one black mare they call Dynamite that is, without exception, the wickedest animal I ever saw. You are to understand that when a man attempts to mount her she jumps into the air, and turning a back somersault, falls upon her back with her heels upward. To escape being crushed to death is to employ the marvelous celerity and dexterity that a cowboy alone exhibits. The other day a cowboy undertook to ride this animal. It was necessary for four men to hold her and she had to be blindfolded before he could get on her, and then, letting out a scream like a woman in pain, she made a headlong dash and plunged with all her force into a fence, turning completely over head first and apparently falling upon the rider. A cry of horror rose from the spectators. But the rest of the exhibition went on. Poor Jim was dragged out, bleeding and maimed, and led away. What was the astonishment of the multitude, when the other refractory animals had had their sport, to see Dynamite again led out and the cowboy, limping and pale, came forward to make another attempt to ride her. 'No, no,' cried the spectators, 'take her away.' But the indomitable cowboy only smiled grimly and gave them to understand that in the cowboys' code a man who failed to ride his animal might as well retire from business. It was do or die. For fifteen minutes the fight went on between man and beast. Animal strength against pluck and intelligence. I never saw a multitude brought to such intense interest. It was the gladiatorial contest revived. The infuriated beast shook off the men who held her like insects. She lept into the air with a scream and fell on her back. She laid down and grovelled. But the cowboy got upon her back by some superhuman skill, and then he was master. As he punished the animal mercilessly and swung his hat triumphantly, the concourse of people stood up and cheered long and loud.\"\n\nThis graphic description of Buffalo Bill and his Wild West exhibition, and other similar accounts given by well-known English actors who had witnessed the performance in America, awakened a deep desire in the minds of the people of London to \"take in\" the entertainment.\n\nThe eminent English actor, Mr. Henry Irving thus spoke to a representative of the Era the leading dramatic organ of London, regarding a Wild West performance he witnessed at Staten Island, predicting that when it should come to London it would take the town by storm.\n\n\"I saw an entertainment in New York the like of which I had never seen before, which impressed me immensely. It is coming to London and will be exhibited somewhere near Earl's Court, on the grounds of the forthcoming Exhibition. It is an entertainment in which the whole of the most interesting episodes of life on the extreme frontier of civilization in America are represented with the most graphic vividness and scrupulosity of detail. You may form some idea of the scale upon which the scene is played when I say that when I saw it the stage extended over five acres. You have real cowboys, with bucking horses, real buffaloes, and great hordes of cows, which are lassoed and stampeded in the most realistic fashion imaginable. Then there are real Indians, who execute attacks upon coaches driven at full speed. No one can exaggerate the extreme excitement and 'go' of the whole performance. However well it may be rehearsed—and the greatest care is taken that it shall go properly—it is impossible to avoid a considerable share of the impromptu and the unforseen. For you may rehearse with buffaloes as much as you like, but no one can say in what way they will stampede when they are suddenly turned loose in the open. No one can say how the ox has to be lassoed, or in what way the guns have to be fired when the border fight comes on. The excitement is immense, and I venture to predict that when it comes to London it will take the town by storm.\"\n\nMr. Irving's prediction was fulfilled to the letter. Buffalo Bill and his Wild West riders were welcomed to London with a more than royal welcome, for royalty itself—the Queen, the Prince of Wales and other royal personages of high rank, as well as vast crowds of the London populace flocked to Earl's Court station to witness the much talked of performance. The public press could not say enough in its favor, all were flatteringly eulogistic. The London Illustrated News devoted to a graphic description of the exhibition a two full page illustration and four columns of descriptive matter. Following is an extract from the latter:\n\n\"This remarkable exhibition, the 'Wild West,' has created a furore in America, and the reason is easy to understand. It is not a circus, nor indeed is it acting at all, in a theatrical sense; but an exact reproduction of daily scenes in frontier life, as experienced and enacted by the very people who now form the Wild West company. It comprises Indian life, cowboy life, Indian fighting, and burning Indian villages, lassoing and breaking in wild horses, shooting, feats of strength, and border athletic games and sports. It could only be possible for such a remarkable undertaking to be carried out by a remarkable man; and the Hon. W. F. Cody, known as 'Buffalo Bill; guide, scout, hunter, trapper, Indian fighter, and legislator, is a remarkable man. He is a perfect horseman, an unerring shot, a man of magnificent presence and physique, ignorant of the meaning of fear or fatigue; his life is a history of hairbreadth escapes, and deeds of daring, generosity and self-sacrifice, which compare very favorably with the chivalric actions of romance, and he has been not unappropriately designated the 'Bayard of the Plains.'\"\n\nBuffalo Bill was personally honored by calls from the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone and other distinguished statesmen of the realm and then commenced a long series of invitations to breakfast, dinners, luncheons, and midnight layouts, garden parties and all the other attentions by which London society delights to honor what it is pleased to call the distinguished foreigner.\n\nA writer in the London Sporting Life, thus concludes a laudatory notice of the Wild West opening performance:\n\n\"The opening of the Wild West Show was one of the most signal successes of recent years. Such a vast concourse of the cream—or it may be as well to say the creme de la creme—of society is seldom seen at any performance. The number of chariots waiting at the gates outnumbered those of Pharaoh, and the phalanx of footmen constituted quite a small army. There is much in the Wild West show to please. There is novelty of incident, wonderful tone, color, dexterous horsemanship, and a breezy independence of manner, which latter quality, by the way, is not entirely confined to the dramatis personœ. It is new, it is brilliant it is startling, it will 'go!'\"\n\nThe concluding performance was thus noticed by the London Times.\n\n\"The Wild West Exhibition, which has attracted all the town to West Brompton for the last few months, was brought yesterday to an appropriate and dignified close. A meeting of representative Englishmen and Americans was held, under the presidency of Lord Lorne, in support of the movement for establishing a Court of Arbitration for the settlement of disputes between this country and the United States. At first sight it might seem to be a far cry from the Wild West to an International Court. Yet the connection is not really very remote. Exhibitions of American products and of a few scenes from the wilder phases of American life certainly tend in some degree at least to bring America nearer to England. They are partly cause and partly effect. They are the effect of increased and increasing intercourse between the two countries, and they tend to promote a still more intimate understanding. The two things, the Exhibition and the Wild West Show, have supplemented each other. Those who went to be amused often stayed to be instructed. It must be acknowledged that the show was the attraction which made the fortune of the Exhibition. Without Colonel Cody, his cowboys, and his Indians, it is conceivable that the Exhibition might have reproduced the Wild West in one feature at any rate—namely, its solitude—with rare fidelity. But the Wild West was irresistible. Colonel Cody, much to the astonishment of some of his more superfine compatriots, suddenly found himself the hero of the London season. Notwithstanding his daily engagements and his punctual fulfillment of them, he found time to go everywhere, to see everything, and to be seen by all the world. All London contributed to his triumph, and now the close of his show is selected as the occasion for promoting a great international movement with Mr. Bright, Lord Granville, Lord Wolseley, and Lord Lorne for its sponsors. Colonel Cody can achieve no greater triumph than this, even if he some day realizes the design attributed to him of running the Wild West Show within the classic precincts of the Colosseum at Rome.\"\n\nFrom all of which it appears that Buffalo Bill and his wonderful Wild West exhibition proved a howling success in the British metropolis.\n\nFrom London the Wild West aggregation of two hundred people, with the numerous horses, buffaloes and wild steers, moved on in triumphal march to Birmingham, and thence to Manchester, where it was attended by people from all parts of England, and Buffalo Bill and his wonderful Wild West riders soon became a familiar theme and marvel throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain.\n\nTo-day, the world over, Buffalo Bill, in the minds of men, women and children, is the typical American pioneer, guide, scout, Indian fighter and plainsman.\n\nIt is but natural, therefore, that the world should be eager to learn all that can be told regarding the career of this remarkable American.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nBOYHOOD DAYS.\n\nWilliam Frederick Cody, more generally known as Honorable W. F. Cody, and famous the world over as \"Buffalo Bill,\" was born in Scott county, Iowa, February 26, 1845.\n\nHis father, Isaac Cody, was a farmer, in a small way, and with his wife Ann Cody, lived in a little log cabin on his farm in the Scott county backwoods, at that time regarded as a part of the Far West wilderness.\n\nMr. Cody did not find farming in Scott county a very profitable business, so, when Billy was about five years old, determined to \"get out of the wilderness,\" and moved with his family to the little village of Le Clair, on the Mississippi river, some fifteen miles north of Davenport.\n\nAt Le Clair Billy was sent to school, but did not attend very regularly, as he found it much pleasanter, without the knowledge or consent of his parents, to go skiff-riding on the father of waters.\n\nBut he did not long have the opportunity to do either, for after residing at Le Clair for only two years, Billy's father again determined to make a move, and packing his family and possessions into a carriage and three \"mover wagons\" he started for the then Territory of Kansas.\n\nAfter a journey of much interest to all, especially to Billy, across the plains of Iowa and over the hills of Missouri, the family arrived in good shape at Weston, a small town on the border line between Missouri and Kansas, where Billy's uncle, Elijah Cody, a well-to-do merchant, resided. Here the family remained, moving upon one of Elijah's farms, while Billy's father crossed the line into Kansas and established a trading post of the Kickapoo Indian Agency at Salt Creek Valley.\n\nWhen Billy was eight years old his father bought him a pony, which at once gave Billy an occupation and a pastime, for he combined business with pleasure, and with the aid of his pony, made himself useful to his father in a number of ways.\n\nThere were many ready and rough riders at Kickapoo then, and Billy soon learned to be a pretty good horseman. But his pony continued to be stubborn and unsubmissive. One day a company of eight men came into the vicinity of Mr. Cody's trading post, driving a herd of several hundred horses which they had taken wild in California and driven across the plains. One of the men watched Billy as he was trying to pet his fractious pony into submissiveness.\n\n\"Here, my lad,\" said the man. \"I can break that pony for you,\" and making a slip noose, he passed it over the pony's nose and springing lightly upon his back, dashed away over the prairie and kept the pony upon a run until he was completely exhausted. Riding up to where Billy and his father stood he sprang to the ground, passed the lariat to Billy, and said:\n\n\"He is all right now. Get on and ride him.\"\n\nWhile Billy went away to care for his pony, his father drew the stranger out into conversation, and found he had been a great wanderer, that he had been in Australia, had served a time as a circus rider, had spent several years in California, hunting and capturing wild horses, and was then on his way to Weston, Missouri, to visit his uncle, Elijah Cody:\n\n\"What is your name?\" asked Mr. Cody in surprise.\n\n\"Horace Billings.\"\n\n\"Then you are my nephew, the son of my sister Sophia. I am Isaac Cody, brother of Elijah Cody!\"\n\nThe discovery was mutually pleasant, and Billy was called up and introduced to his cousin Horace. Henceforward they were fast and inseparable friends, the one being, however, only a lad about nine years old, while the other was a tall, handsome man, measuring in height six feet and two inches.\n\nBillings was an accomplished horseman, and took especial pride and pleasure in teaching the boy the art of horsemanship, together with the use of the lasso.\n\nThe United States had lost about three hundred horses on the Kansas plains by stampede, and a reward of ten dollars a head was offered for their capture and return to Fort Leavenworth. Billings and Billy roamed the plains, chasing these semi-wild horses, and young Cody soon was proficient in the science and art of horsemanship.\n\nIn the meantime the Indian boys who visited his father's trading post, had taught him to use the bow and arrow, and from them he had learned to talk in the Kickapoo language.\n\nIn 1854 the bill known as the \"Enabling Act of Kansas Territory\" passed Congress. Immediately thousands of people poured into Kansas to pre-empt land claims. Among these were hundreds of Missourians who were very loud in their declarations that Kansas should be made a slave state, as was Missouri. Excitement ran high. The question was the one theme of conversation wherever a company of men were assembled. At one of these impromptu gatherings Mr. Cody was called upon for his views. He was quite a politician, and in Iowa was considered a good stump speaker.\n\nHe got upon a box and began to express his views in mild language, but insisting that Kansas ought to be kept \"white,\" and slavery not to be allowed to fill the state with negroes. This ingenious argument in behalf of freedom did not \"take\" very well with his audience, and encouraged by the shouts of disapproval from the crowd, a ruffian jumped upon the box where Mr. Cody stood, and drawing a large bowie knife plunged it into the speaker's breast twice, and would have killed him had not some of the more humane spectators interfered in his behalf.\n\nMr. Cody recovered from his wounds, but was compelled to flee from the country to escape death by hanging at the hands of the pro-slavery border ruffians. He went to Grasshopper Falls, thirty-five miles west of Fort Leavenworth, but was pursued by his enemies even there, and would have been surprised and killed, had not Billy discovered their intentions, and, in a wild ride of many miles, mounted on his pony, most of the time pursued by the would-be lynchers, warned his father in time for him to escape to Lawrence, where he was made a member of the first legislature of Kansas, and assisted in organizing the territory into a State.\n\nWhen Billy was but ten years old, he hired out to Mr. Russell, of Leavenworth, to herd cattle, and received for his services the munificent sum of twenty-five dollars per month, besides his board. At the end of two months he went back home, carrying with him one hundred silver half dollars, his salary as cattle herder. His mother received him joyfully, although he had run away to accept the position, not being able to get his mother's consent. He afterward spent seven years in the service of the same man, in the several capacities of pony express, wagon master, cattle driver, etc.\n\nAbout this time he got into a difficulty with a schoolmate on account of having the same girl for a sweetheart. Billy and his sweetheart would spend the hours of intermission from study at school in building bowers for a mimic home. The other boy took delight in tearing these houses down as fast as Billy could build them. The finale was a school boy fight in which Billy used a dirk, inflicting an ugly but not dangerous wound upon his rival's leg. To avoid the punishment he knew to be in store for him when the teacher discovered his act, he fled, and did not stop until he intercepted a government train of freight wagons which he had noticed creeping slowly along over the prairie. Fortunately he was acquainted with one of the teamsters, and in him found a sympathizing friend, who, when camp was made for the night, mounted a horse and taking Billy up, rode back to Mrs. Cody's and obtained permission of her to take the young fugitive on his trip, to be gone about forty days. She finally agreed to the arrangement. When Billy returned, he found his mother had succeeded in pacifying the father of the boy he had wounded. Even Billy made friends with him, and the friendship yet remains between the two, a lasting monument of the gentle and benign influence of a mother's love and foresight.\n\nIn April, 1857, Billy's father died of kidney disease. Billy then determined to follow the life of a plainsman to obtain means to assist his mother in caring for the family.\n\nThe following month he found employment with Mr. Russell and his partners, and started for Salt Lake City with a herd of cattle for the United States troops sent out to fight the Mormons. It was on this journey that Billy received his initiation as an Indian fighter and killed his first Indian, though at the time but eleven years of age. His own account of the matter, as given in his autobiography, is as follows:\n\n\"Nothing occurred to interrupt our journey until we reached Plum Creek, on the South Platte River, thirty-five miles west of Old Fort Kearney. We had made a morning drive and had camped for dinner. The wagon master and the majority of the men had gone to sleep under the mess wagons. The cattle were being guarded by three men, and the cook was preparing dinner. No one had an idea that the Indians were anywhere near us. The first warning we had was the firing of shots and the whoops and yells from a party of them, who, watching us napping, gave us a most unwelcome surprise. All the men jumped to their feet and seized their guns. They saw in astonishment the cattle running in every direction, they having been stampeded by the Indians, who had killed the three men who were on day herd duty, and the red devils were now charging down on the rest of us.\n\n\"I then thought of mother's fear of my falling into the hands of the Indians, and I had about made up my mind that such was to be my fate; but when I saw how coolly and determinedly the McCarthy brothers were conducting themselves, and giving orders to the little band, I became convinced that we would stand the Indians off, as the saying is. Our men were all well armed with colts revolvers and Mississippi 'yagers,' which last carried a bullet and two buckshots.\n\n\"The McCarthy boys, at the proper moment, gave orders to fire upon the advancing enemy. The volley checked them, although they returned the compliment, and shot one of our party through the leg. Frank McCarthy then sung out, 'Boys, make a break for the slough yonder, and we can then have the bank for a breastwork.'\n\n\"We made a run for the slough, which was only a short distance off, and succeeded in reaching it safely, bringing with us the wounded man. The bank proved to be a very effective breastwork, affording us good protection. We had been there but a short time when Frank McCarthy, seeing that the longer we were coralled the worse it would be for us, said:\n\n\"'Well, boys, we will try to make our way back to Fort Kearney by wading in the river and keeping the bank for a breastwork\n\n\"We all agreed that this was the best plan, and accordingly proceeded down the river several miles in this way, managing to keep the Indians at a safe distance with our guns, until the slough made a junction with the Platte River. From there down we found the river at times quite deep, and in order to carry the wounded man along with us, we constructed a raft of poles for his accommodation, and in this way he was transported.\n\n\"Occasionally the water would be too deep for us to wade, and we were obliged to put our weapons on the raft and swim. The Indians followed us pretty close, and were continually watching for an opportunity to get a good range and give us a raking fire. Covering ourselves by keeping well under the bank, we pushed ahead as rapidly as possible, and made pretty good progress, the night finding us still on our way, and the enemies still on our track.\n\n\"I being the youngest and the smallest of the party, became somewhat tired, and without noticing it, I had fallen behind the others for some little distance. It was about ten o'clock and we were, keeping very quiet and hugging close to the bank, when I happened to look up to the moon-lit sky and saw the plumed head of an Indian peeping over the bank. Instead of hurrying on and alarming the men in a quiet way, I instantly aimed my gun at the head and fired. The report rang out sharp and loud on the night air, and was immediately followed by an Indian whoop, and the next moment about six feet of dead Indian came tumbling into the river. I was not only overcome with astonishment, but was badly scared, as I could hardly realize what I had done. I expected to see the whole force of Indians come down upon us. While I was standing thus bewildered the men who had heard the shot and the war whoop, and had seen the Indian take a tumble, came rushing back.\n\n\"'Who fired that shot?' cried Frank McCarthy.\n\n\"'I did,' replied I rather proudly, as my confidence returned, and I saw the men coming up.\n\n\"'Yes, and little Billy has killed an Indian stone dead,—too dead to skin,\" said one of the men, who had approached nearer than the rest, and had nearly stumbled upon the corpse. From that time on I became a hero and an Indian killer. This was of course the first Indian I had ever shot, and my exploit created quite a sensation.\n\n\"The other Indians upon learning what had happened to their 'advance guard,' set up a terrible howling, and fired several volleys at us, but without doing any injury, as we were well protected by the bank. We resumed our journey down the river and traveled all night. We reached Fort Kearney just after the reveille—bringing the wounded man with [drawing] J. MANZ & CO. Engs us. The commandant at once ordered a company out to endeavor to recapture the cattle from the Indians. The troops followed the trail to the head of Plum Creek and there abandoned it, without having seen a single red skin.\"\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nEXCITING ADVENTURES.\n\nIn the following summer Billy made arrangements to make another trip across the plains, in the capacity of \"extra hand\" to the wagonmaster of a train that was to transport supplies for the army of General Albert Sidney Johnson, that had been sent out to Salt Lake to look after the Mormons.\n\nThe wagonmaster's name was Lew Simpson, and he was one of the most trusty teamsters that ever commanded a bull-train. Simpson had known Billy for quite a while, and he knew that he was certain to obtain the latter's consent to make the trip with him across the plains, though at that time such a journey was exceedingly perilous.\n\nWhen Simpson proposed the matter to Billy, he was wild to go, but his mother interposed an emphatic objection and urged him to abandon so reckless a desire. She reminded him that in addition to the fact that the trip would possibly occupy a year, the journey was one of extreme peril, beset as it was by Mormon assassins and treacherous Indians, and begged him to accept the lesson of his last experience and narrow escape as a providential warning. But to her pleading and remonstrances Billy returned the answer that he had determined to follow the plains as an occupation, and while he appreciated her advice and desired greatly to honor her commands, yet he could not on any account give up his determination to accompany the train.\n\nFinding it was impossible to move Billy from his determined purpose to accompany Simpson at all hazards, Mrs. Cody reluctantly gave her consent, but not until she had called upon Simpson and secured from him the promise that he would take the best of care of her precious boy.\n\nSo Billy, after arranging with his employers that when his pay fell due it should be turned over to his mother, set out with Simpson and his train of ten wagons direct for Salt Lake.\n\nA description of the wagon trains that carried freight from Fort Leavenworth to Salt Lake City, will interest the reader.\n\nThe wagons were huge affairs and strongly built, being capable of carrying something over seven thousand pounds of merchandise. They were provided with a double canvas cover stretched over bows to protect the freight from rain. The wagons were drawn by oxen, several yokes of them being attached to one wagon. Each team had a driver. The train consisted of twenty-five drivers, one wagonmaster who had control of the entire cavalcade, one assistant wagonmaster, one \"extra hand,\" one night herder, one cavallard driver, whose duty it was to drive the loose animals. This company was divided into messes of seven persons each, and each mess did its own cooking. One of the men would cook, another get water, another wood, while another stood guard, and so on, each having a particular duty to perform. The entire company was heavily armed with revolvers and rifles, and always had their weapons handy in case of emergency. The wagonmaster, in the language of the plains, was known as the \"bull-wagon boss,\" the teamsters were known as the \"bull whackers,\" and the whole train as the \"bull outfit.\" The company for which Billy was working had two hundred and fifty \"outfits,\" which consisted of 6,000 wagons, 75,000 oxen, and 8,000 men. Thus it will be seen that the position Billy was called to fill was no mean one, and the wages paid, fifty dollars per month in gold, was a prize to be coveted.\n\nThe trip from the outset was full of interest to Billy. The country through which they passed fairly swarmed with buffaloes, and the train laid over one day for a grand bison hunt. They killed quite a number of buffaloes, captured a number of stray cattle—a portion of a herd that the Indians had stampeded—and enjoyed a day of rare sport.\n\nThe next morning the train resumed its onward journey towards great Salt Lake. The train was strung out to a considerable length along the road which ran near the foot of the sand-hills, two miles from the South Platte River. Then and there it was that Billy first witnessed a buffalo stampede. In his autobiography, Buffalo Bill thus describes the exciting scene: \"Between the road and the river we saw a large herd of buffaloes grazing quietly, they having been down to the stream for a drink. Just at this time we observed a party of returning Californians coming from the west. They, too, noticed the buffalo herd, and in another moment they were dashing down upon them, urging their steeds to the greatest speed. The buffalo herd stampeded at once and broke down the hills; so hotly were they pursued by the hunters that about five hundred of them rushed through our train pell-mell, frightening both men and oxen. Some of the wagons were turned clear round, and many of the terrified oxen attempted to run to the hills, with the heavy wagon attached to them. Others turned around so short that they broke the wagon tongues off. Nearly all the teams got entangled in their gearing, and became wild and unruly, so that the perplexed drivers were unable to manage them\n\n\"The buffaloes, the cattle and the drivers were soon running in every direction, and the excitement upset nearly everybody and everything. Many of the cattle broke their yokes and stampeded. One big buffalo bull became entangled in one of the heavy wagon-chains, and it is a fact that in his desperate efforts to free himself he not only actually snapped the strong chain in two, but broke the ox-yoke to which it was attached, and the last seen of him he was running towards the hills with it hanging from his horns. A dozen other equally remarkable incidents happened during the short time that the frantic buffaloes were playing havoc with our train, and when they got through and left us our outfit was badly crippled and scattered.\"\n\nNothing further of special interest occurred to the train until it arrived within a few miles of Green River in the Rocky Mountains. Here the company was surprised by Joe Smith and a squad of Danites from the Mormons, who were permitted to ride into the camp while at noonday halt, as the wagonmaster and drivers supposed them to be a lot of Californians going East. The trainmen were given one wagon, some provisions, and their arms and six yoke of oxen, and told to put back to Fort Bridger. They could do nothing but obey. They tarried, however, and saw the entire train of twenty-four wagons, and the loads of hard tack, bacon, ammunition and other supplies for Gen. Johnson's army, burned to ashes.\n\nThey finally reached Fort Bridger, but there were gathered three or four hundred men in the employ of the Freight Company, besides the garrison of the United States troops.\n\nWinter now set in, and provisions were scarce. The men were reduced to three quarter rations, and then to one half rations, and finally to one quarter. As a last resort they killed and ate the oxen, which by this time had been reduced to skin and bones, and as these failed to supply the demand, mules were also killed and portioned out to the half-famished men and soldiers. When mules and oxen were gone, the wood for fuel was brought from the mountains by men, twenty or more of whom would drag a wagon loaded with fuel. Spring, though, came at last, and with it a move to Fort Laramie. Here another train was organized to return to Fort Leavenworth. On this trip, Billy, Simpson and his assistant, rode ahead of the train to overtake one that had a day's start. These three were attacked by forty Indians. Simpson immediately dismounted and had the other two do the same. The mules were killed, and behind these the three lay all day and all night, keeping the Indians at bay with their rifles and revolvers as they were armed only with bows and arrows. However, the assistant wagonmaster was severely wounded in the shoulder by an arrow. Next day about l0 o'clock the train arrived, and the Indians suddenly departed, leaving on the field four dead companions.\n\nBilly finally reached home in safety, to the great joy of his mother and sister.\n\nThe next move Billy made, was to join a party of trappers who intended to trap for beaver and otter, and kill wolves for their pelts. This business proved unprofitable, and was abandoned after two months. He then returned home and remained about three months, attending the neighborhood school.\n\nWhen spring came again, he joined a party bound for Pike's Peak, the then newly discovered gold field. Two months of prospecting was all he could stand, and he then concluded he was not cut out for a miner.\n\nThe next business in which he engaged, was pony express rider. This was at that time a new business on the plains. He was obliged to ride forty-five miles in three hours, and change horses three times. He continued in this work two months or more, during which time he never failed to make his trips according to schedule. It was very hard on him, and he gave it up at the urgent solicitation of his mother.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nON A TRAPPING EXPEDITION.\n\nBilly's restless spirit could not be satisfied with the seemingly humdrum life of a farmer, and soon he went on a trapping expedition up the Republican River and its tributaries in company with Dave Harrington. They were very successful, and had many trophies of their skill, when Billy, unfortunately, slipped on the ice while creeping toward a herd of elk around the bend of a sharp bluff, and fell heavily, breaking his leg just above the ankle. This left the two trappers in anything but an enviable situation. Dave played the surgeon and rather skilfully set the broken bone. The prospect was dreary enough. They were one hundred and twenty-five miles from the nearest settlement. Rather than remain in that dreary region through the winter, Billy persuaded Dave to go to the settlement, get an ox-team, return and take him home. This he consented to do, and left on his long tramp, after providing fuel and food to last his friend Bill until he should return. This he expected to do in about twenty days. The house where Bill now lay was a \"dug-out,\" a hole made in the ground, covered with poles, upon which were placed grass, leaves and other similar materials. To be thus situated was bad enough for a well man, and far worse for a boy in Billy's condition. The days dragged slowly by until twelve of them had been passed. One day at this time, Billy was awakened from sleep by some one standing by his bed and touching his arm. He opened his eyes, and saw looking into his face, the hideous outline of a huge Indian warrior, all painted and bedecked for war. Through the door other Indians were crowding, and outside the dug-out, Billy heard the tramping of horses and the voices of those who could not get into the little room. He knew they were on the war-path and would not hesitate to put him to death after subjecting him to such torture as their devilish ingenuity could invent. They were not in a hurry, however, to execute their plans against him, but proceeded to investigate the hut and contents. They very deliberately set about cooking what food they wanted and could find at hand, taking special pains to use all his tea, coffee, and sugar. He watched their movements with intense interest, but could find no way by which he could escape. Finally, an old Indian came in, and Billy was rejoiced to see that he was a chief whom he had met before. The recognition was mutual. The Indian chief,—Rain-in-the-face, could speak a little English, and Billy could speak a little Indian language, and he thus succeeded in securing the old chief's attention and sympathy. He begged that his life might be spared, and food left to keep him from starving. The chief consulted his warriors, and told Billy that they would spare his life, but the provisions were to be used. He then asked them to let him keep his gun and pistol as a means of defense from wild animals. This they would not consent to do, as one of their number had no fire arms, and greatly admired Billy's outfit in that line. They staid all day and all the next night, and left next morning, taking all Billy's cooking utensils, and nearly all his provisions. He was glad, however, to see them leave without taking his life. A heavy snowstorm now set in and completely covered the dug-out. At night, wolves came in immense numbers, howled around the hut, ran over the top of it, scratched for an entrance, and made Billy's blood run cold at the prospect of being eaten alive by half-starved wolves after escaping the scalping knife of the savages.\n\nThe twentieth day came, the day appointed for Harrington's return. Billy counted the hours as they went by, and waited and listened for the welcome voice of his tried and true friend. Night came, but Harrington came not. A whole week passed beyond the appointed time, and Billy was still alone. Finally, on the twenty-ninth day, when hope was about dead, and Billy nearly dead, too, he heard a voice:\n\n\"Hello, Billy!\"\n\n\"All right, Dave!\"\n\n\"Well, old boy, are you alive?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that is about all. I have had a tough siege of it since you went away.\"\n\nThis conversation was carried on while Dave was digging his way through the drifted snow to the door of the hut. He finally pushed the door open, went in, and was immediately clasped in Billy's arms. He would not let him go, but hugged him time and again, meanwhile telling him how he loved him.\n\n\"Well, Billy, my boy,\" said Dave, \"I hardly expected to see you alive, but as I had left you here, I was bound to come through, or die in the attempt.\"\n\nAgain Billy threw his arm around Dave's neck and fell upon his bosom while tears of joy ran down his face.\n\n[drawing]\n\nJ. MANZ & Co Engs\n\nDave then sat down and told Billy what great trials he had encountered in going and coming. How the snow had blocked his way; how the oxen had wandered off, and what a weary time he had hunting them.\n\nThe two fast friends soon packed up what little goods the Indians had left them, and put back in a wagon drawn by the team of oxen, for civilization. They accomplished the return trip, and Billy was once more at his mother's house. Dave Harrington accompanied him. Here Dave died, being tenderly nursed by Billy's mother and sisters, who felt that they could not do enough for one who had done so much for Billy. But his disease was not to be baffled, and after an illness of only a week poor Harrington died of pneumonia.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nRIDING THE PONY EXPRESS.\n\nA short time after the death of his friend Harrington, Billy met his old wagonmaster and friend. Lew Simpson, who was fitting out a train at Atchison and loading it with supplies for the Overland Stage Company.\n\n\"Come along with me, Billy,\" said Simpson. I'll give you a good lay-out. I want you with me.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I would like to go so far west as that again,\" replied Billy; \"but I do want to ride the pony express once more; there is some life in that.\"\n\nSimpson laughed at Billy's hankering for further experience in the pony express business, but told him if that was what he had got his mind set on, he had better come with him to Atchison and see Mr. Russell, who would be pretty certain to give him a situation.\n\nBilly acceded to this proposition, and was given the coveted position by Mr. Russell, on his arrival at Atchison. He was assigned to a route seventy-six miles long, and rode with ease and regularity. One day after making his trip he found the rider who was to continue the route a distance of eight-five miles, was drunk, and unable to go out. Billy immediately mounted a fresh pony, and started on the drunken rider's route. He made the ride on time, having accomplished 322 miles on horseback without an hour's rest. It is the greatest feat in that line on record.\n\nA short time after making this trip, Billy was riding along the same route, when a band of Sioux Indians, armed with pistols, dashed out from behind a sand ravine, and gave Billy one of the closest calls for his scalp he had ever experienced up to that date. But, very fortunately for Billy, and for the pony express company, Billy's horse was a swifter stepper than any of those ridden by the Indians, and Billy soon placed a very safe distance between himself and his pursuers. When he arrived at Sweetwater, the first station on the route of his flight, he found that the Indians had raided the station, killed the stock tender, and driven off all the horses so that he was compelled to continue his journey without a fresh mount. He arrived safely at Ploutz Station, twelve miles further on, having made a twenty-four mile straight run without change of horse.\n\nOne day when Billy was laying off, taking the world easy, and only riding when other riders were disabled, he started out for a bear hunt, all by himself. He rode up into the mountains without discovering any bears, and not wishing to return without any trophy of his skill, he continued to ride until night came on. He now found himself many miles from headquarters, and in a wild and desolate region. He had killed two sage hens, and was about to make a fire to cook one of them for supper, when he heard the neighing of a horse. He sprang to his horse, which stood near by, to prevent him from answering, as is usual for horses to do under such circumstances.\n\nHe was now quite anxious to know whether the owner of the horse was friend or foe. He made a reconnoissance and saw a light shining at a little distance from him. Approaching the light he found it came from a dug-out in the mountain side. He drew near cautiously, and found that persons were conversing in his own language. He was glad to find that the occupants were white men. He rapped on the door, and was immediately answered:\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"A friend, and a white man.\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nHe stepped in and found himself in the midst of as rough a set of men as he had ever met in all his wanderings. One or two of them he recognized as formerly teamsters when he was connected with the freight trains of the plains. He was pleased to see that they did not recognize him. He was thoroughly surprised and frightened by his unexpected surroundings, but did not by appearance or tone of voice betray his emotions. He wanted to get away from them as soon as possible.\n\n\"Where are you going, young man?\" said one of them.\n\n\"I am on a bear hunt.\"\n\n\"Who is with you?\"\n\n\"I am entirely alone.\"\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n\"I left Horseshoe Station this morning.\"\n\n\"How came you here?\"\n\n\"Just as I was going into camp, about one hundred yards down the creek, I heard one of your horses whinny, and then I came to your camp.\"\n\n\"Where is your horse?\"\n\n\"I left him down the creek.\"\n\n\"Well, we will send for him.\"\n\n\"Captain, I will leave my gun here, go down and get my horse, and return and stay all night.\"\n\n\"Jim and I will go with you,\" said one of the men. \"You may leave your gun here. You will not need it.\"\n\n\"All right, lead the way.\"\n\nBilly now knew he was in the hands of a band of horse thieves. He knew that he would never get away from them alive, unless he escaped that hour. He thought fast, and soon had his plan matured. There seemed to be but little choice between being shot to death while fleeing from them, and being shot to death tied to a stake. He preferred the former. They reached the place where the horse was hitched.\n\n\"I will lead the horse,\" said one.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Billy. \"I will carry these two sage hens which I have killed.\"\n\nThe man went ahead, leading the horse. Billy came next, carrying the sage hens. The other man brought up the rear. Every step onward seemed to Billy to be a step toward certain death. He determined to escape or die there. He dropped one of the hens as if by chance, and asked the man behind him to pick it up. He stooped to do so, but as it was dark, he had to search for the hen. Billy pulled his revolver, seized the muzzle, and with the butt dealt the man a heavy blow on the back of his head, felling him to the ground. The man ahead turned to see what was the matter, but, as he did so, drew his revolver. Billy was too quick for him, and sent a bullet crashing through his brain. He seized his horse, jumped into the saddle, and galloped away as fast as he could, over the rough road.\n\nThe thieves in the hut heard the noise and were soon in hard pursuit, and gaining rapidly on him. He abandoned his horse, gave him a sharp slap on the shoulders, and he went bounding away down the mountain side. He crept up into some brush, and had the satisfaction of seeing the robbers rush by him, and heard them firing at what they supposed was Billy on the horse.\n\nWhen they were gone he slipped down and struck out for Horseshoe Station, distant about twenty-five miles. He traveled hard all night and reached the station at daylight. When he had related his experience, a band was organized to puruse the robbers. When the company formed for this purpose reached the rendezvous of the men, they found it deserted, and could find no trace of the route taken by the fleeing robbers.\n\nIndian depredations in the neighborhood of the Express headquarters continued to grow worse from day to day, until they became so bad that it was decided to stop the pony express entirely for awhile, and to only run the stages occasionally. But this did not prevent the Indians from attacking the stage when it did run, and only a few days after this decision was made, several hundred Sioux attacked the overland stage between Split Rock and Three Crossings, plundered the coach, killed the driver and two passengers, and badly wounded Lieutenant Flowers, the assistant division agent.\n\nAfter this robbery and murder by the Indians a party of the stage company's men and pony express riders was organized to hunt down the murderous Sioux, and if possible drive them from the country.\n\nThe party was headed by Wild Bill, the famous Indian fighter, and soon got upon the trail of the Indians. Pushing rapidly forward they at last discovered the Indians camped on the opposite side of Clear Creek, a tributary of Powder River. There were several hundred of them, and they seemed to be perfectly free from any thoughts of danger, for they had no scouts posted and were evidently relying for safety upon the fact that they were under their own vine and fig tree, with no white men within many miles of their camp.\n\nThe Indians outnumbered their white avengers three to one, so after taking the lay of the camp, upon the advice of Wild Bill, it was decided to wait until it was nearly dark, and then, after creeping as close to them as possible, make a dash through the camp, open a general fire, and then stampede the horses.\n\nThis plan was successfully carried out. The Indians taken completely by surprise, were bewildered, astounded, and did not comprehend the situation until the whites had ridden pell-mell through their camp and got away with not only the horses which the Indians had stolen from the whites, but with those also that belonged to the Indians.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nFIGHTING FOR THE UNION.\n\nIn 1862 Billy, or Bill as he was now more commonly called, joined an expedition against the Indians in the capacity of guide and scout to Col. Clark, who was in command of the 9th Kansas Volunteers. They had several engagements with the Indians but none of any special importance.\n\nAfter his return from this expedition he was summoned home by the serious illness of his mother. On his arrival home he found his mother dying, and when she was, soon after, borne to the grave and forever buried from his sight, Bill was distracted. His mother had been to him the one object that seemed to make his life worth living.\n\nTo drown the unbearable sorrow that was destroying all desire to live, he plunged into a career of dissipation, and would soon have gone to ruin had it not been for the fact that some of his old frontier friends got him enlisted in the volunteer service of the United States army.\n\nThe 7th Kansas regiment of volunteer infantry, known as \"Jennison's Jayhawkers\" had just re-organized and re-enlisted as veterans, and before Bill was aware what had been done, several of his old-time friends, who were now veterans of the Union, had him enlisted for the war in the 7th Kansas infantry. In the spring of 1864 the regiment went to Tennessee, and reached Memphis just after the memorable defeat of General Sturgiss, at Guntown, Mississippi. The fighting he was now called upon to do was new to him. He was finally made a non-commissioned officer, and placed upon detached duty as scout.\n\nWhile serving in this capacity in Missouri he had a singular meeting with his old fellow Indian fighter of pony express days, Wild Bill. He thus relates the incident in his autobiography: \"I was still acting as scout, when one day I rode ahead of the command, some considerable distance, to pick up all possible information concerning Price's movements. I was dressed in gray clothes, or Missouri jeans, and on riding up to a farm house and entering I saw a man, also dressed in gray costume, sitting at a table eating bread and milk. He looked up as I entered, and startled me by saying:\n\n\"'You little rascal, what are you doing in those secesh clothes?'\n\n\"Judge of my surprise when I recognized in the stranger my old friend and partner, Wild Bill, disguised as a Confederate officer.\n\n\"'I ask you the same question, sir?' said I, without the least hesitation.\n\n\"'Hush! sit down and have some bread and milk, and we'll talk it all over afterwards,' said he.\n\n\"I accepted the invitation and partook of the refreshments. Wild Bill paid the woman of the house, and we went out to the gate where my horse was standing.\n\n\"'Billy, my boy,' said he, 'I am mighty glad to see you. I haven't seen or heard of you since we got busted on that St. Louis horse race.'\n\n\"'What are you doing here?' I asked.\n\n\"'I am a scout under General McNiel. For the last few days I have been with General Marmaduke's division of Price's army, in disguise as a Southern officer from Texas, as you see me now,' said he.\n\n\"'That's exactly the kind of business that I am out on to-day,' said I, 'and I want to get some information concerning Price's movements.'\n\n\"'I'll give you all that I have;' and he then went on and told me all that he knew regarding Price's intentions, and the number and condition of his men. He then asked about my mother, and when he learned that she was dead he was greatly surprised and grieved; he thought a great deal of her, for she had treated him almost as one of her own children. He finally took out a package, which he had concealed about his person, and handing it to me, he said:\n\n\"'Here are some letters which I want you to give to General McNeil.'\n\n\"'All right,' said I as I took them, 'but where will I meet you again?'\n\n\"'Never mind that,' he replied, 'I am getting so much valuable information that I propose to stay a little while longer in this disguise.' Thereupon we shook hands and parted.\"\n\nIn this connection it may be of interest to the reader to know some further particulars concerning this zealous Union Scout, Wild Bill. The following description and estimate of his character is from the pen of Gen. George A. Custer, under whom he served as guide and scout:\n\n\"Among the white scouts were numbered some of the most noted of their class. The most prominent among them was Wild Bill, whose highly varied career was made the subject of an illustrated sketch in one of the popular monthly publications several years ago. Wild Bill was a strange character, just the one whom a novelist would gloat over. He was a plainsman in every sense of the word, and yet unlike any other of his class. In person he was about six feet, one inch in height, straight as the straightest of the warriors whose implacable foe he was. He had broad shoulders, well-formed chest and limbs, and a face strikingly handsome; a sharp, clear, blue eye, which stared you straight in the face when in conversation; a finely shaped nose, inclined to be aquiline; a well-turned mouth, with lips only partially concealed by a handsome mustache. His hair and complexion were those of a perfect blonde. The former was worn in uncut ringlets, falling carelessly over his powerfully formed shoulders. Whether on foot or on horseback, he was one of the most perfect types of physical manhood I ever saw. Of his courage there could be no doubt; it had been brought to the test on too many occasions to admit of a doubt. His skill in the use of the pistol and rifle was unerring, while his deportment was exactly the opposite of what might be expected from a man of his surroundings. It was entirely free from all bluster or bravado. He seldom spoke of himself unless requested to do so. His coversation, strange to say, never bordered either on the vulgar or blasphemous. His influence among the frontiersmen was unbounded, his word was law; and many are the personal quarrels and disturbances which he has checked among his comrades by his simple announcement that 'this has gone far enough,'—if need be, followed by the ominous warning that when persisted in or renewed, the quarreler 'must settle it with me.'\n\n\"Wild Bill was anything but a quarrelsome man; yet no one but himself could enumerate the many conflicts in which he had been engaged, and which had almost always resulted in the death of his adversary. I have a personal knowledge of at least half a dozen men whom he had at various times killed, one of these being at the time a member of my command. Yet he always escaped unhurt.\"\n\nThe friendship that had sprung up between these two men never grew cold, but rather increased as the years rolled by, remained unimpaired to the time of Wild Bill's untimely and tragic death.\n\nBill remamed with the army as a soldier-scout until 1865, when he was detailed for special service at headquarters in St. Louis. It was there he met and courted Miss Louisa, who afterwards became Mrs. Cody.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nLAYS OUT AND BOOMS A TOWN.\n\nFor some time after his marriage, Cody conducted a hotel called the Golden Rule House, at Salt Creek Valley, Kansas.\n\nThis very same hotel had at one time been kept by Cody's mother, and so Bill was very well received by the people of Salt Creek Valley, and with their encouragement and patronage did a good business.\n\nBut his adventureous nature could not long endure the monotonous routine of hotel life, and he was soon again acting as a guide and scout for the Government at the military post at Elsworth.\n\nIt was while so employed he first met General Custer. Bill was scouting in the vicinity of Fort Hays, when General Custer came up to the post in search of a guide to pilot him and his escort of ten men to Fort Larned, a distance of sixty-five miles across the country. Cody was selected for this duty.\n\nIn his autobiography he relates the incident as follows:\n\n\"I was ordered by the commanding officer to guide General Custer to his desired destination, and I soon received word from the general that he would start out in the morning with the intention of making the trip in one day. Early in the morning, after a good night's rest, I was on hand mounted on my large mouse colored mule—an animal of great endurance—and ready for the journey; when the general saw me he said:\n\n\"'Cody, I want to travel fast, and go through as quickly as possible, and I don't think that mule of yours is fast enough for me.'\n\n\"'General, never mind the mule, he'll get there as soon as your horses. The mule is a good one.'\n\n\"'Very well; go ahead then,' said he, but he looked as if he thought I would delay the party on the road.\n\n\"For the first fifteen miles, until we came to the Smoky Hill River, which we were to cross, I could hardly keep the mule in advance of the general, who rode a frisky, impatient and ambitious thoroughbred steed; indeed, the whole party was finely mounted. The general repeatedly told me that the mule was 'no good,' and that I ought to have a good horse. But after crossing the river and striking the sandhills, I began letting my mule out a little, and putting the persuaders to him. He was soon out-traveling the horses, and by the time we had made about half the distance to Fort Larned, I occasionally had to wait for the general or some of his party, as their horses were beginning to show signs of fatigue.\n\n\"'General, how about this mule?' I asked at last.\n\n\"'Cody, you have a better vehicle than I thought you had,' was his reply.\n\n\"From that time on to Fort Larned I had no trouble in keeping ahead of the party. We rode into the fort at 4 o'clock in the afternoon with about half the escort only, the rest having lagged behind.\"\n\nA short time after his return to Fort Hays, Bill was ordered to report to the Tenth Cavalry as scout to guide an expedition against a band of Indians that had recently made a raid on the Kansas Pacific railroad, killing a number of men and running off a hundred horses and mules.\n\nThe cavalry, a colored regiment, quickly overtook the Indians, but soon wished they hadn't, for the Indians turned upon their pursuers, captured their cannon and stampeded the regiment.\n\nShortly after the above incident, Bill visited the town of Elsworth, where he met a man named William Rose, who persuaded Bill to go into business with him as a real estate promoter.\n\nRose was a contractor on the Kansas Pacific Railroad, and had a contract for grading near Fort Hays. He succeeded in convincing Cody that a million could easily be made in the enterprise.\n\nThe scheme was to purchase a site for a town at a point where they knew the Kansas Pacific would cross Big Creek, about a mile from Fort Hays, lay it out in town lots and boom the business for all there was in it.\n\nWhen the site was surveyed and the lots laid out, they gave the new town the name of Rome. To make things boom, they gave a lot to anyone who would build upon it, reserving for themselves the corner lots and other desirable locations.\n\nTheir scheme was a success. In less than one month they had a town consisting of about two hundred frame and log houses, a hotel, several stores, and a saloon. Their fortune was now made, and they would frequently meet and figure up their gains, which as yet were in the future, but very near—almost within their grasp.\n\nAbout this time, Dr. Webb, who was agent for the railroad, and whose business it was to locate towns, came to Rome and sought the proprietors.\n\n\"You have a flourishing town, I see,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Bill. \"Let us give you a lot. All you have to do is to build on it.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said the Doctor. \"But would you not like a partner?\"\n\n\"A partner! No, sir; we have too good a thing to 'whack up' with any one,\" said Bill loftily.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Doctor, \"I am agent for the railroad, and it is my business to locate towns.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said Rose. \"So we have saved the company great expense. Here we have a town already started.\"\n\n\"But the company expect to make money selling land and town lots, and unless you give the company or me a show in this matter, I will have to start a town near you and run competition.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Rose; \"we have the 'bulge' on you.\"\n\nThe Doctor departed, and staked a place about one mile east of Rome and called it Hays City. He took pains to inform everyone that there the railroad company would build shops and establish headquarters. The result is easily and quickly told. All the houses in Rome were pulled down and carted to Hays City. Cody & Rose found their site deserted, the only sign of a town having been there was the lone shanty where they kept their little stock of merchandise. They too, finally pulled up stakes, and accepted two lots apiece in Hays City as a gift from Dr. Webb. Bill did not try to build another town. He returned to his favorite pursuit o£ scouting and hunting. Rose accepted a contract for grading a part of the railroad, and Bill undertook to furnish the camp with buffalo meat.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nA RUN FOR LIFE.\n\nOne day in the spring of 1868, while Buffalo Bill was engaged as hunter for the Kansas Pacific Railroad Company, he mounted Brigham and started for Smoky Hill River. After galloping for about twenty miles he stopped on a small hill overlooking the valley of that beautiful river, and was gazing on the landscape, when suddenly he saw a band of about thirty Indians some half a mile distant. From the way they jumped on their horses he knew they had seen him as soon as they came in sight.\n\nBuffalo Bill knew that the only chance he had for life was to make a run for it, and he immediately wheeled and started back to the railroad. Brigham seemed to understand what was up, and struck out as if he comprehended full well that it was to be a run for life. He crossed a ravine in a few jumps, and on reaching a ridge beyond, Buffalo Bill drew rein, looked back and saw the Indians tearing after him at full speed and evidently well mounted. Had Brigham been fresh Buffalo Bill would have had no fear as to the result of the race, but as he was not, the outcome seemed decidedly dubious.\n\nHis pursuers were evidently gaining on him for a while, then Brigham suddenly made a spurt and shot [drawing] J. MANZ & CO. Engs ahead again. But he could not keep up his speed for any great distance, and when he had run about three miles further, eight or nine of the Indians were not more than three hundred yards behind, and five or six of these seemed to be shortening the gap at every jump. Brigham now exerted himself to his utmost, and for the next three or four miles got \"right down to business.\" But the Indians were about as well mounted as Bill was, and one of their horses in particular—a spotted animal—kept gaining on him all the time. The other horses were strung out behind for a distance of two miles or more, but still chasing as hard as they could.\n\nThe Indian on the spotted horse was armed with a rifle, and would occasionally send a bullet whistling along in unpleasant proximity to Buffalo Bill's head. He saw that this Indian must be checked, or a stray bullet from his gun might do Brigham or himself some harm; so, suddenly stopping his horse and quickly wheeling him around, he raised his rifle to his shoulder, took deliberate aim at the Indian and his horse, hoping to hit one or the other, and fired. The Indian was not eighty yards away at the time, and at the crack of the rifle down went his horse. Not waiting to see if he recovered, Buffalo Bill turned Brigham and fairly went flying from the place; he had urgent business elsewhere about that time, and was in something of a hurry to get there. The other Indians had gained on him while he was engaged in shooting at their leader, and they sent several shots whizzing past him. Buffalo Bill occasionally wheeled in his saddle and returned their fire, one of his shots breaking a leg of one of their horses.\n\nThe chase was kept up until within three miles of the railroad track, where two companies of soldiers were stationed for the purpose of protecting the workmen from the Indians. One of the outposts saw the Indians chasing across the prairie and gave the alarm. There was mounting in hot haste, which the Indians observed, and they turned and ran in the direction from which they had come.\n\nUpon learning what had happened, Captain Nolen of the Tenth Cavalry, with forty of his men determined to pursue the Indians. Buffalo Bill was given a fresh horse, and invited to join in the chase. As the horses of the cavalry men were all fresh, they soon began shortening the distance between themselves and the redskins. Before the Indians had gone five miles the cavalry overtook and killed eight of their number. The others succeeded in making their escape.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nEARNS THE NAME OF \"BUFFALO BILL\"\n\nBill found his contract to furnish the camp with meat was a pretty difficult one to carry out.\n\nFor several days no buffaloes were seen any where in the vicinity of the camp, and the meat supply was running decidedly low.\n\nBut one day when Bill had just placed his horse \"Brigham\" into a team that was used in drawing a scraper, one of Rose's horses having given out, one of the workmen discovered a bunch of buffaloes just coming over a distant hill. Bill jerked the harness off his horse,—the horse that afterwards became so famous—leaving the blind bridle on, and mounted without a saddle. Snatching up his gun, which he called \"Lucretia Borgia,\" and which was an improved breech-loading needle gun, just received from the government, he dashed away toward the game.\n\nJust then the gates of the fort opened and a captain and several lieutenants rode out, they too having discovered the buffalo, and were intent on a chase after them. As Bill rode up to them the Captain said:\n\n\"Well, my man, you are not going after the buffalo on that horse! It takes a spirited and blooded horse to take such game.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" said Bill, innocently, as if he were ignorant of the business.\n\n\"Yes, it does; but as we only want the tongues and a few tenderloin steaks, you may follow us and take the rest of the game.\"\n\nBill bowed low in acknowledgment of the favor granted him, while the officers galloped off to overtake the buffalo. Bill knew the habits of the animal, and instead of riding directly toward them, as the officers did, he took a straight course for the creek, where he knew they would cross. In this way he arrived there as soon as they did, while the officers were in the rear about three hundred yards. He immediately threw off the old blind bridle and let \"Brigham\" have his own way. The horse understood his business. He carried Bill close up to the side of one buffalo, and as soon as he heard the shot and saw the animal fall, he dashed up alongside another, and so on. There were only eleven buffaloes in the herd. These were all killed in quick succession, only one shot missing aim. When the last animal was down Brigham stopped, and Bill leaped from his back, just as the others rode up. Bill saluted them in royal style and said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, here are your tongues and tenderloins.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" asked the Captain in astonishment.\n\n\"My name is Cody,\" said Bill.\n\n\"What, not Bill, the scout?\"\n\n\"The same, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I must say that horse of yours has good running points.\"\n\n\"Yes, a few.\"\n\n\"And what a hunter you are. Indeed, I never saw finer sport.\"\n\n\"Brigham did the hunting, sir. I had only to do the shooting. When I fired and missed, he would give me another chance at the same animal. If I missed the second time, he would dash away as much as to say, 'You are no good.'\"\n\nThe Captain gave Bill a pressing invitation to come to the fort, and assured him that he would be glad to give him employment, whenever he should have need of a scout.\n\nAt Fort Wallace was a scout named Comstock, who was thought by some to be more expert in hunting and killing buffaloes than was Cody. It was arranged by mutual friends to have a trial of skill. The stake was $500, and both men found ready backers.\n\nThe place was twenty miles east of Sheridan, Kansas. The contest was extensively advertised, and hundreds of people from as far east as St. Louis, went to see the match.\n\nIt was agreed that both men should ride into the herd, and Cody should take the right side, and Comstock the left. Cody was mounted on Brigham, and had his trusty rifle Lucretia, a 50 caliber. He felt confident of success, because he knew his horse could not be excelled, and his gun had no equal. At the appointed day the company assembled, and soon a herd of buffaloes was discovered quietly grazing. A man to keep tally went with each hunter, while the spectators remained at a safe distance.\n\nCody rode to the head of his part of the herd, and by killing the leaders, and pressing the others from right to left, he soon had them running in a circle. He kept up the race until he had sixty-nine buffaloes lying dead in a very small circle. Comstock rode after his and killed the rearmost animal each time. The result was that he had only forty-six dead animals, and they were scattered along the plains for three or four miles. As may be guessed, Cody's plan made his skill appear to great advantage. The championship was cheerfully accorded to him. This circumstance, coupled with the fact, that as hunter for the Kansas Pacific Railroad Company, he had in eighteen months killed 4,280 buffaloes, gave him the name of \"Buffalo Bill.\"\n\nThe grand finale of his contest with Comstock may be mentioned here. On the last run he took both saddle and bridle from his horse, and, although the ladies of the company begged him not to undertake so rash a feat, he dashed away on his well-trained horse without either saddle or bridle. He separated a big bull from the herd, and headed him toward the company of spectators. On they came, nearer and nearer to the assembly, and it seemed that the ladies must be run down before the infuriated beast and the wild rider. The ladies were frightened, and screamed lustily. Just as the buffalo was a few feet distant, \"Brigham\" came up alongside at one bound, and Cody sent a ball through the heart of the bull, which rolled in the dust at the very feet of the spectators, while Bill leaped to the ground and \"Brigham\" stopped short in his tracks. This brilliant feat won round after round of applause for \"Buffalo Bill.\"\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTAMES THE COW-BOYS\n\nTwenty-five years ago, when Buffalo Bill lived in Hays City, Kansas was a pretty tough country, and there was sometimes something else for him to do besides fighting Indians and hunting buffaloes.\n\nThere were cowboys and rough characters galore and they used to run things to suit themselves. Among the towns set down on the hot prairie but ambitious for future greatness, that had suffered greatly by the depredations and lawlessness of the rough element, was Abilene—some folks call it the City of the Plains. It was almost as much as a Marshal's life was worth to arrest a cowboy in Abilene, and even if he did manage to get his prisoner in the lock-up, the fellow's cronies would come swooping down on the town, terrorize the citizens, intimidate the jailer, and release the culprit. In time the boldness of the cowboys became so intolerable that the Council determined to take extraordinary measures for the protection of the citizens and the apprehension of the marauders.\n\nAt that time Cody was being talked about very much on account of his recent Buffalo killing match with Comstock. All through the West he was known for his intrepidity as well as for his extraordinary success in handling rough characters. T. J. Henry, then Mayor of Abilene, and now the owner of an extensive irrigation ranch in Colorado, was instructed to write to Cody and learn how much he would demand to take the Marshalship of the town and rid the locality of its undesirable element. Cody laconically replied:\n\n\"One hundred dollars a month.\"\n\nThe Abilene Council thought the figure was too high and the negotiations were temporarily permitted to drop. Shortly afterward a negro cowboy was arrested for being disorderly. After considerable difficulty, he was locked up. A couple of hours later a party of his cowboy friends came riding into town, whooping and firing their pistols into the air, and almost before the town had realized what had happened, they had released the prisoner and were scudding away over the prairie with him.\n\nThis was the climax to many similar outrages, and it aroused the town to a pitch of frenzy. Mayor Henry called for a posse of citizens to follow the miscreants, and nearly every able-bodied man in the corporation responded. They were all heavily armed. Several miles out of town they came upon the cowboys, who had carelessly encamped for the night. The Mayor advanced at the head of his posse, and pointing out the fact that the citizens outnumbered the cowboys two to one, and were prepared to fight to the death, demanded the return of the culprit. After considerable parleying, the cowboys relinquished the negro and he was triumphantly returned to the lock-up. That night a heavy guard of citizens surrounded the jail.\n\nThe next morning brought with it renewed excitement. Everyone was nervous and expectant. All looked for further trouble and probable bloodshed. Gangs of cowboys began to gather early in the day, and signs of brewing trouble were everywhere apparent.\n\nAfter a consultation with the Council Mayor Henry sent word to Cody to come at once to Abilene—at his own price. The following day he arrived.\n\nAbout 9 o'clock in the morning the Mayor was sitting in his office when a well-built, wiry-looking man entered. He wore his hair long, beneath a slouched hat, and the Mayor thought he was a cowboy.\n\n\"Are you Mayor Henry?\" asked the stranger.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Well, my name's Cody—Buffalo Bill they call me and—I've come over to look after the 'boys.'\"\n\nThe Mayor extended his hand. \"You've come just in time,\" he said. \"The devil's to pay here and something's got to be done mighty quick. What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"The first thing,\" responded Cody, slowly weighing his words—\"is to pass an ordinance making it a misdemeanor to carry firearms. I want you to get the Council together and pass it right away. Then I want some copies of the ordinance printed.\"\n\nThe Mayor smiled incredulously. \"Why,\" he exclaimed, \"how on earth do you expect to enforce such an ordinance?\"\n\n\"That's my part of the work,\" said Cody. \"You pass the ordinance and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nThe Council was hurriedly convened and the ordinance passed. Then a hundred or more copies were struck off. That night the new Marshal tacked them up all over town. The next morning everybody read the ordinance and went around with broad smiles on their faces. The cowboys were especially amused. Nobody thought for a moment that the ordinance could be enforced.\n\nAbout 3 o'clock in the afternoon Cody was walking down the middle of the main street, when an uproar in a saloon attracted his attention. Quietly crossing over, he entered. A crowd of cowboys were inside and one of them in particular seemed to be endeavoring to see how much of a disturbance he could make. Going up to the fellow, Cody looked him square in the eyes and said, quietly:\n\n\"Say, stranger, ain't you making just a little bit too much noise for the good of this town?\"\n\nThe cowboy looked at the speaker in undisguised amazement.\n\n\"Who the —— be you?\" he demanded, contemptuously.\n\n\"I'm the man who is paid for taking care of fellows like you,\" was the reply.\n\n\"So you're the new Marshal, air ye?\"\n\n\"I guess I am.\"\n\n\"Well, you be——\"\n\nCody interrupted him. \"Don't swear, stranger,\" he said, \"it don't pay.\"\n\nJust then the cowboy's coat flew back and the Marshal noticed a revolver in the fellow's belt.\n\n\"Don't you know that's against the ordinance?\" he said. \"Better give me that.\"\n\n\"I'll see you jiggered first,\" cried the cowboy, and he made a movement to draw the \"shooting iron.\" But the Marshal was too quick for him. Before he could lay his hand on the revolver, Cody's fist caught him square between the eyes. He dropped like a log. The Marshal stooped down, relieved the prostrate man of his revolver and then quietly walked out of the saloon. The other men in the place, many of them the toughest kind of border desperadoes, were completely awed by the audacity of the thing.\n\nThe following day, as the Marshal was passing along the street, he saw another cowboy with a couple of long, murderous-looking revolvers ostentatiously displayed in his belt.\n\n\"You have to give them up, stranger,\" he said, approaching the fellow.\n\nThe cowboy started toward the Marshal with blood in his eye.\n\n\"Say,\" he yelled, \"you're the fellow that floored my brother yesterday, ain't yer?\"\n\n\"May be I am.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm just going to wipe up the earth with you.\"\n\nCody stood still, put his thumbs under his arms and looked the cowboy in the face.\n\n\"Now, look here, stranger,\" he said, \"there's no use getting hot. Let's argue this thing out a little.\"\n\nThe cowboy, however, was in no humor for argument. His hands instinctively went down to his belt. The revolvers never came out. One of the Marshal's sledge-hammer blows sent him sprawling, and before he could recover his equilibrium his revolvers had gone to join the one confiscated from his brother.\n\nSeveral similar incidents soon convinced the cowboys that they had an extraordinary man to deal with, and in a few weeks, under the guardianship of the new Marshal, Abilene became as quiet and orderly as the most conservative citizen could wish for.\n\nCody remained three months, and for his services in ridding the town of its desperadoes, often at the peril of his own life, he received the munificent sum of $300. But he made no complaint. It was the price he had himself set upon his services.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nGUIDE, SCOUT, AND INDIAN FIGHTER.\n\nSoon after the incident recorded in the preceding chapter, Buffalo Bill reported to Captain Parker, in command at Fort Larned, for duty as scout and guide.\n\nGen. Hazen soon after arrived at the fort and took command. There were three hundred lodges of Indians about the fort. They were restless and anxious to take the war path, but were kept quiet by the efforts of the soldiers. Gen. Hazen wanted to go to Fort Harper, and ordered Bill and twenty infantrymen to accompany him, as he rode in a six mule wagon. They went as far as Fort Zarah, where they left the General to go alone, and had orders to return to Fort Larned next morning. But Buffalo Bill told the sergeant that he would return to Larned that afternoon, and saddling his mule, he set out alone. When about half way he was \"jumped\" by a band of Indians, who rode up saying, \"How! How!\" and one reached out his hand to Buffalo Bill for a hearty shake. He grasped the hand and was immediately jerked forward by the brave, while another redskin grabbed his mule by the bridle, and another snatched his revolver from the hostler, another grabbed his rifle from him, while still another struck him on the head with a tomahawk. They then started off towards the Arkansas River, one leading the mule, while the rest lashed him from behind. They were yelling, whooping, singing, as only Indians can when having everything their own way. These were some of the Indians who had been left at Fort Larned that morning. Bill soon discovered that the whole band were on the war path, and these were only a squad from the main army.\n\nOne of the chiefs came up to him and asked him where he had been. A happy thought came to him at that instant, and he answered, \"I have been searching for the 'Whoa-haws.'\" The Indians used this term to designate the cattle furnished them by the government. The old chief was anxious to know more about the \"Whoa-haws.\" Bill told him they were back a little way, and he had been sent by Gen. Hazen to tell him that they were for his people. The chief asked if any soldiers were with the herd. Bill said there were. The chief seemed delighted; Bill then told him that the treatment he had received was mean and cowardly, especially as he was on such a friendly errand. The chief then made the young men give up Bill's arms. He was anxious to get the cattle, and believed also there were \"heap of soldiers coming.\" Bill had been lying to him, but thought himself justified under the circumstances. The old chief told him to go back and bring the cattle up. This Bill consented to do, and started off, intending when in the valley, out of sight of the Indians, to put spurs to his mule and flee to Fort Larned. He had gone but a little way, when, on looking back, he saw fifteen Indians following him, he urged his mule to a lope. He reached the valley and turned sharply off and headed toward the fort. The Indians came in sight, and seeing him fleeing, started in hot pursuit. They kept up the chase for about nine miles, Fort Larned being still six miles distant, when the old road was reached, and Buffalo Bill put spurs to his mule and urged him to his greatest speed. The Indians came on, but did not gain much. At sundown Fort Larned was four miles away, but in plain sight. Bill's mule began to give out, while the horses of the Indians seemed fresh, and were gaining rapidly. When two miles from the fort, several of the Indians were only a quarter of a mile behind the fleeing scout. Fortunately, he saw a squad of soldiers in a government wagon going to the fort. He hailed them, and hastily told his story. They turned aside in a clump of trees near at hand, and waited the Indians, who came dashing along. They fired upon them, killing two; the others turned, and escaped in the dark. The two were scalped, and then Buffalo Bill and his comrades moved into the fort, where all the soldiers were under arms, and preparing for an attack, as they had heard the firing.\n\nWhen Buffalo Bill reported to the Commander, he found him with all his scouts trying to find a man who would volunteer to carry a dispatch to General Sheridan, then at Fort Hays, sixty-five miles away. None were willing to go. Finally Cody volunteered, and although he had ridden sixty miles that day and was tired and hungry, he mounted a horse and left Fort Larned, to ride to Fort Hays in the night, not a star appearing, and a storm gathering in the sky. His route lay through a country infested by hostile Indians, but he reached General Sheridan's headquarters a little after daybreak, and delivered the message.\n\nAfter taking a nap of two hours, and visiting with some old acquaintances at Hays City, near the fort, he reported again to General Sheridan, as he had been requested to do. He found him trying to persuade some scout to carry a message to Fort Dodge, ninety-five miles away. But none would volunteer, though the pay was large. Several messengers had been killed on that route, and the scouts were chary about taking the chances. It seemed hard to ask Buffalo Bill to do it, since he had just ridden one hundred and twenty-five miles the day and night before. No one would volunteer, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon Cody mounted a fine horse and started. He rode seventy miles that night, and reached Saw Log Crossing, where he found a company of colored troops under command of Major Cox. Here he slept an hour, got a fresh horse, and was soon on the way again. It was now just sunrise. About 10 o'clock he reached Fort Dodge. He found the Commander anxious to send messages to Fort Larned, but no scout would undertake the trip. Fort Dodge is sixty-five miles from Fort Larned. As the latter post was Cody's headquarters, he volunteered to make the trip for the Commander. The Commander said he would be glad to send the message, but it seemed too hard for Buffalo Bill to make the journey after all he had done, especially as they had no fresh horse to offer him, and only a mule as a substitute. But Cody was anxious to return, and he mounted the mule and commenced his homeward trip, leaving Fort Dodge at dark. He did not take the main and generally traveled road, knowing the Indians would be watching that for scouts. Unfortunately his mule got away as he stopped to get a drink at the creek. He tried to catch him, but the obstinate animal trotted on ahead, just out of his reach, the balance of the night. Just at sunrise he came in sight of Fort Larned. When the morning guns echoed over the plains, they were just half a mile from the fort, the mule trotting along ahead, and Bill trudging after him afoot. He was provoked. Raising his gun, he aimed and fired, and lodged a ball in the mule's hip. He shot him again, and continued to pepper him from the rear until he dropped dead. The troops at the fort hearing the firing, came rushing out to see the cause. They all agreed that the mule had been served just right. Buffalo Bill reported to Captain Parker, delivered the message, and then lay down and took a long, refreshing sleep. General Hazen had returned to Fort Larned, and wanted to send some messages to General Sheridan, so that night found Buffalo Bill again on the road, mounted on a good horse, bound for Fort Hays, the headquarters of General Sheridan. The next morning found the intrepid scout again in the presence of General Sheridan, who was astonished when he knew of the rides he had made from post to post, since he saw him two or three days before. He had ridden 355 miles in fifty-eight riding hours, most of the time in the night, making an average of over six miles an hour, through a trackless plain infested by hostile Indians.\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHE CHIEF OF SCOUTS.\n\nGeneral Sheridan retained Buffalo Bill at the fort, and appointed him Chief of Scouts and assigned him to duty with the Fifth Cavalry, which was just about to set out on an expedition against the Dog Soldier Indians, who were then making considerable trouble along the Republican River.\n\nThe expedition set out for the Beaver Creek Country almost immediately after Buffalo Bill's appointment was made, and met with exciting incidents from the very first day of its march.\n\n[drawing]\n\nJ. MANZ & CO Engs.\n\nBuffalo Bill kept the officer's mess well supplied with fresh buffalo meat, and one day surprised the Colonel by running seven big buffaloes straight into camp, and killing them all in rapid succession in the presence, and almost at the very feet of the officer.\n\nThe Colonel was somewhat dumfounded, and not altogether pleased with the incident. He went up to Buffalo Bill and asked for an explanation. \"I can't allow any such business as this,\" he said, \"what do you mean by it?\"\n\n\"I didn't care about asking for any wagons this time, Colonel,\" replied Buffalo Bill, \"so I thought I would make the buffaloes furnish their own transportation.\"\n\nThe point of Bill's reply rested in the fact that only a day or two before when he asked the Colonel to send out some wagons to fetch back the buffaloes he intended to shoot the Colonel replied: \"First kill your buffaloes and then ask for the wagons.\" The Colonel took the remark good-naturedly, and Bill was permitted thereafter to have as many wagons sent out after the buffaloes he intended to kill as he deemed to be necessary to bring in the carcases.\n\nOn the second day's march the cavalry arrived at the South fork of Beaver Creek, where they discovered a large fresh Indian trail. They rapidly followed it up for about eight miles, when suddenly they discovered a large number of Indians on the bluffs just ahead of them.\n\nA company of cavalry and scouts were in advance of the main command nearly a mile. Suddenly about four hundred Indians charged down upon them, and a lively fight immediately commenced. The company was soon supported by the full force of cavalry. The Indians also kept increasing in numbers all the while until the fight became quite general. Quite a number were killed and wounded on each side. The Indians were evidently fighting to give their families and village a chance to get away. They had been surprised with a larger force than they had expected to see in that part of the country. The fight was continued until dark, when the Indians took to the hills and annoyed the troops by firing down upon them from the bluffs. Several times during the night the command was ordered out to dislodge them. Next morning not a redskin was to be found in the neighborhood.\n\nThe cavalry struck out on the trail, and soon came to the spot where the Indians had camped the day before. It could easily be seen that the village was a very large one, consisting of about five hundred lodges; and the command pushed forward from this point on the trail which ran back toward Prairie Dog Creek.\n\nThey soon came in sight of the retreating village, and the warriors turned back to give them battle. They set the grass on fire between them and the troops in order to secure as much delay as possible. The cavalry kept up a running fight for the remainder of the day, the Indians repeatedly attempting to lead them off the track of their flying village, but their trail was easily followed, as they were continually dropping tepee poles, camp kettles, furs and all heavy articles, belonging to them. They were evidently scattering and it was hard for the cavalry to keep on the main trail. When dark set in the command went into camp, it being useless to try to follow the Indians after nightfall.\n\nLate in the afternoon of the next day the Indians were discovered going over a hill some distance ahead of the cavalry, and when they saw that they would be overtaken, the main body of warriors once more turned back and fought the cavalry; but they were continually driven back, until darkness set in, and the cavalry camped for the night.\n\nNext mornng it was found that the Indians had scattered in every direction. The main trail was followed up to the Republican River, where the cavalry then made a cut off and went north towards the Platte River. They found however, that the Indians by traveling night and day had got a long start, and the General concluded that it was useless to follow them any further, as they had been pushed so hard and given such a scare that they would leave the Republican country and go north across the Union Pacific railroad.\n\nBuffalo Bill continued to act as Chief of Scouts until 1872, and had many exciting fights with Indians. He was successful in all his expeditions, and was a favorite with the various officers of the army under whom he did service, including such distinguished generals as William T. Sherman, Phil. H. Sheridan, Nelson A. Miles, Eugene A. Carr, James B. Fry, Wesley Merritt, W. H. Emory, Col. James. W. Forsyth, and many other officers under whom he served directly as guide, scout and Indian fighter.\n\nGeneral Sheridan's estimate of the value of his services as guide and scout, as expressed in that officer's \"Autobiography,\" will serve to show why Buffalo Bill was held in such high favor by the fighting officers of the army.\n\nAfter describing the difficulties encountered in conducting a campaign against the Indians on the blizzard-swept plains of the northwest in the winter of '68, he says:\n\n\"The difficulties and hardships to be encountered had led several experienced officers of the army and some frontiersmen, like old Jim Bridger, the famous scout and guide of earher days, to discourage the project. I decided to go in person, bent on showing the Indians that they were not secure from punishment because of inclement weather—an ally on which they had hitherto relied with much assurance. We started, and the very first night a blizzard struck us and carried away our tents. The gale was so violent that they could not be put up again; the rain and snow drenched us to the skin. Shivering from wet and cold, I took refuge under a wagon, and there spent such a miserable night that when morning came the gloomy predictions of old man Bridger and others rose up before me with greatly increased force. The difficulties were now fully realized; the blinding snow, mixed with sleet; the piercing wind, thermometer below zero—with green bushes only for fuel—occasioning intense suffering. Our numbers and companionship alone prevented us from being lost or perishing, a fate that stared in the face the frontiersmen, guides, and scouts on their solitary missions.\n\n\"An important matter had been to secure competent guides for the different columns of troops, for, as I have said, the section of country to be operated in was comparatively unknown.\n\n\"In those days the railroad town of Hays City was filled with so-called 'Indian scouts,' whose common boast was of having slain scores of redskins; but the real scout—that is, a guide and trailer knowing the habits of the Indians—was very scarce, and it was hard to find anybody familiar with the country south of the Arkansas, where the campaign was to be made. Still, about the various military posts there was some good material to select from, and we managed to employ several men, who, from their experience on the plains in various capacities, or from natural instincts and aptitude, soon became excellent guides and courageous and valuable scouts, some of them, indeed, gaining much distinction. Mr. William F. Cody ('Buffalo Bill'), whose renown has since become world-wide, was one of the men thus selected. He received his sobriquet from his marked success in killing buffaloes to supply fresh meat to the construction parties on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. He had lived from boyhood on the plains and passed every experience—herder, hunter, pony-express rider, stagedriver, wagonmaster in the quartermaster's department, and scout of the army, and was first brought to my notice by distinguishing himself in bringing me an important dispatch from Fort Larned to Fort Hays, a distance of sixty-five miles, through a section infested with Indians. The dispatch informed me that the Indians near Larned were preparing to decamp, and this intelligence required that certain orders should be carried to Fort Dodge, ninety-five miles south of Hays. This too being a particularly dangerous route—several couriers having been killed on it—it was impossible to get one of the various Petes, Jacks, or Jims hanging around Hays City to take my communication. Cody, learning of the strait I was in, manfully came to the rescue, and proposed to make the trip to Dodge, though he had just finished his long and perilous ride from Larned. I gratefully accepted his offer, and after a short rest he mounted a fresh horse and hastened on his journey, halting but once to rest on the way, and then only for an hour, the stop being made at Coon Creek, where he got another mount from a troop of cavalry. At Dodge he took some sleep, and then continued on to his own post—Fort Larned—with more dispatches. After resting at Larned he was again in the saddle with tidings for me at Fort Hays, General Hazen sending him this time with word that the villages had fled to the south of the Arkansas. Thus, in all, Cody rode about three hundred and fifty miles in less than sixty hours, and such an exhibition of endurance and courage at that time of the year, and in such weather, was more than enough to convince me that his services would be extremely valuable in the campaign, so I retained him at Fort Hays till the battalion of the Fifth Cavalry arrived, and then made him chief of scouts.\"\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nCATCHING HORSE THIEVES.\n\nThe fact is not generally known that Buffalo Bill is as proficient in the matter of catching horse-thieves as he is in hunting buffaloes and fighting Indians.\n\nBut the following incident which took place while Buffalo Bill was engaged by the government as a guide and scout, as related by him in his autobiography, establishes his reputation in that respect beyond any dispute:\n\n\"In a few minutes more I was on my way to Sheridan, and after settling my business there, I proceeded to Fort Lyon, arriving two days afterward.\n\n\"'I'm glad you've come, Bill,' said General Carr, 'as I have been wanting you for the last two weeks. While we have been at this post several valuable animals, as well as a large number of governmen"
