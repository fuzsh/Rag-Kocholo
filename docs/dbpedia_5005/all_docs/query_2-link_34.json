        "text": "Aug 2, 2019 | 9:06 AM\n\nSaskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo earned a win – and a post-game corn dog – after defeating the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 24-19 at Mosaic Stadium on Thursday.\n\nWith Hamilton up 19-16 with 2:05 remaining in the game, Fajardo orchestrated a 42-yard final drive that culminated in him scoring a five-yard touchdown run where he stretched out his arm to just make contact with the pylon.\n\nFajardo said he had a similar play in practice where he told the coaches he was going to dive for the pylon, which they advised against.\n\n“I felt like I had to run and the only way I was getting in was by diving. I just had tunnel vision on that pylon,” Fajardo said. “(The coaches) want me to protect myself. Sometimes I use myself as a battering ram, it’s just the competitor in me. Any time the game’s on the line or I’m going to the goal line, it doesn’t matter what the score is, I’m always going to put my body at risk.”\n\nFajardo was making his first start as the team’s undisputed starter after the team decided to part ways with injured quarterback Zach Collaros, whom the team traded on Wednesday to the Toronto Argonauts. Collaros suffered a concussion on June 13 against the Tiger-Cats. Fajardo has started all six of the Roughriders games since then.\n\nFajardo finished Thursday’s game by completing 25 of 31 passes for 313 yards, but he didn’t throw a touchdown pass.\n\nThe announced crowd of 29,516 fans at the game held its collective breath during the third quarter when Fajardo injured his ankle, causing him to pound the ground in anger.\n\n“It was more of the, ‘Is my ankle broken,’ kind of slamming,” Fajardo said.\n\nBut the injury wouldn’t keep him out for long and he was soon out there after a quick tape job by the trainers.\n\n“Like I always say, it was a sprinkle of Jesus. Somehow I was able to finish that game, and it’s been a long time since I’ve had a game like that where its come down to the last play.”\n\nFajardo also had 56 rushing yards and that crucial rushing touchdown with 24 seconds left in the game.\n\nHe admitted a craving for a corn dog at the Queen City Ex might have given him that extra burst he needed at the end of the game.\n\n“I’m really excited to get a corn dog to be honest,” Fajardo said. “I’m a big carnival corn dog guy and I was like, ‘Hopefully the game goes well so I can go get a corn dog,’ so that’s probably what gave me the will to score that touchdown.”\n\nRunning back William Powell scored the Green and White’s only other touchdown of the game. He finished the game with 51 rushing yards. Powell has scored a touchdown in five of his first seven games with the Roughriders.\n\nKicker Gabriel Ferraro was three-for-three on field goal attempts. He started his fourth game in a row for the injured Brett Lauther (groin).\n\nTiger-Cats quarterback Dane Evans was making his first start of the season. Starter Jeremiah Masoli tore his ACL in a 23-15 July 26 win over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\n\nEvans completed 19 of 29 passes for 196 yards, a touchdown and one interception. Hamilton running back Anthony Coombs was the receiver on the lone touchdown for the Tiger-Cats. Kicker Lirim Hajrullahu was a perfect four-for-four on field goal attempts.\n\nWhile he didn’t score, wide receiver Shaq Evans had a big game for the team, catching seven passes for 160 yards. After the game, Evans is the CFL’s leading receiver with 587 yards. He passed Tiger-Cats receiver Brandon Banks, who didn’t play due to an injury.\n\nEvans said Fajardo has shown he trusts the second-year receiver to go up and make plays.\n\n“I’m not always the first option, especially on that 51-yarder down the sideline (in Thursday’s game). I was definitely not the first read, I didn’t know he was going to throw me the ball,” Evans said. “He just trusts me that much and he knows that I’m going to go get it.”\n\nEvans said there wasn’t any doubt in the offence’s mind as they headed onto the field for what would be the game-winning drive.\n\n“(Cody) told us we were going to score. That just puts confidence in you when your quarterback comes in there and commands attention like that and tells you what’s going to happen,” Evans said. “He scored the game-winning touchdown and I love that.”\n\nHead coach Craig Dickenson said this team has gotten more comfortable playing with each other every week, which is what has lead to their success following the bye-week.\n\n“There’s not a lot of new faces, but there’s enough new faces that it just took a little bit of time for them to start to gel,” Dickenson said. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be perfect from here on out, but I think what you’re seeing are guys who have played together now for a couple of months and they’re starting to trust each other and work together.”\n\nDickenson said the team can’t get too high or too low following games.\n\n“We beat a good team (Thursday) but we still have a lot of improvement to do,” Dickenson said.\n\nDefensive linemen Zack Evans and Micah Johnson both left with undisclosed injuries and did not return. Four-year veteran Makana Henry and rookie Charbel Dabire replaced the two injured players. Henry finished with a sack while Dabire recorded three tackles.\n\nThe Roughriders (4-3) will next play against the Montreal Alouettes (3-2) on Aug. 9. Montreal is set to play the Ottawa Redblacks (2-4) Friday."
