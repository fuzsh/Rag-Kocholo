IT’S A TURNING POINT FOR ALL AT A BENEFIT CONCERT HEADLINED BY JULIETTE, LAYLA, WILL, AND SCARLETT ON “NASHVILLE,” OCTOBER 23

“Don’t Open That Door” – In advance of a benefit concert starring all of Edgehill’s best acts, label head Jeff Fordham (Oliver Hudson) demands that his new artists sell themselves as hot, sexy personas—which is a major struggle for Scarlett, and Layla knows it. Since Rayna is unsure about her future as a singer, she plots to buy out Edgehill’s rights to her music, and Gunnar and Avery decide to record new songs with Zoey, Scarlett’s best friend. However, by the end of the concert night, nothing will be the same, on “Nashville,” WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 23 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC Television Network.

“Nashville” stars Connie Britton as Rayna Jaymes, Hayden Panettiere as Juliette Barnes, Eric Close as Teddy Conrad, Charles Esten as Deacon Claybourne, Clare Bowen as Scarlett O’Connor, Jonathan Jackson as Avery Barkley, Sam Palladio as Gunnar Scott, Chris Carmack as Will Lexington, Maisy Stella as Daphne Conrad and Lennon Stella as Maddie Conrad.

Guest starring are Oliver Hudson as Jeff Fordham, Powers Booth as Lamar Wyatt, Judith Hoag as Tandy Hampton, Chaley Rose as Zoey, Aubrey Peeples as Layla and Ed Amatrudo as Glenn Goodman.

“Don’t Open That Door” was written by Dana Greenblatt and directed by Michael Grossman.
