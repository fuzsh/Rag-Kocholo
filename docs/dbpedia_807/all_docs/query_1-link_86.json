        "text": "Have we reached Peak TV?\n\nJOHN LANDGRAF I think we'll hit it in 2017 or 2018, and there will be over 500 scripted original shows.\n\nGARY NEWMAN We know we will have reached Peak TV when dinner-party conversations turn away from, \"What are you watching?\" and go back to, \"Seen any good movies lately?\"\n\nMARK PEDOWITZ We're probably a year or two away.\n\nJENNIFER SALKE I hope we've reached it.\n\nDAVID NEVINS My prognosticating hamsters say 2022. (Laughs.)\n\nCHRIS MCCUMBER When some network decides to reboot Cop Rock.\n\nCINDY HOLLAND I don't think we've reached the peak for on-demand TV, but I think it's probably true that there's too much mediocre television built for the linear age.\n\nCHRIS ALBRECHT There [isn't] a peak when it comes to creativity.\n\nKEITH COX As a viewer, yes! I have 1 percent left on my DVR.\n\nCHARLIE COLLIER I'll just keep working until John Landgraf calls and tells me it's OK to go home.\n\nIs there any actor or actress left whom you think couldn't be convinced to do TV today? If so, whom?\n\nLEVY Helen Mirren should come on Ink Master and get a tattoo on us! Come on, Dame Mirren — we love you!\n\nKLEIN The ones who aren't should take a second look. Jennifer Aniston, we're looking at you.\n\nLINN I wish we could convince Chris Rock to come and do something for us.\n\nHOLLAND I'd like to think we could convince anybody.\n\nSALKE I'd like to challenge someone to get Tom Cruise to star in a TV show. I can have a pitch for him in an hour.\n\nCOX Please — everyone has a price.\n\nThe retreat from scripted TV will begin when …\n\nSHARENOW My unsold sitcom-pilot script from 1999 gets picked up for a full series order. It will also be a sign of the coming apocalypse.\n\nLANDGRAF 2018 or 2019 at the latest, and I don't think it'll be huge. Some have already started to retreat, but the streaming services have so many more shows that they're going to be premiering — particularly Netflix, which is making more shows than any brand ever has in the history of TV by a wide, wide margin — that that will overwhelm any businesses that are retreating from it.\n\nLEVY Financially it stops making sense.\n\nALBRECHT The locusts return.\n\nPRICE We all wear augmented-reality spectacles all day.\n\nROSS More international networks program local production, which will stress the U.S. production model.\n\nCOLLIER President Trump appoints Kim Kardashian FCC chairman, and she commands that it be so.\n\nThe industry keeps betting on recognizable IP despite a consistent string of high-profile failures. How long will the trend continue?\n\nLANDGRAF Forever.\n\nCHERNISS Until the only remaining IP is Manimal.\n\nDUNGEY For a while because it's so much harder in this Peak TV landscape to get people to even show up and pay attention.\n\nMONROE Until a force stronger than familiarity prevails, and I don't see that happening.\n\nLINN I don't think much longer. People are getting tired of it. Ghostbusters is a great example of it: It didn't feel like a reinvention; it felt like a rehash of something that had its moment."
