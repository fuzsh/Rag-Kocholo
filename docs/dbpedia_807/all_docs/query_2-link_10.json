The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. via Webex, Hon. Bennie G. Thompson (Chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Thompson, Jackson Lee, Langevin, Payne, Correa, Slotkin, Green, Clarke, Swalwell, Titus, Watson Coleman, Rice, Demings, Barragan, Gottheimer, Luria, Malinowski, Torres, Katko, McCaul, Higgins, Bishop, Van Drew, Norman, Miller-Meeks, Harshbarger, Clyde, Gimenez, LaTurner, Meijer, Cammack, Pfluger, Garbarino. Chairman Thompson. The Committee on Homeland Security will come to order. The committee is meeting today to receive testimony on examining the domestic terrorism threat in the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the committee in recess at any point. Today the committee is meeting to examine the threat of domestic terrorism in the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6. I would like to start by thanking the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police, National Guard, Secret Service, Metropolitan Police Department, and all other law enforcement agencies that worked to keep us safe that day and in the days since. I also want to take a moment to remember Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life in the line of duty, and other members of law enforcement who responded to the attack who have tragically passed away. Several others tragically lost their lives during the domestic terrorism attack on our Nation, incited by the former President and his enablers seeking to overturn the results of a legitimate election. As Members of this committee are keenly aware, this act of terrorism was not an isolated incident. During the 116th Congress, the committee held 11 hearings that looked at various domestic terrorism threats. Over a year ago, FBI Director Wray sat before us and warned that domestic terrorism cases were at an all-time high, with racially-motivated violent extremists posing the greatest threat. Then, in July 2020, we received testimony from domestic terrorism expert J.J. MacNab that cautioned, and I quote, ``that the upcoming election will spark one or more violent events if the President loses his reelection bid. ``[His supporters] want him to continue, and they have talked about civil war now for years if he does not.'' Last September, Director Wray testified again before us, saying that racially-motivated violent extremists make up the largest portion of domestic terrorist cases that his agents are investigating. Then, in October, just 4 months before the attack on the Capitol, the Department of Homeland Security's threat assessment identified racially-motivated violent extremists, specifically White Supremacist extremists, as ``the most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland.'' Today, we will begin to shed light on why these warnings were not heeded. The irrefutable fact is that the threat of right-wing, and, more specifically, White Nationalist terrorism, has been growing for years. The previous administration failed to address this threat appropriately, and on January 6 we saw the result right here at the U.S. Capitol. I witnessed the event unfold first-hand from my view in the House Gallery, where we had gathered to observe the counting of the electoral votes as required by the Constitution. I am hopeful that the Biden administration will work to do a better job of confronting this threat, which has been allowed to fester and even encouraged in recent years. Already DHS has taken action as the Department issued a rare warning last week about the heightened threat from domestic terrorism. I look forward to engaging newly-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on this critical issue. President Biden also tasked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, DHS, and FBI, who are conducting a comprehensive assessment of the threat. I commend this swift action. I also urge the administration to prioritize the report on domestic terrorism required by the Domestic and International Terrorism DATA Act, which is now 7 months past due. As Members of the Homeland Security Committee, we, too, have our work cut out for us in this Congress. This committee held 11 hearings last Congress on the threat of domestic terrorism, but clearly much more remains to be done. During a time in which ``both sides-ism'' runs rampant through our politics, I implore Members of this committee to follow the threats wherever they may lead. Any denial or attempt to distract from the threat at hand won't help us address the problem that many have been and continue to sound the alarm about. The conversations will be difficult, and they should be. This threat has long plagued and preyed on the most vulnerable in our society. But we must work together to find solutions. Our democracy and American lives are at stake. Today, we have a panel of experts that will outline the domestic terror threat as it stands, identify what was missed prior to January 6, and present what we ought to do moving forward. I look forward to their testimony and their responses to our questions so we can find a path to keep us all safe. [The statement of Chairman Thompson follows:] Statement of Chairman Bennie G.

I look forward to their testimony and their responses to our questions so we can find a path to keep us all safe. Chairman Thompson. With that, I recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Katko, for an opening statement. Mr. Katko. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your comments. I appreciate being here with all of you today, and welcome to the witnesses. I am honored to serve with all of you and with all of our colleagues in the 117th Congress and recognize how timely and necessary today's hearing is. This year will mark the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the very tragedy that necessitated the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and this committee. In the days and months following the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil, Americans of all views came together to unify against the threat of foreign terrorists. Like so many challenges in our Nation's history, we emerged stronger than ever. To confront the emerging threats to our homeland today, we can't play politics with National security. That is why, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your partnership as we have set out to ensure that this committee remains above the fray and focused on solving problems. Today, we sit here just shy of 20 years after 9/11 to examine the increasingly prevalent and troubling threat from violent extremists, not from some distant land but from here at home. The threat posed by domestic violent extremists may be new to many of us, but it is not new for our country. In the 1960's and 1970's, left-wing extremists known as the Weather Underground carried out dozens of bombings, including one right here inside the U.S. Capitol. In fact, in an 18-month period between 1971 and 1972, extremist groups conducted over 2,500 bombings here in the United States. Three decades later, an anti-Government extremist planned and carried out the deadliest home-grown attack in United States history, killing 168 people with a truck bomb at a Federal building in Oklahoma City. The sad reality is that there will always be those who use ideology and politics as an excuse to commit violence. It is our responsibility to see to it that they are not successful. Over the past 12 months we have seen a marked increase in the activity of domestic violent extremists. In July, amid Nation-wide protests, extremists in Portland set fire to police stations and attacked a Federal courthouse. In December, a man in Nashville detonated a bomb planted in a recreational vehicle, killing himself, injuring 8 others, and disabling a critical telecommunications facility. Just last month right-wing extremists attacked the United States Capitol. Five people died on that dark day, including a Capitol police officer who was laid to rest this week. Just like 9/11, we will never forget. We will never forget the assault on the heart of our democracy on January 6. It was a very difficult thing to watch unfold. While our Nation's law enforcement and National security agencies are better prepared to combat emerging threats like domestic extremism than in previous years, much more needs to be done to bolster information sharing among Federal, State, and local partners. While investigations are on-going, I am concerned that our counterterrorism efforts continue to be hindered by bureaucratic silos, a failure to share the necessary intelligence, and then to act on that intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security is central to our Nation's effort to protect against terrorist and extremist violence here at home, and it is imperative that we ensure it is well-equipped for that mission. It is also our job here at the Committee on Homeland Security to better understand what motivates these extremists and ultimately how to stop them. Radicalization of all sorts that leads to any violence should be unacceptable across the board. With that in mind, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to rise above partisan politics and work together to examine these issues and find solutions. We must do the job our constituents sent us here to do by being honest about the challenges facing our country from violent extremism, even when it may not be politically expedient to do so. It is our solemn responsibility, especially on this committee, to be sober- minded in our efforts to secure our homeland. That is why I co-sponsored legislation championed by Ranking Member Davis on the House Administration Committee to establish a National commission on the domestic terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol. Similar to the 9/11 Commission which helped create the homeland security enterprise we have today, this important bipartisan commission would provide Congress with real answers to our questions and solutions to close critical homeland security gaps. This legislation, referred to our committee, has the support of every Republican Member of the committee, and I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us and move this bill through Congress. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

This legislation, referred solely to our committee, has the support of a dozen Republican Members of the committee, and I urge my Majority colleagues to join us and move this bill through Congress. Chairman Thompson. Other Members of the committee are reminded that under the committee rules opening statements may be submitted for the record. Members are also reminded that the committee will operate according to the guidelines laid out by the Chairman and Ranking Member in our February 3 colloquy regarding remote proceedings. I welcome our witnesses. Our first witness is Dr. Christopher Rodriguez, the director of Washington, DC's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency. Dr. Rodriguez is responsible for emergency planning, preparedness, response, and recovery for the city, including operations at a 24-hour emergency operations center in the District's intelligence fusion center. Our second witness is Ms. Elizabeth Neumann, the former assistant secretary of counterterrorism and threat prevention at the Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Neumann has over 2 decades of experience developing and implementing homeland security and National security policies and strategies for multiple Federal agencies. Our third witness is Mr. Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and national director of ADL. Mr. Greenblatt brings extensive experience from the private sector and Government. Under Mr. Greenblatt, ADL has worked in new and innovative ways to counter and combat extremism in all forms. Our fourth and final witness is Mr. Brian Michael Jenkins, senior advisor to the RAND president. A former military officer, Mr. Jenkins is the author of numerous books, reports, and articles on domestic and international terrorism. Without objection, the witnesses' full statements will be inserted in the record. I now ask Dr. Rodriguez to summarize his statement for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER RODRIGUEZ, PH.D., DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member Katko, Members of the committee. I am Dr. Christopher Rodriguez, director of the District of Columbia's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, which I have led since 2017. Prior to this role, I was a counterterrorism analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency for over 10 years. As an appointee of Mayor Muriel Bowser, I am honored to lead an agency that is responsible for Washington, DC's preparedness, coordination, management, and recovery from all hazards, from a snowstorm to a hurricane to a global pandemic, and of course to a terrorist attack such as the one we saw on January 6. I appear today to discuss the January 6 attack that led to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which based upon my experience was clearly an act of domestic terrorism. This attack exposed in the starkest terms the threat we face from domestic terrorists and from right-wing extremism specifically. Now, at various times throughout our history we have witnessed virulent strains of political ideologies and violent political ideologies that run through the American bloodstream. But time and again these radical movements have been rooted out or minimized in our system. Well, what should concern us now, in 2021, is that the current manifestation of these movements is so insidious, because while in the past they existed on the fringes of society, they are becoming rapidly part of the cultural mainstream. These movements are fueled and fed by misinformation and lies that, if not addressed, will only continue to exacerbate our underlying social divisions and threatening to tear at the delicate fabric of our democratic culture. Now, as we manage and coordinate public safety agencies to respond to various nefarious acts, the District of Columbia is reimagining safety and security in the face of the evolving threat of domestic terrorism. I want to speak very briefly about the 5 elements of our strategy. First, we must regain the narrative. A byproduct of radical violent movements entering the mainstream is that they distort real and meaningful debate. Right-wing extremism and left-wing extremism are not mainstream viewpoints. QAnon, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, anarchists, and Antifa do not espouse mainstream perspectives, nor should they be treated and validated as such. While the District of Columbia hosts hundreds of First Amendment events per year and respects the rights of all Americans to exercise this Constitutional guarantee, even when we disagree with those viewpoints, we will not tolerate violence in our city and we will call such acts what they are in accordance with the law--crimes and terrorism. In a similar vein, we also know, and we have experienced this here in the District, that our foreign adversaries, Russia in particular, are employing decades-old tools of covert action to fan the flames of cultural conflict here in the United States, and our foreign enemies do this by creating or perpetuating false narratives that strike at the heart of democracy itself--that our elections are rigged, that our system is inherently corrupt and should be overthrown, and that radical voices who call for violence or insurrection have legitimate views that should be heard. In regaining the narrative, we need to call these actions what they are--a direct assault on our system of government. Second, we must demonstrate an overt security presence in the District of Columbia, at least for now. The District of Columbia, at Mayor Bowser's direction, has requested that 500 D.C. National Guard personnel remain on standby as a Quick Reaction Force through March 12. We believe that this posture is essential to ensuring that the Metropolitan Police Department can deploy resources to all parts of the city during an emergency. We also believe that we can achieve security in our city-- and specifically on Capitol Hill--without making permanent the current razor wire-topped fencing and armed troops surrounding the Capitol. As the host of our Federal Government, the District government plays an important role in the Capitol's long-term security posture. Mayor Bowser has already suggested one commonsense proposal, and that is to transfer control of the D.C. National Guard to the Mayor of the District of Columbia, which would allow her swifter operational decisions during an evolving incident. As we saw on January 6, under Federal control the guard is not as nimble and responsive as it could be. Third, we must leverage our National intelligence network better. At its core, the value of intelligence is early warning. It gives policy makers, such as yourselves, the decision-making advantage in a world full of strategic threats. We need to utilize a key tool developed after 9/11 in a more systematic way, and that is the State fusion centers. Funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, these intelligence hubs need to do better at sharing information across the network, because the domestic terrorist threat is fundamentally one that originates locally and then spreads across State borders. The nearly 80 fusion centers that exist across the Nation have more than 2,000 intelligence analysts that are funded by Federal dollars, but their intelligence should be more widely disseminated to those who need it. In the District of Columbia, we seek to build out our fusion centers' analytic capabilities in both the physical and virtual realms, particularly to assist local and Federal law enforcement. In the coming months, the fusion center will begin to deploy personnel to key Federal agencies, but we need more funding and more resources from DHS for this program. Fourth, we must engage our communities and work forces better. A particularly troublesome finding in the early investigations of those who participated in the January 6 insurrection is that a small but disproportionately impactful segment of the mob used military tactics to organize and manage the successful advance into and throughout the Capitol. FBI investigations that have been made public have reported that some of these individuals had U.S. military backgrounds and participated in military-style training camps prior to traveling here to Washington, DC. All this said, surely there are people in our communities that might know such activities are taking place, either in plain sight, in the dark corners of the internet, or in casual conversations. We need to prioritize insider threat programs in the U.S. military and law enforcement to ensure that their specific skill sets, which are developed to defend the Nation, State, and community, are not then turned on the very people they are sworn to protect. Finally, we must be prepared for a long fight. Many of the initiatives discussed here will require new law enforcement and legal tools. However, the key element of our success will be ours, yours and mine, as well as the American people's willingness to persist in the fight. The mental and psychological toll of what happened on January 6, as all of you and your staffs and our police officers can personally attest, can be overwhelming. Tragically, some of our finest have already taken their lives following the insurrection. Our best chance for success, though, is to be straight with the American people that the threats we now face are arguably as dangerous as they were in the post-9/11 environment and these threats are not going away. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rodriguez follows:] Prepared Statement of Christopher Rodriguez February 4, 2021 Thank you, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and Members of the committee. I am Dr. Christopher Rodriguez, and I have served as the director of the District of Columbia's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency--or HSEMA--since 2017; the agency hosts Washington, DC's intelligence fusion center, which leads counterterrorism analysis and preparedness for the city. Prior to this role, I was a counterterrorism analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 10 years. As an appointee of Mayor Muriel Bowser, I am honored to lead an agency that is responsible for Washington, DC's preparedness, coordination, management, and recovery from all hazards--everything from a snowstorm to a hurricane to a global pandemic, including the attack at the U.S. Capitol. Like FEMA, HSEMA sits at the crossroads of the District government's interagency operations, and the HSEMA team works tirelessly to ensure unity of effort before, during, and after emergencies. I appear today to discuss the January 6 attack leading to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which, based upon my experience, was an act of domestic terrorism. This attack exposed, in the starkest terms, the threat we face from domestic terrorists generally, but also from right-wing extremism specifically. At various times throughout our history, we have witnessed virulent strains of political ideologies running through the American bloodstream. But, time and again, these radical, violent movements have been rooted out or minimized by a combination of medicines unique to the American experience: The central role of democratic institutions, the rule of law, and the unshakeable resolve of men and women of goodwill seeking to build a better Nation. What should concern us now, in 2021, is that the current manifestation of these movements is so insidious because while, in the past, they existed on the fringes of society, they are becoming part of the cultural mainstream. These movements are fueled and fed by misinformation and lies that, if not addressed, will only continue to exacerbate underlying social divisions, threatening to tear the delicate fabric of our democratic culture. The gains our adversaries have made must be stemmed and reversed. As we manage and coordinate public safety agencies to respond to various nefarious acts, the District must reimagine safety and security in the face of the evolving threat of domestic terrorism. There are 5 elements of our strategy. First, we must regain the narrative.--A byproduct of radical, violent movements entering the mainstream is that they distort real, meaningful debates. ``Right-wing extremism'' and ``left-wing extremism'' are not mainstream viewpoints. QAnon, Proud Boys, OathKeepers, anarchists, and Antifa do not espouse mainstream perspectives, nor should they be treated and validated as such. While the District of Columbia hosts hundreds of First Amendment events per year and respects the rights of all Americans to exercise this Constitutional guarantee--even when we disagree with those viewpoints--we will not tolerate violence in our city, and we will call such acts what they are in accordance with the law: Crimes or terrorism. In a similar vein, we know that our foreign adversaries-- Russia, in particular--are employing a decades-old tool of covert action to fan the flames of cultural conflict here in the United States. Our foreign enemies do this by either creating or perpetuating false narratives that strike at the heart of democracy itself: That our elections are rigged; that our system is inherently corrupt and should be overthrown; that radical voices who call for violence or insurrection have legitimate views that should be heard. In regaining the narrative, we need to call these actions what they are: A direct assault on our system of government and to call those who lend credence to these views as succumbing to foreign influence. Second, we must demonstrate an overt security presence in DC, at least for now.--The District of Columbia, at Mayor Bowser's direction, has requested 500 D.C. National Guard personnel remain on standby as a Quick Reaction Force through March 12. This posture is essential to ensuring the Metropolitan Police Department can deploy resources to all parts of the city during an emergency. However, we believe we can achieve security in our city, and specifically on Capitol Hill, without making permanent the current razor wire-topped fencing and armed troops surrounding the Capitol. The ``people's house'' must remain exactly that and not be turned into an armed fortress, closed off from the rest of our city. As the host of our Federal Government, the District government plays an important role in the Capitol's long-term security posture. Mayor Bowser has already suggested one common-sense proposal: The transfer of control of the D.C. National Guard to the Mayor of the District of Columbia, which would allow for swifter operational decisions during an evolving incident. As we saw on January 6, under Federal control, the Guard is not as nimble and responsive as it could be. Third, we must leverage our National intelligence network better.--At its core, the value of intelligence is early warning; it gives policy makers decision-making advantage in a world full of strategic threats. We need to utilize a key tool developed after 9/11 in a more systematic way: The State fusion centers. Funded by the Department of Homeland Security, these intelligence hubs need to do better at sharing information across the network because the domestic terrorist threat is fundamentally one that originates locally and then spreads across State borders. The nearly 80 fusion centers across the Nation have more than 2,000 intelligence analysts funded by Federal dollars, but their intelligence should be more widely disseminated to those who need it. In the District of Columbia, we seek to build out our fusion center's analytic capabilities in both the physical and virtual realms, particularly to assist local and Federal law enforcement. In the coming months, the fusion center will begin to deploy personnel to key Federal agencies, but we need more funding and resources from DHS for this program. Fourth, we must engage communities and workforces better.--A particularly troublesome finding in the early investigations of those who participated in the January 6 insurrection is that a small, but disproportionately impactful, segment of the mob used military tactics to organize and manage the successful advance into and throughout the Capitol. FBI investigations have reported that some of these individuals had U.S. military backgrounds, held ``leadership only'' planning calls, and participated in military-style training camps prior to traveling to Washington, DC. Recently discovered evidence that some of the attackers were carrying hand ties conjure up foiled plots last year to kidnap the Governors of Michigan and Virginia. All this said, surely people in our communities might know such activities are taking place, either in plain sight, in dark corners of the internet, or in casual conversation. We need to prioritize insider-threat programs in the U.S. military and law enforcement to ensure these specific skill sets, which are developed to defend a nation, a State, or a community, are not then turned on the very people they are sworn to protect. Finally, we must be prepared for a long fight.--Many of the initiatives discussed here will require new law enforcement and legal tools, such as a domestic terrorism statute. However, the key element of our success will be our--yours and mine--as well as the American people's, willingness to persist in this fight. The mental and psychological toll of what happened on January 6, as some of you, your staffs, and our police officers can personally attest, can be overwhelming--and tragically, some of our finest have already taken their lives following the insurrection. Our best chance for success is to be straight with the American people--that the threats we now face are arguably as dangerous as they were in the immediate post-9/11 environment, and these threats are not going away. We will be tested; we will be challenged. But in the end, as we have throughout our history, we will prevail--and those who seek to divide us will never be as strong as a people united in a common purpose, for good. Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions. Chairman Thompson. I now ask Ms. Neumann to summarize her statement for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH NEUMANN, FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEU SUMMIT STRATEGIES AND FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR COUNTERTERRORISM AND THREAT PREVENTION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Ms. Neumann. Good morning, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, distinguished Members of the committee. Thank you for holding today's hearing. I offer my deepest condolences to Officer Sicknick's family, all of the police officers that were injured, and to you, Members of Congress, and your staff. While the attack on January 6 was an assault on our democracy and, therefore, on all Americans, it was an extremely personal experience for each of you. I thank you for your willingness to serve the American people during this dark time, even in the face of threats of violence. I have spent my career immersed in homeland security- related Government reforms needed to address emerging threats and Government failures. The security failure of January 6 was not an intelligence failure. Many had warned about the threat of violence. It was, rather, a failure of poor judgment and insufficient preparation. It was also an act of domestic terrorism. As I explain in my written testimony, the statutory definition is clearly met by the crimes that occurred and the intent of the individuals that stormed the Capitol. Bipartisan agreement upon this designation is paramount to ensuring future security efforts. We must be clear with our words on this matter and stand unified against rhetoric that incites violence to achieve political goals. In my written testimony I lay out 5 recommendations. For brevity, let me highlight 3 here. I believe we need to establish an independent, bipartisan commission to explore the best ways to update our laws, policies, and culture to address domestic terrorism. I believe we need to criminalize domestic terrorism and consider updating other statutes to ensure equal justice is applied. I believe we need to formally codify the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention to send a strong signal to the community that we are investing in prevention. Since I last appeared before one of the subcommittees of this body, I believe the environment in which we approach domestic terrorism has become exponentially more complicated. A few highlights. First, the global COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation and other stress factors known to increase radicalization. These stressors exposed cracks and amplified grievances held by vulnerable individuals, which led to increased radicalization and some mobilization to violence. As a side note, the term ``vulnerable individuals'' is explained more thoroughly in my written testimony and there is a graphic at the end of my testimony which you can refer to which outlines these terms. It shows a simplistic framework for the different stages of how an individual radicalizes and mobilizes to violence. This graphic came out of a RAND study that was done for DHS in 2018. Second, the underlying causes behind the January 6 attack also increased the number of vulnerable individuals. So recruitment is easier now for extremist groups than it ever has been before. Extremist ideas have been mainstreamed and normalized through political speech, conspiracy theories, and communications that use humor and memes to mask the danger of those ideas present. Consequently, there is a high likelihood of violence in the coming months on a range of softer targets associated with their perception of the ``Deep State,'' including infrastructure, mainstream media, law enforcement, ``Big Tech,'' and elected officials. There are many other complicating factors I can't go through at this moment. But, sadly, I do believe that we will be fighting domestic terrorism that has its roots and inspiration points from January 6 for the next 10 to 20 years. For this reason I believe it is paramount that we establish a shared understanding of this threat and a bipartisan commitment to address it so that discussions about domestic terrorism itself can't be manipulated or misreported, further feeding the grievance cycle into radicalization and mobilization to violence. So let me return to where I started. I urge the Congress to consider establishing a domestic terrorism commission. I urge that at a minimum we change our laws to ensure equal justice, treating threats from ideologies that originated overseas and within the United States the same. These are very complicated and thorny issues, which is why I believe we need a commission to address them appropriately. Last, I want to urge you to scale the prevention work we began together in the 116th Congress. Thank you for your support during my tenure at DHS and thereafter. Your bipartisan work on expanding prevention capabilities in the United States has prepared us for this moment, but there is still much work that needs to be done. You led a 1,200 percent increase in funding for prevention over the last 2 fiscal years. In Federal budget terms that is almost unheard of. I would ask you to please consider accelerating these prevention efforts. In particular, I urge you to authorize the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention and help it scale rapidly through additional resources to be able to assist our State and local partners with developing the prevention capabilities we need in our communities to better assist individuals before they mobilize to violence. In closing, we need to recognize that the root causes of this new face of terrorism are not things that the security community can fix. President Obama called it ``an epistemological crisis.'' He said, ``If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what is true from what is false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas does not work and by definition our democracy does not work.'' Today's hearing is an opportunity for each of us to demonstrate democracy does still work. We can disagree without becoming disagreeable. I believe there is much upon which we can agree. Confronting this threat will require calling on other parts of our society to defeat domestic terrorism. The challenge ahead requires rediscovering we are Americans before we are a party affiliation or a political philosophy. It requires rebuilding civic society at a local level, choosing respectful civil discourse over cancel culture, and rejecting political ideologies or identity politics that focus on grouping ``them'' into an ``enemy'' of the ``tribe.'' We will begin here today, but each of us has a role as we lead in our homes and in our local communities, because the greatest disruption to the grievance cycle that leads to violence begins by loving our neighbor as we would like to be loved ourselves. Thank you so much. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Neumann follows:] Prepared Statement of Elizabeth Neumann February 4, 2021 introduction Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and distinguished Members of the committee, thank you for holding today's hearing ``Examining the Domestic Terrorism Threat in the Wake of the Attack on the U.S. Capitol.'' Before addressing the hearing topic, I want to thank this committee for their support in the last Congress, during my tenure at DHS and thereafter, for working on a bi-partisan basis to support the expansion of prevention capabilities across the country. Many of the Members of the last session of Congress continue on this committee today--and because of their willingness to work with us--we were able to increase DHS funding for prevention efforts by over 1,200 percent in 2 fiscal years. That is unheard of in Federal budgeting. Thank you. While my remarks today will not go into the details of prevention--I wanted to note for the record that I believe the plan we laid out in 2019 in the Strategic Framework for Countering Terrorism and Targeted Violence, and what we began implementing, are a critical part of the set of solutions needed to address domestic terrorism. the january 6, 2021 attack on the capitol was domestic terrorism I have spent my career immersed in homeland security-related Government reforms--stemming from Government failures, like the attacks of September 11, 2001, or the Hurricane Katrina response, as well as emerging threats. The security failure of January 6, 2021 is nearly incomprehensible for me. I believe the failure was not one of intelligence, but a failure of imagination born of a lack of judgment and preparation. I believe the investigation should be thorough and must make recommendations that ensure we never see such a security failure again. While we can debate the merits of whether to call those that stormed the Capitol ``terrorists,'' the attack on January 6 meets the definition of domestic terrorism as laid out in U.S. Code at 18 U.S.C. 2331(5):\\1\\ ``Involving acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; Appearing to be intended to: (1) Intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (2) Influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion; or (3) Affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (4) Occurring primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/fbi-dhs-domestic-terrorism- definitions-terminology-methodology.pdf/view. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A police officer was killed and 140 officers were injured-- thus it was ``dangerous to human life''; We see from the indictments that there are multiple ``violations of criminal laws''; Based on video testimonials prior to, during, and after the attack--the motivation for many was to interrupt a Constitutionally-mandated activity and ``intimidate or coerce'' the U.S. Congress to change the outcome of the election of our President; and There is evidence, though we should wait for the investigations to conclude, that some of the attackers had prepared for assassinating, or taking hostage, Members of Congress and the Vice President. The attacks may also meet other criminal statutory definitions, such as seditious conspiracy and treason, but we will leave that to the investigators and prosecutors to determine. framing the radicalization to extremism and mobilization to violence process While the radicalization process is not necessarily linear, I find it helps to use a linear framework to identify the different places individuals might be on the pathway to violence. During my time at DHS, we asked the RAND Corporation to help us identify where to head with our prevention efforts. A graphic they produced in the resulting study lays out the different stages of radicalization. I have included the graphic as Appendix A to this testimony for the Committee's reference. As the RAND Study on Practical Terrorism Prevention \\2\\ explains, they used a ``basic model to anchor their work,'' which divides ``people involved in radicalization processes into 3 relevant populations: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Jackson, Brian A., Ashley L. Rhoades, Jordan R. Reimer, Natasha Lander, Katherine Costello, and Sina Beaghley, Practical Terrorism Prevention: Reexamining U.S. National Approaches to Addressing the Threat of Ideologically Motivated Violence. Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center operated by the RAND Corporation, 2019. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2647.html. Also available in print form. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Vulnerable population--i.e., all the people who might radicalize to violence Individuals who are radical of thought but may or may not become violent Individuals actually involved in attempted attacks (planning or actual carrying out of attacks).''\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Ibid., xix. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- RAND explained that ``each successive population is much smaller than the population preceding it, with only a small percentage of any vulnerable population radicalizing and only a percentage of that population escalating to violence.''\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Traditional counterterrorism efforts have focused on the third category--criminal activity that requires a law enforcement response to disrupt, investigate, and prosecute. The first 2 categories of individuals concern government and the people because of their potential for moving to violence. Since they have not moved into criminal conduct, the Government's activities toward these individuals need to be framed differently than those in the third category. RAND also noted that, ``the model is not specific to any given ideology or population.''\\5\\ This latter point is notable. Yes, we need to understand the ideologies of violent White Supremacists and anti- Government extremists. In part because they may help us understand where the next attack may occur or the method they may use, and it may help law enforcement better detect associations with or activities of a particular extremist group. But many extremism experts note that the motivation to join terrorist movements tend to be less about the ideology and more about filling unmet needs caused by trauma, exposure to violence, a sense of marginalization, grievance, or humiliation.\\6\\ This means, arguing with a White Supremacist about why their ideology is wrong and disgusting, is not an effective de-mobilization or de- radicalization technique. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Ibid. \\6\\ This is the assessment of many that research extremism. For example, see: Miller-Idriss, Cynthia. Hate in the Homeland: The New Global Far Right (pp. 3). (2020). Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press. Picciolini, Christian. Breaking Hate: Confronting the New Culture of Extremism (pp. xxi-xxiii). (2020). New York, NY: Hachette Books. An interview with Jessica Stern: http://www.bu.edu/articles/ 2021/jessica-stern-on-why-january-6-attack-on-capitol-was-act-of- terroris m/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- participants in the january 6 attack represent a different kind of extremism It was clear even as the attack unfurled, that several organized violent extremist groups were present, including Neo-Nazis, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters. There were also less organized Groypers and QAnon adherents, along with unaffiliated individuals there to support Trump. The investigations are still underway and while there are some signs of coordination among some organized extremist groups, a study released this week from the University of Chicago found startling distinctions between those who have been indicted thus far for actions on January 6 and ``traditional'' domestic extremists.\\7\\ The indicted January 6 attackers have significantly less ties to organized extremist groups; about 10 percent of those arrested had ties compared to almost 50 percent of domestic extremists in the 2015-2020 period. January 6 attackers were also, on average, older and 40 percent owned businesses or held white-collar jobs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/the-capitol- rioters-arent-like-other-extremists/617895/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As we examine the current state of the threat and discuss what to do, we need to keep in mind that the threat that manifested on January 6 was likely aided by organized extremist movements, but it appears that a large majority that participated in criminal acts were unaffiliated with an organized group and primarily motivated by grievances created and amplified by the former President. the challenges of addressing domestic terrorism When I appeared at my last hearing a year ago this month, the challenges I highlighted related to scaling up DHS's prevention and protection capabilities to address the threat of domestic terrorism. We were concerned about a growth in violent White Supremacist and anti- Government extremist groups and what we often call the ``quick- radicalization'' problem--the speed at which an individual can be exposed to extremist content and mobilize to violence. And the Government was challenged by lack of good prevalence data. While those challenges remain, I believe the environment in which we approach domestic terrorism has become more exponentially more complicated. 1. The global COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation and other stress factors known to increase radicalization. Last March, while at DHS, I asked my team to research how pandemic mitigation efforts might exacerbate violent extremism. For decades, the Secret Service, the FBI, and academic researchers have examined the backgrounds and pre-attack behaviors of mass-attack perpetrators. Some of the risk factors of violent extremism they identified are increasing Nation-wide: Social isolation, financial stress, job loss, loss of loved ones, and significant changes or uncertainty in life. My team assessed that some groups would perceive public health measures as Government overreach infringing on rights and liberties, which might encourage anti-Government extremists. And we had already observed foreign actors and domestic violent extremists spreading disinformation about the pandemic to foment discord and encourage violence.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Note: This paragraph originally appeared in my opinion piece published in the Washington Post on October 16, 2020. https:// www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/16/threats-against-democratic- governors-prove-trumps-rhetoric-encourages-violence/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- While we were frustrated that our warnings and recommendations for building resilience were not heeded by the previous administration's COVID-19 Taskforce, they were included in the recently-released 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment, which concluded: ``Domestic Violent Extremists [present] the most persistent and lethal threat . . . Violent extremists will continue to target individuals or institutions that represent symbols of their grievances, as well as grievances based on political affiliation or perceived policy positions . . . The domestic situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic creates an environment that could accelerate some individuals' mobilization to targeted violence or radicalization to terrorism.'' Three examples of this challenge: In the first months of the pandemic, Moonshot CVE studied the impact of mitigation measures on engagement with violent extremist content on-line. They found a 21 percent average increase in engagement with White Supremacist content on-line in States with local ``stay at home'' directives in place for 10 or more days, compared to a 1 percent average increase in engagement in States with local ``stay at home'' directives in place for less than 10 days.\\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ https://moonshotcve.com/social-distancing-white-supremacy/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The rapid rise, even quasi-mainstreaming, of QAnon conspiracy theories during the pandemic.\\10\\ While the conspiracies alone are not domestic terrorism--there are individuals who have attempted acts of terrorism in response to their conspiratorial beliefs--including the intentional derailing of a freight train near the hospital ship Mercy in Los Angeles and QAnon supporters that traveled to Philadelphia during the city's ballot counting operations who were arrested with an AR-15 rifle and 160 rounds of ammunition.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/tech/2020/08/31/qanon- conspiracy-theories-trump-election-covid-19-pandemic-extremist-groups/ 5662374002/. \\11\\ https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/15/qanon- violence-crimes-timeline. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The arrests in October of militia group members allegedly training for civil war, plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. 2. The underlying causes behind the January 6 attack has increased the number of ``vulnerable individuals''--likely leading to increases in the other two categories (individuals with radicalized thought but may or may not become violent; and individuals actually intending, planning, or attempting violence). We are often asked about prevalence. How many people in the United States are domestic terrorists? This is a difficult question to answer due to lack of good data and the way in which Government systems categorize data. In her recent book, Hate in the Homeland, Cynthia Miller Idriss offers a ``best estimate--looking across all groups and organizations . . . of 75,000 to 100,000 people affiliated with White Supremacist extremist groups in the United States, not including individuals who engage occasionally from the peripheries of far-right scenes or who are ideologically supportive but engaged either on-line or off-line.''\\12\\ Germany, which has better monitoring of domestic extremists, estimates they have approximately 24,000--what they term, ``right-wing extremists''--and about 50 percent of those are considered potentially violent.\\13\\ If we apply their ratio to our numbers, that would put us at 37,000-50,000 potentially violent White Supremacists within the United States. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Miller-Idriss. Pp 20. \\13\\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because we lack monitoring and data collection capabilities, I caution how these numbers are used, but it certainly gives you a sense of the scope. When the FBI briefed Congress last year, they indicated they had about 1,000 open domestic terrorism investigations--but we may have significantly more potentially violent individuals in just one type of domestic terrorism (White Supremacy). We are outmanned. More chilling, those were estimates prior to the attack on January 6. According to an Economist/YouGov poll completed last week, 78 percent of Trump voters believe the Presidential election was ``stolen''.\\14\\ That's approximately 57 million Americans. The 2020 campaign was framed as an existential battle for the ``soul of the country.'' If one believes the election was ``stolen'' and that the ``other side'' poses an existential threat, one could be vulnerable to arguments that violence is justified. While it might be illegal and immoral, it is not illogical for one to conclude a revolution might be called for if you believe your Government has broken its obligations to you under the Constitution. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ YouGov surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults, including 1,245 registered voters, between January 24 and January 26 for its latest poll. Its overall margin of error stands at 3.4 percentage points. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To be clear, statistically speaking, it would be a relatively small percentage that might move to violence--but even if it is as low as 0.5-1 percent--that's somewhere between 240,000-570,000 people. (For context, imagine how our Nation would react if that was the number of international terrorists living among our citizens.) It is a number that far exceeds any law enforcement or security capability we have within the country. Accordingly, one of our primary goals in these next months needs to be debunking the lies about the stolen election, in order to shrink the number of individuals vulnerable to radicalization to violence. We do not have much time. On-line chatter collected by open-source groups like the SITE Intelligence Group indicates significant elevations of anti-state sentiment from QAnon and Trump supporters, as they feel they've been pushed out of the mainstream. Further, we expect to see a networking effect from January 6-- having physical, in-person encounters during an emotional experience that many consider to be a ``battle'' is likely to form bonds among people that perhaps had never before met or had previously been limited to on-line contact. What we are seeing on-line seems to align with that expectation--intermingling between traditional organized extremist groups and disaffected Trump supporters and QAnon adherents. Certain violent extremist groups like the Neo-Nazi's, are sharing tips on how to recruit disheartened QAnon and Trump supporters. The SITE Intelligence Group assessed one such post as ``notable for the confluence of far-right concepts and slogans, tied together with more mainstream conservative ideas in an effort to make them palatable to a broader audience.''\\15\\ And postings on both Neo-Nazi and Proud Boys channels, offered instructions on how to approach--including guidance to not ``haze'' but be a ``shepherd'' and ``let them know there is an alternative to what the Beast System offered them''.\\16\\ Others were more direct, encouraging Trump supporters to ``Abandon the GOP'' and ``embrace the ultranationalist 3d position'' fascism.\\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ SITE Intelligence Group Bulletin, January 12, 2021. ``We Cannot Vote Our Way Out Of This'': Prominent Neo-Nazi Channel Addresses Trump Supporters.'' https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Far-Right-/-Far- Left-Threat/we-cannot-vote-our-way-out-of-this-prominent-neo-nazi- channel-addresses-trump-supporters.html. \\16\\ SITE Intelligence Group Bulletin, January 23, 2021. ``Prominent Neo-Nazi Venue Urges Trump Supporters to `Abandon GOP' and Embrace `Third Position' Fascism.'' https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Far- Right-/-Far-Left-Threat/prominent-neo-nazi-venue-urges-trump- supporters-to-abandon-gop-and-embrace-third-position-fascism.html. \\17\\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recruitment is easier for extremist groups now than ever before. Dr. Miller-Idriss explains that extremist ideas have been mainstreamed and normalized through ``political speech, conspiracy theories, and . . . communication styles'' that use ``humor and memes . . . [to make] extreme ideas seem less dangerous than they really are.''\\18\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Miller-Idriss. Pp 47. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The expanded pool of vulnerable individuals resulted in some mobilization to violence on January 6. Extremism experts believe we will likely see more. There is a high likelihood of violence in the coming months on a range of softer targets associated with their perception of the ``Deep State'' including infrastructure, mainstream media, law enforcement, ``Big Tech'', and elected officials. But beyond the short-term, I believe we will be fighting domestic terrorism that has its roots or inspiration points in the events leading up to and on January 6 for the next 10-20 years. 3. We lack a shared understanding and unity of commitment to address the threat, and discussions about Domestic Terrorism are being manipulated and disinformation is further feeding the grievance cycle-- which could cause more people to radicalize to violence. There is a growing overlap between extremism and political discourse. Foundations have been laid for years by right-leaning media outlets that ``mainstream media'' is misleading, biased, or presents ``fake news.'' In fact, during the 2016 election cycle and its aftermath, right-leaning media were heartened (and amused) that Trump would ``fight back'' and ``push against'' the ``mainstream media.'' This onslaught created an atmosphere of distrust of the ``mainstream media,'' and sent many into seeking news and information within ``echo chambers'' that provided feedback that substantiated opinions, but not facts. To wit, there has also been significant conflation between news desks and opinion show formats--where the latter presents ``breaking news'' opinion as factual news. Already, certain voices on the right side of the political spectrum have used opinion media platforms to assert that ``the mainstream media'' have declared anyone who attended the rally on January 6 a ``domestic terrorist.'' Next right-leaning opinion commentary declared that ``radical liberals'' consider all 74 million that voted for Trump ``domestic terrorists''.\\19\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/28/tucker- carlson-is-telling-his-viewers-that-democrats-see-them-terrorists/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As an avid news consumer and commentator on this topic, I have not seen an example of a major news organization or ``mainstream media'' opinion commentator declaring everyone on the right a domestic terrorist. Nor, in reviewing the prominent commentators' assertions, have I found right-leaning opinion shows to present actual facts and evidence to back-up those arguments. In other words, I believe they are, based on financial and marketing decisions, purposefully lying to their viewers. But that does not matter in our present moment when passions are inflamed, and those who are told they are being disenfranchised by the ``radical left,'' trust no one but your ``side'' to tell you ``truth.'' Disinformation and lack of action by the Trump administration also created an impression of equivalency between extremist groups that identify with the far right-side of the political spectrum and those that identify with the far-left. In particular, the former President's obsession (fueled by right-leaning media outlets' obsessions) with ANTIFA--a descriptor that stands for Anti-Fascist--led to a redirection of resources away from open domestic terrorism investigations \\20\\ and led many to believe that they are just as dangerous as Neo-Nazis. The statistics do not support this belief. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/us/politics/trump-right- wing-domestic-terrorism.html?searchResultPosition=4. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- While all violence should be treated equally under the law, the Government should portion its resources to those threat actors posing the gravest threats to our National security. The Government will need to repeatedly offer the facts about the number of arrests, attacks, and deaths caused by violent White Supremacists and anti-Government extremists versus those adhering to a far-left ideology. But as with the disinformation challenge noted above, it will be difficult for the Government to communicate facts to an audience that is predisposed to believing the disinformation. I agree with President Obama's assertion that we are facing ``an epistemological crisis.'' ``If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what is true from what is false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas does not work, and by definition our democracy does not work,'' he explained.\\21\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ Goldberg, Jeffrey. ``Why Obama Fears for Our Democracy''. The Atlantic. November 16, 2020. https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/ 2020/11/why-obama-fears-for-our-democracy/617087/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is not law enforcement or the counterterrorism community's responsibility to fix an epistemological crisis. But if our society does not fix it, it will increase the workload of the security community. And in addressing this challenge and the violent threat associated with it, we must be careful to not inadvertently ostracize and anger more people, which could then lead to more radicalization to violence. 4. Some in the counterterrorism, homeland security, and law enforcement communities underestimated the threat. The narratives of ``lone-wolf'' attackers have dominated threat assessments for decades. While mostly true that Oklahoma City, Mother Emannuel Church, Pittsburgh, Christchurch, El Paso, and other attacks were committed by one individual--they were not alone in getting to the point of committing acts of violence. Rather this is the preferred tactic by design of White Supremacist movement. Before we design tactics and strategies and consider changes in law, we need a deeper understanding of the history and intent behind these extremists movements. For example, Kathleen Belew, a historian of the White Power and paramilitary movements in America, explains that in 1983 the White Power movement declared war on the Federal Government.\\22\\ Their goals were to destabilize the Government, wage a revolutionary race war, and establish a White homeland. They also decided to follow a leaderless resistance model and encouraged individual or small group attacks to reduce detection by law enforcement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ Belew, Kathleen. Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America (pp. 104). (2018). Cambridge, MA. Harvard University Press. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During my time in Government, I asked intelligence analysts for assessments on the motivations and strategic aims of violent White Supremacists, I was never briefed about their 1983 declaration of war on the Government, or that some were pursuing the establishment of a ``White homeland.'' I was left with the impression that their primary efforts were to create fear among non-White populations--which of course is horrid--but not as sophisticated an intent as overthrowing the U.S. Government. Calling the attackers ``lone wolves'' left the impression for policy makers and those crafting counterterrorism strategies, there is a randomness to attacks--that you can explain their actions away as individuals that are mentally unwell--and therefore we cannot track the threat the same way we track threats emanating from ISIS or al-Qaeda. But that is inaccurate. I believe January 6 may be a turning point for the law enforcement and counterterrorism community to see the movement behind the individuals. President Biden's task to DNI Haines for a threat assessment was scoped wisely to include data and expertise from outside Government. That's the first step--understand the enemy. what should we do? In closing, some thoughts on where we go from here. I believe as the pandemic ends, hopefully later this year, and people begin to return to some form of normal socializing we are likely to see both a decrease in vulnerability to radicalization--the comforts of our old lives will help ease anxieties, people will spend less time on-line indulging in conspiracy theories; but paradoxically, the increase in mass gatherings will provide the targets that violent extremists are waiting for. Therefore, we must be prepared for these attacks. 1. Define the Threat and Educate the American People About the Threat The DNI-coordinated threat assessment will provide a baseline from which the Government can begin to educate the American public about domestic terrorism. Information will help inoculate some that might be in the ``vulnerable'' category on the radicalization spectrum. It will also help bystanders better understand what to look for if a loved one or colleague demonstrates a change of behavior that might be indicative of radicalization to violence. DHS, FBI, and State and local law enforcement should recognize that they are not necessarily viewed as credible voices by some Americans, and as such, they should work with voices viewed as credible to educate the public about the intent of extremist groups, the ways they recruit, and that breaking the law will lead to prosecution and legal consequences. In particular, there appears to be significant misinformation about the legality of private militia groups in the United States. A concerted campaign to educate on what is and is not protected by the 2nd Amendment may reduce their numbers. 2. Encourage Potential Targets to Dust-Off Security Plans and Urge Public Vigilance and Bystander Reporting I have confidence that the new leadership at DHS and current leadership at FBI will continue to encourage public vigilance, see something/say something; and encourage owners and operators of infrastructure, especially those hosting public spaces--including faith-based organizations--to review their protective security plans, consider running exercises and update security plans as necessary. The recent National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) Bulletin \\23\\ issued by DHS makes it easier for State and local governments to access overtime funding for security functions, which is helpful in a heightened threat environment. Congress could consider providing additional funds to assist faith-based and non-profit organizations which are often mentioned as potential targets by the White Power movement. Such considerations should also factor in that many COVID-19 and QAnon-related conspiracy theories promote anti-Semetic beliefs and often list specific infrastructure targets such as 5G towers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\23\\ https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/ntas/alerts/ 21_0127_ntas-bulletin.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. DHS should continue expanding locally-based, multi-disciplinary prevention capabilities, and the administration should encourage State and local governments to join the effort. The Congress should codify DHS's Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention to memorialize its support for these prevention efforts. 4. Federal Law Enforcement activity should appropriately demonstrate that any threat or acts of violence is treated the same regardless of the ideological motivation. In particular, the Government needs to explain their rationale for acting, or not acting, on situations often raised by those on the conservative side of the political spectrum pertaining to ``far-left violent extremism.'' The Government should also publicize data on the actual number of acts of violence and arrests associated with the protests last summer to help debunk the disinformation spread about ANTIFA-related attacks. 5. We must explore domestic terrorism-related statutory, policy, and culture changes with diligence, wisdom, and care. I believe equal justice under the law requires treating threats from ideologies that originated overseas and within the United States the same. Of course the way we investigate U.S. citizens and those residing within the United States is different than how we investigate a foreigner overseas. But it makes no sense that the same plans to commit a crime within the United States in the name of ISIS can leverage more investigative tools and stiffer penalties than if it's committed on behalf of a violent White Supremacist ideology. I believe that at a minimum, we should pass a law that makes domestic terrorism a crime, which would allow more flexibility in investigations and stronger sentences. It also may serve as a deterrent effect. I also believe the material support statute should be updated to reflect any new criminal domestic terrorism statute. Finally, I believe we should consider and robustly debate expanding the current foreign terrorist designation capability to domestic terrorism. While this is usually looked at through the lens of the aide it provides FBI and DOJ--I would encourage those studying the pros and cons to examine the assistance a designation process may provide to other parts of the counterterrorism community. Tools such as watchlisting, screening, and vetting would benefit from a designation process. Likewise, private industry can be better informed about whom they should not conduct business and the tech industry has guidance it can rely on for decisions related to content takedown and deplatforming for violations of their terms of service. This also allows for clear communication to the public about such groups and may have a deterrent effect. As we have learned over the years, such efforts can also have unintended consequences and those should be examined. We may find domestic terrorist groups adapt to be even more decentralized or constantly rebranding (as Attomwaffen Division has done). And of course, such changes need to be undertaken in a way to ensure Constitutional rights and liberties are protected. For these reasons, I renew the call I made last year before a subcommittee of this body--for a bi-partisan commission to be established to explore the best ways to update our laws, policies, and cultures within the security community to ensure we address this threat appropriately. We must learn from both the successes and the failures of the past 20 years of counterterrorism. You responded to that call with a proposed commission that nearly made it into law, but was cut from the NDAA at the last minute. The attacks of January 6 demand not only an accounting of how they occurred, but a thorough review of options to better address this complex and rapidly-changing threat. These are difficult issues and they would benefit from deep consideration by a bi-partisan set of legal, security, and civil liberties experts that can dedicate most of their attention to quickly examining options. These debates need to be removed from the political spotlight for reasonable and diligent deliberations to occur. And once the commission reports its findings and proposed solutions, those solutions should be debated by the public through their representatives in Congress. Finally, a year ago, when I testified at a subcommittee of this committee--I stated: ``We need to make it harder to carry out an attack and reduce the potential loss of life, as well as prevent individuals from mobilization to violence in the first place. Achieving those objectives is beyond the Federal Government's capability and role alone.'' At the time, I was referencing the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to prevention. But where we sit now a year later, the threat requires more. We must call on other parts of our society to reflect on their contributions to our current moment. What can the technology community do better? What can educators do to help? How can the faith community better help their followers who chose a dark path? Ultimately, repairing what is broken in our country will not happen inside the institutional halls of Washington, DC. Yes, the security community has a role and the Congress should debate what additional tools and resources to give them to carry out those roles. And yes, those who incited or committed the attacks on January 6 must be held accountable. But that alone will not fix the extremist threat we face. The challenge ahead requires rediscovering we are Americans before we are a party affiliation or a political philosophy. It requires discipline among citizens, and exercising leadership among elected officials and the media, to not give into the monetized grievance cycle of our media and political system. It requires rebuilding civic society at a local level; choosing respectful civil discourse over cancel- culture; and rejecting political ideologies or identity politics that focus on grouping ``them'' into an ``enemy'' of the ``tribe''. Where and how do we start? Locally. By remembering how to love our neighbor. Chairman Thompson. I thank you very much. I now ask Mr. Greenblatt to summarize his statement for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE Mr. Greenblatt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Katko, and all the Members of the committee. It is a pleasure to be here today. My name is Jonathan Greenblatt. I am the CEO of ADL. It is an honor to talk with you about the urgent threat posed by domestic terrorism. As many of you know, ADL is the oldest anti-hate group in the world and one of the longest-standing civil rights organizations in the United States. For more than a century ADL has worked to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and secure justice and fair treatment to all. As part of our work, we have built a world-class team investigating extremist threats, an evil that has intensified and expanded with devastating consequences. Indeed, we should keep in mind extremism is not new. It has evolved and mutated over the decades. In the 1960's what we could describe as left-wing terrorism was a serious threat. But in recent decades, and in particular over the past 5 years, right-wing extremism, and in particular White Supremacy, has experienced a terrifying resurgence. Let me make clear this is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem. It is an American problem. I am heartened to see this committee coming together to tackle it. Why is the threat of right-wing extremism on the rise? I believe there are two forces that are fueling this movement. First, leaders at the highest levels who have repeated their rhetoric, co-opted their conspiracies, and whether intentional or not, given extremists the green light. The second is social media. No longer does a person have to decamp to a clandestine compound in the woods. Today you can find hate 24/7 with just a few clicks on your phone. As we know, on-line hate can explode into real-world violence. We saw this in 2015 at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2018 at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2019 at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. Indeed, White Supremacists are responsible for more murders than any other type of domestic extremists, accounting for nearly 60 percent of all such crimes in the past decade. ADL just released yesterday our annual report on murder and extremism. We found that extremist activity skyrocketed in 2020. Sixteen out of 17 of the deaths were caused by right-wing extremists, and there were more than 5,000 incidents of White Supremacist propaganda in the country last year, almost double the number in 2019. Frighteningly, as we saw on January 6, more and more ordinary people are being radicalized and spurred to acts of terror, weaponized against this very Congress and the Republic itself. For decades, ADL's Center on Extremism has been actively monitoring hate groups of all stripes, and in recent months we have tracked domestic extremists lashing out at elected officials in the wake of last November's election. Indeed, what happened at the U.S. Capitol was the most predictable terror attack in American history. That act of domestic terrorism was a watershed moment for the White Supremacist movement in this country. For them, the sight of Congressmen and -women cowering under tables, Confederate flags and Nazi symbols being paraded through the building, was nothing short of a victory. At ADL, while we were shocked by the violence, we weren't surprised. This insurrection didn't materialize out of thin air and it will not dissipate in its aftermath unless we take action. We believe it is time not just for a whole-of- Government approach, but a whole-of-society strategy to combat White Supremacy and all forms of domestic terrorism. With that in mind, ADL respectfully presents to you today the bipartisan PROTECT framework, a comprehensive 7-part plan to mitigate the threat posed by right-wing extremism and domestic terrorism while staying true to American freedoms and values. The details are in my written testimony and I am happy to talk about it in the Q&A, but the highlights include, No. 1, passing the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act; No. 2, coordinating across all Government agencies--Federal, State, and local--with a clear prioritization of the problem; No. 3, ensuring that extremists cannot serve in the military, in law enforcement, or in elected office; No. 4, holding social media companies accountable for their complicity in facilitating extremism; No. 5, funding creative efforts to prevent people from radicalizing and off-ramping individuals caught up in these conspiracies; and No. 6, targeting foreign White Supremacist terror groups, because make no mistake, this movement is a global threat. Here is what you need to keep in mind and what I think makes our plan different than some of the others. There is no silver bullet to stopping the threat of domestic terrorism. A singular statute won't solve the problem. This is a multi- pronged approach to address a multi-pronged issue. It acknowledges the existing authorities that are already available, even as we innovate with new approaches. Members of the committee, we can accomplish our goals while protecting vulnerable communities. Together these actions should have a significant impact on preventing and countering domestic extremism and protecting the homeland. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Greenblatt follows:] Prepared Statement of Jonathan Greenblatt February 4, 2021 Chair Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, Members of the committee, good morning. I am Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer and national director at the ADL, and it is an honor to appear before you today to address the issue of domestic terrorism and the dire threat that it poses. Since 1913, the mission of ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) has been to ``stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.'' For decades, one of the most important ways in which ADL has fought against bigotry and anti- Semitism has been by investigating extremist threats across the ideological spectrum, including White Supremacists and other violent extremists, producing research to inform the public of the scope of the threat, and working with law enforcement, educators, the tech industry, and elected leaders to promote best practices that can effectively address and counter threats to communities. As ADL has said time and time again, extremists must be taken at their word. Anyone who has been paying attention to extremist activity across the country, or to the chorus of disinformation and hatred rampant across extremist media and some corners of social media, will tell you that what happened at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was in some ways the most predictable outbreak of political violence in American history. For many of the people who were roused to violence that day, their actions were the product of years of incitement, spread with stunning speed, scope, and impact on social media. A portion of these individuals constitute a new breed of extremist, one foundationally animated by devotion to now-former President Trump. They are also living in an entire ecosphere of disinformation, lies, and conspiracy theories, ones fertilized by Alex Jones, QAnon, groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters, the former President, and many others. But the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol last month are by no means our Nation's only concern when it comes to domestic extremism. Without a doubt, violence from White Supremacists and other right-wing extremist actors is currently the greatest domestic extremism threat. From Charleston to Charlottesville to Pittsburgh, to Poway and El Paso, we have seen the deadly consequences of White Supremacist extremism play out all over this country. We cannot afford to minimize this threat. We need a bipartisan ``whole-of-Government approach''--indeed, a ``whole-of-society'' approach--to counter it, and the work must start today. Right now, many policy makers and pundits are looking for a silver bullet--a one-size-fits-all approach that will solve the challenge of domestic terrorism. Unfortunately, we know from our extensive work and analysis in this field that no such panacea exists. That is why ADL is launching the PROTECT plan--a comprehensive, 7-part plan to mitigate the threat of domestic terrorism while protecting civil rights and civil liberties. The key elements of this plan, discussed in more detail below, are appropriately prioritizing and allocating sufficient resources--informational, legal, and financial--to address this extremist threat. Together, they can have an immediate and deeply significant impact in preventing and countering domestic terrorism and the extremism associated with it--more so than any one law--and can accomplish these goals while protecting vulnerable people and communities against the risk of Government overreach. In my testimony today, I will explain and elaborate on this framework and offer concrete steps that Congress can take to begin to confront and reduce the lethal threat of domestic extremism and domestic terrorism. First, however, I will contextualize the events as they unfolded on January 6 and summarize what we know and what the data tells us regarding the rising threat of domestic extremism and domestic terrorism in our Nation today. insurrection at the capitol Overview of Events On January 6, a broad coalition of right-wing extremists descended on Washington, DC and a number of State capitals. Ostensibly gathered to hear President Trump and his family speak and to dispute the results of the 2020 Presidential election, rioters stoked violence against law enforcement officers before storming the U.S. Capitol in an extraordinary display of political violence.\\1\\ By the afternoon, the Capitol was under siege by domestic terrorists who had taken over the building, videoing and photographing themselves in the House chamber, calling for the execution of administration officials and Members of this Congress, violently attacking overwhelmed law enforcement members charged with protecting this body, and trapping Members and staffers throughout the building. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Washington Post staff, ``Woman dies after shooting in U.S. Capitol; D.C. National Guard activated after mob breaches building,'' Washington Post, January 7, 2021. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc- md-va/2021/01/06/dc-protests-trump-rally-live-updates/#link- FLU6WSIEHRHQRJKE6ANICM7ZQQ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the chaos unfolded, President Trump tweeted his support for the insurrectionists: ``These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!'' The tweet was later deleted by Twitter, and the President's account was put on a temporary suspension, which has since been made permanent. Earlier in the day, Metropolitan Police discovered and successfully detonated 2 homemade bombs which were placed near the buildings housing the offices of the Democratic and Republican National Committees. The siege resulted in at least 5 deaths: 3 from ``medical emergencies,'' 1 pro-Trump extremist who was shot by Capitol Police, apparently while breaking into the Capitol, and 1 Capitol Police officer who apparently was hit repeatedly by protesters wielding a fire extinguisher and subsequently died from his injuries. Furthermore, 2 officers who responded to the violent insurrection reportedly died by suicide in the intervening days, and dozens of officers present at the scene have sustained documented injuries.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Caitlin Emma and Sarah Ferris, ``Second police officer died by suicide following Capitol attack,'' Politico, January 27, 2021. (https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/27/second-officer-suicide- following-capitol-riot-463123) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Context The attack on our Capitol took place against a political and cultural backdrop in which hate has proliferated and gone largely unchecked, particularly over the past 5 years. This has served only to embolden extremists, especially White Supremacist and other right-wing violent extremists. Right-wing extremists--including anti-Government extremists--have been responsible for 75 percent of domestic extremist- related killings in the United States over the course of the past decade, most of them targeting marginalized communities.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ ADL, ``Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2019.'' (https://www.adl.org/media/14107/download) Over the past 10 years, right-wing extremists committed 75 percent of extremist-related murders, making the 2019 figure higher than average. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Therefore, the attack on the Capitol does not mark a sudden increase in extremist violence. Rather, it is the unfortunate and largely predictable result of years of growing hate and violence coming home to roost. Just as the attack did not materialize out of nowhere, the threat has not dissipated in its aftermath. We are all at risk if we do nothing. For years, ADL has warned of the growing threat of White Supremacist violence here in the United States. This goes hand-in-hand with a significant threat of violence from anti-Government extremists, including militia groups. The"
