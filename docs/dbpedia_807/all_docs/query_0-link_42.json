        "text": "Results\n\nCag T4SS complexes were purified from H. pylori as described (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016) and visualized by single particle cryo-EM ( and ). The resulting structure is a large mushroom-shaped complex,~410 Å wide by ~460 Å long, with features that closely match those of the Cag T4SS detected in intact H. pylori using cryo-electron tomography (Chang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019) ( ). The global resolution of the map is 5.4 Å when no symmetry is imposed, with the highest resolution regions found near the center of the complex ( and ). Although particles adopt a preferred orientation in vitrified ice, both en face and side views are present, which allowed for 3D reconstruction ( ). The map can be divided into three major regions: an intricately organized domed cap that is associated with the outer membrane (OMCC), a hollow ring-like mid-region localized within the periplasm (PRC), and a tapered density that extends from the PRC to the inner membrane (Stalk) ( and Video 1). Blurry density around the PRC, also visible in cryo-ET images (Chang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019), may represent a dynamic or less-structured portion of the T4SS ( ). Using symmetry, focused refinement, and symmetry expansion, we determined a 3.7 Å resolution map of the OMCC and a 3.5 Å map of the PRC ( , , Videos 2 and 3). The resolution of the OMCC and PRC maps made it possible to trace the secondary structure in these regions ( and Videos 2 and 3). Since only a small number of T4SS particles seen in vitrified ice contained the Stalk density, it was not possible to determine the symmetry or obtain high resolution of this part of the complex. An axial section through the map in shows a large cavity running through the Cag T4SS, starting from where the OMCC spans the outer membrane (OM) and extending to the bottom of the PRC ( ). The tapered end of the Stalk begins in the PRC channel and continues through the inner membrane (IM). Models developed from cryo-ET analyses of both the H. pylori and L. pneumophila T4SSs propose a channel in this region of the complex (Ghosal et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2018; Chetrit et al., 2018; Ghosal et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019). A central section through the longitudinal plane of 3D density suggests there may be a channel that runs through the Stalk ( ). However, due to the low resolution of the Stalk, this channel cannot be clearly visualized in the 3D map.\n\nFigure 1—figure supplement 1.\n\nFigure 1—figure supplement 2.\n\nVideo 1.\n\nDownload video file.(2.3M, mp4)\n\nVideo 2.\n\nDownload video file.(40M, mp4)\n\nVideo 3.\n\nDownload video file.(27M, mp4)\n\nThe OMCC, with 14-fold symmetry, makes up the ‘mushroom cap’ of the T4SS and is organized into a central and outer ring connected by ‘spokes’ ( ). The outer ring of the OMCC surrounds a central chamber that is ~270 Å wide and tapers to a ~ 35 Å opening at the top ( ). As seen in OMCCs from minimized T4SSs (Sgro et al., 2018; Chandran et al., 2009), the H. pylori Cag T4SS OMCC contains both an outer layer (O-layer) and a thinner inner layer (I-layer) ( ). ‘Spokes’ and outer rings are visible in both the O-layer and I-layer of the Cag T4SS ( and ), but are not present in OMCCs from minimized T4SSs. The resolution of the cap is high enough to begin mapping the molecular organization of individual OMCC components ( ). Previous mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses indicated that the isolated complexes contain CagY, CagX, CagM, CagT, and Cag3 (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016). In the map, we can trace and identify portions of CagY (residues 1677–1816 and 1850–1907), CagX (residues 349–510), and CagT (residues 26–269) ( and , left panels).\n\nFigure 3—figure supplement 1.\n\nFigure 4—figure supplement 1.\n\nFigure 4—figure supplement 2.\n\nCagY forms the crest of the cap-like structure of the OMCC and is comprised of β-sheets intertwining to position two helices per protomer atop the cap ( and , left panel). We predict that these helices breach the outer membrane, resulting in the formation of a channel ( ). The C-terminal portion of CagX is comprised of two β-sheets preceded by a long helix ( and , left panel). This helix extends from the top of the O-layer through the central chamber into the I-layer of the OMCC ( ). Adjacent to CagX, we traced a continuous chain 243 residues long corresponding to CagT ( ). It includes a globular subdomain consisting of two β-sheets followed by a long C-terminal extension of three helices that contribute to the spoke and extend toward the edge of the map ( and , left panel). A predicted lipidation site within the N-terminal tail of CagT (Fischer, 2011; Akopyants et al., 1998) was not observed in the cryo-EM map, but the N-terminus of CagT is positioned for this interaction with the outer membrane.\n\nExtending to the edge of the O-layer, we have constructed poly-alanine models of protein(s) that we could not identify ( and ). These components fill the remaining density within the spokes and consist predominantly of a repetitive fold composed of repeating units of β-sheets flanked by helices ( and ). We predict that Cag3 is a component of the OMCC periphery based on a previous study showing that Cag T4SS complexes isolated from a Δcag3 mutant strain lacked peripheral components of the OMCC (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2019), but we were unable to obtain a register. Within the I-layer we have observed at least two distinct bundles of helices of ~200 residues and ~300 residues ( and ). Based on structural studies of the X. citri T4SS (Grohmann et al., 2018), the I-layer of the Cag T4SS is predicted to contain portions of CagY and CagX, but none of the poly-alanine models allowed us to unambiguously attribute any portion of CagY, CagX, or other T4SS components to this region.\n\nThe PRC, with 17-fold symmetry ( and ), is a short hollow tube, 90 Å tall and 185 Å wide with 96 Å internal diameter ( ), connecting the OMCC and the Stalk regions of the Cag T4SS ( ). Although PRCs have not been detected in structural studies of E. coli or X. citri T4SSs (Waksman, 2019), this region was identified in cryo-ET studies of both H. pylori and L. pneumophila T4SSs (Ghosal et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2018; Chetrit et al., 2018; Ghosal et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019). The protein(s) in this region of the cryo-EM maps were modeled as three distinct polyalanine chains ( ). This portion of the H. pylori Cag T4SS structure is predicted to contain CagM (Waksman, 2019; Chang et al., 2018), but the three polyalanine chains could not be unambiguously attributed to CagM or other T4SS components. A symmetry mismatch occurs between the OMCC and PRC, going from 14-fold symmetry in the OMCC to 17-fold symmetry in the PRC. While the OMCC, PRC, and Stalk make physical contact in the lower resolution structure with no applied symmetry ( ), in the refined structures these connections are lost because of the symmetry mismatch. Analysis of the 5.4 Å structure suggests that the connection between OMCC and PRC may occur by contacts between the 14 α-helices extending from the N-terminus of CagX and the 17 unidentified α-helices extending up from the PRC ( , and ). The tips of these α-helices are presumed to be flexible, since the corresponding densities are not well defined in the higher resolution maps ( ).\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPurification of the H. pylori Cag T4SS core complex\n\nThe purification of the Cag T4SS complex was done using a previously described approach (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016) with reduced deoxycholate concentration (0.025%).\n\nEM sample preparation\n\nFor cryo-EM, 5 ul of the Cag T4SS sample (as purified) was applied to a glow discharged ultrathin continuous carbon film on Lacey 400 mesh copper grids (TED PELLA). The sample was applied to a grid, incubated for 60 s and vitrified by plunge-freezing in a slurry of liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot at 4°C and 100% humidity.\n\nCryo-EM data collection\n\nAll the images were collected on the Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a K2 Summit Direct Electron Detector (Gatan) operated at 300 kV and having a nominal pixel size of 1.64 Å per pixel. Micrographs were acquired using Leginon software (Suloway et al., 2005). The total exposure time was 8 s and frames were recorded every 0.2 s, resulting in a total accumulated dose of ~60 e− Å−2 using a defocus range of −0.5 to −3.5 μm.\n\nImage processing\n\nAll the Video frames were first dose-weighted and aligned using Motioncor2 (Zheng et al., 2017). The contrast transfer function (CTF) values were determined by Gctf (Zhang, 2016). Image processing was carried out using cryoSPARC, RELION 2.1 and 3.0 (Punjani et al., 2017; Scheres, 2012; Zivanov et al., 2018). Using RELION, approximately 25,000 particles were manually picked from 4600 micrographs and extracted using a box size of 510 pixels (836.4 Å) (Supplementary file 1). The extracted particles were exported to cryoSPARC and used to generate representative two-dimensional (2D) class averages in both cryoSPARC and RELION, and approximately 24,000 (cryoSPARC) and 23,000 (RELION) particles were kept in good class averages. These particles were then subjected to 3D classification with a reference-free initial 3D model. The best 3D class (~17,000 in cryoSPARC and ~20,000 particles in RELION) was used as reference for 3D auto-refinement with and without C14 symmetry (low-pass filtered to 60 Å). Finally, a solvent mask and B-factor were applied to improve the overall features and resolution of the 3D maps with and without C14 symmetry, resulting in reconstruction of 3D maps with a global resolution of 4.1 Å and 5.4 Å, respectively (Supplementary file 1 and ). Estimation of per-particle defocus values (CTF-refinement) was applied to the selected particles using RELION. With the CTF-refined particle stack, C14 symmetry-imposed refinement with a soft mask around the OMCC region of the Cag T4SS core complex was done, resulting in a 3.8 Å resolution 3D map that contained improved features ( and ). Based on the inspection of the asymmetrically refined 3D map showing 14-fold symmetry, relion_particle_symmetry_expand was used to enlarge the particle stack (Zivanov et al., 2018). After signal subtraction and alignment-free 3D classification of the expanded particles using a soft mask around an asymmetric unit (~290,000 particles), one highly populated 3D class was produced which contains ~250,000 expanded particles. The 3D class was then subjected to the masked 3D refinement with local angular searches, resulting in reconstruction of the 3D map at 3.7 Å resolution ( ). All resolutions were calculated using the gold-standard 0.143 FSC.\n\nTo resolve the lower region of the core complex (PRC), signal subtraction for each individual particle containing the PRC signal was used with a soft mask (Supplementary file 1 and ). The subtracted particles were then subjected to the alignment-free focused 3D classification (five classes). Visual inspection of the 3D classes showed that the PRC has 17-fold symmetry. The best 3D class of the PRC (~20,000 particles) was then subjected to a masked 3D refinement with local angular searches. This process was done using either C1, C12, C14 or C17 symmetry. Only the reconstruction using C17 symmetry improved in resolution, resulting in 3D reconstruction of the PRC at 3.5 Å ( ). Resolutions were calculated using the gold-standard 0.143 FSC. Image processing steps are summarized in Supplementary file 1.\n\nModel building, refinement, and validation\n\nThere were no high-resolution structures for any of the known components of the OMCC except for a crystal structure of a small region in CagX (Zhang et al., 2017). Density maps of the OMCC and PRC were of sufficient quality for building de novo models of regions of CagY, CagX, and CagT in COOT ( and ), facilitated by the small crystal structure of CagX and homology models of OMCC components from E. coli and X. citri (Sgro et al., 2018; Chandran et al., 2009). A homology model for a C-terminal region of CagY was constructed from VirB10 (PDB-3JQO) using the Swiss Model server. The CagX crystal structure (PDB-5H3V) and the CagY model were placed within the asymmetric unit of the electron density map using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). These models were manually adjusted and extended in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Density corresponding to CagT was modeled de novo in COOT, and the three proteins (CagT, CagX, and CagY) were further refined in real space using Phenix while applying secondary structure restraints (Adams et al., 2002). Once the asymmetric unit was constructed, 14-fold symmetry was applied in Phenix, and the entire model of the OMCC was subjected to one more round of refinement. Secondary structure elements were built de novo into the remaining density of the OMCC and the PRC asymmetric units in COOT. These models were refined in Phenix as described above, and the entire model was generated by applying 14-fold and 17-fold symmetry to the OMCC and PRC, respectively. The resolution of each individual model was estimated by Fourier Shell correlation against the map used to construct it using the Phenix Cryo-EM Validation tool. Molprobity scores, Clashscores and Ramachandran plots were used to validate the models that were constructed (Chen et al., 2010; Afonine et al., 2018) (Supplementary file 2). Supplementary file 3 shows the FSCs of the half maps against the refined model agree with each other, suggesting that the models are not over-refined. Programs used for structure determination and refinement were accessed through SBGrid (Morin et al., 2013). Structures were rendered using Chimera and ChimeraX (Pettersen et al., 2004; Goddard et al., 2018).\n\nData availability\n\nThe cryo-EM volumes have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession codes EMD-20023 (T4SS C1 reconstruction), EMD-20020 (Focused OMCC Reconstruction), EMD-20022 (OMCC Asymmetric Reconstruction), EMD-20021 (Focused PRC Reconstruction).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.\n\nThank you for submitting your article \"Structure of the Helicobacter pylori Cag Type IV Secretion System\" for consideration as a short report by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.\n\nFollowing discussion among the reviewers, we would like to invite you to prepare a revised submission. There was strong support for publishing your paper. It is the first near-atomic structure of the transmembrane subcomplex from a non-canonical T4SS and this allows for exciting comparisons to previously determined structures.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn this study, Chung et al. used cryo-EM to reveal a near-atomic structure of the membrane-spanning Helicobacter pylori Cag T4SS complex. The authors, in their earlier study, used negative staining electron microscopy to report the overall shape of the Helicobacter pylori Cag T4SS transmembrane complex and revealed that this complex is comprised of five H. pylori proteins, CagM, CagT, Cag3, CagX, and CagY. This is an extension of their previous work. Here, the authors used cryoEM to resolve the membrane-spanning complex at 3-7 Å resolution. The authors showed that the transmembrane cag T4SS has three sub-complexes: a 14-fold symmetric outer membrane core complex (OMCC), 17-fold symmetric periplasmic complex (PRC), and connecting the PRC to the inner membrane is a stalk domain. They discovered an unexpected mismatch in symmetry between the OMCC and the PRC. Using previously reported structures and where possible, by using homology modeling the authors were able to model part of the OMCC. For rest of the OMCC and PRC map, the authors modeled with polyalanine chains. The stalk domain did not resolve well. This is the first near atomic structure of the OMCC/PRC transmembrane subcomplex from a noncanonical T4SS (canonical conjugative T4SS are 12-component minimized systems). This is a really exciting and dramatic advance in resolution in our structural understanding of the Cag T4SS. It is particularly interesting to compare this structure to the previously-determined structures of related systems. The new structural info is wonderful, but surprisingly the paper contains very little new biological insight.\n\nEssential revisions:\n\n1) Some of the structural figures do not clearly depict what the authors are describing, and should be clarified before publication.\n\na) Figure 2B does not successfully show the existence of a chamber – I would recommend reconfiguring the third (right-most) image to a central slice akin to Figure 1E or Figure 3A.\n\nb) Figure 4A could be removed as it is confusing and unclear, and does not show anything that Figure 4B does not. However, I also find Figure 4B to be overly dense and unclear. The colours of CagY and the unknown O-layer are too similar. Perhaps the authors could present Figure 4B as in Figure 4E, in which only one of the symmetric units is shown in colour with the others being gray. As in Figure 4E, two orthogonal views would help. I think this is an important point, because the overall organization of the complex is currently hard to understand even after close examination.\n\nc) Similarly, Figure 6A is confusing and unnecessary because the colours are inconsistent with Figure 6B, and most of the coloured area in the H. pylori structure are concealed. Figure 6B is much clearer, and effectively illustrates the comparisons made in the text by on its own, as is.\n\n2) The authors can only build part of the OMCC and PRC and rest of the density it fitted with polyalanine chains. The authors mention these additional protein densities as 'unknown' protein densities. Since from their earlier paper it is already known which all proteins form the OMCC and PRC and they have purified particles, the authors in their future work might wish to perform cross-linking mass-spectrometry and identify these additional densities in the OMCC and in the PRC. This will reveal the exact constituents of the OMCC and PRC and provide interesting new insights.\n\n3) Flowchart in the Supplementary File 1 needs major revision as is the flowchart is difficult to follow. Please consider following:\n\na) The wording '2D filtered' with cryoSPARC gives a wrong impression. This could be something like selected 'good' particles?\n\nb) You could make another box just below (~24,000 particles ‘2D filtered’) and write ‘ab initio model generation’ then go ‘C1 symmetry’.\n\nc) After 3D refinement (in cryoSPARC), when you are showing, C14 symmetrization, show only the OMCC, showing the PRC and providing 4.1 Å resolution is confusing.\n\nd) In Relion, after 23,000 particles/2D filtered – mention what model was used.\n\ne) Spelling mistake '3D classification'.\n\nf) 'after particle CTF correction', replace: 'after per-particle\" CTF refinement'.\n\ng) Focused 3D classification: PRC+Stalk 14 fold symmetry, not sure what this is showing.\n\nh) Focused 3D refinement: C14 symmetry: only show the OMCC, C17 symmetry only show the PRC at their appropriate levels and show a composite. The stalk is much lower resolution.\n\ni) The OMCC map is 3.7 Å or 3.8 Å?\n\n4) The membrane-spanning complex is constituted of the OMCC, PRC and the stalk. In the conjugative T4SS, a similar stalk density was reported by Low et al. However, two recent in situ studies by Chetrit et al. (2018) and Ghosal et al. (2017) have reported that there this a 'channel' below the PRC in the Legionella T4SS. Since the Legionella T4SS system matches with the Cag system in terms of number of components, shape and appearance, it is likely that the Cag system also has a channel in situ and it collapsed during detergent purification to form the stalk density. The authors should discuss this."
