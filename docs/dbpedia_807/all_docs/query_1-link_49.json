        "text": "Models of DotC, DotD1, DotD2, DotH, and DotK were built within the map of the OMC that was reconstructed with C13 symmetry imposed. While parts of these models were presented in our previous report (Durie et al., 2020), the quality of the new map of the OMC allowed us to extend many of these models for a nearly complete structural analyses of OMC protein structures and, importantly, to build models within the previously undefined regions of the complex. We now present extended, higher resolution models of DotC (residues 28–35, 60–161, and 173–268), DotD1 (residues 24–162), DotD2 (residues 25–160), DotH (residues 271–361), and DotK (residues 40–188) (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1–3 Table 1). These extended models provide additional insight into the arrangement of the N-termini of these proteins, placing predicted lipidation sites of DotC (C19), DotD1 (C19), DotD2 (C19), and DotK (C27) in positions close to the outer membrane (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A; Yerushalmi et al., 2005). In addition, we modeled into these maps Lpg0657, which we now call Dis1 (Dot/Icm Secretion), in close agreement with our previous assignment (Durie et al., 2020). However, the model contains a newly resolved extension within the N-terminus of Dis1 (residues 42–65 and 88–98) which forms two helices that extend ‘up’ from the OMC disk, placing them near, or perhaps within, the outer membrane. A previous study found that a transposon mutant interrupting the Dis1 gene resulted in a strain that replicates as well as the wild-type strain in liquid culture, but has an intracellular growth defect in both Acanthamoeba castellanii and bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, consistent with Dis1 playing an important role in Dot/Icm T4SS function (Goodwin et al., 2016).\n\nTable 1\n\nIn addition to the improved models discussed above, this new map identifies the three chains within the OMC that were previously unknown (described simply as ‘chain 1’, ‘chain 2’, and ‘chain 3’) (Figure 2). The former ‘chain 1’ is Lpg0823, now named Dis2 (residues 40–115, Figure 2—figure supplement 5A). Dis2 is positioned near the outer membrane and consists of two lobes, similar in both sequence and structure, that are pinned together with a total of five disulfide bonds, all of which show strong density within the map (Figure 2—figure supplement 5B-D). A DALI search of Dis2 returned no significant structural similarity among PDB entries, making its function difficult to infer (Holm, 2020). Together, the predicted membrane interaction sites in DotC, DotD1, DotD2, DotK, would anchor the Dot/Icm T4SS to the outer membrane at seven positions per asymmetric unit (Figure 2—figure supplement 4E). The improved density maps have allowed us to visualize new structural features and details of previously identified Dot/Icm T4SS components and identify the composition of peptide chains that were previously not able to be modeled. The organization of these regions in regard to the location of their predicted lipidation sites provides the first molecular insight into how this complex becomes anchored in the outer membrane of the bacteria.\n\nWe identify ‘chain 2’ as Lpg2847 (residues 29–320), now referred to as Dis3. Dis3, predominantly a β-helical protein, is the major contributor to the ‘arms’ that extend outward radially from the disk of the OMC (Figure 2—figure supplement 6A). Dis3 consists of a total of 14 helical rungs and is structurally similar to membrane associated proteins found in Parabacteroides distasonis (gene BDI3087; PDB 3J × 8), Bacteroides fragilis (gene BF0425; PDB 3PET), and B. pertussis (pertactin; PDB 1DAB, Figure 2—figure supplement 6B). The exterior face of Dis3 is predominantly electropositive, potentially facilitating an interaction with the electronegative head groups of the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (Figure 2—figure supplement 6C). Notably, the C-terminus of Dis3 contacts three different proteins within the OMC: Dis1, DotK, and DotD1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 6D). The presence of Dis2 (Lpg0823, UniprotKB Q5ZXA9) and Dis3 (Lpg2847, UnitprotKB Q5ZRN3) in the isolated Dot/Icm T4SS was confirmed by mass spectrometry using four biologically independent purifications (Table 2). Lpg2847 was previously identified as part of a two-gene operon with lpg2848 or snrnA, an RNase secreted by the L. pneumophila T2SS (Rossier et al., 2009). Insertional mutants of both the srnA and dis1 genes were prepared and tested for the ability to secrete the RNase through the T2SS (Rossier et al., 2009). The dis1 mutant showed no growth defect in the protozoan host H. vermiformis, a well-accepted assay for T2SS function, but has not yet been tested specifically for T4SS assembly or function (Rossier et al., 2009).\n\nTable 2\n\nThis is not the first time that additional components have been described in the Dot/Icm T4SS directly from the cryo-EM density map. In fact, in 2020 alone three proteins have been identified as components of the Dot/Icm T4SS through high-resolution cryo-EM: Lpg0294 (DotY), Lpg0657 (Dis1), and Lpg1549 (DotZ) (Durie et al., 2020; Meir et al., 2020). Although there is no apparent link between these three genes and the other known components of the Dot/Icm T4SS, a targeted genetic analysis may shed light on how these genes have been integrated into this system. Further studies are needed to probe the function of these newly identified Dot/Icm components.\n\nFinally, we identified ‘chain 3’ as DotF (DotF1, residues 208–266). This portion of DotF consists of a small globular fold comprised of two β-sheets each consisting of three strands (Figure 2—figure supplement 7A). One face of DotF interacts with rungs 9, 10, and 11 of Dis3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 7B). The interface between the two proteins is comprised of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridges (Figure 2—figure supplement 7C). A DALI search of this portion of DotF resulted in several hits, most notably a T2SS protein from Escherichia coli known as GspC (PDB 3OSS) and a pilus protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa known as PilP (PDB 21C4, Figure 2—figure supplement 7D). Like DotF, both structurally similar proteins are found within the periplasm in their respective systems (Korotkov et al., 2011; Tammam et al., 2011).\n\nThere are a total of four chains within the C18 symmetry-imposed map of the PR. Three of these chains were unambiguously determined to be portions of a second copy of DotF (DotF2), DotG, and DotH, while one chain could not be identified and was left as a polyalanine chain model (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1–2 ). Located in the interior of the PR is a portion of DotG (residues 791–824) consisting of a single helix that starts from the inner membrane side of the PR and is followed by a short loop that extends toward the outer membrane or ‘top’ of the complex (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). The short loop of DotG contacts a globular domain of DotH consisting of two β-sheets composed of four and five β-strands that contain residues 104–263 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). The interaction that is observed between DotG/DotH in the PR is similar in structure to those previously reported for VirB10/VirB9 and CagX/CagY and likely reflects an important function for retaining this organization within the PR (Sheedlo et al., 2020; Sgro et al., 2018).\n\nThe structure of DotH is similar to the N-terminal regions of VirB9 (PDB 6GYB, residues 27–133) and CagX (PDB 6 × 6 J, residues 32–311), making DotH a bona fide structural homolog of VirB9 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D) despite very little sequence similarity (Sheedlo et al., 2020; Sgro et al., 2018). The arrangement of DotH and DotG within the PR is similar to interactions between VirB9/VirB10 (PDB 6GYB) in the Xanthomonas citri T4SS and CagX/CagY (PDB 6X6J ) within the PR of the H. pylori Cag T4SS (Figure 3—figure supplement 3E; Sheedlo et al., 2020; Sgro et al., 2018). Interestingly, the X. citri T4SS core complex is smaller and composed of fewer components than the Dot/Icm and Cag T4SSs, and its region that shows structural similarity to the PR of the Dot/Icm and Cag T4SSs has previously not been considered a separate region of the X. citri core complex. Instead, previous reports describe an outer and inner layer of the X. citri T4SS (Sgro et al., 2018). However, when comparing the structures of the Dot/Icm and Cag T4SSs with the prototype X. citri T4SSs, it appears that its inner layer should now be considered structurally similar to the PR regions of the larger Dot/Icm and Cag T4SSs. Importantly, one major distinction observed for the X. citri T4SS is that the outer and inner layers of its core complex share the same symmetry operator (C14), rather than contain a symmetry mismatch as observed for both the Dot/Icm and Cag T4SSs.\n\nLocated adjacent to DotH and on the periphery of the PR is a small globular domain that we identified as DotF (residues 207–269). This portion of DotF consists of the same residues as was discovered in the OMC (DotF1) and thus, likely represents unique copies of DotF which we call DotF2. DotF2 is nearly identical in structure to the model of DotF1 that was built in the C13 symmetry-imposed maps of the OMC (RMSD of 0.5 Å). This results in a total of 31 copies of DotF contained within the intact Dot/Icm T4SS (Figure 3—figure supplement 4A). DotF2 engages DotH using a similar interface to that of DotF1 and Dis3, with buried surface areas of 575 and 655 Å, respectively (Figure 3—figure supplement 4B-D).\n\nThe models that were generated from the 2.8 Å resolution, symmetry-imposed reconstructions of the OMC and PR were fit into the 3.8 Å map of the Dot/Icm T4SS that was generated without the imposition of symmetry. All models fit well within the asymmetric map with only minor changes in the positions of backbone atoms observed for each protein (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplements 1–5). Notably, we modeled portions of two regions of the map that contained additional density within the asymmetric reconstruction. First, we observe 13 linkers between the OMC and PR (identified as residues 264–270 of DotH) in various conformations, revealing the direct connections between the two regions. Second, we observed five small globular folds located between the OMC and PR (Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 6A-C). These folds consist of two β-sheets and incorporate the linker from DotH as an additional β-strand in one of the two sheets (Figure 4—figure supplement 6C). Close inspection clearly showed that these domains contain folds nearly identical to that of the C-terminal domain of DotH in the OMC (residues 278–360). Upon fitting the C-terminal domain of DotH into this portion of the map, the register correlates well with the model, with mean side-chain CC values ranging from 0.68 to 0.72 (Figure 4—figure supplement 6D). We propose that these five additional domains of the DotH C-terminal domain are the five copies that do not span the symmetry mismatch between the OMC and PR. Thus, there are 18 copies of DotH in the entire structure with all 18 NTDs comprising the PR, 13 of the associated CTDs extending up to build part of the OMC disk, and the other five CTDs extending up only part way into the intervening space. Each of the intervening DotH C-terminal domains between the OMC and PR occurs every two to three asymmetric units, and the degree to which they can be observed varies, indicating that the position of these domains is not static with respect to the PR or the OMC (Figure 4B and Video 1). The flexibility of these five DotH CTDs suggests a mechanism through which the symmetry mismatch observed between the OMC and PR can be accommodated though the utility of the symmetry mismatch cannot be inferred.\n\nVideo 1\n\nInterestingly, we do not see similar densities between the OMC and PR of the H. pylori Cag T4SS, even though there is also a symmetry mismatch in this system and DotH is structurally homolgous to CagX. With this understanding of how the symmetry mismatch is accommodated in the Dot/Icm T4SS, we propose that flexible and/or dynamic connection between regions of PR and OMC, that are not seen in the Cag T4SS, will be important for the Dot/Icm T4SS translocating such a uniquely large repertoire of secretion substrates. Although we are now in a position to describe how the symmetry mismatch is accommodated, its impact on function remains to be determined.\n\nFive maps of the T4SS were reconstructed using a 3DVA in cryoSPARC that resolved the secondary structure of the dome positioned in the center of the OMC (Figure 5A, and Table 3). To conduct this analysis, the particles had to be downsampled from 1.1 to 2.2 Å/pix, resulting in a lower global resolution of ~4.6 Å. Within this dome there are 16 α-helices that appear nearly identical at this resolution. Since this resolution is already close to the Nyquist limit of the data (~4.4 Å), imposing C16 symmetry did not improve the resolution of the maps. However, based on previous studies of T4SSs, we reasoned that this portion of the T4SS may correspond to DotG, the proposed L. pneumophila homolog of VirB10 via sequence comparisons (Nagai and Kubori, 2011). Indeed, a model of the C-terminal domain of DotG generated in Swiss Model using VirB10 as a template fits into the resolved dome density (Figure 5B; Waterhouse et al., 2018). This finding is consistent with our previous observation that the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex isolated from a dotG deletion strain lacked the dome portion of the OMC (Durie et al., 2020). Interestingly, the interface between the 16 copies of DotG and the rest of the OMC disk is sparse, potentially leading to the low-resolution reconstruction of this portion of the map (Video 2). Based on the structure of DotG modeled within the PR (residues 791–824) and the homology model fit into the dome density (consisting approximately of residues 857–1046), we hypothesize that DotG extends from the PR to the dome, though a physical connection between the two structures is not observed. This would lead to a total of 18 copies of DotG in the intact Dot/Icm T4SS with two copies of DotG not visualized within the dome likely due to structural heterogeneity. Taken together, we propose a final stoichiometry of 31:26:18:18:13:13:13:13:13 (DotF:DotD:DotG:DotH:DotC:DotK:Dis1:Dis2:Dis3) for the Dot/Icm T4SS.\n\nTable 3\n\nVideo 2\n\nIn addition to the portion of the dome that we predict is DotG, there are also two segments of DotC that were not resolved in our previous electron microscopy density maps. These include an internal connection (residues 162–172) and a relatively long N-terminal extension (residues 28–57, Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The internal bridge within DotC consists of a single loop connecting residues 161 and 173. In contrast, the N-terminal extension of DotC was modeled as two relatively large helices positioned near DotG and bridging adjacent asymmetric units (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Notably, this portion of DotC was only observed in either four or five of the 13 copies of DotC observed in each map. The copies of DotC that contain this portion are positioned such that this extension is in a similar position relative to DotG within the dome (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and Video 3).\n\nVideo 3\n\nThe discovery of the DotG C-terminal domain within the dome density is in line with previous reports that hypothesized that DotG is a homolog of VirB10. However, we have unexpectedly uncovered that the Dot/Icm incorporates only 16 copies of DotG into the OMC dome out of the 18 DotG copies in the PR, giving rise to another symmetry mismatch within this system. The finding that there is variability within the N-terminus of DotC also suggests that interactions between DotG and the rest of the OMC disk are primarily mediated by DotC. Future studies will seek to resolve the origin of the C16:C18 (dome:PR) mismatch, including the location and role of the two DotG C-terminal domains that do not span the mismatch, as well as the interactions between DotC and DotG.\n\nWhen comparing the five maps determined using 3DVA, not only does DotG sample different positions in the ‘dome’ with respect to the rest of the OMC, but the PR occupies different positions with respect to the OMC disk as well. Having noted that the OMC disk is anchored into the outer membrane with as many as seven interactions per asymmetric unit (or over 90 for the complete complex) and having observed multiple conformations of the OMC dome and the PR relative to the OMC disk, we visualized the continuously distributed conformations in the context of a movie (Video 4). The movie shows that the OMC dome, OMC disk, and PR of Dot/Icm T4SS can accommodate various orientations in relation to each other that suggest that the complex could undergo a ratcheting motion, in which the dome and PR rotate back and forth about the central axis with the different regions of the complex tethered together by the physical connections across the symmetry mismatches. This leads to a prediction that the multiple symmetry mismatches and various conformational states of the complex are important in how the Dot/Icm T4SS accommodates a larger number of protein substrates than other T4SSs (Schroeder, 2017).\n\nVideo 4\n\nFor cryo-EM, 4 μl of the isolated Dot/Icm T4SS sample was applied to a glow discharged ultrathin continuous carbon film on Quantifoil 2/2 200 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Services). The sample was applied to the grid 5 consecutive times and incubated for ~60 s after each application. The grid was then rinsed in water to remove detergent before vitrification by plunge-freezing in a slurry of liquid ethane using an FEI vitrobot at 4°C and 100% humidity.\n\nThe data were collected at the Stanford-SLAC Cryo-EM Facility (Menlo Park, CA) using Titan Krios microscopes (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) operated at 300 keV and equipped with a Quantum energy filter. The images were collected with a K3 Summit direct electron detector operating in counting mode, at a nominal magnification of 81,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 1.1 Å. The energy slit was set at a width of 15 eV. The total dose was 50 e/Å2, fractionated over 33 frames in 2.96 s. Data were collected using EPU software (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) with a nominal defocus range set from −1.5 to −2.1 μm. A total of 12,263 micrographs were collected.\n\nThe video frames were first dose-weighted and aligned using Motioncor2 (Zheng et al., 2017). The contrast transfer function (CTF) values were determined using CTFFind4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015). Image processing was carried out using cryoSPARC, RELION 3.0, and RELION 3.1 (Punjani et al., 2017; Zivanov et al., 2018). Using the template picker in cryoSPARC, 1,389,426 particles were picked from 12,204 micrographs. Particles were extracted using a 510 pixel box size (1.1 Å/pix). The extracted particles were used to generate representative 2D classes in cryoSPARC and ~136,000 particles found in the well-resolved classes were kept. The selected particles were used for an ab initio model in cryoSPARC, which was then used as the reference for 3D auto-refinement with and without C13 symmetry (lowpass filtered to 30 Å). Finally, a solvent mask and B-factor were applied to improve the overall features and resolution of the 3D maps with and without C13 symmetry, resulting in reconstruction of 3D maps with a global resolution of 3.4 Å (C13) and 3.8 Å (C1).\n\nThe C13 refined volumes and corresponding particles were then exported to RELION for focused refinements. Estimation of beam-tilt values (CTF-refinement) was applied to the selected particles using RELION. With the CTF-refined particle stack, C13 symmetry-imposed refinement with a soft mask around the core complex was done, resulting in a 3.8 Å resolution 3D map.\n\nFor focused refinement of the OMC disk, signal subtraction for each particle containing the OMC disk was used with a soft mask. The subtracted particles were subjected to alignment-free focused 3D classification (three classes). The best resolved 3D class of the OMC (~89,000 particles) was then subjected to a masked 3D refinement with local angular searches using C13 symmetry resulting in a 3.7 Å resolution density map. Estimation of per-particle defocus values (CTF-refinement) was applied to the selected particles using RELION. With the CTF-refined particle stack, C13 symmetry-imposed refinement with a soft mask around the OMC disk region of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex was done, resulting in a 3.2 Å resolution 3D map that contained improved structural features. B-factor sharpening and calculation of masked Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves steps resulted in the final OMC disk map with 2.8 Å resolution.\n\nThe same steps were followed for focused refinement of the PR, starting with signal subtraction for each particle containing the PR with a soft mask. The subtracted particles were subjected to alignment-free focused 3D classification (three classes). The best resolved 3D class of the PR (~44,000 particles) was selected based on class distribution (particle distribution), estimated resolution, and comparison of the 3D density maps. This class was then subjected to a masked 3D refinement with local angular searches using C18 symmetry resulting in a 7.5 Å resolution. Estimation of per-particle defocus values (CTF-refinement) was applied to the selected particles using RELION. With the CTF-refined particle stack, C18 symmetry-imposed refinement with a soft mask around the PR region of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex was done, resulting in a 4.1 Å resolution 3D map. These maps contained improved features compared to those prior to CTF-refinement. B-factor sharpening and calculation of masked FSC curves resulted in the final PR map with 2.8 Å resolution in.\n\nIn a separate workflow from that used for focused refinements, 3DVA in cryoSPARC was performed to assess continuous flexibility in the dome of the OMC. For this analysis, ~136,000 particles, which had resulted in a 3.8 Å resolution map with no symmetry imposed as described above, and, because of box size limits in cryoSPARC, were downsampled to a 250 pixel box size (~2.2 Å/pix). A new ab initio model was generated from these down sampled particles, and a C1 homogeneous refinement resulted in a 4.6 Å map. 3DVA was then performed using the downsampled particles and mask from the refinement job, three modes, and a filter resolution of 5 Å. The 3DVA display job was run in the simple output mode with 20 frames per clusters. All clusters exhibited the differences in alignment of the C16 dome and the C18 PR about the rotational axis, with the C13 OMC disk held in the same relative position (Video 4). The 3DVA display job was then run in the cluster output mode with five clusters. The particles and maps from each cluster were separately subjected to C1 homogeneous refinement. In each case, the resulting 3D maps were at 4.6 Å resolution.\n\nTo construct a model of the OMC, the asymmetric unit of the previously determined structure of the OMC (PDB 6 × 62) was first extracted in Pymol and docked into the map presented here using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). This model was then refined in PHENIX using Phenix.real.space.refine (Afonine et al., 2018). The models were then inspected in Coot, and any subtle differences between the two maps were examined and corrected by hand. Where appropriate, the models were extended in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010). Each of the components that were identified in this study (Lpg0823, Lpg2847, and DotF1) were constructed de novo in Coot to generate a model of the entire asymmetric unit. This model was then refined in PHENIX using secondary structure and Ramachandran restraints. The refinement strategy was also optimized by adjusting the nonbonded weighting. A model of the entire OMC was then generated in PHENIX by applying symmetry and further refined as described above. The model was inspected for fit by hand and validated in Phenix using phenix.validation.cryoem. A model of the PR was constructed essentially as described above using as a starting point the previously reported polyalanine models (PDB 6 × 64). The models were adjusted in Coot, symmetrized, and refined in PHENIX essentially as described above to generate a model of the entire PR.\n\nTo generate a model of the OMC, the models of the OMC and PR described here (PDBs 7MUC and 7MUE, respectively) were first fit into the map generated without symmetry. The model was then refined in PHENIX and adjusted where necessary in Coot. Models of the DotH linkers were generated by hand in Coot. To model the C-terminal domain of DotH between the OMC and PR, a polyalanine model was first constructed. The DotH C-terminal domain was then aligned to this polyalanine model and refined by hand in Coot. Once completed the asymmetric model was refined in PHENIX."
