        "text": "Cag T4SS complexes were purified from H. pylori as described (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016) and visualized by single particle cryo-EM (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B). The resulting structure is a large mushroom-shaped complex,~410 Å wide by ~460 Å long, with features that closely match those of the Cag T4SS detected in intact H. pylori using cryo-electron tomography (Chang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019) (Figure 1A,B). The global resolution of the map is 5.4 Å when no symmetry is imposed, with the highest resolution regions found near the center of the complex (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E). Although particles adopt a preferred orientation in vitrified ice, both en face and side views are present, which allowed for 3D reconstruction (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,F). The map can be divided into three major regions: an intricately organized domed cap that is associated with the outer membrane (OMCC), a hollow ring-like mid-region localized within the periplasm (PRC), and a tapered density that extends from the PRC to the inner membrane (Stalk) (Figure 1A and Video 1). Blurry density around the PRC, also visible in cryo-ET images (Chang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019), may represent a dynamic or less-structured portion of the T4SS (Figure 1B). Using symmetry, focused refinement, and symmetry expansion, we determined a 3.7 Å resolution map of the OMCC and a 3.5 Å map of the PRC (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Videos 2 and 3). The resolution of the OMCC and PRC maps made it possible to trace the secondary structure in these regions (Figure 1D and Videos 2 and 3). Since only a small number of T4SS particles seen in vitrified ice contained the Stalk density, it was not possible to determine the symmetry or obtain high resolution of this part of the complex. An axial section through the map in Figure 1D shows a large cavity running through the Cag T4SS, starting from where the OMCC spans the outer membrane (OM) and extending to the bottom of the PRC (Figure 1E,F). The tapered end of the Stalk begins in the PRC channel and continues through the inner membrane (IM). Models developed from cryo-ET analyses of both the H. pylori and L. pneumophila T4SSs propose a channel in this region of the complex (Ghosal et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2018; Chetrit et al., 2018; Ghosal et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019). A central section through the longitudinal plane of 3D density suggests there may be a channel that runs through the Stalk (Figure 1B,F). However, due to the low resolution of the Stalk, this channel cannot be clearly visualized in the 3D map.\n\nThe OMCC, with 14-fold symmetry, makes up the ‘mushroom cap’ of the T4SS and is organized into a central and outer ring connected by ‘spokes’ (Figure 2). The outer ring of the OMCC surrounds a central chamber that is ~270 Å wide and tapers to a ~ 35 Å opening at the top (Figure 2B). As seen in OMCCs from minimized T4SSs (Sgro et al., 2018; Chandran et al., 2009), the H. pylori Cag T4SS OMCC contains both an outer layer (O-layer) and a thinner inner layer (I-layer) (Figure 3A). ‘Spokes’ and outer rings are visible in both the O-layer and I-layer of the Cag T4SS (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1), but are not present in OMCCs from minimized T4SSs. The resolution of the cap is high enough to begin mapping the molecular organization of individual OMCC components (Figure 4A,B). Previous mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses indicated that the isolated complexes contain CagY, CagX, CagM, CagT, and Cag3 (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016). In the map, we can trace and identify portions of CagY (residues 1677–1816 and 1850–1907), CagX (residues 349–510), and CagT (residues 26–269) (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C, left panels).\n\nCagY forms the crest of the cap-like structure of the OMCC and is comprised of β-sheets intertwining to position two helices per protomer atop the cap (Figure 4A–C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, left panel). We predict that these helices breach the outer membrane, resulting in the formation of a channel (Figure 4B). The C-terminal portion of CagX is comprised of two β-sheets preceded by a long helix (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, left panel). This helix extends from the top of the O-layer through the central chamber into the I-layer of the OMCC (Figure 4B). Adjacent to CagX, we traced a continuous chain 243 residues long corresponding to CagT (Figure 4C). It includes a globular subdomain consisting of two β-sheets followed by a long C-terminal extension of three helices that contribute to the spoke and extend toward the edge of the map (Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, left panel). A predicted lipidation site within the N-terminal tail of CagT (Fischer, 2011; Akopyants et al., 1998) was not observed in the cryo-EM map, but the N-terminus of CagT is positioned for this interaction with the outer membrane.\n\nExtending to the edge of the O-layer, we have constructed poly-alanine models of protein(s) that we could not identify (Figure 4A,B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). These components fill the remaining density within the spokes and consist predominantly of a repetitive fold composed of repeating units of β-sheets flanked by helices (Figure 4A,B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). We predict that Cag3 is a component of the OMCC periphery based on a previous study showing that Cag T4SS complexes isolated from a Δcag3 mutant strain lacked peripheral components of the OMCC (Frick-Cheng et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2019), but we were unable to obtain a register. Within the I-layer we have observed at least two distinct bundles of helices of ~200 residues and ~300 residues (Figure 4A,B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Based on structural studies of the X. citri T4SS (Grohmann et al., 2018), the I-layer of the Cag T4SS is predicted to contain portions of CagY and CagX, but none of the poly-alanine models allowed us to unambiguously attribute any portion of CagY, CagX, or other T4SS components to this region."
