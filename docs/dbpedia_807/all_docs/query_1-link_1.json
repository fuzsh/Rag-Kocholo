It was created by Callie Khouri and produced by R. J. Cutler, Khouri, Dee Johnson, and Steve Buchanan through season four, Connie Britton through season five, and Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from season five on.\n\nThe series chronicles the lives of various fictitious country music singers in Nashville, Tennessee, starring Connie Britton as Rayna Jaymes, a legendary country music superstar, whose stardom begins fading, and Hayden Panettiere as rising younger star Juliette Barnes. Britton left the show in season five.[2]\n\nThe series first aired on ABC on October 10, 2012. It was cancelled by ABC in May 2016 after 4 seasons. It was renewed by CMT that June and a fifth season (with new producers, writers and showrunners) first aired on January 5, 2017.[3] A sixth and final season began airing on January 4, 2018,[4] and the series ended on July 26, 2018.[5]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Nashville episodes\n\nIn the first episode, the series focuses on the rivalry of Rayna Jaymes and Juliette Barnes. Rayna Jaymes is the established \"Queen of Country Music\". However, her latest album is not selling well and her tour is playing to half empty venues. Her record label suggests that she open for Juliette Barnes, the young and beautiful best-selling singer of bubble gum country pop. Juliette sees Rayna as privileged and purposefully alienates her. Rayna, who dislikes Juliette's style of music, rejects a joint tour out of hand. The two women come into conflict as each tries to get guitarist Deacon Claybourne, Rayna's bandmate and former lover, to sign on to their tour. Rayna's life is further complicated when her estranged father, millionaire businessman Lamar Wyatt, convinces her husband, Teddy Conrad, to run for Mayor of Nashville.\n\nFor later episodes through season four, the series follows the lives of country musicians, focusing on three female leads: country superstar Rayna Jaymes, rising problematic star Juliette Barnes, and newcomer singer-songwriter Scarlett O'Connor.\n\nFrom mid-season five, the series follows the lives of country musicians, focusing on two female leads: rising star Maddie Conrad, Rayna Jaymes' daughter, and fading star Juliette Barnes, as well as focusing on recurring characters.\n\nThe premise beginning with season six followed country stars Juliette Barnes, Deacon Claybourne, and the Highway 65 record label family as they strive to keep Rayna Jaymes' dream alive and pursue their music while juggling relationships, family, and the ever-changing industry.[6]\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nConnie Britton as Rayna Jaymes (seasons 1–5; guest season 6): a 40-year-old country music superstar singer whose stardom is beginning to fade\n\nHayden Panettiere as Juliette Barnes: a bubblegum country pop singer and former teen star sensation who is determined to replace Rayna as the top superstar of country music\n\nClare Bowen as Scarlett O'Connor: a poet and songwriter, Deacon's niece, and musician partner with Gunnar who works at the Bluebird Cafe, which is where she performs and is first noticed\n\nEric Close as Teddy Conrad (seasons 1–3; guest seasons 4–6): Rayna's husband who, after a business failure, is now living on his wife's income.

Khouri lived in Nashville from 1978 to 1982.[18] In an interview for The New York Times she said \"This is a place that can be mocked and made fun of, and sometimes it deserves it, like any place. But it also is an incredibly beautiful, cosmopolitan city, and I wanted to show that to the world. I want to represent it in a way that everybody who lives here would find completely realistic.\"[18] Nashville was the first television series in Khouri's career, after working for two decades as a film writer and director creating strong female characters.[19]\n\nThe production began in 2011. In October 2011, ABC bought the original concept from Khouri.[20] Documentary filmmaker R. J. Cutler also joined the project as executive producer alongside Khouri.[20] Nashville was produced by Lionsgate Television with ABC Studios. ABC ordered the pilot on January 27, 2012.[21][22] The pilot episode was filmed in March 2012 and directed by series producer R. J. Cutler.[23] The series was picked up by ABC on May 11, 2012, and premiered on the network on October 10, 2012 as part of its 2012–13 television season.[24] Dee Johnson joined the series as executive producer and showrunner as of the fourth episode, replacing Jim Parriott.[25][26] On November 12, 2012, the series was picked up for a full season run,[27] which was shortened by one episode by the producers (due to production difficulties) rather than the network.[28]\n\nA number of television critics characterized Nashville as \"Dallas in Tennessee.\"[29][30] The original concept was focused on the backdrop of the real country music world.[20] ABC's promotional campaign for the series premiere was primarily focused on the rivalry between a young and ruthless country pop diva (Panettiere) and a past-her-peak superstar (Britton).[18] Nashville was filmed on location and on soundstages in Nashville. The Bluebird Cafe, an important local performance arena, is a frequent setting; the show's art department, headed by production designer Jeff Knipp, precisely replicated its exterior and interior in a Nashville sound stage.[31] After weeks of rumors that production would move elsewhere, it was announced that season two would also be filmed on location in Nashville.[32] Nashville budget hovered in the neighborhood of $4 million per episode in season one.[33] The budget for each season of the series was roughly $39.7 million, $90.2 million, $91.7 million, $85.6 million, $86.6 million, and $62.4 million respectively, with the series' budget as a whole totaling $456 million.[1]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish actor Sam Palladio was the first regular member to be cast, being announced on February 14, 2012.[34] Australian actress and singer Clare Bowen was the next addition to the pilot, as Scarlett O'Connor, on February 17, 2012.[35] On February 22, General Hospital cast member Jonathan Jackson joined the cast in the role of Avery Barkley.[36][37][38] On February 23, Emmy Award winner Powers Boothe joined the cast as Lamar Wyatt, father of lead character.[39] On February 29, it was announced that Hayden Panettiere had landed the role of Juliette Barnes, originally planned as the primary antagonist of the series.[40][41] On March 1, 2012 Robert Wisdom was cast as Coleman Carlisle, one of the supporting regular characters.[42] On March 5 Eric Close joined the ensemble cast as Teddy Conrad, Rayna's husband.[43] On March 6, it was announced that Connie Britton would play leading role of Rayna Jaymes, 40-year-old fading country superstar.[44][45][46] Britton also serves as a co-executive producer of the series. On March 13, 2012, Charles Esten joined the cast in the final regular role of Deacon Claybourne, Rayna's bandmate and former lover.[47]\n\nBritton stated that her character, Rayna was based on several country singers, including Faith Hill, Reba McEntire, and Bonnie Raitt.[48] Panettiere denied that her character resembled Taylor Swift,[48] and stated that Juliette was instead based on herself—a young woman in the entertainment industry—and Carrie Underwood.[49][50]\n\nAlongside the nine regular cast members during the first season, several actors were cast in recurring roles. Judith Hoag appeared in the series as Tandy Hampton, Rayna's sister.[51] Sylvia Jefferies played the role of Jolene Barnes, Juliette's mother.[52] On August 29, 2012, it was announced that Kimberly Williams-Paisley joined the cast as Margaret \"Peggy\" Kenter.[53] J.

They were the first two cast members to be cut as producers tried to bring down production costs.[72][73] Britton chose to leave the series halfway through the fifth season. Later series regulars included Rachel Bilson, as Alyssa Greene who joined halfway through season five, and Cameron Scoggins as Zach Welles, who was promoted to a series regular halfway through the season. Kaitlin Doubleday was added to the main cast partway through the fifth season, as Jessie Caine, a mother and singer who returns to the scene.[14][74] Jeffrey Nordling, who recurred during season five, was upped to a series regular for the sixth season, and plays Jessie's ex-husband, record label owner, and Jake's dad.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nashville discography\n\nCreative executive producer Callie Khouri's husband T-Bone Burnett was the show's executive music producer and composer for the first season. When departing the series, his manager cited commitments to other projects,[75] although Burnett later stated that he was also upset with television executives' treatment of his wife.[76] His assistant and the managing producer Buddy Miller took over for Burnett in season two.[75]\n\nOn October 2, 2012, it was announced that Big Machine Records will release all covers and original songs from the series.

But we won't leave you hanging. There's more story to be told. #BringBackNashville.\" The producing partner had already been fielding offers from four or five networks. As the negotiations began to draw to a close, it was rumored that the announcement would be made during the high-profile CMT Music Awards. When no announcement was made, fans began to doubt the show's return. On June 10, 2016, CMT released a press statement stating that a deal had been made with CMT and Hulu. CMT would air a full season of 22 episodes, and Hulu would make them available the next day as well as carry the entirety of the shows backlog.[102] The pick-up was assisted by $11 million in economic incentives: $8.5 million coming via the State of Tennessee Film Office, $1 million from the City of Nashville, $1 million from the Nashville Convention & Visitor Corp., and $500,000 from Ryman Hospitality.[103] It was announced on June 29, 2016 that all cast members with the exception of Will Chase and Aubrey Peeples would return for season 5.\n\nAftershow\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 4, 2017, CMT announced that there would be a Nashville aftershow entitled NashChat.[104] Nashchat aired live across social media platforms immediately following every new episode.[104] It was interactive with the fans, and featured a cast member appearing each week.[105] The host of Nashchat is a co-host of the morning radio show The Bobby Bones Show, Amy Brown. NashChat did not return for season six. As of February 21, 2020 , the episodes are available on CMT's official YouTube account.[106]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nRatings\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason Timeslot (ET) Episodes Premiered Ended TV season Rank Viewers (in millions) 18–49 rating (average) Date Premiere viewers (millions) 18–49 rating Date Finale viewers (millions) 18–49 rating 1 Wednesday\n\n10:00 pm 21 October 10, 2012 8.93[107] 2.8[108] May 22, 2013 6.02[109] 1.9[110] 2012–13 64 6.86[111] 1.87[112] 2 22 September 25, 2013 6.50[113] 2.0[113] May 14, 2014 5.24[114] 1.3[114] 2013–14 62 7.00[115] 1.47[112] 3 22 September 24, 2014 5.80[116] 1.5[116] May 13, 2015 4.65[117] 1.2[117] 2014–15 54 7.44[118] 1.34[112] 4 21 September 23, 2015 4.91[119] 1.2[119] May 25, 2016 4.19[120] 0.9[120] 2015–16 70 6.21[121] 0.94[112] 5 Thursday 9:00 pm\n\n(1, 3–22)\n\nThursday 10:00 pm (2) 22 January 5, 2017 1.74[122] 0.5[122] August 10, 2017 0.68[123] 0.2[123] 2016–17 N/A 0.82[124] 0.19[124] 6 Thursday 9:00 pm 16 January 4, 2018 0.87[125] 0.2[125] July 26, 2018 0.88[126] 0.2[126] 2017–18 N/A 0.74[127] 0.14[127]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response of NashvilleSeasonRotten TomatoesMetacritic192% (50 reviews)[128]85 (32 reviews)[129]2100% (9 reviews)[130]—3100% (8 reviews)[131]—489% (9 reviews)[132]—586% (7 reviews)[133]82 (4 reviews)[134]680% (5 reviews)[135]—\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first season received critical acclaim.

Critics praised Hayden Panettiere's performance, with Lindsay MacDonald stating \"First of all, a round of applause for Hayden Panettiere and her amazing range.

She might be all over the board, but she owns every single scene.\", and the general consensus praising the show's soap elements, and the general music focus. Kaitlin Thomas from TV.com claimed that the series was \"the greatest modern soap the world has ever seen\".[142]\n\nSeason 5\n\n[edit]\n\nThe season five premiere was well received. Most critics praised the season premiere, stating \"The original tenor of the series is one of the things that made it so appealing in the first place. Add to this that the tempo of the narrative is ideal, and episodes never drag\", though Gwen Ihnat from The A.V. Club criticized the season, stating \"Nashville now almost always bums me out, even more so because it used to be a show I once looked forward to every week. But I haven't felt that way in quite a while now.\"[143]\n\nSeason 6\n\n[edit]\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the season an 80%, based on six critics, the lowest of all seasons.

TV gave a positive review, and wrote \"When you combine this bubbly soap opera material with amusingly lively scenes of Will, Avery, and Gunnar getting together to form the band you didn't know you'd always wanted, Nashville seems to be going out with an enjoyable blast.\"[145] New York Magazine gave the season premiere a 3/5.[146] Conversely, Savannah Brooks of The Young Folks claims that \"the characters used to be happy and have a purpose. It's time to stop letting one character's death dictate the rest of the series\", in regards to the sixth season, rating it a 4/10.[147] TVLine cited the cult plotline of the season as one of the worst plot twists of the last decade.[148]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2012, Nashville was one of five honorees in the Most Exciting New Series category at the Critics' Choice Television Awards, voted by journalists who had seen the television pilots for the 2012–13 season.

The series also brought a wave of tourism to the city, with 1 in 5 visitors to the city attributed to having watched the series. Nashville viewers also spent more money and stayed longer in town than usual visitors.[204] Erika Woolam Nichols, COO of The Bluebird Cafe, which was often promoted on the series, stated that \"[The Bluebird] [has] had a lot more interest in the venue from the general public; not just music fans as in the past but a greater cross-section of the population. Now our shows sell out in minutes rather than a few days\", while noting that the venue has \"lots of people who just want to have their picture taken in front of the club.\"[204][205] With the series being \"a brand\"[206] for ABC and Disney, the network set up several Nashville-themed tours and activities; including a four-day, three-night tour package.[204] Further reflecting the series' status as a brand, several displays and promotional posters are on display at Disney World in the ABC Commissary Restaurant.[207]\n\nBroadway adaptation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 5, 2019, it was announced that Scott Delman had acquired the theatrical rights to the series to produce a Broadway musical adaptation of the series with an all-new score.[208]\n\nBluebird Reunion\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral of the series' cast members, including Clare Bowen, Sam Palladio, and Jonathan Jackson reunited for the CMT documentary film Bluebird.
