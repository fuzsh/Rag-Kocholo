Find yourself thinking about stereotypes and realize how quick you are to judge others. Allow these thoughts to be challenged. Sometimes it‚Äôs our differences that bind us and sometimes it‚Äôs our similarities. Regardless, we can and do come together, at times, unexpected.\n\nSTARRING:\n\nNirvan Patnaik\n\nGuy Barfield\n\nShireen Donner\n\nTom Martin\n\nAntwain Lewis\n\nLaura Spaeth\n\nTHE FOLD OF HIS HIP AND\n\nTHE ROCK OF HIS SNORE\n\nA Public Conversation about a Private Monologue\n\nThree people, of different gender and gender expressions, each take turns conveying a personal monologue in which they express a truth they have in common. Each is in love with a man and finds pure security and comfort in him, at least in slumber. We experience how people who live in vastly polar realities can have identical hopes, find identical comfort, and be haunted by identical fears.\n\nSTARRING:\n\nGaynelle T. Jasper\n\nHelene Galek\n\nLarry Stephen Hines\n\nSheikh Muhtade\n\nHer Tennessee Waltz\n\na new radio play by Toby Armour\n\ndirected by George Ferencz\n\nArmour‚Äôs play dramatizes Carrie Chapman Catt‚Äôs leadership of the final effort to secure women‚Äôs right to vote through ratification of the 19th Amendment. Catt‚Äôs mentor, Susan B. Anthony, had spent a lifetime fighting for women‚Äôs suffrage. Dying in 1906, Anthony never saw the end of the struggle, but she never doubted. ‚ÄúFailure is impossible‚Äù were her words. The play is set in 1920 when the battle continued under Catt. The 19th Amendment, giving women suffrage, is coming to a vote in a special session of the Tennessee legislature. If Tennessee, the 36th state, ratifies it, the Amendment will finally become the law of the land after 87 years of struggle.\n\nCampaigning takes place during the sweltering days of August in Nashville. The opposition, led by a coalition of Southern belles and corporate lobbyists, is powerful. Double-dealing, threats, bribery, slander are all part of the action. Carrie Chapman Catt is fighting the battle of her life. It all comes down to one roll call vote in the Tennessee legislature. The suspense is hair-raising as the play shows us‚Äìup close and historically‚Äìhow near the country came to never allowing women to vote.\n\nCAST\n\nRicharda Abrams*\n\nJohn Barilla*\n\nGregory Marlow\n\nSusan Patrick*\n\nKaren Sunde*\n\nJenne Vath*\n\nand the Announcer is Dan Kelley\n\n* Actors appear courtesy of Actors‚Äô Equity\n\nIncidental music is written and performed by Peter Dizozza\n\nassistant director, Karen Oughtred\n\nYou Are Perfect\n\nYou Are Perfect by Cyndy Marion, directed by John Desotelle.\n\nSet in Susan Atkins‚Äô prison cell on the eve before a key moment in the Manson murder trial, You Are Perfect is a theatrical reimagining of the Manson Family member‚Äôs life and inner demons, hurtling through time and space while questioning allegations of murder and deceit.\n\nCAST: Nancy Wolfe, Emily DeSotelle,\n\nand Daniel Yaiullo\n\nDermalogic\n\nDermalogic by Robert Kirkendall.\n\nDirected by Byron C. Saunders.\n\nThe owner of a small skincare company signs a deal with a major retailer, but the suddenness of her decision throws the company into disarray. Some wonder if their small company can handle such a large order, others worry about getting swallowed up by a larger corporate entity and losing their brand, and the rank and file are dreading layoffs and workplace relocation. People jockey for position, alliances are made, and infighting increases and Dermalogic transforms from a small company into a larger player in the skincare field, and in the end, their hierarchy is reformed in an unexpected way.\n\nCast:\n\nSteve Capasso, Rick\n\nRick Kuhn, Carl\n\nKaren Blagmon, Kayla\n\nEstelle Piper, Ellen\n\nMatt Matthews, Stansfield\n\nLori River, Monica\n\nCarrie Wesolowski, Mandy\n\nOdysseus Bailer, Steve\n\nLiam Bobersky, Brody\n\nCathie Boruch, Joelle\n\nTimothy Regan, Devin\n\nValentine‚Äôs TLC from TNC\n\nLissa Moira, curator and director\n\nRoy Chang, technical director\n\nValentine‚Äôs TLC from TNC a glorious cornucopia of performances illuminating the many aspects of love in Theater, Music, And Poetry.

As any nerd would tell you, we are all superheroes constantly fighting our own personal nemeses. No matter who or what they may be, the fight for yourself is always worthwhile.

It could be a clown name but he likes it and he needs it to make his mark. For so many pathetic years he has played in two-bit clubs in Brooklyn, Jersey, Bronx, Queens, and Tuxedo Park.\n\nThen one night through every fault of his own, he becomes entangled with a mob gang similar to ‚Äúthe gang that couldn‚Äôt shoot straight‚Äù or spell straight, not sure. They believe that Snappy has info about a corrupt politician that could make them rich ‚Äì not Donald Trump by the way. The play basically revolves around a farcical chase to kidnap Snappy and hold him for ransom for some reason that makes absolutely no sense. He meets a girl that really makes no real sense either, so at that point of the story he thinks he‚Äôs in love as if you can ‚Äúthink‚Äù whether you are in love of not. So, he dives head first into an empty pool. This provides a smattering of laughs along with some head wounds. In the end we hope that love contains the great cosmic laugh or at least a method on how to get it. If this is not puzzling, then something is wrong.\n\nCast: Marty Shakar, Bob Adrian, David Elyha, Alex Elmaleh, Mary Tierney, Sarah Maria Lafferty, Aedin Moloney, Pat Macnamara\n\nCaf√© Resistance\n\nwritten by Roberto Monticello, directed by Lissa Moira\n\nThe year is 1939, the city is Paris, the Nazis are on the march, and the Occupation is about to begin.
