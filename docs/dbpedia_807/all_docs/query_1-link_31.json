        "text": "Scripps Howard Awards Honor Nation’s Best 2012 Journalism\n\nThe Scripps Howard Foundation today announced the winners of its annual Scripps Howard Awards, honoring the best work in the communications industry and journalism education in 2012.\n\nEstablished in 1953, the Scripps Howard Foundation’s national journalism awards competition is open to news organizations based in the U.S. and recognizes outstanding print, broadcast and online journalism in 15 categories. Two additional categories honor college journalism and mass communication educators for excellence in administration and teaching.\n\nWinners will receive a total of $175,000 and trophies May 9 at a dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in Naples, Fla. Dinner co-hosts are the Scripps Howard Foundation; its corporate founder, The E.W. Scripps Company; and the Naples Daily News, a Scripps publication.\n\nNew this year is a category for digital innovation and expansion of the television and cable competition to honor excellence in two categories, one for in-depth local coverage and another for in-depth national and international coverage.\n\n“Some of the categories offered by the Scripps Howard Awards have changed the past 60 years to reflect the industry’s evolution,” said Mike Philipps, president and CEO of the Scripps Howard Foundation. “But the core values of journalism – accuracy, fairness, context, storytelling and a deep respect for the First Amendment – remain guiding principles.”\n\nEntries in the journalism categories were judged by 51 industry experts, who assembled for two days at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla. Each category was assigned a separate panel of judges and their decisions are final. Selected as winners and finalists:\n\nINVESTIGATIVE REPORTING\n\nSpencer S. Hsu of The Washington Post receives the $15,000 Ursula and Gilbert Farfel Prize, given in cooperation with Ohio University’s Scripps College of Communication and the Farfel Endowment, for “Forensic Science.” The series exposed the Justice Department’s use of flawed data in more than 20,000 criminal convictions. Congress, the courts and the FBI have responded to the series, and now hundreds, if not thousands, of defendants will get another chance at justice.\n\nFinalists: Alison Young and Peter Eisler of USA Today for “Ghost Factories;” and Sally Kestin and John Maines of the Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for “Above the Law: Speeding Cops.”\n\nDISTINGUISHED SERVICE TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT\n\nThe Wall Street Journal receives $10,000 and the Edward Willis Scripps Award for “Watched,” an ongoing project that exposes secretive ways personal information is tracked and used by corporate data-gatherers and government trackers.\n\nFinalists: Scott Shane and Charlie Savage of The New York Times for “The U.S. Government’s Crackdown on Leaks;” and Danielle Ivory, Jim Snyder, Phil Mattingly and Hans Nichols of Bloomberg News for “Untangling the Freedom of Information Act: A Test of Obama’s Transparency Pledge.”\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE REPORTING\n\nPatricia Callahan, Sam Roe and Michael Hawthorne of the Chicago Tribune receive $10,000 and the Roy W. Howard Award for “Playing with Fire.” Their series exposed how the chemical and tobacco industries waged a deceptive, decades-long campaign to promote the use of flame-retardant furniture. As a result, the U.S. Senate has held two hearings, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun a broad investigation and an industry front group exposed by the Tribune has folded.\n\nFinalists: Judges for this category selected the same entries judges for investigative reporting chose as finalists: Alison Young and Peter Eisler of USA Today for “Ghost Factories;” and Sally Kestin and John Maines of the Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for “Above the Law: Speeding Cops.”\n\nHUMAN INTEREST STORYTELLING\n\nMichael M. Phillips of The Wall Street Journal receives $10,000 and the Ernie Pyle Award for “War’s Wake,” a chronicle of America’s newest post-war generation and the manner in which Iraq and Afghanistan have marked the nation’s psyche.\n\nFinalist: ProPublica for “Finding Oscar: Massacre, Memory and Justice in Guatemala” by Sebastian Rotella in collaboration with Ana Arana of Fundacion MEPI.\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nThe Denver Post receives $10,000 and a trophy for its coverage of the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting that left 12 people dead and 58 injured.\n\nFinalist: Asbury Park (N.J.) Press for its coverage of Superstorm Sandy at the Jersey Shore.\n\nDIGITAL INNOVATION\n\nThe New York Times receives $10,000 and a trophy for a portfolio of work that included “Snow Fall,” which chronicled the harrowing story of 16 expert skiers caught in an avalanche at Tunnel Creek.\n\nFinalists: ProPublica for developing news applications that gather, present and analyze data for investigative stories; and Reuters for “The Wider Image.”\n\nTELEVISION/CABLE IN-DEPTH LOCAL COVERAGE\n\nKMGH-TV in Denver receives $10,000 and the Jack R.

The coverage called for adequate compensation for victims and statewide reform.\n\nFinalists: Craig Cheatham and Jim Thomas of KMOV-TV in St. Louis for “War Zone: The Destruction of an All-American City;” and John Ferrugia, Arthur Kane, Jason Foster and Jeff Harris of KMGH-TV in Denver for “A Threat Ignored: The Aurora Theater Shooting Investigation.”\n\nTELEVISION/CABLE IN-DEPTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COVERAGE\n\nJohn Carlos Frey, John Larson and Brian Epstein of the PBS newsmagazine “Need to Know” and The Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute receive $10,000 and the Jack R. Howard Award for their collaborative series, “Crossing the Line at the Border.” Their documentation of abuses by the U.S. Border Patrol led members of Congress to call for an internal review, and the United Nations to address what it called “an international issue of concern.”\n\nFinalist: Jill Rosenbaum of PBS Frontline and David Heath of The Center for Public Integrity for their collaborative entry “Dollars and Dentists.”\n\nRADIO IN-DEPTH COVERAGE\n\nRobert Wildeboer and Cate Cahan of WBEZ, Chicago Public Media receive $10,000 and the Jack R.

Howard National Collegiate Reporting Competition.\n\nThe competition, established in 1984 in cooperation with the Indiana University School of Journalism, honors the memory of the journalist who led Scripps Howard Newspapers from 1922-1953 and United Press International from 1912-1920.\n\nMike Philipps, president and CEO of the Scripps Howard Foundation, said the prize responds to the need for today’s student journalists to better understand international affairs. “Given developments in Japan following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, we are especially pleased to offer this study trip at such an historic time,” he said.\n\nThe expenses-paid trip will be led by Bradley J. Hamm, dean of the journalism school at Indiana University and a Roy W. Howard scholar, who has extensive travel experience throughout Asia. Travel begins June 17 and includes excursions primarily in the Kansai region cities of Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe, which are far outside of the earthquake and tsunami area and not affected by the subsequent tremors. Included in the trip is a visit to Hiroshima, the first city in world history to be devastated by the atomic bomb, and the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and Park.\n\n“We are honoring the legacy of Roy Howard with this reporting award because he lived a global life as a reporter and editor long before most journalism schools taught about international reporting,” said Dr. Hamm. “These young journalists will have the opportunity of a lifetime to learn about the media and culture of Japan.”\n\nThe nine winners, whose entries represent print, broadcast and online media, were chosen for the high quality of their work, an essay about their interest in international affairs and letters of recommendation.

Howard National Collegiate Reporting Competition.\n\nThe competition, established in 1984 in cooperation with the Indiana University School of Journalism, honors the memory of the journalist who led Scripps Howard Newspapers from 1922-1953 and United Press International from 1912-1920.\n\nMike Philipps, president and CEO of the Scripps Howard Foundation, said the prize responds to the need for today's student journalists to better understand international affairs, adding that of the nearly 250,000 American students who study abroad each year, only about 10 percent select a country in Asia.\n\nThe expenses-paid trip will be led by Bradley J. Hamm, dean of the journalism school at Indiana University and a Roy W. Howard scholar, who has extensive travel experience throughout Asia. Travel begins June 11 and includes excursions in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hiroshima, site of the first atomic bomb dropped on any city, where events to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II are planned for the students.\n\n\"We are honoring the legacy of Roy Howard with this reporting award because he lived a global life as a reporter and editor long before most journalism schools taught about international reporting,\" said Dr. Hamm. \"These young journalists will have the opportunity of a lifetime to learn about the media and culture of Japan.\"\n\nThe nine winners, whose entries represent print, broadcast and online media, were chosen for the high quality of their work, an essay about their interest in international affairs and letters of recommendations.
