The management of Israeli media group Yedioth Ahronoth has decided to close down its chain of 17 local newspapers, which employ 100 people, sources inform "Globes." This dramatic step comes as part of the media group's strategy to buy the group's shares held by Bank Hapoalim (TASE: POLI) before the end of the year.

The decision comes amid tough talks with the workers committee after a work dispute was declared over management's decision to lay off 130 people in the entire group including 30 people at Yedioth Media, which owns the local newspaper chain.
