As foresaid, should there be any variance between them, the provisions of the Dedicated Terms of Use for the ynet+ service shall override the provisions of these Terms of Use.\n\nThe ynet+ premium service includes additional digital content beyond the contents included on the Site, which is designated for ynet+ subscribers only, and can be viewed subject to registration and payment of a subscription fee in the Ynet application and/or on dedicated pages within the Site. Yedioth shall determine the contents in its sole discretion, and they shall include, inter alia, videos and text including investigative reports, in-depth features, personal columns and articles. Yedioth shall determine in its discretion the format in which the contents shall be presented. Some of the contents and/or their titles shall be displayed on the Site with a graphic marking, to be determined by Yedioth, indicating that they may only be viewed by subscribers. It is clarified that the volume, quality, publication frequency and subjects of, and all matters relating to the content shown in, the ynet+ application shall be determined exclusively by Yedioth, in its discretion. It is clarified for the avoidance of doubt, that Yedioth gives no undertaking regarding the amount or frequency of the aforementioned contents, and in general. Without derogating from the foregoing, it is clarified that should constraints or prevailing events so require, the number of dedicated/unique articles may be proportionally reduced during the relevant period. The contents included in the ynet+ service are protected through a DRM (digital rights management) system and/or any other security/management solution chosen by Yedioth, and therefore cannot be copied and/or transferred.

The chat rooms operate selectively from time to time, and are built on a hierarchy of permissions and executive position holders. Only Yedioth Internet and/or its representatives (operations/admin manager or room moderators), as opposed to end users, can open and close the rooms at any time. In each room one there is one moderator appointed by the ynet site system. In addition, some of the rooms shall host speakers (panelists), who shall likewise be appointed by the ynet site system. The rooms' moderators and speakers may converse freely amongst themselves, while the end users may to listen to the conversation, subject to the following permissions:\n\nNonparticipating listeners (not involved/not speaking) - are invited to listen to the conversation in the rooms. Nonparticipating listeners shall not be identified, but their presence in chat rooms shall be counted and their participation data shall be shown to all room participants.\n\nParticipating listeners - In order to participate in the conversation and/or comment with emojis, a listener must be logged into the system using the dedicated \"login\" button located next to the room name. Login does not require prior registration, but only: selection of a one-time user name (appellation) and approval of these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy (via hyperlink);\n\nParticipating listeners - In order to participate in the conversation and/or comment with emojis, a listener must be logged into the system using the dedicated \"login\" button located next to the room name. Login does not require prior registration, but only: selection of a one-time user name (appellation) and approval of these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy\n\nA participating listener who wishes to speak must request permission to do so by using the \"request permission to speak\" button, and thereby enter the queue of participating listeners who have requested permission to speak and wait until the right to speak is granted to him by the room's moderator and/or operations (admin) manager. In order to speak, the participating listener must make sure that he has active and open microphone equipment. An open/closed microphone indicator can be seen in the room interface. Permission to speak in the rooms shall be given to one participating listener at a time, and that participating listener can continue to speak as long as the moderator/operational manager continues to give him the right to do so. Please note, that if you have received permission to speak, then all the room participants (including uninvolved listeners) will be able to hear you. In some rooms the conversation may be recorded (a recording indicator can be seen in the upper left part of the room). By actually using the service as a participating listener, you hereby permit Yedioth Internet to record your words and to play them thereafter on any platform (even outside the service), such as within the framework of podcasts, etc. No undertaking is given regarding the how long the recordings may be stored in the systems of Yedioth Internet and/or of any of its representatives. The recording of chat room conversations by listeners and participating listeners and in any case its use outside the chat rooms, is prohibited. An approved participating listener shall appear on the screen with his appellation (but without a profile photo/picture).\n\nWhile it should be clarified that a participating listener does not have to disclose his details when choosing an appellation and can therefore remain anonymous, the choosing of appellations which are inappropriate and/or which do not comply with Yedioth Internet's content policy (these terms of use), as well as the flouting of that policy as specified in these Terms of Use in relation to the content and texts which he shall hear by a participating listener, may lead to his being blocked from speaking and/or altogether by the operations (admin) manager /room moderator. It should be further clarified, that in relation to participating listeners, for, inter alia, legal purposes and in order to enforce compliance with the appropriate content policy within the framework of the conversation in the room, the following information is stored in the chat rooms system: IP addresses and their activity details, such as the number of requests for permission to speak, the number of times permission to speak was received, the timing of when they began to speak, the responses (emojis) which they shared, the timing of sending the response and their blocking record.\n\nMoreover, each user can track numerical information about the listeners in each room (nonparticipating listeners, participating listeners, pending speech requests, listeners who have spoken, etc.), by clicking on the \"listeners\" button. A listener and a participating listener shall not be able to enter more than one room at the same time. should a listener and a participating listener have disconnected from a room, they may return to it as long as the room is active, although a participating listener shall be required to choose an alternative appellation. The conversation time in chat rooms may be limited, and the moderator/speakers and operations manager shall decide in their discretion when to end each conversation and/or the activity of the room. A sharing link and booking for the room can be sent to WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and email via a dedicated link located on the lower left side of the room.\n\nLinks on the Site\n\nLinks exist on the Site to various webpages (\"links\"). The links allow you to find contents published online. Most of the contents are not published by or under the auspices of Yedioth and Yedioth does not control or oversee them. The fact that the Site has links to these contents does not attest that Yedioth endorses them, nor constitute a guarantee of their reliability, currency or legality, the practices of their owners in the realm of privacy and in relation to any other aspect involved in their operation. You may find that these contents do not suit your needs, or find them objectionable, outrageous, irritating, inappropriate, illegal or immoral. Yedioth is not responsible for the contents which the links lead to, nor for any consequence resulting from their use or reliance upon them.\n\nYedioth does not guarantee the integrity of the aforementioned links, or that they shall lead you to an active website. Yedioth may remove links from the website and/or the Application that were previously included, or refrain from adding new links, and all as it shall in its absolute discretion see fit.\n\nThe yney site online search engine is managed and operated by a third party and reflects the subjective judgment of its editors and/or the algorithm underlying its operation. No binding validity shall be attributed to the search results and/or the recommendations regarding the results according to the search values that you shall enter, they should not be viewed as an objective standard for evaluating the suitability of the search results to the values which you have entered and/or to your subjective goals, the placement of the search engine on the Site as aforesaid does not amount to a recommendation to rely on the search results in one way or another, and the order of the search results in the index does not attest to the nature or importance of the search results and Yedioth has no control over the order in which they appear. The search engine algorithm, which determines the order in which the results appear, may work on the basis of commercial considerations (although results which were promoted as aforesaid will probably be marked in a way that makes this clear). Since the content and substance of websites change frequently, the search results which shall be presented to you may not be complete, accurate and/or completely up-to-date.\n\nChanging and canceling a subscription\n\nThe type of subscription may be changed through the customer service department, in reliance upon the existing user information. When changing the type of subscription, a notice regarding the change shall be sent to the subscriber's email box and/or cell phone, according to the details which he provided.\n\nA subscription to the Application and/or to the ynet+ premium service may be cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the dedicated terms of use for the service (which can be viewed in the hyperlink above)\n\nContent submitted for publication by users\n\nThe Site publishes contents which have been obtained from the Site's users. Such contents are published in designated areas, such as communities, discussion groups (forums), chat rooms, responses to articles (talkbacks), blogs and other services that allow you to upload your own content to the Site - either separately, in the area designated for the users' content only or together with contents from Yedioth's system. Submitting content for publication on the website does not grant you the right to demand that it be published or continue to be published. Yedioth encourages freedom of speech and the existence of fruitful discussion on the Site, with your active participation and that of the other users of the Sites. At the same time, in order to enable the existence of a cultured and factual discourse and to prevent abuse of the possibilities open to you to express yourself on the Site, Yedioth may (ex gratia) examine and/or monitor such content before its publication in an effort to prevent publication of hate speech, threats, expressions of vulgarity as well as contents that are ostensibly illegal without having to exercise legal discretion. It is clarified that Yedioth bears no responsibility for these contents, and the user who submitted them for publication shall be exclusively accountable for and for any consequence arising from them. These contents do not express Yedioth's opinion or position, and their publication is no guarantee of their validity, reliability, accuracy or legality.\n\nWhen sending or delivering content for publication on the website, you shall bear full and exclusive responsibility for any consequence that may result from its publication. You must ensure the legality of such content. Inter alia, and for the sake of illustration only, you are prohibited from publishing the following content on the Site:\n\nAny content which is known to be false, misleading or counterfeit;\n\nAny content that infringes or violates the proprietary rights of others - including copyrights and trademarks;\n\nAny pornographic or sexually explicit content;\n\nAny content which concerns and identifies minors, their personal details or address and ways of communicating with them;\n\nAny computer software, computer code or application which includes a computer \"virus\", including hostile software known as Trojan horses, worms, vandals, malicious applications, etc.;\n\nPasswords, usernames and other details, which facilitate the use of computer software, digital files, websites or services, which require registration or payment, without carrying out such registration or making such payment;\n\nAny content that defames a person, infringes upon his privacy, or brings him into disrepute;\n\nAny content that personally identifies other people, without them having consented to the publication of their identity;\n\nAny content the nature or subject-matter of which is vexatious, insulting, hostile, threatening or vulgar;\n\nAny content that exhibits or encourages racism, or improper discrimination based on race, extraction, skin color, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, occupation, sexual orientation, disease, physical or mental disability, belief, political opinion, or socio-economic status.\n\nAny content which encourages the commission of a criminal offense or may constitute the basis for a lawsuit or civil liability;\n\nAny content that may mislead consumers;\n\nAny content of an advertising or commercial nature;\n\nAny content which is at variance with the standard rules for using the Internet or which may cause damage or harm to Internet users in general, and to users of the Site or the Application in particular;\n\nAny content access to which is blocked by a password, etc., and is not freely available to all Internet users;\n\nYedioth may refuse to publish, or delete forthwith, any content which you submitted for publication, any time it finds that you have violated these Terms of Use or that you have committed an act or omission that harms or may harm the services provided on the Site, its users, Yedioth or any of its representatives. Yedioth shall likewise be entitled in such a case to prevent you from publishing additional content on the Site. The provisions of this paragraph supplement Yedioth's statutory rights. Should Yedioth decide, in its sole discretion, to publish content which you have submitted - it may edit and change any such content as it shall in its absolute discretion see fit, including by shortening it. Content submitted by you for publication on the Site shall be exposed to all Internet users. Act prudently and carefully when giving personal details (such as an address or phone number) as well as in the responses and in relation to inquiries which you shall receive as a result of using the Site or publishing any of your details. Remember: you must exercise at least the same degree of caution when submitting content and responding to inquiries sent to you online as you would when communicating offline. Yedioth encourages you to treat content published online carefully and critically, including content published by users on the Site and in the Application. Treat such content cautiously and meticulously. This content is not published on behalf of Yedioth, and it is therefore not responsible for its reliability, authenticity, accuracy or integrity and is not responsible for any consequence that may result from using or relying on it. Always remember that such content is not a substitute for consultation with appropriate professionals, such as lawyers, doctors, qualified specialists, etc., where such consultation is required.\n\nDirect mailing\n\nWhen joining and registering for the Application and/or ynet+, you shall be asked to provide an e-mail address that will be used by Yedioth for the purpose of sending messages and updates, as well as invoices.

Yedioth does not write, check, verify or edit the content or veracity of these publications. The advertisers bear sole responsibility for the commercial content and for any consequence resulting from its use or reliance thereon. Publication of commercial content on the Site and/or in the Application does not constitute a recommendation or encouragement to purchase the services, assets or products being offered for sale therein.\n\nAny transaction made as a result of commercial content published on the Site and/or in the Application shall be concluded directly between yourself and the advertiser concerned. Yedioth is not a party to any such transaction, and shall not be held responsible for the services and goods offered in the commercial content of or purchased through the Site and/or the Application or purchased through them.\n\nMarketing content is also published on the Site from time to time, the production of which is done with the financial participation/sponsorship of a commercial or other entity (such as a nonprofit organization, etc.) but which is written and published after journalistic editing, on various topics of public interest. Promotion of such content from the home page of the Site is generally done through different (visibility) contracts, along with the letter S symbol which makes it clear that the marketing content in question was produced with financial participation. When holding the mouse cursor (tapping on the smartphone) on top of the symbol an explanatory note appears: \"Content in collaboration with\" - the name of the commercial entity. The article was produced by Ynet's commercial department with the financial participation of an external entity and was published after journalistic editing.\"\n\nThe inscription: in collaboration with the sponsor, shall appear in the introduction near the subtitle and at the end of the substantive marketing content.\n\nTagging including appropriate full disclosure as aforesaid shall also accompany marketing videos and podcasts distributed by ynet through external platforms, such as social networks.\n\nWithout derogating from the provisions of these terms of use and the Privacy Policy, it is clarified that commercial entities as aforesaid may invite you within the framework of such publications (for example, through an interface for collecting 'leads'), to register in order to receive information about and/or purchase their services and/or products.

This provision equally applies to any processing, editing or translation by Yedioth of content entered or submitted by you in or to the Sites. Should consent be given as aforesaid, you must refrain from removing, erasing or disrupting any notice or symbol regarding intellectual property rights, for example - the © copyright mark, or the ® trademark, accompanying the contents which you shall utilize. The trademarks and advertisements of advertisers and/or third parties published on the Site belong exclusively to them and no use may be made of them either, without the advertiser's prior written consent. While Yedioth does not claim ownership of the content provided by the browsers for publication on ynet sites, submission of content intended for publication on ynet sites constitutes confirmation that the party submitting it owns all the rights therein and is at liberty to submit it for publication. If the party submitting the content for publication did not create it or is not the proprietor of the rights therein, submission of the content constitutes confirmation that it was submitted pursuant to a lawful authorization from the proprietor, permitting the content's submission for publication on ynet sites and granting rights to use and publish it as detailed above and hereinafter. Submission of the content for publication grants Yedioth a free, worldwide and perennial license to copy, reproduce, distribute, market, publicize, process, edit, translate and use it in such additional way as it shall in its discretion see fit, on the ynet sites and/or in the Application and in printed matter, including in newspapers, magazines, periodicals, books, etc., in digital media, including other websites, in digital archives and in services provided by wired, wireless, cellular, cable, satellite and other communication networks.\n\nYedioth's responsibility\n\nThe contents of the ynet site and/or the Application are provided for use as they are (AS IS) and cannot be customized to suit the needs of each and every person. The user shall make no complaint, claim or demand against Yedioth and/or any of its representatives regarding the attributes of the contents, their capabilities, limitations and suitability to his individual needs and/or the responses (if any) provoked by their publication on the Site and/or in the Application.\n\nThe user shall be fully and exclusively responsible for the use made by him of the Site and the Application.\n\nYedioth does not guarantee that content published by and/or on behalf of browsers on ynet websites shall elicit a response. Since it cannot know what responses (if any) shall be received as a result of such publication, who shall respond to the content published by the user and in what manner, Yedioth shall bear no responsibility towards the user (or anyone acting on his behalf) for these responses, the identities of those contacting him or any consequence that may result from the publication. Yedioth shall likewise bear no responsibility for any use made by a third party of content published by and/or on behalf of the user.\n\nThe user shall be fully and exclusively responsible for any decision which he makes regarding the contents published on the Site and/or in the Application. Yedioth does not guarantee that the contents and services of third parties, including those of content and service providers and of users, which are published on the Site and/or in the Application, shall be complete, correct, lawful, accurate or coincide with the user's expectations or requirements. Yedioth shall bear no responsibility for any consequence resulting from or from relying upon them.\n\nIt should be emphasized that correct professional advice depends on the exact facts of each and every case. The contents of the Site and/or the Application do not constitute a substitute for such advice. The foregoing also holds true vis-à-vis contents published in communities, responses and in various kinds of discussion groups (forums), including content published on behalf of the community and discussion group administrators. These contents are no substitute for professional advice or action when required (for example: a medical expert's answer to a question in a discussion group is not a substitute for receiving medical advice or treatment as needed). Sometimes these contents reflect a particular personal approach or opinion of the writer and should therefore be treated with due caution. The user is fully and exclusively responsible for the decision whether to rely upon or act regarding contents published on the Site and/or in the Application, and he is solely responsible for any such action and/or its consequences as aforesaid.\n\nYedioth does not guarantee that the services offered in the Site and/or application shall not be disrupted, shall be provided systematically or without stoppages, shall operate securely and faultlessly, and shall be immune from unauthorized access to Yedioth's computers and/or servers or from damages, malfunctions, glitches or failures - and all in relation to Yedioth's or one of its supplier's hardware, software, communication lines or systems.\n\nIndemnification\n\nThe user shall be obliged to indemnify Yedioth, its employees, managers or representatives against any damage, loss, loss of profit, payment or expense which they shall incur or sustain - including attorney's fees and litigation costs - due to a breach of these Terms of Use, as well as in the following cases:\n\nWith respect to any complaint, claim and/or demand which shall be made against them by any third party as a result of content which the user submitted for publication on the Site or in the Application and/or as a result of links made by the user to the Site or the Application, and/or any judgment and/or administrative and/or judicial decision compelling Yedioth and/or anyone acting under its auspices to pay compensation as a result of publication of content that was submitted by the user for publication and/or the links which were created by him as aforesaid.\n\nWith respect to any judgment, and/or conviction, and/or administrative and/or judicial and/or quasi-judicial decision which shall oblige Yedioth and/or any of its representatives to incur a penalty and/or pay compensation as a result of a breach of the terms of use of this agreement by the user and/or by anyone acting on his behalf.\n\nChanges to the Site and the Application and termination of the service\n\nYedioth may change from time to time the structure, appearance and design of the website and/or the Application and the scope and availability of the services offered therein, may in its discretion charge a fee for such contents and services or for others, and may change any other aspect involved in the website and the Application - and all, without having to give prior notice. Such changes shall be made, having regard, inter alia, to the dynamic nature of and the technological and other changes taking place in the Internet, in the Applications field, including version updates and/or in the various operating systems. By their nature, changes of this type may be susceptible to malfunctions and/or cause initial inconvenience, etc. The user shall make no complaint, claim, and/or demand against Yedioth with respect to the making of such changes and/or the concomitant glitches accompanying their implementation. Without derogating from the foregoing, Yedioth may terminate provision of all or some of these services, at any time. Yedioth shall publish an announcement regarding the termination of the services on the relevant website a reasonable time in advance. Upon termination of the services, Yedioth will retain the material contained in the Site and/or in the Application for an additional reasonable period, upon the expiry of which it may delete that material without having to give an additional notice in this regard or making a backup thereof.\n\nAmendments to the Terms of Use\n\nYedioth reserves its right to amend, at any time and even without prior notice, the Terms of Use of the Site and/or the Application, and unless Yedioth shall in its sole discretion determine otherwise, such amendments shall take effect immediately upon their incorporation into these terms of use. It is recommended to review these terms of use from time to time.\n\nJurisdiction\n\nThis agreement shall be regulated exclusively by the laws of the State of Israel, with the exception of the international choice of law rules stipulated therein. The courts in the Tel-Aviv district shall have exclusive jurisdiction regarding the adjudication of any dispute arising from the use of or relating to the Site or the Application. A ruling by a competent court (including a specialized court or other judicial tribunal) that a provision of these terms of use is illegal and/or invalid shall not nullify and invalidate the other provisions of the Terms of Use, with the exception of the provision that was abrogated and/or circumscribed by the court as aforesaid.\n\nContact us\n\nYedioth meticulously observes statutory requirements and respects the right of the Sites' users and others to privacy and good name.
