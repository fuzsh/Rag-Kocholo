        "text": "(laughter)\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly. Humor over rumor.\n\nInterviewer\n\nPerfect.\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nExactly.\n\nAbby Lee\n\nNo comment on domestic politics.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. And you are a journalist, so you get to use the F word, but we never use the F word. We never say fake news in Taiwan. We say FIMI or Foreign Information Manipulation Interference, F-I-M-I. It's the same word that the European Union uses.\n\nInterviewer\n\nF-I-M-I. FIMI, it's nice.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, because especially in Mandarin in Taiwan, if we translate fake news, sometimes it translates to the news that the politicians don't like. And that's not a good posture with journalists.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's much gentler.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. And also, journalists, I think… journalism really is the perfect antidote against FIMI. Journalism to FIMI is like epidemiology to coronavirus. So, I hold journalists to very high esteem. Both of my parents are journalists.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOh.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, we use the word FIMI because a domestic journalist can never be FIMI, right, by definition. And if you say fake news, it confuses the two.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, if you use the fake news, the two words, it's going to be misunderstood sometimes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOr you blame someone…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. And we never blame the journalism, right? So, when we say FIMI, it means specifically foreign information manipulation and interference. And it may not be fake, right? It could just be they hacked into a signboard and post a message there. And the message may not be fake. It may be a real message, but it shouldn't appear here.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, it depends on which side you look at the scope. If we take the journalist, and I say something in the media, and then you read it and you say, wait a minute, it's not like this. You will not say fake news?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNo, I will never say that.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYou will say FIMI…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNo, no, no. I will not say anything like accusing the journalist.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOkay, so how do you...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWe will just provide clarifications. And the clarification will come, as you said, within two hours, 200 words, two pictures. But it's a clarification. It's only when there's a foreign cyber-attack, a foreign information manipulation, we would say that's FIMI.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut in this period, in this reality, that every minute we can see this in government, in the United States, with the story with Trump, with Bibi, it's a lot of examples I can give you. You have to take big department to take care about the...\n\nInterviewer\n\nTell me, you write in your journal for 40 years. When you write 10 years before, we believe you. Now, we don't know what is fake news and what is not. What to believe and what...\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's something political.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. I think it's the polarization that is the main difference compared to even 10 years ago, because on many online platforms, polarization sells more advertisement. Polarization delivers more clicks and people become addicted to polarization. And that's the main problem.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, we are like victims?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nOr I would say \"users\", right? There's some other industry also has users. The industry that sells addiction, of course.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIf I understood you well, if you look for the side of the clients that read the newspaper, the readers, you can say these words that I can read it like this. What you read, it's good being in business, the titles, the stories, but not to use the words, \"fake news\". Be careful. Don’t believe in everything, trust yourself to think if there is something not so correct or…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThere is that. What you're talking about is literacy or critical thinking. That's what you're talking about But in Taiwan, I was part of the basic education curriculum committee before joining the cabinet. Our new curriculum, new as of 2019, we took out all the words literacy. So, no media literacy, digital literacy, data literacy, no. We replaced that with competence. So, media competence, digital competence.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThe difference is that literacy is when you're consuming the information. With critical thinking, maybe, but still a consumer. But competence is when you're a producer of information, when you make information. So, the idea is that every junior high school student should be free to fact check the three presidential candidates as they're having a platform debate. And if they find a mistake that a candidate said, maybe the student’s name appear on national television live stream. So, we need to-\n\nInterviewer\n\nIf they found a mistake, they can-\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThey can report it to the collaborative fact checking community.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThis is the platform V…(?)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNo, this is called Cofacts. It's also a g0v or GovZero initiative. But Cofacts is entirely in the social sector. It's civil society. It's not government run. It's not government funded. But they are the Cofacts people, like Wikipedia, but instead of editing articles, they edit fact checks.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd we found it's not the fact check reports that protects the mind against polarization. It's a process of going through fact checking that inoculates a mind against polarization. So, if all the students can get the experience, like a journalist do, right? Checking the sources, checking the biases, making sure they're two uncorrelated sources before saying something really happened and so on. If they go through this basic journalism one-on-one training, then they become immune or inoculated against polarization.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow. Very interesting. I read that you have… You made the v- How do you call this?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nvTaiwan?\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIn 2014. Yes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWhich year it was?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n2014... So, almost 10 years ago now.\n\nInterviewer\n\nAnd what is the major… main purpose behind this?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSure. Yes. The idea of V-Taiwan is that for emerging technologies like Uber, the technology changes so fast that the normal democratic channels are very slow in comparison. A vote, for example, is once every four years in Taiwan. Of course, more in Israel.\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nAsk Bibi. He's a champion.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. So once every four years in Taiwan. And every time you vote, even after we have referendum, it's once every two years, right? So, referendum, election, referendum, election. But even if it's once a year, let's be generous, still for every citizen, it's until one year later can they deliver meaningful input. But within one year, Uber will have changed many times its business models and so on.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, the idea is that the bandwidth of democracy, how much you can express, and the latency of democracy, how long to wait until you can next voice your opinion, need to improve as the emerging technologies. So, like in the Uber case, we ask all the taxi drivers, all the Uber drivers, their passengers and so on, to voice their opinion, but not just typing their statement. They also press like or unlike for other people's statements. But there is no reply button. So, there's no way for people to make personal attacks. Just their ideas, feelings and reflection.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt exists in other countries, I don't think.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, it's been used in other countries as well. But I think Taiwan is the first one that uses it on a national scale.\n\nInterviewer\n\nNational.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's used for town halls in Bowling Green in Kentucky. In many places, if you check Pol.is website, you will see. But mostly, they are for municipalities or districts and so on. And we take those small-scale technology and make it national, so that everybody can chime in.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd very quickly, we saw on the Uber conversation, that everybody actually agreed on most of the points. There's just one that people don't agree. Whether to call it sharing economy, or geek or extractive economy, that's different ideologies. But actually, everybody agrees there should be insurance, there should be registration, they should undercut existing meters, but surge pricing is fine and so on.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, when people learn that everyone across the party aisles actually do agree on these things…\n\nInterviewer\n\nThis is democracy.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, this is democracy. And we invite Uber and taxi union on the table and say, look, the people want you to work together like this, do you want to commit to it? And they say yes. So, Uber has been for years now a legal Taiwanese taxi fleet, because we changed our taxi law to allow for surge pricing.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, according to the reality in Israel, probably you know the political issue, about the left and the right attitude of the people, every Saturday in this area it's closed because there is a lot of people in the street that say no to what happened.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIf we take this instrument to our democracy in Israel, do you think this is going to be much more polite for people to listen to each other, to respect each other when someone thinks like this, and others think like this, but not all the shouting and all the mess that we know for the last couple of months. Do you think this is going to be good in Israel?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIn our experience, if we talk about abstract things, like sharing economy, gig economy, then this tool does not work. This tool only works when you talk about the specific case, for example, somebody with a driver's license but not professional driver's license, picking up strangers, they meet on an app, on the way to work, charging them to it… like you need to have a specific story that people can relate to. And then ask people how do you feel about it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWe have since the vTaiwan project, brought vTaiwan into the cabinet, and run similar processes in the joint platform. The difference is vTaiwan is g0v, is civil society led, and Join is government led. And on the Join platform, we talk about even more things than emerging technologies. For example, we talk about the right for unmarried women, to the benefits for her child, and that was before we legalized marriage equality. So, it also carries to lesbian couples, for example.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, this is interesting, the family of the couples, when it's a marriage of gays or lesbians, they are not involved of the marriage, it's separate.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, so as I said, we chose specific examples within the marriage equality case. So, we didn't talk about the definition of marriage, that would never work. But we talk about the welfare and the rights of the child that's not yet born, right? So, we will all think about the child, and that makes it much easier for people to join together.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's relaxed.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, it's relaxed.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n24?\n\nInterviewer\n\nYour age, 24.\n\n(laughter)\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nTransgender?\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's perfect.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nMy dad's parents, my paternal grandma and grandpa, are both Catholic. They are very devout Catholic people. And my grandparents helped raise me because my parents are journalists, very busy journalists. So, my grandparents raised me.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBoth of the parents, also the mother?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, my mother is a very well-known journalist.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIn Taiwan?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nMaybe give us the name and we give her respect. What are the names of your parents?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, my father is Tang Guanghua.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYou give me the name, right? I will not make a mistake.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWell, it's on my Wikipedia page, so just look it up.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI will make a mistake if I look it up. You are spelling it out, also the mother. I have to tell the truth, I am the daughter of a very, very special and famous journalist.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI see.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIn Israel and also in Europe. Noah Klieger is his name. He's not with us anymore. He died four years ago; he was 93. He's very, very nice. I spoke with Abby about the story about the Holocaust and that's one of the questions that I want to ask on this article that we made with you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nHolocaust for Jewish, for Israel, it's one of the most important historic sites. It's one of our, you know, during our life, we together made stories with the survivors every year on Holocaust Day. It's going to be, you know, it's finished. They are old, they are going to disappear. And the witnesses, the witnesses that went through the Holocaust, they are going to, how can I say it, they have died almost.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThey are walking out.\n\nInterviewer\n\nAnd books of history and Iran for the other side that ignored that there was, they were not Holocaust. I spoke a little bit with Abby about Taiwan attitude and I was so happy to hear that in school, there is in history lessons, in books, there is a part that spoke about Holocaust, about the murder of six million Jewish…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nDefinitely.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's so important and now it's connected to your job. Because when there is a story against Holocaust, against Jewish, antisemitic issues, when the media, the Instagram, the Facebook, the Twitter, all what we need, what we have now… I will not use the words in the article fake news because you are not using it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYou are a journalist, so you get to use it.\n\nInterviewer\n\nFor me, I can use it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThank you.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt takes a journalist to say something is fake news.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut then you fix me and it has nothing to do with me. I'm a good student. I learned a new thing.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, but we are the government officials. Once we start saying this news is fake or not fake, it becomes interference from the public sector against journalism. This is something we never do in Taiwan because it's a slippery slope.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThe next thing would be the ministers wanting to force journalists to change headlines and we don't want to go there.\n\nPhotographer\n\nIt's very important. They are asking us to hear this because in Israel, it's the opposite, the other way around. They are blaming and they are chatting journalists and blaming journalists with fake news.\n\nPhotographer\n\nAnd, it's exactly what you say because in the beginning it's fake news and then they want to shut down the...\n\nInterviewer\n\nTo take out the titles… Our job... I feel that every day I'm going to prison because when I say something, maybe immediately they will say it's fake news, we don't check, I don't check and I don’t do research. But it depends how forces, like what she said, will take it to the opposite and to say it's not real, when it's real.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, what I mean in this reality in the world, what we have in Ukraine, in Russia, in America, in Israel, how do I know at the end of the day that your people in Taiwan got the real message, the real reality, that when they see in the TV...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. We don't have an anti-vax political faction. Everybody got vaccinated.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut when you have in the media, texting like this or photo imaging, and... pictures… in Gaza. A child in Gaza that the army killed him when he was 2 or 3 years. And this is the article, but this is not the real story.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThe real story for this example is that this child was around the bomb, a very big bomb, that the terrorists used this child against Israel to send this bomb. So, when you see this fake... It's not fake news. This is the reality. But when we got it from the media around the world...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's a different frame.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a different frame. They make the Israelis, the army kill children. This is not right. The army, the name is Tzahal. It's the army to protect. To protect, not to fight. This is the word when you translate. We are not attack. We are protect. And if we don't be focused for your job, when you say immediately, 2 hours maximum, when there is something like this...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. 200 words, 2 pictures to clarify, to add back context.\n\nInterviewer\n\nExactly. So that's what you do in your agenda? Because that's what I feel when I read a lot of things and text with you. That's my impression. It's amazing.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. That was established, I think, around 2018-2019. When I was at the time minister without portfolio. And we worked together with the spokesperson at the time and another minister without portfolio on this principle and implementing it.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNow, of course, I'm a cabinet minister now with my portfolio at the ministry. But all the ministries, including ours, still follow the same protocol that we established in 2018-2019.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThank you. Interesting. Can you explain? It's very good. When she asks, this is the readers. If she doesn't understand something, it's very good that she asks.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYour job, for all the head, the head that you control, it's to avoid this example… Or maybe you explain what is your...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nMy current job.\n\nInterviewer\n\nAll the corners.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, I will first go back to 2019, when we were having the discussion in the cabinet. There are people...\n\nInterviewer\n\nBefore the corona.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBefore the corona, yes. And there were, at the time, people, academic people, politicians, that advocate for a notice and take down but we did not choose that option. We chose instead notice and public notice. So, we never take down journalist work but we always add context. So, for example, for you, it's maybe WhatsApp, right? Or Signal. For us, it's usually Line. But it's the same thing. It's the instant messenger.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nMany people, as you said, because their phone has a very small screen, so they just look at one picture and two lines of text. The frame is done. So, even though those two lines of text are not untrue, they're misleading.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThis has a lot of influence.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nRight. So, the work of the g0v, the Cofacts people basically said, you can invite a robot to your chat channel. And the robot comes from maybe the leading antivirus company, maybe the leading antivirus game.\n\nInterviewer\n\nLike bots.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd the bot will look at the message and seek for clarification or context. So, if there's already clarification, the minute you share this, the bot will say, by the way, here is the full story. And Twitter also took that.\n\nPhotographer\n\nBut who are you serving? The people? The government? Both?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. So, it's an ecosystem. The LINE company agreed to provide a flag button. So just like your email, you will have a button that says flag as spam. If you flag that email as spam, it sends a signal to spam house and warn every other Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail, that the next time this person sends something that looks the same, put it into junk mail. Don't put it into the inbox.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, the same system here. LINE lets any user flag something as probably scam or spam. And once you flag it as possibly scam or spam, LINE provides a dashboard. So, you can see which things are going viral based on voluntary report of the people. And so, you can see, for example, some story that is misleading has a basic reproduction number very high, like Omicron. And you can see something that is self-limiting.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd so, the fact checkers and the community can focus their energy on the things that are going viral, but not focus their energy on things that are not going viral anyway. And so, for those going viral stories, it's like contact tracing. They trace the sources, they make sure there's a context, and so on. And then the community provides.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd as of this year, the community also uses GPT-4. So GPT-4 will first do a critical reading of the analysis. And so, with AI and the community, there's evidences for clarification. And the professional journalists on the Taiwan Fact Checking Center, part of the International Fact Checking Network, look at the crowd evidences.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's not just on the digital texting, it's also on the print?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. So, the journalists working at the Taiwan Fact Checking Center, again, independent, not government-run, then issue their full clarification report, and say the story was misleading or false and things like that. And then Facebook and other messaging ecosystem take the fact-checked reports in and display this notice. So, you can still share the story, but you cannot take away the notice. This is like the Twitter community notes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt’s friendly It's much more friendly than to get the vaccination without asking nothing and without checking the facts. You know, you speak, and my mind says, but Israel, we know that our country is famous with the technology, the high tech, the cyber.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, with the best startups.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, is it right that Taiwan, with the connection that we have with the country, is a good connection because of you?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBecause of our perfect ambassador. I said that on record.\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nWe need also a picture with Abby, by the way, I forgot to tell you… We have also, it's okay, we have a picture.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSuddenly it's about you. Would you like to be part of it?\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nShe is the host, but it's hospitality here, so we have to keep her.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, she is the host.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, what I mean, when you have the connection with the Israelis, the relationship between the countries, you give a lot of fame, information now that we're adopting Israel, I think, because we're the biggest newspaper in Israel. So, when I publish this, it's going to be, wow, huge.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBig news.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBig news, and it's going to be like a rally, because when I publish this, and you say this, and you're important people for us, that you come and give us this statement, one year from now I will sign you, that we will see this, that we adopt some of the things, the tools that you use in your country.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut what I want to ask you, if there are tools from Israel you already adopt, or when you come here to visit, if there is kind of a vision of this.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, it's a win-win…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, we just before this interview visited a great Israeli startup.\n\nInterviewer\n\nPerfect! Can I write it?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's just upstairs.\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nIs it the same building?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, they're neighbors.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOkay.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThey're called Chain Reaction.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's nice.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo easy and simple?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer\n\nOkay, nice.\n\nInterviewer\n\nInterviewer: And brothers?\n\nInterviewer\n\nHow many languages?!\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n20.\n\nInterviewer\n\n20?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNational languages.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow!\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt's not just Mandarin, you know.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI thought in France there were 10 different... It's French, but it's a different accent.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, my grandma spoke Daiyu to me when I was a child.\n\nInterviewer\n\nWow. How many do you know?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWell, nowadays, maybe just JavaScript.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI think in English now.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYou think, you dream in English also.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI dream in JavaScript.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBut my point is that if I see a petition from a Pacific Island community, or a couple of months ago, from the immigrant workers in offshore fishing boats, they also want Wi-Fi, of course, and come to ask me about satellite and so on. So, any time I feel I cannot understand what they're saying, I always think it's my problem, it's not their problem.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a different attitude.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nGo there, stay with them.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt is your problem now. You take the responsibility.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, I go there and stay with them and mingle with them until I can see the world from their perspective. So, that's what taking oversights means.\n\nInterviewer\n\nI don't know if it was in the question, because I don't know if you know a little bit about...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWe ignore that anyway. Just ask whatever.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThere is in the government now, because this is the right in the government, there are people there… There are a lot of religious ministers in our government, and one of the big problems is that the religious are very fanatic. The religious are against the lesbian and gay, and all the world... It's terrible.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut what I want to ask you, on this attitude that you say that you listen to all the people, the different minds, and thinking, this is good to adapt, first of all, even if they are so catholic.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, my grandma is catholic. We talked for hours.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a passion. What is the tip that you can give us that the people will be much friendly to each other, and even if they think in the Bible it's written, this is against the Bible, against what God wants. This is their belief. We cannot judge them, but they are not respecting our...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. My grandma is almost 90 years old now. But I still visit her, or at least video conference her, every week. And back in 2018, she would tell me...\n\nInterviewer\n\nShe lived far away from you?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNot very far. Maybe about an hour's drive. But I video conference when I'm on the airplane, or in Tel Aviv.\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nShow her the nice guys in the beach.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI will actually video conference my parents, and also my grandma, on my flight back to Taiwan. So, we'll see how the satellite connection works.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThat's good.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, during the video calls or visits, she would tell me, my grandma would tell me that, back in 2018, referendum about marriage equality, she would say that her church friends tell her this and that. But she understands I have my perspective.\n\nInterviewer\n\nTo respect your...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, so we went back and forth many times. And I think they eventually understood that both the people who were fighting for the rights, and the church friends of her, they both care deeply about family, about a stable relationship. So, actually they have more in common than the other people who don't care about family.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, they are actually neighbors, in the ideas place. So, I think the point is that we need to keep building bridges, keep communicating. And this is what Be Taiwan and POTUS is about. It's about giving a voice to the bridge builders. This is like the contact tracing, right?\n\nInterviewer\n\nNot too afraid to make the voice…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nTo make the voice of the bridge builders heard. Because during the contact tracing, there are many people very loud about privacy. Many people very loud about public health, but we need to give extra voice to the bridge builders that says, oh, we can have both.\n\nInterviewer\n\nFantastic. Thank you so much.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThank you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo interesting. I think about what happened now with the treatment that we have from Iran. Not just Israel, all the world, I think. What is your attitude when we have the cyber-attacks, also the digital, the banks… not just in newspaper, the banks, the security office, the academic, the institute of hospitals? What are the tools that you think in the digital…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. If we collect too much personal data in the same place, imagine if instead of the SMS contact tracing, imagine if all the venues are required to report to the same state database, every visit, every phone number. Then that becomes very attractive to cyber criminals. You just hack into that computer and you know everybody everywhere at once.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's like in a movies…\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nBut because we choose the way to decentralize, to give the privacy in the contact tracing, there's no such hotspots for the hackers, the militia hackers to enter. Now the same applies to all the information collection points, if you overly aggregate private data, there's always a risk of cyber-attack.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd startups like Chain Reaction, their main contribution is to make sure that they only aggregate encrypted data. Even if the hacker, the bad hacker, gets into the data center of a hospital, for example, all they get is encrypted data and they cannot do anything with it. It's like a random number that I just said. So, we need to apply those privacy-enhancing technologies to make sure that when the criminals break into a system, there's very limited or zero damage that they can harm. This is my main agenda.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's also, if I take the tourist department, if I see pictures about places in Taiwan and hostels and restaurants, what is going to be not fake news when I arrive to the hotel and I find, “oh, it's ugly, it's dirty, it's not like in the picture.” How you can take this example that it's also in your cover image, that when we got the information here in Israel, and one of my departments is to publish tourism, to encourage tourism to go from here to Taiwan, I do it also. So, it's very important to me to understand when I'm collecting the database, to find with booking, with all the links that I got, if I can trust it, or there is a lot of problems.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly. And you're talking about aggregated information, that's statistics, evidence for your reporting. But you probably do not need the registration detail of each guest to a hotel, right?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nSo, the point here is to make very clear the delineation between personal data, private data on one side, and non-personal data on the other side. In many digital systems, these two mixes together, so you would say that, “oh, we've de-identified, we've removed sensitive information,” but it turns out from the periphery of those data, you can reassemble who there is.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd if you do that too much and re-identify, then, you know, like a journalist who accidentally reveals her sources, then if you do that for a while, you cannot practice as a journalist anymore because no source will trust you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYeah, nobody trusts me anymore.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly. So, you need to keep the trust. This is the value of your work, right?\n\nInterviewer\n\nExactly. So, the same for the... Especially this year, you know, because we have so many details and so many forces to take, to collect. But if you make a mistake in this and you base it on something that cheats you, and it's again fake news or fake details that they give to the readers, so nobody wants to read anymore.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nExactly.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThey don't trust me anymore.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah. So, the same for our statistics department and audit departments. Our main idea here is to make sure that we publish data that can be analyzed independently, but with no sacrifice to the privacy of the sources.\n\nInterviewer\n\nYeah, exactly. We are almost finished.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThat's okay. I can do this for days.\n\n(laughter)\n\nInterviewer\n\nI think the time is much more than you give me. You're so interesting.\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt's a hard one. I need you for... You are now age 20?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\n42.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nNo.\n\nInterviewer\n\nSo, what are you going to tell me 5 years from now? Where are you going to be? In the same job? You're going to be the prime minister of Taiwan? What are your dreams?\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, I will keep building bridges. 7 years ago, when I first became a cabinet minister without portfolio, there was an HR forum. And on the gender field, I feel in ‘Wu’, or not applicable, like none. And in the party field, also, none. So, I'm non-affiliated or non-binary when it comes to gender, or party, or ethnic group, or whatever. So, basically non-binary in everything.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nAnd I think 5 years from now, this politics of building bridges, of what I call plurality, building collaboration across diversity, I think will become much more mainstream. It will become an acceptable, or even preferred, political attitude, not just in Taiwan, but in all the liberal democracies.\n\nInterviewer\n\nBut, in this process, could you imagine that because of the bot got inside our life, so much less people will have work, because the computers, the bot, take care of everything inside. So, what are we going to be? We don't have a job, the mind of us will be with the robot. How is it going to be? Because it's already happened.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nWell, automation, to me, I call it assistive intelligence. It's just assisting us, right? It's like this assistive technology I'm wearing, it's my eyeglass. My eyeglass is, to me, a perfect example of assistive technology, because it's very transparent.\n\nInterviewer\n\nVery nice one.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nIt just helps me to see you better. It's not pushing advertisement to my retina. It would not be an eyeglass if it just...\n\nInterviewer\n\nIt doesn't have a political...\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, it doesn't have a political agenda.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes, and if it has bias, meaning that if it's skewered or somehow broken, I can repair it with super glue, I actually did. [laughter]\n\nInterviewer\n\nOr send it to a fixer.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYeah, I'll send it to a fixer down the road, and they don't have to sign an NDA, they don't have to pay fines for reverse engineering.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThis is a very good example, to use it like a tool for what it needs to be. Very simple.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nYes. So, all AI need to be assistive intelligence, and we should reject the kind of AI that's authoritarian, instead of assistive.\n\nInterviewer\n\nNice. Thank you so much.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nThank you.\n\nInterviewer\n\nReally, it's a pleasure to be here with you. If there is... To be on the safe side, because I didn't write everything because I just like the conversation.\n\nAudrey Tang\n\nI can send you the transcript.\n\nInterviewer\n\nThank you so much."
