        "text": "A step up in the fight between Yedioth Ahronoth and Israel today: Yedioth Ahronoth's management yesterday evening ordered all its employees not to participate in the Haifa media conference. The reason: Aharon Lapidot, deputy editor of Israel Hayom, takes part in one of the panels at the conference.\n\nIn the various panels of the conference, which will be held this Thursday at the University of Haifa, four representatives of Yediot Communications were supposed to participate: Ariana Melamed from ynet, Lior El Hai, head of the Yediot system in Haifa and the North, Shuli Zoertz from the local Yediot Hamfaretz and Sharon Rufa Ofir, the reporter for the weekly \"Laishah\".\n\nA day before the conference, after the conference program was printed and widely distributed to its participants, Yedioth Ahronoth representatives informed the conference organizers that they were forbidden to take part in the sessions themselves due to \"orders from above\".\n\nHaifa conference for communication It is the product of an initiative of the Haifa and the North Press Room and will discuss issues concerning the coverage of the periphery, the future of the local media, poor coverage of the various sectors (Orthedim, Arabs, new immigrants) and the rights of journalists. Hundreds of media persons from all over the country are expected to participate in it, including: Moti Kirshenbaum, Yaakov Achimair and Chaim Yavin who will present a lifetime achievement award to journalist Amos Carmeli, Shai Golden and Tali Metz from Channel 2, Zuhair Bahlul, Danny Nishalis, Shai Golden and Tali Metz from Channel 2, MK Panina Tamano Sheta, football commentator Avi Namani, national team coach Eli Gutman, Izzy Sharetzky from Kiryat Shmona football owners and many more.\n\nNow, with a last minute warning, the heads of the conference are forced to find replacements for Yediot Communications personnel who were forced to cancel their participation.\n\nThe chairman of the Haifa Correspondent's Chamber, Eliran Tal, from the organizers of the conference: \"It is a shame that Yedioth Ahronoth's directors chose to continue the wars of the Jews with Israel today precisely on the backs of journalists from Haifa and the North who initiated this conference and raised this huge project with zero budget but with many good intentions. It is puzzling to me why your decision is sweeping, even for panels in which workers from Israel do not participate today. In any case, the conference will take place as planned and we will leave empty chairs on the stage next to the names of the journalists who were forced to boycott the conference.\n\nThis is how we illustrate the stupidity and childishness of this unfortunate decision. \"\n\nBy: Eliran Tal"
