        "text": "By Palestine Chronicle Staff\n\n“We, who came from the field, know very well that the situation is still far from victory,” the officers said.\n\nDozens of Israeli reserve officers said in a letter on Sunday that the Israeli army remains “far from victory” in Gaza despite Tel Aviv’s ongoing genocidal war on the Strip, Israeli media reported.\n\nThe letter, signed by over 70 officers, was addressed to Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. It reportedly expressed surprise at recent claims by senior army officials that victory is near and that it may be time to transition to pinpoint raids.\n\n“The public sees the bombings and targeted assassinations and thinks this is how a war should be fought,” the officers said adding:\n\n“It is important to us that the public knows that this is not how wars are won, wars are won on foot. You conquer territory, cleanse it, hold it, and move on to the next target.”\n\n“We, who came from the field, know very well that the situation is still far from victory,” the officers added, pointing out that Palestinian Resistance groups continue to have cross-border capabilities, including UAVs, explosive drones, and mortars.\n\nAmbushes Everywhere – Resistance Roundup – Day 309\n\n“This is not what victory looks like!” they reportedly asserted.\n\nBack in February, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC News that “victory is within reach.”\n\nAccording to Israeli media, at least 10,000 Israeli soldiers have been killed and injured since the war in Gaza began on October 7.\n\nOngoing Genocide\n\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza.\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, and 91,722 wounded in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 11,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\n‘New Crime Against Humanity’ – Reaction to Israel’s Latest Massacre in Gaza\n\nIsrael says that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation on October 7. Israeli media published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed on that day by ‘friendly fire’.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt – in what has become Palestine’s largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nLater in the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians began moving from the south to central Gaza in a constant search for safety.\n\n(The Palestine Chronicle)\n\nAl-Qassam fighters target Israeli forces in Rafah. (Photo: video grab)\n\nBy Palestine Chronicle Staff\n\nAn Israeli airstrike on a school housing displaced Palestinians killed more than 100 and injured several more on Saturday, in one of the deadliest attacks witnessed in Gaza in recent weeks.\n\nThe attack, which received worldwide condemnation, marks the fifth time in approximately two weeks that Israeli forces have bombed a shelter center.\n\nHere are some reactions to the attack:\n\n‘Indifference of Civilized Nations’ – Francesca Albanese\n\n“Gaza: In the largest and most shameful concentration camp of the 21st century, Israel is genociding the Palestinians one neighborhood at the time, one hospital at the time, one school at the time, one refugee camp at the time, one ‘safe zone’ at the time,” Francesca Albanese, UN’s special rapporteur on Palestine said on X.\n\nShe added: “With US and European weapons. And amid the indifference of all “civilized nations”.\n\n“May the Palestinians forgive us for our collective inability to protect them, honoring the most basic meaning of intl law,” Albanese lamented.\n\n‘War Crime’ – Iran\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Nasser Kanaani strongly condemned the massacre saying “the cruel act is at once a flagrant instance of genocide, war crime and crime against humanity.”\n\nHe said the attack “once again proved that the apartheid Israeli regime does not comply with any of the rules and regulations of international law nor does it respect moral and humane principles.”\n\n‘Peak of Criminality’ – 13 Schools Turned Shelters Targeted in Gaza by Israel in August alone\n\nKanaani added that the only way to deal with this cruel regime is for Muslim and freedom-loving nations to take firm and decisive action to support the Palestinian people and their legitimate struggle and resistance against the Israeli occupation and aggression, a statement from his office said.\n\n‘No Justification’ – EU Chief\n\n“There’s no justification for these massacres,” Josep Borrell, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said on X. “We are dismayed by the terrible overall death toll.”\n\n“We regret & condemn Minister Smotrich opposition – against the interest of the Israeli people – to a deal. A ceasefire is the only way to stop the killing of civilians and secure the hostages’ release,” Borrell added.\n\n‘Unfolding Horrors’ – UNRWA Chief\n\n“Another day of horror in Gaza,” UNRWA Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini said on X. “Another school hit with reports of dozens of Palestinian killed among them women, children and older people.”\n\n“It’s time for these horrors unfolding under our watch to end. We cannot let the unbearable become a new norm. The more recurrent, the more we lose our collective humanity,” he added.\n\n‘Sabotage’ – Türkiye\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said Israel “has committed a new crime against humanity by massacring” more than a hundred civilians who had taken refuge in a school building in the Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City.\n\n“This attack demonstrated once again that the Netanyahu Government intends to sabotage the negotiations for a permanent ceasefire,” the ministry said. “International actors who do not take steps to stop Israel are complicit in Israel’s crimes.”\n\n‘Compliance with ICJ’ – Spain\n\n“We demand, once again, full compliance with the provisional measures imposed by the “International Court of Justice and the protection of the civilian population,” Spain’s Foreign Ministry reportedly said in a statement.\n\n‘Undoubted War Crimes’ – Ireland\n\n“This weekend has brought the grisly milestone of 40,000 deaths in Gaza a step closer,” said Simon Harris, Ireland’s Prime Minister.\n\nIn a statement, he added: “490 of Gaza’s schools have been bombed or damaged since the start of the war, and this weekend’s images from inside al-Taba’een school are gut-wrenching. Ireland condemns outright such awful and wholesale loss of civilian life.”\n\nOn the Logic of Israeli Massacres and the Dichotomy of Arab Mediation – ANALYSIS\n\n“We have all been horrified by the many undoubted war crimes that have been committed in Gaza. There can be no impunity. Those responsible must be held to account,” he said. “All the legally binding orders of the ICJ must also be implemented in full.”\n\n‘No Justification’ – Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry called on Israel to halt its attacks on civilian targets in Gaza.\n\nIn a statement, spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reportedly said: “We believe there is no and can be no justification for such actions.”\n\n‘Open Aggression’ – Pakistan\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the Israeli bombing of the school an “open aggression.”\n\n“We once again reiterate our demand that the Israeli leadership and security forces be brought to justice for the genocide of Palestinian and war crimes committed in Palestine,” Sharif reportedly said.\n\n‘Blatant Violation’ – Iraq\n\n“These ongoing assaults on civilians constitute a blatant violation of international norms and conventions,” an Iraqi Foreign Ministry statement reportedly said.\n\n“They also demonstrate Israel’s disregard for global efforts aimed at achieving a cease-fire in Gaza,” it added.\n\nThe ministry urged the international community, particularly the Islamic world, to “take a firm stance to halt the Israeli aggression against the Palestinians.”\n\n‘Brutal Crimes’ – Qatar\n\n“This act is deemed a horrific massacre, a brutal crime against defenseless civilians, and a flagrant infringement of the fundamental precepts of international humanitarian law and UN Security Council resolution 2601,” Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThe Ministry reiterated its call for conducting an “urgent international investigation by dispatching independent UN investigators to probe the ongoing targeting by Israeli occupation forces of schools and shelters for displaced people.”\n\nIt called on Israel to “abide by international laws.”\n\n‘Blatant Disregard’ – Egypt\n\nIn a statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry condemned the attack and accused Tel Aviv of a “lack of genuine intent” to end the ongoing war.\n\nThe ministry said the attack is a “blatant disregard for international and humanitarian law.”\n\n“The persistent large-scale attacks and the high civilian casualties increase whenever efforts to negotiate a cease-fire intensify,” it reportedly added.\n\n‘Stop the Mass Genocide’ – Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Saudi Foreign Ministry condemned “in the strongest terms” the massacre, stressing “the need to stop the mass genocide in Gaza Strip which is undergoing the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe due to the Israeli occupation’s continuous violations of international humanitarian law.”\n\n“The Kingdom also denounces the international community’s failure to hold Israel accountable for these violations,” the Ministry said in a statement.\n\nJordan\n\nSufyan Qudah, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson, expressed his country’s condemnation of Israel’s continued “breaches of international law and humanitarian norms.”\n\n“This targeted attack, which comes at a time when mediators are making efforts to resume negotiations for a hostage exchange deal that could lead to a permanent cease-fire, signals the Israeli government’s intent to obstruct and undermine these efforts,” he reportedly said.\n\nZionist Nazi Genocide’ – Hamas\n\nThe Resistance movement Hamas said the massacre was “a continuation of the Zionist Nazi genocide against our people, with the US administration complicit in the crimes.”\n\nThe movement said the massacre “is a horrific crime that marks a dangerous escalation in the unprecedented series of crimes and massacres in the history of wars, perpetrated in the Gaza Strip by the new Nazis.”\n\nHamas said the Israeli army “fabricates excuses to target civilians, schools, hospitals, and displacement camps, all of which are flimsy pretexts and exposed lies to justify its crimes,” adding that its actions “would not have continued without the direct American support … by covering up their crimes and providing them with all forms of political and military support, which makes the US fully complicit in these crimes.”\n\n‘Horrific Crime’ – Israeli Strike on Tabaeen School Kills over 100 Palestinians\n\nThe movement called “on our Arab and Islamic countries and the international community to fulfill their responsibilities and take urgent action to stop these massacres and the escalating Zionist aggression against our unarmed people and families.”\n\nHamas also denied “the narrative” by Israel “claiming” that there were members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad at the school, saying it was “misleading and false” and “an attempt to justify its heinous crime amid widespread international criticism.\n\n“The claims made by the occupation army are false and baseless. We affirm that among those who were martyred in today’s massacre, there was not a single armed individual; all of them were civilians targeted while performing the Fajr prayer. The list includes children, civilian employees, university professors, and religious figures, most of whom have no connection to any political or military activities.”\n\n(PC, Anadolu, MEMO, WAFA)\n\nIsraeli forces carried out a horrific massacre in the Tabbed school, sheltering displaced Palestinians. (Photo: via QNN TW Page)\n\nBy Palestine Chronicle Staff\n\nSeveral human rights groups and former State Department officials have urged the Biden administration to suspend arms transfers to Israel, citing violations of international law and human rights.\n\nThe US government is set to provide Israel with $3.5 billion to purchase American weapons and military equipment amidst its ongoing war on Gaza which has already killed more than 39,000 Palestinians.\n\nOn Thursday, the State Department “notified Congress of our intent to obligate $3.5 billion in FY 2024 Foreign Military Financing using funding provided by the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act,” a spokesperson told the Anadolu news agency.\n\nCiting multiple officials, CNN first reported that the funds came from the $14.1 billion supplemental funding bill for Israel that the US Congress passed in April.\n\n‘Structural Injustice’ – Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh an Act of Zionist Terrorism\n\nThe funding “is essentially money Israel can use to buy advanced weapons systems and other equipment from the US through the Foreign Military Financing program,” the report stated.\n\nIt was released this week, the report added, as Israel and the Middle East were bracing for a potential attack “from Iran and/or Hezbollah” after Tel Aviv assassinated Hamas’ political chief in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.\n\nInternational Law Violations\n\nSeveral human rights groups and former State Department officials have urged the Biden administration to suspend arms transfers to Israel, citing violations of international law and human rights.\n\nTwelve former US officials, including former State Department officials Josh Paul, Annelle Sheline, Stacy Gilbert and Hala Rharrit, said in a statement last month that “America’s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza.”\n\n‘US Govt Caused Human Tragedy By Supplying Israel With Arms’ – Gaza Government Office\n\nEarlier this month, a group of 38 independent human rights experts called on UN Member States to impose an arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Israel following the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) recent landmark ruling.\n\nThe experts called for an arms embargo, an end to all other commercial that may damage the Palestinians, and targeted sanctions, including asset freezes, on Israeli individuals and entities involved in illegal occupation, racial segregation and apartheid policies.\n\nHuman Rights Council\n\nIn June, a group of 30 experts, including several UN Special Rapporteurs, reiterated their demand for an immediate cessation of weapons and ammunition transfers to Israel.\n\n‘Apartheid is Non-Negotiable’ – UN Experts Call for Arms Embargo, Sanctions on Israel\n\n“In line with recent calls from the Human Rights Council and the independent UN experts to States to cease the sale, transfer, and diversion of arms, munitions, and other military equipment to Israel, arms manufacturers supplying Israel,” the experts said.\n\nA long-awaited report in May said it is “reasonable to assess” that Israel used US-made weapons in ways that are inconsistent with international humanitarian law, Anadolu reported.\n\nThe report stopped short of reaching a definitive conclusion saying it does not have “complete information.”\n\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza.\n\n‘Severe Violations’ – UN Experts Call for Immediate Cessation of Arms Transfers to Israel\n\nTel Aviv is currently on trial for genocide against Palestinians since it began waging a devastating war on Gaza on October 7.\n\nStaggering Death Toll\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, 39,677 Palestinians have been killed, and 91,645 wounded in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 11,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nIsrael says that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation on October 7. Israeli media published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed on that day by ‘friendly fire’.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\n‘Horrific Crime’ – Israeli Strike on Tabaeen School Kills over 100 Palestinians\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt – in what has become Palestine’s largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nLater in the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians began moving from the south to central Gaza in a constant search for safety.\n\n(PC, Anadolu)\n\nThe US continues to provide weapons to Israel.

We have the right to legitimate defense and this has nothing to do with the Gaza ceasefire”.\n\nIran reiterated on Friday that, although implementing a ceasefire in Gaza is a priority, Tehran has the right to defend itself, Mehr news agency reported.\n\nIn response to a question about whether Iran would delay its response to Israel until next week’s ceasefire talks regarding Gaza, the Iranian permanent mission to the United Nations emphasized that establishing a lasting ceasefire in Gaza is its priority.\n\n“Any agreement that Hamas accepts will be accepted by us,” the mission said.\n\nHaniyeh’s Assassination – Iranian Investigation Points to Airborne Shell\n\nThe mission also asserted that Iran’s national security and sovereignty had been violated by the recent Israeli actions, justifying their right to legitimate defense, which they clarified was separate from the Gaza ceasefire discussions.\n\n“Our national security and sovereignty have been violated during the recent terrorist act of the Israeli regime. We have the right to legitimate defense and this has nothing to do with the Gaza ceasefire,” the mission said.\n\nHowever, the mission expressed hope that their response would be timed in a way that would not undermine a potential ceasefire.\n\n“We hope that our response will be completed on time and in a way that does not harm the possible ceasefire,” it said.\n\nRegarding communication between Iran and the United States, the Iranian mission reportedly confirmed the existence of both direct and intermediary official channels for message transmission, while noting that both parties prefer to keep the details confidential.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, a prominent Palestinian political leader and the head of Hamas’ political bureau, was assassinated in Tehran in an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday.\n\nHaniyeh was in the Iranian capital for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nFor These Reasons Israel Assassinated Hamas’ Political Leader, Ismail Haniyeh – Analysis\n\nThe Iranian Fars News Agency reported on August 1 that Haniyeh was assassinated by an airborne projectile that struck his residence, causing damage to its roof and windows.\n\nThe agency added that initial investigations have determined Israel was responsible for planning and executing the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\nThe New York Times has also reported that US officials privately acknowledged Israel’s involvement in Haniyeh’s assassination in the Iranian capital, Tehran, which occurred on Wednesday. Despite this, Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for the incident and has refused to comment on it.\n\nHigh-ranking Iranian officials vowed to respond appropriately, with the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, warning that by assassinating Haniyeh, the Israeli regime had set the stage for severe repercussions.\n\n(PC, Mehr)\n\nThe funeral of Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital of Tehran.

Israeli media published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed on that day by ‘friendly fire’.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt – in what has become Palestine’s largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nLater in the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians began moving from the south to central Gaza in a constant search for safety.\n\n(Anadolu, PC)\n\nIsraeli forces carried out a horrific massacre in the Tabbed school, sheltering displaced Palestinians.
