        "text": "The publisher of one of Israel’s largest newspapers has been interviewed for eight hours as part of a sprawling police investigation into the country’s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe mammoth questioning of Arnon “Noni” Mozes, owner of the critical Yedioth Ahronoth tabloid, came as Netanyahu accused the country’s media – which has been publishing almost daily leaks from the case – of trying to “topple” his government.\n\nCentral to the affair, which police have called Case 2000, is the allegation that Netanyahu tried to ensure more positive coverage in the Israeli media by offering to reduce the circulation of a rival, pro-government paper in exchange for kinder coverage from Yedioth Ahronoth.\n\nA separate police investigation, Case 1000, is also taking place into gifts received by Netanyahu’s family from wealthy businessmen.\n\nNetanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in relation to both investigations.\n\nThe two investigations have dominated the Israeli media for weeks and led to speculation among Netanyahu’s political rivals – as well as some ministers in his own government – that he might be forced to resign, or trigger elections, if he is formally charged.\n\nMedia interest in Case 2000 has revolved around leaks of reported transcripts of recordings of Netanyahu and Mozes found at the home of Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, in which the two men appear to discuss a deal to keep Netanyahu in power by shifting the long-critical Yedioth Ahronoth behind him.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the media of using the leaked transcripts to systematically destroy him. Writing on Facebook, he said: “The system is simple: day after day, night after night, they [his critics] disseminate carefully selected, filtered transcripts and deliberate lies about both of the [investigations].“Obviously, as long as the investigation is in progress, I have no possibility of defending myself. I can’t tell the public the real story behind this, which would make clear that no crime occurred.”\n\nWhile Netanyahu has tried to rally support, the story of Case 2000 is seen as encompassing key themes in his years in office, not least his obsession with attempting to secure soft-ball coverage.\n\nFamously thin-skinned about his treatment by the Israeli media, Netanyahu also serves as communications minister.\n\nHe has long benefited from the support of Israel Hayom, a freesheet owned by the American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. The loss-making paper has been nicknamed the “Bibiton”, which combines Netanyahu’s nickname Bibi with the Hebrew word for newspaper. Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that he has any input.\n\nBut leaks from the tapes appear to paint a different picture of Netanyahu’s relationship with Israel Hayom and its main rival, Yedioth Ahronoth. In the leaked version of the tapes, Netanyahu appears to suggest he could cut the circulation of Israel Hayom in exchange for Mozes’s support, including appointing more friendly journalists.Legal experts have been divided over whether the revelations from the tapes depict a criminal conspiracy.\n\n“This is an improper contact between a government and newspaper,’’ Eliyahu Matza, a former Israeli supreme court justice told Israel Radio recently. “It’s forbidden in every way. This is against journalistic ethics. It is against democratic values. Is there a criminal element? Yes, I think so.”\n\nAvraham Diskin, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was unsure about whether there was criminality, but said that if an indictment came, Netanyahu could not survive it.\n\n“There is no question [the investigation] damages his image,” Diskin said. “And in Israel political affiliation is, for many people, not really towards specific parties but towards camps of parties.\n\n“We all know in the last election, because of the atmosphere of urgency, people from other right and centrist parties moved to [Netanyahu’s] Likud. Now I’m sure the movement is in the opposite direction.”"
