        "text": "Israeli daily newspaper\n\nIsrael Hayom (Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל הַיּוֹם, lit. 'Israel Today') is an Israeli national Hebrew-language free daily newspaper. Distributed for free around Israel,[6] it is the country's most widely distributed newspaper.[7][2] Owned by the family of Sheldon Adelson, a businessman, political donor, and personal friend and benefactor of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel Hayom has often been criticized for portraying Netanyahu in an overly positive light.[8] In turn, Netanyahu has been accused of attempting to benefit Adelson's investments.[9][10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIsrael Hayom's print edition, \"financed by the American casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson,\"[11] was launched on 30 July 2007, competing directly with Israeli, another free daily. That same year, Maariv editor Dan Margalit left the newspaper to write for Israel Hayom. A weekend edition was launched in October 2009. In 2014, Israel Hayom bought Israeli media outlets Makor Rishon and nrg מעריב.[5]\n\nIn May 2014 the name מעריב (Maariv) was removed from nrg log,[12] and it was rebranded as nrg. Following the acquisition, an antitrust complaint was filed against Israel Hayom, which resulted in a court order that requested the transfer of the maariv domain name to Maariv weekly.[13] In 2017, nrg was renamed to nrg360, and on 10 January 2018 the website closed; all of its content was merged into the Makor Rishon website.\n\nLater that year, it is believed, was when Sheldon Adelson invested at least $50 million in Israel Hayom.[14] Adelson's support of Netanyahu led the latter's political opponents in the Knesset to sponsor a bill that would prevent the distribution of newspapers in Israel for free. Although framed as a bill to prevent unfair competition and save the Israeli print newspaper industry, there was an outcry against it.[15]>[16] Critics of the bill said it hurt free enterprise and was a thinly veiled attempt to target Adelson and his political causes, as Israel Hayom was then Israel's only free-of-charge national newspaper. The bill passed the first reading in the Knesset, but not subsequent ones.[17] In 2016, Adelson's attorney announced that although it was commonly believed that Adelson owned the newspaper, it was owned by a relative of his.[18]\n\nIn January 2021, Saudi-American independent academic researcher, Najat Al-Saied, became the first person from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf to join Israel Hayom.[19]\n\nPolitical leaning\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a 2022 study, Israel Hayom benefitted Netanyahu and his Likud party electorally.[20]\n\nA 2008 study by Moran Rada published in The Seventh Eye showed that while competing newspapers' coverage of Netanyahu was \"not especially fair\", Israel Hayom's coverage was biased in favor of Netanyahu in most editorial decisions, and that the paper chose to play down events that did not help to promote a positive image for Netanyahu, while on the other hand touting and inflating events that helped promote Netanyahu and the Likud.[21] Oren Persico reached the same conclusion after the 2009 Knesset elections, writing that throughout the campaign Israel Hayom published only one article critical of the Likud, and tens of articles critical of Kadima.[22]\n\nA popular nickname of Israel Hayom is the \"Bibiton\", a portmanteau of Netanyahu's nickname \"Bibi\" with the Hebrew word for newspaper, iton.[8] During his tenure as Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert criticized Israel Hayom.[23][24] Journalist Ben-Dror Yemini described the paper as having \"endless capital with a political agenda\".[6]\n\nIn 2016, the paper formally endorsed the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.[25][26]\n\nConnection to Benjamin Netanyahu\n\n[edit]\n\nIsrael Hayom is owned by the family of Netanyahu's personal friend and benefactor Sheldon Adelson, and is often criticized by the political left for portraying Netanyahu in an overly positive light. In 2019, Netanyahu was indicted in five cases of alleged corruption; one of the cases, case 2000, directly involved Israel Hayom. According to the investigations, Netanyahu held three meetings with Arnon Mozes, editor of Yedioth Ahronoth, the main competitor of Israel Hayom, during which Netanyahu offered to limit the circulation of Israel Hayom[27] in exchange for Yedioth Ahronoth hiring journalists with more favorable views of himself.[28][29]\n\nMarket share\n\n[edit]\n\nBeing distributed for free, Israel Hayom has an advantage over other daily newspapers in Israel. In July 2010, Israel Hayom surpassed Yedioth Ahronoth in weekday exposure rate in the semi-annual Target Group Index (TGI) survey.[30]\n\nAs of January 1, 2024, a TGI survey indicated that Israel Hayom, distributed for free, is Israel's most read newspaper, with a 27.4% weekday readership exposure, followed by Yedioth Ahronoth, with 22.4%, Haaretz with 5.4%, Maariv with 3.5%, and Globes with 3.2%.[31]\n\nAs of July 31, 2023, a TGI survey had indicated that Israel Hayom, was Israel's most read newspaper, with a 29.4% weekday readership exposure, followed by Yedioth Ahronoth, with 22.3%, Haaretz with 4.8%, Globes with 4% and Maariv with 3.9%.[32]\n\nIn January 2016, citing internal records from Israel Hayom, Haaretz revealed that between 2007 and 2014, the newspaper lost about 730 million shekels ($190 million), approximately equal to a shekel per copy printed.[33]\n\nEmployees\n\n[edit]\n\nSenior management[34]\n\nMiriam Adelson – publisher.\n\nOmer Lachmanovitch – editor-in-chief.\n\nAmir Finkelstein – CEO.\n\nUri Dagon – news director.\n\nAmir Finkelshtein – chief operating officer.\n\nRiki Roob – chief financial officer.\n\nStaff[35]\n\nShlomo Cohen – editorial cartoonist.\n\nGideon Alon – parliamentary correspondent.\n\nRan Reznick – health correspondent.\n\nDan Margalit – senior commentator.\n\nNaama Lanski – magazine correspondent.\n\nEli Sahar – sports editor.\n\nShir Ziv – television critic.\n\nBoaz Bismuth – foreign news editor, senior analyst.\n\nShlomo Cesana – diplomatic correspondent.\n\nAviad Hacohen – legal affairs commentator.\n\nRonen Dorfan – sports commentator.\n\nYoav Kutner – music critic.\n\nLilach Shoval – military correspondent.\n\nMati Tuchfeld – political correspondent.\n\nShlomo Scharf – sports commentator.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nIsrael portal\n\nJournalism portal\n\nList of free daily newspapers\n\nList of national newspapers\n\nList of newspapers in Israel\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMedia related to Israel Hayom at Wikimedia Commons"
