On his behalf, Antone Attallah spoke of his sympathy with the victims of the holocaust as well as his belief in the necessity of the chastisement of the Nazis who conducted it causing the death of around 3 million Jew, saying that his feelings of empathy do not deny the right of the Jews in Germany to own houses and properties, thus, they have no right to settle in the lands of the refugees, and concluded by stressing on the Palestinian people's right of return to their homeland as long as it has the capacity of receiving new Jewish immigrants.\n\nDate created\n\nTYPE\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nMore details\n\nFormat\n\nColor photograph\n\nSource of Description\n\nNusseibeh, Sary. 9 June 2021. \"The Anwar Nusseibeh Collection\".
