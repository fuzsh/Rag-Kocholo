        "text": "After the Hezbollah’s Secretary General, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah, unveiled last week that the Israeli army has targeted a significant number of Israelis on October 7 while trying to push back the Resistance fighters, new reports are now emerging from different sources supporting his claim.\n\nIn a shocking report published by the Arabic media “al Arabia” today, the bombshell was dropped quoting to official Israeli media outlets, namely “Yedioth Aharonot” and “Haaretz”.\n\nAl Arabia editorial were smart enough to collect the information from within the lines of the multiple reports published by the outlets mentioned. According to al Arabia, “from day one of the al Aqsa Storm Operation, Israel started pushing for a narrative which linked this Operation to the events of 9/11 in the U.S. in an endeavor to connect the Palestinian Resistance to terrorism.\n\nTo do so, Israel largely relied on publishing fake images, misinformation and baseless accusations against Resistance combatants from all of which, they were acquitted.\n\nOne of the accusations of Israel against the Resistance combatants was that they have burned the settlers alive and torched their belongings.\n\nBut the truth about this accusation was revealed by the Israeli Yedioth Aharonot. The information disclosed by the outlet was collected by the journalist who had conducted the research, using the confessions of the Israeli fighter pilots. This research, published by the newspaper few days ago, was about the ability of the Resistance combatants to deceive the fighter helicopters and jets which were airborne above the Israeli settlements on October 7 to bombard the Resistance combatants.\n\nThe report was trying to answer the question of whether the Resistance fighters were actually able to deceive the pilots and if yes, how? [According to the results of the research published by the newspaper] the Resistance combatants refrained from entering the streets of the settlements [in an unordinary way] and they were moving in the streets like the ordinary settlers which could keep the fighter jets and helicopters away.\n\nMeanwhile, the fighter jets were more focused on the clash points. The pilots started to target everything which was moving in the clash points, while many of the targeted vehicles were those of the settlers, loaded with settlers who were fleeing from a music festival they had attended, near the border of Gaza. Some of these cars were packed with Israeli families and some were carrying the Israeli prisoners who were being transferred to Gaza”.\n\nThe report by al Arabia continues to reveal more disturbing information (for Zionists), this time referring to another research published by Haaretz newspaper.\n\n“In another independent research”, al Arabia says, “the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, also revealed that the Israeli army has been forced to bomb some its own military bases which were captured by the Palestinian Resistance combatants, while many Israeli army soldiers were still inside!”. Since the outset of the clashes between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli army on October 7, there have been numerous reports about Israeli army mistakenly targeting and killing its own citizens in large groups. One of the first indications of this huge failure was an interview with one of the Israeli settlers who had fled the music festival and firmly claimed that she “saw Israeli security forces shooting at Israeli settlers, not the Resistance combatants”.\n\nThe interview was quickly removed from the outlet and, as usual, the Israeli army denied to comment about the info presented. But as more and more evidence is presented through official Israeli outlets and by others specially on social media, it will not take long before the Israeli army is forced to accept the responsibility of many Israeli festival goers who were killed on October 7, and as part of the misinformation campaign, were introduced as the victims of the Palestinian Resistance Operation.\n\nThe U.S. Special Forces Suffer the First Defeat in West Asia, All Missing in Action\n\nA former Pentagon adviser, Douglas McGregor, spoke about the termination of the U.S. Special Forces rescue operation. In addition, he claims that everyone involved was destroyed. There were reports of the first casualties among the U.S. military in the Middle East. Elite U.S. Special Forces soldiers were supposed to rescue hostages held by Palestinian rebels, but the mission failed and all the special forces were killed. This was reported by former Pentagon adviser Colonel Douglas McGregor. When describing what had happened, he used the phrase \"cut into pieces\". McGregor's military connections give weight to his claims. To make matters worse, it wasn't until a few days later that the Pentagon reluctantly admitted to the victims in the Middle East. Arab rebels have now become bolder and are attacking U.S. military bases using drones and homemade missiles. The Pentagon said 24 soldiers were killed at one base and a civilian contractor suffered \"non-life-threatening injuries.\"\n\nThe Public Opinion: Another Battlefield Israel Lost\n\nAfter it was reported today that over 750 famous journalists from renowned media outlets all around the world have written letters to their directors and managers, accusing Israel of “ethnic cleansing”, the Israeli media quickly picked up the story to use as another instrument of playing victim and blaming the world for not standing by their side while they commit all kinds of war-crimes-by-definition.\n\n“More than 750 prominent international journalists”, an Israeli media reported, “signed an open letter to their directors and managers in which they accused Israel of killing at least 35 journalists in Gaza and held the newsrooms accountable for the inhumane rhetoric used to justify the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by Israel and for the double standards of the newsrooms.\n\nThe signatories of the letter are journalists from different newspapers and other outlets, including but not limited to: The Washington Post, MSNBC, The Guardian, The HuffPost, The Los Angeles Times, The Blumberg, Al Jazeera, Sky News, and even some Jewish media outlets”."
