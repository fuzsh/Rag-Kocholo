The new sections address developments in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria, as well as noteworthy activity from Iran’s Axis of Resistance.\n\nWe do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nThe Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. ISW and CTP at the American Enterprise Institute provides these updates regularly based on regional events.\n\nFor more on developments in Iran and the region, see our interactive map of Iran and the Middle East.\n\nClick here to see ISW’s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in ISW's campaign assessments of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps.\n\nBrian Carter, Annika Ganzeveld, Johanna Moore, Alexandra Braverman, and Nicholas Carl\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al Sudani announced that his administration will begin procedures to remove International Coalition forces from Iraq during a press conference on December 28, likely due to pressure from Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. An Iraqi decision to expel US forces will very likely create space for ISIS to rapidly resurge in Syria within 12 to 24 months and then threaten Iraq .\n\nHamas and its Palestinian allies are trying to shape peace negotiations in a way that is incompatible with the stated Israeli war aims. Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar is likely using Israeli hostages he holds as leverage to keep Hamas’ Gaza Strip leaders at the table during these negotiations—rather than delegating such negotiations exclusively to Hamas’ external leadership.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces continued clearing operations in Daraj and Tuffah neighborhoods in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF destroyed three tunnel shafts while searching a hospital and school.\n\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad attempted to defend against Israeli advances in Bureij.\n\nPalestinian militias continued trying to defend against Israeli clearing operations in Khan Younis.\n\nPalestinian fighters conducted three indirect fire attacks from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel.\n\nIsraeli forces clashed with Palestinian fighters in 11 locations across the West Bank.\n\nIranian-backed fighters, including Lebanese Hezbollah, conducted eight attacks from southern Lebanon into northern Israel.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed attacks on several new locations across the Middle East. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for a rocket attack targeting US forces at US Conoco Mission Support Site in northeastern Syria.\n\nFormer Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki met with senior Iranian-backed Iraqi actors.\n\nThe Iranian regime held a funeral ceremony for killed IRGC Brigadier General Razi Mousavi in Tehran.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al Sudani announced that his administration will begin procedures to remove International Coalition forces from Iraq during a press conference on December 28, likely due to pressure from Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. These militias have used legal, military, and political pressure in recent weeks to expel US forces, as CTP-ISW previously assessed. This pressure, particularly the Iranian-backed attacks on US forces, creates an escalation cycle that triggers US self-defense strikes to protect US servicemembers. The Iranian-backed factions and militias then misrepresent these self-defense strikes as violations of Iraqi sovereignty, which generates domestic pressure on Sudani to remove US forces. This pressure appears to have succeeded at least partly in that Sudani repeated Iranian-backed militia talking points about the United States. Sudani said that that the self-defense strikes are violations of Iraqi sovereignty and were inconsistent with the advisory role of the International Coalition.[1] These claims ignore the fact that the US forces have a right to self-defense and that the Iranian use of client militias and proxies in Iraq to attack US forces in line with Tehran’s regional agenda is itself a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. US advisory forces are currently deployed in Iraq for counter-ISIS operations at the invitation of the Iraqi [2]government. Sudani did not provide a timeline for removing International Coalition forces or describe the mechanism by which they would be removed.[3]\n\nAn Iraqi decision to expel US forces will very likely create space for ISIS to rapidly resurge in Syria within 12 to 24 months and then threaten Iraq. The US military mission in these countries is to enable the enduring defeat of ISIS and through cooperation with local partners.[4] The US support to its counter-ISIS partners in both Iraq and Syria is instrumental to successfully defeating ISIS.[5] US forces and infrastructure in Iraq provide the logistical support that enables the presence of US forces in Syria. The expulsion of US forces from Iraq would necessitate a withdrawal from Syria, where ISIS is reconstituting itself in Syrian regime-held territory.[6] CTP-ISW continues to assess that the United States and its partner in Syria have successfully contained but not defeated ISIS and that the US withdrawal from Syria will very likely cause a rapid resurgence in Syria within 12 to 24 months.[7] A resurgent ISIS would then be able to threaten Iraq again. The Iraqi Security Forces still face significant deficiencies in logistics, intelligence, and fire support that inhibit their ability to defeat ISIS alone.[8]\n\nHamas and its Palestinian allies are trying to shape peace negotiations in a way that is incompatible with the stated Israeli war aims. Hamas representatives met with other Palestinian factions in Beirut on December 27 to discuss the war and a possible ceasefire.[9] The other factions included Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the leftist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and the PFLP-General Command (PFLP-GC). These groups called collectively for establishing a national dialogue among all Palestinian factions, a unity government that includes all Palestinian factions, an end to the Israel-Hamas war, and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[10] The groups also called for a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. The groups said that the October 7 attack was a “historic turning point” and reaffirmed the importance of the Palestinian issue.[11] They blamed the Oslo Accords for the “decline” of the importance of the Palestinian cause in the Middle East.[12] These principles articulated by the Palestinian factions conflict with Israeli war aims, which Israeli officials have said are to “destroy Hamas, demilitarize Gaza, and deradicalize Palestinian society.”[13] The participation of Hamas and other radical groups, such as PIJ, that seek the destruction of Israel in a future Gazan or Palestinian government is tantamount to an Israeli defeat in this war.\n\nHamas and its Palestinian allies are using multiple, overlapping negotiations with different external parties to embed themselves in a postwar “unity government” and thereby undermining Israel’s ability to accomplish its war aims. Hamas is engaging in at least four sets of separate negotiations to counter any Israeli and Western efforts to form a governing authority that excludes Hamas. The negotiations in which Hamas representatives are involved include one with Egypt regarding the war itself, a second with its wartime allies in the Palestinian Allied Factions, a third with former Fatah and Palestinian Authority (PA) officials, and a fourth with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO).[14] Hamas political leaders met with Fatah and PA officials, including a deputy to Mohammed Dahlan and a former PA foreign affairs minister, to discuss integrating Hamas into the PLO after the war.[15] These negotiations will limit Israel’s ability to build a viable postwar governing authority in the form of a “reformed PA” by associating many of a reformed PA’s possible leaders with Hamas.[16]\n\nHamas leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar is likely using Israeli hostages he holds as leverage to keep Hamas’ Gaza Strip leaders at the table during these negotiations—rather than delegating such negotiations exclusively to Hamas’ external leadership. CTP-ISW still assesses that Hamas writ large is also using the Israeli hostages as leverage to ensure its continued relevance in postwar negotiations.[17] Sinwar is opposed to negotiations with the PLO because these talks sideline Sinwar. Sinwar asked Hamas leaders outside the Gaza Strip to cease talks with the PLO and PA.[18] Sinwar’s refusal to release hostages is in part to use them as leverage to maintain his influence in the negotiations. Hamas has also repeatedly refused to release its hostages prior to a comprehensive ceasefire, including in the December 28 joint statement after the meeting in Beirut.[19] Sinwar’s ability to agree to or refuse a hostage exchange allows him to maintain his influence within the movement writ large.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nErode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to launch and sustain a major ground operation into the Gaza Strip\n\nDegrade IDF material and morale around the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) continued clearing operations in Daraj and Tuffah neighborhoods in the northern Gaza Strip on December 28. The IDF said that the 401st and 460th brigade combat teams (BCT) have “eliminated” Palestinian fighters on the ground and used air support since December 26.[20] The Hamas’ military wing, the al Qassem Brigades, and PIJ’s military wing, the al Quds Brigades, are attempting to defend against these operations. The al Qassem Brigades detonated an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) and fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) targeting IDF vehicles in Daraj and Tuffah.[21] The al Quds Brigades also fired RPGs at Israeli vehicles in the neighborhood.[22]\n\nThe IDF destroyed three tunnel shafts while searching a hospital and school in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF said that it “investigated” three tunnels near al Rantisi hospital on December 27.[23] The IDF Yahalom Unit—a special operations engineering unit—searched the tunnel as part of the IDF effort to map the tunnel network under the strip. The IDF said that the Yahalom unit discovered that the tunnel is several kilometers long and leads deep into Gaza City. It added that the tunnel is close to a school and that the tunnel was used for military operations.\n\nHamas and PIJ attempted to defend against Israeli advances in Bureij in the central Gaza Srip on December 28. The New York Times released satellite imagery that showed Israeli forces advancing from two crossings into the Gaza Strip toward Bureij.[24] The IDF said on December 28 that its operations in Bureij were in their “final stages.”[25] The al Qassem Brigades and al Quds Brigades continued their efforts to defend against Israeli operations, however. The al Qassem brigades fired multiple RPGs and detonated one EFP targeting Israeli forces east of Bureij on December 28.[26] The al Quds Brigades added that it mortared Israeli forces east of the town.[27]\n\nPalestinian militias continued trying to defend against Israeli clearing operations in Khan Younis on December 28. The al Qassem Brigades attacked Israeli forces at least four times using anti-personnel devices and RPGs in northern and eastern Khan Younis.[28] The al Quds Brigades conducted rocket and mortar attacks on two Israeli positions north of Khan Younis.[29] The al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades—the self-proclaimed military wing of Fatah—mortared a concentration of Israeli forces operating in Khan Younis City.[30] The Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades fighters and ”special combat units” conducted a complex attack on Israeli forces operating near 5th Street in Khan Younis City using mortars, small arms, and RPGs.[31] The IDF confirmed that reserve forces have been destroying militia infrastructure in Bani Suheila, northeast of Khan Younis[32]\n\nPalestinian fighters conducted three indirect fire attacks from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel on December 28.[33] The al Quds Brigades claimed one rocket attack on Ein Hashlosha.[34]\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank and fix them there\n\nIsraeli forces clashed with Palestinian fighters in 11 locations across the West Bank on December 28.[35] The IDF conducted raids on money transfer locations suspected of providing financial services to Hamas.[36] Palestinian fighters threw Molotov cocktails and detonated IEDs during fighting in Ramallah and Jenin.[37] Israeli forces conducted an airstrike on fighters that Israel said were throwing explosives and firing on its forces.[38]\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel and fix them there\n\nSet conditions for successive campaigns into northern Israel\n\nIranian-backed fighters, including Lebanese Hezbollah (LH), conducted eight attacks from southern Lebanon into northern Israel on December 28.[39] LH claimed five attacks targeting Israeli military facilities along the border.[40] Unidentified Iranian-backed fighters fired over 50 rockets into the Galilee region.[41] Palestinian media posted footage claiming that a drone was shot down near Acre, north of Haifa.[42] Israeli air defense systems last intercepted a “suspicious target“ over Acre on November 14.[43]\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDemonstrate the capability and willingness of Iran and the Axis of Resistance to escalate against the United States and Israel on multiple fronts\n\nSet conditions to fight a regional war on multiple fronts\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed attacks on several new locations across the Middle East on December 27.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed that it conducted an unspecified attack on a “vital target” south of Eliad in the Golan Heights.[44] Israeli media reported that it was a one-way drone attack and marked the first time that such a drone landed in the Golan Heights since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.[45] Israeli media also reported that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq may have launched the drone, which caused minor damage but no injuries, from Syria.[46]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq also claimed that it attacked an Israeli “spy center” northeast of Erbil, Iraq.[47] Iranian state media claimed without evidence that the attack killed and injured several individuals.[48] The Iranian regime has historically accused Kurdish opposition groups and Israel of using Iraqi Kurdistan to facilitate operations into Iran. Iranian media previously claimed that the IRGC targeted an Israeli “spy den” when the IRGC conducted a missile attack on Erbil in March 2022.[49] The IRGC conducted attacks using artillery, missiles, and drones on Kurdish opposition groups, which Iran accused of supporting Mahsa Amini protesters in late 2022.[50] Iranian state media accused Kurdish opposition groups of helping Israel smuggle military equipment into Iran that Israel used in its January 2023 drone attack on a munitions factory in Esfahan.[51]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for a rocket attack targeting US forces at US Conoco Mission Support Site in northeastern Syria on December 28.[52]\n\nFormer Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki met with senior Iranian-backed Iraqi actors on December 27 and 28. Maliki met separately with Asaib Ahl al Haq (AAH) Secretary General Qais al Khazali and Badr Organization Secretary General Hadi al Ameri.[53] Maliki heads the State of Law coalition, and Ameri heads the We Build coalition. These political parties have respectively won the second highest and highest number of seats in the December 18 provincial council elections thus far. AAH’s media office reported that Maliki and Khazali agreed that US forces in Iraq are “exceeding their advisory capacity” and threatening regional countries.[54] The media office also reported that Maliki and Khazali discussed accelerating the formation of local governments following the elections. Maliki and Ameri similarly emphasized the need for the Independent High Electoral Commission to announce the final provincial council election results.[55] Maliki and Ameri condemned the December 25 US airstrikes on Kataib Hezbollah (KH) facilities.\n\nKH spokesperson Mohammad Mohi emphasized on December 27 that KH’s commitment to “resistance” against the United States and Israel is “irreversible.”[56] Mohi vowed that KH will not allow the United States or Israel to \"tamper with” Iraqi internal affairs and sovereignty.\n\nThe Iranian regime held a funeral ceremony for killed IRGC Brigadier General Razi Mousavi in Tehran on December 28.[57] Iranian officials have accused Israel of killing Mousavi in an airstrike near Sayyidah Zeinab in Syria on December 25. Western and anti-regime media have reported that Mousavi headed IRGC Quds Force Unit 2250, which manages Iranian weapons shipments to LH and Iranian-backed militias in Syria.[58] Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei led prayers and met with Mousavi’s family during the funeral.[59] Khamenei praised Mousavi for his “tireless jihad” and wished for his “companionship with the guardians of God.” Many individuals at the funeral carried flags with the text “I am your opponent” written in Persian and Hebrew.[60] Some attendees carried images of Mousavi together with former IRGC Quds Force Commander Major General Qassem Soleimani.[61] Many current and former high-ranking IRGC officials attended the funeral, including:\n\nIRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami;\n\nIRGC Quds Force Commander Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani;\n\nIRGC Quds Force Commander for the Levant Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi; and\n\nIRGC Quds Force Deputy Commander Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Fallah Zadeh.\n\nOther notable attendees included Khamenei’s son, Mostafa Khamenei, and Qassem Soleimani’s daughter, Zeynab Soleimani.[62] Zeinab’s husband, Reza Safieddine, is involved in weapons transfers from Iran to LH.[63] The presence of such senior Iranian political and military officials at Mousavi’s funeral highlights his prominence in the regime and its regional project.\n\nIRGC spokesperson Ramazan Sharif promised that on December 28 Iran’s response for the killing of Razi Mousavi will be a combination of “direct action” and indirect action.[64] Sharif vowed that Iran or the Axis of Resistance would avenge the killing of Mousavi.\n\nIranian hardline Parliamentarian Mojtaba Tavangar claimed that Razi Mousavi was one of the “facilitators” of Hamas’ October 7 attack against Israel.[65] IRGC Commander Hossein Salami said that Mousavi was the ”central pillar” of the IRGC efforts in the Levant, especially in Lebanon and Syria.[66]\n\nIranian officials made statements countering the claim by IRGC spokesperson Brigadier General Ramazan Sharif that Hamas committed the October 7 attack against Israel to avenge the death of Qassem Soleimani.[67] Sharif walked back his comment on December 28 by stating thatthe motivations for the October 7 attack were purely related to the struggle of Palestinians rather than Iranian interests.[68] Sharif said that the efforts of Soleimani contributed to the alleged success of the attack but were not the reason for the attack. IRGC Commander Hossein Salami officially declared that October 7 was “completely a Palestinian operation” at the funeral for Razi Mousavi on December 28.[69] Salami stated that the October 7 attack was designed and implemented by Palestinians. Chief of Staff of the Office of the Supreme Leader Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani stated that the story of the Gaza Strip is about the Palestinians—not about Iran.[70] He said that Iran was not involved in the October 7 attack but that the Axis of Resistance” has followed Iran’s example in defending their rights”. He further emphasized that US President Joe Biden should be held accountable for alleged Israeli war crimes in the Gaza Strip.\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps.\n\nBrian Carter, Andie Parry, Amin Soltani, Annika Ganzeveld, Alexandra Braverman, and Nicholas Carl\n\nInformation Cutoff: 2:00 pm EST\n\nIran Update, December 22, 2023\n\nIran Update, December 19, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps.\n\nAshka Jhaveri, Andie Parry, Annika Ganzeveld, Amin Soltani, Peter Mills, Kathryn Tyson, Brian Carter, Alexandra Braverman, and Nicholas Carl\n\nInformation Cutoff: 2:00pm ET\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nIsrael has degraded Hamas’ North Gaza Brigade, which is consistent with CTP-ISW's observation that Israel appears to be nearing the final stages of its clearing operation in the northern Gaza Strip. Palestinian militias continued attacks targeting Israeli forces east of Jabalia.\n\nIsraeli forces continued clearing operations in Shujaiya neighborhood of Gaza City.\n\nPalestinian militias are continuing to use the relative safe haven of the Gaza Strip’s Central Governorate to attack Israeli forces south of Gaza City.\n\nPalestinian fighters continued to conduct a deliberate defense against Israeli advances in Khan Younis. The IDF deployed an additional brigade to Khan Younis\n\nPalestinian militias mortared Israeli forces in the central and southern Gaza Strip. The al Qassem Brigades conducted at least two indirect fire attacks into Israel from the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli forces clashed with Palestinian fighters seven times across the West Bank. Hamas continues to demonstrate solidarity with Palestinian militias in the West Bank.\n\nIranian-backed fighters, including Lebanese Hezbollah, conducted four attacks from southern Lebanon into northern Israel.\n\nIsrael seeks a deal to push Lebanese Hezbollah forces “roughly six miles” from the Israel-Lebanon border to prevent possible LH cross border attacks, according to US and Israeli officials.\n\nThe Iraqi High Electoral Commission released preliminary results for the Iraqi provincial council elections. Shia parties, including those affiliated with Iran, won the largest count of votes in Baghdad and most of Iraq’s southern provinces.\n\nThe Jordanian Air Force conducted airstrikes on Iran-linked drug smuggling targets in Salkhad, Suwayda Province, Syria.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced Operation Prosperity Guardian in response to Houthi attacks on international shipping around the Red Sea. The Houthi attack campaign targeting commercial shipping continues to achieve one of its desired effects of disrupting Red Sea maritime traffic headed to Israel.\n\nFighters from the Balochi Salafi-jihadi group Jaish al Adl were likely responsible for an improvised explosive device attack targeting an IRGC Special Forces Brigade near Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan Province.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nErode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to launch and sustain a major ground operation into the Gaza Strip\n\nDegrade IDF material and morale around the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael has degraded Hamas’ North Gaza Brigade, which is consistent with CTP-ISW's observation that Israel appears to be nearing the final stages of its clearing operation in the northern Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the beginning of clearing operations in Jabalia on November 18.[1] The IDF reported on December 19 that it completely “dismantled” Hamas’ three battalions operating in Jabalia.[2] About 500 suspected Palestinians fighters surrendered to Israeli forces in the Jabalia refugee camp, some of whom belong to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).[3] Israeli Army Radio reported that the IDF fought “hard battles” in Jabalia against Palestinian militias for more than two weeks until Israeli forces had killed over 1,000 fighters.[4] IDF Brigadier General Itzik Cohen said that the fighting in Jabalia \"resulted in the dismantling of the military capacity” of Hamas’ North Gaza Brigade.[5] The IDF estimated on December 19 that there are only a few militia fighters left in the Jabalia area.[6]\n\nPalestinian militias continued attacks targeting Israeli forces east of Jabalia. Palestinian militias continued to defend against Israeli advances east of Jabalia city. The al Qassem Brigades—the militant wing of Hamas—claimed two attacks on Israeli forces using thermobaric rockets and rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) in Tal al Zaatar, north of Jabalia refugee camp.[7] The al Quds Brigades—the militant wing of PIJ—mortared Israeli forces in the same area.[8] The al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades—the self-proclaimed militant wing of Fatah—claimed a complex attack on Israeli forces advancing in the Jabalia refugee camp using small arms and RPGs.[9] The al Nasser Salah al Din Brigades—the militant wing of the Popular Resistance Committees—claimed an attack on Israeli forces east of Jabalia city for the first time since December 13.[10]\n\nIsraeli forces continued clearing operations in Shujaiya neighborhood of Gaza City on December 19. The IDF located an IED planted inside a clinic in Shujaiya in addition to finding other weapons in the area.[11] The al Quds Brigades claimed that its fighters clashed with seven Israeli infantrymen on the Israeli forward line of advance in the neighborhood.[12] The al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades also said that its fighters clashed with Israeli forces in central Shujaiya.[13]\n\nIsraeli special operations forces operated inside a Hamas tunnel system in Gaza city on December 19. The Israeli defense minister said on December 12 that Israeli troops had descended deep underground to locate Hamas bunkers, command centers, communication rooms, and weapon storage sites.[14] Hamas published a video showing a dead Israeli working dog in a Hamas tunnel in Sheikh Radwan on December 15, demonstrating the presence of both Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters in the tunnels.[15] Palestinian militia fighters have used tunnel shafts to maneuver through the strip and to ambush Israeli forces[16] The IDF has located about 1,500 tunnel shafts and routes in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip.[17]\n\nPalestinian militias are continuing to use the relative safe haven of the Gaza Strip’s Central Governorate to attack Israeli forces south of Gaza City. The al Qassem Brigades claimed three attacks using thermobaric rockets and RPGs on Israeli forces in Mughraqa, just north of Wadi Gaza.[18] The National Resistance Brigades—the militant wing of Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)—mortared Israeli vehicles advancing north of Juhor ad Dik.[19] The IDF reported on December 19 that Israeli forces destroyed a tunnel shaft south of Gaza City.[20] Israeli forces conducted an airstrike targeting a large number of militia fighters who fled into a building.[21]\n\nPalestinian fighters continued to conduct a deliberate defense against Israeli advances in Khan Younis on December 19. The al Quds Brigades shelled Israeli support sites and ground lines of communication (GLOC) as part of the Palestinian militias’ efforts to disrupt and harass Israeli GLOCs in Khan Younis.[22] Palestinian militias previously targeted the Israeli GLOC on December 15.[23] Palestinian fighters also attacked Israeli artillery units east of Khan Younis with mortars on December 19.[24] The IDF moved elements of its Artillery Corps into the Gaza Strip on December 10.[25]\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades attacked Israeli infantry conducting clearing operations in urban areas of Khan Younis on December 19. Al Qassem Brigades fighters rigged a house to explode in Khan Younis, detonating it when Israeli forces entered the building.[26] The al Qassem Brigades claimed that it trapped Israeli forces in a house and detonated anti-personnel charges and thermobaric shells in a separate incident.[27] The al Qassem Brigades claimed both attacks killed and wounded Israeli forces but did not provide evidence for the claim. Palestinian militias continued to attack Israeli infantrymen and vehicles in Khan Younis using RPGs, mortars, and rockets.[28]\n\nThe IDF deployed an additional brigade to Khan Younis on December 19. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that the IDF is expanding clear operations around Khan Younis by deploying an additional brigade and engineering force to the area.[29] The IDF 55th Brigade continued operations in Khan Younis by raiding weapons storage facilities, clearing houses, and engaging in close-range clashes with Palestinian fighters on December 19.[30]\n\nIsrael conducted an airstrike to kill a Hamas financier, Subhi Ferwana, who the IDF said was a vital resource for the al Qassem Brigades.[31] The IDF reported that Ferwana was involved in transferring millions of dollars to Hamas and its al Qassem Brigades. The militia used the funds to pay salaries and build its military capabilities during the war.[32]\n\nPalestinian militias mortared Israeli forces in the central and southern Gaza Strip on December 19. Israeli forces have not commenced major, large-scale clearing operations in most of the central Gaza Strip at this time. The al Quds Brigades mortared Israeli soldiers east of Maghazi in Gaza’s Central Governorate.[33] The al Qassem Brigades launched mortars at Israeli forces east of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.[34]\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades conducted at least two indirect fire attacks into Israel from the Gaza Strip on December 19. The al Qassem Brigades fired a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv.[35] The al Qassem Brigades also filmed its fighters launching rockets from the Gaza Strip at unspecified locations in Israel. [36] The al Quds Brigades and other Palestinian militias did not claim indirect fire attacks into Israel on December 19. The low rate of indirect fire attacks into Israel is consistent with CTP-ISW's assessment that Israeli forces are likely degrading Hamas’ capacity to conduct indirect fire attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel.\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank and fix them there\n\nIsraeli forces clashed with Palestinian fighters seven times across the West Bank on December 19.[37] The al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades fired small arms and detonated IEDs targeting Israeli forces in Azzun, west of Nablus.[38] Unspecified fighters \"confronted“ Israeli forces during Israeli operations in Aqraba, southeast of Nablus, as well.[39] The IDF demolished the Aqraba home of a Palestinian fighter, who attacked Israelis in the West Bank in August 2023.[40] The Jenin Battalion of the al Quds Brigades separately fired small arms at Israeli forces in Jenin.[41]\n\nThe IDF arrested ten individuals across the West Bank, including four Hamas fighters.[42]\n\nHamas continues to demonstrate solidarity with Palestinian militias in the West Bank. The al Qassem Brigades said that it launched rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel on December 19 to commemorate Palestinian fighters killed in the West Bank.[43] The al Qassem Brigades said that it wrote the names of militia fighters from the West Bank-based Lions’ Den militia and al Qassem Brigades on the rockets. The Lions’ Den and Hamas have expressed support for and alignment with one another throughout the Israel-Hamas war.[44] Hamas has repeatedly called for escalation against Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank, especially since the war began.[45]\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel and fix them there\n\nSet conditions for successive campaigns into northern Israel\n\nIranian-backed fighters, including Lebanese Hezbollah (LH), conducted four attacks from southern Lebanon into northern Israel on December 19.[46] LH claimed two anti-tank guided missile attacks targeting Israeli military positions.[47] The al Qassem Brigades fired a 12-rocket salvo targeting civilians in Kiryat Shmona.[48] The group claimed that it conducted the attack in retaliation for Israel’s ground operation in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael seeks a deal to push LH “roughly six miles” from the Israel-Lebanon border to prevent possible LH cross border attacks, according to US and Israeli officials.[49] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that they seek to prevent LH from returning the positions along the Israel-Lebanon border that Israeli airstrikes have destroyed since October. Austin said Washington understood Israeli concerns and asked for “time and space” for diplomatic efforts to remove LH from the border. Netanyahu and Gallant agreed to give the Biden administration time for a diplomatic solution but added that they “wanted to see progress in the next few weeks,” according to Israeli officials. Israeli officials seek to use diplomatic measures to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which bars LH military units from operating south of the Litani River.[50]\n\nThe deputy chairman of the LH Executive Council said on December 19 that Israel is “too weak” to attack or “impose [its] conditions” on Lebanon. LH Executive Council Deputy Chairman Ali Damoush said that the “only option” to protect Lebanon is “resistance, not the international community, the United Nations, or the [UN] Security Council.”[51] The LH Executive Council is responsible for implementing the group’s policy in specific areas, including media, health, social, education, and political issues.[52] It notably does not implement foreign policy.[53] LH Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah manages LH’s external relations directly, rather than through the Executive Council.[54] Damoush said that Israel is “too weak” to carry out its “threats” to use military force to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1701.[55]\n\nIsraeli tanks fired at and artillery shelled a Syrian Arab Army (SAA) outpost in southern Syria on December 18 in retaliation for rocket fire from Syria toward the Golan Heights earlier that day.[56] The IDF said that unspecified fighters fired several rockets from Syria. The rockets did not land in the Golan Heights, however.\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDemonstrate the capability and willingness of Iran and the Axis of Resistance to escalate against the United States and Israel on multiple fronts\n\nSet conditions to fight a regional war on multiple fronts\n\nThe Iraqi High Electoral Commission (IHEC) released preliminary results for the Iraqi provincial council elections on December 19.[57] Iraq held provincial council elections on December 18 for the first time since 2013.[58] Iraqi provincial councils are authorized to appoint and remove governors as well as approve provincial director-general positions and approve provincial security plans.[59]\n\nParties and coalitions aligned with the Shia Coordination Framework—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi parties—won the largest count of votes in Baghdad and most of Iraq’s southern provinces.[60] The We Build Coalition, which is headed by Iranian-backed Badr Organization Secretary General Hadi al Ameri, won the most votes in Al Qadisiyah, Babil, Dhi Qar, Maysan, and Najaf provinces in southern Iraq.[61] These provinces are predominantly Shia.[62] Poor Iraqi Shia in southern Iraq have historically supported Iraqi nationalist Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr, who has competed with Iranian-backed parties for political influence on several occasions in recent years. Sadr called for a boycott of the provincial council elections, claiming that participation in the elections “would reinforce the dominance of a corrupt political class.”[63] Maysan Province recorded the lowest voter participation rate of 29 percent.[64] The State of Law Coalition, which is headed by former Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, won the highest number of votes in southern Iraq’s Muthanna province.[65] Maliki and his party are part of the Shia Coordination Framework.\n\nThe Diyalatna al Watan Alliance, which appears to be affiliated with the Badr Organization, won the most votes in Diyala Province.[66] Diyala is a diverse province that includes Shia and Sunni Muslims as well as various ethnic groups, including Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmen.[67] The Diyalatna al Watan Alliance reposted a statement from Badr Organization Secretary General Hadi al Ameri thanking citizens for voting in the elections.[68]\n\nThe Nineveh Liahliha Party, which is led by former Nineveh Governor Najm al Jubouri, won the most votes in Nineveh Province.[69] Najm al Jubouri submitted his resignation as the governor of Nineveh on November 26.[70] IHEC barred al Jubouri from running in the provincial elections based on corruption charges brought against him by the Accountability and Justice Commission.[71] The Shia Coordination Framework enabled Jabouri’s disqualification, as the coalition spearheaded a series of amendments to Iraq’s election laws in March 2023, one of which barred individuals charged with corruption from participating in elections.[72] Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al Sudani appointed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)-affiliated Abdul Qadir al Dakhil as the acting governor of Nineveh on November 27.[73] The Kurdish Democratic Party won the second highest number of votes in Nineveh Province.[74]\n\nThe Patriotic Union of Kurdistan won the most votes in Kirkuk Province.[75] Kirkuk Province recorded the highest voter participation rate of 65 percent.[76]\n\nThe 28th PMF Brigade deployed to Khanaqin, Diyala Province on December 19.[77] The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq established the brigade in 2014 and its founder, Jalal al Din al Saghir, has previously pledged allegiance to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.[78] PMF spokesperson Sadiq al Husseini said on December 19 that the PMF would extend its “security alert” in Diyala Province for 24 hours to support security forces in the “post-general voting phase.”[79]\n\nThe Jordanian Air Force conducted airstrikes on Iran-linked drug smuggling targets in Salkhad, Suwayda Province, Syria, on December 18.[80] The targets facilitated drug smuggling from Syria into Jordan and the Gulf states. The airstrikes follow small arms clashes between the Jordanian forces and Iran-linked individuals trying to smuggle drugs and weapons through the Jordan-Syria border between December 12 and 18.[81] The weapons included rocket launchers, anti-personnel mines, and other explosives. Jordan previously conducted airstrikes in Suwayda targeting Iran and LH-linked targets tied to drug smuggling in May 2023.[82]\n\nJordanian officials have previously expressed concern about Iran-linked security threats beyond drug and weapons smuggling.[83] The Jordanian armed forces shot down three drones that entered Jordan from Syria in August 2023.[84] Jordanian officials linked the drones to Iran-backed militias in Syria. Iranian-backed militias in Syria often use these drones to fly drugs over the border, but the drones could also be used to conduct attacks on civilian and military targets inside Jordan, including US forces stationed inside the country.[85] Iran-backed groups have also used Jordanian territory to smuggle weapons into Israel and the West Bank.[86]\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced Operation Prosperity Guardian on December 18 in response to Houthi attacks on international shipping around the Red Sea.[87] A senior US military official stated that the Houthis have conducted one-way drone and missile attacks targeting 10 merchant vessels linked to over 35 different nations in recent weeks.[88] Operation Prosperity Guardian will operate under Combined Maritime Task Force 153, which was established in April 2022 to improve maritime security in the Red Sea.[89] The United Kingdom, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles, and Spain will support the US-led effort.[90] Politico reported that ten more countries have signed onto the new maritime task force but that they do not want to be publicly named as participating in the operation.[91] Austin encouraged the 39 members of Combined Maritime Task Force 153 to work with the United States to deter future Houthi aggression in the Red Sea on December 19.[92]\n\nThe Houthi attack campaign targeting commercial shipping continues to achieve one of its desired effects of disrupting Red Sea maritime traffic headed to Israel. The Chinese state-owned shipping company COSCO, which is the world’s fourth largest shipping company, announced it was suspending shipments through the Red Sea on December 19.[93] Shipping companies with a combined market share of over percent of global shipping have announced that they will no longer travel through the Red Sea in recent days in response to Houthi aggression.[94]\n\nSenior Houthi officials are continuing to threaten attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam accused the United States of “militarizing” the Red Sea and claimed that the US-led coalition would not alter the Houthis’ support for Palestine.[95] Salam threatened that the Houthis would continue attacks in the Red Sea until humanitarian aid is allowed into the Gaza Strip.[96] The conditions in which the Houthis would cease attacks are unclear given that humanitarian aid has entered the Gaza Strip on several occasions in recent weeks.[97] Houthi Supreme Political Council member and key powerbroker Mohammed al Houthi falsely claimed on December 19 that the Houthis do not want to close the Bab al Mandeb to trade and that the Houthis only target Israeli ships and ships heading to Israel.[98] Several of the ships that the Houthis have attacked in recent days were en route to destinations outside of Israel, such as Saudi Arabia.[99]\n\nFighters from the Balochi Salafi-jihadi group Jaish al Adl were likely responsible for an improvised explosive device attack targeting an IRGC Special Forces Brigade near Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, on December 19. A 110th Salman Farsi Independent Special Forces Brigade support vehicle struck a roadside IED near Zahedan.[100] Iranian media stated that there were no injuries or significant damage to the vehicle. No group has claimed responsibility at the time of writing. Jaish al Adl conducted a two-stage ambush and raid targeting an Iranian police station in Rask, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, on December 15, killing 11 Law Enforcement Command officers.[101] Iranian officials blamed Israel for the December 15 attack.[102] Iranian judicial authorities executed an unspecified individual in Sistan and Baluchistan Province on December 16 for allegedly cooperating with the Mossad to assist anti-regime militias in the province.[103] Jaish al Adl has previously conducted IED attacks in Iran, although such attacks are very rare.[104]\n\nThe Iranian ambassador to Russia read a statement by Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf at a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in Moscow on December 19.[105] The CSTO is a Russia-led collective defense military alliance. Ghalibaf in the statement called for establishing a Palestinian state in Jerusalem to achieve regional stability.[106] Ghalibaf also stated that regional conflicts should be solved by regional powers and warned international actors not to get involved. implying that the United States should not involve itself in the Israel-Hamas war. The Belarusian, Kazakhstani, and Tajikistani parliamentary heads attended the CSTO session as well.[107]\n\nIranian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister for Political Affairs Ali Bagheri Kani met with Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Yoko Kamikawa in Tokyo on December 19.[108] The two discussed bilateral relations and the Israel-Hamas war. Bagheri called for an immediate ceasefire and claimed that ethnic cleansing is occurring in the Gaza Strip without providing evidence. Kamikawa emphasized the need to send humanitarian aid to the citizens of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIran Update, December 18, 2023\n\nIran Update, November 4, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps.\n\nAshka Jhaveri, Andie Parry, Johanna Moore, Brian Carter, Amin Soltani and Frederick W. Kagan\n\nInformation Cutoff: 2pm ET\n\nCaptured Hamas plans suggest that Hamas has not heavily committed to defending parts of the northern outskirts of Gaza City, which may indicate that Hamas units in parts of that area are screening for a main defensive effort in central Gaza City.\n\nIsraeli ground forces advanced along the northwestern Gazan coast on November 4.\n\nIsraeli forces advanced to the southern Tal al Hawa neighborhood, Gaza City, on or around November 3.\n\nPalestinian militias in the Gaza Strip conducted indirect fire attacks into Israeli territory, primarily in southern Israel.\n\nThe Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade West Bank Branch responded negatively to LH Secretary General Nasrallah’s November 3 speech and called for permanent mobilization.\n\nLesser-known West Bank militias also called for Palestinians to revolt against Israel.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—an umbrella group of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed responsibility for three attacks targeting US forces in Iraq between November 3 and 4.\n\nIranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian held separate phone calls with his Brazilian and British counterparts on November 3 and 4.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nErode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to launch and sustain a major ground operation into the Gaza Strip\n\nDegrade IDF material and morale around the Gaza Strip\n\nCaptured Hamas plans suggest that Hamas has not heavily committed to defending parts of the northern outskirts of Gaza City, which may indicate that Hamas units in parts of that area are screening for a main defensive effort in central Gaza City. The IDF captured and published a Hamas map apparently showing a Hamas company’s area of responsibility between al Toam and Falouja roads west of Jabaliya during a raid on a Hamas intelligence headquarters in Jabaliya.[1] The sector is roughly half a kilometer deep and 1.5 kilometers across, which is a large sector for a company-sized unit defending against a mechanized advance in an urban area, depending on how Hamas tactical units are structured. Most of the area is not heavily built up, however, and Hamas commanders may simply have chosen not to focus on it. Palestinian militant attacks behind the Israeli forward line of advance are probably another supporting effort intended to harass and disrupt Israeli forces, rather than defeat them.\n\nIsraeli Clearing Operations\n\nIsraeli ground forces advanced along the northwestern Gazan coast on November 4. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released footage of engineering and infantry forces conducting route clearance operations along the coast.[2] The IDF reported that armor and engineering units cleared areas of explosive devices and targeted Palestinian militants.[3] Independent analyst on X (Twitter) identified Israeli vehicles traveling southwest from areas in which CTP-ISW previously reported Israeli clearing operations.[4] IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the IDF is encircling Gaza City from the air land, and sea.[5]\n\nPalestinian militias continued to attack Israeli ground forces in the northern Gaza Strip with small arms, anti-tank munitions, and indirect fire. The al Qassem Brigades—the militant wing of Hamas—published footage of its militants maneuvering through tunnel systems in Beit Hanoun and attacking IDF forces with various weapons.[6] A Palestinian journalist said that the clashes occurred on the al Karamah Street which runs north-south through the Beit Hanoun.[7] The Wall Street Journal published a map of the tunnel system that Hamas has created below the Gaza Strip, which includes a system underneath Beit Hanoun.[8] Hamas and PIJ-affiliated media reported violent clashes near the border fence east of Beit Hanoun.[9] Al Quds Brigades—the militant wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)— claimed to clash with IDF forces in the same area.[10]\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades claimed to attack IDF forces in the areas northwest of Beit Lahia and west of Atatra.[11] CTP-ISW has tracked IDF advances west of Beit Lahiya along the coast since October 27. A Palestinian journalist reported Israeli ground forces are “actively operating” in northwestern Beit Lahiya.[12] Sounds of nearby small arms fire in local footage from the area corroborate the claims of small arms clashes in Atatra.[13]\n\nIsraeli forces advanced to southern Tal al Hawa neighborhood, Gaza City, on or around November 3. Satellite imagery released on November 3 showed Israeli forces arrayed from north of Juhor ad Dik to southern Tal al Hawa on November 3.[14] The al Quds Brigades and al Qassem Brigades fired mortars in a combined operation targeting Israeli vehicles south of Tal al Hawa on November 4.[15] The al Qassem Brigades also fired two anti-tank rockets at two IDF vehicles south of Tal al Hawa.[16]\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades continued to attack Israeli forces near Juhor ad Dik on November 4.[17] The al Qassem Brigades claimed that it fired anti-tank rockets at Israeli vehicles near Juhor ad Dik on November 3.[18] The group also said it mortared Israeli vehicles east of Juhor ad Dik on November 4 in a separate attack.[19]\n\nThe IDF opened the Salah al-Din road—the primary north-south thoroughfare in the Gaza Strip—to allow civilians to evacuate Gaza City.[20] The IDF spokesperson said on November 4 that al Qassem Brigades fighters used mortars and anti-tank rockets against IDF forces securing the evacuation route during the humanitarian window.[21]\n\nThe al Quds Brigades launched an unspecified Ababil drone targeting an Israeli command center southeast of Zaytoun neighborhood on November 4.[22] The al Quds Brigades did not specify if the “Ababil” drone was the Iranian-built Ababil-1 or the locally Gazan-produced Ababil-1, which was developed by Hamas.[23]\n\nAn al Quds Brigades operations officer said on November 3 that the al Quds Brigades and al Qassem brigades are coordinating at the tactical and operational levels to defend against the IDF ground operation.[24]\n\nPalestinian militias in the Gaza Strip conducted indirect fire attacks into Israeli territory, primarily in southern Israel. The al Qassem Brigades claimed responsibility for four indirect fire attacks into the areas immediately adjacent to the Gaza Strip.[25] Al Qassem Brigades fired the Ayyash 250 rocket at Eilat in southern Israel for the second time since the war started.[26] Hamas introduced the Ayyash 250 rocket during the 2021 Gaza conflict.[27] Local reporting circulated claims that Qassem Brigades’ naval unit attempted to infiltrate Zikim beach, which is the first infiltration attempt since October 30.[28] The al Quds Brigades claimed responsibility for one indirect fire attack on November 3 and no attacks on November 4.[29]\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan on November 4 said that Hamas is proud of the support it is receiving from Lebanese Hezbollah (LH), the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, and the Yemeni Houthi movement in response to LH leader Hassan Nasrallah’s November 3 speech.[30]\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank and fix them there\n\nClashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces in the West Bank increased slightly on November 4. CTP-ISW recorded 17 clashes in the West Bank, an increase from 12 the day prior.[31] CTP-ISW also recorded five instances of Palestinian militants conducting IED attacks in the West Bank.[32] IDF raids across the West Bank likely contributed to the number of armed clashes.[33] CTP-ISW did not record anti-Israel demonstrations on November 4.\n\nThe Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade West Bank Branch responded negatively to LH Secretary General Nasrallah’s November 3 speech and called for permanent mobilization. The group’s military communique issued a few hours after Nasrallah’s speech stated, “we have seen that the Palestinian people and the resistance are alone.”[34] The statement also called for a permanent mobilization in the West Bank, the unification of all armed Palestinian factions and for small arms attacks on Israeli settlers. The al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade claimed responsibility for an attack targeting the Israeli settlement of Aveni Hevetz on October 29.[35] The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade is the self-claimed militant wing of Fatah, but Fatah does not claim association with the Brigade.\n\nLesser-known West Bank militias also called for Palestinians to revolt against Israel. Previously unknown West Bank militia group the “Mountain Guardians Gathering” called on Jenin residents to close roads and sabotage Israeli settler property at midnight on November 5.[36] The militia also called for sabotage around the major West Bank cities of Jerusalem, Jericho, Tubas, Salfit, Bethlehem, Hebron, Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah, Qalqiya, and Tulkarm.[37] Other militias called for popular protection committees to attack the IDF using weapons, incendiary bombs, and stones.[38] Student groups in the West Bank have planned non-violent protests and strikes for November 5.[39] Well-organized Palestinian militias like PIJ’s Jenin Branch and the Lions’ Den have previously called for armed mobilization in the West Bank with limited success, however.[40]\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel and fix them there\n\nSet conditions for successive campaigns into northern Israel\n\nLebanese Hezbollah (LH) and other Iranian-backed militants resumed cross-border attacks into northern Israel on November 4 at their normal rate after a lull the previous day. LH claimed eight attacks out of the 11 conducted on Israeli military and communications points along the border.[41] LH used a Burkan rocket against Israeli sites for the first time in this conflict according to LH-affiliated Al Mayadeen re-reporting Israeli media.[42] The Burkan has a 400kg warhead and a range of five kilometers.[43] CTP-ISW cannot independently confirm the type of rocket used. LH also claimed to detonate pre-planted explosives along the Israel-Lebanon border wall and fence, creating gaps.[44] LH published two video compilations of the group’s attacks on Israeli communication towers and military infrastructure on November 2 and 4.[45] Israeli forces continued retaliatory attacks targeting LH anti-tank missile squads and conducted airstrikes on LH infrastructure in Lebanon including rocket warehouses. [46]\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDemonstrate the capability and willingness of Iran and the Axis of Resistance to escalate against the United States and Israel on multiple fronts\n\nSet conditions to fight a regional war on multiple fronts\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—an umbrella group of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed responsibility for three attacks targeting US forces in Iraq between November 3 and 4. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed 32 attacks targeting US forces in the Middle East since October 18. CENTCOM has not commented on the claimed attacks at the time of publication. CTP-ISW cannot independently verify these claims.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed a rocket attack targeting US forces stationed at Abu Hajar airport, Hasakah Province, Syria on November 3.[47] The group claimed that the rockets successfully hit their targets. [48]\n\nThis is the third attack the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed targeting Abu Hajar airport in Syria.[49]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed a drone attack targeting US forces stationed at al Harir airbase, Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan on November 3.[50] The group claimed it fired two drones at the airbase and that both successfully hit their target.[51] This is the third attack on the Harir airbase the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed since October 18.[52]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed a rocket attack targeting US forces stationed at al Shaddadi base, Hasakah Province, Syria on November 4.[53] The group fired three rockets at al Shaddadi according to the head of local Syrian news outlet Deir ez Zor 24.[54] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed that its rockets were successful in hitting their target.[55]\n\nRegional Battle Map\n\nIranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian held separate phone calls with his Brazilian and British counterparts on November 3 and 4.[56] Abdollahian called for further humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and urged Brazil to introduce another Israel-Hamas war ceasefire resolution in the UN Security Council during his phone call with the Brazilian foreign minister. Abdollahian again called for humanitarian aid and a ceasefire and claimed that the United States was “spreading flames of war” during his phone call with the British foreign secretary. Abdollahian’s effort to frame the United States as an antagonist in the war and portray Iran as the promoter of peace is consistent with the regime’s ongoing information operation to deflect responsibility for any further escalation of the conflict away from Iran, as CTP-ISW previously reported.[57]\n\nIran Update, November 3, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps.\n\nAshka Jhaveri, Andie Parry, Brian Carter, Annika Ganzeveld, Kathryn Tyson, Sydney White, Riley Bailey and Frederick W.

IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the IDF is encircling Gaza City from the air land, and sea.[1] Fighting continued behind the Israeli forward line of advance in the central Gaza Strip, however. The al Qassem Brigades—the militant wing of Hamas—claimed responsibility for attacking IDF forces in the northwest, northeast, and south of Gaza City.[2] The al Qassem Brigades used anti-tank munitions and their intricate network of tunnels underneath the Gaza Strip to ambush IDF forces.[3] They also used rockets and mortars to attack IDF vehicles and infantry near the Erez military checkpoint on the northern border.[4] The al Quds Brigades—the militant wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—claimed to fire artillery at advancing IDF vehicles along the coast.[5] The al Quds Brigades military spokesmen said his fighters fired anti-tank munitions at Israeli vehicles and thwarted a maritime landing attempt west of Gaza City.[6] A Palestinian journalist reported clashes in the Zaytoun and Shujaia neighborhoods southeast of Gaza City on November 3.[7] Palestinian militias have attacked IDF forces and vehicles in Zaytoun neighborhood since October 30 as the IDF attempts to clear territory south of the city.[8]\n\nHamas and PIJ are coordinating attacks on IDF ground forces in the Gaza Strip. The al Qassem Brigades conducted an attack against IDF ground forces northwest of Gaza City on November 3 with artillery support from the al Quds Brigades.[9] Hamas and PIJ leadership have coordinated throughout the war in bilateral planning meetings. [10] The tactical coordination on the ground and coordination at the senior level is consistent with the reality that the IDF is facing a coalition of several Palestinian militias in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe IDF said its forces recently took over a Hamas military stronghold used by Nukhba–a naval special forces unit of Hamas’ militant wing–and Hamas’ operational intelligence headquarters in Jabaliya.[11] The Assistant to the Israeli director of military intelligence said that Jabaliya is a hub of Hamas’ tunnel network used for weapons stockpiles, rocket firing positions, and tunnels leading to the coast.[12] The IDF is degrading Hamas’ naval capabilities, which Hamas could use to target Israeli gas rigs and other infrastructure, according to an Israeli journalist.[13] Palestinian militants continued to operate in Jabaliya. The al Quds Brigades claimed to engage IDF forces at a “close distance” east of Jabaliya.[14]\n\nPalestinian militias in the Gaza Strip conducted indirect fire attacks into Israeli territory, primarily in Southern Israel. Palestinian militias in the Gaza Strip conducted indirect fire attacks into Israel at a decreased rate on November 3. The al Qassem Brigades claimed responsibility for four indirect fire attacks.[15] The al Quds Brigades claimed responsibility for another four indirect fire attacks. The al Quds Brigades’ indirect fire targeted Israeli military concentrations in three locations adjacent to the Gaza Strip.[16] The National Resistance Brigades—the militant wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)—claimed one indirect fire attack into southern Israel.[17]\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank and fix them there\n\nCTP-ISW recorded 12 separate clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the West Bank on November 3. CTP-ISW also recorded 10 instances of IED attacks against Israeli forces in the West Bank, which is an increase compared with the daily average of IED attacks in the area over the past week. The Tulkarm Battalion of the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed IED attacks against Israeli forces in four locations in Tulkarm on November 3.[18] The Tulkarm Battalion of the al Quds Brigades engaged Israeli forces with small arms and IEDs in Tulkarm at the same time as the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades’ attack on November 3, indicating possible coordination between the groups.[19] The al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and al Quds Brigades previously conducted combined attacks in Tulkarm on October 30.[20]\n\nPalestinian militants engaged Israeli forces in small arms and IED attacks in the Jenin refugee camp overnight on November 2-3 amid Israeli arrest raids.[21] The Jenin Brigade of the al Quds Brigades claimed it conducted small arms and IED attacks on Israeli forces on November 3, presumably in Jenin, though the brigade did not indicate where the attacks occurred.[22] The IDF conducted an airstrike which it said killed multiple militants in the Jenin refugee camp on November 3.[23] The IDF also dropped leaflets calling for West Bank residents not to work with Hamas and other militant groups.[24] The attacks came after West Bank residents in Jenin and Tulkarm broadcasted a speech by al Qassem Brigades spokesperson Abu Obaida on November 2, who said its fighters would ”make the enemy pay.”[25]\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel and fix them there\n\nSet conditions for successive campaigns into northern Israel\n\nLebanese Hezbollah and other Axis of Resistance militias conducted three attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel on November 3, including one attack using a one-way attack drone. LH claimed two attacks, including a one-way attack drone targeting Israeli forces near Mt. Dov.[26] The IDF reported that the drone attack wounded two soldiers, and that the IDF targeted an LH military position with an airstrike in response.[27] Unspecified militants also fired an anti-tank guided missile targeting an Israeli military site near Manara.[28]\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDemonstrate the capability and willingness of Iran and the Axis of Resistance to escalate against the United States and Israel on multiple fronts\n\nSet conditions to fight a regional war on multiple fronts\n\nLH Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah’s November 3 speech supports a long-running Iranian and Axis of Resistance information operation that claims Israeli actions are an extension of US policy.[29] Nasrallah said that the United States is “completely responsible\" for Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip.[30] He added that to avert US involvement in the war, Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip must cease.[31] Nasrallah also threatened that if the war expands, the United States will suffer the most and “endure the greatest losses.”[32] This information operation is implicitly threatening that LH will expand the war if the United States does not constrain Israeli ground operations. Nasrallah’s threats and the information operation are consistent with Iran's and its so-called Axis of Resistance’s objectives. We assess these objectives to be (1) deter Israel from trying to destroy Hamas in the Gaza Strip, (2) prevent Israel from destroying Hamas if deterrence fails, and (3) deter the United States from providing military support for Israel’s ground operation in the Gaza Strip.[33]\n\nNasrallah also identified halting the fighting in Gaza and securing a victory for Hamas in the region as LH’s two primary objectives as part of his justification for failing to increase support to Hamas. Nasrallah said that LH seeks to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure a victory for Hamas, which he claims would further the interests of the people of the region.[34] Nasrallah justified the relatively low-level of support that LH has provided for Hamas by arguing that LH has successfully fixed large numbers of Israeli forces on the Israel-Lebanon border.[35] Nasrallah noted that any further LH actions depend on Israeli operations in Gaza, adding that ”all options are on the table.”[36] These statements are consistent with CTP’s assessment of LH’s activity on the Israel-Lebanon border, which aims to draw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel while setting conditions for successive campaigns into Israel.[37]\n\nIranian state media widely covered Nasrallah’s speech on November 3.\n\nState-controlled outlets primarily focused on Nasrallah’s threats to US assets and forces in the region, warnings about the expansion of the war to new fronts, and claims that the Al Aqsa Flood Operation was “100 percent” a Palestinian initiative.[38] The Iranian regime, like Nasrallah, has in recent weeks accused the United States of being directly involved in the war.[39] The regime has additionally set informational conditions to blame the United States and Israel for any further escalation of the war, as CTP-ISW previously reported.[40]\n\nIRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency framed Nasrallah’s speech as marking the opening of a new front against Israel that can “inflict a final blow on the Israeli military and government.”[41] This framing differed from other Iranian media coverage of Nasrallah’s speech in that it framed the speech itself as an escalation, rather than as a warning of future escalation. Fars notably published this statement approximately 10 minutes after the conclusion of Nasrallah’s speech.\n\nIranian officials and media emphasized Israel’s “fear” of Nasrallah and LH on November 3. Tabriz, East Azerbaijan Friday Prayer Leader Mohammad Ali al Hashim stated that Nasrallah “terrifies” Israel, which he described as a “victory.”[42] Al Hashim added that Israel’s “fear” of Nasrallah underscores the “high importance of Nasrallah in equations in West Asia and even in the world.” Iranian media separately recirculated Israeli reporting that LH is waging a “psychological war” against Israel and that the IDF had been in “full alert” and “on standby” ahead of Nasrallah’s speech.[43]\n\nIranian media highlighted Iranians’ support for Nasrallah. Raisi administration-affiliated IRNA reported that “thousands” of Iranians gathered in Tehran on November 3 to support Palestinians and watch Nasrallah’s speech.[44] Fars similarly reported that university students gathered near the former US Embassy in Tehran to watch Nasrallah’s speech.[45] Various state-controlled outlets livestreamed Nasrallah’s speech on November 3.\n\nHarakat Hezbollah al Nubja (HHN) leader Akram al Kaabi released a statement on November 3 in reaction to Nasrallah’s speech stating that the Iraqi resistance is ready to participate in the Israel-Hamas war with ground forces.[46] Kaabi said Iraqi ground forces can take on Israel side-by-side with Palestinian and Lebanese militias. Kaabi also affirmed that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq’s battle with American forces is an existential battle and will not end without total liberation. Kaabi previously announced on November 1 that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq would liberate Iraq by military force and to expect greater attacks.[47]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed two attacks inside Israel on October 3, the group’s first time attacking outside Iraq and Syria. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed to attack vital Israeli infrastructure on the coast on the Dead Sea with unspecified weapons.[48] The group also claimed an unspecified attack on the Israeli Red Sea city of Eilat in response to Israeli attacks against Palestinian civilians.[49] The Al Qassem Brigades reposted the Islamic Resistance in Iraq’s Eilat claim.[50] Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it would start a new phase of confrontation next week that will be more severe and wider across the region.[51]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq also claimed responsibility for a one-way drone attack targeting US forces in Iraq on November 3. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed it launched two drones targeting US forces near the Erbil International Airport in Iraqi Kurdistan and achieved “direct hits.”[52] Reuters cited two security sources reporting that US forces shot down two drones targeting the al Harir base, which is a separate location thirty miles north of Erbil International Airport.[53] The US Department of Defense stated on November 2 that there had been 28 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17.[54]\n\nAn Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)-linked Mahan Air flight purportedly transporting shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles (MANPADs) landed at the Russian Hmeimim military airport in northern Syria from Tehran on November 2.[55] Israeli media said that the airplane carried five tons of weapons and arrived at the airport, which it said appears to provide a safe cover for the IRGC.[56] Four trucks carried the plane’s cargo to central and southern Syria, according to local opposition media.[57] CTP-ISW cannot corroborate or verify these claims. Sources at Hmeimim Airport reported to opposition media that Russia agreed to let Iran use its military airport in Syria for weapons transfers.[58] This claim is consistent with a report from Kuwaiti newspaper al Jarida on October 2 that LH would provide weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian forces transporting Iranian weapons through Syria to LH in Lebanon. CTP-ISW previously reported on this supposed Iran-LH-Syria-Russia deal in detail on October 2.[59] Russia may be able to facilitate weapons shipments without risking Israeli airstrikes interdicting them. Russia and Israel have a complex relationship in Syria, as Israel has historically relied on Russia to curb Iranian activities in Syria.[60] Israel has stopped giving Russian forces advanced warning of its strikes into Israel, however.[61]\n\nWagner elements in Syria will reportedly transfer Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense systems that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has agreed to provide to Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah. (NOTE: This text also appeared in the Institute for the Study of War’s November 3 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment) CNN reported on November 3 that two people familiar with US intelligence stated that Assad agreed to provide the Russian air defense systems to Hezbollah and tasked Wagner with their delivery during joint conversations between the three actors.[62] The Wall Street Journal reported on November 2 that US intelligence indicated that Wagner itself would give the Russian air defense systems to Hezbollah.[63] Israel frequently conducts airstrikes on Iranian weapons shipments into and through Syria, and Assad may have asked Wagner to deliver the air defense systems to Hezbollah to act as a deterrent to potential Israeli interdiction efforts.[64] CTP-ISW has previously assessed that Russia may be able to facilitate weapons shipments in Syria without risking Israeli airstrikes, and the Kremlin may believe that this Israeli reticence will extend to Wagner.[65] Russia and Israel have a complex relationship in Syria, as Israel has historically relied on Russia to curb Iranian activities in Syria.[66]\n\nIranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian held separate phone calls with Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on November 3.[67] Abdollahian emphasized the readiness of Axis of Resistance members to act against Israel during his meeting with Mekdad.[68] These phone calls follow Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary Rear Admiral Ali Akbar Ahmadian’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Special Representative for Syrian Affairs Alexander Lavrentiev in Tehran on November 2.[69] Iranian media additionally recirculated on November 3 Western reporting that Israel is not giving Russian forces advanced warning of its strikes into Syria.[70]\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Shia al Sudani removed two professional, experienced military commanders on November 1, possibly due to pressure from the Iranian-backed Shia Coordination Framework. Sudani removed Counter-Terrorism Service commander LTG Abdul Wahhab al Saadi and Baghdad Operations Commander LTG Ahmed Salim Bahjat, replacing them with experienced CTS LTG Karim Abboud Mohammed and former Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki-linked MG Walid Khalifa al Tamimi respectively.[71] An Iraqi political analyst said that the sackings were due to “political influences,“ adding that the Shia Coordination Framework fears the CTS after it conducted raids targeting Iranian-backed factions under former Prime Minister Mustafa al Kadhimi.[72] The analyst added that the Framework is attempting to ”control” the CTS and that ”those in power” are fearful of a CTS-led coup.[73]\n\nThe Secretary General of the Iraqi Defense Ministry issued instructions to the Iraqi Army Chief of Staff on October 28 to ensure troop and materiel readiness on account of the rapidly changing security situation.[74] The leaked letter instructed forces to protect weapons and ammunition depots, to repair all military equipment and weapons, and secure barracks and bases, and advised additional intelligence collection against future threats.\n\nIranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian is continuing to coordinate politically with senior Hamas leadership. Abdollahian held a phone call with Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh on November 2, marking the fourth time Abdollahian and Haniyeh have discussed the Israel-Hamas war since October 7.[75] Iranian media did not provide details of what Abdollahian and Haniyeh discussed. Their phone call notably comes amid IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari’s November 2 announcement that Haniyeh is slated to travel to Tehran.[76] Iranian diaspora and anti-regime media recirculated Hagari’s announcement, although state-controlled outlets have not responded to or denied the announcement.[77]\n\nAnti-regime outlet Iran International claimed on November 3 that senior Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba (HHN) commanders are in Tehran.[78] CTP cannot independently verify this claim, although it is entirely plausible that HHN commanders are coordinating their actions vis-à-vis the Israel-Hamas war with Iranian officials. HHN has previously attacked US forces in Iraq and is affiliated with the Iranian-backed militia Asaib Ahl al Haq, which is a member of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.[79] HHN was one of three Iranian-backed militias that released a statement on November 1 signaling that they may escalate against US forces in Iraq and Syria, as CTP-ISW previously reported.[80]\n\nIran Update, November 2, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps\n\nBrian Carter, Ashka Jhaveri, Kathryn Tyson, Johanna Moore, Amin Soltani, Christina Harward, and Nicholas Carl\n\nInformation Cutoff: 2:00 pm EST\n\nIran Update, October 29, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps\n\nAshka Jhaveri, Johanna Moore, Amin Soltani, and Nicholas Carl\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nThe al Qassem Brigade—the militant wing of Hamas—likely conducted a complex attack targeting the IDF at the Erez checkpoint.\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades and Saraya al Quds—the militant wing of PIJ— claimed a joint complex attack on the IDF in al Amiriya.\n\nSaraya al Quds claimed a complex attack on the IDF advancing along the Gaza coast.\n\nPalestinian militants clashed with Israeli forces and held large, anti-Israel demonstrations at their usual rate across the West Bank.\n\nIranian-backed militants, including Lebanese Hezbollah, conducted seven attacks into Israel.\n\nIranian-backed militants claimed two attacks targeting US forces in Syria.\n\nAsaib Ahl al Haq Secretary General Qais Khazali met with a Hamas delegation in Baghdad.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi gave an interview with Arabic-language outlet al Jazeera, during which he tried to rally the support of the Arab world for Iran and the Axis of Resistance in opposing Israel. This messaging is likely meant to support the Iranian effort to disrupt Israeli normalization with Arab states by concentrating attention on Israel-Palestinian relations.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nErode the will of Israeli political establishment and public to launch and sustain a major ground operation into the Gaza Strip\n\nDegrade IDF material and morale around the Gaza Strip\n\nThe al Qassem Brigade—the militant wing of Hamas—likely conducted a complex attack targeting the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at the Erez checkpoint on October 29. Militants from the al Qassem Brigades infiltrated Israeli territory via a tunnel west of the checkpoint before clashing with the IDF.[1] LH-affiliated media reported that the militants fired an anti-armor munition at Israeli vehicles at the checkpoint, killing several soldiers. The IDF reported that it “killed several and wounded others,” but did not provide further details.[2] The al Qassem Brigades claimed a rocket and mortar attack in the surrounding area to prevent support from reaching Israeli forces at Erez.[3] Hamas leader Ismail Radwan claimed that al Qassem Brigades militants closed on the checkpoint and engaged in small arms clashes with IDF forces.[4] CTP-ISW has not recorded independent confirmation of the clash or other tactical details.\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades and Saraya al Quds—the militant wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)— claimed a joint complex attack on the IDF in al Amiriya on October 29.[5] The al Qassem Brigades claimed to ambush IDF forces advancing south towards Beit Lahia Yasin, using anti-tank rocket launchers, indirect fire, and snipers.[6] The al Qassem Brigades also claimed to attack the advancing forces using an al Zawari one-way attack drone.[7] Saraya al Quds separately claimed that its militants and the al Qassem Brigades conducted a joint indirect fire attack on IDF forces as they advanced towards Beit Lahia.[8] Palestinian media also claimed unidentified militants engaged in small arms fire with the IDF near Umm al Nasr Village, north of Beit Lahia.[9]\n\nCTP-ISW has recorded several interactions between Hamas and PIJ, which suggest they are coordinating attacks into Israel. LH Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah held a coordination and planning meeting with Hamas Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Saleh al Arouri and PIJ Secretary General Ziyad al Nakhalah in Beirut on October 24[10]. Additionally, PIJ- and Hamas-affiliated militias in the West Bank coordinated small arms clashes during the war.[11]\n\nSaraya al Quds claimed a complex attack on the IDF advancing along the Gaza coast, injuring two on October 29. Saraya al Quds claimed that militants fired two waves of rocket and mortar attacks on advancing troops between October 28 and 29 and engaged in small arms clashes on October 29.[12] The IDF Air Force provided air cover and support for IDF soldiers advancing along the Gaza Strip coast from As Saifa. The IDF Air Force targeted and destroyed Hamas military buildings, anti-tank positions, observation posts, and unspecified military infrastructure.[13]\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades claimed an anti-tank guided missile attack on an IDF convoy east of Shujaiya, Gaza Strip.[14] The group released a video of the attack reportedly showing a Russian-made Kornet missile munition hit an Israeli armored personnel carrier.\n\nIRGC-affiliated Tasnim News Agency claimed that Palestinian militants ambushed an IDF unit attempting to cross into Gaza Strip east of Rafah.[15] Tasnim reported that the militants forced the IDF to retreat after three hours of fighting, citing its own unspecified sources. CTP-ISW cannot independently verify this report.\n\nIsraeli Ground Operations in the Gaza Strip\n\nCTP-ISW has refined its representation of the IDF clearing operations in the Gaza Strip. This change reflects new data collected on October 29 rather than new developments.\n\nPalestinian and Axis of Resistance media reported that the IDF attempted to advance westward into the Gaza Strip and toward Beit Hanoun.[16] The sources claimed that Palestinian militants destroyed two Merkava tanks and repelled the IDF advance. The IDF has not reported on any advance to the east of Beit Hanoun. CTP-ISW cannot independently verify these claims.\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank and fix them there\n\nPalestinian militants clashed with Israeli forces and held large, anti-Israel demonstrations at their usual rate across the West Bank on October 29. CTP-ISW recorded nine distinct clashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces. CTP-ISW recorded three instances of Palestinian militants using IEDs, which has become increasingly common since October 18. CTP-ISW recorded three anti-Israel demonstrations in major cities across the West Bank, including Tulkarm, Bethlehem, Jenin, and Nablus. The Palestinian Ministry of Health claimed that Israeli security forces shot and killed three Palestinians on October 29.[17] It is noteworthy that there has been no significant inflection in anti-Israel activity in the West Bank since the IDF began ground operations in the Gaza Strip on October 27.\n\nGrowing violence between Palestinian militants and Israeli settlers could drive greater anti-Israel activity in the West Bank. The al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade claimed to attack the Israeli settlement of Aveni Hevetz, targeting settlers and homes.[18] The attack follows Iranian and Hamas rhetoric describing Israeli settlers in the West Bank as legitimate military targets.[19] Hamas and the Axis of Resistance could exploit social tensions between local Palestinians and Israeli settlers to support the campaign to foment unrest and thereby draw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank.\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel and fix them there\n\nSet conditions for successive campaigns into northern Israel\n\nIranian-backed militants, including Lebanese Hezbollah (LH), conducted seven attacks into Israel. LH claimed two indirect fire attacks on IDF positions in northeastern Israel on October 28.[20] LH also claimed to shoot down an Israeli drone with a surface-to-surface missile.[21] The al Qassem Brigades claimed to fire two waves of rockets at Kiriyat Shimona, hitting a residential building.[22] The al Qassem Brigades last claimed to fire rockets from southern Lebanon on October 19.[23] LH almost certainly permits such attacks from southern Lebanon given the extent to which LH controls the area and coordinates with the other Iranian-backed groups operating there.\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDemonstrate the capability and willingness of Iran and the Axis of Resistance to escalate against the United States and Israel on multiple fronts\n\nSet conditions to fight a regional war on multiple fronts\n\nIranian-backed militants claimed two attacks targeting US forces in Syria on October 29. This is the 28th attack targeting US forces in the Middle East since October 18.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—an umbrella group for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed a one-way drone attack targeting US forces stationed at al Shaddadi, Hasaka Province, Syria on October 29.[24] The group stated that it launched two drones at the base and claimed that both hit their intended target. CENTCOM has not confirmed or denied the attack occurred. CTP-ISW cannot independently verify the claim.\n\nUnidentified Iranian-backed militias conducted a rocket strike targeting US forces stationed near al Omar Oil Field, Hasaka Province, Syria according to local news outlet Deir ez Zor 24.[25] The attack was reportedly in retaliation for US strikes on IRGC military facilities in eastern Syria on October 26.[26]\n\nAsaib Ahl al Haq (AAH) Secretary General Qais Khazali met with a Hamas delegation in Baghdad on October 29.[27] The Hamas delegation included Hamas’ senior representative to Lebanon Osama Hamdan and a member of Hamas’ Office of Arab and Islamic Relations Mohammad al Hafi. Khazali and the Hamas delegation discussed the Israel-Hamas war and reaffirmed the delegation of Iraqi militia support for the Palestinian militias fighting Israel. Khazali has previously threatened to conduct attacks on US forces in the Middle East should the United States intervene in the Israel-Hamas war.[28] AAH is a member of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has claimed 24 of the 28 attacks on US forces since October 18.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi gave an interview with Arabic-language outlet al Jazeera on October 28, during which he tried to rally the support of the Arab world for Iran and the Axis of Resistance in opposing Israel.[29] This messaging is likely meant to support the Iranian effort to disrupt Israeli normalization with Arab states by concentrating attention on Israel-Palestinian relations. Raisi described Israeli crimes and falsely claimed that the IDF retreated from its ground operation into the Gaza Strip, describing the alleged retreat as a great military failure. Raisi also stated that the Axis of Resistance is ”fed up” with Israeli ”oppression.” This Iranian messaging marks a departure from the previous Iranian rhetoric that focused primarily on lauding the success of Hamas in attacking Israel on October 7.[30] Iranian and Palestinian militant officials have previously asserted that the purpose of the October 7 attack was to disrupt Israeli efforts to normalize its relations with the Arab world.[31]\n\nRaisi separately justified further Iranian-backed attacks against US and Israeli targets during the interview. Raisi accused Israel of crossing all “red lines,” which could “force everyone to take action.” Raisi also emphasized the role of the United States in supporting Israel militarily. Members of Iran’s Axis of Resistance have repeatedly messaged that they would attack the United States and Israel if they cross their stated red lines, which included Israel conducting ground operations into the Gaza Strip and the United States providing meaningful military support to Israel.\n\nAnti-Iranian regime protests occurred in Iran on October 28 and 29 in response to the death of a young Iranian Kurdish girl. The Iranian morality police reportedly assaulted 16-year-old Armita Geravand on the Tehran subway for not properly adhering to the mandatory hijab law on October 1.[32] Geravand went into a coma after the incident and died on October 28. A medium-sized crowd gathered at her gravesite, chanting anti-regime slogans on October 29.[33]\n\nHer death parallels the circumstances that lead to the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Amini’s death sparked one of the most significant anti-regime protest waves in the history of the Islamic Republic.\n\nGeravand’s death underscores how little the regime changed its approach to policing women following the Mahsa Amini protest movement. Iranian leaders continue to refuse to grant serious concessions, such as easing the hijab requirement, to protesters and have even pursued harsher enforcement measures in recent months.[34]\n\nIran Update, October 28, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps\n\nAshka Jhaveri, Andie Parry, Annika Ganzeveld, Amin Soltani, and Nicholas Carl\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nPalestinian militias continued attacks at their usual rate from the Gaza Strip into Israel. The al Qassem Brigades claimed to fire rockets at Dimona for the first time since the war started.\n\nIsraeli ground forces advanced into the Gaza Strip. The al Qassem Brigades claimed to attack advancing IDF forces in Beit Hanoun and east of Bureij. Palestinian militias, including Hamas, are framing the IDF advances into the Gaza Strip as a failure likely to encourage civilians to stay rather than try to evacuate toward the southern part of the strip.\n\nThe Lions’ Den—a West Bank-based Palestinian militia—appeared to implicitly call for further mobilization and violence against Israel in the West Bank after the IDF conducted ground operations into the Gaza Strip. Iranian and Palestinian sources are describing Israeli settlers in the West Bank as legitimate military targets. Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli forces and held large, anti-Israel demonstrations at their usual rate across the West Bank.\n\nIranian-backed militants, including Lebanese Hezbollah, conducted 12 attacks into Israel as part of an ongoing attack campaign targeting IDF radar and sensor sites and military targets.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed to attack US forces at al Tanf Garrison in eastern Syria.\n\nIran is conducting a messaging campaign (1) to signal to the United States the potential for further Iranian-backed attacks against US forces in the region and (2) to reassure members of its Axis of Resistance, especially LH, of Iran’s commitment to supporting them in the event that the United States enters the war in support of Israel.\n\nIRGC-affiliated media is continuing to provide the informational cover for Iran and the Axis of Resistance to conduct attacks against US positions on the false grounds that the United States is directing Israeli operations into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIran Update, October 27, 2023\n\nClick here to read the full report with maps\n\nAndie Parry, Ashka Jhaveri, Annika Ganzeveld, Brian Carter, and Peter Mills\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nPalestinian militias in the Gaza Strip conducted rocket attacks into Israel at roughly half their usual rate on October 27.\n\nThe IDF conducted five raids into the Gaza Strip on October 27, and IDF ground forces will expand their operations overnight.\n\nPalestinian militants clashed with Israeli security forces across the West Bank at a higher rate on October 27, amid Israeli arrest raids.\n\nIranian-backed militants, including Lebanese Hezbollah (LH), resumed attacks as part of an ongoing attack campaign targeting IDF radar and sensor sites and military targets.\n\nThe United States conducted two self-defense airstrikes targeting “IRGC-affiliated targets” in response to drone and rocket attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi movement conducted a drone attack targeting southern Israel on October 27.\n\nIran and its Axis of Resistance are continuing to signal their willingness and capability to escalate against the United States and Israel from multiple fronts.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nErode the will of Israeli political establishment and public to launch and sustain a major ground operation into the Gaza Strip\n\nDegrade IDF material and morale around the Gaza Strip\n\nPalestinian militias in the Gaza Strip conducted rocket attacks into Israel at roughly half their usual rate on October 27.[1] The al Qassem Brigades—Hamas’ militant wing—claimed responsibility for five indirect fire attacks.[2] Three of these attacks targeted Tel Aviv and injured several Israeli civilians there.[3] Saraya al Quds—the militant wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—claimed responsibility for six rocket attacks, including an attack using a Badr-3 rocket on Ashkelon.[4] The Badr-3 rocket is produced in Gaza and has a 400 kilogram warhead, whereas Palestinian militias most frequently fire Qassem rockets with five kilograms of explosives.[5] Axis of Resistance-affiliated media reported one unclaimed anti-tank munition attack on Israeli forces.[6]\n\nIsraeli Ground Operations in the Gaza Strip\n\nThe IDF conducted five raids into the Gaza Strip on October 27, and IDF ground forces will expand their operations overnight.[7] The IDF 13th Fleet deployed a tactical unit, ships, and aircraft in a naval raid on Rafah beach in the southern Gaza Strip on October 27.[8] An IDF spokesperson stated that the unit ”destroyed terrorist infrastructures of the Hamas terrorist organization and operated in a compound used by the organization's naval commando forces.”[9] The IDF 36th Division also conducted a raid into central Gaza near Shujayyah using infantry, armor, and engineering units supported by helicopter gunships.[10] The IDF stated the Shujayyah operation had dozens of targets including anti-tank guided missile launch positions and Hamas operational headquarters and militants.[11] Axis media and social media users reported three other armed clashes between Palestinian militias and IDF troops in central and northern Gaza.[12] The IDF spokesperson disclosed IDF group operations in the Gaza Strip will intensify overnight.[13]\n\nThe al Qassem Brigades and Axis media incorrectly framed the naval raid engagement as a success for its militants by claiming they forced an IDF withdrawal and air engagement.[14] US military doctrine defines a raid as “an operation to temporarily seize an area in order to secure information, confuse an enemy, capture personnel or equipment, or to destroy a capability culminating with a planned withdrawal.”[15] The IDF withdrawal after the operation is consistent with the US military doctrinal definition of a raid, which includes a planned retrograde at the end of the mission. The IDF used air support to assist their elements’ withdrawal during the naval raid.[16]\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward the West Bank and fix them there\n\nHamas leadership is urgently calling for further resistance in the West Bank. Hamas Political Bureau leader Ismail Haniyeh called for louder condemnation of Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.[17] Haniyeh claimed on October 7 that the Al Aqsa Flood Operation began in the Gaza Strip and will extend to the West Bank.[18] A cybersecurity monitoring group said it had observed the largest single internet disruption in the Gaza Strip since hostilities began, amounting to a “total or near total blackout of internet service.”[19] Hamas Political Bureau member Hussam Badran made an urgent appeal to people in the West Bank that “this is the time for weapons.”[20]\n\nHamas and PIJ claimed their militants died while confronting IDF forces in Jenin. Saraya al Quds mourned a prominent field commander in its Jenin Battalion who died “supporting Gaza” in Jenin.[21] Hamas mourned three militants who died in clashes in the West Bank in Jenin and Qalqiya.[22] Ismail Haniyeh noted that the martyrs of the al Qassem Brigades are the same as Saraya al Quds Brigades and LH throughout the country in a speech on October 26.[23]\n\nPalestinian militants clashed with Israeli security forces across the West Bank at a higher rate on October 27, amid Israeli arrest raids. The IDF, Shin Bet, and Border Police forces arrested 36 Palestinians, including 17 Hamas operatives, in the West Bank. Israel is dismantling Hamas and PIJ command structures in the West Bank.[24] The Palestinian Authority reported that four Palestinians died overnight during Israeli raids in the West Bank.[25]\n\nISW recorded 14 distinct clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces across the West Bank. Saraya Al Quds-Tubas Brigade used an explosive device during clashes with IDF forces in Tubas.[26] CTP-ISW recorded two other instances of Palestinians using IEDs in the northern West Bank.[27]\n\nCTP-ISW recorded eight anti-Israel demonstrations, a majority of which occurred after the internet cuts in the Gaza Strip. Hamas and the PIJ-affiliated Quds News Network reported on their Telegram pages that there are calls for marches in all areas of the West Bank and Jerusalem following the interruption of communication in the Gaza Strip.[28] Palestinians in Ramallah chanted “if you have a rifle, you should either kill a Jew or give it to Hamas.”[29]\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance campaign objectives:\n\nDraw IDF assets and resources toward northern Israel and fix them there\n\nSet conditions for successive campaigns into northern Israel\n\nIranian-backed militants, including Lebanese Hezbollah (LH), resumed attacks as part of an ongoing attack campaign targeting IDF radar and sensor sites and military targets. LH claimed six anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) attacks on IDF positions along the border with Lebanon on October 27. This is consistent with its rate of attacks prior to October"
