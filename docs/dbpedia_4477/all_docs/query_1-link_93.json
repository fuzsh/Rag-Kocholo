        "text": "This file is an attempt to list all known cemeteries in Rockland County, past and present, active and abandoned. They are listed by TOWN, then by VILLAGE and finally, alphabetically. It is not complete, but represents all that have been located in published information to date. Because descriptions in different sources are not always clear, there may be some duplicate listings under different names. For additional information consult the sources listed. Some sources list cemeteries and locations. Other list individual graves and birth and death dates. Different, old sources may use village names which are no longer in use, and some political sub-division names have been changed (especially in Town of Ramapo). An attempt has been made to include the old names found in old sources as well as the current names.See Resources.\n\nNew York State Law requires the Town in which an Abandoned Cemetery is located to assume ownership of the Abandoned Cemetery, and provide for protection and upkeep. In reality, this is not always the case. The office in charge is the Town Attorney's office or the Code Enforcement Officer.\n\nAdditions, corrections and other reference information is welcome and appreciated. Responses should be sent to the compiler, Robert L. Protzmann, for the Genealogical Society of Rockland County. <protzy41 optonline.net>\n\nTOWN OF HAVERSTRAW\n\nORANGETOWN\n\nRAMAPO\n\nAIRMONT\n\n123.
