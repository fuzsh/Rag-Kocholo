        "text": "The Parks Coalition is a community of 29 park groups working on empowering and developing a more sustainable Jersey City community. Every day, these Jersey City park groups are able to bring the community together through serving the recreational needs of residents and by providing a mechanism of recuperation from the stresses and strains of urban life. Through initiatives such as City of Trees with it’s Tree Lover’s Crew, these open spaces are also being utilized to bring awareness about the City’s depleted tree canopy and what community members can do to help with this decline by learning how to maintain their local trees and encouraging residents to plant more trees.\n\nFriends of Arlington Park | Arlington Park encompasses 3.52 acres, is located in Ward F on Grand Street and Arlington Avenue. It is primarily a passive park with large lawn panels and mature trees.\n\nFriends of Audubon Park | Audubon Park occupies the entire city block fronting Kennedy Boulevard to the west, Stegman Street to the south, Audubon Avenue to the north, and Bergen Avenue to the east and is named for the adjacent Audubon Avenue. Originally known as Kilpatrick Street, Audubon Avenue started as a small country lane running west from Bergen Avenue. The narrow road provided carts and wagons with access to the numerous small farms and greenhouses that once prospered in the neighborhood. The name Audubon Avenue first appears on maps and other official records around the turn of the twentieth century. Presumably, the street name was chosen in honor of the work of the famous naturalist and painter John James Audubon (1785-1851), although there is no known connection between him and the area.\n\nBergen Hill Park Association | Bergen Hill\n\nThe Bergen Hill Park Association’s goal is to preserve and extend parks and green open areas in Jersey City.

With Journal Square woefully underserved in terms of public parks the Courthouse Park Advocacy Group sees this as the time to shape the vision of the 2060 plan in a way that best serves the community.\n\nOur group is committed to work with Jersey City and Hudson County officials to come up with funding solutions and ownership issues for the future park. We want to bring together all, neighborhood organizations, local businesses and developers to participate in making our park a reality.\n\nThe Embankment | Harsimus Branch and Embankment\n\nTheir Vision:\n\nCare for the environment is this century’s greatest challenge – and Jersey City’s greatest opportunity. Thoughtful treatment of the Harsimus Branch can set a precedent for cities around the world, demonstrating that a healthy ecology and infrastructure are compatible, not competitors.\n\nThe meadows and forest that took root decades ago on the historic Embankment rail structure, in the midst of downtown Jersey City, is unique to our city. We know of no other city in the world that has a self-seeded forest running through its downtown. This upland forest is thriving, its habitat part of a wildlife corridor from the Hudson River to the Hackensack.\n\nThe Embankment Coalition vision for the Harsimus Branch and its Embankment preserves much of this forest and opens it to Jersey City residents for sensitive reuse. While part of the corridor is reserved for possible future light rail, residents can enjoy, on foot and by bike, a naturally occurring wilderness in their own backyards.\n\nJones Park Association | Enos Jones Park\n\nEnos Jones Park is a six-acre public park that provide residents with many active and recreational zones.

With its 200-year-old English Ivy adorning many of the towering trees, and the monumental works of art, this 6-acre sanctuary of peace and unique history is one of the most beautiful natural settings in Jersey City.\n\nThe Jersey City Reservoir Preservation Alliance | The Jersey City Reservoir is a beautiful lake surrounded by trees and meadow-topped walls in the center of the Jersey City Heights. Since Jersey City discontinued use of the Reservoir for drinking water twenty years ago, nature has reclaimed the Reservoir area. Walking up the old stone steps today, one gets the opportunity to step out of our hectic world and into an oasis of quiet. Closed in with high stone walls, this “hidden jewel” is a stunning example of wildlife in this very urban area. Great blue heron, swallows, peregrine falcons, and numerous other birds find a haven here, and the residents of Jersey City, from students to seniors, would reap incalculable benefit from keeping this natural oasis alive and protected.The Reservoir stands just south of Pershing Field Park in the Heights section of Jersey City.

Opened in 1905, it was originally known as West Side Park. The park was designed by Daniel W. Langton and Charles N. Lowrie, both founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects.\n\nThe park consists of two distinct sections: Lincoln Park East, 150.4 acres, and Lincoln Park West, 123 acres. The sections are named for their positions relative to U.S. Route 1/9 Truck, which passes between them and are connected by foot and vehicular bridges over the highway. The Lincoln Park Nature Walk is part of wetlands restoration project adjacent to the Hackensack River. The Hackensack RiverWalk is a partially completed greenway along the banks of the river running the length of the Hudson County shoreline.

After the armory building was destroyed in 1927, the arch was reconstructed at Pershing Field and provides a dramatic entrance to the passive side of the park. Both the Arch and the old Armory trace their history to that of the city’s Fourth National Guard Regiment whose origin goes back to just after the Civil War.\n\nOn July 22, 2017, the Tree Lovers Crew volunteered to take care of the trees lining the park.

Joseph Anthony was a young boy who played ball in an empty lot across the street from his home on 87 Palisade Ave. He perfected his pitch as a star player on the Dickinson High School baseball team — enough to get the attention of the Dodgers and the Giants, who offered him contracts at the age of 18. At the time the country was immersed in World War II and he turned down those offers to heed the call of the Army Air Corps. He served as a tail gunner on the crew of a B-29.\n\nHe never returned to the site of his childhood pastimes after losing his life in 1944 on a mission at Paulaw in the Admiralty Islands in the South Pacific during the final days of World War II. At the time of his death, he had already been cited for bravery and flown 39 missions. He is one of the countless soldiers from Jersey City who never returned home from war and whose families seek a way to remember and celebrate their lives.\n\nThe once empty lot was converted into a park on May 1, 1949, and named Sgt. Anthony Park in his honor. Today the park is alive with visits from neighborhood families and local residents who go to enjoy the basketball court, dog run, community garden, and playground.\n\nFriends of Skyway Park Conservancy | Skyway Park\n\nSkyway Park is located along the shore of the Hackensack River, under the magnificent Pulaski Skyway. It is bordered on the east by Routes 1& 9, at the foot of Sip Avenue.\n\nThe 32.5 acres of Skyway Park was a dumping ground for years. On occasion, it would spontaneously erupt into flames due to the drums of toxic waste that were illegally buried below the surface. After an initial effort to remove the most dangerous contaminants succeeded, the site once again became a dumping ground, this time for abandoned car and truck bodies.\n\nIn December 2020, Jersey City held a press conference to announce that it would build a COVID Memorial in Skyway Park and move forward on developing the entire park. Throughout 2021, representatives from the city met regularly with the Skyway Park Conservancy to review plans for the park. This partnership led to a design that presents great opportunities for a large park with multiple purposes.\n\nAlong the COVID Memorial, the plan– consistent with the public input– calls for a natural and passive areas that would provide the people of the Marion neighborhood, nearby Journal Square and others easy access to enjoy the Hackensack River Waterfront.\n\nThe Skyway Park Conservancy is committed to working with JC to complete the vision of Skyway Park that includes open lawns, native plants, trails and more. Skyway Park, when completed, will also be a major part of the Hackensack River Greenway, which (eventually) will run along the river shore from Bayonne to the south through Jersey City up to Secaucus to the north.\n\nVan Vorst Park is the centerpiece of the downtown Jersey City neighborhood and historic district that bears the same name. Called “one of the most formal of Jersey City’s parks,” it was originally landscaped by a local florist and horticulturist Peter Henderson in 1851. The park has been described as an example of a town square similar to Washington Square Park in lower New York City. Occupying the entire rectangular city block between Montgomery Street, York Street, Jersey Avenue, and Barrow Street, Van Vorst Park is lined with ornate brick and brownstone rowhouses from the late 1800s that showcase a variety of popular Victorian architectural styles.\n\nThe park was renovated for $2 million in 1999 through the efforts of an association called the Friends of Van Vorst Park (FVVP). The park includes a gazebo, viewing fountain, and playground; plantings and trees provide a small verdant oasis along the walking paths. The association renovated the park according to the intended goals of its benefactor Cornelius Van Vorst: a passive, Victorian park at the center of a rapidly growing neighborhood that would honor the centuries the Van Vorst family owned and developed this area, and perhaps he also wanted to honor the soon to vanish open land itself.\n\nVillage Neighborhood Association | Village Park For over seven years the VNA and Village community have worked toward transforming the long-closed, abandoned and neglected pocket park into a reinvented open space that is unlike any Jersey City has ever seen. In the Fall of 2009, a competitive and exciting pro-bono design competition was conducted via a Request for Proposal and called for feedback and suggestions from Village residents.\n\nAt the October 2009 VNA meeting, over 60 attendees viewed four amazing visions for Village Park and overwhelmingly selected Future Green Studio for an imaginative modern design that uses recycled and sustainable materials; provides playful passive sections for children; features restive, meditative elements like a central lawn, walking paths; and pays respect and homage to the neighborhood’s Italian-American heritage."
