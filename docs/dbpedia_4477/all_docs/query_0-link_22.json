        "text": "I didn’t have a particular theme in mind for this walk, just some places I wanted to see, specifically the Weeksville Heritage Center and a lot of knock-your-socks-off late 19th-century architecture. I saw all that, and more, on this warm but pleasant day.\n\nThe walk started at the busy subway station at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, connecting to several bus lines and the hub of the Utica Avenue commercial corridor. Several peddlers set up shop by the subway entrance. Walking east on Eastern Parkway, it didn’t take long to get away from the commerce. Between Rochester Avenue and Buffalo Avenue, a couple of houses with front porches caught my eye.\n\nBetween St. Marks Avenue and Bergen Street is the Weeksville Heritage Center. Weeksville was a community of people freed from slavery after slavery was abolished in New York in 1827. From their website:\n\nWeeksville Heritage Center is an historic site and cultural center in Central Brooklyn that uses education, arts and a social justice lens to preserve, document and inspire engagement with the history of Weeksville, one of the largest free Black communities in pre-Civil War America, and the Historic Hunterfly Road Houses.\n\nA handsome, understated modern building on Buffalo Avenue is the entrance to Weeksville. The grounds outside the building have sculptures, and a path follows the route of old Hunterfly Road. The old road was obliterated by the street grid in this part of Brooklyn. The Hunterfly Road houses were built around 1830. Weeksville became a thriving community that grew larger as African-Americans fled Manhattan during and after the draft riots of 1863. The AIA Guide to New York City, Fifth Edition, describes the houses thus:\n\nFour simple wood houses occupied by James Weeks and friends (free black men) between 1830 and 1870. The architecture, in painted clapboard, is that of the 19th-century common man. It is the City’s oldest black residential landmark.\n\nTo go from Crown Heights to Bedford-Stuyvesant one has to cross Atlantic Avenue. For most of its length, extending into Queens, it is wide, congested, and ugly. For most of its length the Long Island Rail Road runs beneath it or above it. On this walk I passed underneath it, continuing north on Rochester Avenue to Fulton Street, where I turned left, continuing to Stuyvesant Avenue, where I tuned right.\n\nBrooklyn has several street grids. Crown Heights, both north and south of Eastern Parkway, has one. Bedford-Stuyvesant has another, slightly offset from the Crown Heights grid and extending to the west into Clinton Hill and Fort Greene. A number of east-west streets merge with Fulton Street at acute angles, as far west as Downtown Brooklyn. These streets are named for generals, admirals, and presidents, with two exceptions: Hancock Street and Lexington Avenue, about which a bit more later. The intersecting avenues were named for former governors of New York; some of those streets have been renamed.\n\nTurning onto Stuyvesant Avenue, one sees beautiful houses on tree-lined streets. Again from The AIA Guide to New York City, Fifth Edition:\n\n… where Bedford-Stuyvesant has distinguished architecture, it is very good. Its façades of brownstones and brickfronts create a magnificent townscape as good - and sometimes better - than many fashionable areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan. Parts of Chauncey, Decatur, MacDonough, and Macon Streets, and the southern end of Stuyvesant Avenue, are superb. Hancock Street, between Nostrand and Tompkins Avenues, was considered a showplace in its time (late 1880s) and has been lovingly restored in recent years.\n\nAt Greene Avenue I came to Herbert Von King Park. This was not my first time there. The park was bustling with activity: people picinicking, playing with Frisbees, listening to music, or just sitting and relaxing. Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, they all enjoyed Bedford-Stuyvesant’s town square. From The NYC Parks website:\n\nAcquired in 1857 by condemnation, this park was one of the first established by the City of Brooklyn. It was originally named for Daniel D. Tompkins, an abolitionist who served four terms as governor of New York (1807-17) and two terms as vice president of the United States under James Monroe (1817-25). It was not until 1871, however, that the plan for the park was submitted by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, the designers of Prospect and Central Parks. Like most small parks of the time, Tompkins Park was planned as a public square used for ceremonies and military reviews. The designers provided for little more than border plantings of flowers and shrubs, claiming that trees and winding walks would result in the park being used, “for clandestine purposes by people of bad character.”\n\nHistorical additions to the park reflect changing uses of the site. Space was cleared in 1915 to accommodate the large crowds who turned out for concerts performed by regimental bands. A playground was built in 1927, and a public library that dates to 1915 was housed in the shelter building until it burned down in 1969. The group Tompkins Park Recreation and Cultural Association formed in the same year and mobilized to improve park facilities. Their efforts led to the 1973 opening of a new recreation center which houses the amphitheater, senior citizen and teen center, and an auditorium named after famed 20th century African American composer and musician of ragtime and jazz music, Eubie Blake. In the auditorium, a mural by artist Akwesi M. Asante depicts 50 African American icons, including Fredrick Douglass, Mayor David Dinkins, and the Jackson Five.\n\nIn 2011, the amphitheater was named in honor of Almira Kennedy Coursey (1914-1996), a lifelong educator and local resident who promoted the park’s transformation from a passive town square into a bustling center of activity in the heart of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.\n\nThis park is named for Herbert Von King (1912-1985). King was called the “Mayor of Bedford-Stuyvesant,” and was an active community leader for over 50 years.\n\nI cut diagonally across the park, exiting at Tompkins and Lafayette Avenues, then continuing to the end of the walk at Tompkins and DeKalb Avenues. Near the corner is Mount Pisgah Baptist Church, formerly St. Ambrose Roman Catholic Church (1907). This church was designed in an Italianate style with a façade copied from the Church of St. Prudentiana in Rome. The interior features a ceiling that reproduces that in the Cathedral of Pisa, with side decorations copied after those in the Cathedral of Ravenna.\n\nPelham Bay Park in the Bronx is a vast place, the largest park in New York City except for the Gateway National Recreation Area. It encompasses forests, salt marshes, athletic fields, a public golf course, and much more. Its history is tied to that of the Bartow-Pell Mansion, the endpoint of this walk. I had not been in the park in many years, and the one time I biked to the mansion, in the early 1990s, it was closed on the day I visited. So I mapped out two walking routes to the mansion, and settled on a walk from the subway in the northeast Bronx.\n\nThere is a Pelham Bay Park subway station, the terminus of the 6 train. Had I started there, I would have had a shorter walk to the mansion. Instead, I took the 5 train to the very nicely rehabilitated (and fully accessible) Gun Hill Road station. This station opened in 1912 as a local station on the New York, Westchester, and Boston Railway, closed on the last day of 1937, and reopened in 1941 with subway service.\n\nLeaving the subway station, I turned right on Gun Hill Road, continuing east (downhill), crossing Kingsland Avenue, then crossing Gun Hill Road and continuing on Bartow Avenue. The first half of this walk was uninteresting: bland, low-rise, car-centric but with a lot of bus routes. Once I passed the New England Thruway (Interstate 95), I came upon Co-op City. The largest cooperative apartment complex in the world, this was built starting in the 1960s on the site of a failed American history-themed amusement park called Freedomland U.S.A. I visited Freedomland with my brother when I was five years old and remember being very disappointed that I couldn’t take part in putting out the re-enactment of the Chicago Fire of 1871 because I wasn’t at least six years old. Freedomland lasted for only five seasons, closing for good in 1964. After the park closed, a Newsday writer called Freedomland a \"flop\" and said of many of the opening day visitors: \"They came. They saw. They left. And most never came back.\"\n\nThe AIA Guide to New York City, Fifth Edition, has such a good assessment of Co-op City that it is worth citing in full:\n\nOut in the middle of nowhere, on marshy land that was once the site of an ill-fated amusement park called Freedomland, a group of government officials, union representatives, and housing developers dreamed the impossible dream. Today the dream may better be described as a coma, From out of the pumped-sand fill rises a mountain range of 35-story residential towers, 35 of them, plus 236 clustered two-family houses and eight multistory parking garages. In addition, there are three shopping centers, a heating plant, and an educational park consisting of two public schools, two intermediate schools, and a high school. In this total non-environment, largely designed by bureaucrats with not a scintilla of wit, live some 55,000 souls, many of whom vacated sound accommodations in the West Bronx (in many cases Art Deco apartment blocks) to move here.\n\nLet’s be thankful for the landscaping. It’s the best thing at Co-op City.\n\nA short distance past the clubhouse for the Pelham Bay - Split Rock Golf Course, I crossed Shore Road to the entrance to the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum. From the museum’s website:\n\nOriginally inhabited by the Lenape since ca 1,000 A.D., Lenapehoking was acquired in 1654 by Connecticut physician Thomas Pell through treaty with five Lenni Lenape Sachem: Shawan Orochquot, Poquorum, Annoke, Wawhamkus and Mehumow that included 50,000 acres of what is today the Bronx and lower Westchester County. The property was passed briefly to the LeRoy family before Robert Bartow, a Pell descendant, and his wife, Maria Lorillard, purchased a portion in 1836 and completed the mansion by 1842. The Bartow family remained there until 1888, when the city of New York purchased the property along with many other acres that now make up Pelham Bay Park. In 1914, the city leased the site to the International Garden Club (ICG). The club hired the architectural firm Delano & Aldrich to restore the mansion and design the formal garden. The building opened as a museum in 1946, and in 2008 the ICG was renamed Bartow-Pell Conservancy.\n\nMaria Lorillard was a member of the Lorillard family, which made its fortune in tobacco. The Lorillard snuff mill, dating from the mid-19th century, still stands on the Bronx River in the New York Botanical Garden. Lorillard Place is a short street running south from East Fordham Road.\n\nA copy of the 1654 treaty is on display inside the house. There is no record of the price Thomas Pell paid for the land. His copy of the Treaty says only that the sellers received “trou valew & just Satisfaction” for the land. Westchester Historian Thomas Scharf, however, reported in 1886 that the “Indians received, it is said, as an equivalent for their deed of the land, sundry hogshead of Jamaica rum.” Thomas Pell reportedly took symbolic possession of his estate “by burying his seal with his arms at the root of the oak”. Not the first time, or the last, that the rightful owners of property would be swindled by white people.\n\nThe house is designed in the Greek Revival style. The first and second floors are open to the public; owing to the lack of a handrail on the ascending side of the stairs, I limited my visit to the first floor. The house is grand but restrained, and is not huge.\n\nThe Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, just southwest of JFK Airport, was created in the 1950s by New York City’s Department of Parks and Recreation Commissioner Robert Moses. This site became part of the National Park Service in 1972 when the Gateway National Recreation Area was established. It includes over 12,600 acres of water, salt marshes, freshwater and brackish water ponds, upland fields and woods, and open bay and islands. It is one of the largest bird habitats in the northeastern United States and is a great place to observe the seasonal bird migration as well as resident species. It is amazing that this place is within the city limits. Gateway also encompasses Jacob Riis Park, Fort Tilden, and Breezy Point, at the western end of the Rockaway peninsula; Floyd Bennett Field, Plumb Beach, and Canarsie Pier in Brooklyn; Fort Wadsworth, Miller Field, and Great Kills Park on Staten Island; and Sandy Hook in New Jersey.\n\nI had not been here in many years and wanted to return in part to see how accessible this walk would be. The visitor center and the entire walk are accessible but the footpath, while nearly flat, is paved with gravel. The walk is a loop around West Pond.\n\nThere is a lot of information available at the visitor center. Do stop there before starting out or before you leave.\n\nStarting out on the path, I was immediately aware how removed I was from the urban hustle and bustle. Apart from aircraft taking off from JFK, I could hear only the sound of birds and the wind. I saw only a few other people out walking. All this was therapeutic!\n\nIn 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused significant damage throughout Jamaica Bay, including the Wildlife Refuge and the nearby community of Broad Channel. What appears on the map above as an outlet from the West Pond shows where Sandy created a breach. This has been filled in since 2021 and the restoration is a work in progress.\n\nMany cities have clusters of museums and other cultural institutions that are an easy walk from one another. This is true in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, and certainly in New York. So many museums are located along Fifth Avenue across from or within Central Park that this aggregation has been nicknamed “Museum Mile.” The actual distance is more than that, from East 70 Street to East 105 Street, but it’s a catchy name. This fully accessible walk took in all of Museum Mile except the two institutions at the very northern end, the Museum of the City of New York (between 103 and 104 Streets) and El Museo del Barrio at 105 Street.\n\nThe walk started off Museum Mile, at the 72 Street subway station on Second Avenue, walking west on East 70 Street toward Fifth Avenue. The first block, to Third Avenue, is the steepest portion of the walk. East 70 Street is quiet and tree-lined, and I had the impression that a lot of the inhabitants of this area were out of town on this Saturday in high summer. At the corner of Park Avenue is the Asia Society, perhaps best known to the public for its exhibitions of Asian art. Its present home was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and Associates and opened in 1981. According to its website, “The Asia Society’s purpose is to navigate shared futures for Asia and the world across policy, arts and culture, education, sustainability, business, and technology.”\n\nOn the Central Park side of Fifth Avenue, between 80 and 84 Streets, is the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the world’s great art museums with holdings from all over the world, from over 4,000 years. It is a very well-visited place; consider going on a weekday morning outside of high tourist season and avoid the temptation to “do the Met.”\n\nThe original part of the building opened in 1880 and the Museum has grown in all directions since. The original façade is visible only from inside. The Beaux-Arts front on Fifth Avenue hides the many additions to the Museum, not least of which is the Sackler Wing at the north end, housing the ancient Egyptian Temple of Dendur, and the American Wing at the south end. The additions to the Museum are more visible from inside Central Park. The Museum will not expand beyond its present footprint, so future improvements will be within the existing space.\n\nBetween 88 and 89 Streets is another great New York institution, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. This was one of the late works of Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 - 1959) and opened shortly after his death. Wright ostentatiously hated cities but enjoyed himself living in the Plaza Hotel each year while the Guggenheim was under construction.\n\nWright’s design was criticized for being not “in keeping” with the bland phalanx of Fifth Avenue high-rises. To me that is one of the Guggenheim’s strengths; like the Frick, it opens up the streetscape but does so differently. The rotunda represents Wright coming full circle in his career. The workshop attached to his home in Oak Park, Illinois (1889) is an octagonal shape with a skylight. When I stood in that space I thought to myself, “Wow! I’m seeing the rotunda of the Guggenheim 70 years earlier.”\n\nI have found the Guggenheim to be both an excellent place, and a flawed place, to view art. The exhibition spaces along the spiral favor smaller-scale work that draws one close. This is good. But this amazing building overshadows much of the art inside it.\n\nAt 91 Street is the Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. This was built between 1898 and 1903 as a home for industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. When it was built it was well to the north of other Fifth Avenue mansions, allowing for a bigger house and a garden. Carnegie’s widow Louise lived here until her death in 1946. The Cooper and Hewitt families bequeathed their collections in the decorative arts to get the new museum going. The Smithsonian Institution took it over in 1974. One of the great exhibitions I have seen there was in the late 1990s, a retrospective of the work of industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss (1904 - 1972). Dreyfuss designed the New York Central’s premier train, the Twentieth Century Limited, in 1938 and again in 1948, as well as the familiar round Honeywell thermostat, the Princess telephone of 1959, and much else.\n\nI had forgotten I had this book. When I found it, I dusted it off and had a hard time putting it down. It is the reminiscence of Alfred Kazin (1915-1998) growing up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn in the 1920s and 1930s. Brownsville has always been where poor people live. Brownsville is not my community but I’ve biked or walked on many of the streets.\n\nThis book, first published in 1951, is more than just a story of one person’s youth. It is a keen-eyed look at the city and the people who give it life. Before parts of Brooklyn became “cool,” and since, there have been vast stretches of uncool Brooklyn, or never-was-cool Brooklyn, some like Brownsville and some not. Read this book.\n\nAlso set in this neighborhood is The Amboy Dukes, Irving Shulman’s story of a Jewish youth gang. With either of these books, think of Mordecai Richler’s The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, at a larger scale and set not in Montréal but in Brooklyn.\n\nIt is my privilege to see the city at a slow speed, not cocooned in an automobile. There is so much to see, in the built environment and in the people.\n\nWe then continued downhill on Park Avenue toward the Lincoln Tunnel entrance and the Shippen Steps, a continuation of Shippen Street. From Wikipedia:\n\nIn the past, the steps provided townspeople with access to Weehawken's original town hall, as well as the old police station, which was headquarter[ed] in the building at 309 Park Avenue. It was built in 1890, and the first floor features a jail cell where police operations occurred. The building was last used as the VFW post 1923 meeting place.In 2009, the town decided to renovate the building, which became the Weehawken Historical Society Museum. Across the street at the bottom of the steps is the granite wall which overlooks the art deco Lincoln Tunnel entrance. The Shippen steps have even been regarded as the haunted \"Steps of Weehawken\". In the mid-to-late 19th century, a pregnant woman fell down the steps, losing both her life and her child's, and in 1898, it was reported that a Shippen Street resident committed suicide at the head of the steps.\n\nFrom the top of the Shippen Steps we walked west to Palisade Avenue, then south past Hackensack Reservoir Number Two to a good lunch at Fork Hill Kitchen in Union City. Entry to the restaurant is by way of 3 steps but it is accessible once inside. We were told they have a wheelchair ramp they can deploy.\n\nMichael noticed that, in contrast to the stair streets in the Bronx, hardly anybody seems to use the stairs we climbed, that perhaps they were only for People Without Cars. It is true that in the Bronx the stair streets are generally well-used, fully part of the streetscape. The stairs in Weehawken are in excellent condition, except for the lack of a handrail at the Jefferson Steps and a missing section of handrail at the stair tower from Pershing Road to Boulevard East. It would have been nice to see more people using the stairs today. Nevertheless, it was a good walk, well worth doing through pleasant surroundings.\n\nLastly, a note of thanks to the driver of the crowded bus we boarded, who got the people sitting in the front seats to vacate them for us.\n\nSteps climbed today: 213 up, 46 down, total 259.\n\nDirectly across the Hudson River from midtown Manhattan, Weehawken, New Jersey is best known for two things: the duel in 1804 between Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and Vice-President Aaron Burr, and the western approach to the Lincoln Tunnel. Somehow I found out that Weehawken has a lot of stairs, so I went to see for myself and do some stair climbing. There are more stairs than I imagined, so after going up two stair towers with a total of 368 steps I stopped, choosing to do the rest another day.\n\nThe main part of Weehawken is up a very steep cliff from the flat lands on the riverfront. It was on these flat lands that the Burr-Hamilton duel took place. Hamilton, mortally wounded, was rowed back to New York to die. For over a century from the mid-1800s the lower part of town was taken up largely by passenger and freight railroad terminals, chief among them the West Shore Division of the New York Central. The image below shows what this looked like viewed from the top of the hill, at the intersection of Pershing Road and Boulevard East, around 1940.\n\nThe gabled building in the center of the image still exists; it is now a Mexican restaurant. And there is still a filling station where the Esso sign is.\n\nFreight trains once transferred their cars to barges to be moved across the river and around the harbor. Passengers did the same, taking ferries to the foot of West 42 Street in Manhattan. The railroad terminals are gone, replaced by the Lincoln Harbor and Port Imperial mixed-use developments, parks, and the NY Waterway ferries to Manhattan. New Jersey Transit’s Hudson-Bergen Light Rail serves this area from Hoboken and points south. North of Port Imperial station, where this walk began, the light rail uses a portion of the West Shore right-of-way, including a tunnel under Bergen Hill that includes the only underground station on the system.\n\nAt the Port Imperial station there are stairs and a clean, working elevator to an overpass leading to Port Imperial on the east and a stair tower to Pershing Road on the west. The stairs are in excellent condition but the climb is arduous: a first flight of 11 steps followed by 11 flights of 12 steps each, for a total of 143 steps.\n\nI picked a beautiful day for this walk. There is much more to see around here and more stairs to climb. Today, these two stair towers were enough. I’ll be back to Weehawken for more.\n\nAllow me a sidebar on those new super-tall towers visible in Manhattan. I’ll leave aside my distaste for them (alright, they’re disgusting). When I’m not full of bile about them, they call to mind a town in Tuscany, San Gimignano, where in the Middle Ages the leading people in town competed with each other to build tall towers in a long-running game of one-upsmanship. Most of the towers are long gone but on a visit there in 1991 I got to climb to the top of one. The view of the town and the green countryside was worth the climb. I doubt the towers on “Billionaires’ Row” will last nearly that long.\n\nThe Rockaway Peninsula is a narrow spit of land, a barrier between the Atlantic Ocean and Jamaica Bay. If you’ve looked out the window of an aircraft arriving at or departing from JFK Airport, you’ve seen it. The different communities on the peninsula are known collectively as the Rockaways.\n\nA part of New York City, the Rockaways have tidy, suburban-style houses, beach bungalows, apartment blocks facing the beach, public housing projects, and apartments built since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Generations have lived in the Rockaways and called it home.\n\nThe Long Island Rail Road built a branch across Jamaica Bay to the Rockaways in the late 19th century. New York City took over this line after the LIRR abandoned it in 1950, rebuilt it, and converted it to subway service. It is not uncommon to see someone with a surf board on a train out to the Rockaways. It’s a long subway ride from the Rockaways to Manhattan, but people make that trip every day.\n\nThis walk began at the elevated Beach 67 Street - Arverne subway station, recently refurbished and made fully accessible. The accessibility project was unexpectedly difficult but overall it’s a good job. At street level, there is a surf shop.\n\nFrom the late 19th century until World War II, Arverne was a community of beach bungalows. It was largely abandoned in the 1950s and 1960s. Various redevelopment schemes came to nothing, but starting in the early 2000s new housing took root. The Rockaways were hard hit by Superstorm Sandy but the area has been rebuilt, including the boardwalk that was most of this walk. It would be more appropriate to call it a promenade, as Sandy destroyed the old wooden boardwalk, long segments of which were so deteriorated as to be unusable.\n\nStarting at the subway station, we made the short walk to the boardwalk, past someone renting surf boards from a van. The new boardwalk is a delight for riding a bike, as I discovered after it opened in 2016, but I did this walk with a runner who said the concrete surface isn’t good for running.\n\nThe plaque on the wooden post to the left of the lamppost reads:\n\nFirefighter Richie Allen\n\nSON, BROTHER, UNCLE, FRIEND, HERO, ANGEL\n\nThe beach was Richie’s heaven on earth. He was a lifeguard and a talented surfer who loved the rush of catching a wave. In an amateur surfing film written by Richie, he states “Beach 91st Street is the best surfing spot in NYC. By some local surfers, it’s known as the arena where reputations are built and destroyed. Swells that have crashed on this beach have made this place legendary.”\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Richie heroically gave his life as a NYC firefighter.\n\nIn his memory, enjoy this beach, surf its water and live life to the fullest as that was and always will be … Richie Allen’s Way.\n\nA Hui Huo Ohana\n\nOn these walks I’ve met many people. Richie seems one of those people I wish I had met. For more about him go to https://voicescenter.org/living-memorial/victim/richard-dennis-allen-richie.\n\nFrom there we went to lunch at Happy Jack’s Burger Bar across from The Rockaway Hotel. This is a delightful place for locals. I’ll be back.\n\nUntil a couple of days ago I had no idea there were thousands of cherry trees in Newark, New Jersey, mostly in Branch Brook Park. I had biked along Bloomfield Avenue past this park but had never been in the park.\n\nWhen I lived in Washington, D.C., cherry blossom time was a very big deal. Helen Taft, wife of the 27th President, William Howard Taft, spearheaded the planting of cherry trees along the Tidal Basin. Many thousands of people go down to the Tidal Basin to see the cherry blossoms every year, These are delicate flowers and will not survive wind and rain. In the seven years I lived in Washington, only once did the blossoms last long enough for me to photograph them. Knowing full well how fragile these blossoms are, and knowing I could get to Branch Brook Park on the Newark Light Rail, I had no time to lose and had to see them for myself.\n\nNewark Light Rail used to be called the Newark City Subway. Before it was converted to a light rail line in the early 2000s it was served by streetcars that converged from various points into a tunnel underneath Raymond Boulevard in downtown Newark, terminating at Penn Station. The one remaining line, from Penn Station to Branch Brook Park, had been built in the 1930s partly in the bed of the Morris Canal, which had been abandoned. New Jersey Transit has not obliterated the 1930s signs or artwork. A nice presentation on the artwork can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/historictileinstallationsn/nj_newark--wpa-morris-canal-murals. A detailed history of the City Subway/Light Rail, with a lot of images, can be found at https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey_Light_Rail/City_Subway. Here’s one of the mosaics at Penn Station, evoking the Morris Canal and Newark’s industry, and a directional sign in Penn Station. “Cars” refers to streetcars.\n\nIn 1898 the Essex County Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers firm; John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. were Frederick Law Olmsted Sr.'s nephew/stepson and son. While their work continued that naturalistic style of landscape design championed by their father, in Branch Brook Park they were required to incorporate the elements of Bogart and Barrett's plan that had already been constructed. This led to the Olmsted firm's design concept consisting of three divisions: the Southern, from Sussex Avenue to Park Avenue, incorporating elaborate \"gardenesque\" elements; the Middle, from Park Avenue to Bloomfield Avenue, which would be a transitional zone, mixing the exotic with the indigenous; and, as the culmination, the Northern Division, the largest and most naturalistic area of the park.\n\nIn 1928 Caroline Bamberger Fuld, of the family that owned Bamberger’s department store in Newark, donated 2,000 Japanese flowering cherry trees to a display in Newark that would rival that in Washington, D.C. Eventually the collection would grow to more than 3,000 trees. Had I decided to walk to the light rail at Park Avenue, not Bloomfield Avenue, I’d have walked past many more cherry trees than I did. Oh well. I saw plenty from the train between Bloomfield Avenue and Park Avenue.\n\nBranch Brook Park is just beautiful. The footpath paralleling the park drive is paved with a bituminous material that has a bit of “give” to it and was a pleasure to walk on. Except for a few spots that need to be repaired, the footpath is in very good condition. The path up to Bloomfield Avenue does need to be rebuilt, though. The park drive was closed to cars and there was a bicycle race going on.\n\nJust north of Fulton Street, Water Street and Pearl Street merge and continue underneath the Brooklyn Bridge. From Pearl Street I turned right onto Madison Street, past the Alfred E. Smith Houses, a large public housing complex built after World War II. Madison Street was named for the fourth President of the United States, James Madison. The history of street names that follows is taken from that invaluable resource, The Street Book, by Henry Moscow (New York, Hagstrom Company, 1978). Until 1826, nine years before Madison died, Madison Street was called Bancker Street, but the area had deteriorated and the Bancker family requested their name be removed. I turned left onto Catherine Street which was named for Catherine Rutgers, part of the Dutch gentry in New York. One block on, I turned right onto Henry Street, which was named for Henry Rutgers, who donated two lots to the City for construction of a school, with the stipulation that it had to open by 1811. It opened in 1810.\n\nAt 25B Henry Street was my first dumpling stop of the day, Jin Mei Dumpling. It is truly a “hole in the wall” with all transactions handled at the front door. There is a table with two chairs outside. I had sesame pancake and fried pork buns that were excellent and inexpensive. An elderly couple in line ahead of me had come down from the northern Bronx to get a lot of dumplings and such.\n\nMarket Street was named for the Catherine Market, a wholesale food market established in 1786 between Catherine Street and Market Street, then known as George Street. Market Street is full of people and markets selling food and stuff.\n\nFrom Market Street I turned right onto Division Street and beneath the Manhattan Bridge. At the corner of Allen Street is a large, oddly shaped brick building with various businesses on the extended street level and a lot of graffiti. This was built in 1900 as an electrical substation for the Manhattan Railway Company, which operated the elevated transit lines in Manhattan. The Second Avenue Elevated ran above Division Street and turned onto Allen Street, right past the substation. Division Street’s name came from it being the boundary between the 18th century farms of James de Lancey and Henry Rutgers. According to The Street Book, “the space occupied by the street was a kind of no-man’s land used for a rope walk, i.e. a place where hemp was twisted into rope.”\n\nThis walk was inspired by historic preservationist Thomas Rinaldi and his photographs of buildings on and near the upper Grand Concourse. This was built up mostly after World War I, after the elevated subway opened on nearby Jerome Avenue (today’s 4 train). The pace of construction accelerated after the Concourse subway (today’s D train) opened in 1933. The upper Grand Concourse offers a pleasing vista of mostly mid-rise apartment buildings of more or less uniform height. The building facades differ in their details, giving the observant passerby a lot to enjoy and think about.\n\nThe walk started at the Kingsbridge Road subway station. Unusually, one has to go down from the platforms to the fare control area. Kingsbridge Road passes underneath the Grand Concourse. The subway entrance abuts what was a streetcar stop when the station opened. From the fare control area, stairs and an elevator go up to the street.\n\nAt the intersection is a park and Poe Cottage, the onetime country home of Edgar Allan Poe. For some history of the house see the post entitled “A Raven, A Ram, A Two-Headed Eagle, and Prosciutto Bread” on “The Stair Streets of New York City” page.\n\nWho was Luke Nee? Someone I wish I had met. The New York Times printed short biographies of people who died in the attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nLUKE NEE Bronx in His Blood\n\nAs a boy, Luke Nee played all the games that a Bronx sidewalk offered to kids on Minerva Place, just off the Grand Concourse: stickball, of course, and off-the-point and street hockey.\n\nRight out of Cardinal Hayes High School, he answered a help-wanted advertisement for people with math skills and landed a job at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Before long, a half-dozen guys from the block followed. It was a small world, he would say, but he would not want to paint it.\n\nAt Drexel, he met Irene Lavelle, and they were married Sept. 11, 1982. After he had shifted to Cantor Fitzgerald, he would chew through a couple of novels a week on the train ride from Stony Point, N.Y., said his brother, John Nee. His Bronx roots showed: he shared a ticket plan for Friday night Yankee games with boyhood friends from St. Philip Neri School.\n\nMr. Nee, 44, made the simple pleasures glow. ''He treasured Irene and loved bringing their son, Patrick, to ballgames,'' said his brother. On summer weekends, he, Irene and Patrick would jump in the car, pick up a few relatives and head for the beach. And on Sept. 11, he made a final call of farewell and love to his family.\n\n''Luke was just a friendly, kind, peaceful, and unaffected guy,'' said Mr. Nee. ''Meatball heroes, watch a movie with Patrick -- that was a Saturday night.''\n\nThe Williamsburg Bridge is the last of the East River bridges that I’ve walked. I’ve biked over the bridge a few times and crossed by car and by subway, but this was the first time I had crossed it on foot. It is arguably the ugly duckling of the East River bridges, but it has a fascinating history and is oddly appealing.\n\nThis walk started at the intersection of Delancey Street and Essex Street on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The subway station here is not accessible but there are escalators from the lower level platforms (F train) directly up to the street. Going down to any part of the station, it’s all stairs. Underground, just south of the upper level platforms (J and M trains), is the former streetcar terminal for the bridge, unused since 1948. In recent years there was a proposal to turn that area into an underground park, a sort of subterranean High Line, but nothing has come of that.\n\nThis area is seeing a lot of change. The City-owned, 1930s-era Essex Street Retail Market is shuttered and derelict. Across Delancey Street is the gleaming new Essex Market high-rise, to which the vendors from the old market and others have moved. The Essex Street Market and others like it were built by the City to get food vendors off the street and into modern, sanitary facilities. Six remain; read about them at https://publicmarkets.nyc/our-markets. In much the same spirit, but over a much longer time, the City’s wholesale food markets were moved to Hunts Point in the Bronx. My friends at Turnstile Tours lead occasional visits to these markets; check them out at https://turnstiletours.com/.\n\nThe block of Delancey Street east of Essex Street used to be home to Ratner’s, a kosher dairy restaurant (yes to fish, no to other meat) renowned for their blintzes. On the other side of Delancey, in a row of small shops, was a hat shop where I once bought a fedora. All gone in favor of a new mixed-use development called Essex Crossing.\n\nOnce the bridge opened, people started moving out of the slums of the Lower East Side to new housing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In Yiddish it was called the Naiye Brick, or New Bridge. It was also known as “the Jews’ Highway.” People who moved to Williamsburg walked over the bridge to work. Brooklyn elevated trains started operating over the bridge to a temporary terminal at Essex Street in 1908, and by 1918 this was upgraded to subway service.\n\nThe bridge was plagued by years of not being properly maintained and was closed in 1988 for emergency repairs after one of the suspension cables snapped. That wasn’t all: according to The New York Times on 17 April 1988,\n\nThe main cause of corrosion on the Williamsburg Bridge is salt, which is placed on the roadway to melt snow or is sprayed up from the East River. A continuing flow of salt water turns structural steel members into batteries that begin to corrode. This so-called corrosion cell activity has been particularly damaging to the steel floor beams in the roadway of the bridge. City engineers said at least 30 of the bridge's floor beams were severely corroded.\n\nThe same article noted\n\nPerhaps the most severe problem with the bridge is the corroding of the four large cables. The cables, which consist of more than 7,000 different wires, are in disrepair because they were not galvanized when the bridge was built. The problems began to appear as early as 1910, engineers said. Several early efforts to remedy the corrosion failed.\n\nThe bridge was built with two foot paths but by the first time I biked across it, around 1990, only one was open and it was in poor condition. There was some thought given to demolishing and replacing the bridge. Extensive rehabilitation began in 1992 and proceeded in stages for the next ten years. Separate bicycle and pedestrian paths were installed, except for a combined path at the Manhattan end, and the new paths comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Part of the elevated subway structure at the Brooklyn end was replaced by a precast concrete structure.\n\nThe entrance to the bike and pedestrian path at the Manhattan end has a suitably grand portal that recalls some of the bridge’s original aesthetic elements.\n\nHappy New Year! The pedestrian/bike path on the east side of Manhattan, a discontinuous mess twenty years ago, is being made continuous and accessible, slowly. New York City recently completed a segment on pilings in the East River, outboard of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, from East 54 Street to East 60 Street. I took advantage of a quiet New Year’s Day for a fully accessible walk to and along this new segment, called the East Midtown Greenway.\n\nThe walk started at the Lexington Avenue - 63 Street subway station, using the elevators at the 3 Avenue end of the station to reach the street. From there I walked east on East 63 Street to the pedestrian suspension bridge spanning the FDR Drive to the ramp down to the waterfront promenade. At the bottom of the ramp turn to the left to walk uptown (see the post on this page entitled “John Finley Walk, Carl Schurz Park, Bobby Wagner Walk”) or straight ahead toward the East Midtown Greenway.\n\nThe East Midtown Greenway is not long but it is magnificent. It has completely separate pedestrian and bike paths. Both are wide and the pedestrian path has plenty of places to sit.\n\nUntil recently I did not know about Addisleigh Park in Queens, but after a piece on the radio about the area I did some research and decided this would be worth the trip and the walk. I was not disappointed. Addisleigh Park is the African-American “Gold Coast” of New York City, perhaps more so than Sugar Hill in Manhattan. Many African-Americans who were prominent in athletics, entertainment, and letters moved here, as well as one outlier.\n\nSt. Albans is in southeast Queens. Before World War I this area was semi-rural, but since the 1910s it has been semi-suburban and easily accessible to Manhattan by the Long Island Rail Road. It is a quiet, low-traffic, low-rise neighborhood of detached houses. The main street in the area, Linden Boulevard, has a small commercial zone near the train station. Before World War II the U.S. Navy moved the Naval Hospital from the Brooklyn Navy Yard to a campus in St. Albans. That campus now houses a primary health care facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAt the Untapped Cities website there is an excellent look at Addisleigh Park. Take the time to read it at https://untappedcities.com/2020/06/23/explore-queens-addisleigh-park-the-african-american-gold-coast-of-ny/. But I shall quote the following by way of introduction.\n\nThe area was mainly developed in the 1920s and 1930s, developed by the Burfey Realty Company, and originally the area attracted famous golfers since Addisleigh Park was built close to the St. Albans Golf Course. Drawn by the golf course, Babe Ruth also had a home in the area at 114-07 175th Street, which was primarily settled by white families at the time. The area was initially created as a segregated area for white people, yet by the 1940s, this policy was reversed and many African-American families began to move into the area. Addisleigh Park contains around 650 homes in English Tudor and neo-Colonial Revival style, many built between 1910 and 1930.\n\nAccording to Laurie Gwen Shapiro, author of The Stowaway, who recently went to the neighborhood on research for her next book and offered us the pictures, “I met many residents who asked me why I was walking around and after a few words of explanation everyone I spoke to was thrilled I was interested in local history and told me other buildings that are not listed – like where Mercer Ellington and Willie Mays and Wild Bill Davis lived. Everyone I met had lived there for over 30 years and said no one ever moves. It is home.”\n\nThe walk started at the St. Albans station on the Long Island Rail Road. Underneath the railroad overpass is a mural of some of the people who graced this Gold Coast as residents or visitors.\n\nWHERE: The Flatlands and Marine Park neighborhoods of Brooklyn\n\nSTART: Flatbush Avenue and Avenue K (B41 local bus)\n\nFINISH: Nostrand Avenue and Avenue U (B3, B44, B44 SBS buses)\n\nDISTANCE: 2.79 miles (4.5 kilometers)\n\nPhotographs by Michael Cairl except as noted. Map courtesy footpathmap.com\n\nIt didn’t take long after the Dutch West India Company founded New Amsterdam, in 1624, for new arrivals from Holland to go across what is now called the East River to set up farms and villages in what is now called Brooklyn. Never mind that there were already people living there. There are plenty of reminders of Dutch settlement in Brooklyn, from street names to some old farmhouses to old church congregations. On this walk I visited two: the Flatlands Reformed Church and the Hendrick I. Lott House, and rode the bus past two others: the Lefferts Homestead in Prospect Park and the Flatbush Reformed Church.\n\nThis walk was in a part of Brooklyn south of the terminal moraine, a ridge line dating from the last Ice Age that runs the length of Long Island. I have called this Big Sky Brooklyn and, affectionately, Uncool Brooklyn. It is very flat, with only the occasional short hill. The sandy and marshy ground probably reminded early Dutch settlers of home. This part of Brooklyn is comprised of mostly attached houses and two-story commercial buildings, with higher-rise buildings here and there. Nearly all the buildings I walked past were built since World War I.\n\nA few minutes’ walk from the starting point, at Kings Highway and East 40 Street, is the Flatlands Reformed Church. It is one of three Dutch Reformed congregations founded by order of Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1654. All three congregations still exist, the others being Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church in Flatbush and Old First Reformed Church in Park Slope. The founding pastor of all three, Reverend Theodorus Polhemus, was a ninth great-grandfather of mine. The present Flatlands church is a Greek Revival structure that opened in 1848, replacing a building that opened in 1794.\n\nFlatlands was one of the townships in Kings County, later absorbed into the City of Brooklyn. From the Flatlands church’s website: “Flatlands was recognized as a town in 1788, and the minister was designated as the first Supervisor, perhaps because he was one of the few who had not given his allegiance to the King during the war. By the time the Constitution was ratified in 1789, economic and social necessity had forced amnesty and reconciliation.” This part of Brooklyn remained semi-rural and was not extensively built up until after World War I. Again from the Flatlands church’s website:\n\nIn 1838, the Reformed Church was incorporated, and the first parsonage in Flatlands was built, on near the present intersection of Avenue K and Kings Highway, for its first full time pastor. The church reported 100 adults in communion. By 1840, the population of Flatlands had grown to 800. Although slavery had been abolished in New York State in 1827, some former slaves continued to live and work as free laborers.\n\nKings Highway, which in 1920 was mostly a narrow, unpaved road, was expanded to its present width and paved later in that decade. In August 1776, a large British army landed at Gravesend Bay in southern Brooklyn. One column marched northeast along Kings Highway to Jamaica Pass (near modern Broadway Junction) then west along the Ferry Road (modern Fulton Street) to attack the Continental Army, as commemorated on the historical marker below. The other column marched north to fight in what is now called Prospect Park.\n\nA block or so past the trees is the Hendrick I. Lott House, built in 1720 and enlarged in 1800. From untappedcities.com:\n\nStill standing in its original orientation on its original site, the Hendrick I. Lott House is a rare surviving Dutch-American house in New York City. At its peak, the Lott family owned over 200 acres worth of land, according to the Historic House Trust. Much of their property would be sold off in the 1920s, with the neighborhood later becoming known as Marine Park, but the house remained in the family.\n\nOne of the extraordinary finds in this house is a closet believed to have been used to hide runaway slaves, with the house serving as an important stop in South Brooklyn on the Underground Railroad.\n\nFrom the Friends of the Lott House website:\n\nThe exterior of the Lott House represents a traditional Dutch-American vernacular farmhouse. Built c. 1800 by Hendrick I. Lott, it incorporates the 1720 house built by Hendrick’s grandfather, Colonel Johannes H. Lott.\n\nThe vernacular style of the house is limited to the exterior; the interior exhibits a much grander style. High ceilings and decorative fireplace mantles and moldings highlight Hendrick’s skill as a professional house carpenter in Manhattan during the last decade of the 18th century. Decorative and architectural features in the house date from the 18th through early 20th centuries. At present, the interior of the house remains unrestored.\n\nThe eastern wing of the Lott House is the original 1720 house. It has been theorized that this house was along Kimball’s Road (not to be confused with present-day Kimball Street). Kimball’s Road ran approximately along East 38th Street. It was the 19th-century address of the Lott House, and a driveway turned off of East 38th Street onto the Lott property. It is more likely the 1720 house originally stood where East 36th Street is now.\n\nThe Lott House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City landmark. New York City purchased the house in 2002 from the estate of Ella Suydam (1896 - 1989), a direct descendant of Hendrick I. Lott and his grandfather Colonel Johannes H. Lott.\n\nOutside and inside, Brennan and Carr looks like an old roadhouse, probably little changed since it opened in 1938. They are renowned for their roast beef sandwiches but I opted for a roast pork sandwich instead, the meat sliced very thin and the whole thing was very tasty. That and a plate of sweet potato fries made for a nice lunch indeed. The staff were very hospitable and helpful to this guy with a cane. I’ll be back.\n\nThere’s one more old Dutch farmhouse in Brooklyn to visit: the Wyckoff House in East Flatbush. And I should visit the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, built between 1793 and 1798. This walk wasn’t physically taxing and there isn’t much of note in the streetscape, but I walked through a diverse area with a lot of history. I’m glad I did it, on a very pleasant December day.\n\nWHERE: The Kingsbridge section of the Bronx\n\nSTART: Kingsbridge Road subway station (4 train)\n\nFINISH: 231 Street subway station (1 train), fully accessible\n\nDISTANCE: 1.28 miles (2.06 kilometers)\n\nPhotographic credits as noted. Map courtesy footpathmap.com.\n\nThis day’s walk was supposed to have been longer, taking in a lot of pre-World War II architecture on the upper Grand Concourse before ending up in Kingsbridge. My friend Joe was the only person who joined me, so we did a different walk. What this walk lacked in distance was offset by physical challenge. Walking downhill is harder by far than walking down stairs. This walk featured a long, steep downhill on West Kingsbridge Road.\n\nWe started at the massive Kingsbridge Armory, possibly the largest armory ever built. It was constructed between 1912 and 1917 and covers all of a 5-acre (2 hectare) site. It was designated a city landmark in 1974. At that time the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission called it \"an outstanding example of military architecture.\" The building fell into disrepair and title to it was transferred to New York City in 1996. Before that time and since, there have been several plans for re-use of the armory, none of which have come to fruition as the City and the community have been unable to develop a common vision for the armory. Meanwhile, it stands mute and unused. Outside the armory along West Kingsbridge Road were people selling all manner of stuff. Laid out on a blanket was an assortment of women’s wigs. I wish I had photographed all this. I might have to go back soon.\n\nThe rest of the walk was unremarkable, going past a large shopping center across from which is a large public housing complex. These were built on the bed of the old Spuyten Duyvil Creek. For more about this area go to my post “Over Hill and Through Riverdale” on the page “The Stair Streets of New York City.”\n\nFor me to walk down a steep hill requires care and mindfulness. Looking down the hill from Sedgwick Avenue, I said to Joe, “I’m not liking this hill.” I was concerned by the steepness of the hill and uncertain about the condition of the sidewalk. But I wasn’t going to go back to the Kingsbridge Armory, so we pressed on, carefully and successfully. I felt a lot of satisfaction after this walk.\n\nI’ve recently met an abstract artist, Scott Albrecht, whose work I like a lot. Scott is also a very kind and intelligent soul. He designed the surface of a basketball court in a city park in New Rochelle, just north of New York City. I was determined to have a look for myself and combined that with a visit to one of the few remaining vestiges of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway north of the Bronx. The route was fairly hilly, making for a decent workout on a crisp late November day.\n\nThe walk started at the New Rochelle station of Metro North and Amtrak. From the station house at the westbound (inbound) platform I walked up the ramp to North Avenue and turned left. There was a fully accessible detour around where North Avenue crosses the New England Thruway (Interstate 95) owing to the rebuilding of the North Avenue crossing. I continued a few blocks up North Avenue, through a tired-looking commercial strip, then crossed and turned left on Lincoln Avenue. A few blocks on, I crossed Malcolm X Way then crossed to the opposite (south) side of Lincoln Avenue and turned right. At this point Lincoln Avenue is on a steep-but-not-too-steep hill, and on the left was my first stop, Lincoln Park.\n\nLincoln Park is on the site of Lincoln School, a segregated public school that was closed by court order in 1961 and subsequently razed. This history is memorialized on a plaque on Lincoln Avenue near the corner of Prince Street.\n\nFor all the life and activity there is on a basketball court, it can be a pretty humdrum place, just a rectangle of asphalt. The Lincoln Park court is something special, a gift to a diverse community that might have been overlooked. Perhaps this can be viewed as a mural put not on a wall but on an athletic surface. Scott Albrecht’s horizontal mural fills its space differently than the usual vertical mural would, leading to a different interaction. The patterns on the court could be seen as mimicking how a player maneuvers in a basketball game. It is not representational art. It’s not what’s there; it is what we see. This place allows one to see and imagine many things while shooting hoops or, as I did, just looking on. I’m glad I came here, for it is a special place.\n\nLeaving the park, I continued uphill (west) on Lincoln Avenue through a tidy neighborhood. The sidewalks were in good condition and most of the curb cuts were. At the boundary between the City of New Rochelle and the Village of Pelham (pronounced pell-um) I saw this.\n\nI’ve written about the “Westchester” after several previous walks in the Bronx. This state-of-the-art (for 1912) commuter railroad was a spectacular failure, built by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and essentially competing with the New Haven. After service on the “Westchester” ended on the last day of 1937, little effort was spared to eradicate it from the landscape, especially in Westchester County. It seems strange, then, that this substantial structure was left standing. Just west of here was the railroad’s Mount Vernon Junction, from which two tracks went north to White Plains and two went east to New Rochelle (later to Port Chester). The Highbrook viaduct is on what was the Port Chester branch. Part of the right-of-way east and west of the viaduct is now preserved as a park. Just past the viaduct is this historical marker.\n\nIn 2021 I posted “The George Washington Bridge” about a walk I took over this bridge, from Manhattan to New Jersey and back. Earlier this year the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey re-opened the footpath on the north side of the bridge after years of improvements, including making it fully accessible. The Port Authority is now rebuilding the footpath on the south side, on which I did the 2021 walk. I took advantage of an unseasonably warm October Saturday to walk the new footpath and, incidentally, mark the 92nd anniversary of the opening of the bridge.\n\nThis walk started a few blocks from the bridge, at West 177 Street and Fort Washington Avenue, taking the elevator from the 175 Street subway station. One block north is the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, the terminal for many local New Jersey and New York bus routes and some longer-distance buses. This opened in 1963 and is a rare structure in the United States designed by Pier Luigi Nervi (1891 - 1979), an Italian structural engineer who was noted for the innovative use of reinforced concrete in construction. For more information about this engineering genius go to https://pierluiginervi.org/.\n\nJust past the New Jersey end of the bridge is a serpentine ramp leading to Hudson Terrace in Fort Lee, and a set of 42 stairs for those wishing a shorter trip. Before the reconstruction of the north walk there was a footbridge over the ramp to the Palisades Interstate Parkway, with stairs on either side (to the bridge and to Hudson Terrace) and a metal channel bolted to the stairs so one could roll a bicycle up and down. The new stairs do not have or need this. There is another set of 10 stairs going up into Palisades Interstate Park. I went up into the park and walked a short distance along the Long Path. I had to walk very carefully to avoid tree roots and stones and the occasional muddy area. But this walk was rewarded by some nice views of the bridge.\n\nComing back to Manhattan I took advantage of the seating area and chatted with some cyclists who had seen me walking as they rode to New Jersey and back. One of them, Marcos, ended up being the interpreter as they were all Spanish-speaking. I keep running into kind and interesting people on these walks. I am blessed.\n\nKudos to the Port Authority for doing such a great job rebuilding the north walk! It was a pleasure to walk this. Maybe add some seating in the large open areas they added by the two towers.\n\nAnd just throwing this in: a picture I took of the George Washington Bridge in 1988, from just south of Fort Tryon Park. Pure luck: right place, right time. 50 mm lens on a Canon AE-1, Kodachrome 64 film.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum has long had a renowned collection of ancient Egyptian art. My late father told me how much he enjoyed going to the Brooklyn Museum as a youngster to see its Egyptian collection. It has important holdings in other periods of art. In the mid-2000s the Brooklyn Museum added a modern front entrance. People either love it or hate it. I love it for providing a much better entryway to the museum and for its sitting stairs, oriented not straight ahead to Eastern Parkway but toward Washington Avenue just to the east, and to the rest of Brooklyn. This physical orientation coincides with the Brooklyn Museum doing a better job of embracing Brooklyn’s artists and being more a part of where it is. To me, the YO/OY sculpture out front encapsulates perfectly this sense of place, of the spirit of Brooklyn. It says something different depending on how one sees it.\n\nMany of the avenues intersecting Eastern Parkway are named for cities in New York State: New York, Brooklyn (a separate city until 1898), Kingston, Albany, Troy, Schenectady, Utica, Rochester, and Buffalo. Somehow, Syracuse was overlooked.\n\nAt the corner of New York Avenue and Park Place is an imposing structure that, despite its appearance, is not an orphanage. It is the former Brooklyn Methodist Episcopal Home for the Aged and Infirm, built in 1889 as housing for elderly members of Methodist congregations. In 1976 the Methodist Home moved to a new facility in the East New York section of Brooklyn that it still occupies. The old facility lay derelict for decades until it was acquired by the Hebron French-Speaking Seventh Day Adventist School. Much of the complex remains in disrepair, a sad outcome for this gloomy yet stunning place.\n\nMuch of Lower Manhattan is built on landfill, the shoreline having been extended over the centuries. Water Street was once at the East River shoreline. This walk took in Battery Park, some of which is on fill, and Battery Park City, all of which is, before going past the World Trade Center.\n\nThis walk began at the Bowling Green subway station, in front of the old U.S. Customs House that now is home to the Heye Foundation - Museum of the American Indian (a unit of the Smithsonian Institution), and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Cross State Street and bear slightly to the left to see the Netherlands Monument, donated by the Netherlands in 1626 on the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of New Amsterdam.\n\nJust past the Ambrose monument, turn right into the park, passing a playground on the left and a carousel on the right. Passing a restaurant on the left, turn right onto the park path. Ahead is the World War II East Coast Memorial. From the Memorial’s website:\n\nThe World War II East Coast Memorial is located in Battery Park, New York City. This memorial commemorates those soldiers, sailors, Marines, coast guardsmen, merchant mariners and airmen who met their deaths in the service of their country in the western waters of the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. Its axis is oriented on the Statue of Liberty. On each side of the axis are four gray granite pylons upon which are inscribed the name, rank, organization, and state of each of the over 4,600 missing in the waters of the Atlantic. For names where an individual’s remains have subsequently been accounted for by the U.S. Department of Defense, a rosette is placed next to the name on the memorial to indicate that the person now rests in a known gravesite.\n\nNext is the Castle Clinton National Monument. This was built on an artificial island in 1812 as part of a network of defenses of New York Harbor, others being Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island and Fort Lafayette in Brooklyn, the latter having been demolished to make way for the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Fort Clinton was was never used for warfare and its cannons never fired a shot. In 1824, the New York City government converted Fort Clinton into a 6,000-seat entertainment venue known as Castle Garden, which operated until 1855. A popular Swedish opera singer of the 1850s, Jenny Lind (“the Swedish Nightingale”), performed here. Castle Garden then served as an immigrant processing depot for 35 years. When the processing facilities were moved to Ellis Island in 1892, Castle Garden was converted into the first home of the New York Aquarium, which opened in 1896 and continued operating until 1941. The Aquarium re-opened in Coney Island, Brooklyn in 1957.\n\nBattery Park City, where we are now, is built on a large landfill where there used to be piers on an active waterfront. With the rise of containerized shipping after World War II, most of the port’s cargo traffic moved to New Jersey, leaving once-busy piers and adjoining areas derelict. The start of construction of the World Trade Center in the late 1960s provided the impetus to do something with the rotting piers. They were removed and the shoreline was expanded westward. The first apartment buildings arrived in Battery Park City in the late 1970s.\n\nContinue on the promenade to where it turns right at the marina. On your right is the New York City Police Memorial. The names of police officers who died in the line of duty are inscribed on the wall.\n\nWalk past the grand staircase and exit the building, then proceed to the crossing of West Street to the left and cross here. Once across West Street, cross Fulton Street and turn left. One World Trade Center is on the left. On the right is the North Tower Pool, part of the 9/11 Memorial. This occupies the footprint of the north tower of the World Trade Center that was destroyed in 2001. Names of people who died in the attack are inscribed on the parapet surrounding the pool. Linger around the memorial or continue along Fulton Street past Greenwich Street (restored with the reconstruction of the World Trade Center site) and Church Street. Continuing along Fulton Street, St. Paul’s Chapel (1770) and churchyard are on the left. Cross Broadway and finish the walk at the Fulton Transit Center.\n\nThere is so much history on this walk, and outstanding views of the harbor. Most of the walk is off city streets. I did this walk on a very pleasant day. Pick a nice day and do it yourself."
