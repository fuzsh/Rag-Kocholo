Here are 92 off-the-beaten-path things you may not know about, including behind-the-scenes tours, quirky museums, secret bars, little-known parks, and things hidden in plain sight.\n\nWhere admission prices are given, they are for adults unless otherwise noted. There may be reduced fees for seniors, students, military, or children. This section was written by Rick Snider, Andréa Seiger, Sherri Dalphonse, Ann Limpert, Matthew Graham, Susannah Herrada, Emily Martin, Jennifer Barger, Rin-rin Yu, Madeline Rundlett, Aly Prouty, and Grace Cutler.\n\nThe Tour Behind the Tour\n\nThree well-known attractions that offer not-so-well-known insider tours.\n\n1. Washington National Cathedral\n\nYou have to scale lots of stairs and heights on the cathedral’s “Behind-the-Scenes” tour—which goes beyond what visitors typically see, namely the main floor and crypt. But the reward is views of grotesques, flying buttresses, stained-glass windows, and other features too high to see clearly from the ground. 3101 Wisconsin Ave., NW. $27.\n\n2. Ford’s Theatre\n\nAn intimate Sunday-evening tour allows visitors to walk across the stage and exit through the back into Baptist Alley, just as John Wilkes Booth did after assassinating Abraham Lincoln. You can also see inside the President’s box from a doorway that’s normally closed. It’s a rare view from inside the theater, which still looks almost exactly as it did that fateful night. 511 Tenth St., NW. $28.\n\n3. Capitol Dome\n\nThe almost-300-step climb to the top of the US Capitol dome is not an easy feat—or an easy tick-et. A member of the House or Senate must accompany visitors. Those willing to navigate the at times narrow and uneven stairs are rewarded with a rare and breathtaking view. First St., SE. Free; contact the office of your senator or representative to arrange a tour.\n\nBack to Top\n\nChild’s Play\n\nThree hidden gems your kids will like. You might, too.\n\n1. Mom’s Pinball Club\n\nWhat’s the tie between organic groceries and pinball? Just that the owner of MOM’s Organic Market is also a pinball enthusiast—and has opened a full-on pinball parlor in a room behind the frozen section of his College Park location. Nearly 30 coin-operated machines fill the space, and tournaments are held every Friday. 9801 Rhode Island Ave., College Park; 301-220-1100. 50 cents a game.\n\n2. Loudoun Heritage Farm Museum\n\nRoots grow deep at this museum, where you get a taste of Loudoun County’s rural history. Let the kids milk a (fake) cow or play postmaster at the Waxpool General Store, a replica of the original that stood just down the road. Nibble on fresh veggies as you stroll the community garden and the barns. 21668 Heritage Farm Ln., Sterling; 571-258-3800. $5 adults; $3 ages 2 through 12.\n\n3. National Capital Trolley Museum\n\nBefore Metro and its woes, Washingtonians traversed the area in streetcars, a few of which can still be viewed at this quaint museum. Visitors can take a ten-minute ride on a historic trolley and check out streetcars from other countries. 1313 Bonifant Rd., Colesville; 301-384-6088. $10 adults; $8 kids 17 and under.\n\nBack to Top\n\nLook Down\n\nGems you won’t see unless you glance away from your phone—and down.\n\nStar Map\n\nThe bronze statue of Albert Einstein in front of the National Academy of Sciences is well known. But if you visit, check out the part below Einstein: The granite base contains more than 2,700 metal studs marking the positions of the planets, stars, sun, and moon on the day the memorial was dedicated in 1979. 2101 Constitution Ave., NW.\n\n56 Signers Park\n\nThis small island within Constitution Gardens contains 56 stones bearing signatures of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence. Naturally, John Hancock’s is the biggest. George Washington didn’t sign, opting to be with the troops. 19th St. and Constitution Ave., NW.\n\n“Named Stones”\n\nStroll along Four Mile Run in Arlington’s Bluemont Park and try to spot a series of boulders, in and by the stream, engraved with phrases such as sleeping moon, artemis, and psyche. (Hint: They’re near the playground and baseball fields.) The “Named Stones” are by Arlington artist J.W. Mahoney. 601 N. Manchester St., Arlington.\n\nBloodstains at the Capitol\n\nIn 1887, reporter Charles Kincaid exposed Kentucky congressman William Taulbee’s extramarital affair. Three years after that, the two got into an altercation at the Capitol and Kincaid was warned by the then-lobbyist to arm himself. He did: Later that day, Kincaid shot Taulbee to death on the House’s east staircase. Bloodstains still remain on the marble. Kincaid was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. First St., SE.\n\nMLK Jr. Time Capsule\n\nIn 1988, a time capsule containing a Bible and robe that belonged to Martin Luther King Jr., among other items, was placed beneath Freedom Plaza—which previously had been Western Plaza but was renamed in his honor. Engraving in the plaza floor marks the site. 1455 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSecret Shops\n\nThree out-of-the-way stores.\n\n1. Amalgamated Costume and Design Studio\n\nWhen she worked at the Defense Department from 1986 to 2012, Shelley White wore 1940s suits to meet top brass. Now she sells vintage clothing in a tucked-away Arlington warehouse and provides costumes for retro movies and TV shows such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Thousands of men’s and women’s garments, circa 1900 to the ’70s, include a 1930s silk kimono ($250) and Eisenhower-era cashmere cardigans ($75 and up). 5179-B Lee Hwy., lower level, Arlington. Open mainly by appointment (call 703-517-7373); check Instagram @amalgamatedshop for some Saturday hours.\n\n2. The Indian Craft Shop\n\nYou’ll have to go through security and clip on a red cardboard pass to visit the Interior Department’s Indian Craft Shop, which has been selling works by Native American artisans since 1938. Wooden beamed ceilings and murals of a family on horseback set the scene for goods created by more than 50 US tribal groups, including Kiowa appliqué denim jackets ($250), beaded Navajo bracelets ($35 to $65), and lots of Acoma pottery. Department of the Interior, 1849 C St., NW. Open Tuesday through Friday 10 to 4:30, third Saturday of the month 10 to 4.\n\n3. Timothy Paul Carpets & Textiles\n\nFor years, bohemian-home wizards Timothy and Mia Worrell ran rug, textile, and furniture shops in Logan Circle and Virginia’s Mosaic district. Now the couple splits time between DC and Charleston, selling vintage Moroccan shag carpets, Turkish kilims, and upholstery out of a Merrifield warehouse by appointment and via occasional open houses. They’re popular with interior designers, and their workroom can turn your fabric—that silk snagged in Vietnam, a fragment of your grandmother’s quilt—into a pillow or mounted wall piece. 2808-D Merrilee Dr., Fairfax; 202-468-1404.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOn This Spot\n\nEight historic sites—most marked with signs or plaques—that you may have walked by and never noticed.\n\n1. Bladensburg Dueling Grounds\n\nImagine a stream running red with the blood of men dueling after an argument about, oh, the speed of a steamship. A sign describes what 1800’s “gentlemen” did here—in what’s now a park—to settle a score. 38th Ave. at Bladensburg Rd., Colmar Manor.\n\n2. Bernard Baruch Bench\n\nImagine a Wall Street fat cat sitting on a park bench alongside congressmen, away from probing microphones. That’s what Bernard Baruch did on this bench in Lafayette Square. He also waited there for a signal to come to the White House, to meet with Franklin Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.\n\n3. Williams Slave Pen\n\nBefore 1850, slaves were bought and sold in DC, hustled through the streets right in front of the US Capitol. The sign at this spot marks the place where the Yellow House, a notorious slave pen, once held auctions of human cargo. Independence Ave. at Seventh St., SW.\n\n4. Letelier-Moffitt Monument\n\nAn act of terrorism on DC’s Embassy Row is remembered by a fireplug-size monument where, in 1976, a car bomb killed outspoken Chilean exile Orlando Letelier and coworker Ronni Moffitt. Sheridan Cir., between Massachusetts Ave. and 23rd St., NW.\n\n5. First Airmail Flight\n\nThose ball fields in West Potomac Park once served as the runway for the first airmail flights from Washington to New York. A rock marker on Ohio Drive, along the river and roughly across from the entrance to the FDR Memorial, shows where President Woodrow Wilson—along with hundreds of children allowed out of school for the day—watched the initial flights. Ohio Dr., SW.\n\n6. Singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner”\n\nIn 1814, Indian Queen Hotel—notable in its day for hosting grand events—is where “The Star-Spangled Banner” was apparently sung for the first time, by an unknown singer at an event lost to time. A plaque on what today is an office building commemorates the occasion. 601 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.\n\n7. Braddock’s Rock\n\nNear the ramp leading from Constitution Avenue to Roosevelt Bridge, a circular stone well protects a rock 16 feet below. (Before the terrain changed, the rock was at the edge of the Potomac.) This is where General George Braddock supposedly arrived with troops to fight the French and Indian War in 1755. Braddock soon died, leaving aide George Washington in charge. Constitution Ave., NW.\n\n8. Lincoln at Fort Stevens\n\nA stone marker notes where President Abraham Lincoln stood on a parapet and just missed being shot while overlooking the Battle of Fort Stevens in 1864—the only Civil War battle waged in the District. This national park, with cannons and other remains of the fort, hosts an annual day to commemorate the battle in July. 6001 13th St., NW.\n\nBack to Top\n\nTen Under-the-Radar Attractions\n\nThey’re not exactly hidden, but many longtime residents never get to these terrific museums and historic sites.\n\n1. Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument\n\nIn a building burned by the British during the War of 1812, the headquarters of the National Woman’s Party chronicles the struggle for the 19th Amendment, which gave voting rights to women. Check out the desk of Susan B. Anthony. 144 Constitution Ave., NE. Free.\n\n2. National Law Enforcement Museum\n\nTest your skills as a 911 operator or a police officer in a hands-on decision-making simulation. Examine forensic evidence, compare your sense of smell against a canine’s, and check out deadly prison contraband such as a gun made of paper that actually fired a metal bullet. 444 E St., NW. $21.95.\n\n3. Art Museum of the Americas\n\nThis museum showcases the work of Latin American artists, much of which deals with contemporary socio­political issues. Look up as you walk through the solarium: It’s tiled with a mosaic of images from Mesoamerica. Before you go, make a reservation to see the stunning underground mural, “Roots of Peace.” 201 18th St., NW. Free.\n\n4. College Park Aviation Museum\n\nThe world’s oldest continually operating airport opened in 1909, when Wilbur Wright taught military aviators in the federal government’s first airplane. Public flights followed in 1912. The museum includes historic aircraft and hands-on activities for kids. 1985 Corporal Frank Scott Dr., College Park. $5.\n\n5. Fort Washington\n\nTrue, it failed at its initial job of protecting Washington—it was captured by British forces in the War of 1812 after the city’s burning. But nowadays, the old fort in Prince George’s County, abandoned by the US military in 1946, is a national park where kids can climb on cannons and you can picnic. 13551 Fort Washington Rd., Fort Washington. Free.\n\n6. Daughters of the American Revolution\n\nSnap a photo on the south portico, where The West Wing filmed some scenes. Inside the headquarters of one of the nation’s oldest women’s societies, 31 state rooms are furnished in period decor, a US history lesson in itself. Don’t miss the New Hampshire children’s playroom. 1776 D St., NW. Free.\n\n7. President Woodrow Wilson House\n\nPOTUS 28 retired to this Kalorama mansion. He lived there three years, and wife Edith resided in the house until her 1961 death—the day the Wilson Bridge opened. Among the artifacts is a baseball signed by Britain’s King George V. 2340 S St., NW. $15.\n\n8. Tudor Place\n\nThis neoclassical home built in 1816 by Thomas and Martha Custis Peter—a son of Georgetown’s first mayor and a granddaughter of Martha Washington—remained in the Peter family for 178 years, making it a fascinating timeline of American antiques and history. The gardens even feature some original plantings. 1644 31st St., NW. $10.\n\n9. Surratt House Museum and Dr. Samuel A. Mudd House Museum\n\nLincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth’s escape route included the Surratt house to obtain guns and Dr. Mudd’s to be treated for a broken ankle. Surratt House, 9118 Brandywine Rd., Clinton; $5. Mudd House, 3725 Dr. Samuel Mudd Rd., Waldorf; $7.\n\n10. Pope-Leighey House\n\nA Frank Lloyd Wright home designed for a middle-class family, it cost so much—$7,000 in 1941—that Wright declined his final payment. The furniture was designed by the architect, too. 9000 Richmond Hwy., Alexandria. $15.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHidden Treasures\n\nThree not-so-congressional artifacts in the Library of Congress, rarely on view—but online.\n\n1. Spider-Man\n\nThe library archives comic books, too, including pages that illustrate the origin of Spider-Man.\n\n2. The Great Train Robbery\n\nThe 1903 film, the first of at least four to use that title, is less than 15 minutes long—but it innovated techniques such as shooting on location.\n\n3. The Whole Booke of Psalmes\n\nThis book of hymns from 1640 was the first book printed in British North America—specifically, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBe an Embassy Insider\n\nSix ways to appreciate foreign exchange.\n\n1. Admire a Mural in Mexico\n\nAt the Mexican Cultural Institute, the dramatic, recently restored Roberto Cuevas del Rio mural lining the three-story stair-case tells the story of Mexico’s history and its long friendship with the US. 2829 16th St., NW.\n\n2. Learn to Tango in Argentina\n\nArgentina’s embassy has been teaching tango’s cruce dance step for 20 years. Three sessions of four classes each are planned for 2020. Classes fill fast. Check dates on Twitter: @arginusa. 1600 New Hampshire Ave., NW.\n\n3. Watch a Film in Latvia\n\nThe National Film Centre of Latvia partners with the Latvian Embassy to showcase the country’s film industry. A yearlong festival running through May screens movies usually on the third or fourth Thursday of the month at 6 pm. To reserve free tickets, search for Latvian Film Club at eventbrite.com. 2306 Massachusetts Ave., NW.\n\n4. Lunch in France\n\nMark Courseille, who worked with legendary chef Michel Richard at Citronelle, is executive chef at Le Café Descartes in the French Embassy. Weekday options include a three-course, $38 menu du jour. For reservations and mandatory preregistration, e-mail reservations@lecafedescartes.com. 4101 Reservoir Rd., NW.\n\n5. Bond Over Soccer in Europe\n\nExpats often gather at their respective embassies to cheer on their teams when it’s international-soccer-tourney time. This year’s big event: the UEFA European Championship, mid-June through July. You don’t have to be a foreign expat to go, but try to root for the home team on embassy property. Check dc-embassy-events.org or embassy websites for details on watch parties.\n\n6. Attend an Art Opening in Korea\n\nA new exhibit showcasing South Korean art opens on the first Friday of every month at the embassy’s Korean Cultural Center. The jury-selected artist is often present at the opening, with a reception following the artist’s remarks. Reserve free tickets at washingtondc.korean-culture.org. 2370 Massachusetts Ave., NW.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFour More Things Hidden in Plain Sight\n\n1. Original Patentees of District of Columbia Memorial\n\nA small granite marker, often hemmed between food trucks and the Ellipse, names the 18 patentees prior to 1700 whose land formed the capital. Tobacco, wild-turkey, corn, and fish symbols recall their agricultural pursuits on the land. 15th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., NW.\n\n2. Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II\n\nA granite wall honors the 120,000 Japanese Americans interned during World War II. Bronze cranes in barbed wire symbolize the struggle for freedom. Louisiana Ave. and D St., NW.\n\n3. Zero Milestone\n\nThe Good Roads Movement conceived this stone marker with a bronze compass, dedicated in 1923, with the idea that every US and Western Hemisphere highway should have a beginning point, à la Rome’s Golden Milestone. It never caught on, but all distances in and around DC are measured from here. E St. between 15th and 17th sts., NW.\n\n4. Godey Lime Kilns\n\nLime production was big business in Georgetown until 1907—used as mortar in the construction of the city and supplied by vessels transporting limestone down the C&O Canal. These two remaining kilns in Foggy Bottom were saved in the name of historic preservation. Rock Creek Parkway at Whitehurst Freeway.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDid You Know?\n\nFour secret ways to enjoy some of Washington’s most popular attractions\n\n1. Reservations to Glenstone Museum can involve months of waiting. If you’re driving, that is. Visitors who take Ride On Bus 301 from the Rockville Metro can walk right in—no reservation needed. 12100 Glen Rd., Potomac.\n\n2. There are ways to skip the lines at two popular eateries. At Le Diplomate (1601 14th St., NW), two barstools hidden at the back of the glassed-in L’Orangerie room are for walk-ins. And if Shaw’s All-Purpose (1250 Ninth St., NW) is mobbed, get a pizza to go, then bring it to the bar Lost & Found (1240 Ninth St., NW), which allows carryout.\n\n3. The Kennedy Center rooftop has one of the best views in town. Thanks to 20 new weather-resistant tables, you can take it in while picnicking on the roof. Grab some food from the center’s KC Café or bring your own. (No outside booze, though.) The lawn at the new Reach offers another picnic-worthy vantage. 2700 F St., NW.\n\n4. There’s a Smithsonian museum few are aware of: Smithsonian Gardens, which manages more than 180 acres in DC, is an accredited museum with exhibits and programs. It’s not just pretty plants and flowers: You can learn about monarch butterflies, for example, at “Monarchs on the Move” outside the Hirshhorn or about the vital role of lifeless trees in “Dead Wood Is Life,” outside American History.\n\nAn earlier version of this write-up has been corrected."
