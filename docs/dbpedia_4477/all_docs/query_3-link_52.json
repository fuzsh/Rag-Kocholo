You can find a spot anywhere along Constitution Ave NW but here are a few places you may want to arrive early because they offer the best view:\n\nSteps of the National Archives\n\nConstitution Ave Side of American History Museum or Natural History Museum - there is more shade in this area and low laying walls that you can sit on!\n\nHow to get to the Memorial Day Parade?\n\nThe closest Metro stations to the Parade Route are Federal Triangle and Smithsonian but those are likely to be very crowded! As as well as the Archives station!\n\nIf you're planning on being near the end of the route (15th or 17th and Constitution Ave NW), then we suggest going via the McPherson Metro Station.\n\nIf you're going to the start of the parade route, Chinatown stop on the Red Line is a straight walk down 7th Street!\n\nHow Long is the Memorial Day Parade\n\nThe parade is usually about 3 hours.\n\nOpening ceremonies start at 1pm and the parade itself begins at 2pm.\n\nThe parade begins at 2 pm, but come early to catch a good spot!
