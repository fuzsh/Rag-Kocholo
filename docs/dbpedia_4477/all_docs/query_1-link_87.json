Most ferry boats were scow-type, flat-bottomed boats that operators poled, rowed, or sailed across the water. Unlike the building of a bridge, where the cost of construction and repair was a drain on the town treasury, a ferry was a low-cost alternative. In return for the right to collect a toll, a willing ferryman promised to provide a boat and operate the service for a given period of years, usually seven. The General Court set the fare for each ferry, with toll rates depending on the nature of the crossing. Tolls were highest at the colonys two widest crossings, the Thames and the Connecticut Rivers, where a further surcharge was allowed for a winter crossing.

Most were scow-type, flat-bottomed boats that operators poled, rowed, or sailed across the water or, in the case of the Niantic ferry, pulled across using a rope line that spanned the river. A most ingenious crossing was at Windsor. Here a cable-pulley system stretched across the river and was firmly anchored to each shore. The cable passed through a pulley on the side of the ferry scow. After shoving off, the ferryman turned the boat at an angle to the rivers current, whose force moved the boat along the cable line in much the way a sailboat tacked into the wind. On the return crossing, the ferryman simply reversed the angle of the boat to the flow of the water.

One house immediately attracts my attention-- a house with a sign that reads Jeremiah Lee House, 1740-1750. Westbrook was part of Saybrook until 1840. Both Hamilton and Birket bypassed the center of Saybrook and stopped at a place run by a widow named Lay, which was seven miles from Saybrook Ferry according to Birkett and six miles from Seabrook according to Hamilton. A tavern run by a Leigh is listed as five miles from Saybrook Center and seven miles from Saybrook Ferry in Lows 1775 Almanac. As this house is in what was once part of Saybrook, is five miles from Old Saybrook, and dates to the 1740s, lacking any further evidence to the contrary, I suggest that this may be the place mentioned as Leighs (or Lays).

However, Theophilus Nichols who lived on the Old Mill Green around 1700, was influential in preserving what remains of the green today.\n\nIt is named after Mill Brook upon which a mill was constructed in 1654. By the time there were enough people settled along the road to form a community, the first mill had become old; hence the name, Old Mill Hill and Old Mill Green. By the late 1790s, a bark mill and tannery had joined the grist mill. The last one situated along the brook was a wool carding mill in 1818.\n\nThe Old Mill Green was a flourishing and aristocratic part of the Town of Stratford from about 1700 into the 19th century. Most of the townspeople resided at the green including the three person committee in charge of oversight of the New Pasture, a point of land south of the green reaching to the Sound. The green was formally deeded to the town in 1740 by nine townspeople for use as a perpetual common.\n\nThe green is the site of a Benjamin Franklin milestone (\"17 miles to N.H\") which is associated with the oldest mail route in the United States established along the King's Highway.

The destruction from the 1779 burning was so widespread that it was still evident ten years later when Washington wrote: The destructive evidences of British cruelty are yet visible both in Norwalk and Fairfield, as there are chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet. At the time, it took two days to travel from New York to Fairfield by carriage on the Boston Post Road, so travelers needed a place to stay overnight and refresh their horses.\n\nIndex Connecticut Index\n\n1732 - Burr House, Rebuilt in 1790\n\nThe Burr House is located at 739 Old Post Road, in Fairfield's Old Post Road Historic District. The house is owned by the Town of Fairfield. Originally built in 1732, Thaddeus Burr (uncle of Aaron Burr) and Eunice Burr resided in the home during the American Revolution. John Hancock married Dorothy Quincy here in 1775, as Boston's patriotic activists fled the British. The home also hosted George Washington, John Adams, and Samuel Adams during this time. In 1779, it was destroyed during the Burning of Fairfield, but Hancock insisted that the Burrs rebuild their home, and it was completed in 1790. The Burr family held the property from the 1600s until the mid-1800s. The home was renovated in the 1800s. In 1962, the Burr House became a Town of Fairfield property.

The oldest section consists of the original center-chimney block, which probably began as one-room and was then expanded. A lean-to added several decades after the house was built. The traditional date of construction is 1673, but the later date of 1734 is more likely. The house is traditionally associated with John Osborne, who married in 1673. His father Richard fought in the Pequot War and received a grant of land for his services. The last battle of the war was fought in 1637 in Pequot Swamp, which is located adjacent to the house. The colonial-era section of the house is flanked at both ends by two twentieth-century wings.

It was laid out in 1672 at the behest of the governors of the New York and Connecticut colonies to facilitate communication between New York and Boston. The section of the highway now in the district diverged to the north to ford the Saugatuck River upstream. The river then was the border between Fairfield and Norwalk; people who settled in the district on the west side were Norwalk proprietors and their descendants. King Street remained the major through route until the construction of the Post Road, which bypassed this section of King Street in the early nineteenth century to accommodate commercial wharves and storage facilities located nearer the mouth of the Saugatuck. The eighteenth-century village encompassed by the district was first known as Taylortown for the many members of that family who settled there. One early site remains that is identified with this family: the 1730 house built by Lt. John Taylor in the center of the district at Old Hill Road.\n\nSome of the older houses are:\n\n1769 Captain Nathan Burwell House, 104 Kings Highway North, in the north end of the district.\n\n1730 Lt.

The Nashes bought the Marvin grist mill and moved it from another site in Taylortown, perhaps as early as 1784.\n\n1727 Daniel Freelove Nash House, 41 Kings Highway North, Westport.\n\nMany owners of colonial period houses are buried in the King Street Cemetery at 119 Kings Highway North, which was laid out in 1740.

An estimated 20,000 Puritans emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1630 to 1640. Some went down the Connecticut River to Wethersfield, Connecticut, around 1635. Some of those went on to Stamford in 1641 and 1642. Included among those going to Stamford were two whose descendants lived in houses on the Kings Highway in Darien that are still standing: Jonas Weed and Robert Bates.\n\nHistorical Name of the Kings Highway in Darien\n\nThe name Kings Highway apparently went out of use as the colonies got closer to the Revolutionary War. But the name came back in use in some areas as time went on. In a 1908 Atlas, the old road east of St. Luke's Church in Darien is named Kings Highway, except for a short portion west of the railroad tracks that is named Maple Avenue. In the 1910 census, it was called the Old Post Road. In the 1920 census, it was called the Old Kings Highway. Following is a history of the portion of the old road north of the railroad.\n\nThe Country Road on 1820 Map of Middlesex Parish (Darien)\n\nOld Road on rough sketch before 1848 by Anna Elizabeth Carpenter in Darien Historical Society, 1994\n\nRed Mill Road in 1900 census\n\nFarm Road to Rowayton in 1900 census\n\nKings Highway on 1908 Atlas of rural country district north of New York City\n\nOld Post Road in 1910 census\n\nOld Kings Highway on 1913 Map of Darien by Henry Miner in Darien Historical Society, 1999\n\nOld Kings Highway in 1920 census\n\nKing's Highway North on 1926 aerial photograph map on the wall of the Darien Public Works office\n\nOld Kings Highway North in 1930 census\n\nOld Kings Highway on 1935 Map of Darien\n\nOld Kings Highway North in 1940 census\n\nOld Kings Highway North in 1950 census\n\nOld Kings Highway in Darien now is crisscrossed by three newer and straighter routes in Darien: the new Post Road built in 1808, the New York and New Haven Railroad built in 1849, and I-95 built in 1953. The Railroad did not build a viaduct when it was enlarged in 1894; thus, today's Old Kings Highway is divided betwen North and South.\n\nIndex Connecticut Index\n\n1684 - John Reed and the Red Mill in Darien\n\nJohn Reed (1633-1730), a Puritan, fled England in 1660 when the monarchy was restored under Charles II. He had served as a Captain in the army of the Commonwealth after the fall of Charles I. He lived in Rhode Island and New York, then settled in the Connecticut Colony in 1684 and built the The Red Mill on the Five Mile River at what is today my house at 230 Old Kings Highway North.\n\nThe photo above was enhanced by the Norwalk Historical Society and displayed at Brookside Cemetery on Rowayton Avenue. Shot southwesterly from the Norwalk side of the Five Mile River bridge. In the foreground, the non-macadamized road (called the Farm Road in the 1900 census) crosses an A-frame bridge over the river. The road winds past the grist mill up the hill toward Raymond Street.\n\nThe mill building center right. The mill run and wheel are under the roof on the right side of the building. The mill is three stories high. At the top is a hoist that would lift grain to the top floor.\n\nTwo utility poles can be seen at the far left. They would surely have included telegraph and telephone wires. And, the first municipal electric plant in Connecticut began operating in South Norwalk in 1892. Between the utility pole and the bridge is the mill run flowing back into the Five Mile River. To the left of the mill is a house built in 1880 that today is 222 Old Kings Highway North. A long white fence parallels the road toward Raymond Street, probably starting in front of the house. See Unenhanced photo.\n\nIndex Connecticut Index\n\n1705 - Jonathan Bates House in Darien\n\nOne of the oldest houses on the Kings Highway in Darien, Connecticut, is the Jonathan Bates House.

The house is shown between mile markers 47 and 48 on the 1789 Colles map 4c (Middlessex, which became Darien in 1820) shown later on this page.\n\nPerhaps this is the Jonathan Bates, whose grandfather Robert Bates migrated to New England during the Puritan migration of 1630-1640 and moved from Wethersfield, Connecticut, to Stamford in May 1641. This Jonathan Bates had a son John Bates Jr., who died in 1800 and is the first person buried in the Bates Cemetery, which is 300 yards northwest of the 1705 house.

The house is shown at mile marker 47 on the 1789 Colles map 4c (Middlessex, which became Darien in 1820) that appears later on this page.\n\nThe Bates-Scofield house is a colonial saltbox-style house, built around 1736 by John Bates Jr. Before Dariens first meetinghouse was built in 1744, services were held in the Bates House. After the Bates family, the house was owned by the Scofield family for almost a century, starting with Ezra Scofield in 1822. By 1964 the house faced demolition, until it was given to the Darien Historical Society and moved a hundred yards north to 45 Old Kings Highway North to become a museum.\n\nJohn Bates Jr. died in 1800 and is the first person buried in the Bates Cemetery, which is 300 yards northwest of the 1705 Jonathan Bates house at 150 Old Kings Highway North. See: Bates Cemeteries 1 & 2.\n\nIndex Connecticut Index\n\n1744 - Darien Congregational Church\n\nThe first meetinghouse of the Congregtional Church on Old Kings Highway North (Country Road) was built in 1744. The first pastor was Dr. Moses Mather. He was a graduate of Yale Divinity School. He served as pastor for 62 years until his death in 1806.\n\nMoses was the great great grandson of Rev. Richard Mather, who had immigrated with his family to Massachusetts on the ship James in 1635. Included was his son Rev. Increase Mather, President of Harvard College from 1692 to 1701. Increase Mather was the father of Rev. Cotton Mather.\n\nA great great grandson of Moses Mather was Stephen Mather, first director of the National Park Service. He lived in The Mather Homestead built in 1778 by Joseph Mather, son of Moses Mather, 2.3 miles north of the Congregational Church.\n\nIndex Connecticut Index\n\n1781 - Tory Raid in Darien\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Middlesex Parish was frequently raided by local Tories who had fled to Lloyd's Neck on Long Island. The Tories disrupted services at the meetinghouse on Old Kings Highway North (Country Road) in 1781. They captured Dr. Moses Mather, the minister, and forty-seven other men, and transported them across Long Island Sound. Dr. Mather, with twenty-six of his parishioners, suffered five months in British prisons in New York City before those who survived their confinement were exchanged and returned to their homes.

Steam power was replaced by electric power. the grade level was raised. In the process, The grade level crossing of the new Post Road was replaced by an underpass. No underpass was created for the old Post Road.\n\nIt appears on the 1867 Map of Darien that there was a grade crossing for the old Post Road to begin with. And it is clear on the 1908 map that there is no crossing.\n\nAlso in 1894, a new railroad station was built just east of the new Post Road, replacing the original station between the new Postroad and the old Post Road.\n\nSource: New York and New Haven Railroad, Darien station, and Darien station.\n\nIndex Connecticut Index\n\n1895 - Tramway in Darien\n\nFrom 1895 to 1933, a tram from Rowayton extended into Darien past the Five Mile River at White Bridge and the old Post Road to the new Post Road, where people could connect with the Stamford tram that went down the new Post Road from Stamford an ended at the New Haven Railroad.

It is located at the point where Goodwives River Road branches off from the Country Road. The 17 miles agrees with the 1789 Colles atlas. Map 4, page 7, of the Colles atlas says that the point where the Goodwives Road branches off from the Country Road (to Long Neck) is 46 miles from Federal Hall. Map 6, page 9, says that the Fairfield is 63 miles from Federal Hall. The difference is 17 miles, same as the distance shown on the mile marker at Goodwives River Road. Perhaps they used the Colles atlas to make the marker. Perhaps the marker goes back to 1789.\n\nDarien is in Fairfield County.

It opened in 1849, and in 1872 it merged with the Hartford & New Haven Railroad to form the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. The line is now the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line and part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The railroad eventually changed Darien into a residential suburb of metropolitan New York.

The first notice of Church of England services in Stamford was in 1705, when George Muirson, the rector of Rye, New York, made excursions eastward into the towns within the Connecticut colony. The wardens wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in London, asking it to help them in their efforts to get a clergyman of the Church of England to minister to them; the wardens hoped that the Society would look favorably on their desire that Ebenezer Dibblee, a Congregational minister from Danbury who had become an Anglican convert, should receive Holy Orders in England and be sent by the Society back to St. Johns Church. The Society agreed, and Mr. Dibblee traveled to London for ordination. He returned to Stamford in 1748 and became rector of the church, holding that position for 51 years until his death in 1799. Until the American Revolution, Mr. Dibblee remained a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, ministering to a parish that included all of Stamford, Greenwich, Darien, and New Canaan. During the revolution, many Anglicans remained loyal to the Crown, and many Stamford Anglicans emigrated to Canada. Mr. Dibblee stayed in Stamford and held services in parishioners homes during the war. In 1742, an appeal was made to the town of Stamford for a grant of land on which to build a church. As the result of this appeal, the town agreed to give the professors of the Church of England a piece of land to set a church upon, at the southwest corner of the present lot held by St. Johns parish. It was at that time a rude ledge of loose rock, bounded on the north and east by an almost impassable swamp, from which it it would appear that the Puritan town fathers did not much favor the Church of England. The Anglicans, however, thanked the town for the omen, that they were founded upon a rock. The cornerstone was laid in 1743, and the church was so far finished in 1747 that it could be used.

It did not become Greenwich until 1848, when the New Haven Railroad came through town. Putnam Hill in Horse Neck was once the center of Greenwich. The hill is named for General Israel Putnam, a Revolutionary War hero who in 1779 evaded pursuing British soldiers by riding from Knapps Tavern down the steep hill to Stamford where he alerted the militia. General Putnams military feats are honored with the naming of Putnam Avenue (original Kings Highway) and Putnam Cottage (Knapps Tavern). Other significant buildings on Putnam Avenue are the Second Congregational Church and Christ Church Greenwich. They appear below on the 1789 Colles map, along with Knapps Tavern.

Logs were cut in holes in the ground for wood to be used for homesteading. The name Saw Pit was used for the first time in 1732. The Saw Pit area remained largely untouched except for a few farms in the hills above the Byram River and a few taverns along the trail that became the Boston Post Road. Although Rye and Saw Pit were created within Fairfield County, Connecticut, the King of England gave the Duke of York large territories west of present-day Connecticut, forming the New York Colony in 1683. The controversy of divided loyalties to the King and the Duke continued for 105 years. In 1788, the Legislature of New York ruled that Saw Pit was a part of the town of Rye, New York. In 1868, Saw Pit separated from Rye and was renamed Port Chester. The harbor area had become a shipbuilding site and Port Chester was considered a major seaport. Source: Port Chester.\n\n1673 - Rye History\n\nColonial Rye was a small farming community, but its position along the Westchester Path (later, the Boston Post Road) made it an important post and stagecoach stop. The post from New York to Boston started in 1673 and took 14 days. By 1722, stagecoaches were traveling over the road (known as the Kings Highway) and stopping in Rye. The center of Rye moved from the Long Island Sound area to the Kings Highway, aided by Strangs Tavern at what is now the corner of the Post Road and Rectory Street and the Square House. Both taverns were the center of colonial life, providing local residents and travelers with food, drink, shelter, entertainment, news and politics.\n\nRye had an unusually large number of mills in the late 1600s and 1700s. The brooks in Rye had a much greater flow of water before the New York City reservoir system was built in the mid-1800s. The first mill in Rye was built in 1656 on the Blind Brook near Oakland Beach Avenue. At the time of the Revolutionary War, 15 or 20 mills were operating in Rye and Port Chester, including one behind the Square House. See: Rye History and Boston Post Road Historic District (Rye)..\n\n1671 - Mamaroneck\n\nIn 1671, John Richbell of Mamaroneck and John Pell were appointed by the Governor of New York to lay out a new road from New York City to New England in place of the old Indian trail. It was called the Westchester Path. In 1732, the first regular stage coach route was established along the (Old) Boston Post Road. In 1733 (or before), there was a (private) school house on the north side of what is now the Old Boston Post Road and Orienta Avenue. It was also used for town meetings. In 1843, the wooden Post Road Bridge over the Mamaroneck River collapsed and was replaced by an iron pipe bridge. In 1889, a new school building opened at the Boston Post Road and Rockland Avenue, later referred to as the Central School. In 1895, the Post Road Bridge was replaced with the present stone bridge. See: Mamaroneck History.\n\nIndex New York Index\n\n1762 - Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church in New Rochelle\n\nTinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church in New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York, is located at the northwest corner of Huguenot Street (also known as the Boston Post Road) and Division Street. This church represents the body of the majority group of New Rochelle's founding Huguenot French Calvinistic congregation that conformed to the liturgy of the established Church of England in June 1709. King George III gave Trinity its first charter in 1762. After the American Revolutionary War, Trinity became a parish of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America. See: Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church.\n\n1695 - St. Paul's Church in Mount Vernon\n\nSt. Paul's Church is at 897 South Columbus Avenue in Mount Vernon. The parish that founded Saint Paul's Church was established in 1665. The first church at the site was a small, square, wooden structure built in 1695 and was known as the Church of Eastchester. The present day church was built in 1764, but its name was not changed to Saint Paul's Church until 1795. On October 18, 1776, the Revolutionary War Battle of Pell's Point was fought less than a mile from the church, and the church served as a hospital for the British Army following the battle. The church's tower contains a bell that was cast in 1758 at the same London foundry as the Liberty Bell. As the fighting began to move closer to the church, George Washington ordered the parishioners to bury the bell to prevent the British from melting it down and using it for ammunition. The bell still hangs in the tower today. Source: Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site.\n\nSt. Paul's Church is at 897 South Columbus Avenue in Mount Vernon.

The bridge was built by John Williams, a farmer and landowner who owned a large tract of land in the region. The bridge played a vital role in connecting Westchester County with Manhattan, serving as a crucial transportation link during that time. Over the years, the area around the bridge became known as Williamsbridge, and the name stuck as the neighborhood developed and grew. Today, while the original bridge no longer exists, the name Williamsbridge continues to honor the rich history and legacy of John Williams and his contribution to the area's development. Source: Williamsbridge.\n\nGun Hill Road Was Kingsbridge Road\n\nThe thoroughfare we know today as Gun Hill Road was once named Kingsbridge Road. It was an important artery over which the British and the colonists fought. Kingsbridge Road was part of the Boston Post Road, a system of mail-delivery routes between New York City and Boston, and became one of the first highways in the country. In January of 1777, colonists dragged a cannon to the top of a hill (in todays Woodlawn Cemetery) and fired down at the British. The hill became known as Gun Hill and in 1875 Kingsbridge Road was renamed Gun Hill Road in honor of the colonists. Source: Williamsbridge.\n\n1758 - ValentineVarian House\n\nWhen Isaac Valentine bought this parcel of land from the Dutch Reformed Church, carriages traveled the nearby Boston Post Road through a Bronx consisting mostly of farmland. Valentine, a blacksmith and farmer, built this two-story fieldstone house and it stands today as the boroughs second oldest house.\n\nThe homes symmetrical style, sometimes referred to as Georgian vernacular, features evenly placed windows and identical chimneys at either end. Inside, rooms mirror each other across a central hallway. The design of the deep-set, splayed windows throughout the house let in light and keep out the cold.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War (1776-1783), Valentine and his family had to abandon their home, which was occupied by British, Hessian, and American troops. The house, close in proximity to cannons clustered on a nearby hill, miraculously survived several fierce battles. The Valentines returned after the war, but financial ruin forced them to sell their home and the 260-acre property to Isaac Varian, a successful butcher and farmer, in 1792. The Varians kept the house for three generations; one of Isaacs grandsons (also named Isaac) served as New York Citys 63rd Mayor, from 1839-1841.\n\nWilliam F. Beller acquired this house in a 1905 auction. His son, William C. Beller, donated it to The Bronx County Historical Society in 1965, but sold the land to developers. The house was then moved diagonally from its original location, across Bainbridge, one block south to its present location in Williamsbridge Oval Park. See: ValentineVarian House.\n\nIndex New York Index\n\nKingsbridge Neighborhood\n\nThe Kingsbridge neighborhood is named for the King's Bridge. Until the later part of the 19th century Riverdale, Kingsbridge, and other areas now in the northwest Bronx were part of the Town of Yonkers. The areas that are inside the modern-day New York city line broke off to form the Town of Kingsbridge. In 1874, the City of New York annexed three towns that later became the western half of The Bronx, including the Town of Kingsbridge. As the trains to Manhattan were built in the 20th century, a stop in the northwest Bronx along the Hudson River called Riverdale-on-Hudson, now Riverdale, was created. This gave rise to the Riverdale neighborhood. The remainder of the old Town of Kingsbridge developed into the modern-day Kingsbridge neighborhood.

It connected the Bronx to upper Manhattan. It was originally constructed in 1693 under a grant from the Crown and maintained by the Philipse family as a toll bridge until the revolution.\n\nIn 1895, the old Harlem River (Spuyten Duyvil Creek) at what is now 230th Street was replaced by the Harlem Ship Canal at what was then 222nd Street. The Canal severed Marble Hill from Manhattan island, eliminating the old Kings Bridge. The creek's water flow was redirected to the new and deeper shipping canal, south of Marble Hill. Marble Hill, though separated by the river, is still part of Manhattan.

It connected the Bronx to upper Manhattan. It was originally constructed in 1693 under a grant from the Crown and maintained by the Philipse family as a toll bridge until the revolution.\n\nIn 1895, the old Harlem River (Spuyten Duyvil Creek) at what is now 230th Street was replaced by the Harlem Ship Canal at what was then 222nd Street. The Canal severed Marble Hill from Manhattan island, eliminating the old Kings Bridge. The creek's water flow was redirected to the new and deeper shipping canal, south of Marble Hill. Marble Hill, though separated by the river, is still part of Manhattan. Spuyten Duyvil and the Canal are now considered part of the Harlem River.\n\nSource: Spuyten Duyvil Creek and Kings Bridge.\n\nIndex New York Index\n\n1759 - Hyatt's Tavern\n\nHyatts Tavern was built around 1759 near the current intersection of 226th Street and Broadway.

The site of Fort Washington is now Bennett Park on Fort Washington Avenue between West 183rd and 185th Streets in Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York City. The locations of the fort's walls are marked in the park by stones, along with an inscription. Nearby is a tablet indicating that the schist outcropping is the highest natural point on Manhattan Island, one of the reasons for the fort's location. Bennett Park is located a few blocks north of the George Washington Bridge.

It is the oldest house in Manhattan, having been built in 1765 by British military officer Roger Morris, and was also home to the family of socialite Eliza Jumel in the 19th century. The New York City government has owned the house since 1903. General George Washington used the mansion as his temporary headquarters for one month in late 1776, after which British and Hessian officers occupied the house until 1783.

It departs 5th Avenue and 92nd Street.\n\nMcGowan's Pass. The Kingsbridge Road crossed the Harlem Creek, which flowed east into the Harlem River. The road passed through this rocky landscape and descended through McGowans Pass, named after the McGowan family, who owned a house and tavern near the present-day site of the Parks operational area known as the Mount, around 107th Street. While restoring this landscape in 2013, the Central Park Conservancy hired archaeologists to determine the impact of the project on any physical remnants of this history. The archaeologists discovered the foundation of the gatehouse as well as the surface of the Kingsbridge Road, still preserved underground.

In the 19th century the farmland and market garden district of what was to be the Upper East Side was still traversed by the Old Post Road. By the mid-19th century the farmland had largely been subdivided, with the exception of the 150 acres of Jones's Wood. The farm of 132 acres, known by its 19th-century owners as the \"Louvre Farm\", extended from the Old Boston Post Road (approximating the course of Third Avenue) to the river and from present-day 66th Street to 75th Street.

It was probably named after the turtles found in the area. Historical records from the 17th century described an abundance of turtles nearby, with local residents partaking in a \"turtle feast\". The Turtle Bay neighborhood was originally a 40-acre land grant given to two Englishmen by the Dutch colonial governor of New Amsterdam in 1639 and named Turtle Bay Farm. The farm extended roughly from what is now 40th to 49th Streets and from Third Avenue to the river. On a knoll overlooking the cove, near 41st Street, the farmhouse was purchased as a summer retreat by Francis Bayard, and in the early 19th century remained the summer villa of Francis Bayard Winthrop. Turtle Creek, or DeVoor's Mill Creek as it was known, emptied into the cove at what is now 47th Street. To the south lay Kip's Bay farm; to the north, on a bluff, stood James Beekman's \"Mount Pleasant\", the first of a series of houses and villas with water views stretching away up the shoreline. \"Beekman\" can be seen at mile 4.5 on Colles map 1b. After the street grid system was initiated in Manhattan, the hilly landscape of the Turtle Bay Farm was graded to create cross-streets and the land was subdivided for residential development.

Robert Murray (17211786) arrived in New York City in 1754. About 1762, he rented land from the city for a great house and farm, which he called Inclenberg, Dutch for beautiful hill. The total area was just over 29 acres. In today's terms, the farm began a few feet south of 33rd Street and extended north to the middle of the block between 38th and 39th Street. At the southern end, the plot was rather narrow but at the northern end it went from approximately Lexington Avenue to a spot between Madison and Fifth Avenues. \"Murray\" can be seen at mile 3.6 on Colles map 1a.

The park and the square are at the northern (uptown) end of the Flatiron District neighborhood of Manhattan. The neighborhood to the north and west of the park is NoMad (\"NOrth of MADison Square Park\") and to the north and east is Rose Hill. On May 10, 1847, the 6.2-acre Madison Square Park, named after President James Madison, opened to the public. Within a few years, the tide of residential development, which was relentlessly moving uptown, had reached the Madison Square area.

It was completed in 1902 and originally included 20 floors. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Broadway (the Kings Highway), Fifth Avenue, and East 22nd Street. The name \"Flatiron\" derives from its triangular shape, which recalls that of a cast-iron clothes iron. Source: Flatiron Building.\n\n1868-1910 - \"Ladies Mile\"\n\nThe Ladies' Mile was a prime shopping district on Broadway from Madison Square to Union Square (part of the Kings Highway). It served the well-to-do \"carriage trade\" of the city. Before becoming a shopping district, this area was residential and included rows of identical brownstone townhouses. These townhouses were replaced in the 1860s by department stores.\n\nThe architectural style of this district shifted to Beaux-Arts, Neo-Renaissance, Romanesque Revival, and Queen Anne. Many of the new buildings used cast iron because it was cheap and could be made into any shape for extravagant decorations.\n\nThe first to make this move was Arnold Constable in 1868, though other were quick to follow. Between the Civil War and World War I, the Ladies Mile was the location of some of New York's most famous department stores and upscale retailers, including:\n\nLord & Taylor at 901 Broadway at 20th Street\n\nGorham Silver at 889 Broadway\n\nArnold Constable at 881-887 Broadway\n\nW. & J. Sloane on Broadway at 19th Street\n\nEthel Barrymore, Isabella Stewart Gardner, Lilly Langtry and Lillian Russell were among those who might be found in the opulent shopping district at its zenith. The Ladies Mile was termed so because women were the target consumers and its popularity made it a safe space for women to wander about without men. The construction of the elevated train known as the El on Sixth Avenue in 1878 made the Ladies Mile more accessible to lower class consumers. Extravagant shoppers would continue to arrive in carriages.\n\nSource: Ladies' Mile Historic District.\n\nIndex New York Index\n\n1884 - Gorham Manufacturing Company Building\n\n889 Broadway, also known as the Gorham Manufacturing Company Building, is a Queen Anne style building located at Broadway and East 19th Street in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, within the Ladies' Mile Historic District. Built in 18831884, it was designed by Edward Hale Kendall. The building served as a retail store for the Gorham Manufacturing Company, a major manufacturer of sterling and silverplate, until 1905. The stories above the second floor were originally rented as bachelor apartments until Gorham expanded into the rest of the building. The building was converted into lofts and offices in 1913.

At one point it was the oldest department store in America, operating for over 150 years from its founding in 1825 to its closing in 1975. At the company's peak, its flagship \"Palace of Trade\" in Manhattan  located at 881-887 Broadway at East 19th Street  was acknowledged to be the store which took the largest portion of the \"carriage trade\" in New York, serving the rich and elite of the city, such as the wives of Grover Cleveland, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, J.P.

Its name denotes that \"here was the union of the two principal thoroughfares of the island\". The current Union Square Park is bounded by 14th Street on the south, 17th Street on the north, and Union Square West and Union Square East to the west and east respectively. Adjacent neighborhoods are the Flatiron District to the north, Chelsea to the west, Greenwich Village to the southwest, East Village to the southeast, and Gramercy Park to the east. Many buildings of The New School are near the square, as are several dormitories of New York University. The eastern side of the square is dominated by the four Zeckendorf Towers, and the south side by the full-square-block mixed-use One Union Square South, which contains a wall sculpture and digital clock titled Metronome.
