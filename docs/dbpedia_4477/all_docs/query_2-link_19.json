        "text": "Mineral Wells military history dates back to 1916 with the organization of Company 1, 4th Texas Infantry. By January 1925, the War Department approved the site that would become Camp Wolters, the training ground for the 56th Cavalry Brigade of the Texas National Guard.\n\nIn 1956, the base began operations as the Primary Helicopter Center of the United States Army that would provide basic training and primary flight training for all rotary-wing aviators. The Vietnam War created an increased need for pilots. To meet the demand, Fort Wolters increased operations to become the training site for helicopter pilots for the Marine Corp in 1968 and the Air Force in 1970. Nearly every helicopter pilot that flew in Vietnam was trained at Fort Wolters.\n\nFort Wolters was deactivated in 1973. The 8,500 acres was then parsed out to the city of Mineral Wells, private businessmen, Weatherford College, and Lake Mineral Wells State Park.\n\nMilitary History Timeline\n\n*Military History Timeline compiled in partnership with Mary Creighton- Fort Wolters Historical Committee\n\n1877-Mineral Wells is established as a city\n\n1918– The area is guarded by civilian soldiers\n\n1921– 56th Cavalry Brigade of Texas National Guard is established in Mineral Wells\n\n1927– Old Camp Wolters becomes the Headquarters for all mounted cavalry in Texas\n\n1941– Camp Wolters is activated from State Guard Status to Active Status to become the largest American infantry center of WWII\n\n1943– Mineral Wells Airport is established to support Camp Wolters\n\n1946– Camp Wolters is inactivated\n\n1951-1954– Camp Wolters is reactivated and designated SCARWAF (Special Category Army Reassigned with the Air Force) is located at Wolters Air Force Base\n\n1956– Wolters returns the Army as the Primary Helicopter Training Center\n\n1957– Fort Wolters is the largest primary helicopter training center in the world\n\n1963– Camp Wolters is redesignated as Fort Wolters, a permanent military installation\n\n1973– Fort Wolters is declared closed but remains open until 1975\n\n1998– National Vietnam War Museum is established\n\n2010– Fort Wolters Gate Committee (later renamed, Fort Wolters Historical Committee) is established to preserve local military history\n\n2011– Fort Wolters Gate is completely restored\n\n2013– Medal of Honor Memorial is established (2 locations)\n\n1st location- Mineral Wells High School near the Camp Wolters Historical Marker\n\nThe Fort Wolters Historical Committee partnered with the high school to create a low-cost memorial honoring those who either trained or served at Fort Wolters or were from the Mineral Wels area.\n\n2nd location- Fort Wolters\n\nDue to a lack of visibility and an increased local interest, a second location was designed for on Fort Wolters.
