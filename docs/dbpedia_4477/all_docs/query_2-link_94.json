        "text": "The club was hard at work on Wednesday morning at both Triangle Park and the Soldiers and Sailors monument near City Hall.\n\nJoAnn Bowes, treasurer, said the club was able to purchase $400 worth of petunias, begonias, zinnias, coleus and marigolds to add to the perennial flowers that are already planted.\n\n“I want to thank the Clinton County Community Foundation for providing the funding necessary for the costs of maintaining the flower gardens at the Triangle Park and Soldiers and Sailors Monument locations, as well as the city for supplying water for us,” Bowes said.\n\nThe Dogwood Circle Lock Haven Garden Club has been in existence since 1960 and currently has 12 active members.\n\nBowes stressed that they rely on the club members, as well as volunteers and missionaries, to take turns checking on the flowers and keeping the areas clean throughout the summer.\n\nElder Fox and Sister Fox, who traveled here from California to do missionary work, said they help the Garden Club and local food pantries.\n\nIf you are interested in joining or volunteering with the Dogwood Circle Lock Haven Garden Club, go to http://www.lhgardenclub.com or the Dogwood Circle Garden Club Facebook page. According to Bowes, the best way to get in contact with them is through Facebook Messenger."
