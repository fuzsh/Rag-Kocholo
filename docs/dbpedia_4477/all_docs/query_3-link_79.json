        "text": "Part showplace, part workplace, probably one of the world’s most-recognized buildings, it’s hard to imagine now that until the 20th century, the public could walk in freely, and the grounds remained open until World War II. Today, visitors simply get to peek at a scant eight rooms out of the house’s 132, and with little time to linger (the tour can take as little as 20 minutes). The public tour is self-guided (though highly regimented) and there’s not much in the way of interpretation, but the nation proudly clings to keeping its leader’s residence open to the public.\n\nFDR promoted this 1943 shrine to the founder of his Democratic Party, balancing that to the Republicans’ icon, Lincoln. Roosevelt liked it so much he had trees cleared so he could see it from the Oval Office. John Russell Pope designed an adaptation (sneered at by some as \"Jefferson’s muffin\") of the Roman Pantheon that the architect Jefferson so admired. It echoes the president’s designs for his home, Monticello, and for his rotunda at the University of Virginia. The Georgia marble walls surrounding Jefferson’s 19-foot likeness are inscribed with his enduring words. Alas, the 92-word quote from the Declaration of Independence contains 11 spelling mistakes and other inaccuracies.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is the city's cultural life pulse. With over 2000 shows and events every year, it's the go-to spot for Broadway hits on tour, iconic performances like \"The Lion King\" and the incredible talents of the National Symphony Orchestra. At the center, you'll find one of the coolest perks in D.C.—an open-air rooftop terrace. It's open to everyone from 10am until midnight, free of charge. Plus, there's a rooftop restaurant where you can grab some drinks or enjoy a nightcap while soaking in the city's skyline.\n\nIt is the right of anyone killed in action in any branch of military service, or who served for 20 years, to be buried at Arlington, along with their spouse. It’s ironic, then, that the cemetery started almost as an act of Civil War vengeance: in 1861 Union forces seized the estate of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and in 1864 they began burying soldiers close enough to Arlington House to make sure that Mr. and Mrs. Lee could never take up residence again. However, time has worked its healing magic and transformed Arlington into a place of honor and memory.\n\nIt’s been a long time coming, but African Americans have finally found their place on the National Mall. On the southwest of the Mall, with an official address—1964 Independence Avenue—that references the year of the passing of the Civil Rights Act, the location was chosen to create a symbolic, visual \"line of leadership\" with the Lincoln Memorial. It was here that King made his legendary \"I have a dream\" speech in 1963 at the culmination of the March on Washington.\n\nThe District Wharf, affectionately known as The Wharf, is a mile-long stretch along the Potomac River, where you'll find a vibrant mix of restaurants and shops offering breathtaking waterfront views. Amidst all the modern hustle and bustle, you'll spot some historical gems like the Lunch Room and the Oyster Shucking and Fish Cleaning Shed, remnants of the glory days of the Municipal Fish Market. Be sure to keep an eye on the neighborhood's calendar because there are always cool live music events open to the public.\n\nDedicated in 2004, the monument that honors America’s \"Greatest Generation\" is a grandiose affair on a 7.4-acre plot. Designed by Friedrich St Florian, it is a granite-heavy space dominated by the central Rainbow Pool, which is set between two 43ft triumphal arches, representing the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of war. Fifty-six wreath-crowned pillars represent the US states and territories (including the Philippines), while a bronze Freedom Wall displays 4,000 gold stars, each signifying 100 war dead. The ceremonial entrance, descending from 17th Street, passes bas-reliefs depicting events of the global conflict. A Circle of Remembrance garden off to the side fosters quiet reflection.\n\nThe Washington Monument was completed in 1884, 101 years after Congress authorized it. It rises in a straight line between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial but is off-center between the White House and the Jefferson Memorial because the original site was too marshy for its bulk. Private funding ran out in the 1850s, when only the stump of the obelisk had been erected. Building resumed in 1876, producing a slight change in the color of the marble about a third of the way up. The 555ft monument—the tallest free-standing masonry structure in the world—was capped with solid aluminum, then a rare material.\n\nThis monument, which honors the 12 million Americans who fought in the Cold War conflict in Korea, features 19 battle-clad, seven-foot soldiers slogging across a V-shaped field towards a distant US flag. Their finely detailed faces reflect the fatigue and pain of battle, while bulky packs show beneath their ponchos. Reflected in the polished granite wall, these 19 become 38—in reference to the 38th parallel separating North and South Korea. Unlike the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, this shows a subtle mural sandblasted into rock, a photo montage of the support troops—drivers and medics, nurses and chaplains.\n\nThe national library of the U.S., the Library of Congress is the world’s largest. Its three buildings hold some 100 million items—including the papers of 23 U.S. presidents—along 535 miles of bookshelves. Contrary to popular notion, the library does not have a copy of every book ever printed, but its heaving shelves are still spectacular. To get to grips with the place, it’s best to start with the 20-minute film in the ground-floor visitors’ center, excerpted from a TV documentary, which provides a clear picture of the place’s scope and size."
