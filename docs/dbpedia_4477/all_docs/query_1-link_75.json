He was wounded in the head crossing the “Burnside Bridge” at Antietam, Maryland, on September 17, 1862. Governor Morgan, in a written recommendation to promote Walton to second lieutenant said, “…His untiring devotion to his duties won the esteem and respect of his officers. He has always been found at his post ready and willing for all work required of him…” After his promotion to second lieutenant of his company on September 29, 1862, he commanded his company at Fredericksburg, Virginia, in December of that year, whereupon he narrowly escaped injury with five bullet holes in his clothing and one bullet grazing his arm.\n\nEffective upon his transfer to Company E on March 14, 1863, Walton was promoted to first lieutenant. New York’s Governor Morgan praised him upon his promotion citing, “His untiring devotion to his duty won him the respect of all the officers and men of the 51st Regiment New York Volunteers.” In a letter dated January 3, 1864, to support Walton’s request for transfer, the commanding colonel “acknowledged with gratification the valuable services rendered by Lieut. Walton while serving as Aide, and takes particular pleasure in mentioning his handsome behavior at the battle of Campbell’s Station, and during the siege of Knoxville.” On April 20, 1864, he was promoted to captain (the youngest in the 9th Corps) and transferred to Company D, transferring back to Company E two days later. Walton commanded the 51st Infantry at the Battle of Poplar Springs Church, Virginia, from September 29-October 2, 1864, in which 344 men from the regiment were killed, wounded, or missing. He was discharged four days later at Poplar Grove Church.\n\nWalton was a member of the G.A.R.’s Ulysses S. Grant Post #327. In 1883, his application for an invalid pension was granted for disability resulting from a “gunshot wound of the scalp” at Antietam, certificate 258,140. He was in command of the honor guard for President Ulysses S. Grant’s funeral ceremonies when he lay in state at the New York State Capitol Building in Albany on August 7, 1884. While his last residence was at 132 Fort Greene Place, Brooklyn, Walton died at the Middletown State Hospital in Middletown, New York. Section 171, lot 12752, grave 10.\n\nWALTON, JOHN (1838-1896).

Rank unknown, 71st Regiment, New York State National Guard. According to a descendant, Wambach immigrated to the United States from Germany when his parents fled the Franco-Prussian Wars. At about the age of 12, he was orphaned and raised by an older sister. According to records from his Masonic Lodge, he served in the 71st National Guard during the Civil War, was wounded at Appomattox, Virginia, and remained with the 71st until 1878, when he was discharged with the rank of first sergeant. No other details of his wartime service are known; however, there may be some confusion because the 71st was not in service in 1865 when the fighting at Appomattox occurred. His service cannot be confirmed by pension records, although there is a blank paper with his name and address written on it in government pension files.\n\nOn October 18, 1865, Wambach became a naturalized citizen. In 1866, he became a postmaster on Governor’s Island. An article in the New York Evening Telegram on July 12, 1920, “Octogenarian New York Employees Prove Uncle Sam Poor Judge of Ousting Workers at 70,” celebrated nine civil servants who had served the same employer for half a century. That piece included Wambach and confirmed that he was a letter carrier in the Wall Street-Battery Park area for almost 54 years and stated that he exemplified “regular habits and careful living” and enjoyed excellent health. His family notes that he met President Grant at an event at the Union League Club of New York where he worked as a steward as a youth. It was there that Wambach was presented with a 13-star flag of the United States that was displayed in the room and that remains a cherished family heirloom today. He was active in the Joppa Lodge, a Masonic organization in Brooklyn where he organized a drill team in 1906 after bringing twenty-one non-commissioned officers into the organization. He was also the chaplain of that lodge for 25 years beginning in 1903.\n\nAs per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Wambach was most likely the oldest retired postman. He had been the treasurer of the National Association of Civil Service Employees, and a member of the National Association of Letter Carriers. Prior to his wife’s death in 1921, they had been married for 54 years. Wambach’s death was noted in the records of the Joppa Lodge. That citation reiterated his injury during the Civil War and the anecdote about the American flag. He last lived at 52 86th Street in Brooklyn. Section 204, lot 29672.\n\nWANGNER, THEOPHILE (1839-1867). Captain, 41st New York Infantry, Companies K and G. Of German origin, Wangner enlisted at New York City as a private on June 6, 1861, the same day that he mustered into Company K of the 41st New York.

He re-enlisted in the 81st as major on May 22, 1863, and was commissioned that day. After he was wounded in battle at an unspecified place and time (it may have been the first general assault on Vicksburg, Mississippi), Ward died of wounds on June 17, 1863, and was interred at Green-Wood seven days later. Section 83, lot 1134.\n\nWARD, GEORGE BLANCHARD (1847-1921). Rank unknown, 23rd Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company B. Ward was born in New York. As per his obituary in the Seventh Regiment Gazette, he enlisted on March 1, 1865, and mustered into Company B of the 23rd Regiment.

He mustered out on June 13, 1865, at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. His last residence was on 9th Avenue in Manhattan; his death was caused by pneumonia. In 1901, Caroline Ward’s application for a widow’s pension was granted, certificate 514,589. Section 181, lot10969, grave 3.\n\nWARD, JOHN (1839-1899). Landsman, United States Navy.

On July 16, 1861, while on the Seminole, he contracted pneumonia and was transferred to the Princeton, a receiving ship, on July 25. After he was examined by the medical staff on July 27, records indicate that he had rheumatism and liniments were applied to his limbs.

After enlisting as a private at New York City, his birthplace, on August 21, 1862, Ward mustered into the 6th New York Cavalry. He mustered out on June 5, 1865, at Cloud’s Mills, Virginia. In 1866, his application for an invalid pension was approved, certificate 78,186. He last lived at 953 DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn. Section 58, lot 1986.\n\nWARD, WILLIAM GREENE (1832-1901). Colonel, 12th Regiment, New York State National Guard. Grandson of Revolutionary War Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Ward, William Greene Ward, who was born in New York City, was a banker and graduate of Columbia College, class of 1851, and New York University Law School.

He later served with Dana’s Division and Couch’s Corps in Pennsylvania in 1863.\n\nWard was one of the inventors of the Ward-Burton breech-loading rifle, which was more efficient than muzzle-loaders.

A brigadier general of the New York National Guard from 1866 to 1886, he was also president of the New York State Society of the Cincinnati.

That same article noted that Ward served under Grant in the Civil War and was subsequently his banking partner. He last resided at 351 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.

In May 1863, the battery was part of Poague’s Artillery, the Army of Northern Virginia, and engaged at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, then in Virginia at Cold Harbor and Petersburg. Ware’s company fought at the Wilderness in 1864, and was exposed to heavy fire at Cold Harbor on June 3, 1864, where many lives were lost. “Richard’s pieces were with much difficulty gotten back to the works occupied by the infantry. They were there, however, used with some effect, as the enemy attempted to advance, the cannoneers being to some extent protected.” Ware’s paperwork indicates that he was detailed and not present at the Battle of Gettysburg and at the Battles of Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, Virginia, when he was detailed as an ordnance sergeant. After taking an oath of allegiance, he was paroled at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. He died at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan.

His uncle, Nathaniel Waring, testified in the United States District Court that his nephew was underage at the time of his enlistment, did not have the permission of his parents to serve, and was entitled to be discharged. However, because President Lincoln had suspended the right of habeas corpus during wartime, the court ruled against Waring and he was kept in service.

The obituary noted that except for his service in the Union Army, he was a prominent city contractor. He laid the first Belgian block pavement in New York City, opened and graded First Avenue and graded Eighth Avenue.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Waterbury raised a company for the 8th Regiment and was made its captain. He enlisted at New York City on April 23, 1861, and was commissioned into the 8th Regiment’s Field and Staff as its lieutenant colonel two days later. He mustered out on August 2, 1861, at New York City. According to the aforementioned obituary, he was at the Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, and served in the Army of the Potomac.\n\nReturning to civilian life, he was the president of the Nicolson Pavement Company whose principal achievement was moving the Central Presbyterian Church from 19th Street and Fifth Avenue to 57th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue in the late 1870s.

Born in Lake George, New York, Watson obtained his medical degree in 1861 from the University of New York. During the Civil War, he was a contract surgeon in 1862. Subsequently, he enlisted as an assistant surgeon on March 26, 1863, and was immediately commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 4th New Jersey. He was promoted to surgeon on November 25, 1864, and mustered out on July 9, 1865, at Hall’s Hill, Virginia, at which time he was surgeon in charge of the 1st Division, 6th Army Corps Hospital and medical purveyor.\n\nWatson then settled in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he was appointed attending surgeon to the Jersey City Charity Hospital at the time of its organization in 1869. In addition, he was an attending surgeon to St. Francis Hospital beginning in 1873, and at Christ’s Hospital beginning in 1885. His efforts were instrumental in the passage of the act that legalized dissection of human cadavers in New Jersey.\n\nDr. Watson was a founder and president of the New Jersey Academy of Medicine and was awarded a Master’s degree from Rutgers in 1882. Among his many professional publications are: “A Case of Neuralgia treated by Extirpation of the Superior Maxillary Nerve” (1871); “Pathology and Treatment of Chronic Ulcers” (1875) ; “Cases of Rabies Canina treated with Stryehina and Woorara” (1876) ; “Disease Germs: their Origin, Nature, and Relation to Wounds” (1878): “Woorara: its Medical Properties and Availability for the Treatment of Diseases” (1882); and an “Experimental Study of Anaesthetics,” (1884). He translated medical essays from the French and German, and wrote two books, Amputations and their Complications (Philadelphia, 1885) and The Sportsman’s Paradise, on the Lake Lands of Canada (1888), and contributed the chapter on “Pyaemia and Septicaemia” to Practical Medicine, edited by Dr. William Pepper (Philadelphia, 1885).\n\nHowever, Watson’s career and reputation were marred by controversy. According to articles in the Buffalo Courier and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on June 5, 1886, he was arraigned and charged with cruelty to animals. When the second floor of his Jersey City carriage house was searched, there was a pen holding six dogs. Carcasses of dogs and dissected dog spines were also on display. He apparently experimented on the animals from February 9 through May 31, 1886, using cruel methods that subjected the dogs to spinal contusions by dropping them 30 feet from a harness while under anesthesia; dogs that did not recover were not fed. The story in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle stated that 41 dogs, all numbered, were subjects of the experiments and that the paperwork was obtained by the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Watson was charged with 31 civil suits each carrying a $100 fine. His coachman was also placed under arrest as a witness. Watson, an expert surgeon in the employ of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, claimed that the experiments were necessary to parallel the effects of spine injuries on humans who sued the railroad claiming that they lost vitality months after their injuries. Some of the animals suffered broken legs, torn arteries, and ruptured organs; criminal charges were being considered. His last residence was in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was survived by his wife and a daughter; his son died at age eight in 1890. In 1910, Phebe Ann Traphagen Watson, who is interred with him and whom he married in 1868, applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 737,806. He died of diabetes.

As per an inscription on his gravestone, “at the first call of his country he enlisted in the 71st Regt. and was in the battle of Bull Run.” Apparently, after that service, Watson re-enlisted as a private at New York City on September 2, 1861, mustered directly into the 9th New York, was promoted to corporal on October 14, 1861, and rose to sergeant on January 19, 1862. He was killed in action on September 17, 1862, at the Battle of Antietam, Maryland, and originally buried at its National Cemetery, gravesite 747.\n\nA handwritten “Final Statement” written by his captain, Andrew Graham, notes that Watson, who was a clerk in civilian life, was 5′ 9″ tall with blue eyes, brown hair and a fair complexion. The note went on to say that he was owed $54 by the government for his service. Watson’s family subsequently claimed his remains from Antietam and he was re-interred at Green-Wood on December 7, 1862. His gravestone confirms that he was “killed on the field of Antietam.” Section 33, lot 4194.\n\nHis cenotaph at Green-Wood is inscribed in part as follows:\n\nJAMES HOLMES WATSON\n\nSGT. OF CO.

He served in the Navy during the Civil War, attaining the rank of captain. His brother, Eugene Winslow Watson, also joined the Navy during the Civil War and attained the post of rear admiral. He may have been the John S. Watson who entered the Navy as an acting master on September 9, 1861, became an acting volunteer lieutenant on August 7, 1865, and was honorably discharged on October 21, 1866. This man served on the USS Shenandoah as part of the Northeast Squadron. Or, he might have been the John S. Watson who became an acting master on November 17, 1863, an acting volunteer lieutenant on June 3, 1864, and was honorably discharged on October 30, 1865. If that man, he served on the USS Hastings with the Mississippi Squadron.\n\nFollowing the War, Watson entered the shipping business, and, beginning in 1882, he served for twenty-six years as the superintendent of the Cunard Line’s piers in New York City. The New York Herald noted his retirement at age 83 on December 31, 1908, and, like his obituary in that newspaper, stated that he was well-known to travelers and was almost always present when a ship docked or departed.

Private, 36th New York Infantry, Company C. Watson was born in New York. After enlisting as a private at New York City on May 15, 1861, he mustered into the 36th New York on June 17. According to his muster roll, he was present with his company in April 1863 after returning from desertion on March 21 of that year; his muster roll indicates that he was paid through February 28, 1863, and that he served in the 10th Regiment after he returned from desertion. Watson mustered out with his company on July 15, 1863, at New York City. As per his obituary in the New York Herald on August 5, 1863, he died suddenly; friends and relatives and members of the 36th Regiment were invited to attend his funeral at the home of his brother-in-law at 143 East 20th Street in New York City.

Captain, 21st Wisconsin Infantry, Company G; private, 7th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company E. Watson was born in Albany, New York, and served as a Congressional page as a youth. His ancestry dates back to the Plymouth colony and one relative, John Watson, was a land surveyor in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1644. He served in New York’s 7th Regiment during 1861. Later, as a resident of St. Lawrence, Wisconsin, he enlisted as a sergeant on August 20, 1862, and mustered that day into the 21st Wisconsin. He was taken as a prisoner of war at Perryville, Kentucky, on October 8, 1862, and subsequently was promoted to first sergeant.\n\nAfter being promoted to lieutenant on March 29, 1863, Watson was again taken prisoner at the Battle of Chickamauga, Georgia, on September 9, 1863, and was confined at Macon, Georgia, and then at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia. He and several other prisoners dug a tunnel that they used in a daring escape on the night of February 9, 1864, but were later recaptured. In that mission, of the 109 Union officers who attempted to flee, 48 were recaptured, Watson being in sight of Union pickets when he was retaken.\n\nCaptain Frank Moran, a fellow prisoner who was with Watson in that ill-fated escape, wrote an article in The Century Illustrated Month Magazine in March 1888, recounting the difficult and arduous task that the leaders of the plot endured in planning the escape. Libby Prison was isolated, under constant guard, and all belongings kept from prisoners. Yet, with determination, a rope, and a few tools, an escape route from the kitchen and through a tunnel was carefully dug out at night with the knowledge of a few prisoners who were intent on gaining their freedom. As the time of escape came closer, the inmates had to devise plans to cover for the two men who were digging the tunnel during the day when roll-call occurred. After leaving the rat-infested sewer with scant clothing on February 9, Watson and Moran escaped but according to Moran, “…We were run down and captured in a swamp several miles north of Charlottesville, and when we were taken our captors pointed out to us the smoke over a Federal outpost. We were brought back to Libby and put in one of the dark, narrow dungeons.” Colonel Thomas Rose of the 77th Pennsylvania, who led the escape was eventually recaptured and also returned to Libby Prison.\n\nThe account of the escape was also recounted by Mortimer Thomson, his boyhood friend, who wrote a Letter to the Editor that was published in The New York Times on April 13, 1902, after Watson’s death. Thomson wrote in part of Watson, “…After several months of incarceration, during which he had been first reduced to a skeleton by privation and then swollen out of all proportion by the disorder consequent on prolonged malnutrition, he concluded that death would be preferable to life held any longer on such terms and decided to escape if he could…” Thomson went on to say that Watson “was particular to emphasize that the negroes were his only friends, and that if it had not been for the occasional aid with food and shelter he would have collapsed from starvation and exposure….” Thomson concluded by saying that Watson’s future success was founded upon the virtues developed in military life. On January 14, 1865, he was promoted to captain, serving until he mustered out on June 8 of that year at Washington, D.C.\n\nWatson commanded Company G, the Beecher Company, of the 13th New York after the Civil War as of August 16, 1878, rose to colonel in 1895, and served in that position when the regiment was disbanded by Governor Black during the Spanish-American War. According to his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Watson’s “unimpeachable military record” was clouded during the Spanish-American War when there was controversy about the enlistment of New York regiments in the call for volunteers. Apparently there was dissension when officers and men were separated and in the end, Watson was sent home.\n\nA one-time member of the New York Produce Exchange, he was the Second Deputy Collector of Taxes for Queens at the time of his death. His obituary in The New York Times described his funeral as one with full military honors, including a horse, saddled and bridled, with boots reversed in the stirrups that followed the hearse. Members of Company E of the 7th Regiment, in which he once served, fired volleys over his grave. He was a member of the Ulysses S. Grant Post #327 of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization for Civil War veterans that also participated in his funeral. In addition, he belonged to the Masons and the Loyal Legion. He last lived in Whitestone, Queens. Section 179, lot 14416.\n\n1. Streight’s room; 2. Milroy’s room; 3. Commandant’s office; 4. Chickamauga room (upper); 5. Chickamauga room (lower); 6.

Colonel Calvin Pratt of the 31st commended Watts and other officers after First Bull Run, Virginia, “I deem it to be a duty to give the names of the officers of my regiment who were engaged in the battle, and to whose coolness and judgment I am indebted for the success that attended my regiment.”\n\nThe 1870 census lists Watts as a physician but according to the 1877 Brooklyn Directory, he was a druggist with a business at 1341 Fulton Street, where he took his own life. An article about his death appeared in the May 11, 1877, edition of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. His death, attributed to prussic acid, noted that he was in business for 34 years but, despondent over the death of his wife fifteen months earlier, was in financial trouble, and was turning to alcohol for solace. During the period after his wife’s death, he was forced to move his business from Columbia Street and sell his beloved house at 186 Dean Street for less than half of what he paid for it to pay off debts.

Grant Post #327’s book on its members:\n\nJames W. Webb was born in New York City on the 24th of May, 1845. In 1857, when he was but twelve years of age, he removed to Texas, where he lived with an uncle. Two years later he joined a company of Texas Rangers, and from that time to the breaking out of the civil war was engaged in fighting hostile Indians and lawless bands of Mexicans. In 1862 the company with which he was connected was mustered into the Confederate service at Vicksburg, Miss[issippi], but he remained true to the old flag and joined the secret service of the U.S. government. He was subsequently captured by guerillas, but made his escape.\n\nIn 1863, finding he was becoming too well known for secret service, he enlisted in the Thirteenth Tennessee (Union) Cavalry as private of Company C, commanded by Captain Logan. He was soon after appointed Quartermaster’s Sergeant, and while acting in this capacity was ordered with his regiment to Fort Pillow [Tennessee]. Not long after this the garrison, composed of 240 white and 360 colored troops, was attacked by the Confederates under General [Nathan Bedford] Forrest. The garrison made a gallant defense until their ammunition gave out, and they were about to surrender when the indiscriminate massacre of white and black troops commenced.\n\nAfter a number had been butchered in cold blood, Webb rushed up to [Confederate] General [James R.] Chalmers and said to him, “For God’s sake, General, stop the firing; our men are being all killed.” General Chalmers then went forward, and the firing soon afterwards ceased. Among the troops engaged in the attack were the Texas Rangers, the former comrades of Sergeant Webb. They conspired to take him out and hang him while a prisoner, but a Lieutenant, who was formerly a clerk in the store of Webb’s uncle, frustrated their designs and saved him. He, Webb, was taken, with fifty-nine other white men, and conveyed to Andersonville [Prison], where all but four died. These, together with Webb, were removed to Florence, Ala[bama], where two others died, leaving only Webb and one comrade. It is believed that he has since died, which would leave Sergeant Webb the only survivor of the Fort Pillow massacre. Webb was subsequently paroled, and after remaining in the hospital at Fort Schuyler for eleven months, was finally discharged by telegraphic order from the War Department.\n\nIn 1875, Webb became a patrolman with the Brooklyn Police Department and soon joined the Mounted Squad. He was a founding member of G.A.R. Post 327 and was part of honor guard assigned to the remains of Ulysses S. Grant when he lay in state at New York’s City Hall in 1885.”\n\nAccording to the 1896 Brooklyn City Directory, Webb was a policeman who lived at 60 Woodbine Street in Brooklyn. His obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle confirmed many of the details of his sketchbook biography and notes that he had scars on his forehead and left hand as a result of the Indian skirmishes during his time with the Texas Rangers. The obituary also reports that he worked at the Williamsburg Savings Bank after leaving the police force and was a Freemason. His last address was 1462 Dean Street in Brooklyn.

Of English birth, a passenger manifest documents that 14-year-old Samuel Webber arrived in New York City from Bristol, England on the Petrel, on July 14, 1856. During the Civil War, Webber enlisted at Westfield, New York, as a private, on December 17, 1863, and mustered into the 15th New York Cavalry on that date. As per his muster roll, he was a laborer who was 5′ 8″ tall with hazel eyes, light hair and a light complexion.\n\nOn May 3, 1864, he was taken as a prisoner of war and sent to Andersonville Prison in Georgia. The prison was constructed in early 1864 to provide a more secure location for Union prisoners. Officially known as Camp Sumter because of the county in which it was housed and only in existence for fourteen months, the National Park Service website reports that of the 45,000 Union soldiers incarcerated there, almost 13,000 died from disease, poor sanitation, malnutrition, overcrowding or exposure. In August 1864, 33,000 men were imprisoned at the site built to house 10,000. A fifteen foot high stockade wall surrounded the prison, shaped like a parallelogram. There was a so-called “deadline,”19 feet inside the wall that prisoners were not allowed to cross; if they did so, guards had permission to shoot them. The National Park Service website quotes Sergeant Samuel Corthell of the 4th Massachusetts Cavalry who remembered:\n\nThe camp was covered with vermin all over. You could not sit down anywhere. You might go and pick the lice all off of you, and sit down for a half a moment and get up and you would be covered with them. In between these two hills it was very swampy, all black mud, and where the filth was emptied it was all alive; there was a regular buzz there all the time, and it was covered with large white maggots.\n\nBy the time General William T. Sherman occupied Atlanta on September 2, 1864, moving Federal cavalry within striking distance of Andersonville, the Confederate army moved most of the prisoners to other camps in coastal Georgia or South Carolina. From then to the end of the war, Andersonville operated on a smaller scale until it stopped operations in May 1865. Ultimately, only 460 graves of Union soldiers interred there were marked “unknown”; other graves are marked in Andersonville National Cemetery. In 1890, the Georgia Department of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union veterans organization, purchased the land where the prison camp had stood and sold it for one dollar to their affiliate, the Woman’s Relief Corps (WRC) which planted pecan trees and began erecting commemorative monuments. In 1910, the group donated the prison to the people of the United States to be administered by the War Department. In October 1970, it was designated a national historic site, and since then it has been administered by the National Park Service.\n\nWebber was exchanged, as per prison records, on April 1, 1865. That paperwork noted that he was a corporal; his muster roll does not indicate that promotion. Other sources state a release date of April 29, 1865. According to his muster roll, he mustered out at New York City on June 12, 1865 to date from May 16, 1865. A book of Andersonville prisoners, shared by a descendant and pictured below, was given to Webber in 1882.\n\nThe 1870 census reports that he was a blacksmith who lived in New York City with his wife Annie and a three-year-old son also named Samuel. Webber mustered into the Grand Army of the Republic on December 21, 1888. His last residence was 209 East 80th Street in Manhattan. Green-Wood records note that he was married at the time of his death attributed to injuries. Another Samuel Webber (possibly his son) was interred in Samuel Sr.’s grave in 1894. His United States-issued headstone notes his rank as private. Section 135, lot 27263, grave 556.\n\nWEBER, PHILIP (1835-1911). Private, 20th New York Infantry, Company F.

While on its journey, the ship ran aground at Chincoteague Shoals, where it remained for 24 hours before it was set afloat and proceeded to New York City.\n\nAlthough Weeden was scheduled to muster out with his company on September 12, 1862, he died in transit to his hometown on September 10 of typhus fever; his soldier record notes the muster out date but not his death. As per an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on September 13, 1862, members of Company H turned out to escort his body to his gravesite at Green-Wood. Military honors were performed at his burial.

It is possible that Daniel Weir is the son of Donald Weir (see). Section 166, lot 4073, grave 197.\n\nWEIR (or WIER), DONALD M. (1821-1861). Private, 84th New York (14th Brooklyn) Infantry, Company I. Weir was born in Scotland and came to America in 1850. Shortly after he enlisted at Brooklyn at the age of 39, and mustered in on July 1, 1861, Weir died of disease at Arlington, Virginia, on July 28, 1861. Anna Weir, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1868, certificate 162,704.\n\nOn the occasion of Anna Weir’s 96th birthday, an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle was written about her in which she said that she lost her husband and son, who was named after Donald, in the Civil War. She said, “You see, the great conflict between the North and the South robbed me of two of my dear ones. My husband, Donald M. Weir, and my son did their full duty as every man ought when his country calls.” That article and her obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union note that her husband died at Second Bull Run in 1862. However, that information conflicts with her husband’s soldier record which states that he died a year earlier of disease. Anna Weir recalled that her son returned to Brooklyn but died of disease contracted during the War. It is possible that Daniel Weir (see) is the son of Donald Weir. Donald Weir’s remains were moved to Green-Wood in 1893. Section 166, lot 28472.\n\nWEIR, HENRY CARY (1840-1927).

According to the citation, “the division being hard pressed and falling back, he dismounted, gave his horse to a wounded officer enabling the latter to escape, and on foot rallied and took command of some stragglers, and with pistol in hand helped repel the last charge of the enemy.” Weir was also brevetted major for that action on August 1, 1864.\n\nOn September 9 of that year, he was promoted to captain and assistant adjutant general and commissioned into the Adjutant General’s Department of United States Volunteers.

On December 24-25, the Canonicus participated in the bombardment of Fort Fisher, North Carolina. In mid-January 1865, the ship, part of a large fleet, shelled the fort before a successful Union ground assault, effectively closing the port of Wilmington to blockade runners. The ship was then stationed off Charleston, South Carolina. A mission to Havana, Cuba, in April, to intercept the Confederate ironclad Stonewall, was cut short due to the end of the War. Weld was honorably discharged on May 27, 1865.\n\nIn his letter of resignation to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles from the USS John Adams on that date, he wrote, “Having entered the service out of patriotic motives to aid our Government in apprehending traitors and putting down treason, and as our Government has succeeded in establishing itself throughout the land, also in bringing the authors of this unholy war to their just deserts, I would most respectfully resign my position as an Acting Ensign of the Navy in the United States in temporary service.” Weld’s papers which are included in Records of Southern Plantations from Emancipation to the Great Migration edited by Ira Berlin are on microfilm at Duke University Library. They indicate that, after the War, he was an agent for the Freedman’s Bureau in North Carolina. In Weld’s writings of that period, he records disputes over crops, animals, and unpaid debts, and efforts by African-American men to reunite with their families.\n\nA Columbia Law School graduate, class of 1871, he was a practicing lawyer as per the New York City Directory of 1876.

Weld, in a sworn affidavit for a widow’s pension, stated that her husband had no life insurance and left her no property or money necessitating that she support herself by her own labor.

He was discharged from military service on June 28, 1865, at Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nAfter studying law at Columbia Law School, Wells was admitted to the bar in 1869, and practiced in New York for the rest of his life. According to an article in The New York Times on December 20, 1887, he was elected president of the National Rod and Reel Association. He wrote Fly Rods and Fly Tackle, The American Salmon Fisherman, A City Boy in the Woods and numerous articles about hunting and fishing and protecting fish at seaports. On July 6, 1901, an article in The New York Times favorably reviewed his work, Fly Rods and Tackle, quoting Wells, “A fly fisherman is par excellence an artist. To be an artist, he must fish with his brains. He does not care for the number of fish he may catch, but how he secures them. It is the way the thing is done- this and the open air, the odor of the woods and flowers, the laughter of the running water the beauty and song of the birds, and that peace and content which open the heart of man to see and love the ever-changing beauties of nature – these give the pastime a charm possessed by no other.” The review went on to praise Wells’s work for its descriptions of rods, of which he preferred bamboo, reels, and flies and his anecdotes that showed how an Easterner could successfully fly-fish to the astonishment of Westerners. According to his obituary in the New York Evening Post, he last lived at 168 Clinton Street in Brooklyn.
