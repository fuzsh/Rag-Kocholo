I knew where he was, and as a\n\ncombat veteran of Vietnam, I understood that even\n\nI wasn’t allowed there.\n\nIn case others learned of his presence, I stayed\n\nbehind him, prepared to stop anyone from invading his thoughts. I never told\n\nhim that, nor did I introduce myself as he joined our launch for the return trip.\n\nIt’s a veteran thing.\n\n– Jon Johnson, Sidney, Ohio\n\n‘The Big Chill’\n\nI was pleased to read Alan\n\nDowd’s timely warning of the\n\nsituation in the Arctic (December). Our outdated Coast Guard\n\nbreakers haven’t been available\n\neven to break a channel into\n\nour McMurdo Station for the\n\nannual resupply of that base\n\nand the South Pole. For two\n\nyears, we hired Swedish breakers. This year, the National\n\nScience Foundation had to hire\n\na commercial Russian breaker,\n\navailable at the last minute.\n\nWe should be building a ﬂeet\n\nof mostly nuclear-powered\n\nbreakers, capable of clearing the\n\nthickest ice packs and with\n\nsustained cruising and resupply\n\ncapabilities. Why must our\n\npoliticians always lead us into\n\nworld affairs with our pants\n\ndown? We will end up paying\n\ndearly for not attending to\n\nbusiness in the Arctic.\n\n– David N. Grisez, Logansport, Ind.\n\n‘Tapped’\n\nI believe the American public\n\nwould embrace whatever it\n\ntakes to balance our budget if\n\nthe government would make the\n\nnecessary cuts to the real\n\nFEBRUARY 2012\n\nproblems: the Department of\n\nEducation, the Environmental\n\nProtection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices, the Department of\n\nEnergy, etc., most of which have\n\nbeen total failures.\n\nIt’s not hard to ﬁgure out that\n\nthis administration will not stop\n\nthe spending, even if we cut the\n\nmilitary budget or Medicare or\n\nMedicaid. It’ll just give more of\n\nour dollars to another Solyndra.\n\nDespite the liberal media\n\ncovering for the president and\n\nhis czars, Americans are\n\nbeginning to see the truth.\n\n– Kristen Bright, Slidell, La.\n\nIt upsets me to hear that to\n\nreduce the deﬁcit you must cut\n\nSocial Security and Medicare.\n\nThe Congressional Budget\n\nOfﬁce vomits up all kinds of\n\nfancy graphs that don’t mean\n\nanything. One side of their\n\nmouth says to cut Social\n\nSecurity, and the other gives a\n\ncost-of-living adjustment. The\n\nfund was adequate until Congress stuck its hands into it.\n\nWhatever happened to the\n\n“lockbox”?\n\n|\n\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION MAGAZINE\n\n5\n\nDefense contractors, doctors\n\nand hospitals all overcharge the\n\ngovernment because it doesn’t\n\nfollow up on what it’s charged\n\nfor, and for how much. The\n\ngovernment is getting screwed\n\nand doesn’t know it, or it does\n\nand won’t do anything about it.\n\n– John Sieradski, Lapeer, Mich.\n\nRon Haskins does little to\n\naddress congressional waste in\n\nspending, earmarks, and money\n\nspent on agendas and groups\n\nrarely veriﬁed. He doesn’t\n\nmention the biggest cost to\n\ntaxpayers: the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. How about Congress\n\ntaking a pay cut, paying into\n\nSocial Security, paying for health\n\ncare and cutting its own entitlements? They work for us, not the\n\nother way around.\n\nwon’t get the full increases\n\nincluded in its submitted budget,\n\nusually more than the inﬂation\n\nrate. So if the defense budget is\n\n$450 billion, a 10-percent cut\n\ndoesn’t mean the agency will get\n\n$405 billion; it will get at least\n\n$450 billion. As a a budget\n\nofﬁcer in a federal department,\n\nI saw this mindset for years and\n\nstill shake my head when people\n\ntry to defend this process.\n\n– David F. Jensen, Cove, Ore.\n\nIt is frightening to think that\n\nlegislators with no more knowledge than Rep. Lynn Woolsey\n\nmake major decisions on our\n\nnational defense. She calls for\n\ncutting missile defense at a time\n\nwhen our biggest threat may be\n\na missile with a nuclear warhead\n\ncoming from a rogue state.\n\n– Paul Gardner, Belvidere, Ill.\n\n– Mark Newlin, Tell City, Ind.\n\nDefense budget cuts\n\nIt disgusts me to read ﬂagwaving articles such as Rep. J.\n\nRandy Forbes’ lament over\n\nupcoming DoD budget cuts (Big\n\nIssues, December). “A smaller\n\nforce will mean ... more time\n\ndeployed.” To where? The Iraq\n\nand Afghanistan campaigns are\n\nwinding down. I’d rather see our\n\nmilitary transition to jobs related\n\nto the nation’s infrastructure or\n\nrenewable energy.\n\n‘The Math on Military\n\nRetirement’\n\nI read Michael Montaney’s\n\narticle with interest (December).\n\nThe situation for a retiree like\n\nme is even less of the “too\n\ngenerous” compensation some\n\ncritics claim. My 20 years were\n\n1945 to 1966. I retired from the\n\nAir Force as a master sergeant.\n\nMy current retirement pay before\n\ndeductions is $1,478 per month,\n\ninstead of $2,094. This illustrates\n\nthe effect of 45 years of inﬂation\n\nand the failure of the so-called\n\nCOLA to keep up with reality.\n\n– Arthur P. Corby, St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nWhen talking about so-called\n\ncuts in the defense budget, one\n\nneeds to consider exactly what\n\nthose are. When a taxpayer talks\n\nabout cutting down on his\n\nexpenses, it means he’ll actually\n\nspend less money. But in a\n\nfederal agency, that means it\n\n– James Melcher, Columbia, Miss.\n\nWhen I volunteered, I was not\n\npromised the ability to retire\n\nafter 20 years. I was promised\n\nthe ability to receive a retirement\n\nbeneﬁt. There is a difference.\n\nThis article fails to mention that\n\n20-year military retirees receive\n\ntheir beneﬁt in their 40s, while\n\nmost of the working world has to\n\nwait until 65. That’s an additional 20-plus years of beneﬁts.\n\nMontaney also alludes to the\n\nfact that there is no time-and-ahalf or double-time pay in the\n\nmilitary. A large segment of the\n\nworking world doesn’t receive\n\nthese, either.\n\nI am on the side that advocates\n\nthat military retirement pay start\n\nat 55, not immediately. He makes\n\nretirement sound like an entitlement, not the beneﬁt it was\n\ndesigned to be. This mentality is\n\nwhat has our state and federal\n\nbudgets bleeding red ink.\n\n– Gene Kozaczki, Edinboro, Pa.\n\nWhen civilians grouse about\n\nmilitary “pensions,” I correct\n\nthem by asserting that my\n\nretirement check only represents\n\ndeferred compensation. For over\n\n20 years, we worked for less\n\nthan half of our civilian earning\n\ncapacity. The incentive to do so\n\nwas a patriotic sense of duty, but\n\nwe also knew we’d eventually be\n\nrepaid that deﬁcit.

Ronald Reagan\n\nand Strom Thurmond were Democrats before they were Republicans.\n\nHillary Clinton started out as a Republican, as did Defense Secretary\n\nLeon Panetta, who once worked in the Nixon administration. The\n\nAmerican Legion’s principles, however, have endured through the\n\ndecades, sometimes political but never partisan.\n\nBy the ﬁ rst American Legion National Convention, the organization’s\n\nfounders fully understood the political potential of an association of war\n\nveterans whose membership had soared to 684,000 in a matter of eight\n\nmonths. More than 5,000 posts had sprung up coast to coast, stitching\n\nthe Legion’s presence into the fabric of our nation. By the end of 1919,\n\nthe Legion was poised to inﬂuence politics at every level.\n\nThe temptation to march the Legion’s growing membership onto the\n\nbattleﬁeld of partisan politics was difﬁcult to resist. At the ﬁ rst national\n\nconvention, and in the years that followed, Article II, Section 2 of the\n\nLegion’s constitution was the subject of heated debate. Today, it reads:\n\n“The American Legion shall be absolutely nonpolitical and shall not be\n\nused for the dissemination of partisan principles nor for the promotion of\n\nthe candidacy of any person seeking public office or preferment.”\n\nThis means that The American Legion does not endorse candidates.\n\nIndividual members cannot seek political ofﬁce while simultaneously\n\nholding ofﬁce in the Legion. If they wish to run for a public seat – and\n\nmany have, quite successfully – they must keep their Legion membership separate and resign from any post, department or national ofﬁce\n\nbefore ﬁ ling. Article II, Section 2 means checking your Legion cap at the\n\ndoor of any political rallies, fundraisers or conventions.\n\nIn the early years, some saw this rule as a missed opportunity to get\n\nfriends of the organization elected and keep enemies out. Thankfully,\n\ncooler heads prevailed, and the Legion’s party neutrality strengthened\n\nthe organization’s integrity in Washington, as it still does.\n\nAs the 2012 election year unfolds, we must remember how important\n\nthat one sentence of our constitution is to the overall effectiveness of the\n\nLegion. Article II, Section 2 was the essential ﬁ rst step in a journey that\n\nhelped the Legion create VA, pass the GI Bill, and ensure compassionate\n\ncare and beneﬁts for veterans and their families.\n\nCombine our nonpartisan mandate with an organizational structure\n\nthat empowers individuals to advance ideas and set in motion national\n\nresolutions, and you get what historian Richard Seelye Jones called\n\n“the machinery and the membership to convert principles into policies,\n\nto solve problems and to activate decisions. It was all arranged in the\n\nsimple terms of an American democracy.”\n\nNot a bad arrangement, if you ask me.\n\nChase Studios\n\n– Richard Seelye Jones, “A History of The American Legion,” \n\nNational Commander\n\nFang A.

One theory about the\n\nincrease in celiac cases is\n\nunderdeveloped immune\n\nsystems – in other words, we live\n\nin a society that’s too clean. The\n\nincrease could also be traced to\n\ngrains that contain more gluten,\n\nthe oﬀending protein, than they\n\ndid  years ago.\n\nPeople who suspect they have\n\nceliac disease can be screened\n\nwith a simple blood test. The only\n\ntreatment is a gluten-free diet.\n\nBeyond the long-term health\n\nproblems, obesity makes every\n\nday more challenging. Last year,\n\nan Annals of Internal Medicine\n\nsurvey found that older adults\n\nwho are obese are more likely to\n\nreport problems with daily\n\nactivities like bathing, dressing\n\nand going to the bathroom.\n\nLosing just 5 to 10 percent of\n\nyour weight (i.e., 10 to 20 pounds\n\nif you weigh 200) can delay or\n\neven prevent health problems.\n\nOne federally funded study found\n\nthat losing this amount of weight\n\nand increasing physical activity\n\nto 30 minutes a day, ﬁve days a\n\nweek, reduces the risk of developing diabetes by 71 percent\n\namong those 60 and older.\n\nNo matter how old you are,\n\nlosing weight is never easy. But\n\nthe slowing metabolism of age\n\nmakes it more difﬁcult. If you eat\n\nand exercise the same way you\n\ndid in your 30s, you’ll only gain\n\nweight. You need to step it up.\n\nON THE DIET SIDE\n\nEducate yourself about nutrition\n\nand healthy eating.

See full Prescribing Information for complete\n\nproduct information.\n\nWhat is the most important information I should\n\nknow about ADVAIR DISKUS?\n\nADVAIR DISKUS can cause serious side effects, including:\n\n1. People with asthma who take long-acting beta2adrenergic agonist (LABA) medicines, such as\n\nsalmeterol (one of the medicines in ADVAIR DISKUS),\n\nhave an increased risk of death from asthma\n\nproblems. It is not known whether ﬂuticasone propionate,\n\nthe other medicine in ADVAIR DISKUS, reduces the risk of\n\ndeath from asthma problems seen with salmeterol.\n\n• Call your healthcare provider if breathing problems\n\nworsen over time while using ADVAIR DISKUS. You\n\nmay need different treatment.\n\n• Get emergency medical care if:\n\n- breathing problems worsen quickly and\n\n- you use your rescue inhaler medicine, but it does not\n\nrelieve your breathing problems.\n\n2. ADVAIR DISKUS should be used only if your healthcare\n\nprovider decides that your asthma is not well controlled\n\nwith a long-term asthma control medicine, such as\n\ninhaled corticosteroids.\n\n3. When your asthma is well controlled, your healthcare\n\nprovider may tell you to stop taking ADVAIR DISKUS. Your\n\nhealthcare provider will decide if you can stop ADVAIR\n\nDISKUS without loss of asthma control. Your healthcare\n\nprovider may prescribe a different asthma control\n\nmedicine for you, such as an inhaled corticosteroid.\n\n4. Children and adolescents who take LABA medicines may\n\nhave an increased risk of being hospitalized for asthma\n\nproblems.\n\nWhat is ADVAIR DISKUS?\n\n• ADVAIR DISKUS combines an inhaled corticosteroid\n\nmedicine, ﬂuticasone propionate (the same medicine\n\nfound in FLOVENT®), and a LABA medicine, salmeterol\n\n(the same medicine found in SEREVENT®).\n\n- Inhaled corticosteroids help to decrease inﬂammation in\n\nthe lungs. Inﬂammation in the lungs can lead to asthma\n\nsymptoms.\n\n- LABA medicines are used in people with asthma and\n\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). LABA\n\nmedicines help the muscles around the airways in your\n\nlungs stay relaxed to prevent symptoms, such as wheezing\n\nand shortness of breath. These symptoms can happen\n\nwhen the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes\n\nit hard to breathe. In severe cases, wheezing can stop your\n\nbreathing and cause death if not treated right away.\n\n• ADVAIR DISKUS is used for asthma and COPD as follows:\n\nAsthma\n\nADVAIR DISKUS is used to control symptoms of asthma\n\nand to prevent symptoms such as wheezing in adults and\n\nchildren aged 4 years and older.\n\nADVAIR DISKUS contains salmeterol (the same medicine\n\nfound in SEREVENT). LABA medicines, such as salmeterol,\n\nincrease the risk of death from asthma problems.\n\nADVAIR DISKUS is not for adults and children with asthma\n\nwho are well controlled with an asthma control\n\nmedicine, such as a low to medium dose of an inhaled\n\ncorticosteroid medicine.\n\nCOPD\n\nCOPD is a chronic lung disease that includes chronic\n\nbronchitis, emphysema, or both. ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50\n\nis used long term, 2 times each day to help improve lung\n\nfunction for better breathing in adults with COPD.\n\nADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 has been shown to decrease\n\nthe number of flare-ups and worsening of COPD\n\nsymptoms (exacerbations).\n\n• if you have a severe allergy to milk proteins. Ask your\n\ndoctor if you are not sure.\n\nWhat should I tell my healthcare provider before\n\nusing ADVAIR DISKUS?\n\nTell your healthcare provider about all of your health\n\nconditions, including if you:\n\n• have heart problems • have high blood pressure\n\n• have seizures\n\n• have thyroid problems\n\n• have diabetes\n\n• have liver problems\n\n• have osteoporosis\n\n• have an immune system problem\n\n• are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

Through the\n\ndecades, Legionnaire lobbyists have helped\n\npreserve veterans beneﬁts in times of ﬁscal crisis,\n\nand pushed lawmakers, as well as the White\n\nHouse, to ensure that former military personnel\n\nand their families receive services and\n\nopportunities worthy of their sacriﬁces.\n\nThe Legion has marched boldly into battle\n\nfor such values as ﬂag protection, a\n\nwell-funded military and relief for the\n\ncaregivers of severely wounded veterans.\n\nLess well-known than the Legion’s\n\naccomplishments in the legislative and\n\nexecutive branches of government is its role in\n\nthe judicial branch. Through the ﬁling of amicus curiae – friend of\n\nthe court – briefs, The American Legion weighs in on cases central\n\nto the organization’s resolutions and values. In recent years, the\n\nLegion has ﬁled friend-of-the-court briefs on cases related to such\n\nissues as freedom of religion, military recruiting practices, Boy\n\nScouts of America and the integrity of military medals.\n\n“Through ﬁling these briefs in federal courts, we are able to\n\nexpress how important these issues are to veterans,” American\n\nLegion National Judge Advocate Philip B. Onderdonk says. “We\n\nhave a solid team of attorneys across the country who respect The\n\nAmerican Legion and veterans enough to want to write amicus\n\nbriefs on our behalf.”\n\nThe following pages spotlight some of the more recent cases, the\n\nLegion’s amici curiae, and how the courts have ruled.\n\n20\n\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION MAGAZINE\n\n|\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nUARY 2012\n\nMedia Bakery\n\n)\n\nur t (\n\nreme Co\n\np\n\nu\n\nS\n\n.\n\nt could\n\n.S\n\n|U\n\nR\n\nernmen\n\nI\n\nv\n\no\n\nA\n\ng\n\ns\n\nF\n\nl\n\nie\n\n.\n\nra\n\nit\n\nv\n\ne\n\ners\n\nld\n\nfed\n\ncruiters.\n\nRumsfe ruiting at Public Unoivn Amendment, thaeccess to military re\n\nop en\n\nm\n\ng\n\nxcluding\n\nc\n\ne\n\ne\n\nlo\n\nin\n\ns\n\no\n\nR\n\ny\n\nS\n\nc\n\ny\n\nfu\n\nli\n\nr\n\ne\n\no\n\nre\n\na\n\n’s p\n\nm\n\nMilit\n\nwn as th lic universities\n\nmilitar y\n\niters fro\n\nlaw kno\n\ned recru\n\nsis of the\n\nm p ub\n\na\n\nd\n\no\n\nb\n\nlu\n\nUn d e r a\n\nfr\n\nc\n\ne\n\nx\n\ng\n\nth\n\ne\n\nin\n\nr\n\nula\n\nfund\n\ne so on\n\nin par tic\n\nwithhold rsities had don\n\nschools\n\ninator y.\n\nw\n\ne\n\na\n\nm\n\nL\n\niv\n\nri\n\noﬃcers,\n\n.\n\nn\n\nc\n\ne\n\nu\n\nis\n\nser vic\n\nualiﬁed\n\nMany\n\nc y as d\n\nq\n\nm\n\nli\n\no\n\nly\n\no\n\nfr\n\nh\n\nd with\n\np\n\nls\n\nig\n\ne\n\na\n\nh\n\nxu\n\ncruit\n\nbly boun l\n\nwing th\n\na\n\nre\n\nie\n\nic\n\nv\n\nto\n\ntr\n\n,\n\nh o m os e\n\ny\n\nx\n\nts\n\ne\n\nit\n\nn\n\nil\n\ntiona\n\nds is in\n\ny’s ab\n\npus eve\n\nct the na access\n\ne militar erse backgroun\n\nte\n\non-cam\n\nh\n\nT\n\nro\n\n:\n\np\n\ns\n\nu\n\nic\n\niv\n\nual\n\nble to\n\nion’s am\n\ns, from d\n\nds o n e q\n\nilitar y, a\n\nT h e Le g\n\ng dep en\n\nadvocate g, competent m\n\nin\n\ne\n\nit\n\ng\n\nd\n\nru\n\nc\n\nju\n\ng\n\non\n\ner re\n\nincludin\n\ns since\n\nvide a str s.

Paulson | U.S. Supreme Court ()\n\nConstitutionality of a Latin Cross as War Memorial\n\nFirst built in , and rebuilt twice, the Mount Soledad cross is a -foot-tall Latin\n\ncross that towers over San Diego. Though it is designated as a national war\n\nmemorial, the cross has been the focus of legal controversy, with various litigants\n\narguing that its presence on federal land violates the First Amendment of the\n\nU.S. Constitution and the “no-preference clause” of the California Constitution by\n\ndemonstrating preference to a speciﬁc religion.\n\nThe Legion’s amicus: The Mount Soledad cross has stood as a veterans memorial\n\nfor more than  years. Today, the memorial is accompanied by more than ,\n\nplaques bearing names, messages and etched images of veterans. A U.S. ﬂag\n\nstands at the memorial, paying tribute to the cause of freedom. Brick pavers bear\n\nadditional messages honoring veterans and supporters of Mount Soledad. This\n\ncollection of messages honoring our nation’s heroes, accompanied by the\n\nmemorial cross, sends a diverse message of appreciation for the gallantry and\n\npatriotism of those who gave their lives for the rest of us. Veterans throughout the\n\nnation’s history have sacriﬁced their lives for something greater than themselves.\n\nThe Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial honors that sacriﬁce.\n\nHow the court ruled: The case continues. In Paulson, even though the Supreme\n\nCourt stayed the order of the Ninth Circuit to move or destroy the memorial, a\n\nsubsequent hearing by the Circuit Court once again held that it violated the\n\nestablishment clause, and refused hearing by the full Ninth Circuit.

Rumsfeld | U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit ()\n\nDoD Involvement in the National Scout Jamboree\n\nAmerican Legion posts sponsor more than , Scouting units across the\n\ncountry. The relationship between the two organizations extends back to ,\n\nwhen support for the Boy Scouts was among the ﬁrst resolutions passed by\n\nThe American Legion. When the Scouts were sued for not allowing an openly\n\ngay man to serve as a leader and the Scout Oath was questioned because it\n\nreferences God, the Legion argued that with the right to associate freely came\n\nthe right to not associate with those who do not ascribe to the religious basis\n\nfor the group. In Winkler, the Supreme Court was tasked with deciding whether\n\nthis religious basis for Scouting, and DoD participation in the National Scout\n\nJamboree at Fort A.P. Hill, violated the constitutional imperative that “Congress\n\nshall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the\n\nfree exercise thereof.”\n\nThe Legion’s amicus: The case presents a grave challenge to any voluntary\n\norganization. It is a case about the freedom of association, masquerading as a\n\ncase about the establishment of religion. For if the acknowledgment of God is\n\ndeemed suﬃcient to adjudge the Boy Scouts ineligible for nonreligious\n\nsupport from the military, consistent with the military’s own recruitment,\n\npublic relations and training goals, then any number of other voluntary\n\norganizations with theistic roots will be equally aﬀected. If allowed to stand,\n\nthe decision of the district court would greatly limit the fundamental liberty of\n\na voluntary organization to endorse traditional American values without\n\nsuﬀering a governmental penalty because of its viewpoint. Thus, this case is, in\n\nthe end, about the core American virtues of freedom to speak and freedom to\n\nassociate – the very freedoms that Legion\n\nmembers fought to preserve through their\n\neir\n\nwartime service.\n\nThe bulk of the message sent by the\n\nmilitary’s presence at the National Scout\n\nJamboree is about the military’s own\n\npublic relations and recruitment interests.\n\ns.\n\nAny even implicit endorsement of the Boyy\n\nScouts would necessarily and primarily bee\n\nunderstood to endorse the civic and\n\npatriotic aspects of the organization.\n\nGiven the multiple attenuated steps\n\nbetween authorizing (though not\n\nrequiring) support for the jamboree,\n\nﬁnding implied support of the limited\n\nreligious component of the Boy Scouts’\n\nprinciples, and any actual eﬀect of\n\npromoting religion, such eﬀect would\n\ncertainly not be the primary eﬀect of\n\nDoD’s activities.\n\nHow the court ruled: The U.S. Court of\n\nAppeals determined in April  that\n\nthe Rev. Eugene Winkler had no legal\n\nstanding to bring the suit in the ﬁrst\n\nplace, thus ending it and aﬃrming\n\nthat the military may assist future\n\njamborees, including providing campsitess at Fort A.P. Hill.\n\nAlthough the court did not address the broader\n\nroader implications of the\n\nconstitutional question, the Boy Scouts announced shortly after the ruling that\n\nit intended to choose a new site for national jamborees.\n\n24\n\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION MAGAZINE\n\n|\n\nFEBRUARY 2012\n\nPhotos by James\n\nV.

The festival receives\n\npromotional support from The American Legion.\n\n“The Wereth Eleven” tells a story that’s been\n\nlargely forgotten, except for the soldiers’ families\n\nand citizens of the Belgian town where the murders\n\ntook place. The all-black 333rd Field Artillery\n\nBattalion landed at Utah Beach on June 29, 1944.\n\nWhen the Germans began shelling the village of\n\nSchönberg, Belgium, on Dec. 16, the unit was\n\noverrun. Those who weren’t killed were forced to\n\nsurrender, with most ending up in prison camps for\n\nthe remainder of the war. A truck full of soldiers\n\nfrom the 333rd managed to evacuate, but eventually it was stopped by German forces, and its\n\npassengers taken prisoner. Straﬁng gunﬁre by\n\nU.S. planes allowed some of the soldiers\n\nto slip away, and they met other escapees\n\nin the woods.\n\nThe Wereth 11 walked 10 miles\n\nthrough heavy snow to the\n\nhamlet of Wereth, in a part of\n\nIn “The Wereth Eleven,” real\n\nU.S. servicemembers portray\n\nthe soldiers of the 333rd Field\n\nArtillery Battalion, and\n\nGerman re-enactors play\n\nthe parts of SS oﬃcers.\n\nPhotos courtesy Janson Media\n\n28\n\nTHE\n\nE AMERICAN LEGION\n\nLEG\n\nGION\n\nNM\n\nMAGAZINE\n\nAG\n\nAGA\n\nA\n\nG\n\nGA\n\nAZIINE\n\nIN\n\nN\n\nNE\n\nE\n\n|\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nF\n\nEB\n\nEBR\n\nEBRU\n\nE\n\nBR\n\nB\n\nBRU\n\nR\n\nRU\n\nRUAR\n\nUAR\n\nAR\n\nRY\n\nY 22012\n\n201\n\n20\n\n0112\n\n0012\n\n12\n\nBelgium that had belonged to Germany until World\n\nWar I.
