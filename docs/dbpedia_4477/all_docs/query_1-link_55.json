        "text": "Shaun Illingworth: This begins an interview with Mr. Stuart J. Freedman on June 13, 2006, in New Brunswick, NeShaun Illingworth: This begins an interview with Mr. Stuart J. Freedman on June 13, 2006, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with Shaun Illingworth. Thank you very much for coming in today.\n\nStuart Freedman: My pleasure.\n\nSI: To begin, can you tell me where and when you were born?\n\nSF: Yes, in Brookline, Massachusetts, on October 14, 1939.\n\nSI: Your father was born in Massachusetts. Can you tell me how your family came to settle in Massachusetts?\n\nSF: Well, my grandparents, Zeva and Sarah Freedman, came over from Russia or Poland, as most Eastern European Jews did. ... Instead of landing in Ellis Island, they evidently landed somewhere off of Boston and settled in a town called Chelsea, Massachusetts, which is mostly known for holding up the far end of the Mystic River Bridge now, if you're in Boston. My dad was one of five brothers and I think ... these grandparents came over with ... my Uncle Harry, as an infant, and then, four brothers were born here in the United States. The interesting thing, looking at them, they were just the right age, so, they were too young to serve in World War I and too old to serve in World War II. [laughter]\n\nSI: Your father did work in a shipyard, which I want to ask you about.\n\nSF: Yes, yes.\n\nSI: Do you know anything more specific about where they were from in Eastern Europe?\n\nSF: Yes. ... I think one of my grandparents might have been from Lithuania. The other one was from, probably, in Minsk or Pinsk. They always talked about those Russian cities, but the Jews sometimes had to travel so much. ... I never really got a chance to talk a great deal with ... that grandparent, most of which was because he spoke a limited amount of English, although he was in business in the United States. ... I was too young, really, to appreciate him. It was my other grandfather, David Ruby, who I did speak to a great deal, on my maternal side, the Canadian.\n\nSI: There are no stories that came down on that side of the family about life in Russia, pogroms.\n\nSF: No, no, no.\n\nSI: Was your father basically raised in the Chelsea area?\n\nSF: Yes, he was, yes.\n\nSI: You mentioned that your grandfather had a business. Do you remember what he did?\n\nSF: Oh, yes. ... Well, I guess he started selling coal and ice, basically, he was a peddler with a pushcart, and it ended up, somehow; ... well, the ice boxes were replaced by refrigeration, and then, it was coal, and then, it emerged into rags, which became a textile business, that my Uncle Harry went into with him. They would sell industrial wiping for tools. Just basically, they would collect old clothes, I guess, old rags, and reprocess them, so that industries could use them in cleaning, what they call industrial wiping. My dad was never in that business. My dad was fortunate. ... They sent my dad to what is now Bentley College, and then, it was a two-year school, for accounting and finance, and I guess one other uncle graduated college. He was a pharmacist, so, he must have gone to college. My dad then took that accounting background and somehow got involved, I guess maybe it was his first job, in the building wrecking business. ... He ended up owning his own company, which he wasn't very successful at, but that's the business that he chose. That's kind of his career path, but, then, later in life, he went back to accountancy. ... To skip chronologically, when those businesses failed, that ... kind of got us to New Jersey, because he kind of restarted in business as an accountant when we moved down from Boston.\n\nSI: Do you know if your other uncles went into that business?\n\nSF: Oh, just my Uncle Harry. I guess my Uncle Max, who we always used to call Moishe, which was the Hebrew variation of that, which means \"Moses,\" he helped my grandfather. Uncle Harry and Max, they were both involved in the business. Uncle Jack was also a kind of an accountant and, in fact, my dad hired him at one point, when my dad had his own business. So, he was in and out of different jobs. Somewhere along the line, before I was born, there was a sister who didn't survive, maybe an infant death or so and so. So, they had one sister, and my grandfather was quite a character, because he was married three times. ... My grandmother, Sarah, passed away before I was born. Then, he married some other woman who was basically known as \"the second wife,\" and then, when she passed away, he was somewhere in his eighties and he felt no one should be single, so, there was this widow at the synagogue and he married the third time. ... The Yiddish word for grandfather was zayde, which means \"grandfather.\" That's all we used to call him and he was a classic guy. He always wore a yarmulke, of the old-fashioned kind, and was, I take it, very religious.\n\n[TAPE PAUSED]\n\nSI: You were telling me about your father's family and your grandfather, Zeva Freedman.\n\nSF: Yes, and I think ... I was a freshman or sophomore in law school when he passed away, because I remember going up and trying to help settle his estate and so forth. I have one little story. ... One of the classic things we used to do, I was thinking about it when I was driving down here today. ... We lived in Brighton at the time, which is actually a part of Boston, near Boston College, and, on Sunday afternoons, my dad and my mom and I would jump in the car and we would drive ... for a Sunday afternoon visit to my grandfather and his second wife in Chelsea. ... I have this vague recollection of a Sunday drive, and I must have been about; ... it's hard to believe I have the impression, but I was two and something, I guess. ... So, it would have been December of 1941, yes, and I remember the radio breaking in with word of the news of Pearl Harbor, and them trying to kind of explain. ... My parents were shocked and I couldn't quite make sense of it, but, kind of, I also remember growing up and the news used to come on, where people would listen to those radio newsmen like Gabriel Heater. ... The news would come in at six or seven, while you were in dinner, and everybody would listen to the radio and it was all war news. It was, you know, \"This was happening in the Pacific,\" and, \"This was happening in Europe or Africa.\" ... A classic thing, I kind of remember saying it, everybody said, \"What a clever guy he was,\" because I must have been, like, ... five, five-and-a-half. ... They said, \"The war's over,\" and I said, \"What will they do with the news?\" because I couldn't conceive that there could be other news, other than the war, because, in my mind, that was pretty much all that was happening. ...\n\nSI: Yes. The war had taken over the media.\n\nSF: That, I remember doing. [laughter]\n\nSI: Pearl Harbor was obviously a big event for everyone, regardless of age. To stay with that subject, do you remember anything else, like, if you were afraid of what might happen?\n\nSF: ... We had these air raid drills, and my dad had this white helmet. He was an air raid warden, and it was kind of silly. I remember, he ran out on the streets, ... I guess with a flashlight and a fire extinguisher. [laughter] People had probably heard about what was going on in London at the time, and we were just the suburbs of Boston, and they would tell people, you know, \"Shut your curtains,\" and that was basically it. ... I think that's about all he'd do, but I remember because I thought it was great fun, because, when he was gone, I would put on this big, white helmet that he had. It was kind of like the old-fashion GI, World War I kind, not the kind that they actually used in the war, but, like, say, the Brits, you know, with the wide brim.\n\nSI: The pie plate style.\n\nSF: Because they were old surplus, I'm sure, helmets, and it was a white helmet with some kind of a symbol of Civil Defense on it and he did that for a while. ... He was the youngest of the five sons and he was too old in the beginning of the war, because, I guess, he would have been somewhere in his thirties and was married and had a kid, but ... I think the draft kind of crept up, because they needed more men. ... I think that there came a point in time when the way to stay out of service was that you had to go into a defense industry, and that's when he worked in the shipyard. Bethlehem Steel had a shipyard in Hingham, Massachusetts, where they built destroyers and, subsequently, LSTs (landing ship tank), which they needed a lot of when they were going to do the landings, destroyer escorts in the beginning for convoys. ... My dad, who was an accountant, really, and was the least handy guy around the house; [laughter] I always ended up fixing things, when I got to be older, you know. My mother used to say, \"Thank God for you,\" because my dad was very mechanically unskilled, but, somehow, he was an electrician's helper. Oh, I guess he was a pipe fitter, whatever that is, on the destroyer escorts, and then, they switched over, because they must have known the invasions were coming, to LSTs, and he became an electrician's helper on these LSTs. ... I remember, it was a long drive to Hingham, because ... we lived in Newton, I think, at the time, which is next to Brighton, and he got a special gas ration, so, he could drive and they used to carpool, guys who worked at the shipyard, and I think he was on what they called a swing shift, which started, like, about one or two o'clock in the afternoon, and then, he would work until, you know, eight hours passed, and then, come back late in the evening. ... You didn't make enough money at the shipyard, because, I remember, he had a part-time job doing what his regular thing was in the mornings. So, he had a ... pretty full day. I mean, he was pretty happy when the war ended and I think it was about that time, when he came back, then, he said, \"Well, ... I know enough about this business that I've been in,\" helping people and being their controller or internal accountant, that he started his own business in building wrecking and did that for about five or six years, until about '51, and then, the business really tanked. ... Then, we came down to New Jersey and ... moved to Fort Lee, New Jersey, and restarted. He had, initially, an accounting job in New York, but I think the reason we went to Fort Lee was, he got hired as controller of a business, ... a family business. ... Fort Lee was kind of, in those days, headquarters of organized crime. That was the residential bedroom for organized crime. We had Albert Anastasia and Joe Adonis and people like that, Joe Bananas [Giuseppe Bonanno]. They all lived in town, and there was a roadhouse, an old-fashioned, classic restaurant, high-end, that these guys used to populate ... and was owned by a family who my dad served as their internal accountant. The other interesting business, and that I got involved in, they also owned something called the Englewood Cliffs Milk Farm, which was a \"reducing farm,\" ... what they call a \"fat farm.\" All these overweight women would come for a week and they would go on a diet and they had pools and exercise classes and things like that. ... Somewhere along the high school time, I got hired as a pool boy at the Englewood Cliffs Milk Farm, [laughter] which was an interesting experience. I probably heard more cursing from overweight women than I ever would have, because, ... as a youngster, I kind of blended into the woodwork and ... they didn't think there was a man present. So, I heard some interesting stories, [laughter] a piece of growing up.\n\nSI: To go back, was the business that went under in 1951 the first business your father owned?\n\nSF: Yes. That was the only business he was owner of. It was called Eastern Building Wreckers Salvage Corporation. ... Labor was much cheaper in those days. ... You'd look at a building like we're in now, and, sometimes, if the university wanted to take it down, many times, there would be enough piping and bricks and they could actually take the building apart, piece-by-piece, reuse the lumber, reuse the bricks. They had a lot of immigrant labor that would clean the bricks. ... Pretty much, now, they just go in and demolish. That business has just become demolishing. So, there were some businesses, if the building offered enough opportunity, they would actually pay the university to take it down, ... or they'd charge the university a much lower cost, and it was a bidding process. ... In Boston, there were about seven or eight of these businesses that did that, and my dad started one and did pretty well in the beginning, and probably over-expanded it or whatever. ... Not being a businessman myself, I'm never quite sure why, but that was the business that he was in.\n\nSI: I was curious if it had something to do with the post war housing market and its fluctuations.\n\nSF: Not really, ... because I don't think it was driven by those factors. It was really driven by other factors. There was a lot of, again, pent-up, my supposition, you know, building momentum that was all put aside during the war, because nothing really happened that wasn't directed at the war effort then, but it wasn't directly related to that. He wasn't doing, you know, veterans' housing and those kinds of things. ... At least, I wasn't conscious of it.\n\nSI: Before we get too far away from your family history, can you tell me about your mother's family, where they came from?\n\nSF: ... They're probably roughly from the same areas of Eastern Europe. My grandfather was a little more literate and spoke better English. ... My grandfather, they were the Rubys, David Ruby, came over from Eastern Europe ... and settled in Montreal and was, again, some kind of peddler, but in soft goods, which was a classic business for Jewish immigrants. ... That business evolved into, actually, a manufacturing company of ladies coats and suits, small, called Ruby Manufacturing, and I remember visiting the cutting room, where they would lay out twenty or thirty layers of fabric, and then, someone would come along with ... what they called an electric scissors, on a pattern, and cut these things out. ... I don't think they actually did the sewing. I think they must have sub-contracted out the sewing, but I know they did the cutting, and, for a while, I always had these special outfits. Well, they didn't make children's clothes and he would cut clothes special for me. So, I had, was the only kid on the block with camelhair sport jackets and coats and things like that, that he would make special, because ... the cloth was much better, evidently, in Canada than it was in the United States. ... I guess there was a woman called Annie Godinski, my maternal grandmother, probably of a similar background, and they married and had, I've got to think, four children. My mother was the oldest, two aunts in the middle, and then, they had a younger brother, who actually did serve in the service. He was in the Royal Canadian Air Force and just passed away last year. ... I remember him visiting us in the United States, during the war, and he came down in his blue Canadian Air Force uniform and I was pretty proud, because I didn't really know anybody that was in the war, and I remember him pushing me in this kind of a stroller. ... He told me he tried to fly and flunked out of the school and I assumed he was always an accountant, something like that, but, when he passed away, they came up with some records that said, ... somehow, he was on a plane that got shot down over the Middle East somewhere. So, the Brits and the Canadians were fighting in El Alamein, in Egypt, yes, and I think, in those areas, there's something about his plane being shot down. We tried to get the records from the Canadian Air Force, just to see what it was, but that was my Uncle Arthur. He was quite successful. He was a major force in Canada. He ended up heading his own major accounting firm in Montreal, when he came back from service, and then, the firm got bought by one of these national accounting firms. You know, it was the \"Big 8\" age then, and then, eventually, when he retired, he went into building homes on land out in the suburbs of Montreal and was successful, and he was a great guy. I had a good relationship with him. I guess I was always closer to my mother's family than I was to my father's, because they kind of split up. The Boston people then kind of went in different directions as we grew up. Some of them went down to the Washington area, others into New York, and we just kind of lost touch, but the Canadians, I still keep in touch with. ... As I said, there were three daughters of ... the Ruby family, my mother, Lillian, my Aunt Ethel was the second, and my Aunt Dorothy was the third, and Dorothy's children, my cousins, I kept in touch with. ... Just by circumstance, it turned out that my kids ended up going to the same summer camp, their Canadians and my Americans. They all ended up in Vermont, at the same summer camp. So, we kind of renewed ... that relationship, I had always kept it up, but ... it became much closer. We would see each other every summer for camp visitations and the kids went to each other's bar and bat mitzvahs and my kids knew those cousins. So, it was long distance. My dad had met my mother; he went up from Boston. They met kind of halfway. There was a resort area called Old Orchard Beach, Maine, where Bostonians went and, evidently, Canadians came down, and they met on the beach and that was a long-distance romance. He driving, ... before the era of interstates, up to Canada and her taking the train, I guess, because she never drove, down to Boston, and there was a courtship there. ... They married in about 1937, I guess, because I was born in '39.\n\nSI: Was your mother the only one of her family to really leave Canada?\n\nSF: ... Of that generation, yes, yes. Interestingly enough, most of my cousins have left Canada, for greater opportunities. Arthur's two sons, who I visited recently, one ... just retired as a psychiatrist. He's at the, what's out in the Midwest? the Menninger Clinic, I guess, in Kansas or Iowa, wherever that is, ... and his other son is a lawyer, works for the State of Hawaii. So, they got out of Canada. My Aunt Dorothy's two children, one didn't have children, but my cousin, Elyse, married in Canada, but she had three sons and two of them are in the United States. ... One's an investment banker in New York ... and another one is down working for, I think, Wachovia in North Carolina. I guess the Canadians view the opportunities in the United States as being far better than they were in ... Canada, even now. They had, also, in Montreal, ... that problem with the French/English, you know, business going on. So, there was a time when English-speaking businesses and professionals just said, \"The opportunities were greater in New York; why fight it?\"\n\nSI: Were you the oldest child?\n\nSF: No. I was an only child.\n\nSI: Earlier, you mentioned that your grandfather, your father's father, was quite religious. Did that permeate throughout the family?\n\nSF: No. ... The best I can think is, it probably was a generation that tried to deny their heritage and assimilate. None of my ... four uncles and my father were religious at all. I don't think, growing up, until it came time to be mybar mitzvah time, about when I was twelve, did we start kind of re-affiliating with a temple, so that ... I could get a religious education, at least enough ... to be bar mitzvah-ed. That whole generation seemed to run away. They wanted to be Americanized. The Canadians were all the same. Very rarely did I ever hear Yiddish spoken, although my mother said she could speak Yiddish, because I know she spoke to my grandfather's second wife, who had a limited amount of English, and my mother used to be able to speak Yiddish to her, but they weren't particularly religious. My Aunt Dorothy ... had a childhood romance beginning in grammar school and her husband, my Uncle Milton, is still alive. He must be about in his nineties now. He became an attorney in Montreal, and then, went on to serve in Parliament, from one of the districts in Montreal. I think he became a major figure in Jewish philanthropies up there, heading a lot of those, but I'm not so sure how much of that was driven by real religious belief or political expediency or communal feeling, not so much religion. ... Jews have a great feeling of community. If you serve the community, you may not necessarily have to be sitting, you know, in a house of worship.\n\nSI: The idea of community.\n\nSF: Yes. It's my kids; ... my kids' generation seems to be going more back towards religion. ... I guess religion takes swings, you know. It's not quite \"born again,\" but they tend to be more aware of religion than, certainly, I was growing up.\n\nSI: More of a spiritual aspect.\n\nSF: Yes, yes. ... When my kids were of age, we sent them to religious school, ... I guess from the time they were about eight or nine. So, they were in the local temple and they went through, ... I had two daughters, so, they both went through the girls' ceremony, which is bat mitzvah, and one of them, the one who ended up here, was a 2000 graduate from Douglass, she, in fact, took a trip to Israel as part of that religious training one summer.\n\nSI: Birthright Israel?\n\nSF: Yes, kind of go back. It was typical. My other daughter decided to take a trip, ... one of these bus tours, through the Rocky Mountains, [laughter] but, you know, we let the kids make their own decision on what they wanted to do.\n\nSI: Was the family involved in anything on the political or cultural side of Judaism? Were they aware of Zionism? Were they involved in community activities, like the YMHA?\n\nSF: No, actually not. ... I kind of remember, my grandfather always had this can, which is for charities, ... one charity or another. This was a classic thing. I forget the name, there's a Yiddish word for it, but, anyways, in the house; ... called a pushka [a charity or tzedaka box], I think. ... There would always be coins and my dad would give me coins to put in, but it was over at my grandfather's house. It wasn't kept at my house. So, it was some kind of charity that they were doing. ... I don't think they were ever aware of any of their relatives that were still left during the war, so, that was not a concern, you know. ... They had all pretty much got out, in a broad sense, so, no one was aware of anybody that got caught in the Holocaust.\n\nSI: Though this was before your time, I would guess that, since your mother's family had these strong ties with Canada, they were probably pro-British and pro-intervention in the war.\n\nSF: Yes, we never talked about those kind of political things. My Uncle Milton, the one who was the lawyer and the politician in Canada, I guess he had served on the local city government, was a Montreal councilman before he was a member of Parliament, he was active in a lot of Zionist organizations. So, I remember that involvement, of, you know, supporting Israel when it was being founded, that coming from him, but ... that was the only thing, I think it was, in my family, who was doing that.\n\nSI: Did your parents ever tell you any stories about life during the Depression, if it was difficult, if it affected their careers?\n\nSF: Well, no. ... My dad probably was relatively privileged, because he went to college. I still have some graduation picture that we found from Bentley. ... I think he got a job right away, and I never heard of any kind of suffering from, you know, during that time. ... I remember that he was driving a Buick in 1938. So, I'm assuming, even though he was an employee at the time, that ... whatever he was doing in accounting, he did okay, and I don't believe, you know, the Canadians, because ... the Depression was kind of, you know ...\n\nSI: Worldwide?\n\nSF: Worldwide. I don't remember ever hearing of any particular suffering or any of those stories about the Depression. I mean, my poorness came from, [laughter] ... you know, I'll tell you, not being poor, but, you know, a little bit struggling, typical Rutgers kid, trying to figure out, you know, how you're going to pay for college and meals and those kind of things. ... I don't remember the real horror stories or the deprivation people talk about during the Depression.\n\nSI: No waiting in breadlines, that sort of thing.\n\nSF: No, no.\n\nSI: I would like to ask you about growing up in the Boston area, particularly during World War II. Do you recall how it affected your everyday life? Do you remember things like rationing?\n\nSF: I do remember rationing. In fact, I was somewhere recently and I saw that someone had ration coupons, which I remember. I remember these books of things coming out and I kind of helped my mother with them. You had books for everything, meat and dairy was one thing, and I remember collecting tin foil, you know, from chewing gum wrappers, used to ... be two parts. There was tin foil on one side and kind of a wax paper on the other, and you'd peel the tin foil off. ... The Boy Scouts or the Cub Scouts would run around and have tin foil, you know, scrap metal drives and things like that. Day-to-day, I was not in school. ... When the war ended, I was just five. ... As I said, I remember the blackouts and things, but ... it seemed to me, like, you know, I was eating my meals normally and playing on the street, and other than Dad running out a couple nights, and doing his thing in the defense plant, I really don't think it altered much of my life, or not to my recollection.\n\nSI: Do you remember waiting in long lines with your mother or hearing her complain about having to collect coupon points, something like that?\n\nSF: Yes, a little about that. There was another thing called tokens, which you see around, sometimes, in these flea markets, which were like coins, in lieu of stamps or as part of stamps, not quite sure how it worked, but they had tokens. ... Some things, you had to buy with tokens. ... Now that you mention it, I remember, my dad got this special sticker on his car, so that he could buy gas to go to the shipyard, like where you put our inspection stickers now, which ... gave that car permission to get so many gallons, or whatever it was, in any given month. I remember that a lot of toys were wood and paper. I kind of remember that. I remember them bringing home my toy machine guns and things like that to play with. They were all wood and we really didn't see metal, and plastic really wasn't big, and there was a lot of paper. I remember playing with paper toy soldiers, which were basically cutout kinds of things, and building little forts out of kits that were all cardboard things, because that kind of replaced, I guess, metal and things that were needed for the war.\n\nSI: Do you remember if the games that you either played by yourself or with others were influenced by the war?\n\nSF: Well, we played guns and hide-and-seek and, you know, that kind of thing. ... I remember, my dad kept bringing me home bigger and bigger toy machine guns, made out of this wood. I don't know where they made them, but it was kind of funny. They were all khaki colored, and I later learned that, like, ... it went from a thirty-caliber to a fifty-caliber, ... it's quite a step up, but, you know, I was the only kid, probably, with a fifty-caliber toy machine gun. [laughter] I don't know where he got those.\n\nSI: Can you tell me a little bit about the neighborhood that you grew up in? At that time, were you still in Chelsea or had you moved?\n\nSF: No, I never lived in Chelsea. I was born in Brookline. Oh, my folks had moved to Brookline. In fact, ... they lived about two or three blocks from the, if you've ever been in Brookline, the Kennedy birthplace, that section of Brookline, around Harvard Street and Coolidge Corner and Beacon Street, in that area, on a place called, get this for the record, my kids will read it, Naples Road, I believe, if you have to find it somewhere, ... in an apartment, and then, they went in a series of residences. They never owned a home in Boston, as long as we were there. We always had two-family homes where we lived. We rented in the two-family home, usually on the top floor, and they had five or six rooms, so, I always had my own room, and we usually had an extra room, which was the den or the toy room or something like that, and they were pretty middle-class places. Best as I could see now, because I did a \"roots\" tour with my wife a few years ago; we had a family wedding up there, not from my Boston side, interestingly enough, but my wife's family. One of ... her nephews settled in Boston after growing up here in New Jersey. So, we went up there for a wedding and I did a \"roots\" tour of all these houses, which were still standing, but a lot different. ... They appear to be, still, pretty much, now maybe a little lower middle-class neighborhoods than they were then, but one of the neighborhoods I lived in was kind of privileged. The grammar school I went to, which was called the John Ward School, and I just flipped around on the website, is in Newton and it was a semi-experimental grammar school. It was using what they called the progressive school methodology, which was a little more free-flowing than the normal, locked-in curriculum, and I think most of the people there tended to be children of professional and business owners. ... We weren't in the wealthier section of that neighborhood, but most of the people were in single-family homes ... and they owned their businesses or they were professionals, and it was a pretty good education. I was there through the fifth grade, when we moved to New Jersey. ... When I moved to New Jersey and entered the sixth grade in Fort Lee, I kind of took a step back, because, pretty much, I repeated everything that I'd done in Newton. So, evidently, they were like, basically, one year ahead in educational things than what I ran into when I went back to New Jersey.\n\nSI: You said it was progressive. Do you remember anything in particular about their methods?\n\nSF: I don't remember the methodology. I think they gave us a lot of freedom. I remember, we formed clubs and ... kids would make reports about the news. ... The Korean War was on then, in '51. ... We would do our own news show. Every morning, we would do public events, in about a half-hour. School would start, say, nine o'clock and the first half-hour of the day was, okay, we put on a public events program. ... Your assignment was to, you know, listen to the radio or watch the television, because TV was out then, or read the newspapers, and one of my classmates did what was happening in Korea. ... I always liked military things. I ended up doing the French-Indochina War, which was also in the news about the same time, and reporting on ... what developments were happening elsewhere, you know, in the world. \"General Marshall was doing this as Secretary of State,\" you know, ... things that were occurring.\n\nSI: Would you read this over the loudspeaker?\n\nSF: No, it was just in class. ... The school, I don't think then, ever had loudspeakers. I think they had bells. It was before that era. My daughter went through that in the modern era, when the high schools have loudspeakers. ... So, that was kind of fun, and they would give you a lot more freedom. ... The interesting thing, for some reason, ... we never learned handwriting, until later. They thought that if you printed for the early grades, you would have better recognition of reading the printed word. I think they thought that. ... So, my parents were always shocked by the fact that I was in the third grade and I still couldn't do handwriting, you know, and that came somewhat later. ... If you're an education major, maybe someone can understand what that is, but I'm not sure where the progressive theory came in, you know, except that it was obviously a school of thought that was introduced into various educational institutions as an attempt to see whether they can improve grammar school education, elementary education.\n\nSI: This was a public school.\n\nSF: Yes, it was a public school, yes, yes.\n\nSI: It is interesting that you were learning about international events so early on. Most people say that they had never even heard of Vietnam before it became a big news story in the mid-to-late 1960s.\n\nSF: Yes, yes. Did I say Vietnam? I meant Korea. ...\n\nSI: You said French Indochina.\n\nSF: Yes, yes, I was doing that. Yes, they were doing Korea. Yes, they were all interested in Korea at the time, yes.\n\nSI: Do you recall anything else about the Korean War, anything that stands out in your memory?\n\nSF: I got all charged up. I remember, I was ... telling my dad, ... I used to have toy soldiers, and I said, \"I went through the manual of arms,\" which I really didn't learn until I went in high school, but, you know, I would do this ... because I knew something about it. I had a book that showed different positions on how you hold a rifle. I remember drilling for my father, not that he ... cared that much. He would sit there, read the newspaper, but I always liked playing with soldiers and recreating military things. ... That was of interest to me, anyway, and I always liked history. I later developed a love of history, ... especially on the military side, but that, ... you know, was my first kind of awakening, ... in response to your question, of why these things interested me.\n\nSI: Could you talk a little more about that? Do you think it came from the games you played as a child? Were there movies that you were watching?\n\nSF: Hey, I don't remember being interested from the movies so much.\n\nSI: Just growing up during World War II.\n\nSF: Yes, maybe that was the influence. I'm not quite sure what it was, but you just kind of picked it up from kids playing. Playing soldier was more fun than playing cowboys and Indians, you know. ... There wasn't a lot, ... not a lot of media, that I remember being exposed to, because television, in those days, didn't show that much of war movies. I remember the series Victory At Sea, but I'm not quite sure where that fit in, in timing, but I think I was probably a teenager by that time.\n\nSI: I think it came out in the 1950s.\n\nSF: Yes, yes, I remember that being on television and watching that and being fascinated by that, but I don't remember, like, watching a lot of, you know ...\n\nSI: War movies.\n\nSF: War movies, Robert Mitchum and, you know, Allan Ladd and those guys, going around, doing their thing. I see them now, you know, kind of find them interesting now, when they replay them on television.\n\nSI: The Cold War was obviously a dominant theme in American life at that time. People were afraid of a nuclear war.\n\nSF: Yes. We did these silly drills. I remember going in the hallway. ... I guess it started in the John Ward School, because I was in grammar school, where we were doing stuff. You ... went out in the halls and you had, you know, \"duck-and-cover\" and things like that. I remember just going out in the halls, which was the shelter area. I don't remember ducking underneath desks so much. I know my wife tells me about that. ... It was big in New York, where she grew up, but everybody went in these inner hallways to be protected, and, you know, there was a fear of \"the bomb\" and Russia. ... I don't remember people in the neighborhood doing bomb shelters in their backyard, but that, I remember. ... You started to see, on office buildings or public buildings, these signs indicating where there were shelters and where there would be stored, you know, water and emergency food and that kind of thing going on, but, no, I don't have an overriding feeling of fear, you know. I don't remember the Russian threat. I wasn't looking over my shoulder at all, you know, looking for Commies or something like that.\n\nSI: It was not on your mind.\n\nSF: It wasn't on my mind too much. ... I remember getting interested in politics. I remember the first election that I watched. I remember sitting in front of the TV, keeping score, as Eisenhower was going through the, ... I guess it was the convention, which was fascinating to me. So, I remember sitting there with a little scorecard, like I used to sit through Red Sox games, and I was counting votes as the states were coming in, because I think Eisenhower had a big fight in 1952 for getting the nomination against Senator Bob Taft, and, somehow, I thought Eisenhower should win. I was an Eisenhower guy, maybe because he was a war hero or something like that. So, I was pulling for him, ... but I remember that, and then, ... subsequently, I remember some of the foolishness of the McCarthy hearings. ... I'd come home, I must have been coming home from school, and watch some of the McCarthy hearings on the television. I also remember watching the crime hearing, the Kefauver Committee hearings [Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce] about organized crime, and television was a very, probably still is, influential thing in my life, yes. [laughter]\n\nSI: Did your family have a TV early on?\n\nSF: I don't think so, ... because I remember going to other people's houses for the first TV shows. I remember, we had a Philco and I must have been in the; ... I'm trying to remember by the house I had. I guess we had that TV before we left Boston in '51, so, it must have been, probably, around '48 or '49 that we got our TV. Yes, I know I was fascinated by it. I remember, I would sit with a baseball bat in front of Red Sox games, but I would seeKukla, Fran and Ollie and Howdy Doody and things like that that were also of interest to me, but, then, I remember, there was always ... some things, ... a little bit later on, that caught my interest and they tended to be, you know, current event kind of things.\n\nSI: Growing up, would you mostly play with friends or did you have organized activities?\n\nSF: No, nobody had organized activities. [laughter] You know, I laugh at my kids; they're so organized. No, it was just ... that there were kids on the street. You would walk out and play, you know, when school was over, or the summer. We didn't go to camp. That was really for rich kids. I mean, I heard about camp, but I never knew what that was, and there was always kids on the street and they would be, you know, a couple of years younger or you're a couple years older. ... You know, in a four or five-year span, the kids would all get together and do things, or you'd have a best friend and you would go over and play with his toys, or one guy would have electric trains and, you know, you'd do the various things. ... I remember building forts in the back and, you know, just playing whatever the games were, but, basically, staying on your street. We knew; it was kind of an implicit thing. I never remember roaming. In Boston, I lived on, it was a street that was actually a U-shaped street. ... All my friends were on my side of the \"U,\" but it was pretty nice. It was called Undine, U-N-D-I-N-E, Road and it bordered, where the \"U\" emptied was, a street called Lake Street. Across the Lake Street was the Archbishop's home, it was Cardinal Richard James Cushing then, of Boston, his estate, which is still there. So, it was a pretty safe neighborhood. ... It was all this massive Catholic operation. There were seminaries and the Cardinal's residential area and just acres and acres of this. There was a stone wall that was behind us. So, that was on one side of the street and there was this residential section on the other, and, on my side of the \"U,\" ... maybe we had six kids, one of which was actually one of my classmates at the John Ward School. By that time, actually, we started living in Newton and I started at John Ward School. My folks then moved, not but a half a mile, but they were just on the other side of the town line, into Brighton, which would have meant I would have gone to the Boston public schools, ... which was a good distance from my home, but, plus, it didn't have as good a reputation. ... Since Newton was better, they actually paid to send me to the Newton district, you know. I guess, like, you know, it's a sending district. If you ... don't live there, you have to pay the tuition. They thought that was important enough. So, for about two years, I guess, they paid for the tuition, as well as the bus, it was not a public bus, it was a private bus line, to send me to the Ward School.\n\nSI: In this neighborhood, was there a mix of Catholic kids and Jewish kids?\n\nSF: I think so, yes.\n\nSI: There was not one dominating ethnic group.\n\nSF: I think most of my friends; ... you know, the street was probably about at least half Jewish, I would think, in that area. That part of Newton and Brookline. The Jews from Boston had had an immigration kind of a thing, ... as they moved west and out of the city, and ... Newton's a very big city in and of itself. It had about six smaller neighborhoods within it, which all had their own post office, and the Newton Center area, where we lived in, had a heavy proportion of Jews, I think, who'd done well; Brighton, maybe less so. When we moved back into the Brighton area, it was a less wealthy area, but, ... yes, it wasn't just one group. We didn't see any black kids. I mean, you know, I don't think I really was ever exposed to blacks until my freshman year at Rutgers. That includes growing up in Northern New Jersey. ... In that degree, it wasn't really a mixed neighborhood.\n\nSI: You mentioned that you pretty much hung around your neighborhood. Did you ever go into the more touristy areas of Boston?\n\nSF: Oh, my mother would take me down shopping. We would go to Jordan Marsh or Filene's, which were the downtown stores, and, you know, maybe my dad took me places. ... I would see Bunker Hill, because that was on the way to my grandfather's house, when you went to Chelsea. I remember him taking me to the Boston Museum of Science, which was a brand-new thing that had just opened up, and into the circus at Boston Gardens ...\n\n---------------------------------------END OF TAPE ONE, SIDE ONE-------------------------------------\n\nSI: We probably cut off the last part.\n\nSF: Okay.\n\nSI: You were saying.\n\nSF: No, I was saying we went to baseball games and there were two teams in Boston, the Braves and the Red Sox, then. The Braves subsequently moved to Milwaukee and, you know, then Atlanta, but there was Braves Field and Fenway Park. ... I think I remember going to both, and I remember the Red Sox always, as they still have the problem, getting beaten by the Yankees, when crunch time came, even though we had Ted Williams and Dom DiMaggio, and then, the Braves actually went to a World Series in 1948. I kind of remember that. Now, I guess I would have been about eight years old, and they played the Cleveland Indians and, I think, they lost. ... [Editor's Note: The Boston Braves lost the 1948 World Series in Game 6 to the Cleveland Indians.]\n\nSI: In the New York area, you were either a diehard Dodgers, Giants or Yankees fan. Was it that way with the Braves and the Red Sox?\n\nSF: I think so. I rooted for both, but I think I ended up, still, even today, being more of a Red Sox fan than a Braves fan, yes. Although I remember having a Braves jacket. That was one jacket for Ted Williams and another jacket for somebody we called Sam Jethro, who was a centerfielder, who stole bases like crazy for the Braves. ... I still remember, if you're a baseball fan, \"Spahn and Sain and Pray for Rain,\" because, in '48, the Braves only had two pitchers that were any good and the only way they could get through a series was to pitch the two pitchers. So, it was ... Warren Spahn, Johnny Sain and pray for rain, that would give them a day off, and then, they could start the rotation again. [laughter]\n\nSI: You were in the fifth grade when you moved to New Jersey.\n\nSF: Yes. We finished the fifth grade in Boston. Dad went down to get relocated and get a new business. We went up that summer to Canada, while he was in New Jersey, visited my Canadian relatives; came down in the fall to start school. He'd found a job, as I said, in Englewood Cliffs, with this roadhouse/fat farm operation, and found an apartment for us in Fort Lee, which was next to Englewood Cliffs, if you know Bergen County, right at the base of the George Washington Bridge. ... I started sixth grade in what was then called PS, or, I guess, School #1. They didn't have PS abbreviations, School #1, in Fort Lee, New Jersey. So, I did sixth grade there.\n\nSI: Was it a shock for you to go from Massachusetts to New Jersey?\n\nSF: Well, I was a little boy. I think the more significant shock is you're \"the new kid.\" It's always hard being the new kid who ... moves in. You know, kids can be kind of cruel. As I said, I think I was pretty well prepared, because a lot of the stuff was repeating what I had done in Massachusetts, and so, I emerged as, not only was I \"the new kid,\" but I was \"the smart kid,\" you know, so that, sometimes, that doesn't work in your favor, ... but I made new friends. In a sense, Fort Lee was a more interesting town, because it certainly was a more diverse town. Well, while it was white, it was ethnically very diverse. It had been, at the time we moved in, maybe half Italian.\n\nSI: Let me pause the tape.\n\n[TAPE PAUSED]\n\nSF: Yes, I was telling you about Fort Lee.\n\nSI: Yes.\n\nSF: Fort Lee, in the '50s, was an interesting place. ... In some sense, it was the bedroom for organized crime. Joe Adonis, Albert Anastasia, Joe Bananas, those people lived there. We never quite knew their children. A lot of them went to Catholic school, or a lot of them actually went under names which we didn't know. ... I remember watching the Kefauver hearing and they were focusing on things that happened around Fort Lee. ... There was an infamous nightclub called Bill Miller's Riviera, which overlooked the George Washington Bridge, which, evidently, had gambling and prostitution, well, everything that you might imagine. It was \"Vegas East\" going on there, and there ... was something called the; it was an abandoned baby carriage factory which was supposedly a place for gambling. I remember hearing about that. I mean, we passed the buildings or something. My dad kind of got to meet some of these people, you know, they would come in for food, [laughter] ... in working at the restaurant. ... The town was, ... about fifty percent of ... my classmates, I guess, were Italian, middle-class, professional, just everything. ... They had just started to build apartments in Fort Lee. The Linwood Park Apartments had gone up, which were the first ones, and they got an influx of New Yorkers, but, basically, Fort Lee, mostly, were older families. We lived in a garden apartment, which was also a new thing that was coming to Fort Lee at the time, but the older families had been there, quite a lot, most of my friends, had single-family homes. In fact, I think, at School #1, I was the only Jewish kid in the class, which was a shock, from earlier. ... Now that you asked me, in Newton, the John Ward School, I think, in some of my classes, ... it may have been, like, twenty Jews and one non-Jewish kid, or twenty-eight Jews and, you know, two or three non-Jews. The neighborhood was that heavily oriented. There wasn't a synagogue at all in Fort Lee when I came down and they were just starting one. They'd brought a rabbi in and they ... were meeting in the Episcopal church. I remember, because that's how I started taking the Hebrew lessons, as I was getting near bar mitzvah age. So, it was an interesting, you know, adaptation, to me, to other people. ... Some of the people I grew up with, and some of them, one of the other Vietnam vets, who I grew up with, who became a physician, is Lou Angioletti, whose family had been there for a long time, ... we became friends, you know. Once we got over, I guess, their shock, or just lack of acquaintance, it never really proved to be much of a barrier. I do remember getting beat up by Catholic kids from Catholic school. ... There was a Catholic school, up to about the eighth grade, and I think he, for some reason, just made some anti-Semitic remark. ... That's the only thing I kind of remember being a racial epithet, and he beat me up on a playground, or so and so. Wouldn't you know it? He went into the service at some point, became an MP [military police], and then, became a cop. So, it always tells me to be careful. I was always dubious about who ends up in the police department, [laughter] many times, and, later, when I worked in a prosecutor's office, I found out some of it is true. ... Anyways, I remember that fellow, but, generally, ... the integration, ... on that level, was not bad. ... As I said, Fort Lee never had blacks, which was interesting. If you went to Englewood, there was a major concentration of blacks. There were a few middle-class blacks in Teaneck, but, I mean, it was almost all white. ... We played sports in a high school league, I remember. I got involved in doing that. I was not athletic, but I got involved, in that I was the football team manager, and then, I kind of evolved as being a sports newspaper stringer, a sports reporter, for the local newspapers, the Bergen Record, up there, and the Hudson Dispatch, which was down in Union City. ... I traveled with the teams and I got my first taste of doing some writing, ... which was like my second love during that period in my life, and we would play in leagues where African-American athletes played. Englewood was in a different league. They were in the league that played against Hackensack, and there were blacks in those leagues, but, in the Bergen County Scholastic League (BCSL), we played Leonia and Dumont and Westwood and Park Ridge and those towns. I mean, everybody was shocked when Westwood got a, there was, like, a seven-foot, well, maybe he was only six-five, he seemed big, anyway, black center, came in, and no one ever knew what to do. You know, no one knew how to relate. It was kind of interesting, but, through my whole time to graduation in Fort Lee, there was never a black kid in that public school. Now, Fort Lee is, interestingly enough, a major, fifty percent, Asian town, I guess, or something like that, but towns evolve. ... Then, there was an influx, again, of Jews that came from New York when the apartments went up, and the Horizon House and all of those other things that occurred. ... My high school years weren't bad. I kind of got adopted, through a lot of avenues. As I said, I used the sports thing to get involved with ... kind of the athletic guys and I got off to a good footing, and I was pretty well entrenched academically, you know. I was always near the top of my class academically. So, I had both things going for me and I was accepted, you know, by most of the crowd. I was a little too smart for some kids, but that's, you know, something I've lived with throughout life, even in the practice of law. [laughter]\n\nSI: What were your interests in high school? When you came to Rutgers, you were interested in the sciences. You wanted to be an engineer.\n\nSF: I was interested, yes, but ... you have to remember the time. ... We'll get back to that, but the reason I was an engineer major was, one, we didn't have a lot of money and, two, the Sputnik thing had just happened, and that if you didn't have any money, the quickest way and a sure job, was to get into engineering and all the \"Space Race\" and all kind of stuff like that. So, that drove me there. I think, the reality was, I had a lot of love for doing history. I always liked history. ... It was in all my reports, I guess. I used to buy these history books. The National Park Service had all these battlefield things, as a small book. So, I remember all these reports and my teachers used to say, \"Well, gee, can we do one that isn't the Battle of Gettysburg or the Battle of, you know, Bunker Hill?\" or something like that, because, you know, those were my book reports that I would do, ... my history reports. Also, I was a fast reader. I used to read history and I remember going to the New York Public Library to get books. ... I forget how I did it, but I was able to get books, like, maybe through some school thing, like I had privileges. I remember going to Fifth Avenue to get history books, or ... maybe we just went for research, and got the Park Service pamphlets that were on file there, to do some of the research, when I found out about them, you know. As kids, we were pretty mobile. From Fort Lee, we would get on a bus, go across the George Washington Bridge, and then, take the subway, and hope we didn't get lost, but we could probably get down to 34th Street to go to Macy's, or ... knew how to get to Fifth Avenue, anyway. ...\n\nSandra Stewart Holyoak: Did you travel alone?\n\nSF: ... No, no, actually, I'd say, when I went to New York, a lot of times, I traveled alone. It was pretty safe then, you know. I guess I was; I don't know. At the time I was about fifteen, sixteen, I started traveling alone. It seemed reasonably safe. ... We didn't seem to worry about those kind of things. It was more difficult, in many instances, to get to Hackensack. ... It was before Bergen County had shopping centers, so, you used to have to take a bus, which wasn't that convenient. We lived in Fort Lee, so, ... I could just walk to the bridge, and then, I had access to, you know, a lot of different ways of transportation to New York. ...\n\nSH: Were your social activities centered in Fort Lee or in the city?\n\nSF: No, no. ... The city was for shopping and researching, and it was interesting to go, but anything social that I did, as a youngster, was, again, the street kind of culture that I described, being kids of a broader span of years, and we had a little bit of mix, because there were kids who went to other schools. I remember, one of the guys next-door went to St. Cecilia's, which was the Catholic school in Englewood. ... I lived about two blocks from the high school, ... which was a pretty good location, which was also about two blocks from the bridge. So, it was a location that was pretty handy. So, there were always people around and there was the kids from the garden apartment setting, three or four kids, about, in my age group, and a couple kids from down the street. So, that was my summers. It wasn't camp. It was finding things to do. I also got involved; I had some jobs. ... As I said, I used to like to sit in front of the TV and keep score of the Red Sox games, or whatever else. ... One day, I just took my little scorebook and I wandered down to, it was a Little League game. I didn't play Little League. ... Someone saw me doing this and the guy said, \"Well, do you know how to score? Can you score the games for us?\" ... I guess they were twelve, thirteen, or something, I was about the same age, and I said, \"Yes,\" and he said, \"Well, I'll pay you a dollar a game to do this,\" and so, I would go every night during the summer, when there wasn't school, and it was either Babe Ruth or Little League, and I would score. ... That was my job, and then, I would get the score, then, he told me, \"Well, you call this number and they'll put the scores in the Bergen Record.\" So, then, I got to know the people at the Record, from doing that, and then, ... as I said, I kind of got involved. ... In a couple of years, I was the football team manager, but, then, I started just being the scorekeeper. ... Then, I found out the newspapers paid five bucks for you to cover a game and the school would, you know, you could get a free ride up to a game on the team bus, because they were one of the things, so, I became the official scorer for all of the three sports. So, that kind of integrated me into the sports world, even though I wasn't an athlete. ... I had a couple summer jobs. ... I actually got a summer job in the Hudson Dispatch, which I think is now defunct. I think it was bought by the Jersey Journal, but it was interesting. ... I guess it was my junior or my sophomore year in high school. I couldn't drive, so, I used to take the \"Orange and Black\" bus from Fort Lee down to Union City, down Bergenline Avenue, and get off and the Hudson Dispatch was located in an interesting place. It was right next-door to the Hudson Theater. You wouldn't know this, but the Hudson Theater was the last burlesque show in New Jersey. ... The newspaper, this was a morning newspaper, and the reporters come in at six PM, but things happened during the day. During the summer, my job was to read the tickertape and get the horse races from around the country. So, I had to prepare those box scores and I would rip off the tickertape and paste it up, because they come up as each race, game, gets done. ... I would paste these things up in sequence, and then, when the reporters came in, they would have these things, you know, all lined up, everything that happened. ... Nobody was really around in the afternoon, except that they were rehearsing next-door at the burlesque theater. So, I would be doing this and you'd hear this big bass drum, and it was only a couple years later until I finally kind of, underage, sneaked in, at seventeen or eighteen, to find out what was going on next-door, at the burlesque theater, but it was a colorful beginning. ... Little, strange guys from Guys & Dolls would come, in the afternoon, guys like, \"What's new at Pimlico, kid?\" [Mr. Freedman imitates a creepy voice] you know, because they wouldn't have the race results. You can't get that stuff off the radio. So, we would have the wire service. These guys were, I guess, bookies or bettors or something like that. An interesting education, I remember.\n\nSI: Earlier, we talked about how you were very interested in military affairs, soldiering, that sort of thing. Did you find any activities that fostered that interest, like the Boy Scouts?\n\nSF: Well, strangely enough, we had a high school gym teacher, I guess, who believed that; a Mr. Spence. ... He ended up being director of athletics. He'd been there since the '20s, they told about, his stories, at Fort Lee, and he believed that everybody should be prepared to be drafted, because he had lived through the Korean War, you know, and these other things, and so, he always made us march. Part of our physical education curriculum was that you had to learn how to march and learn how to do right-face, left-face, and with broomsticks, literally. He had these sticks and we had to know the manual of arms, which I thought was fun, you know. I mean, other than that, ... and other than my love of history, that was about the only involvement I had with the military, at that stage. That kind of served me well when I entered ROTC here at Rutgers, because it was, you know, \"Oh, gee, this is familiar,\" because a lot of guys here didn't know anything. It was kind of a foreign thing, what do you do unless you were in a marching band, I suppose, you wouldn't know how to make those turns and do those other things, but that was the only thing, like, I kind of remember from that period of my years.\n\nSI: When did you realize that you were going to go on to college?\n\nSF: Oh, I don't think it was an option. I mean, my folks said, \"You're going to go to college.\" The real question was, \"Which college should I go to and how could I afford it?\" and, as I said, ... I either finished first or second in my high school class. I don't think my test scores were as high as that ranking may have been, but, anyway, I got a State University Scholarship to go to Rutgers. ... I thought I was going to be an engineer, because, again, at the time, you know, my dad wasn't making a lot of money and it was just a job as, basically an in-house accountant, bookkeeper, controller, whatever, and we had no savings and my mother didn't work. ... It was a question of how we are going to afford college, and I thought I was going to be an engineer, so, I applied to Stevens Institute of Technology and I applied to NYU, which had an engineering course then, I don't know if it still does, Rutgers, Lehigh, and I think that's about it. That's all I remember. Maybe I applied to Harvard and Yale, undergrad. No, I applied to Yale, maybe. ... I didn't want to go to Harvard for some reason. ... I applied to Princeton, also. Princeton actually had a strange engineering course. ... Unless I got a big scholarship, I couldn't afford to do any of those things and, when we looked at it, ... I think it cost, in those days, sixteen hundred dollars to go to Rutgers, would you believe? tuition, and so, the state paid for that. That was my State University Scholarship. So, then, we had to come up with just living expenses, which was about three hundred dollars a year, to live in the dorms and I don't know what, because I wasn't on the meal plan. ... I ate on cash, I remember, and I had a couple of jobs. ... I'd saved a little money, you know, from the scoring thing ... and that kind of helped, but that wasn't really going to make a real dent in anything. ... Somewhere along the line, I got involved in doing deliveries for a local pharmacy. The first one, I couldn't deliver and I worked just as a clerk, and then, when I could drive, I could actually make deliveries, because I was seventeen, I guess, in the twelfth grade. So, I got this job in the summers and on weekends, working in a pharmacy, and so, I got to Rutgers and they let me keep my job on Sundays. I would work back at the pharmacy in Fort Lee. ... I'd go out on ... Exit 9, the New Jersey Turnpike entrance here, and hitchhike home, because I didn't have the money to take the bus. So, you'd stand at Exit 9. The good thing about living in Fort Lee is, you say, \"George Washington Bridge,\" and there's always somebody, you know. I would stand ... right down here on Hamilton or Somerset Street, by the J&J [Johnson & Johnson] Building, and say, \"Exit 9,\" ... I had a sign, \"NJ Turnpike,\" and then, I had the other side say, \"GW Bridge,\" so, I would always get home. On Saturday morning, I would go down and I would hitchhike home and I would work eight hours a day on Sunday and Sunday night you could never get back to New Brunswick. Sometimes, my dad would drive me to the \"Orange and Black Bus\" at the Port Authority Station, or we'd hear about families going down to New Brunswick. There were kids, once I got to know other people, that would go down Sunday night and there were some kids that actually commuted from Fort Lee. So, if I couldn't get anything, I remember, there was a guy called George Carras who lived in Fort Lee, and he was maybe a senior, and he ... drove down Monday morning. So, I would call him and pay him a couple bucks gas money and he would take guys from Fort Lee back to Rutgers, who were living here, because the freshman and sophomore years, you know, we were living here. For some reason, my dad was able to afford to get me a car, not quite sure how he did the financing, but maybe that's not important. I had a Volkswagen Beetle in my; I'm trying to think. Certainly, I had it for my junior year. I don't know, maybe I got it the end of my sophomore year. So, that made life a lot easier. I was still going back, working, and a Beetle only cost about sixteen hundred bucks, you know, ... and gas was twenty-three cents a gallon. ... [laughter] Well, no, for a few bucks, you know, I could fill up, and the Beetle didn't take any gas, so, I could get back and, really, the gas bill was negligible. You know, I was putting gas in maybe once a week and I could get back and forth from Fort Lee and I was king of the hill down here, you know. I guess I had that my junior year. Maybe I had it in my junior year, but my sophomore year, I guess, I was still without a car, yes, because ... I rushed the fraternity. ... You're always thinking of ways to make money, I guess everybody tells the story, in Rutgers, in those days, so, I could join the fraternity and they told me I could work there. I joined Phi Epsilon Pi, which was on 4 Mine Street. It's now something else. ... It's that brick building with the four white pillars and, oh, about a door in from College Avenue, and, anyways, the deal was; ... I forget which one, I guess, I was a waiter the first year. One year, I was a waiter, one year, I was a dishwasher, so, that paid for my meals. So, that was the deal. You would do that stuff and that covered my meals and all I had to worry about was, then, you know, the dormitory charges, because they used to charge us living expenses. The University owned the fraternity house, so, we paid the same three hundred dollars for living there. I lived in the Quad, in Hegeman Hall, when I was a freshman, and then, I moved right in my sophomore year, over to the fraternity house. So, my meals were then paid for. So, that was a pretty good deal, and then, all I had to come up with was the three hundred bucks, because my education, ... tuition, was paid for, and I had to worry about books and some other stuff, which was one of the things that got me into ROTC, because that was like, \"Gee, why not?\" you know. ... Everybody had to take ROTC, remember, in the '60s and I was getting pretty good grades in that course. ... You know, I was a good student and I guess I was getting \"A's\" in ROTC. So, I said, \"Well, ... I'm in a subject which sounded interesting.\" It was map reading and some other things. I never liked the marching and that kind of stuff, but it paid, like, twenty-seven dollars a month, which covered a lot of school expenses. So, that was a pretty good deal. Now, ... the light at the end of the tunnel wasn't so bad, either, because ... you went in the Army Reserve; you did six months in the Reserves and you were an officer. ... Everybody said it was a pretty good kind of thing, and nobody paid too much attention to something that was happening, you know, in the Far East at the time. We knew it was out there, I guess. This is, like, '60. I was Class of '62. So, we're talking, probably, about, you know, we're making this decision, you know, in '59 and '60, and the U.S. is just sending a handful of advisors over. Nobody's really paying a lot of attention to what's going on. ... I did pretty well in ROTC, and then, towards the end, I guess, I was about the third-ranking cadet, not because I was the greatest rifle shot or marcher or anything else, [laughter] but they'd made me the operations officer, which is the guy that plans where they march and how they march. ... So, I used to do the map and I ended up being, like, the third-ranking cadet. I guess I was a cadet major at the end. ... Believe it or not, when I talk to the ROTC kids today, they were at one of the Henry Rutgers Scholar things, they came in when the general was here, ... I said, \"Yes, we had a brigade.\" They said, \"You had a brigade?\" [laughter] I said, \"Yes, ... there were a lot of people.\" I said, \"We used to do military reviews,\" that, \"it was part of the graduation. There was the Military Ball, and then, there was the big review the following Saturday, the following Saturday morning, and all the Air Force guys and all the Army guys marched, and there were, like, hundreds of people.\" I mean, there must have been; like, a company was about ... eighty to a hundred cadets, we probably had about eight or nine companies, and just on the Army side. So, you know, I ended up being a staff officer, planning these kind of things, and then, I ended up marching, not very well, in the final review, I remember, because one of my friends was the colonel, [laughter] but that was my involvement, you know. ... I used to do things to earn money. I would bring pharmaceutical products, ... legitimate things, back to, you know, ... sell, to make money. ... In the summer, you could make a dent, also. You could get jobs that would really make a dent. One year, I delivered laundry, had to lie about that, had to tell them that ... I had dropped out of school, you know. ... This was going to be my new career, I'm thinking, because they never would have hired me. ... So, I did that and that was pretty good money. One year, I was an armed guard at the Bendix Aviation plant in Teterboro. That one, I used my ROTC background. They said, \"Well, do you know about firearms?\" I said, \"Yes, I've got this training, ... know all about firearms.\" So, they said, \"Oh, that's good, okay.\"\n\nSH: Marksmanship.\n\nSF: Yes, so, they hired me, not that we had to worry about it, but, up in Teterboro, there was a Bendix Aviation plant and they were making parts for B-52s, even in those days. So, it was always some kind of a job, you know, that you could get and you could manage. ... You could make a dent or even cover most of your education expenses. In my senior year, I was a preceptor in what is; we called it Livingston, they now call it Campbell Hall. So, that covered my room and I moved out of the ...\n\nSI: The dorms.\n\nSF: The river dorms, yes. It was Frelinghuysen, Hardenburgh, and Livingston. When they made Livingston College, they changed the name of that third building, the furthest, what was it? Campbell. I was the preceptor. ... I don't know what they call them now, the RA's, I guess, ... yes, the same thing.\n\nSH: When did you change your major?\n\nSF: End of my first semester. It was a disaster. I was telling Shaun, when I came over to Rutgers, I started to be this engineer, and I had pretty good grades in everything, across the board, you know, ... as a high school kid. ... I sat through a five-credit calculus course, in which I had no idea what was happening, and I flunked that course entirely, five credits, you know, I think it was. We had the reverse system then. ... The numbers ran the other way, because the big deal was to get a \"1.0.\" So, I got a \"5,\" you know. In physics, which I told you the story about the physics, I got a \"4.\" So, I got a \"D\" in physics. In English, I got an \"A\" and, in chemistry, I got an \"A,\" and I think I had some mechanical drawing class or something. ... I never got surveying, because I was always interested. I wanted to take surveying, had mechanical drawing. I think I got some decent grade in that. So, it came and ... I remember walking to the Dean's office, because, again, everybody was poor, so, one of the great scams, or deals, was, at Christmastime, there were always jobs back home. You could work in the stores at the Christmas rush and the school had a policy that, ... with permission of the Dean of Men's office, ... Dean Cornelius B. Boocock was the Dean of Men, I'll never forget, you could go home. They would let you out of classes a week early, for the Christmas vacation, so that you could work the two weeks before Christmas to make money, and everybody did. ... So, I walked in and this gray-haired gentleman looked at my transcript at the time, this is the engineering grades, and he laughed me out of the office. I mean, it was like that I should have the gall, you know, \"With that academic record,\" he says, \"You're lucky to, you know, ... want to come back.\" So, he never let me go home. I got even with him at the end, but that's another story. ... So, I didn't get off. I only had one week to work and get that money. I went home and I continued to study engineering, you know, but I went to; ... I think it was in Geology Hall, or so and so, I had it. Professor Frank O'Connor was a freshmen English teacher. He was really a Shakespeare scholar, I believe, and I wrote well, because I'd been doing this newspaper thing, the sports reporting stuff. So, I liked him and I was getting an \"A\" in his class and we had some really thick kids. I mean, kids really ... came unprepared. There's no doubt, freshmen came, like they still do now, without the ability to read, write or think. I get some young lawyers like that, too, and I complain about that, but, anyways, Frank O'Connor and I had this discussion, I remember, right out here on the green. ... I said, \"Professor O'Connor, I'm really stuck. ... I've got to make some kind of a move here, because ... I can't stay in engineering.\" ... I said, \"I'm an engineer. I can't stay in engineering. I'm going to flunk out. They're going to take away my scholarship.\" I said, \"I've got to switch my major,\" and I said, \"I'm thinking about going into journalism, because I did this stuff for the local newspapers. I was a stringer. I have an interest in this. I write pretty well.\" He says, \"Yes, you do.\" I said, \"I'll switch to journalism.\" He said, \"Don't take journalism.\" I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"They're trades people.\" He said, \"They don't know any substance. They know how to put it down on paper, but, if you want to be a journalist,\" he said, \"you've got to get substance.\" I said, \"What does that mean?\" He said, \"Well, take history. Take English. Take a background. Take some liberal arts. Broaden yourself, do something.\" He said, \"Take political science.\" I said, \"Well, I have heard of that.\" I said, \"What's political science?\" I had no idea what that was. I knew what history was and I knew what English was. He said, \"Oh, they'll teach you about government and you'll learn something about foreign affairs,\" and so on. So, I said, \"That sounds interesting.\" So, I went, you know, to those little, old, blue-haired ladies that were sitting there, at what is now the museum, [the Zimmerli Art Museum], the blue-haired ladies, and I said, \"I want ... my course cards. I want to switch my major to political science,\" and I called my parents, after it was over. I said, \"I just switched my major to political science,\" and they went, \"What?\" [laughter] That is, \"What is political science?\" They said the same thing, \"What is political science?\" I said, \"Don't worry. The only way I could stay in school is to switch into this.\" Well, I got in political science, and there was some scrambling around, because I had to make up all these liberal arts courses. ... I remember taking, that summer, because I had no language, so, I had to take Italian. ... You couldn't take any language that you'd taken in high school, ... to begin. ... If you had it in high school, you had to place in the higher level, go to the second year or beyond. Now, I'd taken two years of French and two years of Spanish. It was a struggle in high school. I got by, but it was a struggle. So, I said, \"Oh, I'll take Italian, right? Because my town is speaking Italian, it's a Romance language, and it's got to be something, like, similar,\" and it was. So, I started. That summer, I took one semester of Italian and I think I took one semester of economics, to kind of catch up, because I had credit for English and I had credit, you know, for other courses. ... I had switched directly into, I guess, in that semester, ... liberal arts, but, then, that summer was catch up. So, I remember, it was tough, because it was tough finding a summer job. I had to fit my summer job around going down to New Brunswick, and we actually commuted down. There was some young lady from Tenafly who was also taking Italian, I found, and we carpooled down. My dad would take a bus to work a couple days a week, because Englewood Cliffs was nearby, and so, he lent me his car. We only had one car, and that was before I had a car. So, that was my switch, and then, I looked around. Once you start in political science, I found out half the guys were going to become lawyers. They said, \"Oh, we're going to law school,\" which wasn't that common. I knew my uncle was a lawyer, by that time, in Canada. So, I thought that was interesting, but I didn't really know a lot about being a lawyer, and most of my political science courses evolved into my Henry Rutgers Scholar Thesis, and I ended up in the, not in the government phase, but on the international relations side. I took \"Government of Foreign Nations,\" I remember taking \"Governments of Western Europe\" and \"Governments of Eastern Europe,\" and I got an advisor, Frank Taschow, who was, basically, I think, a Soviet expert, but, anyways, he also taught the Middle East, and that's what I ended up doing my Henry Rutgers in. Can we take a break?\n\nSH: Sure.\n\n[TAPE PAUSED]\n\nSI: You were just telling us about your Henry Rutgers Thesis. What was it on?\n\nSF: ... Very interesting. The thesis was on Iraq being the linchpin of the redevelopment and the pacification of the Middle East. The timing is ironic. I swear to God, I don't believe Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Rumsfeld have read my thesis. ... If you look down in the library, which, to my dismay, I now learned that those theses are now ... on microfiche, but I used to go and see if anybody read it, and nobody ever signed it out, [laughter] but, anyways, ... I had taken Taschow's Middle East course. ... I looked around and I came to the conclusion, after looking around at what was happening in the Middle East, ... and I think it was, if I remember correctly, ... just the beginning of the Baath Party in Iraq, but Iraq had the potential, because they were not dramatically religious, fanatic. They were more secular. They had this natural, historical valley of Mesopotamia, which would, could, serve as a fertile field to start, and that since the major problems at that time were the Arab-Israeli conflict, that if the world focused more on the redevelopment of the Middle East and ... spreading the wealth around, they could, incidentally, I believe, solve the Arab-Israeli conflict, because, ... one, there were places for the Arabs to go, but there was also economic well-being that could support them and do other kind of things. So, it was an interesting premise, based upon what we see today in the world, [laughter] but that was it; it was Iraq as being the cornerstone of a redevelopment plan for the Middle East.\n\nSH: Do you remember who your advisor was?\n\nSF: Yes, it was Frank Taschow.\n\nSH: He was.\n\nSF: Yes.\n\nSH: Did you have a second reader, like they do now?\n\nSF: I don't think so. I remember going before the three people, ... you know, the challenge round on my documentation. I think they were far less organized, because, I remember, I laughed, because a couple of years ago, when Carl Kirschner had started the Henry Rutgers Scholar Lectures, ... I guess we went to lunch. [Editor's Note: Mr. Freedman is referring to a series of initiatives started by Dean Kirschner to augment the thesis program and offer a series of lectures to a wider audience.] ... He said, \"What could we do?\" and I said, \"I don't have a lot,\" I still don't have a lot of money, \"but I'd like to participate and do those other kinds of things.\" ... I started giving my annual University donation to the specific Henry Rutgers project, because he told me they were sending kids on trips and whatever else. All I remember is, economically, my Henry Rutgers project, I couldn't type well, ... it cost me fifty bucks. I had to hire a typist, over here in Somerset, to get my thesis done, and it was like so much a page, and that was a major expense. You know, fifty bucks was a lot of money, and that I remember as being the major obstacles, you know, as well, and I was probably a little bit deficient in; I mean, senior year was a good time, you know. We get six credits for Henry Rutgers, both semesters, and maybe I took that physics course that I told you about. ... You know, by that time, I was mature and I was doing pretty well, maybe something else, and I had ROTC, and so, it wasn't tough, you know. Senior year was a lot of fun and I was a dorm preceptor, and I remember sitting on the balcony, overlooking the river, I think it was in the spring, and saying to one of my classmates, \"It ain't gonna be this good ever again.\" I mean, it was the most, probably, relaxed time of my life that I ever had, was my senior year at Rutgers, even with, you know, ... all those other kind of things, because it was just, really, a good year. I mean, I had my act together, you know. The only thing I wasn't sure of, at the end, was what I was going to do for a living, because the interesting wrinkle was, ... again, I applied to law school. I was in pretty good shape academically. I did very well on the LSATs and I was Phi Beta Kappa and I think I won the Theodore Frelinghuysen Vail Prize. So, I must have been about first or second in my class, ... although we shared the Vail, I think, for grades. ... The Vail Prize was for the best grades in your senior year; I don't know. There were a lot of \"1.0s.\" ... For two years in a row, I guess I'd got a \"1.0,\" which was the equivalent of a \"4.0,\" and pretty close to it in my sophomore year, after I made the change. So, I was in pretty good shape and I was getting recruited by a lot of law schools, but I still wasn't sure about it. The law schools put together the financial package, but money still was tight. The CIA and the NSA recruited on campus, so, as a fallback, I had taken their exams. Also, my advisor, Dr. Taschow, had convinced me. He said, \"Well, you might want to go to graduate school, if the law school thing doesn't come in, because you can maybe get a fellowship, you know.\" So, I took ... the graduate school tests in political science, and the achievement test and whatever the aptitude test is for graduate school, GRATS or whatever they called it, [the GRE]. Well, the CIA and the NSA came to campus to recruit, and they gave you; the first step was, you took a test, which was administered by the Educational Testing Service, the same people that do the Graduate Record thing. Well, I've got to tell you, there's a lot of overlap. So, I took this test and I must have done well, because, you never know what you get, and then, they started. ... They both called me back, said, \"Well, we're very interested. We want you to be a so-and-so,\" and I said, \"Well, until I know ... how I'm going to finance law school or graduate school or what's going on here;\" I took these interviews. The NSA was described to me as a place in Fort Meade where everybody went into this gigantic, windowless building, listened to radios and didn't come out until the end of the day, and it didn't really sound very good. So, I said, \"Thank you very much. You know, I don't think I'm interested in doing that,\" but the CIA sounded a little bit glamorous. They had this great reputation. The CIA was dominated by a lot of white \"WASPs,\" as the administration, and they said, \"We'll have your first interview in Nassau Hall in Princeton, in the Princeton Dean's office,\" because they were all graduates of Princeton. ... I remember going to Nassau Hall, driving down Route 27 and going to Princeton and showing up at the Dean's office, and I said, \"I want to see Mr. So-and-So,\" and they go, \"Oh, you're here to see Mr. So-and-So.\" There was a back room that they ushered you into and there was this very \"WASPy\" guy, with the glasses and, you know, ... the Ivy League haircut kind of thing. ... We had this interview and he said, \"What are you studying?\" I told him about my Henry Rutgers paper and he said, \"Interesting.\" ... The deal was, with the NSA and the CIA, if you had an ROTC commitment and you knew you had to go in service, you would serve two years with the CIA or NSA, as an employee, but that would count as your military obligation. You would actually get military pay and the military would assign you to those agencies, and then, when you'd finish your two years, you'd go on civilian status, but you'd already worked there. So, it was interesting. It was not a bad opportunity, I mean, one way to take care of your military obligation, and I was dating a girl I had met from Philadelphia whose brother was in the CIA. ... It sounded like an interesting thing and the guy said, \"Well, you're not going to;\" he looked at me and he said, \"We're not going to send you out in the field, you know, cloak and dagger, and kill people and that kind of stuff.\" He says, \"You're going to be an analyst.\" He said, \"I think, based on your background, we'd like you to do analysis. What do you study?\" and I said, \"I've got this paper on Iraq and the Middle East,\" and that was the only other time I really felt prejudice, because he said, \"We don't permit people of the Hebrew faith to work in our Middle Eastern desk.\" ... I was a little turned off by that, you know, because I thought he was telling me, you know, \"No Jews in that section,\" basically, was a nice way of putting it. Probably much to their dismay, they probably would have done a lot better at the CIA if they would have had Middle Eastern people, ... instead of a lot of WASPs that went to Princeton and, you know, never got out of prep school. ... I went on; I went down to Langley, Virginia. I took the lie detector test and I took the psychiatrist interview and I was all lined up ... to take the job, and then, my law school scholarships came through. When I put them all together, the best deal was to go to Columbia, because ... I got a scholarship that paid all my tuition to Columbia Law School. They picked thirteen kids each year, one kid from each geographic area in the United States. This was funded by a guy by the name of Larry Wien, who was a lawyer, who also owned the Empire State Building at the time, and that was his payback. ... They said, \"You've got a three-year scholarship, ... tuition paid,\" and I didn't know how to turn that one down. I got into Harvard and all, but they weren't giving me as much money, and I could live home, in Fort Lee, and cross the bridge to go to Columbia, and it was really, again, a money-driven kind of a thing, but, you know, that got me into law school. So, that was my adventure in my papers and what was I going to do. Meanwhile, ... I went to law school and I put the CIA stuff behind me and, when you go to law school, you get deferred from military service. So, that sounded like a good idea, I started law school. ... I remember, I guess it was my freshman year, or my second year, I mean, everybody remembers when Kennedy was shot, and, I remember, we were in some class, and then, everybody walked out on Broadway. Like, people just were shaken. Some professors got upset, but some people just walked away from their desk, or the lecture hall, walked out. ... Things kept getting more interesting, you know, in the world, as I was getting out of law school. Vietnam got to be a little more important. People were a little more aware of it in '62 through '65, is when I got out, but my move, one of my summers, I had worked at Bendix, I told you, I met a lot of policemen. ... My first summer, I went back, by the way, because, again, I was short on money, ... I didn't get a legal job, I went back to Bendix, my second year, and I was the armed guard again, [laughter] the ROTC veteran armed guard. ... My second year, though, I really felt I had to get a legal job. So, I got a job being a summer intern at the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, and then, I interfaced with a lot of police and prosecutors and it was a good experience, because I got around the courthouse and met a lot of judges. ... When I went back to law school, it put, kind of, that whole process in order for me and I hadn't paid much attention to the military. The Army kept writing to me and they said, \"As long as you stay in school and do whatever you wanted, you are deferred,\" and I got out of law school and I ...\n\n--------------------------------------END OF TAPE ONE, SIDE TWO-------------------------------------\n\nSI: This continues an interview with Stuart J. Freedman on June 13, 2006, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with Shaun Illingworth and ...\n\nSH: ... Sandra Stewart Holyoak.\n\nSI: Please, continue. You were telling us about your clerkship with the Appellate Division.\n\nSF: Yes. ... I live a charmed life. [laughter] We'll talk about that when it comes to Vietnam. Crazy things happened. ... I built up a good relationship, in the summer before, as a prosecutor's intern, with a great jurist called Morris Pashman, who was then with the Chancery Division, the Chancery judge in Bergen County, and he was later to be in the Appellate Division and, at some time, temporarily appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court, but considered, today, to be a great jurist, and a nice guy. He was a really interesting guy, Harvard graduate, and we just hit it off. I was the kid sitting in the back of the courtroom, interested. I introduced myself and told him I was going to Columbia Law School and he told me about what was happening, and he was doing non-criminal things, which I really was interested in. ... I wasn't that interested in the criminal thing, but that was the only job I had, and so, I watched and the good civil and commercial cases were in his court, because that's what Chancery does, ... even today, in our New Jersey court system. So, I was pretty much sure I wanted to clerk for him. ... We talked about that and he said he had an obligation to one of his classmates, to interview a son who was a Harvard graduate, but, once he went through the motions, ... he was pretty sure, you know, I could count on working for him. ... We had this relationship, ... but he said, \"But, I don't want to hold you back, in case something better comes along.\" So, I was interviewing with another Chancery judge in Passaic County. I went to an interview there, and I guess; no, maybe it was in Pashman's office. I was sitting, interviewing with another judge, and ... a call comes in to that judge. It was either Pashman or Kolofsky, I guess, who were the two Chancery Division judges, and the Chancery is; you know, New Jersey has three levels of courts. There's the Superior Court, the Appellate Division, and then, the Supreme Court, you know, and a call comes in and I remember the judge saying, \"Well, he's here now. Yes, he's a nice young man. Yes, I'm pretty impressed, yes,\" ... blah, blah, blah. I don't know who he's talking to. He said, \"This is for you.\" I said, \"Who's on the phone?\" He said, \"It's Judge Sidney Goldmann.\" ... He said, \"You know, Sidney Goldmann. He's Chief of the Appellate Division.\" I said, \"Oh, that Sidney Goldmann,\" you know, ... because I had not sent him a resume, and Judge Goldmann got on the phone and said, \"Stuart, I read your resume,\" and he said, ... \"I've been late in the process, because I've been ill, and ... you sent it into the central clearing agency.\" New Jersey's courts had a central clearing agency. You sent it to the administrator of courts and any judge who needed a clerk would go into that. ... You could also send it directly, but I had not sent my thing directly to Judge Goldmann. So, he said, \"Have you accepted anything?\" and I said, \"No.\" I said, \"I'm just still talking. In fact, Judge Pashman says he thinks he wants me. I'm pretty sure I'm going to take that.\" He said, \"Don't do anything until you come down to Trenton and see me.\" He talked like that, so, I said, \"Okay,\" you know, and I hung up. I said, \"When can you see me?\" I said, \"Well, it's,\" whenever it was, the time. ... He said, \"How about, you know, a couple of days from now? Come down in the afternoon,\" and I hung up and I looked at the judge who I was sitting with and he said, \"You know,\" he said, \"he's a great jurist.\" He said, \"I think I'm going to the Appellate Division, but he's been there and is head of it.\" ... He said, \"You won't find a better jurist in the system, so, if he's interested,\" he said, \"no hard feelings, go down and talk to him.\" So, I did, and it must have been Pashman ... who did it for me, because he would probably talk that way, and he was interested in my career. One of the things I'd done in the prosecutor's office was work on the case where we prosecuted Fanny Hill by John Cleland, which was an obscene, allegedly obscene, book at the time. ... I'd worked on the prosecution team, counting sexual references and doing charts and all kind of ... stuff, which, today, would be ridiculous, but, anyways, we prosecuted it, were trying to ban the sale of the book ... in New Jersey, and he [Sidney Goldmann] had done some opinion on pornographic books, called Bantam Books, and he was very interested in that and we talked about that. ... Basically, he pretty much, I think, pretty much offered me the job. ... He called me back the next day and offered me the job and it meant going south, because I was planning to live home and it would have been in Hackensack or Paterson or in those courts. He said, \"No, no, this is the thing,\" and ... it wasn't a bad paying job. It paid seven thousand dollars, seventy-two hundred bucks, which was pretty good. ... It was a little less than the starting salary if you went into private practice, but it was a prestigious kind of thing. So, I took that. Meanwhile, you could also get deferred from military service if you go into a clerkship. That was a recognized part of, like, graduate school, so, you got deferred. Well, this is 1965-'66. Well, you know, things are stirring around. The pot's stirring around. What's happened in the meanwhile is, that whole light at the end of the tunnel, ... the six-month Reserve time in the Army, is all off. The young officers are all going, you know, into service. Maybe half go to Germany, but the other half all go to Vietnam, and you figure, \"Well, the war's got to end. This is kind of silly. It's going to be over pretty soon, so, why don't I forestall it, you know?\" It's 1966, so, I'm twenty-six already. ... You know, I'm not that young. I do the clerkship and it was a wonderful clerkship and Judge Goldmann was a true Renaissance guy ... and just a wonderful man to work for. ... That's over, and then, I've got to face the reality, I guess. The war keeps building up and I get orders to report to service in September. I go down to Washington. ... They go through a little process, more of a charade than anything else, to say, ... \"What kind of job do you want in the military?\" and they said, \"Well, you're a law school graduate and you've clerked. We'd love to have you in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, but, if you do that,\" he said, \"that's a five-year commitment. We won't let just anybody in. You have an ROTC commitment for two years, but JAG is ... considered a premium job, so, if you go into JAG, it's a five-year commitment.\" I said, \"That's a long time,\" ... and they leveled, \"Not only that, but, if you're single,\" and which I was, \"what we're doing with our JAG officers is, ... we train them for a year, we send them to Vietnam for a year, they come home for a year, and then, we send them back to Vietnam after the year. So, you get to go to Vietnam twice, because we're not sending our married officers, JAG officers, we're only sending our single officers over, because, you know, that's the way it is.\" I said, \"That doesn't sound like a very good deal. Why don't I stay in the Signal Corps?\" I had been assigned to the Signal Corps, as a random thing. I said, \"What do you have for a Signal Corps job?\" and they said, \"Well, in your case, we have this wonderful job in procurement. You can do contracting for the Signal Corps, dealing with civilian contractors.\" I said, \"Oh, I used to work at Bendix. ... That sounds like an interesting thing,\" and he said, \"We've got a base in Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania, which is just on Route 80, on the other side of the Delaware Water Gap.\" I said, \"That's pretty good.\" ... \"Report in September to training.\" They said, \"You're going to Tobyhanna, but we're going to send you to these schools first. September, you had to ... report to Fort Gordon, Georgia, for basic Signal Officers' School. It's about an eight-week course.\" My exposure to the Army before then had been, I guess ... it was the ROTC summer camp. Normally, Rutgers guys go to places like Fort Dix, or Fort Devens in Massachusetts, or Camp Drum in New York.\n\nSH: Plattsburgh?\n\nSF: No, that was the Air Force, I think. For some reason, my year (1961), they sent Rutgers, and Seton Hall ... and NYU, they took some Northeastern schools and sent them to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which was the home of the 82nd Airborne. So, I'd done my six weeks summer in Fort Bragg and I'd kind of been exposed to the Army. That was my real exposure to the real Army, and you get treated almost like basic training, KP and everything. I mean, I, you know, cleaned up a mess hall and peeled potatoes and washed dishes. Of course, I was experienced at washing dishes from Phi Epsilon Pi Fraternity, [laughter] and so, you know, I knew how to do that, and dig a hole and do all those kind of things that basic soldiering is supposed to do, when these guys go through basic training, except that they call you a cadet and whatever else. My most noticeable thing about that was, I had a black commanding officer, a captain, who was our chief instructor. I forget, his first name was Andy. We used to call him \"Captain Andy,\" from that movie, the Showboat. [laughter] ... I remember, in Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina, it was still segregated and I remember that we did stuff, like, we would go into town; well, the white guys, anyways. ... Because of the cadet unit, they were from all different schools, mixed together, and so, there were kids from Virginia and VMI. There were also some Southern state schools, which were predominantly Negro schools. So, we had Negro officers, Negro cadets, in our unit, but they couldn't go into town, but I remember us going into town, places, in, like, a laundry. ... Captain Andy couldn't get his laundry done at the same laundromats that we could, but we actually took his laundry in separate bags ... and did it for him, because he would have had to have gone into the black neighborhoods and it was, like, inconvenient, you know. I mean, it was, like, a little bit strange. That was the old Army, you know, old, Southern, and the Army is, in those days, and probably is today, still, primarily, a Southern institution. You come out talking Southern in the Army, but, anyways, when I came back, and that was ... my experience in the South. ... Then, I go back down to the South, into Fort Gordon, Georgia, which is even further south than Fort Bragg. You drive right through Fayetteville to get to Fort Gordon. ... Man, I've got to tell you, the country is then, pretty much, ... on a war footing, because Fort Gordon was doing two things. They had a lot of pure recruits, draftee types that they were training there. They had the Signal Officers' School, but they also had some cadets for OCS, which is officer candidate school, which are usually people in the Army or draftees who want to be an officer, or they think can be an officer, and they really went through a much more strenuous course than we did and they were running all around the post all the time. I mean, my unit, it was the Signal Corps. By definition, it's not necessarily the most gung ho group of guys in the world and they're teaching you technical subjects, how to set up radio communications, primarily radio communications, and teletype and some other kinds of things, and so, I got instilled with that. ... Because I was the oldest, by that time, you've got to figure, which meant I had more time in grade than anyone else in the class, I was already a first lieutenant, ... without doing anything. You started as a second lieutenant, in 1962, I think you can only be four years in that grade, you got automatically promoted to first lieutenant, without doing anything. So, I was a first lieutenant. So, they said, \"You're in charge of the class. You're class leader,\" you know. So, I had to lead these guys, who couldn't march very well to begin with, and I certainly couldn't do very well, but that was the job I had at the Southeast Signal School in Fort Gordon. ... For some reason, ... there were a couple other people with graduate school educations, but they were a couple of other first lieutenants, like me. Nobody was a lawyer, a couple of business school graduates, but most of them were just college graduates"
