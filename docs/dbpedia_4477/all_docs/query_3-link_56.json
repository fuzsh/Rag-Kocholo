        "text": "In 1620, King James I sent Captain Nicholas Martiau to build forts in Virginia, specifically at York, and to complete the great log palisade between College and Queen Creeks. Interestingly, Martiau was the third great-grandfather of George Washington.\n\nYork's Fort\n\nYork's fort was initially built just a short distance down river from present-day Yorktown, and a small settlement developed there thanks to the guarantee of safety. This village also became a receiving port and mercantile center for the growing population. The site is now part of the United States Coast Guard Training Center.\n\nYork Town\n\nMartiau's early settlement and recruitment of settlers qualified him to receive several land grants, one of which is Yorktown’s present location. Sadly, Martiau did not live to see the town develop. He died in 1657, but his grandson sold fifty acres of the land for the establishment of \"York Town\" in 1691. The town's creation established it as the principal location for securing tobacco, goods, wares, and other merchandise. The port, wharves, and warehouses were situated at the riverfront.\n\nTobacco\n\nThe town continued to grow, and by the passage of the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1734, nearly all of Yorktown's eighty-five lots had been purchased. With high quality Virginia tobacco established as the main money crop and Yorktown named as a tobacco inspection port, the town's growth potential for the future seemed secure.\n\nVirginia's planters who lived in Yorktown or had second homes there indulged in expensive items from England. In 1764, an English visitor commented that he perceived \"a great air of opulence amongst the inhabitants...every considerable man keeps an equipage...very pretty garden spots...avenues...are prodigiously agreeable. The roads are infinitely superior to most in England...and the planters live in a manner equal to men of the best fortune.\"*\n\nUnfortunately, tobacco exhausted the soil, and modern fertilization practices had not yet evolved. As a result, the quality and quantity of tobacco declined dramatically from mid-century on, and Yorktown's heavy dependence on the tobacco-based commerce proved to be its temporary downfall.\n\nHistorical Significance\n\nYorktown's place in early American history was established by several Yorktown residents who devoted themselves to Virginia's and the new Nation's service. Principal among them was Thomas Nelson, Jr., signer of the Declaration of Independence. Additionally, David Jameson, a Scots merchant of Yorktown, served in the Virginia Senate and Privy Council and became acting governor in 1781. Cyrus Griffin, last president of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation, was another prominent Yorktown citizen.\n\nClearly, the most historically significant event for Yorktown is the victory of General George Washington's Army over the British Army on October 19, 1781. On that day, Lord Cornwallis surrendered, which effectively ended the American Revolution. The battles that began in 1776 covered much of the eastern seaboard. This final major battle was the culmination of numerous back-and-forth movements between the Franco-American and British forces.\n\nWhat caused Cornwallis to dig in for a siege in Yorktown? How was Washington able to move his massive troops so quickly to Yorktown? How did the French fleet know to move to its critical location at just the right moment?\n\nA visit to Yorktown's many historic sites will answer some of those questions and inspire even more along the way. It's the culmination of the stories of Washington, Cornwallis, Rochambeau, Hamilton, Lafayette, De Grasse, and the thousands of soldiers and sailors of the American, British, and French nations that make up the collective story of Yorktown.\n\nChanging Positions\n\nIn early 1781, Yorktown was still a bustling port and mercantile center, but its heyday had clearly passed as other larger more convenient ports became more prominent. The town still had homes, stores, warehouses, storage buildings, public buildings, and other structures packed tightly along its unpaved streets. Along the river, numerous wharves and associated buildings stood as a testament to Yorktown's importance.\n\nAfter October 19, 1781, Yorktown was in a considerably different position after suffering during the siege, with numerous buildings either destroyed or heavily damaged. Many of its occupants left the town, never to return, and several remaining damaged buildings were demolished with little thought of rebuilding. Thankfully, there were those who did stay and repair their homes and businesses. As a result, the story of Yorktown continued.\n\n*“Observations in Several Voyages and Travels in America in the Year 1736.” The William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Jan., 1907), pp. 1-17.\n\nIn 1814, a second disaster struck Yorktown when a major fire destroyed nearly all the buildings along the waterfront as well as many properties \"on the hill\" in the town – including the church and the courthouse. During this time, the waterfront area was occupied by the poorest of the residents of the community. Sadly, the citizens did little to rebuild the destroyed buildings. It took several years for the townspeople to repair the county Courthouse, and the church, renamed Grace Episcopal Church, took nearly 30 years to repair.\n\nFinally, the Civil War brought Yorktown's second siege in 1862. Again, its harbor was filled with gunboats, its streets with soldiers, and its reinforced eighty-year-old earthworks with armaments. Following this siege, Yorktown's future hopes disintegrated, and the final blow of 1863 occurred when a gun powder explosion destroyed the courthouse and Swan Tavern. The community was so devastated by the war that the courthouse was not rebuilt until 1875.\n\nThe 19th century ended with an iconic statue that remains a symbol of the historical impact of Yorktown. In October 1881, President Chester Arthur arrived to officiate the laying of the cornerstone for the Victory Monument. It took four years to complete and continues to be one of the most photographed and beloved structures in the area.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, Yorktown remained a backwater town with occasional weak efforts to revise its stature. In 1931, the Sesquicentennial prompted purchase of much of the property around town, which resulted in the creation of the Colonial National Historical Park.\n\nThe George P. Coleman Bridge, one of the few swing bridges in the nation, opened in 1952.\n\nIt spans the York River from Yorktown to Gloucester and connects the Peninsula with the Middle Peninsula. Another exciting year in Yorktown was 1976, with the nation’s 200th anniversary celebrations. To commemorate the milestone, the Fifes of Drums of York Town was created. The Corps is comprised of nearly forty children ranging in age from ten to eighteen, and its name is a nod to the original spelling of the town. In addition, the Yorktown Victory Center – now known as the American Revolution Museum at Yorktown – opened as one of three Bicentennial visitor centers in Virginia. Five years later, the town commemorated the Bicentennial of the Siege of Yorktown, which included a visit from foreign heads of state and President Ronald Reagan.\n\nSlowly, things began to turn around for the struggling hamlet as more people returned to the area in the mid- to late 1900s.\n\nIn 2006, Yorktown celebrated the 225th Anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown with four days of activities, and in 2012, the town featured numerous events to commemorate the Sesquicentennial of the Peninsula Campaign of the Civil War.\n\nIn 2005, York County constructed Riverwalk Landing at the waterfront. The shopping and dining venue features nine buildings with over 21,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, performance areas, a parking terrace, and piers. In May 2005, the grand opening celebration featured three days of festivities and visits from dignitaries such as Senator George Allen.\n\nFour statues portraying Revolutionary War heroes George Washington, the Marquis de Lafayette, Lieutenant General Rochambeau, and Admiral de Grasse stand near the center of the shopping and dining area. Designed by Virginia sculptor Cyd Player, the first two statues were placed in 2005, the third in 2017, with the last in 2021. That same year, the Virginia Tourism Corporation’s LOVE letters became a permanent site at the waterfront next to the Freight Shed. Since then, thousands of visitors from around the world have posed with the statues and letters.\n\nSince its construction, Riverwalk Landing has been the sight of numerous community events. In 2005, the blues and jazz concert series Rhythms on the Riverwalk was introduced. This was followed in 2006 by the Sounds of Summer concert series, which featured bands specializing in beach music, pop, R&B, rock, and more.\n\nIn 2006, Yorktown celebrated the 225th Anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown with four days of activities that included patriotic exercises, public concerts, fireworks shows, military interpretive programs, lectures, and Revolutionary War encampments. Crew members and volunteers on the Schooner Virginia and an 18th century replica of the sailing ship Godspeed offered deck tours and educational programs aboard the vessels that were docked at the Riverwalk Landing Piers. An especially poignant moment occurred when 2,000 interpreters recreated the 1781 march and surrender of British troops at the Yorktown Battlefield. Thousands of visitors and dignitaries from around the world participated in the days-long celebration to recognize this monumental milestone in American history.\n\nIn 2012, Yorktown featured numerous events to commemorate the Sesquicentennial of the Peninsula Campaign of the Civil War. That same year, the town also hosted the Yorktown Maritime Weekend and served as an affiliate port of OpSail 2012. This event commemorated the Bicentennial of the War of 1812 and the “Star-Spangled Banner.” To honor this anniversary, an array of tall ships and military vessels were on display for three days at Riverwalk Landing.\n\nThe Riverwalk Landing Piers continue to play a vital role in the tourism and economic growth of the area. Transient boaters from around the world use the piers to visit Yorktown. In addition, numerous tall ships, cruise ships, and military vessels have utilized the piers. Historic ships such as the HMS Bounty, Godspeed, Virginia, Kalmar Nyckel, and El Galeon have docked and welcomed visitors aboard. In 2015, nearly 25,000 people attended the three-day Bicentennial celebration of Lafayette’s voyage to America on the French frigate Hermione. The weekend included a film premiere of the one-act play “Lafayette,” deck tours, lectures, artillery demonstrations, and patriotic concerts.\n\nCurrently, the County is planning festivities for another major milestone – the 250th Anniversary of the United States in 2026. During this event, Yorktown will play an important role in Sail250® Virginia when an international fleet of tall ships and military ships sail to Norfolk, Hampton Roads, and Virginia’s Chesapeake Bay region. The Yorktown Tall Ships Festival, a Sail250® Virginia Affiliate Event, will take place in June 2026 when the town will be hosting several tall ships and military vessels at the Riverwalk Landing Piers.\n\nStrolling Yorktown's quaint streets today is a delight for all ages, but considerable imagination is required to recreate the appearance of the town at any particular period in its history. The early buildings remaining in the town help to recall the 18th-century period of prominence, and the additional 19th- and 20th-century buildings and changes expand the visitor's awareness of the continued existence of Yorktown in modern America.\n\nThe future is bright for a town that has suffered greatly since its creation. Despite the setbacks and struggles, Yorktown continues to press forward – much like the patriots who fought and won America’s independence more than two hundred years ago."
