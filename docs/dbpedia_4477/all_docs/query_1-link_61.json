INHOFE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 __________ LEGISLATIVE TEXT AND JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 7776 PUBLIC LAW 117-263 BOOK 2 OF 2 [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] JANUARY 2023 Printed for the use of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives __________ U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE 50-665 WASHINGTON : 2023 Note From the Director, Legislative Operations This committee print consists of the enrolled text and explanatory material for the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (H.R. 7776; Public Law 117-263). This Act and the material found in this committee print are the product of an agreement between the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Armed Services and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services on H.R. 7900, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 as passed by the House of Representatives on July 14, 2022, and Senate amendment 5499, as modified, to H.R. 7900 as proposed by Chairman Jack Reed on October 11, 2022. Senate amendment 5499, as modified, was in the form of an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 7900 and consisted of the text of S. 4543, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 as reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on July 18, 2022, as well as a number of amendments that were submitted for consideration during the Senate's consideration of its bill that were cleared by both sides. The Senate began consideration of Senate amendment 5499, as modified, on October 11, 2022, but did not complete consideration and therefore was unable to initiate a formal conference with the House. In order to ensure the enactment of an annual defense bill by the end of the calendar year, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Armed Services and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services agreed to reconcile the provisions of H.R. 7900 and Senate amendment 5499, as modified. The negotiated agreement was brought to the House Floor in the form of a House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776. On December 8, 2022, pursuant to the provisions of H. Res. 1512, the House agreed to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776 by the yeas and nays, 350-80 (Roll no. 516). On December 15, 2022, the Senate agreed to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776 by a vote of 83-11 (Record Vote Number: 396). The President signed the legislation on December 23, 2022, and it became Public Law 117-263. Because the agreed-upon language was brought to the House in the form of a House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776, there is no conference report and no formal ``joint explanatory statement of the conference committee'' for H.R. 7776. Instead, Chairman Adam Smith submitted a ``Joint Explanatory Statement to Accompany H.R. 7776, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023'' in the Congressional Record on December 8, 2022 (pages H9425-H9648). The text of the joint explanatory statement is included in this committee print. Section 5 of H.R. 7776 specifies that this explanatory material shall have the same effect with respect to the implementation of this legislation as if it were a joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference. In this committee print, the provisions of H.R. 7900, the House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, are generally referred to as ``the House bill.'' The provisions of Senate amendment 5499, as modified, to H.R. 7900 are generally referred to as ``the Senate amendment.'' The final form of the agreements reached during negotiations between the House and the Senate are referred to as ``the agreement.'' The following pages are organized in the manner of a traditional conference report.
