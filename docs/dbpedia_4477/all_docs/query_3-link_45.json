        "text": "The illustrious city of Washington represents the spirit of the United States with its streets and museums presided over by the Capitol. On a tour to Washington you can see, among others, the White House or the Pentagon.\n\nThe tour to Washington from New York is one of the best tours you can do from the Big Apple, and in fact, there are several types of tours to suit all budgets and trip lengths. Here are the ones that for me, are the best:\n\nThe best way to visit Washington from New York in one day and learn the history of each monument of the city with a professional guide, is with an organized tour. The Washington tour is a full day tour with round trip bus transportation and takes about 4 hours.\n\nDuring the city tour you will see the highlights of Washington, such as The White House, the U.S . Capitol, Arlington National Cemetery, The Pentagon and the Lincoln Memorial, among others. All entrance fees to monuments are included and you will have free time to explore at your leisure and eat where you choose.\n\nWhy I like this tour: in addition to its good value for money, I recommend this activity because it includes a very complete tour of Washington with which you will make the most of the tour.\n\nRecommended if... you want to visit Washington DC and see its main attractions but do not want to spend too much time or budget.\n\nIf you prefer to take advantage of the time and combine two tours in one, I recommend hiring the two-day tour to Washington with a visit to Philadelphia. In Washington you will discover all the essential attractions, such as the White House, the Capitol, the Pentagon and the Vietnam and Korea Veterans Memorials.\n\nOn tours to Philadelphia from New York you will also visit an important part of the history of the United States, going to see the Liberty Bell. You will also get to see the mythical Rocky Statue and its famous stairs and visit a traditional Amish Community.\n\nWhy I like this tour: this is a more complete tour and takes you to the main points of interest, not only in Washington, but also in Philadelphia. It's a great way to make the most of your trip and get to know the major cities on the East Coast.\n\nRecommended if... you're looking to get away for a couple of days during your trip to New York and don't want to worry about organization, transportation or accommodations.\n\nIf you have time to spare for a tour of the East Coast of the United States, this trip is for you. In four days, you can tour Washington, Philadelphia and Niagara Falls from New York, seeing the highlights of each place.\n\nIn Washington you will tour the city with a guide who will take you to the White House, the Capitol, Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon and the Lincoln Memorial, among other things. And on your way to Philadelphia, you will visit the Liberty Bell and the Rocky Statue, as well as a traditional Amish community to see how members of these colonies still live.\n\nFinally in Niagara, the wildest and most natural jewel of the East Coast, you will visit the National Park, the Watkins Glen State Park and the She-Qua-Ga Falls.\n\nRecommended if... you have extra days on your trip to New York, because this tour will offer you four days of contrast to what you will have seen in the Big Apple. The nature of the Falls, the history of Philadelphia and the stately spirit of Washington will seem like another world.\n\nWhy I like this tour: If you were to do this tour on your own, it would be impossible to fit it into such a short time, so this seems to me to be the most efficient way to squeeze the most out of your time.\n\nLet's compare the three options\n\nWhat to see in Washington\n\nSeeing Washington's major monuments is easy, as most of them are located inside the National Mall. As you might imagine, the main interest of these monuments is related to the political history of the United States and its presidents. Most Washington day trips and two-day tours follow an itinerary similar to this:\n\nNational Mall\n\nNational Mall (also known as the National Mall) is the expanse that contains the Capitol, the famous Obelisk, the Lincoln Memorial, the Smithsonian Institution building, and other points of interest.\n\nThe Capitol and the Library of Congress\n\nStart the day with a visit to the iconic Capitol, home of the U.S. Congress, and the Library of Congress, which is free to enter at your leisure and marvel at its spectacular interior.\n\nU.S. Marine Corps War Memorial\n\nYou'll know this memorial statue when you see it. It depicts U.S. soldiers raising the flag on Iwo Jima, and hopefully you'll see a military parade passing in front of it.\n\nLincoln Memorial\n\nLocated at the west end of the National Mall, the memorial dedicated to President Abraham Lincoln has been the site of numerous speeches of historical significance, including Martin Luther King's famous 1963 speech.\n\nKorean War Veterans Memorial\n\nTo the southeast of the Lincoln Memorial you will find a series of steel statues depicting a group of soldiers, arranged in a triangle shape in front of a wall of Korean War imagery.\n\nThe White House\n\nA must-see if you take a trip to Washington. Even if you don't take a tour of the interior, you can see the distinctive building from the outside fence (except on some occasions, such as official events).\n\nMartin Luther King Jr\n\nUnveiled in 2011, the monument consists of a granite statue of the leader of the Civil Rights Movement quarried from a rock behind him, where a series of inscriptions related to Martin Luther King Jr. are located.\n\nArlington National Cemetery\n\nThis military cemetery holds the remains of more than 14,000 veterans of wars as old as the American Civil War. Arlington National Cemetery is quite unique, with headstones rising above ground along a grove of trees.\n\nPlan your Washington tour from New York City\n\nFirst of all, keep in mind that the round trip will take you about seven hours. If you're reading this, you know that discovering new places is always worthwhile, and the truth is that Washington is an interesting enough city in general to justify the long trip from New York. Plus, with an organized tour you won't have to worry about how to get to Washington from New York.\n\nThat said, one day is enough to see the sights and buildings of interest in Washington, so some tours combine a visit to Washington with a tour of Philadelphia.\n\nBest day of the week to take a tour to Washington from New York City\n\nAs you might imagine, it is best to visit Washington during the week and avoid Saturdays and Sundays. Specifically, the best days to take this tour are Mondays and Wednesdays, and the sights tend to be less crowded after 2 p.m. Many of the museums and monuments close for the day. Many of the museums and monuments are closed on holidays, so try to avoid holidays to see everything.\n\nBest time of the year to tour Washington from New York City\n\nIf you happen to be visiting New York in the spring or fall, you will be lucky to be able to take a tour to Washington at the best time of the year. Winter in Washington is quite cold, and the problem with summer is that it usually rains at least once a week and is quite hot. Undoubtedly, the best time to visit Washington is spring, as you will have the opportunity to enjoy the city full of almond blossoms.\n\nWhere to eat on your trip to Washington from New York City\n\nBeware of restaurants in the more touristy areas! A meal for two can easily run up to $50. If you're on a tight budget, it's best to pack food in your backpack or look for cheaper dining options, as most tours to Washington from New York don't include food.\n\nSome of my recommendations:\n\nWhat should I take with me to Washington?\n\nAs a general rule, I advise you to wear comfortable clothes and footwear suitable for walking for a whole day, as even if you take public transportation you will have to walk a bit to visit each monument. Washington DC is an elegant city and its inhabitants reflect this: the style of dress tends to be more smart than casual. You won't find too many people wearing flip-flops, shorts or a T-shirt, so if you don't want to look like a tourist it's best to avoid this type of dress.\n\nCheck the weather before you travel\n\nBearing this in mind, it makes sense that if you visit the city in summer you should wear the coolest outfit possible as temperatures are quite high. As you know, it tends to rain, so it is a good idea to bring a raincoat or umbrella just in case. Winters are cold and temperatures rarely go above 0Âº, so be prepared for extreme temperatures.\n\nAlex's Traveler Tip\n\nIf you visit Washington during the hot season, Arlington Cemetery will be full of mosquitoes, so take repellent with you if you don't want to be massacred!\n\nLatest tips\n\nYou will love Washington if you are interested in American politics and history, if you enjoy walking through cities full of monuments, parks and imposing squares, and if you are interested in architecture and urban planning as Washington has a somewhat unique floor plan, if you find that this is not your style, since you are in New York, try some of the hundreds of tours of New York City that exist.\n\nWashington with kids\n\nAnd if you're visiting with kids, don't worry: it's very easy to get around the city using public transportation, which is also safe and of high quality. You won't have to walk too far and thanks to the abundance of parks and esplanades you can take a break from sightseeing when necessary.\n\nDon't forget\n\nSome tips we can give you before your trip is not to carry too much cash to avoid having it stolen or lost, but keep in mind that in some restaurants and local stores credit cards are not accepted (for example, in Pho 75, you can only pay in cash). For the same reason, avoid carrying valuable belongings and leave what is not essential at your hotel or apartment.\n\nRemember to carry your passport and be prepared to go through the occasional security check, especially at monuments and points of interest such as Arlington Cemetery. Washington DC takes security quite seriously, not least because of the city's political importance.\n\nLet's travel!"
