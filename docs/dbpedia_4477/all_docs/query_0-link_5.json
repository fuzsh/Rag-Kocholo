        "text": "Michael McCloskey was born and raised in Manhattan, and figured himself a lifer. “But everything changes once you have a kid,” he said. So early in the pandemic, Mr. McCloskey, now 48, his wife, Jillian McCloskey, 40, and their toddler left Washington Heights for the area where Ms. McCloskey was born and raised: the scenic Pascack Valley, in northern New Jersey.\n\nThey landed in Emerson, the southernmost of the valley’s eight communities and the one closest to the George Washington Bridge, 11 miles away. For $600,000 — a sum that would fetch “a great one-bedroom in the city,” Mr. McCloskey noted — the couple bought a four-bedroom, two-bath ranch house with a sun-filled playroom and a man-cave basement. The house is within walking distance of the train, which Mr. McCloskey, a sales director for a spirits company, sometimes takes to the city.\n\n“I was like, ‘Aren’t all towns family towns?’” said Ms. McCloskey, who grew up in nearby Washington Township and is a teacher in Hudson County. “But after being here two years, you get it. It’s the way the town caters to families, with parades, events at the library and little things like having someone else’s grandpa catch my daughter at the bottom of the slide at the playground we walk to.” (The McCloskey family grew by two when twins arrived in September.)\n\nDaniela Musano, 46, the owner of a spa business, and Chris Spliedt, 49, a children’s book author and illustrator, are on their second Emerson home. In 2020, the couple, who have three children ages 6 to 15, paid $480,000 for a five-bedroom, circa-1910 Craftsman-style house in need of work — an upgrade from a similar but smaller place around the corner.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
