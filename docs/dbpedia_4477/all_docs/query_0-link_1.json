        "text": "County in New York, United States\n\nNot to be confused with Rockland, New York.\n\nCounty in New York\n\nRockland County is the second-southernmost county on the west side of the Hudson River in the U.S. state of New York, after Richmond County. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the county's population is 338,329,[4] making it the state's third-most densely populated county outside New York City after Nassau and neighboring Westchester Counties. The county seat and largest hamlet is New City.[5] Rockland County is accessible via the New York State Thruway, which crosses the Hudson River to Westchester at the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Tappan Zee, ten exits up from the NYC border, as well as the Palisades Parkway five exits up from the George Washington Bridge. The county's name derives from \"rocky land\", as the area has been aptly described, largely due to the Hudson River Palisades. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.\n\nRockland County is the smallest county by area in New York outside New York City. It comprises five towns, eighteen incorporated villages, eighteen census-designated places, eight hamlets and 11 defunct communities. Rockland County is designated as a Preserve America Community, and nearly a third of the county's area is parkland. The county has the largest Jewish population percentage of any U.S. county, at 31.4%, or 90,000 residents.[6] Rockland also ranked 80th on the list of highest-income counties by median household income in the United States, with a median household income of $82,534 according to the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area that became Rockland County was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native Americans, including Munsees and Lenape. The Tappan tribe had a particularly noteworthy presence in the area, extending from present-day Nyack, south to Sparkill and Tappan, down the Hackensack River valley through present-day Bergen County, New Jersey, and also along the Palisades and Hudson River shore all the way to present-day Edgewater, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1609, Henry Hudson was the first major English explorer to arrive in the area. Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary \"Northwest Passage\", sailed on the Half Moon up the river that would one day bear his name, and sailing through present-day Haverstraw before exploring north in present-day Albany.\n\nIn the years before 1664 when the area was formally a Dutch colony called New Netherland, present-day Rockland did not have formal European settlements. However, individuals did explore the area and made transactions with Tappan tribe for land with the idea that it could have future use. For example, in 1640, Dutch Captain David Pietersz. de Vries purchased from natives the area where the Sparkill Creek flows into the Hudson River.\n\nIn 1664, the British Crown assumed control of New Netherland from the Dutch. In June 1664, the Berkeley-Carteret land grant established the colony of New Jersey, dividing present-day Rockland and Bergen Counties into separate political areas. The northern border of New Jersey was placed in a straight line from the Delaware River at present-day Port Jervis to the Hudson River at 41 degrees even North latitude, where the Palisades Cliffs pause and give way to Sneden's Landing in Orangetown. The state line remains there to this day, though various disagreements along the exact border were had over the years.\n\nIn the 1670s, permanent Dutch settlers began to arrive with land grants, starting with the Tappan area.[7] These settlers were eager to escape \"city life\", moving from Manhattan to Rockland. A number of unique, Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.\n\nIn 1683, when the Duke of York (who became King James II of England) established the first 12 counties of New York,[8] present-day Rockland County was part of Orange County, known then as \"Orange County South of the Mountains\". Orangetown was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize Nyack and Tappan, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.[7]\n\nThe natural barrier of the Ramapo Mountains and the size of the county made carrying out governmental activities difficult. At one point, two governments were active, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains, so Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county.[2] That same year, the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719, and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day Clarkstown, Ramapo, and Stony Point. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the British as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland had skirmishes at Haverstraw, Nyack, and Piermont, and significant military engagements at the Battle of Stony Point, where General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname. George Washington had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of Suffern. British Major John André met with American traitor Benedict Arnold near Stony Point to buy the plans for the fortifications at West Point. André was captured with the plans in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged, and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received Sir Guy Carleton at the DeWint House, where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later, Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel H.M.S Perseverance.[9] On this day, the king's navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. Many buildings in New York City were built with bricks made in Rockland. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Hudson Highlands on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman, though, donated land and large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914, more than an estimated one million people a year were coming to the park. After World War I, Rockland County became the most important sausage-making hub in New York.[10][11][12]\n\nIn 1911, Letchworth Village, an institution for the mentally disabled opened in Rockland County near Thiells. The institution gained national infamy in 1972, when an investigation by Geraldo Rivera revealed the patients there to having been housed in neglectful conditions. Letchworth closed in 1996.\n\nRockland remained semirural until the 1950s, when the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Tappan Zee Bridge, and other major arteries were built. In the decades that followed, the county became a maturely developed suburb of New York City. As people moved up from the five boroughs (particularly the Bronx in the early years) the population flourished from 89,276 in 1950 to 338,329 in 2020.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nRockland County lies just north of the New Jersey-New York border, west of Westchester County (across the Hudson River), and south of Orange County. Its east border is formed by the Tappan Zee portion of the Hudson River.[13] The county's terrain ranges from 1,283 ft (391 m) ASL on Rockhouse Mountain (northwest of Lake Welch)[14] to approaching sea level along the Hudson River. According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 199.34 sq mi (516.3 km2), of which 173.55 sq mi (449.5 km2) are land and 25.79 sqmi (66.80 km2) (13%) are covered by water.[15] It is the state's smallest county outside the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nAbout 30% of Rockland County is devoted to parkland, belonging to either the five towns, incorporated villages, the state, or the county. These parks provide walking and hiking trails, ballfields, dog runs, historic sites, ponds, streams, salt marshes, and equestrian trails. Some popular state parks include Bear Mountain State Park on the northernmost tip of the county, Harriman State Park, also along the county's northern boundary, and Nyack Beach State Park along the Hudson River, with trails connecting to Rockland Lake State Park. The county hosts numerous public and private golf courses, with the towns of Orangetown, Ramapo, Stony Point, and Haverstraw all operating public golf courses within their towns. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission operates two golf courses in Rockland Lake State Park. Notable private courses in the county include Paramount Country Club, Manhattan Woods Golf Course (designed by PGA great Gary Player), and Rockland Country Club (Sparkill).\n\nRamapo Torne in Harriman State Park, part of the Ramapo Mountains\n\nOverlooking Rockland County with NYC skyline in far background\n\nHaverstraw along the Hudson River\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nLakes\n\n[edit]\n\nBreakneck Pond\n\nCongers Lake\n\nCranberry Pond\n\nLake DeForest\n\nLake Sebago\n\nLake Tappan (part)\n\nLake Wanoksink\n\nPine Meadow Lake\n\nPotake Lake (part)\n\nRockland Lake\n\nSecond Reservoir\n\nLake Welch\n\nTappan Zee (along east border)\n\nThird Reservoir\n\nAntrim Lake\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18006,353—18107,75822.1%18208,83713.9%18309,3886.2%184011,97527.6%185016,96241.6%186022,49232.6%187025,21312.1%188027,6909.8%189035,16227.0%190038,2988.9%191046,87322.4%192045,548−2.8%193059,59930.8%194074,26124.6%195089,27620.2%1960136,80353.2%1970229,90368.1%1980259,53012.9%1990265,4752.3%2000286,7538.0%2010311,6878.7%2020338,3298.5%2022 (est.)339,0220.2%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census,[22] 338,329 people and 100,438 households were residing in the county.

The old bridge was replaced with a new span in 2017.[28][29]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county is served by several major highways, including Interstate 87/287 (the New York Thruway), opening from Suffern to Yonkers in 1955. The old Tappan Zee Bridge opened the same year, connecting Rockland and Westchester, allowing Rockland County's population to grow rapidly. The Palisades Interstate Parkway, a project of master planner Robert Moses, and built between 1947 and 1958, connects the county directly to the George Washington Bridge due south. The Garden State Parkway opened in 1955, connecting New Jersey to I-87/287.\n\nFor further information\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Transport of Rockland operates several local bus routes throughout the county, and the express bus Hudson Link routes to city centers and train stations in Tarrytown and White Plains in Westchester County. TOR provides connections to other neighborhood bus operations – Minitrans[32] and connections to private commuter lines, Rockland Coaches and Short Line providing service to North Jersey and New York City.\n\nRailroad\n\n[edit]\n\nNJ Transit/Metro-North Railroad operates the Port Jervis Line, which stops at the Suffern Railroad Station and Sloatsburg Station, and the Pascack Valley Line, whose stops include Pearl River, Nanuet, and Spring Valley. in their respective hamlets and village of the same name. Connections on this line are available at Secaucus for service to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan and service to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The southern terminus of both lines is Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey, where connections can be made to several NJ Transit bus lines, ferries, and PATH trains to New York City.\n\nUntil 1958, Rockland County's eastern side was served by the New York Central Railroad's passenger service on the West Shore Railroad from Weehawken, New Jersey, opposite midtown Manhattan up through Tappan, West Nyack, Congers, and Haverstraw, on to the West Hudson shore cities of Newburgh, Kingston, and Albany. The service ran to West Haverstraw, in the north of the until 1959.[33][34] The Erie Railroad ran train service on the Northern Branch through the southeastern corner of the county to Nyack up to 1966.[35]\n\nFerry\n\n[edit]\n\nNY Waterway operates a ferry service between Haverstraw and Ossining in Westchester County for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Commuters take the Transport of Rockland's Ferry Express route to the Haverstraw ferry terminal for service to Metro-North's Hudson Line service to Grand Central Terminal. Ferry service is typically suspended in the colder months when the Hudson River freezes over, and commuters must take shuttle buses across the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n\nAirports\n\n[edit]\n\nNearby airports include:\n\nNew York: John F.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the New York State Unified Court System, which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system, as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally, the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties, this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland, however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and 15 of the villages have Justice Courts, which mostly hear routine traffic ticket cases, especially from the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Interstate Parkway. They also handle drunk driving charges, lower-level criminal misdemeanor matters, and occasionally perform arraignment on felonies (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\nLaw enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 1, 2024, Deirdre Smith was sworn in as the first female officer to serve as chief of detectives for Rockland County.[43]\n\nNational politics\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican but in recent years has usually voted Democratic. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County was won only three times by Democrats in presidential elections– in Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory in 1964, Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide in 1936 (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and Woodrow Wilson's first campaign in 1912, when Republicans were fractured into two tickets. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since voted Republican just once, in 2004 for George W. Bush. Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County compared to in neighboring Westchester County, which has delivered dependable Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Rockland County, New York[44][45] Year Republican / Whig Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 73,186 48.56% 75,802 50.30% 1,714 1.14% 2016 60,911 45.09% 69,342 51.33% 4,834 3.58% 2012 57,428 46.07% 65,793 52.78% 1,424 1.14% 2008 61,752 46.71% 69,543 52.61% 898 0.68% 2004 65,130 49.63% 64,191 48.91% 1,910 1.46% 2000 48,441 39.51% 69,530 56.72% 4,619 3.77% 1996 40,395 35.99% 63,127 56.24% 8,719 7.77% 1992 49,608 40.72% 56,759 46.59% 15,464 12.69% 1988 63,825 56.83% 47,634 42.42% 842 0.75% 1984 70,020 60.88% 44,687 38.85% 311 0.27% 1980 59,068 56.26% 35,277 33.60% 10,648 10.14% 1976 52,087 51.30% 48,673 47.93% 780 0.77% 1972 64,753 64.29% 35,771 35.52% 196 0.19% 1968 40,880 49.07% 36,948 44.35% 5,479 6.58% 1964 26,187 36.15% 46,173 63.74% 82 0.11% 1960 33,107 54.81% 27,178 45.00% 113 0.19% 1956 34,049 71.04% 13,881 28.96% 0 0.00% 1952 27,657 64.39% 15,084 35.12% 212 0.49% 1948 20,661 57.83% 13,066 36.57% 2,001 5.60% 1944 19,471 59.00% 13,437 40.72% 91 0.28% 1940 20,040 56.77% 14,897 42.20% 362 1.03% 1936 15,583 48.56% 15,876 49.47% 631 1.97% 1932 13,963 49.90% 13,347 47.70% 672 2.40% 1928 15,732 60.34% 9,769 37.47% 571 2.19% 1924 11,915 60.92% 5,640 28.84% 2,004 10.25% 1920 11,169 66.10% 5,057 29.93% 671 3.97% 1916 5,041 52.19% 4,469 46.27% 149 1.54% 1912 2,221 24.55% 4,241 46.87% 2,586 28.58% 1908 4,857 52.64% 3,937 42.67% 433 4.69% 1904 4,283 48.99% 4,246 48.57% 213 2.44% 1900 4,187 50.16% 4,021 48.17% 139 1.67% 1896 4,336 56.95% 3,002 39.43% 276 3.62% 1892 2,909 41.01% 3,789 53.42% 395 5.57% 1888 3,013 41.83% 3,939 54.69% 251 3.48% 1884 2,593 40.26% 3,697 57.40% 151 2.34% 1880 2,688 43.96% 3,415 55.86% 11 0.18% 1860 1,410 37.31% 2,369 62.69% 0 0.00% 1856 668 21.34% 1,526 48.74% 937 29.93%\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New York Boulders (formerly the Rockland Boulders), a member of the Frontier League, was founded in 2011 by former Yankee catcher John Flaherty of Pearl River, Clarkstown resident Michael Aglialoro (president of Clarkstown Education Foundation) and Stephen Mulvey (former part-owner of the Brooklyn-Los Angeles Dodgers). The team, owned by Bottom 9 Baseball, play their home games at the 6,362-seat, 16-suite Clover Stadium.\n\nRockland Country Club is located in Sparkill, New York and features an 18-hole golf course.\n\nThe New York Raiders, an American semi-professional rugby league football team based in Congers, New York, currently play in the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) competition. Their home games are at Rockland Lake State Park; they partner with the Canberra Raiders of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL).\n\nThe Nyack Rocklands played minor league baseball in the North Atlantic League from 1946 to 1948. The Rocklands were an affiliate of the Philadelphia Athletics.[46]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Scorecard.org, which integrates data from different sources including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2002, Rockland County ranked among the worst 10% in the United States in terms of air releases.[55] Recent EPA statistics show that a total of 66 presently active Rockland County facilities are currently regulated.[56] In Scorecard's list of Top 10 polluters from 2002, the Lovett generating station in Tompkins Cove is the top polluter, releasing 1,523,339 pounds of toxic emissions.[57] Studies were released in 2000 and in 2004 by the Clean Air Task Force to study the impacts of power plant emissions in the United States. This data for Rockland County shows that a total of $2,150,800 was paid in compensation for numerous illnesses caused by power plant pollution, including asthma attacks, heart attacks and death.[58] The Lovett generating station was closed and dismantled prior to 2014. From 2015 to 2018, the Haverstraw Quarry owned and managed by CRH Tilcon and Oldcastle Materials was heavily fined for air and water pollution, including over-blasting, over-excavating, non-viable use of its NESCO unhealthy dust suppression systems and lethal dust & water runoffs into protected waterways. In the period from 2017 to 2020, Suez experienced instances of discolored water and odor complaints. During 2020, the Rockland County Health Dept. and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Conservationfound/investigated and informed Suez of untreated polluted water at Tilcon operated discharge points at a stream that flows into Lake DeForest. After discovery, Tilcon stopped pumping the waste.[59][60] Higher cancer rates in Rockland County as compared to Manhattan associate towards drinking water quality, aging drink water infrastructure/storm drain runoff concerns.[61][62][63]\n\nRecently, COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed to have reached Rockland County on March 6, 2020.[64] After the areas of Spring Valley and Monsey were identified as having the highest infection rates, County Executive Ed Day requested that state emergency management declare those areas a closed containment zone.[65] As of July 4, 2021, there are a total of 47,027 COVID-19 cases and 966 deaths.[66] At 14,450 cases per 100,000, Rockland had the greatest density of COVID-19 cases of any New York county. 47% of the population and 58% of the eligible population (aged 12 and over) have been vaccinated.[67] The Orthodox Jewish community, the largest in the country, have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the state; Monsey's is the lowest in the state, at 17.8%, as of June 15, 2021.[68]\n\nNews reports confirmed that the first known case of polio in the United States in a decade was discovered in Rockland County in July 2022.[69][70]\n\nSolar field\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Clarkstown created a first-of-its-kind in New York State 2.3-megawatt solar system consisting of about 4,300 panels on top of a closed, highly regulated, flat shadeless 13-acre section of the former garbage landfill in West Nyack. The unit is sized to generate 3 million kilowatt-hours annually – enough power to supply about 200 homes, that provides one-third of the electric needs of the Town of Clarkstown government. The Clarkstown solar field project is at the maximum size that is currently allowed by New York State. The installation was projected to save taxpayers as much as $4 million over 30 years by reducing the amount of the town's annual electric bill – which is about $2 million and produce 10 percent of all the electricity that O&R gets through solar power. The project was installed in summer 2014, coming online in October.[71][72][73]\n\nMunicipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul W. Adler, the chairperson of the Rockland County's Jewish Community Relations Council, said in a 1997 New York Times article that \"There are two reasons villages get formed in Rockland. One is to keep the Hasidim out and the other is to keep the Hasidim in.\"[74]\n\nAdministrative divisions of New York\n\nThere are five towns in Rockland County. The most populous is Ramapo at 148,919, while the least populous is Stony Point, at 14,655, according to the 2020 US Census.\n\nThere are eighteen incorporated villages in Rockland County after the April 2022, dissolution of the Village of South Nyack, twelve of which are located at least partially in the town of Ramapo, and none of which are in Stony Point.\n\nThere are eighteen Census-designated places and eight Hamlets within the five towns of Rockland County.\n\nTowns\n\n[edit]\n\nClarkstown (pop. 86,855)\n\nHaverstraw (pop. 39,087)\n\nOrangetown (pop. 48,655)\n\nRamapo (pop. 148,919)\n\nStony Point (pop. 14,655)\n\nClarkstown is divided into 4 wards[75] for the purposes of municipal representation\n\nVillages\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nHamlets\n\n[edit]\n\nDefunct communities\n\n[edit]\n\nPoints of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nEducational and cultural\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor John Andre Monument - Tappan, New York.
