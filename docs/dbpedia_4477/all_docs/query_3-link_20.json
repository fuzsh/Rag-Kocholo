Administered by the National Park Service, the National Mall contains and borders a number of Smithsonian museums, national monuments and statues, and cultural exhibits. Affectionately referred to as “the Mall,” the Mall receives approximately 24 million visitors each year is not a mall in the shopping mall sense. Rather, it is a beautiful expanse of grass and open space in the middle of an otherwise crowded and congested city. I was tickled to learn, earlier this year, that the National Park Service considers the White House to be the President’s Park. Along those lines, the Mall should be regarded as America’s Playground. Here are my top tips for visiting the Washington, DC monuments with kids.\n\nOne of the greatest things about the Mall is that it is always open. Sure, the museums and concessions have specific operating hours, but the grounds are accessible 24/7 for walking and many say the best way to view the monuments is at night. Recently, I had the good fortune to spend an afternoon touring the monuments with Catherine’s family, which included our collective five children, ranging in age from 3.5 to 10. Although the Mall is kid friendly, there are a few things every visitor with kids should know when planning a visit to the Mall.\n\nFive Tips for Visiting the National Mall With Kids\n\n#1: Best Time to Visit the Mall\n\nThe best time to visit the Mall is an early morning weekday during the spring or fall. If you’re lucky, temperatures will be seasonally appropriate (instead of oppressively humid or bitterly frigid) and you can avoid the heaviest of crowds, which tend to be on weekends and in the late mornings/afternoons. Personally, if I am visiting the Mall with kids, I prefer to be on the ground, touring the monuments in the early morning (before 9:30am) as crowds tend to be lighter. After walking the monuments, I easily visit a museum of two, as they typically open at 10am, before either heading home or grabbing a bite to eat for lunch.\n\nIf planning a spring visit to the Mall, be sure to check out the NPS’s Bloom Watch for updates on when “peak bloom” can be expected. Peak bloom is defined as the day when at least 70% of the Yoshino cherry blossoms are open and lucky for us, peak bloom happened to be the day before our planned trip to view the blossoms and the monuments.\n\nOn our recent visit, we had two available days in which we could visit the Mall and chose the day with the warmer weather. It proved to be right decision as the next day, our children were especially cranky during a short hour long outing outdoors.\n\n#2: How to Get to the Mall\n\nMany will recommend DC’s Metro system as the best way to get downtown and the nearest stations are just a few blocks from the Mall. Although children age 5 and under ride free, all other passengers must have their own SmarTrip card, which costs $2 to purchase and then must be loaded with adequate fare for the ride. Passengers can also purchase a SmarTrip card containing a one day unlimited Metrorail access for $14. On the day Catherine and I visited the Mall, we had six passengers in need of SmartTrip cards + adequate fare and two children under 5 traveling for free. Instead of doing the math and purchasing SmarTrip cards for all five fare paying passengers, we decided that the easiest option would be to simply drive downtown and park near the Mall.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan International Trade Center, located at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW was the perfect solution. Located just one block away from the Washington Monument, the Ronald Reagan Building’s parking garage is accessible via ramps off 13th and 14th Street. As it is a federally owned building, don’t be alarmed that a quick search of your vehicle is required prior to entry.\n\nParking rates are calculated hourly, but for the entire afternoon that we spent parked at the building, we paid $25. Depending on the size of your group, this could be a bargain compared to purchasing individual SmarTrip cards that may never be used again.\n\n#3: Where to Eat\n\nThere’s really no such thing as a quick visit to the Mall when traveling with young children. Although I have taken many a lunch time stroll along the Mall and around the Tidal Basin, every single trip with a child has required some kind of food stop. The Mall itself, however, contains very few concessions, so be sure to either eat ahead of time, pack a picnic, or plan your visit between meals. As I mentioned earlier, I prefer to visit the Mall in the morning. Not only does this avoid heavy crowds, but whether I am taking Metro or parking at the Ronald Reagan Building, I find that by the time I finish viewing the monuments (and the blossoms!), I can head towards the Smithsonian museums which are centrally located to restaurants and dining establishments.\n\nThere are a limited number of concessions available on the Mall and the offerings are slim: hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken tenders, and drinks. The concession stands typically feature long waits and no bathrooms (so yes, two separate stops are required). On our recent visit, we were fortunate to have three adults, so we divided and conquered. Catherine and I took the kids to the bathroom at the Lincoln Memorial while Catherine’s husband stood in line at the concession stand located just south of the Lincoln Memorial. I am happy to report that as of April 2018, the hot dogs were very, very good and that the grassy area surrounding the concession stand was a perfect place for the kids to run around.\n\n#4: What to Wear\n\nBe sure to dress for the season and definitely check the weather forecast to determine appropriate clothing. Regardless of season, adequate walking shoes are a must. One visit to the Mall can easily be a 3-5 mile walk and with a relatively newly potty trained preschooler, I found sprinting across the Mall for the nearest bathroom!\n\n#5: What Gear to Bring\n\nWhen visiting the Mall with young children, you’ll want to provide for some means of carrying or strolling them after they’re done walking. Our respective 3.5 year olds are no strangers to walking and rarely use strollers, but the Mall is a different animal and they both ended up in their strollers for a significant portion of the visit. It came as a huge surprise to both Catherine and myself that they would choose to ride in their strollers as it had quite some time since they’ve needed it. I originally brought the stroller for the sole purpose of strapping my son into the stroller as we made our way around the Tidal Basin. During cherry blossom season, crowds can be intense, and there is no railing along portion of the basin, so I had no trouble imagining him going overboard. I was thrilled to have the stroller as the alternative, carrying a 36 pound preschooler, is less than appealing. As an added bonus, both 3.5 year olds were fast asleep by the time we made it back to the garage.\n\nAlthough my son is potty trained, I still travel with abundant wipes and hand sanitizer, which came in handy as the kids loved playing in the grass and picking up sticks along our journey, but there was no hand washing available at our lunch spot. Bottom line: there are very few amenities on the Mall so be sure to pack what whatever essentials you might pack for a 3-4 hour long journey in a public park.\n\nWhy Visit the Mall?\n\nWith little by way of concessions, heavy crowds, and often intolerable weather, why would anyone want to visit the Mall? The Mall is truly a monument to America’s past and should be high on anyone’s list of places to visit. The Mall not only recognizes some of the greatest Americans who have ever lived, but the Mall also honors those who have given their lives in sacrifice.\n\nDuring our recent visit, our families managed to visit all the major monuments and nearly all the memorials on the Mall. The route we took was as follows.\n\nsource\n\nWe began at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Building, where we parked and made our way to the Washington Monument. This 555-foot, 5 inch obelisk was completed in 1885 and is the oldest of the monument we visited. There are elevators that take visitors to the top, but the Monument is constantly under renovation and is currently closed until Spring 2019.\n\nFrom the Washington Monument, we hopped across the street to the National World War II Memorial. The National World War II Memorial opened in 2004 and includes the Freedom Wall with 4,048 gold stars, each representing 100 Americans who died in the war. The unbelievable loss of life is captured with the message “Here we mark the price of freedom.”\n\nPro-Tip: Senator Bob Dole visits the World War II Memorial nearly every weekend, where he greets visitors. Over the years, he’s met hundreds of groups and thousands of people. In September 2015, we were fortunate to bring my husband’s grandfather, who served in World War II, to see the Memorial and meeting Bob Dole was one of the many highlights of his trip. If you’d like a chance to meet Bob Dole, be sure to make your way towards the Memorial’s Visitor Center, which is where Senator Dole is usually stationed.\n\nFrom the World War II Memorial, we walked the length of the reflecting pool towards the Lincoln Memorial. The reflecting pool is over a third of a mile in length and was holds over 6.5 million gallons of water. Overlooking the reflecting pool (and the Washington Monument) is the Lincoln Memorial, which was home to many defining moments in American history.\n\nThe Memorial, which appears on the back of the $5 bill and the penny, was designed like a Greek temple, and inside holds a large seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln, along with inscriptions of two of his most famous speeches, “The Gettysburg Address” and his “Second Inaugural Address.” The 36 columns represent each of the states in the Union at the time of the Memorial’s dedication in 1922. The Lincoln Memorial is best known as the location where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I have a Dream” speech after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Pro-tip: The Lincoln Memorial is a good place to visit the bathroom.\n\nFrom the Lincoln Memorial, we cut up north, briefly, to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The Memorial, which is commonly known as “The Wall” was completed in 1982, and the 144 panels of the Memorial Wall include the names of 58,272 Americans who were declared dead and missing in action during the Vietnam War. The Three Servicemen is a bronze statute on the side depicting the soldiers solemnly looking at the names of their fallen comrades.\n\nThe Vietnam Memorial was designed to be viewed in a specific manner. The bend that forms a corner at the center of the Wall features the year 1959 on the top left of one panel and 1975 on the bottom right of the other panel. Service members are listed in chronological and alphabetical order, with the first appearing just after 1959 and the last appearing just before 1975. For more information, visit Free Tours by Foot, which I consulted prior to our visit for assistance in locating our family member’s name on the Wall.\n\nOur next stop was the Korean War Veterans Memorial, which was dedicated in 1995 to honor the 5.8 million Americans who served in the U.S. armed forces during the Korean War. Nineteen stainless steel statues represent a platoon on patrol.\n\nFrom there, we made our way down to the Tidal Basin, where we were able to view the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. This Memorial was dedicated by President Obama in 2011, and our visit was only two days after the 50th anniversary of King’s assassination. The 28-foot granite boulder shows King looking toward the Jefferson Monument on the opposite shore of the Tidal Basin.\n\nIn an ideal world, we would have walked the circumference of the Tidal Basin, but alas, the two 3.5 year olds in our party were done by that point, and the crowds slowed us down substantially. So, we took the short cut along the north side of the Tidal Basin to view the cherry blossoms, which were simply glorious. In 1912, the mayor of Tokyo gifted 3,000 cherry trees to Washington, DC and that legacy provides DC with about two weeks of beautiful blooms each year. Along the way, we enjoyed the view of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. This neoclassical Monument was completed in 1943, and the bronze statute was added in 1947. We then cut across the Kutz Bridge, stopping briefly at the Floral Library, before heading north back to our vehicle.\n\nIf you are fortunate and have the time to walk the entire length of the Tidal Basin, you will benefit from fewer crowds on the southern portion of the basin. I also typically find that photographs taken from the south basin tend to have less glare/reflection than those taken from the north basin. And, of course, you’ll be able to visit the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial, which we did not get a chance to visit this time.\n\nIf time, weather, and temperament permits, a great activity is to rent paddle boats at the Tidal Basin Boathouse. My kids absolutely love doing this, but it is definitely something that requires all the stars to align – it’s rare that we have the time, good weather, and sufficient parking to make this experience happen.\n\nFinal Thoughts?\n\nWalking the National Mall is a wonderful experience that any visit to Washington, DC should include! Many visitors skip the Tidal Basin because it’s a long walk in DC’s temperamental weather, but it is truly something to be relished. In the summer, where the heat prohibits long walks without shade, consider planning a walk around the Mall during the early morning hours or at night. Years ago, when my husband and I were but wee college kids, we spent a few nights in Washington, DC where we enjoyed seeing the lit monuments and memorials in the dark of night and I can’t wait until our kids are old enough to experience the monuments at night!\n\nBe sure to check out our entire category of posts on things to do and places to visit in Washington, DC with kids, including White House Tour With Kids, Renwick Gallery With Kids, and more Smithsonian Museum visits than we can count!
