Among Hoffman supporters at the Republican convention, sentiment to oppose adoption of planks dealing with controversial legislative Issues developed .\n\nThe attitude of leaders, identified with the Governor, was that problems of the current Legislature should not be foisted upon candidates for future office-holding. In the Senate last night the measure to revise municipal budget procedure was reported for action. Senate President John C. Barbour, the sponsor, and a Hoffman supporter, said he would seek a vote next Monday night, the evening before the Republican convention would adopt its platform. Senator Charles E .\n\nLoizeaux and Assemblyman Thomas M. Muir, both of Union and allied with the Hoffman forces, failed, however, to obtain release from committee of their \"replacement\" tax measures, designed to reduce property taxation and ease the relief financing burden on municipalities.

SAYS BEAUTY SHOP BUSINESS NO PRIZE Ridgefield Park Woman Charges Misrepresentation In Transaction (Special to the Bergea Evening Record) Jersey City, May 26 Alleging that Clara Scully, former owner of the Rost Beauty Salon of Hackensack, misrepresented the condition of businesi in the beauty shop when she told it for $2,000 on May 16, last, Nancy Ross of Ridgefield Park, the purchaser, yes-terday filed a complaint in Chancery Court asking that the sale be rescinded .\n\nAccording to the complaint, the purchaser paid $1,400 cash and gave 24 promissory notes for $25 each payable monthly for the balance of $600, She also executed a chattel mortgage to the former owner to secure pay. ment of the notes. It is charged that the business was represented profitable and the merchandise in the place was valued at $1,000.

The Essex convention delegates said they would endorse a \"replacement\" tax plank, if incorporated in reduction of property levies. Senator Lester H. Clee of Essex failed to obtain release from the Senate Judiciary Committee of the House measure to continue Col. H .\n\nNorman Schwarzkopf as Superintendent of the State Police until a successor qualified Senator Frank Durand, supporter of the Governor, as chairman of the committee, refused to release the bill for a vote. Col. Schwarzkopf's term expires June 7 and there were indications the Governor, critic of State Police investigation of the Lindbergh kidnap-murder, would not reappoint him. The Senate approved a $250,000 appropriation for teachers' pensions, but the House recessed until next Monday night without acting on it. Failure of the Legislature to appropriate regular allotment this year caused a deficit In available teachers' pension funds .\n\n\"I am absolutely certain,\" Smathers said in an address for delivery before the convention, \"that the cause of Democracy this year will carry half the Southern Jersey counties and obtain an even break in the other half, and I have been commissioned by South Jersey Democrats to tell you that if you in North Jersey hold the line we will make the gains.\" The Atlantic Senator, who is the the committee because of his Chand-less alliance.

Albert V. D'Amato, former Borough Attorney, was elected chairman of the Democratic County committee and committeeman from the Fifth district. D'Amato failed to secure the nomination when his opponent, Abram L .\n\nDavidson, tied him with 54 votes, despite the fact that D'Amato was the conceded favorite. Other officers elected were John Sudol, president of the Polish-American Democratic Club, vice-chairman: James M. Pecorino, secretary, and Mrs. Margaret Pappas, treasurer.

CASES TO GRAND JURY IN COURT Hackensack Man Given Suspended Sentence By Judge Leyden CASE WITHDRAWN Carl Frasso of 1SS South Main Street, Hackensack, was free today under suspended sentence given him in Special Sessions Court, Hackensack, yesterday by Judge J. Wallace Leyden. Frasso, last week, pleaded guilty to an assault and battery charge made by Willie Guardiano of 31 Lafayette Street, Hackensack .\n\non April 8. Anthony De Stefano of South Hackensack received a suspended sentence on a charge of possessing lottery slips made by Patrolman Joseph Dailey of Hackensack police. DeSte-fano also pleaded guilty to the charge which was made, April 18. Oscar Lueders of 275 Maple Street, Englewood and Edwin M. Green of 253 West Palisade Avenue, Englewood, were referred to the Grand Jury on assault and battery charges each made against the other on May 4 .\n\nAlso ordered held for Grand Jury was Albert Christie of 125 Brinkerhoff Street, Ridgefield Park, accused of assaulting Lieutenant Fred Hager of Ridgefield Park police on May 22. William Deubel of 207 Hudson Street, Hackensack, was ordered held for the inquest on a complaint of possessing stolen goods. Sergeant Charles Hartman made the complaint, which alleged that Deubel had in his possession radiator caps stolen from a number of cars, on April 17. Davis Fred Deigen of 127 Franklin Avenue, Hasbrouck Heights, was or dered held for Grand Jury on an attempted atrocious assault complaint made by Bergen County Patrolman Louis P. Centner .\n\nDisposition of a disorderly conduct complaint made by Qentner at the same time was withheld in lieu of Grand Jury action. Gentner alleged that Deigen had, on May 3 at a Route 2, Rochelle Park, lunch wagon, threatened him with a soda water bottle. John Nledzlelskl, 60, of 35 Hayward Place, Wallington, pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted suicide and was given a suspended sentence by Judge Leyden. Niedzielski admitted having atempted to take his life with the use of illuminating gas on May 15. FACES CHECK CHARGE Milton Hubschman of 410 Cedar Lane, Teaneck, was referred to the Grand Jury on a charge of uttering a false check .\n\nHubschman is charged with having given a bad check for $25, drawn on the Bank of Bogota, to Sidney Palmer of 28 Washington Street, Paterson, on March 21. George Sudol of 332 Main Avenue, Wallington, entered a plea of guilty to a charge of possessing untaxed alcoholic beverages, when arraigned yesterday. The complaint was made by A. B. C .\n\nInvestigator Robert S. Hig-glnbotham on May 9. Frank RufT of 104 Orchard Street, Garfield, was ordered held for Grand Jury on an assault and battery complaint made by Mary Sayor, 106 Orchard Street, Garfield, April 24. Disorderly person charges made against Harry Castelonia of North Central Avenue, Ramsey, by his wife, Elizabeth, were allowed withdrawn. Mrs .\n\nCastelonia alleged that her husband had, on May 3, while drunk driven her from their home. John Murdock of 114 Pierre Ave nue Garfield and Pierce Watson of 183 Malcolm Avenue, Garfield, were free today after their respective wives had withdrawn assault and battery complaints. Tor (Continued from page 1) post, it is between Harper and Thomas Harper, of course, has strong support among Hackensack leaders, but Thomas Is more favored by leaders in the northern and southwestern por tions. Thomas candidacy has al ready been advanced by several of his close friends, and the Assemblyman himself was staying in Trenton for the convention today to watch his oppor. tunlty .\n\nThere can be very little dillydallying about the position because of the shortness of time in which the committee has to act. If Mrs. Conklin says \"yes\" it is all over. But if she says no, the Bergen leaders and Republican chiefs from Warren, Sussex, and Hunterdon, the other Counties in the district, will have to make up their minds in a hurry. Mrs .\n\nConklin's hesitancy arises largely from her reluctance to enter a rough and tumble political fight. which if it doe) not develop this year, Is almost Inevitable In the future. In addition, she had never tried her strength In the open field. Her candi daeies have always been for posl tions open only for women, and there she received solid support from the Bergen women. But whether she would fare as well in an open campaign is another question .\n\nUntil now, Mrs. Conklin has relied largely on her skillful leadership of the Bergen County Women's Republican Club to support her in any race in which she has entered, and she has been eminently successful. Running for congress, however, is a different matter, particularly in such a district as comprises the Seventh. There she must contend with a rural element in three counties who have an inborn antipathy toward women in high public office. If Thomas were to be selected as a candidate, he would have to resign his place on the Assembly ticket, which he led at the last primary .\n\nHe has been an Assemblyman for two years, and if he wins in the fall and if the House is Republican, he is in line for the Speakership. The County Committee would select a new Assembly candidate. Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional picture, no guesses have been hazarded on that score. Harper would be forced to resign as Civil Service Commissioner if he took the Congressional post. He was named two years ago to succeed Joseph A .\n\nBrohel and his term has three more years to run. He has been active in politics for many years, serving as Sheriff for three years, and running for State Senator against William Harvey J. Ely In 1931. CAMDEN MILLS PAY RAISES iBv Associated Pressi Camden. May 26 The Board of Education referred requests from tef.chcrs for pay increases and restoration of salary cuts to the Teachers' Committee .\n\nL. A. Read of the Ccm-den Teachers' Association and F. Gertrude Foster the American Federation of Teachers Local addressed the Board as teachers' representatives. 'S ANNUAL HABRICH (Continued from page 1) the purpose of holding examinations and Issuing licenses, the County Courthouse and the City Hall .\n\nThe Armory, he said, Is not suitable because there ir little parking space In the vicinity and because the furnishings of the building are not adapted to the department's requirements. It was Habrich's opinion that Hack- ehsack businessmen would be aroused over the Board's decision, if it should result in Hackensack being deprived of the potential shoppers who have been coming here each Saturday and would make every effort to have the examinations continued in the City. Since each applicant for an Initial driver's license must be accompanied by a licensed driver, the examinations last Saturday must have brought 1.300 persons to Hackensack. Habrlch pointed out that the total number was probably considerably greater, since between thirty and thirty-five department Inspectors come to Hackensack every Saturday and many of the license applicants bring their families. While Habrlch, who is ill at his home, was uncertain this morning what the possibility of Hackensack's losing the examination service is, he agreed it was possible that he, with representatives of the department, might go before the Board at a special meeting Monday night to point out to the trustees the possible results of their decision .\n\nThe Board's action resulted from what first appeared to be a harmless question by Vice-President C. H. Gil-man, who has made it a practice to watch school expenditures with a critical eye. Asking what fee the Motor Vehicle Department pays for the use of the school Saturdays, he was informed that the facilities were furnished without cost. This did not meet with the trustees approval, who immediately raised the question why the department should not be denied the use of the school .\n\nSuperintendent of Schools John A. Wilcox immediately backed Gilman's position on the basis of undesirable sanitary conditions in the toilets he claimed to have observed after their use by the hundreds using the building every Saturday. Wilcox said that he feared the danger of infection to children after adults from all sections and all walks of life had made use of the sanitary facilities. He pointed out that children exercise little care and that it Is incumbent on the schools to watch over their safety. Gilman mentioned also that \"the whole place Is cluttered up every Saturday and asked; \"Why don't they use the Armory? The State owns it.\" President Martnus Contant recalled that the question of permitting the use of the school for examinations was not new and that the Board had agreed to hold the matter In abeyance when Habrlch and Motor Vehicle Department men had appeared before the trustees when the last agitation arose .\n\nHe pointed out the possibility that Hackensack would lose the examinations if the school were closed and warned that merchants would lose the extra Saturday business. Oilman, who had started the ball rolling, vainly protested at this point that what he desired was an investigation to see how the difficulty could be solved, but Trustee Paul Poschtni felt the department should pay for the use of the school and Trustee Carl Llndemann said the Board should follow Wilcox's recommendation. When the question came to a vote, it was unanimously agreed to close the school to the department after June 30, the end of the present school year. BLACK LEGION (Continued from page 1) ments contained In Black Legion lit erature seized in Jackson were possession of a pistol, and willingness to use It on orders from superior officers. Warden Harry Jackson, of the State Prison of Southern Michigan, has suspended two guards, Ray Ernest, described by the prosecutor as an officer of the Legion, and Dice Hawley .\n\nIn Flint. Prosecutor Andrew J. Transue said Black Legion was strongly entrenched in Genesee County with 2.000 members, and declared he had information that it was \"organized for murder and He said a grand jury Investigation was under consideration. In Battle Creek, Police Chief Hugh Gordon said he had received a report that at least one man was threatened with violence because he refused to complete his Initiation Into the Black Legion. An attempted slaying at Lansing, on May 10, was under investigation by State Police .\n\nDenunciation of the Black Legion, whose literature described it as an organization for the defense of Protestantism, came from the Detroit Methodist Preachers Association. A resolution adopted yesterday said the Black Legion \"threatened the liberty and lives of our citizens in the name of Protestantism and and that \"we deny their right- to speak or act for anybody; we denounce them; they have no part or place In American The resolution referred to the members as \"hooded and called upon authorities to \"use legal means to suppress and extirpate this monstrous Rabbi Leo M. Franklin declared that \"every possible effort should be made to stamp it (the Black Legion) out as a menace to all for which Americanism and religion stand.\" \"For it to parade In the name of Protestanism is to degrade Christianity,\" he said. \"No man to whom religion, under whatsoever name, means anything but must despise this new form of paganism, and do all that he humanly can to wipe it out, root and branch. Spokesmen for the Black Legion de plored such acts as the slaying of Charles A .\n\nPoole at Detroit, for which 12 Black Legion members were arraigned yesterday on murder charges, A thirteenth, now ill, will be arraigned later. All 12 stood mute. Effinger said at Lima that \"the organization deplores anything of this nature; it stands wholly for law and order based on justice He said that \"the Black Legion has more than and that \"it will go right ahead promoting the best interests of America and American citizens, despite the unfortunate affair at In an Interview here, Lupp, a milk Inspector for the Detroit Department of Health, said the Black Legion's members were \"good people in all walks of life who were brought to their senses when Communism and other isms crept into the United States from foreign He parried all questions about reports that wavering members were subjected to violence, that candidates were pledged to give armed support to the Legion, and about whippings, by pleading the sacredness of the ritual. TWO HURT IN CRASH Truck Collides With Auto On Sylvan Boulevard, Englewood Two persons were slightly injured when a two-ton truck crashed into a pleasure car on Sylvan Boulevard, at Palisade Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, early last night. They were Charles Hermann of 205 Waldo Road, Englewood, a passenger In the automobile, who was given first aid for lacerations of the temple and bruises to his right arm and William Kuhn of Alpine Road, Closter, another passenger given first aid for shock .\n\nThe crash occurred as the vehicle in which Hermann and Kuhn were riding with Daniel H. Kuhn of Alpine Road, Closter, started to cross Sylvan Boulevard with a green light In its favor. The heavy truck, operated by Steven Habenschus of 64 Division Street, Elizabeth, came through a red light and struck the light car in the middle of the right side. Both cars were able to continue. Bergen County patrolmen Fred Bertram and Carl DeMarco, who investigated, administered first aid to Hermann and Kuhn .\n\nRENAMES LINDLEY Senate Fails To Act On Hoffman's Reappointment Of Judge (By Associated Press) Trenton May 26 District Court Judge W. Lindley Jeffers of Atlantic ity, was nominated by Governor Hoffman for another term last night, but the Senate, whose confirmation Is necessary, took no immediate action. The Senate did confirm T. Yorke Smith of Camden for another term on the South Jersey Port Commission and approved the elevation of Captain Charles Reynolds of Paterson to the rank of Major in the State Militia. It also confirmed the following as members of the Board of Visitors to the Agricultural College at New Brunswick: Charles Pitting, Hammonton; Edward W .\n\nJackson, Newark; John T. Grey, West Creek; Hugh C. Lendrim, Paterson: William 6. Tyler, Plainficld. and George W .\n\nBanghart, CLEARANCE Several hunting shacks were burned, but the region affected Is generally Uninhabited. Known as The Plains, It Is locally famous for its scrub pines. Although, good timber grows half a mile beyond Its limits, on The Plains nothing will grom more than head-high. A man standing on a slight rise of ground can see for miles over the tree tops. The area is worthless except for deer bunting .\n\nScientists for years have sought to explain the phenomenon, one theory being that the succession of forest fires which have swept the area have by their Intense heat reduced the fertility of the sou. The present Are started Saturday and, until yesterday morning, was believed under control. When it suddenly spurted forward, it advanced cm three main fronts. One attacked Mayetta, where fire men wet down more than 30 houses to save the village and finally stopped the fire. The Atlantic City-New York Highway was closed for more than an hour, To the north of that, another head Jumped the Manahawkln-Camden Highway and ate towards Tuckerton .\n\nBefore it, however, was a tract deprived of fodder by a fire two weeks ago. William Whittick, 17, of Camden, one of the IT accounted for last night, said: \"The wind suddenly changed. Most of us had never fought fires before and we did not know what to do. \"The boss told us to run. We Jumped on a truck and hauled one fellow on Just as we were leaving .\n\nHe would have been caught, too, If we hadn't pulled him aboard.\" A dozen settlements lie along the New York-Atlantic City road or are In the fire triangle, but none was believed in danger early today. The fire either had passed them, or was under control. Two other fires broke out last night between McKee City and Bargain- town, west of Atlantic City, and an other one started north of the seashore resort. Three hundred volunteers, including 100 C. C .\n\nC. boys from Port Republics, fought the fire north of Atlantic City, which affected a three-mile area and was working toward Absecon. Firemen from six communities Joined them. The other fires were extinguished after burning more than SO acres and destroying the outbuildings on one property.
