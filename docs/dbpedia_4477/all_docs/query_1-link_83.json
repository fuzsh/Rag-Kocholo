        "text": "OUR DUTCH ANCESTORS\n\nIN AMERICA\n\n______\n\nVAN WAGNERS\n\nAND\n\nVAN HOUTENS\n\nCOMPILED BY STEPHEN L. NEBEKER\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn late 2008, while preparing to go with my wife on a mission to Mozambique Africa, for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I turned to family history to fill some of my spare time, as Iâd often done in the past. However, this time I delved into my own genealogy rather than my wifeâs. You see, Iâd previously worked only on her lines because there were few others researching them and it was easy to find a starting point. On the other hand, much had been done and was still being done on my lines, so it was more difficult to find a place to begin.\n\nOne day, while examining my pedigree chart, I noticed my Van Wagner line had no information beyond my third great grandfather, Halmagh John Van Wagner. I was shocked! Iâd understood that line had been researched back to the immigrant ancestor, but if it had, I didnât have a record of it. I finally had a starting point on my own family tree.\n\nThe more I thought about it, however, the more I wanted to research Halmaghâs wifeâs line tooâMary Van Houtenâbecause it was also Dutch and the two families lived in the same New Jersey areas. They could easily be researched together.\n\nBefore this time, I knew very little about the early Dutch immigration to America, or the arrival of my own Dutch ancestors; however, as I learned more and more, I became fascinated with their stories and impressed by their hardy spirits. So, I take this opportunity to share with you some of the interesting things I learned about them.\n\n(NOTE:Â This summary does not go into extensive detail about all the descendants of those two families, as it would take hundreds of pages and I wanted to keep this work short. For those desiring such information, I refer you to five, among many, noteworthy sources:\n\n1.Â Â Van Wagenen & Van Wagoner of Bergen Country, New Jersey â CA 1660 (Compiled by Carl S. Van Wagenen, Saugerties NY 12477 â Cvanwagenen.com\n\n2.Van Wagenen - Van Wagoner genealogy of 1969 - Prepared by Loree Van Wagoner Orullian, Mariam Van Wagoner Maxfield, and Lilia Smith Seegmiller; signed by Frank Van Wagenen, President of the Organization.\n\n3.Â Â Roelof Cornelisse Van Houten family of NJ (users.crocker.com/~jcamp/rcvh.html)\n\n4.The Van Houten Family of Bergen NJ (Taken from the New York Genealogical andÂ Biographical Record)\n\n5.Preserved Papers of Judge Gerrebrandt Van Houten, Paterson NJ\n\nÂ\n\nSection 1\n\nTHE VAN WAGNER FAMILY\n\nOUR VAN WAGNER ORIGINS\n\nAccording to multiple sources, our immigrant ancestor was Garrett Garretson, born in Holland in 1630. From the Historical Sketch of the County of Passaic, 1877 we read â...he and his wife Anna Hermansse (or Hermanusse) were of the town Wageningen, Gelderland, Western Holland. It was noted for its successful factories, Latin school and public buildings. Its history dates back a thousand years and teems with interesting stories of sieges, battles, rapine and burnings. Before leaving this charming little town for the new world, however, Garrett and his wife took two neighbors to the city council, to testify of their good character. This testimony was taken down and attested to by a âsecret sealâ of the city and given to the intending emigrants on 17 Nov 1660 (see below), who brought it with them to this country the following month, in the ship âFaith.â They brought with them at least one child. Two other citizens from that place, one with a wife and two children, accompanied them. Upon landing at New Amsterdam on 23 Dec 1660, the couple moved to New Jersey and settled at Communipaw, in the town of Bergen.â\n\nIn the book, Van Wagenen - Van Wagoner Genealogy, 1969, by Loree Van Wagoner Orullian, Mariam Van Wagoner Maxfield, and Lilia Smith Seegmiller, we have another reference to the coupleâs departure: âWageningen is an ancient town in Gelderland, about ten miles from Arnheim. Situated on the banks of the Rhine, a picturesque country, fertile and thoroughly cultivated, it has been a center of trade and population, and hence a sight of many a fierce contest, since the ninth century. In 1240 it was fortified by Count Otto II van Gelder, who provided it with walls and stout gates. Nevertheless, in 1421 it was captured, plundered and burnt. After various vicissitudes it was in 1572 reunited with the states of Holland, and is to this day one of the most pleasant and quaintest towns in Holland. The growth of this town has necessitated the removal, for the most part, of the ancient fortifications.\n\nâIt was from this town that Gerrit Gerritsen and Annetje Hermansse, his wife, with one child, Gerrit, two years old, and armed with the above certificate, set sail in November 1660, in the ship Faith, Jan Bestevaer the captain, the fare for the three being 90 florins (about 36 dollars). They arrived at Communipaw New Jersey on 23 Dec 1660.\n\nâFor some reason, an older child, Catrintje, was omitted from the passenger list. She is quite important to us, as she married Adrian Post, whose daughter Claertje married Pieter Helmighe Van Houten and they were the 2nd great grandparents of Mary (Van Houten) Van Wagoner, who joined the Mormon Church along with her husband Halmagh John Van Wagoner.\n\nâGerrit Gerritse appears to have settled in Bergen immediately after his arrival. On 16 Oct 1662, Director General Petrus Stuyvesant in council appointed him one of three schepens (magistrates or aldermen with magisterial and judicial powers) for Bergen. In the same year Gerritse was one of the petitioners for the settlement of a clergyman at Bergen, and pledged himself to contribute six florins yearly toward his support.â\n\nGerrit and Annetje had four sons and four daughters and they all married into prominent families in that area, who also happened to be their neighbors. These families were large land owners and the aristocracy, if there were any such classification in Bergen County. The families were: Post, Marcelis, Steynmets, Van Vorst, Van Winkle, Diedricks, Straetmaker, and Van Houten.\n\nGERRITâS & ANNETJIâS CERTIFICATE OF CHARACTER\n\nAccording to the History of the Van Wagoner-Van Wagenen Family, by Frank A. Van Wagenen, the Certificate of Character granted Gerrit and his wife before they came to America read: âWe, burgomasters, schepens, and councilors of the city of Wageningen, declare by these presents, that there appeared before us Hendrick Ellisen and Jordiz Spiers, citizens of this city, at the request of Gerritt Gerritsen and Annetji Hermansse, his wife. They have testified and certified as they do by these presents, that they have good knowledge of the above named Gerrit Gerritsen and Annetjei Hermansse, his wife, as to their life and conversation, and that they have always been considered and esteemed as pious and honest people, and that no complaint of any evil or disorderly conduct has ever reached their ears; on the contrary, they have always led quiet pious and honest lives, as it becomes pious and honest persons. They especially testify that they govern their family well and bring up their children in the fear of God and in all modesty and respectability.\n\nâAs the above named persons have resolved to remove and proceed to New Netherland, in order to find greater convenience, they give this attestation, grounded on their knowledge of them, having known them intimately, and having been in continual intercourse with them for many years, living in the same neighborhood.\n\nâIn testimony of the truth, we the burgomasters of the city, have caused the private seal of the city to be hereto affixed.\n\nâDone at Wagening, 27 Nov. 1660, by the ordinance of the same. J. Aqueline.â\n\nDUTCH NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\nI offer a word here as to Dutch customs in naming children. From A Historical Sketch of the County of Passaic, I quote: âIn country districts it was common, until the close of the 17th century, to call children after their fatherâs first name. If a manâs Christian name were Gerrit, and he had a son named Jan, the latter would be called Jan Gerritsen, meaning Jan, Gerritâs son. If he had a daughter Anneke, she would be called Anneke Gerritse. Now. since Gerrit and Jan were very common first names, it wasnât long until Gerritsens and Jansens were innumerable, a fact that makes it exceedingly hard to trace Dutch genealogy of that era. Another custom, however, is a help to genealogists: the first son was usually named after his paternal grandfather. The second son was generally given his fatherâs name, but this rule was not so absolute. Similarly, the first daughter was usually called by her maternal grandmotherâs name. And, certain family names were perpetuated from one generation to the next and still are today. So, when families moved, it often became necessary to distinguish one Gerrit from another Gerrit, and the natural method seemed to be to add the name of the town from whence he came. Thus, the children of Gerrit Gerritsen were frequently spoken of as van Wageningenâor from the town of Wageningen. Hence, the common surname which has been corrupted into Van Wagonerâ.\n\nAnd, from History of Passaic NJ and its Environs, we read: âAnother interesting point about early Dutch names is that certain names were retained so often in a given family that one could guess the familyâs surname by hearing only the first name. For example, Adrian commonly preceded Post; Ralph that of Van Houten; Rynier that of Van Giesen; Gerrit that of Gerritsen; Walling generally stood for Van Winkle (the descendants of Walling Jacobs); and Edo or Iddo was normally in the Merselis family. In fact, most of the first Dutch settlers had no real family name at all. This created no hardship at all at first, but as the Jacobs, Johns, Gerrits, Adrians and Williams began to increase, surnames were adopted to help identify the particular person involved. Gerrit Gerritse meant simply Gerrit, son of Gerrit.â\n\nIn church records the surname of the same man was entered sometimes Gerritse and sometimes Van Wagenen, occasionally with and more often without a distinguishing middle initial. The old Dutch people were persistent in keeping certain names in a family; itâs not unusual to find three children, one after another, given the same baptismal name, the first and second having died.\n\nEARLY NEW JERSEY LIFE\n\nOne of the problems for the early settlers of our nation was getting along with the Indians. From History of the Development of Bergen NJ, we read: âThe Second Indian War in 1655 resulted in the destruction of every bouwerij (bowery) on the west of the North River. The inhabitants fled to the shelter of New Amsterdam and only the Aborigines were left in possession. As this was the second incident of this character in the history of New Netherlands, Peter Stuyvesant wisely ordered that no settlement should be allowed on the west side of the river except in concentrated villages, which could be easily protected and defended. This decree opened the way for a petition presented to the Council at New Amsterdam during the summer of 1660, requesting permission to found a village on the highlands about two miles from the North River. The petition was granted and between August and October of that year the village of Bergen NJ was founded. The lines of the village are still marked by the streets of Jersey City, which surround and pass through it. An open square was reserved with two streets running north and south and others running east and west, meeting in the center. The village was protected by a rectangular palisade, with a gate at the center of each side. Later a well was dug in the middle of the open square and a corner lot was reserved for a school. With the village, came also the church and the school; in fact, a condition made by each pioneer in accepting a grant of a village lot or outlying farm was that ministers of the Dutch Reformed faith should be provided and the education of the children secured. In 1661, the first municipality was created in the form of an inferior court whose decisions were subject to appeal in the general New Amsterdam court.â\n\nTo resume the history of our common ancestor, I quote again from History of Passaic NJ and its Environs, âGerrit took the oath of allegiance to King Charles II of England 26 Nov 1665, but after the recapture of New Netherlands by the Dutch, he was again made one of five Schepens of Bergen. On 12 May 1668, he bought from Gov. Philip Carteret about 100 acres of land at Bergen, including the site of the watch factory at Marion. He probably worked as a farm laborer until he earned money enough to become a land-owner. He was one of the original patentees of Acquackanonk in 1685, but never settled there. He always remained at Communipaw and sold his Acquackanonk interest in 1699.\n\nâGerrit and Annetje were members of The Reformed Protestant Dutch Church and were financial supporters of it. All their children were christened and married in it, and all of them were buried by the ministers of that church.\n\nâThey continued to reside in the Communipaw section of Bergen until their deaths. Annetje died on 7 Sep 1696, and Gerrit died on 6 Apr 1703. Gerrit thus lived a little over 42 years in the New World.â\n\nGERRIT AND THE ACQUACKANONK PATENT\n\nContinuing from that same source: âThe Van Wagoner farm, upon which the old Van Wagner house stood, was part of the Acquackanonk Patent, which embraced land bounded on the south by the Yanticaw River; on the west by the ridge of the mountain, and north and east by the Passaic River. The Indian deed for this patent bears the date 28 Mar 1679. Captahem, the Indian Sachem and Chief, states âIn the presence and by the consent of Memiseraen, Mindawas, and Ghonnajea, Indians and Sachems of said country, for and in consideration of a certain Pârsall of coates, blankets, kettles, powder and other goods,â conveyed the tract known by the name of Haquequenqnck unto Hans Diederick, Gerret Garretson (our ancestor), Walling Jacobs, Elias Macheilson, Cornelius Macheilson, Adrian Post, Urian Tomason, Cornelius Rowlofson (another ancestor), Symon Jacobs, John Hendrick Speare, Cornelius Lubbers and Abraham Bookey. A patent (deed), for any land at this time was never given until one had first been obtained from the Indians, who in every instance were paid their price. It is for this reason the first and succeeding settlers in Passaic area never had a dispute with the Indians, who were honorably, dealt with.\n\nâThese Patentees divided the Acquackanonk Patent into 28 farms, after setting aside a tract of 13 acres for a church and support of a minister. This tract was a triangle whose apex was near the present corner of Park Place and Prospect Street, the base of one line was the north corner of the present bridge at Gregory Avenue and the other near the foot of Park Place. Just how the division of the patent was accomplished is unknown. Whenever it is referred to in ancient documents, it is said to have been âby mutual exchange, casting of lots, or otherwise.â One method in existence at the time was to take 14 cards, upon each of which was written the name of one of the 14 men, who was given a number. These cards were thrown in a sugar bowl, tightly covered, and shaken up. Fourteen other cards, each bearing a number 1 to 14, were placed in another receptacle, well shaken and the cards thoroughly mixed. At the appointed time, these 14 men met and John Ver Kirk, surveyor and scrivener, would probably have drawn a card containing a name and number and then drawn one with a number only, and would then have placed these cards on the farm or lot, on a map bearing that number, that was spread before them. In this way, (it is thought) the original Van Wagoner farm was drawn about 1690.\n\nâThis farm was marked No. 1, in the first division of Acquackanonk. There were other divisions at this time, 1685 to 1690. One of the patentees, Walling Jacobse (or Van Winkle) drew the farm numbered one. He was born in Holland, came to this country as a youth and settled at the present Jersey City until 1685, when he came here, married and had children, who assumed the name of Van (from) Winkler (shop keeper). Walling built the smaller part of the present building about 1690 and intended making this his homestead, but did not. He instead settled on another farm he had acquired across the river. He then conveyed an undivided half of lot No. 1 to John Barkaloo, who conveyed it to Hessel Peterse, who conveyed it to Garret Van Wagoner.\n\nâIn 1702, Walling Jacobs conveyed the remaining half of the title to Hermanus Van Wagoner by whom it was devised to his son, Gerrit, who thereupon became the sole owner, and subsequently, by will dated 1769, devised the whole farm to his son, John, provided he married and had lawful issue. Should John fail to marry and have lawful issue, the entire estate to go to another son, Harmon. John disappeared mysteriously in 1776, unmarried and childless. He was never seen or heard from again. Harmon took possession of the farm, and by his will dated 1789, devised the same to his son, Ruliff (Ralph), upon whose death, intestate, the farm became the property of his son, Harmonis (Harmon), whose son John, upon his death, intestate, inherited the same. After the death of Johnâs father, his mother, Jane, married Levi Shelp and by him had three daughters and two sons, viz.: Sarah, who married Henry P. Simmons; Mary Ann, who married (1) Harmon Oldis, (2) John Van Riper; Phoebe, who married Adrian Van Blarcom; Jacob Shelp and William Shelp. Henry P. Simmons was the owner at his death in 1896, and by his will devised the same to his executors in trust for his granddaughter, Margaret Gillen, and after her and her issue, then to Mary Eliza Hadley, another daughter. This old farm, therefore, has been owned by the Van Wagoner blood for over two hundred years, and is still thus vested.â\n\nFrom the book Pre-Revolutionary Houses in Southern NJ and Northern NY, we read âIn the Acquackanonk settlement a short distance above the Newark town purchase line (now Essex County border) runs a small stream known as the Miner Spring Brook. Lot No. 7 on its south bank, a 100 acre lot in the first division of the patent, fell to a member of the Vreeland family; Dirck Vreeland, baptized 1686, was still living there in 1750, and in 1778 another Richard Vreeland had his home there. Lot No. 6, immediately to the south, was allotted to Gerrit Gerritse Van Wagening, a patentee of Acquackanonk but a resident of Communipaw in the town of Bergen. His son Hermanus Gerritse settled further north in Acquackanonk, opposite the present bridge at Passaic (plate 154). On 30 Jan 1698/9, Gerrit Gerritse Van Wagening of the town of Bergen deeded to Christoffle Stynments of Essex Country Lot No. 6 in Acquackanonk, with the house lot and half the patent rights pertaining thereto. Christoffelâs parents were Casper Steynmetzen and Jannetje Gerrits; they had six sons baptized in New York between 1650 and 1670. They probably settled in Bergen about the time the youngest was born, as Casperâs wife Jannetje was buried in Bergen in 1670. Their fourth son Christoffel Stynmets, baptized 19 Dec 1660 in New York, married Jannetje Gerrits (baptized 19 Mar 1662) at Bergen 6 Oct 1684. She was the daughter of Gerrit Gerrits Van Wagening and Annetje Hermanse of Communipaw.â\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNIPAW NJ\n\nFrom the book Jersey City and Its Historic Sites, by the Jersey City Womenâs Club, we find this interesting record about the establishment of Communipaw NJ:Â âOn 8 Sep 1660, Jacques Cortelyou was ordered to survey Gemoenepa and lay it out into village lots. The village site fronted on the Bay, was two hundred feet deep and extended from what is now Communipaw avenue on the north to the Bay Shore House on the south. The Council ordered that the village should be stockaded, but there seems to have been numerous delays, for in June 1663, Gerrit Gerritsen (our ancestor) Harmen Smeeman and Dirck Claussen were appointed commissioners to fortify Gemoenepa.â\n\nFrom the book Pre-revolutionary Dutch Houses in Northern NJ and Southern NY, we find the will of Gerrit Van Wagening, son of Hermanus Gerittse (and grandson of Garret Garretse the immigrant): âGerrit Van Wagening made his will in 1769 shortly before he died. He devised to his son Hermanus the land where he (the son) dwelt, and to his son Johannis the land where he (the testator) dwelt with the building, stating that if Johannis did not marry, the land was to revert to Hermanus at Johannisâ death; Gerrit also mentioned his daughters and his second wife Sarah. The younger son Johannis Van Wagenen, born 18 Nov 1728, died unmarried in 1770/-71. He occupied the old Van Wagening homestead at the Passaic Bridge. The first bridge had been built here over the Passaic River in 1766. His older brother Hermanus Van Wagenen, born 4 Feb 1717 and died by 1794, married 29 Dec 1741 Geertruy Van Houten of Totowa. He lived at the Notch, but inherited all his fatherâs lands on the death of his brother. Hermanus left his property to his sons Ruleff and Garret. The family name later became standardized to Van Wagoner. It is not known when the family sold the house. It was owned by Judge Simmons about 1880, later was a part of Henry P. Simmonâs estate, and recently belonged to the Newport Chemical Co. It has been torn down since the photograph was taken in 1925.â\n\nVAN WAGENING HOUSE\n\nFORMERLY ON RIVER DRIVE--PASSAIC NJ, PLATE 154\n\nTaken from the book Pre-revolutionary Dutch Houses in Northern New Jersey and Southern New York, by W. Morrow and Co.\n\n(Note: This house has been torn down since the picture was taken in 1925)\n\nTHE APPLE TREE HOUSE\n\nIn the book Van Wagenen and Van Wagoner of Bergen County NJâCA 1660 we read about a well-known Wagenen home: âThis house located at 198 Academy Street in Jersey City NJ, presently is owned by the city of Jersey City and is only a short distance from the Bergen Reformed Dutch Church and the cemetery where many Van Wagenens are buried. It is a two-story brick and fieldstone house that was built in 1740 and purchased by the Van Wagenen family. Gerret Gerrettsen is said to have spent his first Christmas on this property after arriving from Holland, probably in a log cabin somewhere on the property. In 1779, George Washington, general of the Continental Army, met there with the Marquis de Lafayette to map out Revolutionary War strategy against the British and sat for their portraits. The Van Wagenen family owned the property for more than 200 years and then sold it to Lawrence Quinn, a local undertaker, in 1947. Until 1985 the house was known as Quinnâs Funeral Home, where services were held for local dignitaries. The house then fell into disrepair, with broken windows, dilapidated shutters and a dying apple tree in the front yard. Jersey City bought the Apple Tree House in 1999 from Provident Savings Bank for $450,000 and there is presently a committee attempting to have the house designated a state and national landmark and they hope to turn it into a museum. In the 1920s the residence was occupied by William Cokelet, age 55, b. NJ, his wife Eliza J., age 53, b. NJ, and Hannah Van Wagenen, age 12, sister-in-law.Â (This familyâs genealogical connection is undetermined).â (Van Wagenen and Van Wagoner of Bergen County NJâCA 1660)\n\nTHE HAMILTONâVAN WAGONER HOUSE\n\nFrom History of Passaic NJ and its Environs, we read âThe HamiltonâVan Wagoner home is a representative example of the pioneer homesteads that once dotted what was known as âold Acquackanonk.â With its graceful gambrel roof and red sandstone, the house reflects many of the characteristics of the architecture of early New Jersey Dutch colonists. Although the Hamilton family resided in the house for 116 years, actually only three generations called it home, ending in 1972 with the death of Henry Hamilton. At that time, the newly appointed Clifton Historical Commission approached the city council and urged that the house become an historical museum. It subsequently was moved across Valley Road into Surgent Park. Each room in the house reflects the different lives of the various families who called it home. No record has been found when the first dwelling was built on the original site or what it looked like. The property, however, passed from Garet Garritsee, one of the original Acquackanonk settlers, through his descendents to Hermanus VanWagoner, who was living in a nearby house at the time of the Revolution. In 1804 Anna Vreeland inherited the property from her grandfather, Garret VanWagoner, son of Hermanus. She married John J. Vreeland, a mason. Sometime around 1815, they built what is the main section of the house.Â The original house, some researchers believe, continued to be used as a kitchen. In 1837, the Vreelands sold the property to Jacob and Sarah Van Riper At about this time, the kitchen was enlarged and attached to the main house. The house remained basically unchanged for the next 135 years, save for some modernizing in the 1880âs and the installation of plumbing in the early 20th century. The Hamilton-Van Wagoner house is a living museum.â\n\nTHE HAMILTON â VAN WAGONER HOUSE\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â\n\nHALMAGH JOHNâS CONNECTION TO THE IMMIGRANT GERRIT\n\nHalmaghâs direct line was through Gerritâs youngest son, Johannes, who was born 11 Jan 1678, and then taken by his parents to be christened in The Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of New York. From the book Van Wagenen & Van Wagoner of Bergen County NJ, CA 1660, I quote, âIt was through Johannesâ marriage that we get the name âHalmaghâ that has been passed down through the family for generations. Johannes married Catelyntje Helmighse Van Houten 17 Oct 1703. Their eldest son was Helmigh (Halmagh), as written in the Dutch records, to honor his grandfather Helmigh Cornelise Van Houten. Dutch custom called for naming the first four children after the grandparents, if the sexes were right. If a child should die who had a name that was to honor his relatives, that name would be given to the next child born of the same sex. Sometimes three or four children in a family would all have the same name, the older ones dying young, until one was healthy enough to carry on the special family name.\n\nâJohannes was an active member of the Dutch church in Bergen, and his five sons and two daughters were christened there, except for his youngest son Johannis, who was christened in the NY Reformed Protestant Church as was his father. Six of the children married in the Dutch Church and had their children christened there too. Johannis, the youngest son of Johannis, married his first cousin, Neesje Van Wagenen, the daughter of his fatherâs oldest brother, Gerrit Gerritse, Jr., and Neesje Pieterse Marcelis. (NOTE: This may not be correct, as Gerrit does not appear to have had a daughter by that name. It more likely would have been the daughter of Gerritâs brother Jacob.) The oldest son, Helmigh, married Marritje Cornelise Blinkerhoff (which became Brinkerhoff), the daughter of Cornelius Blinkerhoff and Aegie Hartmanse Vreeland.\n\nâHelmigh bought 625 acres of land from his father-in-law that was situated on the Wanques River, on the side of the hill called Wanaque, on 12 Apr 1740. His father Johannes bought an additional amount just below his property, from Jacobus and Angenietje Blinkerhoff. (Jacobus was the brother of Cornelius.) The original sheepskin deed covering this transaction remained in the family for many years, in the possession of John Mervyn Smith, 81 South 600 East, Provo, Utah.\n\nâJohannes, husband of Catelyntje Helmighse Van Houten, made out his will in which he refers to himself as Johannes Gerritse Van Wagene of the Town of Bergen in the Province of New Jersey, yeoman (farmer). It is dated 24 Jul 1752 and was probated 8 Nov 1759. He leaves the property he purchased in Wanaque to his son Cornelius. (His eldest son, Helmigh, was deceased by this time, but Helmighâs oldest son John was left two pounds in NY currency by his grandfather in recognition of the birthright of his deceased father). The other two living sons, Jacob and Cornelius, also inherited property, but the will didnât indicate where Jacobâs was located. He lived to be 94 years and 10 months old, and was buried in the North Schraalenburgh Cemetery. Johannis and his wife Neesje received the property in the Town of Bergen from his father Johannes.\n\nâHelmigh and his wife, Marritje Blinkerhoff, had eight children: five daughters, which included a set of twins, and three sons, before Helmighâs early death, at the age of 39. Marritje lived for 56 more years and died at the age of 85. She was buried in the Old Graveyard at Dundee Lake on the Alyea property.\n\nâHelmigh and Marritjeâs son Johannes Van Wagene (as it appears in the Schrallenburgh Dutch Church register) was christened 27 Apr 1746. He used the name John H. Van Waggener and did not marry until almost 40 years old. He married Johanna (Anny, as she was called) Van Dervoort, who was only 18. The date of marriage was 18 Sep 1786. Family tradition is that John H. was living with his sister Catherine and aged mother Marritje, who was also blind. The pretty Van Devoort girl was hired to care for them. Annyâs father, David Vandevoort, had lost most of his money because of money exchanges after the Revolutionary War and had moved to New Jersey from Newtown, Long Island. Annyâs mother was Breechje (Bridget in English) Remsen.\n\nâAnna, the oldest daughter of Helmigh and Marritje, married John Smolagin or Smulliger in 1803 and the county court appointed him legal guardian for Bridget who was under age 14. Halmagh, however, was over 14 and thus able to choose his own guardian. He chose brother-in-law, John Smolagin. Bridget later married Abraham Baldwin on 25 Nov 1815. Theyâre supposed to have moved to San Francisco and built a hotel there.\n\nHALMAGH J & MARY VAN HOUTENâS FAMILY\n\nâHalmagh J. (or I as it appears in some records because the Dutch alphabet did not have the letter J) married Mary Van Houten, his third cousin once removed. In the will of John Pieterse Van Houten (Maryâs father), he refers to her as âPolly, wife of Halmagh I. Van Wagonerâ. Pollyâs mother was Annetje Roome. Pollyâs grandfather, Pieter Adrianse Van Houten, was the grandson of Pieter Helmighse, who was the brother of Catlyntje Helmighse Van Houten, who married Johannes Gerritse Van Wagene--the youngest son of immigrants Gerrit Gerritse and Annetje Hermanse; thus making two direct lines back to Gerrit Gerritse and his wife, Annetje Hermanse, and two lines back to Helmigh Cornelise Van Houten and his wife, Jannetje Pieterse Marselise.\n\nâHalmagh J. and Mary were married 22 Dec 1810 at Horseneck, Bergen County, by Reverend John Duryee. Horseneck has since been changed to Fairfield, a more euphonious name. They had five children, all born at Wanaque, Pompton Township, Bergen County, NJ. Pompton Township became a part of Passaic County in 1837. The first two were sons: John Halmagh, (after his grandfather and father, according to Dutch tradition) and Henry R. The last three were daughters.\n\nâJohn Halmagh was born 1 Sep 1811 and taken to Pompton Plains, Morris County NJ, where he was christened in the Reformed Dutch Church 12 Jan 1812. He married first on 24 Sep 1835, Eliza Smith in Old Bergen (Jersey City) by Reverend Benjamin C. Taylor. Eliza was born in Newark, Essex County, 15 Sep 1815, the daughter of Samuel Smith and Anna Simonson. The couple had two children before Eliza died of an untimely death 13 Jul 1840, leaving her husband to care for 4 year old David and 3Â½ month old Mary. He married again, on 21 Dec 1841, to Clarissa Tappen, daughter of Sarah Drew and George Tappen, who lived at Ringwood, a nearby community in Pompton Township. They were married in Pompton by a Dutch Reformed minister named Doolittle. Clarissa bore John 10 children: Ephraim, John, Ann, William, Cynthia, Clarissa, Henry, Esther, George, and Walter.\n\nâThe second son Henry R was born about 1813. The R may have stood for Roome, maiden name of his maternal grandmother. Some of the children may have been baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church at Ponds (now Oakland, Bergen County) which is closer than Pompton Plains, in Morris County, but unfortunately 150 years of Ponds Reformed Dutch Church records were destroyed by fire, so we do not have all the pertinent information about Halmagh and Pollyâs family. (Some family members believe Henry married Charlotte Benson and died in New Jersey about age 27, but no record has been found to support that marriage. Other family members believe he married Rachel Baker on 8 Sep 1840, as there is a marriage record to that effect. They do not rule out the first marriage though.\n\nâThe last three children of Halmagh and Polly were: Hannah, born 4 Apr 1815, and christened at the Pompton Plains Reformed Dutch Church. She married 4 Apr 1833, to James H. Smith, and moved to Salt Lake City with the Utah pioneers in 1847. The second daughter, Ann (our direct ancestor), was born 24 Mar 1817 and married John Havens on 13 Feb 1839 in Bergen NJ. She was divorced later because of her joining the Mormon Church and married Henry Nebeker while preparing to move to Utah. The last daughter, Sarah, was born 11 Jul 1822 and married John Fairbanks. Like her older sisters, she emigrated to Nauvoo and then moved on to Utah with the Mormon Pioneers.\n\nTHE VAN WAGONER FAMILY MEETS THE MORMONS\n\nâThe Halmagh J. Van Wagoner family first heard of the Mormons at a meeting in Meads Basin near Pompton. From Nettie Fairbanks Yatesâ history (a descendant of Halmagh J.âs daughter Sarah), we get this story: âHalmagh J.âs son, John Halmagh, was apprenticed out for 7 years to learn the carpentry and wheelwright trades. It was about this time that the Mormon missionaries came to New Jersey. John, a young man, went to their meetings out of curiosity and bought a Book of Mormon and obtained other Mormon literature. He would read parts of it aloud to the family when his father was not home. The father had said he could see nothing in religion. One day Sarah said, âIâm afraid John is going to join the Mormons.â âOh, I donât think soâ, said the mother. Johnâs book was kept in a certain drawer and in spare moments family members would get Johnâs book and read it. They then would talk about the things they had read. This led them to attend the meetings so they could learn more.\n\nâFinally they decided it was true and they wanted to be baptized, but none of them had said anything to Father Halmagh. One morning he said to them, âWhat is this that you are all so busy about? You seem to have a secret.â His wife said, âHalmagh, Iâve been going to tell you, but I havenât had the opportunity and youâre so opposed to religion. I meant to tell you before we went. You see, weâve all decided to join the Mormons, if you donât object.â Halmagh answered âSo youâve been keeping me in the dark. Well, you see Iâve been reading Johnâs book too. So, if you will get my things ready, Iâll go with you to be baptized.â They were baptized by Elder John Leach 13 Apr 1844, but some of their descendents report that the preaching of Parly P. Pratt also played a part in converting some of the family members.\n\nWESTERN MIGRATION\n\nâHalmagh and Polly sold their property in Wanaque to Peter Vandervoort, a relative of Halmaghâs mother, for $3,000 on 14 Nov 1845. Family tradition is that they gave $500 to the Church to help the emigration of the Saints to Nauvoo. When the Saints were forced to leave Nauvoo, the entire family (parents and children) traveled West with the Orson Hyde Company to Winter Quarters, near the present city of Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nâThe first hard winter there (1846-1847), was disastrous. An epidemic of cholera took over 600 lives. Halmagh J. and his wife Mary were among those who died. Itâs significant to note their second-great-grandson, Avard Fairbanks, was called on by the Church to use his talent to create a monument to honor those saints and thousands of others who lost their lives crossing the plains. This inspired monument stands at Pioneer Cemetery in Omaha, Nebraska. Halmagh John Van Wagoner and his wife Mary Van Houten Van Wagoner have their names inscribed there in bronze along with many other valiant pioneers.â\n\n(NOTE: The name Halmagh is descended from the Dutch name \"Helmige\" (with various spellings), which also meant Wilhelm in German or William in English, so these names that appear from generation to generation in this family are all related. Therefore, it is little wonder that Ann Van Wagoner named her first son \"William\" Henry Havens after her father, Halmagh.)Â\n\nSection 2\n\nTHE VAN HOUTEN\n\nFAMILY\n\nOUR VAN HOUTEN ORIGINS\n\nThe progenitor of the Van Houten family of Totowa NJ is generally considered to have been Roelof Cornelissen. However, there are different stories regarding his origin. Here are some:\n\nFrom the book Genealogical History of Hudson and Bergen Counties NJ and NY we read: âBoele Roelfosen Joncker, a native of the Province of Gelderland, Holland, and his wife and four children, besides his wifeâs sister and a boy, came to America in Feb 1659 and settled at New Amsterdam. His wifeâs surname was Teunis. The names of the children he brought with him were Halmagh, Cornelis, Teunis, and Matilda, and after his arrival in New York he had two more children baptized: Henry, 6 Feb 1661, and Catharine 8 Oct 1662. Roelofsenâs children after his death removed to and settled at Bergen NJ. Halmagh married 3 Sep 1676 Jannetje Peters, a daughter of Peter Merselis, of Beest Holland. Cornelis married 14 Nov 1677, Magdalena Ryneses Van Giesen. Teunis married 8 Jan 1678, Catharine Claes Kuyper (Cooper). Matilda married 22 Jul 1683, John Hendricks. No further mention is made of the other two children. Halmaghâs children, baptized at Bergen, were ten: Roelof, Peter, Cornelus, Catelyntie, Jacob, Dirck, Geertie, Elizabeth, John and Jannetie. These all remained at Bergen, where their descendants are very numerous. Cornelius went to Aquackanonck, where, on 16 Mar 1684, he and several others purchased and settled on a large tract known as the Aquackanonck (Passaic) patent. His children were Grietie, Roelof, Rynier, Drickie, John, and Cornelius. These remained at Passaic, and their descendants are numerous in Passaic County and in the western and northern parts of Bergen County. Teunis removed to Rockland County NY (then Orange County) where he purchase lands and located, and where he became somewhat noted. In 1689 he was a Justice for Orange County and the same year he was a member of the Committee of Safety to deal with the treason of Governor Leisler at New York. He had 13 children, some baptized at Bergen, some New York, and some at Tappan. Their names were Grietie, Rolof, Ann, Claes, Jannetie, Vroutie, Cornelia, John, Vroutie, Elizabeth, Pietartie, Grietie, and Anetie. Many of these married and their descendants spread over Rockland County NY and southward into Bergen County NJ.â\n\nFrom the book Passaic County and its Environs, we read, âThere is no record of him prior to 1638, when Roelof Cornelissen Van Houten was among emigrants that year to Rensselaerwyck. The records show that four brothersâRoelof, Pieter, Helmigh and Theunis, all sons of Cornelis somebodyâcame to New Netherlands between 1638 and 1650, settling in various places, but ultimately taking up their abodes at Amesfoort, Long Island. Their descendants took different surnames. Under date of 13 Jan 1657, the schepens of Amesfoort assessed Roelof Cornelissen for ten florins. His wife was Gerritje Van Nes, but there is no record to show where either of them came from before their emigration to America. Their children in their later years sometimes assumed the name Van Houten which might indicate that Roelof was from Houten, a village in the southeastern part of the province of Utrect in Holland. The children of Roelof Cornelissen and Gerritje Van Nes were three sons and a daughter, Geesje, who became the wife of Lubbent Lubberts in (Westervelt).â\n\nFrom A Historical Sketch of the County of Passaic NJ we read. âIn 1648, Roelof Cornelissen was a Dutch soldier on Manhattan Island, and quarreling with his Corporal wounded that officer, for which he was sentenced âto ride the wooden horse two hours a day for three days, with a ten-pound weight fastened to each foot, to pay the surgeonâs bill, and to forfeit six monthsâ wages.â Now it is quite likely that this disgrace befell Roelof because he had become excessively frisky over the birth of an heir, Hellemeg (or Helmig), on 25 Jun, to himself and his wife Gerritje Van Nes. In 1651, they had another child, Cornelis, undoubtedly the Acquackanonk patentee. He married at Bergen, 14 Nov 1677, Magdaleena Van Giesen. They had 7 childrenâGrietje, Roelof, Rynier, Hendrick, Dirckje, Johannis, and Cornelis. His wife appears to have been a daughter of Rynier and sister of Bastiaen Van Giesen, the names Rynier, Hendrick and Dirckje being common in that family in the 17th century. He died prior to 1711. His son, Roelof Cornelisse, took the surname van Houten, perhaps because some of his ancestors came from the pleasant village of Houten, now a notable place of 1050 inhabitants, in Utrecht, Holland. He married Jannetje Spijr, and between 1715 and 1727 seven children were born unto himâHelena, Cornelis, Johannes, Jacob, Maria, Henricus and Abraham. He owned and doubtless lived on a plot of land in Passaic, at the corner of Monroe and Grove streets.Â\n\nPURCHASE OF THE TOTOWA PATENT\n\nFrom the same source: âThe western part of Manchester, including Totowa, was originally patented in 1686 to George Willocks, one of the Proprietaries, and was sold prior to 1710 to Anthony Brockholls, Helmegh Roelofse and Roelef Helmeghseâwhom we should nowadays call Halmagh or âHamâ Van Houten and Ralph Van Houten. This was called the Totowa Patent, and extended from the Passaic river back to the hillsâthe line of the Pacquanac Patentâand from Hamburgh Avenue northwesterly three and a quarter miles, to about opposite the mouth of the Peckman river. It was divided into three parcelsâLots 1, 2, and 3; the Van Houtens took No. 1, and in 1724 bought No. 2 also. In 1768, the heirs of Brockholls sold No. 3, or what remained of it, to Garrebrandt Van Houten, Marte Ryerse, Holmer Van Houten and Abraham Godwin. A part of it, including the Great Falls, had been previously sold to Bastiaen Van Giesen, whose sister had married Cornelius Roelofsen Van Houten. When Van Giesen made his will, by the way, he provided for all his ten children before he thought about the Falls, and then gave them all an equal interest in it, for fishingâthat being its only value a century ago! These Totowa Van Houtens appear to have first settled at Slooterdam, in Bergen county. They were active, enterprising men, and made the most of their purchase. They were foremost in the school and in the church, and until the Totowa church was formed, in 1754, were almost invariably represented in the Acquackanonk Consistory. They and the Ryersons intermarried more than a century ago, and those two families could always control affairs in their neighborhood. It is but just to say their rule was acceptable to their fellow citizens.\n\nTHE MERSELIS FAMILY\n\nAgain I quote: âThe Merselis family is another very old one in New Jersey history and the first of the family in this country was Peter Marselis (or Merselis), who, on 9 May 1661, sailed from Amsterdam Holland, in the ship Beaver and arrived at New Amsterdam, Manhattan Island, on 29 July. He settled, with his wife, four children, and two servants, in Bergen, where his wife died 1 Aug 1680. He died 4 Sep 1682. On 20 Aug 1682, he conveyed property to his son-in-law, Helmigh Roeloff Van Houten. (Proceedings of NJ Historical Soc. Vol. I, No. 1, 3rd Series, 1896) He was said to be from Leerdam Holland. John Neafie says he might have been born in Leerdam, but when he came to America, he was from the village of Beest, near the town of Buren, in the province of Gelderland, where at least three of his children were born.\n\nâPeter Marselisâs four children, when he arrived in this country, were aged 13, 6, 4 and 2 years. The name and sex of the first we do not know. The second was called Marcelis, always known as Mercelis Pieterse. The third was Jannetje Pieterse, who 3 Sep 1676, married Roelof Helmigse Van Houten. The fourth was Neesje Pieterse, who married Gerrit Gerritson, Jr. on 11 May 1681. He reportedly held property in Preakness.â\n\nSWEARING ALLEGIANCE\n\nCounty officials in the reign of King George II had to subscribe to set oaths, which sounds a bit strange to us in America. According to Joannes Nevius, Schepen And 3rd Secretary of New Amsterdam, here is a list, dated 1755, of names subscribed in the following oaths:\n\nAllegiance to the King\n\nâI do heartily and sincerely acknowledge, profess, testify, and declare, in my conscience, before God and the world, that our sovereign lord, King George the Second, is lawful and rightful king of Great Britain and all other his Majestyâs dominions and countries thereunto belonging. and I do solemnly and sincerely declare, and I do believe in my conscience, that the person pretending to be the Prince of Wales during the life of the late King James, or since his decease, pretending to assume to himself the title of King of England, by the name of James the Third, or James the Eighth, or the full title of the King of Great Britain, or by any right or title whatever to the crown of Great Britain, or any other dominions thereunto belonging; and I do renounce, refuse, and abjure any and all allegiance or obedience to him; and I do swear that I bear faithful and true allegiance to his Majesty King George the Second, and him will defend to the utmost of my power against all traitorous conspiracies or attempts whatsoever to be made against his person, crown, or dignity, and I will do my utmost endeavors to disclose and make known to his Majesty and his successors all treasons and traitorous conspiracies which I shall know to be against him or them; and I do faithfully promise to the utmost of my power to uphold and defend the sacredness of the crown against him, the said James, under any title whatsoever; which succession, by an act entitled âAn act for the succession of the crown and the better securing the rights and liberties of the subjects,â is limited to the Princess Sophia, electress and duchess dawager (sp) of Hanover, and the heirs of her body, being Protestants. And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear according to the express words by me spoken, and according to the plain sense and understanding of the same, without any equivocation, mental evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever. And I do make this recognition, acknowledgment, abjuration, renunciation, and promise heartily, willingly, and truly, upon the true faith of a Christian. So help me God.\n\nAbjuration of the Papacy\n\nâI do swear that I do from my heart abhor, detest, and abjure as impious and heretical that damnable doctrine and position that princes excommunicated by the Pope or any authority of the See of Rome may be deposed or murdered by their subjects or any other Catholics; and I do promise that no foreign prince, person, prelate, or potentate shall or ought to take any jurisdiction, superiority, pre-eminence, or authority, either ecclesiastical or civil, within the realm of Great Britain. So help me God.â NOTE: The following signatures appear beneath these oaths:\n\nWilliam Kingsland, Arent Schuyler, Johnnes Van Houten, Michael Vreelandt, John Cardan, Isaac Kingsland, Jost Van Roskirk, Walingh Van Winkel, Johannes Bougart, Philip Schuyler, Jan Van Orden, Jacobus Wynkoop, Pieter Bogert, George Reyerse, Jr., Roeleff Van Der Linder, Theunis Day, Simon Vreeland, Albert Zabriskie, Jacobus Van Buskirk, Abraham Leydecker, Jacob Horne, Jacob Van Nostrand, Jr., Luke Reyerse, Albert Berdan, Jacob Sitson, Ardsen Kersoris, Garret Hollenbck, John Schuyler, William J.

On the 9th, the headquarters were established at Totowa, where they remained for six weeks. The main army was encamped at the foot of the Preakness mountain, extending along for two or three miles, General Washington being quartered in a fine brick house still standing, a mile or two west of Paterson, in what was long known as the âHogencamp house,â although he occasionally passed a night with some of the Van Houtens of Totowa.\n\nFrom the book, Joannes Nevius, Schepen And 3rd Secretary of New Amsterdam, we find this interesting story: âCornelius Neafie and his brother-in-law, Robert Van Houten, were on their way to Bergen, or New York, in the Revolutionary War period, about 1781 or 1782, and were unarmed. When, near the Hackensack River, they were confronted by three negroes, supposed to have been slaves of Cornelius Neafie, who were armed with guns. Van Houten was permitted to enter the boat and when half way across heard the sound of the guns. He made his way quickly as possible to Bergen Hill and brought back help to the scene of the shooting, where it was found that Neafie had been tied to a tree and shot to death. The negroes were tracked to Hackensack, captured and brought back to the place where Neafie was murdered, where they were all hung to the same tree, without any form of trial. The act is supposed to have been inspired by Tories.â\n\nLIST OF MAJOR SOURCES USED\n\nHistorical Sketch of the County of Passaic New Jersey, especially of the first settlements and settlers, Chiswell and Wurts, 1877\n\nHistory of Bergen Co.
