        "text": "Let’s take a seven day road trip to Virginia! With all the historic sites in this area of the United States, it’s hard to figure out the best road trip route and what you can actually add to your US history road trip itinerary. There are so many amazing museums and historic places, you need a travel itinerary that tells you how to organize your time, minimize your stress, and what to expect during your family vacation to the historic triangle and Virginia.\n\nPlanning a trip to Virginia? Here is the Virginia road trip itinerary you need!\n\nWhen you click and purchase a link in my post, I may earn an affiliate commission at no extra cost to you. I promise to only recommend products or places that I have personally want, used, or researched. Thanks for the gallon of gas (wink!).\n\nThe Seven Day Virginia Road Trip Overview\n\nDepending on your starting location, this Virginia road trip itinerary could be done either direction. Most of these Virginia road trip sights are located in the Historic Triangle in Virginia. Look at a map to fully understand why it’s called “Historic Triangle”; Jamestown, Williamsburg, and York town are all very close together.\n\nIf you are driving south out of the area to go back home, consider moving the Norfolk adventure day to the last day for a quick wiggle stop on your way home. Most of the days in this Virginia vacation itinerary are not in any particular order; I switched up our tour of Virginia accounting for kid attention spans, topic of interest, and time needed.\n\nThe only historic Virginia site on this historical road trip list that is further away is Appomattox Courthouse. It is a two-and-a-half hour drive from Williamsburg to Appomattox, so plan to see Appomattox on the way in or out of the area.\n\nIf you only have time for a Virginia weekend trip, I would suggest Historic Jamestowne and Williamsburg. These were the most impactful during our road trip in Virginia, and these are true Virginia historic tours.\n\n~~~> If you have another week in your family road trip traveling Virginia, head north just a short distance to add Mount Vernon and Washington DC to your history lesson. Plan your DC trip with my post “Practical Tips to Make your DC Trip Easier” and add these “10 DC Hidden Gems Your Kids Will Love.”\n\nWhere Should I Stay During My Virginia Road Trip?\n\nDuring this Virginia trip, plan to stay in one hotel during your week vacation in the Historic Triangle area of Virginia and make day trips every day. As the main sites of Jamestown and Williamsburg are only 15 minutes from each other, the longest day-trip from Williamsburg is only one hour away in Norfolk.\n\nFor our Virginia travel itinerary, we chose to stay at the Historic Powhatan Williamsburg with Hilton Vacation Club which is only fifteen minutes away from Jamestown Settlement and five minutes from Williamsburg. Our family of six stayed perfectly in a two bedroom suite which felt more like our own personal apartment complete with a full kitchen and washer and dryer.\n\nHistoric Powhatan is a huge resort with full amenities including miles of walking trails, indoor and outdoor pools, multiple playgrounds, and even tennis courts. With options ranging from one room hotels to up to four bedroom suites, this is a perfect place also for an extended family gathering. Make sure you plan some downtime during vacation to enjoy hanging out as a family.\n\n~~~> Check out this direct link to the Hilton Vacation Club Historic Powhatan Williamsburg. It’s a good one!\n\nDay 1 – Appomattox Battlefield and Museum\n\nLet’s head out on day one of this Virginia itinerary for seven days. Appomattox is a great day trip if you’re driving in from several hours or spent all day yesterday on your drive to Virginia. Appomattox Battlefield is only about an hour from our first overnight stop in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nVisit Appomattox Court House National Historical Park\n\nWith the pivotal final battle and signing of the surrender document between Generals Grant and Lee, the small town of Appomattox, Virginia played an important role in the Civil War. Unlike other battlefield visits, Appomattox Court House has a small town to wander including the home where the surrender was signed, the jail, a store, and several buildings including a small museum.\n\nPlan to spend a couple of hours here at least. Wander around by foot. Take a driving tour. Join a guided tour. Complete the Junior Ranger book. And if you’re a homeschooling Classical Conversations family, definitely take time to sing your history song… “Surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia.”\n\nHelp your kids get even more interested in visiting this site, with an excellent kid’s picture book The Silent Witness about a doll that watched the surrender happen. When you’re in the house, you will see the room mentioned and the couch where the doll would have sat. History comes to life on this trip to Virginia! (And we just started 🙂 )\n\nVisit the American Civil War Museum at Appomattox, Virginia\n\nThe American Civil War Museum at Appomattox is a five minute ride from the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. Do the free national park, and follow it up with the high-quality paid museum to complete the rest of the story. Here you will see more than 400 artifacts from the battle including Robert E. Lee’s uniform and sword.\n\nIf you plan to visit here, consider purchasing the combo ticket which also gets you into the White House of the Confederacy in Richmond.\n\nTake a Quick Trip to Richmond, Virginia\n\nWhen traveling Virginia, it’s only a two hour drive from Appomattox to the next stop in Monticello. You may have time for an extra stop as you will drive right through Richmond, the capital of Virginia. Plan to start your Thomas Jefferson learning by driving past the Virginia Capitol in Richmond and learn its importance as the start of the neo-classical design in the United States. Jefferson designed it based on a Roman temple, and you can visit it.\n\nDay 2 – Visiting Jefferson’s UVA and Monticello\n\nGrab Breakfast at Bodo’s Bagels; Charlottesville, Virginia\n\nFor a true university experience while traveling Virginia, you need to eat like a college kid at Bodo’s Bagels, a Charlottesville speciality. Before heading to the University of Virginia, head right across the street from the main entrance to have a delicious bagel breakfast sandwich from Bodo’s. It’s worth waiting in line. Once you have your food, head across to the university for a breakfast picnic.\n\nVisit the University of Virginia\n\nIf you’re learning about Thomas Jefferson, you need to learn about one of his biggest accomplishments. Don’t just choose Monticello as one of your historical tours in Virginia. Head to Jefferson’s University of Virginia.\n\nDid you know that, when composing the words for his future tombstone, he including helping found this university and didn’t even include his presidency? He loved it and so should you. Not to mention, it’s a beautiful campus. Check out this self-guided walking tour to bring to life the campus of the University of Virginia. Make sure you learn about where Edgar Allen Poe stayed while he was a student there.\n\nDay one was only a short drive of less than an hour and a half from Appomattox to Charlottesville. This would be a great time to wander around the campus of the University of Virginia if you get there earlier in the evening, or you can just take in the town of Charlottesville.\n\nVisit Jefferson’s Monticello\n\nA day at Monticello is the highlight of your visit to Thomas Jefferson’s hometown of Charlottesville. I can honestly say it’s my favorite historic house that we have visited.\n\nWatch a video about his life\n\nExplore the vegetable garden.\n\nVisit Jefferson’s beloved home and grave\n\nLearn about the construction of the house\n\nSee Lewis and Clark artifacts inside the home\n\nExplore the gardens and lawn that he designed\n\nRead about his life and accomplishments at the museum\n\nTake a tour of the slave quarters and learn about the life\n\n~~~> Head to my in-depth post all about Monticello sights, tips, and history at “Monticello: How to Plan your Best Family Trip.”\n\nDay 3 – Historic Jamestowne and Williamsburg\n\nDay 3 is a busy day on this Virginia travel itinerary, but before planning this portion of your Virginia trip, you need to understand the difference between these places.\n\nHistoric Jamestowne vs Jamestown Settlement\n\nJamestown Settlement is a reconstruction of the fort. The outdoor living museum has colonial interpreters who talk to you about their settlement and demonstrate for you their trades while the Powhatan characters show you their village, canoes, and lifestyle. Also outside are the three rebuilt ships from the original landing, and you are able to climb aboard the Susan Constant. Not to be overlooked is the state of the art Jamestown museum inside which also has two movies to view.\n\nIn contrast, Historic Jamestowne is a national park site on the ruins of the original landing site where you can see current day archeology digs, see the original layout of the wall, experience the proximity to the water, and see original artifacts in the museum. Very different experience. Both great.\n\nThese are two different places. It is my suggestion that you visit them on two different days because it’s just a lot. Although you can visit them in either order, I think if you visit the original site first, the kids (and parents) would have more interest in all the reading at the museum.\n\nVisit Historic Jamestowne, Virginia\n\nHistoric Jamestown is a National Park site and includes the current and past archeological digs at the site. Started in 1994, archeological digs have been undertaken to discover the original site of the fort along the James River. This is such a different experience from the reconstructed fort. We loved it – especially my history-loving, archeology-loving kid.\n\nDrive the around the island, get out and explore, and see the land of the settlers\n\nJoin a tour with a guide or archeologist and visit the current dig\n\nWalk along the water and take a nature walk\n\nSee the infamous basement and church\n\nSee artifacts at the Archearium\n\nVisit the glass blowing house and learn why Jamestown was a perfect location for glass production\n\n~~~> Check out all the details about Historic Jamestown at my detailed post “Historic Jamestowne: How to Plan Your Day.“\n\nWander the College of William and Mary\n\nLet’s head to the College of William and Mary to visit the second oldest higher-learning institute. It was here that many founding fathers were educated including Thomas Jefferson. Let the kids wander and consider taking the self-guided tour around William and Mary. It’s a beautiful area.\n\nIt is on the opposite side of Williamsburg from the Visitor Center, so find a paid parking spot. You are going to stay in this spot for the rest of the night, so make sure it allows several hours.\n\nExplore Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia for Free\n\nHere’s the thing about Williamsburg, it is huge and more than you can do in a day. Wander the streets, get a feel for the layout of the town, admire the houses from the outside. You could even hire a buggy to take you around. There are places you can only get in with a ticket – we will do that another day – so prepare the kids that they won’t be able to perhaps do what other people are doing.\n\nThe modern-day town of Williamsburg is right there at the Colonial Williamsburg. You will see the houses, restaurants, and shops for “regular people” only blocks from the historic portion. Without rushing around to get the most from your one-day ticket to Williamsburg, you now have time to wander the historic town at your speed. For fun! You will have time to experience Williamsburg with kids on your ticketed day.\n\n~~~> Be even more prepared for your Williamsburg day at “Colonial Williamsburg: How to Plan the Best Family Visit.“\n\nDay 4 – Jamestown, Donuts, and Play Time\n\nVisit the Jamestown Settlement\n\nTake a day for afamily visit to the Jamestown Settlement for a top-notch museum with some great outdoor exhibits. This is a great way to bring to life the Jamestown that you saw in ruins two days ago. Although you could spend all day here, I would plan to focus on the video inside and the outdoor exhibits. It completely depends on your kids interest and patience levels. Entrance here will be with your combined Jamestown-Yorktown ticket you purchased online.\n\nWander the reconstructed settlement.\n\nSee the reconstructed Powhatan village.\n\nExplore the replicas of the three original ships.\n\nTalk with the townspeople to see how they lived.\n\nWatch them cook, blacksmith, carve a canoe, build shelters, etc.\n\nFor detailed information about what to expect, read “A Family Visit to the Jamestown Settlement.“\n\nTake a Snack Break with Duck Donuts\n\nAlthough this is a national donut chain, it was our first experience, and it may be your first time at Duck Donuts too. It won’t be your last. Prepare to watch them fry your donuts as your pick your glaze and toppings for your specialized treat. The Duck Donuts in Williamsburg was way too close to my family’s condo during vacation to just go one time.\n\nVisit Freedom Park and Botanical Gardens\n\nRemember to take some time and let the kids be kids. Freedom Park in Williamsburg, Virginia has playgrounds and two miles of trails, but it has lots more to offer including history and a sense of adventure. This park is also the site of an 18th century cemetery, a Revolutionary War Battle, and one of the US’ earliest Free Black Settlements. Take a break from playing on the playground to walk over and check out the three historically recreated cabins.\n\nThe Williamsburg Botanical Garden in Freedom Park is member-maintained and a lovely little stroll. With more than 800 species of plants and trees, there’s shade here for a hot afternoon and little garden treasures for the kids to discover.\n\nIf you’re really pushing for a fun time, check out the GoApe Treetop Adventure Course. I wasn’t fun enough to splurge for this treetop ropes course, and if you aren’t either, make sure you let the kids know that it will not be part of their free playground fun.\n\nDay 5 – A Day Road Trip from the Historic Triangle to Norfolk, VA\n\nLet’s have a day of learning that doesn’t involve even more American history. The kids’ brains can only take in so much, and as my own kids like to remind me, all these places start to blend together after a while. And we will drive across Chesapeake Bay – it’s a good idea to let the kids see how big this thing is! Look at it on the map and see how it leads to Jamestown.\n\nVisit the Chrysler Museum of Art\n\nPlan to spend a couple of hours wandering the Chrysler Museum of Art – free art museum! Let your kids meet Pollock, Lichtenstein, and Warhol in person. This is a beautiful museum inside and out.\n\nWander Along the Norfolk, Virginia Waterfront\n\nPlan to park and stay for several hours. There are even several nice restaurants along the water if you want to stay for a nice supper. How much time and money you want to spend can be variable. The garden is free, and you can see the battleship without difficulty without paying for the entrance. If you have more time, pay to go inside the amazing ship or the museum.\n\nBattleship Wisconsin and the Hampton Roads Naval Museum\n\nPagoda and Oriental Garden – Free for a quick wander through a beautiful garden setting\n\nArmed Forces Memorial and Lone Sailor Statue\n\nNaval Station Norfolk – See the giant battleships and carriers that are being repaired at the Naval Station right across the water.\n\nAdmire all the yachts and big boats parking here!\n\nLearn at the MacArthur Memorial\n\nTake the time to do some other US history learning at the MacArthur Memorial. Free admission to explore the life of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and those who served with him during World War 1, World War 2, and the Korean War. We didn’t have time to do this!\n\nDay 6 – Colonial Williamsburg\n\nSince visiting Colonial Williamsburg is at the top of your must-see list, you may not want to save it until the end of your Virginia trip just in case you have to cut your trip short. However, I also think it gives everyone something to look forward to after exploring it for free on other days.\n\nVisiting Colonial Williamsburg felt (to me) a bit like Disney World. You have an app that tells you what time and where the special programs are happening. You have to coordinate all that with the map to see where you can actually reasonably get. And you know that you will never be able to see it all at once. That’s why I suggest saving free places for wandering at other times.\n\nAlthough you can get the three day Williamsburg ticket, there won’t be time during your one week vacation to return multiple times most likely. However, if you want to see every bit of it, there’s plenty to see.\n\nPut on good shoes. Plan to eat lunch at a historic tavern. Bring some water and snacks. And prepare to be immersed in history.\n\n~~~>For detailed planning for your Williamsburg, Virginia itinerary, check out my guide “Colonial Williamsburg: How to Plan the Best Family Visit”.\n\nDay 7 – Yorktown Museum and Battlefield\n\nVisit the American Revolution Museum at Yorktown\n\nThe American Revolution Museum at Yorktown is the other part of the combination ticket you already bought for Jamestown. As they are made by the same people, they are very similar and equally amazing, state-of-the-art history museums. Williamsburg and Monticello were about Jefferson; this is about Washington and Hamilton.\n\nWatch some videos\n\nExplore exhibits in the museum.\n\nHead outside for a possible artillery demonstration.\n\nExplore the tent camp as would have been used by Washington.\n\nSee the farm, house, and tobacco shed.\n\nVisit Yorktown Battlefield\n\nYorktown Battlefield is an important part of history, but I will add, it’s not the most exciting place for the kids to visit. Yes, General Cornwallis surrendered to General George Washington ending the Revolutionary War. However, we’ve visited several battlefields and most look like fields with lots of driving. With that in mind, we didn’t spend a lot of time here.\n\nIf your history buffs are up for it, download the app, read everything at the Visitor Center, complete the Junior Ranger badge, and soak it all up. If you just want to make the kids remember something, sing the Hamilton song about “Battle of Yorktown” and rap. Then drive over to see the still-in-place redoubts built by Alexander Hamilton and Lafayette. It’s so cool to make history come alive. You can still see the wood spikes sticking out of the mounds. They’ll remember this for sure.\n\nWander Around Yorktown, Virginia\n\nSave this for after the museum and car ride around the battlefield, so the kids can walk around town and get off museum energy. Park at the portion of the battlefield close to the historic town, get out, and prepare to wander. Pull up the walkable Yorktown tour and wander around looking at the historic houses and streets. Prize to the first of you to find the cannonball stuck in the side of the house! Talk about bringing history to life.\n\nThe modern portion of Yorktown in a tiny town right on the water. There’s a small beach which is great for letting the kids splash in the water and play in the sand. Additionally, it is right on the river, so you will see some historic ships sailing by on cruises. Eat a meal, visit a few small shops, and have an ice cream.\n\n~~~> Whew! That was quite the seven days you spend exploring Jamestown, Jamestowne, Williamsburg, Monticello, and so much more during this first of many trips to Virginia.
