        "text": "a a a a a a a Record Member of Associated DEMOCRATSTALK WITH ROOSEVELT ON NEW SESSION President Elect Faces Hoover Parley On Eastern Row WANT MORE POWER (By Associated Press) Washington, Jan. 19. Presidentelect Roosevelt comes to the national Capital today to see for himself the piled-up heap of vital domestic and international problems facing his administration. During an overnight stay he will make an attack on them in a round of conferences which include a meeting with President Hoover at the White House at 11 a. tomorrow .\n\nSoon after his arrival at 3:15 p. m. today a steady stream of Democratic leaders in Congress will call at his hotel suite to outline the legislative situation and lay plans for an extra session which probably will be called between April 10 and 17. Then on Friday, morning he will present himself the executive mansion he will occupy after March 4 for a second conference with Mr. Hoover since the November elections .\n\nThe far eastern crisis involving the clash between Japan and China seemed to be the subject of first moment. The muddled congressional situation will be explained in detail to Mr. Roosevelt by his party chieftains, an explanation which very likely will include a detailed account of the Senate filibuster which has widened the breach between conservative and liberal wings of the Democratic party and tied up legislation for more than week. WOULD CLEAR HIS WAY Democratic leaders now plan to salvage whatever they can from their original program for the short session and shape a new program for the extra session. For the remaining few weeks of this session the leadership will thrust their energies behind economy proposals and attempt to obtain wide powers for incoming President to reorganize the government when he comes in .\n\nIn view of the existing Legislative jam in Congress, their controversial nature, and the possibility of Presidential vetoes the Democrats believe there is little or no chance for passage of repeal, beer, farm relief and other important measures on their program before March 4. Plans for enacting budget-balancing revenue legislation were dropped yesterday to await the special session. The White House conference is expected by responsible officials to be largely informative in nature, with Mr. Hoover supplying Mr. Roosevelt with his views to supplement the presentation made a few days ago by Secretary Stimson .\n\nMr. Hoover and the President-elect are now known to be agreed on the American Policy in the Far East the policy of defending the treaties which guarantee China's integrity. War debts and the proposed world economic conference also are expected to be touched upon, probably in the hope of finding some means of keeping an exchange of views on these subjects active until Mr. Roosevelt takes office. Regarding the economic conference and disarmament questions Mr .\n\nRoosevelt has expressed agreement with the Hoover policy in the main. But foreign powers have linked debts discussions so definitely with plans for the economic parley that the experts who are trying now at Geneva to work out a program are in a deadlock. The European powers have insisted that they can not complete plans for such a meeting until they know what the attitude of the United States will be on debt revision. In their first meeting and subsequent of views President Hoover Mr. exchange, Roosevelt were unable to agree on a method of approaching the debts problem .\n\nSecretaries Stimson and Mills will sit in the conference with the Prestdent while Professor Raymond Moley, his economic adviser, probably will attend the Democratic leader. The talk is looked upon in official quarters as serving to forge a link between the two administrations on internal questions. Robinson of Arkansas, the Democratic leader in the Senate, Speaker Garner. Senators Harrison of Mississippi; Byrnes and Smith of South Carolina, and Representative Collier of Mississippi, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee are among those who likely will discuss the congressional situation with Mr. Roosevelt .\n\nMost of them agree that appropriation measures, cut sharply in the interests of economy, may constitute the bulk legislation for this session. However, members of both parties are driving to obtain measures looking to an casing of the difficulties faced by bankrupts and some sort of relief for farmers threatened with foreclosures. SEN.

ATTACK UNION CZAR AGAIN; TO GET RECORDS Bring New Charge Of Racketeering Against Brandle AFFIDAVIT SIGNED He Will Appear Before Custodial Receiver With Attorney Special to the Bergen Evening Record) Jersey City, Jan. additional charges of labor racketeering were brought against Theodore M .\n\nBrandle, iron union czar, it was announced that the missing records of the union will be surrendered to the custodial receiver today.

At that time he was injured, and according the rules of the union was entitled to $50 week- ly. WORKER SUSPENDED Brandle suspended Enright \"for non-payment of dues,\" and Enright got no compensation. It is suspected that compensation was paid out of the union's funds, however. Since the time of his injury, Enright has been out of work .\n\nHe did not prefer charges before, he said, because he feared Barndle's reprisal. Enright is the fifth member of Local 45 to file charges against the officers of the union. original writs, which stripped Brandle and his lieutenants of power Tuesday night, were signed by Robert Nemm, 338 Palisade Avenue; Joseph Walton, 219 Manhattan Avenue; Alvin Hendricks, 201 Ninth Street, and Alex McCormack, 21 Griffith Street, all Jersey City.

He was patrolling on Madison Street, Paterson, when he noted the car in which the three bandits were cruising. They later admitted they were \"spotting something to stick-up.\" Notification of stolen car in which they were riding had been given the officer and seeing the license plates, he immediately commandeered a car to follow them. The bandits noted the chase, and attempting to escape, sped away from the pursuing car. Patrolman Zyk fired his revolver in the air at first, as note of warning, but the fleeing car failed to halt .\n\nThe pursuit led over the Lincoln Avenue bridge, into Hawthorne, Fair and Glen Rock, with the Paterson, the policeman speeding emptying, his an revol- effort to shake off the trailers, the bandits cut back west, once again into Fair Lawn. Patrolling on Wagaraw Road, near Pomona Avenue, Patrolman Leland A.

KUIKEN RENEW PLEA TO SUSPEND FALLON Business Men To Ask Action Jan .\n\n27 One hundred blunt men of business today will engage special counsel to plead Jan. 27 before Chancellor Campbell that Vice-Chancellor John J. Fallon be suspended. Three men acting for the committee of 100 petitioned the Chancellor yesterday to make this move. He would not act .\n\nholding that\" to do so would prejudice a hearing slated for a week from tomorrow in the long-drawn case against the vice-chancellor for leged irregularities on the bench. Edward W. Wollmuth, executive vice-president of the Newark Chamber of Commerce, one of the three men who appeared yesterday before the Chancellor, said today that the group would announce this afternoon whom it had retained to represent it. Appearing with Mr. Wollmuth in Chancery Chambers, Jersey City, were Spencer D .\n\nBaldwin, Hackensack, committee chairman, and Curtiss A. Burnett, president of the American Oil Supply Company, Newark. As the committee's representatives they will seek to become an intervening party at the Jan. 27 hearing on an order to show cause why an investigation of Fallon's official should not be concluded, or why the Chancellor's order to authorize it should not be set aside or modified. As the pleadings now stand, the only parties to the hearing are the vice-chancellor and the New Jersey Bar Association .\n\nThe latter will appear with counsel to oppose an application Fallon has made to conclude the probe under Charles L. Carrick. When the hearing is declared open, Mr. Wollmuth said today, the Committee of 100's counsel will apply to become an \"intervening party.\" As such its argument, will be confined to arguing vice-chancellor's suspension. The Bar Association will confine its argument to opposing FalIon's application .\n\nThe committee's representatives yesterday based their petition on the American, Bar Ethics Association's which it Cannon adopted on recommendation of the late Chief Justice William Howard Taft. In that code it is argued that judge's official conduct should be free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety,\" that persons appointed by 8 judge to aid in administration of justice should \"be selected solely with to character and fitness. The of making Viewer such appointments should not be exercised by him for personal or party advantage,\" Testimony has been introduced in the Carrick hearings to indicate that Vice-Chancellor Fallon has infringed upon these ethics; that appointing recelvers has acted for the benefit of the receiver rather than for the bankrupt corporation. Since the vice-chancellor has not taken the witness stand in his own defense, preferring to issue a statement in writing and thus avoid cross examination, the committee petitioned that he should be suspended until his case is decided. In answer to Chancellor Campbell's argument that to act on the petition would be to prejudice the case, Mr .\n\nBaldwin recalled yesterday that the late Chancellor Walker had suspended Alonzo Church while similar charges were pending. The Chancellor's reply to the committee's double petition for suspension and for an extended scope in the Carrick investigation so that no doubt might exist about the admissibility of certain evidence, was; \"I cannot do that because the Court of Errors and Appeals may yet find that Chancellor Walker had no authority to allow the order as now constituted.
