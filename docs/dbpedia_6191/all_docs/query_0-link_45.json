        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\nThis book focuses on the rapidly changing sociology of music as manifested in Chinese society and Chinese education. It examines how social changes and cultural politics affect how music is currently being used in connection with the Chinese dream. While there is a growing trend toward incorporating the Chinese dream into school education and higher education, there has been no scholarly discussion to date. The combination of cultural politics, transformed authority relations, and officially approved songs can provide us with an understanding of the official content on the Chinese dream that is conveyed in today’s Chinese society, and how these factors have influenced the renewal of values-based education and practices in school music education in China.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nE-Book Information\n\nSeries: Cultural Studies and Transdisciplinarity in Education 7\n\nYear: 2,018\n\nEdition: 1\n\nPages: XXI, 256\n\nPages In File: 272\n\nLanguage: English\n\nIdentifier: 978-981-10-7532-2,978-981-10-7533-9\n\nDoi: 10.1007/978-981-10-7533-9\n\nOrg File Size: 3,562,142\n\nExtension: pdf\n\nTags: Sociology of Education\n\nToc: Front Matter ....Pages i-xxi\n\nIntroduction: Dreams, Culture, Politics of Memory, and Power in Education (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 1-24\n\nExhibiting the Past: The Politics of Nationalism, Historical Memory, and Memory Practices in China’s Culture and Education (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 25-53\n\nPower, Public Diplomacy, and Cultural Diplomacy in China’s Education: From Soft Power to the Chinese Dream (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 55-82\n\nPropaganda Songs in Music Education: Between Chinese Nationalism and Chinese Socialism (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 83-117\n\nThe Confucian Value of Harmony in Music Education in Relation to Songs (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 119-154\n\nThe Rise of Individualistic Values, Social Change, Popular Culture, and Depoliticization: Challenge to Music Education (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 155-193\n\nCritical Perspectives on Values Education in China’s School Music Education in a Changing Society: A Study of Beijing in the Global Age (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 195-232\n\nConclusion and Implications: Values and Practices in Achieving the Chinese Dream in School Music Education (Wai-Chung Ho)....Pages 233-250\n\nBack Matter ....Pages 251-256"
