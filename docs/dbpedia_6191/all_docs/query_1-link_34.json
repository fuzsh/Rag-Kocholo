The median age was 40.6 ± 12.8 (range, 18–70) years old, and 28 (90.3%) were female. The median tumor size was 18.2 ± 3.2 (range, 15–28) cm, and the median RENAL score was 8.2 ± 1.5. Seventeen out of 31 (54.8%) patients had a surgical kidney removal. Overall, 11 underwent 3D-assisted surgeries (3D group), and the other 20 underwent routine ones (control group). presents a summary of patients’ characteristics. Two groups showed no significant differences in terms of age, gender, ASA status, tumor size, side of treated, the ratio of prior SAE, and RENAL score.\n\nTable 1\n\nPatient Demographics3D group (n = 11)Control group (n = 20)p-valueAge (years), mean ± SD (range)38.9 ± 12.4 (23–64)41.5 ± 13.2 (18–70)>0.05Gender (male/female), n0/112/18>0.05ASA status (grade I/II/III), n1/8/21/13/6>0.05Body weight (kg), mean ± SD (range)56.6 ± 4.6 (51–65)55.8 ± 10.0 (44–77)>0.05Tumor size (cm), mean ± SD (range)18.0 ± 2.2 (15–22)18.3 ± 3.6 (15–28)>0.05Left/right, n6/511/9>0.05Prior SAE, n (%)2(18.2%)3(15%)*>0.05RENAL score, mean ± SD7.9 ± 1.48.5 ± 1.7**>0.05\n\ndisplays four parameters based on DL segmented image.

However, patients in the 3D group experienced a relatively longer operative time (240.0 ± 78.6 vs. 194.1 ± 84.5 min), a greater EBL (654.5 ± 393.4 vs. 324.0 ± 299.0 ml), a larger postoperative change in hemoglobin (−28.1 ± 23.9 vs. −1.5 ± 17.3 g/L), and a higher postoperative morbidity (72.7% vs. 30.0%). Grade I/II/III/IV postoperative complications due to Clavien–Dindo in 3D and control groups were 2/7/0/1 and 4/2/1/0, respectively. No significant differences in the rate of intraoperative RBC transfusion, the time of drainage tube removal, and the length of hospital stay.\n\nTable 3\n\nVariable3D group (n = 11)Control group (n = 20)p-valueSuccess rate of PN, n (%)8 (72.7%)6 (30.0%)<0.05Operation time (min), mean ± SD240.0 ± 78.6194.1 ± 84.5>0.05Estimated blood loss654.5 ± 393.4324.0 ± 299.0<0.05Intraoperative complications, n (%)2 (18.2%)0 (0.0%)>0.05 Collecting system injury, n (%)1 (9.1%) Pancreas injury, n (%)1 (9.1%)Intraoperative RBC transfusion, n (%)10 (90.9%)14 (70%)>0.05Postoperative change in hemoglobin (g/L), mean ± SD−28.1 ± 23.9−1.5 ± 17.3*<0.05Postoperative change in eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2), mean ± SD21.0 ± 32.825.6 ± 18.0**>0.05Postoperative complications, n (%)***8 (72.7%)6 (30.0%)<0.05 Postoperative RBC transfusion (grade 2)72 Emesis (grade 1)1 Fever (grade 1)11 Pain (grade 1)12 Hydrothorax (grade 3)1 Respiratory failure (grade 4)1Time of drainage tube removal (days), mean ± SD6.6 ± 2.46.6 ± 2.6>0.05Hospital stay (days), mean ± SD15.2 ± 4.416.2 ± 5.6>0.05\n\nshows a subgroup analysis of eight and six PN patients in 3D and control groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between these two subgroups, except for postoperative change in hemoglobin. However, patients with 3D-assisted PN had a slightly larger tumor (18.1 ± 2.3 vs. 16.9 ± 2.5 cm) and higher RENAL score (7.8 ± 1.5 vs. 6.7 ± 1.2), possibly contributing to a relatively higher rate of complications (75.0% vs. 33.3%). Instead, 3D-assisted PN lead to a shorter WIT (23.1 ± 10.6 vs. 27.5 ± 2.4 min) and a lower renal function loss (14.8 ± 25.97 vs. 19.1 ± 20.0 ml/min/1.73 m2) without significant difference.\n\nTable 4\n\nVariablePN in 3D group (n = 8)PN in Control group (n = 6)p-valueAge (years), mean ± SD39.3 ± 14.043.8 ± 15.1>0.05Gender (male/female), n0/81/5>0.05Tumor size (cm), mean ± SD18.1 ± 2.316.9 ± 2.5>0.05Left/right, n4/43/3>0.05Prior SAE, n (%)0(0%)0(0%)>0.05RENAL score, mean ± SD7.8 ± 1.56.7 ± 1.2*>0.05Operation time (minutes), mean ± SD243.8 ± 91.7202.5 ± 88.1>0.05WIT (min), mean ± SD23.1 ± 10.627.5 ± 2.4>0.05Estimated blood loss650.0 ± 414.0375.0 ± 451.2>0.05Intraoperative complications, n (%)2 (22.2%)0 (0.0%)>0.05 Collecting system injury, n (%)1 (11.1%) Pancreas injury, n (%)1 (11.1%)Intraoperative RBC transfusion, n (%)8 (100.0%)5 (83.3%)>0.05Postoperative change in hemoglobin (g/L), mean ± SD−34.0 ± 21.8−6.5 ± 16.2<0.05Postoperative change in eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2), mean ± SD14.8 ± 25.9719.1 ± 20.0>0.05Postoperative complications, n (%)**6 (75.0%)2 (33.3%)>0.05 Bleeding requiring RBC transfusion (grade 2)51 Pain (grade 1)12 Respiratory failure (grade 4)1Time of drainage tube removal (days), mean ± SD6.5 ± 2.77.8 ± 2.8>0.05Hospital stay (days), mean ± SD14.8 ± 4.716.8 ± 3.7>0.05\n\nindicates a subgroup analysis between patients under 3D-assisted PN or 3D-assisted RN. Patients in each subgroup showed no statistically significant difference in demographics, perioperative parameters, and clinical outcomes. However, patients with 3D-assisted RN had a slightly higher RENAL score without significant difference. Particularly, the nearness of tumor to the second branch of renal artery was relatively shorter in 3D-assisted PN subgroup than that in 3D-assisted RN subgroup (4.7 ± 4.0 vs. 15.8 ± 8.0 mm), and the difference between them was close to significant (p = 0.05).\n\nTable 5\n\nVariablePN in 3D group (n = 8)RN in 3D group (n = 3)p-valueAge (years), mean ± SD39.3 ± 14.038.0 ± 9.5>0.05Gender (male/female), n0/80/3>0.05Tumor size (cm), mean ± SD18.1 ± 2.317.7 ± 2.0>0.05Left/right, n4/42/1>0.05Prior SAE, n (%)0 (0%)2 (66.7%)>0.05RENAL score, mean ± SD7.8 ± 1.58.3 ± 1.2>0.05Ratio of tumor volume/renal volume (%), mean ± SD705.9 ± 386.1642.2 ± 265.7>0.05Nearness of the tumor to collecting system (mm), mean ± SD8.9 ± 4.34.7 ± 1.2>0.05Nearness of tumor to the second branch of renal artery (mm), mean ± SD15.8 ± 8.04.7 ± 4.0=0.05Depth of tumor into renal parenchyma (mm), mean ± SD17.0 ± 13.014.0 ± 4.9>0.05Operation time (min), mean ± SD243.8 ± 91.7230 ± 36.1>0.05Estimated blood loss650.0 ± 414.0666.7 ± 416.3>0.05Intraoperative complications, n (%)2 (22.2%)0 (0%)>0.05 Collecting system injury, n (%)1 (11.1%) Pancreas injury, n (%)1 (11.1%)Intraoperative RBC transfusion, n (%)8 (100.0%)2 (66.7%)>0.05Postoperative change in hemoglobin (g/L), mean ± SD−34.0 ± 21.8−12.3 ± 26.1>0.05Postoperative change in eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2), mean ± SD14.8 ± 25.9737.8 ± 49.4>0.05Postoperative complications, n (%)*6 (75.0%)2 (66.7%)>0.05 Bleeding requiring RBC transfusion (grade 2)52 Fever (grade 1)1 Pain (grade 1)1 Respiratory failure (grade 4)1Time of drainage tube removal (days), mean ± SD6.5 ± 2.77.0 ± 2.0>0.05Hospital stay (days), mean ± SD14.8 ± 4.716.3 ± 4.2>0.05\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study presented one of the largest pooled analyses of giant (>15 cm) sporadic RAMLs and first highlighted the feasibility of the combination of DL and 3D printing techniques in the management of giant ones. Compared with traditional approaches, 3D visualized plus printed models could provide more detailed and precise information to facilitate surgical procedures and improve better outcomes. As shown by our results, a significant higher success rate of PN was made for giant RAMLs with the assistance of 3D models.\n\nSporadic RAMLs possess different clinical presentations and treatments in comparison to tuberous sclerosis ones (4). They commonly occur in middle age (40 years old) women (2, 3), as supported by our present findings. Sporadic ones commonly grow slowly, and those over 15 cm (named as “giant”) are infrequent (22). In our results, however, up to 8.3% of surgical cases could grow over 15 cm. Despite the benign nature, RAMLs still own the potential to cause life-threatening hemorrhage (23, 24). The risk of hemorrhage could increase with larger tumor size (4). Giant sporadic RAML has its own unique features as follows. Due to the extremely large size and volume, it could block the exposure of the tumor root and renal vessels, leave less space for operation, and cause severe perirenal adhesion and easy-touch bleeding (fragility) (2). A large incision is frequently necessitated to extract such huge tumor. Additionally, a RAML may exophytically grow in the retroperitoneum and closely mimic a liposarcoma due to the high fat content on a radiological image (25). These multiple factors challenge the optimum route for giant RAML treatments.\n\nCurrently, only a scarcity of studies documented the treatment outcomes in giant RAMLs (7–9). Giant ones are generally given individualized therapeutic algorithm like PN, RN, SAE, and ablation (1). Minimal invasive approaches are commonly the top priority for consideration, while several issues have limited their use. For instance, SAE appears to be an efficacious choice, but about 30% patients need secondary embolization, obviously increasing the medical burden (1, 4, 26). Ablation is optional but not always available in many medical settings, particularly in developing countries (1). Inadequate experience for giant RAMLs may contribute to the uncertainty around the effectiveness and value of these minimal interventions. Moreover, complete removal of tumor burden is commonly considered by patients. Therefore, PN is often recommended for larger RAMLs, but most treated ones have been reported below 10 cm according to two recent reviews (1, 2). RN is finally adopted due to the considerable challenges, rendering a higher rate of surgical kidney removal (27–32). It could be supported by our data that intraoperative kidney removal was performed in 54.8% of all giant RAML patients. This situation was worse in patients who underwent routine ones without 3D assistance. Of note, PN for giant ones appears to develop more complications, in particular bleeding risk. Intraoperative bleeding was commonly seen, and 24 of 31 (77.4%) patients required RBC transfusion. Postoperative RBC transfusion was also the most frequent complications in all 31 patients. In our study, 5 of 31patients performed a prior SAE. Based on our experience, SAE partly aided in intraoperative hemorrhage control but was limited to minimize the tumor volume. Thus, a novel approach is imperative to improve the rate of kidney salvage and facilitate the technically challenging PN for giant RAML management.\n\nAccumulating evidence has investigated the application of 3D printing technology to guide PN for renal mass treatment (10). Surgeons could greatly benefit from the 3D mold with a better knowledge of topographic anatomy and the spatial structure. However, 3D printing-assisted PN appears to be mostly implemented for renal tumor below 10 cm (19, 33). Up till now, there is yet no group specially using 3D printing for RAMLs management, especially those giant ones. Moreover, there still remains some limitations in 3D printing, such as imprecise measurement and redundant data presentation of targets (12). To overcome the limitations of 3D printing and obtain better outcomes, we first employed DL for the surgical treatment of giant RAMLs. As a subset of AI, DL is a data-driven algorithmic approach to mimic human intelligence in increasingly independent and sophisticated ways (13). At present, medical image analysis is the most successful applications of this burgeoning science in medicine. In terms of renal diseases, DL enables to autonomically classify renal mass, differentiate tumor grades, evaluate acute kidney injury, and so on (14). Three main DL methods are commonly applied for medical imaging synthesis including auto‐encoder, generative adversarial network, and U‐net. The U-net method is the most adopted one (18). In this work, we applied a novel path called nnU-Net to extract subtle information from CT images and facilitate surgical procedures. Developed by Isensee et al., nnU-Net is an autosegmentation framework with removal of manual steps in data processing and network engineering (16, 17). DL-based 3D segmentation is capable of quantitatively characterizing RAMLs and their host kidneys. As mentioned in Methods, we calculated four parameters of interest, including the volume ratio and three shortest distances named D.N.N: (1) the volume ratio is mainly to evaluate the value of PN surgery; (2) the (D)epth of tumor into renal parenchyma is to decide the depth for dissection; (3) the (N)earness of the tumor to collecting system is to assess the risk of perforation to collecting system; and (4) the (N)earness of tumor to the second branch of renal artery is to guide artery clamping and avoid artery damage.\n\nWith the help of combination of DL-based 3D segmentation and 3D printed mold, PN appears to be easier to perform than before, leading to a higher success rate of PN for giant RAMLs. In our study, 72.7% patients in 3D group successfully underwent PN surgery, which was only 30% in control group. Yet, patients in the 3D group experienced a slightly longer operative time and a higher postoperative morbidity, especially the blood transfusion requirement. A plausible explanation is that more PN surgeries have performed in 3D group, and the resection of such giant tumor is highly complicated and challengeable. Subgroup analysis ( ) indicated a relatively shorter WIT and a higher eGFR preservation rate in patients undergoing 3D-assisted PN when compared with those undergoing routine PN. However, patients with 3D-assisted PN had a slightly larger tumor and higher RENAL score, possibly contributing to a relatively higher rate of complications. As mentioned above, giant RAMLs often adhere to surrounding structures and cause uncontrolled bleeding. A larger surgical field is commonly needed to dissect the tumor, leading to an increased risk of perioperative bleeding. Therefore, these factors could contribute to a longer operation time and more perioperative complications. It was consistent with the study of Patard et al., which revealed that intra- and postoperative PN morbidity were significantly increased with larger tumor size (34). However, the high rate of postoperative morbidity appeared to be acceptable because the most one was just requiring short-term blood transfusion. Moreover, another subgroup analysis ( ) demonstrated that 3D-assisted PN unfortunately failed in three patients. The reasons for the failure of PN in 3D group appeared to be multifactorial, possibly due in part to the intraoperative difficulty of PN. RAMLs in patients with failed 3D-assisted PN owned a relatively higher RENAL score and were relatively closer to the collecting system and to the second branch of renal artery, respectively. Despite this fact, the success rate of PN became higher under the help of 3D models. Additionally, 3D visualized and printed models could aid preoperative counseling to help patients understand about their disease, surgical plan, and risks. In this scenario, patients appear to be more willing to accept PN surgery instead of RN. The confidence may be also enhanced to surgeons to perform PN. Taken together, the combination of DL and 3D printing could serve as an extra tool to improve surgical outcomes in giant RAML management.\n\nNotably, 3D visualization techniques hold a promising future in the surgical field of urology. They have several advantages over the current 3D printing techniques, such as waiving the cost of time and fee to print physical models. They could provide more precise information of anatomical structure in the operative area and reliably guide preoperative plan design. Consistent with our present study, some other 3D visualization techniques have recently been introduced to the field of urology and achieved impressive outcomes. For instance, Porpiglia et al. presented an innovative approach for preoperative planning to facilitate PN for complex tumors by adopting 3D augmented reality (3D-AR) systems (35). This 3D-AR approach could improve the percentage of cases with selective clamping of second-order arteries and the rate of tumor enucleation, contributing to the technical refinement of robotic-assisted PN. Wake and colleagues also reported similar 3D-AR methods to provide preoperative guidance for robotic PN (36). Additionally, Wang et al. previously applied 3D visualization technology in laparoscopic PN to achieve an accurate visible image-guided tumor resection with ideal renal function preservation (37). Therefore, the state-of-the-art 3D visualization methods open promising avenues to facilitate surgery procedures for complex renal tumors.\n\nDespite the strengths of this study, certain limitations should be addressed, including the retrospective nature, the limited size of the total population, and some parts of missing data. We only recruited 31 giant RAMLs out of 372 patients for analysis, partly reducing the confidence power. Additionally, we just evaluated perioperative hospital complications for a short follow-up period. Surgical outcomes, particular in controls, were based on several well-skilled surgeons during a period of time. This might affect surgical morbidity and the success rate of PN. Given the limited number of patients, we did not take this variable into account. Moreover, we estimated the feasibility and effectiveness by combing DL-based segmentation with 3D printing. How the superior performance of solo DL segmentation remains unclear and needs to be explored further. The consistency between DL-based segmentation and CT images was not conducted. A measuring error may exist when measuring the depth of tumor into renal parenchyma, partly due to the miss of actual margin of tumor-affected kidney. However, our present study is one of the largest pooled analyses of giant RAMLs and first introduces the combination of DL and 3D printing for renal tumor surgery. All the patients selected presented with >15 cm RAML, which may add value to the relatively small sample size. It provides valuable information that can be used when discussing treatment options for patients with giant RAML."
