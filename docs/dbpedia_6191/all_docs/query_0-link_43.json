The conference series, generously funded by the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange, Taipei, is part of the “International Project on Chinese and Comparative Historiography”, initiated by Thomas H. C. Lee (City College of New York, CCNY) and supported by the City College of New York, the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel, the Kulturwissenschaftliches Institut, Essen, and the National Taiwan University, Taibei.1 This conference series was planned as a new kind of comparative approach which stresses the need to study historiography and historical thinking in the form of an intercultural dialogue. A promising start in this direction was made about ten years ago and has now been made available in published form.2 As historical memory substantially contributes to the shaping of human beings’ identity— the identity of individuals as well as of communities and nations— such an intercultural dialogue naturally moves beyond the narrowly circumscribed arena of academic studies. It converges with a wider intercultural discourse which is unanimously being advocated to avoid the much-discussed “clash of civilizations”. Our project gained an unwanted, gruesome actuality from the terrorist attacks of September 11, some three weeks before the Wolfenbüttel conference. Considering the uncertainties of air travel in 1 For information on the setting up of this international project in 1996 and its activities since, see the website www.chinesehistoriography.com developed by the City College of the New York Asian Studies Program. 2 Rüsen 2002. It should be noted that this attempt concurred with other similar attempts aimed at broadening the intercultural approach in the study of historiography and historical thinking such as, e.g., Fuchs and Stuchtey 2002 and, with the focus on Chinese historiography and historical thinking, Schneider and Weigelin-Schwiedrzik 1996; Wei Gelin and Shi Naide 1999; Wang and Iggers 2002. Presently, the most ambitious undertaking in the field of comparative historiography is the establishment of the new Brill on-line journal Historiography East and West, jointly edited by Susanne Weigelin-Schwiedrzik and Axel Schneider.\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe days thereafter, it was an astonishing event in itself that a sizeable group of Chinese and Western scholars eventually gathered at the Herzog August Bibliothek to meet in the hall of the library, which houses a famous historical Bible collection. 3 As conveners of the conference, we want to express our hearty gratitude to Professor Emeritus Yü Ying-shih (Princeton University) and his wife, who did not hesitate to make the trip to Germany and take part in the conference, Professor Yü chairing and greatly inspiring our discussions as the most senior scholar there. Although the cruel reality of those horrible events cast a shadow over the conference, it showed us to be united in holding with passion and assurance to the idea of an intercultural dialogue,4 which cannot tame a bursting world, but appears to be the most suitable alternative to the ancient Chinese vision of the sage-emperor Shun’s စ playing the zither and singing the “Air of the South” (“Nanfeng” তଅ) in order to bring into consonance the cosmic forces in chaos. The original purpose of the Wolfenbüttel Conference was to discuss the two broad topics of “ideology” and “historical criticism”. These two topics relate to the political and cognitive dimensions of our historical mind, respectively. 5 In preparing the conference, however, it became more and more clear that these two large topics are closely linked to each other by the question of historical truth. Here then we were confronted with yet another major issue. Although often not treated explicitly, the question of truth is rightly said to lie at the core of historical thinking and historiography in any historiographic tradition. To be ignorant of it makes us less able to understand the multifaceted relationship between the political and cognitive dimensions of historical consciousness. What is specifically Chinese about this particular relationship, compared to the Western, or any other non-Western, historiographic tradition? And how did it evolve in the Chinese historiographic tradition?\n\n3\n\nWe regret that because of problems with air travel in the wake of September 11, professors Vinay Lal (University of California, Los Angeles) and Brian Moloughney (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand) were forced to cancel their trips to Germany. 4 For a report on the conference, see Lee 2002. 5 For the distinction of the five dimensions of historical consciousness—the semantic, cognitive, aesthetic, rhetorical, and political dimensions—see Rüsen 2001: 62-66.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nTo highlight the scope of these questions, let us once again glance at an often discussed and highly puzzling instance of Chinese historical criticism, which concerns one—perhaps the best known one—of Confucius’s comments contained in the Zuozhuan ؐ ႚ . 6 In his comment, Confucius praises the court historiographer Dong Hu ᇀध as an excellent historian, although the latter’s entry concerning the assassination of Duke Ling ᨋֆ of Jin வ in 607 B.C. conceals, or deliberately misrepresents, the facts of what had actually happened. Confucius’s comment is indeed bewildering. As Burton Watson has put it: “If the Gospels have their dark sayings, we must perhaps admit that this remark of Confucius represents one of the dark sayings of the Tso chuan [Zuozhuan], an utterance that will never be completely comprehensible to the modern reader.”7 This is hardly an enthusiastic encouragement to ponder the concept of truth and objectivity in Chinese historiography. Yet there are two points which may add a new motivation for rethinking the passage in question and reveal the enormous instructive potential of this foremost case of Chinese historical comment. Firstly, it is important to note that Confucius’s comment resulted not only in affirming Dong Hu’s moralizing viewpoint, but also in privileging the Zuozhuan account of the whole affair over the versions contained in the other two early commentaries to the Spring and Autumn Annals ਞટ, the Gongyang Zhuan ֆ‫ے‬ႚ, and the Guliang Zhuan ᒜඩႚ. Apart from some minor differences, the latter both lack a narrative element which is essential to the Zuozhuan version and to Confucius’s comment as well, namely Zhao Dun’s ᎓ એ , attempt to flee across the border. 8 This suggests that historical criticism in China does not necessarily function as an agency of\n\n6\n\nIn Chinese historiography these comments, along with similar comments in the Zuozhuan marked by the opening phrase “the Gentleman remarks” (junzi yue ‫ܩ‬՗ֳ), represent the earliest stock of commentarial and reflective remarks separated from the narration; see Henry 1999 and David Schaberg’s article in this volume. 7 Watson 1989: 80. 8 With this dramatizing element of the flight across the border, the Zuozhuan makes use of a motif which recurs prominently in the Shiji biographies of Shang Yang ೸Ꮓ and the Lord of Mengchang ࡯ቫ‫ܩ‬, see Yang and Yang 1979: 135, 137, and 157, 159. Whereas the Gongyang Zhuan is silent about Zhao Dun’s progress after departing from the Jin capital, we are briefly told in the Guliang Zhuan that he came not further than to the suburban area of the Jin capital (jiao ૳), which was still at least a two days’ journey from the next border. See Gongyang Zhuan, Xuan 2nd year, 15.2280a; Guliang Zhuan, Xuan 2nd year, 12.2412b.\n\nxiv\n\nPREFACE\n\nquestioning, doubt, and revision, but on the contrary might even authenticate or privilege a certain historical account.9 Secondly, Dong Hu’s entry in the court annals, though traditionally lauded as “a record which does not conceal anything” (shufa bu yin ஼ ऄլឆ), was not made sine ira et studio, but ostensibly with certain political motives. 10 Moreover, we should not forget its deadly consequences. Only ten years later, when Zhao Dun had already died, a former favorite of Duke Ling used Dong Hu’s vicious record to instigate the military to raid the Zhao clan. In the ensuing massacre, almost the entire clan was wiped out; the family survived thanks only to a posthumously born child. 11 This is the plot of a play which through Voltaire’s L’Orphelin de la Chine has become part of world literature. In short, the case of Dong Hu’s record demonstrates par excellence the thin borderline between historiography and ideology in the Chinese historiographic tradition. Yet in studying historical comment and historical criticism in China, we will find that the uncovering of ideological implications, purposeful distortions, and opinionated and biased views, is meaningless apart from a background of historical truth to judge them by. This explains the decision to enlarge the original scope of the conference by adding a section on “Historical Truth”, with which this essay collection begins. Due to the nature of this topic, three of this section’s five China-related articles deal with Chinese historiography and historical thinking in ancient China—the “inner” essays by Martin Kern, Heiner Roetz, and Stephen Durrant. The two “outer” essays by Wolfgang Behr and Helwig Schmidt-Glintzer, however, make it clear that the question of truth was relevant throughout Chinese history. This is followed by a section on “Historical Comment and Historical Criticism”, as the central part of the present volume. Here too, three articles focus on China’s early historical works, in particular the two commentaries to the Spring and Autumn Annals, the Zuozhuan 9\n\nMichael Quirin has lucidly pointed to this function of textual and historical criticism in China, albeit with regard to the Chinese canon and the Chinese exegetical tradition: “The aim of these critical tendencies did not, and could not, lie in the elimination of the indispensable reference to the canon, but on the contrary it lies in its preservation through bridging the cracks in the continuity and homogeneity of tradition” [our translation]; see Quirin 1999: 25. 10 Again, from the account in Zuozhuan, Xuan 2nd Year, 21.1867b, we learn that Dong Hu himself made his record public at court. By so doing, he grossly interfered in the process of selecting and installing a successor to Duke Ling. 11 See Shiji 43.1782-1785.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxv\n\nand the Gongyang Zhuan—the essays by David Schaberg, Yuri Pines, and Joachim Gentz. This section concludes with Thomas H. C. Lee’s analysis of Hong Mai’s ੋᝬ (1123-1202) attitude and standards for selecting historical materials in his massive Yijian Zhi ‫ ڎ‬ഒ ‫ݳ‬ (Records of Yijian). It takes us down to the Song ‫ ݚ‬period (9601279), which must be viewed as a major era of Chinese historical thinking.12 Special mention is due to Kai Vogelsang’s essay, which stands out from all other articles in this volume in that it takes an explicitly comparative approach, comparing the underlying concept and the use of historical judgment in the Chinese and Western historiographic traditions. Different from the first two sections, the third and last section, “At the Threshold of Modernity and Beyond: Historical Truth, the Historian’s Trustworthiness, and Ideology”, deals with the early modern and modern period, focusing on a problem that is ostensibly specific to this period: it witnessed an increasingly sophisticated research methodology aimed at achieving historical objectivity, but at the same time historiography seems to have become more and more prone to ideological misuse. If this is the case for the West, then how about China? Chow Kai-Wing and Marion Eggert discuss the underlying problem of the tension between history and ideology with regard to the rise of “evidential research” (kaozheng ‫ ە‬ᢞ ) in eighteenth-century China and Korea. Next, Achim Mittag indicates that this development was paired with a growing awareness of the problem of the historian’s trustworthiness. The following two articles by Susanne Weigelin-Schwiedrzik and Nicola Spakowski follow the line down to the second half of the twentieth century, discussing the existing tension between historical truth and ideology in the field of Chinese Marxist historiography and didactics of history teaching in the PRC. It was clear from the outset that three such broad topics could not be studied in a comprehensive way and we are well aware of significant lacunae in each of the three sections.13 We want to remind 12\n\nSee Lee 2004. In particular, this concerns the great advance in historical criticism which is connected with the Song statesman and scholar Sima Guang ‫್׹‬٠ (1019-1086). Regrettably, Professor Ji Xiao-bin (University of Rutgers, Camden, NJ), a leading expert on this particular topic, was prevented from joining the conference, but he kindly sent us a first draft of his paper entitled “Sima Guang’s (1019-1086) Kaoyi as a Paradigm of Chinese Historical Criticism? A Preliminary Investigation of the Use of 13\n\nxvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe reader that the emphasis lays upon the intercultural comparison. This, however, did not place an individual researcher or discussant under the strain of taking a comparative approach; rather, he or she was only required to present his or her piece of scholarly work in such a way that it enhances the intended intercultural dialogue. During the conference, we did take a good step forward along the path of such a dialogue. Yet this blissful moment can hardly be documented in a collection of the papers presented, however carefully they were later revised and amended. To retain the comparative aspect in some way we chose to include one essay in each of the three sections, in which the respective topic is explored from a non-Chinese perspective—the essays by Petra Bahr, Jörn Rüsen, and Horst Walter Blanke. We regret that the focus of all these three essays heading each section is on the Western historiographic tradition, but this shortcoming is to some extent compensated for by the rather highly theoretical level of discussion in each of these theme-setting essays. Within the three sections the articles are loosely arranged according to the chronological order of the subject matter treated. We owe sincere thanks to many friends and colleagues, in the first place to the contributors of this volume, but also to those who presented papers, which, on the authors’ explicit wishes, were not included in this volume—Jochen Martin (Freiburg University), Gert Melville (Dresden University), and Monika Übelhör (Marburg University). We further wish to thank Mechthild Leutner (Free University, Berlin) and Hans van Ess (Munich University) for their thoughtful comments on the papers by Susanne Weigelin-Schwiedrzik and Nicola Spakowski, and Stephen Durrant, respectively. Also we would like to extend our thanks to all other participants who by their enthusiastic engagement in our discussions made the conference into a memorable academic event—Ludwig Ammann (Freiburg), Maria\n\nSources in Zizhi Tongjian”.

These two traditions share a very important idea, which has deeply marked occidental thinking: that the divine is bound to contingency through the medium of historical revelation. Therefore, with this understanding of history, not only did it develop the meaning of the history of salvation or its opposite, but history also became the place where religious claims of truth had to be proven. The main theological images which embody the idea that the divine is bound to contingency through historical revelation are well known. In Judaism there is the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, while Christianity speaks of God’s incarnation in Jesus Christ. As a consequence of this prevailing theological understanding of history, the rise of modern historical thinking and subsequently the establishment of historical criticism were not in opposition to theology. Historical thinking was developed within Western theology and became the “model of reflection” for Western religion. The theological idea that the divine is bound to contingency led to the western perspective on history: because the contingency of life is seen in the light of divine truth, truth and meaning have to be found in history. This method of deriving meaning and truth by connecting contingency with the divine, the absolute, has shaped modern secular historicism and its theories even after the church lost its absolute authority regarding the interpretation of history. But even though religious tradition and historical method share the same foundation, the historical method started to undermine the absolute exegetic authority of the religious tradition by being the “model of reflection”. In the following, I would like to exemplify the changing configurations of religious claims of truth and critical historical method in the development of Bible criticism as a distinct form of historical critique. This will be done from the perspective of the history of science.\n\n2\n\nPETRA BAHR\n\nIn 1440, the humanist scholar Laurentio Valla published the paper De falso credita et ementita Constantini donatione declamatio. 1 In this paper, Valla proved the so-called “Donation of Konstantin” to be a fake. This text was a legal contract, which—belonging as it did to the canon of the church—established the secular sovereignty of the Pope over Italy and is therefore part of the religious tradition in a broader sense. The text in which Valla’s disclosure occurs is an index and a medium of change within the theory of history. Valla himself became a symbol of the modern relationship between historical criticism and religious meaning, because every aspect of this relationship could be found in his paper.\n\n1. The Development of Methods in Historical Criticism Valla set out to overcome the medieval paradigm of ars critica by establishing a new type of modern critique, which is orientated along the lines of libertas iudicandi. He went beyond the rules of the rhetorical doctrine of imitatio and therefore asked for the inner appropriateness and immanent coherence of a text. By taking the humanistic understanding of rhetoric into account and by accepting that sapientia and eloquentia both stem from the same origin, his technique became much more analytical and philological: it developed into an empirical method. Since this method operates by clearly articulated rules and thereby provides defined criteria for the process of historical research, we can speak of the understanding of scholarship as having changed.\n\n2. The Monopolization of the sensus historicus The process of the “epistemization of the techné”2 is completed in the Cartesian ideal of methods and corresponds to the dismissal of the medieval strategy of deriving meaning: the quadruple meaning of a text. The sensus literalis or sensus historicus takes the place of Allegoresis, the former exegetical method, and searches for the literal meaning of a text, which corresponds to the historical way of thinking that asks for the facts. It was chiefly Jewish scholars of the medieval 1 2\n\nSetz 1975. Feger 1993: 200.\n\nCLAIMS OF TRUTH\n\n3\n\nperiod, such as Moses ben Maimon, who showed how the validity of a meaning is tied to its genesis by looking at the historization and contextualization of biblical traditions or records in Talmudic commentaries, who paved the way for this process. Laurentio Valla demonstrates this altered understanding of history. He turns a legend of foundation within the frame of church historiography into a historical source and a mythological tale of the origin into a historical date. In Vallas point of view, the historia rerum gestarum is now to be found on the difficult path to the res gestae. Consequently, facticity and authenticity become the criteria for claims of truth. The consequence of Vallas thinking is clear: the historical reliability of a text becomes the crucial problem. Texts are now to be examined with regard to the coherence of their content, their age has to be ascertained and their authors identified and verified. Yet such an examination of a text that is part of the canon of a religious tradition means that questions asked of history had started to move in a different direction.\n\n3. Historical Criticism for the Sake of the True Religion Valla relates his “historical dissecting exercises” (Nietzsche) to a crucial aspect of scientific truth. However, this understanding of truth, which is based on objective and general valid criteria of proof, does not go along with the absolute authority of the church. Valla’s academic curiositas starts to intermingle with an ideological and political strategy: he claims to expend all his critical efforts only for the sake of the true religion. This emphatic formula used by the scholar who enacts his methods in order to save religion from its own obstructions and distortions marks the beginnings of the historical critical examination of sources. It is by means of this that historical criticism became the main medium for the criticism of ideology—and sometimes amounts to a religion itself.\n\n4. “Ad fontes!” — Ratio versus Auctoritas The critical examination to which Valla subjects his sources in the end destroys the meaning of the text. According to his conclusion, something that is disclosed as a lie can no longer be part of the foundation\n\n4\n\nPETRA BAHR\n\nof religion. The ambivalent imperative “ad fontes!” did not only lead to an appeal from scholars engaged in early Bible and dogma criticism to study the biblical text in their original languages as opposed to the Vulgate. Even the holy text itself is reviewed for copying mistakes and is subjected to attempts to verify its authorship and to determine its age. Valla himself provides extensive examinations of the New Testament. Another consequence of the imperative “ad fontes!” is the revolutionary insight that the holy text came into being through the process of writing. Hence, the unified text as the origin of the coherent religious claim of truth started to fall apart into a process of literary, compilation and editorial work, and was therefore proved to be of various origins. By removing all accretions on the Prima Vista text of the tradition and taking away the layers of dogmatism, the holiness of the text itself is destroyed. A text which is checked out by historical—methodological rationality does not guarantee eo ipso religious truth but has destroyed the religious meaning in the first place. The modern achievement of the critical method is highly ambivalent: meaning and text, truth and history are falling apart, and it becomes a problem to reconnect them. The reformer Martin Luther, whose programmatical sola scriptura pushed Bible criticism to become an independent academic discipline in Protestant faculties, saw that religious truth and biblical truth were drifting apart from each other. The insight into the emergence of the holy text as a process of being written down correlates to a difference between text and meaning to begin with, because a religious insight had to be the initial reason for writing theological ideas down in the first place. At least, this was the reasoning of the early modern scholars. “Dua res sunt Deus et scriptura Dei, non minus quam duae res sunt creator et creatura dei”.3 Holy writing and living word of God, letter and spirit, law and evangelism—the Reformation took these guiding differences into account in order to connect the right of historical criticism to the duty of the theological determination of truth. By now, the Holy Spirit became the medium of hermeneutics that mediates historical text and meaning, history and revelation in a dynamic manner. “Verbum est organum, quo spiritus sui 3\n\nLuther 1908: 606.\n\nCLAIMS OF TRUTH\n\n5\n\nilluminationem fidelibus dominus dispensat.” 4 This change is very important to the history of science, because the Protestant idea of inspiration does not only apply to the divine inspiration of the biblical author, but includes also the reader and scholar of the text: The biblical truth manifests itself in the process of being read by a believing subject. Luther called this theory of the acquisition of religious meaning “fides creatrix”. Lutheran orthodoxy does not carry this idea any further. With their teachings about inspiration, the Lutherans placed their hope in the “self immunization” of theology against the dynamic of the academic research that broke loose within their own faculties. Yet the idea of the Holy Spirit as mediator arises anew at the end of the eighteenth century. Pneumatology develops into the idea of the scientific genius: The mind of the scholar becomes the motor of his power of judgement, the investigation of the truth within the contingency becomes a matter of the creative individual and the fides creatrix develops into the belief in the inventive power of the methods used. It is therefore the individual that vouches for the discovery of religious truth in the contingent truth of the history handed down to him. Thus, the fides creatrix turns into hermeneutics. It was Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher who founded modern hermeneutics at the beginning of the nineteenth century, not, as Dilthey and Heidegger mistakenly believed, as the first philosophy, but as an academic approach to dealing with the New Testament. According to the “Luther redivivus” Schleiermacher, hermeneutics and criticism are inseparably interreferential.5 This development is the outcome of a process of finding various answers to the problem of how to deal with the breaking of the spell of the holy texts through their critical examination. The prevailing suggestions from the time of the early Enlightenment were made by three radical Bible critics: Baruch Spinoza, Richard Simon and Immanuel Kant. They brought the “crisis of exegetics” to a head by at the same time showing solutions for the problematical dialectic of processing the critical method. These solutions prevailed until the late eighteenth century.\n\n4 5\n\nCalvin 1955: 84. Nowak 2001: 493; Richardson and Lawler 1998.\n\n6\n\nPETRA BAHR\n\n5. Baruch de Spinoza: Historical Criticism as (the Search for) a Religion of Reason Spinoza, whose “partisanship for the secular world” (Yovel) becomes the herald of modernity in the middle of the seventeenth century, draws a radical conclusion in the chapter “On Exegetics of the Bible” in his Tractatus theologico politicus: Religious claims of truth cannot be bound to methodically, and critically examined facts at all but only to human reason, because human reason determines the way a text is looked at. Religious truth, being detached from the historical facts handed down, becomes part of the universal validity and fundamental nature of reason. Out of the historical sources emerges the essence of religion: an unchangeable, trans-historical religion of reason. 6 For Spinoza, the methods of Bible exegetics are in accordance with the methods of explaining nature. The absolute metaphor of the “book of nature” to which Spinoza refers shows the change that happened here. The universal laws of man are to be obtained from the biblical and church traditions through historical criticism. The historical method functions as a tool to remove the historical truth of the religion in order to find the intelligible core, which reflects itself in the laws of morality. Moreover, the rationality of the methodical and critical process reflects even the religion of reason. And, a step further, the religion of reason reflects itself in the religion of morality. Hence, the prejudice that the Enlightenment was deeply un-historical in its way of thinking cannot be confirmed, because the religion of reason itself becomes historical by realizing itself as the law of morality.\n\n6. Richard Simon: The Institutionalised Separation of Religious Truth and Scientific Rationality Richard Simon caused a great stir in 1678 when he published his groundbreaking study of the Old Testament, “Histoire Critique du Vieux Testament”. From Simon’s perspective, the Old Testament is nothing but a loose collection of fragments of writing, which are the result of a long historical process of literary work. His radical criticism is accompanied by a remarkable opinion: He demands of the scholars who work on historical sources that they refrain from their 6\n\nSpinoza 1670: 113.\n\nCLAIMS OF TRUTH\n\n7\n\nsearch for religious meaning. According to Simon the defence of religious claims of truth is a matter of the institution of the church, not the task of a scholar.7 But even though Simon claimed to separate the task of searching for truth from that of criticism to guarantee the power of the church to teach and to lecture against the Protestant principle of historical exegesis, he was expelled from his order. It is possible that his opponents understood the consequences of his claim better than he did. By demanding abstinence concerning the derivation of meaning, his historical-critical rationality itself is loaded with religious meaning. What according to this model, results from the unresolved discrepancy between historical facts and religious claims of truth is the differentiation of various types of truth, which are tied to institutions. Church and science, religious and academic efforts taking care of meaning, are now on separate paths. It was precisely this differentiation which became established during the Enlightenment, despite the efforts made to hold research together into historical sources and the search for truth through the religion of reason. Even in the theological faculties the permeability between the historical-exegetical and the dogmatic subjects diminished. At the same time, the results of the historical criticism attracted great public attention. During the eighteenth century, the argument about the legitimacy and consequences of historical criticism was enacted in a way that had considerable public appeal and a great effect on publishing. Apologetics and criticism were sharpening their weapons and eyeing each other.\n\n7. Scepticism and the New Religion of Reason While German academia was still seeking a peaceful agreement with the religion of reason, criticism triumphed over apologetics in France. The religion of reason developed through the dispute over a reasonable religion. As a consequence, the destruction of the holy texts only leaves intellectual scepticism or apologetic atheism. The littérature clandestine hands down a canon of texts, which puts the historical method at the service of the new worldview. Reason is assigned the job of a “controlleuse generale” and controls religious 7\n\nGraf Reventlow 1980: 11; Kraus 1988: 61.\n\n8\n\nPETRA BAHR\n\ntraditions. Thus reason replaces the teaching of the church and the dogmatic guiding principles of exegetics. For the sake of the new religion of man, the old religion has to be dressed up as deceit on the part of the priests and as monumental architecture of lies, nothing more than an instrument of political demagogy. The founder of religion is the impostator sacrilegus. What remains of him is considered to be merely a collection of faked documents and relicts.8 All these theories have the radical debasement of positive religion in common. The most radical form of debasement can be found in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. According to him, the “noumenon” of religion becomes a function of morality and thereby loses its substantial character. The new religion of man doesn’t need holy books, rites and a cultus any more. However, this development changes direction around 1800. On the one hand, the growing interest in the history of religion accompanies the research into historical sources. The historical critical method is no longer used only for the canon of the holy text. Thus, a critical rewriting of the own religion as a part of culture arises. The historical methods are now applied to other documents and evidence of the past: the modern historical scholarship is becoming established.9 This process is paralleled by the new discovery of the sources of other religions. The basis of historical research is enlarged by ethnological and archaeological material, and, at the same time, the understanding of truth becomes subject to the revolution of the philosophy of subjectivity. Now, truth is first subjectified and then historicized. This has consequences for historical criticism.10 Johann Gottfried Herder, and before him, unnoticed by his contemporaries, Giambattista Vico, had already started the changes in historical research into sources by discovering the religious protolanguage of man in poetry. Herder, the most famous man of the church during the age of Goethe, in his text “Älteste Urkunde des Menschengeschlechts” (1774/76) protected the book of Genesis against rationalistic ridicule by proving its poetic character. 11 Thus esthetical criticism liberates the understanding of the biblical text from 8\n\nSchröder 1998: 395. Kippenberg 1997. Murrmann-Kahl 1992: 145. 11 Bultmann 1999: 17. 9\n\n10\n\nCLAIMS OF TRUTH\n\n9\n\nthe dogmatism of ecclesiastical teaching and from the reductionism of historical critical rationality. In this way, the historical rationality is not undermined but enriched by different rationalities. The theory of culture of Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher can be seen as a paradigm for various perspectives of the world. As theologian and philosopher he established an independent understanding of religious meaning for a scornful audience in his “Reden über die Religion an die Gebildeten unter ihren Verächtern”, an understanding which is disconnected from both morality and metaphysics.12 In this way, he set the course for the modern theory of religion. Religion as an independent symbolic form of meaning is now defined as a pre-predicative constituting element of the individual—and religious truth gains a subjective meaning. Religious experience manifests itself in an endless line of symbolic manifestations. The infinite cannot be defined beyond its historical manifestations as a set of predicative true sentences. “The infinite is represented in the finite”, writes Schleiermacher, using early romantic emphasis. For Schleiermacher, the human being Jesus is the original of the historical manifestation of the infinite. The manifestations and representations of religious experience, including the biblical sources, are representing this experience only ex post. To Schleiermacher, there is no longer any absolute valid canon of religious texts. The religious experience as an individual experience of the absolute disappears in its witnessing. Individual belief and objective religion are dissociated. Everybody should write his or her own evangelism. History and the individual reveal the endless variety of representations of the infinite within the finite. Hence, history and the historical individual are the most important matters of religion. During the nineteenth century the history of religion develops into a religion of history. Strategies for the development of the theory of a religion of history were also becoming religious. God’s incarnation as man seemed to be repeated under the conditions of modernity. The theoretical end of the tendency to write history in a religious way according to the methods outlined above was initiated by Franz Overbeck, a theologian and philologist from Basel who is known as a colleague and friend of Nietzsche. In agreement with him, Karl Barth, the theologian who had the greatest effect on the twentieth century, claims in his exegetics of the “Römerbrief”: “The historian-critics 12\n\nSchleiermacher 1799.\n\n10\n\nPETRA BAHR\n\nhave to be more critical!” 13 Following the same line as Overbeck, Barth proclaimed the radical break between revelation and history. Overbeck’s basic theme had been the Nietzscheian “Advantages and Disadvantages of History for Life”. Overbeck revolted against the icons which modern history worshipped during the nineteenth century. His concept of the “original history”, which he published disguised as a study on the development of the New Testament canon, reads as a blasphemy against bourgeois historical religion. Overbeck radicalises the results of the historical criticism of sources and the history of religion and claims that Christianity lost religious truth at the very moment when it wanted to become historical. Within Christianity, the historical critique stands for the epigenesis of the loss of religion. According to this theory, religion dissolves itself by dismissing radical unworldliness and apocalyptic hope for the end of history and trading them for the understanding of history as the Kingdom of God. Overbeck anew digs an ugly gulf between history and the truth of religion, which is lost in history to begin with. Historical experience becomes the experience of nonsense. This method of historically guided criticism of religion develops into a radical critique of a modernity which has lost any understanding of sense and meaning. Despite it, history and religious meaning never really were uncoupled, and Overbeck’s critical theory of history appears as negative theology.\n\n13\n\nBarth 1918: 10.\n\nCLAIMS OF TRUTH\n\n11\n\nREFERENCES CITED Barth, Karl (151989) (21922), Der Römerbrief (The Epistle to the Romans).

Koselleck1\n\n1. Old Chinese and “Structural Complexity” Writing just a few months before his death, A.C. Graham (1919-1991) gave the following reason for an apparent lack of interest in Chinese language structure in Ancient China: China provides the unique instance of philosophy of language developed in a language of uninflected words organized solely by word order and the functions of grammatical particles. In the absence of morphological features such as compel attention in Indo-European and Semitic languages, there is little to make Chinese aware of the structure of their own language.2\n\nStatements of this kind, tacitly connecting a late linguistic surface property to the assumed absence of a type of scientific development, have a long pedigree in the European study of Chinese languages, philosophy and history. While speakers of, say, Ewe or Vietnamese—two other well studied “isolating” literary languages—might with justice mutter at their swift exclusion from the realm of philosophies of language worth studying, it is at least heartening to see Graham demonstrate, in the pages following this sweeping introductory statement, just how radical and sophisticated early Chinese theories of naming, reference, and meaning were. For unlike in his case, the routinely alleged “structural simplicity” of Classical Chinese has prompted periodically resurfacing claims of 1 2\n\nKoselleck 1989: 673. Graham 1992: 94.\n\n14\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nlinguistic relativism in Ancient China, of a restriction to pragmatic, conventional, ritualistic or merely performative modes of expression in Classical Chinese, not to speak of the usual corollary of denials regarding the capacity of the language to express propositional truth-claims, individuation, or abstraction. 3 The same “structural simplicity” has been assumed to be the main reason behind the comparative underdevelopment of a syntactically oriented philological tradition in China, and this has certainly helped to consolidate a lack of interest in the linguistic development of premodern Chinese in general. Indeed, even in those rare cases where words and their written representations in characters were not confused in the many discussions of how knowledge, truth and cognition are mediated by linguistic categories in Ancient Chinese, Humboldtian hesitations and Whorfian whiffs more often than not continue to shroud the perception of it as a perfectly ordinary natural language. Moreover, this was a language in which despite an unusual diachronic stability of written representations, large-scale typological change was anything but uncommon. What, then, one might ask, were the most important “structural” changes affecting this language since its first attestation in oracle bone inscriptions towards the end of the second millennium B.C. that we might reasonably expect to have left traces in the early literature? How was language change reflected in the commentarial traditions of the post-Classical periods and in the considerable independent extant body of technical works on phonology and semasiology? And which—if any—consequences did the perception of language change have for questions of textual authenticity and historical truth claims? In the following, I will try to approach these questions from the point of view of historical linguistics, leaving problems of argumentation strategies and propositional validity in Chinese philosophy to other contributors to this volume.\n\n3 For two devastating refutations of most of these positions see Harbsmeier 1989: 125-166 and Roetz 1993: 69-112.\n\nTHE IDEA OF A “CONSTANT” WAY\n\n15\n\n2. Historical Development of the Awareness of Language Change a) Morphological Change Inflectional and derivational morphologies are usually considered to be the diachronically most stable and the genetically most revealing subsystems of language.4 If I restrict myself to these two aspects of pre-modern Chinese morphology in the following section, this by no means is intended to imply that other types of morphology and word-formation somehow lack complexity and can be neglected. For instance, Modern Chinese word formation is governed by very complicated morphological rules, which have been the focus of intense study for the last forty years. Unless one intends to speak in a very vague, traditional and Eurocentric sense, to refer to it as a language “lacking morphology” is therefore rather infelicitous.5 As an illustration of the problem of “structural complexity” and morphological change in premodern Chinese, consider for example the word ৆ shi “scribe o historiographer”. It is attested as a character since the earliest period of oracle bone inscriptions, where it already appears in titles of high ranking officials, apart from its occurrence as a personal name, and in loan usages for the terms which were later graphically differentiated as Փ shi “to employ, send” and џ shi “to serve (the spirits, ancestors)”. A plethora of speculations about the graphic extraction of the character ৆ has been voiced since Wang Guowei’s ⥟೟㎁ (1877-1927) famous essay on the subject,6 usually focusing on the object held by the largely uncontroversial জ-“hand” in the osteographical form 7 and the corresponding assignment of the official’s function to predominantly religious, ritual, bureaucratic, or military realms.8 Yet irrespective of the moot (and, one might argue, largely secondary) question as to which initial iconic representation was chosen by the inventors of the script to denote a word eventually 4\n\nNichols 1992. See, e.g., RoÞdestvenskij 1958; Korotkov 1968; Karl and Beutel 1993; Packard 1998, 2000; Lien 2000: 61-78. 6 Wang 1968. 7 For more or less fanciful explanations of this presumed “insignium” of a shi see, among others, Gu 1924; Chen Mengjia 1936a,b; Shirakawa 1955-62; Harper 1985: 472-474, and the glosses collected in Hayashi and Takashima 1994. 8 For attempts to define the ritualistic and bureaucratic functions of a shi on the basis of paleographical documents, see Wang Guimin 1982; Hu Houxuan 1984; Zhang and Liu 1986; Vandermeersch 1994, and the literature cited in Cook 1995: 241-277, 252 note 43. 5\n\n16\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nmeaning “scribe”, that has bothered paleographers so much, the structural complexity of the Old Chinese language can be easily demonstrated by peeping beyond the veil of writing into the finely woven texture of the reconstructed root lexeme, its phonology and morphological derivations:9 I. ৆ sh´ < MC sriX < OC *V-U is an *s-prefixed deverbal derivation from an underlying root ⧚ l´ < liX < *U “to divide, regulate, mark (of 10 field divisions)”, which in turn was most likely a cognate of Classical 11 Tibetan bri-ba “draw, design”, bris “picture”. A “scribe” was therefore originally simply “a marker”, or, taking into account some of the daughter language reflexes of the Sino-Tibetan etymon slightly further afield: “a scratcher”. Obviously, these semantics would seem to chime well with the earliest archeologically attested types of writing materials in Neolithic and early Bronze Age China, as well as with Kominami’s recent interpretation of the shi as a recorder and calculator of numbers incised on pottery.12 II. Homophonic Փ sh´ < sriX < *V-U “to employ, send”, on the other hand, is an *V-prefixed denominative from underlying ৣ lì < liH < *U-V “official, clerk”, which in turn probably emerged as an *-V-suffixed deverbal from the root of (I.) – ⧚ l´ < liX < *U. Consequently a “clerk” was originally also construed by speakers of Old Chinese to be a “marker, regulator”, while “to clerk someone” as a 9 Old Chinese (OC) reconstructions and Middle Chinese (MC) transcriptions (in italics, without astersik) are according to the system of Baxter (1992, 1995), as revised by Sagart (1999). The “Pulleyblankian” A/B-type syllable distinction written by Sagart as a/b-superscripts is here represented by doubling the vowel in A-syllables. This is to be understood as a mere diacritic device, remaining non-committal on the issue of whether the distinction was in fact one of phonemic length or some other (supra) segmental feature. The model of morphology used in this paper, if not stated otherwise, is that of Sagart 1999. For an alternative, albeit only partly compatible approach see also Pulleyblank 2000. 10 Compare the Maozhuan-commentary on Shijing 210.1:ǋ⧚ˈߚഄ⧚гǌ. 11 See Unger 1992: 77 and Coblin 1983: 66. The word is certainly related to Classical Tibetan ri-ba “figure, picture, drawing, marking”, and should, contrary to Jeon (1996: 50), not be treated separately. Cf. also Starostin and Peiros 1996, II: 77/#281, s.v. ST *ULH, for more Tibeto-Burman cognates of this item. 12 Kominami 1999. This is prefigured by Hu Dianxian (1981: 212-13), who argues for an original meaning “to stab, stick into (the earth)”. Note that theorists of the origins of writing now sometimes claim that a development of numeracy is an indispensable cognitive, cultural, and historical precondition for the development of literacy. For the now classic, not disputed, statement of this position see Schmandt-Besserat 1979, 1992, for a balanced critique Damerow 1993, 1994.\n\nTHE IDEA OF A “CONSTANT” WAY\n\n17\n\ntransitive verb eventually came to be written as Փ in inscriptions and edited texts. III. The root ⧚ l´ < liX < *U “to divide, regulate, mark” also survives in a *N-prefixed form as ㋔ jì < kiX < *N-U “record, commit to 13 memory”, thus pointing to the typical occupation of a shi-scribe. Prefix *k- in verbs usually denotes “actions well delimited in time and space”, so the earliest reconstructable semantics of ji must have been something similar to “to mark down, to mark once and for all” or the like. The same root also appears in 㿬 jì < kiH, which is today a homophone of ji ㋔ , but probably emerged as a secondary (“exoactive”?) derivation OC *N-U()-V. IV. џ shì < dzriH < *P-V-U()-V “to serve for, carry out assignments; service for” adds volitional *P- to the *V-prefixed version of ৣ lì < liH < *U-V to create a double-prefixed derivation of the suffixed root. “To serve” is therefore to be analyzed as “to be willing to act as clerk”, while ҩ shì < dzriX < *N-V-U “to be a clerk, to serve as”, prefixed with untransitivizing *N-, is an older, non-directional (“endoactive”) variant of the same verb. Finally, homophonic ຿ shi “servant, retainer” is to be analyzed as the corresponding noun “human being capable of doing assignments”.14 Developing an awareness of the “morphology of ideas” 15 and its subsequent disintegration in this fashion obviously does not necessarily entail that we should start to re-translate Classical Chinese texts and to criticize our historiographical sources with Old and pre-Old Chinese etymologies in the back of our minds (although this can hardly be helped, once they are in there). Despite all understandable temptations to fall prey to etymological fallacies, one has to be aware that semantic shifts, which are not expressed in the derivational morphology, had to a large degree effaced many features of the original semantics of these words already during the Warring States period. And, crucially, a word is always much more than the sum of its morphosemantic components. It is doubtful, for instance, whether Xu Shen 䀅ᜢ (58-?148 A.D.) was\n\n13\n\nCf. Unger (1992), who thinks of an initial *VNU-. Notice that ji ㋔ is used as a paronomastic gloss for ⧚ li in the Baihutong ⱑ㰢䗮 (ACTCS-edition 29: 54). 14 Schuessler 1987: 550. Maybe ຿ originated with prefix *P-, marking agent nouns (Sagart 1999: 84), rather than *N- in ҩ. Both would have given the same MC reflex. 15 I am borrowing this term from Mei 1994.\n\n18\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nstill indicating an intricate etymological connection rather than a simple paronomastic pun when he glossed ৆ˈ㿬џ㗙г\n\nOC *V-U, N-U N-V-U-V WD ODM. Shi, means someone who notes down assignments/affairs/events.16 Moreover, the rapid diachronic loss of derivational morphology between (pre-) Old and Early Medieval Central Plains Chinese affected different segments of the language with differing degrees of intensity and recoverability. Even worse, the process might also have been blurred by dialectal differentiation at any synchronic point during the development. It is thus quite easy to come up with plenty of textual examples featuring an extraordinary phonological stability across time, and corresponding to a rather impoverished reconstructed morphology, almost akin to traditional sinological cliché of Old Chinese “structural simplicity”. Thus, if we were to take a look at the famous first sentence from the Wang Bi-Laozi ⥟ᔐ㗕ᄤ and follow its (mor-) phonological changes throughout time as well as into two maximally divergent modern dialects,17 we would surely be led to the assumption that continuity by far outweighed innovation, i.e. that the ancient language sometimes had almost as few surface cues to its morphology as it has today:18 Time\n\n䘧\n\nৃ\n\n䘧\n\na.\n\n-800\n\nOXX\n\nN+DDM OXX\n\nb.\n\n100\n\nGRX N+DL GRX\n\nc.\n\n400\n\nGDZ+ NKD\n\n䴲\n\nᐌ\n\nOXX\n\nB.C.\n\nG]#LD1 GRX\n\nA.D.\n\nS-ZLM GD1 SXL\n\nGDZ+ SXM[\n\n䘧\n\nGÞØD1 GDZ+\n\n16 Shuowen 3B: 65; for a discussion of the pun see also Cook 1995: 251. Contra Cook, there is no indication that the assonating 㙋 zhí (< MC tsyik < OC *WN) “assignment, duty, office”, used by Xu Shen to gloss џ belongs to the same word family. The pun, here, is apparently just that. 17 The Min dialects had split off from Common Chinese already during the later Han dynasty, cf. Ting 1983. 18 a. = Baxter’s revised OC (cf. n. 8 above), b. = “Late Han Chinese” according to Schuessler 2000, c.-e. = Early Middle, Late Middle, Early Mandarin Chinese according to Pulleyblank 1991, f. = IPA transcription of the Xiamen ᒜ䭔- (Southern Min 䭽), g. = of the Beijing Mandarin dialect.\n\nTHE IDEA OF A “CONSTANT” WAY\n\n19\n\nd.\n\n700\n\nWÜDZ N+D\n\nWÜDZ IM\\M\n\nÜLD1 WÜDZ\n\ne.\n\n1300\n\nWDZ\n\nN+o\n\nWDZ\n\nIL\n\nW+D1 WDZ\n\nWR11\n\nN+XD51 WR11\n\nKXL24\n\nsÄu24\n\nf. 2000\n\nWDX\n\ng.\n\n51\n\nN+)\n\n214\n\nWDX\n\n51\n\n11\n\nWR11\n\nW+D13 WDX51\n\nIHL\n\n5\n\n“A dao which can be dao-ed is not the constant dao”19\n\nHere, the only20 morphologically conspicuous position is the *S- of 䴲 *S-ZLM, alerting us to the fact that we are dealing with a “negative copula”, a contraction or “allegro form” of a negative prefix with the archaic copular verb ㎁ wéi < wij < *(W-)ZXM, not just a simple negative. Philosophically and linguistically a rather important distinction, to be sure, but certainly not the main obstacle to the unravelling of this sentence—captured in the desperately awkward last rendering by Graham before his death. Given the nature of the Chinese writing system, the process of demorphologization and subsequent obsolescence or complete loss of derivational affixes which had once pervasively characterized Old Chinese is notoriously difficult to date. Its likely consequences upon syntactic and lexical restructuring are even harder to pin down. Change of derivational morphology in Old Chinese can only be recovered indirectly, i.e. “algebraically”, through the study of its Middle Chinese reflexes, of loanwords, transcriptions, rhyme patterns, word games, glosses, and, above all, inconsistencies in datable homophonophoric (xiesheng 䂻㙆) series. Although several peripheral Chinese dialects have been shown to retain morphological features reconstructed to Old Chinese,21 it is probably safe to assume that with the exception of the suffix *-V, giving rise to the phenomenon commonly referred to as “qusheng এ㙆-derivation”, which must have stayed productive until 19\n\nGraham 1992: 103. It has been proposed by Zheng-Zhang (2000a: 66), Schuessler (personal communication, August 2001), and others, that the final glottal stop had morphological functions in OC too. Here, I preliminarily follow Sagart (1999: 133-135), who found no consistent evidence for such an assumption. 21 Cf. Sagart 1999 and Pan 2000 for many pertinent examples. 20\n\n20\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nwell into the medieval period,22 all other fourteen currently proposed prefixed and infixed elements, encoding some 25odd grammatical functions in Old Chinese, were petrified and reanalyzed as part of the root at the latest towards the end of the Eastern Han. What we could expect of commentators since the Western Han, then, is an awareness of semantic, pragmatic, lexical, and phonological change in the texts at their disposal and the everyday language around them. To find more than circumstantial evidence on morphological change is, however, rather unlikely.\n\nb) Semantic and Pragmatic Change A consciousness of language, especially of semantic and pragmatic change, only occasionally forms a subtle undercurrent of the “rectifying names” (zheng ming ℷৡ) discourse in pre-Qin philosophy23 which was developed against the experience of a disintegrating world. Thus, Confucius’ famous gu bu gu 㾮ϡ㾮 lament,24 can be read as a playful statement reflecting the mismatch between a word form (OC *N:DD), its former semantic reference (“chalice”) and the current signifié. As far as we can judge from archeological attestations of gu-vessels today, this mismatch was caused by a change in the material culture between the Shang and the Warring States period, although nothing within the three-syllable sentence explicitly indicates this temporal frame. Since the use of the adverbial negative ϡ bu precludes an equational reading of the sentence during this period,25 the focus of Confucius’ sigh is clearly on the usage of the object, rather than on its semantic content: “A chalice is not used as a chalice”.26 Still, the Confucian zheng ming agenda was ultimately less concerned with questions of ritual and social 22\n\nPulleyblank 1973. Zheng-Zhang (2000b: 7) even dates the origin of all phonemic tones in Central Chinese into the Six Dynasties/Early Tang period. A massive collection of evidence for this dating frame is now available in Sun 2000. On the functions of this suffix, see recently Sagart 1999: 131-133 and Mazo 2000, 2002. 23 Gassmann 1988; Makeham 1994; and Harbsmeier 1998: 51-53. 24 Lunyu 6.25.129. 25 Pace He Yan’s ԩᰣ (190-249 A.D.) gloss: ǋ㿔䴲㾮гǄǌ(“This says ‘it is not a chalice’”), or modern translators like Unger 1994: 64. Arthur Waley’s reading “A horn-gourd that is neither horn nor gourd”, praised in Harbsmeier (1998: 52 n. 4), not only nonchalantly misanalyses the character as ‘syssemantic’ (huiyi ᳗ᛣ), but violates the grammatical rules of negation in Classical Chinese, which are so admirably discussed elsewhere in Harbsmeier’s book e.g. 1998: 109 n. 6. 26 Brooks and Brooks 1998: 36.\n\nTHE IDEA OF A “CONSTANT” WAY\n\n21\n\nappropriateness of speech acts or theories of linguistic reference than with the ideals and ethics of proper government.27 On the other hand, the Daoists and “Sophists”, while radical in their criticism of language, eagerly exploited this very language to its logical and poetic extremes, in order to show that just “like the Dao never had borders, saying never had norms”, and that it is by virtue of “a ‘this’ which deems, that a boundary is drawn.” 28 Comparison of different diachronic levels of speech, let alone consideration of the motivations and mechanisms of change were, as far as we can see, marginal concerns in all philosophical schools during the pre-Qin period. It is thus rare to find generalized statements such as the following from the Lüshi Chunqiu ਖ⇣᯹⾟ (ca. 239 B.C.): সПੑ໮ϡ䗮ТҞП㿔㗙Ǆ Ancient ordinances (or terms) are often not communicable in modern speech.29\n\nEven in pre-Qin examples rather explicitly referring to language change, it is usually not the process of change, but its social or political consequences that are at stake. Notice, however, that the observation of language change does not inevitably lead into an exclusively retrospective kind of language conservativism, just as the recognition of the failure of traditional ethics and religion during the political and social crisis of the Warring States period did not stop an attempt to reestablish the traditional conventions of the sage kings’ “golden age”. The Xunzi 㤔ᄤ says:30 Ҟ㘪⥟≦ˈৡᅜ᜶ˈ༛䖁䍋ˈৡᆺіǄᰃ䴲Пᔶϡᯢˈࠛᅜ⊩Пৣˈ 䁺ᭌП‫ˈۦ‬ѺⱚіǄ㢹᳝⥟㗙䍋ˈᖙᇛ᳝ᕾᮐ㟞ৡˈ᳝԰ᮐᮄৡǄ Today, the sage kings are no more, the conservation of names has been neglected, strange expressions have risen, and names and their referents are in confusion.

When these men spoke about affairs, they did not intend to be difficult to understand, or to cause their meanings to be hermetical and hidden. If people of later times can not make sense of them, it is owing to the great remoteness of generations through time. This is to be called ‘difference in language’, not ‘vastness of literary skill’.\n\nWang Chong’s ⥟‫( ܙ‬27-91 A.D.) association of temporal (diachronic) with spatial (dialectal) distance was to become a recurrent motive in the debates on pronunciation change after the Song dynasty. More importantly, his observation of dialectal diversity during the period of Han territorial expansion and institutional centralization was certainly conducive to a shift of awareness from the semantic and lexical to the sociolinguistic and phonological domains in language change.35 31 This is understood as “to follow the good ones in the case of good names, and to create new ones in the case of bad ones” (ǋ୘㗙ᕾПˈϡ୘㗙԰Пǌ) by his earliest commentator Yang Liang ἞‫( ײ‬fl. late 9th c.).

In his gloss on dialect synonyms for the word ໻ da “be big” the author elaborates: ߱߹೟ϡⳌᕔ՚П㿔гˈҞ៪ৠˈ㗠㟞᳌䲙㿬ᬙ֫䁲ϡ༅݊ᮍǄ㗠 ᕠҎϡⶹˈᬙ⚎П԰䞟гǄ Words, which could initially not be communicated between different countries, are sometimes shared [by all speakers of Chinese] today, whereas words noted as vernacular in ancient writings and glossography do not fail to be widespread.

Thus, it is not surprising that we do not come across technical terms for it in the Fangyan. It is undeniable that dialect diversity was one of the driving forces leading to the development of historical phonology as a science in China, long before the advent of Qing “evidential research” (kaozhengxue 㗗䄝ᅌ). Yan Zhitui 丣П᥼ (531-ca. 590 A.D.) during the northern Qi ࣫唞 period had already outlined a programme for a systematic comparison of dialects. In the chapter on phonology in the Family Instructions of the Yan Clan (Yanshi Jiaxun 丣⇣ᆊ㿧) he writes: 㗠স䁲㟛Ҟ⅞߹˄…˅݅ҹᏱ⥟䛑䙥ˈগ᷵ᮍ֫ˈ㗗㽜সҞˈ⚎П ᡬ㹋Ǆ᥼㗠䞣Пˈ⤼䞥䱉㟛⋯ϟ㘇Ǆ There are, however, differences between ancient and modern languages. (...) Only between the two imperial capitals Chin-ling (Nanking, the capital of the Southern Dynasties) and Lo-yang (the capital of the Northern Dynasties), can different usages be compared and ancient and modern pronunciations examined, so as to obtain a well balanced view. 41\n\nDespite his well known stance as a “restorationist” (fugu zhuyizhe ᕽস Џ㕽㗙)42 in all matters concerning language, morals and customs, it is certainly anachronistic to assume that Yan had a notion of “comparative reconstruction” based on dialects. Rather, the “well-balanced view” he was interested in was aimed at the construction of literary and possibly concomitant pedagogical standards for practical use in literary pursuits. Although paying great attention to old glosses and rhyme dictionaries no longer extant, Yan certainly did not hesitate to jettison earlier pronunciations, if they could not be reconciled with his idealized system of maximal contemporary dialect distinctions: 40 Fangyan a: 1.3.2; b: 1.2.1-2; c: 3.12. 20; d: 10.10. 62, cf. Ren 1986: 137-141; Wang Li 1981: 22-23. Contrary to Fu (1988), it is certainly exaggerated to construe passages like this as implying a full-fledged understanding of “historical-comparative” linguistics in the modern European sense of the word. 41 Yanshi Jiaxun 7.18, (Wang Liqi ed. 1993: 529), as translated by Teng 1968: 188-89. 42 Wang 1961: 67.\n\n26\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nসҞ㿔䁲ˈᰖ֫ϡৠǄ˄…˅ࠡϪড䁲ˈজ໮ϡߛǄ˄…˅ϡৃձ ֵˈѺ⚎ⴒ⶷ǄҞПᅌ⇣ˈ䁲ѺϡℷǄস⤼ԩҎˈᖙឝ䱼ّ݊‫ۏ‬Т˛ From ancient times to modern times, language and customs have frequently changed. (...) The fanyu spellings of earlier generations are often inaccurate [exx.] (...). Such unreliable spellings are numerous. The pronunciations of present-day scholars are not correct. But if the ancients are also incorrect, why should we follow their mistakes?43\n\nIt has been heavily disputed in recent work on the historiography of Chinese linguistics, as to whether Yan Zhitui and other scholars belonging to the circle of Lu Fayan 䱌⊩㿔 (562-? A.D.) had a concept of norms and standards of language at all.44 Lu alone was responsible for the compilation of the Qieyun ߛ䷏ of 601, the most important text in the history of Chinese phonology, although some of its contents had been discussed with scholars such as Yan Zhitui. The crucial line bearing on the problem of linguistic standards in the preface of this work, surviving in various later quotations, reads: ಴䂪फ࣫ᰃ䴲ˈসҞ䗮าˈ℆᳈ᤗ䙌㊒ߛˈ䰸ࠞ⭣㎽Ǆ Therefore we discussed the right and wrong of the North and the South, the comprehensible and the incomprehensible of the past and the present, wishing to select what is essential and accurate and to discard what is loose and negligent.45\n\nI think that the problem can be removed if we acknowledge that this line, as well as the whole preface, is inconclusive on the question of the existence of a notion of normative speech and pronunciation in everyday life. However, it was not merely descriptive or cumulative of earlier work either. If Lu and his colleagues, despite all the shu er bu zuo 䗄㗠ϡ԰ rhetoric of the preface, had not wanted to fix (ding ᅮ) “formulas intended for use in writing literature and vocalizing literary texts”, 46 what would have been the point of transmitting a system whose “splits and analyses are exceedingly fine” and “distinctions abundant and profuse” in the first place?47\n\n43\n\nYanshi Jiaxun 7.18: 545, translated in Teng 1968: 191-93.

Unfortunately, the point is difficult to assess with the very few bilingual materials at our disposal. The Greeks had recognized regional speech varieties already during the fifth century B.C., and, just as in the medieval Sanskrit literary tradition, had exploited substandard expressions for comic effect in drama. Nevertheless, a systematic consideration of the historical dynamics of dialect/norm-relationships did not ensue. Even in what was probably the most sophisticated discussion of the causae mutationis linguarum before Leibniz (1646-1716), Herder (1744-1803) and Adelung (1732-1806) and their nineteenth-century successors—the De ratione communi omnium linguarum & literarum commentarius (1548) of the Swiss theologian, orientalist, and linguist Theodor Bibliander (alias Buchmann, 1506-1564)49—dialect standardization is not adduced in the impressive list of motivations for change: These include contact and mixture with external languages, social and political change, the emergence of scientific and professional languages, the influence of secret languages, as well as the “moral disposition of man”.50 Although remarks on one or another dialect phenomenon were rather commonplace during European Renaissance linguistics, the first systematic description of regular correspondences between dialects within one and the same language and their role in language change is due to Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) and his Geschichte der deutschen Sprache.51 48\n\nMcDavid 1990. On the importance of his work for the “prehistory” of comparative linguistics in Europe see Peters 1984: 11-18; on Bibliander’s contributions to Semitic studies, including the first Latin translation of the Qur’an (Basel : J. Oporinus, 1543), see also Bobzin 1986. 50 Cf. Gardt 1999: 225 & 218-229 for the general linguistic trends during this period in Germany. 51 Ramat 1990: 204-205. 49\n\n28\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nOn balance, then, the development of an awareness of diachronic status difference extrapolated from observations on synchronic variability in dialects was a very slow and frequently interrupted process in Europe, just as in China. Already well into the Qing (1644-1911) dynasty, Yan Ruoju 䮏㢹⩽ (1626-1704) still feels it necessary to point out that: ᄫ᳝স䷇ˈҹҞ䷇㐽Пˈ⼛㾎݊ᤡḐϡড়ˈ⤊䁲᳝࣫䷇ˈҹफ䷇㐽 ПˈᤡḐ⤊ᬙгǄҎⶹफ࣫П䷇㋏ТഄˈϡⶹসҞП䷇㋏ТᰖǄഄ 䱨ᭌकⱒ䞠ˈ䷇े䅞ᯧˈ㗠䃖ᰖ࡯ᭌगⱒ䓝ˈ䷇⤊ϔᕟˈᇮᕫ䃖П 䗮ҎТ˛ Characters have ancient pronunciations, and if we fix them using present-day pronunciations, we only become aware that they are conflicting and inadequate. This is just as if in the case of northern pronunciations, we fixed them with southern ones, and they would consequently be conflicting. People know that southern and northern pronunciations are tied to a given region, but they do not know that ancient and present-day pronunciations are tied to time. Yet if sounds are changed even between regions several hundred miles apart, would someone who held that sounds are fully uniform across several thousands of years still be considered an expert?! 52\n\nAnd it would take yet another century before Qian Daxin 䣶໻Ⳏ (1728-1804) precisely described the mechanism of shift from a substandard into the standard language as a major motivation behind sound change, acknowledging en passant the possibility of retention of archaic features in conservative dialects. In a letter to his main phonological contender of the time—Duan Yucai ↉ ⥝ 㺕 (1735-1815)—he writes: 㙆䷇П䅞ˈ⬅ᮐᮍ㿔ˈྟᮐϔᮍ㗠‫أ‬ᮐ໽ϟˈЙП䘖༅᳔݊߱П䷇Ǆ བҞҎ䅔ǋ㚪ǌ⚎ǋ᱂ᯎߛǌˈ䅔ǋ䭢ǌ⚎ǋ᠊ᎹߛǌǄे䭧᳝ϔ ᮍᇮᄬস䷇ˈ㌖ϡ㛑ࢱ⍋ܻПষǄ Sound changes originate in dialects. Beginning in one region they spread throughout the whole world, and if they prevail for a long enough time the pronunciation which existed in the very beginning is finally lost. For instance, people today read 㚪 (MC phanH > {pàn}) ‘be fat’ as if spelled by ᱂ᯎ p×+wáng (ph[uX]+[hjw]angH > pàng), and 䭢 hóng (MC hwaeng > {w¥ng}) ‘gate’ as if spelled by ᠊ Ꮉ hù+g¿ng (MC h[uX]+[k]uwng > hóng). Even if there is occasionally an area where the old pronunciation is still retained, it will finally yield to the mouths\n\n52 Shangshu Guwen Shuzheng ᇮ᳌স᭛⭣䄝 (lost), as quoted in Dai Zhen’s ᠈䳛, Shengyun Kao 㙆ഛ㗗 3, 34. 2-3.\n\nTHE IDEA OF A “CONSTANT” WAY\n\n29\n\n‘within the seas’ (i.e. the pronunciation by speakers of central innovative dialects). 53\n\nStatements like this, formulated in terms of abstract equations of pronunciation spellers, presuppose a long development of techniques of phonological description and analysis. Unlike in Europe and the ancient Near East, the main source of phonological disconcertion leading to the development of such techniques did not stem from wholesale language shift, long term diglossia, or creolization under conditions of foreign elite dominance. Its major inspiration, it seems, was the necessity to model and explain phonological change in order to account for the rhyming practices and loan usages of characters in the classics, and, eventually, to enable their replication under the literary constraints enshrined in the state examination system since the Tang.\n\nd) Phonological Change The oldest extant comments, directly reflecting phonological change, are to be found in two of Zheng Xuan’s 䜁⥘ (127-200 A.D.) glosses on the Maoshi ↯䀽, where they are used in paronomastic arguments for the interpretation of words not encountered with the ordinary Shi connotation. Justifying his identification of zheng ⚱ (MC tsying < OC *W1) “be numerous, many” as tián よ (dHn < *GLLQ) “be ample” in the song Dongshan ᵅቅ of the collection, Zheng Xuan goes on to say: স㗙㙆ˈǋよǃよǃ้ǌৠгǄ Anciently, the pronunciations of tián (dHn < *GLLQ), tián/chén (dHn < *GLLQ / drin < *GULQ), and chén (drin < *GULQ) were identical.54\n\nAnd in a gloss on the ᐌặ Changdi-ode of the Lesser elegantiae: স㗙ˈǋϡǃᢞǌৠ гǄ In ancient pronunciation f½u (pjuwX < *S) and f× (phjuX < *SD) were identical.55 53 “Yu Duan Ruoying Shu” 㟛↉㢹㞎᳌, Qianyantang Wenji ┯ⷨූ᭛䲚 33: 5 edited in Zhang and Xu, henceforth abbreviated as GDYYXZL (1993: 61 = B1-1.4.5). 54 Maoshi 156.1 in Shisan Jing 396a: ǋ㳢㳢㗙㸒ˈ⚱೼ḥ䞢ǌ “Crawling are the caterpillars, they’re numerous in the mulberry grounds”; cf. Coblin 1983: 205 n. 18, GDYYXZL B1-1.1.41. 55 Maoshi 164.1 in Shisan Jing 408a:ǋ䛖ϡ䶵䶵ǌ“in a sudden outburst the flowers became ample and brilliant” (Karlgren), cf. GDYYXZL B1-1.1: 41.\n\n30\n\nWOLFGANG BEHR\n\nWhile we can see from our vantage point of reconstruction today that neither of these glosses was adequate for the stage of language development that Zheng Xuan was trying to come to grips with, it is remarkable to see him at least trying to look beyond his own Eastern Han phonological horizon. 56 Liu Xi ࡝ ❭ , the author of the paronomastic compendium Glossed Names (Shiming 䞟ৡ) finished shortly before 213 A.D., fares only slightly better when he tries to explain the development of a pronunciation that still causes confusion today: স㗙᳄ǋ䒞ǌˈ㙆བǋሙǌˈ᠔ҹሙҎгǄҞ᳄ǋ䒞ǌˈ㙆䖥ǋ㟡ǌǄ Anciently, when one pronounced 䒞, the sound was like that of ሙ jÔ (< kjo < *N(U)D; ‘to sit, squat, settle’), i.e. ‘that on which people are made to sit’. When we pronounce 䒞 today, the sound approximates that of 㟡 shè (sy4H < *KODN-V).57\n\nIn fact, Liu Xi here confounds what are two separate pronunciations of the same word, going back to Old Chinese *N-KOD > tsyhæ > ch¥ and *N-OD > NMR > jÔ “thing carried o carriage o car(t)”, respectively. These variants, with no discernable difference of meaning in Classical Chinese texts, came about as two independent dialectal *k-derivations of the root 㟕 yú (< yoX < *OD) “to lift, carry”.58 Alternatively—but less likely in view of the size and transparent morphology of the word family—they are to be analyzed as two reflexes from a very early Indo-European loan into Old Chinese, either borrowed during different periods, or from different Central Asian kentum languages.59 Much more common and increasingly less contingent than paronomastic glosses of this type, prompted by the urge to explain this or that inner Chinese loan or to elucidate a cherished (folk) etymology, were remarks on diachronic sound change triggered by impure or “slant” rhymes in poetry, and implying more than just a notion of sporadic sound change. In principle, today just like in early medieval China, there are three prototypical ways to explain messy rhyme data:\n\n56 As is clear from his preface to his commentary on the Zhouli ਼⾂, Zheng Xuan also had a very lucid notion of semantic change, discussed by, inter alia, by Li Jianguo 1986: 5. 57 Shiming (Shanghai Guji-edition 7.24: 356), GDYYXZL B1-1.3: 41. 58 Sagart 1999: 204; Baxter 1992: 479-480. For a good collection of evidence on these characters see also Lin 2001: 16-18. 59 Pulleyblank 1995: 145-195 vs. Lubotsky 1998.\n\nTHE IDEA OF A “CONSTANT” WAY\n\n31\n\nI. assuming that rhyming standards were not based on a phonemic identity principle, i.e. accept assonance/consonance and other types of loose rhyming II. assuming that there is dialect interference III. assuming that there is diachronic development\n\nIt seems that at one point or another during the development of traditional Chinese phonology, all positions have successively been asserted or even combined, with varying degrees of confidence. Position i. is usually associated with Lu Deming 䱌ᖋᯢ (556-627 or 630 A.D.), author of the Jingdian Shiwen ㍧‫݌‬䞟᭛ completed in 583, i.e. representing a phonological standard roughly comparable to that of the Qieyun, with some possible Wu ਇ dialect features.60 The work is a compilation of phonological spellers and semantic glosses on fourteen classics61 culled from no less than 230 earlier works, most of them lost today.62 Having observed that not only rhymes in original poetry are sometimes problematic, but also “the sound glosses of characters today are not identical with those of ancient times”,63 Lu proceeds to reject one of the earliest known attempts to produce an artificial reading for a Shijing rhyme character, which was devised in order to convert its pronunciation into a pure rhyme in the spoken standard of its author. This pronunciation assignment is found in a gloss by Shen Zhong ≜䞡 (500-583 A.D.), a scholar from Zhejiang, who in his no longer extant Sounds of the Maoshi (Maoshi Yin ↯䀽䷇) had spelled the character nan फ in the Yanyan ➩➩-ode as ni lín Зᵫ (Maoshi 28.3), i.e. Middle Chinese n[oj]+[l]im, instead of regular nom (< OC *QP), in order to make it match with yin ䷇ < ’im < *(r)P and x¯n ᖗ < sim < *VP in the same poem.
