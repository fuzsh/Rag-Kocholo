        "text": "Citation preview\n\nRethinking Chinese Popular Culture\n\nThrough analyses of a wide range of Chinese literary and visual texts from the beginning of the twentieth century through to the contemporary period, the thirteen essays in this volume challenge the view that canonical and popular culture are self-evident and diametrically opposed categories, and instead argue that the two cultural sensibilities are inextricably bound up with one another. An international line-up of contributors present detailed analyses of literary works and other cultural products that have previously been neglected by scholars, while also examining more familiar authors and works from provocative new angles. The essays include investigations into the cultural industries and contexts that produce the canonical and popular, the position of contemporary popular works at the interstices of nostalgia and amnesia, and also the ways in which cultural texts are inflected with gendered and erotic sensibilities while at the same time also functioning as objects of desire in their own right. As the only volume of its kind to cover the entire span of the twentieth century, and also to consider the interplay of popular and canonical literature in modern China with comparable rigor, Rethinking Chinese Popular Culture is an important resource for students and scholars of Chinese literature and culture.

In fact, by the time he wrote this essay, he was already actively involved with the reformist May Fourth movement’s attempts to increase literacy by promoting the use of vernacular Chinese for literature and other purposes. Similarly, his critique of a disease of canonicity presumably did not extend to all literary canons tout court, given that he was himself one of the central figures of the May Fourth movement’s efforts, during the 1920s, to establish itself as the new literary orthodoxy for modern China. In his critique of the Confucian classics, therefore, Lu Xun was not criticizing the very possibility of a cultural canon, but rather was implicitly trying to rethink what it meant to be canonical in the first place. Before the twentieth century, all narrative fiction in China was regarded as essentially popular, particularly in contrast to Confucian texts and other more socially validated literary genres such as poetry. Recognizing the broad appeal of narrative fiction, however, early twentieth century reformers attempted to appropriate it for their own purposes as a didactic tool, even as they found it necessary to contrast their own ostensibly progressive literature with a pre-existing and concurrent body of fiction that they disparaged as being merely “popular.” These self-identified reformers dubbed this latter body of literature Mandarin Ducks and Butterfly fiction (abbreviated throughout this volume to Butterfly fiction)—borrowing metonymically from two metaphors for marital bliss that appear frequently in the genre. Originally used to designate specifically traditional-style romances, the term Butterfly fiction has subsequently come to refer more generally to all genres of early twentieth century popular fiction (including martial arts fiction, detective\n\n2\n\nCarlos Rojas\n\nfiction, exposé fiction, etc.) outside of the self-defined May Fourth pantheon, together with the stylistic and thematic tendencies frequently associated with those genres. In this way, Butterfly fiction came to represent the radical Other of the emerging May Fourth canon, defined in oppositional terms by that against which it was being contrasted. Although the early twentieth century internecine debates between May Fourth and Butterfly authors had profound ramifications for subsequent understandings of the relationship between popular and elite literature, these debates were ultimately characterized by what Freud calls the narcissism of small differences. In other words, part of the reason for the hyperbolic vitriol and animosity between the rival camps was due to the fact that, at the end of the day, they were actually remarkably similar—not only in terms of the class backgrounds of their respective members, but even with respect to the content and style of the fiction they each produced. The resulting stark contrasts between canonical and popular culture derived, therefore, in large part from the considerable overlap between the two. One of the reasons why Lu Xun’s notion of a disease of canonicity is so suggestive is precisely because the metaphor, even as it attempts to pathologize the classical canon, simultaneously acknowledges the underlying power of that same canon—suggesting that, just as a disease stems from a pathogen lodged deep within the body, the Confucian canon is embedded so deeply within the Chinese body politic that the mere ability to read necessarily leaves one contaminated by its conservative ideology. Similarly, the urgency of the May Fourth movement’s rhetorical attacks on contemporary Butterfly literature reflects a desire to quell the disruptive power represented by that literature, and simultaneously to harness and reappropriate that same power for the May Fourth movement’s own purposes. An important precedent for the May Fourth movement’s conflicted views on the relationship between canonical and popular literature can be found in Liang Qichao’s famous contention, in 1902, that “if one intends to renovate the people of a nation, one must first renovate its fiction.”2 The May Fourth movement built on Liang’s suggestion that literature be used as a tool for ideological transformation, yet at the same time remained haunted by the fear that that tool might exceed, and potentially undermine, the purposes to which it was being applied. As a result, even as they were promoting the use of literature to “heal”—as Lu Xun famously put it 3—the national spirit, the May Fourth reformers were simultaneously disparaging as merely “popular” the literature written by other contemporary figures outside their movement. Forty years after Liang Qichao helped provide the theoretical basis for the May Fourth movement’s use of popular literature as a vehicle for social reform, Mao Zedong advanced a similar argument in his “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art,” in which he called for art and literature to be made into “a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, for attacking and annihilating the enemy, and to help the people to fight the\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nenemy with a united heart and mind.”4 In this context, Mao praised Lu Xun for having used “burning satire and freezing irony cast in essay form” to fight the “dark forces” of society, though he was nevertheless careful to stress that the “contemporary era requires a very different set of cultural tools in order to accomplish its goals.”5 In other words, even as Mao was using Lu Xun as a model for the socially progressive literature he himself was advocating, he was implicitly trying to quarantine himself from the critical force that Lu Xun represented. During the third quarter of the twentieth century, Maoist socialist realism became not only synonymous with cultural orthodoxy but also the default popular culture of the period. Following Mao’s death in 1976, however, socialist realism’s double hegemony as both paradigmatically orthodox and quintessentially popular began to fracture, as a loosening of politicoideological fetters together with a growing influence of market forces led to a remarkable proliferation of new cultural styles and subject matter. As I discuss in the final essay in this volume, for instance, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the self-proclaimed “hooligan writer” Wang Shuo trumpeted his defiance of existing literary orthodoxies through his iconoclastic attitude of “playing literature.” After a long and suggestive public silence on the question of Wang Shuo’s significance, in 1993 the former Minister of Culture, Wang Meng, published an influential short essay in which he argued that Wang Shuo’s famously iconoclastic style might actually be beneficial to the social order, on the grounds that it functioned as an antidote to the hypercanonical tendencies that had developed, for instance, during China’s Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Wang Meng’s belated approbation of Wang Shuo’s works as popular fiction, therefore, illustrates the orthodoxy’s attempts to rhetorically appropriate the potentially disruptive power of popular literature to further its own agenda, even as it asserts its own authority to categorize that literature as inherently “popular.” This double process of mutual borrowing and counter-identification, therefore, means that these emerging canons remained haunted by the circumstances of their formation, and specifically by their attempts to appropriate the cultural power of the same popular traditions against which they were simultaneously trying to contrast themselves. Lu Xun’s metaphor of canonical disease underscores the degree to which cultural formations (be they canonical, popular, or otherwise) are never unitary, fixed entities, but rather must be seen as inherently relational, inevitably inflected (and infected) by their attempts to differentiate themselves from one another. One of the standards to which the canon frequently appeals in its critique of its popular obverse, for instance, is that of aesthetic value (or lack thereof ). Given the fact that the same institutional forces that help construct and maintain the canon are also complicit in defining the standards of aesthetic valuation on which that canon is ostensibly grounded, however, aesthetic appraisals cannot be used as criteria for determinations of canonicity and popularity themselves. Our goal here, therefore, is not to reaffirm the aesthetic valuations on which understandings of canonical and popular\n\n4\n\nCarlos Rojas\n\nculture have traditionally been predicated, but rather to rethink the very question of what it means to speak of popular culture in the first place. Once the equation of canonical culture with aesthetic value is brought into question, it similarly becomes necessary to reassess the hermeneutic tendencies that that emphasis on aesthetic values has inspired—wherein canonical works are often approached primarily through a close reading of privileged texts, while more popular works tend to be viewed as mere symptoms of the socio-cultural contexts within which they are embedded. Our goal here is to delink these hermeneutic tendencies from the kinds of texts to which they have traditionally been applied, and instead place roughly equal emphasis on textual and contextual considerations in reading all texts, be they popular, canonical, or otherwise. Our primary focus is on literature, but we also include detailed and innovative analyses of a variety of other media, including cinema, photography, installation art, and web culture, and many of the conclusions we draw are relevant to popular culture in general. We begin by looking at the process of producing popularity, and specifically the way in which a variety of twentieth-century literary schools and genres have been defined, and define themselves, in opposition to a constantly shifting array of cultural orthodoxies. The first four essays in the volume each take an author or a literary “school” that has come to be perceived as in some way marginal to established or emerging cultural orthodoxies, and examine the ways in which that sense of marginality was itself discursively constructed and contested. We open this discussion of the dialectical relationship between centers and margins by turning to a frequently overlooked cluster of popular texts and writers positioned at the figurative margins of the (itself ostensibly marginal) body of Butterfly literature: a cluster of texts and writers known— in a play on the name of the better-known Saturday School of Butterfly literature—as the Friday School. Challenging the common assumption that, by the 1930s, popular literary traditions like the Friday School were already effectively subordinated by a May Fourth literary orthodoxy, Michel Hockx argues that the Friday School actually more than held its own during this period, noting that the very urgency of the May Fourth’s critiques of Friday School literature suggests the degree to which the former was still attempting to establish its legitimacy. Conversely, Hockx emphasizes that the literary styles associated with the Friday School were actually “part and parcel of an elite culture,” though these styles “pertain not so much to literary texts as such but rather to the aesthetic function” of those same texts. One of the implications of Hockx’s argument is that the significance of these early twentieth century literary works lay not so much in the texts themselves, but rather in how they were used to affirm (and disavow) social connections between the authors. Alexander Des Forges, meanwhile, examines this issue of authorship from a somewhat different perspective, concluding that at the turn of the century a new category of professional\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nwriter began to emerge in China, as inconsistencies in copyright law allowed authors to retain a greater degree of control over their writings, as well as their own subsequent literary fame. Taking as his starting point Liu Shi’e’s depiction of a fictional professional author in his 1909 novel New Shanghai, Des Forges argues that this text anticipates a process wherein authors began to differentiate themselves from journalists in their ability to organize and package their literary creations, even as they themselves were simultaneously being packaged as profitable brand names in their own right. Part of the reason why some fictional authors were struggling to differentiate themselves from journalists during this early twentieth century period was precisely because the two professions remained, in many ways, closely intertwined with one another. This mutual imbrication is nowhere more evident than in the figure of Zhang Henshui—one of the most popular authors of the period, and one who maintained close ties with the journalism industry throughout his career. Like Des Forges, Eileen Cheng-yin Chow begins her essay with a depiction of a fictional figure who dramatizes the author’s own status as a professional writer. The work is the author, journalist, and newspaper supplement editor Zhang Henshui’s 1920s serialized novel Unofficial History of the Old Capital, whose protagonist also happens to be a reporter in his own right. Chow points to the way in which the early twentieth century genre of the novel was itself inextricably bound up with contemporary journalistic concerns with news and novelty, arguing that journalistic and literary concerns coincided in “the aesthetic as well as material connection between the search for novelties in this period, and the new technologies, industries, and forms of expression in which this interest in the ‘new’ is expressed.” A more contemporary figure whose literary success was closely bound up with his association with journalism is the super-popular Hong Kong martial-arts novelist Jin Yong. Between 1955 and 1972, Jin Yong serialized 14 novels and novellas in Hong Kong newspapers—particularly in Mingbao, a newspaper he himself founded in 1959. Even as he was serializing these works, Jin Yong was simultaneously using his editorial voice and the authority of his newspaper to help consecrate the legitimacy of his novels, and more generally of the martial-arts genre itself. John Christopher Hamm notes Jin Yong’s comparatively unique (by Hong Kong standards) status of combining the roles of “producer of a fictional product and manager of the print media through which it was distributed,” thereby underscoring the significance of cultural brokers in promoting specific texts while at the same time implicitly reaffirming the brokers’ own authority to make those consecrations in the first place. In Jin Yong’s case, furthermore, this process of cultural consecration did not end with the initial serialization of his novels, but rather entered an entirely new stage when he proceeded to spend another decade systematically revising all of his works and preparing them for republication. Among his goals in undertaking these revisions was to\n\n6\n\nCarlos Rojas\n\nocclude the structural traces of the novels’ own serialized origins, while at the same time appropriating the symbolic capital of elite culture and a transcendent Chinese cultural tradition. Jin Yong’s attempts to retrospectively “canonize” his own serialized works underscore the principle that popular culture cannot be understood independently of the elite or orthodox culture against which it is contrasted. In the following three essays, we develop a series of canonical reflections— reflections on the nature of the canon and also, more specifically, on the canon’s status as an inverse “reflection” of the popular culture against which it struggles to contrast itself. This interrelationship between popular and canonical literature can be seen particularly clearly in a 1922 essay in which leading May Fourth author Mao Dun delivered a scathing critique of prominent Butterfly author Zhou Shoujuan’s tragic love story “A Gramophone Record,” from the preceding year. While post-1949 literary critics frequently cited Mao Dun’s essay as they strove to implement Mao Zedong’s model of socialist realism, Jianhua Chen notes that these critics nevertheless rarely evinced “any curiosity regarding the subject matter, author, or origin” of the actual story Mao Dun was critiquing. Chen, by contrast, is deeply curious about Zhou’s original story, together with the historical context within which it was produced and received. In particular, he brings Zhou’s text into dialogue with one of Mao Dun’s own subsequent explorations of tragic love in the short story “Creation” (1928), and considers both texts in the context of the 1920s literary polemics wherein Mao Dun and Zhou Shoujuan staked out their respective positions, concluding that Zhou’s and Mao Dun’s significance as representatives of so-called old and new literature were in fact symbiotically dependent on one another. While Jianhua Chen looks at the movement of popular and elite themes between texts from the same period, Michael Berry examines the movement of similar themes from the early twentieth century to the contemporary period. Considering two late twentieth century novels both set in 1937, Berry details how the works not only borrowed from popular early twentieth century romance and martial-arts genres, but also incorporated a wealth of detailed allusions to more “elite” literature as well. The resulting allusive patchwork might be seen as a form of self-legitimization, or as a popularization of elite culture itself, wherein fragments of elite culture are stripped from their original cultural moorings and incorporated into a selfconsciously hybrid genre. Like Berry, Ping-hui Liao examines the ways in which Butterfly thematics and narrative structures have been appropriated and redeployed in contemporary works from Taiwan. Although Wang Wenxing and Shi Shuqing are both conventionally regarded as elite authors, Liao nevertheless demonstrates how they each systematically reappropriate romantic conventions commonly associated with early twentieth century Butterfly fiction, transforming those conventions to suit the needs and concerns of contemporary society. In\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nparticular, Liao argues that both authors transfigure the trademark Butterfly thematics of romantic affection into something “perverse, grotesque, and uncanny.” Romantic attachments in these works typically result in “pathological situations in which the protagonists are forced to act out traumas in a mode of neurotic repetition compulsion or state fetishism,” projecting their desires first onto the figure of the ethnic Other, and eventually onto the abstract figure of Capital itself. Liao concludes by detailing how similar permutations of Butterfly romance formulas can also be found in modern advertising culture, arguing that many contemporary Taipei subway ads present shopping as a process of withdrawal from the politicized public sphere into a variety of intimate spheres—spheres, however, that are not really intimate at all, but rather are thoroughly colonized by transnational capital. Although the canon—seen as the product of a gradual accretion of institutional, aesthetic, and political preferences—is frequently associated with tradition and antiquity, in early twentieth century China there was also an inverse tendency for emerging canons to align themselves with modernity and reform. During the contemporary period, meanwhile, popular culture has come to be associated with nostalgia and amnesia—nostalgia for the cultural traditions of the early nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, combined with a selective amnesia toward various facets of that same history. The following three essays examine the ways in which cultural works from the 1990s have not only positioned themselves with respect to their own past, but have also implicitly attempted to theorize the concept of temporality itself. A wave of amnesiac nostalgia swept through Mainland China in the 1990s—a nostalgia for the cultural traditions of the Maoist and the pre-Maoist period paradoxically combined with an inverse effort to forget many of the specific political connotations of that same period. Through a detailed analysis of a variety of literary and visual works from this period, Dai Jinhua argues that this wave of Red nostalgia paradoxically constitutes an “excision of the socialist historical memory of the 1950s to the 1970s, combined with the purging of the bloody revolutionary dimensions of the 1930s Red historical narrative,” thereby allowing 1990s China to “safely link up with the imaginary ‘history’ represented by 1930s Shanghai.” What is at stake in this process of nostalgic displacement, furthermore, is not only a desire to elide the historical legacy of the intervening Maoist era, but equally importantly an attempt to recontextualize the Maoist Red Classics that emerged from that same period, tacitly reconciling them with the concerns and ideals of the current era. The fin-de-siècle nostalgia that swept China in the 1990s extended not only to the Maoist and May Fourth eras, but also to the late Qing era that preceded them. Focusing on Tsui Hark’s 1990s Once Upon a Time in China (and America) film series, Weijie Song examines how the protagonist, the legendary late nineteenth century martial-arts hero Wong Fei-hung, provides an interesting counterpoint to contemporary concerns about the status of\n\n8\n\nCarlos Rojas\n\nChinese identity. The historical Wong Fei-hung lived during a period when Western imperialism was challenging China’s sovereignty, and Weijie Song suggests that Tsui Hark uses Wong to comment allegorically on China’s ongoing attempts to reassess its position and significance within an increasingly globalized world. Finally, on a more intimate level, Xiaojue Wang takes the highly personal nostalgia found in Eileen Chang’s photo-essay Mutual Reflections: Reading Old Photographs (1994)—the last work Chang published before her death the following year—as the basis for a broader discussion of Chang’s conflicted relationship with her own public persona. While Chang was writing most of her major works during the 1940s and 1950s, she was regarded primarily as a popular author, and it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that she was figuratively brought into the canon—first by literary scholars working abroad, and then eventually by scholars in China as well. Chang’s transformation from a quintessentially popular writer to one of the most critically acclaimed Chinese authors of the twentieth century (who, nevertheless, remained exceedingly “popular” among her devoted readers) was complicated by her ambivalent attitude toward her own fame. A central theme in Chang’s autobiographical Mutual Reflections, accordingly, is precisely this tension between self-presentation and self-occlusion, between Chang’s public persona as an author and the private life she continued to protect so possessively. Underlying the issue of the relationship between her public and private identity, furthermore, is the related question of how she remembers her own life, and how she would like to be publicly remembered. Named after a metaphor for conjugal harmony, Butterfly fiction has, from the very beginning, been explicitly associated with issues of gender and desire. At the same time, however, the figure of the butterfly also functions as a metaphor for self-transformation—underscoring the fluid nature, not only of gender identity, but also of the categories of canonical and popular culture themselves. In the final three essays in this volume, we examine cultural production through this lens of gender—not in order to reduce canonical or popular culture to rigid gender stereotypes, but rather precisely to examine how individual works themselves implicitly attempt to theorize gender and desire as structuring paradigms for understanding the dynamics of popularity itself. If one important factor underlying the production of the popular is, as I have suggested above, a fear of popular culture’s inherent power, a parallel consideration is precisely the desire for that power, and by extension for the specific texts and genres associated with that power. Taking his inspiration from Lu Xun’s well-known critique of China’s theatrical tradition of female impersonation, David Der-wei Wang examines the trope of transvestitism in the 1943 novel Begonia by prominent Butterfly author Qin Shouou, whom Wang suggests can be seen as “a Butterfly writer assuming a May Fourth discursive posture.” Focusing on the figure of a Peking Opera performer who specializes in female roles and his\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nstruggles to achieve real “manhood,” Qin’s novel grapples with issues of gender performance and sexual desire, together with the way in which transvestitism comes to function as an ironic figure for national identity. Wang argues that Qin’s protagonist represents the Chinese nation, while at the same time embodying deep-rooted anxieties about the very possibility of that sort of (national) representation itself. In the following essay, Hsiao-hung Chang returns to the topic of Jin Yong’s martial-arts fiction, previously discussed in Chris Hamm’s essay in this volume. While Hamm focuses on the shifting institutional status of Jin Yong’s works, however, Chang’s approach is very explicitly textual. Inspired by Jin Yong’s repeated citation of the Yuan dynasty poet Yuan Haowen’s rhetorical question, “Asking the world, what sort of thing is sentiment?”, Chang examines Jin Yong’s use of a series of fetishized objects in two of his novels to explore a dynamics of desire and attachment. Drawing on anthropological theories of gift exchange and psychoanalytic notions of investment and displacement, Chang analyzes the relationship between sentiment, materiality, and exchange in the two works, and concludes that “the history that one carries on one’s body, and the memory that one witnesses with one’s own eyes, are both transformed into a desire for objects that one can actually touch.” Finally, Chang applies these conclusions about the workings of desire and attachment to a consideration of Jin Yong’s novels themselves —arguing that the texts function as material displacements of the cultural histories that they invoke. In the final essay, meanwhile, I consider a cluster of contemporary works that examine, and themselves exemplify, the tensions between the establishment’s apparent fear of cultural production that it perceives to be unorthodox, together with the public’s desire for these works. This dialectics of fear and desire is developed particularly clearly, for instance, in Mo Yan’s 1993 novel Republic of Wine, which revolves around an epistolary dialogue between an established author (also named Mo Yan) who finds himself increasingly frustrated in his efforts to complete his ongoing novel, and an enthusiastic fan named Li Yidou who keeps sending the fictional Mo Yan drafts of short stories in the hope that the senior author will help get them published. In the end, however, the fictional Mo Yan ends up abandoning his own work-in-progress, and then effectively steps into the inchoate textual space associated with his enthusiastic fan. The novel’s conclusion, therefore, represents a process wherein the literary establishment is figuratively consumed by the same extracanonical cultural forces that it was attempting to regulate in the first place—a cannibalistic gesture that is reinforced by the explicit fascination with the trope of cannibalism that we find in several of the literary works embedded within Mo Yan’s novel itself, including both the fictional Mo Yan’s work-in-progress as well as several of Li Yidou’s short-story drafts. Given this centrality of a thematics of cannibalism within the novel, it is therefore fitting that a crucial figure in the debates over literary value between the fictional Mo Yan and his errant acolyte\n\n10\n\nCarlos Rojas\n\nLi Yidou is none other than Lu Xun—whose 1918 short story “Diary of a Madman” famously established cannibalism as one of the most enduring symbols of imperial China’s self-destructive social ideology. Lu Xun’s conceit of an ideological cannibalism that is passed down via canonical Confucian texts, and his subsequent concept of a disease of canonicity that is similarly transmitted through the Confucian canon, figuratively come together at the end of his “Reading Canon” essay, where Lu Xun develops an elaborate metaphor of a malignantly cannibalistic immune system and benign intestinal bacteria. Here, Lu Xun compares the ossifying effects of traditional literary and ideological canons to the accumulation of waste elements in the body as it ages, which is exacerbated by a process wherein the immune system’s white blood cells (monocytes) migrate into the body’s tissue and differentiate into macrophages that begin cannibalistically “devouring all [of the body’s own] tissue” (tunshi ge zuzhi ). Lu Xun then concludes that “in order to eliminate these macrophages (literally ‘big chewing cells’—dajue xibao ), it is necessary to take a daily dose of acid.” In this medical metaphor, Lu Xun describes an immune system that not only fails to protect the body from foreign pathogens, but furthermore threatens to devour the body itself from within.6 His rather cryptic suggestion that these cannibalistic macrophages may be eliminated through the ingestion of a daily dose of acid, meanwhile, alludes explicitly to Russian microbiologist and Nobel laureate Elie Metchnikoff ’s recommendation—in his 1908 study The Prolongation of Life: Optimistic Studies—that human longevity could be significantly increased though the regular ingestion of lactic acid-producing bacteria (which may then help control the growth of other bacteria in the intestines).7 The paradox here is that, even as Lu Xun describes how the immune system’s white blood cells may stray from the task of attacking foreign microbes and instead consume the body’s own tissue, he simultaneously recommends that the subject consume more foreign bacteria. This double process of consumption—in which the Self is consumed as though it were an Other, even as a foreign Other is consumed and incorporated into the Self–challenges the underlying concepts of identity and alterity upon which the very notion of cannibalism is grounded. In cultural terms, Lu Xun’s immune system metaphor in the “Reading Canon” essay suggests that an antiquated canon has the potential to stray from its presumptive role of protecting the integrity of the body politic against heterodox elements (both internal and external), and instead become a cannibalistic force that can only be addressed through a dose of “foreign” May Fourth reformist literature.8 Ironically, Lu Xun’s solution to this canonical cannibalism—the ingestion of lactic acid-producing bacteria that then reside in the intestine—is itself implicitly cannibalistic in nature, just as Lu Xun’s May Fourth literature attempted to incorporate the institutional legitimacy associated with the classical canon, as well as the popular appeal of the Butterfly literature against which it was attempting to position itself. We may speak, therefore, of the cannibalizations of the canon—both in the sense of\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthe canon’s attempts to cannibalistically consume various aspects of the popular and orthodox cultural traditions against which it seeks to contrast itself, as well as in the inverse sense of the canon’s own susceptibility to being cannibalistically consumed and reappropriated by rival cultural formations. Lu Xun’s immunological metaphor implies that culture (both popular and elite) may function as a cannibalistic force capable of devouring the body politic from within, or as a figurative antibody facilitating a process of social transformation and reform. The very concept of cannibalism, furthermore, implies an affirmation of shared identity between the entities being consumed and those doing the consuming, though the conceptual violence of the cannibalistic act necessarily brings that structure of identification into question. Applied to the cultural arena, this model suggests that neither popular nor canonical culture are ever the homogeneous categories they might aspire to be, but rather both are continually evolving and feeding off of each other. In English, culture can refer not only to the body of aesthetic and intellectual texts through which a society’s values and ideals are cultivated and transmitted, but also to the cultivation of potential harmful microbes in an artificial environment outside the body. Although this latter, microbiological significance of the English term is not explicitly present in the Chinese term for culture, wenhua , it does nevertheless capture quite precisely a crucial dimension of the vision of Chinese cultures and canons that we are developing here. During the early twentieth century, both popular and traditional (canonical) culture were viewed as having potentially infectious qualities, and one of the goals of reformers was to isolate the active agents of each and cultivate them—as though in a virtual petri dish—into a new literary and cultural canon that Lu Xun hoped would be capable of “curing” the national spirit. At the same time, however, Lu Xun’s own immunesystem metaphor unwittingly illustrates the degree to which even this new canon has the potential of becoming a virulent, “cannibalistic” disease in its own right, thereby inviting new gestures of “cultivation” and cannibalistic appropriation. It is precisely the resulting symbiosis of popular and canonical culture’s mutual cultivation and consumption that is the focus of Rethinking Chinese Popular Culture.\n\nNotes 1 Lu Xun , “Shisi nian de dujing” (The reading canon of the 14th year [of the Republic] ) (1925), in Huagai ji (Unlucky star), 1926.

Metchnikoff ’s discovery of the role of phagocytosis in the immune system was described in detail by Chen Duxiu in a 1916 essay in the flagship May Fourth journal Xin qingnian (New youth), and during that same period was immediately mobilized as a metaphor for society by Hu Shi, Lu Xun, as well as Chen Duxiu himself. For a discussion, see Carlos Rojas, “Cannibalism and the Chinese Body Politic: Hermeneutics and Violence in Cross-Cultural Perception,” Postmodern Culture 12: 3 (May, 2002). Here, Lu Xun is conflating Metchnikoff ’s recommendation on the elimination of white blood cell macrophages, with his separate recommendation that lactic acid bacteria can then help raise the acidity level of the intestinal tract, thereby inhibiting the growth of most other microorganisms, including many human pathogens. Not only were Lu Xun and many other May Fourth authors strongly influenced by foreign literary traditions from Japan and Europe, but furthermore Lu Xun himself concludes the “Reading Canon” essay by noting the irony that his immunesystem metaphor is itself borrowed from a “foreign” source (i.e., from the Russian scientist Elie Metchnikoff ).\n\nPart I\n\nProducing popularity\n\n1\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons The Friday School in modern Chinese literature Michel Hockx\n\nRecent articles and studies have unveiled the variety of literary practices on the cultural scene in the Shanghai of the 1930s.1 The rediscovery of often forgotten groups and individuals has cast serious doubt on the tenability of existing analytical schemes, which discuss the literary history of this period in terms of a binary opposition between “progressive” and “reactionary” writing, or between the so-called “May Fourth tradition” and its avowed nemesis: popular literature. This essay hopes to show that, although members of the May Fourth generation active as critics in the 1930s continued to express their familiar dissatisfaction with writing they considered in bad taste or unenlightened, there is no reason for scholars nowadays to share these critics’ judgments of taste. In short, this essay tries to turn a well-known argument on its head: rather than assuming that the May Fourth generation represented an actively repressive mainstream of serious writing which “suppressed” popular literature, I argue that, even in the 1930s, this generation was using strategies for gaining symbolic capital within the literary field that are more in line with those typically applied by an avant-garde that considers itself to be suppressed. As a result, it will emerge that the forgotten writers and practices introduced in the main body of this essay did not have much affinity with popular literature at all, but can rather be seen to continue an indigenous moral-aesthetic disposition. These writings and practices were at some time referred to by the term Friday School (Libaiwu pai ). Friday School was a disparaging label, invented by critics writing for the newspaper supplement Ziyou tan (Free talk) to refer to writers perceived to be operating on the borderline between the New Literature and the so-called Saturday School (Libailiu pai ). In other words, their writing and behavior were considered dangerously close to a kind of literary activity that lacked seriousness, propagated outdated moral values, and was aimed predominantly at entertainment. For many decades, the existence of this “school” has been virtually forgotten or ignored in modern Chinese literary studies. The main reason for this has undoubtedly been a political one: the Friday School had an unfortunate run-in with critics associated with the League of Left-Wing\n\n16\n\nMichel Hockx\n\nWriters, including Lu Xun (1881–1936). One of the aims of this essay is to show that the quarrel between these two groups had originally nothing to do with politics, but was eventually given a politicized interpretation by members of both camps. The politicized interpretation being the most straightforward one, it survived and is still surviving in general literary histories and reference works. The real reason why critics like Lu Xun, and also Mao Dun (1896–1981), attacked the Friday School was, I argue, because the styles of the Friday School violated and possibly threatened the legacy of New Culture, in which Lu Xun and Mao Dun had invested so heavily during the previous decade. Their objections to the Friday School at first sight appear to be of a moral, more than of an aesthetic, nature, as their arguments rarely relate to elements of writing, but rather to elements of behavior and personality. However, I would argue that even this approach relies too much on distinctions created by the writers and critics themselves as part of their agency within the literary field. In order to understand the events more fully, I would like to consider the possibility of interpreting both the moral and political aspects of the debate as part of an ultimately aesthetic distinction, this being a distinction between the New Literature and some of its possible alternatives. In approaching my topic in this manner, I am consciously attempting to circumvent a currently popular line of thinking according to which styles such as those of the Friday School were already “repressed” by the New Literature tradition (in that context usually referred to as the May Fourth tradition) even before the canonization of that tradition in 1949. As the essay will show, the extremely harsh criticism levied at the Friday School by critics in the early 1930s never amounted to any oppression at the time. There is no empirical evidence to suggest that the Friday School was at any time considerably less successful than its opponents—and I use the term “successful” here not only with regard to economic capital, but also with regard to symbolic capital. Moreover, the Friday School was, on occasion, equally capable of silencing New Literature voices. In short, what I intend to provide in this essay is an exercise in literary history which views all practices involved as constituents of modern Chinese literature, without making any a priori assumptions about supposed centers or mainstreams. It is important to state at the outset that, although I am interested in reviving the individuals and writings categorized under the term Friday School, it is not my intention to reinstate the label itself, or to claim that there was indeed a coherent group of writers operating under this name. The term pai (“school” or “clique”) is often used in modern Chinese criticism to express a disparaging opinion. The fact that a pai-style label was at some point invented2 demonstrates that a strategic effort was undertaken by rivaling critics to polarize against the writers involved. As such, this essay is also a case study in strategic behavior, from a vantage point inspired by the late Pierre Bourdieu’s analysis of literary fields.\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 17 Below, I first look more closely at various critical strategies common to the literary field under investigation here and relevant to my argument. After that, the bulk of the essay will be devoted to an overview of the practices of the Friday School and its clashes with the May Fourth-generation critics.\n\nRepublican-era literary thought and the notion of normative form One of the reasons why the now canonical authors and critics of New Literature have been described as oppressive lies in the remarkable aggressiveness of their critical writings, particularly with respect to their critiques of more entertainment-oriented popular literature and culture. These critiques are often characterized by a total dismissal of the works or writers in question, and a lack of willingness to debate literary details. This ad hominem style of literary criticism remained common practice throughout the Republican period. This, in itself, is already sufficient to cast doubt on the dominant status of New Literature in its own time, since this style of criticism is not generally characteristic of any literary establishment, but rather of the avant-garde. In modern European literary history, criticizing the establishment for having squandered its allegiance to purely literary values and therefore focusing one’s critique of the establishment on non-literary issues and couching it in personal or abusive terms, is a recognized strategy in the quest for symbolic capital. As I have argued elsewhere,3 the literary field of twentieth-century China was characterized by the fact that pledging allegiance to the symbolic principle meant to polarize oneself not only against the economic principle (writing for money) but also against the political principle (writing for some collective non-literary purpose).4 Some of the earliest examples of attacks by New Literature critics on popular literature can be described in these terms. For instance, critics belonging to the Literary Association, when writing about the “Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School” (yuanyang hudie pai ), highlighted the commercial aspect of their practice, by referring to them as wengai (beggars of letters) or wenchang (whores of letters), rather than wenren (men of letters). Around the same time, the Creation Society’s initial attacks on the Literary Association focused on the opponent’s alleged factionalism (dangtong fayi ), arguing that the Association valued allegiance to its collective more than allegiance to literature. In both cases, the attacking side placed itself in the avant-garde position, claiming superior knowledge of and devotion to literature, while the opponent was regarded as the establishment that monopolized the means of literary production and distribution. However, whereas the debates between the Literary Association and the Creation Society eventually abated as the New Literature sphere developed and grew, the abusive criticism of entertainment fiction, or indeed any kind of literature deemed to cater too explicitly to a large readership, remained\n\n18\n\nMichel Hockx\n\na constant element of modern Chinese literary criticism throughout the Republican period. Apart from the commercial dimension, there was also a moral dimension to New Literature’s differences with entertainment writing. After all, reaching a large readership as such was an ideal cherished by many groups within the New Literature community as well. Commercialism only became a serious problem, and a target for attack, if it was considered to be spreading moral values at odds with something I would call—for lack of a better word— modernity. Moreover, critics were convinced that there was a direct connection between writing and personality, very much in line with the critical ideals of traditional Chinese literature, as described by Stephen Owen: Throughout the Chinese literary tradition, as in certain phases of Western literature, readers identified the style or manner of the text with the personality of its author. Although current literary opinion considers such an identification misguided, the truth or falsity of the identification is less important than the fact that both readers and writer took it to be true. The powerful intuition of personality in style was a historical fact and a deeply held value.5 The New Literature critics, like their traditional predecessors, believed that the moral fiber of an author could be recognized in “the style or manner of the text.” As a result, critical boundaries were drawn that precluded, both on aesthetic and on moral grounds, the continuity of, for instance, classical language and classical literary forms in modern writing. In poetry, to name but one example, there was to be no free verse in wenyan (literary Chinese), and no continued employment of classical Chinese prosodies in the way in which Western poets have always continued to use the sonnet. Within this critical mindset, New Literature is not synonymous with “modern literature,” i.e., it is not an indicator of any and all literature of the modern period. Instead, New Literature of the Republican period is best described as a ti or “normative form,” i.e., one particular type of writing amongst other, rivaling types, and a type of writing that says something about the author’s commitment to modernity as a whole (i.e., not merely aesthetic modernity). The boundaries of the normative form that is Republican-era New Literature are not easy to define. They do not just include aspects of vernacular (baihua ) language and Europeanized grammar, but also other textual aspects, such as punctuation, and even contextual aspects such as the style of the illustrations or advertisements printed around the text, and in some cases even the price of the publication. They also contain nontextual aspects—aspects of habitus—which are even harder to define, but will surface at various stages in this essay. One way to help define the boundaries of the normative form is to study the reactions of adherents to that form when confronted with styles that were disrespectful of those boundaries, crossing borders between Old and New,\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 19 elite and popular, and producing “incorrect” combinations of those various styles.6 However, this does not mean that my study of the Friday School is ultimately only aimed at a better understanding of New Literature (although that is the overall perspective of my current research). Instead, I hope to demonstrate that the reverse perspective is equally applicable, and that Friday School writers and critics responded with similar outrage to what they considered to be the transgressions of their own norms. As will emerge in the conclusion of this essay, I consider the Friday School, despite all its similarities to popular literature and entertainment writing, to represent a coherent aesthetic alternative to New Literature, an alternative which valued personal rather than textual qualities and which, exactly for that reason, remains difficult for scholars and critics to accept. Now, however, it is time to take a closer look at the writers, publications, and activities that I believe were associated with the Friday School.\n\nThe Friday School: journals and activities Truth, Beauty and Goodness Perhaps the earliest publication that has been associated with the Friday School is the journal Zhen mei shan (Truth, beauty and goodness), edited by father and son Zeng Pu (1872–1935) and Zeng Xubai (1895–1994) from 1927–1931. Starting out as a two-man publication, featuring in each issue an installment of the sequel to Zeng Pu’s Nie hai hua (Flowers in a sea of sin), the journal gradually developed into a wellfilled, semi-commercial magazine, with separate issues often running more than 200 pages. Mainly through the efforts of Zeng Xubai, the journal became more and more oriented toward writing (and translation) in the modern vernacular. The literary orientation of the group around the Zeng family has been described by Leo Ou-fan Lee as “Francophile,” with most of its contributors having lived in France or being fascinated by French literature and art.7 Despite their interest in aestheticism, decadence, and other cultural propensities that would seem to be limited to small cultural elites, the journal itself looks aimed at a much wider audience. The editors’ interest in reader participation is demonstrated, for instance, by their establishment of a “readers’ forum,” and eventually even a “readers’ club.” Another important connection of the journal to more popular styles, and to the Friday School, is through their regular contributor Zhang Ruogu (1903?–1960?), who edited for the journal a hotly debated special issue on women writers, about which I will say more below.8 Tea Talk A year or so after the folding of Truth, Beauty and Goodness, a somewhat similar group, also including a number of returned students from France, began\n\n20\n\nMichel Hockx\n\nholding meetings in Shanghai every Sunday under the name “Literature and Art Tea Talk Meeting” (wenyi chahua hui ). After the seventh meeting, the group came out with its own journal, entitled Wenyi chahua (Literature and art tea talk; hereafter Tea Talk). The first editor of the journal was Zhang Yiping (1902–1946), but his involvement with the group was relatively short-lived. From all accounts it appears that the three main motivators of the group, which continued to meet weekly and publish its journal monthly from 1932 to 1934, were Xu Zhongnian (1904–1981), Hua Lin (1889–1980), and Sun Fuxi (1898–1962). All three of them had studied in France, Hua and Sun specializing in art, whereas Xu obtained a Ph.D. in literature from the University of Lyon. Perhaps the most respected and revered member of the group, however, was the famous (1887–1958). Liu Yazi The Tea Talk meetings appear to have been relatively informal gatherings, where members could read or show new work to each other, engage in discussion, or give humorous speeches. Their critical statements about other members’ work would be predominantly concerned with the personality and personal life of the author or artist. Although difficult to ascertain, it is likely that part of the content of the journal Tea Talk consisted of texts and reproductions of paintings produced during or for the meetings. In a few cases, records of meetings, illustrated with pictures, were also published in the journal. Attendance to the meetings would vary, with one of the largest meetings probably being the 73rd tea talk of November 12, 1933, which was commemorated with an official group picture of the 34 participants, published in the December 1933 issue of the journal. A relatively large number of women would usually be present at the meetings, and the female membership of the Tea Talk group was certainly larger than that of any other literary group at the time. The male members of the Tea Talks considered female presence part of the necessary atmosphere for their gatherings, and in their writings they often referred to the pleasure of having ladies (in most cases their partners) 9 present. The female presence was far from merely cosmetic, however, as many of the female participants were themselves active as writers and/or artists, and the contributions by female authors and artists to the journal Tea Talk were numerous and varied. Nevertheless, male members tended to emphasize gender issues in the context of the meetings, and their attitude towards the female members was one of lingering superiority, mixed with romanticstyle gallantry and defiance of gender-related social conventions. As Wu Fuhui perceptively observes, however, the social critique was often a mere veneer for the urge to write about sex.10 Writing poetry was a favorite activity of many members of the group. The content of their journal features poetry in a wide variety of styles, ranging from traditional lyrics (ci ) to vernacular free verse. The April 1934 issue was devoted in full to the memory of the poet Liu Dabai , who\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 21 had died two years earlier and whose posthumous writings had been collected by another active member of the Tea Talk group, Zhong Jingwen (1903–2002). A number of the contributions to that issue point out Liu Dabai’s interest in poetic form, and his ability to write in every possible style, including the new style, making his work in some sense exemplary for the aspirations of many of the members of the Tea Talk group.11 The group’s prose writing, as found in the pages of its journal, is difficult to categorize under any single normative form, but appears relatively less indebted to tradition. Although the genre of xiaopinwen , favored by many contributors to the journal, was a genre with traditional roots, it was theorized in an article by Xu Zhongnian in relation to the modern genre of prose poetry.12 Similarly, when Liu Yazi published a short autobiography in the journal, he pointed out that he had originally written something in the classical xingshu style, but had changed it into something more modern (in the vernacular) on the advice of his son. The journal also contained short fiction (mainly but not exclusively love stories), essays, and criticism, and some articles introducing members of the group to the readership. Apart from Tea Talk, another journal related to this group is Yifeng (Art style) (1933–1936), which is very similar in appearance to Tea Talk and features many of the same contributors, but is almost exclusively devoted to art. Another related publication, which I have not consulted so far, is the China Daily News supplement, Miluo zhoukan (Miluo weekly), edited by Hua Lin, Xu Zhongnian, Li Baoquan and Tianlu (ps. Huang Tianpeng ). The establishment of this supplement was advertised in the first issue of Tea Talk, under the slogan: “Elevate love through literature and art, beautify life through love” (Yi wenyi tigao aiqing, yi aiqing meihua rensheng , ). Finally, I have found scattered references to a newspaper supplement or journal entitled Xiao gongxian (Little contribution), edited by Sun Fuxi, which may have contained further reports of Tea Talk meetings. The journal Tea Talk folded after two juan of ten issues each, in the early summer of 1934. In the final issue, Xu Zhongnian promised that something new and “big” would come in its place, but it is not clear what that was, and whether it ever materialized. Whether or not the Tea Talk meetings continued in Shanghai after the folding of the journal is also unclear. The Chinese branch of the International PEN Perhaps the most revealing example of how post-1949 canonization processes have completely reversed the original distribution of symbolic capital in the modern Chinese literary field, is the fact that the Chinese branch of the highly prestigious International PEN has sunk almost totally into academic oblivion. Fortunately, there now exists a superbly researched article by Chen Zishan , which minutely details all the activities of the branch, and on which the cursory overview below is based.13\n\n22\n\nMichel Hockx\n\nThe first Chinese member of the International PEN was Liang Qichao , who was awarded an honorary membership in 1923. On November 16, 1930, however, an official Chinese PEN branch was established and henceforth represented at International PEN meetings in Europe. The first president of the branch was Cai Yuanpei , who was supported by Ge Gongzhen as secretary, and the famous poet Shao Xunmei as treasurer.14 The membership of the branch consisted by and large of literary figures associated with four better-known collectives, some of which were no longer in existence at the time. They were: the Literary Association (Wenxue yanjiu hui ), represented by its former key members Zheng Zhenduo , Zhao Jingshen , and Luyin ; the Crescent Moon society, represented by Xu Zhimo and Hu Shi ; the group around the journal Lunyu (The analects), most notably Lin Yutang himself; and the Truth, Beauty and Goodness group, including Zeng Pu and Zeng Xubai. The branch meetings were also attended by members of the Tea Talk group and others associated with the Friday School, including Wang Lixi , Zhang Kebiao, Zhang Ruogu, Zhang Yiping, Zeng Jinke , and Yu Xiuyun . Before his untimely death in 1931, Xu Zhimo was the main motivator of the branch, and was even planning to publish a branch magazine. In accordance with its constitution, the branch held monthly dinner parties in Shanghai, and pledged not to discuss politics, an attitude that it maintained even after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Both its political stance and its practice of gathering at dinner parties were scorned by members of the League of Left-Wing Writers, which was founded in the same year and considered the branch a “bourgeois organization.” When the branch entertained fellow PEN member George Bernard Shaw at dinner in February 1933, however, the chairman of the Left League, Lu Xun, did make an appearance, although his report of the event is highly satirical.15 Between 1930–1933, the branch was relatively active in terms of social gatherings and entertaining foreign visitors. After 1933 it led a dormant existence until 1935, when it was briefly revived, again under the leadership of Cai Yuanpei, until the outbreak of the War of Resistance. One of the most regular attendants of the Chinese PEN meetings in the early 1930s was Zeng Jinke,16 whose career as a writer apparently took off as a direct result of his involvement with the branch, as is explained by Zeng himself in the preface to his first collection of short stories: Because members of the PEN must have published works, I cannot but force myself to print these few short stories. It’s really a funny thing: the members of the PEN in all countries of the world have all joined after they had published works, but I have had no option but to publish this collection of short stories exactly because I have joined the PEN as a member.17\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 23 Apart from attending the meetings, Zeng also regularly reported on them in his journal Xin shidai (The new era), the main journal associated with the Friday School. Zeng Jinke and The New Era It is somewhat of a mystery how precisely Zeng Jinke arrived on the literary scene in Shanghai, since biographical materials for the earlier part of his life are relatively scarce. In the late 1920s, he emerged in Shanghai as the manager of a short-lived publishing house called the Malaya Bookstore (Malai shudian ). In the summer of 1931, he founded The New Era Monthly, published by the newly established New Era Bookstore. The almost immediate success of The New Era on the Shanghai literary market was, in my view, due to Zeng Jinke’s excellent ability to find the right “market niche” for his new publication. Zeng Jinke’s introduction to the first issue announces contributions by two of the most popular New Literature authors of the time: Ba Jin and Zhang Ziping . These two authors are now commonly seen as representing two very different, almost opposed, literary styles. However, Zeng appears to have been on good terms with both of them. He frequently quotes from correspondence with Ba Jin, or recounts meetings with him, in later issues of The New Era.18 Zeng himself was a regular contributor to the journals associated with Zhang Ziping. Before long, The New Era published works by the majority of well-known authors on the Shanghai scene. The New Era also attracted authors associated with the “Beijing School,” including Shen Congwen , as well as rising stars like the poets Zang Kejia , He Qifang and Bian Zhilin . The core contributors to the journal, however, were the same figures from literature and art circles who also frequented the Tea Talk and PEN meetings. The New Era contributed significantly to establishing the public image of these writers, and of writers in general, not only by keeping its readers informed of their recent works, but also by providing extensive information on their personal lives in a monthly section in the back of each issue called “Wentan xiaoxi” (News from the literary scene). This section of The New Era was usually some ten pages long and would contain a few dozen items. Such sections give a good indication of the extent to which literary figures had become objects of interest for a much wider audience than merely the intellectual elite. On the other hand, they also indicate that knowledge of writers’ lives was considered necessary background knowledge for appreciating their works. After all, “Writers’ news” sections were common in many New Literature journals: Mao Dun (then still using the name Shen Yanbing ) ran one in The Short Story Monthly in the 1920s, Shi Zhecun had his Yiwen qingbao (Art and literature intelligence) in Xiandai (Les Contemporains), and even a specialized publishing journal like Zhongguo xin shu yuebao (China new books monthly)\n\n24\n\nMichel Hockx\n\n(1930–1932) devoted much space to news about writers. Although self-styled high-profile journals like The Short Story Monthly and Les Contemporains tended to limit their news to foreign literary scenes (copying, no doubt, from similar gossip columns in Western journals), in all journals the news reported is often of a personal nature and has little to do with the work of the author in question. The personality-based view of literature, though rooted in traditional Chinese cultural dispositions, found a specifically modern and popular corollary in 1930s Shanghai, in the form of media interest in authors’ private lives, tabloid journalism, and self-promotion. Although Zeng Jinke was skillful in dealing with these aspects of literary practice, it is important to emphasize that he and others in his group had more in common with the New Literature community than with any other literary communities. They certainly perceived themselves as practitioners of New Literature, and were initially perceived as such by others in the field. They had no interest in or associations with, and were at times critical of, the people and publications of the “Saturday School.” The way in which Zeng Jinke criticized one such publication, the then recently founded journal Hongye (Red leaves), edited by Xu Xiaotian ,19 is not very dissimilar from the typical criticism of popular literature that we find in all New Literature journals: What kind of journal is Red Leaves? The facts will tell us. The Saturday and Red Rose were silly journals, so Red Leaves will surely be even sillier. The reason why it can exist and why it sells is that there are still many silly people in society: some businessmen, old wives and concubines, as well as some young gentlemen and misses, hoodlums and prostitutes. Those people are rooted in a certain era, so they love to read journals that are rooted in the same era. It is not surprising that they call The New Era a silly thing. So who is silly and who isn’t? Justice will prevail in the end.20 There were other ways in which Zeng Jinke’s style of running The New Era conformed with the seriousness that characterized the New Literature working style. Perhaps the strongest point of the whole enterprise was his very professional attitude towards the running of the journal. Already in the first issue, he issued a promise that The New Era would come out on the first of each month without any delays. This was the kind of promise made by countless new journals at the time, but one which very few indeed were able to keep. Zeng, however, did keep his promise, turning The New Era into one of the most consistently appearing, and one of the longestlived journals of the early 1930s.21 Zeng cleverly kept reminding his readers of this considerable achievement in various editorials throughout the period. Zeng also seems to have had an excellent sense of the balance between literary and political forces needed to gain recognition within the New Literature community, i.e., he took care not to associate himself with any\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 25 political party or institution, but he did express concern for pressing political matters. For instance, he stated quite clearly in the opening editorial of the first issue that The New Era had no political background and would not serve the purposes of any “ism.” However, in the fourth issue (November 1931) he opened with a short comment on the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, blaming the Chinese government for its policy of non-resistance, calling upon all Chinese citizens to unite and fight back. He immediately added an apology to his readers for breaking with his principle of “not talking politics,” expressing the hope that they would understand and agree, which I am sure many of them did. In short, Zeng Jinke was a very skillful editor, who turned The New Era, with its attractive mix of serious and slightly less serious content, into a leading literary journal. As we have seen, however, Zeng was himself also a writer, and he used his journal for relentless promotion of his own work, which he was churning out at an incredible speed. After his first collection of short stories, mentioned above, Zeng published five more collections of fiction, two collections of new poetry, one collection of ci lyrics, and two volumes of essays, within the space of exactly two years. His most successful work (both in terms of sales figures and audience response) was probably the sentimental poetry collection Ai de sanbuqu (Love trilogy), which he claimed to be based on a real, sad love affair. Zeng himself, however, appeared most proud of his essay collection Jinke suibi (Jinke’s random jottings), because it was published by the prestigious Beixin bookstore and came out almost simultaneously with new collections by Lu Xun and Bing Xin . Not only did Zeng publish most of this work in his own journal, he was also in the habit of printing rave reviews of his own collections, sent in by sympathetic friends and readers, to which he would then respond with great modesty. A typical example is his statement in the May 1933 issue of The New Era that he will no longer publish any reviews of his own work—a statement that comes appended as a postscript to five positive reviews of his lyrics collection Luohua (Fallen flowers).22 Both Zeng’s fondness of lyrics and his attempts at self-promotion eventually made him an object of criticism. The underlying reasons for the attacks on Zeng in 1933 will be analyzed more closely in the next part of this essay. First, however, there is one more journal left to introduce. Literature and Art Forum The journal Wenyi zuotan (Literature and art forum) was founded by Zeng Jinke in the summer of 1933, in the wake of a number of attacks by various critics on his writings, but especially on his person. He also founded a society by the same name, which was to meet fortnightly for dinner. In the first issue of the journal, Zeng commented on the fact that the PEN branch meetings had stopped, and described his new society as being of a similar nature.23 He listed the founders of the society, which included,\n\n26\n\nMichel Hockx\n\napart from familiar Friday School names, also Zhang Ziping, and even the famous Saturday School writer Hu Huaichen (1886–1938).24 Each issue of Literature and Art Forum numbered only sixteen pages, and the editing and printing do not come across as particularly professional. Part of the content of the journal is devoted to attacks on the League of LeftWing Writers, especially on Lu Xun, about which more below. At the same time, however, the journal also contains a few relatively objective discussions of socialist literary theory and even of Soviet literature, written perhaps with the aim of challenging the Left League’s monopoly on these topics. Of the four issues that appeared,25 the most substantial is the third, a special issue on authors’ lives, with contributions by, among others, Zhao Jingshen, Zang Kejia, and Luyin. The last appears to have been a member of the group, as she appears in a picture of a meeting of the society printed in the February 1934 issue of The New Era.26 It was the debate between the Literature and Art Forum writers and the Left League that served to identify the Friday School (or the “lyricists” [ciren ] as they were also derisively called) as a group that could be collectively labeled. So far in this essay, I have also used that label, for the sake of convenience, in the same way in which scholars have in recent years continued to use the term Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies fiction, in full knowledge of the fact that it represents much more variety than the label can represent. Moreover, the label Friday School, if freed of its negative connotations, does capture nicely what I consider to be the main characteristic of the cultural figures and activities introduced in this section: the fact that they do not fit into any of the binary oppositions established by New Literature critics since the late 1910s. They belong neither completely to New Literature nor to any of its two main opposites—old literature and popular literature, which, in the minds of many New Literature critics, often amounted to the same thing. What the above overview also makes clear, however, is that the Friday School played a much more prominent role in modern Chinese cultural life than is nowadays assumed. When the Friday School clashed with the Left League, therefore, this was not a straightforward case of holders of symbolic power (like Lu Xun) putting some powerless marginal figures (like Zeng Jinke) in their place. Instead, it was an even-handed confrontation between two equally viable aesthetic alternatives, from which no clear “winner” could emerge at the time. In the next part of this essay, I will describe in some detail some of Zeng Jinke’s activities, and the various criticisms thereof, in an attempt to further define the constitutive elements of the aesthetics that he represented, and that were later labeled as “Friday School.”\n\nMaking (Girl-)Friends through Literature Throughout the first two decades of New Literature, the normal strategy employed by new groups entering the literary field was that of polarization\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 27 against the establishment, as it would be in most other literary fields. However, it is remarkable that throughout the 1920s and 1930s, this strategy is very consistently employed by numerous groups by invoking one particular concept, that of the Unknown Author (wuming zuojia , literally “un-famous author” or “nameless author”). In countless manifestos, the Unknown Author is portrayed as an aspiring writer with much talent but few connections, whose eager attempts to get published are constantly frustrated by journal editors who are only interested in buying manuscripts from famous authors. Because of this unfair state of affairs within the publishing world, groups of unknown authors would eventually feel forced to start their own journal or even their own publishing house. They would call upon other victims of the system to join, leading to the establishment of special organizations and publications solely for unknown authors, such as, for instance, the Society of Unknown Authors (wuming zuojia she ) and its journal Wuming zuojia (Unknown authors, founded 1923), together with the United Front of Unknown Authors (wuming zuojia lianhe zhanxian ), announced by the Progress Society (Jin she ) in its organ Bailu (White dew) throughout 1926 and 1927. By the early 1930s, the plight of the Unknown Author had become an issue of debate in literary circles in Shanghai, taking the term beyond its initial strategic usefulness. There was widespread concern about the fact that the quality of the work of established authors was suffering under the pressures put on them by journal editors wanting to buy their manuscripts. There was also widespread acknowledgment of the fact that such editorial behavior violated principles of quality and made it difficult for newcomers without connections to publish work of potentially high quality. Many journals began to include specific statements in their colophons that they welcomed contributions by Unknown Authors. Zhang Ziping’s journal Jieqian even went so far as to publish a special issue in which all contributions were published anonymously, challenging the reader to see if s/he could tell the difference between the works of Known and Unknown Authors.27 Zeng Jinke’s way of dealing with these forces was perhaps even more inventive. In the same opening editorial for the first issue of The New Era in which he proudly announced contributions by many leading authors of the time, he emphasized that his journal would always welcome work sent in by Unknown Authors. A number of letters to the editor published in the next issue demonstrate how grateful many of his readers were for this acknowledgment. Zeng soon made good on this promise by announcing an “Unknown Authors Special Issue,” which appeared as vol. 2, no. 1 in February 1932. He also promised prizes for the best contributions sent in for this issue. When the issue came out, a considerable number of Unknown Authors were published, but the “first prize” was not awarded, a clear indication that Zeng intended to be serious about the aspect of literary quality so central to the whole debate. The special issue also contained\n\n28\n\nMichel Hockx\n\na dozen or so articles by well-known writers commenting on the problem. Interestingly, quite a few of these commentators, including Zeng himself, applied the label Unknown Author to themselves, which is a good illustration of its symbolic potential. In his opening comments to the special issue, Zeng Jinke wrote: I am not a famous person, nor have I ever wanted to possess fame, although I certainly do not lack ways of “becoming famous” and have also had opportunities to “become famous.” I published quite a few works, but my works are as unknown as I am. Naturally I am still an Unknown Author, if I am allowed to call myself an Author at all.28 In the same piece, Zeng mentions that his works and the journals he published had been frequently criticized, but that those who abused (ma ) him in the past, much to his surprise, never pointed out what exactly was wrong with his works. To complicate matters even further, one of the journals in which he was scolded was a publication called Wuming zuojia zhoukan (Unknown authors weekly).29 All this creates the impression that, by the 1930s, the epithet Unknown Author had come to represent much more than just the newcomers in the literary field but was instead a coveted and contended source of power and recognition. Being unknown was one of the best ways to get known.30\n\nWomen writers It is of course possible to regard all these attempts to discover new talent as nothing but a commercial ploy, aimed at creating the illusion that anyone could be a writer, with the ultimate goal of selling more magazines. However, invitations to Unknown Authors to contribute can be seen in so many magazines of the time that I tend to believe that there was a serious concern about the lack of successors to the famous May Fourth generation, as well as about the prolificacy of writers like Ba Jin and Shen Congwen (and the resulting uneven quality of their writing). Finally, I also detect a certain anti-elitism (for lack of a better word) among some members of the Shanghai literary community. As we have seen, many literary figures (especially, but not exclusively, in Zeng Jinke’s circle) found great pleasure and satisfaction in getting involved in literature with a group of good friends, encouraging those who did not previously write to make their debuts as authors. Similarly, Unknown Authors contributing to their journals or salons were all seen as potential friends. Older New Literature writers such as Lu Xun and Mao Dun, who had founded their careers on the opposition to “writing for money” and “writing as pastime,” were suspicious of these ideals, and in their later attacks on Zeng Jinke they would often ridicule Zeng’s style by preceding every personal name with the phrase wo de pengyou (my friend). They\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 29 were similarly suspicious of attempts by the Friday School to involve large numbers of women in their activities.31 This had already become clear in the debate over the “Women Writers Issue” (Nü zuojia hao ) of the journal Truth, Beauty and Goodness. This special issue, which was edited by Zhang Ruogu, came out in February 1929 and sold 3,000 copies in one month, and another 10,000 in the following two years.32 The special issue included works in various genres (mainly modern but also including classical poetry) by more than twenty women writers, including famous ones such as Bing Xin, Luyin, Wu Shutian , and Bai Wei . Every contribution was accompanied by a picture of the author in question, and it was this slightly frivolous touch that, among other things, sparked criticism from New Literature puritans. As Zhang Ruogu pointed out, most of the criticism was aimed at him personally, accusing him of selling sex for commercial gains, or, according to some, for personal favors from the women involved.33 Most critics apparently claimed not to have bothered to read the contents of the special issues, a strategy which we will come across again below.34 Zeng Jinke from time to time ran into similar accusations. He, too, gave ample space in his journals to works by women writers. As was the case with the male members of the Tea Talk group discussed above, Zeng was inclined to draw attention to the gender of these writers, in sometimes ambiguous manners. For instance, Zeng was renowned for the way in which he promoted ( peng ) the poetess Yu Xiuyun, the granddaughter of the rich comprador Yu Qiaqing (the owner of the Xiandai publishing house), whose name often appeared in his “writers’ news” columns, always preceded by the honorific nü shiren (“The Poetess”). Her work also takes up the opening section of a collection entitled Nü pengyoumen de shi (Poems by my lady friends), edited and published by Zeng in 1932.35 The kind of activities described above were frowned upon by the older generation of critics, but they did not launch into full-scale attack until Zeng violated perhaps the greatest taboo of the May Fourth period: attempting to establish a formal continuity between traditional and modern literature.\n\nThe liberation of the lyric In February 1933, The New Era published a special issue devoted to the “liberation” of the time-honored poetic genre of the lyric. The genre had been making something of a comeback, especially among the participants in the Tea Talk meetings. The “movement for the liberation of the lyric” (ci de jiefang yundong ), proudly announced and openly led by Zeng, was an attempt to breathe new life into the genre, by employing modern language and subject matter, while still writing according to the traditional prosodies. Whatever the merits of these ideas may have been, they soon became irrelevant to the critical debate, which came to center exclusively on the following New Lyric by Zeng Jinke:36\n\n30\n\nMichel Hockx New Year Lyrics […] (To the tune “Spring in the Ornate Chamber”37 ) A new year is beginning, the days are getting longer. Guests arrive to comfort me in my despondency. There is nothing wrong with having some diversion for a change. We play some mah-jong. We all drink up the wine in our glass. Affairs of the state, who gives a damn? In front of the wine-vessel there are red dresses, what great fortune! But we must not lose our heads. (To the tune “Song of Divination”) Winter is harsh in the Northeast. Not warmer than here in the South. Even the puppet state is at peace. So why are the “Central Plains” in chaos? “Parliament” has already convened. Saving the nation has become an unsettled question. The lords in session all get official titles. Nobody cares about the national crisis!38\n\nThe topic of the poem is clearly the political situation that had arisen after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. If both poems are read together (as they should be in the ci tradition, which often works with contrasting pairs of poems), the correct patriotic stance of the author is, in my view, obvious.39 The first attack on the poem, and on Zeng, that appeared in Free Talk only a few days later, was indeed unrelated to any political stance and clearly targeted aspects that can be subsumed under the notion of “normative form.” This first critic was Mao Dun, writing under the pseudonym Yangqiu .40 His review of the special issue of The New Era, in which Zeng’s poems had appeared, was written as a mixture of satire and abuse. The critic pretended to be in total awe of the special issue, which had been lent to him by “my friend” Li Liewen (the then-editor of Free Talk). He claimed to have read it from cover to cover—whilst burning incense and drinking tea—in the presence of his wife. This description, I presume, is a satirical reference to the entertainment practices and themes that were traditionally linked with the origins of the ci genre, about which more below. Emphasizing the unseemliness of a modern journal publishing classical poetry, Mao Dun added a sarcastic “(!)” to the title The New Era. He pretended especially to admire the above-mentioned poem by Zeng Jinke (referred to as “Mr Zeng XX”). Unable to maintain the satire near the end of his review, Mao Dun switched to direct abuse, closing his piece with a\n\nPerverse poems and suspicious salons 31 doggerel poem in which he addressed Zeng directly, in lines such as the following: The “era” is new but you hold on to the old, Who gives a damn, who gives a damn! , ! The review illustrates well, I think, the idea of normative form and how it links text and author. For Mao Dun, certain formal aspects of the style and language of Zeng’s poem were sufficient to trigger associations with an entire lifestyle that fell outside the boundaries of modernity, was both conservative and immoral at the same time, and therefore did not deserve serious textual criticism, but only satire and abuse. Zeng Jinke’s rejoinder, published in the March 1933 issue of The New Era, is written in an equally ambivalent critical style. He, too, used an unfamiliar pseudonym,41 Yangchun , based on Mao Dun’s pen-name above. The opening pages of the four-page rejoinder, an open letter to Li Liewen, refrain from abusive arguments, as “Yangchun” points out that anyone would welcome serious criticism of the “liberated lyrics” and the underlying ideas, but that he fails to understand why Free Talk would publish such a malicious review. Closer to the end, however, he, too, loses control and inserts the following highly abusive passage: Mr Liewen! Perhaps it was because your beloved wife recently died of an illness, so that you were in low spirits, failed to pay proper attention, and published the manuscript of “your friend” just like that. However, this is going to harm your publication. Your beloved wife’s soul up in heaven surely also hopes that you do a good job in editing Free Talk […].42 Zeng, in his rejoinder, also referred to the fact that Free Talk had previously been an entertainment literature organ, therefore still had a “bad reputation” (yichou ; literally “lingering bad smell”), and that it was up to Li Liewen to change that. He ended with another reference to Li’s deceased wife, stating that he hoped she would “bless and protect” him and help him to edit his supplement a bit better. It is not surprising that the Free Talk critics were provoked by this rejoinder. Throughout March 1933, six more reviews of Zeng’s liberation of the lyric movement appeared in Free Talk, some of them with added postscripts by “Yangqiu.” There also appeared one amusing reaction by Lu Xun, a short piece entitled “Qu de jiefang” (The liberation of the ballad), being a satirical imitation of Zeng’s poem which, however, did not attack Zeng, but rather, like Zeng’s poem, commented on the Manchuria crisis. Half of the reviews contained statements to the effect that the reviewer had not read the special issue, but only the poems cited by Mao Dun in his original review. One of the reviewers making such a statement was in fact Mao Dun"
