        "text": "At the beginning of the decade, smash hit Scarlet Heart <步步惊心> created a cultural trend of releasing romantic comedies where the main lead travels back in time to dynastic China, and falls in love with a royal. While time traveling series have noticeably dwindled down in recent years (perhaps influenced by the nationwide ban of time traveling), an upcoming new series hopes to bring this old trend back to the forefront.\n\nProduced by the studio that brought Scarlet Heart, Dreaming Back to the Qing Dynasty <梦回> is based on a popular time traveling novel about a woman who accidentally travels back to the Qing Dynasty after getting lost during a tour of the Forbidden Palace. She falls in love with Yinxiang, the thirteenth son of the Kangxi Emperor.\n\nStarring as the female lead is 20-year-old Landy Li (李兰迪), who debuted six years ago as a child actress. Starring as Yinxiang is rookie actor Wang Anyu (王安宇), in which Dreaming Back is his debut role.\n\nThe aesthetics of the show, along with the relationship of the actors, is reminiscent of Scarlet Heart. Both series are produced by Tangren Media, and both Landy and Scarlet Heart’s Cecilia Liu (刘诗诗) are managed by Tangren (though Cecilia left Tangren in 2016). Both Cecilia and Landy are also descended from the Hui people.\n\nThough it may be difficult to achieve similar fame to Cecilia, the media is expecting Landy to reach new heights in her career, who hasn’t had a single hit since her debut in 2013. She has been compared with Wu Jinyan (吴谨言), who struggled for years before reaching to leading status with last year’s Qing Dynasty hit, Story of Yanxi Palace <延禧攻略>.\n\nDreaming Back to the Qing Dynasty will premiere on December 14, 2019 on QQ Live.\n\nSource: HK01.com"
