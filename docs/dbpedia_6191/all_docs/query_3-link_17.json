        "text": "2018 film by Chen SichengTemplate:SHORTDESC:2018 film by Chen Sicheng\n\nDetective Chinatown 2 (Chinese: 唐人街探案 2) is a 2018 Chinese comedy-mystery buddy film directed and written by Chen Sicheng, starring Wang Baoqiang and Liu Haoran. A sequel to 2015's Detective Chinatown, the film was released in China on 16 February 2018. It has grossed over US$544 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in China.[5][6]\n\nA sequel, Detective Chinatown 3, was released in February 2021.\n\nPlot[]\n\nQin Feng (Liu Haoran) thought he was going to attend his distant uncle Tang Ren's (Wang Baoqiang) wedding, which turned out to be a hoax. Tang Ren had deceived Qin Feng to come to New York for another purpose.\n\nThe godfather of Chinatown, Uncle Qi (Kenneth Tsang), gathered the world's best detectives from an app called Crimaster (which allows real detectives to upload their cases for the online community to solve them) and sets up a competition to locate his grandson's killer within one week for a reward of five million dollars. His grandson Jason was found in a temple with his heart torn out and an unknown symbol on a table near him.\n\nUnexpectedly, Qin Feng, the world's second-top detective and the world's third-top detective noticed another similar murder in the Hudson River one week before the investigation began. A white woman was also killed but lost her kidney. The two men pulled out surveillance videos of the two crime scenes and found that a man appeared at both crime scenes. They identify the man as Song Yi (Xiao Yang). However, after observing that Song Yi is right-handed, Qin Feng concludes that he could not be the killer since evidence suggests that the killer is left-handed. While Qin Feng and Tang Ren knew that Song Yi was not the killer, this was not everyone else's consensus, and so the duo had to clear Song Yi's name and find the real killer.\n\nEventually, with the help of Tang Ren's knowledge of Feng shui and Wu Xing, Qin Feng discovered the killer's motive. Due to the unique location of the murders, the time of the crimes, the eight characters of the victims' birthdays and the organs, he concluded the whole of New York was being used as an altar.(the elements fire, water, wood, metal, and earth were used to determine the locations, date, and the respective organ to be removed)\n\nFinally, they find out that the doctor who was battling cancer believed that doing ancient Taoist rituals could grant him immortality, and was behind the murders. The doctor kills himself after being found out.\n\nQin Feng deduces that Song Yi is actually the mysterious man \"Q\", the top-ranked detective of Crimaster. Song Yi solved the case very early on and used the doctor's patterns to cover up his own murder of a sex trafficking ringleader who abducted his sister. Qin Feng lets him go, but later KIKO reveals that \"Q\"'s IP address does not locate him in America, making Song Yi as \"Q\" unlikely. \"Q\" is therefore still at large.\n\nCast[]\n\nWang Baoqiang as Tang Ren (Chinese: 唐仁), Qin Feng's distant uncle and a Thai-Chinese swindler who comes to New York to solve a real case.\n\nLiu Haoran as Qin Feng (Chinese: 秦风), Tang Ren's nephew and one of the best detectives of the world.
