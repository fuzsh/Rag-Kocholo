        "text": "Firm overview\n\nHan Kun is a leading full-service law firm in China.\n\nOver the years, Han Kun has been widely recognized as a leader in complex cross-border and domestic transactions and compliance matters. Our main practice areas include private equity, mergers and acquisitions, international and domestic capital markets, investment funds, asset management, compliance, banking and finance, aviation finance, foreign direct investment, antitrust/competition, data protection, private client/wealth management, intellectual property, bankruptcy and restructuring and dispute resolution.\n\nWe have nearly 800 professionals located in our seven offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Haikou, Wuhan, as well as Singapore, a leading financial center in the Asia-Pacific. All our lawyers are graduates of top universities and have extensive experience in complex cross-border transactions and dispute resolution as counsel to both Chinese and foreign clients.\n\nFirm overview\n\nDentons' China region consists of 47 offices, spanning all of the nation's provinces and autonomous regions. It was formed through the 2015 combination of global firm Dentons and Chinese firm 大成. Partly as a result of that combination, Dentons is now the largest law firm in the world.\n\nFounded in 1992, 大成 was one of the first partnership law firms in China and is now one of the largest. 大成 began implementing its first five-year plan in 2004, and in 2007 the firm launched its strategy of building a global legal services network. Through the rapid expansion that has resulted, 大成 lawyers gained access to global resources, referrals, knowledge and experience—enhancing delivery of professional, agile and efficient service to clients.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, 大成 was named an \"Outstanding Law Firm in China\" for six consecutive years, and topped Asian Legal Business' annual rankings of \"ALB China Top 20 Largest Law Firms\" and \"ALB Asia Top 50 Largest Law Firms\" for years.\n\nWith more than 10,000 lawyers serving more than 70 countries, Dentons offers clients the benefit of quality experience in and of the communities in which they want to do business or resolve a dispute—from Canada and the United States, across Europe, the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Africa, Australia, Latin America and the Caribbean and throughout the Asia Pacific region. Through broad and in-depth cooperation between the most influential law firms from China and the West, we are innovating the world's legal services sector and marking a milestone in the history of the global legal profession.\n\nDentons is one of the three best known and most favored firms in the world, according to the Thomson Reuters Acritas “Global Elite Brand Index 2021”."
