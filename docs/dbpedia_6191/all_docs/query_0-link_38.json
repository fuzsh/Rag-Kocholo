During the modern period, roughly since the beginning of the 20th century, it has had to contend with the most adverse conditions: Confucianism, Buddhism, and imperial rule; invasion and occupation by Japan; the long civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists, and then under communism the dictates of Mao Zedong and other leaders; and the rampant materialism of the present day. Yet, in every period, it has found forms of expression and in some cases flourished, leaving an impressive legacy that is still being enriched at present. Alas, while those who know Chinese can enjoy it, this privilege is only gradually being shared with outsiders as more and more works are translated into English and other languages. This is finally encouraging its spread to new readers and new admirers, who are becoming familiar with a plethora of new authors— novelists, essayists, playwrights, and poets—and masses of intriguing works. Yet, this did not emerge from a vacuum, and Chinese literature is much easier to fathom in the context of its historical and literary trends. Providing this context, and introducing the authors and their works, is the main task of this Historical Dictionary of Modern Chinese Literature . It goes about it in several ways. The chronology traces the evolution, one with many twists and turns and only rare straight stretches, which partially account for the variety and diversity. The introduction provides a useful overview, one in which to insert the authors and their works. The dictionary follows on with hundreds of entries on writers, in all possible genres, of all possible proclivities, with varying styles and subject matter. Other entries present the historical and political events that impacted on this literature and the assorted literary currents and trends that shaped it. Since China is a vast country, with a population of over a billion, it is helpful to remember that it consists of regions, some of which have their own traditions, such as Tibet, and also that Chinese writers not only live and create in the People’s Republic of China but also the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia and, indeed, at present in the United States and other Western countries. Having once discovered how rich this literature is, there will inevitably be many who will want to read the works either in the original or translation and gain further background, which is facilitated by the bibliography. Given the extensive period, the geographical spread, and the broad range of writers and works, the author of this volume has done an extraordinary job of bringing all the various strands together and providing a comprehensive picture. Li-hua Ying grew up in the People’s Republic of China and studied at Yunnan Normal University, where she received a B.A. in English and also briefly taught. Moving to the United States, and not without maintaining her interest in English literature, she has increasingly specialized in Chinese literature. With a foot in each culture, and attuned to the increasing flows between them, she is an excellent guide to the literature of the world’s largest cultural community, the rapidly expanding literary output of which is bound to be known and read increasingly in coming years.\n\nJon Woronoff Series Editor\n\nPreface How to define “modern Chinese literature”? The challenge has to do specifically with the terms modern and Chinese . First of all, when does the modern period begin and end? Second, by “Chinese,” does one mean “of China” or “in the Chinese language”? If the scope is limited to 1918 to 1949, then the issue can be settled without much controversy. If the historical line stretches further down, however, the problem becomes potentially divisive. What about Taiwan? What about prehandover Hong Kong? And the Chinese diaspora? In the process of sorting through nearly a century of literary production, I have decided to adopt a more inclusive, thus more controversial, definition of “modern Chinese literature” in order to take into consideration the complex and diverse paths of its development. In terms of historical framework, I begin with the May Fourth generation and continue to the present. Acknowledging the defining role of the vernacular language, I have chosen to exclude texts written in classical Chinese during the same period. In terms of geographical boundary, I have also opted for a more inclusive line of demarcation. In addition to writers in the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, those who have settled in the West but continue to address the topic of, for the lack of a better word, “Chineseness,” are considered as part of the modern Chinese literary enterprise. Treating modern Chinese literature as a continuous and borderless entity, this dictionary of Modern Chinese Literature thus adopts a liberal usage of the words Chinese and modern by selecting from writers publishing since the beginning of the 20th century to the present whose language of expression is Chinese. A more accurate but cumbersome title could be “A Dictionary of Modern Chinese (Language) Literature.” I am certainly aware that the inclusion of Taiwanese writers in this dictionary could be a point of contention. My process of selection, however, is guided by considerations of linguistic as well as cultural and literary traditions instead of political concerns. In that sense, this project subscribes to a growing trend that takes a more general view of a literary institution aptly termed xiandai zhongwen/huawen wenxue (modern literature written in Chinese), which includes works from not only the PRC, Taiwan, and Hong Kong but also the Chinese diaspora. Needless to say, the scope is enormous, and in some cases the definition of “Chineseness” is hard to pin down. I have chosen, for the sake of convenience, to leave out many authors in Southeast Asia, which has large Chinese communities still creating and reading literature in the Chinese language. For that and many other reasons, this dictionary is by no means comprehensive or definitive. The criteria for selection are admittedly arbitrary and subjective. The writers whose names are precluded are not necessarily deemed less worthy. These absences could only be attributed, in some cases, to the limited knowledge and lapse of judgment on my part, and in others, to the continuously evolving arena of modern Chinese literature. I want to thank Professor Tan Ye, who got me started on this project. For the readers interested in Chinese theater, Professor Ye’s Historical Dictionary of Chinese Theater , also published\n\nby the Scarecrow Press, is infinitely more informative than the few entries I have devoted to the genre. Finally, the unfailing love and support my husband, Charles Chao, and son, Kyle Chao, have shown me have sustained me throughout the years. To them I owe a debt of gratitude.\n\nReader’s Notes The Pinyin system is used to transliterate Chinese terms, except for names that are commonly Romanized, therefore, Taipei instead of Taibei, Chiang Kai-shek instead of Chiang Jieshi, Hong Kong not Xianggang. With regard to writers whose names have more than one transliteration, the Pinyin transliteration is the primary form used with the additional transliteration(s) provided in the dictionary as “a.k.a.” (also known as) and in the bibliography in the parenthesis immediately following the Pinyin name. For the sake of consistency, Beijing is used instead of Beiping, the official name adopted during the Republican period (1911– 1949). In the Chinese convention, the surname goes before the given name. When the author’s name is mentioned for the first time, the full name is used; subsequently, only the surname is given. In the case of pen names, the conventional use of the full name is adopted. Hence, Lu Xun, instead of Lu, is used throughout the entry. When a title is mentioned for the first time, the Pinyin title goes before the English translation. Subsequent mentions of the same title are in Pinyin alone. Pinyin titles are not capitalized, except for the first letter of the first word and proper names. English translations of Chinese titles are, however, capitalized. Whenever possible, published English titles, shown in italics within parentheses, are used; in the case when no English publication is available, an English translation, not italicized, is provided by the author. When a term has an entry of its own in the dictionary, the term appears in boldface the first time it is mentioned in an entry other than its own. There are a few acronyms and abbreviations used throughout the dictionary; they are listed below with their full names: CCP: Chinese Communist Party DPP: Democratic Progressive Party KMT: Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) PRC: People’s Republic of China ROC: Republic of China\n\nChronology 1891 Su Manshu publishes his translation of Lord Byron’s poems, Bailun shi xuan (Poems by Byron), the first collection of Western poetry in Chinese. 1898 “Lun baihua wei weixin zhi ben” (The Vernacular Language as the Basis for Reforms) by Qiu Tingliang published. 1902 Liang Qichao creates in Japan the first modern Chinese fiction journal Xin xiaoshuo (New Fiction). 1906 Chunliu she (Spring Willow Society) established to perform spoken drama. 1911 Qing dynasty toppled.

It is solidly an integral part of world literature, for from the moment it was born, it has been in dialogue with its counterparts from the rest of the world. As it has been challenged and enriched by external influences, it has contributed to the wealth of literary culture of the world. Gone are the days when a Western reader picked up a book of modern Chinese literature for nonliterary reasons and when Chinese novels or poems were treated as sociopolitical documents. Nowadays, it is more likely that readers appreciate a Chinese novel because it is a great piece of art, not simply because it provides knowledge and information about Chinese society and politics. Indeed, the best literature written in Chinese is on a par with the best literature written in any other language; this has been especially true during the past three decades, which have given us some internationally recognized names, even a Nobel laureate. In terms of themes and styles, modern Chinese literature is rich and varied: from the revolutionary to the pastoral, from romanticism to feminism, from modernism to postmodernism, critical realism, psychological realism, socialist realism, and magic realism, you name it. Indeed, it encompasses a full range of ideological and aesthetic concerns. In some ways, what gives modern Chinese literature its vibrant diversity is its geographic range. Here the term Chinese literature should not be mistaken for “literature of China”— although the People’s Republic of China (PRC) itself is already a mind-boggling size—for its creators and readers are widely spread all over the globe. It is not an exaggeration to say that where there are Chinese communities, there is Chinese literature being read and written. Beyond the borders of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, there is a whole population of Chinese writers scattered throughout Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America who are connected in their love of the Chinese language as the medium of artistic expression. This is the landscape of Chinese literature today. In the study of Chinese history, modern China is generally divided into three periods: jindai (the recent era), 1840–1911; xiandai (the modern era), 1911–1949; and dangdai (the present era), 1949 to the present. The curtains of the jindai era were forced open by guns and cannons of Western forces in the mid-19th century. During the next six decades, the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) lost the Opium Wars to Great Britain, its navy was soundly defeated by Japan, and its territories were ceded to the Europeans, Russians, and Japanese. Although the Republican Revolution led by Sun Yat-sen succeeded in overthrowing the feeble and corrupt Qing empire and established the Republic of China in 1911, civil wars put the young republic in grave danger and the country continued to be dominated by foreign powers. Popular discontent reached a boiling point in 1919, when the Versailles Conference transferred the German concessions in Shandong to Japan, instead of returning them to Chinese sovereignty, causing widespread protests that later developed into a full-blown cultural crusade known as the May Fourth Movement. A nationwide soul-searching ensued, led by progressive\n\nintellectuals who blamed China’s weakened state on its fundamental cultural institutions that in their view had become obsolete and incapable of dealing with the modern world. For the survival of the Chinese nation, they argued, Western ideas and practices, including literature, had to be imported. In this Westward-looking environment, science and democracy became coded terms that represented modernity, progress, and hope for a national salvation. Prior to the 1980s, most literary scholars tended to adopt the same categories established by historians and saw the May Fourth Movement, which dominated Chinese intellectual discourse in the 20th century, as the force behind the emergence and development of China’s literary revolution. The term widely used to describe the literature born out the May Fourth Movement is xin wenxue (new literature). Wang Yao in his Zhongguo xin wenxue shi gao (A History of Chinese New Literature) emphasized the umbilical relationship between the new literature and the May Fourth Movement and puts “anti-imperialism” and “anti-feudalism” at the forefront of not only the political and cultural but also the literary agenda. 1Agreeing with Wang, Qian Liqun, Tang Tao, and Yan Jiayan also regarded 1949, when the PRC was established as a watershed, but they preferred the more evocative term xiandai wenxue (modern literature). 2 Most scholars in Taiwan, however, do not see 1949 as such a defining moment. Zhou Jin, in his book Zhongguo xin wenxue jian shi (A Brief History of Chinese New Literature), which was published in 1980, used the term xin wenxue but expanded it to cover works written in the 1970s by writers in Taiwan and Hong Kong. 3 In the mainland, the term dangdai wenxue was used widely in the period since 1949. To account for the new trends of literary creativity since the late 1970s made possible by Deng Xiaoping’s reform policies, another category xin shiqi wenxue (literature of the new era) has also been widely circulated. Since the 1980s, however, various attempts have been made to bypass these fragmenting periodizations. Huang Xiuji and his colleagues chose a calendarian term that not only expands the historical but also the geographical scope to include literature published outside the mainland. 4 Following a similar model, Chen Liao and Cao Huimin take one step further to argue that the inception of modern Chinese literature should be traced to the end of the 19th century. 5 They consider the publication of an article by Qiu Tingliang (1857–1943) in 1898 a seminal event. Qiu’s article, entitled “lun baihua wei weixin zhi ben” (The Vernacular Language as the Basis of the Reform Movement), called for a radical change in the use of language, a proposal echoed by social reform advocates such as Liang Qichao (1873–1929), who promoted the genre of fiction, elevating its status to that of poetry and prose, the privileged forms in classical Chinese literary tradition, and Huang Zunxian (1848–1905), who campaigned for a new kind of poetry that favored wo shou xie wo kou (direct expression). Chen and Cao contend that the work of these forerunners who had pushed for a new kind of language and literature eventually led to the full-blown literary revolution resulting in the publications in 1918 of the first significant modern Chinese short story “Kuangren riji” ( Diary of a Mad Man ) by Lu Xun, and vernacular poems by Hu Shi, Liu Bannong, and others, ushering in a new era of cultural and literary reform. Helping to shift the attention from political and social factors to the intrinsic nature of literature are Rene Welleck and Austin Warren, whose work A Theory of Literature has influenced the thinking of many Chinese\n\nliterary historians. 6 As early as 1985, Chen Sihe called for a redirection in the study of the history of modern Chinese literature, 7 setting off a new round of debates in Chinese scholarly circles. Conceptualized in such a framework, the term xiandai wenxue has found traction, pushing out xin wenxue and dangdai wenxue . Outside the Chinese-speaking world, the term modern has been used widely and loosely. C. T. Hsia, in his groundbreaking book published in 1971, A History of Modern Chinese Fiction , examines works from 1917 to 1957 and in the epilogue deals with works that were published through the 1970s. 8 The English anthology edited by Joseph S. M. Lau and Howard Goldblatt published in 1995 defines modern as 1919 to the end of the 20th century. 9 Relatively removed from the China-centric view held by most literary historians in China, scholars outside the mainland tend to regard the production of Chinese literature as a global affair that resulted from migration and immigration. Recent years have seen major efforts to rewrite the history of modern Chinese literature to take into account authors in the Chinese diaspora beyond the three major regions of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Leading the group that attempts to grapple with the complexity of the field are Dominic Cheung, David Der-wei Wang, and Shu-mei Shih, who have proposed, each with his or her own emphasis, a new conceptualizing framework and terminology: Huawen wenxue (Chinese-language literature) or Sinophone literature. 10 Regardless of the differences in opinion held by literary scholars, all agree that modern Chinese literature emerged in the midst of grave anxieties as a result of China’s encounters with the West, whose advanced technology and superior weaponry forced Chinese intellectuals to reflect on their own venerated traditions, both social and literary, and to seek changes that would meet the needs of a new society. In this campaign for comprehensive social transformation, literature was at the forefront. Modern Chinese writers abandoned wen yan (literary Chinese), the lingua franca of Chinese writing, and replaced it with bai hua (vernacular Chinese) as the language of both prose and poetry. Free verse instead of regulated verse was the preferred form; an interest in critical realism gave modern fiction writing its new style and subject matter that was firmly rooted in the present; and hua ju (spoken drama) made its debut, carving an important niche in the Chinese theater traditionally monopolized by the operatic variety. As educated Chinese wrestled with problems concerning social, political, linguistic, and literary reforms, the introduction of Western literature into the intellectual and popular discourses played a crucial role in fundamentally changing the direction of modern Chinese literary development. Translations of Western writings, including philosophical, scientific, and literary texts, influenced a whole generation of Chinese writers, giving rise to a new literature characterized by its use of the vernacular language as the medium of expression and its humanistic focus on contemporary social issues. Painfully aware of China’s reduced status, the May Fourth intellectuals located the roots of their country’s plight in the Chinese traditions, particularly Confucianism, which, in their view, had run its course and become a repressive yoke to the nation, preventing it from competing in the modern world. The bankruptcy of traditional values thus created a vacuum, making Western concepts of individualism and\n\npersonal emancipation a welcome replacement in a culture eager to shed the burdens of its own past. With its devotion to the cause of national salvation, Chinese literature during the first half of the 20th century actively engaged itself with various social and political causes, as China underwent devastating turmoil, including civil wars and the Japanese invasion. While critical realism, which was perceived as best equipped to address contemporary sociopolitical problems, dominated the field, other trends also prevailed. Shen Congwen’s pastoral representations of his hometown, a natural society indifferent to moralistic restrictions of Confucian ethics and modern urban materialism, Zhang Ailing’s stylized prose that probes the dark side of the human psyche, Shi Zhecun’s introspective narratives, Li Jinfa’s symbolist poems, and Zhang Henshui’s romantic novels coexisted with mainstream writings by Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, and a cohort of socially conscious writers. In 1949, when the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan and the mainland was taken over by the Communists, the May Fourth literary tradition branched off in several directions. Although Taiwan under Japanese occupation had seen some Chinese literary activities, it was the arrival of the Nationalist government that turned the island into a bastion and center of Chinese literary creation. With its close ties to the West, the government tolerated a certain degree of creative latitude, provided that writers stayed within the boundary of aesthetics. In this environment, the modern-ist movement that had flowered on the mainland from the 1920s to the early 1940s was resuscitated in Taiwan. Acting as a link between the two eras were veteran poets such as Ji Xian, a passionate proponent of modern poetry in the mainland, who became a principal player in modernizing the field of poetry making in Taiwan. Pumping new blood into the modernist movement was a younger generation of writers associated with the literary journal Xiandai wenxue (Modern Literature), which Bai Xianyong and his friends founded in 1960 on the campus of National Taiwan University. Challenging this Westerninspired trend, the xiangtu (nativist) literature, which rose from the south of the island, insisted on local experience and the realist mode of expression. Hong Kong, with its unique geopolitical position and the sudden influx of talents fleeing Communist China, developed its own brand of literature that reflects the realities of the British colony. Representing the continued experiment with Western modernism was Liu Yichang, who drew on the stream of consciousness technique to bring to life the sense of rootlessness and uncertainty in a city living on borrowed time. At the other end of the spectrum, popular forms of literature thrived; prominent among them were the martial arts novels of Liang Yusheng and Jin Yong, and Ni Kuang’s science fiction, which met the needs of readers looking for escape from the pressures of life in a fast-paced modern city. Meanwhile, in the PRC, a monolithic literary establishment pursued its strictly ideological agendas, suppressing creative autonomy in favor of propagandist literature. From 1949 to the end of 1970s, the best of literature written in Chinese came out of Taiwan and Hong Kong, providing a critical link in the chain of modern Chinese literary development since the May Fourth Movement. As China began its economic reform in the late 1970s, the government’s political grip on literature loosened and along with it came the dramatic decline of the influence wielded by\n\nMaoist doctrinarians. Closely behind the opening of national borders followed what has been called “the second surge” of importing of Western literature. Chinese writers showed an intense curiosity about authors from the West, as well as those from Latin America, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. A great variety of literary trends, from symbolism to postmodernism, was enthusiastically embraced and appropriated by Chinese writers, resulting in an output impressive both in quantity and quality. A burst of radical experiments with language, narrative techniques, themes, and subject matters were met with great interest. What united this polyphony of voices was a commitment to the sanctity of art, a fundamental departure from the Maoist era. In Taiwan, after the modernist and nativist influences declined in the wake of three decades of remarkable innovation, the literary scene began to diversify in the 1980s. While the more radical faction of the early realist nativist movement turned to a militant nationalist platform, a new generation, well educated and well read, rose to address contemporary Taiwan issues while tapping into the rich resources of Chinese culture. Latin American magic realism, which was received with great enthusiasm in the PRC, was also appropriated by Taiwan and Hong Kong writers. Since the 1990s, a flurry of literary and cultural trends, including postmodernism, neofeminism, and pop culture, have taken root in the postindustrialized societies of Taiwan and Hong Kong. In the PRC, the crackdown on the Tian’anmen Prodemocracy Movement (1989) forced a number of writers abroad as the government tightened its control of literary production. The life in exile, with its attached freedom and anxiety, has provided a new source and venue for their work, and more important, their presence in the West has strengthened a Chinese diasporic literature already star-studded with such prominent names as Bai Xianyong, Yu Lihua, Nie Hualing, and Yang Mu, who had emigrated from Taiwan in the 1970s. As a result, Chinese literary production and readership are more than ever pluralistic and global. Looking back on the development of nearly a century of literary history, one is struck by the degree of relevancy the past still holds for the present. The critical realist tradition established by writers such as Lu Xun and Mao Dun finds its voice in the works of Han Shaogong, Yu Hua, and others. The spirit of experimentalism in the poems of modern-ist Li Jinfa is embraced by not only the Misty poets such as Bei Dao and Yang Lian but also the fourth generation poets, including Zhang Zao and Zang Di. The romantic sentimentalism of Xu Zhimo and Dai Wangshu has its followers, such as the tragic poets Gu Cheng and Hai Zi. The rural landscape explored by Shen Congwen is revisited in the nativist movement in Taiwan and the pervasive rootseeking movement in the PRC. Zhang Ailing, who now enjoys the status of a literary icon, has many progenies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the PRC, while the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies school has its reincarnations in popular urban literature. What has come and gone is the brand of revolutionary literature that emphasizes the utilitarian role of literature for ideological purposes. Like the economy, the literary publishing and marketing industry in the 21st century is increasingly globalized. A book by a Chinese writer residing in London can be simultaneously published in the PRC, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Canada and marketed worldwide. A politically sensitive work written by a mainlander may not be printed in the PRC but should have no\n\ntrouble getting the attention of a publisher in Taiwan and eventually finding its way to the shelf of a mainland reader. This fluidity of literary and cultural transmission has given writers an unprecedented opportunity and challenge to be truly innovative, resulting in an impressive and diverse output. What originally grew out of a reaction to Western domination a century ago has proven itself to be capable of holding on to its rich cultural heritage while transcending national and ideological boundaries in search of universal truths about the human condition.\n\nNOTES 1.\n\nWang Yao.

Born and raised in Beijing, Ah Cheng worked on farms in Inner Mongolia and Yunnan during the Cultural Revolution . Soon after returning to Beijing in the late 1970s, he gained recognition for his paintings and writings. In the mid-1980s, he was a prominent member in the root-seeking movement, which represents a concerted effort of young writers to rediscover their cultural roots, which were destroyed in the calamities of the previous two decades. “Qi wang” ( King of Chess ), his first and best fictional work, is set in the 1970s on a remote farm in Yunnan and based on the life of a group of educated youth. The protagonist is a young man obsessed with food and chess, the former to satisfy his physical needs and the latter to nourish his spirituality. Following the success of “Qi wang , ” Ah Cheng wrote “Shu wang” (King of Trees) about one man’s futile effort during the Cultural Revolution to stop deforestation and “Haizi wang” (King of Children), the story of a devoted and unconventional village teacher. Notable in these stories is Ah Cheng’s use of the Chinese language. He appropriates classical Chinese, particularly its terse and compact structure and its elegance, features that are markedly different from the verbiage and political mumbo jumbo of the Mao era. Equally noteworthy is the prevailing presence of traditional values in the stories, particularly those of Daoism and Buddhism. AH LAI, A.K.A. ALAI (1959– ). Poet, fiction and prose writer. “I’mTibetan and I write in Chinese,” Ah Lai thus describes himself. He was born in Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in northwestern Sichuan. The Gyarong Tibetans in Aba are a linguistically distinct people who maintain their uniqueness while sharing an ethnic and cultural identity with Tibetans of Kham, Amdo, and U-Tsang. Due to their geographic location and agrarian lifestyle, the Gyarong Tibetans who live in a region situated at the crossroads between the Chinese and Tibetan spheres of influences are arguably the most sinicized Tibetans. Ah Lai learned Chinese at school while speaking the Gyarong dialect in his home village. He graduated from a teachers’ training college and taught in a rural school for five years before his publications landed him a job at the Aba Cultural Bureau as an editor for a local literary journal. He later moved to Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, to edit a science fiction journal. Ah Lai began his literary career writing poetry, later collected in Lengmo he (The Lengmo River), but it is his fiction that earned him his fame. His first and most famous novel, Chen’ai luoding ( Red Poppies ), a winner of the prestigious Mao Dun Literature Prize, tells an apocalyptic tale about the final years in the history of the Gyarong-Tibetan chieftain system, covering the period from the end of the 19th century to the mid-20th century. Told by a chieftain’s mentally retarded son—a man with supernatural foresights who has witnessed the rise and fall of his family and other chieftains—the novel opens a window to a geographically\n\nisolated area whose traditional way of life and sociopolitical system were affected by the outside world as China moved into the turbulent 20th century. The novel unfolds a rich tapestry of conspiracies, shifting loyalty, revenge, and romances. Following the success of Chen’ai luoding , Ah Lai published Kong shan 1 (The Empty Mountain, Part 1), the first of a trilogy about a small Tibetan village named Jicun. Kong shan 1 consists of two novellas: “Suifeng piaosan” (Gone with the Wind), a tragic tale about the friendship between two boys, and “Tian huo” (A Natural Fire), which tells how political and human intervention causes an environmental disaster. Kong shan 2 (The Empty Mountain, Part 2) consists of “Dase yu Dage” (Taser and Tager), a sad story about hunters when hunting ceases to be a way of life, and “Huangwu” (Desolation) focusing on a Chinese peasant living among Tibetans. With the Kong shan series, Ah Lai attempts to break away from the linear storytelling used in his earlier novel and chooses instead to write a trilogy composed of six independent novellas, each with its own protagonists who may appear in the other segments but only as peripheral characters. This decentered, fragmented structure, according to Ah Lai, reflects the realities of village life in modern times. As an offshoot of nearby towns, which are symbols of the state and modernity, the village, in Ah Lai’s view, plays no role in choosing its part in the grand national mission. Unlike the countryside in the heroic narratives of socialist realism by such writers as Ding Ling , Zhou Libo , and Hao Ran , the center stage of Ah Lai’s Jicun is not occupied by a hero tied with the state in one single ideological vision, but rather by a multitude of small characters, each operating from his or her own center and taking turns to command attention. The realities of such rural life are formed by these little “centers,” acting like the small pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Ah Lai structures his three Kong shan novels in such a fashion to reflect the lost or fast disappearing cultures of a mountain village. Ah Lai’s other works include Aba Ah Lai (Aba and Ah Lai), a collection of short stories and prose work written in the 1980s and 1990s about his hometown and his own spiritual odyssey, mingling Tibetan folklore with real-life stories, and Dadi de jieti (The Earth’s Staircase), a travelogue that documents the author’s journey across his native land and contemplates the spirit of the people as outside forces intrude upon their lives and ravage their environment. Ah Lai taps the rich source of Gyarong culture to create poignant and intriguing literary work. His richly detailed narratives about the specific travails of the region in its recent history invoke Tibetan folklore and local legends, generating a sense of timelessness infused by a unique sensibility cultivated from multiple literary and cultural traditions. AI QING, PEN NAME OF JIANG HAICHENG (1910–1996). Poet. Born to a landed family in Zhejiang, Ai Qing was initially trained to be an artist. In 1929, he went to France to study oil painting and sculpture and was introduced to Marxism and French poetry. The Japanese invasion of China roused his sense of nationalism. Upon his return from Europe, Ai Qing joined a group of leftist artists and was later arrested by the Nationalist government. Unable to paint while in prison, he turned to writing poetry and was soon recognized as an important poetic voice in the nation. In 1941, he went to Yan’an, the Communist base at the time, and became a party member three years later. He moved to Beijing after the Communist\n\nvictory. In 1957, he was branded a “rightist” and lived in exile on remote farms until 1973 when an eye illness brought him back to Beijing for treatment. In 1979, he was rehabilitated and elected deputy chairman of the Chinese Writers’ Association. Ai Qing earned a reputation in the 1930s as a patriotic poet whose passionate love of the land and its people is expressed in such poems as “Dayanhe—wo de baomu” (Dayan River My Wet-nurse), “Taiyang” (The Sun), “Liming” (Dawn), and “Chun” (The Spring). During the Sino-Japanese War, his poems served as rallying cries for the nation, which eagerly embraced the nationalist spirit sung in poems such as “Beifang” (The North), “Xue luo zai zhongguo de tudi shang” (Snow Falls on the Chinese Land), and “Xiang Taiyang” (To the Sun). Writing in the vernacular language and free style, Ai Qing made a significant contribution to modern Chinese poetry. His technique, defined as simple and straightforward, and his voice, idealistic and sentimental, helped establish a poetic tradition that lasted throughout the Mao era. See also MODERNISTS. AI WU, PEN NAME OF TANG DAOGENG (1904–1992). Fiction writer and essayist. Born into an intellectual family in a small town of southwestern China, Ai Wu spent his formative years in the company of liberal educators and progressive magazines that advocated discarding China’s traditional culture in order to transform it into a modern nation. To experience the life of the working class, called for by the leftist movement, Ai Wu left his hometown at the age of 21 and traveled south to Yunnan and Burma, often in the company of small merchants, horse thieves, and other such vagrant personalities. The journey became the source of his most important work, Nan xingj ji (Journey to the South), as well as the catalyst for his ideological conversion to communism. In 1929, while stranded in Rangoon, he joined the Burmese branch of the Malaysian Communist Party. The most memorable characters in Nan xing ji are vagrants who live on the fringes of society. Life in the picaresque world of border towns and villages that had attracted Ai Wu proved to be appealing to his readers as well. With the publication of Nan xing ji , Ai Wu was established as a serious writer of literature. Fengrao de yuanye (Fertile Plains) , Guxiang (My Native Land), and Shanye ( Mountain Wilderness), three novels set against the backdrop of the Sino-Japanese War , explore the social fabric of the war-torn Chinese countryside and the role morality and tradition play during the national crisis. After the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Ai Wu was elected a member of the All-China Federation of Writers and Artists and served as a council member of the Chinese Writers’ Association. He published Bai Lian cheng gang (The Tempering of Steel), and Nan xing ji xubian (Sequel to Journey to the South), which extol ordinary citizens whose sense of collectivism and loyalty to the party are depicted as the driving force behind Communist China’s success. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), like many other writers of his generation, Ai Wu was forced to abandon his writing and was not allowed to resume it until the end of the turbulent decade. Throughout his literary career, Ai Wu remained committed to the belief that the responsibility of a writer was to champion the working class and to create realist portraits of ordinary men and women.\n\nAN QI (1969– ), PEN NAME OF HUANG JIANGPIN. Poet. Born in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, and graduated from Zhangzhou Teachers’ College, An Qi earned her reputation with several collections of poetry, including Ge: shui shang hong yue (Songs: Red Moon on Water), Benpao de zhalan (Running Railings), and Xiang Dulasi yiyang shenghuo (Living in the Manner of Duras). Her poems tend to focus on how to tear down the conventional boundaries of poetic language in order to create a sense of freedom without having to make sense of the random fragments contained within the lines. The world in her poems lacks structure, which reflects her perception of reality. The unbridled words and imageries, especially in the poems written since 1998, are a testament to the poet’s vivid imagination. An Qi acknowledges her debt in particular to Ezra Pound, to whom she pays homage with the poem “Pound or the Rib of Poetry,” and to the Chinese classical novel Hong lou meng ( A Dream of Red Mansions ), whose fatalist worldview inspired her to write “Zai Da Guan Yuan li xiangqi de Zhongjian dai” (The Middle Generation Reminded in the Grand View Garden) and “Gei Cao Xueqin” (To Cao Xueqin). In addition to her own creative work, An Qi is known as a spokesperson for the so-called Zhongjian dai (Middle Generation), a term coined to promote poets neglected by Generation III proponents, giving them a distinct identity. She coedited, with Yuan Cun and Huang Lihai, the anthology entitled Zhongjian dai shi quan ji (Complete Works by the Middle Generation Poets). An Qi currently lives in Beijing and edits Poetry Monthly. AVANT-GARDE (XIANFENG PAI). Influenced by postmodern literature from Latin America and Europe—particularly works by Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, and Gabriel García Márquez—the Chinese avant-garde movement began in the 1980s and continues to the present with abated intensity. Deeply invested in narrative form rather than content, the avant-garde writers valorize technique and structure. In a deliberate move away from the realist traditon, they insist that reality as well as history is highly suspect and unreliable and that it is personal experience and individual perception that are essential to narrative art. Ma Yuan ’s fabrications of Tibetan myths, Can Xue ’s nightmarish accounts of individuals’ inner turmoil, Su Tong ’s re-creation of local history, Yu Hua ’s grotesque accounts of violence, Ge Fei ’s lyrical prose, Hong Feng ’s deconstructed tragedy, and Sun Ganlu ’s antifiction all emphasize irony, ambiguity, dreams and fantasies, multiple realities, and a highly individual and creative use of language. As a literary movement, the avant-garde represents one of the two main streams of contemporary Chinese literature, the other being the root-seeking movement. There is, however, a tendency found among an increasing number of writers to merge the two approaches in their works.

Ba Jin was one of the most celebrated and prolific writers in modern Chinese literature. He grew up in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, in a large wealthy family. Well versed in the classics, he nevertheless became an enthusiastic participant in the New Culture\n\nMovement. An anarchist in his radical days, Ba Jin acquired his pen name from the Chinese transliterations of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, two 19th-century Russian anarchists. In the late 1920s, while studying French social history in Paris, he began a literary career that would last for more than six decades. Largely known as a fiction writer, Ba Jin was also a translator, a publisher, and an editor and held many political as well as professional titles, such as president of the Chinese Writers’ Association and deputy chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. He was the recipient of the Dante Literature Award (1982) and the Croix de la Légion d’Honneur (1983). All of Ba Jin’s novels were written in the two decades from the late 1920s to 1947, most notable of which are the trilogies: Jiliu sanbuqu (Trilogy of Torrent) formed by Jia ( Family ) , Chun (Spring) , and Qiu(Autumn); Aiqing sanbuqu (Trilogy of Love) consisting of Wu (Fog) , Yu (Rain) , and Dian (Lightning); and Huo (Fire) , also called Kangzhan sanbuqu (Trilogy of the Anti-Japanese War) . Other works published during this period include his first novel, Miewang (Destruction) about a depressed young anarchist, and its sequel Xinsheng (New Life), as well as Qi yuan ( Garden of Repose ) , Disi bingshi ( Ward Four ) , and Hanye ( Cold Night ). The protagonists of Ba Jin’s earlier novels are educated youth caught at the crossroads of tradition and modernity. Jia , generally considered his finest piece, best represents his works written during this period. The novel portrays a family in crisis, with the young generation pitted against the old. The Gao clan mirrors Chinese society, in which children are demanded by centuries of Confucian tradition to obey the figure of authority, be it the patriarch or the emperor. Ba Jin points out in Jia that such a system does nothing but destroy the lives of the young; the only hope for them is to break free from it. The Chinese youth at the time readily identified with the passionate heroes Ba Jin created. In contrast with the zealous and optimistic worldview expressed in his early works, Ba Jin in the 1940s took a more somber perspective on history, reality, and human nature. Qi yuan and Hanye are good examples to illustrate the change. Free of the hot-blooded, idealistic young rebels who populate his earlier novels, these stories focus on the decline of the old family and the tragic consequences when hope is dashed by the reality of war, poverty, and prejudice. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Ba Jin wrote some short stories and novellas, a few of which were politically motivated and would later be deemed by the author himself as “waste products.” He suffered a great deal of physical and psychological abuse during the Cultural Revolution . His best-known work in the post-Mao era is the four-volume Suixiang lu ( Random Thoughts ), a collection of essays and memoirs expressing regrets about the “false and empty words” he had written in exchange for political protection during the Cultural Revolution. BAI XIANYONG, A.K.A. PAI HSIEN-YUNG (1937– ). Fiction writer. Bai Xianyong came from a prominent military family, one of 10 children of Bai Chongxi (1893–1966), a highranking general in the Nationalist army who served briefly as defense minister in the Nationalist government. Bai was born in 1937, in time to experience the Sino-Japanese War and the Civil War fought between the Nationalists and the Communists. In 1949, while his\n\nfather was fighting the Communists on the front, his mother herded the large family first to Hankou, then to Guangzhou, and finally to Hong Kong, where Bai attended primary and middle schools for three years. In 1952, the family was reunited in Taipei with the father. Bai entered college as a civil engineering major but promptly switched to English at the National Taiwan University’s Foreign Languages Department. The four undergraduate years he spent at National Taiwan University marked a crucial milestone for Bai and launched his writing career. In 1959, Bai and some of his classmates, all aspiring writers, founded the bimonthly literary journal Xiandai wenxue (Modern Literature), whose mission was twofold: to systematically introduce Western modernist writers including Franz Kafka, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Thomas Mann; and to nurture a whole generation of Taiwan writers. As its editor and frequent contributor, Bai helped make the journal a trendsetter, leading Taiwan’s literature into an era of innovation and experimentation. The stories he wrote and published in Xiandai wenxue are often reminiscences of childhood and youth, based on and developed from his own life. The first-person narrator in “Yuqing Sao” (Yuqing’s Wife), for instance, is an observant little boy who is catapulted into the adult world of illicit passion when Yuqing Sao, an attractive young widow who is a servant of his family, kills her lover and herself after she discovers his affair with another woman. In 1963, Bai went to the United States to study creative writing through the International Writers’ Workshop at the University of Iowa. Two years later with a master’s degree in hand, he accepted a teaching post at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he remained until his retirement in 1994. While in Iowa, he wrote a series of stories about Chinese expatriates, later collected in a book entitled Niuyueke (New Yorkers). The reality of life as an expatriate, with it the sense of dislocation, loss, and memory, is the predominant theme of Niuyueke . In 1973, Bai published Taipei ren (Taipei Characters), the most important work of his career, winning him a large following in the communities of the Chinese diaspora. The book has since been reprinted many times by several publishers, both in Taiwan and on the mainland. The main characters of Taipei ren are people who followed the Nationalist government to Taiwan. Many of them had enjoyed privileged lives on the mainland as society dames, generals, government officials, bankers, or industrialists. Bai examines how the past affects their lives by probing into their longings, regrets, aching passions, melancholy, and nostalgia. There is a constant undercurrent of irony in these stories. As he relentlessly scrutinizes the complex emotions of his characters, Bai maintains a cool narrative distance, which enhances the tragic consequences of their situations. With Taipei ren , Bai has perfected the art of short story telling and the book displays his unique artistic sensibilities, impeccable artistry, and a keen moral vision. Bai has written one novel, Niezi ( Crystal Boys ), which depicts the underground world of homosexuals in Taipei. Since his retirement, Bai has been devoting his time to reviving and promoting Kunqu Opera. He travels frequently across the Pacific Ocean to deliver lectures and speeches in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China on literature, dramatic performances, and AIDS awareness. See also\n\nMODERNISTS. BEI CUN, PEN NAME OF KANG HONG (1965– ). Fiction and screenplay writer. Bei Cun grew up in Fujian and studied Chinese literature at Xiamen University. In the early 1990s he was an avant-garde writer, publishing a series of sketches, including “Taowangzhe shuo” (Says the Escapee), “Jiechizhe shuo” (Says the Kidnapper), “Pijiazhe shuo” (Says the Armored), and “Guixiangzhe shuo” (Says the Returnee), all of which focus on experimenting with innovative narrative techniques. This stylistic focus was later replaced by an intense interest in exploring the human soul, the meaning of life. Works such as Shixi de he (The River of Baptism), which depicts a poet’s wandering experience, “ Huanxiang” (Homecoming), an allegorical tale about the tragic fates of five poets, and “Zuihou de yishujia ” (The Last Artist) all examaine human spirituality in its complicated manifestations. Laomu de qin (Laomu’s Violin), and “Zhou Yu de hanjiao” (Zhou Yu’s Shouts), which has been adapted into a movie, further explore the difficulties encountered in a spiritual journey. Salvation, as shown in the lives of the protagonists in these stories, lies in the individual’s ability to find meaning in art/poetry, which proves to be elusive at best in an era of materialism and commodification. Since 2003, Bei Cun has published several novels, including Fennu (Furor) about a young man’s journey from the countryside to the city, from being an innocent and ambitious man to a criminal who finally comes to repent his actions while running away from the authorities, and Gonglu shang de linghun (Souls on Highways), a family saga unfolding in three generations, three countries, and three wars, connected by three highways. Compared with his earlier works, which tend to be dark and gloomy, these recent novels present life from a more upbeat and idealistic perspective, despite apparently tragic circumstances. Other than short stories and novels, Bei Cun has written screenplays as well as poetry. He currently works as an editor for Fujian wenxue (Fujian Literature). BEI DAO, PEN NAME OF ZHAO ZHENKAI (1949– ). Poet and essayist. Bei Dao is the most notable representative of the Misty poets associated with the underground journal Jintian (Today), which Bei Dao cofounded in 1978 with fellow poet Mang Ke . Jintian published works written by budding young poets who challenged the ideologically driven socialist realist tradition that had dominated Chinese literature since the 1950s. A Misty poem ordinarily contains oblique imagery and cryptic syntax. In their experiment with new techniques, the young poets opted for elusiveness and ambiguity of meaning, intentionally scrambling the relationship between the signifier and the signified to foreground the poetic language. In so doing, they hoped to cleanse the Chinese language that had been saturated with politics and communist ideology. In their effort to to remove the dogmatic, cliché-ridden expressions, they strove to replace the public, official language with a highly individualized one. Jintian nurtured a whole generation of poets, such as Yang Lian , Gu Cheng , Duo Duo , and Shu Ting , and helped establish Bei Dao’s position as the leader of post-Mao poetry. Bei Dao was a favorite among college students, and one of his poems, “Huida” (Answer), a rebellious rejection of blind loyalty, became a battle cry for the prodemocracy movement in 1989. The activities of Bei Dao and the other Misty poets came to a halt in the aftermath of the\n\ncrackdown on the Tian’anmen protests. Jintian was banned due to accusations of having instigated the protests, and its leading voices were silenced. Bei Dao, who was attending a conference in Berlin at the time, was forbidden to return to China. Jintian was resurrected in Stockholm in 1990 as a forum for expatriate Chinese writers. During his time abroad, Bei Dao has lectured at a number of universities in the West and his poems have been translated into several languages. Bei Dao’s poetry has gone through several phases, from defiant political outcry to personal ruminations about passion, love, and friendship, to the mourning of the bleak interior world, to ironic examinations of the human condition. The core of his poetry, however, has remained the same: to explore the intricate web of language and the nature of the self in relation to the emotional wounds inflicted by history and society. Unlike his hermetic poetry, Bei Dao’s essays are easily accessible. In them, he offers his thoughts on a variety of topics, such as the stresses of exile, reminiscences about his friends, and recollections of his life in China. Bei Dao’s poems and essays written since his exile have earned even more critical acclaim. For his uncompromised stance in defense of freedom of expression and his literary achievement, Bei Dao was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters as an honorary member. He has been repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature. BI FEIYU (1964– ). A Jiangsu native, Bi Feiyu graduated from Yangzhou Teachers’ College in 1987. For his depiction of Chinese country life and his examination of the psyche of the Chinese peasants, Bi is considered an important newcomer in the root-seeking movement, although he started his career as an experimental writer. His novella “Gu dao” (The Solitary Island), in which a family legend intersects with national history, shows a writer more interested in narrative technique than plot and story. His later works, including award-winning stories “Buru qi de nüren” (Women in Lactation) and “Qingyi” (The Opera Singer), depart from experimentalism and embrace a realist style. Bi’s novels include Yumi (Yumi), a trilogy about three sisters forced to quickly learn to fend for themselves when their village party secretary father falls from power as a result of sex scandals; Pingyuan (The Plain), which explores the mind-set of the peasants and their hard life in the 1970s, focusing on the vulnerability and despair of young people; Tuina (Massage), an account of the ordinary life led by a group of blind masseuses. BI SHUMIN (1952– ). Fiction writer. Born in Yili, Xinjiang, Bi Shumin joined the military at 16 upon graduation from the Beijing Foreign Languages School, where she majored in Russian. Bi spent the next 11 years in Tibet , working in the army first as a nurse, then a medic, and finally a doctor, until the 1980s, when she finished her military service and returned to Beijing. To nurture her budding literary interest, she studied creative writing at Beijing Normal University and received her master’s in 1991. Later, she returned to the university and received her Ph.D. in psychology in 2002. Bi began writing in the 1980s, inspired by her experience in Tibet. Her first publication “Kunlun shang” (Death in the Kunlun Mountain), a story about the sacrifices of the soldiers and officers stationed in Tibet, appeared in 1987 and she continued to write about the hardships\n\nendured by the Chinese military in the Tibetan plateau, especially by women in a predominantly male world. In recent years, Bi has been fascinated by the subject of human psychology. Her breakthrough story “Yuyue siwang” ( An Appointment with Death ) examines the experience of patients and their families when faced with incurable illnesses. Her novel Zhengjiu rufang (Saving the Breasts) explores the effects of breast cancer on women. Many of these works are based on her direct encounters with patients in her medical practice. Her recent novel Nü xinli shi (The Female Psychologist) tells how a psychologist maintains her professional authority when dealing with her patients who seek her advice while trying to sort out her own messy relationships with her husband and her lover. BIAN ZHILIN (1910–2000). Poet, translator, and scholar. Born in Haimen, Jiangsu Province, Bian Zhilin studied English at Beijing University and went on to become a Shakespeare scholar and one of the most important poets in modern Chinese literature. While translating Western poetry into vernacular Chinese, Bian began writing poetry. His work caught the attention of Xu Zhimo , China’s most prominent poet at the time, who admired Bian’s innovative poems. In 1936, Bian collaborated with fellow Beijing University students He Qifang and Li Guangtian on a collection of poetry entitled Hanyuan ji (Hanyuan Collection), earning them the nickname “Three Musketeers of Hanyuan.” In addition to writing free verse in the vernacular language, Bian explored new ways of writing modern regulated verse. Of all the poems Bian wrote during his career, the most memorable is the quatrain entitled “Duan Zhang” (The Broken Chapter) composed in 1934. It records the feelings of one single moment with images of a person standing on a bridge looking at a scene and another person (or persons) standing by a window looking at the one on the bridge while taking in the scenery around him or her. The political atmosphere after 1949 permitted poets to write only propagandist poems and Bian soon abandoned poetry writing to focus instead on translation and scholarly work. His work on William Shakespeare’s tragedies is considered an important contribution to Shakespearian studies in China. He is also credited with introducing a wide variety of Western literary works to Chinese readers. BING XIN, A.K.A. PING HSIN, PEN NAME OF XIE BINGXIN (1900–1999). Born in Fuzhou, Bing Xin graduated from Yanjing University in Beijing with a bachelor’s degree in literature and from Wellesley College in the United States with a master’s in English literature. She began writing during the May Fourth Movement and had a long, distinguished career as a writer, translator, teacher, and public figure. Her creative writing includes poetry, prose, and short stories. In her early works, Bing Xin encouraged women to get an education not only as a way to obtain self-fulfillment but also to bring happiness and stability to the family. Her first story “Liangge jiating” (Two Families) portrays two housewives with different backgrounds: the educated woman is able to teach her children and provide understanding and comfort for her husband; the illiterate woman is only interested in spending money on jewelry and clothes and does not know how to bring up children or manage household finances. The family with the well-educated wife is happy while the one with the ignorant wife is unhappy. At a time when\n\neducation for women was still rare, Bing Xin attempted to use her stories as a wake-up call to society. Her writings, as expressions of a wholesome, healthy, uplifting outlook, generally promote a positive attitude toward life and advocate love and kindness. Her series of poems Fan xing (Myriad Stars) are most emblematic of this worldview; she extols the love of family, the love of friends, and above all maternal love. In her view, love is capable of saving the world. The hero in “Chaoren” (The Superman), her best-known story, is a man saved by a loving relationship with a little boy. Bing Xin wrote many stories and poems for children; from the series Ji xiao duzhu (To Young Readers) to tales she wrote in the 1950s, she shows her young readers how important it is to love nature, learning, and family and friends. – C – CAN XUE, PEN NAME OF DENG XIAOHUA (1953– ). Fiction writer. Born and raised in Changsha by intellectual parents working for the Hunan Daily , Can Xue moved with her family to a farm in the late 1950s when her father was labeled a rightist. During the famine that soon followed, the family suffered incredible hardships. The onset of the Cultural Revolution permanently ended Can Xue’s formal schooling, leaving her with only a primary school education. Can Xue went to work in a factory and later quit her job to become a seamstress. She began writing in the early 1980s. A primary advocate for the Chinese avant-garde long before it became a trendy literary movement in China, Can Xue was a unique figure among contemporary Chinese writers. She takes pride in writing “pure literature” and singlemindedly pursues her own artistic vision, completely unaffected by either her critics or the market. With an imaginative mind, she has spun some of the most fantastic stories in contemporary Chinese literature. In her works, one can find traces of influence by Jorge Luis Borges and Franz Kafka. Her short stories, including “Shan shang de xiao wu” (A Little Hut on the Hill) and “Feizao” (Soap), and novellas such as “Canglao de fu yun” ( Old Floating Clouds ) and “Huang ni jie” ( Yellow Mud Street ), all written in the 1980s and variably called “gothic,” “surrealistic,” and “absurd,” remain her best-known works. In these texts, dreams and fantasies appear to be tangible and believable. Focusing on the subconscious of the human mind, Can Xue has created a world that is invariably irrational, fragmented, and nightmarish, with no clear definition of time, space, and identity. Among the group of avant-garde writers who began writing experimental fiction in the 1980s, Can is arguably the only one who has maintained a cutting-edge approach to literature, continuing to produce the kind of work that compels the reader to participate in an intellectual exercise. Bianjiang (The Frontier), a recent novel that portrays the uncanny life of a small border town whose residents possess extraordinary abilities, is a testament to her sustained creative energy and her persistent effort at exploring the realm of the human psyche. CAO JUREN (1900–1972). Essayist and fiction writer. Born in Zhejiang, Cao graduated from the Hangzhou Number One Teachers’ College, a magnet for progressive thinkers at the time, and taught literature at several universities. He was an editor and journalist during the SinoJapanese War . Cao moved to Hong Kong in 1950 and in his position as founder and editor of Re feng (Hot Breeze), a bimonthly literary journal, he published works of liberal writers\n\nwho stayed on the mainland after 1949. Cao wrote a large quantity of works, most of which are essays and some fiction. He was also a literary critic. CAO NAIQIAN (1949– ). A Shanxi native, Cao began his literary career in the late 1980s when his short stories about rural Shanxi garnered praises from the veteran writer Wang Zengqi , who wrote an essay introducing his work to the public. The Wenjiayao stories, totaling more than 20, are based on life in the village at the border between Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, where Cao lived for a year during the Cultural Revolution supervising the educated city youths sent there to perform physicial labor. These stories, published in some of China’s major literary journals, won immediate critical acclaim in both China and Taiwan and attracted the attention of the Swedish Sinologist Goran Malmqvist, who helped promote Cao’s work. Cao’s realistic portrayal of destitution reveals some of the most horrific conditions of rural life in northern China. As a true realist, Cao presents Wenjiayao as it is—a village debilitated by poverty, with food and sex dominating the thoughts and conversations of the men. The stories contain unfiltered local ballads that express in a vivid and crude language sexual desire that burns inside the men in the village. “Nüren” (Women) and “Da pinhuo” (Bachelors’ Potluck) are two of the stories in the Wenjiayao series. Dao heiye xiang ni mei banfa ( When I Think of You Late at Night, There’s Nothing I Can Do ), a novel composed of five short stories, is arguably the best of Cao’s work. It tells how the hunger for food and sex that ravages Wenjiayao turns one man into a criminal who rapes his own mother and forces a woman to offer her own body to alleviate her son’s pent-up desire. It also exposes the abuse of power in the hands of village leaders. Cao’s unfinished semiautobiographical novel, Shangshi jiuzhang (Nine Chapters of the Bygone Times), consists of eight short stories and one novella. In 2005, Cao was invited to participate in the International Writers Workshop at Hong Kong Baptist University. CAO WENXUAN (1974– ). Fiction writer. Born in rural Jiangsu, Cao Wenxuan graduated from the Chinese Department of Beijing University in the late 1970s. Since then, he has been teaching modern Chinese literature at his alma mater. A strong advocate for children’s literature and a winner of several literary awards, including the Song Qingling Literature Prize and Bing Xin Literature Prize, Cao has published numerous stories and novels about Chinese adolescents. He writes in a lyrical style that appeals aesthetically to traditional sensibilities and his works portray everyday characters who experience life in its many facets and learn lessons about love, sacrifice, hard work, dignity, and judgment. Shanyang bu chi tiantang cao (Goats Do Not Eat the Grass in Heaven) portrays the hard life of a boy as he follows adult migrant workers into the city; Cao fangzi (A Thatched House) examines the six years of elementary school life from the perspective of a little boy as he struggles to understand the world of the adults; Hong wa (Red Tiles), which won the National Book Award and Beijing Literature and Arts Award, portrays the simple and pure life of the countryside described in the words of a middle school student; Xi mi (Fine Rice), also set in rural China during the Cultural Revolution , tells how a country boy falls in love with a schoolteacher. Most representative of Cao’s aesthetics is Tian piao (A Downpour), a novel\n\nabout a love triangle between two men and one woman. In this book, Cao describes more than a dozen forms of rain in a style that accentuates his traditional sensibility. While situating a story of desire and human nature in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, Cao minimizes the historical background, skirting around the social destruction and political turmoil, and chooses to focus on a love story in which personal ambition pales next to romantic sentiments and even death is turned into an artistic experience. CAO YU, A.K.A. TSAO YU, PEN NAME OF WAN JIABAO (1910– 1996). Playwright. Born in Tianjin into an official family, Cao Yu was the most important playwright in 20th century China and the driving force behind the success of hua ju ( spoken drama ), a transplanted theatrical form introduced from the West to China during the first decade of the 20th century. Some of his plays, particularly those written in the 1930s, including Leiyu ( Thunderstorm ), a four-act tragedy about a family ripped apart by secret lives and opposing ideologies, and Richu ( Sunrise ) about the contrasting worlds of a society woman and a prostitute both driven to death by dark social forces, are Chinese classics and are still performed in China’s theaters. Beijing ren ( Peking Man ), which portrays an old declining family, is considered the best play he wrote during the 1940s. Cao Yu’s dramatic skills were influenced by Greek tragedies and works by Henrik Ibsen and Eugene O’Neill. However, the lyrical sensibility and the dramatic language as well as the social consciousness expressed are quintessentially Chinese. After 1949, Cao Yu served as president of the Central Institute of Theater and Beijing People’s Art Theater and continued to write, but none of the plays he produced during this period reached the same level of success and popularity as his earlier works. CAO ZHILIAN, A.K.A. JERLIAN TSAO (1969– ). Fiction writer. A graduate from National Taiwan University and the University of California at Berkeley, Cao Zhilian represents the new generation of “Internet writers” whose works are published online before they are picked up by traditional print publishers. Cao has written two novels and some short stories; they all can be found in paper form. Mou dai fengliu (The Romance of a Certain Era), published online in 1996, was conceived when she was researching for her Ph.D. dissertation on the social transformation in the city of Suzhou during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Set in the 16th century, it depicts the nebulous relationships among several characters. The experimental book resembles a collection of stories or essays rather than a traditional novel. The structure is loose and free, typical of Web writings, allowing the reader to read in a random order. The book is filled with details of landscape, food, clothing, entertainment, and other aspects of life in the Ming, and the tales of romance, political intrigue, and family feuds are woven in a language of classical grace and refinement. There is also a great deal of latitude and fluidity when the narrative travels through time and space. Yinxiang shu (A Book of Impressions), a more extreme experimentation than her previous work, is a novel without a story. The central theme of the book is the changing cultures of the living environment and the individual’s relationship to them, focusing on Taipei, Berkeley, Hong Kong, and mainland China but without mentioning their specific names. The narrative strategy is designed to foreground the intimate,\n\nexperiential connection between the self and the physical locale. What propels the narrative movement, however, is the language, the written word. In this work, Cao sets out to prove that a novel can be made with only words and imageries. Without the development and climax of a storyline, and without a protagonist, the novel relies on the beauty of the language to create humor, irony, and a sense of sorrow. Tang chu de huaban (Pedals of the Early Tang) is a collection of her early stories. See also WOMEN. CHEN BAICHEN (1908–1994). Playwright and fiction writer. Chen Baichen was born into a merchant family in Huanyin, Jiangsu Province. Influenced by the May Fourth Movement , Chen began writing new poetry and fiction in middle school. His first work, a short story, was published in 1925 in Xiaoshuo shijie (Fiction World). Chen attended the Shanghai Institute of Arts and the South China Institute of Arts, working closely with Tian Han and others to promote a new theater and to build the Chinese film industry. A member of the Left-wing Association of Chinese Writers , which he joined in 1930, Chen worked with progressive theater troupes including Minzhong jushe (The Mass Theater), Nanguo (South China), and Modeng jushe (Modern Theater). He joined the Communist Youth League and was arrested in 1932 for his political involvement. While serving his prison sentence, Chen wrote short stories and some one-act plays. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Chen moved to Sichuan and continued his work in the theater, leading and performing with troupes such as the Shanghai Film Troupe and the China Dramatic Arts Society. Many of the plays he wrote during this period denounced Japanese atrocities and aimed at boosting national morale. After the war, Chen returned to Shanghai and helped found the Kunlun Film Studio. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1950 and was appointed art director of the Shanghai Film Studio. He moved to Beijing in 1952 to take up the position of director of playwriting under the Ministry of Culture and later he was transferred to the Chinese Writers’ Association. In 1966, Chen moved to Nanjing and worked in the Jiangsu Provincial Association of Culture. He left his government job in 1978 to become a professor of dramatic arts and chairman of the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Nanjing University, a position he held until his retirement. Chen had a long and productive career. From the 1930s to the 1980s, he wrote more than 50 plays and screenplays. He is best known for his comedies and historical plays. Many of his comedies fall into the category of political satire, poking fun at the absurdities found in society under the Nationalist government. Luan shi nannü (Men and Women in Wild Times) mocks the degeneration of social mores; Jiehun jingxingqu (March to Marriage) disparages the repressive Nationalist regime; Sheng guan tu (Becoming Officials), a three-act play, satirizes the bureaucracy and corruption at the local level; Sui han tu (A Tale of Winter) centers on the futile effort of an idealistic medical doctor determined to eradicate tuberculosis. Chen’s films include Xingfu kuangxiangqu (Rhapsody of Happiness), about the miserable urban life after the Sino-Japanese War, and Wuya yu maque (The Crow and the Sparrow), which presents the total collapse of the economy and social order under Chiang Kai-shek’s government on the eve of the Communist victory. Chen’s historical plays are critiques of some well-known figures in\n\nChina’s past, focusing on the power struggle at the highest level. Shi Dakai de molu (Shi Dakai at the End of His Life) and Jintian cun (Jintian Village) deal with conflicts within the leadership of the Taiping uprising in the 19th century; Da feng ge (Ode to the Gale), written in 1979, portrays the political struggle within the imperial court in the beginning years of the Western Han (206 B.C.–23 A.D.). In addition to his plays, Chen also wrote novels and short stories, most of which expose social ills and express sympathy for the working poor. His first novel, Xuanwo (Whirlpool), was published in 1928, followed by three more: Yige kuanglang de nüzi (An Unruly Woman), Zui’e zhi hua (Flowers of Evil), and Guilai (Homecoming), all written under the influence of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies school . All would be later dismissed by him as nothing but “making a fuss about an imaginary illness” with no relevance to reality. See also SPOKEN DRAMA. CHEN CUN, PEN NAME OF YANG YIHUA (1954– ). Fiction writer. A Shanghai native, Chen Cun was sent in 1971 to a village in Anhui, where he stayed until 1975, when an illness allowed him to return to Shanghai. He studied political science at Shanghai Teachers’ College and worked for several years in the city government. He is currently a member of the Shanghai Writers’ Association. Because of a spinal disease that has permanently bent his back, he jokingly calls himself “Curve Man,” a nickname he sometimes uses as a pen name. Chen Cun deals with issues in everyday urban existence, and his stories are populated by ordinary folks who lead mundane lives without apparent drama. He is best known for his portrayals of teenagers in Shaonan shaonü yigong qige (Young Men and Women: Seven in Total), which tackles dilemmas faced by high school graduates who fail the notoriously grueling college entrance exams. In his characteristically humorous and mocking tone, he conveys the despair and rebelliousness of youths who try to maintain their equilibrium under tremendous social and parental pressure. His stories are not plot driven; the fragmented parts are connected by an ironic language that serves to direct and energize the narrative. Xianhua he (Fresh Flowers) is typical of Chen’s style. Without major events or a sustained plot, the book is a journal kept by a writer, sick at home, who records what he does and sees everyday, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, shopping for groceries, brushing his teeth, taking a bath, writing letters, making love, watching TV, and other such trivial occurrences. By cataloging banal trifles, Chen Cun aims to strip life of its pretense and return it to its essence, laying bare man’s vulnerabilities. Chen Cun is also a prolific essayist. He has written biting but good-natured satires, creating a persona who does not take himself too seriously while making fun of other people’s follies. His essays are collected in Wanren zishu (Confessions of the Curve Man) and Sishi hushuo (Making Nonsense at Forty). CHEN DONGDONG (1961– ). Poet. Born in Shanghai, Chen Dongdong graduated from Shanghai Normal University with a B.A. in Chinese literature. Considered a representative of the Generation III poets and often put in the camp of xueyuan pai (academic school), a\n\nloosely connected group based in college campuses that includes Xi Chuan , Zang Di , and Wang Jiaxin , Chen has worked as a teacher, an editor for opera and poetry journals, and a website designer among other careers. He began writing at the age of 20 and is known for having invented the terms xiju gan (comic effect) and lishi changjing hua (dramatized history). In poems such as “Xi ju” (Comedy) and “Chuntian: dubai he changing” (Spring: Monologues and Scenes), he creates a dreamy, dramatized world constructed with exquisite images, descriptions of scenes, and dialogues. The measured rhythm, refined musicality, and elegant sensuality that characterize Chen’s work are reminiscent of classical Chinese poetry. In “Shuzhuang jing” (Mirror) and “Dian deng” (Lighting the Lamp), the poet sets up vignettes of domestic intimacy, similar to those found in Song dynasty Ci poetry. Chen’s experiment with dramatization and ancient Chinese materials is most evident in “Liu shui” (Flowing Water), a long poem inspired by an ancient melody based on a legendary tale about music. Among the Generation III poets, Chen is believed to have the most classical sensitivity; however, the interplay between reality and imagination in his works is undoubtedly modern, and the syntax of his poems, along with his unconventional use of punctuation, reveals an experimental poet at work. CHEN JIANGONG (1949– ). Fiction writer, essayist, and screenplay writer. Born in Guangxi Province, Chen Jiangong moved to Beijing in 1957, when his economist father took a teaching position at the People’s University. In 1977, Chen was admitted to Beijing University, ending his 10-year career as a coal miner. In the early 1980s, several of his short stories won prestigious awards, establishing him as a promising young writer. Chen writes in the realistic mode and his works reflect his experience as a laborer and college student. He is particularly noted for his Beijing-flavored stories. Influenced by Lao She , also a Beijing resident, Chen uses an urban, street language consisting of traditional expressions and trendy slang, vividly capturing the unique features of the witty Beijing vernacular. His works include Miluan de xingkong (A Star-studded Dazzling Sky), Danfeng yan (Beautiful Eyes), Quanmao ( Curly Hair ), and Beijing ziwei (Beijing Flavor). CHEN RAN (1962– ). Fiction writer. Born and raised in Beijing, Chen Ran is considered one of China’s foremost feminist writers. She has written a number of stories that examine aspects of a woman ’s role and her shifting relationship to the world and the individuals around her. Chen’s female protagonists, all educated urbanites, are spiritual wanderers alienated from the outside world—depressed, lonely, hypersensitive, and rebellious. Her best-known work is Siren shenghuo ( A Private Life ), a psychological portrayal of a precocious, idiosyncratic adolescent girl growing up in an era of political upheaval. In this novel, the historical realities recede into the background, and the focus is on the coming of age of the protagonist, most notably her sexual awakening and youthful individuality. A Freudian psychoanalytic overtone and homoerotic sensuality give the novel a unique perspective into the inner world of the individual. Likewise, Shengsheng duanduan (Broken Sounds), a fictional account told in the diary form, presents the author’s observations on accidental occurrences in everyday life. In a distinctly intellectual voice, the narrator comments on seemingly randomly selected topics, often trivial events that trigger her thoughts and imagination, and frequently digresses from the\n\nmundane details to enter into a philosophical discourse. Other works by Chen include short stories “Wunü yu tade mengzhong zhi men” (The Witch and the Door in Her Dream), “Maishui nü he shougua ren” (The Wheat-ear Woman and the Widow), “Fan qiang dou shi men” (All Walls Are Ears), “Ling yi zhi erduo de qiaoji sheng” (The Knocking Sounds of the Other Ear), and “Pokai” (Broken). These tales feature single women who live by themselves, foregrounding a woman’s lonely battle against the outside world and the dysfunctional human relationships characterized by betrayal, suspicion, and miscommunication.
