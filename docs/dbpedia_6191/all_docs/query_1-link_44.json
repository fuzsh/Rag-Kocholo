Tom Kellogg provided production assistance, and the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch gave important logistical support for much of the research.\n\nThe report is the latest in a series of Human Rights Watch reports covering freedom of religion in China and Tibet. They include Freedom of Religion in China (1992), Religious Repression in China Persists (1992), Continuing Religious Repression in China (1993), Detained in China and Tibet: A Directory of Political and Religious Prisoners (1994), Persecution of a Protestant Sect in China (1994), No Progress on Human Rights (1994), Religious Repression Persists (1995), Cutting off the Serpent's Head: Tightening Control in Tibet, 1994-1995 (1996), and The Cost of Putting Business First (1996).\n\nThis report would not have been possible without the assistance of numerous women and men who helped collect, confirm, and publicize information about many of the incidents described in this report. For their own security, we cannot mention them by name, but we are enormously grateful to them all.\n\nI. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nReligion is becoming more and more important in China. In a country that remains officially atheist, conversions to Christianity have risen sharply, the country's 19 million Muslims are attracting the attention of their co-religionists elsewhere, and Buddhism is the fastest growing religion of all. The Chinese government acknowledges 100 million believers of all faiths out of a population of 1.2 billion, but it has been using the 100 million figure since the mid-1950s.\n\nAs interest in religion has increased, so has state control over religious organizations, in part because the Chinese government believes that religion breeds disloyalty, separatism, and subversion. Christianity and Islam in particular are seen as vehicles for foreign influence and infiltration by \"hostile foreign forces,\" and religion is a critical element of the nationalist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang, where opposition to Chinese rule appears to be growing. Chinese authorities are keenly aware of the role that the church played in Eastern Europe during the disintegration of the Soviet empire. As a 1996 government document titled \"Some Hot Issues in Our Work on Religion\" illustrates, the Chinese government believes that Western countries are aiming to \"achieve pluralistic political beliefs through pluralistic religious beliefs\" and that they have used religion since the 1980s to subvert socialist countries.\n\nGovernment control is exercised primarily through a registration process administered by the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau through which the government monitors membership in religious organizations, locations of meetings, religious training, selection of clergy, publication of religious materials, and funding for religious activities. The government also now undertakes annual inspections of registered religious organizations. Failure to register can result in the imposition of fines, seizure of property, razing of \"illegal\" religious structures, forcible dispersal of religious gatherings, and occasionally, short term detention. In Tibet, control takes the form of political vetting of monks and nuns and strict supervision of their institutions.\n\nWhile long-term imprisonment, violence, and physical abuse by security forces against religious activists still occur, they appear to be less frequent than they were at the time of the first Human Rights Watch study of religion in China in 1992. In 1997, we found isolated cases but no evidence of widespread or systematic brutality. When reports of these harsher measures do surface, they are increasingly denounced by central government officials as examples of the excesses of local officials and their failure to implement policy directives correctly. (It should be noted, however, that verifying reports of persecution and crackdowns remains very difficult, given restricted access to China.)\n\nEvery important Chinese leader and religious official has stressed that no\n\none in China is prosecuted for his or her religious beliefs but rather for suspected criminal acts. Tightening of control over religion, they maintain, has come only at the expense of illegal groups and illegal activities. There are two problems with that argument, however. One is that refusal to register and submit to the kind of intrusive monitoring outlined above is precisely what renders an organization illegal. The second is that for Chinese officials, religious belief is a personal, individual act, and they distinguish between personal worship and participation in organized religious activities. It is the latter that they go to great lengths to control, not the former. The whole concept of religious freedom, however, involves not only freedom of the individual to believe but to manifest that belief in community with others.\n\nThe government's argument that its control of religion is strictly in accordance with the law is not new; it argues the same when confronted with protests over its treatment of political dissent. But several elements of its policy on religion have changed. While lessening its reliance on arrests and detention, the government is enforcing requirements on registration more strictly than ever before. It has narrowed the criteria it uses for identifying \"authentic\" religious groups, distinguishing between the five officially-recognized religions - Buddhism, Daoism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam - and cults or sects practicing \"feudal superstition.\" As illegal entities with no claim to protection, the latter are subject to a distinct set of penalties. Popular religion, a syncretic blend of Daoism, Buddhism and polytheistic elements that is central to the lives of millions of Chinese, is not even acknowledged as a religion. The government is also increasingly engaged in carefully planned mass campaigns promoting \"socialist spiritual civilization\" and inculcating patriotism as an antidote to religion. Political reeducation for the public at large is a prominent feature of the campaigns. Another new tactic is the government's increasing tendency to target the China-based representative of an \"illegal\" religious network (usually a foreign proselytizing organization) rather than individual members. It used to be that any local pastor or lay leader of an underground church linked to a foreign movement faced arrest; more and more, the Chinese government seems to be looking for an organizer at the district or provincial level.\n\nIn the kind of intrusive control the Chinese government exercises over religious activities, it violates the rights to freedom of association, assembly, and expression as well as freedom of religion. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for the right to hold and express opinions and receive information and ideas \"regardless of frontiers\"; and Article 20 grants the right to peaceful assembly and association.\n\nArticle 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\n\nThe only limitations that a government can impose, according to the declaration, are those necessary to secure \"due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others\" and protecting \"morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.\" The peaceful gathering of unregistered groups is no threat to morality, public order, or general welfare; China's onerous registration requirements are clearly an unnecessary limitation on freedom of religion, particularly when failure to register results in some of the penalties outlined above.\n\nChina's narrow interpretation of freedom of religion as equivalent to freedom of private belief is contrary to the much broader international standard. In 1991, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution called \"Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.\" The declaration in Article 6 elaborates on the right to religious freedom, noting that it includes the following elements:\n\na) to worship or assemble in connection with a religion or belief, and to establish and maintain places for these purposes;\n\nb) to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions;\n\nc) to make, acquire, and use to an adequate extent the necessary articles and materials related to the rites or customs of a religion or belief;\n\nd) to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas;\n\ne) to teach a religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes;\n\nf) to solicit and receive voluntary financial and other contributions from individuals and institutions;\n\ng) to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief;\n\nh) to observe days of rest and to celebrate holidays and ceremonies in accordance with the precepts of one's religion or belief;\n\ni) to establish and maintain communications with individuals and communities in matters of religion and belief at the national and international levels.\n\nThus, the Chinese government's distinction between legal and illegal religious activities based on either willingness to register with the Religious Affairs Bureau and accept government control or on the nature of the beliefs themselves (the five recognized religions as opposed to \"sects\") is a violation of freedom of religion. Its efforts to restrict organized religions activities, vet the selection of religious leaders and location of meetings, ban \"unauthorized\" materials, break up \"illegal\" gatherings, and hamper communication with co-religionists outside China are also in violation of this right.\n\nIn a place like Xinjiang, wracked by political violence, where China may have a legitimate concern about Islamic radicals from Afghanistan, Kashmir, or the Middle East providing military training and arms to Uighur separatists, Chinese authorities have reasonable grounds for arresting those suspected of violence or, under some circumstances, searching homes or religious institutions. A violation of religious freedom takes place, however, when people are forbidden to gather for prayers, when mosques deemed to be \"illegal\" because they are not registered are razed, or when the distribution of purely religious material is halted.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe People's Republic of China has not yet implemented many of the recommendations made by Abdelfattah Amor, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance, when he visited China in 1994. With a mandate to monitor the implementation of the 1981 U.N. Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, Amor reminded his Chinese hosts that the declaration, which is not a treaty but a statement of principles, recognizes both freedom of belief and the right to manifest that belief. Human Rights Watch believes religious freedom in China would be significantly enhanced if China carried out the Special Rapporteur's recommendations which included the following:\n\n* amending Article 36 of the Chinese constitution, \"so that the right to manifest one's religion is recognized along with the already recognized right to freedom of belief.\"\n\n* adopting a text recognizing the right of freedom of belief and freedom to manifest that belief for all, including members of both the Chinese Communist Party and other socio-political organizations.\n\n* adopting an explicit provision guaranteeing freedom of belief for those under eighteen years of age so as to ensure compliance with theConvention on the Rights of the Child (ratified by China on March 2, 1992).\n\n* ending surveillance of a kind that violates the right to freedom of belief and to manifest that belief.\n\n* protecting the rights of those who hold \"theistic beliefs\" who may not be members of any officially recognized religion, in accordance with the 1981 Declaration.\n\n* releasing anyone detained for membership in \"unofficial\" religious organizations or for other peaceful religious activities.\n\n* carrying out human rights training, particularly on the subject of religious freedom, for state officials and judges.\n\nRecommendations to the People's Republic of China:\n\n* cease the practice of imposing administrative or criminal punishments against those who choose to worship outside the confines of government-approved mosques, monasteries, churches, temples, and meeting points.\n\n* abolish the registration process in its current form so that it does not act as a tool to restrict peaceful religious practices.\n\n* cease political vetting of religious personnel and, in Tibet, the practice of expelling those in monasteries and nunneries who do not meet political demands that infringe on their religious beliefs. All those expelled should be allowed to return promptly to their monasteries and nunneries.\n\n* lift the ban on communication between monks and nuns in Tibet and the Dalai Lama.\n\n* give unhindered access to the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet to foreign journalists and tourists.\n\nRecommendations to the International Community:\n\n* urge China to invite the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance to return to China to assess progress toward implementation of his 1994 recommendations.\n\n* include specific steps to increase freedom of association for religious groups as part of the broader agenda of human rights concerns discussed in the various bilateral human rights \"dialogues\" under way or scheduled between China and Japan, Australia, Canada, France, the European Union, and other governments. It should also be on the agenda for \"summit\" discussions of human rights concerns planned for later this year during the visits of Jiang Zemin to Washington and Ottawa, and Li Peng's scheduled visit to Tokyo in November.\n\n* encourage visits from Chinese religious leaders to religious communities in other countries in order to exchange views on the problems of implementing a policy of religious freedom.\n\n* include concern about China's restrictions on religious practices in a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights covering China's human rights practices more generally. Moves to sponsor and draft such a resolution should begin immediately.\n\n* develop a coordinated policy for pressing China to open Xinjiang and Tibet to international human rights monitors and foreign journalists on a regular and unrestricted basis.\n\n* discuss with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child how best to negotiate the release of Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the eight-year-old child recognized by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. The Chinese government has admitted to holding the child for \"safekeeping.\"\n\nII. THE THEORY: RELIGION MUST SERVE THE STATE\n\nThere is nothing trivial about religion. The management of religious problems is deeply concerned with politics, government policy and the masses....We must definitely adopt Lenin's attitude on such questions: \"Be especially cautious,\" \"Be most rigorous,\" and \"Think things over carefully.\"\n\n-- Ye Xiaowen, head of the Religious Affairs Bureau, March 14, 1996\n\nSince early 1996, Chinese leaders, in government and party documents, speeches, and articles in official publications, have consistently reiterated the three guiding principles for management of religion: adaptation to socialist society, supervision according to the law, and correct and comprehensive implementation of the party's religious policy.1 At the same time, they have made repeated reference to China's official atheism, its policy of separation of church and state, and the need for religion to serve economic development.\n\nAdaptation to socialist society\n\nThe Chinese government insists that religion must serve the state and adapt - or be adapted - to socialist society.2 According to one analysis, this means highlightin\n\ng moral teachings and curbing religious \"extremism.\"3 It also means a religion must adjust its \"theology, conception, and organization\" and interpret its canon and doctrine \"in the interests of socialism.\"4 According to Li Ruihuan, the Politburo member in charge of culture, this means that religious groups should help promote economic reform, or as a senior government official in Xinjiang put it, \"Ancient traditions and religions cannot become obstacles to development.\"5\n\nThe principle of adaptation undermines freedom of religious belief by insisting that any principles and doctrines of the five recognized religions that do not conform to socialism should be changed. Expressions of faith that the government does not recognize as \"normal\" are subject to punishment.6\n\nSupervision according to the law\n\nIncreasingly the government is citing violations of Chinese law as its pretext for dismantling churches, monasteries, mosques, temples or congregations that refuse to adapt, especially targeting those individuals and organizations that attempt to operate outside official bureaucratic control.\n\nThe emphasis on law - including the Chinese constitution, the criminal code, and various administrative regulations and policies - to control religion is a relatively new development that emerged in the 1990s. Broadly worded laws, such as those on \"counterrevolution,\" were, of course, in place long before and used against religious activists. But it was only in 1994 that a series of regulations on registration procedures for religious organizations and management of their activities was promulgated by the State Council.7\n\nThe emergence of these regulations may have been a response to what was seen by the government as a growing danger. It may have reflected an awareness on the part of the Chinese leadership that violence and force would neither succeed in preventing the growth of religion in China nor destroy religion's influence in society.8 It may also have been designed to appeal to the international community, which had generally applauded China's tentative steps toward legal reform. But the government appears to have concluded as well that the regulations work, and that their enforcement is a feasible alternative to harsher methods of repression. The stress during the last two or three years thus has been less on punishment of individual offenders than on \"lawful supervision\" and strict regulation of religious organizations. There has been an emphasis as well on strengthening officially approved religious organizations and workers, with particular focus on the need to build up a younger generation of patriots.9\n\nThis is not to suggest that the central government has succeeded in eradicating the use of extra-legal means to limit religious activity or that the laws in place are in accord with international human rights standards. But with surveys indicating that the faith of Chinese in the party and trust in a socialist future have declined, and with more and more people turning to religion, the government appears to be changing its methods of control and allowing its citizens to express their faith within the confines of the \"law.\"10 The laws themselves, however, are the problem.\n\nDangers of destabilization\n\nThe Chinese leadership argues that religion must \"conduct its activities so as to safeguard the unity of nationalities and national unification11 and resist \"exploitation of religion by hostile domestic and foreign forces.\"12 In 1991, well aware of the declining force of Marxism and the social dislocations brought about by economic reform, it launched a five-year \"socialist spiritual civilization\" campaign, with an emphasis on ideological education, patriotism, self-abnegation, dedication to the party, and rejection of bourgeois-liberal values. In November 1994, Zhao Puchu, president of the official Chinese Buddhist Association, noted at a seminar that by \"guid(ing) everyone to set up correct ideals, convictions and beliefs, a world view, and a set of values,\" the party hoped to check discontent brought on by discrepancies in economic development and by the center's demands on the provinces.13 Zhao noted that \"patriotic education\" was the means for\"inspiring the national spirit\" so as to overcome obstacles and to \"strengthen national cohesion.\"14\n\nOn August 11, 1996, Wang Zhaoguo, the director of Party Central's United Front Work Department, not only warned against splittism but inveighed against the use of religious issues by hostile international forces as \"a breakthrough point\" to \"westernize\" China.15 While stressing that the religious situation in China was stable, he tied \"recent\" problems to changes in domestic and international relations. The same viewpoint was expressed in the same language in an article analyzing China's religious problem which appeared in 1996 in a restricted circulation (neibu) magazine, one of the publications of Qiushi, the Chinese Communist Party's official theoretical journal. Wang's remarks followed a ten-day conference in northeastern China at which religious leaders discussed measures to strengthen patriotism among believers and to replace the aging clergy and religious staff with young and middle-aged well-trained leaders. In May 1997, an article in Tianfeng, the magazine of the official Chinese Christian Church, called on all Chinese believers to see patriotism as their Christian duty.16\n\nThe danger that religion poses does not just come from the West in the view of Chinese leaders. On June 14, 1997, in a listing of seven factors that could destabilize the country, top party officials included \"foreign radical religious forces (which) have greatly enhanced their influence in some areas occupied by minority nationalities.\"17 One such area is Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the northwest, with a majority Muslim population and a good percentage of party members openly professing adherence to Islam.18 The region, once known as East Turkestan, has anarmed separatist movement led by members of the Uighur ethnic group. While the movement is primarily nationalist and not religious, the Chinese government believes the rebels are receiving support from radical Muslim groups abroad. The Xinjiang government chairman clearly believes religion and disunity are linked. \"The biggest danger threatening stability,\" he said, \"comes from separatism and illegal religious activities.\"19\n\nSimilar charges have been made with respect to Tibet, where the Chinese leadership has put a high priority on preventing collusion between the \"Dalai clique\" and \"international reactionary forces.\" Again and again, Tibetan and Chinese officials accuse the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader, of using religion to engage in \"political infiltration\" and to sell his separatist ideas.20 The Chinese government likewise views the Catholic church as a potential destabilizing force, given its role in the overthrow of communism in Eastern Europe. It is deeply suspicious of Protestantism, officially called Christianity in China, because of the overseas connections of its missionary organizations, not only to the West but to Taiwan and South Korea as well.\n\nIII. THE BUREAUCRACY: AN INSTRUMENT OF CONTROL\n\nAs early as the 1950s, the Chinese government began to set up an elaborate bureaucratic supervisory structure so that religion might better serve the political ends of the state.21 With some shifts in emphasis, that structure remains. All key policy decisions are taken by the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the highest organ of the Chinese Communist Party. The United Front Work Department, a party organ, is responsible for implementing that policy. On the government side, the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau (RAB), organized according to administrative levels with offices at the provincial, municipal, district and sometimes county levels, executes policy. Each of the recognized religions has a \"patriotic association\" to help manage the relationship between church and government, seeing to it that directives are implemented on the local level and that any relevant information is transmitted to the center. The structure of these associations parallels that of the RAB.\n\nCatholicism and Protestantism have two monitoring bodies, one concerned with politics, the other more involved in ecclesiastical issues. The Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference, the leading national structure, is charged with implementing the \"three-self\" policy and approving the selection and ordination of bishops. The three-self policy, designed to remove foreign influence from religious affairs, maintains that all religious organizations should be self-administering, self-supporting, and self-propagating. The appointment of bishops goes to the heart of China's dispute with the Vatican, since it directly challenges the Pope's authority. The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA) is a mass organization of laity and clergy. Its purpose, under the leadership of the party and government, is to unite all Catholics in patriotism and to assist the Catholic Church in implementing the three-self policy.\n\nAll Protestants in China are united under one \"post-denominational\" church, on the theory that ideological, doctrinal, and ritual differences are secondary to the unity of Protestants insofar as patriotism and adherence to the three-self policy are concerned. The two organizations responsible for Protestant affairs are the China Christian Council (CCC), which is directly involved in internal pastoral affairs, and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), concerned with the relationships between individual churches and the Chinese government. According to its 1997 constitution, the TSPM's objectives are to foster patriotism\n\namong believers, strengthen unity among Christians, and protect church independence and autonomy. It is also charged with protecting the unity and stability of the nation and building spiritual and material civilization, all under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government.22 According to one of its officials, the TSPM was not established to control Christianity's development but to defend it against imperialist control.23\n\nIn recent years, Chinese officials appear to have promoted the importance of the China Christian Council at the expense of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, in part to assuage the historical antipathy of the Protestant community to the latter. Many believers suspect TSPM leaders of being atheistic, committed to promoting the party's interests rather than those of rank-and-file church members. In addition, believers resent the role the TSPM has played in persecuting congregations that have resisted registration. Church officials, on the other hand, stress the accomplishments of both organizations, such as arranging for Bible printing and distribution, helping negotiate the return of church property expropriated during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), easing registration requirements, and bringing local level persecution to the attention of central authorities.24\n\nMajor splits have developed between the \"official\" or \"open\" and the \"underground\" Catholic churches and between the official or open Protestant meeting sites and so-called house churches.25 Although there is no hard and fast line dividing the two sets of Catholics, members of the underground church recognize the authority of the Vatican, refusing either to register their churches or to obey the dictates of the Religious Affairs Bureau or the Chinese CatholicPatriotic Association. In some areas, the divisions are sharp and bitter; in others, official and underground clergy openly cooperate.26 In some cases, members of the officially-recognized clergy have secretly made their peace with Rome.\n\nOn the Protestant side, the division is between established denominations, such as Anglicans, Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Baptists, who have agreed to supervision by a lay bureaucracy and who aim to moderate Chinese religious policy by working from within the system, and a more conservative, aggressively evangelical wing. Those working from within the system are pushing for clear and comprehensive religious law. They argue that as the registration regulations have proven, a comprehensive law will protect them from arbitrary actions on the part of the state. It is far easier, they say, to fight for what is promised in writing.27\n\nAs vindication of their policy, they point to the growth in the number of Christian converts, although no one knows for certain how many there are.28 (The late chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference put the number of Catholics at 4 million, but the Holy Spirit Study Center in Hong Kong estimates that in 1996, China's Catholic population numbered 10 million.29 Sources close to the China Christian Council estimate the number of Protestants at between 10 million and 13.3 million, but some estimates go up to 35 million and even higher.)30\n\nSome aspects of the argument that working within the system creates space for growth, however, are flawed. To demonstrate growth, proponents compare current estimates of believers with the estimates from the Cultural Revolution period, a time when the government attempted to dismantle the entire religious infrastructure and persecute all believers. Moreover, much of the recent increase in numbers is attributable to the proselytizing efforts of conservatives willing to sabotage the government's \"three-fix\" policy that limits approved religious leaders to a fixed geographical location designated by the government. The evangelicals are much more wary of the registration process and of a legal system that remains tightly under the control of the party.\n\nIV: THE PRACTICE: STATE CONTROL OF RELIGION\n\nThe most important mechanisms for controlling religion are registration of organizations, restrictions on what sites can be used for religious activities, and restrictions on personnel.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration has been China's most important means of supervising religious affairs since 1991 when Document No. 6, a party and government circular entitled \"Concerning Certain Problems in Further Improving Religious Work,\" stated explicitly that \"all sites of religious activities must be registered according to law\" and that \"the specific procedures will be laid down separately.\" To date there have been three such regulations issued. The January 1994 \"Regulations Regarding the Management of Places of Religious Activity\" laid out specific rules applicable to religious sites and to individual practitioners; the May 1994 \"Registration Procedures for Venues for Religious Activities\" detailed the exact process to be followed; and the 1996 \"Method for the Annual Inspection of Places of Religious Activities\" added the requirement that all religious sites had to be approved on an annual basis.\n\nYe Xiaowen, the conservative head of the government's Religious Affairs Bureau (RAB), reinforced the importance of registration in early 1996 at a party meeting for all provincial RAB directors. At the gathering, during which he outlined the direction religious work would take in 1996, he listed completion of registration for all religious sites as the first priority. \"Our aim,\" he added, is not \"registration for its own sake, but...control over places for religious activities as well as over all religious activities themselves.\"31 According to China church watchers, even though registration was not completed by 1996 and the unpublicized new date is the end of 1998, the pressure to register has been fierce. One missionary summed up the impact when he complained, \"There has never been a year like 1996 for canceling our training seminars for house church leaders\n\n- it has simply been too dangerous.\"32\n\nBy registering, congregations agree to certain limitations on their independence including control over selection of clergy, supervision of financial affairs, veto power over building programs and religious materials, and restriction on activities such as education and social welfare projects. Proselytizing among those under eighteen is strictly forbidden. RAB officials can, if they choose, examine church sermons for content. Among proscribed messages are those that preach about the second coming, judgment day, and the biblical account of creation. Membership rolls are made available to government authorities, and every individual in an official church requesting baptism must fill out a form in triplicate with photos attached. One form goes to the RAB, one to the relevant patriotic association, and the third to the work unit of the person baptized. Should one of the religious agencies object, the baptism cannot legally proceed.\n\nThe forcible replacement in 1994 of senior pastor Yang Yudong at Gangwashi, a large registered Protestant church in Beijing, by the powerful head of the Beijing Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) is a good example of official control over church personnel. Officials in the religious bureaucracy could not countenance Pastor Yang's tolerance of political dissidents. During the 1989 pro-democracy movement, a banner inscribed \"Christians Support the Students\" hung across the front of the church, and numerous dissidents attended services at Gangwashi. Officials were also unhappy with the church's steadily growing congregation - it attracted many young people in particular - and with the unofficial church outposts in Beijing's suburbs that Yang had established.\n\nThere are also less conspicuous examples of bureaucratic interference in the assignment of clergy to official churches. The eighty-year-old leader of a 1,500-member Protestant congregation in Guangdong province had proposed a candidate to succeed himself. In early February 1997, the local TSPM committee turned down his proposal, and there were no other candidates.33 The Catholic community in the island province of Hainan has been without a priest since December 1996, but as of mid-May 1997, the Qingyuan city TSPM had not responded to requests that a priest be sent there.34\n\nWhen Catholic or Protestant priests meet with foreign guests, they must often do so in the presence of patriotic association cadres or are later asked to give an account of their conversations. If official clergy have frequent contact withunderground clergy, these same cadres will pressure them to report the details of the meetings.\n\nThe 1996 regulation mandating annual inspection of religious sites, which applies to all registered religious venues at the county level or above, also underscores the government's continuing reliance on registration as its chief management tool. Inspectors look to see that religious organizations are, among other things, conducting activities in accordance with national law and policy, maintaining a good financial situation, operating democratically, registering on time, and accepting annual inspection within applicable time limits. To establish compliance, local officials scrutinize all major religious and foreign-related activities including visitor lists, financial management, changes in conditions of registration, and changes and management of enterprises and properties. Those places that refuse inspection or fail to rectify the problems identified can be warned, ordered to cease their activities, or have their registration revoked.\n\nRefusal to register no longer inevitably means arrest, however. In July 1996, municipal authorities in Beijing targeted Yuan Xiangzhen (Allen Yuan), a house church leader well known to religious and city officials, who had spent twenty-two years in a labor camp for refusing to join a patriotic association. His refusal to register had been overlooked in the interest of demonstrating China's benign religious policy. (A similar tolerance had been demonstrated in the case of one of China's best-known pastors in Guangdong, Samuel Lam.) The authorities had kept members of his congregation under close surveillance and did monitor church functions, but while they occasionally pressed Yuan to register, they generally left him alone. At the end of July, however, authorities ordered him to register or merge with either Gangwashi or Chongwenmen, two major Protestant churches in Beijing. These two churches not only were registered but had pastors closely linked to the local Religious Affairs Bureau. Finally, on August 7, after more visits by Public Security Bureau and RAB officials, the eighty-three-year-old preacher opted to end all Sunday services. Yuan continued pastoral visits and held services in city parks; he also held a youth meeting and a Bible class in his home. On March 9, 1997, a police officer asked that the Bible class be disbanded because it was illegal and \"disrupted neighborhood harmony.\" Three participants were told that they had better worship at one of Beijing's larger churches. At the end of March, Yuan was told to keep the number of congregants down and not to let them stand in front of his house. To keep from being charged as a public nuisance, he prohibited singing during meetings.35\n\nIn a case in suburban Jiaxing, Zhejiang province, which appears to have resulted from failure to register a religious site, the Religious Affairs Bureau detained three peasants for maintaining a \"meeting point.\" The arrests of Sister Wu and the two others came on July 25, 1996. On October 11, two of the three received one-and-a-half-year \"reeducation through labor\" sentences; the third was administratively sentenced to a two-year term. All three were accused of \"spreading evil propaganda to disrupt social order.\" The \"meeting point\" was not new; the three had maintained it at Dragon Bridge, Xincheng, for twenty years and had refused repeated requests by the prefectural RAB to join the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. On the evening of July 24, several hundred workers sent to the \"meeting point\" by the suburban RAB branch disrupted the meeting, confiscated the 100,000 renminbi (approximately US$ 11,000) building fund and all clothes, food, and other articles used in the church, and destroyed the eight meeting point houses. The three who were sentenced spent more than four months in the Beihua detention center. During that time, no mail reached the prisoners and postcards from the three were smeared so badly they could not be read.\n\nRestrictions on religious places and personnel\n\nOnce a religious group has been vetted and registered, its members are still not free to engage in what they would consider normal religious activities. A series of central government regulations provides guidelines for determining what is \"legal\" and what is not; provinces, municipalities, counties, and other legal geographic jurisdictions have the authority to be even more restrictive when they issue implementing regulations. The November 30, 1995 \"Regulations from the Shanghai Religious Affairs Bureau\" are a case in point.\n\nThese regulations, which took effect on March 1, 1996, are comprised of sixty-three articles covering religious organizations, personnel, religious activities and where they can take place, religious institutes and properties, foreign contacts, and penalties for infringement. The document begins by acknowledging that the regulations are \"formulated...to maintain lawful supervision over religious affairs...\" (Article I) and that religious organizations \"must...accept government supervision\" (Article 11). In addition to the restrictions placed on organizations, personnel, and activities, the regulations require religious organizations \"lawfully constituted\" in Shanghai to \"promote socialism, patriotism and education in government legal systems...\" (Article 11). They end by vesting the power of interpretation in the Shanghai Religious Affairs Bureau (Article 62).\n\nPenalties for \"infringement\" of the regulations can be severe. They progress from warnings and cease-and- desist orders to revocation of registration and confiscation of \"structures, facilities...or income,\" to fines as high as 50,000 renminbi (approximately US$7,000) for organizations and 500 renminbi(approximately US$70) for individuals. Publication and distribution of religious materials is subject to \"pertinent regulations\" (Article 12), nowhere defined. Church-run business enterprises require approval (Articles 14 and 25) despite limitations on donations and the need to be self-supporting. Other articles require authorization for exhibitions or displays (Article 25), ban so-called superstitious activities (Article 28), limit the sites at which religious activities can occur (Article 29) and the persons authorized to perform public religious celebrations (Article 31), and ban religious debates (Article 32). Religious institutes such as seminaries are subject to similar strict regulation (Articles 35-39).\n\nAs for Shanghai religious personnel, they must be registered with the municipal Religious Affairs Bureau after having been vetted primarily by patriotic associations (Article 16). They cannot travel to other parts of China for religious purposes without approval from local religious organizations and registration at the municipal RAB. Religious visitors must follow the same procedure (Article 18). Foreign travel for religious purposes or invitations to foreign religious visitors are similarly subject to regulation (Article 48). The latter are expressly forbidden to \"increase the number of believers among Chinese citizens\" (Article 52).36\n\nA set of local implementing regulations from Jingxian county in Hebei province dealing with rules for religious visitors from outside the county mandates even stricter controls. A guest must report to the entry and departure desk at the local Public Security Bureau (PSB), apply for temporary residence, and provide a copy of the application to the local Religious Affairs Bureau. After his departure, the hosting unit must submit a written report about the visitor's activities to both bureaus. As a precaution against unplanned events, an outsider who comes to visit friends or relatives or as a tourist also must notify the PSB and RAB of his or her planned activities. Visitors bringing money or gifts must first list their value and planned use in reports to those same bureaus. When the time comes for a donation actually to be put to use, an estimate of the total cost of the project must be submitted to both agencies and permission to proceed secured. A financial report of the project's income and expenses is required every six months.37\n\nIn addition to regulating places of worship and religious personnel, government bureaucrats supervise seminary education, (and see to it that it includes a large political component). They vet visiting religious scholars, and they approve candidates for religious study at home and abroad. According to several sources, an August 1996 internal document for use by the Religious Affairs Bureau and other religious institutions tightened conditions for seminaries wishing to invite foreigners, including Hong Kong residents, to teach. Before August 1, visiting theologians could teach in seminaries as long as a bishop or seminary official issued an invitation and the local RAB approved. Since August 1996, permission must be obtained from the State Education Commission of the State Council as is required of all Chinese universities and technological institutions. The Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference and the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA) did ask central authorities to take into account the special circumstances of seminaries but apparently to no avail. According to Liu Bainian, vice-chairman of the CCPA, as of July 14, 1997, the official Catholic Church had not even discussed how to implement the decree.\n\nImplementation of the regulation is a good example of how decrees from central authorities are applied to local jurisdictions. The document itself has had limited circulation and has been enforced differently in different provinces. In Shaanxi province, the rector at Xi'an seminary stated that he did not even know about the new regulation.38 By contrast, in Wuhan, Hubei province, it apparently has been strictly enforced, especially in relation to priests and others from Hong Kong holding home visiting permits. In either February or March 1997, Father Thomas Law, who had been at Wuchang seminary only a few days, was asked to leave immediately because the school allegedly had not obtained the necessary permit. Father Law had taught in mainland seminaries for some seven years before his arrival at Wuchang.\n\nStudy abroad has also become more difficult. Even though a program has been in effect for religious students for almost a decade, the numbers of approved candidates, which had been rising, dropped precipitously during 1995 and 1996.39 Many students who apply to the RAB and the Justice Ministry for passports after they have been accepted by institutions abroad and even offered scholarships are turned down without explanation.\n\nReligious publishing\n\nReligious publishing is also strictly controlled.40 The Shanghai Guang Qi Research Center (GQRC), China's largest Catholic publishing house, had to wait for government approval before it could begin publication of the New Catechism of the Catholic Church in China.41 The delay had to do with negotiating a compromise on the use of certain terms and finding a way around the chapter on abortion. The GQRC, which supplies printed materials to Catholic churches throughout China, also needed official permission to expand its operation. Its publications may only be distributed in certain, authorized outlets.\n\nProtestants face the same restrictions. The Chinese Christian Council determines the number of authorized Protestant Bibles to be printed and sells them through fifty centers at about half cost. By June 1997, the fully licensed Amity Printing Company had produced some 15 million Bibles, but local shortages mean that unregistered church members sometimes have difficulty obtaining them.42\n\nSuppression of the Catholic underground\n\nAs noted above, the Catholic organizations and congregations that continue to recognize the authority of the Vatican constitute the Catholic underground. Officials are determined to narrow the space within which the underground can maneuver and make use of a variety of means to do so, including mass campaigns, surprise raids, and imposition of fines apparently designed to bankrupt the underground church.\n\nCooperation between the district party secretary, the public security chief, and officials from the Religious Affairs Bureau resulted in the detention of at least eighty and possibly as many as 120 members of underground Catholic churches near Linchuan city, Fuzhou district, Jiangxi province, beginning on November 14, 1996. The preemptive strike appeared to be an attempt to stop local underground members from congregating on Yujia mountain on Christmas Day. The mountain had become the site of gatherings of thousands of people on important Catholic feast days, and the gatherings were frequently subject to raids. Forty-two of those initially detained in the November 1996 strike have been identified. According to a Religious Affairs Bureau official in Linchuan, the detained Catholics were \"notarrested but sent to attend `learning classes.' And they were all released.\"43 Other sources report that Chinese authorities extracted stiff fines, in some cases amounting to a half year's income, before permitting releases, but that at least some of those detained may have been still in detention as of September 5, 1997. The exact number, their identification, and the fate of the other November 1996 detainees are unknown.44\n\nLess than a week after the November 1996 incident, a seven-month \"united\" campaign began in nearby Donglai township, Chongren county, Fuzhou district, ostensibly to curb the \"illegal\" activities of the underground Catholic church, to strengthen the administration and standardize the conduct of religious activities, and to promote social stability. According to a document issued by the Donglai Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party outlining a staged action plan, the growth in the Catholic population was attributable to \"intensified infiltration by hostile religious forces and elements outside our borders and unlawful activities of underground religious forces.\"45 The campaign's aim, therefore, was to stop all \"illegal\" activities, force believers in the villages of Donglai, Shanbei, and Leifang, among other areas to join the official church, crush the Catholic underground network, and cut off local \"illegal\" elements from foreign contacts. According to the document, the involved officials and team members were to \"handle political issues as non-political issues, and religious issues as non-religious issues.\"\n\nTo accomplish their ends, the Donglai Communist Party branch initiated a strategy of \"transformation through education, divide and disintegrate, unite with the majority and attack the few.\" During the preparatory phase, the county's \"workforce\" was to be combined into \"spiritual civilization propaganda force\" teams to be stationed in recalcitrant villages, and a propaganda campaign to target different groups of underground clergy, core elements, and the mass of believers was to be designed and \"customized.\"\n\nTeams were required to visit every family and make friends among the villagers. Then, with the help of the police, they were to set up files on every member of the local and transient populations. Team members had to undertakeparticular study of certain targeted groups, including clergy, believers within the government, the party, and other communist organizations, and those responsible for \"illegal activities.\" The study involved an effort to understand their \"activity schedules, overseas connections, the degree of stubbornness, the traits that could be taken advantage of, and their psychological characteristics.\"\n\nDuring the first half of December 1996, party members, young activists, underground clergy, and leaders were required to study religious policies, laws, and regulations and the national spiritual civilization drive. The need to \"unify the thoughts\" of party members so they could become strong enough models to counter the influence of the underground was, in fact, \"the first objective.\" The creation of \"a reserve force of zealous young people\" to help the party was another prime objective. The reeducation class directed at clergy and core elements aimed to indoctrinate them in party policy and objectives and to make them aware of activities that were \"unreasonable and illegal.\" Only a few \"stubborn\" and core underground members were to be \"strictly controlled.\"\n\nOther measures, all deemed legal, called for first sealing minor centers of illegal religious activities, then registering and reopening them; isolating believers and forcing them to sign confessional statements accepting the official church; thoroughly destroying any underground monastery or convent that could be located; and eliminating any large scale illegal assemblies such as those anticipated on Christmas. To accomplish the latter, residents were to be warned that they could not leave their home villages nor were they allowed to have visitors. Exits were to be blocked, and licenses for vehicles and equipment used for religious purposes were to be revoked and their users fined.\n\nAuthorities paid particular attention to proselytizing among minors, calling for infiltration of schools and strict punishment for students carrying religious materials and teachers performing illegal religious activities. Interference with other government directives on the pretext of religion, such as family planning policies, was also to be dealt with firmly but on a case-by-case basis. The final consolidation phase called for setting up a permanent religious surveillance group for the villages.\n\nAmong the ten propaganda slogans listed in the Donglai document, one banned gatherings on Yujia mountain and warned that violators would be \"severely\" punished. Others banned the \"hosting\" of religious visitors or the offering of sites or supplies for illegal activities; such actions would result in severe punishment. Other slogans referred to \"criminal activities committed in the name of religion\" and \"illegal missionary activities.\"\n\nTo date, no information about actual implementation or the results of the campaign are available.\n\nThe Jiangxi document is only one of several that illustrate the government's methods of religious control. Another comes from Baoding diocese, northern Hebei province, another stronghold of underground church activity. In this case, the information comes from an appeal letter to the government of the People's Republic of China dated June 15, 1996. The letter is signed by Bishop Su Zhimin, the underground bishop of Baoding diocese. It details not only a well-planned operation that had started six months earlier but considerable abuse as well.\n\nIn his letter, Bishop Su asked the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to investigate the \"serious unlawful encroachment on the citizens' rights and to administer corrective measures.\" The letter detailed how, starting in April 1996, \"task forces from the city and county government, under the guise of helping Catholics escape from poverty,\" used economic and social sanctions, such as suspension of retirement benefits and loss of working permits, as well as force, to \"persuade\" Catholics to renounce allegiance to the underground church. Some 4,000, almost 10 percent of the Catholic population, did so. Of the total, three quarters were under eighteen years of age. To accomplish their ends, work teams arranged to have school children expelled, teachers dismissed, round-the-clock study groups substituted for field work, and residents confined to their villages. In one village, Da Hou, inhabitants had to report in eight times a day and were fined 100 renminbi (US$12) if late. Believers were required to sign a \"Certificate of Warranty,\" actually a renunciation pledge, guaranteeing that the signatory would abide by official religious policy, avoid all contact with underground clergy, and oppose the infiltration of foreign religious powers, i.e., the Vatican. According to Bishop Su, in two villages, Nansong and Nanmanying in Qingyuan county, many of those who refused were tortured.\n\nThe authorities targeted buildings as well as people, authorizing armed police to tear down or seal churches and \"prayer houses.\" In Quankun village, some 300 armed police were deployed to close the village church. Another church was converted to a kindergarten. Even a home for the elderly in Tiangezhuang was forced to close. In May 1996, as part of the same effort, Bishop Su continued, Chinese authorities took extraordinary measures to end what had been an annual month-long pilgrimage to a Marian shrine in the village of Donglu. Many of the details are still not known, but it seems clear from other sources that despite roadblocks, people did succeed in entering Donglu and that at the height of the tension, police deliberately demolished at least part of the shrine. Cui Xingang, the parish priest in Donglu, has been in and out of detention since his initial arrest inMay 1996. At last report, in June 1997, he had again disappeared.46 Secular authorities took it upon themselves to decide what was, or was not, holy. They argued, \"There is no foundation for asserting that Donglu is a so-called sacred place and therefore cannot be venerated as such.\"47\n\nBishop Su himself went into hiding for seventeen months after the Donglu crackdown. He was reportedly taken into custody on October 8, 1997 in Xinji, Hebei province and returned to Baoding under public security bureau escort.\n\nEvidence of mass campaigns came also from northern Zhejiang province in the form of a March 1, 1997 secret document (No. 19) from the Tongxiang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The document indicated that the campaign outlined in an earlier internal (neibu) document, dated February 27 and entitled \"Opinion Concerning Carrying Out the Special Struggle to Curb the Illegal Activities of Catholic and Protestant Christians According to the Law,\" had been approved by the Tongxiang municipal government. Both documents were circulated to the party committees and governments of the villages and townships and to departments of various municipal organs, factories, and mines directly under municipal authorities.\n\nThe February 27 document was a product of the municipal-level Public Security Bureau and the United Front Work Department. Its language lends some credence to the assertion that local campaigns are mounted in response to higher level directives. After declaring that Tongxiang had already \"embarked on the course of working within the legal framework\" to implement the party's policy toward religion, it goes on to claim that the municipality had to extend its efforts because \"infiltration and subversive activities on the part of outside hostile forces that use religion as a means to 'westernize' and 'divide' our country had increased.\" The language almost duplicates that used by the director of Party Central's United Front Work Department in an August 1996 speech, as well as the language in \"Some Hot Issues in Our Work on Religion.\" The Tongxiang document went a step further in expressing alarm at \"contacts\" established between Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThere is also evidence from the document that Tongxiang officials planned to use other laws to \"supervise\" religious activities, including the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations to crack down on large-scale meetings, assemblysites, and training classes; urban construction and land codes to close down churches; and laws governing printing and publishing to restrict dissemination of religious material. From the repeated mention of \"criminal\" activities in the February 27 document, it is reasonable to assume that China's criminal law will also be invoked.\n\nThe Tongxiang campaign is reminiscent of that in Donglai. It established a special party-led team with offices located in the municipal Public Security Bureau to coordinate the effort. At the township level, it mandated work teams composed of recruits from public security; the united front department; government offices of religion, propaganda, civil affairs, and education; the procuratorate, the courts; city construction agencies; and trade union, youth, and women's organizations. Authorities identified three major problems. The first, the \"three struggles,\" referred to competing for influence with \"self-styled missionaries\" who used \"such illegal methods as making house calls and visiting the hospitals\" to win followers; competing for members against house churches which \"set up meeting places close to the open churches;\" and competing for influence between different recognized religions and between different denominations. According to the February 27 document, the other two identified major problems, the existence of three churches not under official control and sixteen smaller unregistered \"sites,\" \"adversely affected the building of socialist spiritual civilization and social stability.\" In addition, the document declared that the problem of minors and party members becoming believers had to be addressed.\n\nAs a counter to this, the document recommended isolating missionaries and influential figures from the general populace, strengthening the daily supervision of religious affairs, pushing ahead with registration, shutting down illegal sites, and persuading Christians to switch allegiance to government-controlled congregations, thus promoting divisiveness within both the Protestant and Catholic communities. The entire effort was to last through June 1997. No information about the effects of the campaign are available.\n\nThe February 27 document proposed that after the work teams thoroughly understood the underground and missionary forces and had collected legally valid evidence, they should embark on an in-depth education campaign coupled with more forceful measures. For example, \"illegal assembly sites...should be...put under long-term control of the local police stations and public security committees,\" and underground bishops and priests and \"self-styled\" missionaries who \"cannot yet be punished according to the law,\" should be \"placed under strict surveillance.\" Finally, the document makes clear the secret nature of the work, warning the news media not to report on the campaign.\n\nIn contrast to the carefully planned campaigns, the Public Security Bureau also makes use of unannounced raids on unregistered sites and unofficial personnel. In Shanghai, for example, public security officers made two raids a month apart on clergy connected to the Catholic underground. In the first raid, on March 4, 1997, eight agents in a three-and-a-half-hour search confiscated Bibles, rosaries and other religious articles, and 20,000 renminbi (approximately US$2,400) from the home of eighty-one-year-old Coadjutor Bishop Fan Zhongliang, an underground church leader and a veteran of more than twenty years in Chinese labor camps.48 At the time, the Public Security Bureau, as it always had, was maintaining a close watch on the bishop's activities, including monitoring the Sunday services in his house. Bishop Fan had been saying mass at home every Sunday, at first to hundreds, and from March 1996 on, to less than twenty-five, in hopes of avoiding police interference.\n\nIn the second instance, a five-hour raid at the home of Father Zen Caijun, which began on the night of March 29 and lasted into March 30, 1997, Easter Sunday, netted more religious articles, cash, a telephone, a video recorder and other electronic equipment.49\n\nFewer details are available about a police search that same month at the home of underground Bishop Xie Shiguang in Fu'an, Fujian province, only that money and religious books were confiscated.50 But earlier, in June 1996, Public Security Bureau officers searched the Fu'an church and confiscated tens of thousands of US dollars. When no explanation was given for how the church came to have such a large amount of foreign currency, auxiliary Bishop Huang Shoucheng and two priests were held for several hours, then sent home. That same evening, Bishop Xie fled to the countryside and hid for several weeks before venturing back to Fu'an. A year later, the money had not been returned, and church leaders and government officials were still negotiating. Part of the government'sinterest in Bishop Xie is in learning more about the underground in all of Fu'an county and the surrounding area.51\n\nSuppression of cults\n\nOne of the tactics by which the government limits religious organizations is by labeling some groups as cults or sects rather than as legitimate offshoots of any of the five officially recognized religions.52 A Public Security Bureau circular, issued sometime between April and August 1996, revealed that the central government had authorized a crackdown on rural cults.53 The document specifically mentioned the \"counterrevolutionary\" Shouters (Huhan Pai), a Protestant group.54 But other persecuted groups include the \"counterrevolutionary\" Daoist Yi Guan Dao and the Buddhist Self-Nature Association;55 the Blood and Water Holy Spirit, an \"illegal infiltrating organization\" founded by visiting Christians from Taiwan;56 the heretical Lingling, Wilderness (Kuangye Hui), and Disciples (Mentuhui); and groups such as the Born Again (Cong Sheng). An internal article puts the number of cultists at 500,000 spread across most provinces, autonomous regions, andmunicipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing) and advocates that severe measures be taken.57 It charges members with raving about breaking down central control in rural areas where party domination is weak, and raising the slogan, \"seize church power first and then take over the political power.\" The document goes on to accuse members of sabotaging production, creating \"social panic,\" and undermining \"social order.\"\n\nAs regards some of the alleged cults, mainstream Christian doctrine holds that the belief structure and/or means of expressing faith are heterodox and undermine the integrity of religious doctrine. Examples include one group's stricture that salvation can only come through membership in that particular assembly; belief that only certain practices, such as continual weeping for several days and nights, can earn salvation; a leader's proclamation that he is the savior returned or that the date of Judgment Day is set and known. Chinese authorities then seize on the heterodox label to prove the illegality of the alleged cult or sect, marking its practices as \"feudal superstition\" rather than religious expression. In many instances, they make little or no attempt to differentiate between so-called cults and unregistered house churches.\n\nReligious Affairs Bureau head Ye Xiaowen singled out cults that \"seriously threatened social and political interests\" as unlawful. He went on to say, \"Most of the ringleaders were pleasure seekers who hated work. They distorted religious doctrines, created heresy...and attempted to overthrow the government; or they also used superstitious beliefs to fool the people...or they had group sex, raped women, and defrauded people's money.\"58\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, for outsiders to verify or refute the accusations. As one informant explained, \"If they meet in the dark, they get accused of rape.\"59 Another explained, \"When we try to collect a tithe, we are accused of trying to cheat people or amass wealth. When we preach that `there is hope in this world so we believe in God,' the government says it means that it (the government) is hopeless and we want to overthrow it.\"60\n\nThe March 16, 1997 arrest of Xu Yongze,61 leader of the Born Again movement, raised alarms throughout the Christian evangelical community in the U.S. when it was reported erroneously that he was slated for execution.62 At least seven others were arrested with him in Zhengzhou, Henan province, a center of the evangelical movement in China. Some of those seized were active in unity talks that had been taking place since November 1996 among leaders of house church movements. The Shouters, labeled heterodox by the orthodox Christian community, and the True Jesus and Born Again movements, were among those represented. On May 20, Xu reportedly was transferred to an unknown location, and on September 25, he was reportedly sentenced to a ten-year term by the Zhengzhou Intermediate Court. Of the other seven arrested, Xu's wife, Qing Jing; Qin Musheng and his older brother; and a woman called Sister Fengxian were believed to be still in detention as of October 1997. The status of three others, Wang Xincai, a Shouter from Lushan county, Henan,63 Elder Qiao and Brother Sun remained unclear. A ninth detainee, Hsu Chu-chun (Xu Zhujun), a Taiwanese woman now a U.S. citizen, was interrogated and released.\n\nThe Protestant community both inside and outside China is divided as to whether the Born Again movement is heterodox. Chinese religious authorities insist it is, because the three-day crying period that is required before a penitent is considered to have repented, been reborn, and saved does not fit with orthodox practice. Han Wenzao, president of the Chinese Christian Council, went so far asto say that \"Xu is not a Christian at all\"; and that his detention was in accordance with the \"Regulations on the Registration and Administration of Social Organizations.\"64 Han insisted that Xu \"poisoned people's minds by spreading the views that 'the end of the world is coming, and disasters are falling down,' illegally gathering and instigating people to do no normal work but cry collectively every day. Many people became distraught and could not cope with their own life. And the normal life and production of local people were also seriously affected.\" Han went on to contend, \"The detaining of Xu is definitely not persecution of Christians by the Chinese government, but a normal handling of criminal persecution,\" comparable to the United States and Japanese measures against the Branch Davidians and the Aum Shinrikyo respectively.\n\nThe Jiangxi Legal News reported a crackdown against the Blood and Water Holy Spirit in 1996.65 On May 9, 1996, public security officers in rural Xinjian county, Jiangxi province, shut down the sect, took what the newspaper called \"lawful measures\" against its leader, Zhang Guihua, and required her twelve followers to undergo a course of \"intensive education and study\" and to sign \"certificates of repentance.\" According to the report, sect members did promise to cease their \"illegal activities,\" including the distribution of Bibles and \"attacking and denigrating the religious policies of the Communist Party.\" Zhou Zuoyun, the first local leader of the Blood and Water Holy Spirit, was administratively sentenced to a two-year \"re-education through labor\" term in 1993 and reportedly was on the run after his release in January 1995.\n\nSuppression of evangelists and overseas missionaries\n\nThe government's demand that church leaders be assigned to one location and that their activities stay within a fixed geographic sphere, conditions that have to be met for registration to be approved, effectively proscribes all evangelical activities.66 Religious officials use the edict to try to curb the activities of indigenous evangelists. In April 1997, in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang province, and the surrounding rural area, as many as 200 evangelical leaders were detained. In an unusual move, police rounded up the leaders one by one. They were not picked up in the usual fashion, that is during a police raid on a religious meeting wheneveryone present who cannot manage to escape is seized. At least one leader was still in custody as of May 10, the others were released after paying fines averaging 500 renminbi (approximately US$60), an exorbitant amount by rural standards. Such fines are designed to bankrupt a locality's missionary network.\n\nThree police raids in three and a half months on a house church in Xiangshan, Huadu, Guangdong province, are illustrative of attempts to crush a missionary network. During the first, on March 15, 1996, all the chairs and Bibles were confiscated. The books had been printed by the officially licensed Amity Press in Nanjing. In this case, an overseas ministry had supplied the Bibles to the church. During the raid, worshipers were subject to body searches. In the second raid, on June 21, police took chairs and Bibles that had replaced those taken in the first raid, as well as tables and a tape recorder. They seized Yang Qun, at whose home the meeting was in progress, and his seventeen-year-old son, Jiang Guoxiong. They confiscated the latter's money and watch but issued no receipt. A week later, thugs reportedly hired by the police interrupted the meeting, took bedboards and new Bibles, and told the participants that if they continued to meet, excrement would be spread all over the house and the believers. By the end of August, Jiang had been released, the house church was still meeting, but electricity to Yang's home had been cut.67 Human Rights Watch was not able to determine whether Yang Qun had also been released.\n\nOn August 25, 1996, a Chinese official formally asked his Republic of Korea (ROK) counterpart to put a stop to the large numbers of illegal Korean missionaries operating in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces in northern China disguised as businessmen or teachers.68 Local government officials, as opposed to those in Beijing, are more reluctant to expel the missionaries, as they are appreciative of the amount of economic activity Koreans generate within the region.\n\nThe Korean government agreed to try to meet the request from Beijing. According to the ROK Foreign Ministry, in December 1996, four missionarieswere detained and held for a week.69 In early January 1997, according to an unconfirmed February report, twelve South Korean evangelists \"disappeared\" near China's border with North Korea. South Korean government officials were aware of the alleged incident, but they were reportedly unwilling to use diplomatic channels to bring the incident to the attention of Chinese officials for fear of upsetting relations. Three South Korean men detained in June allegedly confessed to \"setting up missionary posts, soliciting believers and looking for agents to propagate their religion in Shanghai.\"70 They were subsequently expelled and their resident permits confiscated. By July 1997, at a briefing for foreign reporters, Han Wenzao, CCC president, openly condemned South Korean missionary activity and the secrecy with which it was being conducted.71\n\nLegal restrictions on the education and training of religious practitioners have facilitated government crackdowns on evangelical pastors and lay instructors. The case of thirty-one-year-old Fu Xiqiu, now in the U.S., is an example.\n\nIn China, Fu, a Christian since 1989, had to lead a double life, teaching English in the elite Beijing Party School but at the same time running a Christian training center. On May 9, 1996, after the first twenty-five students had completed their required three months of training and were at least minimally prepared to work in the flourishing rural house church movement, seven men, one a Public Security Bureau officer in uniform, accosted Fu as he was leaving the Party School saying they wanted to talk with him at his home. After confiscating Bibles, video cassettes, and teaching tapes, the officers took Fu and his wife, Cai Bochun, to an interrogation center and subjected them to round-the-clock questioning. They threatened that unless the pair revealed the names of their co-workers and international contacts, their own families would be jailed. Two days after the search, husband and wife were moved to the Chongwen branch of the Beijing Police Station and asked to sign a document that accused them of illegal evangelization. Fu signed.\n\nFor the next two months both Fu and Cai were questioned intermittently. They were released on July 8, but not before signing a document admitting that they had violated two regulations, Nos. 144 and 145, and that Jonathan Chao, president and director of China Ministries International - Chinese Church ResearchCenter, was a Taiwanese spy and CIA operative. (Over the last few years the organization has moved its headquarters and operations from Hong Kong to Taiwan.) Police clearly expected that the couple would cooperate with them in exposing a missionary network.\n\nOn July 10, the philosophy department at People's University, where Cai had already completed all required work for her master's degree, refused to grant it. Instead she was told to report for her assigned work at the Public Transportation Company. On July 29, after repeated telephone calls about job arrangements proved unsatisfactory, Fu and Cai visited the company and were informed that Cai had to return to school. On July 13, a Mr. Ma from the Public Security Bureau picked them up, drove to a park, interrogated them about their contacts, and demanded written reports. They refused. On July 18, Fu was told that he had lost his job, that his salary was canceled, and that he had two months to move. The order, he learned, had come from \"higher ups\" in the Central Committee of the Beijing Communist Party and in the Beijing municipal government. By July 29, the pair had been given a few weeks to make a substantial report or face rearrest. Cai, by then pregnant, was also accused of having a baby without permission. In August, despite invitations to study in the U.S., Fu and Cai were refused clearance to travel. By September 10, knowing rearrest was imminent, they fled. By October 12, they had reached Bangkok. A co-worker also managed to escape China.72\n\nSuppression of \"feudal superstition\"\n\nThe vast majority of worshipers in China are those whose allegiance is to what is generally termed popular religion, but they are denied recognition as adherents of a true religion.73 Their beliefs and practices instead are relegated by the Chinese government to the realm of \"feudal superstition\" or \"folk belief.\"74\n\nAccording to an internal party document, a major concern is the ability of superstition to enhance the influence of religion.75 Chinese scientists, arguing the government position, maintained that \"it is high time to declare war on the rising popularity of superstitious activities.\" They described two other major problems, both issues of government control.76 One is the danger to social stability represented by superstitious practitioners in a position to organize complaints about local conditions; the other is their ability to arrange pilgrimages. The former strengthens the hand of those who have not benefitted from \"socialist reconstruction,\" or who have been the target of corrupt practices, for example, those who have lost their jobs or been subject to excessive fees and taxes. Pilgrimages give people interested in changing local conditions access to ideas beyond their immediate locale. Feudal superstition, in the form of construction and maintenance of temples and tombs, or in the form of festivals and feasting, also wastes resources, including land, that would be better spent on the development of the productive forces.77\n\nDifferentiation of religious from superstitious belief and practice is not easy. Certain practices, such as geomancy and fortune-telling are tolerated. Others, divination, palm reading, casting of lots, exorcisms, and healing, generally are not, but censure varies from place to place. Furthermore, the rituals and beliefs of many practitioners form a syncretic blend originating in popular religion, Daoism and/or Buddhism. Association with either of the latter two removes the stigma of involvement in a non-religion. Fazhi Ribao, China's leading legal newspaper, did publish suggestions for an anti-superstition law that would set standards for distinguishing between superstition and legal religious customs, but to date no public information about the process is available.78\n\nThe campaign against superstition has led to widespread destruction of religious buildings. During a sustained campaign between February and June 1996 in the coastal province of Zhejiang, 15,000 temples, churches, and tombs weredestroyed; Ningbo, a major Zhejiang city, alone razed 3,000 temples.79 On June 26, a provincial party committee secretary's work meeting \"studied the ideas and measures for intensifying the drive...\" pointing out that the work was long term and \"some localities have yet to set things right....\"80 In addition to funeral and burial reform, the report promoted intense ideological education to root out \"superstition and advocate science.\" It also affirmed the fact that the \"dismantling\" itself had not been completed and that some buildings, rather than being destroyed, were to be converted to other uses. Emphasis on superstition in the report is the only clue that the temples might be neither Buddhist nor Daoist.\n\nInformation from other locales or other recent incidents of suppression of popular religion had been scant, but by September 1996 the magazine Democracy and the Legal System, citing figures for temple restoration or construction in Fujian, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, expressed alarm at the \"resurgence of `superstitious practices'...growing without limits in China.\" Part of the concern was directed at the growth of feudal practices such as \"astrology, palmistry and fortune telling\" outside rural communities; part at the depiction of deities in schools and cultural centers; and part at the amount of arable land occupied by tombs.81 Seven months later, in April 1997, it was reported that the Religious Affairs Bureau and the United Front Work Department issued a joint circular ordering a strict ban on the building of temples and outdoor Buddhas. According to their figures, there are 40,000 unauthorized temples, eight times the number of legal sites, and 150 illegal Buddhas. In addition, all small temples - according to the circular they are located in rural areas - \"controlled by sorcerers, witches, and professional superstitionists shall be resolutely banned.\"82\n\nV. REPRESSION IN XINJIANG\n\nThe rhetoric of Chinese government leaders in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is similar to that used elsewhere. In June 1997, for example, the Xinjiang government chairman, Abdulahat Abdurixit, called on patriotic religious leaders to \"energetically give publicity to the party's policy on religion, educate the broad masses of religious believers to love their country and their religions and make new contributions to the autonomous region's social stability.\"83 Earlier he had reinforced the party's dictum that religion must conform to socialism.84 But the government's efforts to control religion in Xinjiang are complicated by nascent movements for independence or autonomy, where Islam and Uighur identity are closely linked. Government assaults on unauthorized Islamic practices are difficult to separate from efforts to quell political violence, such as that which took place in the town of Yining (Ghulja in the Uighur language), Ili-Kazak prefecture, in February 1997.\n\nThe government appears to have begun an intensified campaign to bring Islam under control at a Xinjiang regional party meeting in early May 1996. The resulting document made clear that as far as Xinjiang officials were concerned, religion was an instrument for fostering separatism in the area and that both Muslims and the West were implicated in the effort.85 A year later, Xinjiang's chairman reiterated the point, declaring that \"a handful of separatists and religious elements...whipped up religious fanaticism and preached a 'holy war.' They openly\n\nthreatened to kill pagans...\"86 The consistent linking of separatist activity to religious \"elements\" by Xinjiang officials resulted in the announcement that both illegal religious activities and separatists would be the main target of law enforcement in 1997.87 The result was a severe crackdown on religious education and publishing, mosque construction, and \"illegal\" religious activists and activities. Party cadres who \"insist on following a religion\" were also a target.88 But details are scanty, in part due to the ban on foreign reporting from the region.89\n\nInformation from Ili on the religious aspect of the prefecture's rectification effort, a sustained campaign to bring all religious activities and activists under government control, comes mainly from official sources. Focusing on strengthening the management of religious affairs \"according to the law,\" the authorities, after investigation, \"shut down 105 privately-run scripture classes (talipu); \"dispersed\" 499 underground scripture students; \"closed or changed to other uses\" 133 mosques that had been built without approval after February 1995; \"ferreted out and struck at,\" among others, \"ringleaders of extreme religious forces\"; and arrested forty illegal religious activists. In fact, the report boasted that in Ili \"illegal religious activities were cleaned up...district village by village, hamlet by hamlet.\" Part of the work concentrated on religious activities at schools and resulted in the denial or revocation of teaching certificates to those who continued to \"disseminate national separatist views.\" Five school officials in Nilka County No. 3 Middle School were removed.90 The report also hints at an education campaign, mentioning that the prefecture has been instructing \"all ethnic groupsin patriotism\" and had \"distributed an outline on religions and laws.\" An unofficial report named the head of the Ghulja Islamic Society, Abdushukur Abliz, as one of those arrested. Another report noted that a forty-year-old Uighur textile worker employed at the Islamic Society was seized on March 25, but no further information about him is available.91\n\nAccording to the National United Revolutionary Front, a Uighur nationalist group based in Kazakhstan, the crackdown was not confined to Ili.92 In Turpan, public security officers searched 200 mosques and schools on February 16, 1997 and arrested twenty-one mullahs and other staff members from Koranic schools. Staff members who were not arrested were forced to sign pledges of non-participation in separatist activities.93\n\nOne aspect of the crackdown in Xinjiang has been an education campaign focused on law and regulations. The campaign was sponsored jointly by the regional United Front Work Department, the Regional Nationalities and Religious Affairs Commission, and the Xinjiang Socialist Academy and directed at \"representatives from ethnic religious circles.\" Its purpose was to increase public awareness of the need to abide by existing laws. Another part of the campaign targeted Muslim cadres and was coupled with a harsh crackdown on illegal religious activities. The campaign was one indication that central government directives, which are often less rigorously applied in national minority areas, would be strictly enforced in Xinjiang. In May 1996, the party secretary of Xinjiang studied an allegedly successful program of \"rectification\" in Qiar Bage Township. Its focus was on demonstrating the advantages of party membership over religious belief. Township level party branches helped local party committees to revitalize themselves, even allocating money for a party school complete with video equipment and for building an \"electronic education station.\" A program of agricultural, scientific, and technological training was begun in order to raise the living standards of party members as examples to the general populace of the advantages of membership. In addition, ideological education among cadres wasintensified, and older cadres were pressured to renounce religion.94 In Turpan prefecture the aim of \"in-depth atheist education\" was to foster tighter legal control over religion through attention to the beliefs of party members. Tactics included lectures, discussions, one-on-one \"talks\" and \"concentrated training.\"\n\nXinjiang authorities, including the Party Propaganda Committee, the United Front Work Department, the Press and Publications Department, the Culture Department, and the Nationalities Affairs Commission, have not neglected control of religious literature. Even \"formal\" Islamic scriptures require approval before they may be printed; Islamic religious materials can be sold only at designated locations; and, as with all religious materials, there are strict limits on importation.95\n\nVI. REPRESSION IN TIBET\n\nNowhere are politics and religion more intertwined than in Tibet where Tibetan Buddhism is an integral part of Tibetan national identity, the Dalai Lama is both a spiritual and political leader, and many Tibetans see political independence as the only way of ending the Dalai Lama's exile and ensuring his return. Because monasteries and nunneries are so frequently centers of support for the Dalai Lama, Chinese authorities see the control of religious institutions across the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and the Tibetan areas of Gansu, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Qinghai as critical to prevent political destabilization and the spread of \"splittist\" sentiment. The effort at control has intensified steadily since 1994 and has been characterized by a campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama as a religious leader; a massive reeducation effort in the monasteries and nunneries to instill loyalty to Chinese rule and end support for Tibetan independence or autonomy; substitution of secular leaders for monks in the most important monasteries; and interference in the selection of the Panchen Lama, the second most important Tibetan religious figure. In the process of the campaign, now in its fourth year, more than 150 Tibetans have been arrested.\n\nAnti-Dalai Lama campaign\n\nThe campaign to denounce the Dalai Lama was institutionalized at the Third National Forum on Work in Tibet in July 1994.96 Two years later, it was reaffirmed in the \"Outline of the Tibet Autonomous Region's Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and its Long-term Target for 2010,\" approved on May 24, 1996 by the Fourth Session of the Sixth Regional People's Congress.97 In a chapter on splittism, the Dalai Lama is castigated as the \"chief villain,\" who must be \"publicly expose[d] and criticise[d]...stripping away his cloak of being a `religious leader.'\" By mid-November 1996, the party chief in Tibet had launched the \"final attack,\" blaming the Dalai Lama for \"feudal superstition and for promoting a range of customs that were endangering Tibetans' ability to\n\nmodernize.98\n\nThen, in mid-April 1997, the party school in Tibet announced a meeting had been held to \"penetratingly expose and criticize the Dalai's crimes\" through the study and publication of four articles. Its report made clear that the Party Central Committee had endorsed the assessment. One of the articles asked, in reference to the Dalai Lama, \"Religious leader or obstacle to building religious order?\" In it, the Tibetan leader was accused again of trying to \"wreck Tibet and the Buddhist religion\" and of using religion to \"split the motherland.\"99 The campaign has not ceased. On September 7, 1997, in the official China Daily, he was similarly vilified for using \"the cloak of religion...to restore his previous privileges, lands and serfs....\"100\n\nA ban on display of Dalai Lama photographs began in November 1994 when government employees were told they could not keep his picture in their rooms. In January 1996, some temples and monasteries were ordered to remove the photos. By April the ban, initially applying only to temples and monasteries, had been published, but later in the month some public places, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, were told they, too, would have to comply. By May 1996 schools were affected.101 And in at least one section of Lhasa, house to house searches reportedly began on May 20.102\n\nA major protest involving several hundred monks began on May 6, 1996, when a team of party cadres ordered monks at Ganden monastery, one of Tibet's most important institutions, to immediately remove all photographs of the Dalai Lama from display. When officials refused to talk with a group of monks, the latter began to sing and dance in protest and then to throw stones. One official was severely beaten in a five-minute burst of violence during the incident. The following day, a large military force which had gathered during the night, fired warning shots, then invaded Ganden. Several monks were badly hurt during the shooting; one later died of his wounds. More than ninety monks were detained, and at least fourteen were sentenced. Two days after the incident began, Ganden was closed for rectification.\n\nIn late June 1997, there were reports that immediate enforcement of the ban had been somewhat relaxed. The head of the Religious Affairs Bureau in Tibet reportedly admitted that it \"takes times to change people's mentality...It is up to us to persuade the population to stop worshiping his image.\"103\n\nReform and reeducation in the monasteries\n\nThird Forum policy also set out guidelines for stricter supervision of monasteries and nunneries. As part of the effort, officials targeted the composition of Democratic Management Committees, leadership bodies that had responsibility for such items as monastic discipline and curriculum. These committees were set up in each monastery in the 1950s and reinstituted when the monasteries reopened after having been closed down during and after the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Following the Third Forum, candidates for those leadership positions first had to be vetted by secular authorities.\n\nThe order was combined with a program to \"reeducate\" all monks and nuns in patriotism and to adapt the tenets and practices of Tibetan Buddhism to a socialist society. In addition, the government put a new emphasis on programs to limit both the numbers of monks and nuns and the numbers of monasteries and nunneries. In June 1995 an official team was created to register all temples and monasteries. In February 1996 Chinese leaders ordered the closure of politically active monasteries and required the replacement of all monastic leaders not certified as patriotic. Officials boasted at that time that \"The overwhelming majority of lamaseries and the broad masses of monks and nuns in our region have been able to make a clean break politically with the Dalai...However, we should also soberly see that the negative influence of religion has expanded to a certain extent in recent years and that numerous problems still exist in some lamaseries.\" By December, according to the official Tibet Daily, a new \"management team\" was inaugurated at Drepung, the largest monastery in Lhasa, charged with running its affairs and finances and ensuring that all its monks were appropriately patriotic.104 Speeches at the inauguration ceremony indicated that after five months of reeducation, a thorough purge of \"reactionary\" personnel had been completed. It is not known what happened to those who were purged.\n\nThe reeducation campaign, which began at Tibet's three most famous monasteries, Sera, Drepung, and Ganden, had reached some fifty monasteries andnunneries by June 1997, according to one report.105 By September 1997, more than 900 of 1,700 monasteries had been reached, with 30,000 of 46,000 monks and nuns affected.106 In the exact language used by Han Wenzao of the Chinese Christian Council, Tibetan officials compared the crackdown on monasteries to steps taken in the U.S. against the Branch Davidians and in Japan against the Aum Shinrikyo.107 Ragdi, executive secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, went so far as to say that the political indoctrination campaign and democratic management had rescued the monasteries from chaos. Reports in June, however, implied that officials had reassessed the drive because the harsh tactics and penalties employed were backfiring.108\n\nAs originally conceived, the campaign was designed to educate monks in patriotism and \"the views of the government,\" \"implement the party's policy of religion totally and correctly,\" and create \"harmonious co-existence between the religious and socialist societies.\" It included a demand that monks express their opposition to the Dalai Lama.109 Reeducation teams, averaging one member to four monks, lived at monasteries for three months; some teams, in a show of political clout, included senior provincial and prefectural officials.\n\nA July 15, 1996 document issued by the Sera Democratic Management Committee, \"The Important Points to be Understood by All the Sera Monks During the Study Session,\" is the most complete account of the drive's purposes andmethods available.110 At Sera, which housed some 400 monks, a \"bad attitude\" in reeducation classes was grounds for expulsion. Monks were required to study four textbooks, part of the series \"Explanations and Proclamations for the Propagation of Patriotic Education in Monasteries Throughout the TAR\";111 be quiet and disciplined, stay until the end, and take notes at lectures; keep their reeducation manuals clean; attend meetings, smaller classes, and tutorials; do one continuous hour of homework a day; \"actively speak out and contribute\"; and \"speak from their hearts to officials.\" At the time the seventy-member reeducation team was in residence, daily monastic debates were suspended.\n\nIn late August 1996, some Sera monks issued a four-page statement indicating their refusal to denounce the Dalai Lama and to yield to other demands of the \"Loving the Motherland and Loving Religion\" campaign. By this time, some thirteen monks had been arrested for activities related to their refusal to go along with the campaign.\n\nThe regulations for Drepung monks, similar to those at Sera monastery, called for each monk to speak out \"one by one\"; for written and oral exams; and for those monks \"with bad attitudes and poor results\" to be expelled. The \"Five Points, Two Choices\" system in place at Drepung gave monks little room for differences of opinion. Either they were willing to denounce the Dalai Lama, accept that Tibet had been a part of China for centuries, and acknowledge the legitimacy of the Chinese government's selection of the new Panchen Lama, or they could resign.112 The case of twenty-one-year-old Ngawang Tharchin is an example. On October 25, 1996, two weeks after interrupting a lecture by a well-known Tibetan historian to deny that Tibet had been an integral part of China for centuries, he was administratively sentenced to a three-year \"reeducation through labor\" term which he reportedly is serving in Trisam prison. Four others were taken into custody in connection with the drive, and at least sixteen resigned before sitting for the written exam. Officials had distributed the correct answers inadvance to ensure that the monks knew explicitly what was expected of them in written form.\n\nSome 150 monks at Ganden monastery were formally expelled at the end of August 1996 for \"going against the nation\" by failing to answer some questions correctly, for example what four crimes the Dalai Lama had committed. Ninety-two of them were ordered not to go to Lhasa unless they were from there originally but to become farmers or traders outside the capital. Officials made clear that none of the ninety-two would be able to rejoin a monastery.113\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Tenchok Tenphel, a monk from Sakya monastery, some eighty kilometers outside of Lhasa, died on September 14, 1996 in the Sakya detention center, the end result of an argument with reeducation officials.114 He had been arrested on September during a ritual dance performance in front of Chinese officials. Although his family was told he had committed suicide, local sources reported he died of abuse. His body was cremated without family members having viewed it and apparently without an autopsy being performed. A second monk, Gendun Gyaltsen, the caretaker of the main chapel, was taken away in metal thumb cuffs on August 23 after pictures and cassettes of the Dalai Lama were found in his room. Released after a week, he was expelled from the monastery.\n\nReports from rural areas indicate that as late as June 1997, monks were still passively refusing to cooperate with reeducation officials. In Gongkar county, Jampel Tendar, a twenty-year-old from Choede monastery, was arrested after several monks refused to denounce the Dalai Lama in writing. Instead they chanted prayers for him and argued against claims that it was actually China that had introduced religious freedom to Tibet and that had financed reconstruction of Choede. In Nyemo county monks were locked in their rooms for at least three"
