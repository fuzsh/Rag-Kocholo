        "text": "Dongqian Lake is the largest freshwater lake in eastern Zhejiang, and its area is three times larger than that of West Lake. Dongqian Lake began to open in the Tang Dynasty, and it has a thousand years of history. Dongqian Lake has a long history. In every era, there are government funds to carry out special maintenance and treatment, which shows the importance of this lake to Ningbo! Going to Dongqian Lake, the biggest feeling is: Dongqian Lake is really beautiful. He does not have the fame and crowds of the West Lake, but it is beautiful and varied. The entire Dongqian Lake is surrounded by mountains. In the southeast of Dongqian Lake, it is Fuquan Mountain, the northwest is Yuebo Mountain, and the east is surrounded by Tornado Mountain and Ewha Mountain. It is no wonder that some people say that Dongqian Lake has \"Xizi scenery, Taihu Lake\"."
