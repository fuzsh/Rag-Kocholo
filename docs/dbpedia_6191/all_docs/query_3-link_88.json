        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in humans, ranking third in morbidity and second in mortality worldwide. The incidence of CRC is rising rapidly in the Asia–Pacific region[1]. Nearly half of the patients have a life span of < 5 years due to late diagnosis and potentially progressive disease. The majority of CRCs arise from adenomas; that is, the classical adenoma–carcinoma sequence (ACS)[2]. ACS is a series of events by which colorectal adenomas develop, initially showing low-grade dysplasia, and some progress to high-grade dysplasia and eventually invasive carcinoma[3]. Prior research has shown that identifying premalignant stage lesions (adenomas) of CRC by colonoscopy and subsequent endoscopic resection can prevent disease progression and reduce CRC-associated morbidity and mortality[4,5].\n\nAngiogenesis, the secondary growth of blood vessels, plays an important role in tumor development[6]. Angiogenesis mediates the transition from hyperplasia to dysplasia and is a necessary condition for the growth of solid tumors[7]. The surface capillaries of colorectal tumors often show morphological changes, such as heterogeneity in vessel diameter or density and loss of hierarchical structure[8]. Although the importance of tumor angiogenesis is well known, conventional endoscopic images cannot be used to display these changes in capillaries due to inadequate resolution. No studies have yet been conducted on changes in microcirculatory hemodynamics of colorectal adenomas in vivo under endoscopy. In clinical practice, we found that a novel high-resolution magnifying colonoscope (Fujifilm EC-760ZP) with blue-laser imaging (BLI) can clearly display mucosal surface capillary networks in vivo and in real time.\n\nIn this study, we observed the superficial microcirculation of colorectal adenomas using the novel magnifying colonoscope with BLI and quantitatively analyzed the changes in hemodynamic parameters, thus providing a new insight into the early colorectal tumors.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe pathway of CRC progression through ACS is well known, so early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma are crucial to reduce the risk of CRC development[4]. Various enhanced imaging techniques have been developed to improve the ability of doctors to recognize neoplastic lesions such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) (Olympus), i-SCAN (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) and flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (Fujifilm)[12]. BLI (Lasereo System; Fujifilm) is another form of NBI. Instead of using filters for white light to produce narrow bandwidths, the BLI system is equipped with light sources that emit two different wavelengths of laser light. A laser with a wavelength of 450 nm can stimulate phosphors to produce white light illumination, while a BLI mode laser with a wavelength of 410 nm can be used as a high-contrast signal to obtain information on mucosal vascular patterns and surface patterns, thus achieving visual enhancement of surface vessels and structures[13,14].\n\nAlthough the importance of neoplastic angiogenesis is widely recognized, there is strong evidence that induction of angiogenesis may occur early in the ACS, with angiogenic conversion occurring at the same time as tumor invasion[2,15,16]. However, there are no quantitative data on the indexes of capillary microcirculation of colorectal adenoma under endoscopy and in the surrounding normal mucosa. Blood flow in capillaries on the mucosal surface of the colon can be clearly observed under high-resolution magnification endoscopy with BLI, which provides a possibility for quantitative analysis of microcirculatory changes in colorectal adenomas.\n\nWe found that capillaries on the normal colorectal mucosal surface were arranged around the annular adenoid tube, while capillaries on the surface of the adenoma lost their normal structure. The capillary length per unit area on the surface of adenoma was shortened and vessel density was reduced. In addition, compared with the surrounding normal mucosa, the vessel width on the surface of the adenoma was increased and BFV was decreased. Nowadays, endoscopists usually use the JNET classification for microsurface structure and microvascular pattern. It is subjective in nature, and there is still some disagreement[17]. However, through our quantitative calculation with high-resolution magnifying endoscopy with BLI, we found that the width and variability of capillaries on the surface of the adenomas increased, which could confirm the rationality of the (JNET) classification. Further studies are warranted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that image-enhanced endoscopy using NBI and BLI can be used to characterize known lesions by enhancing mucosal vessels and structures[18]. The use of BLI can significantly improve identification of adenomas, but there are no studies on microcirculation of colorectal adenoma under endoscopy[19,20]. To date, the only study on tumor vessels is a scanning electron microscopy study of cast colorectal vessels, which has provided spatial tissue information of tumor vessels, as well as quantitative results of morphological characteristics and diameter of individual vessels[21,22]. The normal mucosal capillaries of the colorectum presented a honeycomb arrangement around the mucosal glands, while the vascular layer in the adenoma was lost, which was consistent with our endoscopic observations. Further quantitative analysis showed that the vascular space in the adenoma was narrowed, the density was increased, the vascular width was increased, and the dispersion was greater. However, the vascular density of colorectal adenomas was decreased in our study. The difference in vascular density between the two studies may be related to different definitions. In the previous study, vascular density was defined as the spatial density of blood vessels in the lesion, which was related to the volume of blood vessels and the distance between them. We defined vascular density as the length of microcirculation capillary blood vessels on the adenoma surface within a unit area[11]. We only studied the changes in surface vessel length and did not involve deeper vessels. Figure clearly shows that the software automatically recognized the capillaries on the surface of the adenoma, while the deeper and thicker vessels were not included in the analysis.\n\nFor the first time, we quantitatively analyzed the changes in capillary BFV of the colorectal adenomas, and the decreased velocity in the tumor may explain the failure of tumor drug therapy, because slower blood flow affects the delivery of drugs to the tumor, thus reducing their effectiveness. We found that these changes were largely related to the progress in endoscopic imaging technology. The emergence of high-resolution magnification endoscopy provides us with the possibility to study the changes in microcirculation-related indicators of colorectal adenoma.\n\nOne limitation of our study was the small sample size, which means that the results are not widely representative. In the next study, we will increase the sample size and further analyze the changes in hemodynamic indicators related to the surface vascular microcirculation of polyps, adenomas and adenocarcinomas. This will provide a new theoretical basis for the diagnosis of early colorectal tumors and the possibility of active recognition of colorectal lesions with AI technology under endoscopy.\n\nIn conclusion, high-resolution magnifying endoscopy can be used to quantitatively analyze the microcirculation on the surface of colorectal adenomas. The superficial vessel density in the adenomas was decreased, with more irregularity and slower blood flow."
