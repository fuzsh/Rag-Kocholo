27 Feb â€“ Despite the ongoing contractual dispute with his management company, Chinese Entertainment Shanghai (Tangren), it was reported that "Bu Bu Jing Xin" actor, Lin Gengxin is rebelling against his agency's wish to return for the drama sequel, "Bu Bu Jing Qing" by participating in another drama instead.

Jayne Stars reported that not only that the actor was unwilling to attend functions and shoots arranged by Tangren, Gengxin also agreed to star in Ringo Yu's upcoming period drama, "Legend Of Dance" without Tangren's knowledge.

With Gengxin's absence at the press conference of the said drama in Ruili, Yunnan on 24 February, Ringo Yu was asked if Tangren was notified about Gengxin's casting in the drama. However, the actor-turned-director simply answered, "I don't know."

When asked if he is planning to sign Gengxin under his company, Ringo hinted, "It depends on whether the conditions are ripe or not."

Jiang Xiaorong elaborated Ringo's statement, saying, "We never interfere with people's conflict with their companies. Lin Gengxin's casting was arranged by our management team. His dispute with Tangren is his business and he will have to solve his own problems. We will not get ourselves involved."

Meanwhile, as for whether Gengxin will appear in "Bu Bu Jing Qing", Tangren's representative stated, "We sent him the casting notice today. We really want the original cast to return. Kevin Cheng also promised to return in August to make a guest appearance."

The company also stressed that if Gengxin continues to refuse job offers, the company will pursue legal action.
