        "text": "John Lynch said Monday his secret ascension to the 49ers general manager role came out of necessity, partly so he could learn more about the 49ers’ chaotic state “without the world breathing down my throat.”\n\nOf course, he also wanted to be respectful of his family’s privacy and his role as a Fox Sports broadcaster.\n\n“I’m incredibly appreciative and fortunate in this world that things stayed quiet,” Lynch said on a media conference call. “It allowed me to truly assess this situation, to ask the tough questions, to just get with the people I’m going to be working with, and (as for) any elephant in the room, just get rid of it and ask questions.\n\n“I didn’t need the job so it gave me a great position to be very forward. I asked those questions and I’m proud of the way that happened and the way they responded.”\n\nLynch had reason to be skeptical after arguably the worst season in 49ers history, which included a 13-game losing streak en route to a 2-14 record that led to the firings of general manager Trent Baalke and coach Chip Kelly.\n\nLynch spoke from Houston while honoring commitments to Fox Sports ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl. He’s been constantly on the phone as he considers reassembling the 49ers front office, and he announced no changes Monday.\n\nLynch said he will report directly to Jed York, but he did not confirm an ESPN report that the 53-man roster will fall under the control of presumptive coach Kyle Shanahan. Lynch will otherwise oversee the 90-man, offseason and camp roster as well as the draft and free agency.\n\n“The most important thing I can do is I articulate the vision I have for this team to everyone in this building,” Lynch said. “It’s important to articulate who we want to be and the type of people we’re looking for. … I can’t get the film in front of me quick enough to evaluate the roster.”\n\nThe league’s tampering rules prevent Lynch from commenting too far on his plans with Shanahan. But he did explain why he approached the Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator two weeks ago about partnering as his GM.\n\n“Two weeks ago I never thought I’d be doing this. Things change sometimes,” Lynch said. “Fortunately I have a wonderful family that’s supported me incredibly in pursuit of this situation that arose. I’m also very thankful to Jed York and everyone else with the 49ers that found it fit and had enough confidence in me to take on this role.”\n\nLynch considered joining the Denver Broncos front office a few years ago, and he said a couple other organizations recently approached him about his services.\n\nHe became enticed by the prospect of working with Shanahan after calling the Falcons’ playoff-opening win over the Seahawks in the divisional round. They talked in the days after the game, and Lynch met with 49ers CEO Jed York last Thursday before flying with him to Atlanta for another meeting with Shanahan, who is not allowed to talk to the 49ers this week and can’t be hired until after the Super Bowl.\n\n“Kyle must have been real fired up to have called Jed and put Jed in touch with me,” Lynch said. “I felt it was really important that I was vetted like any other general manager candidate was. I didn’t want to be, just because someone liked me, that I was all of a sudden went to the front of the line.”\n\nLynch noted that before even entertaining the 49ers’ GM vacancy, he considered Shanahan “the catch of this head-coaching cycle,” and Lynch got even more excited once he discovered Shanahan’s philosophies “marry with mine.”\n\nThe 49ers’ surprisingly hired Lynch on Sunday after a four-week search in which they announced interviews with eight other candidates, including Saturday’s follow-up sessions with George Paton and Terry McDonough.\n\nLynch, 45, has never worked in a NFL front office. But he played 15 years as a star safety for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Denver Broncos, leading to his possible election Saturday to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Since 2008, he has stayed connected to the league as a broadcaster.\n\n“I can’t tell you I’ve had 20 years in front offices working my way up,” Lynch said. “But what I do know is football. I’ll put that up against anybody in this league. And I know people and I know how to lead.”\n\n“As we learned more and more about John, it became apparent that he was not only one of the best to ever play this game but also a Hall of Fame caliber man, one who people are compelled to follow,” York said in a statement in which he also praised Lynch’s work ethic, communication skills, competitive spirit, love of the game and “tremendous insight into what it takes to create a culture that breeds sustained success.”\n\nLynch finished his playing career with the Denver Broncos from 2004-07 under coach Mike Shanahan, Kyle’s father. At the same time, Kyle was launching his NFL coaching career, first as a Buccaneers offensive assistant from 2004-05 and then with the Houston Texans in 2006-09.\n\nLynch inherits a franchise that has at least 10 draft picks, including No. 2 overall, as well as some $100 million in salary cap room to spend on free agents.\n\nLynch expects to surround himself with a solid personnel staff, and he intends to consult at least initially with assistant general manager Tom Gamble. One external candidate is Adam Peters, the Denver Broncos director of college scouting, according to the NFL Network.\n\n“We’re going to be really aggressive, and the response has been magnificent to the people that really want to be here,” Lynch added.\n\nLeigh Steinberg, Lynch’s initial agent coming out of Stanford in 1993, said Lynch is a “sensational choice” as general manager because of his “off-the-charts, high IQ” and drive to succeed. Steinberg also noted how Lynch’s charisma will help recruit free agents, whose contracts will be structured not by Lynch but the 49ers’ long-time salary-cap ace, Paraag Marathe.\n\nSteinberg said of Lynch: “He’s the person agents will like and want to bring free agents to. He’ll open up a lot of doors. With him, you’ll see there would be a limited amount of strife. In other words, John’s not going to go to newspaper and make a hostile comment about someone he’s working with.”\n\nIn Baalke’s seventh and final year as personnel czar, the 49ers attracted only one starter in free agency last spring, offensive lineman Zane Beadles.\n\nESPN analyst Mark Dominik, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers general manager, gave no indication Monday on “NFL Insiders” that he might join the 49ers front office in some capacity to assist Lynch, who played for the Buccaneers while Dominik was their pro personnel director. Dominik, however, shared insights into the bond Lynch must develop with Kyle Shanahan.\n\n“The main thing you have to note is when you’re in the position of general manager, you are at the office for a long time, and a lot of that time is spent with the head coach in private meetings, so that relationship has to be healthy,” Dominik said.\n\nMcDonough, the Cardinals’ vice president of player personnel, said he was surprised to learn of the 49ers’ move Sunday night but that Lynch and Shanahan sharing a similar passion for success.\n\n“If you’re going to lose a competition to someone, you’d want to lose it to someone like John Lynch,” McDonough told CSN Bay Area. “He’s a phenomenal human being. He’s highly, highly intelligent and 100-percent class. Just knowing John Lynch like I have from afar, he will give all his effort, 100-percent of his effort, into turning the Niners around.”\n\nAdded Steinberg: “I am sure John has strong concepts about how to build that system. It stretches to what offense and defense to run, what players are ideally suited for that, how to spot talent, how to coach talent, how to hire coaches, how to meld it into a working unit and how to have stability.”\n\nStability is something the 49ers desperately need — along with a Lombardi Trophy they last won in the 1994 season. Shanahan will become their fourth coach in four years.\n\n“I’m fully aware that myself, the team I put around me, we’re going to have to earn the respect,” Lynch said. “And the only way you do that is through your actions, and for us that’s showing it on the field. We’ve got a big task in front of us, but I can’t tell you how excited I am to attack it.”"
