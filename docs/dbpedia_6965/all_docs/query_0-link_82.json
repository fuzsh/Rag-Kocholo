        "text": "Blue Lights is the BBC show that everyone is talking about right now. The Irish police procedural drama follows three rookie officers hoping to pass their three-month probation period, showing issues of drug use and gang violence in Belfast. So who is starring in the hit show? The show is full of stars – so where have you seen them all before? Meet them here…\n\nSian Brooke - Grace\n\nSian plays Grace, the 41-year-old rookie who switches careers from social work to join the police. The actress is best known for shows including Sherlock, Doctor Foster, Good Omens, Trying and Stephen. Fans of House of the Dragon might also recognise the star from the new hit show, where she played King Viserys' first wife and Rhaeneyra's mother, Queen Aemma. Find out more here!\n\nKatherine Devlin – Annie\n\nKatherine plays the stoic and determined Annie, who is determined to become a police officer despite increasing threats in her professional and personal life. The role is perhaps best known for playing Natasha in Vikings, and starred as Siobhan in The Dig back in 2018.\n\nJohn Lynch - James McIntyre\n\nCrime boss James is a quiet but terrifying presence in Blue Lights – and the actor has a seriously impressive resume. The star previously played Lord Archibald Craven back in The Secret Garden in 1993, but more recently fans might recognise him as playing ACC Jim Burns in The Fall. He is also known for starring in The Terror, The Head and Medici.\n\nMORE: Grace star Craig Parkinson has a very famous ex-wife - and she starred in Happy Valley and Unforgotten!\n\nMORE: Unforgotten: ITV reveals future of drama following dramatic series five finale\n\nMartin McCann – Stevie Neil\n\nMartin plays Stevie, Grace's mysterious partner who is teaching her the ropes and has a penchant for baking. While not much is known about his character, Martin has also starred in Ripper Street, Vera, The Frankenstein Chronicles and Marcella.\n\nValene Kane – Angela Mackle\n\nValene has starred in Rogue One: A Stars Wars Movie as Lyra Erso, but is perhaps best known for playing Rose Stagg, the one surviving victim of Paul Spector in the hit drama The Fall. In Blue Lights, Valene plays a worried mother whose son is embroiled into a crime gang.\n\nDesmond Eastwood - DS Murray Canning\n\nRecognise the Detective Sergeant? Desmond is perhaps best known for playing Connell's supportive college roommate Niall, which earned him a Best Supportive Actor nomination at the Irish Film and Television Awards. He has also starred in Derry Girls and Vikings.\n\nNathan Braniff - Tommy Foster\n\nThis is Nathan's first television role, having previously starred in stage productions including The Seagull, Disco Pigs and Long Days Journey into Night. The actor plays Tommy, the third of the rookie police officers, teamed up with the reasoned officer Gerry.\n\nRichard Dormer – Gerry Cliff\n\nRichard has previously starred as Beric Dondarrion in Game of Thrones as well as Dan Anderssen in Fortitude. In the show he plays the seasoned but kindly officer Gerry, who teaches Tommy the ropes on his new job. He is happily married to PS Sandra Cliff.\n\nAndi Osho - Sandra Cliff\n\nAndi plays Gerry's wife and PS Sandra, who cheerfully checks arrested citizens into the holding cells while having plenty of flirty banter with her husband.
