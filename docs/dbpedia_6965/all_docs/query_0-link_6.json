        "text": "Although I was quite the tomboy growing up, I did have a soft spot for films like The Little Princess (1995), Little Women (1994), The Railway Children (1970), and The Secret Garden. Upon first glance, these films hardly seem action packed, with strong female characters at their core.\n\nHowever, the likes of Sara from The Little Princess, Bobbie from The Railway Children, and Mary from The Secret Garden, are all fiercely independent creatures who aren’t afraid to rebel in a heavily restricted world. These young girls were my inspirations growing up, as they were willing to speak their mind, to be adventurous and be the heroes of their own stories.\n\n“Not only is The Secret Garden a powerful fable, it is also an entertaining film that is perfect for a rainy afternoon.”\n\nThe Secret Garden was the first of these four films that I saw, and it was a film that shaped who I am today. It was a film that helped me see that kindness and patience were virtues, that being selfish would leave you isolated from the world. I had a copy of the film on VHS which I treasured. I would often play in my overgrown back garden, hoping that I would somehow stumble onto my own secret garden.\n\nThe film follows Mary (Kate Maberly), a young British girl born and reared in India, who loses her neglectful parents in an earthquake. She is sent back to England to live with her lord Archibald Craven (John Lynch). Mary quickly discovers that her uncle is a distant man due to the loss of his wife ten years before. Mary is regarded as a nuisance by her uncle and the staff, especially Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith).\n\nNeglected once again, she begins exploring the estate and discovers a garden that has been locked and neglected. Aided by one of the servants’ boys, Dickon (Andrew Knott), she begins restoring the garden. She eventually discovers some other secrets of the manor which includes the discovery of her long-lost cousin, Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse).\n\n“With The Secret Garden, Holland weaves a beautiful tale of discovery, not only the discovery of the garden, but the discovery of Mary’s own identity.”\n\nThe Secret Garden was director Agnieszka Holland’s first American film, backed by Francis Ford Coppola. Her earlier work includes Europa, Europa, a story of a Jewish boy who is able to save his life by passing for a Nazi youth brigade member. As well as Olivier, Olivier a filmabout a long-lost son who may or may not have been found again. Holland seems drawn to stories about young children trying to exist in worlds that exclude them or neglect them.\n\nWith The Secret Garden, Holland weaves a beautiful tale of discovery, not only the discovery of the garden, but the discovery of Mary’s own identity. The character of Mary goes from being a spoiled, bad tempered little girl to a considerate, empathetic individual who sees the value of selflessness. Holland never allows the film’s message to become too preachy, and although this is a film aimed at children there is much that adult viewers can take away from it. Not only is this a powerful fable, it is also an entertaining film that is perfect for a rainy afternoon.\n\nMaberly’s performance as Mary helps to make this unlikeable character sympathetic and complex. Mary is a girl who doesn’t know any better. Her parents should have been role models however they neglected her. Maggie Smith is a delight like she always is. And the two young boys (Knott and Prowse) also give strong performances. The touching ending where Lynch’s Craven tells Mary that she is wanted, will leave a tear in your eye.\n\nThe biggest challenge for production designer, Stuart Craig, was the garden. The garden was built from scratch to avoid the logistical nightmare of crowd control that would have been required for a complicated summer/winter shoot in an existing garden. The costumes by Marit Allen are the stuff of dreams, with Mary’s outfits being elegant and far more practical than anything worn by a Disney Princess.\n\n“The Secret Garden remains a heart-warming film… Everyone deserves their own little secret garden, their sanctuary away from the chaos of adult life. It is the one special place where miracles grow.”\n\nRoger Deakins’ photography captures the beauty and the awe of the house and the garden, making for a truly immersive viewing experience. Coupled with Zbigniew Preisner’s subtle and imaginative score, there are scenes which pull on your very heart strings. It is also worth mentioning the well crafted screenplay by Caroline Thompson, who also wrote many screenplays for Tim Burton — Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Corpse Bride.\n\nThe Secret Garden remains a heart-warming film. Although the film may be too slow paced for some, it still holds up very well all these years later. Everyone deserves their own little secret garden, their sanctuary away from the chaos of adult life. It is the one special place where miracles grow."
