        "text": "I liked this movie because it was scary at some bits but i didn't mind. I also liked this movie because it wasn't animated . I think the moral of this movie is that life can grow anywhere in the world including unexpected places like deserted castles. I also think the moral of this movie is that you should never give up be resilient and don't let bad words. I also liked the sound and music because the music had a lot of upbeat music and it made me feel confident.\n\nPrint this review"
