        "text": "John Lynch is a former agent of International Operations\n\nHistory\n\nJohn Lynch was once the powerless head of the black ops \"Project Thunderbook\", which experimented on humans in an attempt to give them superhuman powers through alien DNA. While the project was successful in the short term, the Thunderbook subjects split up, spreading to the corners of the country and taking up new lives, with the aid of Lynch's skills in subterfuge. Years later, Lynch was alerted by International Operations looking into Project Thunderbook once more, leading to him tracking down his former friends and allies and warning of them of the potential danger. Upon discovering most of them had children, Lynch's goal changed, now wanting to help and protect the young children who may have inherited their parents' dangerous powers.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAbilities\n\nFirearms\n\nTactical Analysis\n\nLeadership\n\nRelated"
