        "text": "Movie adaptations of classic literature can often be a little worrisome, especially when the book has been adapted before. However, Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women” proved that breathing new life into a classic story can be a good thing. It looks like “The Secret Garden” is about to get the same treatment.\n\nREAD MORE: The 100 Best Films Of The Decade [2010s]\n\nThe movie is based on the 1911 novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett and is considered to be a staple in classic children’s literature. A handful of film adaptations of “The Secret Garden” followed, with the most notable one being 1993’s Agnieszka Holland-directed movie. The film starred Kate Maberly (“Finding Neverland”), John Lynch (“The Fall”) and Maggie Smith. “The Secret Garden” was executive produced by Francis Ford Coppola, and was generally well-received by fans and critics alike.\n\nREAD MORE: The 100 Most Anticipated Films Of 2020\n\nThat might make some question the necessity of a remake, but the upcoming “The Secret Garden” seems to be in good hands. The film seems to follow the original source material closely — a young orphan is sent to live with her uncle and discovers a beautiful hidden garden on his quiet English estate. Colin Firth and Julie Waters join the cast this time around. “The Secret Garden” is led by relative newcomer Dixie Egerickx (“Patrick Melrose”). David Heyman, who is likely best known for the “Harry Potter” franchise, is among “The Secret Garden’s” producers.\n\nREAD MORE: 52 Films Directed By Women To Watch In 2020\n\nTake a look at the official synopsis for “The Secret Garden” below:\n\nWhen Mary Lennox’s parents suddenly die, she is sent to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, on his remote country estate deep in the Yorkshire moors. While exploring, she discovers a hidden magical garden.\n\n“The Secret Garden” drops in theaters on April 17. Take a look at the new trailer below. Let’s hope the film lives up to the standard set by the various adaptations released over the last 100+ years."
