        "text": "Movie-makers have been accused of using special effects to turn a genteel English literary classic filmed in Gloucestershire into something akin to the fantasy films Avatar or Alice in Wonderland.\n\nFans of The Secret Garden are divided after a trailer was released for the latest film based on the children's book starring Colin Firth and Julie Walters.\n\nSome fans of the 1993 film said the special effects have gone too far but others said they were looking forward to the 21st Century update of their favourite childhood film.\n\nAnd film-makers say the CGI was only used occasionally to subtly enhance the natural stunning locations or create a sense of magical realism.\n\nIn the trailer for the film the central character Mary Lennox can be seen tumbling down a hill after climbing into the locked secret garden which she later restores.\n\nThat scene is clearly filmed in Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean, a lush green traditional, ancient woodland landscape with gnarled trees, spectacular moss-covered scowles and Autumn leaves, that has been used as the backdrop for movies including Star Wars.\n\nBut the trailer also shows Mary, played by BFG star Dixie Egerickx, running through exotic, giant rhubarb plants and what appears to be a colourful, fantasy garden knitted together from other locations.\n\n“What fresh hell is this? An English garden meets Avatar?”, wrote one critic comparing the David Heyman-produced adaptation to James Cameron's epic science fiction film.\n\n“It's like she opened a door to Amazon rainforest not your regular backyard English garden,” said a fan of the original book by Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n\nOther comments included: “This is what happens when Harry Potter remakes a classic” and “Why do we need CGI? It's not a magic garden it’s a Secret garden” .\n\nA headline from the website Screenrant said the team behind the Harry Potter and Paddington films that made the Secret Garden had gone “full Jumanji” with the trailer.\n\nBut they did not criticise the film-makers for using technology to add a touch of fantasy to the fourth big-screen retelling of the literary favourite.\n\nAnd other fans defended the re-imagining of the 1911 book with one saying: “Seeing it now with all the special effects makes it seem even more beautiful\".\n\nAnother urged people to watch with an open mind and added: “I actually like the idea of it being magical and strange and new. It's more like how the garden could've looked or seemed like to someone as a child.\"\n\nAnother tells fans complaining the 1993 film was timeless: \"It's obviously going to be different than the original or they wouldn't remake it.\n\n\" I think it looks amazing and I can't wait to get lost in the garden.\n\n\"Any movie that brings to life worlds I can only dream of in my head I will always support and thank them for bringing it to life\".\n\nOthers pointed out that critics mourning the 1993 film should remember that that was also a remake which attracted criticism from fans of the 1940s black and white version which was touched up with Technicolour.\n\n“What a disappointment! What a modernised mess,\" wrote one reviewer of the 1993 film who said it failed to capture the English garden in the book.\n\nIn the latest film which will be released in April 2020. Colin Firth plays widower uncle, Archibold Craven, Julie Walters the housekeeper, Amir Wilson, Dickon and Edon Hayhurst as Colin.\n\nWriter Jack Thorne has moved the period setting from the Edwardian era in the book to 1947, on the eve of Partition in India, and in the aftermath of WW2.\n\nIt was filmed at six locations including Puzzlewood, the Bodnant Gardens in North Wales and the 450-acre Duncombe Park estate in Yorkshire which was used for the fictional Misselthwaite Manor.\n\nA spokesman for the film-makers Studio Canal said: “Our adaptation of The Secret Garden strives to capture the sense in which nature can appear to echo and respond to the children’s moods, emotions and imagination.\n\n\"We chose stunning gardens all around the UK for their natural beauty, ranging from the long vivid laburnum arch at Bodnant to the vibrant mossy canyons of Puzzlewood and the rich subtropical vegetation of Trebah.\n\n\"CGI was used delicately and sparingly to subtly enhance the vivid experience of the many stunning locations chosen, knitting together different places to create a boundless, heightened world.\n\n\"Visual effects have been occasionally employed to create a sense of magical realism borne out of a child’s imaginative vision of the world.\n\n\"But often, locations needed little or no enhancement other than sunshine, which we were fortunate to have had in abundance during our shoot.”\n\nWhen news of the remake was made public, Marc Munden, the triple BAFTA-winning film director best known for his work on Utopia, National Treasure and The Mark of Cain said: “This is a fantastical reimagining of ‘The Secret Garden’: I can’t wait to explore it.\"\n\n“It’s an opportunity to immerse ourselves in an uncanny and wondrous world, which will play to the imaginations of adults and children alike.”\n\nProducer David Heyman said: “I’m excited that our director, Marc Munden, will be bringing his distinct imaginative vision to this enduring childhood story.\""
