The castle is crumbling and Arthurâs men cannot hold out much longer but only a Dragonlord can kill a dragon and Uther wiped them all out years ago. Or did he? Gaius admits one such man could still be alive and in hiding.The last Dragonlord is the key to Merlinâs own past as well as the future of Camelot, but will Arthur and Merlin find Balinor (John Lynch) in time to save the kingdom?"
