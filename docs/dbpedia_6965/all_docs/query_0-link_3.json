His parents met in London, where his mother was a teacher.[4] He is the eldest of five children,[2][3] and was raised as a Catholic.[1]\n\nIn 1968, when he was seven years old, he moved with his family to the townland of Corrinshego, where his father was from, in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. Corrinshego, where he spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years, is on the western outskirts of Newry.[1][5][4] Lynch later attended St. Colman's College in Newry. He began acting in Irish language plays at school during the early years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. His sister Susan Lynch and his nephew Thomas Finnegan are also actors.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLynch has appeared in numerous films related to Northern Ireland's problems such as Cal (1984) with Helen Mirren,[5] for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles,[6] The Railway Station Man (1992) with Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, In the Name of the Father (1993) with Daniel Day-Lewis, Nothing Personal (1995) and Some Mother's Son (1996), also with Mirren, as well as the Irish-themed film Evelyn (2002).[7] In Some Mother's Son he played the role of Irish Republican hunger strike leader Bobby Sands.\n\nHe was a supporting actor in Derek Jarman's Edward II (1991), as Lord Craven in Agnieska Holland's film The Secret Garden (1993), as Tadhg in The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), and as Gerry in Sliding Doors (1998).[7]\n\nLynch played the lead in the Australian feature Angel Baby,[7] winning the Australian Film Institute award for best leading actor and the Australian Film Critics award for best actor of 1995.[8] He was nominated for a Satellite Film Award for the film Moll Flanders in 1996.[7] He worked with acclaimed Belgian director Marion Hänsel on her adaptation of Booker Prize-nominated author Damon Galgut's novel, The Quarry (also known as La Faille; 1998),[5] which won Best Film at the Montreal World Film Festival. Lynch played the part of football legend George Best in the 2000 film Best.[7] He won Best Actor for his role in Best at the Fort Lauderdale Film Festival in 2000.[7] He wrote and co-produced the film.[5]\n\nIn 2005, Lynch was nominated for an IFTA for his role in The Baby War.[9] He starred in Five Day Shelter as Stephen, which won a European Film Award and was in competition at the Rome Film Festival.
