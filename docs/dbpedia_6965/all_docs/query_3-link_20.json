        "text": "The importance of storytelling is a key theme that binds all those that have worked on Horizon over the past 50 years, but how those stories are told has changed over the decades. When John Lynch joined Horizon in the 1970s, simply revealing how something 'worked', without necessarily telling any ‘story’ as such, provided sufficient interest for audiences.\n\nEstablishing a relationship with the scientific community has always been important to the various Horizon teams over the years. Trust in what the BBC does generally has opened many doors to researchers, and areas of scientific controversy have become accessible, sometimes during the production of a Horizon programme.\n\nJohn Lynch explained the highly diplomatic role of the Horizon producer; skills still much in evidence amongst programme makers today.\n\nInterviews\n\nPeter Goodchild\n\nAfter having trained in studio direction Peter Goodchild (the longest surviving editor of the programme) was asked by Aubrey Singer, then Head of BBC Science and Features, to make a choice. Did he want to be an educationalist or an entertainer for the rest of his BBC career?\n\nAlec Nisbett\n\nAlec Nisbett, has been described by fellow programme makers as âthe quintessential Horizon producerâ, never shying away from putting hard science on TV.\n\nDeborah Cadbury\n\nThe first programme Deborah worked on for the BBC was on a series which was something of a training ground for many a Horizon producer, Tomorrow's World (BBC: 1965-2003). She won many awards for her work on Horizon including Emmys and BAFTAS.\n\nSimon Campbell-Jones\n\nSimonâs first film for Horizon was broadcast in January 1969, and was called The Miraculous Wonder: the Human Eye. Narrated by Christopher Chataway, the programme asked if human eyes âwere windows to your soul, the receiver of irrelevant information, respectable substitutes for sex, something like footballs? Or a piece of the brain looking out at the world?â\n\nPeter Jones\n\nPeter Jones had been watching Horizon from the very early days, soon after the studio based magazine format was phased out, and just knew he had to be part of the programme.\n\nSarah Carr\n\nWith a large team of directors, producers, production assistants, and researchers, keeping Horizon on schedule and within budget was no mean feat. Unit Manager Sarah Carr had the mammoth task of keeping the Horizon ship afloat, which she did with wit, charm and firmness!\n\nDavid Dugan\n\nDavid Dugan joined Horizon in 1976 as a researcher, having only contributed science articles to the national press before. He heard about his appointment to the programme by what today would be considered antiquated means â telegram!\n\nAndrew Cohen\n\nArguably the rise through the world of TV science, of the hugely popular and highly successful physicist and communicator Professor Brian Cox, was down to Andrew Cohen.\n\nMaggie Bebbington\n\nBy 1992 Director General Michael Checkland had seen through the introduction of the inital phase of the BBCâs internal market called Producer Choice. For a Unit Manager like Maggie Bebbington there were a few surprises in store.\n\nEdward Goldwyn\n\nEd Goldwyn joined the BBC in 1962 first as a researcher, then producer in schools, education, and Open University programmes. He was anxious to move to Horizon which had impressed him since it first began in 1964.\n\nTessa Livingstone\n\nHorizon is known for its specialist and engaging science films, but occasionally the production team finds itself in a breaking news situation when on location.\n\nMartin Freeth\n\nThe pressures of the multi-channel world were not a concern for earlier Horizon film makers. Although Martin Freeth experienced some of the changes brought about by digital TV, his Horizon career (1971â1997) rarely encountered pressure to deliver anything other than âa good programmeâ.\n\nChris La Fontaine\n\nSuch was the power of television in the 1970s (there were only three TV channels in the UK until 1982), that sometimes it was enough to simply look behind the scenes of an institution and see what went on there.\n\nGraham Massey\n\nHorizon soon started to make itself known as a vehicle for breaking science stories and questioning accepted wisdoms. Graham Massey was Head of BBC Science between 1989-91, and was a Horizon film maker between 1974 and 1985.\n\nJohn Lynch\n\nWhen John Lynch joined Horizon in the 1970s, simply revealing how something âworkedâ, without necessarily telling any âstoryâ as such, provided sufficient interest for audiences.\n\nChristopher Sykes\n\nIn 1980 Christopher Sykes wrote and produced The Slatemakers for Horizon. It was this programme that triggered his own unique approach to science television. For Chris, people were the key to successful science documentaries.\n\nJana Bennett\n\nIt took until 1990 for the BBC to appoint a women to the position of Editor, Horizon. It had not been a straightforward journey for Jana Bennett who took the job, having faced some less than positive views about the role of women in broadcasting."
