        "text": "An actor devoted to social change and political causes, John Lynch has appeared in a number of films that focus on Norther Ireland's \"Troubles.\" Born in the United Kingdom, Lynch was raised in Corrinshego, County Armagh in Ireland which was also his father's hometown. His mother was Italian and Lynch claims that his family was personally affected by the violence and prejudice of the Troubles. In 1984, Lynch co-starred with Helen Mirren in \"Cal,\" about a Catholic member of the IRA sent to kill a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who later falls in the love with the man's widow. In 1993 Lynch was featured in the critically acclaimed drama \"In the Name of the Father,\" starring Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite which chronicled the story of the Guilford Pub bombings in Ireland. Lynch has also been cast in some lighter fare, including 1993's \"The Secret Garden,\" 1994's \"Princess Caraboo,\" and 1998's \"Sliding Doors,\" starring Gwyneth Paltrow. Alongside his work as an actor, Lynch is also a writer and has published two novels, \"Torn Water\" and \"Falling Out of Heaven.\" Lynch is married to director Mary McGuckian, and starred as football legend George Best in her 2000 feature film \"Best.\""
