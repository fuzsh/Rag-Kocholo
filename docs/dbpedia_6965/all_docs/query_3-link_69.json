        "text": "You have seen him as the duck-painting husband of Police Chief Marge Gunderson in Fargo, Drew’s cross-dressing brother on The Drew Carey Show and suspected serial killer Arthur Leigh Allen in Zodiac.\n\nIf only you could remember his name.\n\nThe relative anonymity of John Carroll Lynch might vanish with his latest endeavor: a juicy role as the main villain in American Horror Story: Freak Show on FX. One problem: The part of the murderous Twisty the Clown requires heavy makeup, which makes him almost unrecognizable — even to his co-stars.\n\nLynch recalls sharing lunch with Michael Chiklis, who plays strongman Dell Toledo.\n\n“I was telling a very pedestrian story when Michael interrupted and said, ‘Dude, do you have any idea what you look like right now?’?” Lynch, 51, said by phone.\n\nIt isn’t the first time he has spent considerable time in the costume department. His first break came in 1987 when he was cast as the monster in Frankenstein — Playing With Fire, as part of the touring company of Minneapolis’ Guthrie Theater. A year later, he reprised the role on the Guthrie main stage, where he worked for eight seasons.\n\nLynch started to land movie roles near the end of his time in the Minneapolis area. In addition to Fargo, he nabbed parts in Grumpy Old Men, Beautiful Girls and Feeling Minnesota.\n\nSince 1997, he has appeared in almost 30 TV series and 40 films, including Shutter Island and Gran Torino.\n\nIn Horror Story, he acts alongside Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates and Jessica Lange as members of a struggling circus featuring a bearded lady, a young man with lobster hands and two sisters sharing the same body.\n\nHis clown character was used sparingly in the series’ first two episodes this month, but his few scenes were by far the grimmest.\n\n“This is the most macabre of the psychopaths I’ve played,” Lynch said. “He’s also the most misunderstood.”\n\nDespite the steady work, he isn’t a household name. That isn’t unusual for a character actor, said Lisa Peterson, who directed Lynch in the 2006 premiere of the Beth Henley play Ridiculous Fraud in Princeton, N.J.\n\n“John gets to work all the time and play really interesting parts,” Peterson said. “For my money, I’d rather watch a great character actor than a leading man.”\n\nNot that Lynch is opposed to being front and center.\n\nHe was cast in HBO’s Happy Valley as Jerry Sandusky, the Penn State assistant football coach convicted of child molestation, with Al Pacino set to play coach Joe Paterno and Brian De Palma directing. But the network suspended pre-production work last month, citing budget issues.\n\nA project even closer to Lynch’s heart is Crew, a film he co-wrote about the 1987 University of Minnesota rowing team, which rose from obscurity to become a national contender. But he has struggled to find financial backers."
