        "text": "Telling stories is a human act as old as fire.\n\n“Everyone has a story. Most stories are uniquely interesting in some way. Connecting the story to human themes gives a great original story universal appeal.”\n\nThere’s so much more than meets the senses! 2+2=7. There is much more to excavate in the unspoken universe that a story resides in. The absurd. The unscriptable reality of life. Strange truths. Strategic lies. Incredible settings. Bizarre characters that do the unthinkable. Unfathomable outcomes!\n\nI find it to be a fascinating study of humanity in its most stripped down essence. How can a good story, well told, not get anyone’s blood pumping? A great story reminds you – that you are indeed alive.\n\n“A great story reminds you – that you are indeed… alive.”\n\nI do love settling into silence. Silence is such a necessary part of having an appreciation for sound and especially melodic sound. Harmonious sound.\n\nIf I’m excited or interested in something external – there always seems to be some sort of music or sound that drives my creative expression from within.\n\nSometimes, I have a song in my head when I wake up. Maybe just a few verses, a chorus, or a part of the instrumental. I find it on the internet. I play it. It sets the tone for my day. A soundtrack for what I’m setting out to accomplish. In this: living life mirrors filmmaking.\n\nAn ideal client is someone being truthful to themselves and their vision, yet not married to an exact idea or completed look and feel. They trust themselves as much as the idea itself. They are basically not insecure about who they are as a person or their ideas and their workflow. An Ideal client let me do my job – isn’t micromanaging every move yet is still involved and excited to be executing their idea as much as I am. Sharing the enthusiasm is a beautiful collaboration! I always love a little micro management… To remind me of how great it is to not be micromanaged!\n\nAn enlightened client is the best. They let it evolve and don’t overthink all the phases and steps along the path. They trust the process. They trust. They trust. They trust. They trust the results at the end.\n\nWhat’s the process to have Lynchfilm run a project? Or let’s just ask, what’s the process look like for John Lynch to bring an idea to the screen?\n\nTime! Time is everything! Time is of the essence. If I get involved, if I sign on – I’m all in. 100% commitment. That includes all my years of experience. All the stories I’ve been told. It includes all my relationships I’ve nurtured all over the planet. I bring it all to the table including all the life lessons I’ve suffered through as well. I want to be as smooth as possible and I wish the experience for all involved to be fulfilling and enlightening.\n\nI met David Finnigan in the early 90’s in high school. He was one of those kids that was too honest to be in the ‘cool crowd’. Instead, he did his own thing while earning and giving respect to those around him. He has a huge sense of sarcastic wit and was a joy to be around. I was mostly in my own tiny world back then – but Dave, Dave was in a couple of my classes – so after spending time with him, I could see he was a highly intelligent being.\n\nDavid has a thirst for the absurd humor in life and needs that on a daily basis. So, we had fun. I graduated and went off on my journey, and he graduated and went off on his own path.\n\nAbout 16 years went by – we hadn’t seen or spoken since high school. Then a friend of a friend mentioned he was in California and classic teenage memories rushed back to me. I was hoping we would eventually cross paths again. We did! We went surfing. The waves were great and it was like we were kids again. We both shared stories from our lives and vowed to work together someday. Yet, again, several years went by. This time, we kept in touch. We met up on a few surf trips.\n\nFinally, it was time. The pandemic happened. Everyone was in a strange space. Luckily for me, I was commissioned to do a bigger size thing and asked if he’d come on board to write and produce… and he did!\n\nOnce that job wrapped, we both felt like we had just scratched the surface to what our potential was. We asked each other, “Shall we keep this going?”\n\nParty Wave incorporated the expertise of both David and myself in one package. We thrive on creative collaboration.\n\nDave is a naturally gifted storyteller in his own right – with an ear for great dialogue. He’s also not a half bad surfer. What more can you want? Who better to work with? A guy that can collaborate creatively, has your back on set and can hold his own in the ocean. I do my job, he does his. It’s fun and the results are pretty damn impressive!\n\nStarting around the age of 14, I would imagine how good the waves could be. It was tradition to get up at sunrise and check the waves. It was often a let down, yet, always clinging to the hope it would be great – and mostly it wasn’t – but sometimes – it would be better than we ever could have imagined. Superseding daily expectations. This became the metaphor for my life. These are the special days a surfer lives for. I remember particular sessions from my teen years that I will never forget. Those classic days when nature and the elements collide into our idea of perfection. I don’t know yet, however I have the feeling that these are the big checks we cash in the memory banks of life. Worth more than any paper note or instrument that ‘represents’ value. These times are the value. It’s why we are here.\n\n“You find the soul of life itself in life’s unexpected miracles.”\n\nWe find the soul of life in all these spectacular unexpected moments we live for. We need them as human beings! It’s truly universal. We all relate to that particular feeling – we’re in the zone. The elements are aligned: Wind. Tide. The Bottom. Swell. Swell angle. Weather. How we feel. Choices of what we have to ride. When it all comes together we enjoy peak performance at what we are doing – with all the other factors lining up and working with us.\n\nThat is the miracle of life reflecting/ whispering back to us. You were created to participate in this! You live your best self and these particular moments bring out the best in everything – and everyone around you."
