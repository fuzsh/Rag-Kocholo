        "text": "John Lynch liked what he saw of Chase Young on film this season and he liked the defensive end’s snap counts.\n\n“I kept turning on the tape and (seeing) 75, 64 — those are a lot of snaps,” the San Francisco 49ers general manager said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. “I think the proof is what’s translating on the field. He’s been playing a lot and looking really good. … It sure looks like he’s been healthy based upon what he’s been doing on the field.”\n\nHealth was Young’s biggest red flag heading into the 2023 season. He previously tore his right ACL and ruptured the patellar tendon in the same knee, a rare combination that required surgeons to graft part of Young’s left patellar tendon to repair the issue on the other side. The injury, which occurred in Week 10 of the 2021 season, not only caused Young to miss the remainder of that season but he sat out the first 14 games of 2022 as well.\n\nLynch said the Washington Commanders shared medical files on Young as part of the trade and Young arrived in the Bay Area on Wednesday for a full physical. Young passed the physical, and at 5 p.m. Wednesday, the 49ers announced the trade was official.\n\nLynch said his relationship with Commanders general manager Martin Mayhew, a former teammate of his in Tampa Bay and one of his top lieutenants in San Francisco when Lynch was hired as GM in 2017, was essential to the deal.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nFor John Lynch, the 49ers' job isn't finished, and so neither is he\n\nHe said he and Mayhew began discussing Young two weeks ago. Lynch said he had conversations with several general managers. During a conversation on KNBR radio later Wednesday, he said he checked in with New York Giants general manager Joe Schoen, one of the sellers before Tuesday’s trade deadline. A league source said a call also was placed to the Minnesota Vikings about guard Ezra Cleveland, who was ultimately shipped to the Jacksonville Jaguars. ESPN reported that the 49ers and Buffalo Bills were among the teams interested in Chicago Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson, who ended up staying put in Chicago. Lynch said that at one point Mayhew told him another Commanders pass rusher, Montez Sweat, also might be available. Mayhew ultimately sent Sweat to the Bears for a second-round pick.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations at a lot of different positions,” Lynch said on KNBR. “All I can say is this is the deal that made the most sense.”\n\nLynch confirmed that the 49ers were sending to Washington the 2024 third-round compensatory pick they received when DeMeco Ryans and Ran Carthon were hired to top-level jobs in the offseason. The 49ers still have their own pick in that round and are expecting another compensatory pick for losing tackle Mike McGlinchey in free agency. They’re in line to have 11 picks in 2024.\n\nLynch on Wednesday toed the line between enthusiasm for what Young, 24 years old and a Defensive Rookie of the Year, will bring to the defense and showing faith in the players already on the unit. The 49ers have sunk far more resources — in terms of draft picks and dollars — into the defensive line than any other unit, yet that group has struggled to rush the passer, stop the run and defend screen passes, especially during San Francisco’s three-game losing streak.\n\nLynch echoed coach Kyle Shanahan in saying the team needed to better coordinate its pass rush and coverage.\n\n“I thought the Dallas game, it all came together,” he said. “And I was hopeful that, man, OK, we’re onto something and we’re going to get back to our ways because I think, in my mind, we’re really good up there and now we’re hopefully even better if this thing comes to fruition with Chase.”\n\nHe also defended edge rusher Nick Bosa, who held out during training camp to become the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL but who only has three sacks in eight games. Young has five sacks in seven games.\n\n“Nick Bosa’s dominating,” Lynch said on KNBR. “If you know football, turn on that film. The attention this guy gets, what he does to the guy in front of him. … Believe me, Nick Bosa’s the least of our worries.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nIn Chase Young, 49ers find a Nick Bosa bookend that's been missing since 2019\n\nBecause of past October trades that resulted in Jimmy Garoppolo, Emmanuel Sanders and Christian McCaffrey, Lynch said there was an expectation — around the league and in the 49ers building — that they would pull off another on the eve of the deadline this year. When he went to bed Monday, however, he felt like it wasn’t going to happen, something Shanahan voiced during a Monday call with reporters.\n\n“It doesn’t sound like there’s a lot of options out there,” he said.\n\nBut Lynch said Mayhew stayed in touch throughout Tuesday morning even after Sweat was dealt to Chicago and that the deal started coming together two hours or so before the trade deadline.\n\nHe said there was a lift inside 49ers headquarters when it was finalized and that one player was particularly excited. Bosa and Young played together at Ohio State and they’ve remained close since. There’s no doubt Bosa is looking forward to fewer double-teams and chip blocks when Young is lined up opposite him.\n\n“I know that Nick Bosa thinks very highly of him,” Lynch said. “That means a lot to us. Because Nick’s words are never hollow. … I didn’t call Nick until afterward. But I can tell you that Nick is very excited for the opportunity to play with Chase.”\n\n(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)"
