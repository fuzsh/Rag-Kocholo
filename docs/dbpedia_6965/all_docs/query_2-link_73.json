        "text": "Tin Star season two: A look at Jim's path\n\nTin Star season two, which is currently airing on Sky Atlantic and streaming on NOW TV, sees Anna Worth (played by Abigail Lawrie) hide from her family in the house of Pastor Johan Nickel (John Lynch). Pastor Johan is an ammonite preacher with a few deadly secrets. John Lynch, the actor who plays Pastor Johan, is best known for his role as Jim Burns in BBC’s The Fall. Tin Star viewers on Sky, however, may also know him for The Secret Garden, Sliding Doors and In the Name of the Father.\n\nWho plays Pastor Johan in Tin Star?\n\nPastor Johan Nickel is played by Irish actor John Lynch.\n\nLynch, 57, got his start in Irish language plays at school during the early days of the Troubles.\n\nHe has appeared so far in his acting work a number of times on film, most famously alongside Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson in the Oscar-winning In the Name of the Father, the story of the Guildford Four.\n\nOther films Lynch has made about Northern Irish history include 1984’s Cal, 1992’s The Railway Station Man and 1996’s Some Mother’s Son.\n\nIn fact, Cal was his big-screen debut, in which he played a man linked to the IRA who falls in love with a woman (Helen Mirren) whose husband was killed by the group.\n\nTIN STAR SEASON 2 RELEASE DATE, CAST, TRAILER, PLOT\n\nThe film also netted him his only BAFTA nomination for most outstanding newcomer to film.\n\nHis first TV role came in documentary series Ten Great Writers of the Modern World in 1988, in which he played Stephen Dedalus, James Joyce’s character from Ulysses and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\n\nThe early 1990s were a busy time for the actor, in which he appeared in sci-fi films (Hardware, 1990), TV comedies (All Good Things, 1990 and Making Out, 1990 to 1991) and Derek Jarman’s adaptation of Christopher Marlowe play Edward II in 1991.\n\nLynch will be familiar to a generation of kids for his role as Lord Archibald Craven in classic literary adaptation The Secret Garden.\n\nIn that same year, he was fourth-billed in In the Name of the Father, which was nominated for seven Oscars.\n\nHOW MANY EPISODES ARE IN TIN STAR?\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
