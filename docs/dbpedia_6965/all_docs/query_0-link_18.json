        "text": "On Wednesday which was the 15th of February 2023 where I watched the original film that was made back in 1993 the film is called The Secret Garden which is all about Young Mary Lennox who is played by Kate Maberly who becomes a orphan after a earthquake hit in India. So now she is sent to England to live with her uncle, Lord Archibald Craven who is played by John Lynch who lives in a cold ancestral manor in Yorkshire. When Mary gets there she briefly meets him, but he still mourns for his wife who died ten years ago, so she is mostly left on her own. who becomes a resourceful and inquisitive girl, and soon she makes two exciting discoveries. First she finds an overgrown secret garden, where she finds out that is was her aunt's garden but when she died her uncle wanted it locked up forever because it reminded him of her. Secondly she finds out that her aunt had a child who was the same age as her and that they were cousins his name is Colin Craven who is played by Heydon Prowse but his is a sickly boy who has been told he must remain in bed out of the daylight at all times. But once Mary and her new friend, called Dickon who is played by Andrew Knott who have brought the garden back to life they decide that Colin should come and see his mother's garden which could change several lives. This film has got five stars which means I loved it because I love the book which I have read a few times again and again I also prefer this version to the new one but the new one was not bad but it did not follow the book as must as the original did but that is my own option on the new film. I also like the film which is called A Little Princess I have all ready wrote a review for it. So as I have said this version of The Secret Garden is my favourite book and film that is why it has been given five stars.\n\nPrint this review"
