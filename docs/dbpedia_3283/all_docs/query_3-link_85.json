Saka Güvenç\n\nTraining and Research Hospital Genetic Diognosis Center, Izmir, Turkey\n\nIntroduction: 8p inverted duplication deletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly characterized by mild to severe intellectual deficit, severe developmental delay, hypotonia, agenesis of the corpus callosum and minor facial anomalies such as prominent forehead, temporal baldness, anteverted nostrils and eversion of the lower lip. Materials and Method: A prenatal case was investigated due to high risk for Down syndrome in first trimester biochemichal screening and advanced maternal age (36) by amniocentesis and fetal ultrasonography (USG). Results: Amniocentesis was performed at 16th weeks of gestation. The result of the QF-PCR analysis for rapid aneuploidy screening was normal, but add (8p) was determined by conventional karyotyping. The parental karyotypes had no chromosomal anomaly. In the subtelomeric FISH study of the fetal sample, there was a subtelomeric deletion in the 8p region. There was no fetal structural anomaly in level II fetal USG and fetal echocardiography. The molecular karyotyping revealed a gain in 8p11.22-p23.1 region with a size of 27.2 Mb containing 122 OMIM gene and a loss in 8p23.1-p23.3 region with a size of 6.8 Mb containing 15 OMIM gene. The findings were correlated with 8p inverted duplication deletion syndrome. Conclusion: Our study emphasizes the importance of using additional molecular cytogenetic methods in clinical follow-up of complex rearrangements in the prenatal cases. In unstable chromosomal rearrangements, fetal USG scans are not sufficient to detect fetal anomalies. However, molecular karyotyping is gaining importance in order to evaluate unbalanced chromosomal anomalies, to predict fetal prognosis and to give appropriate genetic counseling.\n\nÖ.

The gene is located each of the sex chromosomes. AmelX is present on the Xp22.1-p22.3 and AmelY is present on the Yp11.2, differ by a 6 bp deletion in the third intron of AmelX is not in AmelY. It is lead to be useful for gender identification detecting of amelogenin homologus. It’s fact that Y chromosome abnormalities are primarily considired for male infertility or subfertility. Meterials and Methods: Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (qf pcr) combination with conventional cytogenetic analysis has been used routinely in prenatal diagnosis. The technique, is based on the length variotions of short tandem repeat (str) in chromosomes. Also, AmelX and AmelY sequences are these markers. In the case, fourteen weeks choryonic villus samples (cvs) with indications of omphalocele and anancefalia were refered to our clinic for prenatal diagnosis. When detecting the lock of AmelY locus in cvs we analyzed the parents immediately for amel fragments. Results: AmelX of the mother was normal level whether fetüs and father have not any size of AmelY loci but had SRY sex-determining region Y marker. Conclusion: A few cases have been reported interstitial deletion of AmelY loci have oligozoospemic clinique associated with male infertility but we had described lack of AmelY locus both fetus and the father. Interesting feature of the case that father had not dysmorphic features also is a fertile man. Genetic counseling was given to the family.\n\nM.N. Somuncu: None. A.G. Zamani: None. E. Goktas: None.

It is based on the investigation of polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs) and is preferred widely for prenatal rapid aneuploidy detection. In this study, we reported retrospectively our prenatal diagnosis results between January 2012 and May 2014 in Tepecik Training and Research Hospital Genetic Diagnostic Center. Prenatal diagnosis was offered to 6800 high risk pregnancies and 2883 cases accepted invasive diagnosis. Chromosome analysis and QFPCR was performed for all patients. Normal results were reported in 2711 cases by fetal karyotyping and in 2706 cases by QFPCR. Anomaly detection rates were similar for two methods (5,09% for karyotyping and 4,02% for QFPCR). QFPCR as a fast and reliable prenatal diagnosis method in all indication groups and may be preferred as the sole prenatal investigation in patients without fetal ultrasonographic findings.\n\nO.

Amniotic fluid supernatant however, is usually discarded and not deemed good source of fetal DNA.The aim of this study was to assess cell-free fetal DNA extracted from amniotic fluid supernatant for application in prenatal diagnosis such as gender determination and early diagnosis of β-thalassemia. Samples of amniotic fluid from 70 pregnant women were collected and put through routine tests along with tests for cell-free fetal DNA from the amniotic fluid supernatant.The DNA in the amniotic fluid supernatant was extracted and analyzed for gender determination by PCR and Real-time PCR.ARMS-PCR was applied to test for the early diagnosis of IVS II-I mutation (common β-thalassemia mutation) and E7V mutation for sickle cell anemia using DNA extracted from the amniotic fluid supernatant. Using the cell-free fetal DNA extracted from the amniotic fluid supernatant, the sensitivity of PCR and Real-time PCR for gender detection was compared with the routine cytogenetic method.The fetus tested for sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia was observed to be healthy but heterozygous for IVS II-I mutation. The findings indicated that cell-free fetal DNA from amniotic fluid supernatant can be a good source of fetal DNA and be used in early prenatal diagnosis due to its fast and accurate application.Therefore, it would be suggested that the supernatant from the amniotic fluids’ disposal is prevented because if the tests needs to be repeated, cell-free fetal DNA extracted from the amniotic fluid supernatant can be used as an alternative source for prenatal diagnosis.\n\nM. soltani: None.

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) is an X-linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in AR gene. The aim of this work was to describe a family presenting with DSD and all the multidisciplinary approaches that were needed to achieve the precise diagnosis and correct follow-up. Materials and Methods: Both clinical and biochemical characteristics of three individuals from two generations of a family presenting with DSD are described. Karyotype, SRY FISH and sequence analysis from AR or SRD5A2 genes were performed according to the clinical clues. Results: Our index case, a 17 years old girl, presented with primary amenorrhea, normal female external genitalia, absence uterus on MRI and 46,XY karyotype. Hormonal studies revealed high delta-4-androstenedione, very high testosterone and low dihydrotestosterone. Her maternal aunt and her young sister have the same phenotype. A pathogenic variant c.1508G > A in exon 1 of AR gene was found in hemizygosity in all patients and in heterozygosity in the mother. A secondary 5-α-reductase deficiency could explain the hormonal profile detected in our AIS patients. The management includes hormone replacement therapy, prophylactic gonadectomy, psychological support and genetic counselling.\n\nConclusions: DSD are rare however extremely significant conditions that may interfere with life quality, so all efforts should be made in order to get the precise diagnosis as well as the best care possible.\n\nA.R.

At last, over 1,000 mutations have been reported in AR gene and with most of these being associated with incombatible genotype and phenotypes. Clinical findings are external genitalia at birth, abnormal secondary sexual development in puberty, and infertility in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype as typically characterized androgen insensitivity syndrome. Materials and Methods: In our case, 17 year old female phenotype presented with primary amenorrhoea and the predominantly female external genitalia. Patient, had spontaneous once menarche but not continued. Radiology results had demostrated the absence of uterus and vagina, only right ovary avaliable. Firstly, we analyzed karyotype, then detected the gene with sequence analysis and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to exclude large deletions and duplications. Results: Patient had 46, XY karyotype and female phenotype, MLPA test is normal but the results of the gene sequence is not. We detected a missense mutation in first ekson. GAA codon was turned into GGA. Substituting at position 529 to glutamic acide exchange to glycine. NM000044 c.5 A >G variant was neither found in ExAc or 1000 genome base. Conclusion: We have detected a novel mutation on AR gene immediately after start codon at fifth nucleotide. Glutamic acide is polar aminoacide with negative charge while glycine is stayed in non polar hydrophobic group. Lastly, the mutation may cause to physical defect on protein and native three dimensional structure.\n\nA.G. Zamanı: None. M.N. Somuncu: None. E. Goktas: None. K. Gezginç: None. M.S.

Complejo Hospitalario de Granada., Granada, Spain, 4Complejo Hospitalario de Granada, Granada, Spain\n\nThe clinical utility of array comparative genomic hibridization (CGH) in the prenatal samples has been prove to be effective, but it is still in discussion on how to apply array CGH into clinical service, and whether array CGH shold replace the conventional cytogenetics. A total of 118 prenatal samples from patients with abnormal ultrasound were selected, 58 of then were chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and 60 amniocentesis. karyotype and array CGH was performed in all of then. Karyotype was performed according with the giemsa standar thecnique. Array CGH with a 180 K resolution, was performed with the Nimblegen CGX Citogenetic Microarrays Platform, supplied by PerkinElmer. From the 118 cases, in 9 (8,1%) was detected a chromosomal abnormality, but when array CGH was performed, the number of samples with pathogenic chomosomal anomalies increased to 20 (17%), in all cases where a patologic karyotype was detected (9 cases), the array CGH detected the same patologic chromosomal alteration. When karyotype was normal, in 11 cases the array detected microduplications o microdelections that can be considered patologics (CNAs) Our results with an increase in the detection rate are in accordance with previous publications were the patological chomosomal abnormalities detected with array CGH is highly increased when compared with karyoptype. This significantly increased detection of chromosome anomalies, from 8,1 to 17%, after applying microarray analysis for prenatal testing with abnormal ultrasound supports the use of arrays as first tier test for prenatal diagnosis in cases with abnormal ultrasound detected.\n\nM.

We retrospectively compared QUAD vs. DUAL strategies. Material and Methods: Forty-seven T21 pregnancies (ascertained 2008–2016) by the DUAL (Kryptor; ThermoFischer Sci.; USA) were re-examined using QUAD (Delphia Xpress -LifeCycle software; Perkin Elmer; USA) for final risk (FR) and biochemistry only (BO) ascertainment with cut offs- 1:300 (positivity) and 1:301- 1:2000 (intermediate risk). Biomarker MOM levels, age-related risk, higher NT were also considered. Results: QUAD FR for 1:300 was detected in 72.34% of all cases, BO in 87.23%, while in DUAL 59.57% and 65.95%, respectively. Integration of FR with BO in QUAD increased positivity to 91.49%, while in DUAL to 74.46%. If 3 cases with QUAD FR 1:337, BO 1:390, age risk 1:77, higher NT and age risk 1:458 had been included, QUAD might achieve 97.87% T21 detection rate. However, if 5 cases with DUAL BO within 1:459–1:810 had been taken into account, this rate would be only 85.10%. QUAD FR in > 1:2000 was 6.38%, while in DUAL it was 19.15%, with BO 6.38%. DUAL achieved lower 21.28% PAPP-A prevalence versus 55.32% in QUAD. Only in one case all makers were normal in QUAD / DUAL.\n\nConclusions: QUAD provides significantly higher detection rate and reliability within 1:300 risk and achieves better screening outcomes than DUAL.

Women who inherit BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have a 50%–80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 16%–65% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. Many women need genetic counseling and testing to learn about their risk status and its implications. Although most women who seek counseling and testing are past reproductive age, some still are in their childbearing years. Case report. A 32 year old female at 23 weeks gestational age (G.A) with breast cancer diagnosis presented for genetic testing and counseling. Histopathological examination indicated an invasive ductal carcinoma with triple-negative cancer (cancer stage 2B [pT3N0M0]). The patient’s mother died at age 47 due to breast cancer and denied any use of alcohol or cigarettes. She had her regular menstrual periods and never used oral contraceptives. Her menarche was at 11 years of age. Her family history, young-onset disease, and histopathological findings suggested HBOC (Hereditary Predisposition to Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome). She underwent genetic testing for BRCA1/2, though genetic counseling was provided. The result was positive for a BRCA2 mutation. The patient wishes to know if pregnancy impacts upon their future risks of cancer recurrence and survival. Conclusion. In cases of pregnancy-related breast cancer, consideration must be given to whether the pregnancy should be continued and to posttreatment fertility. Genetic counseling should be provided and the patient should be checked for the BRCA mutation, as it is meaningful for the future of any potential children and should be provided even if the cancer is advanced or recurrent.\n\nR.

Shterev1, I. Dimova2\n\n1Ob./Gyn. Hospital “D-r Shterev”, Sofia, Bulgaria, 2Department of Medical genetics, Medical University Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nBackground: Reproductive genetics combines reproductive and genetic technologies aiming in precise diagnostics and the most suitable therapeutic options, as well as prevention of birth of children with congenital anomalies and genetic diseases. We aimed at determining the types and frequency of the chromosome aberrations in patients with reproductive failure - sterility, miscarriages, stillbirths, and implantation failures after in vitro procedures. Materials and Methods: We have analysed 488 patients from our reproductive clinics by karyotype analysis using G-banding technique. Results: We detected 21 (4.3%) cytogenetic aberrations, both numerical and structural. Klinefelter syndrome was revealed in 2 out of 27 azoospermic men (7.4%). Structural chromosomal rearrangements were established in 4 out of 258 women (1.6%), and in 3 out of 230 men (1.3%). One complex three-way translocation was detected in a woman, it has familial character - 46, XX, t(1p31- > 11q22- > 8q12- > 1p31). The other translocations included: 46, ХХ, t(7; 10)(q11; p13); 46, XX, t(9; 11)(p23; p12); 46, ХХ, t(11; 22)(q23; q11.2); 46, XY, t(5, 6)(p13; q16); 46, ХУ, t(1; 11)(p36.1; q12). One ring chromosome 21 (46, XY, r(21)) was found in an azoospermic man. In 1% of tested patients we found inversion of chromosome 9. Sex chromosome low level mosaicism was found in 1% as well. Conclusions: In about 5% of patients attending reproductive clinics cytogenetic abnormalities were revealed. They have important impact for therapy decision making. In two of translocation carriers successful pregnancy was realized by means of preimplantation genetic diagnostics.\n\nM. Dimitrova: None. N. Trpchevska: None. M. Hristova-Savova: None. T.

As a result, many parts of chromosomes remain deleted. The rupture is due to external or internal mutagenic factors such as ionizing radiation, free radicals, and mutations in the genes for cell repair mechanisms. The consequences are associated with impaired apoptosis, cell division and survival. Impaired apoptosis in turn leads to hypodiploidy. Materials and methods: We report here 4 cases with ultrasound or cytogenetic anomalies of the fetus, which have been analyzed by array CGH analysis. Results: In a case with multiple development anomalies (agenesis of corpus callosum, tetralogy of Fallot, omphalocele) we detected multiple genomic deletions, varied from del1p36 to monosomies of chromosomes 15, 16, 17, 19 and 22. In the second case with intrauterine retardation, severe heart malformation and fetal death, we detected deletion of 19p and additional multiple genomic deletions - the larger were del17p13 ( > 4 Mbp), del17q21 ( > 4 Mbp), del22q13 ( > 4 Mbp). In the case with marker chromosome we established duplication of 18p (explaining the marker) and multiple additional deletions, including 1p36, 7q11, 7q21, 12q22-q24, 17p13-q21, 22q, and monosomies of chromosomes 16 and 19. Finally, more than 300 genomic aberrations (more than 80% of them were deletions), varied between several Kbp up to 5 Mbp, were detected in a fetus with holoprosencephaly.

Voskoboinik1\n\n1Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel, 2The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, 3Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nIntroduction: Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are structural rearrangements involving at least three breakpoints on two or more chromosomes. Such occurrences in phenotypically normal persons are rare, and the risk for abnormalities increases with the number of breaks. The majority of CCRs detected prenatally are de novo. Case Details: We present a case of fetal brain malformations including agenesis of corpus callosum, severe microcephaly, malformed vermis and distinct facial features at 24 weeks gestation. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a CCR with deletions of the long arms of chromosomes 1, 5, and 10 and at least six breakpoints, two on each chromosome: 46,XY,del(1)(q32.3q42,1),del(5)(q13.3q15),del(10)(q22q23). Chromosomal microarray (CMA) further defined the chromosomal aberrations as a loss of 1357 Kb on chromosome 1q41, a loss of 1409 Kb on chromosome 5q14.3 and a loss of 737 Kb on chromosome 10q23.31. These losses include 16 OMIM genes, 6 of which are disease-associated genes. Parental karyotype and CMA were normal. The couple chose to terminate the pregnancy. Discussion: Interstitial deletions within chromosome bands 5q14.2q15 have been described in patients with severe mental retardation, epilepsy and variable congenital brain anomalies. The severe fetal malformations were likely the result of the extensive CCR. Using both conventional karyotyping in conjunction with CMA improves our understanding of such complex rearrangements, provides an additional tool for genetic counseling and facilitates parental reproductive choices.\n\nA.

Almadani\n\nRoyan, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nIntroduction: Testicular descent is a process which is sometimes insufficient and results in cryptorchidism or undescended testis (UDT). Cryptorchidism is a risk factor for infertility and cancer. It has different reasons like genetic factors. Some studies have been reported about cryptorchidism boys with chromosomal anomalies.Our purpose was to investigate the association between cryptorchidism infertile men and their chromosomal constitutions in Iranian population. Materials & Methods: This research was conducted on 522 infertile men with UDT who referred to Royan institute during five years. They were selected after clinical examinations, hormonal tests, and semen and karyotype analysis. All the patients were divided into azoosperm or oligoosperm, unilateral or bilateral group. Karyotype was performed using standard GTG banding technique. Results: 348 azoosperm (66.66%), 174 oligoosperm (33.4%) and 45 (8.62%) chromosomal alterations were detected. Among these, seven had normal variations (1.34%) and the remaining 38 patients (7.3%) had abnormal karyotypes. Unilateral UDT were diagnosed in most of the patients with abnormal karyotypes. Klinefelter and mosaicism were the most common abnormalities, in 18 (3.44%) and 10 cases (1.91%) respectively. Furthermore, sex reversal, structural and 47, XYY syndrome were detected with lower incidence. In addition, hormonal profile showed the elevation of FSH and LH and reduction of testosterone in most of the patients with UDT. Conclusions: It seems that cryptorchidism is associated with abnormal karyotype. In case of using ART for infertility treatments, it is recommended to perform karyotype in UDT patients because they may have chromosomal abnormalities.

Clinical phenotype with 18q deletion is highly variable and mostly depends on the extent of genomic deletion and loss of specific genes. For the first time we report terminal deletion of long arm of chromosome 18 as an additional finding of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and thus demonstrate clinical feasibility of next generation sequencing in subchromosomal CNV detection by performing low coverage analysis. Material and methods In house NIPT test was performed in healthy 29-year old woman in 17th week of singleton pregnancy. Genomic library was prepared from cell free DNA isolated from plasma utilizing the TruSeq Nano protocol and paired-end sequencing on MiSeq (Illumina). Sequencing data were processed using in-house bioinformatic algorithm for z score calculation. Results NIPT result for trisomy 21 and 13 was negative, however with inconclusive result for chromosome 18 with abnormal z score of (minus) −16 showing large deletion in terminal part of q arm. A boy was born with severe polystigmatisation and hypotrophy. G-banded karyotype and arrayCGH were performed postnatally identifying 12 Mb deletion. Conclusion Low coverage whole genome scan utilized in NIPT can be a beneficial tool in other CNV detection besides common trisomies, given reasonable size of an event, coverage depth and fetal fraction.\n\nM.

Buyukkurt2\n\n1Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Adana, Turkey, 2Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Adana, Turkey\n\nIntroduction: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common trisomy in live born with a prevalence of 1 in 1000 to 1 in 1100. Enzymes involved in one carbon and transsulfuration (1C/TS) metabolism in mothers and affected individuals with Down syndrome in altering the likelihood of birth of a child with Down syndrome. Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), located on chromosome 21 synthesises cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. Trisomy for CBS may be hypothesised to decrease the availability of functional 1-C folate units. We have looked for an association of polymorphism in the CBS gene and the risk of birth of a child with Down syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, sixty-seven DS mothers and fifty-three mothers who had no children with DS from Çukurova region of Turkey were evaluated. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole peripheral blood collected on EDTA, using salting out method. The CBS genotypes were studied by PCR-amplified products. FINDINGS AND Results: Among controls, the genotypes of A1A1 and A1A2 were observed in 81% and 19%, respectively, whereas the A1A1 and A1A2 genotypes were observed in 85% and 15% of case patients, respectively for CBS 844ins68 polymorphism. ConclusIon: The results showed that the frequencies of CBS alleles (A1 and A2), as well as the frequencies of CBS 844ins68 genotypes (A1A1 and A1A2) do not correlate with DS pregnancies, demonstrating no difference between the case and control groups.\n\nA.

We aimed to investigate the potential role of recently reported prothrombin (FII) c.*64_*66del gene variant in the etiology of fetal loss by case-control study approach and functional analyses.\n\nMaterials and methods: Study included 105 women with fetal loss and 154 controls. Functional assays including prothrombin activity, prothrombin plasma level, and endogenous thrombin potential were performed on plasma samples of c.*64_*66del carriers. The Cos-7 cells were transfected with two types of constructs: 1. vectors carrying wild-type and c.*64_*66del mutant full-length prothrombin cDNA; 2. vectors carrying wild-type and mutant cDNA extended with downstream regulatory element (DSE) and expression levels were determined on mRNA level by Real-time PCR and protein level by Western blot.\n\nResults: Among women with fetal loss, three heterozygous carriers were detected, while none was recorded among controls (0 R = 10.55; 95%CI 0.54–206.43; p = 0.12). Normal prothrombin activity and plasma level were observed in all c.*64_*66del carriers. Endogenous thrombin potential was increased in carriers (98% ± 6.93) compared to control plasma (86%), but without statistically significant difference. In vitro analyses showed statistically significant decrease in prothrombin mRNA level for both mutant constructs (p < 0.001). Decrease was observed on protein level as well, but statistical significance was reached only for mutant construct without DSE (p = 0.028).\n\nConclusion: Our study indicated that FII c.*64_*66del variant is associated with decreased prothrombin gene expression which suggests its potential role in fetal loss etiology.

Gaber1\n\n1National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt, 2The American University in Cairo (AUC), Cairo, Egypt\n\nBackground: Genodermatoses are severe inherited disorders. A great success in identifying responsible genes and characterizing gene mutations paved the road for DNA-based prenatal diagnosis. Examples of severe genodermatoses candidates for prenatal diagnosis include autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), Xerodema pigmentosum (XP), Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) and Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (PLS) where clinical severity affects span &/or quality of life hence urging prenatal diagnosis.\n\nMaterials and methods: The study included seven amniotic samples (AF) from carrier mothers descending from seven pedigrees with history of affected sibs with severe genodermatoses including; two mothers of previous ARCI cases, three XP, one SLS and one PLS. DNA was extracted from AF by QIA gene extraction kit followed by mutational screening for XPA, TGM1, ALDH3A2 and CTSC genes\n\nResults: Prenatal diagnosis was successfully performed in all cases. For the three families with history of XPA, two fetuses were found to be heterozygous carriers: one for E111X mutation and the other for R207X while the third was homozygous for T125IfsX15. For ALDH3A2 gene, the fetus was affected for E331X nonsense mutation; for TGM1 gene, the two fetuses were heterozygous carriers for R264W and R143H missense mutations. The fifth AF sample PLS showed homozygous wild type genotype.\n\nConclusion: The high incidence of consanguinity and consequently AR rare disorders combined with the lack of curative therapy, points to the importance of implementing preventive programs. Prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling represent an important step in prevention and alleviating the burden of severe genodermatoses on the family & community.\n\nK. Amr: None. E. Rabie: None. G.

Paiva1, S. Franco4, F. Coelho4, G. Oliveira5, J. B. Melo1,2,3\n\n1Laboratório de Citogenética e Genómica da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 2CIMAGO - Centro de Investigação em Ambiente, Genética e Oncobiologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 3CNC-IBILI, Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 4Serviço de Obstetrícia A, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 5Centro do Desenvolvimento da Criança, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.\n\nA genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1) chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic-gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unexpected recurrences happen from apparently non-carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/ somatic-gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Parental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oral mucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335–93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormality is associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is influenced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. In recurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during the counseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously influence genetic risk.\n\nI.M.

Guney\n\nMarmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nA 36 year-old patient with azospermia admitted to our out-patient clinic before IVF theraphy. He had 46 × , inv Y (p11q11.2) at his conventional karyotype analysis. His wife had 46,XX normal karyotype and had FVL heterozygote, MTHFR A1298C heterozygote mutations. She was normoglycemic, her hormone profile was normal and had intact tubal structure at hysterosalphingography. At the pedigree analysis the patient’s parents were first degree cousins and he had 2 sisters and four brothers. The patient had 2 brothers having the inversion Y (p11q11.2) karyotype abnormality while one of them was fertile having two children, a daughter and a son. Other married brother had no children due to female infertility factor. Remaining 2 brothers were single. Array CGH analysis of the patient revealed increases and losses at X and Y chromosomal homologue pseudoautosomal regions and a loss of 30815 kb area at Yp11.21q11.23 region. He had azospermia and at Sanger fragment analysis for Y chromosome deletion, there was loss of sY160 marker.

Chrudimská1, H. Klučková1, T. Lerman2, M. Macek Jr.1, G. Griesinger2, M. Macek Sr.1\n\n12nd Faculty of Medicine - Charles University and Faculty Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kinderwunschzentrum, Lübeck, Germany\n\nIntroduction: There are 3 common variants which impact on the receptor function of the LHCGR gene - ins18LQ (rs2293275), Asn291Ser (rs12470652) and Ser312Asn (rs2293275). Thus far, their combined effect on controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) was not studied. Our aim was to ascertain their influence on LHCGR function, including their genotype combinations, in Elonva-COH\n\nMaterials and Methods: DNA samples from 48 “low”, 191 “intermediate” and 34 “high” responders (273 patients in total) were genotyped using fragment analysis for ins18LQ and TaqMan assays for Asn291Ser and Ser312Asn variants.\n\nResults: The genotype frequency within COH response categories was in the range 56,0%–64,7% for wt/wt, 29,4%–31,3% for wt/ins18LQ and 5,9%–6,3% for insLQ/insLQ genotypes in insLQ variant. It was 81,3%–94,1% for Asn/Asn, 5,9%–18,8% for Asn/Ser and 0%–0,5% for Ser/Ser genotypes in Asn291Ser variant, and 35,3%–35,6% for Ser/Ser, 39,6%–55,9% for Ser/Asn and 8,8%–25,0% for Asn/Asn genotypes in Ser312Asn. No differences in genotype frequencies was found between”low”, “intermediate” and “high” responders in COH (p ≥ 0,05). Therefore, these variants cannot predict individual response to COH. Moreover, genotype combinations of studied variants did not have any significant differences, likely due to their low number within compared categories.\n\nConclusions: The prevalence of LHCGR gene variants ins18LQ, Asn291Ser and Ser312Asn is not statistically different within low, intermediate and high responders in Elonva-COH, which precludes clinical utility of their examination within this context.

Tsai1, Y. Teng2\n\n1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, 2Department of Biological Sciences and Technology, National University of Tainan, Tainan, Taiwan\n\nMicroRNA (miRNA) was shown to regulate critical processes in fundamental cell biology and disease formation. Several miRNAs are expressed in human gestational tissue and some are identified to be associated with placenta dysfunction and abnormal pregnancy status, such as intrauterine fetal restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, ectopic pregnancy and recurrent miscarriages (RM). In order to investigate the roles of miR-346 and miR-582-3p in the adverse events of obstetric field, we analyzed these 2 miRNAs of trio samples (maternal plasma, cord blood and placenta) obtained from pregnant women of healthy control (n = 60), preeclampsia (n = 25), preterm delivery (n = 25), preterm premature rupture of membrane (n = 20) and IUGR (n = 20). The expression level of miR-346 in all included adverse obstetric outcome groups was significantly higher in maternal plasma samples (all p value < 0.05) but significantly lower in cord blood and placenta samples (all p value < 0.05). Besides, the miR-582-3p level in maternal plasma is also significantly higher in the groups of preeclampsia and IUGR (both p < 0.05) compared with normal controls. The results suggest these 2 miRNAs might play different roles in maternal and fetal systems to develop obstetric disorders, and these aberrant miRNAs expression could be biomarkers of adverse obstetric risks.

Fazli\n\nDepartment of Molecular Biology, Ahar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahar, Iran., Ahar, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nPurpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play very important roles in several physiological procedures such as successful pregnancy. Recently, findings have indicated that aberrant miRNAs gene expression and single nucleotide variation in the gene encoded miRNAs could be contributed in the pathogenesis of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Materials and Method: We were analyzing a total of 200 subjects, which were included 100 women experienced three or more recurrent miscarriages and 100 women’s health with one child and without historical aberrations. MiR-499 A >G gene polymorphism was performed by PCR-RFLP technique to assess association between the presence miRNA gene variant and with the risk of RPL. Results: Our results showed that the frequency of genotypes in the normal homozygote (AA), heterozygote (AG) and mutant homozygote (GG) of miR-499 in patients and healthy women, 29%, 38%, 33% and 43%, 36%, 19%, respectively. Statistical analysis was shown significant difference genotype frequencies between cases and control groups (p = 0.011). Conclusion: These data suggested that A >G genetic variation in the miR-499 gene encoding region could be contributed as a predisposing genetic factor to RPL.\n\nS. Ghorbian: None. M.

It is accepted that MMPs are resistant to suppression by progesterone. The capacity of progesterone affect to gene expression is dependent on PR-A/-B that imbalanced ratio may cause progesterone resistance in endometriosis. Imbalance ratio of PR-A/-B via + 331G/A may be able to consequence MMP-2,-9 overexpression, which can be important in pathogenesis of endometriosis. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were recruited from 98 women undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis and 102 healthy fertile women. Ectopic and eutopic tissues were prepared from twenty endometriosis and endometrial tissue from 20 non-endometriosis women. After DNA extraction from blood samples, genotype frequencies were determined by PCR-RFLP. RNA was extracted from tissue samples to analysis of PR-A, PR-B, MMP-2,-9 mRNA expressions by Real-time PCR. Results: Frequency distributions of GG, GA genotypes in + 331G/A polymorphism were 98.04%, 1.96% in patients and 97.96%, 2.04% in control groups respectively (P > 0.05). We demonstrated higher expression level of PR-B in eutopic endometrium of patients bearing GA compared to patients with GG genotypes (P = 0.017). Significant overexpression of MMP-9 in ectopic samples was observed compared to control endometrial tissues, as well (P = 0.014). Conclusions: + 331G/A seemed to have high transcriptional activity of PR-B promoter by favoring GA to GG. Our findings support alteration of PR-A/-B ratio in endometriosis, which may be associated with MMP-9 overexpression that can be important in pathogenesis of disease.

Pribushenya\n\nCenter “Mother and Child”, Minsk, Belarus\n\nIntroduction: First-trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and second-trimester amniocentesis are widely used methods for the prenatal detection of chromosome abnormalities. We analysed identification of mosaicism cases when using both methods for cytogenetic investigation of CVS cells. Materials and Methods: Between 1996 and 2016 we collected 5309 first-trimester CVS in our department. Karyotyping was routinely performed by GTG-banding using the Trypsin-Giemsa staining technique. Cytogenetic results were obtained in 5269 first-trimester CVS (99,2%). Investigation was performed using short term culture (STC) and long term culture (LTC) techniques. Mosaicism was estimated only for cases, investigated by both methods (4466 CVS in total). Results: Mosaicism was identified in 134 cases (3,0% of CVS all taken into consideration), of which 43 (32,1%) absolute discordant karyotypes were detected by different methods (STC and LTC). A wide variety of abnormalities included quantitative abnormalities, supernumerary marker chromosomes, tetraploidy and structural rearrangements. Quantitative abnormalities of autosomes (72) and of sex chromosomes (37) were most frequently encountered mosaics. Remarkably, among the 19 occurences of mosaic Down’s syndrome in the fetus, the STC cells in 6 cases had normal karyotypes. Detection of trisomy 21 in the STC or LTC cells were always confirmed in the fetus. Both false-positive and false-negative results were obtained in trisomy 13 (12 samples in total) in STC cells. Conclusions: Decision on pregnancy continuation after detecting mosaicism requires an individual approach based on medical history and ultrasound; in some cases additional examinations are often indispensable.\n\nE.

Dimova3\n\n1SAGBAL “Dr Shterev”, Sofia, Bulgaria, 2Center of Molecular medicine, Medical University Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria, 3Department of Medical genetics, Medical University Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nIntroduction: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) is an anomaly of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts, characterized by underdeveloped or missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia, combined or not with the anomalies of ovaries and kidneys (type A and B). Its frequency in the general population is 1 in 4000–5000 live born girls and it is the etiology in 15% of cases with primary amenorrhea. Materials and methods: We have examined two sisters (age 22 and 15), both affected by Type A MRKH syndrome by using cytogenetic and array CGH analysis. The parents underwent the same testing. Results: Cytogenetic analysis showed normal karyotype. In one of the sisters, a breakage on chromosome 17q was detected. The detailed microarray analysis showed copy-number variations (CNVs) inherited from the parents and identified two copy-number variations with identical size present only in the sisters: arr(hg19)17q21.31(44171888-44351152)x3 and arr(hg19)14q11.2(19373465-19768157)x3. The first aberrant region contains KANSL1 gene, which is associated with histone modifications and acetylation. Region 17q21.31 is a hot spot for rearranagements and its CNVs are associated with different phenotypes. Conclusion: Genomic microstructural aberrations have been established in MRKH syndrome - microduplications of 17q21.31 and 14q11.2.

Das1\n\n1University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, 2IPGME&R SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India\n\nIntroduction: Neural tube defects (NTDs), one of the most common forms of birth defect are highly prevalent in India (5 per 1000 birth). Studies revealed the association between genetic polymorphisms and NTDs in different part of the Globe. The aim of our study was to find out the association between MTHFR (methyltetrahydrofolate reductase) gene polymorphisms and the risk of NTDs in eastern India. Materials and Methods: MTHFR gene was screened by bi-directional Sequencing in 46 mothers with NTD affected babies and 50 mothers with healthy babies. Results: Two SNPs: rs1801133 (C677T; ala > val) at exon 4 and rs1801131 (A1298C; glu > ala) at exon 7 were identified in our study. Our results showed that the frequency of T allele for rs1801133 was significantly higher in case compared to control (p-value = 0.013, OR = 4.92, 95% CI = 1.28–18.98) and predicted as risk allele for NTDs. Simultaneously, when we combined the variant TT genotype with the CT genotype (i.e., CT + TT), assuming a dominant genetic model, where we observed 4 fold increased risk with the combined genotype CT + TT compared with the CC genotype. On the other hand, the polymorphism rs1801131 was found non-significant to the association with NTDs in our sample. Conclusion: Though we have found the association of rs1801133 with the risk of NTDs, a large replicative study is required to establish the polymorphism for genetic screening protocol.

Most of the methods applied in current practice of NIPT are based on z-score statistics. The value of z-score determines the likelihood of a sample being healthy. However, such tests are known to produce false negative results occasionally. Risk assessment is a way to quantify the probability of such errors.\n\nMaterial and methods We applied methods in probability and statistics to calculate risk assessment of our z-score method more precisely.\n\nResults We incorporated the estimation of sample’s fetal fraction of cfDNA in maternal plasma together with the error of this estimation in the calculation of risk assessment of our z-score method.\n\nConclusion The proper calculation of risk assessment is crucial for NIPT results consulting. False positives and false negatives can lead to wrong decisions such as unnecessary amniocentesis or abortion. For this reason, it is important to know when the administered test can fail.\n\nJ.

Mirfakhraie\n\nShahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nBackground: Genetic factors cause about 10% of male infertility. Cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations are among relatively frequent causes of male infertility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of CFTR gene mutations in non-obstructive azoospermia. Materials and Methods: In this study, we examined the occurrence of common CFTR gene mutations in 100 non obstructive azoospermic patients as test group and 100 fertile individuals as control group. The investigated mutations were ΔF508, G542X, N1303K, W1282X, R117H and probable mutations in exons 4, 7, 10, 11, 20 and 21 in the CFTR gene, using ARMS-PCR, PCR-RFLP and SSCP methods. Results: Thirteen patients (13%) showed 406-6T>C, A120T, I148T, ΔF508, G542X mutations. None of the CFTR gene mutations were observed in the control group. Conclusion: Due to existence of CFTR mutations in DNA samples from non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the couples undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are advised to be screened for CFTR gene mutations.\n\nM.

Khasanova1, I. V. Anisimova2, E. E. Baranova3, M. S. Belenikin4\n\n1Russian Cardiology Research-and-Production Complex, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Further Professional Education “Russian Medical Academy of Continuous Professional Education” of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 4Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University), Dolgoprudny, Russian Federation\n\nBackground: first trimester prenatal screening is based on ultrasound and serum biomarkers and it evaluates only indirect markers of chromosomal abnormalities. Amniocentesis is a gold standard with high accuracy, however invasion is contraindicated in the risk of fetal infection. There is a dilemma for the pregnancy management for women infected by HIV or hepatitis with high risk of fetal aneuploidy. In this case, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) would help to prenatal consultant manage the pregnancy, make the decision about pregnancy prolongation, but mainly to reduce anxiety and stress in pregnant women. The aims of study: discuss about implementation of clinical NIPT protocols for specific group of pregnant, namely for infected women with high risk for the aneuploidies of the fetus. Methods: at 13 week of pregnancy we used Clarigo NIPT (Multiplicom) for woman with high risk at T21 (1:4). The invasive procedure was contraindicated owing to infection by hepatitis B. Results: NIPT called negative trisomy status (trisomy evidence (T21): −3.8; Z-score: −0.3); gender: male). After genetic consulting the pregnancy was prolongated. The boy was born in term, weight 4190 g, length 53 cm and an Apgar score of 8–9; no phenotypic traits for aneuploidy has been detected when viewed by a medical geneticist. Conclusions: This case raised the discussing about implementation of NIPT to clinical protocols for pregnant women with very high risk for the chromosomal abnormalities and with contraindication of invasive procedure. Additional research are required to make full estimation for NIPT utility for discussed category of pregnant women.\n\nZ.B. Khasanova: None. I.V. Anisimova: None. E.E. Baranova: None. M.S.

Nori2\n\n1Department of Molecular Biology, Ahar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahar, Iran., Ahar, Iran, Islamic Republic of, 2Dep.of Biochemistry, Faculty of medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 51664, Iran., Tabriz, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nIntroduction: Repeated implantation failure (RIF) is the most common phenomena during IVF (In vitro fertilization) cycles treatment. Also has been reported that to achieve a successful embryo implementation, presence of nucleotide variant in the P53 PEX4 (R72P), may be a significant effect in the endometrial receptivity of patients with IVF failure.\n\nMaterials and Methods: In case-control investigation, p53 polymorphism PEX4 (R72P) has been assessed in 200 women. We were analyzed 100 patients with IVF failure (two or more failed cycles) as well as 100 individuals with natural pregnancy as a control group, to evaluate the risk assessment between the P53PEX4 (R72P) polymorphism and RIF. Gene amplification was performed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.\n\nResults: Our findings revealed that the frequency of the mutant genotype (PP) among control was 2% compared with 3% for RIF group (p = 0. 81). In addition, the normal homozygote (RR) and heterozygote genotype (RP) frequencies of cases and the control group were demonstrated 47%, 50%and10%, 72%, respectively. However, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0. 196).\n\nConclusions: Data has shown that the frequencies of p53 PEX4 (R72P) nucleotide variables were similar in the RIF and healthy group, and did not consider as a genetic predisposing factor for RIF causes.\n\nS.

Meiner1\n\n1Department of Genetics and Metabolic Diseases, Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel, 2IVF unit, Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel\n\nObjectives: PGD to prevent multiple genetic disorders in the same family is a challenge for the multidisciplinary PGD team that requires perfect coordination between the genetic and IVF teams, as the total embryos suitable for transfer is lowered substantially.\n\nMethods: a retrospective cohort of patients undergoing PGD for two or more indications at Hadassah hospital between the years 2006 to 2016. Data included genetic indications, number of IVF cycles, embryos sampled, embryos transferred (ET), pregnancy rate, and delivery rate. Results: since 2006,859 families underwent PGD. In 15 cases (2%) there was more than one indication. Two cases (consanguineous) of 2 recessive diseases, four cases of two dominant diseases, three couples wished to conceive a healthy matched HLA sibling for a thalassemia major child for and in four cases sexing was added to another monogenic disorder. Two couples had different indications. Number of total cycles for 12 couples was 40, 257 embryos were sampled, 42 (16%) fetuses were suitable for ET, 8 pregnancies and 7 babies deliveries were documented (one twin pregnancy). Two pregnancies are ongoing.\n\nConclusions: Consanguinity proportion in Israel contributes to possibility that both partners carrying more than one recessive disease. Another feature in our study population is assortative mating and the intent to avoid termination of pregnancy. There are some ethical issues regarding the creation of a stem cells donor for his sick brother, the role of sexing in the prevention of autism etc. Multidisciplinary team work is necessary in order to maximize success.\n\nH.

Marachovskaya\n\nSouthern federal university, Rostov-on-Don, Russian Federation\n\nEarly stages of the placenta development depend on the vascular development. VEGFA and TGFβ1 are essential for development of placental vasculation during pregnancy. The aim of the study is to determine the expression level of the growth factors genes in chorionic and decidual tissues during pregnancy. Samples of tissues were taken after surgical termination of normally progressing pregnancies (abortion for social reasons) and spontaneous abortion in 5–9 weeks of gestation. Total RNA was isolated. VEGFA and TGFβ1 expression levels were performed by RT-qPCR method. VEGFA expression in samples of both tissues in control is equal. In comparison with chorionic tissue, the expression of TGFβ1 was increased in decidual tissue in condition of normally progressing pregnancy (p = 0.003). The VEGFA expression level correlated with TGFβ1 expression (р = 0.038). There wasn’t any difference in VEGFA expression level in deciduas and chorionic tissue in condition of normal pregnancy compared to spontaneous abortion. TGFβ1 expression in samples of both tissues in spontaneous abortion is equal. The positive dependence was determined for the level of mRNA VEGFA and TGFβ1 in normal pregnancy (r = 0.6 p = 0.038). The ratio of mRNA levels was changed in decidua (r = −0.76 p = 0.028) in condition of the pregnancy loss. To sum up, we showed that the change of ratio VEGFA and TGFβ1 expression levels in decidua can be associated with spontaneous abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Marachovskaya, E. Mashkina\n\nSouthern federal university, Rostov-on-Don, Russian Federation\n\nThe changes of structural and functional characteristics of the placenta in majority of cases cause the pregnancy loss. The backbone of this problem can be hidden in the polymorphisms of genes. The aim of this research was to investigate the interaction of SNP of such genes as MMP, cytokines and the growth factors among women with the pregnancy loss during the first trimester. The DNA from blood cells of 113 women with early pregnancy loss and 108 women with normally progressing pregnancies were examined. Polymorphisms rs1143627 IL1β, rs1800795 IL6, rs1800872 and rs1800871 IL10, rs1800629 TNFα, rs1799750 MMP1, rs11697325 MMP9, rs1784423 and rs2245803 MMP20, rs11551797 TIMP1, rs2010963 and rs699947 VEGFA, 2073А-T EGFR, Arg25Pro TGFβ1 were revealed by allele-specific PCR. We analyzed gene-gene interactions among polymorphisms using the MDR method. The research showed the certain peculiarities of genotype of women, which increase the risks of miscarriage during the first trimester. It can depend on interaction of genes MMPs, cytokines and growth factors. Genotype MMP9 (А/А) х EGFR (А/Т) х IL10 (G/A) х VEGFA (C/A) is associated with the increasing of risks of pregnancy loss (p = 0.025 OR = 4,5). Another genotype MMP9 (А/G) х EGFR (А/Т) х IL10 (G/А) х VEGFA (C/С) is associated with the reduced risk (p = 0,005 OR = 0.096). Investigated genes participate in structural changes of tissues and placenta formation. The break of implantation and placentation usually become the reason of the great amount of cases of pregnancy loss.

Le Caignec\n\nCHU Nantes, Nantes, France\n\nPGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) is a reproductive technique used along side in vitro fertilisation (IVF) by couples at risk of passing on serious genetic condition. In case of monogenic disorder, indirect diagnosis is performed using polymorphic markers located near the gene of interest to identify the pathogenic chromosome. When possible, direct diagnosis is also performed. Here we report unexpected results in embryos at risk of Steinert disease. Steinert disease is caused by mutation in the DMPK gene located on chr. 19. Molecular analyses were performed on blastomeres of each seven embryos biopsied at J3 of development. All blastomeres of embryo 1 were disomic for chr. 19. Several blastomeres of embryo 1 showed one maternal chr. 19 and one paternal chr. 19. Interestingly, one blastomere carried one paternal chr. 19 while another blastomere carried the other paternal chr. 19. Even more unexpected, one blastomere carried both paternal chr. 19 with no maternal chr. 19. We hypothesize a rescue of trisomy 19 to explain these discordant results.

Watson Institute of Genome Sciences, Hangzhou, China\n\nSpontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) has become one of the most dangerous factors influencing the health of children under 5-years old, especially for the neonates. However, the pathogenesis for sPTB remains unclear. Copy number variants (CNVs) are commonly reported to be associated with pathogenesis and progression of kinds of human disorders, and the relationship between sPTB and CNV has few reported. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether chromosomal fragment variants associated with sPTB. Whole genome sequencing was carried out among 373 spontaneous preterm and 338 term delivery pregnant women, and genome-wide copy number variants were analyzed. We identified 2(0.53%) losses and 5 (1.34%) gains in preterm birth women, 3 (0.89%) losses and 8 (2.37%) gains in term delivery women, ranging from 1.06 Mb to 4.29 Mb. A heterozygous loss at 8q23.1-q23.3 was identified from a 28-week delivered woman and not found in control population. The locus contains an estrogen-responsive gene, which plays a role in the maintenance of maternal immune tolerance during pregnancy and might participate in the initiation of labor. In summary, our study identifies a CNV which associates with spontaneous preterm birth, and takes a new sight into the pathogenesis of preterm birth.

Tohidi\n\nDepartment of Molecular Biology, Ahar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahar, Iran., Ahar, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nIntroduction: Unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss refers to three or more abortions before 20 weeks gestation. Exportin5, is one of the crucial molecules that has been identified in the trophoblast cells of the placenta, which was involved in the biogenesis and processing of Micro-RNA. Human embryo was produced a large number of micro RNA, which were involved in fetal development. Single nucleotide variation in RAN gene (rs14035;C > T) encoded could be changed quality of micro-RNA processing and effect on pregnancy outcome.\n\nMaterials and Methods: In the present study, we were included 100 women with unknown recurrent pregnancy loss as cases group and 100 women that has an at least one live child and without abortion historical, selected as a control group. After DNA extraction, we applied PCR-RFLP method for molecular genotyping of this polymorphism between both groups.\n\nResults: Our findings revealed that the frequency of genotypes in the Wild-type homozygote (CC), heterozygote (CT) and mutant homozygote (TT) of RAN in patients and healthy women, 71%, 25%, 4% and 71%, 20%, 6%, respectively. Statistical analysis was not shown significant difference genotype frequencies between cases and control groups (p = 0.451).

During implantation, Ca2 + plays a major role when uterine undergoes decidualization and fluid absorption. Three genes code for the T-type voltage-gated calcium channels that encoded by CACNA1G, CACNA1H and CACNA1I are expressing in the epithelial cells of a numerous kinds of tissues, such as the human endometrium. Materials and methods: Consent was obtained from patients according local ethical approval. Endometrial injury obtained from 20 infertile women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) between 22–35 years old in 19th–24th days of menstrual cycle (window of implantation) by pipelle. Also, endometrial biopsy obtained from nine 22–35 years old fertile donor women in a cycle before ovarian stimulation as control through window of implantation by pipelle. Relative expression of CACNA1G, CACNA1H and CACNA1I in endometrial samples of fertile and RIF women were evaluated quantitatively by real-time PCR. Results: The data showed mRNA expression of CACNA1H gene decreased significantly in endometrium of RIF patients vs. fertile group. (P-Value ≤ 0.01) Whiles, lower mRNA expression of CACNA1G and increased expression of CACNA1I in endometrium of RIF patients vs. fertile group but these alterations were not significant.

Considering the significant proliferative functions of JAK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and The STAT3 gene provide instructions for making proteins that are part of essential chemical signaling pathways within cells. The STAT3 protein transmits signals for the maturation of immune system cells. We decided to investigate the correlations between miscarriage in Iranian women and JAK2 V617F/C618W/D620K, STAT3 Y640F /D661Y/T632I/S636F/V637M variants. DNA was extracted from blood samples of 24 unrelated Iranian women with three or more unexplained pregnancy losses occurring in the first trimester as well as Forty eight healthy subjects as control group. Genomic DNA was used to detect somatic mutations in JAK2 and STAT3 genes. The PCR products were detected by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and subsequently extracted for sequencing. JAK2 V617F mutation was identified in 6 (28.4%) of 48control. All variants were confirmed by sequencing. Sensitivity studies showed JAK2 V617F (P < 0.05) was associated with decrease IRM (idiopathic recurrent miscarriage) risk in Iranian women and STAT3 Y640F (P > 0.05) and D661Y (P > 0.05) variants were not associated with RM. Our phenotype-genotypic association analysis indicated that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate an association between JAK2 D620K, V617F variants and the risk of RM.

Mohseni\n\nDepartment of Molecular Biology, Ahar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahar, Iran., Ahar, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nIntroduction: Unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss refers to three or more abortions before 20 weeks gestation that approximately occurs in about one percent of the total number of couples. Dicer is an important molecule that has been characterized in the micro-RNA biogenesis procedures. This molecule plays crucial roles in the maturation of micro-RNA and is also involved in DNA damage response. Single nucleotide polymorphism in the Dicer (rs3742330; A >G) encoded gene might be to produce the dysfunctional enzyme which was involved in the implantation process and leads to the pregnancy loss.\n\nMaterials and Methods: We were designed a case-control investigation in the 100 subjects with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss and 100 women with at least one child and without historical abortion as a control group. After DNA extraction, we used PCR-RFLP technique, in order to clarify the association between Dicer gene polymorphism and recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nResults: Our findings revealed that the frequency of genotypes in the Wild-type homozygote (AA), heterozygote (AG) and mutant homozygote (GG) of Dicer in patients and healthy women, 75%, 25%, 0% and 70%, 30%, 0%, respectively. Statistical analysis was not shown significant difference genotype frequencies between cases and control groups (p = 0.430).\n\nConclusions: The present study disclosed that polymorphism of the Dicer gene cannot be considered as a predisposing factor in unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nS.

Sakhi nia\n\nTabriz University Of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, Islamic Republic of\n\nIntroduction: In this case report, we discuss the rare sex chromosomal abnormality of 48, XYYY syndrome, which shares some physical features similar to that of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). Approximately 20 cases of 48, XYYY have been reported to date. Materials and Methods: In this report, a patient who was diagnosed with 48, XYYY syndrome with clinical evaluation and cytogenetic analysis is presented. Quantitative Fluorescence Polymerase Chain Reaction (QF-PCR) was used for rapid sex chromosomal aneuploidy Results: Karyotype analysis indicated a chromosomal composition of 48, XYYY which confirmed the QF-PCR result. the results of QF-PCR indicated an extra pair of Y chromosomes in contrast to the normal male Conclusions: Whilst being a slow procedure, the classical method of detecting extra chromosomes, karyotyping produces reliable results. In contrast to karyotyping, new modern methods of molecular cytogenetics such as QF-PCR are rapid procedures with high accuracy to detect possible chromosomal aneuploidy. QF-PCR is based on polymorph-none- polymorph STRs which indicate the total number of chromosomes. The other advantage in QF-PCR is related to allelic and none allelic STRs which may be useful for distinguishing the origin of a chromosome. Finally, one of the main complaints at presentation in our patient was infertility, as Klinefilter males (47,XXY) are often infertile or have reduced fertility, it may be worth considering the role of increasing numbers of Y chromosomes in infertility.\n\nM. abedi: None.

De Feo1\n\n1Department of genetic and Genomic, Acerra, Italy, 2Department of cytogenetic, Napoli, Italy, 3Department of cytogenetic, Acerra, Italy\n\nAbstract: Apparently balanced reciprocal translocations are a common type of chromosome rearrangements with an estimate incidence range from about 1 in 500 to 1 in 625 human newborns. Rearrangements were found both in clinically unaffected individuals and patients with phenotypic abnormalities. Most are inherited, but approximately one in five are de novo events and introduce a risk of abnormal phenotype in 6.1% of prenatal genetic counseling. Methods: In the present case, we reported the analysis results of prenatal diagnosis using G-banded karyotype, nuclear organizer regions staining and CGH array. Initial chromosome analysis of amniotic fluid samples was performed by standard G-banding. The karyotype analysis was extended on both parents culturing peripheral blood in order to elucidate the chromosome rearrangements in question. Results: The cytogenetic study revealed an atypical translocation 46,XY,t(4;13)(q12;p12) with a peculiar length of satellite stalks of chromosome13. This uncommon condition was highlighted using Ag/NOR staining. After informed consent analysis was extended to the parents. Parental origins of the translocation was excluded by the cytogenetic analysis on both parents defining this to be a de novo rearrangement. Finally using array CGH was confirmed the absence of genetic material lack in proband and the nonappearance alterations in parents corroborating the evidence of de novo balanced translocation. Conclusion: Although balanced translocations are usually associated with normal phenotypes, abnormalities are attributed to an imbalance of dosage sensitive genes that change spatial location and carriers increased risk of reproductive failure. Our results should be interpreted with caution and required a careful follow up.\n\nM. Chetta: None. L. Di Matteo: None. M. Russo: None. V. Sodano: None. D. Costagliola: None. G.

Because of the high carrier rate of beta globin gene mutations in Iran, prenatal diagnosis (PNDs) or Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) are the favored procedures to prevent birth of new β-thalassemia cases. Haplotyping, using STRs (Short Tandem Repeat) markers linked to β-globin gene, would add accuracy to any PND and is essential for every PGD for β-thalassemia. In this research, we identified several novel STR markers linked to the β-globin gene, with the aim of increasing the specificity and sensitivity of the diagnosis. Allele frequency and heterozygosity assessment of these STR markers were studied on 100 unrelated healthy Iranian individuals. In total, 97 alleles were detected for ten STR loci. The observed range of allele frequencies was from 0.7% to 38%. The frequencies of genotype distributions for all ten STRs were found to be P ≥ 0.1876 which is in agreement with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Genotyping of all couples were determined by ARMS, MLPA or Sanger sequencing methods. Linkage analysis was used to confirm the results of molecular findings. Also, PGD was applied for 14 couples at risk of transmitting β-thalassemia to their offspring. We found that these markers can easily be applied to PGD and it would be very useful to be incorporated in some PND cases of β-thalassemia.\n\nZ. Sharifi: None. S. Ghadami: None. F.

It was thought to be a lethal condition but there are reports describing patients who survive. We reported 2 sibs, with neonatal STWS characteristics, offspring of first-cousin parents heterozygous for deletion of LIFR exon 7. Variant doesn’t describe to our knowledge at this time.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Male born at 41 weeks gestation after induced labour for oligohydramnios and with suspicion of skeletal dysplasia in uterus. Presenting at birth: facial anomalies, bowing of long bones, limited mobility of elbows, camptodactyly, respiratory distress and pulmonary hypertension, feeding difficulties and hyperthermic episodes. Parents, first cousin marriage, with positive family history of sib recurrence with a previous 8-month-old son dead with bone dysplasia and acute exacerbation of chronic shortness by bronchiolitis, refused prenatal diagnosis.\n\nResults: Parental consanguinity, sib recurrence and clinical findings suggested STWS syndrome. Sequence analysis of LIFR gen was performed and showed a homozygous exon 7 deletion [r.562_736del];[r.562_736del]. Heterozygous carrier status of both parents was confirmed.\n\nConclusions: Patient survives at 18 months with an improvement in their ability to swallow and regulate breathing as literature describes. The analysis supported the clinical homogeneity of SWS, despite genetic heterogeneity. Although STWS is a rare condition and the prognosis is poor, management strategies could increase long-term survival. Unfortunately, at the moment the family doesn’t accept any genetic advice.\n\nM.

Gribaa\n\nLaboratory of Human Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics and Reproductive Biology Farhat Hached Universi, Sousse, Tunisia\n\nIntroduction: Paternity tests enable to establish the biological relationship between a child and his alleged father. Today, this test is based on DNA fingerprinting using mainly short tandem repeats (STRs) markers. To be the father, an individual must share with the child at least one of the two alleles of each marker studied. We report in this paper a case of null allele genetically confirmed in the context of paternity by genetic fingerprint.\n\nObservation: We performed a genetic study of three members: a mother, her baby, and a supposed father. This study involved the analysis of 15 STRs markers by “PowerPlex 16 System” kit.\n\nResults: Genetic analyzes were performed under the same technical conditions and showed that the VWA marker presented abnormal transmission between the infant and his mother for a null allele. This hypothesis was confirmed by the study of a second kit that enabled to view this allele and showed that it is normally transmitted to the infant.\n\nconclusion: The kits used in the context of paternity by genetic fingerprint use different primers in the amplification of markers and the detection of alleles, which is more or less the specific polymorphisms in each population. So these kits are seen as complementary and should be used concomitantly in the identification by DNA fingerprinting studies. In this study, we have confirmed this situation by molecular genetics tools. However, their clinical and biological implications remain unknown.\n\nW. Manoubi: None. A. Mili: None. A. Msakni: None.

Mathiron, H. Copin, G. Morin, G. Jedraszak\n\nUniversity Hospital of Amiens, Amiens, France\n\nTurner syndrome (TS) is characterized by absence of X chromosome in woman. Different chromosomal anomalies are associated to TS: monosomy X (homogeneous or mosaic) and structural X chromosome anomalies (deletion, Xq isochromosome⋯). Isochromosome Xp is rare, only about ten cases are reported to date. Each of these patients carry the dicentric isochromosome Xp, including a variable part of Xq chromosome, in a mosaic state. We report the case of a prenatally diagnosed girl who carries a complex X-chromosome rearrangement in a mosaic state. Amniocentesis was performed because of intrauterine growth retardation, aortic hypoplasia and atypical serum markers. Karyotyping showed a mosaic 45,X/46,XX with additional X chromosome which seems to have abnormal structure. Array-CGH showed revealed presence of an idic(X)(pter- > q12::q12- > pter) with multiplication of Xq13 region (containing Xist locus). These anomalies were confirmed by FISH. After birth, evolution was marked by growth retardation and persistence of isthmic aortic hypoplasia. Chromosomal abnormalities were confirmed by cytogenetic analyses (FISH, ACPA, semi-quantitative PCR). At the age of 1 year, psychomotor development occurs normally. Prenatal diagnosis of TS can be done fortuitously or following echographic abnormalities. In these cases, discussion about termination of pregnancy is difficult because psychomotor development is usually normal outside the cases of abnormal X with Xist locus loss. For our patient, no case with Xist locus multiplication has been reported to date. Moreover, duplications of Xq12.3q13 and Xq13q21 are associated with psychomotor delay and autism in boys, phenoype is normal in girls. These data make genetic counseling in this sensitive situation.\n\nN. Celton: None. T. Dery: None. M. Gallet: None. A. Mathiron: None. H. Copin: None. G. Morin: None. G.

Kravtsova1\n\n1Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russian Federation, 2Kazan State Medical Academy, Kazan, Russian Federation, 3Kazan State Medical University, Kazan, Russian Federation\n\nIntroduction. The hemostatic changes in blood system of the mother occur in all pregnant women as a result of adaptation of the organism to the condition of pregnancy, most of them towards changes in coagulation system. Previous studies suggest that mutation/polymorphism of genes encoding coagulation factors may increase a risk of uncompleted carriage but this data are very controversial. So, the aim of this study was to determine the association of SNPs in FII, FV, FXI and FII genes with uncompleted carriage in women of Tatar ethnicity (Russia). Materials and methods. Genotyping of FII (rs1799963), FV (rs6025), FXI (rs2289252), FXII (rs1801020) genes mutation/polymorphism was performed by RT-PCR with TaqMan probes in 92 women with insufficient carriage (UC) and 161 women with uncomplicated physiological pregnancy (UPP). Statistical analysis done with packet program RStudio. Results. We observed no significant difference of genotype frequencies in UC and UPP women for commonly studied in complicated pregnancies Leiden mutation (coagulation factor FV), prothrombin FII gene and C46T FXII gene (p > 0.05). However increased genotype CT frequency for FXI gene С22771Т polymorphism (rs2289252, located in intron region) was determined in women with UC (OR 3.19, 95%CI 1.678 - 6.0815) but studied polymorphism didn’t influence changes in hemostatic parameters such as platelet counter, PT and APTT (p > 0.05). Conclusion. Hemostasis instability during pregnancy may cause spontaneous abortion but its effect depends on many factors including the genetic polymorphism that varies among different ethnicity that must be taken into account in genetic counseling practices.\n\nA.

Dimova3\n\n1Office for Technology Transfer in the area of Molecular Genetics and Diagnostics (OTTMGD), Medical Centre “ReproBioMed” Ltd, Sofia, Bulgaria, 2Department of Assisted Reproduction, Medical Centre “ReproBioMed” Ltd, Sofia, Bulgaria, 3Department of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nIntroduction: Approximately one of six couples in reproductive age worldwide experience different difficulties in conceiving. The successful embryo implantation depends on trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion in the endometrium. This is mediated by locally produced molecular factors and hormones. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is one of these factors that play pivotal role in human angiogenesis and embryogenesis. Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected from control women with natural conceived successful pregnancy (n = 21) and patients with reproductive failure (n = 41): RIF - Recurrent Implantation Failures, endometriosis and Recurrent Spontaneous Miscarriages. Genomic DNA was isolated. VEGFA + 405G/C genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP using BsmFI restrictase. Real Time PCR and Sanger capillary sequencing were used for validation. Results: The C allelic frequency was higher in patients group compared to controls (53.6% vs 24%, OR = 3.68, 95% CI, p < 0.002). In addition, we detected statistically significant incidence of the + 405 C/C genotypes in women from the patient group than in control group (37% vs 4%, OR = 16.2, 95% CI, p < 0.02 when calculating against GG genotype). The results of the present study revealed association between the VEGFA + 405 C/C genotype and the risk of development of endometriosis and spontaneous miscarriages. In the RIF the results did not reveal such correlation. Conclusion: This test could be offered to patients with presented indications and special attention to be paid on their clinical management. The study group should be expanded and include more genetic polymorphisms in association with the mentioned reproductive pathologies.\n\nM. Rizov: None. V. Penchev: None. E. Marinova: None. G.
