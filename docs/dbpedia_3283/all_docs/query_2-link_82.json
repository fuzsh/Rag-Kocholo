        "text": "Since 1990, the National Coalition for the Homeless has sponsored National Homeless Personsâ€™ Memorial Day, every year on December 21st, the first day of winter and the longest night of the year, to remember those who have died while living without a place to call home. In many cases, this service will be the only commemoration of their lives. Let us become the voice for those who are not heard or seen by most.\n\nJoin us on December 21st at 7pm at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for an evening of unity, prayer, and remembrance. Let us come together as people of all faiths, to bring light into the darkness.\n\nCLICK HERE TO RSVP"
