        "text": "Mexican mestizo population sub-structure: effects on genetic and forensic statistical parameters.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoris, Gino; Santana, Carla; Meraz-RÃ­os, Marco Antonio; de Lourdes Munoz, MarÃ­a; Majluf-Cruz, Abraham; MagaÃ±a, Jonathan J; Granados, Julio; Quezada, Rosa; Revilla, MarÃ­a Cristina; MartÃ­nez-Salas, Sergio; Xihuitl, Salvador; MartÃ­nez de la Escalera, Gonzalo; DÃ­az-Badillo, Alvaro; Calderon-Aranda, Emma S; GÃ³mez, RocÃ­o\n\n2012-12-01\n\nSince Mexican mestizos are an admixed population, it is necessary to determine the effects that the substructure of the population has on genetic and forensic parameters. With this aim, a study was performed with 15 STR loci (CODIS plus D2S1338 and D19S433) on 1,640 unrelated Mexican mestizos. We determine allele and genotypic frequencies observing departure from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (12 out of 15 loci, with an excess of homozygotes, Fis > 0), as well as pairs of loci in an apparent linkage disequilibrium (13 of 92 loci). We conducted a test for genetic population stratification, the results show that the Mexican mestizo population is substructured into three subgroups, which are in HW and linkage equilibrium. The combination of the 15 loci in the whole population has high forensic efficiency with the capacity to genetically discriminate one individual in one quintillion (1/10(18)). Our data potentially validates the use of these 15 STR loci to establish forensic identity and parentage testing for legal purposes, and offers a powerful tool for genetic variation analysis. However, given that the population is stratified, we highly recommend applying a correction with the inbreeding coefficient in calculations of paternity and forensic studies to avoid erroneous assumptions.\n\nAdmixture and genetic relationships of Mexican Mestizos regarding Latin American and Caribbean populations based on 13 CODIS-STRs.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalazar-Flores, J; ZuÃ±iga-Chiquette, F; Rubi-Castellanos, R; Ãlvarez-Miranda, J L; Zetina-HÃ©rnandez, A; MartÃ­nez-Sevilla, V M; GonzÃ¡lez-Andrade, F; Corach, D; Vullo, C; Ãlvarez, J C; Lorente, J A; SÃ¡nchez-Diz, P; Herrera, R J; Cerda-Flores, R M; MuÃ±oz-Valle, J F; Rangel-Villalobos, H\n\n2015-02-01\n\nShort tandem repeats (STRs) of the combined DNA index system (CODIS) are probably the most employed markers for human identification purposes. STR databases generated to interpret DNA profiles are also helpful for anthropological purposes. In this work, we report admixture, population structure, and genetic relationships of Mexican Mestizos with respect to Latin American and Caribbean populations based on 13 CODIS-STRs. In addition, new STR population data were included from Tijuana, Baja California (Northwest, Mexico), which represents an interesting case of elevated genetic flow as a bordering city with the USA. Inter-population analyses included CODIS-STR data from 11 Mexican Mestizo, 12 Latin American and four Caribbean populations, in addition to European, Amerindian, and African genetic pools as ancestral references. We report allele frequencies and statistical parameters of forensic interest (PD, PE, Het, PIC, typical PI), for 15 STRs in Tijuana, Baja California. This Mexican border city was peculiar by the increase of African ancestry, and by presenting three STRs in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, probably explained by recurrent gene flow. The Amerindian ancestry in Central and Southeast of Mexico was the greatest in Latin America (50.9-68.6%), only comparable with the North of Central America and Ecuador (48.8-56.4%), whereas the European ancestry was prevalent in South America (66.7-75%). The African ancestry in Mexico was the smallest (2.2-6.3%) in Latin America (â¥ 2.6%), particularly regarding Brazil (21%), Honduras (62%), and the Caribbean (43.2-65.2%). CODIS-STRs allowed detecting significant population structure in Latin America based on greater presence of European, Amerindian, and African ancestries in Central/South America, Mexican Mestizos, and the Caribbean, respectively.

Study subjects were physically active Mexican-Mestizo adults (nâ = â608) with body mass index (BMI) values from 18 to 55âkg/m 2 . For each SNP and for the GRS, logistic models were performed to test for simple SNP associations with BMI, fat mass percentage (FMP), waist circumference (WC), and the interaction with VO 2max and muscular endurance (ME). To further understand the SNP or GRS*physical fitness components, generalized linear models were performed. Obesity risk was significantly associated to 6 SNPs (ADRB2 rs1042713, APOB rs512535, PPARA rs1800206, TNFA rs361525, TRHR rs7832552 and rs16892496) after adjustment by gender, age, ancestry, VO 2max , and ME. ME attenuated the influence of APOB rs512535 and TNFA rs361525 on obesity risk in FMP. WC was significantly associated to GRS. Both ME and VO 2max attenuated GRS effect on WC. We report associations for 6 out of 23 SNPs and for the GRS, which confer obesity risk, a novel finding for Mexican-Mestizo physically active population. Also, the importance of including physical fitness components variables in obesity genetic risk studies is highlighted, with special regard to intervention purposes.

The aim of this study was to analyze several risk factors related to the development of osteoporosis in postmenopausal Mexican mestizo women. We included 567 postmenopausal Mexican mestizo women. A structured questionnaire for risk factors was applied and BMD was measured in total hip and lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Nonconditional logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratio. Using World Health Organization criteria, 28.7% of postmenopausal women had osteoporosis, 46.4% had osteopenia, and 24.9% had normal BMD. Each clinical risk factor had a different significance for osteopenia/osteoporosis; however, duration of total breast-feeding, body mass index, and number of years since menopause remained significantly associated with osteopenia/osteoporosis after bone density was added to the nonconditional model. Interestingly, extended periods of accumulated breast-feeding for 24 and 36 months were, in both cases, significantly associated with osteopenia/osteoporosis. Our results confirm the importance of considering the duration of breast-feeding as an important risk factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis. In addition, we find that body mass index is positively associated with BMD. Because of the heterogeneity of the Mexican mestizo population, the risk factor for osteoporosis may not be the same in different ethnic groups.\n\nContribution of Common Genetic Variation to the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in the Mexican Mestizo Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGamboa-MelÃ©ndez, Marco Alberto; Huerta-Chagoya, Alicia; Moreno-MacÃ­as, Hortensia; VÃ¡zquez-CÃ¡rdenas, Paola; OrdÃ³Ã±ez-SÃ¡nchez, MarÃ­a Luisa; RodrÃ­guez-GuillÃ©n, Rosario; Riba, Laura; RodrÃ­guez-Torres, Maribel; Guerra-GarcÃ­a, MarÃ­a Teresa; GuillÃ©n-Pineda, Luz Elizabeth; Choudhry, Shweta; del Bosque-Plata, Laura; Canizales-Quinteros, Samuel; PÃ©rez-Ortiz, Gustavo; Escobedo-Aguirre, Fernando; Parra, Adalberto; Lerman-Garber, Israel; Aguilar-Salinas, Carlos Alberto; TusiÃ©-Luna, MarÃ­a Teresa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSeveral studies have identified nearly 40 different type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci, mainly in European populations, but few of them have been evaluated in the Mexican population. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which 24 common genetic variants previously associated with type 2 diabetes are associated in Mexican Mestizos. Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near genes (KCNJ11, PPARG, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/2B, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, ARHGEF11, JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, FTO, TSPAN8/LGR5, KCNQ1, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, NXPH1, RORA, UBQLNL, and RALGPS2) were genotyped in Mexican Mestizos. A case-control association study comprising 1,027 type 2 diabetic individuals and 990 control individuals was conducted. To account for population stratification, a panel of 104 ancestry-informative markers was analyzed. Association to type 2 diabetes was found for rs13266634 (SLC30A8), rs7923837 (HHEX), rs10811661 (CDKN2A/2B), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs12779790 (CDC123/CAMK1D), and rs2237892 (KCNQ1). In addition, rs7754840 (CDKAL1) was associated in the nonobese type 2 diabetic subgroup, and for rs7903146 (TCF7L2), association was observed for early-onset type 2 diabetes. Lack of association for the rest of the variants may have resulted from insufficient power to detect smaller allele effects.

A group of 107 mestizo parents of NTD children and five control populations: 101 mestizo (M), 50 Huichol (H), 38 Tarahumara (T), 21 Purepecha (P) and 20 Caucasian (C) individuals were typed for the MTHFR C677T variant by the PCR/RFLP (HinfI) method. Genotype frequencies were in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg expectations in all six populations. Allele frequency (%) of the C677T variant was 45 in NTD, 44 in M, 56 in H, 36 in T, 57 in P, 35 in C. Pairwise inter-population comparisons of allele frequency disclosed a very similar distribution between NTD and M groups (exact test, P=0.92). Among controls, differences between M and individual native groups were NS (0.06\n\nMexican mestizo parents. Otherwise, C677T in Mexico is very frequent, especially in Huichol and Purepecha natives, as compared with other groups world wide.\n\nAmylin S20G mutation in Mexican population.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia-Gonzalez, Claudia Lorena; Montoya-Fuentes, Hector; Padilla-Rosas, Miguel; Sanchez-Corona, Jose\n\n2007-04-01\n\nDiabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by defective insulin action or secretion or both with a 10.6% incidence in Mexican Mestizo population, DM2 is also classified within the localized misfolding diseases due to the amyloid pancreatic deposits found in 90% of the DM2 necropsies. The pancreatic amyloid main component is a protein known as human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) or amylin, the most common mutation is the S20G in Asian population with a polymorphic frequency in DM2 Asian patients. The aim of this study was to search this mutation in Mexican Mestizo general population (104) and DM2 patients (100). This is the first molecular study of hIAPP gene in Mexican population and in which we developed an alternative more effective antisense primer for the analysis of the NFGAILSS region in hIAPP exon 3 critical for the amyloid beta structure formation. We did not find the mutation in any of the 204 analyzed samples, thus the findings show that S20G is not a common mutation in Mexican Mestizo population.\n\nGenetic Epidemiology of Type 2 Diabetes in Mexican Mestizos.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-Chapa, EiralÃ­ Guadalupe; Leal-Ugarte, Evelia; Peralta-Leal, Valeria; DurÃ¡n-GonzÃ¡lez, Jorge; Meza-Espinoza, Juan Pablo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThere are currently about 415 million people with diabetes worldwide, a figure likely to increase to 642 million by 2040. In 2015, Mexico was the second Latin American country and sixth in the world in prevalence of this disorder with nearly 11.5 million of patients. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the main kind of diabetes and its etiology is complex with environmental and genetic factors involved. Indeed, polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with this disease worldwide. To estimate the genetic epidemiology of T2D in Mexican mestizos a systematic bibliographic search of published articles through PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was conducted. Just case-control studies of candidate genes about T2D in Mexican mestizo inhabitants were included. Nineteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were found. In total, 68 polymorphisms of 41 genes were assessed; 26 of them were associated with T2D risk, which were located in ABCA1, ADRB3, CAPN10, CDC123/CAMK1D, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, CRP, ELMO1, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, IRS1, JAZF1, KCNQ1, LOC387761, LTA, NXPH1, SIRT1, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and TNF-Î± genes. Overall, 21 of the 41 analyzed genes were associated with T2D in Mexican mestizos. Such a genetic heterogeneity compares with findings in other ethnic groups.\n\nNasal valve evaluation in the Mexican-Hispanic (mestizo) nose.\n\nPubMed\n\nJasso-RamÃ­rez, Elizabeth; SÃ¡nchez Y BÃ©jar, Fernando; Arcaute Aizpuru, Fernando; Maulen RadovÃ¡n, Irene E; de la Garza Hesles, HÃ©ctor\n\n2018-04-01\n\nOur aim in this study was to determine the angle of the internal nasal valve in Mexican patients with the \"mestizo nose\" feature and without nasal obstructive symptoms. The work was prospective, comparative, and observational in nature and included patients >14 years of age who were seen in the Otolaryngology Department at the Los Angeles Lomas Hospital between April and May 2016. The angle of the internal nasal valve was measured in 30 patients without obstructive symptoms. Endoscopic examination was performed with a 0Â° endoscope framed with tape at a 13-mm distance from the endoscope's tip, and digital photographs of the internal nasal valve were taken. The measurement of the angle of the internal nasal valve was made in sexagesimal degrees using Golden Ratio v3.1 (2012) software. Statistical analysis was performed using Excel v15.13.3. The angles of the internal nasal valve of the patients were (mean Â± standard deviation) 24.07 Â± 4.8Â° for the right nasal cavity and 25.07 Â± 5.0Â° for the left nasal cavity, wider than the angle reported in the normal Caucasian nose established in the literature. According to our results, the Mexican-Hispanic mestizo nose has a wider angle in the internal nasal valve than that considered normal in the literature (10Â°-15Â°). We believe it is necessary to undertake a second study and add an airflow resistance measurement with a rhinomanometry procedure so we can compare the results with those in the Caucasian population.

A sample of 115 unrelated women with BrCa and whose four grandparents were born in five zones of Mexico were interviewed at a reference hospital in Northeastern Mexico. Noncodifying STRs D7S820, D13S317, and D16S39 were analyzed; genotype distribution was in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg expectations for all three markers. Similar allele frequencies among four random populations and this selected population were found. According with this and previous studies using molecular and nonmolecular nuclear DNA markers not associated with any disease, Mexican Mestizo population is genetically homogeneous and therefore, genetic causes of BrCa are less heterogeneous, simplifying genetic epidemiologic studies.\n\nGenetic structure and forensic parameters of 38 Indels for human identification purposes in eight Mexican populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-CortÃ©s, G; GusmÃ£o, L; Pereira, R; Salcido, V H; Favela-Mendoza, A F; MuÃ±oz-Valle, J F; InclÃ¡n-SÃ¡nchez, A; LÃ³pez-HernÃ¡ndez, L B; Rangel-Villalobos, H\n\n2015-07-01\n\nInsertion-deletions for human identification purposes (HID-Indels) offer advantages to solve particular forensic situations and complex paternity cases. In Mexico, admixed population known as Mestizos is the largest (â¼90%), plus a number of Amerindian groups (â¼10%), which have not been studied with HID-Indels. For this reason, allele frequencies and forensic parameters for 38 HID-Indels were estimated in 531 unrelated individuals from one Amerindian (PurÃ©pecha) and seven Mestizo populations from different regions of the country. Genotype distribution was in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg expectations in almost all loci/populations. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) test did not reveal possible associations between loci pairs in all eight Mexican populations. The combined power of discrimination was high in all populations (PD >99.99999999998%). However, the power of exclusion of the 38 HID-Indel system (PE >99.6863%) was reduced regarding most of autosomal STR kits. The assessment of genetic structure (AMOVA) and relationships between populations (FST) demonstrated significant differences among Mexican populations, mainly of the PurÃ©pecha Amerindian group. Among Mexican-Mestizos, three population clusters consistent with geography were defined: (i) North-West region: Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Jalisco; (ii) Central-Southern region: Mexico City, Veracruz and Yucatan; (iii) South region: Chiapas. In brief, this report validates the inclusion of the 38 HID-Indel system in forensic casework and paternity cases in seven Mexican-Mestizo populations from different regions, and in one Mexican Amerindian group.

A total of 39 enucleated eyes with a histopathological diagnosis of uveal melanoma were assessed by describing the clinical findings, and ultrasound, histopathological and genetic features. A high correlation was observed between tumour height measurement using ultrasound and histopathology. In our cases, tumour size and reflectivity were higher compared with those reported in the literature. The preliminary data on the molecular assessment of the tumours show the presence of an unreported polymorphism (T>C IVS5+34) and one sample with GNAQ mutation (A>C CAA>CCA Gln 209 Pro). Ultrasound is a reliable method to identify the size of the tumour. Furthermore, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms promises new perspectives for the development of new targeted therapeutics. Fortunately this leads to progress in the treatment of patients with metastatic disease or prevents it in those at high risk. Copyright Â© 2017 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de OftalmologÃ­a.

Most of the 12 X-STRs were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg expectations in all nine Mexican populations. The power of discrimination in females (PD) and Median exclusion chance for trios (MEC T ) and duos (MEC D ) of this genetic system based on X-STRs were >99.99%. Although Mexican populations showed significant pairwise differentiation, a closer relationship was evident between Amerindian groups and nearby Mestizos, in agreement with historical records, previous genetic studies, and X-linked inheritance pattern expectations.

A caseâcontrol study was performed where 411 pre-eclamptic cases and 613 controls were genotyped. For the rs1800896 of IL-10 and rs1800795 of IL-6, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allelic discrimination and for the VNTR of IL-1Ra, PCR. Allele frequency differences were assessed by Chi-squared test; logistic regression was used to test for associations; a geneâgene interaction was conducted. Genotypic and allelic distribution of the polymorphisms was similar in our population. The estimated of the geneâgene interaction between the polymorphisms did not differ significantly. However, we observed important differences in the distribution of the alleles and genotypes of the three polymorphisms analyzed between Mestiza-Mexicanas and Maya-Mestizo women. In conclusion, we did not find an association between polymorphisms in IL-10, IL-6, and IL-1Ra and PE in Mexican-Mestizo and Maya-Mestizo women. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these three polymorphisms were analyzed together with geneâgene interaction in women with PE.

Genotype distribution was in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg expectations for all 15 STRs. Similarly, linkage disequilibrium test demonstrated no association between pair of loci. The power of exclusion and power of discrimination values were 99.999634444% and >99.99999999%, respectively. Genetic relationship analysis regarding Mestizo populations from the main geographic regions of Mexico suggests that the Center and the present South regions conform one population cluster, separated from the Southeast and Northwest regions.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether micro/macroalbuminuria is associated with ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in Mexican Mestizos with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 435 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, of whom 233 had albuminuria, were characterized for the ACE I/D polymorphism by the polymerase chain reaction method. Clinical and biochemical characteristics and frequencies according to DD, ID and II genotypes in patients with and without albuminuria showed no significant differences. However, only females with micro/macroalbuminuria showed higher frequency of a DD genotype than those without albuminuria (27.9%, 21.2% and 10.5%, respectively; P Mexican Mestizo females with type 2 diabetes, indicating a possible DD genotype-associated sex effect in renal disease.\n\nIdentification of genetic variants in pharmacogenetic genes associated with type 2 diabetes in a Mexican-Mestizo population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Rivera, Nidia Samara; Cuautle-RodrÃ­guez, Patricia; Castillo-NÃ¡jera, Fernando; Molina-Guarneros, Juan Arcadio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent chronic pathologies in the world. In developing countries, such as Mexico, its prevalence represents an important public health and research issue. Determining factors triggering T2DM are environmental and genetic. While diet, exercise and proper weight control are the first measures recommended to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, pharmacological treatment is usually the next step. Within every population there are variations in interindividual drug response, which may be due to genetic background. Some of the most frequent first line T2DM treatments in developing countries are sulfonylureas (SU), whose targets are ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the KATP coding genes, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) and ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8) have been associated with SU response variability. To date, there is little information regarding the mechanism by which these SNPs work within Mexican populations. The present study describes the distribution of three SNPs [KCNJ11 rs5219 (E23K), ABCC8 rs757110 (S1369A) and rs1799854 (â3C/T)] among Mestizo Mexican (MM) T2DM patients, and compares it with published data on various healthy subjects and T2DM populations. Through this comparison, no difference in the KCNJ11 rs5219 and ABCC8 rs757110 allelic and genotypic frequencies in MM were observed compared with the majority of the reported populations of healthy and diabetic individuals among other ethnic groups; except for African and Colombian individuals. By contrast, ABCC8 rs1799854 genomic and allelic frequencies among MM were observed to be significantly different from those reported by the 1000 Genomes Project, and from diabetic patients within other populations reported in the literature, such as the European, Asian and Latin-American individuals [T=0.704, G=0.296; CC=0.506, CT=0.397, TT\n\nIdentification of genetic variants in pharmacogenetic genes associated with type 2 diabetes in a Mexican-Mestizo population.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Rivera, Nidia Samara; Cuautle-RodrÃ­guez, Patricia; Castillo-NÃ¡jera, Fernando; Molina-Guarneros, Juan Arcadio\n\n2017-07-01\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent chronic pathologies in the world. In developing countries, such as Mexico, its prevalence represents an important public health and research issue. Determining factors triggering T2DM are environmental and genetic. While diet, exercise and proper weight control are the first measures recommended to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, pharmacological treatment is usually the next step. Within every population there are variations in interindividual drug response, which may be due to genetic background. Some of the most frequent first line T2DM treatments in developing countries are sulfonylureas (SU), whose targets are ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP ). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the K ATP coding genes, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 ( KCNJ11 ) and ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 ( ABCC8 ) have been associated with SU response variability. To date, there is little information regarding the mechanism by which these SNPs work within Mexican populations. The present study describes the distribution of three SNPs [KCNJ11 rs5219 (E23K), ABCC8 rs757110 (S1369A) and rs1799854 (-3C/T)] among Mestizo Mexican (MM) T2DM patients, and compares it with published data on various healthy subjects and T2DM populations. Through this comparison, no difference in the KCNJ11 rs5219 and ABCC8 rs757110 allelic and genotypic frequencies in MM were observed compared with the majority of the reported populations of healthy and diabetic individuals among other ethnic groups; except for African and Colombian individuals. By contrast, ABCC8 rs1799854 genomic and allelic frequencies among MM were observed to be significantly different from those reported by the 1000 Genomes Project, and from diabetic patients within other populations reported in the literature, such as the European, Asian and Latin-American individuals [T=0.704, G=0.296; CC=0.506, CT=0\n\nGenetic structure of Mexican Mestizos with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on three STR loci.\n\nPubMed\n\nCerda-Flores, Ricardo M; Rivera-Prieto, Roxana A; Pereyra-AlfÃ©rez, Benito; CalderÃ³n-GarcidueÃ±as, Ana L; Barrera-SaldaÃ±a, Hugo A; Gallardo-Blanco, Hugo L; Ortiz-LÃ³pez, RocÃ­o; Flores-PeÃ±a, Yolanda; CÃ¡rdenas-Villarreal, Velia M; Rivas, Fernando; Figueroa, AndrÃ©s; Kshatriya, Gautam\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe aims of this population genetics study were: 1) to ascertain whether Mexicans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were genetically homogeneous and 2) to compare the genetic structure of this selected population with the previously reported data of four random populations (Nuevo LeÃ³n, Hispanics, Chihuahua, and Central Region of Mexico). A sample of 103 unrelated individuals with DM and whose 4 grandparents were born in five zones of Mexico was interviewed in 32 Medical Units in the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). The non-coding STRs D16S539, D7S820, and D13S317 were analyzed. Genotype distribution was in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg expectations for all three markers. Allele frequencies were found to be similar between the selected population and the four random populations. Gene diversity analysis suggested that more than 99.57% of the total gene diversity could be attributed to variation between individuals within the population and 0.43% between the populations. According to the present and previous studies using molecular and non-molecular nuclear DNA markers not associated with any disease, the Mexican Mestizo population is found to be genetically homogeneous and therefore the genetic causes of DM are less heterogeneous, thereby simplifying genetic epidemiological studies as has been found in a previous study with the same design in Mexican women with breast cancer.

In the discovery sample, 300,000 SNPs were genotyped in a cohort of 411 postmenopausal women and seven SNPs were analyzed in the replication cohort (n = 420). The combined results of a meta-analysis from the discovery and replication samples identified two loci, RMND1 (rs6904364, P = 2.77 Ã 10â4) and CCDC170 (rs17081341, P = 1.62 Ã 10â5), associated with FN BMD. We also compared our results with those of the Genetic Factors for Osteoporosis (GEFOS) Consortium meta-analysis. The comparison revealed two loci previously reported in the GEFOS meta-analysis: SOX6 (rs7128738) and PKDCC (rs11887431) associated with FN and LS BMD, respectively, in our study population. Interestingly, rs17081341 rare in Caucasians (minor allele frequencyâ<â0.03) was found in high frequency in our population, which suggests that this association could be specific to non-Caucasian populations. In conclusion, the first pilot Mexican GWA study of BMD confirmed previously identified loci and also demonstrated the importance of studying variability in diverse populations and/or specific populations.

It consists of a low-density lipoprotein and apo(a), a polymorphic glycoprotein. Apo(a) shares sequence homology and fibrin binding with plasminogen, inhibiting its fibrinolytic properties. Lp(a) is considered a link between atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Marked inter-ethnic differences in Lp(a) concentration related to the genetic polymorphism of apo(a) have been reported in several populations. The study examined the structural and functional features of Lp(a) in three Native Mexican populations (Mayos, Mazahuas and Mayas) and in Mestizo subjects. We determined the plasma concentration of Lp(a) by immunonephelometry, apo(a) isoforms by Western blot, Lp(a) fibrin binding by immuno-enzymatic assay and short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphic marker genetic analysis by capillary electrophoresis. Mestizos presented the less skewed distribution and the highest median Lp(a) concentration (13.25 mg dL(-1)) relative to Mazahuas (8.2 mg dL(-1)), Mayas (8.25 mg dL(-1)) and Mayos (6.5 mg dL(-1)). Phenotype distribution was different in Mayas and Mazahuas as compared with the Mestizo group. The higher Lp(a) fibrin-binding capacity was found in the Maya population. There was an inverse relationship between the size of apo(a) polymorphs and both Lp(a) levels and Lp(a) fibrin binding. There is evidence of significative differences in Lp(a) plasma concentration and phenotype distribution in the Native Mexican and the Mestizo group.\n\nEthnicity and lipoprotein(a) polymorphism in Native Mexican populations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCardoso-SaldaÃ±a, Guillermo; De La PeÃ±a-DÃ­az, Aurora; Zamora-GonzÃ¡lez, JosÃ©; Gomez-Ortega, Rocio; Posadas-Romero, Carlos; Izaguirre-Avila, Raul; Malvido-Miranda, Elsa; Morales-Anduaga, Maria Elena; Angles-Cano, Eduardo\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBackground Lp(a) is a lipoparticle of unknown function mainly present in primates and humans.

The present study is an attempt to determine the type of intestinal microbiota in healthy subjects and in patients of Mexican mestizo origin that present with cirrhosis of the liver. Biochemical liver function parameters (ALT, AST, GGT, BIL-T, etc.) were determined in 23 cirrhotic patients and 21 control subjects. The intestinal microbiota was established through 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The cirrhotic patients had elevated levels of ALT, AST, GGT (105.2Â±77.7 vs. 20.99Â±8.5UI/L, 110Â±68.6 vs. 23.39Â±5.2, and 119.1Â±79.1 vs. 19.3Â±15.2UI/L, respectively), IL-6 (1.64Â±0.38pg/ml, P<.001), or TNFÎ± (1.78Â±0.3, P<.05). The intestinal microbiota of the cirrhotic patients was less diverse, compared with that of the control subjects. At the level of the phylum, there was a significant increase in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the patients with cirrhosis, compared with the controls (6.2 vs. 4.9% and 44 vs. 46%, respectively, P<.01). In contrast, there was a decrease in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria in the cirrhotic patients. There was an increase in the Campylobacter and Gemella families in the cirrhotic patients, whereas Streptococcus and Veillonella had a positive association with serum ALT or AST levels. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the type of intestinal microbiota in Mexican patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The extension of the findings in a larger cohort of subjects and the metagenome analysis will enable the creation of data that can have relevant treatment implications for this group of patients in Mexico.

Of these patients, 382 had some hemoglobin (Hb) abnormality (20.5%), 128 had a sickle cell hemoglobinopathy, representing a general frequency of 6.9%, which is similar to the percentage observed in previous studies on Mexican Mestizos. We analyzed the 5' Î²-globin haplotype (5'Hp) in 79 unrelated Î²(S) chromosomes (26 Î²(S)/Î²(S), 14 Î²(S)/Î²(Thal), nine Î²(S)/Î²(A) and four Î²(S)/Î²(D)), and four haplotypes were observed: 72.2% CAR 24.1% Benin, 2.5% Senegal and 1.2% Cameroon; the last two are reported for first time in Mexico. In some Latin American populations such as Brazil, the Bantu haplotype predominates, while in others such as Jamaica, the Benin haplotype is the most frequent, showing heterogeneity of African genes as a consequence of different regions involved in the slave trade.\n\nForensic parameters and admixture in Mestizos from five geographic regions of Mexico based on 20 autosomal STRs (Powerplex 21 system).\n\nPubMed\n\nAguilar-VelÃ¡zquez, J A; MartÃ­nez-CortÃ©s, G; InclÃ¡n-SÃ¡nchez, A; Favela-Mendoza, A F; Velarde-FÃ©lix, J S; Rangel-Villalobos, H\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe analyzed Mestizo (admixed) population samples from different geographic regions of Mexico (nÂ =â1283) with 20 autosomal STRs (PowerPlexÂ® 21, Promega Corp.). Allele frequencies and forensic parameters from the Northwest, Northeast, West, Center, and Southeast regions are reported, as well as from the pooled Mexican population sample. The combined PD and PE for this 20 STR system were >â0.9999999999 and >â0.99999996593% in all five population samples, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of these Mexican population samples, plus Monterrey (Northeast) and Mexico (Center) Cities, showed low but significant differences among Mexican-Mestizos from the seven populations (Fstâ=â0.20%; pâ=â0.0000). Structure analysis showed the highest proportion of Native American ancestry in Mexico City, Center, and Southeast regions, respectively, which was in agreement with the estimated genetic distances represented in a MDS plot and a NJ tree. The best fit of population clusters (Kâ=â4) obtained with the Structure software indicates that Mexican-Mestizos are mainly composed by European, African, and two Native American ancestries. The European and Native American ancestries displayed a contrary gradient, increasing toward the North-West and South-Southeast, respectively. These 20 autosomal STR loci improved the admixture estimation regarding previous studies with the 13 CODIS-STRs, as supported by the higher similarity with previous estimates based on genome-wide SNP. In brief, this study validates the confident use of the PowerPlexÂ® 21 system for human identification purposes in Mestizo populations throughout the Mexican territory.\n\nFrequency distribution of interleukin-10 haplotypes (-1082 A>G, -819 C>T, and -592 C>A) in a Mexican population.\n\nPubMed\n\nVÃ¡zquez-Villamar, M; Palafox-SÃ¡nchez, C A; HernÃ¡ndez-Bello, J; MuÃ±oz-Valle, J F; Valle, Y; Cruz, A; Alatorre-Meza, A I; Oregon-Romero, E\n\n2016-11-03\n\nInterleukin 10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with multiple roles in the immune system. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions -1082 (A>G), -819 (C>T), and -592 (C>A) in the promoter region of the IL10 gene are believed to be associated with different inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. These polymorphisms exhibit a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and form three principal haplotypes (GCC, ACC, and ATA). The GCC and ATA haplotypes have been associated with high and low levels of IL-10 production, respectively. The aim of this study was to establish the allele and haplotype frequencies of the IL10 polymorphisms in Mestizos from western Mexico. SNPs were analyzed in 340 healthy unrelated Mestizos from western Mexico by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The studied population presented significant differences, in the distribution of IL10 polymorphisms, from the Asian, African, and European populations. We also observed a strong LD within -1082 A>G, -819 C>T, and -592 C>A (100% pc = 7.735 x 10 -18 ). The haplotypes ACC (45.4%), ATA (22.0%), GTA (14.9%), and GCC (13.9%) were most frequently observed in this population. The haplotype frequencies, however, differed from those reported previously in Mestizos from central Mexico, Asians, Africans, and European Caucasians, suggesting a differential gene flow in the Mexican Mestizo population. This could account for the genetic variability between Mexicans and populations of other ethnicities. The study of these polymorphisms and their haplotypes could help in expanding our knowledge to design future disease-risk studies on the western Mexican population.\n\nPolymorphisms of APLN-APLNR system are associated with essential hypertension in Mexican-Mestizo individuals.\n\nPubMed\n\nEsteban-MartÃ­nez, Rosa Lilia; PÃ©rez-Razo, Juan Carlos; Vargas-AlarcÃ³n, Gilberto; MartÃ­nez-RodrÃ­guez, Nancy; Cano-MartÃ­nez, Luis Javier; LÃ³pez-HernÃ¡ndez, Luz Berenice; Rojano-MejÃ­a, David; Canto, Patricia; Coral-Vazquez, RamÃ³n Mauricio\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate if polymorphisms of APLN and APLNR genes may play a role as susceptibility markers for hypertension in a group of Mexican-Mestizo patients. A case-control study was carried out including normotensive and hypertensive individuals. For these, two polymorphisms of APLN (rs3761581 and rs56204867) and two of APLNR () genes were genotyped by 5' exonuclease TaqMan assay in 400 normotensive individuals and 383 patients. The results showed that, under an additive model adjusted by BMI, HDL, triglycerides, glucose and family history of essential hypertension, the rs7119375 and rs10501367 polymorphisms of APLNR gene were associated significantly with a decreased risk of essential hypertension (P=0.039 and P=0.029, respectively). Besides, the haplotypes analysis of these polymorphisms showed that H1 haplotype was associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension (P=0.026), while the H2 haplotype was associated with a decreased risk (P=0.032). Contrary, the rs3761581 and rs56204867 polymorphisms of APLN gene were not associated with essential hypertension (P=0.1707 and P=0.0769, respectively). The data suggest that APLNR rs7119375 and rs10501367 are associated with a decreased risk of essential hypertension in our Mexican-Mestizo studied group, but further studies are warranted.

Possible implications of such trait differences on cross-cultural behavioral response to alcohol drinking are discussed.

Several similarities between these complex diseases have been identified. The aim of this study was to analyze if different body mass indexes (BMIs) are associated with variations in bone mineral density (BMD) among postmenopausal Mexican-Mestizo women with normal weight, overweight, or different degrees of obesity. We studied 813 postmenopausal Mexican-Mestizo women. A structured questionnaire for risk factors was applied. Height and weight were used to calculate BMI, whereas BMD in the lumbar spine (LS) and total hip (TH) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. We used ANCOVA to examine the relationship between BMI and BMDs of the LS, TH, and femoral neck (FN), adjusting for confounding factors. Based on World Health Organization criteria, 15.13% of women had normal BMI, 39.11% were overweight, 25.96% had grade 1 obesity, 11.81% had grade 2 obesity, and 7.99% had grade 3 obesity. The higher the BMI, the higher was the BMD at the LS, TH, and FN. The greatest differences in size variations in BMD at these three sites were observed when comparing women with normal BMI versus women with grade 3 obesity. A higher BMI is associated significantly and positively with a higher BMD at the LS, TH, and FN.\n\nMore Evidence for the Genetic Susceptibility of Mexican Population to Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through PNPLA3.\n\nPubMed\n\nChinchilla-LÃ³pez, Paulina; RamÃ­rez-PÃ©rez, Oscar; Cruz-RamÃ³n, Vania; Canizales-Quinteros, Samuel; DomÃ­nguez-LÃ³pez, AarÃ³n; Ponciano-RodrÃ­guez, Guadalupe; SÃ¡nchez-MuÃ±oz, Fausto; MÃ©ndez-SÃ¡nchez, Nahum\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe gene for patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. We previously found that Mexican indigenous population had the highest frequency reported of the PNPLA3 148M risk allele. Further, we observed a relationship between M148M genotype with elevated ALT levels in individuals with normal weight, overweight and obese. We sought to investigate whether PNPLA3 polymorphism is associated with NAFLD development in Mexicans. We enrolled 189 Mexican patients with NAFLD and 201 healthy controls. Anthropometric, metabolic, and biochemical variables were measured, and rs738409 (Ile148Met substitution) polymorphism was genotyped by sequencing. Logistic regression analysis, using a recessive model, suggested that PNPLA3 polymorphism in Mexican population is significantly associated (OR = 1.711, 95% CI: 1.014-2.886; P = 0.044) with NAFLD. The PNPLA3 gene is associated with NAFLD in Mexican population. More studies are required to explain the high prevalence of PNPLA3 polymorphism in Mexican-Americans, Mexican-Indians, and Mexican-Mestizos.\n\nEBV+ lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland in Mexican Mestizo patients with chronic autoimmune diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaqui-Salces, Milena; Martinez-Benitez, Braulio; Gamboa-Dominguez, Armando\n\n2006-01-01\n\nLymphoepithelial carcinomas of the salivary gland are rare tumors constantly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mainly identified in Asiatic and Greenlander population. Four cases have been described in Caucasians, only two with EBV infection. We describe two cases of parotid gland lymphoepithelial carcinomas in Mexican mestizo women in which chronic latent EBV infection was documented by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. One patient had primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and the other systemic lupus erythematosus of six and three years of evolution, respectively. Epithelial neoplastic cells showed latency pattern II (LMP1+, EBNA-2-, EBER+) with a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly by CD8+ T lymphocytes. Follow-up excluded nasopharyngeal involvement in both patients. This report expands the ethnic groups in which salivary lymphoepithelial carcinomas associated with chronic latent EBV infection have been described, and illustrates for the first time its association with autoimmune diseases in two women living in a region non-endemic for this unusual neoplasm.\n\nPhenotype-genotype analysis of CYP2C19 in Colombian mestizo individuals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIsaza, Carlos; Henao, Julieta; MartÃ­nez, JosÃ© H Isaza; Arias, Juan C SepÃºlveda; BeltrÃ¡n, Leonardo\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground Omeprazole is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme to 5-hydroxyomeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits genetic polymorphisms responsible for the presence of poor metabolizers (PMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs) and extensive metabolizers (EMs). The defective mutations of the enzyme and their frequencies change between different ethnic groups; however, the polymorphism of the CYP2C19 gene has not been studied in Colombian mestizos. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotype and phenotype status of CYP2C19 in Colombian mestizos, in order to contribute to the use of appropriate strategies of drug therapy for this population. Methods 189 subjects were genotyped using the multiplex SNaPshot technique and a subgroup of 44 individuals received 20 mg of omeprazole followed by blood collection at 3 hours to determine the omeprazole hydroxylation index by HPLC. Results 83.6%, 15.3% and 1.1% of the subjects were genotyped as EMs, IMs and PMs, respectively. The frequencies of the CYP2C29*1 and CYP2C19*2 alleles were 91.3% and 8.7% respectively whereas the *3, *4, *5, *6 and *8 alleles were not found. No discrepancies were found between the genotype and phenotype of CYP2C19. Conclusion The frequency of poor metabolizers (1.1%) in the Colombian mestizos included in this study is similar to that in Bolivian mestizos (1%) but lower than in Mexican-Americans (3.2%), West Mexicans (6%), Caucasians (5%) and African Americans (5.4%). The results of this study will be useful for drug dosage recommendations in Colombian mestizos.

We included 375 individuals characterized as Mexican-Mestizos and classified by the body mass index (BMI). Body dimensions and distribution of body fat were measured. The HOMA-IR and adiposity indexes were calculated. Adipokines and metabolic profile quantification were performed by ELISA and routine methods. Genetic polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. A difference between obese and nonobese subjects in polymorphism PPARGC1A distribution was observed. Among obese individuals, carriers of genotype 482Gly/Gly were observed to have decreased body fat, BMI, and body fat ratio versus 482Ser/Ser carriers and increased resistin and leptin levels in carriers Gly+ phenotype versus Gly- phenotype. Subjects with PPARG2 Ala- phenotype (genotype 12Pro/Pro) showed a decreased HOMA-IR index versus individuals with Ala+ phenotype (genotypes 12Pro/Ala plus 12Ala/Ala). We propose that, in obese Mexican-Mestizos, the combination of alleles 482Ser in PPARGC1A and 12Pro in PPARG2 represents a reduced metabolic risk profile, even when the adiposity indexes are increased.\n\nThe 482Ser of PPARGC1A and 12Pro of PPARG2 Alleles Are Associated with Reduction of Metabolic Risk Factors Even Obesity in a Mexican-Mestizo Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVÃ¡zquez-Del Mercado, MÃ³nica; GuzmÃ¡n-Ornelas, Milton-Omar; Corona Meraz, Fernanda-Isadora; RÃ­os-Ibarra, Clara-Patricia; Reyes-Serratos, Eduardo-Alejandro; Castro-Albarran, Jorge; RuÃ­z-Quezada, Sandra-Luz; Navarro-HernÃ¡ndez, Rosa-Elena\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between functional polymorphisms Gly482Ser in PPARGC1A and Pro12Ala in PPARG2 with the presence of obesity and metabolic risk factors.

A difference between obese and nonobese subjects in polymorphism PPARGC1A distribution was observed. Among obese individuals, carriers of genotype 482Gly/Gly were observed to have decreased body fat, BMI, and body fat ratio versus 482Ser/Ser carriers and increased resistin and leptin levels in carriers Gly+ phenotype versus Glyâ phenotype. Subjects with PPARG2 Alaâ phenotype (genotype 12Pro/Pro) showed a decreased HOMA-IR index versus individuals with Ala+ phenotype (genotypes 12Pro/Ala plus 12Ala/Ala). We propose that, in obese Mexican-Mestizos, the combination of alleles 482Ser in PPARGC1A and 12Pro in PPARG2 represents a reduced metabolic risk profile, even when the adiposity indexes are increased.

However, their contribution to obesity in other ethnicities such as Mexicans is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to examine 26 obesity-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a sample of Mexican mestizos. Methods 9 SNPs in biological candidate genes showing replications (PPARG, ADRB3, ADRB2, LEPR, GNB3, UCP3, ADIPOQ, UCP2, and NR3C1), and 17 SNPs in or near genes associated with obesity in first, second and third wave GWAS (INSIG2, FTO, MC4R, TMEM18, FAIM2/BCDIN3, BDNF, SH2B1, GNPDA2, NEGR1, KCTD15, SEC16B/RASAL2, NPC1, SFRF10/ETV5, MAF, PRL, MTCH2, and PTER) were genotyped in 1,156 unrelated Mexican-Mestizos including 683 cases (441 obese class I/II and 242 obese class III) and 473 normal-weight controls. In a second stage we selected 12 of the SNPs showing nominal associations with obesity, to seek associations with quantitative obesity-related traits in 3 cohorts including 1,218 Mexican Mestizo children, 945 Mexican Mestizo adults, and 543 Indigenous Mexican adults. Results After adjusting for age, sex and admixture, significant associations with obesity were found for 6 genes in the case-control study (ADIPOQ, FTO, TMEM18, INSIG2, FAIM2/BCDIN3 and BDNF). In addition, SH2B1 was associated only with class I/II obesity and MC4R only with class III obesity. SNPs located at or near FAIM2/BCDIN3, TMEM18, INSIG2, GNPDA2 and SEC16B/RASAL2 were significantly associated with BMI and/or WC in the combined analysis of Mexican-mestizo children and adults, and FTO locus was significantly associated with increased BMI in Indigenous Mexican populations. Conclusions Our findings replicate the association of 8 obesity-related SNPs with obesity risk in Mexican adults, and confirm the role of some of these SNPs in BMI in Mexican adults and children.

As the genetic variability of such SNPs in Hispanic and Native American populations is scarce, we analyzed the three SNPs that have been related with bone mass disorders (Sp1, A163G, and BsmI) located in the genes of Type I Collagen (COL1A1), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) in Mexican Mestizos (people resulting from post-Columbian admixture) and five Amerindian populations. We genotyped these three SNPs by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in 523 individuals from five Mexican Amerindian groups (Nahua, Maya, PurÃ©pecha, Tarahumara, and Huichol) and 227 western Mestizos (Jalisco state). The modal allele was the same in all the six populations for Sp1-COL1A1 (S > 77%), A163G-OPG (A > 80%), and BsmI-VDR (b > 62%). Genotype distribution was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all SNPs/populations, excepting Sp1-COL1A1 in the PurÃ©pecha group and BsmI-VDR in Mestizo. In terms of the presumably Sp1-COL1A1 risk allele to low BMD (allele \"s\"), the PurÃ©pecha group showed the highest allele (23%) and homozygous (14.5%) frequencies. If the role of this allele as a genetic predisposing factor to low BMD were confirmed, this would mean increased susceptibility of PurÃ©pechas with regard to Europeans (14.5 vs. 6.8%). This finding presumably could influence the genetic susceptibility to low BMD in PurÃ©pechas. For the SNPs, BsmI-VDR and A163G-OPG, relative homogeneity was observed among the Mexican populations analyzed here.

The activation of innate immunity is central to the manifestation of sepsis, and toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 plays an important role in this activation process. The 299G and 399I alleles of TLR4 have been linked with an increased risk of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) infections and septic shock in some populations. This case-control study evaluated the prevalence of D299G/T399I polymorphisms in Mexican patients with IAI and/or pneumonia and in healthy controls. Genotyping revealed that 1 in 44 patients (2.3%; CI 95%: 0.05-12.0%) and 4 in 126 controls (3.2%; CI 95%: 0.9-7.9%) were heterozygous for both the D299G and T399l polymorphisms (OR: 0.71, CI 95%: 0.01-7.44, p = NS), confirming the co-segregation of these alleles in this population. Furthermore, the patients with a GNB infection and severe sepsis were not carriers of the risk alleles. In summary, this report shows that the frequency of the D299G and T399I polymorphisms in Mexican-Mestizos is lower than anticipated in comparison with other ethnic groups, emphasizing the variable distribution of TLR4 polymorphisms among different populations. Consequently, this study was not able to detect associations between TLR4 polymorphisms and sepsis in this population. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It has been proposed, that prostate cancer has a genetic predisposition and that PPARGC1A and ADIPOQ polymorphisms play a role in the development of this condition. To analyse the association of two PPARGC1A and ADIPOQ polymorphisms as well as their haplotypes, with the development of aggressive prostate cancer in Mexican-Mestizo men with overweight or obesity. Two hundred fifty seven men with prostate cancer of Mexican-Mestizo origin were included. Body mass index (BMI) was determined and the degree of prostate cancer aggressiveness by the D'Amico classification. DNA was obtained. Rs7665116 and rs2970870 of PPARGC1A, and rs266729 and rs1501299 of ADIPOQ were studied by real-time PCR allelic discrimination. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium, between single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated and haplotype analysis was performed. A higher-risk (D'Amico classification) was observed in 21.8% of patients. An association of cancer aggressiveness with rs2970870 of PPARGC1A, and rs501299 of ADIPOQ, as well as with one haplotype of ADIPOQ was documented. This is the first study regarding the relationship of PPARGC1A and ADIPOQ polymorphisms, and the aggressiveness of prostate cancer in men with overweight or obesity.\n\nCultural and social determinants of health among indigenous Mexican migrants in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Junghee; Donlan, William; Cardoso, Edgar Ezequiel Orea; Paz, Juan Jesus\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDespite growing numbers, indigenous Mexican migrants are relatively invisible to health practitioners who group them with nonindigenous, mestizo Mexican-origin populations. Associations between indigenous and mestizo cultural identifications with psychosocial characteristics and health indicators among indigenous Mexican migrants were examined. Results revealed gender differences in cultural identifications, perceived discrimination, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and various health indicators including depression severity, culture-bound syndromes, and self-rated health. Multivariate regression and structural equation path modeling demonstrated how indigenous cultural identification and perceived discrimination affects health. Findings suggest that interventions should utilize indigenous community-based activities designed to promote self-esteem and the value of indigenous culture, with a focus on females.\n\nEvaluation of forensic and anthropological potential of D9S1120 in Mestizos and Amerindian populations from Mexico\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRangel-Villalobos, HÃ©ctor; SÃ¡nchez-GutiÃ©rrez, Viviana M; Botello-Ruiz, Miriam; Salazar-Flores, Joel; MartÃ­nez-CortÃ©s, Gabriela; MuÃ±oz-Valle, JosÃ© F; Phillips, Christopher\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAim To carry out a deeper forensic and anthropological evaluation of the short tandem repeat (STR) D9S1120 in five Mestizo populations and eight Amerindian groups from Mexico. Methods We amplified the STR D9S1120 based on primers and conditions described by Phillips et al, followed by capillary electrophoresis in the genetic analyzer ABI Prism 310. Genotypes were analyzed with the GeneMapper ID software. In each population we estimated statistical parameters of forensic importance and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Heterozygosity and FST-values were compared with those previously obtained with nine STRs of the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS-STRs). Results Amerindian and Mestizo populations showed high frequencies of the allele 9 and 16, respectively. Population structure analysis (AMOVA) showed a significant differentiation between Amerindian groups (FSTâ=â2.81%; Pâ<â0.0001), larger than between Mestizos (FSTâ=â0.44%; Pâ=â0.187). D9S1120 showed less genetic diversity but better population differentiation estimates than CODIS-STRs between Amerindian groups and between Amerindians and Mestizos, but not between Mestizo groups. Conclusion This study evaluated the ability of D9S1120 to be used for human identification purposes and demonstrated its anthropological potential to differentiate Mestizos and Amerindian populations.

Folate deficiency has been related to several conditions, including neural tube defects (NTDs) and cardiovascular diseases. Hence, MTHFR genetic variants have been studied worldwide, particularly the C677T and A1298C. We genotyped the C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms in Mexican Amerindians (MAs), from the largest sample included in a genetic study (n = 2026, from 62 ethnic groups), and in a geographically-matched Mexican Mestizo population (MEZ, n = 638). The 677T allele was most frequent in Mexican individuals, particularly in MAs. The frequency of this allele in both MAs and MEZs was clearly enriched in the South region of the country, followed by the Central East and South East regions. In contrast, the frequency of the 1298C risk allele in Mexicans was one of the lowest in the world. Both in MAs and MEZs the variants 677T and 1298C displayed opposite allele frequency gradients from southern to northern Mexico. Our findings suggest that in Mestizos the 677T allele was derived from Amerindians while the 1298C allele was a European contribution. Some subgroups showed an allele frequency distribution that highlighted their genetic diversity. Notably, the distribution of the frequency of the 677T allele was consistent with that of the high incidence of NTDs reported in MEZ.

In Latin America, the frequencies of this trait have been shown to vary according to the degree of admixture of the populations. The objective of this study is to better understand the relationship between this genetic trait and dairy intake in a multiethnic context through a synthesis of studies conducted in four regions of Chile. Genotypes frequencies for the SNP LCT-13910C>T (rs4988235) and frequency of dairy consumption were obtained from four populations: Polynesians from Easter Island (Rapanui); Amerindians (Mapuche) and Mestizos from the AraucanÃ­a region; urban Mestizos from Santiago; and rural Mestizos from the Coquimbo region. Genetic differentiation and association between milk consumption and genotype frequencies were estimated. Genetic differentiation between Native and Mestizo populations was significant; the LP frequency in Mapuche and Rapanui was 10% and 25%, respectively, whereas among the Mestizos, LP frequency was near 40%. Dairy intake was below the nutritional recommendations for the four groups, and extremely below recommendations among the indigenous populations. Association between milk intake and LP was found in Santiago and Rapanui populations. Although the frequency of LP varies among the populations according to their degree of admixture, dairy consumption was very low across the populations. Given that the association between milk consumption and expected phenotype was found only in two of the populations analyzed, it seems that lactase non-persistence (LNP) is not the only cause for dairy avoidance. Thus, it is suggested that SES and cultural preferences are likely affecting dairy consumption.

This variability shows differences among human populations. The aim of this study was to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to a poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype in nonpreviously studied Amerindian groups and Mestizos (general admixed population) from Mexico. Methods: We detected by SNaPshotÂ® different polymorphisms located in CYP2D6 (*3, *4, *6, *7, and *8) and CYP2C19 (*2, *3, *4 and *5) in western Mestizos (n=145) and five Amerindian groups from Mexico: Tarahumaras from the North (n=88); PurÃ©pechas from the Center (n=101); and Tojolabales (n=68), Tzotziles (n=88), and Tzeltales (n=20) from the Southeast. Genotypes were observed by capillary electrophoresis. The genetic relationships among these populations were estimated based on these genes. Results and Discussion: The wild-type allele (*1) of both genes was predominant in the Mexican populations studied. The most widely observed alleles were CYP2C19*2 (range, 0%â31%) and CYP2D6*4 (range, 1.2%â7.3%), whereas CYP2D6*3 was exclusively detected in Mestizos. Conversely, CYP2C19*4 and *5, as well as CYP2D6*3, *6, *7, and *8, were not observed in the majority of the Mexican populations. The Tarahumaras presented a high frequency of the allele CYP2C19*2 (31%) and of homozygotes *2/*2 (10.7%), which represent a high frequency of potentially PM phenotypes in this Amerindian group. The genetic distances showed high differentiation of Tarahumaras (principally for CYP2C19 gene). In general, a relative proximity was observed between most of the Amerindian, Mexican-Mestizo, and Latin-American populations. Conclusion: In general, the wild-type allele (*1) predominates in Mexican populations, outlining a relatively homogeneous distribution for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. The exception is the Tarahumara group that displays a\n\nInsulin resistance and Î²-cell function in Colombian mestizo and Embera-ChamÃ­ populations and their relation with adiposity degree.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaro-Gomez, MarÃ­a Antonieta; Naranjo-GonzÃ¡lez, AndrÃ©s; Parra-MarÃ­n, MarÃ­a Victoria; Gallego-Lopera, Natalia; Valencia, Diana MarÃ­a; RÃºa-Molina, Diana Carolina; Rosique-Gracia, Javier; GarcÃ­a-Pineda, Andres Felipe; GÃ³mez-Isaza, Luis Felipe; Pizano-RamÃ­rez, Norman Diego; Arcos, Edgar Gerardo; Villegas-Perrasse, Alberto; Duque-Botero, Julieta; Bedoya-BerrÃ­o, Gabriel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nInsulin resistance (IR) is a condition favored by metabolic and endocrine changes experienced by adipose tissue in the context of obesity. The prevalence and the presentation of both IR and obesity vary among the populations, and may be affected by ancestral genetic composition among other factors. The aim of this study was to compare the presence of IR and obesity in Amerindians of the Embera-ChamÃ­ ethnicity and Colombian mestizo population. A sample of 630 individuals, 471 mestizos and 159 Amerindians of the Embera-ChamÃ­ ethnicity, from the general population of Colombia were studied. For each participant, anthropometric and biochemical measurements, as well as blood pressure and the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) of IR and Î²-cell function (%B) were recorded. These values were compared between the two populations. While prevalence of central obesity was similar in both populations (48.7% and 42.6% in the mestizo and Embera groups respectively; p=0.148), body mass index (BMI) values suggested a higher prevalence of overweight in the Embera than in mestizo population (43.4% Embera, 31.8% mestizo; p=0.027). Despite the similarities in the prevalence of HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B status between both populations, the Embera population had a significantly greater pancreatic Î²-cell function, higher insulin levels, and better glucose control, across BMI and central obesity categories, than the mestizo population. There are differences in aspects related to energy metabolism between the samples of the mestizo and Amerindian populations analyzed. Copyright Â© 2017 SEEN. Publicado por Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

Three hundred and twenty postmenopausal women participated, who were classified according to World Health Organization criteria as non-osteoporotic (Non-OP; N = 88), osteopenic (Opn; N = 144), and osteoporotic (OP; N = 88). BMD measurements at the lumbar (L1-L4) spine and at the left and right femoral neck were obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan probes. Genotype and allelic frequencies of the 4 VDR SNPs were similar among the 3 groups. Polymorphic allele frequencies were as follows: FokI (C) 0.53, 0.49, 0.56; BsmI (A) 0.26, 0.22, 0.23; ApaI (T) 0.43, 0.39, 0.44; TaqI (C) 0.27, 0.22, 0.23 for the Non-OP, Opn, and OP groups, respectively. Although no associations were found between the SNPs and BMD, based on the putative function of the FokI SNP, we constructed, for the first time, the haplotype with the 4 VDR SNPs, and found that the CGGT haplotype differed between the Non- OP and OP groups (21.8 vs 31.8%, P < 0.05). The risk analysis for this haplotype was nearly significant under the dominant model (OR = 1.783, 95%CI = 0.98-3.25, P = 0.058). This result suggests a possible susceptibility effect of the C allele of the FokI SNP for the development of osteoporosis in postmenopausal Mexican-Mestizo women.\n\n[Polymorphism g.37190613 G>A of the ELMO1 gene in the Mexican population: potential marker for clinical-surgical pathology].\n\nPubMed\n\nTopete-GonzÃ¡lez, Luz Rosalba; Ramirez-Garcia, Sergio Alberto; Charles-NiÃ±o, Claudia; Villa-Ruano, Nemesio; Mosso-GonzÃ¡lez, Clemente; DÃ¡valos-RodrÃ­guez, Nory Omayra\n\n2014-01-01\n\nELMO1 is a gene located at locus 7p14.2-14.1 that codifies a regulatory protein involved in fibrogenesis, cell migration, phagocytosis and apoptosis. This gene presents a single nucleotide polymorphism, which appears to be linked with the development of diabetic nephropathy. Currently, there are no studies in regard to the presence of such polymorphism in the Mexican population. Therefore, the aim of this work was to estimate the frequency rate of alleles and genotypes of polymorphism rs1345365 from ELMO1 in Mexican mestizos who inhabit the west and the southeast regions of Mexico in order to generate reliable data for further association studies. There were 322 individuals who were screened for the identification of polymorphism rs1345365 using genomic DNA from leucocytes as a template for PCR-PASA reactions. Amplicons were separated in 7% PAGE and visualized after staining with silver nitrate. The reference allele (A) was the most frequent in both western and southeastern populations of Mexico. In addition, a different genotype distribution was found with respect to other populations. The results of this study indicate that both populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This study also reveals a low frequency rate of the ancestral genotype for the polymorphism rs1345365 in mestizos from the western and southeastern regions of Mexico.\n\nAnalysis of Polymorphisms in Genes (AGT, MTHFR, GPIIIa, and GSTP1) Associated with Hypertension, Thrombophilia and Oxidative Stress in Mestizo and Amerindian Populations of MÃ©xico\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJuÃ¡rez-VelÃ¡zquez, Rocio; Canto, Patricia; Canto-Cetina, Thelma; Rangel-Villalobos, Hector; Rosas-Vargas, Haydee; RodrÃ­guez, Maricela; Canizales-Quinteros, Samuel; VelÃ¡zquez Wong, Ana Claudia; OrdoÃ±ez-Razo, Rosa MarÃ­a; Vilchis-Dorantes, Guadalupe; Coral-VÃ¡zquez, RamÃ³n Mauricio\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSeveral polymorphisms related to hypertension, thrombophilia, and oxidative stress has been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. We analyzed the frequency of M235T angiotensinogen (AGT), A222V 5,10 methylenete-trahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), L33P glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa), and I105V glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) polymorphisms in 285 individuals belonging to Mexican-Mestizo and five Amerindian population from MÃ©xico, by real time PCR allelic discrimination. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared using Ï2 tests. All populations followed the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for assay markers with the exception of the Triki, whose were in Hardy Weinberg dysequilibrium for the glutathione S-transferase P1 polymorphism. Interestingly, according to all the analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the Triki population was the most differentiated and homogeneous group of the six populations analyzed. A comparison of our data with those previously published for some Caucasian, Asian and Black populations showed quite significant differences. These differences were remarkable with all the Mexican populations having a lower frequency of the 105V allele of the glutathione S-transferase P1 and reduced occurrence of the 222A allele of the 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Our results show the genetic diversity among different Mexican populations and with other racial groups.

The frequency of the sickle-cell trait was 12.8%, which may represent a public health problem. The frequencies of the beta-haplotypes were determined from 350 nonrelated chromosomes (313 beta(A) and 37 beta(S)). We observed 15 different beta(A) haplotypes, the most common of which were haplotypes 1 (48.9%), 2 (13.4%), and 3 (13.4%). The calculation of pairwise distributions and Nei's genetic distance analysis using 32 worldwide populations showed that the beta(A) genes are more closely related to those of Mexican Mestizos and North Africans. Bantu and Benin haplotypes and haplotype 9 were related to the beta(S) genes, with frequencies of 78.8, 18.2, and 3.0%, respectively. Comparison of these haplotypes with 17 other populations revealed a high similitude with the population of the Central African Republic. These data suggest distinct origins for the beta(A) and beta(S) genes in Mexican individuals from the Costa Chica region.\n\nLactase persistence and dairy intake in Mapuche and Mestizo populations from southern Chile.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernÃ¡ndez, Catalina I; Flores, Sergio V\n\n2014-11-01\n\nLactase persistence (LP) occurs at a very low frequency in indigenous populations from Latin America, offering an opportunity to understand the relationship between this genetic trait and patterns of dairy consumption. Here, the frequency of LP is analyzed from Mapuche and -an adjacent- mestizo population inhabiting the AraucanÃ­a region. In addition to genotyping for LP, participants were surveyed in relation to general perception and consumption habits of dairy products. Low LP frequency (10%) and very low dairy intake was found among the Mapuche population as compared with Mestizo populations inhabiting Chile. The survey reported that the main reasons for avoidance of dairy were the gastrointestinal symptoms after dairy intake and cultural dietary habits. The interaction between low LP genotype frequency, low dairy intake, and sociocultural determinants is here discussed in the light of their potential health outcomes.

Mestizo Mexicans have a 70% Native Amerindian genetic background. The T130I polymorphism in the HNF4A gene has been associated with early-onset T2D in mestizo Mexicans. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency and relationship of the T130I variant in the HNF4A gene with risk factors for developing T2D in eleven indigenous groups from Mexico. In two groups, all exons of the HNF4A gene were directly sequenced; in the remaining the T130I polymorphism was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Ancestry informative markers were assessed to confirm the Amerindian component. An additional analysis of EHH was carried out. Interestingly, HNF4A gene screening revealed only the presence of the T130I polymorphism. The range frequency of the risk allele (T) in the indigenous groups was from 2.7 to 16%. Genotypic frequencies (T130I/I130I) were higher and significantly different from those of all of the populations included in the HapMap Project (PÂ <Â 0.005). EHH scores suggest a positive selection for T130I polymorphism. Metabolic traits indicate a relationship between the T130I/I130I genotypes with high triglyceride concentrations in the indigenous groups (PÂ <Â 0.005). These results strongly suggest that the high frequency of the T130I polymorphism and its biological relationship with dysfunction in lipid metabolism in Mexican indigenous groups is a risk factor for the developing of T2D in Mexicans.\n\nForensic-paternity effectiveness and genetics population analysis of six non-CODIS mini-STR loci (D1S1656, D2S441, D6S1043, D10S1248, D12S391, D22S1045) and SE33 in Mestizo and Amerindian populations from Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurguete-Argueta, Nelsi; MartÃ­nez De la Cruz, Braulio; Camacho-Mejorado, Rafael; Santana, Carla; Noris, Gino; LÃ³pez-Bayghen, Esther; Arellano-Galindo, JosÃ©; Majluf-Cruz, Abraham; Antonio Meraz-RÃ­os, Marco; GÃ³mez, RocÃ­o\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSTRs are powerful tools intensively used in forensic and kinship studies. In order to assess the effectiveness of non-CODIS genetic markers in forensic and paternity tests, the genetic composition of six mini short tandem repeats-mini-STRs-(D1S1656, D2S441, D6S1043, D10S1248, D12S391, D22S1045) and the microsatellite SE33 in Mestizo and Amerindian populations from Mexico were studied. Using multiplex polymerase chain reactions and capillary electrophoresis, this study genotyped all loci from 870 chromosomes and evaluated the statistical genetic parameters. All mini-STRs studied were in agreement with HW and linkage equilibrium; however, an important HW departure for SE33 was found in the Mestizo population (p â¤ 0.0001). Regarding paternity and forensic statistical parameters, high values of combined power discrimination and mean power of exclusion were found using these seven markers. The principal co-ordinate analysis based on allele frequencies of three mini-STRs showed the complex genetic architecture of the Mestizo population. The results indicate that this set of loci is suitable to genetically identify individuals in the Mexican population, supporting its effectiveness in human identification casework. In addition, these findings add new statistical values and emphasise the importance of the use of non-CODIS markers in complex populations in order to avoid erroneous assumptions.\n\nHLA Alleles are Genetic Markers for Susceptibility and Resistance towards Leprosy in a Mexican Mestizo Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nAguilar-Medina, Maribel; Escamilla-Tilch, Monica; FrÃ­as-Castro, Luis Octavio; Romero-Quintana, Geovanni; Estrada-GarcÃ­a, Iris; Estrada-Parra, Sergio; Granados, Julio; Arambula Meraz, Eliakym; SÃ¡nchez-Schmitz, Guzman; Khader, Shabaana Abdul; Rangel-Moreno, Javier; Ramos-PayÃ¡n, RosalÃ­o\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDespite the use of multidrug therapy, leprosy remains endemic in some countries. The association of several human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and gene polymorphisms with leprosy has been demonstrated in many populations, but the major immune contributors associated to the spectrum of leprosy have not been defined yet. In this study, genotyping of HLA-A, -B, -DR, and -DQ alleles was performed in leprosy patients (n = 113) and controlÂ subjects (n = 117) from the region with the highest incidence for the disease in MÃ©xico. The odds of developing leprosy and lepromatous subtype were 2.12- and 2.74-fold higher in carriers of HLA-A*28, and 2.48- and 4.14-fold higher for leprosy and dimorphic subtype in carriers of DQB1*06. Interestingly, DQB1*07 was overrepresented in healthy individuals, compared to patients with leprosy (OR = 0.08) and the lepromatous subtype (OR = 0.06). These results suggest that HLA-A*28 is a marker for predisposition to leprosy and the lepromatous subtype and DQB1*06 to leprosy and the dimorphic subtype, while DQB1*07 might be a resistance marker in this Mestizo population.

Mexicoâs population is comprised of Amerindians (AM) and Mestizos who have variable AM, European (EUR) and African genetic ancestry and an increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases. Nutritional advice based on the Mexican genome and the traditional food culture is needed to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we aimed to provide a prevalence profile of several DRAG polymorphisms in the Mexican population, including Central West (CW) Mexico subpopulations. Geographic heat maps were built using ArcGIS10 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) software, based on the published data of the MTHFR C677T (rs1801133), ABCA1 Arg230Cys (rs9282541), APOE T388C (rs429358)/C526T (rs7412), LCT C-13910T (rs4988235) polymorphisms and AMY1 copy number variation (CNV). Also, new data obtained by allelic discrimination-real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the MTHFR, ABCA1, and APOE polymorphisms as well as the AMY1 CNV in the CW Mexico subpopulations with different proportions of AM and EUR ancestry were included. In the CW region, the highest frequency of the MTHFR 677T, ABCA1 230C and APOE Îµ4 adaptive alleles was observed in the AM groups, followed by Mestizos with intermediate AM ancestry. The LCT-13910T allele frequency was highest in Mestizos-EUR but extremely low in AM, while the AMY1 diploid copy number was 6.82 Â± 3.3 copies. Overall, the heat maps showed a heterogeneous distribution of the DRAG polymorphisms, in which the AM groups revealed the highest frequencies of the adaptive alleles followed by Mestizos. Given these genetic differences, genome-based nutritional advice should be tailored in a regionalized and individualized manner according to the available foods and Mexican traditional food culture that may lead\n\nMetabolic effects of the contraceptive skin patch and subdermal contraceptive implant in Mexican women: A prospective study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground The contraceptive skin patch (CSP) accepted by the U.S. FDA in 2001 includes ethinylestradiol and norelgestromine, whereas the subdermal contraceptive implant (SCI) has etonogestrel and is also approved by the FDA. In Mexico, both are now widely used for contraception but their effects on Mexican population are unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate if these treatments induce metabolic changes in a sample of indigenous and mestizo Mexican women. Methods An observational, prospective, longitudinal, non-randomized study of women between 18 and 35Â years of age assigned to CSP or SCI. We performed several laboratory tests: clinical chemistry, lipid profile, and liver and thyroid function tests. Also, serum levels of insulin, C-peptide, IGF-1, leptin, adiponectin, and C reactive protein were assayed. Results Sixty-two women were enrolled, 25 used CSP (0 indigenous; 25 mestizos) and 37 used SCI (18 indigenous; 19 mestizos). Clinical symptoms were relatively more frequent in the SCI group. Thirty-four contraceptive users gained weight without other clinical significant changes. After 4Â months of treatment, significant changes were found in some biochemical parameters in both treatment groups. Most were clinically irrelevant. Interestingly, the percentage of users with an abnormal atherogenic index diminished from 75% to 41.6% after follow-up. Conclusions The CSP slightly modified the metabolic variables. Most changes were nonsignificant, whereas for SCI users changes were more evident and perhaps beneficial. Results of this attempt to evaluate the effects of contraceptives in mestizo and native-American populations show that clinical symptoms are frequent in Mexican users of CSP and SCI. Although these medications may affect some metabolic variables, these changes seem clinically irrelevant. Induction of abnormalities in other physiological pathways cannot be ruled out.

Among the indigenous populations, the highest gene frequencies for O and D were 0.9703 and 1.000 for Zitlala (State of Guerrero) and 0.9955 and 0.9414 for Tzeltales (State of Chiapas), respectively. Maximum likelihood estimates of admixture components yield a trihybrid model with Amerindian (assuming that Nahua-Zitlala is the most representative indigenous population), Spanish, and African ancestry with the admixture proportions: 93.03, 6.03, and 0.94 for Tzeltales, and 28.99, 44.03, and 26.98 for Coyolillo. A contribution of the ancestral populations of Ixhuatlancillo, Actopan, Ixmiquilpan, Milpa-Alta, and Xochimilco were found with the following average of admixture proportions: 75.84, 22.50, and 1.66. The findings herein demonstrate that the genetic admixture of the Mexican indigenous populations who at present speak the same Amer-Indian language can be differentiated and that the majority of them have less ancestral indigenous contribution than those considered as Mestizo populations.\n\nPREVALENCE OF METABOLIC SYNDROME IN YOUNG MEXICANS: A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON ITS COMPONENTS.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurguÃ­a-Romero, Miguel; JimÃ©nez-Flores, J Rafael; Sigrist-Flores, Santiago C; Tapia-Pancardo, Diana C; JimÃ©nez-Ramos, Arnulfo; MÃ©ndez-Cruz, A RenÃ©; Villalobos-Molina, Rafael\n\n2015-07-28\n\nobesity is a worldwide epidemic, and the high prevalence of diabetes type II (DM2) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is in great part a consequence of that epidemic. Metabolic syndrome is a useful tool to estimate the risk of a young population to evolve to DM2 and CVD. to estimate the MetS prevalence in young Mexicans, and to evaluate each parameter as an independent indicator through a sensitivity analysis. the prevalence of MetS was estimated in 6 063 young of the MÃ©xico City metropolitan area. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the performance of each one of the components of MetS, as an indicator of the presence of MetS itself. Five statistical of the sensitivity analysis were calculated for each MetS component and the other parameters included: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value or precision, negative predictive value, and accuracy. the prevalence of MetS in Mexican young population was estimated to be 13.4%. Waist circumference presented the highest sensitivity (96.8% women; 90.0% men), blood pressure presented the highest specificity for women (97.7%) and glucose for men (91.0%). When all the five statistical are considered triglycerides is the component with the highest values, showing a value of 75% or more in four of them. Differences by sex are detected for averages of all components of MetS in young without alterations. Mexican young are highly prone to acquire MetS: 71% have at least one and up to five MetS parameters altered, and 13.4% of them have MetS. From all the five components of MetS, waist circumference presented the highest sensitivity as a predictor of MetS, and triglycerides is the best parameter if a single factor is to be taken as sole predictor of MetS in Mexican young population, triglycerides is also the parameter with the highest accuracy.

LP has been associated with obesity in Europeans. However, it has not been genetically evaluated in Mexico, a country with admixed population, recent introduction of dairy, and a high prevalence of obesity. Thus, we aimed to determine the distribution of the LCT polymorphisms and their association with the nutritional profile of West Mexico's populations. Genotyping of 1,196 individuals (natives and mestizos) was carried out by a Taqman allelic discrimination assay. Descriptive statistics and interpopulation analyzes were performed by SPSS, Arlequin, and Structure software. Demographic, anthropometric, biochemical and dietary data were analyzed in "
