Sydney Fowler Wright was a British editor, poet, science fiction author, writer of screenplays, mystery fiction and works in other genres, as well as being an accountant and a conservative political activist.

Wright began writing science fiction in the 1920s. The book Science-Fiction: The Early Years describes Wright as “the major British writer of genre science fiction between Wells and the moderns”. In 1934, Wright visited Germany to write a series of newspaper articles. Alarmed at what he saw, he wrote three novels about a future war in Europe: Prelude in Prague: The War of 1938, Four Days’ War, and Mediggo’s Ridge.
