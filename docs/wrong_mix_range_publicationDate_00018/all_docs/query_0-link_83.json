        "text": "Debbie ([email protected]) The Wish-Maker by Ali Sethi Rating: 4 Stars This is an interesting story of an extended family of the grand \"dame\" and her sister, children, servants, and grandchildren. Is Daadi the Wish-maker? Her ideas, thoughts, and actions influence everyone. The story starts out slowly on the eve of a wedding. The format of the writing is comparable to a mystery---who is the bride and who is the groom? Before the mystery uncovers, Ali Sethi reveals the life in Pakistan during a 30-50 year span. His language is both bitter and sweet, but the use of Urdu words with no translation is cumbersome. The story is told through the eyes of Zaki, the youngest male of the family. But the dominant theme is that of the female, who secretly controls power. The men all seem to be minor figures, even though the Muslim world is governed by men. The story shows that Americans tend to \"take for granted\" their democracy and ordered existence. Sethi skirts the brutal horrors of internal strife in Pakistan, and only shows a small glimpse, as when Zaki's mother is arrested for an article she wrote. I cannot understand how children are given so much freedom to do as they wish. An excellent book exposing a different type of life. I again enjoyed the cycle effect of the story, starting with the wedding and ending with the wedding; and the discovery of the world in'between.\n\nLinda M. Johnson ([email protected]) The Jane Austen Book Club by Karen Joy Fowler Rating: 3 Stars I listened to this book and think I should go back and actually read it. The book documents five members of a group who meet to discuss each of Jane Austen's books. The group does include 3 friends, one's lesbian daughter, and a male acquaintance of the leader --- which has all wondering, \"Who is he to be matched up with?\" Ã  la Austen. I will read this after I finish reading Austen's books. I have only read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, which is a favorite, but I want to be fully informed in able to write and understand this book fully.\n\nLinda M. Johnson ([email protected]) Send Yourself Roses by Kathleen Turner Rating: 2 Stars I saw Ms. Turner interviewed when the book came out about a year ago and thought this would be an interesting read. It was, but not the way I thought. It is mostly well-written (I don't understand how someone gets paid to say things like \"between Gail and I\"). I did not know Turner had such a cosmopolitan childhood. I hadn't realized she had been on the soap \"The Doctors\" for such a short period of time (where I first remember her). I didn't realize her language would be so \"earthy\". It was interesting, but I quickly tired of the \"me, myself, and I-ness\" of the quick read. She does have self-esteem to share.\n\nHeather ([email protected]) Crazy for the Storm by Norman Ollestad Rating: 5 Stars This book was extremely well written and I loved how he entwined the crash details with his childhood and how he became the person he is today. An extremely great book.\n\nMarty One Thousand White Women by Jim Fergus Rating: 4 Stars This historical fiction is an interesting and quick read. There are some rather graphic sections, so not for the faint of heart.\n\nAngela Satalino Flying Changes by Sara Gruen Rating: 4 Stars Ms. Gruen's writing is very compelling. I didn't think I'd like reading about horses, but that's only incidental. The characters are wonderful.\n\nGenie The Witch's Tongue by James D. Doss Rating: 5 Stars James D. Doss' Charlie Moon series. THE WITCH'S TONGUE blends a complex plot with a touch of humor. Set in southern Colorado, this is the ninth novel of the Ute tribal investigator Charlie Moon series. Charlie is a semi-retired investigator in the Ute Tribal Police Department and a successful rancher. Seems like an unusually large number of crimes have occurred on Ute territory. Initially these crimes seemed to be unrelated, however, it soon becomes obvious to Charlie that the incidents are related; the theft of rare gold coins from a family museum, Charlie and his poker buddy/antique dealer (Ralph Briggs) are attacked in the antique shop, an Apache involved in a traffic stop attacks the arresting police officer, and Jake Gourd Rattle abandons his wife and disappears into mysterious Spirit Canyon. At first the relationship between incidents are a puzzle to both the tribal police and the FBI. By the end of the novel, the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place. Of course Charlie's feisty aunt, Daisy Perika, a shaman who manages to blend Ute beliefs with Catholicism plays an important role in this complex tale. New on the scene is FBI agent Lila Mae McTeague who quickly becomes Charlie's new romantic interest. This is an entertaining, quick read. Parts are laugh out loud funny.\n\nLynn Clifford The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes by Diane Chamberlain Rating: 4 Stars Our group just finished reading THE SECRET LIFE OF CEECEE WILKES by Diane Chamberlain. The book was definitely a page-turner, as we constantly wondered what CeeCee was going to do next. In the beginning of the story, CeeCee --- a vulnerable young girl of 16 --- is wooed by an older man who eventually convinces her to aid him in a kidnapping plot that ultimately leads to the death of the governor's pregnant wife. As CeeCee evades the law and begins a new, normal life, complications arise.\n\nMindy ([email protected]) Inkspell by Cornelia Funke Rating: 5 Stars Follow up to INKHEART, which was great. This promises to be just as great.\n\nT. Thomas The School of Essential Ingredients by Erica Bauermeister Rating: 5 Stars Wonderful book! This is a quiet book, one you want to keep reading; but not one that takes you on a roller coaster ride.\n\nSusan ([email protected]) Who By Fire by Diana Spechler Rating: 4 Stars I particularly did not like the book after I finished it. But then I realized that what really did grab me was not the story itself, but the character development, which was great. I really got to know the family. The sister, Bits was a sex addict; her brother Ash, was a religious fanatic; the mother was full of guilt and makes her children feel that guilt as well. The father, who is not with them after their sister is kidnapped, is a neglegient boob. I may not have cared much for the plot, but I did care about the characters. If the book had neither a great story nor interesting characters I would have given it maybe on star. But the characters arereally what drew me to the story.\n\nTerri Loeffler ([email protected]) The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows Rating: 5 Stars This was probably one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. Told in letters, it's the story of a young woman who is contacted by the eventual owner of one of her books. She begins a correspondence with him and other residents of the island of Guernsey who survived WWII and are rebuilding their lives. The characters' personalities are so well drawn that by the end of the book, you believe they are real persons and want to travel over to meet them! The harsh incidents from the war are included and not glossed over, but the characters accept them and carry on in spite of them. An absolutely lovely book.\n\nCrystal Death of a Prankster by M. C. Beaton Rating: 5 Stars The seventh book in the Hamish Macbeth Mysteries series. Excellent mystery with hilarious characters.\n\nMarsha M Angels and Ages by Adam Gopnik author profile Rating: 4 Stars I would like to give this parallel biography of these two great men born on the exact same day an ocean apart 4.5 stars. In a narrative much like a story but filled with an insight only possible 200 years later, the author demonstrates how each was a precursor to more modern ways of thinking during the Victorian age of florid speeches and classical references.\n\nEach ushered in the modern point of view in both politics and law (Lincoln) and scientific investigation and classification (Darwin). I found especialy interesting the authors view that Lincoln's insistance on following the law and legal procedure put him on a colision course with the South whose romantic interperation of \"honor\" led at best to duels and at worst at lynchings. Equally interesting was Gopnik's demonstration of how seemingly effortless was Darwins ability to describe in depth and with accuracy the thousands of specimens he drew and catalogued creating a body of evidence to strongly support his hypothesis.\n\nIf you like biography coupled with philosophic insight this book is for you.\n\nKristie Ellie's People (series) by Mary Christner Borntrager Rating: 3 Stars Another Amish fiction series. It's very simple, easy and quick to read. My library has it in the Young Adult section. The order of two of the books in the series was rather confusing, but it was O.K. overall.\n\nJudy The Help by Kathryn Stockett Rating: 5 Stars I had read nothing but glowing reviews about this book from other readers. It wasn't always easy reading, but I was entranced throughout. I didn't live in Mississippi until the 80s so it wasn't like this (thank God), but there was still some underlying racism just below the surface. You come to like and dislike, maybe even understand a little of the different characters in this southern town during this turbulent time.\n\nA new college-grad, Skeeter, returns home in 1962 to find her beloved maid, Constantine, has left and no one wants to talk about it. Aibileen is a wise, wonderful black woman who is raising her 17th white child. Minny is a sassy woman with a penchant for cooking and a take-no-prisoners attitude. These three women meet secretly for a project that will change everyone's life, but the changes may not be what they expect.\n\nKristie Evergreen by Belva Plain Rating: 3 Stars Not her best work. Of course, this was her first published novel. Seems to drag quite a bit. This definitely earns the name \"family saga.\"\n\nKristie Dumbing Us Down by John Taylor Gatto Rating: 5 Stars About the hidden curriculum of compulsory schooling. Written by an award-winning teacher, this philosophy and ideas are definitely food for thought. Should be required reading for parents and teachers.\n\nMarsha M Beat The Reaper by Josh Bazell Rating: 4 Stars A funny, irreverent thriller where things are mostly not what they seem. We are introduced to Dr. Peter Brown, older intern working in one of the City's worst hospitals. As if being an intern in this woeful place is not enough, Peter struggles with a violent past which may be catching up with him. This is the story of how he tries to keep both his patients and himself alive.\n\nA fun and easy reading book.\n\nMarsha Gold of Kings by Davis Bunn Rating: 3 Stars This is a very ambitious book. It details a search for the Second Temple treasures and the art dealer who trades in these items. It is chock full of historical facts regarding Crete, treasure hunting, federal and Interpol investigators and much, much more.\n\nLeslie The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera Rating: 2 Stars I'm not sure I am understanding this one, but trying. I know it was quite popular; it may not be my cup of tea.\n\nCindy in CA The Help by Kathryn Stockett Rating: 5 Stars Bookreporter.com randomly selected me to win this book. I loved it! The story takes places in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s --- yes, during the civil rights movement. Skeeter, twenty-two, is home from graduating college and is disappointed that Constantine, her family's maid and the woman who raised her, has disappeared. Skeeter, who becomes disassociated from her white girlfriends, sets out to secretly write a book about the stories of the black maids in town. The stories are both \"good\" and \"bad\" and it is very risky for the women to meet.\n\nBrady ([email protected]) Bill Mauldin: A Life Up Front by Todd DePastino Rating: 4 Stars This is a biography of Bill Mauldin, but also the story of World War II in Italy. Mr. Mauldin was most influential during those times and this is the story of his life from a poor farm boy to an acclaimed artist and WWII veteran. It is a most interesting story told of those times.\n\nShirley Smith ([email protected]) Shanghai Girls by Lisa See Rating: 5 Stars I was first on the list at the library. I have followed Lisa See since SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN, and now I know things about China during a different time. It was still not the best place for an average looking girl with intelligence.\n\nDiane Cemetery Dance by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child Rating: 4 Stars You have a murdered journalist, an archaeologist wife, a cop who is a friend of the murdered man and the always interesting Mr. Pendergast.\n\nIs the Murderer dead as shown by all the evidence, or is he a zombie? Bet you can't wait to find out....\n\nDiane First Family by David Baldacci Rating: 4 Stars I loved the book; it kept me interested from the first page. Lots of twist and turns and the characters are interesting. I enjoy this author a lot. The reason behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter was different and the ending was unexpected.\n\nCarol M. Little Pink House by Jeff Benedict Rating: 4 Stars Susette Kelo fights state government and big business to keep from forfeiting her home through eminent domain. Her battle goes all the way to the Supreme Court ending in a controversial decision. I'm about 100 pages into this book. It's very readable. Benedict has kept me interested.\n\nWendy ([email protected]) Long Lost by Harlan Coben Rating: 5 Stars This is his latest book in the Myron Bolitar series and it is a great read!\n\nNon-stop action and suspense.\n\nDiane Shanghai Girls by Lisa See Rating: 4 Stars Excellent book, great characters and I enjoyed reading about the 2 sisters and how their lives change as they realize they have some control of their lives they are not just useless girl children. Their journey from China to LA is exciting and dangerous.\n\nMarisa A Reliable Wife by Robert Goolrick Rating: 1 Stars WARNING: do not read this book. The only thing reliable about it is how unappealing the characters are. These are some pretty miserable people who thrive on self-destruction and hurting the people they love. It's also pretty repetitive in parts. Just a very unlikable book.\n\nMary Ann The Year of Fog by Michelle Richmond Rating: 4 Stars A very compelling and fairly realistic look at how your life can turn in an instant from what you thought. Tragedies happen, miracles happen, depression and loneliness happen. Life happens. Forgiveness and good intentions don't always change what will.\n\nSusan Wicked Prey by John Sandford Rating: 4 Stars Lucas Davenport's adopted daughter has a large part in this story. The seem like 2 peas in a pod. It will be interesting if she becomes a detective too. I liked her spunk and resourcefulness.\n\nKathy Vallee Who Invited the Dead Man by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars After her husband Joe is injured, MacLaren takes over being the new magistrate of Hope County. So when she finds herself on the wrong side of the law she has to find out who really killed a local man.\n\nT. Thomas Blasphemy by Douglas Preston Rating: 3 Stars Interesting take on religion.\n\nJaye Thanks and Have Fun Running The Country by Jory John (ed) Rating: 5 Stars It's a group of letters written by children in an after school tutoring program --- a quick read, charming, funny and thought provoking.\n\nKathy Vallee Who Let the Killer in the House by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars After the murder of a small girl years earlier, a dark cloud moves over the town of Hopemore. A man was sent to prison. But, after the suicide of one of the town's most beloved citizens, they wonder if they have the right man.\n\nSusan Cooke The Middle Place by Kelly Corrigan Rating: 5 Stars This is a brutally honest memoir of a young mother and daughter caught in that place between being an adult and a child. When tragedy strikes, Kelly takes stock of her life and her relationships and shows us what living and loving is all about. The book is extremely powerful and gut wrenching as we share Kelly's struggles with breast cancer. Kelly Corrigan is an extremely talented writer. This book will make you cry from start to finish and make you feel all the power that women possess.\n\nKathy Vallee Who Left the Body in the Rain by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars The local successful family man who owns a car dealership is found run over by is own car. So once again, Judge MacLaren has to find out who did it, since they are old0time friends.\n\nSusan Cooke The Alienist by Caleb Carr Rating: 4 Stars This was an intriguing book about New York City in the late 1800s. The descriptions of society and the city are wonderfully enlightening. The book centers on the mysterious deaths of several unfortunate children and involves an investigation led by an eccentric \"alienist\", an early psychologist. The characters are absorbing and the story keeps you wondering who is the perpetrator and how will the investigation affect the characters and the city as a whole. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.\n\nGina Eclipse by Stephenie Meyer Rating: 5 Stars Each book is as good as the last in this series. Looking forward to the reading the final installment but will be sad to see it end.\n\nGina New Moon by Stephenie Meyer Rating: 5 Stars Just as good, if not better, than the first novel in the Twilight series. Suspenseful and heart-wrenching.\n\nGina Twilight by Stephenie Meyer Rating: 5 Stars A great love story for any age. I was surprisingly addicted from page one.\n\nLorna Lafond Murder at the Academy Awards by Joan Rivers Rating: 4 Stars I decided to read this book only because I do like Joan Rivers.. I couldn't imagine that she could write a good book but I was pleasingly amazed, I really enjoyed this book. She has created a character, 'Max', (who really is Joan) and just goes with it. It's humorous as well as a good mystery. The whole time I am reading I can just picture Joan Rivers saying everything that Max is saying..This book made me laugh with every page. If you like a good murder mystery as well as the Hollywood scene you won't be disappointed.\n\nConnie Danger In The Shadows by Dee Henderson Rating: 4 Stars This is a great suspense/romance book by a Christian author. Sara is under FBI protection and cannot use her real name anymore. Her home is where the FBI sends her and she cannot stay very long before she is on the move again, trying to stay away from the man out to kill her. When she was 6 years old, she and her twin sister were abducted by this man. He killed her twin sister but she survived. She is now riddled with guilt over this. Sara has a brother, Dave, who is also in the FBI and on her protection team. Sara meets Adam Blach, a high profile figure, and is very attracted to him but cannot risk being seen or photographed with him because she is afraid her killer will find her again. This was a great suspense novel clear to the end.\n\nAmanda's Weekly Zen The Rule of Four by Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason Rating: 5 Stars I have seen many reviews of this book that only give it 3 out of 5 stars, so I have to admit that going into the novel, I did not expect much. In the case of THE RULE OF FOUR, the majority underestimates the novel. Now admittedly, none of the action actually takes place in the novel, but outside it. We never actually see Paul and Tom find the missing art that the Hypnerotomachia hints at. It is an interesting approach to have the action take place outside the novel and most likely would not work in many stories. But, it works here. The language of the novel is fantastic and approachable for many audiences. Perhaps the best thing about this novel is that it at times reads like a thesis on Hypnerotomachia, even going to the lengths of placing photos from the book into the novel that we are reading. As a lit major, I appreciate this aspect and it is the main reason that gave this book a 5 out 5. I prefer a reading of the novel that is at the center of all the scandal as opposed to unbelievable action that THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS are notorious for.\n\nDo not get me wrong --- I am not claiming that there is not an interesting plot or character construction. There is. The plot is just like all the other historical fiction adventure novels out there. People study this one book or time period and all of a sudden find themselves in some sort of adventure trying to discover the secrets that the book holds. The characters are just as round as those found in the same novels. Although I have to say that Tom in the end seems to have more of an epiphany than Robert Langdon at the end of both THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS AND DEMONS.\n\nLaura Ann Adams ([email protected]) The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows Rating: 5 Stars A very interesting and informative book told through a series of letters from one character to the many wonderful and diverse other characters.\n\nJulie H Wings by Aprilynne Pike Rating: 4 Stars Laurel Sewell just moved from the only home she remembers, to a larger town in Northern California. She begins at Del Norte high school after having been home-schooled her whole life. Laurel sticks out a bit in the lunchroom, with her light-as-a-bird, vegan style eating, but soon makes a couple of friends in David and Chelsea. Her father's trying to make a success at his bookstore and her mother is just pleased when Laurel eats or drinks more calories, like a can of Sprite from their stocked fridge. One morning, Laurel wakes up with a strange bump on her back that continues to grow. Eventually, she sprouts a flower of sorts right out of the middle of her back. A visit to her old home near the forest helps explain her heritage. Turns out Laurel was adopted to this family on purpose. She is a plant faerie destined to inherit the land the forest sits on to keep safe the gate to Avalon.\n\nThis is to be a four book series, there are faeries,evil trolls and touches of Arthurian legends about the gates to Avalon. Pike has created a wonderful character in Laurel, and a great three way romantic triangle with her, human David and the faerie Tamani. One wonders if the Stephanie Meyer endorsement will help this be as big a phenomenon as her Twilight series.\n\nKathy Vallee Shoot from the Lip by Leann Sweeney Rating: 4 Stars This is about a woman who put people up for adoption and their birth parents back together, until she gets in way over her head with a producer who wants to capitalize on the whole thing.\n\nGina Fatally Flaky by Diane Mott Davidson Rating: 5 Stars More suspenseful than her past novels and less recipes....I really enjoyed this mystery.\n\nKathy Vallee When Will the Dead Lady Sing? by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars When a Buffalo shows up in Maclaren's front yard, it turns out to be the campaign mascot for Lance Bullock, Mac's old boyfriend --- someone she does not want her husband to know about.\n\nAmanda's Weekly Zen Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer Rating: 2 Stars While readers of the Twilight series can take the third book as a sign of what the fourth book will offer to the reader, this is by far the most disappointing book of the series. The writing is slow and the story really seems to be reaching for anything. When reading this novel, I felt that Meyer was rushing to the end that we all new was coming from the first book but not sure how to actually get there. There are also uncomfortable parts of this novel that I would think should be inappropriate for people under 18 years old. There is much more violence, incest and sex in this novel than the three before them.\n\nThere are some moments of beautiful writing, which seems to surround the character of Jacob and the werewolves in this novel. But it is not enough to pick this book up and read it if you are not reading through the series. I will not give anything away as to plot in this review, well for two reasons if you read any of the books or seen the movie you already know the plot and two there is not much plot to give away. I have to admit though the last chapters of the novel made me laugh out loud, but I am positive that it was not Meyer's intention.\n\nJChild Drink One To Me, Christian Bennett by Vicki Allen Rating: 5 Stars I met Vicki in Destin and she was very nice to sign my book. I have been reading for 2 straight days and have been swept away to another country. I loved the book and have recommended it to all my friends.\n\nMary Branham ([email protected]) The Inn At Eagle Point by Sherryl Woods Rating: 4 Stars I am really enjoying the 1st in this trilogy.\n\nIt is about a family with lots of problems and how they come back to MD to help their sister and daughter open up a bed and breakfast in their home town.\n\nThe parents have been divorced for years and the daughter has dealt with ADD but\n\nthe inn is finished all they all come together for the opening.\n\nKathy Vallee What Are You Wearing to Die by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars After finding a local young woman dead and wearing clothing she never would be caught dead in, Mac wants to find the killer more then anything after she finds out that not only was she killed but her arms, legs, back and skull where broken. Who could do such a terrible crime?\n\nKathy Vallee Guess Who's Coming to Die by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars After being asked to join one of the highest clubs in town, Mac finds the president of the clib dead after the first meeting so Mac is right back to finding out who did it.\n\nKathy Vallee Did You Declare the Corpse by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars When Mac plans a vacation with her husband for a romantic get away, all things go wrong. Not only is she minus her husband, but she end up in chilly Scotland and empty coffins show up, then the American bodies.\n\nKathy Vallee Who Killed The Queen of Clubs by Patricia Sprinkle Rating: 4 Stars The local Bridge champion's husband commits suicide and leaves her totally in debt, along with just his collection of snuff boxes that his will forbids her to sell. But when she ends up dead, all signs point to someone Mac believes is innocent so she has to find out who really did it.\n\nAmanda's Weekly Zen Angels & Demons by Dan Brown Rating: 4 Stars Say what you will about Dan Brown, but the man does write a fantastically thrilling novel. Fans of THE DA VINCI CODE will find that ANGELS & DEMONS is very similar in writing style and plot (really all that changes is the search that Robert Langdon goes on). One of my favorite things about THE DA VINCI CODE was all the talk about the art of Da Vinci. In this novel our artist who hides clues to protect a secret is Botticelli. Again, in the novel readers are given lengthy descriptions of the works of art as we find them pointing to the answer that Robert Langdon seeks. We also are given a look at the possibility of antimatter and some of the science that surrounds it. Many reviewers out there will criticize Brown because his \"facts\" are not all that accurate and his take on religion is always less than favorable. But readers, lets me honest, ANGELS & DEMONS is, after all, a work of fiction. The fact is the novel is at times very thrilling and a page turner. As far as the characters go. well do not expect much depth or insight from the characters. At times they function just to move along the action. But again the book is a fun summer read.\n\nI gave his book 4 out 5 because the ending was strange. I felt that there were two endings to this novel. One concludes the action we were all waiting for a great ending that took me by surprise. The other is one that functions to finish off the relationship between Robert and Vittoria, which was easy to see the first time the two met. Although Brown tries to create sexual tension between the two, really, it is flat and if the second ending were left out of the book completely the book would have received 5 out of 5. All in all, it is a great book for the beach or a rainy summer day.\n\nJuanita The Gurernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows Rating: 5 Stars I feel like I am reading someone's personal letters! It has me hooked! What a story and such a time --- wars always have such a consequence on everyone and this one is very interesting!\n\nAmy Valeria's Last Stand by Mark Fitten Rating: 4 Stars In a small Hungarian village where the local tavern is the social center of town, and everyone knows everyone else's business, lives Valeria --- a brusque, opinionated woman of a certain age who long ago turned her back on love. But Valeria is struck by cupid's arrow and is smitten with the village potter. The thread of life unravels for Valeria, the potter, the mayor, the tavern owner and just about everyone else in town. Reading VALERIA'S LAST STAND is like a fun romp in the hay (so to speak). With interesting characters in a picturesque setting!\n\nKay Prayers for Sale by Sandra Dallas Rating: 5 Stars Hennie Comfort is an 86-year-old mountain woman living in Colorado during the Depression in this wonderful story. She tells stories to her young neighbor throughout the book as she reflects on her life. I found this book hard to put down!!\n\nJessica Saints in Limbo by River Jordan Rating: 3 Stars My initial reaction to this book was simply that it wasn't quite what I expected. Perhaps the book's description should have led me to believe that it would be a magical sort of story --- but instead, it had me expecting some more traditional Southern literature fare. What I found instead was that I was entering a fantastical world --- before even getting to know the characters and buy into the story --- and I admit I had a hard time staying with this book. Despite having read and enjoyed Haruki Murakami and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, magical realism just isn't necessarily my thing.\n\nBut I was very glad I didn't walk away from this book after the slow start. Soon, I was devouring the second half of the story. All in all, I found it to be, in a word, charming. At times predictable and at times painfully sad, this is, underneath it all, a lovely little story of what matters most in life. This novel is in a category all its own, not quite like any other book I've read. And I find that in and of itself refreshing.\n\nPriscilla Case of Exploding Mangoes by Mohammed Hanif Rating: 4 Stars This book reads (for me) as a dark comedy on a true historical event that I had no knowledge of ( the plane of the the Pakistani dictator General Zia and several top generals crashing).\n\nA little difficult to get into, but a very worthwhile and entertaining read.\n\nPriscilla The Memory Keeper's Daughter by Kim Edwards Rating: 3 Stars One of the many books I'm currently reading!\n\nA great story, sad and bittersweet. They've made a movie out of the novel with a great cast, but I want to finish the book before watching the movie.\n\nIt wasn't a novel that's made me stay up all night to finish, but it's a book I can pick up after a few days and remember everything I've read so far.\n\nPriscilla Vigil by Cecilia Samartin Rating: 4 Stars So far, so great!\n\nWritten both in third person (present) and first person (past), it tells of one woman's vigil of her dying husband while remembering the horrors of her past in El Salvador.\n\nSharron A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole Rating: 4 Stars Published posthumously and awarded the Pulitzer, this zany story of characters takes place in New Orleans. (Is this Toole's real life?) It is a book with lots of humor and pathos. A fun read.\n\nSharron Rasputin's Daughter by Robert Alexander Rating: 3 Stars Story of the last days of Rasputin as told by his daughter, Maria. While fiction, it is an Interesting tale based on real events that made me want to delve more into the history of the time.\n\nSharron Sleep Towards Heaven by Amanda Eyre Ward Rating: 5 Stars Great first novel by this author revolving around women on death row and the people who interact with them. It would be a great discussion book.\n\nRebecca Cox The Echo Maker by Richard Powers Rating: 4 Stars When Mark Schulter has a near-fatal car accident, his sister comes home to take care of him. Family secrets, old loves and Mark's recovery changes all their lives. It's very detailed and confusing but also deeply insightful about one family in one small town. Pulitzer Prize Finalist. Worth the time and reflection to read this book.\n\nKim Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer Rating: 4 Stars His story catches your interest and holds you close to your page until the last words and pictures have been viewed. A sensitive story of a young boy's grief after the loss of his Dad and how he copes and matures along the journey.\n\nDottie Erdmann ([email protected]) The Sharper Your Knife, The Less You Cry by Kathleen Flinn Rating: 4 Stars An amusing and very interesting book about a 36-year-old American who loses her mundane job in London, and then decides to cash in her savings and enter Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. Armed only with big hopes, and no French, she writes of the challenges and frustrations of the classes. It was funny and enlightening. I learned I have no desire to take the class. Wonderful book.\n\nVal ([email protected]) Blind Sight by Terri Persons Rating: 4 Stars This is the 3rd book with FBI agent Bernadette Saint Clare. She has a little extra 'sense' than the usual agent. Her hunches can lead her to victims and suspects, but give her difficulty explaining the evidence. Highly recommended.\n\nHarriet Winograd ([email protected]) The Faith Club by Ranya Idliby, Suzanne Oliver, and Priscilla Warner Rating: 5 Stars Three women --- a Muslim, a Christian and a Jew --- meet to find out what the other is about and, in the process, discover who they are themselves. In addition to finding the book fascinating, it has created a need to learn more about how these religions can co-exist.\n\nBonnie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Shaffer and Barrows Rating: 4 Stars This was a lovely novel despite the overly-precious title. It almost put me off reading the book because I thought it would be a treacly \"women's\" book or romance. But it's quite wonderful and very well-written. The characters, particularly, are each distinctive and real...a big difference from too many bestsellers today (I'm talking to you, Danielle Steel, and her ilk:)\n\nRon G Body of Evidence by John Lescroat Rating: 3 Stars I would hesitate to recommend this book to non-Lescroat fans. At over 500 pages, it just doesn't keep up a good enough pace to make it a worthwhile read. It concerns a wealthy playboy's murder and Dismas Hardy ends up defending his own ex-father-in-law.\n\nRon G Ernie by Ernest Borgnine Rating: 5 Stars A brief autobiography by a 92-year-old best actor Oscar winner who has worked with some of Hollywood's best known actors of the last 60 years. This is an easy and enjoyable read that all movie buffs will relish.\n\nMarsha Little Bee by Chris Cleave Rating: 5 Stars If your book club is searching for a flawless novel, check this one out. LITTLE BEE is an amazing story of a chance encounter that changes several lives. The novel is told in two voices and as the story unfolds, you become engrossed.\n\nKellie ([email protected]) Down River by John Hart Rating: 5 Stars I loved Hart's first novel, KING OF LIES. This one is just as good, if not better, with a rare \"cannot put it down\" type of suspense. I loved it. The story is about Adam, who was falsely accused of murder and thankfully acquitted. However, there was too much damage done to his reputation and relationships so he decides to leave town. He spends 5 years in New York, and when a friend calls him for help, decides to go back home. He wonders if that was the right thing to do after old wounds resurface. Hart does a fantastic job dangling the suspense from page to page like a carrot. You don't want to stop until it ends.\n\nFran Haunted New Jersey by Patricia A. Martinelli, Charles A. Stansfield Jr. Rating: 3 Stars A fascinating book depicting some of the legends and stories behind some of New Jersey's alleged haunt sites. I'm fascinated by this stuff and it was fun to read about phenomena reported near my home town. It was based more in the story behind the legend and did not seem creepy at all.\n\nLouise Pledge See Jane Run by Joy Fielding Rating: 4 Stars The book begins: One afternoon in late spring, Jane Whittaker went to the store for some milk and some eggs and forgot who she was.\n\nThat's the premise of the story, and when we learn what caused the memory loss, it's somewhat of a surprise.\n\nI actually gave this 4 1/2 stars, and it only missed 5 due to the fact that it seemed to drag. I was reading it on a plane(s) and couldn't stick with it like I would have liked.\n\nI do really enjoy Joy Fielding, though, and keep buying everything I can find by her.\n\nJean M The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living by Martin Clark Rating: 3 Stars This one from Clark is ok, but not as good as LEGAL LIMIT (his 3rd novel).\n\nMargi The Last Child by John Hart Rating: 4 Stars Hart's latest novel is about a 13-year-old boy's year-long search for his abducted twin sister. His father has left, his mother lives in a world of booze and pills so he is basically on his own. He really trusts no one, even the policeman who seems to be on his side. He has one friend who, because of a physical deformity, is an outcast like himself. I highly recommend this book.\n\nCrystal Blackburn Murder in the Gunroom by H. Beam Piper Rating: 4 Stars A gun collector is found dead from a gunshot wound in a locked room. Private Detective (and gun collector) Jeff Rand is hired by the widow to find out what happened. Of course there is more going on that first suspected in this story first published in 1953.\n\nCrystal Blackburn Murder at Bridge by Anne Austin Rating: 4 Stars The hostess of a society bridge party is murdered while her guests hear and see nothing. Published in 1931, this book is still entertaining, and the mystery is very good.\n\nJean M Mortal Fear by Greg Iles Rating: 5 Stars Computers and murder, what more could one want? It grabs you right at the beginning and doesn't let go.\n\nVicki Early Leaving by Judy Goldman Rating: 4 Stars This is one of those books that cannot be described as \"good\" because of the subject matter, but it is very well written. It takes us back through out a mother's life as her child is about to be sentenced for murder. Highly recommended.\n\nBridget Fire And Ice by Julie Garwood Rating: 4 Stars Good book that is a cross between romance and crime story. A punky reporter whose dad is on the lam and an FBI agent hook up to solve an unrelated murder and fall in love while doing so. Some things were a little predictable, but overall, entertaining.\n\nTeresa Steinert ([email protected]) Something Borrowed by Emily Giffin Rating: 2 Stars If I could, I might give this 2.5 stars. It was a fun read, but I was really torn about how I felt about the whole \"affair\". It was her best friend, no matter that the friend was a user and taker, but the narrator did let the friendship continue this way for years. Spoken like someone 2 decades older than the main characters.\n\nVicki Little Children by Tom Perrota Rating: 4 Stars I have had this book for quite a while sitting on my shelf, and did not realize how good it was! Deals with 30ish couples, and their struggles to make a go of, well, life.\n\nVicki Living Dead In Dallas by Charlaine Harris Rating: 4 Stars I just love this series! It has mystery, a little romance, horror, and a whole lot of fun!\n\nVicki The BoneMan's Daughters by Ted DekKer Rating: 4 Stars This is one heck of a thriller ride. Dekker does not disappoint.\n\nVicki Serena by Ron Rash Rating: 5 Stars This book grabbed me in the very beginning, and didn't let go. Historical fiction that does not disappoint.\n\nVicki Dime Store Magic by Kelley Armstrong Rating: 3 Stars Third book in the Women Of The Underworld series. A little different than the previous 2, but a good read.\n\nDonna The Echo Maker by Richard Powers Rating: 3 Stars I am not sure about this book. It hasn't grabbed me but when I pick it up I want to read it. It is written very well but the story is slow.\n\nMel Morgan Etta by Elle Newmark Rating: 4 Stars Ms. Newmark provided a different portrayal of the life of Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy that was quite interesting. A true picture of the \"Old West\" at the turn of the century. Quick read and very entertaining.\n\nMel Morgan The Leisure Seeker by Michael Zadoorian Rating: 4 Stars A feisty, elderly woman along with her Alzheimer-stricken husband travel Route 66, trying to fulfill their dreams before their final days. Although there was sadness, Zadoorian provided a lot of witty humor in the novel. Enjoyed it tremendously.\n\nTeresa Steinert ([email protected]) Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay Rating: 4 Stars I loved this book. I read it in less than 48 hours.\n\nI had never heard of Vel' d'Hiv, the roundup and deportation of Jews by the French police in July '42. The 4,051 children, 5,802 women and 3,031 men were arrested, interned in terrible conditions, separated from spouses, and parents; eventually being sent to Auschwitz.\n\nThe novel was divided into 2 narratives, one from 1942 and one from 2002. I found the past narrative about the struggle of one victim, her family and how the community handled this terrible event of July '42 very vivid. I did find the struggles of the journalist of 2002 a bit more challenging. Her marriage was presented as very shallow and unfulfilling, but I don't know if that was the authors intent.\n\nIt was a great read, especially having read SUITE FRANCAISE by Irene Nemirovsky.\n\nTeresa Steinert ([email protected]) While My Sister Sleeps by Barbara Delinsky Rating: 3 Stars I would have liked to give this 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed this story of sibling rivalry between the star and Miss Dependable, and the family dynamics we all seem to get stuck with. It was heart wrenching to read about the struggles this family had to endure after a tragic accident and the choices and decisions the family needs to face during a medical crisis.\n\nVicki Christian the Lion by Anthony Bourke, John Rendall Rating: 5 Stars What is not to love about this book? If you are an animal lover, you are sure to enjoy this.\n\nBecky The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffeneger Rating: 3 Stars This book is an interesting read as the main character is able to time travel. The different perspectives of the time traveler and his wife will keep you on your toes while reading.\n\nNan The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larson Rating: 4 Stars International mystery.\n\nLinda H. ([email protected]) Die for Me by Karen Rose Rating: 5 Stars When one body is found in an abandoned field, the police call in an archaeologist to help determine if other bodies are buried there. Sophie Johannsen assists lead Detective Vito Ciccotelli with the investigation. As they search for identities of the victims, they are led to a gaming company. As outrageous as it seems, some of the identified victims bear striking resemblances to the characters in an action game manufactured by this company. When two of the victims are found to be a judge and his wife from Georgia, Vito is assisted by the judge's son and daughter, Daniel Vartanian, a Special Agent with Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and Suzanne Vartanian, a prosecutor with the New York District Attorney's office. It will be hard to put this book down until the very end.\n\nCindy S A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah Rating: 5 Stars A well-written and captivating true story of a young boy caught up in the senseless war in Sierra Leone and his journey back to a sane world.\n\nL. Hann The Other Daughter by Lisa Gardner Rating: 5 Stars Very suspenseful. Melanie is trying to find out who her real father is. Is he the child serial killer that everyone is talking about? You will be on the edge of your seat as you find out all the family secrets she uncovers.\n\nLee A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini Rating: 5 Stars In my opinion, even better than his previous book, THE KITE RUNNER.\n\nBeth The Lace Reader by Brunonia Barry Rating: 3 Stars I am halfway through this book and I have to say, I'm losing interest quickly. It's moving along very slowly.\n\nEd Hahn ([email protected]) East and West: China, Power and the Future of Asia by Chris Patten Rating: 4 Stars When my wife, Pam, and I first moved, more or less permanently to Hong Kong, Chris Patten was the newly appointed and last Governor. I think we both missed much of the drama that was evident in the five years he was here. We were too focused on our jobs and figuring out how to live in this incredible city.\n\nReading his memoir and advice, 12 years after the handover and 10 years after publication of this book, was a much needed trip down memory lane and a much needed reminder of how China operates and what is needed to successfully deal with her politicians and to a certain extent her business people.\n\nPatten writes with a nice light touch and understated humor. He is humble in the extreme but also unafraid of presenting his ideas and his principles.\n\nHe starts with a quick three chapter summary of his years as Governor. He makes no bones about the difficulties he had dealing with Beijing, or as he continues to call it, \"Peking\". He also chronicles the difficulties he had with his own government, particularly the foreign office and some economic advisers.\n\nHe was determined to introduce as much democracy as he could during his tenure, within the structure of the Joint Agreement between China and England. it was an effort neither Beijing nor previous Hong Kong governors and bureaucrats necessarily appreciated.\n\nIt made for fascinating reading and made me realize how much of what was going on politically in Hong Kong from 1992-1997 that I totally missed.\n\nIn the middle three chapters, a section titled \"The View From Hong Kong\", he takes on what he thinks are the mistaken impressions of most people when looking at the recent economic success of China and the so-called Tiger Economies. He believes that economic progress can only be sustained where there is political freedom. He refutes the idea that \"Asian Values\" usually ascribed to Confucius and others and favoring a more authoritarian political climate are really what all Asians believe or are effective at promoting long term economic growth.\n\nIn the last section, \"Looking to the Future\" he makes a compelling case for political liberalism and support for human rights. He also suggests that the way to deal with China is not to kowtow and buy the illusion that real politik in China is different than anywhere else but rather to deal with China as you would with any other emerging power, straightforward and from a position of principle leavened with pragmatism. He shows how the Chinese uses Western myths about China to manipulate the diplomatic process in their favor.\n\nI enjoyed the first part of the book more than the latter parts. I suspect because it covered history that I had lived through. The rest of the book, though is well worth the time spent and should be required reading for anyone interested in how things really work in Asia.\n\nEd Hahn ([email protected]) Resolved by Robert K. Tanenbaum Rating: 4 Stars One of Tanenbaum's --- or is it Michael Gruber's --- best efforts. It started a little slow and the last chapters were a little anticlimactic; nevertheless. it was a terrific read.\n\nThe Butch Karp series has always been peopled with astounding characters, and this volume does not disappoint. Even Ray Guma, the Mafioso prosecutor, shows up towards the end, along with Karen Stupenagel, Marlene Ciampi's old friend and rival from college, both in a very well done scene in Karp's office.\n\nThe story revolves around a terrorist plot, the reappearance of an old nemesis of Butch and Marlene's, the sociopath Felix Tighe, and Marlene's return home from her self imposed, self-loathing, guard dog training exile on Long Island.\n\nTanenbaum intersperses these threads with the trial of two policemen accused of shooting a defenseless Nigerian, Marlene's involvement with a local butcher accused of statutory rape, and Karp's discomfort with pursuing the prosecution of a gynecologist accused of raping a patient - all very juicy and fascinating sub-plots. He also does a good job of detailing the politics of the New York District Attorney's Office.\n\nThen there are the vignettes involving Lucy, Karp and Ciampi's very Roman Catholic daughter and their twins Zac and Giancarlo who are entering early adolescence.\n\nSometimes it's hard catching a breath as the story moves from one focus to another. It certainly keeps the reader guessing at what could be next. Somehow, though, Tanenbaum ties it all together at the end.\n\nFor some reason, I had stopped reading the Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi series. Now I'm hooked again and plan to soon read the prequel to this novel ABSOLUTE RAGE.\n\nJanice Hoaglin Finding God in the Shack by Randal Rauser Rating: 4 Stars I read this book while leading a group in a discussion of THE SHACK by William Paul Young. There has been extensive criticism of THE SHACK by many more conservative groups and ministers, but I found it a very powerful book. In this book, Rauser defends it against the shouts of heresy, as well as many other complaints. Rauser examines the major issues --- the image of God; the mystery of the Trinity; hierarchy in the Trinity; the arguments against an all-powerful, all-knowing God in the face of evil; atonement; salvation for all creation. That THE SHACK has brought on such discussion among so many lay people is incredible; I have not had such discussions since my college philosophy courses, and welcomed the clarity and thought-provoking analysis offered by Randal Rauser. There are two books with this same title, and I found this one more readable, although both are helpful.\n\nSteph ([email protected]) Dragonfly in Amber by Diana Gabaldon Rating: 4 Stars This is the second book in a 6-book series about Claire, who travels through time. I can't quit turning the pages.\n\nDarby Lohrding Just Take My Heart by Mary Higgins Clark Rating: 4 Stars Great mystery! The story keeps you turning the pages and staying up late to finish. It's complex with the mixing of characters, yet that adds to the heightened anticipation.\n\nBeverly J. Rowe ([email protected]) City of the Dead by T. L. Higley Rating: 4 Stars Exciting sojourn back into Egypt nearly 4,000 years ago as Hemiunu, the Grand Vizier to the Pharoah, builds the great pyramid that will house of body of the pharaoh when he dies...but a series of murders delays the construction, and stirs up a past to uncover a horrible secret that may destroy the entire kingdom. Great historical fiction.\n\nPeggy Soler 74 Seaside Avenue by Debbie Macomber Rating: 4 Stars The continuing saga of the residents of Cedar Cove. Enjoyable.\n\nBeverly J. Rowe ([email protected]) A Change of Heart by Jodi Picoult Rating: 5 Stars A carpenter is convicted of first-degree murder for killing a seven-year-old girl and her cop step-father. Now, eleven years later, the little sister of the dead girl is dying from a heart condition and desperately needs a heart transplant. The condemned man wants to give his heart to the child when he is executed, but death by lethal injection will render the heart useless. His attorney must get his execution changed to hanging to allow the transplant to work. Emotional, heart-breaking, impossible to put down.\n\nMildred B Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen Rating: 5 Stars A wonderful fairy tale-like story about an eccentric family and their magical powers.\n\nLinda H. ([email protected]) Don't Scream by Wendy Corsi Staub Rating: 5 Stars Five members of the college sorority met one evening but only four returned to the sorority house. One girl had fallen to her death and the other four swore allegiance to not tell anyone. But the next day, searchers were called and her body could not be found. Now, ten years later, someone lets the girls know that they were not alone that night and each are being threatened. They believe that it is Rachel who disappeared that night and now she is back. But as the first girl is found murdered on her birthday, the other three are frightened because their birthdays are not far away. Is Rachel a murderer? If not, who is? A very suspenseful book.\n\nLinda H. ([email protected]) Snowfall at Willow Lake by Susan Wiggs Rating: 4 Stars Sophie Bellamy is a successful attorney specializing in civil rights at the International Criminal Court in Holland. On one particular night, Sophie was present to be awarded an honor for her work in ridding an African nation of its dictator. Supporters of the former dictator were also present and shots rang out. The next day, Sophie thought long and hard about her future. In order to become the success that she was, her marriage had ended and her two children had lived with their father. Sophie now realized that she should have spent more time with her children and decided she would resign from the Court and return to the United States to live near her children. A good story about Sophie's search for redemption and happiness.\n\nCheryl S. Anton Woode: Boy Murderer by Dick Kreck Rating: 3 Stars This book is about an 11-year-old boy who shoots a man in the back for a gold watch. It describes how the courts handled the case and treated Anton Woode as an adult. The book also chronicles his time in prison and what happened when he was eventually released.\n\nMildred B Love And Othe Impossible Pursuits by Ayelet Waldman Rating: 5 Stars A story about loss and finding love as a step-mother. The story revolves around Central Park in NYC and is really a love affair with the Park.\n\nJaye An Accomplished Woman by Jude Morgan Rating: 5 Stars If you can't read Jane Austen, try this author! Great characters, great scenes (like Austen, there is some great dialogue) and I felt like I was visiting Bath all over again. I'm hoping to find the author's other books on my next book-shopping trip.\n\nDebbie ([email protected]) Bound South by Susan Rebecca White Rating: 2 Stars This is for a book club discussion, and it will probably do well with all the quirky characters. The presentation of setting and characters was flat, with no dimension. Too many of the scenes just end without a resolution. The story was slow to start and never really went anywhere. I would not recommend this book to anyone.\n\nS Larson BoneMan's Daughters by Ted Dekker Rating: 4 Stars This is my first Dekker novel, and I must say, it won't be my last. Ryan Evans is a Naval Intelligence Officer who is consumed by his job. He married Celine Evans in haste when he was younger and they adopted a little girl named Bethany. At the time Ryan was ill-equipped to handle a wife and family, he felt his sole obligation was to provide for them financially. For the most part, Ryan was an absentee husband and father, who was hardly ever home as he accepted tour after tour of overseas. Celine decided to move on and made no efforts to hide that she was dating other men. Bethany resented her father and wouldn't forgive him for being a deadbeat dad of sorts.\n\nWhile on tour in Iraq, Ryan is taken hostage by a terrorist, who uses copycat tactics of a convicted serial killer back in Evan's home state of Texas. Ryan is able to escape the ordeal and finds within himself a renewed sense of family. He can't wait to get back to Texas to apologize to both Celine and Bethany about his misgivings and to explain that he is a changed man and things will be different in the future.\n\nInstead of finding the open road to forgiveness between him and his wife and child, he finds instead his wife's new boyfriend and his child who wants nothing to do with him. Ryan is stricken with grief and doesn't know what to do.\n\nIn the meantime, the supposed convicted serial killer, Boneman is about to be released from prison due new evidence brought forward. The Boneman had abducted young girls, and broken every bone in their body without breaking their skin. Shortly after his release, Ryan's daughter Bethany is abducted and evidence is pointing towards him as the new primary suspect in the Boneman killings.\n\nSo has Ryan truly found himself; a changed man? Or has he been up to no good, when his family thought he was overseas working for the Navy?\n\nThis was a great story with an engaging cast of characters. I look forward to reading more from this author.\n\nLinda H. ([email protected]) Foxes Earth by Anne Rivers Siddons Rating: 5 Stars This is the story of Ruth Yancy, daughter of Cater Yancy, an employee of the local cotton mill and sometimes illiterate hell-and-brimstone preacher, and how she climbs out of her white trash life and becomes mistress of Fox's Earth, a white-columned house in the good section of Sparta, Georgia. Ruth used everyone, including her own family, to get what she wanted out of life without any compassion or feeling for others. The book follows from her early childhood to her death as an old lady of 85. A very good book.\n\nfran Flory: A Miraculous Story of Survival by Flory A. Van Beek Rating: 4 Stars A beautifully written memoir of a young woman and her husband's experience in hiding during the Holocaust. Her memoir captures the chaos and confusion in Holland during this time, the devastation to families as well as the generosity and spirit of those who risked their lives to help the Jewish people survive this experience.\n\nCindy Kill the Messenger by Tami Hoag Rating: 5 Stars This is my first book by Hoag, and I will read more of hers. A good thriller about an innocent bicycle messenger who finds himself caught with a vital piece of evidence between the police and a killer. There are interesting character dynamics going on, too, between the police partners, police departments, and coroner's office. Very good!\n\nLiz DiBona The Glass Castle by Jeanette Walls Rating: 5 Stars A great story about a sad situation.\n\nEvery member of my book club said it was the best book in 2 years. Looking forward to her new one in the Fall.\n\nGail White ([email protected]) Winter Soltice by Rosamund Pilcher Rating: 5 Stars What a rare find this was! I don't know how I missed it before now, except that I have been into mysteries. Mrs. Pilcher is a wonderful storyteller and I could not put this down, reading into the wee hours till finished. I just started THE SHELL SEEKERS, which I thought I had read years ago, but it is also delightful! I sure wish she would write more --- soon! Loved this book!\n\nMildred B. Thank You For All Things by Sandra Kring Rating: 5 Stars An eleven-year-old girl is looking for the truth about her father. When her Mother and Grandmother go back to the family home to take care of her dying Grandfather, she hopes to find all the family secrets.\n\nLinda H. ([email protected]) Under the Radar by Fern Michaels Rating: 5 Stars The latest book about the female vigilantes has the girls taking on one of the polygamous sects in Utah. As they download information and find that not only are young girls given in marriage to men old enough to be their grandfathers but all of these additional wives sign up for and receive welfare. The compound is known as Heaven on Earth (or HOE) and is headed by a man named Harold Evanrod, known as the Prophet. Using the monies received from taxpayers under the guise of welfare, the Prophet has furnished his home lavishly and drives an expensive Bentley. The sheriff and local doctor are all members of the sect and no one can be trusted. Since Charles and Myra are out of the country, Nikki has to get in touch with Charles' contact for help. This book is an easy and enjoyable read.\n\nSusan Dyer ([email protected]) Are You Afraid? by Carla Cassidy Rating: 5 Stars I just started reading this book and it hooked me from page one. A woman whose job is to help people over come their fears actually has a fear herself. Right from the beginning of the book, someone is messing with her mind and she relives her fear all over again!\n\nPat ([email protected]) Serena by Ron Rash Rating: 5 Stars Finished it in one day. Could not put it down. Loved the ending as it was an unknown twist. Waiting for his next one, if it comes about?\n\nMarion Miller ([email protected]) The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Annie Barrows and Mary Ann Schaffer Rating: 5 Stars This is one of the best books I've read in years! I enjoyed every minute of every letter. A must read!\n\nAna Marie The Stone Forest by Karen Harper Rating: 4 Stars This book is about two teenage sisters, one of whom likes to sneak out at night to see her boyfriend, while the younger one covers for her. One nigh,t out of curiosity, the younger one sneaks out to spy on her sister. She hears sounds and thinks they are \"love\" sounds. All of a sudden, both sisters are attacked and kept prisoners in a dark cave for days. One is let go and the older sister disappears for what seems forever. Now, 15 years later, clues are showing up that indicate she may be alive.\n\nMaria Bongiovanni ([email protected]) New Moon by Stephenie Meyer Rating: 5 Stars This is the second in the Twilight series about vampires. This second book continues the love drama between Edward and Bella, but a new character comes into the picture, Jacob Black --- a Native Indian in Washington state who falls in love with Bella and is trying to win her heart, even though he knows she is love with Edward the vampire. Surprise --- Jacob also has a secret, but you'll just have to read this book to find out what it is. You won't be disappointed. Now I can't wait to read the 3rd book in this 4-part series.\n\nPatty Shogren ([email protected]) Belong To Me by Marisa de los Santos Rating: 4 Stars A sequel to LOVE WALKS IN, but it's not necessary to read the first one. A great story with a few twists. Everyone needs someone to belong to.\n\nPatty Shogren ([email protected]) Angels & Demons by Dan Brown Rating: 4 Stars I'm not quite finished, but it seems to be even better than THE DA VINCI CODE. It's a very exciting mystery that is hard to put away. great summer read. can't wait to see the movie.\n\nAnnetta Stolpmann Sudden Death by Allison Brennan Rating: 4 Stars Loved this book --- cannot wait to read the next in the series.\n\nSusan C The Help by Kathryn Stockett Rating: 5 Stars Excellent story of southern life and the relationships (or non-relationships) of the black housekeepers and the families they work for.\n\nJudy Vianna Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford Rating: 5 Stars Mr. Ford walks back and forth between 1942-45 and 1989 with ease and grace. He made us see that race is a minor item when it comes to love and devotion. The hotel is a wonderful landmark to a group of people who were wrongly accused. Wonderful read with an ending to please.\n\nBarbara S. Silver Bells by Fern Michaels et al Rating: 5 Stars I just finished reading SILVER BELLS --- the primary writer being Fern Michaels. Other stories were provided by Jo Ann Ross, Mary Burton and Judy Duarte.\n\nI love these books that usually come out around the Holidays with other authors contributing their stories. This is a great way to find out if the additional writers offer the writing style that suits you. I wasn't disappointed with any of the stories, especially the story written by Mary Burton.\n\nSusan , Saratoga Mrs. Somebody Somebody by Tracy Winn Rating: 3 Stars These short stories are depressing and somewhat disturbing. They all center around residents in Lowell, Massachusetts. The stories kept my interest but it was not a \"feel good\" book.\n\nNikki ([email protected]) Handle With Care by Jodi Picoult Rating: 4 Stars I was hooked by page 5 of this book and wondered why I waited to start reading it. Any mother who reads this book will feel Charlotte's pain and doubt about her child's future. While I found some of the sisters' storylines to imitate MY SISTER'S KEEPER (my all-time favorite Jodi book), the similarities did not detract from the story for me. The reason I'm giving the book 4 stars is the ending. I understand where it came from, but I found it very unlikely. I hope Jodi Picoult never stops writing!\n\nM. Parks Field of Darkness by Cornelia Read Rating: 5 Stars I enjoyed this novel very much. It is a murder mystery but the \"detective\" Maddie Dare is a very likeable character who comes from an aristocratic,Long Island family in decline, full of eccentrics. She tells you her money is so old that there's none left. Living in Syracuse now, married and working for a local newspaper, she feels the need to investigate an unsolved murder that may be linked to a much more prosperous and charming relative.\n\nJulie H. The Awakening by Kelley Armstrong Rating: 4 Stars Picking up in what seems like moments after the ending of Armstrong's first book THE SUMMONING, we find Chloe Saunders and her friend Rae captured by the Edison Group, the doctors who were conducting experiments on supernatural teens at Lyle House. Surprised to find former housemate Tori there as well (Chloe assumed she was the tattler on their original escape plan), the girls are eager to slip out of Dr. Davidoff's hands and find Simon and Derek. Davidoff plans on using them as bait to nose out the brothers, but with the help of half-demon Liz and a redeemed Aunt Lauren, Tori and Chloe escape and are reunited with Simon and Derek. The boys figure if they can reach their father's old friend, Andrew, he will provide help and answers. A bit disturbed by what they have already learned, Chloe and the others wonder how the genetic mutations done to them will manifest now that they are in their teens and their various powers are coming to light.\n\nJudy Vianna The Language of Bees by Laurie R. King Rating: 5 Stars I am an avid Laurie King fan and have read all her books, but her Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell series is my favorite.\n\nAfter a long trip and an expected rest, Russell and Sherlock return home to find his bees are dying and Sherlock's long lost son appears and needs help, searching for his lost wife and child.\n\nRussell takes on the task at hand and gets herself involved with a religious cult, suicides, Bohemian London lifestyles and the secrets of her daughter-in-law's past.\n\nThe killer is very dangerous and Russell puts herself in harms way to protect both her husband and her \"new son\". Not only does she solve this problem, she also solves the problem with Holmes's bees!\n\nPat Hill ([email protected]) Intent to Kill by James Grippando Rating: 5 Stars Exciting, edge-of-your-seat suspense.\n\nPatty Shogren ([email protected]) Belong to Me by Marisa de los Santos Rating: 4 Stars A good story about friendship and love. A woman finds happiness and unexpected love with a young girl and an old friend.\n\nLinda M. Johnson ([email protected]) Tea: A Novel by Stacey D'Erasmo Rating: 3 Stars I had no prior knowledge of this author. I heard a laudatory New York Times Book Review podcast of Ms. D'Erasmo's third book. I decided to start with her first book. It is the coming-of-age story of Isabella Gold, told in three sections: Morning, Afternoon, Evening and the three different girl friends who are close to Isabella at the respective time. In the beginning, Isabella observes her mother and the obvious unhappiness the former actress suffers from. After her mother's suicide, Isabella continues to dissect what she knows of her mother's life (her mother's ever present cup of \"tea\"; did her mom have pearls; the clippings and ticket stubs from theater productions). Isabella develops theatrical inspirations and a realization she may be a lesbian.\n\nAlthough very well written, I did not appreciate the explicitness of Isabella's sexual relationships. It matters not whether the sex is cross gender or not. I'd prefer if she just closed the door and left the bedroom scenes to my imagination.\n\nKay Resilliance by Elizabeth Edwards Rating: 5 Stars This is a compelling memoir! Elizabeth Edwards writes so well and so honestly about her life --- especially the loss of her son, Wade. She is a gifted writer as well as a genuine woman! The memoir is short, compact, and wonderfully written.\n\nKay First Family by David Baldacci Rating: 5 Stars This is one of the very best Baldacci books to come along in awhile! Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are searching for the kidnapped niece of the First Lady. The murder of Michelle Maxwell's mother also provides an interesting subplot. This is a very good read!\n\nBridget Something Borrowed by Emily Giffen Rating: 5 Stars Two best friends from childhood are living the good life in Manhattan; one a lawyer, the other a PR person. One gets engaged to the other's \"friend.\" Everything is good until the groom and maid of honor realize they are in love. A crazy summer occurs. Sounds hokey, but the author did an amazing job and everything seems totally plausible. The relationship between the two women is explored in depth. How they all got to where they are is also covered quite nicely. I could not put this book down and was a little disappointed when it ended. The upside is that there is a sequel that I am going to read!\n\nCrystal Blackburn Death of a Hussy by M. C. Beaton Rating: 5 Stars A Hamish Macbeth Mystery.\n\nLinda The Program by Stephen White Rating: 4 Stars Although this book was copyrighted in 2001, it is well worth a read. Not only was it full of suspense, but it taught me a lot about the Witness Protection Service.\n\nMaria Bongovanni ([email protected]) Twilight by Stephenie Meyer Rating: 5 Stars This was a very good book. For those of you who have already seen the movie, the book is much better. The main characters, Edward and Bella, are lovers who can't be together because Edward is a vampire. This was very fast-paced read and I couldn't wait to start the second book. Highly recommended.\n\nJulia Desmond Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama Rating: 5 Stars Our book group just completed discussing President Obama's book\n\nand everyone there agreed it was\n\nexcellent. It was extremely well\n\nwritten and provided a myriad of\n\nhistorical data, which provoked both\n\nintellectual and spiritual conversation.\n\nChris The Queen of the BigTime by Adriana Trigiani Rating: 3 Stars An absorbing tale of a turn-of-the-century family and a rags-to-riches life.\n\nChris Lucia, Lucia by Adriana Trigiani Rating: 4 Stars Wonderful story of Italian life in 1950s New York City and of a girl named Lucia, who learns some life lessons the hard way.\n\nCynthia Plaza-Harney The Turnaround by George Pelecanos Rating: 5 Stars This is a well-written book and it is my first from this author. I will say it is not my last book with this author. It is about six young men and how their lives change from one night. It takes you back to the seventies to today. It is a must read and I could see it as a movie as well.\n\nChris Rococo by Adriana Trigiani Rating: 3 Stars Another saga of Italian life, this one set in the 1970s, revolving around Bartolomeo and his family. Bartolomeo, or B, as he is known, is a decorator and tells a hilarious tale about his family and its ups and downs.\n\nSuzy Smith ([email protected]) The Lost Quilter by Jennifer Chiaverini Rating: 4 Stars A bit slower to get into than Ms. Chiaverini's previous book, but it's far and away my favorite of her books in several years.\n\njhendrix ([email protected]) Plain Language by Barbara Wright Rating: 4 Stars A story about a 33-year-old southern Quaker (Virginia Mendenhall) who traveled to Colorado to marry a 43-year-old rancher, Alfred Bowen, during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The depression , the drought, neighbors aand a troubled brother as well as unspoken confessions all create a real moment in time.\n\nChris She Always Wore Red by Angela Hunt Rating: 4 Stars Second in her trilogy, this book continues the story of Jennifer and her boys, who have inherited a funeral home, moved to Florida to claim it, endured a divorce, then the death of the boys' father. There are new themes of dealing with racism, aging and infidelity, and some are covered better than others. Hunt seems to try to tackle a little too much this go round, but the book is still enjoyable. Good book club read.\n\nPamela M. Moore ([email protected]) The Help by Kathryn Stockett Rating: 4 Stars I was impressed by this book, especially its use of multiple points of view and the smoothly flowing, rhythmic regional dialect. Is the author successful in the voice of black woman? Probably not, but she is quite successful in the voice of a woman. Especially interesting and accurate is the \"tap dancing\" of those trying to stay within the largely unwritten racial boundaries of the time.\n\nPamela M. Moore ([email protected]) Mistress Shakespeare by Karen Harper Rating: 4 Stars I was impressed with the interweaving of Shakespeare's lines and the few facts known about him with this little known mystery involving Anne Whateley. While it is a work of fiction, it is fascinating and supplies many \"answers,\" especially the ever-present, \"what if...?\" This is an easy read, delightfully filled with nuances and teasers for those who love Shakespeare.\n\nPamela M. Moore ([email protected]) The Yiddish Policemen's Union by Michael Chabon Rating: 3 Stars This mystery keeps the reader stuggling to keep up with the Yiddish phrases and does not immediately draw the reader in. The fascinating part of the book is that the plot is predicated on an obscure proposal in history: populating a section of Alaska with displaced Jews after World War II. Thus, the entire setting as well as plot is fiction, yet based on a very real part of Alaska and the question \"What if...?\" Interesting.\n\nBarbara ([email protected]) The Big House by George H. Colt Rating: 1 Stars Our book club selection; 100 years of Boston Brahmin summer house, boring!\n\nBarbara ([email protected]) House at Sugar Beach by Helene Cooper Rating: 4 Stars A great memoir about life in Liberia and a window into the causes of their problems.\n\nPret ([email protected]) Dust and Shadow by Lyndsay Faye Rating: 5 Stars Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper, narrated by (of course) Dr. John H. Watson. Any true fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his infamous crime detective duo will not be disappointed in this book. Lyndsay Faye has delivered a well-written piece of Sherlockian adventure and has earned her place on Baker Street.\n\nVickie N Prayers For Sale by Sandra Dallas Rating: 5 Stars This book is just wonderful. It is funny and sad and heart wrenching. The main character , Hennie, tells the best stories. It was such a joy to read.\n\nKellie ([email protected]) Lisey's Story by Stephen King Rating: 2 Stars I didn't hate this book and I'm surprised at that. It was long and drawn out in many places. I had a hard time figuring out whether we were in the present or the past, or whether we were in Boo ya Moon or the house. The concept of the plot was very odd, but I found myself feeling compassion for Lisey and the grief she was going thru. This is the second King book I have read, although I can't remember what the other book was, it was so long ago. I don't think I have read a book quite like this before. I don't think I'd recommend it to many people because it's so long and sometimes boring. But if you enjoy deep, somewhat depressing books with a taste of paranormal, this one's for you.\n\n[email protected] All Other Nights by Dara Horn Rating: 5 Stars Story set during the Civil War about the role Jewish soldiers and spies (some of them women)played in both the war and in attempting to assassinate Lincoln.\n\nJulie M The Weight of Heaven by Thrity Umrigar Rating: 5 Stars Umrigar has done it again, only better! This is a great book. Great characters and a heart-wrenching story. I actually gasped out loud at one point. I don't want to say to much about the story except, read this book!\n\nP. Morris Bobbie Faye's Very (very, very, very) Bad Day by Toni McGee Causey Rating: 5 Stars I'm re-reading this book along with the 2nd installment in the Bobbie Faye series --- BOBBY FAYE'S (KINDA, SORTA, NOT EXACTLY) FAMILY JEWELS --- this summer in preparation for the third book to be released in August. You'll laugh out loud; it's the perfect summer fun read\n\nSharon Galli Dark Places by Gillian Flynn Rating: 4 Stars DARK PLACES, as well as Gillian Flynn's last book, SHARP OBJECTS, are truly different from most fiction. They're dark, but hopeful. This one is seen through the eyes of an unfortunate character.\n\nGail Home Safe by Elizabeth Berg Rating: 4 Stars A really enjoyable book, even though the main character and her daughter were somewhat annoying. I like the way the characters are very human and at least Helen is not afraid to share her fears. The story centers on Helen, a successful writer who is not only experiencing writer's block but is grieving the loss of her husband. She is having a true \"crisis of character\" --- trying to grow and find out who she is at the age of 59! Yeah --- not just teenagers go through this angst.\n\njulie Sweet Mandarin by Helen Tse Rating: 4 Stars A lovely memoir of the author's great-grandmother, grandmother and mother. This is a story of the struggle of these three Chinese women and how they survived hardships such as poverty and discrimination to create a good life for those who came after them.\n\nVickie N Resilience by Elizabeth Edwards Rating: 4 Stars This was such an interesting story understanding her outlook on life. She has been through so much and has chosen to have as happy a life as possible in spite of everything. It was uplifting to read.\n\nJoanne Friday ([email protected]) Washington Weirdos by Gayle Wigglesworth Rating: 4 Stars The author has created some fun characters that seem as real as your neighbors and co-workers. This is the second in a series about Claire Gulliver. Since they each have a different location, I thought I could start with the second. I want to know more about the characters' relationships so I am now looking for TEA FOR TERROR.\n\nMarjorie Clark ([email protected]) Never Tell a Lie by Hallie Ephron Rating: 4 Stars Just started, but appears to be a great thriller. I'm enjoying the first 35 pages so far. She also wrote another book named \"1001 BOOKS FOR EVERY MOOD, which is a great book if you are undecided about what to read.\n\nMarsha Nefertiti by Michelle Moran Rating: 4 Stars The story of Nefertiti is told in the voice of her younger sister, Mutnodjmet. Her ascent to the become Queen of Egypt, Daughter of Eternity by her relationship as beloved of Pharoh Amunhotep (Akhenaten), is a fascinating view of the inner workings of the life of the rich and powerful. She who marries money earns it.\n\nJudy O. ([email protected]) Borderline by Nevada Barr Rating: 4 Stars This book takes off at breakneck speed and never lets up until the exciting ending. Anna Pigeon has gone on a rafting trip to Big Bend National Park with her new husband, Paul. She is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after her last big adventure at Isle Royal National Park and has come to Big Bend to heal. Not gonna' happen! Their raft overturns in the Rio Grande River, and there starts the action. Someone is shooting at them with intent to kill, they have a new-born baby to take care of, and people are dying. This is a great, but exhausting read. I hope the author will give Anna and Paul a much- needed rest now.\n\nnarfie A Reliable Wife by Robert Goolrick Rating: 3 Stars An interesting novel, with quirky characters who are extremely unhappy with their lives. I kind of enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ralph Truitt and Catherine Land, albeit it was bizarre in nature. Strange, but kept the pages turning.\n\nT. Thomas Not Becoming My Mother by Ruth Reichl Rating: 3 Stars I like Ruth Reichl and enjoy her books. This is about her mother and what, in hindsight, she learned from her. This is about an hour's read.\n\nT. Thomas Montana Star by Deann Smallwood Rating: 3 Stars This is a pleasant escapist read for an evening. The proofreading was not as it should be (seems to be more and more common in publishing). On one page the word gamete was used when it should have been gamut.\n\nT. Thomas Seducing an Angel by Mary Balogh Rating: 3 Stars This is the fourth in the series about the Huxtable siblings. It was not as good as the first three. The characters did not seem as well developed.\n\nE.R. Streich Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir by Chrstopher Buckley Rating: 5 Stars Christopher Buckley celebrates the lives of his parents, givng us some really inside views of William Buckley and his famous wife, while also sharing his mourning with us. He takes readers on, what surprised me, an entertaining tour through hospitals, funeral homes, and memorial services, capturing the heartbreaking and disorienting feeling of losing both parents within 11 months. It is at times hilarious; moving; and pointedly sad, but mostly it celebrates their lives and his life with both of them.\n\nCrystal Blackburn First Family by David Baldacci Rating: 5 Stars A kidnapping tale that is really much, much more.\n\nKim About Face by Donna Leon Rating: 4 Stars Number 18 in the Commissario Guido Brunetti mystery series, ABOUT FACE, will not disappoint fans of the overeducated, philosophical, pragmatic detective.\n\nOnce again, Brunetti must work under the radar of his boss, the ineffective Patta, when the Carabiniere approaches him for assistance in an illegal garbage-hauling case that might be connected to the Camorra. Coincidentally, Brunetti's father-in-law, Conte Falier, is considering investing in China, a deal that would partner him with Cataldo a man in the shipping and heavy equipment industry, and asks Guido to investigate. Brunetti is reluctant but curious about Cataldo's unusual wife and it is this curiosity that pulls him into a knot of hazardous waste, dark secrets, and murder.\n\nBrunetti is left to untangle the red tape, dispel interdepartmental distrust, and to interpret what is not being said by all those involved. There are quite a few family meals, grappa, the occasional coffee and of course the backdrop of Venice to balance all the corruption and moral decay.\n\nJulie Roberts Obedience by Will Lavender Rating: 5 Stars I am reading this one again. It's such an intriguing story and the first time I read it, I found myself sure I knew exactly what happened and what the purpose was when I closed the book. After discussing it with someone, I began to ask more questions and decided to venture into it again.\n\nTerri ([email protected]) The Jew Store by Stella Suberman Rating: 4 Stars A memoir about the author's father and the dry goods store he ran in a small town in Tennessee during the 1920s. The trials and blessings of the only Jewish family in town make for a compelling and touching story.\n\nMarisa The Torso by Helene Tursten Rating: 5 Stars Tursten has written a series of police procedural/crime/mystery novels in her native Sweden. Now they're being translated into English and coming to America. This is a fanstastic read, very frightening and gory, but so interesting. Detective Huss is a female, mother and wife trying to balance the demands of home with the demands of the job. This particular case involves a serial killer with a penchant for dismembering the victims. The setting is Sweden and Copenhagen. I look forward to meeting more Detective Huss books.\n\nMarsha Road Dogs by Elmore Leonard Rating: 4 Stars No one writes dialogue to match Leonard's. His characters come alive through their spoken words. However, I would have liked to have a better resolution to this story. It does, however, leave a perfect way to continue the tale.\n\nMarsha Gone Tomorrow by Lee Child Rating: 5 Stars Jack Reacher is back and better than ever. Not only is this a masterful tale, but we learn detailed information on the NY Subway System.\n\nMarsha Cemetery Dance by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child Rating: 4 Stars I always look forward to a new adventure with Special Agent Pendergast and his cohorts as they unravel complicated plots. This one takes us to a part of Manhattan unknown to most of us. Quite the thriller!\n\nMarsha Cross Country by James Patterson Rating: 5 Stars I enjoy the novels written by Patterson alone better than his collaborations. ThisAlex Cross novel is quite violent but very thrilling. It takes us into the workings of the deadly African underworld of Washington D.C. and makes us aware of how fortunate we are to live in this country.\n\nColleen R. A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini Rating: 5 Stars I just finished reading this for the second time after 2 years. I will probably read it again and again every coupke of years.\n\nGil City of Thieves by David Benioff Rating: 4 Stars What I remember the most about this book is how cruel the Germans were to the civilians they conquered. And also, how uncaring the Russian officials were to their own people. All if this came across very realistically in the book. The \"thieves\" as the main characters, were very likable, their lives pathetic with their main goal being just to survive. Their struggles were heartbreaking. I think this book shows how bad wars are.\n\nJulie Roberts Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins Rating: 4 Stars Sometimes it doesn't seem to make sense, but give it time --- it all comes together. This is one of the most humorous books I've read with a smart, witty bit of writing.\n\nSandy Mixed Blood by Roger Smith Rating: 5 Stars You should be warned, there is a bit of graphic language and violence in this book, so it is not for everyone, but for those of you who realize that is part of the story this was a great read. The characters fight for their lives against a Cape Town full of corruption and gang violence. I can't wait for Roger Smith's next book.\n\nSandra Hughes To Siberia by Per Petterson Rating: 3 Stars The story of a boy and his sister who both want to leave their native Denmark --- the girl to Siberia and the boy to mysterious and exciting places. After their grandfather's death the family changes and eventually both the boy and the girl do leave and lose touch with each other for several years.\n\nLee Searoad by Ursula K. Le Guin Rating: 3 Stars A small seaside town in Oregon is the \"sticking place\" for this collection of short stories about the fragile lives we shape with others in love and fear. Passages about the sea foam women in the first and last story of the book are especially beautiful, but all of the stories are so rich in symbolism that this would be a fascinating book to share in a discussion group.\n\nMerle Lucy by Ellen Feldman Rating: 3 Stars Interesting vesion of the love affair between Lucy Mercer and FDR.\n\nYou learn quite a bit about Eleanor and FDR through the estory.\n\nPatty T ([email protected]) Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher Rating: 4 Stars I loved this book. It's about a high school girl who commits sucide. And how thirteen different people affected her life and her decision to die. If this book helps one person then it more than did its job.\n\nJulie H A Kiss in Time by Alex Flinn Rating: 3 Stars Another enjoyable fairy tale meets present-day story, this one harking back toSleeping Beauty. Talia is almost sixteen and like any teen, is tired of being bossed around by her parents and never being left alone. Everyone is so sure that spindle curse from her christening is going to come true. (anytime you snub a witch with \"Mal\" in her name, good things just aren't going to happen). Sure enough, as Talia is searching for gowns for her sixteenth birthday, an old seamestress lets her touch her spinning wheel. Three hundred years later, Jack and his friend Travis, while on a European trip designed to pad their college applications, stumble across a thick bramble while searching for a beach. After they make their way through, confused to the state of the people at the castle, they find Talia asleep. While Travis is off trying on the royal jewels, Jack kisses Talia, which awakens the kingdom. Talia's father is furious at her disobedience, eventually resulting in Talia's escape to Miami, where the fish out of water story then continues.\n\nLinda Cunningham Don't Look Twice by Andrew Gross Rating: 5 Stars Andrew Gross has learned from the best. I love all of the books he co-wrote with James Patterson, and all of his solo books have been just as gripping.\n\nLinda Cunningham Run for Your Life by James Patterson Rating: 5 Stars I am a big James Patterson fan, and this book was one of his best.\n\nLinda Cunningham The 8th Confession by James Patterson Rating: 5 Stars I love all of James Patterson's books, especially the Women's Murder Club series.\n\nLouise Pledge In Silence by Erica Spindler Rating: 5 Stars I enjoyed this book so much that, with my presently busy schedule, I carried it around with me everywhere, just for the free minutes I had to continue reading.\n\nA big city journalist returns to her small home town after her father's shocking suicide and discovers that maybe the perfect town has a few flaws. It's a real Whodunit with a surprise ending.\n\nCarol Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen Rating: 4 Stars Have been hearing others talk about this book for years. It was not as \"meaty\" as I expected.\n\nA graduate student at Cornell is ready for the end of his days as a student when his parents are killed in a car accident. He just walks away from school trying to deal with his grief and anger. He hops on to a train, a circus train and the adventure really begins. He ends up with a pregnant wife, 11 horses, a chimpanzee, and an elephant--and couldn't be happier.\n\nDebbie ([email protected]) A Dedicated Man by Peter Robinson Rating: 2 Stars This is another of the Alan Banks series, I purchased three, and I regret that decision. The stories are mediocre, other writers are a lot better. In this one, a wealthy professor is murdered. Many pages later, the killers are caught. The process is long and tedious, with very little insight or knowledge gathered along the way. I do not recommend this series.\n\nJulie H. First Family by David Baldacci Rating: 1 Stars Oh, not the best thing I've ever read. The only character that was even remotely speaking to me was kidnapped, 12-year-old Willa. She had spunk.\n\nGenie Justice Denied by J. A. Jance Rating: 4 Stars This takes up where J. P. Beaumont has left the Seattle PD and gone to work for the state Attorney General's Office. He is still investigating homicides on the Special Homicide Investigation Team. Girlfriend, fellow investigator Mel Soames, is a partner both on and off the job. Mel's straight-shooting, stick-to-it attitude is the greatest help on both investigations as well as family disputes (and there are plenty of both in this book).\n\nWhat begins with the death of an ex-con turns into an investigation into a series of similar murders, all involving ex-cons who have served time for crimes against women. In between the twists and turns of the investigations, are old unresolved family issues.\n\nMichele L. The Inn At Eagle Point by Sherryl Woods Rating: 5 Stars Sherryl Woods has penned another masterpiece, called THE INN AT EAGLE POINT, situated in an enchanting town along the bay in Maryland. Familial love, friendship and trust envelop an endearing plot that will warm your heart.\n\nAbby O'Brien Winters takes a vacation from her Wall Street career to assist her sibling, Jess, back home in Chesapeake Shores from losing a Victorian Inn. Taking her two twin daughters with her, she returns to her family home to live with her Grandma while fixing the financial mess for her sister. What she doesn't expect is to see her long ago flame, Trace Riley. Trace still holds a special place in his heart for Abby. When the two of them get together, sparks fly.good and bad ones! Unsettled issues between these two adamant lovers make for exciting reading!\n\nThere are twists galore involving family and Abby's ex-husband. I loved how Ms. Woods captured all the characteristics of broken relationships, the sadness, anger and resentment that can harbor over the years. Learning to trust plays an important role in the story. THE INN AT EAGLE POINT is exquisite, stylish and beautifully written with a heart-tugging story at its core. This is definitely a two-hankie story. Romance definitely walks in along with a breath of fresh air in this delightful new novel.\n\nGenie A Fistful of Charms by Kim Harrison Rating: 5 Stars Rachel Morgan takes on triple duty as she set out to track down her ex-boyfriend (Nick), Jenke's son (Jax) and the sacred werewolf artifact they have stolen. The theft has gotten them both imprisoned by Weres in Michigan.\n\nWhen Jenks insists on going along on the mission. Rachel decides it would be to their advantage to give him given human proportions. With help from Ceri's knowledge of demon magic, Jenks is transformed and he and Rachel begin their dangerous road trip. Finding Jax turns out to be the easiest task in an operation that quickly becomes both complicated and dangerous well beyond their expectations.\n\nThis is a tale with many twists and turns and several sub-plots as the search begins and the mystery surrounding the artifact unfolds. As usual, Harrison combines suspense, and humor in a quick-paced story.\n\nLinda Cunningham Just Take My Heart by Mary Higgins Clark Rating: 4 Stars As usual, Ms. Clark keeps you guessing until the end.\n\nLinda L. Paper Towns by John Green Rating: 4 Stars My daughter (a soon-to-graduate high school senior) recommended I read this YA book, and I'm glad she did. Part mystery, part coming-of-age story, Green puts soon-to-graduate high school senior Quentin and his friends in a race to find a missing girl. It was a real page-turner with clever dialogue and sympathetic character development. I've added Green's previous novels to my reading list.\n\nBonnie Resolution by Robert B. Parker Rating: 3 Stars It's a 4-star story and very entertaining. But, I took away one star because it annoys me that virtually every character in Parker's books --- be they cowboy, detective, or hitman --- speaks in the same staccato, dry-humor, clipped parlance. Not everyone on the face of the earth speaks like that, entertaining though it may be.\n\nBonnie Stone Cold by David Baldacci Rating: 2 Stars An okay beach read. I could only give it two stars, however, because, while I read it only last week, I had to go back and read the cover and first page to even remember what the story was about. Not a good sign.\n\nMindy ([email protected]) Inkheart by Cornelia Funke Rating: 5 Stars Still in the process of reading this, but am expecting the remainder to be great.\n\nMichele L. For The Love Of Pete by Julia Harper Rating: 5 Stars FOR THE LOVE OF PETE is an exhilarating story of deception, car chases, murder and hot romance. When a baby girl is abducted from a man who is about to stand on trial against a mob boss, things go haywire. Zoey Addler, a verbally candid, red haired beauty jumps into a lush BMW with sumptuous Lips of Sin, FBI Agent, Dante Torelli, after eye witnessing her niece Pete, being abducted by a crazy, gun-toting man. They race down the streets, eluding the cops and hiding from crazy shooting killers.\n\nSexy innuendos, hot kisses, tender embraces and sensuous glances, steam up the windows of the BMW, as Dante and Zoey spend quality time together in the bullet-riddled car. Ms. Harper employs a brisk, edgy style to her writing as she propels her heroes on the drive of their life. Other unexpected developments will take readers by surprise. There are wacky and dangerous characters galore along with unpredictable plot twists. I fell in love with the crazy aunties as they race to retrieve their illegal spices back. Ms. Harper has a special gift of making readers laugh at the antics between the bantering heroes as the story catapults along. Hold on to your seat as you go on a thrilling ride, for the love of pete!\n\nMaureen H The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie by Jennifer Ashley Rating: 4 Stars Having heard many favorable reviews, I decided to pick up this book. I was very happy with this story. Ian and Beth are a very likable couple. This is the beginning of a series and I am looking forward to the others.\n\nMaureen H Lover Unbound by J. R. Ward Rating: 3 Stars I have been following this series from the beginning and loved the first 3 books. Books 4 and 5, however, were big disappointments. I will not continue this series.\n\nMaureen H Down River by John Hart Rating: 5 Stars I am reading this book from the recommendations here. I am sure glad that I did. This book is a very fast-paced page turner. It is a rare book that comes along once in a while. I am really enjoying this tale.\n\nMichele L. 4 Bodies And A Funeral by Stephanie Bond Rating: 5 Stars 4 BODIES AND A FUNERAL is a fast-moving, densely-plotted murder mystery that is full of fun, wit and sizzling escapades.

Lord Of Legends by Susan Krinard Rating: 5 Stars Susan Krinard's new novel in the FANE series, called LORD OF LEGENDS, is a captivating, historical paranormal romantic tale filled with deception, passion and unpredictable circumstances.

She is determined to remain stoic in the face of her mother-in-law even though she is trembling inside.

Arion, King of the Unicorns, also known as Ash, is a strong, powerful and seductive character. I was mesmerized by Ms. Krinard's teasing way of drawing out the true mischievous nature of Ash.

As Mariah unravels secrets of this mystifying individual, she also uncovers facts about her own legacy and the part she plays in it. As the tale evolves, you will be completely captivated by the history of unicorns.
