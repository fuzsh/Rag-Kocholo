        "text": "From Tiptree to Leckie to L’Engle and Cherryh, science fiction has a rich history of women writing progressive and popular fiction. One could argue that modern science fiction was vitalized by Shelley, and Ursula K. Le Guin has been an ambassador for fantastic and thoughtful fiction for decades. And, of course, now they’re the destroying it one novel at a time.\n\nRecently, the /r/printSF sub-Reddit began a conversation about the best science fiction by women. I realized that I’ve read a woefully small number of the listed books, and this spurred some thought in my head about continuing this conversation, and using it as an opportunity to highlight some of the best science fiction books by women.\n\nMy own experiences within science fiction are fairly shallow (at least in terms of the scope of this project), so I asked some of my favourite authors and writers to tell me a bit about their favourites. So, join me, Julie Czerneda, Ann Leckie, Francis Knight, Andrew Liptak, Teresa Frohock, and Maureen Kincaid Speller as we gush about some of the best novels that science fiction has on offer.\n\nAndre Norton\n\nAs with all readers, early exposure to amazing books helped set Leckie on her path towards winning the Hugo and the Nebula for Ancillary Justice. She put in a good word for an under appreciated childhood-favourite: Andre Norton. “I also, though, want to put in a word for the favorite of my youth–which would have been a tie between The Zero Stone and Sargasso of Space, both by Andre Norton. Norton has received a fair amount of acclaim–she had a World Fantasy lifetime achievement award, she was a SFWA Grandmaster, she’s in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. But I kind of feel like her name doesn’t come up in lists of big name, influential writers nearly as often as it should.\n\n“Are women destroying science fiction?” asked K. Tempest Bradford of NPR. “Yes. Women created it, so it’s only fair. […] In destroying it, women are creating a larger space for themselves within science fiction; one filled with their voices, dreams, experiences and realities.”\n\nC.J. Cherryh remains a popular choice, and continues to publish exciting science fiction and inspire new writers, and writers like M.J. Locke and Karin Lowachee proved that diversity, thoughtfulness, and undistilled fun still exist in the genre. It’s interesting to note that only Karin Lowachee, Julie E. Czerneda, and Kathleen Ann Goonan publish under names that aren’t gender-non-specific or initials. Is this a coincidence stemming from a small sample size? Or a larger trend? In a genre as rich with wonderful women as science fiction, we can dream of a day when the name on the cover can be ‘Celia’ or ‘Carolyn’ or ‘Alice’ without reserve. Are we getting closer to that day?\n\nWhat are some of your favourite science fiction novels written by women?"
