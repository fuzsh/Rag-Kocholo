        "text": "Publishers have their faults but they do not forget anniversaries. This year in books, accordingly, was always going to have an elegiac tone, so dominated by the centenary of the first world war that it often felt like we were commemorating its early stages in real time – as indeed we were. Readers could draw comfort from the fact that similar landmarks have often produced enduring works – think Simon Schama’s Citizens, published for the bicentenary of the French Revolution – and in Christopher Clark’s The Sleepwalkers and Margaret MacMillan’s The War that Ended Peace , we had two likely classics before 2014 even arrived. Many more titles followed: histories, as you would expect, with Adam Tooze’s The Deluge a heavyweight offering; but also novels, biographies of war poets and statesmen, some fine anthologies and powerful first-hand accounts such as The Burning of the World, a memoir of Austro-Hungarian army life by the painter Béla Zombory-Moldován.\n\nYour book of 2014\n\nWhat do you think? Scroll down to find out how you can tell us about the title that impressed you this year — and you could win a year’s free FT Weekend digital subscription\n\nOther milestones competed for our attention. The upheavals of 1989 – above all, Tiananmen Square and the fall of the Berlin Wall – were the subject of numerous well-received books. Likewise the Napoleonic wars, with the looming bicentenary of Waterloo prompting publishers with an eye to the paperback to get their accounts of the battle out early. Maybe the same thinking lay behind the appearance this year of In These Times , Jenny Uglow’s assured social history of the British experience between 1793 and 1815, as well as two significant lives of the bicorned bogeyman himself by Andrew Roberts and Michael Broers.\n\nOccasionally, I did wonder whether some of the anniversaries might, in another time, have been allowed to pass unmarked. Should we really have got so excited about the 450th of Shakespeare’s birth, for example, especially considering that we only have to wait until 2016 for the 400th of his death? Was the passing of 45 years since the publication of Eric Carle’s children’s classic The Very Hungry Caterpillar a good enough reason to invest extra significance in the 2014 celebrations of “Very Hungry Caterpillar Day”? I regularly receive notifications of 30th, 15th, fifth, even seventh and third anniversaries – at which point, for me, the idea just seems to lose all meaning.\n\nJournalists, of course, should be wary of memorialising. But if anniversaries have become a kind of secular religion, scattering the calendar like saints’ days with their invitations to reflect on victories, heroes and cautionary tales, then perhaps that isn’t such a bad thing. Going back to Dylan Thomas last month around the time of the centenary of his birth, I was grateful for the reintroduction; however arbitrary the reason, I am richer for it. And in a world of distractions, why not welcome any inducement to read? As for Very Hungry Caterpillar Day, you can sign me up for that when the half-century comes around.\n\n…\n\nA preoccupation with the past is understandable right now: six years on from the financial crisis, western economies continue to struggle, populist forces are on the rise nearly everywhere and there is a pervasive sense of a social compact under pressure. Such concerns were at the heart of Political Order and Political Decay by Francis Fukuyama, who worried about the capture of the American state by special interests; they weighed on David Marquand in Mammon’s Kingdom , his modern take on the Condition of England question. They were there, too, in Greg Grandin’s The Empire of Necessity – a book that managed to be at once a compelling narrative of an 1804 slave revolt, a panoramic study of the Americas in an age of revolution and a meditation on the contradictions inherent in the idea of liberty itself, then and now.\n\nBut no writer spoke more directly to the zeitgeist than the winner of the 2014 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award, Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century arrived with a resounding thud in a fine English translation this spring to challenge a century of theory-driven economics with a degree of confidence seldom found outside the grandes écoles. The product of 15 years’ research, Capital in the Twenty-First Century pulls together disparate data from a number of different countries to argue that we are returning to levels of inequality last seen a century ago; and to propose, furthermore, that the tendency for the rate of return on capital to exceed the rate of growth (“r > g”) requires sharp taxation of wealth at the higher end if we are to preserve the levels of social harmony necessary for democracy to function.\n\nCritics of Piketty’s ideas as too extreme have ranged from Mervyn King to Myleene Klass (if the singer’s views on Labour party proposals for a “mansion tax” count); he has come under fire from the left, too, for a certain lèse-majesté with regard to the work of Marx; and some of his statistics have been questioned, notably in the FT. No one is going to turn to the literary editor for a decisive ruling on all of this but it seems fair to conclude that, while Piketty may not have settled the inequality debate, he has taken it into new territory: his opponents will be obliged to follow.\n\nAs Piketty disarmingly accepts, economics is only one guide to the pressing issues of the day; fiction can offer different insights and, on this particular subject, We Live in Water , Jess Walter’s tender, funny collection of stories about life on the wrong side of the tracks in the US northwest, was a fine example. The winners of the US National Book Award for fiction and Britain’s Man Booker Prize both looked squarely at war – the Iraq “surge” in the case of Phil Klay’s Redeployment , the Thai-Burma “death railway” in Richard Flanagan’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North , a historical novel that carried a powerful contemporary charge. Concerns about technology also seemed to play on the minds of novelists: social media in the case of Joshua Ferris’s Man Booker-shortlisted To Rise Again at a Decent Hour , the excesses of the security state in Peter Carey’s Amnesia .\n\nMeanwhile, literary non-fiction was taking a personal turn. Helen Macdonald’s H is for Hawk , an exhilarating journey around falconry and TH White, became the first memoir, and the first work of nature writing, to win Britain’s Samuel Johnson Prize. And autobiography was suddenly everywhere, evident in history, science, biography – even the novel, with the English translation of the third instalment in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle series often, like the first two, seeming to render the distinction beside the point.\n\n…\n\nIf this was a year for honouring the past and worrying about the present, it was also a time for speculating about what might be. Ursula Le Guin, in a passionate speech at the National Book Awards this month, welcomed her lifetime achievement award as a sign that writers of science fiction and fantasy – “realists of a larger reality” – were no longer the poor relations of the literary world. And as the prize shortlists and review pages showed, serious novelists have clearly shed any inhibitions they might have once had about venturing into the speculative: David Mitchell, Howard Jacobson, Chang Rae-Lee and Michel Faber all did so to great effect in 2014.\n\nElsewhere, the forces of progress captured the imagination. At the policy makers’ and business leaders’ forum of Davos in January, The Second Machine Age by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee generated a flurry of interest in the idea that robots could soon play a far bigger part of our daily lives – and render many of us unemployed in the process. Immortality was in the air, too, with the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari speculating in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humanity on what might happen if advances in bioengineering and artificial intelligence came together to vastly increase human lifespans and capabilities. Little surprise, in a world getting to grips with the logic of “r > g”, that we should not expect the benefits to be equally shared.\n\nBut it was the strength of writing about mortality that really struck me in 2014. To pick just a few examples, there was Do No Harm by Henry Marsh , a gripping portrait of a brain surgeon’s life and work; Being Mortal by Atul Gawande, the American doctor-writer whose first Reith lecture was aired by the BBC this week; and Marion Coutts’ remarkable The Iceberg , an account of the period between her husband’s diagnosis with a brain tumour and his death a little over two years later.\n\nHere is a subject where writers are clearly reflecting a shift in public attitudes – one evident in the phenomenal response to the British actress Lynda Bellingham’s memoir of her last years, which has topped the bestseller lists since its publication, selling more than 200,000 copies in less than two months. The 17th-century essayist François de La Rochefoucauld wrote that death was like the sun, neither to be looked at steadily. It is to our credit, surely, if that maxim no longer holds.\n\n——————————————-\n\nAward-winning authors, FT editors and columnist on the titles to remember this year\n\nLionel Barber\n\nEditor of the Financial Times\n\nCreativity, Inc , by Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace (Bantam/Random House), is a great book for anyone interested in inspiring and managing creative talent. Catmull, a PhD student from the University of Utah, nurtured the dream of making the first computer-animated movie. That dream translated into Pixar, the Oscar-winning California studio later acquired by Steve Jobs and Disney. Creativity, Inc – a finalist for FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year – explains the failures, the tensions and the ultimate accolades from Finding Nemo to Toy Story.\n\n…\n\nHelen Macdonald\n\nAuthor of ‘ H is for Hawk ’, winner of the 2014 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction\n\nTo Richard Kerridge, British reptiles and amphibians are creatures as exciting, strange and savage as any African lion. I loved his Cold Blood: Adventures with Reptiles and Amphibians (Jonathan Cape). It is not just a deeply informed natural history of these denizens of our countryside, but a paean to the small, the unloved, the forgotten and overlooked, all tangled up in a beguiling memoir of childhood, obsession and family life. Moving, careful, humane and beautifully written, it’s a book impossible to read without falling a little in love with the author and his scaly and web-toed subjects.\n\n…\n\nLucy Kellaway\n\nFT columnist\n\nAnybody who has an elderly parent must read Atul Gawande ’s Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine and What Matters in the End (Profile/Metropolitan). So must anyone who plans one day on becoming old themselves. The surgeon and writer forces us to look at mortality unflinchingly, telling us what is wrong with how we treat the old and dying – we revere their safety and we prolong life when it is cruel to do so – as well as explaining how we could do it better. He tells the story of awful deaths and better ones, including that of his own beloved father, without clichés, sentimentality or evasion. It is predictably grim; what is less predictable is that Gawande’s wisdom and humanity make its final message an uplifting one.\n\n…\n\nMartin Amis\n\nAuthor of ‘The Zone of Interest’ (Cape/Knopf)\n\nLawrence Wright has become a formidable technician of synthesis and narrative. After The Looming Tower (the story of September 11) and Going Clear (on the scientology racket), he has now produced the wonderfully readable Thirteen Days in September: Carter, Begin, and Sadat at Camp David (Oneworld/Knopf). The peace treaty goes on seeming wholly unattainable right up until the three men unscrew their fountain pens in the White House. Yet they signed, and the peace has held for 36 years.\n\nClive James’s Poetry Notebook (Picador/Liveright) reintroduced me to the intense pleasures of close reading. Although he has some hard – and funny – things to say about Ezra Pound, James is firmly committed to celebration. He reminds us that poetry is, or can be, “the most exciting thing in the world”. And this is what literary criticism, and literary pedagogy, should aim for: not to add a further encrustation of complexity, but simply to instil the readerly habits of gratitude and awe.\n\n…\n\nDavid Mitchell\n\nAuthor of ‘The Bone Clocks’ (Sceptre/Random House)\n\nMy favourite book of 2014 is Michel Faber’s novel The Book of Strange New Things (Canongate/Hogarth), about a Christian chaplain in the near future sent to a planet called Oasis; about his wife back on an Earth suffering economic and ecological collapse; about faith and its limits, love and its limits, neocapitalism and its endgame, and cultural relativism and its paradoxes. It is brainy, driven, funny, dark, idiosyncratic. Yes, The Book of Strange New Things is science fiction; yes, it’s literature; yes, writing this good illuminates life.\n\n…\n\nCaroline Daniel\n\nEditor of FT Weekend\n\nI admit. I am one of those devoted fans of Haruki Murakami. His latest book, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage (Harvill Secker/ Knopf), features a main character who is stalled, inert, made calm by trains running on time. Within pages, you are claustrophobically aware of how far he has stepped from his childhood self, fully alive in the company of his four closest friends; now he is sidetracked in a different, smaller life. A nascent relationship forces him to follow the threads of his own past, beginning a journey through friendships, love, jealousy, sexual awakening and ambivalence, with just enough surreal dream projections to keep it unbalanced.\n\n…\n\nKarl Ove Knausgaard\n\nAuthor of ‘Boyhood Island: My Struggle Book 3’ (Vintage/Archipelago)\n\nThe Austrian Peter Handke, no doubt one of the best and most influential authors in European literature of the past five decades, is back again with another masterpiece, the beautiful Storm Still (Seagull Books). It’s about history, family, language, war, life and death, and it’s done with such skill, originality, simplicity and insight that I want to cry, with joy and with sorrow – and with envy!\n\nDiary of the Fall by Michel Laub (Harvill Secker/Other Press) is another extraordinary book from 2014, as sharp as it is moving. I’ll never forget the grandfather’s rewriting of his life, from what it really was to what it should have been. In my world, this novel is already a classic.\n\n…\n\nAlan Johnson\n\nMP and author of ‘ Please, Mister Postman ’ (Bantam Press)\n\nAlison Light’s Common People: The History of an English Family (Fig Tree) was a revelation. Given the huge popularity of genealogy reflected in the success of TV programmes like Who Do You Think You Are? there’s bound to be an audience for this book. But this is no populist hobby manual. Light sets out to trace the lives of the virtually untraceable and in doing so uncovers the rich history of people who had no material wealth at all and therefore nothing to hand down to the genealogists.\n\n…\n\nElena Ferrante\n\nAuthor of ‘Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay’ (Europa Editions)\n\nThe only book that I read this year in English is The Lowland by Jhumpa Lahiri (Bloomsbury/Vintage). I had never read anything of hers, and it was a wonderful surprise. Lahiri skilfully shapes the political aspect of her story, effectively conveys the collision of two worlds, and vividly describes campus life in the United States. But what in my view makes the book memorable is the character of Gauri. In Italy the novel was titled La moglie – “The Wife”. It’s one of those rare cases where the publisher’s commercially driven decision to use an alternative title actually serves to call readers’ attention to a great literary accomplishment.\n\n——————————————-\n\nEconomics by Martin Wolf\n\nFragile by Design: The Political Origins of Banking Crises and Scarce Credit, by Charles Calomiris and Stephen Haber, Princeton, RRP£24.95/$35\n\nWe get the banking systems we deserve or, more precisely, that our political systems choose. The US has had 12 systemic banking crises since 1840, while Canada has had none. Better awareness of how the political forces work might lead to superior bargains. But this informative book does not leave the reader optimistic. It is hard to shift bad political equilibria.\n\n…\n\nMicroeconomics: A Very Short Introduction, by Avinash Dixit, OUP, RRP£7.99/$11.95\n\nMacroeconomics – the study of the economy as a whole – has got a bad reputation recently. But Dixit demonstrates in this accessible book that economists do at least know a great deal more than nothing about microeconomics: the study of markets, both their successes and their failures.\n\n…\n\nPolitical Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalisation of Democracy, by Francis Fukuyama, Profile, RRP£25/ Farrar, Straus and Giroux, RRP$35\n\nIn the second of two masterly volumes, Fukuyama shows how the difficult balance between the state, the rule of law and democratic accountability emerged, then developed and, more recently, started to decay in the west. This is a work of political science, not of economics narrowly defined. But the issues Fukuyama raises are of profound concern to economists, too, because economic institutions affect and are, in turn, affected by the political systems in which they operate.\n\n…\n\nStress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises, by Timothy Geithner, Random House Business, RRP£25/ Crown, RRP$35\n\nGeithner was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and then Treasury secretary through the worst years of the financial crisis. His book offers a lively account of what this felt like. Geithner also argues that the way the US handled the crisis, particularly its use of stress tests, is a model for the future. Sadly, he also believes that crises are sure to recur.\n\n…\n\nHow to Speak Money, by John Lanchester, Faber, RRP£17.99/ WW Norton, RRP$26.95\n\nMost people have little idea what economists and financiers are talking about. Lanchester, a best-selling author, has decided to remedy this by writing a provocative and personal reference book. His definitions are not always correct but they almost always offer an amusing start.\n\n…\n\nThrive: The Power of Evidence-based Psychological Therapies, by Richard Layard and David Clark, Allen Lane, RRP£20\n\nIn this important book, the authors – one an economist, the other a psychologist – demonstrate both the human and economic costs of mental illnesses. These are far and away the most destructive set of ailments to fall on the young and middle-aged. Yet mental illnesses remain undertreated, if not altogether ignored, by health systems. The case the authors make for ending this neglect is unanswerable.\n\n…\n\nEuropean Spring: Why Our Economies and Politics are in a Mess and How to Put Them Right, by Philippe Legrain, CB Books, RRP£12.99\n\nThis is a splendid book on the European malaise. Legrain argues compellingly that policy makers’ response to that crisis was and remains a disaster. He warns that the eurozone is still far from healthy and that the German example, which members are supposed to follow, is a delusion. He notes, too, that the UK’s recovery is built on sand.\n\n…\n\nHouse of Debt: How They (and You) Caused the Great Recession, and How We Can Prevent it from Happening Again, by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi, Chicago, RRP£18/$26\n\nProfessors Mian and Sufi argue that “economic disasters are almost always preceded by a large increase in household debt”. It is debatable whether this is a universal truth. But it is certainly true of the financial crisis of 2007-08. The authors argue, persuasively, for a shift from traditional debt towards contracts that share losses between the suppliers and users of finance.\n\n…\n\nWar: What is it Good for? The Role of Conflict in Civilisation, from Primates to Robots, by Ian Morris, Profile, RRP£25/ Farrar, Straus and Giroux, RRP$30\n\nMorris argues that war may bring peace, prosperity and progress. This is not always the case. Some war is simply destructive. But through war, more powerful and effective states emerge and these in turn have produced the security that then allows people to become more productive. The thesis is disturbingly persuasive. In a nuclear age, however, it is clear that the great powers will have to try something else.\n\n…\n\nCapital in the Twenty-First Century, by Thomas Piketty, translated by Arthur Goldhammer, Harvard, RRP£29.95/ Belknap Press, RRP$39.95\n\nThis was the blockbuster success of 2014 and was named the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year. Despite the controversies surrounding it, the book throws much light upon one of the most important questions in economics: what determines the distribution of income and wealth. With an abundance of data and some simple and powerful theories, Piketty has made an immensely important contribution to the public debate.\n\n…\n\nThe Dollar Trap: How the US Dollar Tightened its Grip on Global Finance, by Eswar Prasad, Princeton, RRP£24.95/$35\n\nIt is by now the conventional wisdom that the dollar’s primacy is coming to an end, with the Chinese renminbi the imminent successor. Prasad rejects this view. The role of the dollar as a unit of account and medium of exchange is indeed likely to be eroded, he agrees. But, he argues – to my mind, convincingly – the dollar’s role as a store of value has if anything been strengthened by the crisis.\n\n…\n\nThe Euro Trap: On Bursting Bubbles, Budgets and Beliefs, by Hans-Werner Sinn, OUP, RRP£25/$45\n\nSinn is the best-known and most trenchant German critic of the way in which the eurozone has managed – or, in his view, mismanaged – the crisis. He rightly identifies the roots of the crisis in the huge divergences in competitiveness that emerged in the years leading up it. This view from Germany shows just how difficult it will be to make the eurozone work successfully, even if one disagrees with some of the conclusions (which I do).\n\n…\n\nBusiness by Andrew Hill\n\nDragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance, by Julia Angwin, Times Books, RRP$27\n\nThis book would have been frightening and fascinating if Angwin had merely described the impact of internet surveillance on various innocent parties. What makes it riveting is her engaging story of a concerted and often difficult quest to protect her own and her family’s privacy.\n\n…\n\nThe Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies, by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, WW Norton, RRP£17.99/$26.95\n\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee started to lay out their vision of the challenges of the technological revolution more than three years ago. But their broadly optimistic book is still one of the best summaries of the debate about the impact of digital change on our future job prospects and prosperity.\n\n…\n\nHack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch, by Nick Davies, Chatto & Windus, RRP£20/ Faber, RRP$27\n\nThe case for calling Davies’s tour de force a business book (like the two books above, it was a finalist for FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year) lies in its revelations about the structure, motivation and governance of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Much more than a retelling of the UK’s inquiry into phone-hacking, it is a sharp guide to the causes and profound consequences of the scandal.\n\n…\n\nShredded: Inside RBS, the Bank that Broke Britain, by Ian Fraser, Birlinn, RRP£25\n\nOf two excellent recent books about the implosion of Royal Bank of Scotland (the other is Iain Martin’s Making it Happen, published last year), Fraser’s is the darker, deeper and ultimately more satisfying version. It is given added weight by the author’s evident, and justified, anger at the way in which one bank brought the British financial system to the brink of catastrophe.\n\n…\n\nThe Boom: How Fracking Ignited the American Energy Revolution and Changed the World, by Russell Gold, Simon & Schuster, RRP$26\n\nThis often fascinating account of the rise of “fracking” is the ideal book for readers still wondering what to make of the phenomenon. Gold recounts some compelling tales of communities and individuals whose lives have been transformed, for good or ill, by the latest resource boom.\n\n…\n\nA Bigger Prize: Why Competition Isn’t Everything and How We Do Better, by Margaret Heffernan, Simon & Schuster, RRP£14.99/ PublicAffairs, RRP$27.99\n\nHeffernan’s burning sense that our obsession with competition is undermining the potential benefits of co-operation and collaboration illuminates this book, a thought-provoking companion to her earlier polemic, Wilful Blindness. She spares nobody, pointing out in detail how competition can lead to inferior results – and genuine suffering – in business, sport, education and scientific research.\n\n…\n\nThe Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, by Walter Isaacson, Simon & Schuster, RRP£20/$35\n\nIsaacson deserved the plaudits he received for his biography of Steve Jobs but The Innovators was the work he interrupted to write about the Apple co-founder.

Here he identifies four great cultures – European, Islamic, Chinese and American – each with a distinctive approach to shaping the rest of the world. The book’s message is a plea to achieve a global balance of power based on “Westphalian” principles, defined as “a practical accommodation to reality, not a unique moral insight”.\n\n…\n\nBending Adversity: Japan and the Art of Survival, by David Pilling, Allen Lane, RRP£20/ Penguin Press, RRP$29.95\n\nThis year has seen dramatic economic reforms in Japan as a dynamic prime minister struggles to break a cycle of decline.

No. Ain’t nutt’n iambic bout dis.”\n\n…\n\nHold Your Own, by Kate Tempest, Picador Poetry, RRP£9.99\n\nTempest follows her Ted Hughes Prize-winning Brand New Ancients with a bold retelling of the myth of Tiresias. In a voice at once inviting and challenging, erudite and incongruous, the 28-year-old south Londoner confirms her position as one of literature’s most remarkable millennials.\n\n…\n\nTravel by Tom Robbins\n\nThe Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World, HarperCollins, RRP£150\n\nEarly atlases were status symbols as much as navigational tools, and with global mapping now available at the click of a mouse, they are becoming luxury items once more. The first Times Atlas was published in 1895; the latest is only the 14th edition. Updates include thousands of new place names, changed borders and melting glaciers, but the key attraction remains the same as ever: the chance to let the imagination roam over deserts, mountains and exotic cities.\n\n…\n\nDown to the Sea in Ships, by Horatio Clare, Chatto & Windus, RRP£20\n\nAs the western world prepares for its annual carnival of consumerism, Clare’s book is a reminder that global trade depends on an industry that is all but invisible to the public. In this lyrical account of two great voyages by container ship (from Felixstowe to LA, and Antwerp to Montreal) Clare paints an intimate portrait of the sailors and their working conditions.\n\n…\n\nThe Emperor Far Away: Travels at the Edge of China, by David Eimer, Bloomsbury, RRP£20\n\nTurning his back on Shanghai and Beijing, Eimer heads for China’s hinterlands – the sometimes lawless regions along the country’s 22,000km of land borders where the strictures of the Communist party seem distant. Some 50 ethnic minorities – 100m people – live in these regions and Eimer aims to give a voice to their grievances against the Han majority.\n\n…\n\nRising Ground: A search for the Spirit of Place, by Philip Marsden, Granta, RRP£20\n\nPrevious books have taken Marsden to far-flung parts of Ethiopia and Russia, but having moved to Cornwall, he sets out on a journey through the county on his doorstep. He investigates its rich history, from Neothilic monuments to the artists of St Ives. Perhaps most intriguing is that he finds traditions of paganism alive and well.\n\n…\n\nSport by Neil O’Sullivan\n\nO, Louis: In search of Louis van Gaal, by Hugo Borst, Yellow Jersey, RRP£9.99\n\nRelations between the British press and Manchester United’s feted but fiery Dutch manager have so far been notable only for an uncharacteristic respect on their part and an equally unlikely restraint on his. As Dutch football writer Borst’s love-hate portrait of Van Gaal makes plain, this state of affairs is unlikely to last.\n\n…\n\nPlayed in London, by Simon Inglis, English Heritage, RRP£25\n\nSports historian Inglis’s compendium of facts, figures, stories, street signs and photos is the perfect present for sport-loving Londoners. He takes us from Henry VIII’s Whitehall tennis courts to modern “colosseums” such as Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, via the drill halls, billiard halls and sports clubs that have shaped leisure time in the capital.\n\n…\n\nThe Second Half, by Roy Keane with Roddy Doyle, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, RRP£20\n\nAs a successful and controversial footballer, Keane did nothing by halves. No low-key ghostwriter for his new memoir, then, but a Booker Prize-winning co-author. Doyle duly employs dead-on literary ventriloquism to illuminate the person behind his fellow Irishman’s unforgiving public persona.\n\n…\n\nWounded Tiger: A History of Cricket in Pakistan, by Peter Oborne, Simon & Schuster, RRP£10.99\n\nWhen Pakistan was created in 1947, cricket was a game for the middle classes in Karachi and Lahore; today it is played in the remote, conflict-torn Swat valley and the country has produced some of the world’s great players. All this despite damaging political interference and corruption scandals. “Nobody seeking to understand that amazing country can ignore Oborne’s compelling book,” ruled the FT’s umpire.\n\n…\n\nThe Forbidden Game: Golf and the Chinese Dream, by Dan Washburn, Oneworld, RRP£12.99/$18.99\n\nUS journalist Washburn weaves colourful narratives to document the rising popularity of golf in China. Which would seem unremarkable were it not for the fact that distrust of this formerly banned “bourgeois” sport remains high and, a decade ago, central government banned the construction of new courses in a bid to stamp out corruption.\n\n…\n\nFood by Tim Hayward\n\nThe Virtues of the Table: How to Eat and Think, by Julian Baggini, Granta, RRP£14.99\n\nBaggini, a practised demystifier of philosophy, takes on the issues with which “foodies” torture themselves. He is never dry or over-academic, leavening reason with wit. Several writers have attempted philosophies of food. This philosopher does a better job and with more humour.\n\n…\n\nA Year at Otter Farm, by Mark Diacono, Bloomsbury, RRP£25\n\nYou can take your pick of dozens of books about people who have set up photogenic smallholdings and are prepared to share their glorious lifestyles. Diacono is no dilettante, though, and this is the one to pluck out from the rest.\n\n…\n\nMake Mine a Martini: 130 Cocktails & Canapés for Fabulous Parties, by Kay Plunkett-Hogge, Mitchell Beazley, RRP£14.99\n\nLike an over-friendly drunk, memoirs of “my life in booze” usually get boring quickly. Plunkett-Hogge, though, flits lightly and tantalisingly through a glamorous life in 1950s Bangkok and later in the film and music industries. The recipes are enticing.\n\n…\n\nMade in India: Cooked in Britain: Recipes from an Indian Family Kitchen, by Meera Sodha, Fig Tree, RRP£20\n\nAny book on another culture’s cuisine rides a fine line between authenticity and the realities of cooking it here. Sodha dances along the line, evoking the exotic but delivering extremely achievable recipes. A charming book.\n\n…\n\nGardens by Laura Battle\n\nThe Writer’s Garden, by Jackie Bennett, photographs by Richard Hanson, Frances Lincoln, RRP£25\n\nFew of the authors and poets featured here could be described as horticulturalists (“most of the writers in this book employed gardeners”, Bennett admits) but they all found inspiration in garden landscapes. Contemporary photographs are juxtaposed with archive shots – Beatrix Potter at Hill Top Farm, for example.\n\n…\n\nThe Gardener’s Garden, Phaidon, RRP£49.95\n\nAll the old favourites are included here along with many, many more. This enormous, picture-heavy tome, which covers 250 of the world’s most exceptional gardens, has a western bias but is strong on the Middle East and Asia, from the 19th-century Iranian masterpiece Bagh-e Shahzadeh to the Tokachi Millennium Forest in Japan.\n\n…\n\nMeadowland: the Private Life of an English Field, by John Lewis-Stempel, Doubleday, RRP£14.99\n\nFor a year Stempel immersed himself in the wildlife of a field on his Herefordshire farm. The result is a beautifully written record in which, for all the detail, the author remains a realist. The meadow always has been a managed environment: hay must be harvested and rabbits controlled.\n\n…\n\nCrime by Barry Forshaw\n\nThe Silkworm, by Robert Galbraith, Sphere, RRP£20\n\nWe mustn’t hold against Robert Galbraith the fact that he’s really mega-selling JK Rowling. This second entry under her crime-writing nom de plume is every bit as assured as its predecessor, and once again features one-legged sleuth Cormoran Strike.\n\n…\n\nMalice, by Keigo Higahino, translated by Alexander O Smith, Little, Brown, RRP£12.99\n\nJapanese crime fiction is an esoteric taste but this is a compelling mystery. Nonoguchi finds the corpse of a fellow writer; but as he had designs on the man’s wife, do we trust his story?\n\n…\n\nThe Inspector Maigret Omnibus 1, by Georges Simenon, Penguin, RRP£16.99\n\nIt may be cheating to place a work by the late Simenon among the best of the year, but his Maigret books are being republished in new translations and are comprehensively better than most current crime entries. This omnibus includes the very first outing for the pipe-smoking Gallic sleuth Pietr the Latvian.\n\n…\n\nThe Bone Seeker, by MJ McGrath, Mantle, RRP£16.99\n\nMcGrath’s female Inuit hunter/detective Edie Kiglatuk is an Arctic guide who knows every inch of the Alaskan forests. The Bone Seeker bristles with a powerful evocation of the frigid landscape.\n\n…\n\nFalling Freely, As If in a Dream, by Leif Persson, translated by Paul Norlen, Doubleday, RRP£18.99\n\nThere is plenty of life in Nordic noir, as Persson reminds us. British writers who complain about the attention given to the Scandinavians should pick this one up and see why that is.\n\n…\n\nScience Fiction by James Lovegrove\n\nSand, by Hugh Howey, Arrow, RRP£7.99\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic world over-run by deserts, intrepid divers plunge into the dunes to retrieve treasures from the cities buried below. Sand shows that the success of Howey’s Wool trilogy was no fluke. This is a superior SF thriller, both slick and gritty.\n\n…\n\nBête, by Adam Roberts, Gollancz, RRP£18.99\n\nA mordant, satirical thought-piece in which animals are fitted with artificial intelligence chips, enabling them to speak. Roberts’ fascinating, discursive riff on Animal Farm features a grubby, self-lacerating protagonist and lashings of wry humour.\n\n…\n\nAnnihilation/Authority/Acceptance, by Jeff VanderMeer, Fourth Estate, RRP£10/£12.99/£12.99\n\nVanderMeer has long been a critics’ favourite but with his Southern Reach trilogy – all three volumes published in the same year – he has hit sales gold as well. Area X is a zone of Florida blighted by an inexplicable catastrophe, becoming a locus of weird happenings. Haunting, surreal and bold.\n\n…\n\nThe Martian, by Andy Weir, Del Rey, RRP£7.99\n\nThe SF book of the year, Weir’s debut is a tense, unbearably gripping survival story about an astronaut stranded on Mars with only his wits, scientific acumen and dark sense of humour to keep him alive. Brilliant.\n\n…\n\nChildren’s Fiction by James Lovegrove\n\nEl Deafo, by Cece Bell, Amulet Books, RRP£13.99/£6.99\n\nA memoir about growing up with hearing loss, told in graphic novel form with anthropomorphic animal characters, El Deafo is refreshingly unsentimental and lacking in self-pity. Bell is honest about the challenges her disability has posed but finds grace in even the worst setbacks.\n\n…\n\nJane, the Fox and Me, by Fanny Britt and Isabelle Arsenault, Walker Books, RRP£15\n\nHélène is a lonely, bullied schoolgirl who draws consolation from Jane Eyre. A stay at summer camp brings a new friend in this masterly, evocative, delicately rendered graphic novel from two Québécois creators.\n\n…\n\nThe Imaginary, by AF Harrold, illustrated by Emily Gravett, Bloomsbury, RRP£12.99\n\nWhat happens to imaginary friends once they’re forgotten or the person imagining them dies? In this Gaimanesque fantasy they either fade away or must seek a new companion. Spirited and darkly witty.\n\n…\n\nValentine Joe, by Rebecca Stevens, Chicken House, RRP£6.99\n\nPerfectly timed for the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war comes this touching transtemporal romance in which a modern-day girl visiting Ypres finds her life intersecting with that of a boy soldier at the front.\n\n…\n\nYoung Adult Fiction by Suzi Feay\n\nA Song for Ella Grey, by David Almond, Hodder, RRP£12.99\n\nA masterly retelling of the Orpheus myth, transposed to Northumberland. Lyrical prose is matched with equally beautiful pages – white on black for the descent into the Underworld.\n\n…\n\nFifteen Bones, by RJ Morgan, Scholastic, RRP£6.99\n\nIn this exciting and chilling account of gang culture in schools, introverted Jake befriends a damaged and dangerous girl with an awful secret. Throbs with authentic menace (Morgan is a London teacher).\n\nAs Red as Blood, by Salla Simukka, translated by Owen Witesman, Hot Key Books, RRP£7.99\n\nPacy Finnish noir with a punky heroine who has more than a whiff of Lisbeth Salander. But Simukka cleverly overlays a very modern plot – drugs, crime kingpins, prostitution – on to traditional fairytale motifs.\n\n…\n\nLockwood & Co: The Whispering Skull, by Jonathan Stroud, Doubleday, RRP£12.99\n\nA second outing for Stroud’s trio of ghost detectives as they investigate the grave of a twisted Victorian scientist, pitting their wits against their biggest rivals, the snooty Fittes agency. Plenty of humour alongside the chills.\n\n——————————————-\n\nYour Book of the Year\n\nDo you agree with our choices?
