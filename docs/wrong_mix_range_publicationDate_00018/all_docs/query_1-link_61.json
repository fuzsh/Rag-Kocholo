Sign in to see the full collection.\n\nOften favorably compared to contemporaries Michael Chabon and Lev Grossman, New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Lethem won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In his post-apocalyptic novel Amnesia Moon, he introduces a young man named Chaos who can seemingly remake reality in his dreams. Setting off on a grand adventure, Chaos attempts to learn the secrets behind the world's destruction. \"Lethem tempers a liberal dose of quirky surrealism with interesting, believable characterizations and a compelling, imaginative story line.\"-Booklist"
