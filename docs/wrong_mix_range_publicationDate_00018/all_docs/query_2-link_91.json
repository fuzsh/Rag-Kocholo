        "text": "Description\n\nIn this alternate history of 1990, the world is dominated by three great nation-states. When the United States of Europe declares \"limited war\" on The Commonwealth of English-Speaking Nations, Lord Seeley Whitcombe must travel to Europe to find some way out of Armageddon. But the deranged European scientist, Richter, is determined to destroy most of mankind, leaving him in charge of the befuddled survivors. Can Seeley and Richter's lovely aide, Amelie, find a solution--before it's too late?"
