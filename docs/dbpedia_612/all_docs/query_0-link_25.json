        "text": "OPEC rules out deeper output cuts, set to cap Nigeria’s supply ISAAC ANYAOGU Muhammad Barkindo, OPEC’s secretary-general told reporters after an energy conference in Istanbul, Turkey yesterday, that the elite club of oil producers considers it premature to talk about deeper oil output cuts. His statement follows indications that the 14-member oil cartel, may rein in Nigeria’s oil production by limiting supply above the current 1.6 million barrels per day production, to shore up prices. Issam Almarzooq, Kuwait’s oil minister said that Libya and Nigeria which have boosted oil production since they were exempt from global cuts this year, may be asked to cap their crude output soon, in an effort to help re-balance the market.

That is a 900 percent increase. The note also stated that “Cardholders can now withdraw $300 daily (subject to monthly limit) on International ATM.” It however said the withdrawal commission has been reviewed upward by some 138 percent, to N1,000 per withdrawal from N420.” GTB’s share price was up 0.06 percent to N34.62 on Monday, in line with the banking index which rose 1.97 percent to 396.7 points, according to data tracked by <strong>BusinessDay</strong>. “This is probably the biggest indicator that the country’s foreign exchange situation is nor- malising,” said Johnson Chukwu, CEO of Cowry Assets, an asset management firm. “This will help take some speculative activities off the market and reduce demand pressure from people who had to source dollars at the black market because they couldn’t use their naira card for international transactions,” Chukwu said by phone. Other banks are likely to follow in GTB’s path by raising their own dollar limits in line with increased liquidity, said Ayodele Akinwunmi, head of research at FSDH Merchant Bank. “The dollar situation has improved and the banks have more dollars now,” Akinwunmi said by phone.

Etisalat Nigeria gets 3-week ultimatum to phase out brand identity ... as companies show interest to buy telecoms firm JUMOKE AKIYODE Etisalat has been given three weeks to phase out its brand in Nigeria, after its Abu Dhabi arm recently pulled out and new board members were appointed to run the affairs the company, following failed negotiations with its lenders over a missed payment of the $1.2billion loan taken out in 2013. According to reports on Reuters; the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to save Etisalat Nigeria from collapse after talks with lenders had failed, hence, Abu Dhabi’s Etisalat has terminated its management agreement with its Nigerian arm and given the business time to phase out the brand in Nigeria. Hatem Dowidar, Chief Executive Officer, Etisalat International, said in an interview that; “Etisalat Nigeria was to provide technical support, adding that it can use the brand for another three-weeks before phasing it out.” Industry watchers say there have been a few interests shown by companies willing to buy out Etisalat.
