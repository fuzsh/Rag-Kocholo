        "text": "MOVIES\n\nCheck out the movie schedule celebrating Black History Month\n\nMovies are 11am on Wednesdays in B Building\n\nFeb 1 In the Heat of the Night (1967)\n\nFeb 8 Hidden Figures (2016)\n\nFeb 15 Fences (2016)\n\nFeb 22 12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nWhy do we celebrate Black History Month?\n\nüîπBlack History Month got its humble beginning in 1915.\n\nIn 1915, thousands of African Americans traveled to Chicago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of emancipation in the state of Illinois. Among the visitors was Carter G. Woodson, a University of Chicago Alumni. Inspired by the celebration of Black achievement, Woodson created the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Eleven years later, ASNLH established Negro History Week in February 1926. (ASALH.org)\n\nüîπFrom Black History Week to Black History Month.\n\nThe association's Negro Achievement Week was so successful, the association had to build branches from the east coast to the west to deal with demand. Woodson saw this as a good sign and wanted to move from one week of acknowledging Black History to integrating Black History into year-long learning. Woodson claimed Black History was ‚Äútoo important to be crammed into a limited time frame.‚Äù In 1976, Black History Month was officially recognized by the U.S. government. (ASALH.org)\n\nüîπWhy February?\n\nThe reason Woodson chose to commemorate Black achievements in February is that Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass were both born in February. The birthdays of these two men were already celebrated by many Black communities thanks to the part Lincoln and Wilson had in Black advancement. Therefore, Woodson wished to keep the celebration of Black achievements within already established traditions within the Black community. (ASALH.org)\n\nThe importance of Black History\n\nüîπBlack History IS American History.\n\n157 years before the United States Constitution was signed, the first group of enslaved Africans was brought to Fort Monroe in Virginia. From that point on, enslaved people would be the cornerstone of the American economy and infrastructure. Yes, Black History is given a pedestal in February, but that does not mean it is separate from the history of this nation as a whole.\n\nüîπBlack History is under attack.\n\nAs we are writing this article, Trump announced ‚Äì as part of his 2024 presidential campaign ‚Äì that he will withhold federal funding from any school teaching CRT or ‚Äúany other racial content.‚Äù This comes on the coattails of DeSantis‚Äôs months-long battle of erasing Black History and Black districts.\n\n‚Äã\n\nüîπ ‚ÄúWhat happens to any of us, anywhere in the world, had better be the business of us all.‚Äù\n\nYou might be thinking, this all sounds horrible, but we don‚Äôt live in Florida, we live in Washington. But as the quote from Mamie Till states above, we are more connected than we‚Äôd like to think. Thankfully, we do live in Washington where, just five days ago, Governor Jay Inslee signed Executive Order 22-04. The order commits all executive branch agencies to commit to an anti-racist governing system. The Office of Financial Management stated its commitment towards this equitable governing on its website and is looking for feedback from the community on how to achieve a more equitable future.

She was an anti-war activist and member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, who gained the wrath of President Johnson and was harassed for years by the FBI. A vocal advocate of LGBT rights.\n\nAsked about her following from and affinity for the gay community, she said, \"We're all rejected people, we know what it is to be refused, we know what it is to be oppressed, depressed, and then, accused, and I am very much cognizant of that feeling.

To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.\n\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.\n\nNeedful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the shuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.\n\nNo human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\n\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity and Union.\n\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.\n\nDone at the City of Washington, this Third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-eighth.\n\nBy the President: Abraham Lincoln\n\nWilliam H. Seward,\n\nSecretary of State\n\nCognitive Benefits of Gratitude and\n\nthree techniques to cultivate gratitude.\n\n1. Exercise\n\n2. Meditation\n\n3. Writing\n\n‚ÄãAfrican American Women in US History\n\nZora Neale Hurston\n\n‚Äã\n\nZora Neale Hurston, born in Alabama 1891, produced four novels, several plays, numerous short stories and essays. Her most famous novel, Their Eyes were Watching God, turns 80 this year.\n\nShe was educated at Morgan State University and Columbia, spoke several languages, and obtained a degree in anthropology. Much of her writing is a result of her studies, since she explored the folklore of the Caribbean and the American South. She wrote articles for newspapers, which helped to free an African American woman who had killed a white doctor because of continued sexual abuse.\n\n‚ÄãShe was not a fan of Roosevelt and the New Deal, and she called Truman the ‚ÄúButcher of Asia‚Äù because of his decision to release the Atom Bomb on Japan.\n\nAlice Walker re-discovered Hurston in the 70‚Äôs, and her work was revived as she became more and more well-known. Her most famous novel, Their Eyes were Watching God, is a story of a woman who sought love at four different times in her life.\n\nZora Neale Hurston‚Äôs life was rich and complicated. A literary giant, her religious and political beliefs were uniquely her own.\n\nAfrican American Women in US History\n\nSojourner Truth\n\n‚ÄãBorn in 1797, Sojourner lived a long, amazing life. She was born into slavery, but escaped with her infant daughter in 1826. She went to court two years later and recovered her son, the first African-American woman to win such a case against a white man.\n\nShe gave herself her famous name after she became convinced that she was following God‚Äôs calling. During the Civil War, she gave a speech entitled ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt I a Woman?‚Äù The speech was written down by a different person with a Southern accent that Sojourner did not speak, since she was brought up by a Dutch family in New York. During the war, she helped recruit Black soldiers to fight for the Union Army. After the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants for former slaves.\n\nShe fell in love with a slave from a neighboring farm, but they were caught by her owner, who savagely beat the young man, whom she never saw again. She later married an older man, a slave named Thomas. They had five children.\n\nA converted Methodist, she started traveling and preaching about the abolition of slavery. Once, someone interrupted a speech and accused her of being a man. Truth opened her blouse and proved that she was a woman.\n\nShe preached for women‚Äôs right to vote. She dictated her memoirs which were published under the name, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth, a Northern Slave. She became famous for her speeches against abolition and as a suffragist. Whenever there was dissent during one of her speeches, Truth would break into a religious song, and it usually quieted the crowd.\n\nSojourner Truth is best remembered for her great oratory for the causes she believed in.\n\n‚ÄãAfrican American Women in US History\n\nIda B. Wells\n\n‚Äã\n\nIda Bell Wells-Barnett, an African-American journalist, newspaper editor, suffragist, sociologist, feminist, and early leader in the Civil Rights movement, was one of the founders of the NAACP.\n\nAfter her parents died, she kept her family of younger siblings intact by becoming a teacher, while her grandmother watched the younger children during the day.\n\nHer major activist role was documenting lynching in the United States, the often-used way to control or punish Blacks who competed with whites. Her first active role as a protester was when, in 1884, she refused to give up her seat on a train. She was dragged out off the train and hired an African-American lawyer to sue the railroad. After the lawyer was paid off by the Railway, she hired a white attorney and won her case with a $500 award. But the railway company appealed to the Tennessee Court, which overturned the lower court‚Äôs decision.\n\nThe murder of friends drove Wells to document lynchings, and she learned that Blacks were lynched for failing to pay debts, not giving way to whites, competing with whites economically, and being drunk in public. She found no evidence to back up the claim that Black men were being punished for abusing white women.\n\nWells continued to investigate lynching, despite threats on her life. Her book on the subject contributed to making the public more aware of the horrors of lynching.\n\nAfrican American Women in US History\n\nHattie McDaniel\n\nBorn in 1895, Hattie McDaniel was an actress, singer-songwriter, and comedian. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first ever given to an African American. She was also the first Black woman to sing on US radio. She appeared in over 300 films and received screen credits for 80. She has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for radio and one for motion pictures. In 1975, she was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, and in 2006, became the first Black Oscar winner on a US postage stamp.\n\nWhen she joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1934, she landed more frequent film roles ‚Äì at first, in cameo performances like ‚ÄúBojangles‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Little Colonel.‚Äù By 1935, she was playing prominent roles in ‚ÄúChina Seas‚Äù and ‚ÄúShow Boat,‚Äù singing a verse in ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Help Lovin‚Äô Dat Man.‚Äù\n\nShe was friends with many of Hollywood‚Äôs most famous stars. The role she is best known for was as ‚ÄúMammy‚Äù in ‚ÄúGone with the Wind.‚Äù\n\nShe began being criticized by the Black community for the roles she accepted to stay in favor of the Hollywood elites. When she was chosen for ‚ÄúGone with the Wind,‚Äù the NAACP fought to have certain racial epithets removed and some of the historical accuracies corrected. They believed that the film celebrated the slave system.\n\nWhen she received her Academy Award, she gave one of the best acceptance speeches in the Academy‚Äôs history.\n\n‚Äãby Mieke Tazelaar\n\nRead more at Wikipedia\n\nTheGardensGazette.org\n\nBlogs > Culture and Society: Hattie McDaniel\n\nRevised March-14-2017\n\nAfrican American Women in US History\n\nBessie Coleman\n\n‚Äã\n\n‚ÄãBorn to a sharecropper family in 1892, Bessie Coleman, one of 13 children, was the first woman of African American and Native American descent to earn an international pilot‚Äôs license. She attended a small segregated school and spent one year at Langston University, then went to work in Chicago, where she became fascinated with stories of pilots returning from World War I.\n\nNeither women nor blacks were being accepted in US flight schools, so she received financial backing to go to France. She learned to fly in a Nieuport bi-plane. She found out that she could fly in air shows in the US, because there was no prejudice at those events, and she became a daring barnstorming stunt flier. She went back to Europe, and met with Anthony Fokker, a distinguished Dutch aircraft designer, and received additional training.\n\nIn the US, she became known as ‚ÄúQueen Bess, the world‚Äôs greatest woman flier.‚Äù\n\nSadly, she was killed in a plane crash while testing a new aircraft in 1926 so her dream of establishing a school for African American fliers was never realized.\n\n‚Äãby Mieke Tazelaar\n\nImage source: Wikipedia\n\nFurther reading: Wikipedia\n\nTheGardensGazette.org\n\nBlogs > Culture and Society\n\nBessie Coleman\n\nRevised March-9-2017\n\nAfrican American Women in US History‚Äã\n\nJosephine Baker\n\n‚Äã\n\n‚ÄãJosephine Baker was an African-American expatriate who renounced her US citizenship to become a French national. Her early career as an erotic dancer at the Folies Bergere in Paris earned her fame all over Europe, as she performed in a costume consisting of only a girdle of bananas. In later performances she sometimes appeared with Chiquita, her pet cheetah. She became a favorite of famous Americans living in Europe, namely Ernest Hemingway, who called her ‚Äúthe most sensational woman anyone ever saw.‚Äù\n\nShe refused to perform for segregated audience in the United States, but contributed greatly to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n‚Äã\n\nShe became renown for her role in the French Resistance during World War II. Using her charm, she gathered information about German troop locations from people she met at parties. Josephine received the French military honor, the Croix de Guerre, and was given an official honor by General Charles De Gaulle.\n\nShe did not attain the popularity in the United States that she so enjoyed in Europe, and, heartbroken, she returned to Paris.\n\nLater, she was received well here for a while, but, ever an activist for people‚Äôs rights, she fell out of favor again with certain people, and was revered by others.\n\nIn 1963, she spoke at the March on Washington at the side of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. After King‚Äôs assassination, Coretta Scott King went to the Netherlands, where Baker now lived, and asked her to lead the Civil Rights Movement. She declined for the sake of her children.\n\nby Mieke Tazelaar\n\nImage source: Wikipedia\n\nFurther reading: Wikipedia\n\nTheGardensGazette.org\n\nBlogs > Culture and Society\n\nJosephine Baker\n\nRevised March-07-2017"
