        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\nFocusing on Lagos Business School (LBS) in Nigeria, this book explores the impact of strong alumni leadership on university excellence in Africa. Strong leadership is crucial to the success of educational institutions and great importance is placed on their effective governance and management. However, many institutions fail to realise the positive impact that a strong alumni body can have on university excellence. Drawing on definitions and theories of leadership, the author seeks to establish the significance of alumni in enhancing a university’s growth and development. Providing comprehensive analysis of LBS, this book is a unique resource for leaders of educational institutions, as well as those studying and teaching in African business schools.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nPALGRAVE STUDIES IN AFRICAN LEADERSHIP Series Editor: Faith Ngunjiri\n\nALUMNI LEADERSHIP AND UNIVERSITY EXCELLENCE IN AFRICA The Case of Lagos Business School\n\nHenry O. Onukwuba\n\nPalgrave Studies in African Leadership Series Editor Faith Ngunjiri Moorhead, MN, USA\n\nAlmost every continent has solid representation in the field of leadership studies except for Africa, despite its rapid growth. A groundbreaking series, Palgrave Studies in African Leadership fills a gap in the production of knowledge and scholarly publishing on Africa and provides a much needed outlet for the works of scholars interested in African leadership studies around the world. Where many studies of leadership in Africa focus solely on one country or region, this series looks to address leadership in each of the different regions and countries of the continent. This comes at a time when business and academic discourse have begun to focus on the emerging markets across Africa. The wide-ranging scholarly perspectives offered in this series allow for greater understanding of the foundation of African leadership and its implications for the future. Topics and contributors will come from various backgrounds to fully explore African leadership and the implications for business, including scholars from business and management, history, political science, gender studies, sociology, religious studies, and African studies. The series will analyze a variety of topics including African political leadership, women’s leadership, religious leadership, servant leadership, specific regions, specific countries, specific gender categories, specific business entities in Africa, and more.

Henry Onukwuba deserves to be congratulated for the first-class job he has done in writing this book. The book is a very rich learning resource for alumni officers, based on both a good knowledge of international and African best practices and the rich personal experience of the author, who was for seven years the alumni director of the Lagos Business School, and was therefore personally immersed in the story he is now telling us. As he himself says, this is not an official document of the Lagos Business School or Pan-Atlantic University, and in fact, I myself, who was previously the dean of the School and am now vice chancellor of the University, do not agree with all the points Mr Onukwuba makes in this book. Nevertheless, this is only to be expected, as it is practically impossible for two human beings to agree in all respects in their understanding of a complex social reality. Still, I think that the idea of using the experience of the Lagos Business School Alumni Association as a case study to learn from and as a focal point to organise the rich information Mr Onukwuba wants to convey proves very useful and gives the book a highly practical character. The Lagos Business School has always given great importance to its relationship with its alumni, and this makes its experience especially relevant for anybody with an interest in alumni associations. vii\n\nviii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nA trait of the book that I find very appealing is the large space provided to documenting the very rich experiences of some key actors in the history of the Lagos Business School Alumni Association. That will certainly be useful for anybody seeking practical answers to real problems. I found it especially interesting to note how the contributions of these actors complement each other. Thus, to give only one example, while Mr Gabriel Diejomaoh stresses the social aspects of relating to alumni, Ms Bunmi Afolabi lays special emphasis instead on the importance of technology in managing the affairs of a contemporary alumni association. Bringing together all the complementary contributions of the different people Henry Onukwuba interviews for this book will give the reader a richly textured picture of the issues at stake. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to professionals in this field and all those who are contemplating entering it. Pan-Atlantic University Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nJuan Manuel Elegido\n\nPreface\n\nThe first part to the Kenyan Universities Act describes a “university” as “any institution or centre of learning by whatever name called, or however designated, having as one of its objects the provision of post-secondary education which intends to offer or is in fact offering courses of instruction leading to the grant of certificates, diplomas and degrees.”1 In Nigeria, the Act establishing the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, lists the principal officers of the university as the chancellor, pro-chancellor and council; vice chancellor and senate, the faculties, schools and so on, and also “all graduates and undergraduates; and all other persons who are members of the University in accordance with provision made by statute in that behalf.”2 Therefore, the alumni who are graduates of the School are part and parcel of the university system. For a holistic understanding of the effectiveness of the leadership of universities and its impact on academic excellence, the part played by the alumni and its leadership needs to be investigated. But despite the upsurge in the alumni support for higher education in institutions, the research on alumni relations has mainly focused on either the individual or the institutional characteristics which determine one’s willingness to donate funds as an alumnus (Bruggink and Siddiqui 1995; Weerts and Ronca 2007; Taylor and Martin 1995; Clotfelter 2003; Gaier 2005; McDearmon and Shirley 2009). The part that effective alumni leadership plays in galvanising this individual alumni involvement is the main focus of this book. Robert Davies states categorically that “every great school has one thing in common: a great alumni association.”3 At the heart of the role of the alumni relations unit in a university is that of engaging the alumni (Kowalik 2011; Pastorella ix\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\n2003). This can be done through various means and by various activities. But effective leadership of the alumni body is central to the success of these engagements. We begin with perspectives on leadership by some top Nigerian leaders. We then look at the alumni leadership models globally and in some African institutions, before discussing the Lagos Business School (LBS) model. We use LBS as a case study. LBS is the business school of the Pan-­ Atlantic University, Lagos, Nigeria. The School has, since its establishment in 1991, maintained a healthy link with its alumni. In 2015, it became the first business school in West Africa to receive a double accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Association of MBA (AMBA). Leaders of the university and the alumni association interviewed in this book attribute a major part of this success to the strong support from the alumni. I must, however, say that presented in this book are my personal articulations of the LBS alumni story, rather than an official account of the School’s experience. The responsibility for any error or any misrepresentation of actual facts therefore is solely mine. Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nHenry O. Onukwuba\n\nNotes 1.

The more that part of action is outside what the follower would have normally taken, the more the impact of leadership. The chapter draws from the author’s personal experiences and perspectives of seven top Nigerian leaders to list some of the characteristics of a good leader. A leader must SPARKLE—must be sincere, principled, accomplished, reasonably guided, knowledgeable and exemplary, and must exhibit the principle of “laddership” in his role as a leader. The leader must be other-centred, rather than self-centred. Onukwuba concludes by listing seven core characteristics of “Honourable Leadership,” and the essence of attaining level 5 leadership. Keywords Leadership • SPARKLE • Leadership perspectives • Honourable leadership • Level 5 leadership\n\n1.1 Introduction: What Is Leadership? Leadership is basically the ability to influence others to do what you wish them to do. Chester Bernard defines leadership as “the ability of a superior to influence the behavior of a subordinate or group and persuade them to\n\n© The Author(s) 2018 H. O. Onukwuba, Alumni Leadership and University Excellence in Africa, Palgrave Studies in African Leadership, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78289-8_1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nfollow a particular course of action.” Harry Truman, 33rd president of the United States, once defined a leader as “the man who has the ability to get others to do what they don’t want to do, and like it.” The more what you wish people to do is far from what they ordinarily would have wished to do, the greater the task of leadership. “Leadership involves a type of responsibility aimed at achieving particular ends by applying the available resources (human and material) and ensuring a cohesive and coherent organisation in the process” (Ololube 2013). Many people believe leaders are not born but made (Amanchukwu et al. 2015). However, good leadership requires the skill to negotiate and work with others to achieve goals. Good leadership is developed through a never-ending process of self-study, education, training and the accumulation of relevant experience (Bass and Bass 2008). The task of leadership throughout the ages has been that of enablers of development or progress in society, communities and organisations. Therefore, the ultimate task of leadership in any given society is that of transformation. Effective leadership should not only transform societies and institutions, but must also have the capacity to transform individuals by providing role models for these individuals (Mbigi and Maree 1995). In an alumni session given at Lagos Business School (LBS) in 2013, Rtd Gen Martin Luther Agwai, formerly Nigeria’s Chief of Defence Staff, and who, as commander of the combined United Nations–African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur, once led one of the biggest peacekeeping operations in the world with approximately 20,000 troops and 6000 police under his command, listed the prerequisites for a good leader as “courage, knowledge, good planning skills, patience, ability to communicate effectively, a sense of service and credibility.” He picks credibility as the most important of the virtues. Credibility, he says, engenders the followers’ confidence in the leader, enabling the leader to win the hearts and minds of the people he is working with. He also picks out courage as one of the defining characteristics of a good leader, perhaps speaking from his military background. For him, for a leader to be credible, he must not show fear or despondence in times of challenges or danger. A leader, he also says, must be able to cultivate friendship and build relationships with his people; he must give his people the space to develop and expand their thoughts, if not, they will be like, as he put it, “a six-inch mature shark that has grown up in a one-foot aquarium.”\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n3\n\n1.2 Personal Experience Leadership to me is about service and self-giving. I have had my own little experience with leadership, and I currently teach leadership to participants at the Owner Manager Programme (OMP) and Senior Management Programme (SMP) at LBS. I grew up knowing that leadership does not necessarily reside with the person with the formal authority. Leadership is not about titles, although titles sometimes confer the access to leadership. Leadership is not synonymous with headship, be it a household, community, corporate entity or public establishment. When a leadership gap exists and the titleholder is not filling this gap, the natural leader emerges, title or no title. My mother was easily the leader of our household and my father confessed he was happier as a supporter. All pretences to leadership which my father may have held ceased with the outbreak of the Nigerian civil war. My mother simply took control of the situation and led the family out of danger and possible death on multiple occasions. By May 1966, there was a lot of political tension in the country; there were rumours of war, and tension could be felt in the air. There were reported killings of Igbos residing in Northern Nigeria and retaliatory killings of the Hausas and Fulanis in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. Igbos were no longer safe, not even in Lagos, the nation’s capital, and were leaving the city in droves. So, the next day after my parents had brought me to church as a newborn for thanksgiving, my family undertook the flight to safety from Lagos to Enugu, the then capital city of East Central State of Nigeria. The journey to Enugu by road was long and tortuous, and we had to travel light, as there was little space for luggage and household property. Essentially, we had to leave our possessions behind as we escaped to Enugu. At least we were safe in Enugu, we thought. We settled in New Haven, Enugu, and started rebuilding our family life from where we left it in Lagos. It meant new household items, new schools, new clothes … and a new life. We were a family of eight—my parents, my five siblings (aged between 10 years and two years) and me (less than a month old!). The following year, the civil war was declared. The Biafran Army fought bravely, but was soon losing ground to the Nigerian troops. There were rumours that the Nigerian Army had entered Enugu. My mother sensed danger and pleaded with my father that we should run. Despite her trying hard, my dad was obdurate: “Enugu cannot fall, it is the stronghold of (Odumegwu) Ojukwu1; the Biafrans will crush the Nigerians,” he argued. It was a big argument, but\n\n4\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nmy father stood his ground. In the end, my mother took an unprecedented decision: At the risk of a split in her marriage, she huddled all of us in a chartered taxi out of Enugu and down to Umuna Okigwe in Imo State, her brother’s abode, leaving my dad behind. He did not permit her to take any luggage with her, so she grabbed the one item she could lay claim to—her sowing machine—and a few of our clothes tied together in a wrapper. We made a stopover in Onitsha, our paternal hometown, to let them know where we were headed. Umuna Okigwe was relatively peaceful and safe at the time. A few days after we left, the Nigerian Army invaded our Enugu home. My father was tying a wrapper under a white singlet and sipping his favourite morning tea when the soldiers invaded our house. Luckily for him, he escaped through the back door, leaving all our property behind. He had no money on him, but he somehow found his way to Onitsha and eventually reunited with Mum and the rest of us one month later. After that incident and the reunification, my dad left most of the important wartime decisions to Mum, like when and where to relocate as the Nigerian Army kept advancing into the Biafran territory, and the operation of a food canteen in the Biafran Army Mess, which turned out to be a life-saving venture. My leadership journey started in my secondary school days, when, as the youngest and the smallest member of my class, I had the mantle of leadership of the class, as the class prefect, thrust upon me. My major duties were ensuring that the teachers kept to their respective teaching appointments and ensuring that my much bigger classmates were present and well behaved during classes. Therefore, I was the noisemakers’ list taker. It was a “thankless” job, with no visible benefits whatsoever, unlike the school prefectship, which attracted double food rations at the canteen. Nevertheless, it was an interesting leadership tutorial for me, one that endeared me to the school principal, my teachers and my classmates. That was the launch—and the confidence booster—for me into the sphere of leadership, both in and out of the office—mostly out. One of my most impactful leadership roles—impactful both to me and to the people I led—was when I became the president of the Catholic students during my university years at the University of Jos. We had assembled for the usual Sunday Mass. At the end, the incumbent president announced that, due to the demands of his medical studies, he would be relinquishing his position as the leader of the Catholics in the “Village” hostel of the University. I tried to argue that that was not a good enough reason to relinquish such an important responsibility since serving God\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n5\n\nwould even help him in his studies. Despite my seemingly fine arguments, the guy held his ground. The congregation eventually decided to elect a new leader at that moment. There were calls for nominations, and the outgoing president, perhaps to spite me for stubbornly opposing his intention to quit, decided to nominate me for the position. I resisted, since I was not prepared for the task, but the congregation refused my pleas. An election was called, by a show of hands, and I was overwhelmingly elected the new president. It took me a while to realise that my status in the hostel had changed from this election; I now had to be careful about the kind of students’ parties I attended and how I behaved at those parties and about the kind of friends I kept and how I related with them. I was just about to start the third year of my political science studies. I, however, took up the challenge, and together with a very dedicated team, we went to work. We strengthened the various worshipping communities—sub-hostels—and introduced a kind of “pastoral” council made up of leaders of these communities. We held regular meetings and, for the first time, organised a fundraising ceremony from which we raised funds to buy necessary items for our Saturday and Sunday Masses—things like Mass servers’ habits, altar clothes, a lectern and so on. I recall that, at the launching, to the surprise and amusement of our guests and the students, we presented a funny drama in which I played the part of a mother of two recalcitrant children. By the time the school year ended, the population of our worshippers and the attendance at other community-level activities had more than doubled. The following year, being my final year, I had left the Village hostel to the more prestigious “Naraguta” hostel—the “big boys” hostel. There, the Catholic community was made up of students from three big hostels: the Naraguta for males, the “Babylon” hostel for females and the “Abuja” hostel, a lower-priced hostel, for both males and females. I had thought I would just “hide” in that big crowd and face my final-year studies, but I was fished out and made the president of that big Catholic community— mostly on account of what we were able to achieve at the Village hostel. One of our greatest achievements in the new community was planning the very first Harvest and Thanksgiving Sunday. It was an elaborate ceremony, preceded by weeks of planning. The various worshipping units tried to outdo one another on the harvest gifts they would bring to the altar. Students wore their national costumes and Sunday best. In the end, we had munificently gifted items and money to support the worshipping community and buy some musical equipment for our choir. Again, the\n\n6\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nresult was a big leap in the number of our worshippers. We even had the privilege of celebrating daily Masses (I think, four times a week), courtesy of our then Chaplain, Rev Fr. Cletus Gotan. These experiences, plus others such as being elected a Member of Parliament of the students union in my very first year, and being de facto Sports Director of the school’s students union (the election was inconclusive and subsequently cancelled) and captain of my faculty football team, gave me useful practical tutorials on leadership. In all of this, I think what worked for me was first having a vision, then my courage and a can-do spirit. The events we had in the church, such as the launching—first time by a Catholic students’ body— and the maiden Harvest and Thanksgiving Day (which was to become an annual event), required a lot of courage and self-belief. Many of the students were not sure we could pull these through, but they joined in when the coast became clearer, and they enjoyed the trip. A leader must first convince oneself before trying to convince others. It is the level of the leader’s self-belief or self-conviction that will determine the motivational level of the followers. Leadership is also about teamwork and interpersonal relationship. A leader is the first among equals—he provides direction but must be ready to listen to his people and relate with them as friends. Many of my fellow students that worked with me in these two worshipping sub-chaplaincies at school were very dedicated to our course. Together, we achieved the transformation of these communities, and as we did that, many of the Catholic students that had joined other faiths in the campus began to return to the fold. Another thing that helped me was my courage to stand for what I believed in—not right all the time, but at least you know where I stand—and being principled, even to a fault. I remember one Sunday that the priest did not show up for Mass (it was a rare occasion) and we decided to have “service without the priest,” which is allowed in the Catholic Church under such special circumstances. During the service, we decided to do an offertory and use the money to provide some more benches for our worshippers as the population had grown. The students were told what the money was to be used for, so they were a bit more generous. Later, we had our church committee meeting with the university chaplain presiding. He was not pleased with what we did with the offertory money, and he latched on that to educate us on how not to take any decision about church matters—no matter how trivial—without his approval. Everybody seemed to have acquiesced, but I could not, so I openly spoke out, in spite of my much older lecturers trying to hush me. I challenged the chaplain’s wisdom in thinking that the students were not\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n7\n\nintelligent enough to use their initiatives and do things in different but better ways for the chaplaincy. The chaplain must have been shocked by my outburst, but he kept his cool; he stood up and made a statement I will never forget. He said, “the Catholic Church is not democratic and will never be,” and took his leave. That brought the meeting to an abrupt end. I was, however, not apologetic at the time about what I said—though perhaps I was on how and where I said it. Nevertheless, that incident brought us (the chaplain and me) closer together, and we sort of began to mutually respect each other. I recall that after I had left the school, I wrote him a long letter from my National Youth Service camp in Abia State, first, to formally apologise for that incident and the disrespect to his office, but to also reiterate—from my experience as president in both sub-chaplaincies—how much the students could offer if given the right space to operate. He was very grateful for that letter and actually began to be less controlling of the students’ handling of affairs in the chaplaincy from then on. The day I returned to the school for my graduation ceremony, the Catholic community treated me like a hero. I was given a special slot by the Chaplain to address the students during Mass and share my experiences at, and benefits from, serving the Lord, benefits which included my claiming the coveted Best Graduating Student in Political Science prize despite my seemingly very busy church schedule. Leadership is also about empowerment. A leader must allow his people to exhale. The typical profile of the Owner Manager Programme participant at LBS is owner of a business with about 30 or fewer employees, with an annual turnover of less than 100 million naira (USD 327,000). One common thread among owner managers is their unwillingness to let go of their firms and their sometimes suffocating grip on the way things are run in their organisations. Having toiled to set up their businesses, most times under challenging circumstances, they find it difficult to transition from managing to leading. They tend to delegate but without authority and to micromanage. Many of them believe that if they let go, their companies would not survive, or would be less effective. However, that is wrong—unless they are saying that they have incapable people—in which case the fault is the owners’—either the recruitment was faulty or the employee was not developed appropriately for such roles. The good thing, though, is that many leave the class with a different mindset, and begin, even if cautiously, to allow their people the freedom to think and to act. At graduation ceremonies or during alumni functions, you would see many come to you with good tales of how they\n\n8\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nnever realised the capabilities of their associates until they gave them the opportunity to take charge of things.\n\n1.3 Perspectives from Top Nigerian Leaders This book is about alumni leadership and university excellence. In the course of our interviews with some current members of the university leadership and past presidents of the LBS Alumni Association—accomplished leaders in their own rights—we decided to ask them to share their thoughts on leadership and what has helped them specifically on their respective leadership journeys. Some of these thoughts are replicated here: Prof Fabian Ajogwu is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and Professor of Corporate Governance at LBS; he is an ex-secretary of the LBS Alumni Association, and a long-standing member of the Pan-Atlantic University Governing Council: On leadership, I try to ascribe to the acronym SPARKLE2; I can’t remember the origin now. It says that the leader must SPARKLE—must be sincere, must have principles, be accomplished, be reasonably guided, must be knowledgeable, should apply the principle of “laddership” and must be exemplary. A leader must be sincere; he needs to say things as the sees it. He must try to deal with issues and people while maintaining his principles. He doesn’t take decision A because he is James, and decision B because she is Mary. His decision must be the same—principled. He must also be accomplished relative to the people he seeks to lead, because he must attract respect, and be able to project himself. So he must be accomplished and stand tall. If he is leading the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, for instance, he has to be an accomplished pharmacist. If he is leading lawyers, he has to be an accomplished lawyer, because he is projecting himself as “primus inter pares”—first among equals. The leader should be knowledgeable; he must understand the association he is leading and its terrain. So, I think that when you apply this to the alumni leadership, this person must understand, first of all, the school, the unique nature of the school, the role of the alumni association generally and the unique nature of LBS alumni. He must understand the market place in Nigeria to know the things he should project and where the school needs help and sustenance. Then, there is the principle of “laddership,” and it is tied to being accomplished and leading by example. You know what happens to a person doing the pole vault when he scales the target—he comes crashing down immediately; as soon as he lets go of the pole, he crashes down. So too, I think, in laddership, the leader needs to continuously know that life is a ladder. When he attains a height through climbing\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n9\n\na ladder, he doesn’t fall off because he is going step by step. But when he attains a sudden catapult upward, gravity corrects the situation and brings him back to where he belongs. He must also be able to lead by example; his life should be consistent with the things he professes. Once there is a disconnect, you have a broken leadership. Some say the R is for “reasonable guide,” but by the time you have all of these, you are already reasonable. I think that if a leader were to embody these things, the most important being the first and the last qualities—he must be sincere and must lead by example—people will forgive him for any other flaws … What has worked for me is Sincerity and Simplicity. I wouldn’t claim that I live by example, that’s a self-assessment. What I have tried to do is be simple, taking things one day at a time. I have tried in all ways to progress by “laddership.” I have never won a lottery in any way; even the church lottery I don’t win; I don’t know why, not even the bazaar consolation prizes (laughs). So I never believed in attaining any heights through sudden means. So, one should try and be sincere, and that involves respect for the people one works with, knowing that they are all part of a team. Personally, I sometimes do lose my cool; I get very upset when things don’t work out. But I always have time to cool off, call the person and apologise. I prefer a person who will let me know when he is upset to a person who would bottle it up and keep it in. I like feelings to come out, and we confront them and move on.\n\nPat Utomi is a Professor of Political Economy at the Pan-Atlantic University and one of the early directors of LBS. He is the Founder of the Centre for Values and Leadership (CVL), and a two-time presidential candidate in the Nigerian general election. He hosts a quarterly Colloquium in Lagos, Nigeria, that he calls “Leader Without Title”: Essentially, for me, one of the things that we need to emphasise the most about leadership is that leadership is other-centred behaviour rather than self-centred. There is a sense in which people equate power with leadership, power which is the ability of A to make B do what B ordinarily would not otherwise do—the Robert Dahl definition of power. Well, that is formalised authority. But great leaders don’t need a title; they don’t need authority to influence things towards a desired direction. So, essentially, leadership boils down to the sacrificial giving of oneself to the advancement of the common good. Critical to that process is that people who offer leadership must have knowledge, because people don’t follow you if they fear you don’t know where you are going. The second part is that leaders must have a sense of service, and that is sacrificial leadership. So, true leadership is the ability to work with others, with a vision through knowledge and with a sense of service towards others. Many times, leadership in our environment tends to be\n\n10\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\ntransactional—I am a leader, you do this for me, I do this for you. But the leadership that makes a lasting difference, and deploys influence to change for good people’s prospects, is often transforming in nature. So, transformational leadership is at the core of the kind of leadership that can change people to change the world in one particular direction.\n\nBola Adesola is the Managing Director of Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria and current president of the LBS Alumni Association—the first woman to hold that position.3 She was also appointed to the Transition Committee of President Mohammadu Buhari of Nigeria after his election into office in 2015: Many things have helped me (on my leadership journey). I think one is purposefulness. For me it is about knowing where you are going. It is only those who know where they are going that ever get there. So I think purposefulness in life… Some of it is my background; I learnt a lot from my parents, the humility of my mother and her enterprise. She was a serial entrepreneur; she would start businesses and run them down, but was always coming up with ideas. She was driven by relationships. My father was a very distinguished lawyer, but one who was also very combative. He was one of the finest advocates of his time. His approach was that every time he appeared in the court, his job was to educate the judge. He was well known for first making the case for the other side, and then making his own case and silencing everybody. So that sort of dialectical engagement and inquiry, I think, helped me, as did the fact that I virtually grew up in a court—we used to go to court, my sister and I, from the school, sit at the back of the Supreme Court, do our homework in its library, surrounded by law books. So I think from that early age, we saw how personal effectiveness was important, but being relational was also key. I think what has helped me too is the fact that all along in my career, I had both known and unknown mentors and sponsors. I remember in 2015, when I had just got home on a Friday, and I found a letter saying that I should be part of Buhari’s Transition Government—I don’t know them, I am not in their party, I am not a politician, but I was invited. Believe it or not, at least five people claimed credit for it… So whether true or not, they were sort of the unknown. And throughout my career, it has been the same… So I have had mentors whom I have approached from time to time: male, female, different professions, young, old; and I have also had people who had an interest in me. I think it helped—it has propelled me. For me, I think what is also important in my career up to even now is preparation and planning, and that’s part of the purposefulness. It is “I know where I am going and what\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n11\n\nto do, and I prepare, I plan and use the resources around me …” In any field that I want to embark upon, purposefulness, I think, has helped me. I would also say excellent followership. I think that is important, because we cannot talk about leadership without followership. I believe, for the people I have worked with, that I have tried to be as committed to ensuring their success as was possible: lifting up the hands of my boss or my leader, contributing and so on. I think also, because I have got the right exposure, I have also benefitted by having great people work with me, excellent people work with me. And that helped because I think it is not about leadership from the front or back or whatever. I think it is about having a great circle of influence, whether they are people below or above you. Also, what helped me in my career is the fact that I try and make an impact. I always say that you can’t keep a lid on me wherever I am, and that’s why I think that it has happened that in places where I have worked, I just got a phone call saying: “Are you interested in this?” Because, I would have made an impact on the circle of influence, not just within the organisation, but externally… I think part of it is wherever you are, you have got to make an impact. I say to some of the young ones today, even when you attend a conference, ask a question, even in a conference hall or whatever, ask a question! Begin to create your own exposure such that it will make it easier for people to help you, and I think that has helped me and I think surrounding all these, in the backdrop of all these, I think it is principles and values from my background and from my parents. It is not about everything being black and white. There are grey areas, you know where and when there is a grey area, and I think that has helped me tremendously, everywhere.\n\nBabatunde Dabiri was Managing Director of Sterling Bank of Nigeria Plc and an ex-president of the LBS Alumni Association. He has been involved in setting up and providing pioneer leadership in three financial institutions in Nigeria and has also served in leadership positions in the public sector: One (leadership quality) is, I would say, self-belief—what the Americans call “self-starting.” You must be someone who believes you can do something, and not just wait to be told to do it; but would want to do it, to create something. It is also very useful to have a vision; you want to have an impact in whatever you do. So, if you have a vision of what you think you should be, and you are able to get up and say, I am going to do this, then it is very useful. If you don’t have that self-belief and you don’t have a vision of what you should be, you may not be a good leader. For me, personally, I helped set up three banks from scratch: Prime Merchant, Fountain Trust and, ultimately, Sterling Bank. We started from scratch, in a sense, from a piece of\n\n12\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\npaper. So, if we did not have confidence that we could create something, we wouldn’t have been able to do it. And then, you must be able to motivate and carry people along. For me, there is a difference between a manager and a leader. As a leader, you motivate, you get the best out of people; you look at them and put them where they seem to have the best skills. One of my main successes in that area concerned a lady who was my Internal Auditor in Magnum Trust Bank. I called her one day and said to her, “I want you to do HR” (human resource function), and she said, “Me, HR management? What’s my business?” I said, “Look, I see your skills”—one of the things she did was playwriting and production. I said to her, “I see your skills with people, you know how to move people, motivate them, and you are always writing this or that.” So I told her, “you are going to try this out. By the time you get to a certain level as a manager, you can do anything. You must be able to just go and head something and do it properly.” In the end, she did it for us at Magnum Trust; she was also our first Head of HR in Sterling Bank, and then she left after a couple of years, and one day she was in charge of ten thousand people at First Bank. And she sent me a text which I can never delete, saying, “I don’t know what you saw in me that you thought I could do this, and now I am the head of HR of the biggest bank in Nigeria, setting up the academy, doing this or that.” A leader must be able to “smell” people; see their best attributes, and be able to motivate them to realise their potential. That’s just one example. In all modesty, I can count how many MDs of banks have passed through me, and to this day, if I make a call they react (positively), because I let them reach their full potential. So three things I would say: one is self-belief; two is you must have drive, you must want to do something; three, you must motivate people, motivate them to get the best out of them, and for them to realise their full potentials.\n\nWole Oshin is the Founder and Group Managing Director of Custodian and Allied Group. Custodian Group is the second biggest financial services group in Nigeria by size, and includes general insurance, pension fund administration, trusteeship and life insurance subsidiaries. Wole was president of the LBS Alumni Association from 2014 to 2016: A leader should be confident and sufficiently knowledgeable about the workings of his business. He should be a visionary with a strategic outlook. A leader should spend time in scenario analysis—the “What if” situations. A leader needs energy and must sometimes get his hands dirty while leading by example. A leader should be confident enough to delegate and empower. He must be able to spot talent and get things done through them without\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n13\n\nabdicating his responsibility. I have been fortunate to work with empowered great minds in the last twenty years. Empowerment for me is not abdication; it is a partnership. Leadership is therefore a partnership with the empowered.\n\nUdeme Ufot is the Group Managing Director of SO&U, a leading marketing communication company in Nigeria. He was also president of the LBS Alumni Association, from 2010 to 2012. A leader is a good listener and communicator. The patience to listen and understand before engaging helps the leader to get the facts, understand the issues, and probe for more information, before proffering solutions. I believe I am a good listener and communicator. I think I have also been blessed with the ability to win and sustain mutually beneficial relationships while retaining the trust and confidence of people I interact with. I have been fortunate to maintain a track record of performance in every responsibility I have been given while maintaining a strong reputation for integrity, loyalty and humility.\n\n1.4 Conclusion Lee Ellis (2012) lists seven core behaviours for what he calls “Honourable Leadership.” They are: 1. Tell the truth, even when it is difficult—avoid duplicity and deceitful behaviour. 2. Treat others with dignity and respect—take the lead and show value to others. 3. Keep your word and your commitments—ask for relief sooner than later if necessary. 4. Be ethical—operate within the laws of the land, the guidance of your profession, and the policies of your employer. 5. Act responsibly; do your duty and be accountable—own your mistakes and work to do better in the future. 6. Be courageous—lean into the pains of your fears to do what you know is right even when it feels unnatural or uncomfortable. 7. Live your values—be faithful to your spiritual core, your conscience and your deepest intuitions. Jim Collins (2006) developed the concept of level 5 leadership, which he argues is what leaders need to transform their organisations from good\n\n14\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nto great. He defined level 5 leadership as “blending genuine personal humility with intense professional will.” This, he goes on, will make the leader “modest and wilful, shy and fearless.” Though Collins argues that this is a rare combination, I must say that I have seen a bit of this in the leaders I have interacted with in my various capacities over the past ten years here at LBS.\n\nNotes 1.

The author starts by defining who an alumnus or alumna is. From a survey of some African universities and business schools, he reveals that different institutions have different definitions of who their alumni are. The chapter discusses the roles of the alumni to include other forms of support beyond financial support. Onukwuba examines the central role of alumni associations in engaging the alumni and galvanising the needed alumni support. Onukwuba identifies three broad models of alumni leadership. Under the global models, the chapter summarises the Yale, Tuck, IIT Illinois and IESE structures. In Africa, the chapter looks at the UCT and Strathmore models.

The term “alumni” is intrinsically tied to institutions and individuals who have either attended and/or have graduated from the institution (Neufeldt 1996).

The “alumni” of a university refers to people who have passed through a formal education in the institution. In Lagos Business School (LBS), these categories of people are distinguished between “students” and “participants,” the students being those who are in the degree classes—the executive, modular and the regular (full-time) MBA classes, while the participants are those that are in the long general executive programmes. Many universities and business schools have different criteria for qualification as an alumnus or alumna. University College, London, in 2012, for instance, considered as alumni everyone who has done at least 100 days of study in the school, whether the person actually graduated or not.1 A survey was carried out among participants at the 2016 conference of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE2) Africa, held in Nairobi, Kenya, to find out how they classified their alumni. Seventy per cent of the respondents said everyone who passed through the school, regardless of the duration of their studies, qualifies for alumni status. However, such persons must not have been rusticated from the school during their time there. In this category are University of Ibadan, Nigeria, Strathmore Business School, Nairobi, Kenya and Vaal University of Technology, South Africa. Twenty per cent of the respondent schools would accord alumni status only to those who successfully completed the long programmes. This is where LBS, University of Pretoria (South Africa) and Africa University (Zimbabwe) belong. However, the definition of “long” programmes is not a universal one. Ordinarily, a programme five days or shorter would be considered a short programme. Finally, 10% of the respondent institutions would consider only those that successfully completed the degree programmes as alumni.\n\n2.2 Roles of the Alumni The roles and contributions of the alumni cannot be neglected, especially the financial contribution. Actual alumni giving is a behavioural manifestation of their desire to give (Tom and Elmer 1994). For example, generous donations to various colleges and universities in the United States peaked in 2017, with US$ 43.60 billion in donations recorded (Council for the Aid to Education Report 2018). As we see, donations and fund raising may be basic roles of the alumni. But there are other roles of the alumni\n\nMODELS OF ALUMNI LEADERSHIP\n\n17\n\nthat are quite significant, such as the lending of experiences and expertise of prominent alumni to the boards of the association, which can help them formulate strategic plans for the improvement of the institution (Weerts 1998). Prominent alumni may stand as models and mentors to the young ones on their jobs and career path. Fogg (2008) argues that the enhancement of alumni recruitment programme provides a better investment than advertisement. As such, alumni relations programmes have been one of the preferred top priorities for some institutions across the globe. For instance, University of Virginia’s research invested over $8.7 million on alumni relations involvements, which included the equivalent of 81 full-­ time personnel (Weerts et al. 2010). Apart from financial support, alumni play some of these specific roles in academic institutions: • Helping the school carry out its mission in the wider society • Promotion of the school’s programmes to colleagues, family and friends • Student recruitment—assisting in the admission process by giving testimonials at students information sessions and being part of interview panels for prospective students • Policy influence—providing advice and guidance to the school on policy matters • Curriculum development—source of local case studies and teaching resources • Curriculum refinement—providing feedback to the school on the right curriculum and pedagogy; improving the teaching standards • Enhancing campus experiences for students—visiting faculty, guest speakers, special guests at student programmes; internship placements for students • Enhancing after-campus experience—employment and business links after graduation • Brand enhancement—acting as ambassadors of the school in the public space. So, apart from financial support, the alumni play other equally important roles in the support of their alma mater. Some of these roles, like helping the school achieve its mission in the wider society and helping to enhance the school’s brand, may even rank higher than the financial support received. For, of what use is a big magnificent school without a good\n\n18\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nname? Unfortunately, it appears there is a lot of emphasis on alumni fundraising to the detriment of exploring the other forms of support.\n\n2.3 Alumni Engagement According to Horseman (2011), alumni engagement is defined as “participation in any university-related activity that occurs after graduation, specifically volunteering or giving financially.” He argues that this conceptual definition of alumni engagement is to be regarded as only a phase of the broad concept of “civic engagement,” which is defined as part of social capital. Various reasons can be attributed to the donations of funds by the alumni; these could be emotional commitment to an institution, peer pressure or burden of wealth, or altruism and egoism (Mora and Nugent 1998). Irrespective of the varied motivations of donations to institutions, some higher institutions have actually channelled massive resources towards engaging the alumni; many of these institutions derive a major part of their operating budget from donations (Horseman 2011). For example, the Council for Aid to Education 2018 report shows that alumni giving ranked second behind foundation giving in 2017, with alumni giving 26.1% of the total gifts (behind Foundation’s 30.1%). Harvard University was the topmost fundraiser in 2017, raising USD 1.28 billion, follwed closely by Stanford University which raised USD 1.13 billion. As noted before, the charitable donations of alumni are an important contribution, but they are only an aspect of it. Various forms of engagement can be as volunteers for the institution’s programmes, providing political support, recruitment of students, formulation of strategic steps and directions, mentorship for the young alumni, service on the institutional boards and so on (Weerts et al. 2010; Farrow and Yuan 2011). Engagement of the alumni is critical to the growth and sustenance of any university or business school. Harrison et al. (1995) argue that the most significant factors that can help in explaining fund raising success in the institution involved is “how much the institution has invested in alumni activities, not only on events, but also on efforts channelled at communication and other viable programmes that can help the alumni association.” There are other possible factors that allow for alumni involvement, such as loyalty and emotional attachment to the alma mater (Beeler 1982), the act of recommending the alma mater to others (Okunade and Berl 1997) and information search about fellow alumni (Beeler 1982). A significant predictor variable of alumni giving is past giving, especially by\n\nMODELS OF ALUMNI LEADERSHIP\n\n19\n\nthe alumni who have made more generous donations (Lindahl and Winship 1994; Okunade and Berl 1997). It is important to acknowledge the fact that alumni associations play a significant role in engaging alumni and providing a connection between the alumni and their alma mater (Gill 1998; Arnold 2003). Thus, alumni association executives function as “friend-raisers” instead of just fundraisers (Newman and Petrosko 2011). According to the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), alumni associations build “lasting relationships with alumni in support of the institution, facilitating a bi-communicable pathway between institution and alumni, they leverage a remarkable voice on behalf of the institution and also maintain historical friendship which helps secure a promising future.” Alumni programmes build and augment the relationship among the students, former students, faculty, friends and other stakeholders (Newman and Petrosko 2011). The effectiveness of the models of alumni engagement may depend on the level of awareness of leaders of the institution. In other words, “institutions spend millions of dollars engaging alumni with the hope that they will become more active in supporting their alma maters. But, in many cases, campus leaders know very little about the impact of these efforts, the types of alumni most likely to serve the institution, and the range of ways that alumni support the institution” (Weerts et al. 2010, p. 347). Horseman (2011) argues that, in most cases, volunteerism is more appreciated and valued than a cheque. The level of volunteerism is positively affected by the quality of a personal-student experience, the prestige of the institution and any other investment owned in school. Some alumni associations, especially in European countries, are dues-­ based. Other alumni bodies do not require members to pay subscriptions, but rely on the voluntary and unrestricted annual giving and legacy gifts from their alumni to support the school. Newman and Petrosko (2011) examined possible factors associated with membership of university graduates in the dues-based alumni associations of their alma maters. Using logistic regression to analyse demographic variables such as age, gender, marital status, awareness of the alumni association, positive experiences and so on, they agreed with other researchers (Beeler 1982; Bruggink and Siddiqui 1995; Hanson 2000; Holmes 2008) that age or years since graduation predict alumni giving, indicating that the older the alumni are, the more likely they are to donate than the younger alumni. This giving affinity is strictly tied to income, which is a determinant of the degree of giving; thus there is a higher rate of donation for wealthier alumni (Bruggink and\n\n20\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nSiddiqui 1995; Clotfelter 2003). In summary, age and income act as predictors to alumni giving (Newman and Petrosko 2011). The other factor is the institutional characteristics, such as prestige and academic quality, which are also major factors that affect alumni giving. A greater perception of quality and prestige in their alma maters leads to a greater level of alumni giving (Baade and Sundberg 1996; Belfield and Beney 2000; Clotfelter 2003). Holmes (2008) argues that alumni support serves as a means of avoiding the decline in the institution’s academic quality so as to retain the prestigious perception of the institution and thus preserve the quality of the degree and certificates offered by the institution. Institutions need alumni who have contacts and connections that can help advance the institution; they also need the support of individuals who represent the many constituencies that make up the alumni body. 2.3.1 Engaging the Millennials Alumni associations are beginning to appreciate the fact that alumni have different interests depending on the stage they are in their life cycles. Alumni in their 30s may still be in the “growth-building” stage of their lives with their careers still ascending and with children still in the home. As a result, they may not have a great deal of time to devote to the activities of the association, unlike their older counterparts who are in a more “stable” period of their careers and thus may be able to set aside significant time to participate in the association’s affairs. The trend is to engage alumni in activities that fit best with where they are in their life cycles. Weerts et al. (2010) argue that the millennials, say, age 24–34 years, are the most active volunteers in the alumni engagement activities. The involvement of the young alumni or millennials earlier on may likely yield long-term engagement, in other words, forming, according to Romer et al. (2009), “the building blocks of social capital, including participation in group activities and stimulating interpersonal trust.” Horseman (2011) highlighted some reasons that avail the millennial generation as a peculiar one: (1) they are more technologically inclined than previous generations; (2) they are receptive to sharing of ideas on educational opportunities, to a greater extent; (3) they are accessible to the expendable wealth and place a priority on charitable giving; (4) they demand transparency and involvement; and (5) they opt for the choice of balance between work and life. According to Howe and Strauss (2009), millennials are unique and interesting in their own peculiar ways; thus, they deserve to be tended to.\n\nMODELS OF ALUMNI LEADERSHIP\n\n21\n\nAccording to Bola Adesola, such questions need to be asked while dealing with younger alumni: “What do they want? How do they want it? How do they want to be spoken to?” We suggest that further study be carried out on the potential roles played by the millennial generation in the improvement in the engagement of alumni with institutions.\n\n2.4 Models of Alumni Leadership Different universities and schools have different names for their alumni leadership body. For some, it is the Alumni Governing Board, or the Alumni Volunteer Board. Others call theirs the Alumni Executive Council; still others, the Alumni Board of Governors or Alumni Governing Council. Susan Dolbert (2002) identifies three models of alumni governance: independent, interdependent and dependent models. In independent alumni associations, the association’s chief executive or director reports to the board of directors or executive council, rather than an institutional officer. The alumni association receives no (or very minimal) funding from the institution or its foundation. The board determines direction of the association and approves the association’s budget. Interdependent alumni associations receive part of their funding from their institution, but the majority of their funding is self-generated— through dues, affinity programmes and other areas such as travel and merchandise sales. The association’s CEO reports both to the association volunteer board and to an institutional officer. Dependent associations are essentially university departments. They receive all or almost all of their funding from their institution and report exclusively to an institutional officer. They may have a volunteer board of directors, but the board is advisory rather than policymaking. Most often, the department is named Alumni Relations and is part of a larger development office. The model each university or school adopts would depend largely on its history and peculiarities.\n\n2.5 Global Models 2.5.1 Yale University Yale University has the oldest record of alumni activity of any American university, dating back to 1792, with the election of the first class officers. It later formed the first ever general alumni association in 1821, which\n\n22\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nseems to be the earliest on record (Sailor 1930). According to Yale Alumni History (2017) “Late in the nineteenth century, as Yale graduates sought each other’s company across the country, Yale clubs began to organise in the larger cities. Then, in 1890, the Yale Alumni Fund was chartered by the Yale Corporation. The Fund has since become the vehicle for the most successful giving record of any alumni body in history.” The Yale Alumni Board was later chartered in 1906 to create a central alumni group for interaction between the university and its alumni. But the board became too large and, consequently, ineffective, with well over 2000 members at a time. There was restructuring in 1969, leading to the formation of Association of Yale Alumni (AYA) and the creation in 1971 of the AYA Assembly. The AYA constitution was adopted by the Founding Board of the Association on August 11, 1972. The constitution, which was last amended in 2009, provides, among others, for a governing board of the association made up of 24 members—18 elected and 6 appointed. The board members are either elected or nominated at different times, six each year for the elected members and two each year for the appointed members. The board meets four times a year to discuss alumni programmes and consider reports from the university administration. The chair and vice chair, and the executive members (two or three) are elected from within the board. All members of the board, including the chair and the vice chair, shall serve (as board members) for only one term of not more than three years each. The chair’s and the vice chair’s tenures are two years each, while the executive members serve in that capacity for one year, re-electable for another one year. However, a member of the board, even if he/she is in his/her last year, can be elected to the position of the chair or the vice chair, in which case he/she would serve a new two-year term, extending his/her total tenure to four years. The vice chair can be elected to succeed the chair, just as the executive officers can aspire to the vice chair’s or the chair’s position. The chair and the vice chair, and the executive officers, are elected by a majority of the entire board and assume office on June 30. The constitution also provides for a non-voting executive director of the alumni association, who shall provide secretarial and administrative duties for the association. The executive director reports to the chair of the board. 2.5.2 The Tuck School of Business Tuck School of Business, according to Wikipedia 2018, is the oldest graduate school of business in the world. It is the postgraduate school of\n\nMODELS OF ALUMNI LEADERSHIP\n\n23\n\nDartmouth College, an Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, the USA. The University of Dartmouth is one of the oldest universities in the United States, founded in 1769. The business school of the university runs the oldest MBA programme in the United States, started in 1900. It, however, runs only the full-time MBA programme, no executive programme. By 2013, it had over 9000 MBA alumni, 15% of whom are non-US citizens and another 11% live outside the United States. The Tuck alumni association is not independent of the school. The school is supported in the running of the association by a number of advisory boards or councils. At the centre are the Tuck Advisory Board and the Tuck Alumni Giving (TAG) Executive Committee. In 2011, the school launched the Tuck European Advisory Board and followed that with the launch of the Tuck Latin American Advisory Board in 2012. A more recent addition is the Tuck Asian Advisory Board, launched in 2014. The boards or councils are run by alumni of the school in their respective locations and are established to help the school “attract top MBA candidates, enhancing career opportunities for students and alumni, and strengthening alumni and community connections. The boards are also expected to contribute to the school’s globally focused programming and curriculum.” There is also the 29-man (current count) Tuck MBA Council, established in 2002, which advises the school on MBA-related matters— admissions and curriculum development, students career and alumni services. Membership of the Advisory Boards and the MBA Council is by appointment. The members are appointed by the Dean of the school, based on their interest in the school, business pedigree and experience. According to Tuck Ambassador, Andrew R. Steele,3 Tuck is reputed to have an active alumni association, with alumni clubs in ten cities in the United States and in Shanghai, Tokyo, London, Paris, Seoul, Hong Kong, Toronto and Sao Paulo, as of 2013. The school enjoys a great deal of alumni support, with 70% of its alumni giving annually to the school, compared to about 20–30% average in most business schools. 2.5.3 Illinois Institute of Technology Illinois Institute of Technology is a private, technology-focused research university, founded in 1940 in Chicago from a merger of two nineteenth-­ century institutes—the Armour and Lewis Institutes (About Illinois Tech 2018). It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering, science, architecture, business, design, human sciences, applied technology,\n\n24\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nand law. The Alumni Association of Illinois Institute of Technology has a 25-person Board of Directors, at least four of whom are from the University’s Board of Trustees—the Board of Trustees is the institution’s governing body. The Alumni Association’s Board of Directors is the governing body of the institution’s alumni association, serving as the formal communications link between the alumni and the university. Membership is by volunteering and appointment. Article IX of the By-laws of the Illinois Institute of Technology stipulates the following responsibilities and expectations for members of the Alumni Association’s board (IIT Alumni Association Board of Directors Position Description 2018): • Members must attend at least two of the three regularly scheduled board meetings. • Members must serve on at least one committee of the board. • Members of the Board serve three-year terms and may serve up to two consecutive terms. • Make a personal financial contribution in the minimum amount of $1000 per fiscal year to the institutional area of the member’s choice. In addition to these formal responsibilities, board members are also asked to participate in the life of the university and the Alumni Association by: • Attending events coordinated by the Alumni Association and the Office of Alumni Relations on a quarterly basis. • Nominating at least one individual for an alumni award each year. • Mentoring or visiting with students each school year as scheduling permits. • Serving as ambassadors of Illinois Institute of Technology. This includes providing information to others about Illinois Institute of Technology’s commitment to its mission, supporting and articulating decisions made by the university, and providing information on current university initiatives and issues. Board members should be well informed about the university’s mission, policies, goals, programs, and priorities. • Advocating for and influencing others to support the university by identifying people who have the means and willingness to support Illinois Institute of Technology and encouraging them to become involved in university projects and programmes.\n\nMODELS OF ALUMNI LEADERSHIP\n\n25\n\n2.5.4 IESE Business School, Barcelona IESE Business School Barcelona is, according IESE official website (2018), the Financial Times–ranked best overall school in executive education in the world for three consecutive years—2015 to 2017. Established in 1958, it is the business school of the University of Navarra. The IESE alumni association was founded in 1959, immediately after the graduation of the first IESE executive class, senior management programme. Today, the alumni association has over 40,000 senior executives as alumni of the school. The Executive Committee runs the affairs of the association. The Executive Committee comprises the president, two vice presidents, 22 board members, and one secretary. It reports to a larger Governing Board, which is made up of presidents and secretaries of the classes that have successfully graduated from a programme at the school. To provide better service to alumni, the association is divided geographically into regional chapters, each of which has its own board. The presidents and vice presidents of the association’s regional chapters are also members of the Governing Board. The association’s executive body, that is, the Executive Committee, manages the association’s resources in accordance with set criteria and objectives. The Executive Committee is responsible for approving the association’s budget and presenting its annual financial statements to the Governing Board. The Governing Board meets once a year to approve the annual report and accept proposals and suggestions from the members in attendance and alumni in general.\n\n2.6 The African Models 2.6.1 University of Cape Town, South Africa The University of Cape Town (UCT) was founded in 1829 as the South African College, a school for boys. It became a full-fledged tertiary institution in the 1880s, and in 1918, it was formally established as a university, offering both undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The university distinguishes between convocation alumni and non-­ convocation alumni. An individual who successfully obtains a UCT degree is a convocation alumnus or alumna, while non-convocation alumni are individuals who have spent at least one full year of study at UCT. However, all are considered members of the alumni association. The university, as of 2017, had 160,000 alumni, and is growing.\n\n26\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nThe alumni association is governed by the UCT Advisory Board. The board meets three times in a year, including an Annual General Meeting (AGM). The board comprises 17 members, as listed here: • The President of Convocation of UCT • The Vice chancellor of UCT or his/her nominee • Six members of UCT Council, elected by convocation • Seven members who are elected at an AGM for a two-year tenure • Other members that may be co-opted by the board to fill vacancies that may arise between AGMs. The Alumni Relations Office, which coordinates the alumni relations activities, is part of the university’s central Development and Alumni Department. The development office manages the advancement functions of the school. The Head of Alumni Relations is a full-time and permanent position. The Head of Alumni Relations is recruited by a search committee comprised of representatives from within the Development and Alumni Department, as well as from the wider university and Human Resources Department. The alumni association is not autonomous of the university; it is a statutory body that is very much part of the university structure. The Head of Alumni Relations reports to the Executive Director, Development and Alumni Department, who reports to the Vice chancellor. The Alumni Relations Office is funded at a central level by the university—in the same way that other business units are funded.4 2.6.2 Strathmore Business School, Kenya Strathmore Business School (SBS) is the graduate business school of the Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya. Founded in 2005, it is a leading business school in East Africa. Like the LBS and IESE Business School, it was promoted by Opus Dei5 members and has a strong Christian identity. Because of this affinity, it shares a lot in common with both LBS and IESE, some of which can be seen in the way the school organises its alumni association. Membership of Strathmore Business School Alumni Association (SBS-AA) is by subscription and is open to all executives who have passed through all accredited SBS programmes, long or short. There are three types of membership: life membership—one-off life subscription; annual\n\nMODELS OF ALUMNI LEADERSHIP\n\n27\n\nmembership—by annual subscriptions; and honorary membership—for deserving individuals and corporate organisations. The SBS-AA Executive Committee runs the affairs of the association, but reports to the Alumni Council. The officers of the association include the chairperson, the deputy chairperson, the secretary and the treasurer, all of whom are appointed by the University Council on the recommendation of the Alumni Association Nominations Committee, which is set up by the Executive Director of Alumni Relations. Each officer should be an alumna or alumnus who has a prominent public profile and who has displayed a record of assistance to the university. The officers normally hold office for a period of up to three years and may be reappointed for a further term of office not exceeding three years.\n\nNotes 1.

The chapter traces the initial years of the School, from its days as the Centre for Professional Communication, and the strong early support it got from distinguished Nigerians and non-Nigerians who made up its pioneer Advisory Board. Onukwuba identifies the Christian identity of the School as a factor that has shaped its missional imperatives and strong ethical principles. The chapter discusses the executive programmes at LBS from inception and how these programmes have progressed over the years. Onukwuba examines the factors behind the School’s rapid growth, leading to its becoming the first institution in West Africa to receive double international accreditations in 2016.

ONUKWUBA\n\n3.1 Introduction: The MBA Admission I was the pioneer president of the Catholic Couples for Christ—a society for young married couples in the Catholic Church of Nigeria—started in 2000 at St. Dominic’s Church, Yaba, Lagos. I also doubled as the editor of the society’s newsletter, called “Couples,” published twice a year. Looking for funds for the next edition of the newsletter, I had gone to seek advertisement placement from Lagos Business School (LBS) at the 2 Ahmed Onibudo Street, Victoria Island, campus of the School. Mr Gabriel Diejomaoh was then the marketing director at the Business School. He allowed himself to be convinced by my marketing pitch and took the back page advertisement slot for the School. But, being the marketer that he was, he seized the opportunity to tell me about the LBS Executive MBA programme. To encourage me and to douse my fears of not being prepared, he loaned me a GMAT booklet of past questions to kick-start my preparation for the entrance examination, which was just a few weeks away. I decided to take the challenge even though I did not know where my tuition fees would come from if I passed the entrance examination. Eventually, I completed my registration for the programme and sat for the entrance exam at the big hall of the Nigerian Law School, just opposite the School’s campus. It was a very intense examination, one of the most challenging I had ever taken. The first reaction I got upon learning I had passed the tough examination was a big ego boost—a vote of confidence in myself, in my academic relevance. Nevertheless, I still was not sure how on earth I could afford the 1.5 million naira tuition fee for the two-year programme; I was just an average earning mortgage banker. But as I pondered about the development, I was able to convince myself that I should not let the opportunity slip by. Who knows if I would be successful in the examination another time. I was also at that time a catechist at the St Dominic’s Church, Yaba. Primarily, I was teaching the adult confirmation class, preparing adults for the Sacrament of Confirmation of the Church. Most of my students were converts from other religions and lapsed Catholics. My students’ ages ranged from 21 up to 70, and they came from different academic, professional and business backgrounds. One of my students was a top civil servant. He was particularly grateful for the opportunity to receive the Sacrament and regularise his marriage, which my class afforded him. As I looked for money (700,000 Naira for the first year) for my MBA school fees, I remembered him and decided to ask him for a loan. I was not sure\n\nLAGOS BUSINESS SCHOOL\n\n33\n\nhow he would take it, and I was also mindful of my reputation and the impression I would be creating in his mind—a teacher begging a student for money. But I was desperate and the deadline for school fees payment was dangerously close. I had to swallow my pride. He listened to my story and was very happy for me. He must have sensed that I would find it difficult to pay back the loan, so he gave me two-third of the money I was asking for, but for free! I could not believe my luck. I thanked him profusely, and thanked God more for the opportunity to serve Him, which has brought me this big fortune—I have given this testimony many times in my teachings on service to God. I did not need to pay all the fees at once; what he gave me was more than enough to start the programme. So, that is how I eventually, without it ever being in my 2003 to-do list, gained admission to a most rewarding two-year Executive MBA programme at LBS.\n\n3.2 Lagos Business School Lagos Business School (LBS) is a leading institution in Africa dedicated to creating and transmitting business and management knowledge relevant to Africa and the world at large. LBS is a not-for-profit organisation founded in 1991 as a management development institution. It is the first institution to offer executive programmes on a continuous basis for experienced business managers in tropical Africa. Its long-term aim is to foster the formation of ethical and responsible managers who can lead Nigeria’s and Africa’s sustained development. LBS is the business school of Pan-Atlantic University and a member of the Association of African Business Schools (AABS), the Global Business School Network (GBSN), the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The School is relatively small, with about 200 full-time staff and 30 full-­ time faculty. Located in Africa’s largest city (Worldatlas 2018),1 Lagos, LBS delivers executive education at the top and middle management levels, aiming to systematically improve the practice of management in the continent. The School offers a full-time MBA, the Executive MBA, and the Modular Executive MBA programmes. In addition, it offers a total of seven open enrolment executive programmes targeted at different managerial cadres (see list in Table 3.5), and a yearly average of 50 short, focused seminars—in both Nigeria and West Africa—prepared around essential\n\n34\n\nH. O. ONUKWUBA\n\nissues in business. LBS programmes attract over 3000 participants from multinational and indigenous companies every year. Customised in-company programmes are also arranged for organisations that need to develop large groups of staff in a particular discipline. Executive education at LBS is comprehensive. The case-study method is the major pedagogy. The system ensures that participants gain management knowledge and skills through practical real-life business situations and through the group-work learning approach. To ensure continuous relevance of its programmes, the School places a premium on maintaining a keen relationship with the corporate clientele it serves. Constant interaction with participating organisations, a committed corporate support group of 70 core companies, plus counsel and support rendered by the School’s distinguished Advisory Board play major roles in securing this linkage. 3.2.1 Mission “Lagos Business School is a community of people committed to creating and transmitting management and business knowledge based on a Christian conception of the human person and of economic activity and relevant to Nigeria and Africa at large. We strive to be a world-class business school which will have a significant impact on the practice of management. In order to achieve this mission, the school seeks to: 1. Provide high potential professionals with a general management education which stresses professional ethics and service to the community through the practice of management 2. Have a positive impact on the professional and ethical standards of business management in Nigeria 3. Make intellectual contributions which (a) support the practice of management; (b) contribute to the advancement of the management disciplines; and (c) create high quality teaching material.”2 The fundamental inspiration at LBS is provided by the Christian vision of man, society and economic activity. The Prelature of Opus Dei, an institution of the Catholic Church, takes responsibility for guaranteeing that this vision underlies all teaching, publishing and research activities of the School.\n\nLAGOS BUSINESS SCHOOL\n\n35\n\n3.2.2 History Prof Albert Alos, the pioneer Dean of LBS and pioneer Vice Chancellor of the Pan-Atlantic University, traces the idea of LBS to 1973 (Alos 2013). The Educational Co-operation Society (ECS), founded in Nigeria in 1968 by some Opus Dei members and their Nigerian friends to “promote the advancement of education with a strong leaning to the Christian values of life,” had established in 1972 the Helmbridge Study Centre, in Surulere, in the heart of Lagos. On November 4, 1973, the Centre organised its first special study programme for secondary school students. The programme, which included sessions on computer programming, marketing, architecture and electronics, was very well received, not only by the students but also by their teachers. The teachers then requested a similar programme to be organised for them, promising to bring along their professional friends. This request was acceded to, and the programmes became popular among the participants. On January 17, 1975, the Helmbridge Management Series was launched, and the popularity of the programme gave the fillip for thoughts on a school of management in Lagos. Sixteen years after these initial thoughts, and after other interventions in the area of students and professionals’ development,3 the ECS set up the Centre for Professional Communication (CPC) in the heart of Victoria Island, Lagos. The first programme of the CPC was on October 9, 1990, and was a talk by His Excellency, Mr Brain Barder, the then British High Commissioner to Nigeria, on “Recollection of the Soviet Union (1971–1973) and Poland (1986–1988).” Alos (2013) reports that the lectures soon gave way to more formal seminars and workshops. In August 1991, a decision was taken to fashion the School after the IESE Business School model which offered formal general management education.
