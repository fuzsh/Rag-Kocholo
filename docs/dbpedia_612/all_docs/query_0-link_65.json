In this very useful contribution, Sara Moyo, neatly sets out where we are and the recommendations of the recently established Working Group, chaired by Nancy Samuriwo. The Banjul Protocol on Marks (Banjul Protocol) within the framework of the African Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) was adopted by ARIPO member states in 1993 and came into force in 1997. Membership of the Protocol is open to any state which is a member of ARIPO. It is also available to any state which is a member of the African Union or the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Unlike the Harare Protocol on Patents, Industrial Designs and Utility Models which came into force in 1984, has 17 member states and is linked to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Banjul Protocol has 9 member states only. Under-performance The Banjul Protocol has perennially under performed. The total number of trademark applications filed under the Banjul Protocol since the Protocol came into force is less than 2 000. Of this number 22% are applications filed by Applicants within ARIPO member states whilst 29% are filed by Applicants based in African countries that are not members of ARIPO. The remainder of trademark applications are filed by Applicants outside Africa. To date trademark registrations under the Banjul Protocol number less 800. Of these 14% have been registered in favour of Applicants within the ARIPO member states. 9% are registered in favour of Applicants based in African countries that are not contracting states to ARIPO. The remainder are registered in favour of Applicants outside the continent. In contrast, the Harare Protocol has since its inception, received in excess of 6 000 patent applications (excluding industrial designs and utility models) and has registered in excess of 2 000 patents. Dos Santos - ARIPO DG In addition whilst ARIPO member states have domesticated the Harare Protocol, only 5 of the contracting members of the Banjul Protocol have done so. Working Group Established ARIPO recently convened a meeting of intellectual property (IP) stakeholders at Harare to discuss proposals for making the Banjul Protocol on Marks more attractive to users and to contracting states. The meeting was held as a follow up to the first meeting held on 21 March 2013, and was also aimed at putting together a formal Working Group structure that is mandated to discuss and submit concrete proposals to the Technical Committee of ARIPO for the improvement of the Banjul Protocol. Whilst invitation to the meeting was extended to ARIPO member states, IP agents within member states and other IP stakeholders, participants at the ARIPO meeting were delegates from the ARIPO member states of Liberia, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and IP agents in attendance were from Uganda and Zimbabwe. Ms Nancy Samuriwo of Gill Godlonton & Gerrans (Zimbabwe) was elected Chairperson of the Working Group and Ms Loy Mhando of the Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (Tanzania) was elected Vice Chairperson. The deliberations of the meeting included: 1. The recommendation to ARIPO to embark on a membership drive for the Banjul Protocol and to encourage contracting states to make legal provision for the enforcement of Banjul marks under their national laws. Presently only 9 of the 17 ARIPO member states are party to the Banjul Protocol and only 5 contracting states have domesticated the Banjul Protocol. These are Botswana, Liberia, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe. 2. The recommendation to ARIPO to undertake users’ meetings and exhibitions so as to market the Banjul Protocol to users, member states and prospective contracting parties. 3. The recommendation that ARIPO undertake a review of its fee structure under the Banjul Protocol as this is in certain instances a barrier to membership of the Protocol. 4. The recommendation that ARIPO consider reducing the period for substantive examination of Banjul marks from 12 months to 9 months so as to shorten the period from filing to registration – more so as the majority of Banjul member states do not, owing to technical and capacity constraints, issue substantive examination reports. 5. It was noted that a number of ARIPO member states are party to the Madrid System or are in the process of joining the System and that there is a need to investigate the possibility of linking the Banjul Protocol with the Madrid System.

A Century of Naval Aviation - RNAS Yeovilton Air Day The annual air show at RNAS Yeovilton was a little bit different—and rather special—this year because it celebrated a century of naval aviation in the UK. Pacific Wings’ UK correspondent, Peter Cooper, was there in the wind and the rain to cover the event. From Bundy to the Mount Ross Crawford More used to flying 300-ton airliners (and checking and training others to do the same), Ross Crawford recently joined Tim Holland, the CFI of Auckland-based Euroflight International, to ferry two tiny Jabiru aircraft across the Tasman. Recognised for its high standards in operating both scheduled and charter airline services, Vincent Aviation—centrally based in Wellington—also operates a busy Part 145 maintenance organisation to equally high standards. Earlybird’s Armistice Day Phil Lightband Phil Lightband is the exception to the rule about there being no such thing as an old, bold pilot. Now old (technically, at least), Phil has been bold since he first flew an aeroplane at 14. He recently celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary on Armistice Day—at the controls of a plane.

After the final whistle blew, United’s Champions League journey had come to a shuddering halt due to a humiliating 2-1 defeat at the hands of the Swiss side. However the game was slightly overshadowed for many Reds when they saw their dominant skipper, and arguably the best centre back in the world, fall awkwardly during a challenge with Basel’s Marco Streller leading to Vidic being stretchered off and subsequently being replaced by Jonny Evans. Many United fans must have feared the worst at the time. The news every Red had been dreading was confirmed two days later by Sir Alex, Vidic had ruptured his cruciate knee ligament, the Serbian’s season was over. Once Vidic’s injury was confirmed, United, who were trailing neighbours City by five points and a far inferior goal difference were beginning to be written off by pundits for the title, with Matt Le Tissier claiming the Serbian’s injury had probably ended United’s chances of retaining their 20th crown. At the time it was hard to argue with them due to the sheer importance of Vidic to not only United’s back four but their whole team. Prior to Vidic’s injury United had started to shore up their defensive problems. United were too open at the back and with Vidic missing through the early part of the season, opposing teams were creating chance after chance against United’s inexperienced back four. This issue was capped off by neighbours City’s 6-1 mauling at Old Trafford, a game when Vidic did not feature. After City’s emphatic win, United only conceded one goal in their next five games with Vidic returning to the side. His leadership qualities and defensive ability is clear for all to see. Since signing for United in January 2006 for £7 million from Spartak Moscow, Vidic has developed into a world class centre back. His partnership with Rio Ferdinand has blossomed over the years helping United gain new heights of success. Both of them were included in the PFA Team of the Year for three seasons running from 2006-2009. Vidic himself has collected nearly every individual accolade. He was named Barclays player of the season in both 2009 and 2011 and in the same years was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI. Once Vidic’s injury was confirmed, Sir Alex put his trust in Jonny Evans partnering Rio Ferdinand for the remaining five months of the season. The Northern Irishman had a torrid time in the Manchester derby in October which saw him sent off. However Fergie’s trust in the young centre back paid off. He was arguably Uniteds most consistent defender post Christmas and helped United come within an inch of that 20th title. In my opinion many United fans can look to the forthcoming season with relative optimism. To push City to within 60 seconds from the title knowing they had their skipper out for half of the season is one reason to be hopeful. Also with Evans having such a fine second half to the campaign whist filling in for Vidic, a future centre back partnership between the two could be as powerful as the Rio/Nemanja partnership that dominated for years. If the Serbian stays injury free next season, who knows what the red half of Manchester might achieve. Posted in Opinion, Premier LeagueTagged Manchester United, Premier League @bowdzunited18 One thought on “Nemanja Vidic: United’s signing of the summer” Jack Willows says: You’ve hit the nail on the head! Just look how close we were without him! Compare that to the two or three games which City’s Kompany missed, they were in tatters! As a United fan I would like to think we can only improve on last season’s performance, not only domestically, but obviously in Europe and prove we’re still up there with the world’s finest.

Read it there or wait until the news media finally figures out what's going on! A new press release was delivered to PRWeb this morning. Our site has the whole release here. Or read this whole news article. Distance Record Flight Planned Ardenflight plans to execute a new distance record flight within the United States. Check out the World Distance Record Flight section for more details. Let Ardenflight.net be your first stop for information about the flight! Minute by Minute Progress For your ease, this link will jump you to the latest entry on this page. With the planned flight now underway, we here at the Ardenflight.net update center can't wait to hear how our intrepid group of adventurers progress in their goal to capture those records! And, thanks to the power of technology, we won't have to. Expect to get regular updates on the progress of the flight, which we here at news central will pass on to you. Refresh often! 10/31/2006 09:59 PM PST -- Just heard from the adventuring crew who say that they are airborne, off on the first leg of their journey. They will be flying from Hayward Executive Airport (KHWD) to San Diego's Gillespie Airport (KSEE). Departure was a little later than planned, thanks to some last-minute issues with the technology that will be used to record the record setting (they knocked over a camera, it didn't work any longer, so they had to get a replacement) but now the adventure begins. Weather looks good and all aboard were positive about the upcoming flight. As Pilot Alan Cirino said, \"We're ready to start our Odyssey.\" 10/31/2006 11:23 PM PST -- The intrepid crew has landed at Gillespie and are now refueling the aircraft and preparing to really get moving on the flight. They estimate a 2 AM PST for their next departure with weather still projected fine for the record setting portions of the flight. They did express some concern that folks might not fully understand the goals of this flight, so asked that we direct folks to this post. 11/01/2006 01:45 AM PST -- Sending a quick email from the ground, pilot Alan Cirino shares a jet stream airchart showing how the wind should be helping them along. Auspicious weather indeed. Check this out: 11/01/06 03:40 AM PST -- The flight, which has received the callsign, FASTFLIGHT1 is 1 hour into the journey and looks to be smashing the record. They are speeding along at 409 knots, which should help them arrive much sooner than expected. For this crew, it's true that time flies when you're having fun. 11/01/06 05:52 AM PST -- Pilot Alan, contacting us via the fantastic air to ground communication system reports that they are over 43,000 feet over Tyler Texas, with about an hour and ten minutes left to go. The jetstream tailwind is giving them such a boost that in just the short time of communication, they report two speeds: first Alan tells us that they are moving along at 415 knots, but before the communication is finished, Flight Commander Matt Brooks says in the background that the aircraft is now recording just over 443 knots. We then heard from NAA Observer Kris who tells us about the \"exceptional aircraft\" and \"crackerjack pilots.\" He requests that I mention that all records that we might report during the course of this play-by-play are unofficial until the data and the observer's notes have been reviewed and the records confirmed by the NAA and the FAI. Duly noted. 11/01/06 08:17 AM PST -- Touchdown in Florida and the first leg of the flight complete, and it looks like our capable crew has made five records so far (pending review and approval of the record-keepers at the NAA and the FAI, natch) Speaking with Observer Kris, the Ardenflight crew will be submitting for the following records : The distance without landing record (app 1803,8 nautical miles) Speed over a recognized course (approximate average of 413 knots) (between San Diego and Jacksonville). (World and national record, pending review) US Transcontinental record (approximate average speed of 413 knots) (World and national record, pending review) That's a total of five records with one flight, and they look to take on another slew of records later on today! Great job. 11/01/06 12:52 PM PST -- The Ardenbrook fellows are currently in Sheltair Aviation Services in Jacksonville, Florida. Hard working and enthusiastic Sheltair Customer Service Representative Cari Rennie explained that the two year old facility, managed by Jonathan Buff, feuled the pilots with Starbucks Coffee and Otis Spunkmeyer cookies and has already spoken to local television about coverage for our fabulous flyboys. For their part, our intrepid pilots expressed their thanks to Ms. Rennie for her help and support and are now finishing their preparations for taking off again. After having landed this morning, they rested and fed and prepared the flight plan for the thousand kilometer speed record attempt and will be initiating that in just a few hours. From there, they will be moving on to Atlanta, GA for refueling, and finally to Lincoln, Nebraska for the final portion of this flight, the climb record attempts. All three men sound in high spirits and very confident moving forward. 11/02/06 07:35 AM PST -- The gallant crew yesterday pointed their Cessna towards Washington DC and did the 1000 Kilometer run. That result is still being calculated and is still up in the air, so to speak. They had been planning to stop at Atlanta, Georgia to refuel, but weather moved them around some, so they instead made a refuel stop in Nashville before traveling on to their record-setting home point of Lincoln, Nebraska. The crew reports that they woke this morning to find that the weather was as crisp and cold as they could wish and the plane was properly hangared and warm. They brought her out, removed anything from the cabin that wasn't bolted down (including the observer Kris! -- this time, a video camera would have to observe in his stead) and performed a climb record attempt. To their disappointment (lessened by the five, maybe six records they had already set during the flight) they were not able to beat the record, previously set by a Lear jet. They landed, and now comes the 2000 Kilometer closed course record run. This run will be from Lincoln and a point south of Billings Montana and back. EXTRA! -- Kris (the NAA observer) was able to announce just before the Ardenflight crew signed off that they had been able to set a new record for the 1000 Kilometer run. Kris calculated an average flight speed of 319.9 knots on the 1000 Kilometer course, setting a new record (pending review)! 11/01/06 11:45 AM PST -- The crew just alerted us to the fact that now, halfway through the 2000 Kilometer run, they've just turned around a fixed radio point called \"Grey Bull\" in Montana, and things are going swimmingly. The first leg (prior to turning around Grey Bull) took about 1 hour fifty minutes with an average speed of about 362 knots. This return portion should be much faster than the first leg (they've got an 18 knot tailwind!). So far they're averaging about 435 knots! Following this report, we had an extended discussion with the NAA observer, Kris, who gave us a quick run down of the Records that will be submitted: On All Hallows Eve, the Ardenflight Crew Managed the following: World Record for Distance Without Landing (also a US National Record) World Record for Speed Over a Recognized course (also a US National Record) A US National Record for Speed US West to East (wherein they beat previously established Record by about 10%) The morning of November 1st, Ardenflight clocked the following Record: World Record for Speed Over a 1000 Kilometer Closed Course (also a US National Record) (with an average speed of 319 knots) Kris went on to relate how impressed he was with the preparation of the Ardenflight crew, the efficiency of their planning, their skill in execution, and the quality of the plane. He explained that the sheer magnitude and number of records being set made this flight an extremely impressive achievement. Even he sounded a bit winded saying, \"This has been a very demanding pace.\" 11/01/06 03:23 PM PST -- Triumphant and successful, the Ardenflight crew is on their way home. They just contacted us here to give a final report that on the 2000 K Closed Course (another Tentative Record!) they averaged an airspeed of 349kts! We look forward to welcoming the conquering heroes back here in the Golden State shortly. Great job, guys!

I begin the stumble from my bedside toward the infernal racket as quickly as possible, shutting it down before it disrupts the rest of my household anymore than it already has. From there I continue toward the bathroom, where I decide its time to take a look at the time. Ergh, 445am, what am I doing? The answer to that very question perks me up immediately and within a few minutes I finish checking that I am packed, eat enough to fuel myself for the beginning of the day ahead, and eagerly await my pickup as the sun slowly begins to awaken the sky from its darkness. September is the beginning of the end for many mountain bikers across North America, but it’s also some of the best riding of the season. Temperatures cool a little, but often there is still plenty of sun. Kids are normally back in school making it quieter around town. Then there’s the extra moisture which results in the dirt taking on the consistency often referred to as ‘hero dirt’. Personally, the most exciting part of riding in September is its prime time for expedition days, with plenty of self supported backcountry travel to look forward too. Come this time the snow-line has most likely receded enough to support these monster alpine days, we’re more capable/fitter, and a whole team of like-minded individuals are open and available for it—the stars align. Pick Your Poison, Then Ride It The group that I speak of wasted no time this year, hitting a big mission on the first day of the month. While many were fighting lift lines or lounging around barbecues, this small clan left home at 530am and headed north in search of something unique. Mildly weary of the regular Chilcotin trips after years of travel to and fro, in addition to copious amounts of Facebook updates from other similarly likeminded souls, we ventured out for something a little different. Not all of us live in the same location and one integral member of the group was lucky enough to sleep until 730—nevertheless, he had less shut-eye than the rest thanks to reasons we won’t delve into. Now the truck was full, but with the perfect amount of people for the territory. Two’s company and three’s a crowd, but more comforting for this Aussie was the group being large enough that any of the larger, shaggy wildlife would no doubt hear us well ahead of our arrival. It’s hard to travel quietly in a pack of two or three, each dragging bikes and gear along the way, but a pack of five should be even better. What we discovered was just what the doctor ordered. Not too dissimilar to the Chilcotin’s, we still found mass ridge-lines and moonscape environments, but there was enough of a difference to make it stunning in its own right. Large Colorado-esque rock walls full of features overbore the group, putting us right in our place—it’s humbling when nature makes you feel small and insignificant, but nestles you in at the same time. We ventured to the uppermost point possible without climbing gear, against strong gusts of wind that seemed to want nothing more than keep us away from our goal. Same, Same; But Very Different It was here that the group found the ground-cover to be completely different to anything experienced elsewhere on similar trips. There was not a lick of soil up there and instead, we were moving across black, fist sized rocks covered in a yellow algae, that were wedged together perfectly—as if mother nature had the most successful game of Tetris imaginable! Riding across this was straight-forward enough, so long as the howling gusts of wind didn’t hit too hard in an attempt to blow us off the ridge, and consequently, the mountain. The rock rumbled away underneath us, imitating the gobble of a bush turkey on the run, but didn’t last too long. After a couple hundred metres of descending we arrived on terrain that was loose and sandy. It was at this point that the group proceeded to imitate the likes of James Doerfling or Graham Aggassiz—and completely fail. Riders went over the bars, while others felt like complete gorbs as they tried to figure out what was happening beneath them. If there was the slightest lack of respect for riders that ski big mountain lines on their bikes, there wasn’t now. Beneath this point we hit the meadows, ripping turns through the deep, bumpy alpine grasses before arriving at our low-point, regrouping, and beginning the journey back along the ridge-lines. Perhaps the most surprising, and rewarding part of the trip was the final descent. A descent that while making our way up, seemed too steep, narrow and loose to really enjoy coming back down. How wrong we were! Once heading down it was all hoots and hollers, sliding on-the-edge-of-dying for 6km and 600m of vertical. It wasn’t all smooth sailing; however, with one of the tricky s-bends on the descent catching a couple of us out. Most made it through unscathed but one wasn’t so lucky and was unfortunate enough to slide off the trail and begin falling down the (very) steep mountainside. Laughing it off, it wasn’t until later that hindsight made clear that if it weren’t thanks to a luckily timed, panic ridden fist-full of rear brake getting the bike perpendicular to the hillside, and a pedal large enough to gouge into the mountain, life could be very different. Nevertheless, the spills did little to dampen the rest of the ride. In fact, they seemed to spur everyone on more, as the thrill of the riding being consumed soon turned into an apparent “if that’s the worst that can happen” attitude, resulting in some loose examples of bike handling throughout the remainder of the trail. Good, f’n, times. September started out just how we wanted with the ride on the first now only irritating the incessant itch for more. With the very possible reality of only a few more weeks for these sort of adventures, we have to get it in while we can, and although September is the best time of year for these sort of trips, it also isn’t unheard of for old man winter to arrive early and drown our spirits. Question is, where next?

Micro-cracks were recently discovered in one of the facility’s reactors. Sam Morgan has the details. People take part in a tri-national human chain action, near the nuclear power plant of Tihange, Belgium, 25 June 2017. [Olivier Hoslet/ EPA] The protesters called for the “immediate” closure of two of Belgium’s nuclear reactors, including Tihange’s reactor 2 and the Doel facility’s reactor 3, which lies on the northern border with the Netherlands. According to organisers, 50,000 people turned out to form a human chain that stretched 90 kms from Tihange, in east Belgium, to Liège, the Dutch city of Maastricht and the German city of Aachen. Both reactors in question were restarted in 2015 following a hiatus of more than two years after micro-cracks were detected in both facilities. The decision was made following extensive investigations and consultations with international experts. The lifespans of Doel’s other two reactors, 1 and 2, were controversially extended in mid-2015 by ten years. Both were meant to go offline that year and will instead keep running until 2025, when they will celebrate a half-century of operation. Nearly 40% of Belgium’s total energy needs and 55% of its electricity are satisfied by nuclear power and its reliance on its ageing nuclear stock will continue as it pursues other energy sources. But experts recently detected 70 new fissures within Tihange 2, after using ultrasonic technology, according to Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon. Jambon insisted that the power plant’s security is not in doubt and it will continue to operate. Doel 3 was also found to have micro-cracks back in November. The government said that reactor would also continue to operate. The organisers said on their website that “it is incomprehensible and unacceptable that the government leaves these reactors on”. It is not just the state of Belgium’s reactors that has angered protesters. Its seven reactors are all at least 30 years old and three of them are 40 years old. Japan’s 2011 Fukushima disaster convinced Germany to begin phasing out nuclear power and in early 2016, Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks called on her Belgian counterparts to “temporarily” take the reactors offline due to unresolved safety concerns after hydrogen flakes were detected in both. Hendricks failed in that bid but both governments did eventually agree to a better exchange of information on all things related to nuclear power. It is unclear how these fresh concerns about the state of the Tihange facility will affect Brussels-Berlin relations, especially given Hendricks’ disappointment with last year’s agreement, which “did not meet all the needs and expectations of border communities”. A European Court of Auditors report last year found that the decommissioning of a number of Soviet-era nuclear reactors within the EU is significantly behind schedule and that billions of euros are still needed to complete the job. Decommissioning eight reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria was part of those countries’ EU accession deals but the process is still ongoing. The strongly-worded report recorded a number of shortcomings in terms of know-how and potential improper use of EU funding. One nuclear power plant in Lithuania has the same type of reactors as Chernobyl, the infamous Ukrainian facility that failed and caused a massive disaster in 1986. It is the first time that a graphite reactor will have been decommissioned, although the initial shutdown date of 2029 has now slipped to 2038.
