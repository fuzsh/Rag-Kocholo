        "text": "Below is a list of some of the most successful people in human history that did not attend college. If you want to see a video on the collapse of college tuition rates and the devaluation of a college degree, click here to read that article and watch those videos:\n\nhttps://overmanwarrior.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/the-college-scam-the-cost-of-bad-sex-bad-education-and-the-hook-hidden-in-the-bait/\n\nThe number one comment I have received from people during the No Levy Campaign for Lakota is that we must spend money on education because we want successful students to become successful adults. But how true is that statement and what is the true value of education if so many successful people achieved success without college?\n\n(What are the top 20 useless degrees?)\n\nhttps://overmanwarrior.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/top-tenty-useless-college-degrees-why-are-we-paying-so-much-for-college/\n\nWhen educators, people who make their living educating students, whether it is in college, or public school, speak they are people I listen to with reality filters. They aren’t much different to me than used car salesmen, or one of those salesmen who sell time shares. They’ll tell you every reason why you need their service, and once you buy their service and get home with it, you wonder why you bought anything from them in the first place.\n\nI once sat with my wife for an entire afternoon in Hilton Head and listened to a kind little man tell me why it would be good for me to buy a time share condo in Hilton Head. When I told him no, he looked terribly sad, and told me how his kids were going to starve, and genuinely tried to make me feel terrible for him. Thankfully, I told him no even though I felt bad about it, and looking back, if I had bought the condo, I’d regret it now. Because then I’d be obligated to always return to the same vacation spot, or as they do now, one of the various spots in their network. I wouldn’t be free to go wherever I wanted year after year. And it would have been a terrible waste of money.\n\nWhen educators say that kids must do well in grade school so they can go to college, and they must go to college to get a good job, they are not telling the whole truth and it comes out sounding like a time share sales pitch. In fact, some of the most successful people of all time in the history of our culture did not attend college, or dropped out of college. College will help you get a job, and some decent middle class money. But it doesn’t do much to help you create one. And in America, if you want the real money, you have to create a job.\n\n(MORE GREAT VIDEOS AT THIS LINK. CALL COLLEGE WHAT IT REALLY IS)\n\nhttps://overmanwarrior.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/college-is-the-root-of-the-evil-call-it-what-it-is-an-excuss-to-expand-government/\n\nThe below list is a composition of names that either did not attend college or dropped out. Some didn’t even get out of high school. It’s important to analyze what exactly we truly value in education, because if we are only interested in raw success, then our culture should follow in the path of the below individuals.\n\nBut if the goal is social engineering indoctrinated through an education institution, then we should continue on as we have. But if the goal is success for our children……why wouldn’t we teach them to do as the people below have done.\n\nPeople like Harry Truman, Abe Lincoln, George Washington and\n\nThomas Edison are no-brainers. However, here’s a list of people who either never went to college or dropped-out of college, and went onto become famous and/or successful:\n\nNow as you look over this list, please note how many well-known people had a tremendous amount of home schooling, and remember that currently, home schooled kids out perform their public school counterparts by 30% or more. Why do you think that is?\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.collegedropoutshalloffame.com/b.htm\n\nThe Quick List: After this list is more detail description of each name and their personal situation. There are a lot of actors on this list, and the only reason I kept them on here, is that often they speak on behalf of political movements, and therefore, their background must be understood.\n\nS.
