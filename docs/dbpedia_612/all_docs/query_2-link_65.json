        "text": "Background: Women infected with human immunodefi ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and-2 may be at higher risk of develop-ing cervical cancer than uninfected women. We assessed the relationships among human papillomavirus (HPV) types and persistence, HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infection, and the develop-ment of high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) in a prospective study. Methods: We studied 627 women with and without HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infection and high-risk HPV infection in Senegal, West Africa, who were assessed every 4 months for HSIL and HPV DNA over a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Cox regression modeling was used to assess risks associated with development of HSIL. Results: During follow-up, 71 (11%) of 627 women developed HSIL as detected by cytology. HIV-infected women with high-risk HPV types were at greatest risk for development of HSIL.\n\nDuring two decades here (1967-1987) Professor G. Peter Lyman left an indelible mark on the students, his colleagues, and James Madison College. He was a Founding Faculty member of Madison, part of a triumvirate with Jack Paynter and Dick Zinman, who taught political philosophy and critical thinking to generations of Madison students. Together, they crafted the field of Justice, Morality and Constitutional Democracy (JMCD) which became Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy (PTCD) in 1993. A brilliant teacher, committed ethnographer and creative scholar, Peter left a powerful legacy in the curriculum of the college, in his influential research and in the lives of numerous students. Peterâ€™s family, friends, colleagues and students are creating this endowed fund as an enduring testament to his legacy and service to James Madison College."
