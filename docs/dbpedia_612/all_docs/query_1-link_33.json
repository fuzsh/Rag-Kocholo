        "text": "Theme: Access for All? The Role of IP in Equity, Power, and Democracy in Challenging Times\n\nFriday, October 28\n\nProgram: 9:30 am – 5:00 pm CDT/ 7:30 am – 3:00 pm PDT/ 3:30 pm – 11:00 pm BST/ 4:30 pm – 12:00 am GMT\n\nVirtual Happy Hour: 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm CDT/ 3:00 – 4:00 pm PDT/ 12:00 am – 1 am BST/ 1:00 am – 2:00 am GMT\n\nSaturday, October 29\n\nProgram: 9:30 am – 5:00 pm CDT/ 7:30 am – 3:00 pm PDT/ 3:30 pm – 11:00 pm BST/ 4:30 pm – 12:00 am GMT\n\nEach IP Mosaic Conference is typically organized around a specific IP social justice legal issue, policy, or socio-economic challenge. Representative conference themes include equitable access to health, medicines, knowledge, and information; socially beneficial application of information technology and related advances to IP development and dissemination; legal protection for traditional and indigenous knowledge and expression; and promoting IP awareness, education, and entrepreneurial and socio-political empowerment in marginalized communities. The conference format is principally comprised of paper or project presentation sessions and plenary panel discussions. In addition, keynote presentations and “incubator project” and work in progress sessions are also mainstays of the conference.\n\nThe Pragmatic Intersection of Scholarly Analysis and Law and Policy Development\n\nIP protection is intended to play an important role in engendering human development and actualization toward the greater societal good. The traditional tools and experience of scholarly analysis, reflection, and discourse, however, are not always readily adaptive toward targeted social action, or what is sometimes referred to as “public intellectualism”. Through the IP Mosaic Conference, IP scholars engage with social activists, practicing attorneys, and policy makers to produce “activist scholarship”, to collaborate on various “IP Empowerment” policy initiatives and projects, and to otherwise help to shape and effectuate a progressive and contemporary IP socio-legal agenda.\n\nSince 2014, IIPSJ has sponsored the IP Mosaic Conference. Through the IP Mosaic, IIPSJ collaborates with a law school host to provide a venue in which to explore the social ordering function of IP protection in the total political economy, particularly the law’s social justice obligations in promoting human rights and actualization, cultural and technological progress, and self-determination and nation-building.\n\nThe IP Mosaic Conference was established to bring together scholars, law and policy makers, and social activists of diverse and multicultural backgrounds and perspectives to explore progressive, social justice-oriented ideas in intellectual property law, policy, and social activism. Beginning in the late twentieth century, digital information technology and other innovations sparked a paradigm shift in scholarly assessment of the social ordering function of IP protection, exposing the need to critically examine the law’s social justice obligations in promoting human rights, self-determination, cultural progress, and nation-building and evolution. IP law and policy makers traditionally value scholarly analyses in their development and interpretation of IP protection. Progressive, social justice-oriented IP scholarship, especially when infused with the experience and insights of policy makers and social activists, can provide the doctrinal basis for shaping a more socially responsible IP legal regime.\n\nProgram Agenda\n\nFriday, October 30, 2020\n\n12 – 12:15 pm CST Welcome Remarks\n\n• Kali Murray (Host)\n\nProfessor of Law, Marquette University School of Law\n\n• Joseph Kearney (Host)\n\nDean, Marquette University School of Law\n\n• Lateef Mtima (MOSAIC Core)\n\nProfessor of Law, Howard Law School\n\nFounder and Director, IIPSJ\n\n• Recognition of Benjamin Liu Memorial Scholars (denoted by **)\n\nJasmine Abdel-Khalik, University of Missouri-Kansas School of Law\n\n12:15 – 12:50 pm Plenary Session 1\n\nEncountering Race in IP\n\nA Social Construction of Race Encounter – Phillip Lee, Professor, University of the District Columbia David A.

Through the IP Mosaic, IIPSJ collaborates with a law school host to provide a venue in which to explore the social ordering function of IP protection in the total political economy, particularly the law’s social justice obligations in promoting human rights and actualization, cultural and technological progress, and self-determination and nation-building.\n\nThe IP Mosaic Conference was established to bring together scholars, law and policy makers, and social activists of diverse and multicultural backgrounds and perspectives to explore progressive, social justice-oriented ideas in intellectual property law, policy, and social activism. Beginning in the late twentieth century, digital information technology and other innovations sparked a paradigm shift in scholarly assessment of the social ordering function of IP protection, exposing the need to critically examine the law’s social justice obligations in promoting human rights, self-determination, cultural progress, and nation-building and evolution. IP law and policy makers traditionally value scholarly analyses in their development and interpretation of IP protection. Progressive, social justice-oriented IP scholarship, especially when infused with the experience and insights of policy makers and social activists, can provide the doctrinal basis for shaping a more socially responsible IP legal regime.\n\nEach IP Mosaic Conference is typically organized around a specific IP social justice legal issue, policy, or socio-economic challenge. Representative conference themes include equitable access to health, medicines, knowledge, and information; socially beneficial application of information technology and related advances to IP development and dissemination; legal protection for traditional and indigenous knowledge and expression; and promoting IP awareness, education, and entrepreneurial and socio-political empowerment in marginalized communities. The conference format is principally comprised of paper or project presentation sessions and plenary panel discussions. In addition, keynote presentations and “incubator project” and work in progress sessions are also mainstays of the conference.\n\nThe Pragmatic Intersection of Scholarly Analysis and Law and Policy Development\n\nIP protection is intended to play an important role in engendering human development and actualization toward the greater societal good. The traditional tools and experience of scholarly analysis, reflection, and discourse, however, are not always readily adaptive toward targeted social action, or what is sometimes referred to as “public intellectualism”. Through the IP Mosaic Conference, IP scholars engage with social activists, practicing attorneys, and policy makers to produce “activist scholarship”, to collaborate on various “IP Empowerment” policy initiatives and projects, and to otherwise help to shape and effectuate a progressive and contemporary IP socio-legal agenda.\n\nAbout the Summit\n\nThe HBCU Tech Law Summit aims to educate minority legal professionals on the issues and opportunities in the tech industry in an effort to help infuse the legal workforce with a diverse pipeline to ensure fair, transparent and accountable development of AI as a service and other new technologies that empower everyone.\n\nAbout the CLE\n\nThe IP and Social Justice CLE program provides annual updates in IP law, a panel of sitting federal judges, and discussions of IP, diversity, and social justice concerns. Each year we are privileged to work with some of the nation’s leading IP judges, attorneys, and scholars in our CLE program. For this year’s program, we intend to apply for CLE credit that can be used in the following jurisdictions: CA, VA, OH, and NY. Additional states may be added.\n\nView videos here"
