This work establishes an important learning: “African Education is a complex configuration of Indigenous, Islamic or Muslim, and Western education systems representing in many ways … a multi-tiered system with Indigenous education as its center and Islamic or Muslim and Western education acting as official nation-state systems” (Editors’ Introduction). The book brings a much needed global Africana perspective to the study of African education and Indigenous knowledge, strengthened with contributions from varied academic disciplines and authors situated in different geographic locations and comprising of both African scholars and Africanists. The collection ushers in a very comprehensive overview of African education and cultural knowledge systems from antiquity to the present. The discussion aptly points to the routine ways that Indigenous African knowledges have not often been engaged with, and how African-centric thought can be repositioned in global knowledge production notwithstanding the hostility of the Western academy as a center of learning. Many times epistemic racism and discursive prejudice, disguised as respectable scholarship, are reproduced in our educational settings. This book offers hope to many of us that the present marginalization of African insights, particularly, in academia and beyond is not a fatality. An Indigenous African resurgence, indeed, is happening and is contributing to expand the boundaries of our knowing. This resurgence is proceeding with a substantive body of African research and theory building and is changing the nature of scholarship on African Indigeneity as a legitimate field of inquiry in global education. Arguably, our intellectual starting points must move outside of the narrow, Eurocentric canons and begin to embrace multiple ­bodies of scholarship. This is a sure way to foster critical institutional scholarly/ pedagogical spaces that promote learning for all. By bringing together key scholars in the field of African education and Indigenous knowledge, the editors have succeeded in the goal of vii\n\nviii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nmaking visible the expanded reach of African research and the possibilities of decolonizing knowledge on and about the continent. These scholarly writings bring deep and refreshing insights into African education and, as noted by the editors, the collection fills an important gap in the literature as “there is currently no one inclusive volume that reviews the variety of African education systems in their structures, roles, and impact across the continent” (Abidogun, this volume). I am firmly convinced that we cannot discuss African education without situating Indigenous knowledge at the center. Such approach to the study of education has relevance not only for Africa but Global Studies in Education. Discussions offer helpful pointers to educators, students, field practitioners, researchers, policy-makers, and community workers. The wide geographical coverage involving every aspect of the continent is a strength making the work unparalleled. The extensive coverage presented to readers not only adds to an understanding of the richness of the continent’s diversity, but also illustrates vividly the points of convergence in African history—past, present, and future—and the possibilities for a new African education. The cross-sectional disciplinary focus in the arts, humanities, social sciences, including technical and vocational education and training, is particularly helpful in drawing attention to African contributions to global science knowledge. History and contexts are key entry points to the discussion of Africa. In fact, the historiography of African [re]positioning, “resistance, accommodation, and transformations of Indigenous education in relationship to the introduction of Islamic or Muslim and later Christian and Western education” (see Part I this volume) is significant in providing readers with an understanding of the nature of the politics and social context of African knowledge production. Indigenous African education has always worked to ensure the effective integration of the individual into the community, helping provide knowledge essential for collective survival and the African self/personhood. African education not only emphasized the nexus of culture, society, and nature, but also African educational teachings have always highlighted social values privileged in society for the collective welfare, dignity, and destiny of African peoples. Indigenous African education ensured an effective cultural resource knowledge base on which the ancient Empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai and the Kingdoms of the Fulani, the Fon, the Hausa, and Asante states were to develop to become the basis of sophisticated African civilizations. There are important lessons on how early, precolonial African communities harnessed the continent’s linguistic diversity for community development. In thinking through new futures for Africans, we must look to such lessons to understand the role of linguistic identities and Indigenous knowledges in creating peace, harmony, and solidarity within multilingual environments. The study of contemporary structures and content of African Indigenous education and Indigenous knowledge reveal the diversity, complexity, and richness of knowledge that can be tapped to advance contemporary African educational policy toward the development of decolonial curriculum, instruction,\n\nFOREWORD\n\nix\n\nand pedagogy. These educational insights laced and anchored in Indigenous philosophical ideas and thought processes act as core foundational knowledge for the pursuit of genuine African-centered development. Furthermore, there is something to be gained by exploring African folkloric productions (e.g., storytelling, music-and-dance performance, poetic recitation, and ritualistic and sacred performances—see, for example, Peter Ukpokodu’s chapter in this collection) and uncovering the deep knowledge insights into African culture, science, and technology. Similarly, the noted gendered dimensions and socially differentiated spheres and arenas of African education and Indigenous knowledge point to some epistemological assumptions espousing the vitality of African knowledge and education for social and community development, and for addressing social justice and equity considerations. In the contemporary epoch when questions of social difference—gender, language, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and [dis]ability—are very much on the table, we have some lessons of how African education and Indigenous knowledge has broached or not broached these subjects and the lessons this offers for thinking through social justice, human rights, and considerations of educational inclusivity in African contexts. The pursuit of knowledge must always be grounded in order to make concrete and material difference in peoples’ everyday lives. Consequently, our theoretical discussions on African Indigenous education and Indigenous knowledge must be fused with empirical research data. The reliance of extensive case studies from Anglophone, Francophone, and other linguistic divide in Africa help the book address the challenge of theory and practice with lessons for the search for new African educational futurities. I now turn to a discussion of the broader philosophical and political project, as well as the pertinent challenges and possibilities that such a book presents us with. I hope to speak with all anti-colonial scholars but foremost African scholars and Africanists. My words here are heavily influenced from my location on the diaspora and the issues I/we confront daily in my/ our work as a scholar[s] in the sociology of knowledge production. I am not alone and I know many others in similar situations raise similar voices. Clearly, as African scholars and Africanists, we must never broach African education and Indigenous knowledge as mere intellectual exercises in our own [un]learning and educational transformation. I come to the writing of this Preface from a position of contesting and radicalizing knowledge for liberation. I broach knowledge in the context of ongoing colonial and imperial domination in the processes of schooling and educational delivery. Following many others, I take education broadly to encompass the varied practices, strategies, and options of coming to know about our communities and worlds, and particularly, the radical things we do or need to act on and around lands, spaces, places, spaces, and names to improve upon ourselves, communities, and our physical and metaphysical worlds. This book offers a caution for beginning a productive and healthy conversation in this intellectual and political spheres. We need to understand what African forms of knowledge are and what we really mean by claiming such\n\nx\n\nFOREWORD\n\nknowledge as “Indigenous.” For sure we cannot conflate the “sociology of knowledge” with “critical epistemology” notwithstanding their synergies (see Gordon 2018, 8). A knowledge system that has been imposed or has suffered through a process of colonial imposition loses the sense of Indigenousness. As we engage in the process of recuperating our cultural knowledges and insist upon our Indigeneity, we may do well to remember that we seek to recover knowledge as counter-epistemes for their pragmatic not hegemonic usage. As many scholars will attest to “Indigenous” then becomes knowledge associated with a place based on “long term occupancy” or residence and accumulated through from the careful observations of the working of society, culture, and nature. It is knowledge that has served the survival and other needs of local communities and groups of people. While such knowledge has continually responded to the dynamics of social change, they have not lost their Indigenous integrity. The long historic failure to respect and validate such knowledge has only served to ensure the limitations of our own knowing. Frankly, the question of epistemic and ontological erasures in the academy is so huge for any scholar to be silent on. Unless perhaps their academic interests are being served by the dominant narrative. Our co-constitutive entanglements, relations, and investments in knowledge and knowledge production require us to bring a critical gaze to what is repeatedly normalized in the everyday practices of schooling and education. We must continually recognize the complex structural forces that shape what is deemed and is conventionally established as “knowledge” worth pursuing and how such knowledge is disciplined and regulate in academic/intellectual spaces. There are the troubling everyday material discursive impacts and effects of learning in our particular locales and locations that a study of African education and Indigenous knowledge lay very bare for us to see and witness to ongoing histories. I have never been convinced of the pursuit of knowledge simply to satisfy a supposedly scientific curiosity. I have also come to find theoretical arguments that are not grounded in peoples’ lived realities as very unhealthy and indeed oppressive of my own learning. Clearly, contestations in our theoretical arguments can be fully accessed for their effectiveness and embedded contradictions that impact on learning through the power of counter and multiple knowledging. Through critiques of knowledge and contestations, we expand upon our own understandings. Theory is universal but theory is itself in need of interrogation. The interrogation of the theory of knowledge requires that we each bring to the fore intellectual agencies as “knowing subjects” and accept the full responsibility of ensuring that theory itself speaks to material and symbolic realities of all learners. Colonization and colonial relations have impacted the recognition, acknowledgment, validity, and acceptance of Indigenous worldviews and the multiple ways of knowing in our educational institutions. Indigenous epistemes offer counter readings of our world challenging the current social and intellectual order. Colonialism was and has not just been an interrupter of the African experience. Colonialism also necessitated that African learners have\n\nFOREWORD\n\nxi\n\nhad to continually respond to illegitimate situations and encounters. In our search for new meaning making of our histories and lives, the idea of relationality of knowledge must be critical. Reclaiming African Indigeneity is a radical rethinking of knowledge and academic practice. Reclaiming our Indigeneity through a resurgence in our Indigenous knowledges has academic and political intents and purposes. This resurgence is about reclaiming and liberation of our marginalized, discounted, and delegitimized epistemes as African peoples. For a fact, our African Indigeneity is always in question. Our claims to land and soil are always suspect and even our histories of Euro-colonialism are repeatedly contested and discounted. We are continually confronted with epistemic humiliation. The questioning of, and skepticism toward, the “African Indigenous” has not been by non-Africans alone. There are many of us African learners schooled and steeped in Euro-centrism and colonial education who still doubt the value of our knowledge systems and ask if these knowledges are of any use in addressing contemporary new age [science and technology] change and advancements. Interestingly, we do not even see the contradictions and ironies when we use Eurocentric lens to evaluate the validity and veracity of our own cultural knowledges! How do we come to act on the coloniality of knowledge and power and the ways these operate in our learning and within our educational spaces? We need to uncover and topple oppressive discourses and the mechanisms of colonial education that parades forcefully in our academies (schools, colleges, and universities) as the only sources and sites of “valid” scientific knowledge. We need multiple knowledge systems that allow us as learners to exert own intellectual agencies in constructing, interrogating, and validating complex histories, epistemologies, and sociology of knowledge. We need to reclaim our intellectual agency to offer multiple and counter-epistemes and subaltern and sub-intern readings of our worlds. We must challenge the assumed false scientific superiority and efficacy of Western knowledge systems. Decolonizing knowledge in the Western academy is an important starting point for everyone. Decolonizing African education can never be pursued with Western science knowledge at the center. African scholars and our Africanists have a responsibility to think through new/counter analytical systems for understanding our communities informed by historicizing the intellectual developments in our various disciplines and how African knowledge has been integral to global knowledge production. More importantly, we also have to understand African Indigenous knowledges in their holism and touching on the dialectics and relations of Islamic/Muslim, African, and Western education. “African Indigenism” is a knowledge perspective emanating from a body of thought rooted in African historical, material, economic, political, sociocultural, and spiritual ontologies and lived realities. It is for its wholeness that African Indigenous knowledge has served different and multiple purposes in society. It has become a powerful source and site of knowing to resist the colonial encounter and its aftermath.\n\nxii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nBut let us be emphatic. Our decolonial and anti-colonial politics is not to integrate Indigenous knowledge into the orbit of science knowledge in the academy to make the academy look “good and inclusive” on paper. Like Kuokkanen (2008), we call on the academy to take its responsibilities seriously and acknowledge its shortcomings and the parochial dangers of simply working with the established processes and norms of knowledge production, interrogation, validation, and dissemination. Indigenous knowledge must be seen as Indigenous peoples’ “gift to the academy” (Kuokkanen 2008, 65). But this gift must not be received on the terms that focus on “possibilities of ‘inclusion’ of Indigenous ways of knowing into a predefined normalized order of schooling” (Ahenakew et al. 2014, 220). It must be seen as “a gift” [not to place such knowledge merely at the service of schooling and education] but to radically change conventional schooling and education into a new education order informed and guided Indigenous philosophies and multicentric worldviews. As these authors note the “integration and valorization of Indigenous knowledges within [current schooling and educational context has become] selective, tokenistic and utilitarian” (Ahenakew et al. 2014, 221). In effect, the engagement of Indigenous knowledges must lead to radical new possibilities and new educational futures for learners. No knowledge that is worth pursuing critical educational change can be wrestled out of, abstracted from outside its source, abode or context. In order to [re]conceptualize African Indigenous knowledge system, we must locate these cultural knowings as epistemologies and ontologies grounded on the land, waters, and the sky and as constitutive of both placed-based knowledges and Earth-wide teachings. Our relations to a place offer a significant knowledge base to work with and to understand our complex histories, cultures, identities, as well as the challenges of contemporaneous lived realities and our journeys to new futures. For African and other Indigenous peoples, our ancestral heritage and memories constitute a powerful cultural resource knowledge base. We need an enduring presence of Indigenous knowledge as critical philosophies that reveal “the persistent need of [all peoples] to find meaning in their lives” and to construct their sense of collective existence and well-being” (Kronenberg 2014, 29). We advocate African cultural knowledges to produce counter anti-colonial representations of our lives to the troubling colonized and imperial representations that masquerade as “knowledge” in the Western academy and its colonial satellites. Such knowledges often challenge the imperial representations of African lives and experience and become a relevant lens for interrogating colonial narratives. It is indeed this intellectual goal to subvert, destabilize, and offer counter-perspectives to the normalized discursive conversations that also present the hostility to Indigenous knowledges in academia. The anti-Indigenous hostility is revealed when we utilize Eurocentric lens to evaluate the worth of Indigenous knowledge or begin to question the “theory” behind such bodies of knowledge and Indigenism as if local peoples lack “theory.” Both the coloniality of science and the science of racism are filled with pitfalls not to mention the whole attempt to use a positivist science language\n\nFOREWORD\n\nxiii\n\nto understand our complex lived realities. There has historically been the coloniality of science in the sense of how science and “scientific knowledge” have served oppressive and colonizing ends. This has been effected through the delegitimation, invalidation, and negation of knowledge systems, experiences, and histories of subordinated and Indigenous groups. We must speak of Indigenous sciences and philosophies and what they bring to knowledge. In producing counter-discourses, we need a new knowledge base that challenges what we know of Western science and the dismissal of the subjective, emotional, and spiritual accounting. African Indigenous knowledges are embodied socially, physically, and metaphysically, residing in the spiritual, material, and concrete realms of African peoples’ lives and social existence. Spirituality, specifically spiritual ontologies and spiritual epistemologies are legitimate ways of knowing and the project of counter-knowledging requires upholding the place of spirituality, emotions, dreams, and visions in the Western academy. I will conclude by highlighting the five (5) inter-related contributions that a study of African education and Indigenous knowledge brings to global knowledge production. These are matters meriting the qualitative value of intellectual/educational justice: First is the question of what Indigenous African education offers in our understanding “epistemic plurality,” and why and how it is important that the search for multi-epistemes is advanced when diverse knowledges from different geographies are taken into account. There are different worldviews and multiple centers of knowledge, as well as forms of education. The ways we come to know and make sense of our worlds are heavily embedded in our histories, cultures, and relations to physical and metaphysical realms of existence. Insisting upon “epistemic plurality” is an acknowledgment of the powerful force of multiple ways of knowing and the education of young learners as a critical component of decolonization. We cannot seek to subvert the colonial and imperial relations of schooling and education without taking seriously the place of Indigenous epistemologies and philosophies in offering counter readings of our world. There are also different philosophies of education. All learners must know about the philosophical foundations of African education and the connections with Indigenous knowledges and how this implicates the processes of educational delivery. The rich history of African education and how such education was approached is an important source of learning. Western education has much to learn from African education, least of which is the knowledge base that has historically driven such education. And, it must be noted that to speak of African education we should go back to precolonial education, and in fact, to education of local communities even before there was the colonial naming “Africa.” Perhaps, much more importantly, we need such studies to help challenge binary models that treat Africa as the recipient of Western-styled education, without leaving room for the possibilities of Indigenous African education, which has roots in precolonial times. Such Indigenous education has implications for all learners and more specifically, Black learners in the diasporan contexts who trace ancestry to Africa.\n\nxiv\n\nFOREWORD\n\nSecond, there is the question of how to arrest/stem our own epistemicide when diverse cultural knowledges are continually deemed not worthy of engagement in schooling and education. For African scholars, the problem of epistemicide is seen in the disturbing failure for us to continue to “ ­ pioneer new analytical systems for understanding our own communities steeped in our own home-grown cultural perspectives” (Yankah 2004, 25). African scholars have a particular responsibility not only to understand our communities and educational systems, but also to begin to appreciate the knowledge base underneath our social and communal practices for our own intellectual agencies. This does not mean African epistemes are all we need to learn, know, and act on. But this knowledge base must be an important grounding from which to engage global knowledge. This cultural resource knowledge base is embedded in the making key theories in most of our so-called academic disciplines. As has long been noted, Africa has historically been a source of data for generating much of the key philosophical ideas that undergird our academic disciplines (see Bates et al. 1993). When we are not rooted in our local cultural knowledges, our claim as “knowing agents” is false, and we are unable to justify any legitimate calling as “intellectual agents.” As Nyamnjoh (2012) rightly notes, we merely become “intellectual imposters” in the Western academy. Resisting our ongoing epistemicide ensures that we demand our rightful place as knowledge producers, intellectual subjects, and not simply knowledge receivers or consumers. I raise this point not to dismiss some of the intellectual strides made in African philosophies and in other disciplines by African scholars. I am asking us to use our local cultural knowledge base to advance new analytical systems for studying and understanding our communities, and to advance “African solution to our African problems.” To put it bluntly, we can no longer continue to rely on borrowed European [Eurocentric] intellectual lenses to read our communities! Third is for us to see the connection between the sociology of knowledge and epistemology as a call for action. To understand local epistemes, we need to grasp the social relations of knowledge production as a fundamental question of power and power relations. So we must begin to ask some questions: How do certain knowledges become powerful epistemes deemed worthy of pursuit? What are the schooling and educational processes that ensure that particular knowledges get counted as valid, legitimate, and worthy of pursuit and why other knowledges are dismissed? This focus helps us to look at how colonial relations of knowledge, hierarchical relations of schooling, and political and discursive practices manifest themselves in everyday cultural politics of schooling and relations of ruling. It helps us to look critically at the way some learners get through the educational system without knowing much about their own histories, cultures, and community contributions to global knowledge. Beyond these questions, there is a call to action of knowledge. This means it is not enough for us simply “to know.” As the saying goes “to know is to act.” Knowledge must compel action. So, for African scholar, the necessity to couple our scholarly engagements with political action is paramount.\n\nFOREWORD\n\nxv\n\nAs already affirmed, our search for new knowledge must go beyond ­curiosity. In this regard, the pursuit of African education and Indigenous knowledge must make real, meaningful, and practical difference in the lives of our peoples and communities. We evoke Indigenous knowledge because it offers possibilities out of the current “miseducation” and intellectual malaise, assisting us to relate more to our communities as the only way to know about our own Indigeneity. Consequently, we must use Indigenous bodies of knowledge to question and to act to change schooling and education. This is the only way we can respond to and address the crisis over the legitimacy of knowledge in the Western academy. Fourth, to reiterate, affirming African education and Indigenous knowledge has an important intellectual project of theorizing the understanding of “Indigenous” and “Indigeneity” as international categories. This is very significant given that as African bodies our Indigeneity located in different geographies is hardly spoken of and validated, especially when we are confronted with discussions of colonialism and settler colonialism (see Dei 2017). There is the Indigenous of/in different geographies—Africa, Caribbean, Canada/ Turtle Island, USA, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, etc. No one geographic space or location and its legitimate claim to the Indigeneity must be advanced to the exclusion or dismissal of the African Indigeneity. We may contest, complicate, and even problematize the “Indigenous” but, as African peoples, we can never allow anyone to take our Indigenous away from us. We allow this to happen at our own intellectual and decolonial peril. To reaffirm Indigenous is very much connected to the land. If for nothing at all, the Land/Earth teachings alone are enough for us to hang on to the claim of Indigenous in our own learning as counterpart of European colonialism. As argued in Dei (2018), land is something we all have claims to, and can relate to, at and from somewhere. Every living subject is entitled to develop an association to land, and/or to have social, cultural, physical, and emotional ties to land. It is a “claim to past, culture, history, and rootedness/heritage, as well as spiritual and psychic memories [and unfortunately] it is the colonial mindset and through an imperial process that enables the dominant self/ group to dispossess the Other of their Lands” and to claim as such dispossessed and as their own (Dei 2018, 227). Last is the question of African educational futurity. This is a huge concern that must be approached simply with a sustained critique of Eurocentricity and the urgency of us “writing back” to the imperial narrative. The colonial of Western science knowledge lies beyond the devaluation and delegitimation of our knowledge systems to a curtailing of our individual and ­collective abilities to think and dream new futures. Making this point is not placing Europe at the center nor positing reaction discourse to Europe and the West. It is a realization of the enduring impact of the colonial project in schooling and education that call for action to transcend the mind, to the body, soul, and spirit. Colonial knowledge has a way of subverting our thinking. Yet “something else is possible” and we must be able to dream and produce new\n\nxvi\n\nFOREWORD\n\nvisions. As African scholars, we must be advancing new ideas grounded in our Indigenous systems of thought and cultural perspectives to be able to think through new educational possibilities for the future. In the politics of futurity, we must confront the question of advancing new speculative imaginaries informed by our Indigenous epistemes [including African-centered intellectual paradigms] in order to envision new educational and social futures for our communities. We have a very rich intellectual tradition to assist the project of new futurity. I have repeatedly insisted that given that colonialism was an irritating, materially and spiritually, consequential interrupter, the question of “what might have been had colonialism not disturbed the African way forward” should offer enough political impetus and intellectual guidance to continue to explore the new future.

From African civilizations’ Indigenous education systems to Islamic and Western education systems, they reflect an expansive and complex knowledge base. Each African ethno-nation or civilization’s education system demonstrates African epistemologies and their ongoing negotiation of other education systems within their contemporary contexts. Indigenous education systems continue today and often reflect cross-cultural influences that began centuries ago with early Islamic and European contacts. These contacts evolved across colonial and postcolonial periods resulting in the establishment or imposition of their education systems on African soil. Today, every African nation-state or country has established these imported or imposed education systems as their formal national system of education. Yet, in most cases, African Indigenous education continues to be the societal foundation of every ethno-nation and continually negotiates knowledge production and ways of knowing parallel to and within the nation-states’ Western or Islamic/ Muslim education systems. This negotiation often serves as a check and balance to neocolonial frameworks that survived the colonial period and results in a syncretic educational experience. The threat to this syncretic process is that most Indigenous education systems are not fully recognized or supported within nation-states; as a result, more Africans are exposed to formal Western and/or Islamic or Muslim education; Indigenous education systems are losing ground in maintaining and advancing knowledge production and its distribution across generations. Since its beginning of Western academic training in and about Africa, African studies was fraught with misconceptions about African education. It was often described as non-existent. In the early imposition of Western education in Africa, African education was often viewed as non-existent or as cultural elements with no institutional structure, as Ofori-Attah (2006) summarized: xvii\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION: AFRICAN EDUCATION’S MULTIPLE SYSTEMS\n\nTherefore, African forms of spirituality, including music, dancing, art, and religious practices were all excluded from the colonial curriculum. The African learner thus had no hope of learning or acquiring skills of immediate relevance to the community, and curricula were aligned with the interests of missionaries and British colonial government as in all colonies in Africa, North and South America, Asia, or the Caribbean. … There was no need to align the curriculum with African social and cultural practices, as these were all diametrically opposed to the European way of life and Christian ethics…. curriculum were intended to transform the African, in his own environment, to serve the needs of a colonial government and a new African society. (Ofori-Attah 2006)\n\nThe above excerpt is reflective, not only of Western education perspectives, but also the common absence of any recognition of African education systems by scholars from the beginning of Western academic discourse on African studies until the late 1990s. This absence of academic discourse held true with only minor exceptions. During the 1970s as Indigenous peoples’ movements gained significant momentum on an international level, a wellspring of attention was focused on Indigenous civilizations’ social institutions. Africa Indigenous civilizations or ethno-nations are older than and more cohesive in many ways than their modern counterparts, nation-states with their colonial constructed boundaries. As Indigenous education institutions came under study, complex epistemologies were exposed with knowledge production and learning methodologies so integrated into the society; that systems more often than not survived colonialism largely intact. Indigenous education became a valid discipline as one outcome of the deconstruction of imperialist assumptions. These Indigenous movements coalesced on an international level in the recognition and adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007). This global recognition and discussion of “Indigenous” as other than state civilizations brought with it the social and academic space to study these ethno-national education systems. While most African civilizations are not legally identified as “Indigenous” by UN guidelines within the nation-state of their residence, they are identified in comparable terms as tribes, societies, civilizations or ethno-nations, and as such equate with any other civilization, as stated in this UN declaration of rights with, “inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies, especially their rights to their lands, territories and resources” (United Nations 2007, 2). Such recognition of African civilizations may be viewed as a Second African Renaissance. As Nnamdi Azikiwe described African Renaissance in Western terms of a university based on African philosophy and knowledge (Azikiwe 1968), now African civilizations are again cognizant of their Indigenous educational structures and how these systems through their production and transfer of knowledge act as the keeper and vanguard of their societies. To better reflect societal parity across systems, this Handbook’s editor uses “ethno-national”\n\nINTRODUCTION: AFRICAN EDUCATION’S MULTIPLE SYSTEMS\n\nxix\n\nor ­ “ethno-nation” to identify each African civilization’s unique societal attributes as documented through their cultural, economic, education, government/political, language, and religious institutions. Use of this terminology recognizes African civilizations as independent societies that historically and currently interact with European or Western civilizations. As such, these terms reflect the tenets of Pan-African and Liberation or Critical Pedagogy theories that seek to challenge the academic status quo that too often accepts African civilizations as subject to first the colonial state and later the neocolonial nation-state rather than as equitable agents within both eras (see Abidogun 2013; Creary 2012; Dei 2011; Freire 1998; Giroux 2001; Kapoor 2009). African education today is accurately described as a multi-tiered system with Indigenous education as its center and Islamic or Muslim and Western education acting as official nation-state systems. In this volume, Islamic or Muslim education systems are not referring to solely religious instruction or a strictly religious-based education system, rather they are education systems that identify as serving culturally based African Muslim societies. As such, this may refer to a segment of an ethno-national civilization, e.g. Muslim Yoruba; or it may refer to an ethno-nation self-identified as a Muslim society, e.g. Wolof or Jolof. Islam religion and Muslim culture were brought to and developed over centuries in Africa; its history is not based on colonial imposition but on political, religious, and cultural adaptions. The Palgrave Handbook of African Education and Indigenous Knowledge is unique in that to date it is the first fully African-focused work to present Africa’s Indigenous education systems on par with nation-state education systems. On a Western education basis, UNESCO tracks the nation-state education statistics faithfully for the continent, but there is little to no attention made to Indigenous education in these reports. Case in point, the goal is not how to understand and support Indigenous education, but how to further transplant Western education into the minds of nomadic or rural civilizations. For example, Nigeria’s National Commission for Nomadic Education reported as its primary goal to provide literacy skills to Fulani people with the aim of bringing Western education to them (2002, 1). In the past two decades, education scholars increasingly focused on the role of Indigenous education systems as a foundation of African civilizations and how these systems engage Islamic and Western education systems to shape their curricula. A review of the more prominent education scholars and their works provides an indication of the breadth of research sweeping the continent. While each of these scholars contributes invaluable work to understanding African education, there is currently no one inclusive volume that references the variety of African education systems in their structures, roles, and impact across the continent. This inclusive aspect is why The Palgrave Handbook of African Education and Indigenous Knowledge (HAEIK) is a distinct and valuable contribution to African and Education studies around the world. HAEIK offers several features to assist African studies and Education studies scholars, ­policy-makers, and students.\n\nxx\n\nINTRODUCTION: AFRICAN EDUCATION’S MULTIPLE SYSTEMS\n\nHAEIK offers a comprehensive survey of the field of African education, by providing historical and contextual overviews of education systems within the continent. These historical and contextual overviews are coupled with specific examples or case studies in each chapter to demonstrate the multiple historical and contemporary influences and the resulting range of educational models across the continent. In addition, it describes African education knowledge production to highlight their contributions and ongoing developments. In this way, Indigenous knowledge is held constant as the foundation of each African civilization, while other systems, such as Islamic and Western education, are discussed in their more regional or more recent development on the continent. The interaction of these education systems both contributes to and hinders knowledge production as there is a constant negotiation and synthesizing of both knowledge and learning methods as demonstrated through the examples and case studies. Consistent in HAEIK is the recognition that regardless of the education system’s origin (i.e. Muslim or Western) the African civilizations, who adopted it or who it was imposed upon, created changes in the system through adaptation of knowledge (content) and methods (instruction) through their participation in each system. The volume is divided into four parts based on four primary areas of research. These areas include histories of education; Indigenous education systems; Islamic or Muslim education; and contemporary African ­education’s role in the wider society. Part I Africa Histories of Education consists of eight chapters dedicated to exploring the evolution of African education in historical perspectives as well as the development of its three primary systems—Indigenous, Islamic or Muslim, and Western education models—and how African societies have maintained and changed their approaches to education within and across these systems. Part II Africa Indigenous Education and Knowledge includes nine chapters that examine African Indigenous education and Indigenous knowledge to describe their contemporary structures, content, and methods and to discuss the nature and vitality of Indigenous education across the continent. Part III Islamic or Muslim African Education in Contemporary Africa contains nine chapters that cover African societies who adopted and adapted Islam by regional area with case studies to highlight Islamic and Muslim education’s contemporary role and impact on Africa today. Part IV African Education: National or Neocolonial Constructions? presents twelve chapters on contemporary African education systems and contemplates the variation and extent of their roles within African societies. These chapters examine African nation-states’ norm of Western-structured institutions infused with varying amounts of Afrocentric curriculum and methodology. Each asks questions that raise questions about African education’s role in developing and maintaining Africa for Africans and whether its current national systems empower Africa or foster neocolonialism. The Palgrave Handbook of African Education and Indigenous Knowledge provides an opportunity for new and established scholars of African education to re-engage their own and other education scholars’ arguments and\n\nINTRODUCTION: AFRICAN EDUCATION’S MULTIPLE SYSTEMS\n\nxxi\n\nthoughts about African education systems. These scholars highlight the education systems’ multiple roles and impact on the wider society. They describe the global connections within these education systems through research and interrogation of historical and contemporary issues, including but not limited to, knowledge construction, education technologies, and ­ ethno-national, neocolonial, gendered, and privileged education constructs. Finally, HAEIK serves as a foundational pedagogical text that brings together work currently scattered across regions and time periods produced from a range of disciplines. This volume is a necessary reference for African studies scholars and students, whether their interest is anthropology, education, gender studies, history, philosophy, religion or another discipline; these disciplines are all impacted by African knowledge and its production and distribution. It is designed to demonstrate the historical and contemporary intersections of African education across the continent as well as within the global context. Engaging scholars and general readers alike in the complexity of Africa’s multifaceted education systems with an eye to highlight the depth and variety of Africa’s rich pedagogical heritage. It is essential that we thank Palgrave for their academic insight to support the production of this volume. Their technical assistance and patience in production cannot be overstated in moving the content from the laptop to the reader. Special thanks to Nathan McCormack, cartographer, who worked with the editors to accurately present African civilizations’ multiple and ongoing transformations. These maps speak directly to the vastness of the continent and the necessarily layered interactions of education systems. Finally, gratitude and appreciation are offered to each contributor, whose ­scholarship and commitment to Africa made African education come to life on these pages in all its complexity. The editors applaud the work presented here as affirming African knowledge and education in all its forms. Jamaine M. Abidogun\n\nReferences Abidogun, J.

These chapters present insights into the process of resistance, accommodation, and transformation of Indigenous education in relationship to the introduction of Islamic/Muslim and later Christian and Western education.\n\n2 Part I: Africa Histories of Education\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIntroduction to Africa’s Educational Wealth Toyin Falola\n\nThis chapter discusses the relevance of formal education, the “ins and outs” of higher tertiary education—focusing on their various categories and the necessity of creating and maintaining excellent higher institutions—the empowerment that good education offers, formal education’s connection with nation-building and citizenship, and society’s overall benefit from education. It also highlights two crucial issues: technology’s impact and our need to expand opportunities for women. It closes with an overall reflection on the future of higher education.\n\nInvestment in Education in Africa: Citizenship, Development, and Nation-Building Higher education is essential in many ways. Secondary education, on its own, plays a crucial role in developing a nation and its citizens. It comes at a key point in a young person’s life: the transition between early education and either the labor market or advanced studies. In fact, the importance of secondary education is growing rapidly as the demand for skilled workers increases. The challenge of secondary education is to provide skills and knowledge to those students who are hoping to enter the workforce immediately, while also preparing other students to further their education at the tertiary level. Education can bring many positive changes, driving economic growth and development while delivering financial returns to individuals (Faruqui et al. 2017). Unfortunately, secondary education in much of Africa T. Falola (*) Department of History, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA e-mail: [email protected] © The Author(s) 2020 J. M. Abidogun and T. Falola (eds.), The Palgrave Handbook of African Education and Indigenous Knowledge, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38277-3_1\n\n3\n\n4 T. FALOLA\n\nfails at this objective, lacking quality and accessibility for students (Fredriksen and Fossberg 2014). The thorny educational issues facing African countries include a shortage of excellent secondary schools, ill-trained teachers, poor equipment, outdated curriculum, and the high cost of school fees. Poorly prepared students are ending up in universities that have difficulty correcting all of the major gaps in their development. Much of Africa is under pressure to expand and improve its higher education systems, and that pressure will increase substantially over the coming decades. Higher education development is challenged by rapid population growth, increasing demand for skilled workers, and growing numbers of people enrolling in and completing their primary education. These challenges mean that most African countries must work to expand enrollment in secondary schools, strengthen institutions and the role of educators, and revamp educational programs to benefit all citizens and align with national development goals. In the coming years, higher education in Africa must be transformed to meet the demands of an ever-increasing population and work toward building stronger national economies. Labor markets in Sub Saharan Africa are evolving and diversifying, but higher education systems in Africa must accommodate these economic changes. Africa’s labor force is transitioning from informal farming jobs to manufacturing and service-sector jobs; they require knowledge and skills provided by accessible, high-quality education. Investing in secondary and tertiary education can improve human capital, or the economic value of a worker’s skill set, laying the foundation for the economic growth that many African countries so desperately need. According to the World Bank, Sub Saharan Africa’s sustained economic growth and its participation in the global economy are unlikely without improving its human capital (ibid.). Enrollment steadily increases in Africa’s private schools: the current estimate, at 20% of the student population, is expected to increase to one in four by 2021. Increased use of technology, rapid urbanization, and the emergence of an African middle class have advanced "
