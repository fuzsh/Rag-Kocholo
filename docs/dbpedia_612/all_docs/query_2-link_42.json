        "text": "Washington DC is the federal capital of the US and sits at the beating heart of the nation’s political and cultural scene. The city is peppered with monuments many along the National Mall. The nation’s history is preserved in the city’s famous museums including the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress (the largest in the world) and the National Archives, which house the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution.\n\nWashington DC is a bustling city that lives and breathes politics and its downtown restaurants buzz with the gossip of political aides and White House staffers. Many lobbying groups, professional bodies, trade unions and international organisations have their headquarters in the city.\n\nWith so much culture and history, it is no surprise that the district also has some of the most prestigious universities in the country. Students wishing to study in Washington DC will find an exciting, student-friendly city to explore and all the opportunities that come with living and studying at the political heart of the US. If you want to study in Washington DC, it is important to find the right university.\n\nThese are the best universities in Washington DC based on the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education US College Rankings 2022.\n\n1. Georgetown University\n\nGeorgetown University is a private research university in the historic Georgetown district of Washington DC. Founded in 1889, Georgetown is the oldest Catholic university in the US. The university has a prestigious reputation to match its historic roots and alumni include former US president Bill Clinton, as well as more than a dozen foreign heads of state.\n\nGeorgetown has fewer than 20,000 students, with the majority studying at postgraduate level. Some 11 per cent of its student body is made up of international students from more than 130 countries. The university has also opened campuses in Italy, Turkey and Qatar.\n\nUndergraduate degrees in 48 majors are offered through the university’s four undergraduate schools. Five of the university’s schools offer master’s degrees. Georgetown’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service is renowned for its teaching in international affairs and about 50 per cent of Georgetown undergraduates across all subjects spend time studying overseas. The university’s prestigious law school sits on Capitol Hill alongside the Supreme Court and the White House.\n\nGeorgetown is also respected for the quality of its research. The institution’s focus on internationalisation extends into its research efforts as well, with $5.6 million donated by the US Department of Education to fund fellowships in international studies.\n\n2. George Washington University\n\nNamed after the first president of the US, George Washington University is a private research university founded in 1821 as a result of President Washington’s stated desire that there should be a world-class institution of higher learning in the new nation’s capital. The university consistently ranks highly in the US and is respected for the quality of its teaching and research.\n\nThe university is divided into 10 colleges and schools: the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the College of Professional Studies, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Medicine & Health Sciences, the Law School, the School of Nursing, and the Graduate School of Education and Human Development.\n\nThe central location of the main campus, just minutes from the White House and the Lincoln Memorial put George Washington University at the heart of the political action.\n\nFamous alumni include former US Secretary of State Colin Powell and former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nBrits in America: experiencing the US political machine\n\nHow a scholarship helped me land my dream job\n\n3. Howard University\n\nHoward University has always had a strong focus on inclusivity and equality. The university has more than 8,000 students studying a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications.\n\nSubjects are divided across 13 different schools and colleges and there are graduate schools in business, nursing, engineering, pharmacy, law, social work, education, communications, art, science, divinity, dentistry, and medicine.\n\nThe university campus covers 256 acres in the northwest of Washington DC. The campus has several historical buildings as well as an art gallery, which opened in 1928, housing more than 4,000 works of art. The university has 10 residence halls on and off campus.\n\nAmong the many respected research institutions at Howard University is The Beltsville Center for Climate System Observation, a NASA University Research Center that works in partnership with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nNotable alumni from Howard University include current US vice-president Kamala Harris, actors Taraji P Henson and Chadwick Boseman and author Zora Neale Thurston.\n\nTop universities in Washington DC 2022"
