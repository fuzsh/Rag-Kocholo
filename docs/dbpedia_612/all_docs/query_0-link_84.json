Try out the HTML to PDF API PRO version pdfcrowd.com Sakkara ByKhaled Diab —begin forwarded message— CAIRO (Reuters) - A tomb dating back to the reign of New Kingdom Pharaoh Amenhotep IV in the 14th century BC has been discovered in the Giza suburb of Sakkara, an antiquities official said on Sunday. \"This is a unique discovery because it is the first time we have uncovered a tomb in Sakkara from the reign of Akhenaton, who had his capital at Akhetaton (now called Tel al-Amarna) in Upper Egypt,\" Adel Hussein, director of Sakkara at the Supreme Antiquities Council, told Reuters. The tomb once occupied by the high priest Meryneith, whose name means \"the beloved of Neith (goddess of war and hunting),\" was discovered by a Dutch-Egyptian archaeological mission on January 31 during excavation of New Kingdom tombs at Sakkara. The excavation work, which is still under way, has so far uncovered two store rooms in the east of the tomb, three small chapels in the west, wall reliefs that include depictions of funeral rituals, five columns with hieroglyphic inscriptions and a burial chamber, Hussein noted. \"No mummies have yet been uncovered, but we have come across bones. There is a good chance we will find a mummy once excavation work on the burial chamber is complete,\" he added. Hussein sees the discovery as an addition to our knowledge of the reign of Amenhotep IV and Sakkara, which was used as a site for pyramids and tombs from the first Pharaonic dynasties. In his quest to unify Egypt in the worship of a single deity, Aton -- a form of the sun-god Ra the 18th dynasty ruler Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaton, meaning \"it pleases Aton,\" and built a new capital in Amarna dedicated to Aton and called it \"Akhetaton\" (the Horizon of Aton). Akhenaton, a religious hard-liner who provoked the wrath of the powerful Amun priesthood, among others, for his reforms, is said by some scholars to have been the world's first monotheist. He ruled from 1353-36 BC. 1 10|2001-02-14 09:02:42|kekai@jps.net|Re: PBS Program Delves into Mysterious End of 18th Dynasty Egypt| I watched the PBS program last night.

Yes, they mention the theory but that's about all. Most of the experts had predicted that there was evidence of genetic disease only to be proven wrong in the end. Also, the show offered an answer as to whether the mummy at KV55 was Akhenaten or Tutankhamen's brother Smenkhkare.

Since the Harper-Collins Black Athena debate I've been otherwise occupied so far as Km.t-related issues are concerned. However, I recently picked up the novel Ramses, by Christian Jacq. As fiction it's good, but I wonder whether it's not just more Euro propaganda to paint Egypt white, with all the blonds, brunettes, redheads, and blue and green eyes around, sharply contrasted with alleged Nubian \"savages\". Anyhow, that's what prompted me to check back in with the Afrocentric debate. So I jumped when I came across your invitation on s.c.a.

I found \"Wonders of the African World\" should have been more correctly titled, \"Gates Wanders through Parts of Africa and Talks About Em1.\" I expected this series to be something like a Nova program or such TLC programs as \"Ancient Warriors\" or the like. But it was not very historical or cultural or even academic. it did have some of those things. But it seemed more like Gates' private vacation footage interlaced with his own opinions (that often were not based on history or anthropology or even academic interest). I didn't dislike it as much as many others did. Neither did I find it interesting enough however to watch a second time. In fact, at times it was near insulting to the Africans and myself. Perhaps the fact that Gates is a literary professor and not an African historian explained much of the series' shortcomings. Yet he claimed to have consulted a host of people... On Gates' and Egypt... Gates' left Egypt as an ambigous place upon which not to truly focus in his PBS series. He focused a bit more on Nubia. But even then, it did not feel like a true documentary on Nubia. It was more like a quick tour of some sites. I did not learn who the Nubians were, their history, customs, dress in ancient times, ancient religion, practices, etc. I just got to see some current ongoing digs in Sudan and listen to an Italian curator who proclaimed Taharka the \"first black pharaoh to sit upon the throne of Egypt.\" Gates' disdain for Afrocentric type thought has been seen in his writings. And his colleauges pursue much the same course. They practice the normal tricks of associating anyone who says anything approaching a \"black\" or \"African\" Egypt as all being lumped together in the same Africentric camp. Thus they mingle fringe elements with legitimate scholars. Yet, interestingly enough, they seek to attack research methodology and persons more than they ever really attack the information. In a class I recently took on Africa, our textbook was \"Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation.\" It was a very good book and is considered by many Africanists to containsome of the most influential and important works in the past 50 or so years on African studies. I was surprised to actually find an article byCheikh Anta Diop in there— near the end. It was basically a paper in which he defended his theories and discussed what his research hoped to achieve. Of course, my teacher did not assign that particular article for our class to read. Rather he assigned the article directly following. It was written by one of Gates' cohorts, Kwame Appiah (sp). Appiah's article, which interestingly enough follow's Diops, goes into a full frontal attack on Africentric or related scholarship. As many other critics, he fails however to attack the information presented by Africentric and related scholars. Rather he attacks their works as reverse-Eurocentric thought. Or he mockingly asks why Diop is supposedly the only source for Africentric thought. PRO version Are you a developer? Try out the HTML to PDF API pdfcrowd.com And it pretty much goes down hill from there. Again of interest, he never tries to attack Diop directly or challenge things Diop puts forth. Like most of the attackers, he skirts around the issue. I don't really know exactly where Gates' stands fully on the whole thing. That he doesn't like Africentric thought is no secret. He sees it as poor academics and \"feel good\" erroneous history at best. Such theories and even Diop are marginilized or ignored in his Microsoft based multimedia encyclopedia, Africana. (As most know his Africana was originally DuBois and Nkrumah's idea of an African Enyclopedia. Gates and Appiah approached the committee in Ghana to use the name. They refused. Gates and Appiah altered the name somewhat and took the idea to Microsoft. The original committe in Ghana is still upset.) Most especially, Gates attacks the Greek-Egypt debate as frivolous. But what does he think of an African cultural based and predominant African-black phenotype for pharaonic Egypt— I can't say for certain. Right after his PBS special, after receiving waves of criticism, Gates claimed that he was actually working to produce a documentary on the ancient Egyptians— their culture and predominant racial types. Most of his detractors groaned inwardly at the damage his program would cause. Gates told his detractors not to worry, and that they would be pleasantly surprised at what he was going to have to say. This supposed documentary has yet to air— if it was ever created at all. DG 1 25|2001-02-15 ll:57:08|kcamm23063@aol.com|Re: PBS Program Delves into Mysterious End of 18th Dynasty Egypt| I didn't realize Gates had any views on Africentrism. Speaking for myself, although I must admit I enjoyed the footage on Ethiopia and some of the other places, Gates should havs just kept his mouth closed. I, myself, am not an Africentric (however, I am African-centered), as I find this form of study too limiting, therefore, I read whatever I can get my hands on. There are some books out there that cost over $1,000 - those I would love to get my hands on. Nevertheless, I enjoy visiting Egypt and studying the ancient civilizations there and in other parts of Africa. Cairo University in Cairo is an excellent resource. Also, the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE), located in Garden City, has a pretty decent library of old books - though most are written in German. Sometimes I use the library when I need to identify something I may have seen in a tomb. I encourage folks who are serious about Egypt (beyond just saying \"the ancient Egyptians were black\"), to read whatexer is available, and by all means visit Egypt more than once. Even though I am not an Africentric, as an African, I do believe that we should research and write our own history. Also, my dream is the formulation of an all-African physical research team. We do have Africans in all the fields of \"ists\" and \"ologies,\" it's just a matter of them all coming together to build a team (then of course having to deal with Hiwass - LOL).

I agree, although it is interesting that Gates' himself has been labeled an 'Afrocentric Orientalist.' Thomas E.R. Maguire writes in \"The Islamic Simulacrum in Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s Into Africa\": \"The paradoxical nature of Gates' Afrocentric Orientalism stems from the very mission of Into Africa, the reclaiming of African history from the racist framework imposed by European colonialism. Though the series succeeds in reinventing the image of Africa without some of its traditional stereotypes, Gates succumbs to the same illness that afflicted other Africanist movements of the twentieth century. Biodin Jeyifo suggests that Into Africa engages in the \"reconfiguration of Senghorian negritude\"...\" The entire article can be read at: http://www.westafricareview.eom/war/voll.2/voll.2a/maguire.html > Right after his PBS special, after receiving waves of criticism, Gates> claimed that he was actually working to produce a documentary > on the ancient Egyptians— their culture and predominant racial types. > Most of his detractors groaned inwardly at the damage his program would> cause. > > Gates told his detractors not to worry, and that they would be > pleasantly> surprised at what he was going to have to say.

I did not attempt to \"dis-Africanize ancient Egypt.' Rather, I sought to accord ancient Nubia its due recognition. The difference is critical. I hope to deal with the question of the color of ancient Egyptians in a special one-hour documentary that will feature a wide array of experts. I would hope to invite Maulana Karenga, Molefi Asante, Dr. Ben and Martin Bernal among those to appear on camera. What do I think about this issue? Though not an expert, I suspect that if the average ancient Egyptian had PRO version pdfcrowd.com shown up in Mississippi in 1950, they would have been flung into the back of the bus. And that is black enough for me. But the fundamental fact, on which there is no reasonable disagreement, is that Egypt is first and last, an African civilization. (Mazrui mistakenly claims that lam speaking to a European guide at Abu Simbel. lam not. lam speaking to an Egyptian. That's a pretty good example of \"dis-Africanizing modern Egypt!\")'1 This seems to be a change from his earlier positions. I wonder if his actual physical visit to Egypt helped changed his mind. The entire article together with a link to Ali Mazrui's review can be found at: http://www.africana.com/index 19991117.htm#gates I also wonder if he ever completed this project.

In the far northern part of Sudan, in the Mahas region, you will find many ancient monuments, temples and pyramids. This is the land of the ancient Nubian (which in antiquity, extended from Khartoum to Aswan). In Cairo, at the Nubian Studies and Documentation Center, Nubians are working hard at preserving their ancient language and writing.

That tour never happened because neither Obenga nor Oba TShaka promoted it that well. Both of these brothas are friends of mine, we live in the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area. There are many scholars who conduct tours; however, once in Egypt, the tour is handed over to a government-employed tour guide who has been trained through the Egyptian Bureau of Tourism and must pass a government test. However, some of the top guides, like Farouk in Aswan, and Abou Naga Gabrail in Luxor may hold Ph.D.s in Egyptology - but all guides are considered Egyptologists once they pass the government exam. Dr. Patricia Newton (M.D.) gives tours to Egypt. I have found hers to be a more reasonable price (in some cases a thousand dollars less than others). The scholars do give lectures while there, but in many cases they cannot actually guide at a site. It is therefore wise to study well before you go. ASCAC has a good study program, and there are others such as ARCE, which actually has physical researchers in its membership. If one has never been to Egypt before, I recommend going with a tour organization so you can learn where everything is, then subsequent trips can be taken alone to allow for personal study. Also, there are times that I like to go for an early horseback ride, or spend the afternoon sailing in a felucca, all at my own time and expense. There are many things to see and do in Egypt.

Ok, that clears things up. I seem to faintly remember that Theophile Obenga and Molefi Asante had scheduled an Egyptian trip when Obenga was still at Temple.

You can save a lot going by yourself or with travel partners. I would not recommend going alone the first time unless you know some folks there or you are an experienced traveler.

To those unfamiliar with Dr. Theophile Obenga, he is a world renown linguist, and one of his specialties is the ancient Nilotic languages. He is from Brazaville, Congo, and is visiting professor here in the United States. Also, Obenga was the protege of Cheik Anta Diop, and he attended the UNESCO conference and made submissions in their books. I also do not recommend traveling alone to Egypt for the first time. Although it may be expensive to go with a tour, you will at least get a feel for the country much better with with a group. The first time I went to Egypt was for the 1987 ASCAC conference held in Aswan. I have been there six times in all. During the winter months tickets are very cheap - between $400 and $800 round trip from the USA. I haggle on prices when I get there, and I usually end up in a good 3-star hotel for which I pay anywhere from LEI 5 to LE30 per night. In USDs, that is about $6 to $18 per night. The 5-star hotels will charge $200-$250 USD per night. February of last year I went to Egypt from San Francisco from $650. I spent 4 or 5 days in Luxor (went to Abydos and Dendara, also). I guess I was in Egypt for about 10 days on that trip, and in all I spent about $800 (including the airfare). In Cairo, I stay with friends, which eliminates any costs there. Howevsr, when the summer came and I returned to Egypt, I ended up spending $2,000 for my air travel - as air travel inflated last summer. So I recommend winter travel. Also, it can get vary cold at night during the winter, temperatures can drop to 35 degrees, but during the day, the temperatures are between 70 and 80 (Cairo) and between 80 and 90 (southem/Luxor, etc.). I hope I am not sounding like an expert on Egyptian travel, I don't mean to. I know that one of the main reasons a lot of folks don't travel to Egypt is because of the cost, and I am just trying to show that one can travel there at a reasonable price.

That's a very good price. I was paying this much at hostels. ;) A great trip, if the political climate allowed, would start in the Great Lakes region and follow the Nile up to Egypt.

The Ishango culture was centered here and it seems related to what is generally known as the African Aqualithic or Saharo-Sudanese complex. Clyde Winters has suggested a Saharan Mande origin for this culture rather than a Great Lakes provenance. Wendorf suggests strong Eastern Saharan links but believes the ceramic tradition is Nilotic. Recent discoveries at Nabta Playa near the Egypt-Sudan border have confirmed early links with this southern culture: The earliest pottery in the 'Middle East' region is Sudanese in origin. Even the Nabta pottery is older than anything yet found in SW Asia. So, it would appear that the connection between 'wavy line' pottery of Sudan, early Delta pottery and early Levantine pottery can be traced to African influence and possibly to the migration of Afro-Asiatic peoples.

I have heard Kwesi lecture, but I never took a tour with him. One thing I noticed missing from his itinerary was the new Nubian Museum in Aswan. I hare only seen this museum on the itinerary of a few European tours, but African-American/Africentric tours hare yet to add it. This is where a lot of our history lies and it should be included on the tour packages. The following is an article taken from the Al-Ahram, May 2000, concerning Aswan (I hope it copies well): Rediscovering Aswan By Mursi Saad El-Din It has been some time since I was in Aswan, a city for which I hold many fond memories. My recent visit to view the works of international and Egyptian sculptors participating in the fifth Aswan Sculpture Symposium had me thinking about this wonderful city's wasted tourist potential. I find it so surprising that in today's tourist boom, Aswan continually fails to be presented as a destination in itself, instead being relegated to a mere transit point. Nile-cruising tourists may stop at Aswan for a day or night after spending time in Luxor or Abu Simbel. Visitors are whisked in for just long enough to be taken to the temple of Philae and a drire-by glimpse of the High Dam before they either embark on a three-day Nile or Lake Nasser cruise, or fly back to Cairo. What a waste. Consider how the typical tourist must feel after the onslaught of the usual Egypt tour. After a stay in Cairo, with its myriad monuments spanning a staggering swathe of Egypt's history and its deafening noise and unruly traffic, come hectic days taking in the temples of Luxor and possibly Abu Simbel. Aswan is the perfect haven amidst this chaos, with its warm weather pleasantly tempered by breezes drifting off the Nile and white-sailed feluccas gliding on the waters. A tree-lined comiche (Nile-side road) and exotic markets make for a soothing sojourn, but today's visitor finds that there is hardly time to recuperate before moving on. In the past, people knew better. Aswan was a resort for writers and British administrators in the 1920s and was known as a winter destination throughout the world. The Cataract Hotel was then the prime destination, hosting such illustrious guests as Sir Winston Churchill and the Agha Khan. Winding steps lead to a finely laid out garden, where the scent of jasmine wafted on the breeze and one could descend to the river to sail across to the Agha Khan Mausoleum, perched on a hill on the opposite bank of the Nile. It was well-known then that the Begum (the Agha Khan's widow) would go there every morning to place a red rose on his tomb. It was said that no one ever saw her make her pilgrimage; that she always went there at dawn, like a ghost. And rumour had it that whoever did see her, by chance, met an untimely death. Inaugurated in 1899, the Old Cataract Hotel, with its splendid dining room and great Mamelouke dome, can boast some pretty important guests, including King Farouk, Grace Kelley, British royalty and, in modem times, Princess Diana, President Mitterand and Imelda Marcos, wife of the former Philippine president. Visitors traditionally took afternoon tea on the hotel's elegant terrace overlooking Elephantine Island, with its great granite rocks turning red or black with shifting light. Adorned with palm grores, the island hosts an ancient Nilometer and a small archaeological museum. In the good old days, there was time to enjoy Aswan and take in the spirit of the city; to sail around the islands at sunset, meander in the markets and walk through the Nubian villages of Elephantine. Ererything that once drew an international set to this serene city remains there to be enjoyed, but today it is one mad rush. Aswan has so much to offer both in historical monuments and in what may be described as \"seasonal erents,\" yet the city's potential appeal is squandered by modern tour operators who assume tourists are simply not interested. In the meantime, the tourist is missing out. Which brings me to one seasonal event that would probably be of interest to visitors -- the Aswan International Sculpture Symposium, which takes place from February to April each year. I envisage promotion of the event as part of a whole tourist programme. A visitor during this three-month period could be taken to the granite quarries where rock has been extracted for the construction of Egypt's great monuments throughout the millennia. Tourists could visit the area next to Aswan's Basma Hotel, where they could watch the artists at work on their pieces for the symposium, and then on to the open-air museum on top of a hill orerlooking the city, where the results of the sculptors' endeavours are displayed. Aswan is famous for its granite quarries, which come in shades ranging from pink to red, gray to black and vary in texture fine-grained to heavy-grained. Here is an opportunity to combine it into a cultural tour. It is fascinating to watch the cutting of granite with modern drills and compare the process to that of the past, when rock was hammered out of the quarries with great balls of dolerite (the hardest of stones) by brute force. Tourists are missing out on so many unique experiences. A felucca trip to Kitchener's Island (today's Plants Island), with its huge botanical garden or the Palace of Culture, where folk dance troupes perform, is not on the tourist agenda because travel agencies rush their groups in and out of Aswan heading somewhere else. The list goes on. The wondrous new Nubian Museum, which was inaugurated in 1997, is a prime example of a missed opportunity. Gustave Flaubert in his travels in 1850 described Aswan as a \"negro landscape.\" Today it remains decidedly Nubian in spirit, not only because of the number of Nubians who settled in Aswan followina the Droaressire inundation of their land durina the Are you a developer? Try out the HTML to PDF API PRO version pdfcrowd.com construction (and heightening) of the original Aswan Dam and more recent High Dam, but also because some of the monuments rescued from Nubia during the UNESCO salvage operations in the 1960s are today displayed in the remarkable Nubian Museum. How sad that this great museum, which is frequented by large numbers of Nubians - men, women and children who are proud to see their heritage honoured - is seldom visited by tourists. They simply have no time. The Nubian Museum is not only a masterpiece of architecture, but it contains a remarkable collection that covers all aspects of Nubian history from pre-dynastic times to modem society. What struck me while visiting Aswan after such a long time was its tragic neglect by those who promote tourism. Here is a ready-made product with a wide variety of cultural and recreational possibilities. It is our job to change the tide and foster an interest in this worthy city. My advice: take another look at Aswan. Take time. You will not be disappointed.

Ancient Macedonia also had a severe Malaria problem (though this is debated today) which resulted in a high number of Mediterranean peoples with thalassemia— a related but different blood disorder than sicklemia. Sicklemia seems to be more related to black Africans. So I suppose those doing the study determined this disease among these early mummies was sicklemia and not thalassemia? I wonder how easy/difficult it is to tell the two apart?

The following abstract does not give any frequenices but it seems to indicate that sickle cell is not that uncommon in modern Egypt: J Trap Pediatr 1999 Feb;45(l):23-30 Growth and pubertal development in transfusion-dependent children and adolescents with thalassaemia major and sickle cell disease: a comparative study. Soli man AT, elZalabany M, Amer M, Ansari BM Department of Paediatrics, University of Alexandria Children's Hospital, Egypt. Despite regular blood transfusion and desferrioxamine treatment, growth impairment and pubertal delay are commonly seen in children and adolescents with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia and sickle cell disease (SCD).

Are you a developer? Try out the HTML to PDF API PRO version pdfcrowd.com On two days, traditionally the anniversary of the birthday and coronation of pharaoh Ramses II, a shaft of sunlight pierces the gloom, illuminating statues of gods and the king in the temple's inner sanctum. On February 22, a day celebrating the king's birthday and again on October 22, a day celebrating his coronation, sunlight illuminates seated statues of the sun gods Re-Horakhte and Amon-Re, as well as a statue of king Ramses II. The statues sit in the company of the Theban god of darkness, Ptah (who remains in the shadows all year). Seated between Amen-Re to his left and Re-Harkhti to his right, the statue of Ramses II has greeted the rising sun twice a year for the past 3,200 years at Abu Simbel. The spectaclewhich has endured more than 3,200 years of Egyptian historydraws thousands of tourists to Abu Simbel to watch this ancient tribute to a pharaoh whose name is still known up and down the Nile Valley for his military exploits and monumental building projects. Temple of a God-King Ramses, who ruled Egypt for 66 years from 1270 to 1213 BC (about 50 years after the death of Tutankhamen, better known as King Tut) made a name for himself by battling the Hittites and the Syrians, Egypt's enemies to the north. To celebrate his victories, Ramses erected monuments up and down the Nile with records of his achievements. He completed the hypostyle hall at Karnak (Thebes), and completed the funerary temple of his father, Seti I, at Luxor on the West Bank of the Nile. The main temple at Abu Simbel, which Ramses ordered built near the border of Nubia and Upper Egypt, was dedicated to two sun gods, Amen-Re and Re-Horakhte. Standing 100 feet (33 meters) tall, the temple was carved into an already-standing sandstone mountain on the banks of the Nile. Four colossal statues of Ramses, each 66 feet (22 meters) high, guard the entrance to the temple. Rising to the pharaoh's knees are smaller statues of family members: his mother; favorite wife, Nefertari; and son, Prince Amonherkhepshef. Inside the temple, three connected halls extend 185 feet (56 meters) into the mountain. Images of the king's life and many achievements adorn the walls. A second temple at Abu Simbel is dedicated to Nefartari , who appears to have been Ramses' favorite wife. \"Abu Simbel was one of, if not the largest, rock-cut temples in Egypt,\" says Bruce Williams of the Oriental Institute of Chicago, \"The rock was sacred because the Egyptians believed the deity was living inside the mountain.\" Rock-cut temples may have been especially significant in ancient Egypt because the bulge in the otherwise flat land may have signified the location where the gods emerged from the Earth, says Williams.
