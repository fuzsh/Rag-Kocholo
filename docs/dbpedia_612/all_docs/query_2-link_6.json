With that comes membership to a community of over 5,000 fellow alumni, as well as access to career services for life.\n\nWe are proud of each and every one of our alumni, who excel in an astounding range of careers around the world. They have held positions including U.S. secretary of defense, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, chief financial officer at the U.S. Institute of Peace and sector commander in the Coast Guard, as well as serving as White House political appointees, nonprofit executives, CEOs and professors at prestigious universities.\n\nOur alumni play a vital role in recruiting the next generation of public servants. They offer one-on-one advice to an applicant, speak on behalf of TSPPPA at a graduate school fair, and sit on a panel to answer questions from prospective students. Please contact the TSPPPA director of admissions to volunteer to help recruit prospective students and advance the professional development of current students.\n\nGet Involved\n\nWHERE ALUMNI WORK\n\nAlumni Highlights"
