Market of educational services is already experiencing a significant influence of the demographic situation in Russia. This means that higher education institutions are forced to fight in a tough competition for high school students. Increased competition in the educational market forces universities to find new methods of non-price competition in attraction of potential students and throughout own educational and economic activities. Commercialization of education places universities in a single plane with commercial companies who study a positive perception of the image and reputation as a competitive advantage, which is quite acceptable for use in strategic and current activities of higher education institutions to ensure the competitiveness of educational services and educational institution in whole. Nevertheless, due to lack of evidence-based proposals in this area there is a need for scientific research in terms of justification of organizational and methodological aspects of image use as a factor in the competitiveness of the higher education institution. Theoretically and practically there are different methods and ways of evaluating the companyâs image.

Since then, the Brazilian privateâs higher education institutions are classified according to their legal nature: for-profit or non-profit. Nevertheless, the new law 12.881 of 2013, enacted in November 2013, has changed this reality after the approval by the National Congress, establishing the definition and purpose of the Community institutions, and confirming, in particular, their characteristics of non-profit institutions belonging to civil society, and their organization into associations or foundations (BRAZIL, 2013. The recent expansion of the federal and for-profit higher education institutions has directly affected the so far called communitarian institutions, which present differentiated characteristics compared to forprofit private higher education institutions as well as public education. In this article, data and contemporary aspects related to the new scenario of Brazilian higher education are analyzed, with special focus on higher education institutions members of the Association of Community Universities (ABRUC, and were found better performance of these ones in comparison to the private for-profit higher education institutions. The obtained results, combined with the regional impact of the communitarian higher education institutions, justify the importance of these institutions to improve the consolidation of higher education in Brazil.\n\nAn exploratory study on awareness towards institutional social responsibility in Indian higher education institutions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRicha Mishra\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Institutional Social responsibility (ISR in context to a Higher Educational Institution has been defined as the ethical practice in transference of knowledge, and the active participation in betterment of quality of life in the society. It is an offshoot of the concept of Corporate Social responsibility (CSR, but unlike CSR, it is neither mandatory nor actively monitored or researched in Indian context. However, awareness towards aspects of ISR has been increasing, especially in Indian Universities. Indian Universities adopt practices related to Adoption of Villages, Awareness Drives, Environmental Care and rural Education initiatives. Critics often see ISR as an unnecessary burden; review of literature from around the world suggests that ISR practices contribute to increased accountability towards exploitation of resources by Educational Institutes as well as better reputation of Educational Institutes in the society. The purpose of this paper is to examine the perception towards the concept of ISR in Educational Institutes in India. The paper opted for a questionnaire-based exploratory survey of 50 faculty members, across Private Universities in Rajasthan. The findings suggest lacking awareness but a significant acceptance of need of ISR practices. The paper includes implications for the Universities to include ISR practices in their strategy to address its obligations to the society and simultaneously gain a competitive advantage.\n\nTHE MODEL OF MANAGEMENT OF THE INTERNAL MARKETING OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYuliya Viktorovna Naurazbaeva\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The mainÂ purposeÂ of the research is the development of methods and models of management of the internal marketing of a higher education institute based on complex approach that includes strategic management methods and staff marketing and also technologies of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP.Method or methodology of the research.Â Adapted models and methods ofÂ Neuro-Linguistic Programming, strategic management and marketing to management of marketing of the university which are presented as a complex of models that are reveling through the interrelation Â«external labor-market âÂ higher education institute â internalÂ labor-marketÂ».Results:1.Â The mechanism of management of the internal marketing of higher education institute based on the interrelationÂ Â«external labor â market âÂ higher education institute â internalÂ labor-marketÂ» is offeredÂ that assumes solving problem of miscomparison between market conditions, universityâs opportunities and demands of an employee of this educational institute.2.Â Methodical bases of formation of NLP-model that coordinates the requirements of labor collective as internal consumers of the educational service and needs of higher education institute in order to provide high quality services at all stages of creation and realization of an educational service are developed.3.Â The infological model of construction and choosing the strategy of the internal marketing of educational institute is presented.Practical implications.Â The received results can be used in practical management of higher education institute when forming the strategy of the internal marketing taking into account the specific features of concrete university.\n\n76 FR 11765 - Education Research and Special Education Research Grant Programs; Institute of Education Sciences...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-03-03\n\n...

Among other conditions for effective strategies there are: aligning goals of the chosen strategy with the mission of higher education institution, correct choice of targeted segments of the market and of marketing tools. The article also gives a sample classification of marketing strategies based on these criteria, with emphasis on the fact, that every higher education institution employs its own strategy.\n\nGENDER VIOLENCE IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRosalva Ruiz-RamÃ­rez\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available School violence is multifactorial. Social and cultural, family, personal, and institutional aspects, among others, influence educational institutions, in all academic levels. Because this type of violence is increasingly common and has serious consequences, there is a need to prevent and deal with the different types of violence practiced in schools, such as bullying, mobbing, gender violence, and others. Gender violence in institutions is not produced in this scope, in the strict sense, but rather has its origin in social and cultural aspects, rooted in the patriarchal and androcentric culture. Much has been written on the different forms in which violence affects mostly women in the educational system. This essay, without being thorough, attempts to answer three basic questions on gender violence in educational institutions: Why is there gender violence in educational institutions? How is gender violence manifested in schools? And finally, what actions have been taken to mitigate aggressions against women?\n\nA Template Based System for Automatic Construction of Online Courseware for Secondary Educational Institutes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFotis Lazarinis\n\n2004-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Many educational sites are static and rarely updated, diminishing the dynamism of the Web. An online learning system should be adjustable, expandable and regularly updated, preferably by educational staff without the direct intervention of computer experts, reflecting the dynamic character of education. Î¤Î¿ achieve this aim, we propose a system based on three roles: Administrator, Educator and Learner. Each role has a different set of responsibilities and permissions to the system. The model is built around a repository of educational material, vital for its expandability and its dynamism. The repository contains a set of customizable templates, dynamically filled with the educational material, assembling the online course. This paper discusses current difficulties in developing online courses and then presents the development progress of such a system and its anticipated advantages to Secondary Educational Institutes.\n\nIMPROVEMENT OF QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM ACTIVITIES OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZ.

In Uganda, many health professional training institutions conduct some form of community-based education (CBE. However, there is scanty information on the nature of the training: whether a curriculum exists (objectives, intended outcomes, content, implementation strategy, administration and constraints faced. The objective was to make a comprehensive assessment of CBE as implemented by Ugandan health professional training institutions to document the nature of CBE conducted and propose an ideal model with minimum requirements for health professional training institutions in Uganda. Methods We employed several methods: documentary review of curricula of 22 institutions, so as to assess the nature, purpose, outcomes, and methods of instruction and assessment; site visits to these institutions and their CBE sites, to assess the learning environment (infrastructure and resources; in-depth interviews with key people involved in running CBE at the institutions and community, to evaluate CBE implementation, challenges experienced and perceived solutions. Results CBE was perceived differently ranging from a subject, a course, a program or a project. Despite having similar curricula, institutions differ in the administration, implementation and assessment of CBE. Objectives of CBE, the curricula content and implementation strategies differ in similar institutions. On collaborative and social learning, most trainees do not reside in the community, though they work on group projects and write group reports. Lectures and skills demonstrations were the main instruction methods. Assessment involved mainly continuous assessment, oral or written reports and summative examination.

Institutions of higher education provide a specific kind of services to their users, which makes these institutions a part of the public sector. Due to dynamic changes in the environment, the demands and needs of higher education institution's users change, which makes it necessary to monitor these changes through certain marketing activities and adjust to them in order to satisfy the users' needs. Each higher education institution sets its own goals which, broadly speaking, are to meet their own needs, the needs of students and the society as a whole. Therefore, when formulating a strategy for achieving the objectives of higher education institutions, it is necessary to have timely information from the environment. The modern approach to business puts forward the service users' needs. When it comes to institutions of higher education, the users are primarily students, who thus get the most attention. Keeping this in mind, we have conducted a research among students in order to identify the choice factors influencing their higher education institution selection process. The results obtained should provide guidelines for creating an adequate marketing mix in order to gain competitive advantage on the market for higher education. In the research descriptive and comparative methods were used. In the practical part of the research, survey technique was applied by means of a non-standardized questionnaire. The research results imply that the analysis of the factors influencing the process of selecting the higher education institution enables the creation of an adequate combination of instruments in a marketing mix which can then be used as an instrument for gaining competitive advantage.\n\nInstitutional trust, education, and corruption: a micro-macro interactive approach\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nHakhverdian, A.; Mayne, Q.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis article examines how the effect of education on institutional trust varies cross-nationally as a function of the pervasiveness of public-sector corruption.

The sample included 227 randomly selected directors of secondary and primary schools in the former Yugoslav republics: Serbia, Montenegro, and the Republic Srpska. The research included the use of an ALQ questionnaire for the estimation of leadership behavior. The components of authentic leadership are defined using factor analysis and other statistics techniques. The findings developed in this research indicated the fact that directors in educational institutions have a specific authentic leadership style. We suggest the concept of authentic leadership based on the four following factors: Communication-conformist, self-consciousness, self-discovery, and self-concept. Supporting these factors provides the directors with the possibility of obtaining a high level of authentic leadership.\n\nMechanisms of educational space organizationing higher educational institutions of Ukraine\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHmyrova A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn the article the problems of public administration of the educational process in higher educational institutions of Ukraine, its social, legal, and managerial aspects have been analysed.

They had been a very significant and unique educational-product of Turkey which were gifted to all secular [modern] world education systems. Because these Institutes were explored in line with thoroughly native considerations and foresights. Thus the Institutes punched their latterday principles and values not only in the Turkish, but also in many contemporary world education systems. Although the Institutes were shut down by some reactionary political approaches, their impacts, educational power and pedagogic wealth had reached until today. The main reason for that could be defined with various aspects. First of all, these institutions had adopted an unique educational model which was directly based on the universal science, culture and fine arts. This approach ensured authentic innovative styles for tudents of the Institutes, not only in the village field, but also in every educational level. Thus it should be emphasized that one of the most important aspects with this innovative education method was that the Village Institutes were conceived with a ârevolutionaryâ and âenlightenmentâ understanding. This noteworthy aspect was what made them unique at first.

The problems of higher educational institutions management are essential in conditions of growing competition between educational institutions. Their complexity and timeliness defines multifunctional activity of higher educational institutions, diversity of funding sources, the variety of forms and types of educational, scientific, industrial and economic activities, the need for monitoring of the market of educational services and the labor market (including the need for employment of graduates, the necessity for adaptation to continuously changing economic conditions.

V. Klyov\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The article draws attention to the nature and characteristics of cultureÂ­centric, process, institutional and organizational approaches to form the essence of the educational process as a whole. The author examines the university not only as an educational and scientific center, but also as a spiritual center, forming a new type of professional identity. It is noted that as a social phenomenon, process and social institution, education makes social changes in society, and the transparent nature of social processes, the dominance of market relations in turn affect the educational institute. However, the institutional approach makes it possible to consider the educational processes on social, and personal levels. It is observed that the institutionalization of higher education as a particular social institution within the entire social institution of education occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, which allowed to talk about the leading role of universities in modern culture. The author stresses that the theory of higher education is the widely recognized thesis that has multiple arguments. They are governed by national law based on national finance, train specialists for the national economy. In fact, the emergence of new forms of relationships is a positive social process, but there are also negative effects. Their premise, according to some researchers, was globalization, the effect of Â«market forcesÂ» that contribute to the development of Â«a world without bordersÂ».\n\nProfessional Education Management and Socio-Institutional Reality: problems and challenges\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEduardo Pinto e Silva\n\n2008-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The democratic management of educational practices is a theoretical and practical matter, which has been discussed in several institutional spheres (PARO, 2003; BORGES, GIUBILEI & OLIVEIRA, 2006. This paper deals with education management and is based on a case study about technical and professional education of agents of Municipal Guard (SILVA, 2005. This kind of education is affected by structural problems in the public institution (SANTOS, 1987 and in the macro judicial system (PINHEIRO, 1997, also being harmed by a process of social and work precariousness (ANTUNES, 1999; 2005. All these aspects represent challenges that have to be overcame. Thus, our propose of democratic professional education management (SILVA, 2005; HELOANI & SILVA, 2006 opposes the bureaucratic and alienating management. It demands listening to the collective subject and assuming a reflexive praxis about the professional activities and the socio-institutional reality. We consider that the challenge of creating a democratic professional management and a critical collective conscience, articulated with innovative actions, is part of a horizon of possibilities, even when it is mediated by institutional, organizational and cultural dimensions (SILVA JÃNIOR & FERRETTI, 2004.\n\nPrototype of Knowledge Management System for the Higher Education Institution in Indonesia\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nNuryasin, Ilyas; Prayudi, Yudi; Dirgahayu, Teduh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we propose a model of knowledge management for higher education institution in Indonesia.

Volchik\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Higher education reforms in Russia had been initiated in response to the challenge of time, such as new technologies development, optimization of government expenditures, commercialization of higher education and its âmassâ character. Currently implemented reforms rely upon the ideas of neo-liberal thinking, which is operationalized in the methods of regulation within the New Public Management approach. Institutional and organizational change in the higher education are the subject of research in Neo-institutional economics and Original Institutional economics. This paper deals primarily with the Original Institutionalist approach, with its focus on the institutional context of reforms: embedded working rules and social values, corporate culture and organizational specificities. For the recent decades, many Western countries have implemented, and are implementing nowadays, higher education reforms. Related change not only affects proportions of public and private expenditures on higher education, universitiesâ funding sources, but issues of academic freedom, social value of higher education and its role in the modern society as well. In terms of direction, higher education in Russia is convergent with the world-wide trends: integration into the global market of educational services and rethinking the role of the university as a business organization. However the paradox occurs that performance of the university under the ideas of New Public Management implies market or quasi-market environment. This environment should be much about decentralization of administrative hierarchies and growing autonomy of the universities. But in reality these processes are much about reduced academic freedom and tightened control over the universitiesâ performance through a system of the objectives and targets.\n\nPerceptions of African American Faculty in Kinesiology-Based Programs at Predominantly White American Institutions of Higher Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBurden, Joe W., Jr.; Harrison, Louis, Jr.; Hodge, Samuel R.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of African American faculty on their organizational socialization in kinesiology-based (i.e., sport pedagogy, exercise physiology, motor behavior, sport management/history) programs at predominantly White American (1) institutions of higher education (PW-IHE).

The study established that the public and municipal education institutions financed by estimate and budget, which is determined by the amount and directions of use funds for implementation of functions and achieving the goals. The estimate has 2 components: general and special fund. The paper describes the practice of using general and special funds of higher education institutions. The results present the features of financing public and private higher education institutions. Public higher education institutions acutely feel the lack of financial resources. Tuition fees at public higher education institutions are calculated according to the requirements of the budget legislation. The conclusions suggest the prospects of financing higher education institutions in Ukraine.

However, few studies exist that evaluate sustainable lifestyles among university students. The aim of this study was to analyze the mission and vision, processes and actions undertaken to promote sustainability in higher education institutions, and to compare the pro-sustainability orientation (PSO reported by 360 students coursing first or last semesters at college. The study was intended to evaluate the influence that four higher education institutions in Sonora, Mexico, have on studentsâ PSO. Results of the study indicate that a coherent PSO factor emerges from the interrelations among pro-environmental dispositional and behavioral variables reported by students. However, university programs and actions do not produce statistically significant differences between freshmen and senior students. Possible reasons explaining the lack of positive influence of those universities on studentsâ PSO are discussed.\n\nUsing of Marketing Communication for Distance Education Institutions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nR.

The training offered in the academy and the post academy Field Training Officer Program traditionally places little to no emphasis on critical thinking, professional self-regulation, communication skills or problem-based learning. In the last several years a new approach has been spawned. The Police Training Officer Program (PTO is an innovative form of education that focuses on problem based learning for post academy graduates. The PTO Program emphasizes adult education, problem solving, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution. This education is necessary to assist officers in de-escalation strategies within their communities and can lend to the reduction of civil disturbances. However, currently, relatively few agencies are offering this education to their post academy graduates and none are offering it to their academy recruits due, in part, to a lack of qualified instructors. PTO instructors must be proficient and fully trained in problem based learning techniques. Through Community Oriented Policing, law enforcement agencies can address this instructor shortage by partnering with university educational institutions to secure instructors who are competent in andragogy, critical thinking, and problem-based learning.\n\nImplementation of Inclusive Education in General Education Institutions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTat'yana A.

Number of European Union countries has already made drastic structural alterations, resulted in the abolition of special schools (Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Australia, USA, etc.. Children with different disabilities study in âthe least restrictive environmentâ, in other words, whenever possible, together with peers in the environment of general education institutions [1].The goal of Kazakhstan development strategy up to 2030, involving the educational system is âto provide the development of the national educational model and its integration into international educational environmentâ.The priority of state program âEducationâ (2000â2005 âis to create conditions for efficient development of national educational model, providing access to qualitative educationâ. âThe Concept of Kazakhstan Educational Systemâ, the realization of which should provide: transfer from the principle of âeducation for lifeâ to the principle of âlifelong education for everyoneâ; affordability and continuity of all educational levels; comprehensive, qualitative, competitive result-oriented education has been adopted\n\nEnergy efficiency interventions in UK higher education institutions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAltan, Hasim\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper provides an insight into energy efficiency interventions studies, focusing on issues arising in UK higher education institutions (HEIs) in particular. Based on a review of the context for energy efficiency and carbon reduction programmes in the UK and the trends in higher education sector, existing external and internal policies and initiatives and their relevant issues are extensively discussed. To explore the efficacy of some internal intervention strategies, such as technical, non-technical and management interventions, a survey was conducted among UK higher education institutions between February and April 2008. Consultation responses show that there are a relatively high percentage of institutions (83%) that have embarked on both technical and non-technical initiatives, which is a demonstration to the joined-up approach in such area. Major barriers for intervention studies are also identified, including lack of methodology, non-clarity of energy demand and consumption issues, difficulty in establishing assessment boundaries, problems with regards to indices and their effectiveness and so on. Besides establishing clear targets for carbon reductions within the sector, it is concluded that it is important to develop systems for effectively measuring and evaluating the impact of different policies, regulations and schemes in the future as the first step to explore. - Research Highlights: â The research provides an insight into energy efficiency interventions studies, focusing particularly on issues arising in UK higher education institutions (HEIs). â Based on a review of the context for energy efficiency and carbon reduction programmes in the UK and the trends in higher education sector, existing external and internal policies and initiatives, and their relevant issues are extensively discussed. â To explore the efficacy of some internal intervention strategies, such as technical, non-technical and management interventions, a survey was conducted\n\nAustralian Educational Institutions International Markets: A Correspondence Analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMazzarol, Timothy W.; Soutar, Geoffrey N.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPurpose: The global market for international students have become highly competitive and many institutions, particularly higher education institutions, rely heavily on fee income from overseas students.

The approaches to establishing the legal status of institutions of higher education in the current legislation of Ukraine are characterized. The impact of the legal status of higher education institution on its legal personality and the institutional autonomy has been determined. Views of scholars together with foreign experience of property titles in the imposition of property on higher education institution, were analyzed. Directions for the development of legal regulation of the system of public law legal entities in Ukraine have been defined. In order to ensure the development of the model of public administration in the sphere of higher education, it has been proposed that most of the higher education institutions should change the legal status of public legal entity â budgetary institution to the status of private legal entity â profitable or non-profitable higher education institution of the public / communal form of ownership, for which the founder would regularize property on the right of ownership. This will eliminate the conservatism, strict regulation on the part of the State, that is linked to the status of publicity, and, in order to develop the autonomy of higher education institution, will allow to take advantage of dispositivity inherent in private law entities in determining their legal personality.\n\nDevelopment of a Mechanical Engineering Test Item Bank to promote learning outcomes-based education in Japanese and Indonesian higher education institutions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJeffrey S. Cross\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Following on the 2008-2012 OECD Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes (AHELO feasibility study of civil engineering, in Japan a mechanical engineering learning outcomes assessment working group was established within the National Institute of Education Research (NIER, which became the Tuning National Center for Japan. The purpose of the project is to develop among engineering faculty members, common understandings of engineering learning outcomes, through the collaborative process of test item development, scoring, and sharing of results. By substantiating abstract level learning outcomes into concrete level learning outcomes that are attainable and assessable, and through measuring and comparing the studentsâ achievement of learning outcomes, it is anticipated that faculty members will be able to draw practical implications for educational improvement at the program and course levels. The development of a mechanical engineering test item bank began with test item development workshops, which led to a series of trial tests, and then to a large scale test implementation in 2016 of 348 first semester masterâs students in 9 institutions in Japan, using both multiple choice questions designed to measure the mastery of basic and engineering sciences, and a constructive response task designed to measure âhow well students can think like an engineer.â The same set of test items were translated from Japanese into to English and Indonesian, and used to measure achievement of learning outcomes at Indonesiaâs Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB on 37 rising fourth year undergraduate students. This paper highlights how learning outcomes assessment can effectively facilitate learning outcomes-based education, by documenting the experience of Japanese and Indonesian mechanical engineering faculty members engaged in the NIER Test Item Bank project.First published online: 30 November 2017\n\nMeasuring Institutional Performance in Higher Education.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeyerson, Joel W., Ed.; Massy, William F., Ed.\n\nThis collection of seven essays from the Stanford Forum for Higher Education Futures focuses on how downsizing, quality management, and reengineering have are affecting higher education.

Shiriaev\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper deals with the methodology for identification of institutions from institutional economics perspective. The differences between the perspectives provided by old and new institutional economics are highlighted. These differences are interpreted in the context of compared pragmatist and postpositivist methodologies. This paper applies to the post-positivist approach to the identification of institutions. One example of institution is provided by power-property institution. Identification of this institution in the historical and economic research is based on several theoretical generalizations and supported by array of historical facts. Another example is provided by identification of institution and institutional change in higher education based on discourse analysis and interviews with the main actors. In this paper, the regulatory institutions of higher education are analyzed as well. The concept of power-property institution is extended to the higher education by proposing hypotheses on the functioning of state governing-regulating institution in this sphere. This institution prescribes the actors to behave in accordance with the objectives of public policy, which can only be implemented in the form of bureaucratization of higher education. The paper describes the behavioral regularity generated by an identified institution. Functioning of the governing-regulating institution in higher education is illustrated by examples of behavioral regularities emerging from activities in accordance with this institution. The paper also shows the possibility of falsification of proposed hypothesis.\n\nDo generic strategies impact performance in higher educational institutions?

The researcher identified the need to develop a model for the mentoring of newly-appointed nurse educators in nursing education institutions in South Africa.Â To develop and describe the model for mentoring newly-appointed nurse educators in nursing education institutions in South Africa.Â A qualitative and theory-generating design was used (following empirical findings regarding needs analysis) in order to develop the model. The conceptualisation of the framework focused on the context, content, process and the theoretical domains that influenced the model. Ideas from different theories were borrowed from and integrated with the literature and deductive and inductive strategies were applied.Â The structure of the model is multidimensional and complex in nature (macro, mesoand micro) based on the philosophy of reflective practice, competency-based practice andcritical learning theories. The assumptions are in relation to stakeholders, context, mentoring, outcome, process and dynamic. The stakeholders are the mentor and mentee within an interactive participatory relationship. The mentoring takes place within the process with a sequence of activities such as relationship building, development, engagement, reflective process and assessment. Capacity building and empowerment are outcomes of mentoring driven by motivation.Â The implication for nurse managers is that the model can be used to develop mentoring programmes for newly-appointed nurse educators.\n\nCompetence, competency-based education, and undergraduate dental education: a discussion paper.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChuenjitwongsa, S; Oliver, R G; Bullock, A D\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe aim of undergraduate dental education is to provide competent dentists to serve societal needs and improve population oral healthcare. Competency-based education has influenced the development of dental education for decades but this term is problematic. This article explores components of competency-based undergraduate health professional education in order to help the dental profession have a better understanding of the context and purposes of undergraduate dental education. This is a discussion paper based on a wide reading of the literature on the education of health professionals with a specific focus on competency-based undergraduate education. Competence comprises an integration of knowledge, skills and attitudes indicating a capability to perform professional tasks safely and ethically. The process of becoming a competent practitioner is complex. Four characteristics of competency-based education are: curriculum components and content shaped by societal needs; focused on student-centred learning; learning achievement; and limited attention to time-based training and numerical targets. Alongside a competency-based approach, undergraduate dental education can be influenced by institutional features and external factors but these receive little consideration in the literature. Understanding competence, competency-based education, and institutional and external factors will help to improve educational quality, define roles and professional development for the dental educator, and inform further research.
