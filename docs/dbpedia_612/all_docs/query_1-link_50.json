        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn Online PhD is the highest possible degree professionals can obtain with all the benefits and convenience of online education.\n\nThe GRE is a standardized graduate program aptitude test that evaluates abstract thought in subjects including mathematics, writing, and reading comprehension.\n\nSeveral Online PhD programs have waived the GRE since its results have shown a minimal relationship to student performance and success and have only created disadvantages for marginalized groups.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGraduate programs are worthwhile in terms of degrees earned. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, those with PhD degrees earned a median weekly salary that was 20% greater than those with only a bachelorâs degree. Additionally, masterâs degree holders made much more moneyâover 18% more than those who finished their higher education after earning a bachelorâs degree.\n\nToday, earning a PhD is simpler than in the past because you can do so partially or totally online. You can also choose from a vast selection of top-notch online PhD degrees.\n\nFurthermore, several of these online PhDs have waived the GREâa test that measures reasoning skills and literacy, critical thinking, and math knowledge.\n\nLearn more with a look at our University Rankings Guide. You can also view a complete List of Online Programs.\n\nOtherwise, read on for a list of 50 top-tier schools as well as the PhD degree programs at each school that do not require a GRE.\n\nFeatured Programs\n\nWhy Earn an Online PhD?\n\nA PhD is a terminal degree, which means it is the highest degree you can obtain in the United States. A PhD is often an academic degree that emphasizes research, with the primary objective of developing sophisticated research abilities. The ability to generate new knowledge to impart to others in your field is crucial to obtaining a PhD.\n\nAs more organizations realize the value of having employees with highly specialized skills and knowledge in some industries, interest in PhDs has increased over the past ten years.\n\nItâs crucial to think about how getting an online PhD can boost your career if youâre thinking about returning to school for it. The majority of PhD holders will experience numerous important advantages, some of which are visible while others are not:\n\nOnline PhD Degree Holders Can Contribute Their Knowledge to Growing Industries\n\nMost people who have earned a PhD in any field have mastered essential research, writing, and analysis skills to an elite level. PhD degree holders have learned how to identify, analyze, articulate, and solve complex problems.\n\nWhatever your field, these skills are very valuable, and many top employers will hold them in great esteem.\n\nEarning an Online PhD Can Result in a Big Economic Payoff\n\nEarning a PhD through an online program will improve your chances of landing a high-paying job with your current employer. Today, many top leadership positions require a PhD.\n\nEarning an Online PhD Can Help to Build a Better Network of Professionals\n\nA wide range of professions and sectors will be represented among the students and instructors in your class. Almost all are there to further their professional development or help others do the same. This group of like-minded individuals can help you to develop a highly useful professional network.\n\nEarning an Online PhD Can Help to Qualify Graduates for Executive Level Positions\n\nPhD holders are regarded as professionals who hold some of their fieldâs highest distinctions. After graduating, you will be qualified to work as an upper-level administrator or executive in your industry and potentially earn a very high salary.\n\nOnline PhD Degree Holders Demonstrate High-Level Skills\n\nMost PhD degree holders have attained eminence-level proficiency in crucial research, writing, and analysis skills. You will also have mastered the skills of problem identification, problem analysis, problem articulation, and problem-solving to complete one of these demanding four to six-year programs.\n\nThese skills are extremely valuable in any field, and employers will highly value them.\n\nKey Point: Earning an online PhD is worth it because the degree can help to boost your career prospects, and command high-level positions (and corresponding high-level salaries) in top companies.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat is the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)?\n\nThe Graduate Record Examination, or GRE, is primarily used in the US and Canada to judge applicantsâ suitability for a graduate degree program. The test gauges a personâs capacity for abstract thought in analytical writing, mathematics, and language.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDo all schools require the GRE for admission into an online PhD degree program?\n\nWhile many schools still require the GRE as part of their admissions requirements into an online PhD degree program, many do not.\n\nSome schools may also offer a GRE exemption waiver if the prospective applicant meets other requirements.\n\nThese requirements typically include:\n\nHigh GPA scores during undergraduate and graduate studies (usually above 3.5)\n\nYears of professional work experience in the field of study or military experience\n\nBottom Line: Not all schools require the GRE. Some schools will also offer a GRE exemption waiver for students who qualify.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat should a prospective online PhD applicant know about the GRE?\n\nHistorically, GRE scores may have been overvalued by colleges and universities. These higher education institutions believed that a high score on the GRE was the best way to determine an applicantâs ability to perform well in a PhD program.\n\nHowever, an increasing number of universities no longer require the GRE as a criterion for application. According to a recent study, a high GRE score has shown a minimal association with the performance in graduate school. And further, that the test itself has resulted in poor scores for marginalized groups.\n\nHere are some reasons that the GRE requirement is slowly fading away:\n\nHigh GRE scores donât automatically mean better class performance\n\nScores themselves wonât determine a studentâs classroom performance. Students can ace entrance exams and still perform poorly. A studentâs classroom performance is influenced by various factors, including creativity, interpersonal abilities, and internal drive.\n\nThe GRE, however, doesnât evaluate any of those. It only concentrates on an applicantâs test-taking abilities. Passing the test does not ensure success in the classroom or career.\n\nGRE results decrease over time\n\nSome believe that a school may be able to predict a studentâs grades for the first year of the program based on the results of this test. Studentsâ grades, however, do not indicate whether they will succeed academically after that first year.\n\nThe GRE is unreliable in predicting results\n\nA GRE test score will not predict a studentâs ability to complete a program. Some high-achieving students might not have the perseverance to finish their education. On the other side, some students with poor scores might have been the ones who persisted the most.\n\nThe GRE could be âbiasedâ\n\nIt has been noted that the GRE is the best predictor of wealth and ethnicity. The GRE is perceived as a barrier because of the testâs inherent cultural biases, therefore, employing it in the decision-making process frequently hinders attempts for diversity and inclusion.\n\nKey Point: A high test score on the GRE is not only not a predictor of performance in an online PhD degree program, but it may even exclude students who would have had great success in their degree program.\n\nBack to Top\n\nShould you apply for an online PhD degree program that doesnât require GRE test scores?\n\nBefore deciding to enroll in an online PhD program that doesnât require the GRE, take the following into account:\n\nIt is possible to enroll in a PhD program that doesnât require a GRE. However, not passing the GRE will automatically exclude you from many elite institutions.\n\nNote that while some programs may not require you to submit your GRE score, if you take the test and do well, submitting your score may boost your chances of being accepted into an online PhD degree program.\n\nThink about why you have decided to apply for a program that does not require you to submit your GRE score:\n\nBecause youâve already chosen a course of study that exempts you from this test? Great!\n\nMostly as a result of your busy schedule? Consider carefully whether you have the time to enroll in a PhD program.\n\nBecause you got a low score? An ETS poll found that roughly 25% of test takers perform better on subsequent attempts.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow We Chose the 50 Best Schools for Earning an Online PhD with No GRE\n\nThe following colleges and universities are included in this ranking because they fit the following criteria:\n\nThe college or university has received regional accreditation and perhaps the school has also received programmatic accreditation in the specific discipline\n\nThe degree program is offered online or in a hybrid format that includes online courses with periodic short on-campus immersions.\n\nNo GRE is required to be admitted to the degree program, or\n\nA GRE waiver can be secured if a prospective student meets certain other requirements, typically a high GPA from a masterâs degree program or professional experience within the field\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe Best Online PhD Degree Programs That Do Not Require a GRE\n\n#1\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia , PA\n\nOther Rankings\n\n#10 50 Best Research Universities Ranked for Undergrads in 2024\n\n#11 50 Best Graduate Schools Ranked for Prospective Students in 2024\n\n#13 50 Best Private Colleges and Universities for Undergrads 2024\n\n#14 Best Universities in the World 2024\n\n#1 The Most Influential Universities and Colleges Ranked by State 2024\n\n#1 Best Research Universities in Pennsylvania 2024\n\n#1 Best Colleges in Pennsylvania 2024\n\n#1 Best Private Colleges in Pennsylvania 2024\n\n#1 Best Grad Schools in Pennsylvania 2024\n\n#1 Best Research Universities for Business Degrees\n\n#1 Best Research Universities for Social Work Degrees\n\n#1 Best Research Universities for Nursing Degrees\n\n#2 Best Research Universities for Communications Degrees\n\n#4 Best Research Universities for Psychology Degrees\n\n#7 Best Research Universities for Anthropology Degrees\n\n#7 Best Research Universities for Biology Degrees\n\n#8 Best Research Universities for History Degrees\n\n#8 Best Research Universities for Engineering Degrees\n\n#9 Best Research Universities for Sociology Degrees\n\n#9 Best Research Universities for Chemistry Degrees\n\n#9 Best Research Universities for Economics Degrees\n\n#10 Best Research Universities for Political Science Degrees\n\n#11 Best Research Universities for English Degrees\n\n#11 Best Research Universities for Religious Studies Degrees\n\n#11 Best Research Universities for Physics Degrees\n\n#12 Best Research Universities for Computer Science Degrees\n\n#12 Best Research Universities for Math Degrees\n\n#14 Best Research Universities for Philosophy Degrees\n\n#15 Best Research Universities for Earth Sciences Degrees\n\n#1 Most Affordable Online Criminology Doctorate Programs (PhDs)\n\n#2 Best Online PhD of Computer Science Degree Programs (Doctorates) 2024\n\n#3 Guide to Free Online Courses for MBA Students in 2024\n\n#3 Fastest Accelerated Online Computer Science Doctorates (PhDs)\n\n#3 Most Affordable Online Computer Science PhDs (Doctorates) 2024\n\n#7 Top 15 Most Affordable Online Social Work PhDs (Doctorates)\n\n#6 Top 20 Best Business Schools for MBAs Ranked for Students\n\n#9 The Best Traditional MBA Programs Ranked for Students in 2024\n\n#10 Best Schools in the World for Earning an MBA Degree Ranked for 2024\n\n#10 The Fastest Traditional MBA Degree Programs Ranked for 2024\n\nTuition + fees\n\n$63K\n\nAcceptance\n\n7%\n\nGraduation\n\n96%\n\nStudent body\n\n33K\n\nMedian SAT/ACT\n\n1535/34\n\nCareer Outlook for degree at University of Pennsylvania\n\nCost of Degree: $44,162\n\nExpenses: $22,286\n\nStarting Salary: $131,600\n\nCost Recoup Time: 10 years\n\nPaid back at 15% of annual salary\n\nWhat is University of Pennsylvania known for?\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvaniaâs faculty and alumni have been influential in:\n\nBusiness\n\nSocial Work\n\nNursing\n\nMedical\n\nCommunications\n\nEngineering\n\nAnthropology\n\nPsychology\n\nSociology\n\nEducation\n\nMost Influential Alumni\n\nNoam Chomsky\n\nEzra Pound\n\nHilary Putnam\n\nMartin Seligman\n\nJames McKeen Cattell\n\nJohn Backus\n\nLawrence Lessig\n\nEric S.
