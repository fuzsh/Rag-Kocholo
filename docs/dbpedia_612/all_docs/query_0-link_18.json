        "text": "This maiden Alumni Lecture of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti is a traverse of the status of education, university education, educational development in Nigeria in relation to the objects of national development and university system. It is obvious that the deficiencies in University education and its challenges in meeting goals of National Development require cooperative and collaborative efforts. That positive effort in modern times would begin with the role played by the major stakeholders like the Alumni towards sustaining the institutions. As long as any graduate of this institution wish to refer to the certificate issued to him or her by the University either as an evidence of higher education, scholarship or for the purpose of earning a living or building foundation for public recognition and contributions to the development of the society, every intending and successful graduates of this University must see the Alumni Association as the best avenue of coming together to advance those causes that would stand the test of time.\n\nThe subject of this paper is the place of leadership in redefining the role of the university in Africa in general and Uganda in particular. The ‘African University’ today, like any other university, has clear mandates and roles; research, teaching and community service, clearly laid down on paper in many of the universities’ manuals and strategic plans. But, in reality, these roles are not performed at all or are performed in a manner that may not warrant clear roles. Increasingly, it is observed that less quality teaching, less research, and less community service are being done. This situation calls for rethinking what role should universities play. While many expla- nations have been offered for the declining performance of the university, in this paper I contend that leadership plays a significant role not only in influencing escalation of crises but also in averting them, especially in Ugandan universities. The paper answers mainly three research questions: (i) How do changes ...\n\nThe subject of this paper is the place of leadership in redefining the role of the university in Africa in general and Uganda in particular.

Descriptive research design was adopted to guide the study and a sample size of 120 was used to respond to questionnaire and interview guide. The study revealed that UCC alumni members in the Greater Accra Region were generally not aware of the activities of their Alumni Association. Also, only a handful of them seemed to be conversant with such activities. Generally, UCC Alumni in the Greater Accra Region value their experiences with their alma matter positively and were willing to contribute towards rejuvenating their alumni association.\n\nThis article seeks to provide guidelines for leadership decisions and prac- tices that university deans can follow to be effective in their institutions and be relevant in an increasingly competitive African milieu. The paper provides an overview of academic leadership by faculty deans and assesses the degree to which they demonstrate leadership in addressing contempo- rary challenges and expectations. The paper shows how academic leaders must hold and convey ideas and knowledge that could shape managerial thought and practice. It also emphasizes that they must develop a human resource network inside and outside their departments and university and at levels – be they local, national, and international. Academic leadership needs to have a structured approach to faculty and staff promotion and development, and it should be placed on a priority list. Deans need to use technology and communication channels effectively to improve access to knowledge. The educational programmes must be d...\n\nUniversity education is a critical level of education that is saddled with the responsibility of providing the much needed skilled manpower for any society. University administrators are the engine room of universities they form the vital workforce within these institutions and are made up of human resources who utilize material and financial resources to accomplish set academic goals. In order to ensure effective academic leadership in these universities, it is important to determine the conditions under which university administrators currently operate and measures that can be adopted to improve their standard of operation in federal and state universities in South-South Nigeria. This paper was designed to clarify these issues on university administration in South-South Nigeria and its effect on academic leadership. The study population consisted of lecturers in 11 federal and state universities in South-South Nigeria, from which a total of 880 respondents were sampled.

Achola, Ph.D and Eric Masinde Aseka, Ph.D Kenyatta University Introduction The theme or title of this conference allows for a wide latitude of interpretations as to the intended objectives. But, perhaps, a common purpose seems to run through, namely that leadership and governance of higher education in the countries of the continent require overhaul to achieve the desired goals of higher education. Opinion is bound to differ about what aspects of higher education leadership and management need transforming and this is perhaps why the convenors of this conference identified a variety of themes for exposition. Yet the imperfections in African higher education leadership and management that the conference theme implies will require both time and patient boldness to resolve; and any solution proposed may be unnerving, especiallv to some of those with vested interests in ..."
