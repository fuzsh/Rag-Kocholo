This results in less sustainable and efficient policies and in social and economic injustices. Global decision makers must take into account the needs of local communities. They should work to identify all voices from different regions, but also from different economic strata, and other minorities that are impacted and make sure that they offer them a seat at the table, to ensure that they include a wider range of views when designing, developing, and deploying policies and systems, and therefore and limit cases of unrepresented communities. Quote by Shmyla Khan, who previously served as Director of Research and Policy for Digital Rights Foundation, a research based advocacy organisation that focuses on information, communication and technologies to support Human Rights, democracy and digital governance. Shmyla participated in this year's GPAI follow up consultation about #datajustice which aimed to collect impacted communities' perspectives and to create this awareness campaign. #PeopleNeedDataJustice #IA #IAresponsable #AI #ResponsibleAI #CollectedeDonnées #GestiondesDonnées #StockageDesDonnées #Data #DataCollection #DataManagement #DataStorage #AIforPublicGood #AIforGood #AI4Good #IAPourleBienCommun #IAEquitable #EquitableAI #FairAI Public Policy Programme || The Alan Turing Institute, The Alan Turing Institute, Alison Gillwald, Jeni Tennison, Maja Bogataj Jancic, Mike O'Sullivan, AfroLeadership, María Paz Hermosilla GobLab UAI, Digital Empowerment Foundation, Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), Instituto de Tecnologia e Sociedade (ITS Rio), Digital Natives Academy, CIPIT, Cristian Leon Coronado Fundación InternetBolivia.org, Digital Rights Foundation, NYAPENDI ESTHER Women Of Uganda Network\n\n𝐀 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐮𝐦 𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐧 𝐀𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚 The first High-Level Forum on AI in Africa was held in June at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Morocco. The forum’s theme was “AI as a Lever for Development in Africa.” This event led to the establishment of the AI Movement as a UNESCO Category 2 Centre and a tripartite agreement was signed between UNESCO, the Moroccan Government, and the AI Movement. The forum’s participants included judges, parliamentarians, government officials, private sector representatives, civil society members, and artists. The discussions focused on AI strategies, policies, opportunities, and risks in Africa. Also, the African Consensus on AI: A Call to Action was adopted, with principles of inclusive AI governance, AI for public good, and ethical AI development. The key recommendations included prioritizing AI infrastructure, preventing brain drain, and expanding African language datasets. In addition, they aim to foster partnerships and international cooperation, promote innovation, enhance digital literacy, and build stakeholder capacity. UNESCO and the AI Movement intend to train 5,000 African civil servants in AI and digital transformation over the next three years.

This workshop, presented by Mr Keagetswe Alex Kgotlatsile, Education lead WGYD (women gender and youth directorate), AU, gave exposure to first, what the African Union was, when it was launched, and finally what the agenda 2063 is. The African Union (AU), a union comprising 55 member states of the African Continent, was launched for the main purpose of providing an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa and representing a dynamic force in the global arena. Regarding \"Agenda 2063\", it is Africa’s development blueprint, developed by the AU to achieve inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic growth over 50 years. It is mainly comprised of five (5) 10-year implementation plans starting from the year 2013. Furthermore, there is a strong link between Agenda 2063 and the UN 2030 sustainable development goals. Overall, it was a truly insightful session that shed light on several areas that Africa could invest in for inclusive and sustainable growth. Furthermore, it also highlighted the importance of youth in driving the necessary force needed for these development goals. A huge thanks to our speaker, Mr Alex, and AIIDEV Africa for organizing this wonderful and inspiring session. #Africa#AIIDEVAfrica#Agenda2063#SDGs#SustainableDevelopment"
