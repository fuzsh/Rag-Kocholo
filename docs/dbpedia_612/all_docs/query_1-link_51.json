Names of the nominees for the 2016 competition who submitted their applications appear in the list below. We applaud these students for sharing their science and engineering projects on the national scale. Each entrant will receive a t-shirt and bumper sticker. From this list, 300 semifinalists will be named on September 6th, and 30 finalists will be named on September 20th. All entries are currently under evaluation."
