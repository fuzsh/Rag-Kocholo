I am a 'Generalist' at the Putnam Clubhouse in Concord, CA, serving people with severe autism and schizophrenia. I hope to pursue my master's and one day start my own 'Garden Therapy.'\"\n\nDevelopment & Volunteer Coordinator\n\nHorton's Kids DC\n\n“The HSSJ program has given me the skills and knowledge that will set me up for success. Thanks to the internship I had I gained skills in nonprofit fundraising, which was a large part of why I was offered this job.”\n\n\"The Human Services program has definitely influenced my career path. I learned how to work in a group setting, use my coursework to solve real-world problems and complete important tasks for the nonprofits and government agencies that I now work and volunteer with, including applying for grants, managing volunteers and marketing social programs.\"\n\nPeter Sacco\n\nBA '15\n\nExecutive Director, Advisory Neighborhood Commission’s 2A"
