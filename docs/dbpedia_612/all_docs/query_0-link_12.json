Photo taken on March 24, 2001.\n\n3.1.3 A Child Soldier’s Story\n\nI’m Philip Emeagwali,\n\na child soldier\n\non the Biafran side\n\nof the Nigeria Biafra War,\n\na war that raged\n\nduring the last 30 months\n\nof the 1960s,\n\na war that was described as\n\nAfrica’s bloodiest war,\n\nand a war\n\nin which one in fifteen Biafrans died.\n\nMy twenty-year long journey\n\nbegan at a war front\n\nin July 1969\n\nand ended at the frontier of knowledge.\n\nThe turning point in my journey\n\nto the frontier\n\nof the most massively\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\noccurred twenty years\n\nbefore my experimental discovery\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat, in turn, occurred\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico,\n\nUnited States.\n\nIn July 1969, I was conscripted\n\nas a 14-year-old soldier\n\nand sent to the Oguta War Front,\n\nIgbo Land, Biafra, West Africa.\n\nI was the youngest soldier there.\n\nThat war\n\nturned my ancestral homeland\n\ninto Africa’s bloodiest battlefield.\n\nI arrived at the Oguta War Front\n\na few days after\n\n500 Biafran soldiers\n\nfell dead on the ground.\n\nFive hundred soldiers fell\n\nas if they were dry leaves.\n\nI was conscripted\n\nto replace\n\none of these 500 men.\n\nAt the Oguta War Front of Biafra,\n\nthey were more guns\n\nthan pens.\n\nThat 30-month-long war\n\nended on July 15, 1970\n\nwith the defeat of Biafra.\n\n3.1.4 Chronicles From Biafran Refugee Camps\n\nA twelve-year old\n\nwriting her school report\n\nasked for a little known fact\n\nabout Philip Emeagwali.\n\nI asked her:\n\nWhat else does Philip Emeagwali\n\nhave in common\n\nwith the German-born\n\ntheoretical physicist Albert Einstein\n\nor with the South Sudanese-born\n\nsupermodel Alek Wek\n\nor with the South African-born\n\nsinger Miriam Makeba\n\nor with the South African-born\n\nnovelist Nadine Gordimer\n\nor with the Haitian-born\n\nformer Governor General of Canada\n\nMichaëlle Jean?\n\nThe answer is that we were all\n\nformer refugees\n\nwho were featured in a school poster.\n\nThat school poster was titled:\n\n“Refugees You May Know.”\n\nBecause of that refugee poster\n\nI received letters from Somali refugees\n\nin Kenya, from refugees\n\nfrom the Democratic Republic of Congo, from refugees in Ethiopia,\n\nfrom refugees in Burundi, Rwanda,\n\nand Liberia.\n\nThat refugee poster\n\nwas produced and distributed\n\nby the United Nations.\n\nAccording to the United Nations,\n\n65 million persecuted people\n\nwere forced to flee from their homes\n\nand forced to flee from civil wars\n\nand forced to flee from areas\n\nthat were afflicted\n\nwith severe food shortages.\n\nFor three years of the late 1960s,\n\nI was a refugee in Biafra\n\nwho mostly lived in classrooms\n\nthat were converted into living rooms.\n\nFor three years,\n\nall schools in Biafra\n\nwere closed and converted into makeshift, overcrowded housing,\n\nand feeding centers\n\nfor millions upon millions\n\nof Biafran refugees.\n\n3.1.5 One Day We Had to Run!\n\nIn early 1968, Russian MiG 17s\n\n—the same high-subsonic fighter aircrafts\n\nthat were heavily used in Vietnam—\n\nand Russian Ilyushin 28s bombers\n\npaid us regular visits\n\nin Onitsha (Biafra).\n\nFrom the Inland Town quarters,\n\nEnu Onicha, of Onitsha\n\nand on Wednesday March 20, 1968\n\nwe saw Biafran soldiers\n\nfleeing on foot from Abagana War Front.\n\nAbagana was a five-hour walk\n\nfrom our residence.\n\nIt was from fleeing Biafran soldiers\n\nthat we learned that\n\nmy ancestral hometown of Onitsha (Nigeria)\n\nwould be captured in six hours.\n\nWe knew the Nigerian army\n\ndid not take prisoners.\n\nWe had learned from the “Dance of Death”\n\nof October 7, 1967 in Asaba (Nigeria)\n\nthat 700 unarmed civilian men\n\nwere murdered.\n\nSo we knew to flee immediately.\n\nWe fled from 14 Mba Road, Umudei Village, Onitsha (Biafra),\n\nthe residence of my uncle John Emeagwali,\n\nto Merchants of Light School, Oba (Biafra).\n\nThat flight from Onitsha\n\nwas the last time\n\nI saw John Emeagwali’s residence\n\nthat was at 14 Mba Road, Onitsha.\n\nThat residence\n\nthat was built six years earlier\n\nwas ground zeroed\n\nby either a bomb or a rocket or a cannon\n\nfired by the Nigerian Army.\n\nPlease allow me to quote\n\nfrom another eyewitness account\n\nwhat happened in Onitsha (Biafra)\n\non the night we fled.\n\nThis eyewitness account was titled:\n\n“Nightmare in Biafra.”\n\nThis eyewitness account\n\nof the night of March 20, 1968\n\nthat we fled Onitsha (Biafra)\n\nappeared in the “Sunday Times”\n\nof London [England]\n\non page 12 April 26, 1968.\n\n[And I quote]\n\n“I have seen things in Biafra this week\n\nwhich no man should have to see.\n\nSights to search the heart\n\nand sicken the conscience.\n\nI have seen children roasted alive,\n\nyoung girls torn in two by shrapnel,\n\npregnant women eviscerated,\n\nand old men blown to fragments.\n\nI have seen these things\n\nand I have seen their cause:\n\nhigh-flying Russian Ilyushin jets\n\noperated by Federal Nigeria,\n\ndropping their bombs\n\non civilian centres throughout Biafra.\n\n[End of quote]\n\nThe war correspondent\n\nwho wrote the article\n\n“Nightmare in Biafra”\n\ncontinued:\n\n[And I quote]\n\n“At Onitsha,\n\nunder siege from the federal troops,\n\nthe three-hundred-strong congregation\n\nof the Apostolic Church\n\ndecided to stay on\n\nwhile others fled\n\nand to pray for deliverance.\n\nCol. Mohammed’s Second Division\n\nfound them in the church,\n\ndragged them out,\n\ntied their hands behind their backs\n\nand executed them.”\n\n[End of quote]\n\n3.2 How I Invented a New Supercomputer\n\n3.2.1 Philip Emeagwali Origin Story\n\nMy ancestral origin\n\nis from the Igbo-speaking people\n\nof southeastern region of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to an Igbo proverb:\n\n[quote]\n\n“A new fowl, in a new land,\n\nlooks at the old fowls\n\nto learn how to crow\n\nin their new language.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—was the new fowl\n\nin the then unknown land\n\nof the modern supercomputer.\n\nI was the new fowl\n\nin massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputing\n\nwho did not look at the old fowls\n\nin vector processing supercomputing.\n\nI did not learn from the old fowls\n\nhow to invent\n\na never-before-seen internet\n\nthat is a new supercomputer de facto\n\nbut that is not a computer per se.\n\n3.2.2 My Quest for the Fastest Supercomputer\n\nParallel processing was scorned\n\nas a beautiful theory\n\nthat lacked experimental confirmation.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nwhen I was only nineteen years old.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nat 1800 SW Campus Way,\n\nCorvallis, Oregon, United States.\n\nWhen I began supercomputing,\n\nI was new in the United States,\n\nhaving arrived on March 24, 1974\n\nafter receiving a scholarship letter\n\nthat was dated September 10, 1973.\n\n3.2.3 Who Is It that Can Tell Me Who I Am?\n\nWho is it\n\nthat can tell me\n\nwho I am?\n\nI am Philip Emeagwali,\n\nborn on August 23, 1954\n\nin Akure, to Igbo parents\n\nwho were living in the heart of Yoruba Land.\n\nI was born\n\nin the then British West African colony\n\nof Nigeria.\n\nIn a sense, my story began\n\nin the faraway United States\n\nseven years before I was born\n\nin the August 25, 1947 issue\n\nof The New York Times\n\nthat carried an article titled:\n\n“New Giant ‘Brain’ Does Wizard Work.”\n\nThat New York Times article explained that:\n\n[And I quote]\n\n“…the machines under construction\n\nwill have a ‘built-in intelligence’\n\nwhich will enable them to handle\n\nthe most complicated differential equations\n\nof physics and engineering,\n\nperforming hundreds of\n\nseparate mathematical operations\n\nwithout the intervention\n\nof a human operator…”\n\n[unquote]\n\nForty-three years\n\nafter that big question\n\nwas posed in The New York Times,\n\nI solved the problem\n\nthat was listed\n\nby the United States government\n\nas one of the twenty grand challenges\n\nin supercomputing.\n\nFor that breakthrough,\n\nI was in major U.S. newspapers,\n\nsuch as in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal.\n\nI was in the news because\n\nmy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat occurred on the Fourth of July 1989\n\nwas an invention\n\nof a new supercomputer\n\nwith ‘built-in intelligence,’\n\nthat solves the toughest\n\npartial differential equations\n\narising in physics,\n\nor in extreme-scale\n\ncomputational fluid dynamics.\n\nThe poster boy\n\nof these grand challenge problems\n\nis the general circulation model\n\nthat must be used to foresee\n\notherwise unforeseeable climate changes.\n\nI was in the news because\n\nof my invention\n\nof how to send and receive\n\n64 binary thousand email messages\n\nand how to do so across\n\nmy ensemble of 65,536\n\ntightly-coupled processors.\n\nI was in the news because\n\nof my invention\n\nof how to perform the world’s fastest supercomputer calculations\n\never recorded\n\nand how to always record\n\na world record speed in supercomputing\n\nand how to do so across\n\na new global network of processors\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nand a new supercomputer\n\nand a new computer.\n\nA discovery or an invention\n\nis like the moon.\n\nIt has two parts:\n\nthe visible part and the hidden part.\n\nFor that reason, I am well known\n\nbut I am not known well.\n\n3.3 From Soldier to Scientist\n\n3.3.1 My Discovery of the Fastest Supercomputer\n\nA 12-year-old asked me:\n\n“I’m doing a school report\n\non the development of the computer.\n\nWhy are you called\n\nthe father\n\nof the modern computer\n\nthat solves many problems at once?”\n\nI answered:\n\n“The computer\n\nhas many fathers and mothers,\n\nuncles and aunts.\n\nBut I am the only father\n\nof the computer\n\nwho was profiled\n\nin major U.S. newspapers\n\nand who was credited\n\nfor the invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer.”\n\nI was in major U.S. newspapers\n\nbecause I made the first\n\nexperimental measurement\n\nof the world’s fastest computation\n\never recorded across\n\nan ensemble of the slowest processors\n\nin the world.\n\n3.3.2 Why I Was in the Newspapers\n\nThe reason my invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas written about in major U.S. newspapers\n\nwas that it opened the door\n\nfor speeding up 30,000 years\n\nof time-to-solution\n\non one computer\n\nthat computed\n\nwith only one processor\n\nto just one day of time-to-solution\n\non one supercomputer\n\nthat simultaneously computed across\n\na tightly-coupled\n\nensemble of ten million processors.\n\nAt its core primordial essence,\n\nmy quest\n\nfor a never-before-seen supercomputer\n\naimed to change the way\n\nwe solve the toughest problems\n\narising in calculus and algebra\n\nand to change that way\n\nfrom solving the toughest problems\n\non only one computer\n\npowered by only one processor\n\nthat is not a member\n\nof an ensemble of processors\n\nto solving the toughest problems\n\nacross millions upon millions\n\nof tightly-coupled\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat shared nothing between each other.\n\n3.4 Who Is It that Can Tell Me I’m Mad\n\n3.4.1 My Struggles to Invent the Supercomputer\n\nAsking a person to become\n\nthe first programmer\n\nof the first massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas like asking a man\n\nwho had never climbed a mountain\n\nto climb Mount Everest.\n\nBecause it was considered impossible,\n\nback in the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nto program the first\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nnobody took me seriously\n\nin my solo attempt\n\nto climb the Mount Everest\n\nof the world of supercomputers.\n\nIn my fifteen years of supercomputing,\n\nonward of June 20, 1974,\n\nI made mistakes\n\nbut I was open\n\nto quick course corrections.\n\nThose corrections\n\ntook me to the unknown world\n\nof massively parallel processing across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a small copy\n\nof the global internet\n\nthat encircles the Earth.\n\nMy new internet\n\nis a new global network of\n\n64 binary thousand\n\ntightly-coupled processors.\n\nEach processor\n\nhas its own operating system.\n\nEach processor\n\nhas its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shares nothing with each other.\n\n3.4.2 Before and After My Discovery\n\nBefore my invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nthat occurred\n\non the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe word “supercomputer”\n\nreferred to a supercomputing machinery\n\nthat is powered by only one\n\ncentral processing unit.\n\nAfter my invention,\n\nthe word “supercomputer”\n\nreferred to a supercomputing machinery\n\nthat is powered by up to\n\nten binary million\n\ncentral processing units.\n\n3.4.3 Philip Emeagwali Invention\n\nI am the first person to discover\n\nthe fastest computations across\n\nthe slowest processors.\n\nSince my 1989 invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer,\n\nI felt like the ancient mariner\n\nwho travelled around the world\n\nto tell his story and give lectures\n\nto different people.\n\nMy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nenabled me to compress\n\n180 years of time-to-solution\n\non only one processor\n\nand to compress that time\n\nto just one day of time-to-solution\n\nacross my new internet\n\nthat is my new global network of\n\n64 binary thousand\n\nprocessors\n\nthat computed in parallel.\n\nI invented\n\nhow to solve\n\ngrand challenge problems\n\narising in supercomputing\n\nand how to solve them in real-time,\n\ninstead of taking a life time\n\nto solve them.\n\nI invented\n\nthe fastest massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat an oil company can use\n\nto reduce its time-to-market,\n\nsuch as the time between the discovery of crude oil and natural gas\n\nin the Niger Delta Region\n\nof southeastern Nigeria\n\nand the recovery of that crude oil\n\nand natural gas.\n\n3.4.4 I Was Dismissed From Research Teams\n\nFor the sixteen years,\n\nonward of age 19 and of June 20, 1974,\n\nI conducted my supercomputer research\n\nalone.\n\nI did so alone\n\nbecause I was ridiculed, mocked,\n\nand rejected\n\nby all-white research teams\n\nthat were exclusively programming\n\nonly sequential and vector processing supercomputers.\n\nThat rejection\n\nforced me to forge a different path\n\nto the modern supercomputer\n\nthat solves many problems at once.\n\nThat rejection\n\nforced me to think individually\n\non how to harness the power of\n\nthe massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nand how to invent\n\nthe technology\n\nand know it, for the first time,\n\nas the engine that drives\n\nthe modern supercomputer.\n\n3.5 At First, My Invention Was Rejected\n\n3.5.1 The Grand Challenge Question\n\nIn the 1980s and earlier,\n\nthe big question\n\nin the world of the supercomputer\n\nwas:\n\n“Can an ensemble\n\nof the slowest processors\n\noutperform the fastest supercomputer\n\nand change the way\n\nwe look at the modern computer?”\n\nIn 1989,\n\nthere were 25,000 users\n\nof vector processing supercomputers.\n\nI was the only full-time programmer\n\nof the handful of\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputers\n\nof the 1980s.\n\nGene Amdahl and Seymour Cray,\n\nthe two leading opponents\n\nof the parallel processing supercomputer,\n\nargued that it will forever\n\nremain impossible\n\nto parallel process through as many as\n\neight processors or computer cores.\n\nThe reason my invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nmade the news headlines\n\nand was highlighted\n\nin the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof The Wall Street Journal\n\nwas that the parallel processing supercomputer technology of today\n\nwas then dismissed and abandoned\n\nby the leaders of thought\n\nin supercomputing—namely,\n\nGene Amdahl and Seymour Cray—\n\nand was then rejected\n\nby their 25,000 followers,\n\neach a vector processing\n\nsupercomputer scientist.\n\nThose 25,000 supercomputer scientists\n\nscorned, ridiculed, and dismissed\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nas a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties [1980s],\n\nI was dismissed\n\nfrom my research teams\n\nand dismissed\n\nfor advocating\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer.\n\n3.5.2 A New Way of Looking at the Computer\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthat the conventional wisdom\n\ndescribed in supercomputer textbooks\n\nas Amdahl’s Law was wrong.\n\nI invented\n\na new way of looking at the computer\n\nand solving the toughest problems\n\narising in physics.\n\nIn the old way of solving\n\nthe most computation-intensive problems\n\nin extreme-scale computational physics\n\nand before my invention\n\nthat occurred\n\non the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe most extreme-scaled\n\nalgebraic computations\n\narising in physics\n\nwere solved across\n\na singular, customized,\n\nand ultra-expensive vector processor\n\nthat processed\n\nonly one thing, or a string of numbers\n\ncalled vectors, at a time.\n\nThat vector processing supercomputer\n\nwas the fastest supercomputer\n\nduring the decades of the 1970s and ‘80s.\n\nBut in my new way,\n\nthat is, the new\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer,\n\nthat I mathematically and experimentally invented\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nI figured out\n\nhow to solve, in parallel,\n\nthe most extreme-scale problems\n\nthat has algebra, calculus, and physics\n\nat their foundations\n\nand as their common denominators.\n\nAnd I invented that technology\n\nby parallel processing\n\nthose grand challenge problems across\n\nmy ensemble of 65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat shared nothing between each other\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\ntwo-raised-to-power sixteen\n\ncommodity processors.\n\n3.5.3 The Impossible is Possible, Sometimes\n\nIn high-performance supercomputing,\n\nwizardry\n\nis making the impossible-to-compute\n\npossible-to-compute.\n\nThe June 14, 1976 issue\n\nof the Computer World\n\ncarried an article that was titled:\n\n[quote]\n\n“Research in Parallel Processing Questioned as ‘Waste of Time’.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe day I invented\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer,\n\nthe 25,000 vector processing supercomputer scientists in the world that were led by Seymour Cray\n\nbelieved that\n\nparallel processing will forever remain\n\na huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\n3.5.4 Chickens Versus Oxen Debate\n\nPerhaps, it is only at a very visceral level\n\nthat you will recognize the father\n\nof the modern supercomputer\n\nthat computes in parallel across\n\nsixty-five thousand processors\n\nor across sixty-five million processors.\n\nBack in 1989,\n\n25,000 supercomputer programmers\n\nabandoned the pre-cursors\n\nof the modern\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat computes across processors,\n\nor across tiny computers.\n\nThe leader in the world of\n\nthe vector processing supercomputer,\n\nSeymour Cray,\n\nwas the strongest opponent\n\nof the modern, massively parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nTo date, the brainiest quote of Seymour Cray is this:\n\n“If you were plowing a field,\n\nwhich would you rather use?\n\nTwo strong oxen\n\nor 1,024 chickens?”\n\nSeymour Cray would rather compute\n\nwith two strong oxen\n\nfor the two fastest, most expensive,\n\nand customized processors\n\nin the world.\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—would rather compute\n\nwith 1,024 chickens\n\nfor the 1,024 slowest, least expensive,\n\nand commodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nin the world.\n\nAs was widely reported\n\n—including in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal,\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nexperimentally discovered\n\nthat 65,536 chickens\n\nare more powerful than two strong oxen.\n\n3.5.5 I Was Devoured Like a Lamb\n\nMy scientific truth was controversial\n\nin the 1970s and ‘80s.\n\nIn those two decades, I was banished\n\nfrom the community of\n\n25,000 vector processing\n\nsupercomputer scientists.\n\nI was forced to parallel program abandoned massively parallel processing supercomputers\n\nas a lone wolf.\n\nAs the first black person\n\nto win the top prize in supercomputing\n\nand as the only person to win that prize alone,\n\nI was devoured like a lamb\n\nand my garments\n\nwere soiled in mockery.\n\n3.5.6 Steve Jobs Scorned Parallel Processing\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nmocked parallel processing\n\nas a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nIn the June 10, 2008 issue\n\nof the New York Times,\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nwas quoted as telling\n\nApple’s Worldwide Developers\n\nthat [And I quote, Steve Jobs]:\n\n“The way the processor industry\n\nis going\n\nis to add more and more cores,\n\nbut nobody knows\n\nhow to program\n\nthose things,”\n\nSteve Jobs continued:\n\n“I mean, two, yeah;\n\nfour, not really;\n\neight, forget it.”\n\n[End of quote]\n\n3.5.7 Changing the Way We Look at the Computer\n\nPhilip Emeagwali\n\nis the subject of school reports because\n\nmy contributions\n\nchanged the way we look at\n\nthe supercomputer.\n\nIn the old way\n\nand before my invention,\n\nwe thought of the supercomputer\n\nas doing only one thing\n\nat a time,\n\nand doing that thing\n\nwith only one vector processor.\n\nIn my new way\n\nand after my invention,\n\nwe think of the supercomputer\n\nas doing many things\n\nat once,\n\nand doing those things\n\nwith millions upon millions\n\nof processors.\n\nThat is, I experimentally discovered\n\nhow and why\n\nthe modern supercomputer\n\nmust compute in parallel\n\nin order to simultaneously solve\n\nmillions upon millions\n\nof the most grand challenging problems\n\narising in physics and mathematics,\n\ninstead of solving\n\nonly one grand challenge problem\n\nat a time.\n\nAfter my invention,\n\nthe number of parallel processing supercomputers exploded.\n\nBefore my invention,\n\nparallel processing was scorned, ridiculed, and rejected\n\nas a beautiful theory\n\nthat lacked an\n\nexperimental confirmation.\n\nTo discover or invent\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis to make the impossible-to-compute possible-to-compute.\n\n3.5.8 The Fastest Supercomputer\n\nI was the first\n\nmassively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer scientist\n\nto record the fastest speed.\n\nTo record the fastest recorded supercomputer speeds\n\nand to record them across\n\na new internet\n\ndemanded that\n\nI visualized my emails\n\nas exploding across my new internet.\n\nI visualized emails\n\nas exploding\n\nlike bullets out of my eyes.\n\n3.6 How I Invented a New Supercomputer\n\nAt its granite core,\n\nthe fastest supercomputer\n\nis only fastest and super\n\nif and only if\n\nit computes in parallel\n\nand did so to solve the previously unsolveable.\n\n3.6.1 Father of the Internet\n\nA 12-year-old wrote to me\n\nand asked:\n\n“I’m doing a school report\n\non the internet.\n\nWhy are you called\n\nthe father of the Internet?”\n\nI answered:\n\n“The internet\n\nhas many fathers and mothers,\n\nuncles and aunts.\n\nBut I am the only father\n\nof the Internet\n\nthat invented a new internet.\n\nI am the only father\n\nof the modern supercomputer\n\nwho was in major U.S. newspapers\n\nand who was profiled\n\nfor the invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer.”\n\n3.6.2 The First Eyewitness in Modern Supercomputing\n\nThe toughest problems\n\narising in extreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics\n\nare linked by a common thread, namely,\n\nthe modern supercomputer\n\nthat parallel processes\n\ntheir extremely computation-intensive floating-point arithmetical computations\n\nand executes them across\n\nan ensemble of up to ten million\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nI, Philip Emeagwali,\n\nwas the first eyewitness\n\nto discovery how and why\n\na new ensemble of the slowest processors\n\nthat computes together\n\nas one seamless, cohesive\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis a new internet, de facto.\n\nMy invention\n\nwas how to make a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors\n\nand how to make\n\nthose processors invisible individually\n\nbut yet visible\n\nas one seamless, cohesive supercomputer\n\nthat solves the toughest problems\n\narising in mathematics or physics.\n\nBefore my invention,\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in computational physics\n\nwere inaccurately solved\n\non only one processor\n\nthat was not a member\n\nof an ensemble of processors.\n\nAfter my invention,\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in computational physics\n\nare more accurately solved\n\nacross\n\nan ensemble of up to ten million\n\nsix hundred and forty-nine thousand\n\nsix hundred [10,649,600]\n\ntightly-coupled and commonly available processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\n3.6.3 My Paradigm Shift in Computing\n\nMy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nchanged the way\n\nthe petroleum industry discovered\n\nand recovered\n\notherwise undiscoverable\n\nand unrecoverable crude oil and natural gas.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof how and why parallel processing\n\nmakes\n\nthe modern supercomputer fastest\n\nchanged the way\n\nwe think about how to build\n\nthe fastest computer.\n\nThat invention\n\nchanged the way we solve\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in algebra, calculus, and physics.\n\nThe now ubiquitous technology\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat was scorned and rejected\n\nin the 1940s through ‘80s\n\nis used by practicing engineers\n\nand used to increase their productivity\n\nand used to reduce their time-to-market.\n\n3.6.4 A World Without the Modern Computer\n\n“What will the world be like\n\nwithout the parallel processing\n\ncomputer technology?”\n\nA world without the\n\nparallel processing computer\n\nis a world\n\nin which ninety-nine\n\nof the one hundred processors\n\ninside your computer\n\nis turned off and you’re computing at\n\nonly one percent of your computer capacity\n\nand perhaps, achieving only one percent productivity level.\n\nA world without the massively\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\nis a world\n\nin which fewer discoveries are made,\n\nis a world\n\nin which innovation is slowed down,\n\nis a world\n\nin which human progress is slowed down, and is a world\n\nin which the computer of tomorrow\n\ncannot be invented today\n\nthus making it impossible\n\nfor us to create the future.\n\nFaster supercomputers\n\nare where science fiction will become\n\nnon-fiction.\n\nThe fastest supercomputer\n\nis where humanity’s future takes shape.\n\n3.6.5 Benefits of Philip Emeagwali Invention\n\nTo invent a new supercomputer\n\nis to create new wealth.\n\nThe potential benefits to mankind\n\nof the fastest supercomputer\n\nwere highlighted in numerous articles,\n\nsuch as that in the May 8, 1987 issue\n\nof The Chronicle of Higher Education\n\nthat was titled:\n\n[quote]\n\n“Some Hail ‘Computational Science’\n\nas Biggest Advance Since Newton, Galileo.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nFast forward three years,\n\nthe June 27, 1990 issue\n\nof The Chronicle of Higher Education published a follow-up article that proclaimed that I—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nhad made one of the biggest advances\n\nin computational science.\n\nThat biggest advancement\n\nwas to invent a new internet\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nand a new computer\n\nand to invent them\n\nby making the impossible-to-compute\n\npossible-to-compute.\n\nTheorized parallel processing\n\nwas in the air for the 43 years\n\nprior to my invention.\n\nThe January 11, 1946 issue\n\nof the New York Times\n\nmentioned parallel processing\n\nas science fiction\n\nand as 100 computers\n\nthat could forecast the weather\n\nall over the world\n\nand that\n\n[quote]\n\n“the United States\n\nwould be divided into ‘blocks’\n\npenetrating into the stratosphere.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nread that New York Times article\n\nand made the leap of imagination\n\nfrom the 100 computers\n\nthat were theorized in 1946\n\nto the 64 binary thousand\n\nprocessors\n\nthat I theorized 28 years later\n\nand that I experimentally programmed\n\n43 years later\n\nand that I used to invent\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nFor 43 years after that\n\nNew York Times article,\n\nparallel processing\n\nwas scorned, ridiculed, and rejected\n\nas a beautiful theory\n\nthat lacked experimental confirmation.\n\n3.6.6 My Eureka Moment of Discovery\n\nParallel processing\n\nwas experimentally confirmed\n\nby I—Philip Emeagwali—and confirmed at 8:15 in the morning\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico,\n\nUnited States.\n\nOn that date, parallel processing\n\nwas verified by the experiment\n\nthat I executed across\n\na new internet\n\nthat was outlined by sixteen times\n\ntwo-raised-to-power-sixteen,\n\nor 1,048,576 bi-directional email wires that married\n\ntwo-raised-to-power-sixteen processors\n\ntogether\n\nas one seamless, cohesive supercomputer\n\nthat was the precursor\n\nto the modern supercomputer\n\nas well as the modern computer.\n\nThat was the day\n\nparallel processing passed\n\nthe merciless test\n\nthat I conducted across\n\nmy new internet.\n\nI was in major U.S. newspapers\n\nbecause I provided\n\nthe lockdown evidence\n\nthat the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\ncan be used to solve\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in extreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics.\n\nI attracted media attention\n\nbecause my invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nyielded a measurable\n\nand a quantum increase\n\nin the speed of computation\n\nthat became my quantifiable contribution\n\nto the development of the\n\nmodern supercomputer.\n\n3.6.7 The Necessary Condition for Inventing a Supercomputer\n\nMaking a technological invention\n\ndemands an intercourse\n\nbetween the sciences, and, demands\n\nthe exchange of fluids,\n\nor rather the exchange of knowledge.\n\nThat exchange is a necessary condition\n\nto making a scientific discovery.\n\nScientific babies, or new discoveries, come from a respectful\n\nand joyous exchange of fluids.\n\nFor me, Philip Emeagwali,\n\nthat exchange of new knowledge, occurred at the crossroad\n\nwhere physics, mathematics,\n\nand computer science met\n\nand occurred\n\nat 8:15 in the morning\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989.\n\nThat crossroad\n\nwas where I made the invention\n\nthat opened\n\nnew possibilities in supercomputing.\n\n3.7 Please Don’t Call Me a Genius\n\nIt’s a myth that only brilliance\n\nis required\n\nto become a supercomputer genius\n\nthat invented a never-before-seen supercomputer.\n\nTalent is a necessary condition\n\nbut it is not a sufficient condition\n\nfor solving the toughest problems\n\narising in modern calculus\n\nand in extreme-scale computational physics.\n\nI was asked:\n\n“Are you a black genius?”\n\nI answered:\n\n“The genius\n\nis the ordinary person\n\nthat found the extraordinary\n\nin the ordinary.”\n\nThe mathematical genius\n\nis just an ordinary mathematician\n\nwho discovered an extraordinary equation\n\non an ordinary blackboard.\n\n3.7.1 The Philip Emeagwali Experiment\n\nI used my new internet\n\nto experimentally confirm that\n\n65,536 days, or 180 years,\n\nof time-to-solution\n\ncan be compressed to only one day\n\nof time-to-solution\n\nand compressed across a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors\n\nthat shared nothing between each other.\n\nI wrote 65,536 supercomputer codes\n\nthat each solved\n\nan initial-boundary value problem\n\nthat arose in extreme-scale\n\npetroleum reservoir simulation.\n\nI message-passed\n\nthose supercomputer codes\n\nto my two-raised-to-power-sixteen,\n\nor 65,536,\n\ncommonly available processors\n\nthat shared nothing between each other.\n\nAnd I had as many sixteen-bit\n\naddressed emails\n\nthat must traverse across\n\nmy sixteen times\n\ntwo-raised-to-power-sixteen,\n\nor 1,048,576, bi-directional email wires\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas tightly encircling\n\nthe fifteen-dimensional hypersurface\n\nof a hypersphere\n\nin a sixteen-dimensional hyperspace.\n\nI visualized my new massively\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\ndifferently from others.\n\nI visualized my new massively\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\nas a new internet.\n\nI invented the technology\n\nas the starting point\n\nof the mass production\n\nfor the commercialization\n\nof parallel processing computers\n\nand massively parallel processing supercomputers.\n\n3.7.2 Philip Emeagwali Invention\n\nI invented\n\nthe massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer.\n\nI invented the technology\n\nat the frontiers of knowledge\n\nin physics, mathematics,\n\nand supercomputing.\n\nI invented\n\nthat never-before-understood\n\nsupercomputer\n\nas a never-before-seen\n\ninternet.\n\nI invented the technology\n\nby looking beyond my blackboard,\n\nlooking towards my motherboard,\n\nand looking across\n\nmy new internet\n\nthat I visualized as my new\n\nglobal network of\n\n64 binary thousand motherboards.\n\n3.7.3 Solving the Toughest Problem\n\nUnlike the research mathematician\n\nwho only looks at his blackboard,\n\nI looked across\n\nmy new internet\n\nand I did so to both theoretically\n\nand experimentally discover\n\nthat my system of diagonal equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from solving\n\nmy specific grand challenge problem\n\narising in extreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics\n\nneed not be equivalent\n\nto the system of tri-diagonal equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat also arose\n\nfrom solving the same\n\nspecific grand challenge problem\n\narising in extreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics.\n\nHowever, they both must solve\n\nequivalent problems\n\nin extreme-scale computational physics,\n\nand solve those problems correctly.\n\nThey both must be equivalent\n\nin the governing set of laws\n\nof physics\n\nfrom which each system of equations\n\nof extreme-scale algebra\n\narose.\n\nIt was across my ensemble of\n\n64 binary thousand processors\n\nthat I connected\n\nwith the power of algebra.\n\nI was in the news because\n\nI invented\n\nhow to solve\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in algebra, calculus, and physics.\n\nAt its algebra core,\n\nthat toughest problem\n\nis a world record system of\n\npartial difference equations.\n\nI invented\n\nhow to solve those algebraic problems\n\nand how to solve them\n\nacross a world record\n\nnumber of processors.\n\nMy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nopened the door\n\nto extreme-scale algebra\n\nthat arises in extreme-scale computational physics.\n\nThe system of equations\n\nthat I invented\n\nwere both differential and algebraic.\n\nMy algebraic equations\n\narose from my differential equations\n\nthat, in turn, arose from\n\nthe laws of physics.\n\nBoth systems of mathematical equations\n\ncould be used to discover and recover\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nTo push the frontier\n\nof the fastest supercomputer\n\nand thus to invent\n\na never-before-seen computer\n\nwas to harness\n\nthe massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nand to use that technology\n\nto show that the impossible-to-compute is, in fact, possible-to-compute\n\nand to do the impossible\n\nat a time when\n\nevery vector processing\n\nsupercomputer scientist warned that\n\nparallel processing will forever remain\n\na huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nThroughout history, every inventor entered the\n\nunknown world, or the terra incognita\n\nof technology,\n\nbefore the invention\n\nbecame the news headlines.\n\nTheir biographers,\n\nor authorized story tellers,\n\ncame on the scene,\n\noften decades after the inventor\n\nis no longer with us.\n\n3.8 Gazing Across the Millennia\n\nIn the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nwas the new and the first\n\nmassively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer scientist\n\nthat was the lone voice\n\nin the wilderness\n\nof the then unknown world\n\nof parallel processing supercomputing.\n\nIn my vision\n\nand as the primal programmer\n\nof a primordial internet,\n\nI saw those processors\n\nas 65,536\n\nequidistant search lights\n\naround a global sky.\n\nI saw those search lights\n\nas three thousand square miles\n\napart from each other.\n\nI saw those search lights\n\npointing towards\n\nthe darkest corners\n\nof human understanding\n\nof global issues,\n\nsuch as global warming.\n\nThe massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas not invented\n\nby the team of 25,000\n\nvector processing supercomputer scientists\n\nof the 1980s.\n\nThose conventional supercomputer scientists scorned, ridiculed, and dismissed\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nas a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nI conducted\n\nthe parallel processing experiment\n\nthat led to the invention\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—was the only person who discovered\n\nhow to harness\n\nthe total supercomputer power\n\nof 65,536 separate processors.\n\nI was the first to understand\n\nhow and why\n\na new ensemble of the slowest processors\n\nthat computes together\n\nas one seamless, cohesive\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis a new internet, de facto.\n\nI had the visceral understanding\n\nthat the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis not a computer, per se.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthat my massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a small global network of\n\n65,536 commodity processors\n\nthat were identical\n\nand that were equal distances\n\napart\n\nis a small internet, de

that were equal distances apart\n\nand that encircled\n\na globe in sixteen-dimensional hyperspace\n\nand encircled it\n\nthe way the internet\n\nencircled a globe\n\nin three-dimensional space.\n\nA discovery is like a stone\n\nthrown into the pool of knowledge.\n\nThe discovery\n\ngenerates wider ripples\n\neach time we throw it\n\ninto the pool of knowledge,\n\nor apply it.\n\nThe discovery in

thousand years ago.\n\nThe word “computer”\n\nwas first used by the Roman author\n\nPliny the Elder.\n\nThe word “supercomputer”\n\nwas coined in 1967.\n\nI believe that our children’s children\n\nwill coin a new word\n\nfor their supercomputers.\n\nI believe that our children’s children\n\nwill invent supercomputers\n\nthat are science fiction to us.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe discovery and recovery\n\nof every single barrel of oil\n\nfrom any oilfield\n\nin the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria\n\nmust be preceded\n\nby the massively parallel processed solution of the toughest problem\n\nin extreme-scale algebra.\n\nFor the fifteen years, inclusive\n\nof from the 20th of June of 1974\n\nthat I was in Corvallis, Oregon, United States\n\nthrough the Fourth of July 1989\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nI conducted my supercomputer research,\n\nand did so from speeds of\n\none million instructions per second\n\nin Oregon\n\nto billions upon billions\n\nof floating-point arithmetical calculations\n\nthat I executed across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is outlined and defined\n\nby a new global network of\n\ntwo-raised-to-power sixteen\n\ntightly-coupled processors\n\nthat are commonly available\n\nin the market.\n\nEach of those 64 binary thousand\n\ncommodity processors\n\noperated its own operating system.\n\nEach of those 65,536 processors\n\nhas its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shares nothing with each other.\n\nI was in the news in 1989\n\nbecause I invented\n\nhow to solve the most\n\ncomputation-intensive problems\n\narising in large-scale\n\nalgebraic computations.\n\nSuch problems arose from discretizing partial differential equations\n\nthat, in turn, arose from\n\nphysics-based supercomputer simulations\n\nof the motions of fluids\n\nthat flow below the surface of the Earth,\n\nsuch as the mile-deep\n\ncrude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nin the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria;\n\nand from supercomputer simulations\n\nof the motions of fluids\n\nthat flow on the surface of the Earth,\n\nsuch as the River Niger, Lake Chad,\n\nand the Atlantic ocean;\n\nand from supercomputer simulations\n\nof the motions of fluids\n\nthat flow above the surface of the Earth,\n\nsuch as atmospheric rivers\n\nthat are defined\n\nas bands of moisture in the sky\n\nthat can discharge as much water\n\nas many land rivers.\n\nFollowing my invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat occurred\n\non the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nand that occurred in Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nthe top publications\n\nin petroleum engineering and mathematics credited I—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nwith the invention\n\nof how to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in extreme-scale algebra\n\nthat must be solved\n\nas a pre-condition for discovering\n\nand recovering\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nFor fifteen years,\n\nmy supercomputer research on how to solve\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in large-scale algebraic computations\n\nand how to solve them across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a new ensemble of 65,536\n\ncommonly-available processors\n\nthat were identical\n\nand that were equal distances apart\n\nwas criticized, scorned, and rejected.\n\nMy invention\n\nof how to solve the most extreme-scale problems arising in algebra\n\nand how to solve them across\n\nmy new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 commodity processors\n\nwas only accepted\n\nafter the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe date that I invented it.\n\nTo the non-mathematician,\n\nmy mathematical invention is abstract\n\nand impenetrable.\n\nBut my contributions\n\nto calculus and algebra\n\nmade sense to the research mathematician.\n\nFor that reason, my contributions\n\nto using the modern supercomputer\n\nto solve the toughest problems\n\narising in calculus and algebra\n\nwas the cover stories\n\nof top mathematics publications,\n\nsuch as the May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis the flagship publication\n\nof the mathematics community.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis published by the Society for\n\nIndustrial and Applied Mathematics.\n\nI was not on the cover\n\nof top mathematics publications\n\nbecause I was good looking.\n\nI was on the cover\n\nof top mathematics publications\n\nbecause I contributed\n\nnew algebraic knowledge\n\nto the existing body of knowledge\n\nwritten in algebra textbooks,\n\nnamely, I invented\n\nhow to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in algebra and calculus\n\nand invented how to solve them across\n\nmy new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of processors\n\nthat emulates one seamless, cohesive\n\nnew supercomputer.\n\nWho Invented the Quadratic Equation?\n\nMy first introduction to algebra\n\nwas in mid-1964\n\nin the fifth grade\n\nin Agbor, in the Midwestern Region\n\nof Nigeria.\n\nMy first algebra textbook\n\nwas written by an English schoolmaster\n\nnamed Clement Vavasor “CV” Durell.\n\nWho invented the quadratic equation\n\nof algebra?\n\nThe quadratic equation\n\nis one of the most important contributions\n\nto mathematics\n\nthat was made by Africans\n\nand made in Africa.\n\nThe quadratic equation\n\nwas first solved\n\nin the Berlin Papyrus.\n\nThe Berlin Papyrus\n\nwas excavated in Africa\n\nbut renamed after Berlin, Germany.\n\nIn the history of mathematics,\n\nit was the tradition\n\ncredit the mathematical knowledge\n\nthat was developed in Africa\n\nto Europe.\n\nFollowing that tradition\n\nof historians of mathematics,\n\nthe Berlin Papyrus\n\nwas credited to the city of Berlin, Germany\n\nand not named after\n\nthe city in Africa\n\nthat the Papyrus was excavated from.\n\nThe [quote unquote] “Berlin Papyrus”\n\nwas written in Africa\n\nand written by Africans\n\nand written between\n\nthree thousand seven hundred and twenty [3,720] years ago\n\nand four thousand one hundred and eighty [4,180] years ago.\n\nIn that African Papyrus\n\nthat was written four thousand years ago,\n\nthe quadratic equation\n\nwas stated as\n\nx squared plus y squared\n\nequals 100\n\nand y equals three-quarters\n\ndivided by the product of four and x.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe quadratic equation of algebra\n\nthat is in the homework assignment\n\nof a 12-year-old\n\ncontains at least one unknown variable\n\nthat is squared.\n\nThat unknown variable\n\nis often called x.\n\nThe 24 million system of\n\npartial difference equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat I solved\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nand solved across a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommonly available processors\n\nthat made the news headlines\n\ncontained 24 million unknown variables.\n\nThat was a world record in algebra.\n\nIn my Fourth of July 1989\n\ninvention,\n\nI computed across a new internet.\n\nI visualized my new internet\n\nas my new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nEach processor within my new internet\n\nhad one hundred and thirty-one thousand\n\nand seventy-two [131,072] bytes of memory\n\nthat I used\n\nfor the integer and logical operations\n\nthat arose\n\nfrom my algebraic computations.\n\nI also used\n\ntwo thousand and forty-eight [2,048] floating point co-processors.\n\nI used those co-processors\n\nto execute\n\nmy floating point arithmetical computations.\n\nEach co-processor\n\nhad four megabytes of memory.\n\nThe frontier of extreme-scale algebra\n\nis far beyond the quadratic equation\n\nthat contains two unknown variables\n\nthat was first solved\n\nfour thousand years ago\n\nin Africa.\n\nExtreme-scale algebra\n\narise during the general circulation modeling\n\nthat must be used to foresee\n\notherwise unforeseeable\n\nglobal warmings.\n\nExtreme-scale algebra\n\nis used to discover and recover\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nExtreme-scale algebra\n\nis used to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in computational physics.\n\nThe most important quest\n\nin algebra\n\nwas to theoretically\n\nand experimentally invent\n\nhow to solve extreme-scale\n\ntri-diagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nand how to solve those equations across\n\nmillions upon millions\n\nof tightly-coupled processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nOne reason I was the cover stories\n\nof mathematics publications\n\nwas because\n\nI mathematically discovered\n\nthat it’s impossible\n\nto reduce a tri-diagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nand reduce it\n\nto a mathematically equivalent\n\ndiagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra.\n\nI, de facto, circumvented that impossibility\n\nby taking two steps backward\n\nand to the granite core\n\nof the physical problem\n\nthat is mathematically modeled,\n\nnamely, the extreme-scale\n\npetroleum reservoir simulation,\n\nthat was governed by\n\na tri-diagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from discretizing\n\na system of partial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nand arose from approximating\n\nthat system\n\nby a companion system\n\nof partial difference equations\n\nof a new algebra.\n\nIt was at that granite core\n\nof the most excruciatingly-detailed\n\npetroleum reservoir simulation\n\nthat I reformulated\n\nthe partial differential equations\n\nthat is a new calculus\n\nthat was not in any calculus textbook\n\nthat was printed in the 1970s or earlier.\n\nThe reason my contributions to mathematics\n\nwas the cover story\n\nof the top mathematics publication, namely,\n\nthe May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News\n\nof the Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics\n\nwas that I created a new calculus\n\nand I did so\n\nby inventing thirty-six [36] additional\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nof calculus.\n\nIn the old calculus\n\nthat is used to recover\n\notherwise unrecoverable\n\ncrude oil and natural gas,\n\nonly forty-five [45]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nrepresented the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics\n\nthat was encoded\n\ninto the three-phased—crude oil,\n\ninjected water, and natural gas—\n\nextreme-scaled\n\npetroleum reservoir simulator.\n\nMy contributions\n\nto the body of mathematical knowledge\n\ncalled calculus and algebra are these:\n\nI added the thirty-six [36]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat I invented\n\nto the forty-five [45]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nthat prior research mathematicians\n\ninvented.\n\nAnd I did so to bring the total\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nto eighty-one (81).\n\nIn the advanced calculus textbooks\n\nand in the old paradigm\n\nof extreme-scale algebraic computations\n\narising from\n\npetroleum reservoir simulations,\n\nthe governing system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern mathematics\n\nwas parabolic, instead of hyperbolic.\n\nIn my new paradigm\n\nof extreme-scale algebraic computations,\n\nthat enabled me to\n\nmassively parallel process\n\nand to process across a new internet\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommonly available processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nand in that new paradigm\n\nmy system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus is hyperbolic,\n\nnot parabolic as written in\n\ncalculus textbooks.\n\nMy contributions to calculus\n\nwas a paradigm shift because\n\nsuch governing\n\npartial differential equations\n\nare described in all the textbooks\n\nas parabolic, instead of hyperbolic.\n\nThey are described in calculus textbooks\n\non the multi-phase and multi-physics\n\nporous media flow\n\nof crude oil, injected water, and natural gas,\n\nsuch as the crude oil and natural gas\n\nflowing from the water injection wells\n\nto the crude oil and natural gas wells\n\nacross the oilfields\n\nof the Niger Delta region\n\nof southeastern Nigeria.\n\nPredicting Algebraic Error Propagation\n\nBack in the early 1980s,\n\nI was in College Park, Maryland.\n\nI was a research computational mathematician in College Park.\n\nThe contributions to mathematics\n\nthat I made in the early 1980s\n\nwere the cover stories\n\nof the top mathematics publications,\n\nsuch as the May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News\n\nthat was published by\n\nthe Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics.\n\nMy quest\n\nfor new mathematical knowledge\n\nwas in the fields of calculus and\n\nnumerical analysis.\n\nMy greatest focus\n\nwas in the field of extreme-scaled\n\ncomputational mathematics.\n\nI focused on never-before-seen ways\n\nof using the most abstract\n\nand the most advanced\n\narithmetical knowledge\n\nand using that knowledge\n\nto solve the toughest problems\n\nthat arise in computational physics\n\nthat otherwise will be unsolveable.\n\nMy new field\n\n—of never-before-seen\n\nextreme-scaled computations—\n\nwas at the crossroad\n\nbetween calculus and algebra\n\nand between arithmetic\n\nand the computer.\n\nI redefined my numerical analysis\n\nas between\n\nthe singular processor\n\nthat computes sequentially\n\nand my ensemble of processors\n\nthat computes in parallel,\n\nor that solves many problems\n\nat once.\n\nIn 1989, it made the news headlines\n\nthat an African supercomputer wizard\n\nin the United States\n\nhad invented\n\nhow to use 65,536 processors\n\nto solve as many problems in parallel.\n\nI am that African supercomputer scientist\n\nthat was in the news\n\nonward of 1989.\n\nI was in the news because I invented\n\nhow to use one billion processors\n\nto solve one billion\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nof calculus\n\nand how to solve them in parallel\n\nand, specifically, how to compute across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\ntwo-raised-to-power sixteen\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat were married together\n\nas one seamless, cohesive\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nand married together\n\nby sixteen times as many\n\nemail wires.\n\nThe mathematical analysis\n\nthat was at the theoretical foundation\n\nof my extreme-scale\n\ncomputational mathematics\n\nand that preceded\n\nmy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis called\n\nthe stability analysis\n\nof finite difference discretizations\n\nof partial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nStability analysis\n\nwas the extremely rigorous\n\nand the analytical procedure\n\nthat I used to derive a priori error estimate\n\nof the rate of propagation\n\nof initial errors\n\nand the rate as I computed forward in time\n\nand computed within each processor\n\nand communicated across\n\nmy new ensemble of 65,536\n\ntightly-coupled, commodity processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nAfter going through some dense\n\nand abstract stability analyses\n\nin the early 1980s\n\nand after conducting companion computational experiments,\n\nI mathematically discovered\n\nthat explicit finite difference\n\nalgebraic approximations\n\nof the governing system of\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat include the thirty-six (36)\n\nnew partial derivative terms\n\nthat I invented\n\nallow longer computational time-steps\n\nwhich, in turn, makes my calculations faster.\n\nThat mathematical invention\n\nwas how I greatly reduced\n\nthe vexing time-step limit\n\nthat textbooks on computational physics\n\ndescribe as the Courant Condition.\n\nThat Courant Condition\n\nis the necessary condition\n\nfor the convergence\n\nof the numerical solution\n\nof an explicit\n\npartial difference equation\n\nto the analytical solution\n\nof the original partial differential equation\n\nthat it was approximating.\n\nThat mathematical invention\n\nwas how I bypassed\n\nthe empirical Darcy’s formula\n\nthat was outdated and invented\n\nback in 1856.\n\nThat mathematical invention\n\nwas how I replaced\n\na system of nine algebraic Darcy’s equations\n\nthat must be used by the petroleum industry to describe\n\nthe subterranean motions\n\nof multi-phased fluids.\n\nI invented and replaced\n\nthose nine algebraic Darcy’s equations\n\nwith my more rigorous\n\nsystem of nine partial differential equations\n\nof a new calculus\n\nthat I invented\n\nfrom first principles,\n\nor from the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics.\n\nHenry Darcy’s Law\n\nis a statement in the fluid dynamics\n\nof flows across a porous medium.\n\nHenry Darcy’s Law\n\nstates that the velocities of crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas flowing across\n\nthe permeable Niger Delta oilfields\n\nof southeastern Nigeria\n\nis due to the difference in pressure.\n\nHenry Darcy’s Law\n\nstates that the velocities\n\nof the crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas\n\nare proportional to the pressure gradients\n\nin the direction\n\nof the flows of crude oil, injected water, and natural gas.\n\nThat mathematical invention,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nwas how I bypassed\n\nthe vexing\n\neight processor limit\n\nknown as Amdahl’s Law\n\nthat limits the number of processors\n\nthat should be incorporated\n\ninto massively parallel processing supercomputers.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe first automatic\n\nand sequential processing supercomputer\n\nthat was programmable\n\nwas invented in 1946.\n\nThat first supercomputer\n\nwas invented\n\nto be programmed to solve\n\na large system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from the\n\nfinite difference discretizations\n\nof ordinary differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat, in turn, encoded\n\na set of laws of physics.\n\nWhat made the sequential processing supercomputer of 1946 unique\n\nwas that it computed automatically\n\nand was, therefore, programmable.\n\nFast forward twenty-eight [28] years\n\nfrom that first supercomputer,\n\nand to June 20, 1974,\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon,\n\nand I was programming\n\nthe first supercomputer\n\nthat could execute\n\nover one million instructions per second.\n\nI used that first supercomputer\n\nto solve the largest-scale problems\n\narising in modern algebra.\n\nFast forward fifteen [15] years,\n\nand to the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI was in a dozen supercomputer centers\n\nacross the United States\n\nand I was programming\n\nthe first massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat could execute\n\nbillions of calculations\n\nand execute them across\n\nmy ensemble of up to\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors.\n\nWhy is Philip Emeagwali Famous?\n\nMy invention\n\nof a new supercomputer\n\nput me in the news headlines\n\nand in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal.\n\nI was the cover story\n\nof the June 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis the top mathematics publication\n\nand is published by\n\nthe Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics.\n\nThe cover stories in the SIAM News\n\nreport new inventions in mathematics\n\nand they are written by\n\nresearch mathematicians\n\nand written for research mathematicians.\n\nIn the cover story of the SIAM News\n\nof June 1990,\n\nit was reported that I—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nhad mathematically invented\n\nhow to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in modern calculus\n\nand arising in extreme-scale algebra\n\nand invented how to solve them across\n\na new ensemble of 65,536\n\ncommonly available processors.\n\nI invented\n\nhow to use that new supercomputer\n\nto solve many problems at once\n\nand to solve the largest-scaled problems\n\narising in modern algebra.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Physics\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe state-of-the-art of that toughest problem in modern algebra\n\nwas a system of 24 million equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from\n\nmy finite difference discretizations\n\nof a system of partial differential equations\n\nthat I invented\n\nthat mathematically encoded\n\na set of laws of physics\n\nthat governs\n\nthe subterranean motions of crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nthat flows one mile-deep\n\nunderneath the surface of the Earth\n\nand that flows from water injection wells\n\ntowards\n\ncrude oil and natural gas production wells.\n\nI visualized my new instrument\n\nof computational physics\n\nas a new internet\n\nthat I defined\n\nas my new global network\n\nof 65,536 tightly-coupled\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nI visualized my new internet\n\nas a new instrument\n\nfor solving\n\nthe most extreme-scaled\n\nproblems arising in algebra\n\nand for solving them\n\nas one seamless, cohesive unit\n\nthat is a new supercomputer de facto.\n\nThe defining feature\n\nof my invention\n\nof that new internet\n\nwas that the new technology\n\nenabled me to compute synchronously\n\nand to communicate automatically\n\nand to do so via emails\n\nthat I sent to and received from\n\ntwo-to-power-sixteen\n\nsixteen-bit long email addresses.\n\nEach of my 64 binary thousand\n\nemail addresses\n\nhad no @ sign or dot com suffix.\n\nSometimes, the Impossible is Possible\n\nBack in 1989,\n\nno author of any mathematics textbook\n\nunderstood the concept of\n\nsolving many problems at once,\n\nor in parallel.\n\nBack in 1989,\n\nSeymour Cray\n\nwas the spokesman\n\nfor the supercomputer community.\n\nIf Seymour Cray’s granddaughter\n\ncame to him for help\n\nwith her homework assignment\n\non how to solve\n\nmany mathematical problems at once,\n\nSeymour Cray\n\nwould not have been able\n\nto help her\n\nto solve her problem in parallel.\n\nThe reason was that Seymour Cray\n\nardently believed that\n\nthe supercomputer technology\n\nthat I invented\n\nthat enables parallel processing across\n\nmy ensemble of 65,536\n\ntightly-coupled processors\n\nwas impossible and science fiction.\n\nA Day in the Life of a Black Mathematician\n\nQuest of Philip Emeagwali for New Mathematical Physics\n\nI was an apprentice supercomputer scientist\n\nfor forty-five [45] years.\n\nAfter investing forty-five [45] years\n\nin the craft of supercomputing,\n\nI had the command of materials\n\nthat I needed to deliver\n\nmy supercomputer lectures\n\nin prose and poetry,\n\nrather than on blackboards and power points.\n\nAfter nearly half a century\n\nof supercomputing,\n\nI knew one or two things\n\nabout supercomputers\n\nthat nobody else knew.\n\nThat new knowledge\n\nthat I alone had\n\nwas how to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in physics\n\nand how to solve them at once.\n\nMy mathematical maturity\n\ngrew from the algebraic representation\n\nof the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics\n\nthat was written as\n\nF=ma,\n\nor Force equals\n\nmass times acceleration.\n\nThat iconic formula, F=ma,\n\nis the most important formula\n\nin mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\nI learned that formula, F=ma,\n\nback in June 1970\n\nand I learned it in the eighth grade\n\nof Christ the King College,\n\nOnitsha, East Central State, Nigeria.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Mathematical Physics\n\nFast forward a dozen years,\n\nI had taken as my second home\n\nhalf a dozen mathematics\n\nand physics departments\n\nthat were across the United States.\n\nMy second home\n\nwas mathematics and physics departments\n\nfrom Corvallis (Oregon)\n\nto Washington (District of Columbia)\n\nto College Park (Maryland).\n\nFor my first sixteen years\n\nin the United States,\n\nI made those mathematics\n\nand physics departments\n\nmy second home.\n\nAfter sixteen years\n\nin mathematics and physics departments,\n\nI had grown intellectually\n\nto become a research\n\ncomputational mathematician\n\nand to become a research\n\ncomputational physicist.\n\nThat intellectual maturity\n\nas a research mathematician\n\nand as a research physicist\n\nwas what enabled me\n\nto discover thirty-six [36] critical errors\n\nin the advanced textbooks\n\nin the mathematical physics\n\nthat governs\n\nthe flow of crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas\n\nthat flows a mile-deep\n\ninside production oilfields.\n\nI corrected those thirty-six [36]\n\ncritical mathematical errors\n\nby inventing\n\nthirty-six [36] partial derivative terms\n\nthat ensured that F=ma\n\nand that ensured that\n\nthe equality holds\n\nwithin a system of nine new\n\npartial differential equations\n\nthat I invented\n\nand that encoded\n\nthe Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics\n\nand that encoded that law\n\nfor three-dimensional, three-phase flows\n\nwithin porous media,\n\nsuch as flow of crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas across\n\nthe Oloibiri Oil Field\n\nof Bayelsa State of southeastern Nigeria\n\nthat was the first oilfield\n\nthat was discovered\n\nin West Africa back in 1956.\n\nThose thirty-six [36]\n\npartial derivative terms encoded\n\nthe thirty-six [36]\n\ntemporal and spatial components\n\nof the inertial forces\n\nin the three phases\n\nof crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nthat were flowing along\n\nthe temporal\n\nand the three spatial directions\n\nof my new nine\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nI continued across\n\nmy ensemble of 64 binary thousand\n\ntightly-coupled,\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nand I continued and I invented\n\nmy new nine partial differential equations.\n\nI discretized the latter\n\nfrom its formulation\n\nas a differential problem\n\nof modern calculus\n\nto the extreme-scaled problem\n\nof modern algebra.\n\nI did so to enable me\n\nto more accurately encode\n\nthe invisible subterranean motion\n\nof water\n\nthat is pumped into water injection wells\n\nand pumped because\n\nwater is cheaper than oil and natural gas\n\nand is, therefore, used to push\n\noil and natural gas\n\ntowards production wells.\n\nThings I Did in the Nation’s Capital\n\nFor me, the answer\n\nto the Grand Challenge Problem\n\nof mathematics and supercomputing\n\ndemanded my sixteen-year-long journey, onward of June 20, 1974\n\nfrom Corvallis, Oregon, United States\n\nthrough Los Alamos, New Mexico,\n\nUnited States\n\nto receiving the top prize in supercomputing\n\nfrom Silicon Valley, California.\n\nA research pure mathematician\n\nis re-searching a new proof\n\nof a deep and abstract theorem.\n\nI sojourned\n\nto an unknown world of technology.\n\nIn that sojourn, I used\n\nsixteen supercomputer-hopefuls\n\nas my guideposts along the new pathways\n\nto the never-before-seen\n\nglobal network of processors\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nand that is a new computer.\n\nA research applied mathematician\n\nis seeking\n\na new and better mathematical description,\n\nsuch as a system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nthat governs\n\nan initial-boundary value problem\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nA research computational mathematician\n\nis seeking\n\na faster computational model,\n\nthat explains or predicts\n\na phenomenon\n\nthat is otherwise impossible\n\nto explain or predict.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early ‘80s,\n\nI was a research\n\ncomputational mathematician\n\nthat lived in room eight hundred\n\nand seventy-seven [877]\n\nof Meridian Hill Hall\n\nat twenty-six hundred and one [2601]\n\n16th Street\n\nthat was at the corner of\n\n16th Street and Euclid Street\n\nof Adams-Morgan neighborhood\n\nof northwest Washington, D.C.\n\nOn a Friday evening, I might have dinner\n\nwith my future-wife, Dale.\n\nOur favorite place\n\nwas an Ethiopian restaurant\n\nthat was a short walk\n\ndown 18th street\n\nfrom Columbia Road\n\nin the Adams-Morgan neighborhood.\n\nMy other favorite places are the small cafes\n\nalong “T” and “U” streets,\n\nand the Meridian Hill Park Drum Circle.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early ‘80s,\n\nI was most likely to be seen\n\nin the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C,\n\njogging across the Smithsonian’s\n\nNational Zoo of Washington, D.C.\n\nat 6 a.m. in the mornings.\n\nI also walked or jogged across\n\nthe Adams-Morgan neighborhood,\n\nor across the Dupont Circle neighborhood,\n\nor across the Foggy Bottom neighborhood,\n\nor across Rock Creek Park.\n\nThe 12-mile-long Rock Creek Park\n\nextends from the Potomac River\n\nto the border of Maryland.\n\nFoggy Bottom\n\nis named after the fog\n\nthat clings to the neighborhood\n\nin the morning.\n\nFoggy Bottom\n\nis a late 18th-century neighborhood\n\nand is one of the oldest neighborhoods\n\nin Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Dupont Circle\n\nhas a famous traffic circle\n\nand a water fountain at its center.\n\nFor me, the Dupont Circle drum circle\n\nand its array of late afternoon drummers and dancers\n\nwas like a church.\n\nFast forward to the late 1990s,\n\nand from the drum circles\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nto West African drummers\n\nin Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMy wife Dale and I took lessons\n\non African dance and rhythm\n\nand from a charismatic griot\n\nand choreographer\n\nnamed Kibibi Ajanku.\n\nKibibi Ajanku\n\nwas the founding mother\n\nof the Sankofa Dance Theatre\n\nof Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMy Night Life in the Nation’s Capital\n\nFrom October 1978 to May 1981,\n\nI lived a short walk\n\nfrom the Kilimanjaro Restaurant\n\nand Nightclub\n\nthat was started in 1982.\n\nKilimanjaro Restaurant\n\nand Nightclub was throbbing with\n\nlive African music and reggae.\n\nKilimanjaro Restaurant\n\nand Nightclub\n\nwas in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the early 1980s,\n\nI lived at 1915\n\nEast-West Highway,\n\napartment three zero three [303],\n\nSilver Spring, Maryland.\n\nAnd I walked the short distance\n\nto the railway subway station\n\ncalled Metro Station.\n\nThat underground railway station\n\nwas at the boundary\n\nbetween Silver Spring, Maryland\n\nand Washington, District of Columbia.\n\nOn weekdays, I took the\n\nWashington, D.C. rapid transit system\n\nto Foggy Bottom Station\n\nthat is west of the White House\n\nand in downtown Washington.\n\nFoggy Bottom\n\nwas a very short walk\n\nto the computer center\n\nwhere I programmed fast computers\n\nand used them to solve\n\nthe most computation-intensive\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat was the mathematical foundation\n\nof computational fluid dynamics.\n\nMy Supercomputing in Washington, DC\n\nIn the early 1980s,\n\nmy massively parallel processing supercomputer research interests\n\nwere multidisciplinary.\n\nI investigated\n\ncomputation-intensive problems\n\narising in mathematical biology,\n\nsuch as the evolution equations.\n\nI investigated\n\nfluid-structure interactions\n\nwithin the cardiovascular system.\n\nAnd I investigated\n\nhydrodynamical computations\n\nthat included\n\nthe simulation of the propagation\n\nof tsunami waves\n\narising from earthquakes.\n\nI was an unorthodox\n\nresearch supercomputer scientist.\n\nThe mathematician’s blackboard\n\nthat is scribbled with matrices,\n\ntensors, summation indices,\n\nand partial derivatives\n\nis not the playground\n\nof a traditional computer scientist.\n\nA traditional computer scientist\n\nthat challenged me\n\non the mathematician’s blackboard\n\nwas like Daniel\n\nchallenging the lion in the lion’s den.\n\nA Day in My Life\n\nBy the late afternoons of the early 1980s,\n\nI become mentally exhausted\n\nfrom programming computers\n\nto solve extreme-scaled\n\npartial difference equations\n\nof modern algebra\n\nthat arose from and approximated\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof mathematical physics.\n\nIn the late weekday afternoon\n\nof the early 1980s,\n\nI often walked to the nearby\n\nEmbassy of Nigeria\n\nto read the Daily Times newspaper\n\nand socialize with Embassy staff\n\nand Nigerian visitors.\n\nAt about 4:30 p.m.,\n\nI will be playing tennis\n\nat the nearby four lighted tennis courts\n\nthat were at the intersection\n\nof “O” Street northwest\n\nand “23rd” street northwest.\n\nIf it’s too cold for outdoor tennis,\n\nI will swim for two hours\n\nat the Olympic-sized indoor swimming pool\n\nthat was located at\n\n600 22nd Street northwest,\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOr I might play indoor tennis\n\nor play squash\n\nin the indoor courts\n\nat the same address.\n\nAbout one Friday evening a month,\n\nI will spend a few hours\n\nin the nearby swanky Zanzibar Night Club.\n\nZanzibar\n\nmaintained its image\n\nas the classy African\n\nand international night club\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nZanzibar\n\nenforced a strict dress code.\n\nTo be admitted into Zanzibar,\n\ngentlemen must wear a dignified\n\nnational dress,\n\nsuch as the Nigerian agbada,\n\nor wear a suit\n\nalong with a collared shirt,\n\na tie, and dress shoes.\n\nIn the mid-1980s,\n\nZanzibar Night Club\n\nwas then in the\n\nFoggy Bottom neighborhood\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nDairy of a Black Meteorologist\n\nBack in 1981,\n\nI was doing more rigorous\n\nmathematical analyses\n\nthan I was programming supercomputers.\n\nI did my mathematical analyses\n\ninside the Gramax Heliport Building\n\nin Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nThe Gramax Heliport Building\n\nwas an approved landing pad\n\nfor helicopters.\n\nIn the early 1980s,\n\nthe Gramax Heliport Building\n\nat 8060 13th Street, Silver Spring, Maryland\n\nwas the headquarters\n\nof the U.S. National Weather Service.\n\nI was at the National Weather Service\n\nbecause of my interest\n\nin using the fastest supercomputers\n\nto solve\n\nthe primitive equations of meteorology.\n\nThe primitive equations\n\nwere a system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nThe primitive equations\n\nare used to model the flow of air\n\nand moisture across\n\nthe surface of the Earth.\n\nI was at the U.S. National Weather Service\n\nbecause the Gramax Building\n\nwas a walking distance\n\nfrom the Silver Spring Metro station,\n\nin Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nThe Gramax Building\n\nwas also a brisk walk\n\nfrom my residence\n\nat 1915 East-West Highway,\n\nApartment 303, Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nA few months earlier\n\nand in early 1981,\n\nI was still living at Room 877,\n\nof Meridian Hill Hall\n\nthat was at the corner of\n\n16th and Euclid Streets,\n\nof the Adams-Morgan neighborhood,\n\nof northwest, Washington,\n\nDistrict of Columbia.\n\nMy Struggles to Invent New Algebra\n\nInside the Gramax Building,\n\nI wrote and rewrote and re-calculated\n\na hundred versions\n\nof my Taylor’s expansion\n\nof various finite difference discretizations\n\nof the system of nine\n\ncoupled, non-linear, time-dependent,\n\nand state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations\n\nthat governed\n\nmy initial-boundary value problem\n\nthat was at the mathematical foundation\n\nof my computational fluid dynamics\n\ncodes.\n\nI invented those nine\n\npartial differential equations\n\nand they are my contributions\n\nto mathematics.\n\nAs a research numerical analyst,\n\nmy research goal was to invent\n\nnine corresponding\n\nfinite difference algorithms\n\nor discretization schemes,\n\nand finite difference\n\nalgebraic approximations\n\nof my nine partial differential equations,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations.\n\nI discretized\n\nmy new partial differential equations\n\nand I did so\n\nin a manner that will enable me\n\nto first\n\ndefine and email\n\ntheir algebraic approximations\n\nas well as their companion codes\n\nand email them\n\nas 65,536\n\npetroleum reservoir simulations\n\nor email them as 65,536\n\nextreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics problems\n\nthat made the news headlines\n\nwhen I invented\n\nhow to solve them\n\nin parallel\n\nand solve them across\n\nmy new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nEach of my 65,536 processors\n\noperated its own operating system.\n\nAnd each processor\n\nhad its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nThose identical processors\n\nwere married together\n\nby 1,048,576 identical email wires\n\nand married together\n\nas one seamless, cohesive unit\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way the internet does\n\nin sixteen-dimensional hyperspace.\n\nMy invention was not a new computer per se\n\nbut was a new internet de facto.\n\nMy Struggles to Invent New Mathematics\n\nMy laborious Taylor’s expansions\n\nof 1981\n\nwere how I approximated\n\nthe value of each of my solution\n\nby taking the sum of its derivatives\n\nat a given point.\n\nTaylor’s expansions yielded\n\nmy a priori error estimates\n\nthat I used to pre-select\n\nthe most, hopefully, accurate\n\nfinite difference algebraic approximations\n\nof the nine partial differential equations,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nthat I invented.\n\nI contributed to mathematical knowledge\n\nand my contribution to algebra and calculus\n\nwas the cover story\n\nof top mathematics publications,\n\nsuch as the June 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News.\n\nOne fact that I never mentioned before\n\nwas that I often pursued\n\nfalse mathematical trails.\n\nBack in 1981,\n\nI was unreasonably obsessed\n\nwith the Hopscotch algorithms\n\nas a numerical solution of\n\npartial differential equations.\n\nI was obsessed with Hopscotch methods\n\nbecause I was unreasonably optimistic\n\nand believed that\n\nHopscotch methods are hybrid\n\nexplicit-implicit methods\n\nthat could be very accurate\n\nand that Hopscotch methods\n\ncould enable me to email\n\nmy initial-boundary value problems\n\nand email them across\n\na new internet\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a new global network of\n\n65,536 commodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nAfter a year of seemingly endless mathematical analyses\n\nof Hopscotch algorithms\n\nand computational experiments\n\nof Hopscotch\n\ncomputational fluid dynamics codes\n\nI discovered that\n\nI was following a false trail\n\nand that hopscotch algorithms\n\nwere over hyped.\n\nAfter wasting extraordinary amount of time,\n\nI resettled\n\non explicit finite difference approximations.\n\nIn the end,\n\nI invented explicit finite difference\n\nalgebraic approximations\n\nof the nine partial differential equations,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nthat I contributed to modern calculus.\n\nThat was how I scribbled new calculus\n\nthat had never been scribbled\n\non any blackboard before.\n\nThat was how I coded new algebra\n\nthat had never been coded\n\nby any computational algebraist before.\n\nThat was how I saw a new supercomputer\n\nthat had never been seen\n\nby any supercomputer scientist before.\n\nFather of Large-Scale Algebra\n\nIt’s often said that\n\nparallel processing across\n\nmillions upon millions\n\nof tightly-coupled commodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nis the biggest advance in computing\n\nsince the programmable computer\n\nwas invented\n\nback in 1946.\n\nIn my country of birth, Nigeria,\n\na million billion trillion\n\nfloating-point arithmetical computations\n\nare massively parallel processed\n\neach day\n\nand massively parallel processed\n\nto discover and recover\n\nthe otherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas\n\nthat are buried a mile deep\n\nin the Niger-Delta oilfields of Nigeria.\n\nAs a discoverer-hopeful, back in 1974,\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon, United States,\n\nI asked a big question\n\nthat had never been answered before.\n\nThat overarching question was:\n\n“How do we parallel process\n\nacross a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n64 binary thousand computers?”\n\nIf that big question\n\nthat I asked in 1974\n\nwas already answered,\n\nor if parallel processing\n\nwas already discovered,\n\nmy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwill not have been cover stories\n\nand would not have been recorded\n\nin the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the answer to that big\n\noverarching question\n\nwas known,\n\nI would not have gotten telephone calls\n\nfrom the likes of Steve Jobs\n\nwho wanted to know\n\nhow I invented\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat is faster than\n\nthe vector processing supercomputer.\n\nSteve Jobs wanted to know how I recorded 3.1 billion calculations per second.\n\nAs an aside, my invention\n\nof parallel processing\n\nthat occurred on the Fourth of July 1989\n\ninspired Steve Jobs\n\nto use four processors\n\nthat processed in parallel\n\nto also attain a speed of 3.1 billion\n\ncalculations per second\n\nand record that speed\n\nin his first Apple personal supercomputers,\n\ncalled the Power Mac G4.\n\nSteve Jobs introduced\n\nhis personal supercomputer\n\nat the Seybold conference\n\nthat took place in San Francisco\n\non August 31, 1999.\n\nLike the modern supercomputer,\n\nthe fastest speed in your computer\n\nare coming from parallel processing.\n\nThe new supercomputer knowledge\n\nthat made the news headlines\n\nwas that I—Philip Emeagwali—had invented\n\nhow to massively parallel process\n\nand that I invented the technology\n\nthat drives the modern supercomputer\n\nand invented the technology\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nand invented the technology\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States.\n\nI invented\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\ntechnology\n\nto enable me to solve\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in extreme-scale algebra.\n\nSuch mathematical physics problems arise\n\nwhen trying to discover and recover\n\ncrude oil and natural gas\n\nand do so from the Niger-Delta oilfields\n\nof my country of birth, Nigeria.\n\nMy quest for the new algebra\n\nthat is my contribution to algebra\n\nbegan with the arithmetic times table\n\nthat I memorized in 1960\n\nin first grade\n\nat Saint Patrick’s Primary School, Sapele,\n\nin the then Western Region\n\nof the then British West African colony\n\nof Nigeria.\n\nThat times table\n\nwent to only twelve times twelve.\n\nThat times table\n\nwas near the beginning of knowledge\n\nof arithmetic.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—mathematically invented\n\nhow to massively parallel process\n\narithmetic times tables\n\nand parallel process them across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of processors.\n\nI invented\n\nnew algorithms, or new instructions,\n\nthat told each processor\n\nwhat to compute within itself\n\nand what to communicate to its up to sixteen nearest-neighboring processors.\n\nSince the first programmable supercomputer was invented in 1946,\n\neach supercomputer manufactured\n\nwas faithful to its primary mission, namely, to solve the most extreme-scale problems\n\narising in computational physics\n\nand to increase productivity,\n\nreduce time-to-solution,\n\nand reduce time-to-market.\n\nSupercomputing is mathematics-intensive.\n\nFor that reason,\n\nmost supercomputer scientists are, in part, research computational mathematicians.\n\nIn supercomputing\n\nand in computational physics, to discover\n\nis to make the impossible-to-solve\n\npossible-to-solve.\n\nThe first person, or the discoverer,\n\nmakes the impossible possible,\n\nand thereafter, everybody knows that\n\nparallel processing\n\nis no longer a waste of everybody’s time.\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—was credited\n\nfor making the invention\n\nof massively parallel processing,\n\nthe technology that makes supercomputers\n\nfastest.\n\nI invented\n\nparallel processing\n\nwhen the supercomputer technology\n\nwas scorned, ridiculed, and rejected\n\nby the likes of Steve Jobs.\n\nI invented\n\nparallel processing\n\nwhen the supercomputer technology\n\nwas presumed\n\nto be untestable and even wrong.\n\nMy discovery\n\nthat the impossible-to-solve\n\narising in extreme-scale\n\nalgebraic computations\n\nis possible-to-solve\n\nacross a new internet\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nand a new computer\n\nwas recorded in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA Black Mathematician and His Contributions to Mathematics\n\nA Black Mathematician and His Contributions to

https://SoundCloud.com/emeagwali\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe Problems Narrative Identity\n\nI’m Philip Emeagwali.\n\nThe nine partial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\n—called Emeagwali’s equations—\n\nbegan as the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics.\n\nI encoded that Second Law of Motion\n\ninto eighty-one (81) partial derivative terms\n\nof Emeagwali’s system of equations\n\nthat governs the multiphase flow\n\nof crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nthat was flowing a mile-deep\n\nand across a production oilfield,\n\nsuch as the Oloibiri Oilfield\n\nof Nigeria\n\nthat was the first oilfield discovered\n\nin West Africa\n\nand discovered in 1956.\n\nAs a research computational mathematician,\n\nI insisted that\n\nthe petroleum reservoir simulator\n\nmust obey the laws of physics\n\nat all times and simulations.\n\nMy contributions\n\nto mathematical knowledge\n\ninclude the mathematical discovery\n\nthat the system of nine\n\ncoupled, non-linear, time-dependent, and state-of-the-art partial differential equations\n\nin the calculus textbooks\n\nof the petroleum industry\n\nwere not equating to the reality\n\nwithin the oilfield\n\nthe partial differential equations represent.\n\nFor that reason, I invented\n\nthe nine Emeagwali’s equations\n\nthat contained thirty-six [36]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nthat equated\n\nwith the four physical forces\n\nthat exists\n\nwithin all production oilfields.\n\nAlong those lines, I also had to invent\n\nnine finite difference algebraic algorithms\n\nthat were not constrained\n\nby in inverted commas “dependency”\n\nand constrained\n\nwhen executing across\n\nmy new internet\n\nthat was outlined by an ensemble of\n\n65,536 commodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat were identical\n\nand that were equal distances\n\napart.\n\nA necessary condition\n\nto making my experimental discovery\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989\n\nwas that I simultaneously send\n\nemail messages\n\nto all 65,536 processors\n\non my new internet\n\nand that I synchronously receive\n\nmy email replies\n\nfrom all 65,536 processors.\n\nThat massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer invention\n\ntook a narrative identity all its own, namely,\n\nI—the storyteller—became the story\n\nand the subject of school reports.\n\nMy Contributions to Algebra\n\nNine in ten supercomputer cycles\n\nare executed\n\nwhile solving extreme-scaled\n\nsystems of equations\n\nof algebra.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day,\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to finesse my\n\n64 binary thousand identical\n\nand commodity processors\n\nto email each other\n\nand to work together\n\nto reduce the time-to-solution\n\nof extreme-scale systems of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nand to reduce that time-to-solution\n\nfrom 65,536 days, or 180 years,\n\non one processor\n\nto just one day across\n\nan ensemble of 65,536 processors.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to compute quickly and accurately\n\nand how to make the impossible-to-solve\n\nsystems of equations\n\nof extreme-scale algebra\n\npossible-to-solve\n\nand how to use that new knowledge\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nextreme-scaled problems\n\nin algebra\n\nand doing so to build digital replicas\n\nof petroleum reservoirs\n\nand the Earth’s climate.\n\nI invented a new supercomputer\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way the internet does\n\nand that could be used to solve\n\nnever-before-solved problems\n\nin algebra.\n\nThat new supercomputer\n\nenables the computational mathematician\n\nand computational physicist\n\nto answer previously unanswerable questions\n\nin extreme-scale algebra\n\nthat is the recurring decimal\n\nin their grand challenge problems.\n\nBy definition, algebra\n\nis the generalization of arithmetic.\n\nIn high school algebra,\n\ntwo letters represent two numbers.\n\nIn the supercomputer algebra\n\nthat arises from\n\ntrying to discover and recover\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas,\n\none trillion letters must represent\n\none trillion numbers\n\narising from a system of\n\none trillion equations\n\nof algebra.\n\nThose one trillion equations\n\nare evenly distributed across\n\nmillions of processors\n\nthat, in turn, solves the trillion equations\n\nin parallel,\n\nor solves them\n\nby computing one million calculations\n\nat once.\n\nIn modern supercomputing,\n\nparallel processing\n\nis the disruptive technology\n\nthat displaced sequential processing,\n\na technology that established itself\n\nfor half a century.\n\nBetween sequential processing\n\nthat was experimentally invented\n\nin 1946,\n\nand parallel processing\n\nthat I experimentally invented\n\nin 1989,\n\nwas vector processing\n\nthat was the sustaining technology\n\nthat yielded incremental gains\n\nin the supercomputer speeds\n\nof the 1970s and ‘80s.\n\nMy world’s fastest\n\nsupercomputer algebraic calculations\n\nmade the news headlines\n\nand were highlighted\n\nin the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA week later,\n\nthe computer and information technology writer, Judith Axler Turner,\n\nwrote in the June 27, 1990 issue\n\nof The Chronicle of Higher Education\n\nthat I\n\n[quote]\n\n“took on an enormously difficult problem…\n\nsolved it alone,\n\nhas won computation’s top prize,\n\ncaptured in the past\n\nonly by seasoned research teams.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nI was in the news\n\nin 1989\n\nbecause I experimentally discovered\n\nhow to reduce the performance abyss\n\nbetween the sequential\n\nor the vector processing supercomputer\n\nand the massively parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nI did not experimentally discover\n\nparallel processing\n\nby merely tweaking\n\nsequential processing codes.\n\nI discovered\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\nfrom first principles,\n\nor from the laws of physics,\n\nand from the partial differential equations\n\nof calculus\n\nthat encoded those laws,\n\nand from the partial difference equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat approximated\n\nthose partial differential equations.\n\nAlgebra\n\nis the way the supercomputer\n\nexperience calculus.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nparallel processing\n\nby going back to the laws of physics\n\nthat were encoded into the system of\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat, in turn, were discretized\n\nto yield trillions upon trillions\n\nof a system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat I had to solve in parallel.\n\nMy Contributions to Computational Mathematics\n\nMy contributions\n\nto computational mathematics\n\nare these:\n\nI mathematically and experimentally discovered\n\nhow to compute and solve\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nthat were previously impossible-to-solve.\n\nI discovered\n\nhow to execute excruciatingly-detailed petroleum reservoir simulations.\n\nSuch extreme-scale simulations, in turn,\n\nenable petroleum engineers\n\nto discover and recover\n\notherwise elusive crude oil and natural gas.\n\nI discovered\n\nhow to foresee otherwise unforeseeable global warming\n\nand how to do so\n\nby executing\n\nextreme-scale general circulation models\n\nand executing them\n\nat a never before-seen-resolution\n\nand executing them\n\nacross\n\nmy ensemble of processors\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nand that is a new supercomputer de facto\n\nbut that is not a computer per se.\n\nThe modern parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis not the sequential processing computer\n\nof the old sense\n\nand of the 1980s and earlier.\n\nEach modern parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis defined by the configuration\n\nof the ensemble of processors\n\nthat outlined it.\n\nI invented a new configuration of processors that defined a never-before-seen supercomputer\n\nthat I named the Cosmic Supercomputer\n\nand that outlined a never-before-seen internet\n\nthat I described\n\nas a HyperBall global network of processors\n\nthat is described by the book\n\n“History of the Internet”\n\nand described as a small copy\n\nof the Internet\n\nand described as the contribution\n\nof Philip Emeagwali\n\nto the invention of the internet.\n\nMy knowledge and experience\n\nwith the supercomputer\n\nbegan on June 20, 1974\n\nat a Computer Center\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon, United States.\n\nThe computer has changed\n\nsince it was invented in 1946\n\nand invented\n\nas automatic, programmable,\n\nand processing sequentially.\n\nBut the way we define the computer\n\nhas not changed.\n\nIn 1946 and now, we still define\n\nthe computer\n\nas the tool that enables a person\n\nto execute the fastest computations.\n\nBack in 1974, the prevailing dogma\n\nin supercomputing\n\nwas that parallel processing\n\nwill forever remain a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nThe paradigm shift\n\nfrom serial computing to parallel computing\n\noccurred in 1989.\n\nThere were three reasons\n\nI couldn’t make my 1989\n\nexperimental discovery\n\nof parallel processing\n\nin 1974.\n\nFirst, I didn’t have, in 1974,\n\nthe intellectual maturity\n\n—across computational physics,\n\nacross abstract calculus,\n\nacross large-scale algebraic computations,\n\nacross extreme-scale floating-point arithmetical computations,\n\nand across\n\nmessage-passing communication.\n\nI acquired that intellectual maturity\n\nduring the next sixteen years,\n\nonward of March 25, 1974,\n\nof fulltime study\n\nand supercomputer research.\n\nThe second reason I couldn’t discover parallel processing\n\nin 1974\n\nwas that I didn’t have\n\na global network of\n\n64 binary thousand processors\n\nthat I needed\n\nto use re-confirm\n\nmy theoretical discovery\n\nof parallel processing.\n\nI can only experimentally re-confirm\n\nmy theoretical discovery across\n\nthose 65,536 processors.\n\nThe third reason I couldn’t discover\n\nparallel processing\n\nin 1974\n\nwas that the fields of calculus, computing, and email communication\n\n—grew enough to enable me\n\nto do my experiments\n\nand do it across\n\na small copy of the internet\n\nthat’s a global network of\n\n64 binary thousand processors.\n\nBut, more importantly,\n\nmy original inspiration\n\nwas to discover a new technology\n\n—namely, a small copy of the Internet\n\nthat emulates a new supercomputer.\n\nThat new technology\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nis a new instrument\n\nof extreme-scale computational physics\n\nthat’s indispensable\n\nin the quest for crude oil and natural gas;\n\nthat’s indispensable\n\nin foreseeing otherwise unforeseeable\n\nglobal warming;\n\nand that’s indispensable\n\nin vast and sundry problems\n\nin extreme-scale computational physics.\n\nThat the fastest supercomputer\n\ncost as much as the budget of a small nation is a measure of its wide applications\n\nacross the sciences and society.\n\nParallel processing\n\nis the technological engine\n\nthat powers both the slowest computer\n\nand the fastest supercomputer.\n\nMy discovery\n\nof practical parallel processing\n\nearned me the highest prize\n\nin supercomputing\n\nmade the news headlines\n\nin 1989\n\nand was newsworthy because\n\nit opened up the new fields\n\nof seeking parallel solutions\n\nof initial-boundary value problems\n\nthat occurs\n\nfrom mathematics to medicine,\n\nfrom biology to chemistry,\n\nand from astronomy to physics.\n\nWhen you’re inventing something\n\nthat thing is yours.\n\nWhen you’ve invented that thing,\n\nyou give that thing to posterity\n\nand that thing is no longer yours.\n\nFor instance, my experimental discovery\n\nof the massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nwas the cover story\n\nof technical publications\n\nsuch as the May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News,\n\nof the Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis the flagship bi-monthly news journal\n\nof record\n\nof the research mathematics community\n\nthat is half a million mathematicians\n\nstrong.\n\nComplex Calculus and Large-Scale Algebra\n\nAt the Christ the King College,\n\nOnitsha, of the then East Central State\n\nof Nigeria, of 1970,\n\nI was the rising star\n\nin physics and calculus.\n\nFor that reason, everybody\n\nat Christ the King College,\n\nOnitsha,\n\ncalled me “Calculus,” rather than “Philip.”\n\nAt Christ the King College, Onitsha,\n\nmy physics textbook was titled:\n\n“Advanced Level Physics.”\n\nThat physics textbook was co-authored by\n\nMichael Nelkon and Philip Parker.\n\nThose that knew me by the name “Calculus”\n\nat Christ the King College, Onitsha, Nigeria, were not surprised\n\nthat I won a scholarship\n\nthat was dated September 10, 1973.\n\nThat scholarship\n\nmade it possible for me to arrive\n\nin the United States\n\non Sunday March 24, 1974.\n\nI spent my first night\n\nin the United States alone.\n\nI spent that first night\n\nin 36 Butler Hall,\n\nMonmouth, Oregon.\n\nAn earlier turning point for me\n\n—as a mathematician—was in June 1970\n\nat age 15\n\ninside a bookstore\n\nnear Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha, East Central State, Nigeria.\n\nThe bookstore was a short distance\n\nfrom Zik’s Roundabout, Onitsha.\n\nInside that bookstore,\n\nI paid the then unheard of\n\none pound and five shillings\n\nfor a 568-page blue hardbound book\n\nthat was titled:\n\n“An Introduction\n\nto the Infinitesimal Calculus.”\n\nThe calculus book was subtitled\n\n“With Applications to Mechanics\n\nand Physics.”\n\nThe calculus book was written by\n\nG.W. [George William] Caunt\n\nand published by Oxford University Press.\n\nThe frontier of knowledge\n\nof physics, calculus, and algebra\n\nare the intellectual swords\n\nthat I used in my supercomputer quest\n\nfor the then uncharted territory\n\nnow known as the\n\nmassively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer.\n\nThat terra incognita of knowledge\n\nis where the fastest supercomputer exists\n\nand where I discovered\n\nhow to harness\n\nmy ensemble of processors\n\nas the building blocks\n\nof a new supercomputer.\n\nThat new supercomputer\n\nis the precursor\n\nto the modern parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nI discovered\n\nhow to harness those processors\n\nto solve extreme-scale problems\n\nin algebra\n\nthat arose in computational physics.\n\nI was the first person\n\nto witness the world’s fastest\n\nalgebraic computation\n\nthat occurred across a new internet\n\nthat was a global network of\n\n65,536 processors.\n\nI witnessed that fastest\n\nalgebraic computations\n\nat 10:15 in the morning\n\nWashington, D.C. Time\n\nTuesday Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nrepresents a new paradigm\n\nin the history of algebra.\n\nAt first, I couldn’t believe\n\nmy fastest algebraic computations\n\nand I believed that I had made a mistake\n\nin the way I operated\n\nthe internal timer\n\nthat I used to time the speed\n\nof my new supercomputer.\n\nEverybody said\n\nI had made an embarrassing mistake\n\nbut everybody\n\nwas embarrassingly mistaken.\n\nAt my mathematical core,\n\nI’m also an extreme-scale algebraist.\n\nIt made the news headlines\n\nin 1989\n\nthat I—Philip Emeagwali—discovered\n\nhow to solve the largest system\n\nof linear equations of algebra\n\nand how to solve them\n\nat the fastest speeds\n\nbut with the slowest processors.\n\nWhat I contributed\n\nto extreme-scale, fast\n\ncomputational mathematics\n\nwas the cover story\n\nof top publications in mathematics.\n\nI discovered\n\nhow to reduce the toughest problems\n\nin calculus\n\nto their acceptable approximations\n\nin algebra.\n\nI discovered those algebraic approximations\n\nas the most extreme-scale problems\n\nin computational algebra.\n\nThat mathematical discovery\n\nled me to the most computation-intensive problems in floating-point arithmetic\n\nthat I could only solve, by first,\n\ndiscovering\n\nhow to massively parallel process\n\nand how to do so across\n\nmy small copy of the Internet\n\nthat’s a global network of\n\n64 binary thousand processors.\n\nLet’s put my mathematical discovery\n\nin historical perspective.\n\nThe quadratic equation\n\nof your high school algebra\n\nhad one unknown and two solutions,\n\njust as the quadratic equation\n\nx squared equals nine\n\nhas the two solutions\n\nminus three and plus three.\n\nAnd your high school, small-scale\n\nalgebra textbooks\n\ndidn’t go beyond a system of\n\nthree equations\n\nthat had to be manually solved\n\nfor three unknowns.\n\nBut today, I’m wondering\n\nhow can I massively parallel compute\n\na system of a million billion trillion\n\nequations of algebra\n\nand do so\n\nto compute at the fastest speeds\n\nfor answers that comprise of knowing\n\na million billion trillion unknowns.\n\nThat’s impossible to scribble\n\nacross all the blackboards in the world.\n\nThat’s impossible to store\n\nwithin one motherboard.\n\nI discovered that massively\n\nparallel supercomputing\n\nmay make it possible to someday solve for\n\na million billion trillion unknowns\n\nand, help discover and recover\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nMore than half of the crude oil and natural gas discovered\n\nin Nigeria\n\nare unrecoverable.\n\nAround the world, thousands of oilfields\n\nhave been abandoned\n\nbecause more than half of the crude oil and natural gas\n\nare unrecoverable.\n\nThe Oloibiri oilfield,\n\nof the Niger-Delta region,\n\nwas Nigeria’s first oil field.\n\nThe Oloibiri oilfield\n\nwas discovered in 1958.\n\nThe Oloibiri oilfield\n\nwas abandoned in 1978.\n\nThe Oloibiri oilfield\n\nwas abandoned twenty years\n\nafter it was discovered.\n\nThe Oloibiri oilfield\n\nwas abandoned with about 70 percent\n\nof its crude oil and natural gas\n\ndeemed unrecoverable.\n\nMy application of extreme-scale algebra\n\nin extreme-scale, multi physics scenarios\n\nof petroleum reservoir simulation\n\nis the most important application\n\nof algebra in Nigeria.\n\nAlgebra\n\nis an instrument of poverty alleviation.\n\nOn Being a Non-Conformist\n\nIn the early 1990s, I gave lecture tours\n\nacross the United States\n\nthat sparked new interest\n\nin massively parallel processing supercomputers.\n\nMy parallel supercomputing lectures\n\nwere co-sponsored by\n\nthe Association for Computer Machinery\n\nthat was the premier society\n\nfor computer professionals.\n\nMy parallel supercomputing lectures\n\nwere co-sponsored by\n\nThe Computer Society of the IEEE\n\nthat was the largest society\n\nfor computer professionals.\n\nAlthough I gave 90-minute lectures\n\nin the early 1990s,\n\nI must say that my experimental discovery\n\nof how parallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand how massively parallel processing makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\ncannot be passed along\n\nin a 90-minute lecture.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\ntook me fifteen years,\n\nonward of June 20, 1974,\n\nto discover.\n\nTherefore, it should also take you\n\nfifteen years\n\nto re-discover\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat took me fifteen years\n\nto discover.\n\nIt’s often said that\n\nit takes ten thousand [10,000] hours\n\nto become the best athlete,\n\nto become a professional soccer player,\n\nor to become a tennis professional.\n\nI put in two hundred thousand\n\n[200,000] hours\n\nto experimentally discover\n\nhow and why massively parallel processing\n\nacross a new internet\n\nmakes the supercomputer super.\n\nAny person that did not\n\nput in two hundred thousand\n\n[200,000] hours\n\ncannot explain how I invented\n\nthe modern parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nFor me, Philip Emeagwali,\n\nthe 1970s and ‘80s\n\nwere the decades of darkness.\n\nIn those decades,\n\nmathematicians ridiculed me by saying: “This will not work!”\n\nLooking back, those rejections paved the way for me to work alone.\n\nIt was important that I pursued\n\nonly my own scientific vision.\n\nTwo bad visions\n\nare not better than\n\none good vision.\n\nTwo heads with two visions\n\nare not better than\n\none head with one vision,\n\nunless both heads pursue\n\nonly one vision.\n\nPut differently, democracy rarely works\n\nin the quest for new scientific knowledge.\n\nAs the inventor, I alone\n\nknow the origin story of my invention.\n\nI know how I want to express my story.\n\nI don’t care\n\nif my expression\n\nconforms to how others expect me\n\nto express it.\n\nNobody should be afraid to be who she is.\n\nParallel Processing Was Mocked\n\nIn the United States and Europe,\n\nand in the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nthe leaders of thought\n\nin the world of supercomputing—namely, Gene Amdahl\n\nwho advocated sequential processing\n\nsupercomputing\n\nand Seymour Cray\n\nwho advocated vector processing\n\nsupercomputing—\n\nhad the wrong visions\n\nfor the future of the supercomputer\n\nthat will be parallel processing\n\nand doin"
