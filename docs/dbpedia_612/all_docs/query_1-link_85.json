        "text": "By Mike Ozekhome\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe last instalment of this series started off with the spectacular failure of former President Muhammadu Buhari, and moved on to lament about the disappearance of our societal values; continued with how Nigeria has borrowed her future, pays for darkness and concluded with the tragedy of the desertion and relocation of industries. This episode starts by posing the question: whether we have always been doomed? It is answered in the negative by recalling notable achievements by some eminent Nigerians. It moves on to a discussion of Nigeria as a failed State, illustrating it as a place where insecurity reigns supreme. Enjoy.\n\nHAVE WE ALWAYS BEEN DOOMED? NO!\n\nNOTABLE ACHIEVMENTS BY NIGERIANS\n\nBritish Nobel laureate Dorothy Hodgkin once notes that the University of Lagos was one of the world centres of expertise in her specialist field of chemical crystallography. Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, had the first world class computer centre in Africa. The University of Ife had a notable pool of expertise in nuclear physics. Our premier University of Ibadan had an international reputation as a leading centre of excellence in tropical medicine, development economics and historical sciences. The Saudi Royal family used to frequent UCH for medical treatment in the sixties. The engineering scientist Ayodele Awojobi, a graduate of ABU Zaria, was a rather troubled genius. He tragically dies of frustration because our environment could not contain, let alone utilize his talents. Ishaya Shuaibu Audu, pioneer Nigeria Vice-Chancellor of ABU Zaria, collected all the prizes at St. Mary’s University Medical School London. His successor in Zaria, Iya Abubakar, was a highly talented Cambridge mathematician who became a professor at 28 and was a notable consultant to NASA. Alexander Animalu was a gifted MIT physicist who did work of original importance in superconductivity. His book, intermediate Quantum Theory of Crystalline Solids, has been translated into several languages, including Russians.\n\nRenowned Mathematician Chike Obi solved Fermat’s 200-year old conjecture with pencil and paper while the Cambridge Mathematician John Wiles achieved same with the help of a computer working over a decade. After the harsh environment of the 1980s IMF/WB structural adjustment programmes, the Babangida military dictatorship undertook massive budgetary cutbacks in higher education.\n\nOur brightest and best fled abroad. Today, Nigerian doctors, scientists and engineers are making massive contributions in Europe and North America. Prof Philip Emeagwali won the 1989 Gordon Bell Award for his work in super-computing. Jelani Aliyu designed the first electric car for American automobile giant General Motors. Olufunmilayo Olopede, Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago, won a McAurthur Genius Award for her work on cancer. Winston Soboyejo, who earned a Cambridge doctorate at 23, is a Princeton engineering professors laurelled for his contributions to materials research. He is Chairman of the scientific Advisory Board to the Secretary-General of the UN. Washington University biomedical engineering professor Samuel Achilefu received the St. Louis Award for his invention of cancer-seeing glasses that is a major advance in radiology.\n\nKunle Olukotun of Stanford did work of original importance on multi-processors. National Merit laureate Omowunmi Sadik of State University of Binghamton owns patents for biosensors technology. Young Nigerians are also recording stellar performances at home and abroad. A Nigerian family, the Imafidons, was voted “the smartest family in Britain” in 2015. Anne Marie Imafidon earned her Oxford Masters’ in Mathematics and Computer Science when she was only 19. Today, she sits on several corporate boards and was awarded an MBE in 2017 for services to science. Recently, Benue State University mathematician Atovigba Michael Vershima is believed to have solved the two centuries old Riemann Conjecture that has defied giants such as Gauss, Minkowski and Polya.\n\nAnother young man, Hallowed Olaoluwa, was one of a dozen “future Einstein” awarded postdoctoral fellowship by Harvard University. He completed a remarkable doctorate in mathematical physics at the University of Lagos age 21. While at Harvard he aims to focus on solving problems relating to “quantum ergodicity and quantum chaos”, with applications to medical imaging and robotics. Another Unilag alumnus, Ayodele Dada, graduated with a perfect 5.0 GPA, an unprecedented feat in a Nigerian University. Victor Olalusi recently graduated with such stellar performance at the Russian Medical Research University, Moscow, and was feted the best graduate throughout the Russian Federation. Habiba Daggash, daughter of my friend Senator Sanusi Daggash recently graduated with starred rust in Engineering at Oxford University.\n\nEmmanuel Ohuabunwa earned a CPA of 3.98 out of a possible 4.0 as the best overall graduate of the Ivy-League Johns Hopkins University. Stewart Hendry, Johns Hopkins Professor of Neuroscience, described the young man as having “an intellect so rare that it touches on the unique…a personality that is once-in-a-life-time”.\n\nThere is also young Yemi Adesokan, postdoctoral fellow of Harvard Medical School who patented procedures for tracking spread of viral epidemics in developing countries. Ufot Ekong recently solved a 50-year mathematical riddle at Tokai – University in Japan and was voted the most outstanding graduate of the institution. He currently works as an engineer for Nissan, having pocketed two patent in his discipline. This is only the tip of the iceberg. If our system were not so inclement to talent, we would be celebrating a bountiful harvest of geniuses in all the fields of human endeavour. This is why the correlates between our gene-pool and national development are so diametrically opposed. Unfortunately, the success stories are the exception rather than the rule. This is because, we are becoming a failed state.\n\nNIGERIA AS A FAILED STATE\n\nHas Nigeria really become a failed State? What is a failed state, anyway? A failed state is one whose political or economic fabric has become so weak that the government loses control. In such a state, basic responsibilities of government that make the state sovereign are absent, as they no longer function properly. Such a state is so fragile that it can collapse anytime, because it becomes incapable of exercising authority over its peoples and territory, nor protect its national boundaries. Such a state merely provides minimal public services, since it lacks organizational and administrative capacity to control its people, territory and resources. Suffering from crumbling infrastructures, poor utility, educational and health facilities, a failed state loses legitimacy both in the eyes of its citizens and the comity of Nations. State institutions collapse; control over internal security deteriorates. Indeed, such a state is divested of a monopoly of the legitimate use of violence; whilst it loses capacity to protect its citizens, fundamental rights, and defend civil, political and economic rights of its populace. It manifests in lack of observance of rule of law.\n\nMost failed states are in Africa; a handful in the Middle East and Asia. An example of a failed state at some point in time was Somalia (now one of the fastest developing nations in Africa), when rival warlords ravaged the land. Another is Afghanistan, which harboured the deadly terrorist group, Al-Qaeda, under the Taliban. Thus, a failed state can be determined by all or some of the following indices: her weak economy, porous defence capability, lack of transparency and poverty-stricken workforce; high infant/maternal morbidity and mortality rate; high level of illiteracy; malnourishment, orphanage, child labour, congestion; where organized crime and black market control reign supreme; where a country is largely dependent on imported food; where it cannot respond to natural disasters; and where there is no clear order of business and commerce, with a weak currency dominating.\n\nIn the case of Nigeria, we punch miserably below our weight in the hierarchy of world economics and politics. None of our institutions come. near the top 500 in the World Universities League Table. An estimated 50% of our people live in extreme poverty, with Nigeria besting India Youth unemployment hovers around 45 percent (70% for the far North). The poverty is heartbreaking; our per capita GDP is less than $3,000 as compared to Singapore’s $55,252. We have the worst road carnage record in the world, with more than 20,000 lost to road accidents annually. We wasted over $18 billion on the power sector and our people still live in darkness. The state governments are virtually bankrupt.\n\nINSECURITY REIGNS SUPREME\n\nIn terms of security, Nigeria is becoming a killing field. The daily slaughter ritual in Nigeria that has turned the Nigerian geographical space into a killing field is not only criminal, but also smacks of total abdication of governance by the current government. It is most cruel, hideous, horrific, inhuman, dastardly and barbaric. The latest theatre of the absurd is Plateau state, where hundreds of innocent and helpless Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable (children, women and elderly), have been mindlessly hacked down in cold blood. Nigerians have become “walking corpses” or “the living dead” (apologies, AyiKwei Armah: “The Beautiful Ones Are not yet Born”). The government that appears overtly overwhelmed (if it ever cared at all), wrings its hands in utter helplessness and blames everything and any one, but itself. PMB says he can only pray to God for miracles. The Commander-in-Chief (C-in–C) in saying this, breaks the heart and freely donates to the citizens, helplessness and hopelessness. What is the military there for, since the Police has been overrun? Sections 130 (2) and 215 (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as altered, make the President the C-in-C of both the Armed Forces and the Police. Never before, or after the three year bloody Nigerian fratricidal civil war has Nigeria witnessed such barefaced butchery of innocent souls in a most horrendous manner that portends ethnic cleansing and genocidal tendencies.\n\nThe entire security architecture of Nigeria has been greatly compromised and doctored. The Nigerian Constitution (section 14 (2) (b), makes the welfare and security of lives and property the primary purpose of government. Any government that cannot protect its citizens is not worth being called a government by any description or appellation. We have become a laughing stock before international circles. We make merriment and hold political rallies on the cold graves of hot steaming blood of innocent Nigerians. We wanted to win the world cup at all cost, amidst vengeful slaughter of fellow Nigerians. But, God is a just and righteous God. He does not tolerate injustice, wickedness. He does not condone unearned adulation and hero-worshipping: The Bible: Job 34:12; Col 3:25; Deut 10:18; 32:4; Isaiah 30:18. The Holy Quran: 5:8; 16:90; 59: 22-24. Die hard politicians are already busy, politicking about 2019, while our citizens are daily massacred in cold blood. A governor that is supposed to be the Chief Security Officer of his state is nothing but a mere toothless crying bulldog, having been stripped of such luxury of controlling powers by sections 215 (4) of the Constitution. This section enthrones a behemoth, elephantine and immobile Police Force at the center, with the governor at the mercy of the IGP and president. That is why I have, over the years, consistently and persistently clamoured for true fiscal federalism that allows for state Police and community policing. From Agatu, Naka and Agasha in Benue state, Demsa, Suwa and Burukulu in Adamawa State, Riyom, Barkin Ladi and Jos in Plateau state, to BirninGwari, Dangaji, Unguwar Gajere in Kaduna State; from Izza, Wudula, Blakule and Darajimal in Borno State; to Takum, Shaakaa, Donga and Ntule in Taraba State; to Maraban –Udege Village, Aisa and Aguma in Nassarawa State; from Ugbona, Okpella, Odiguetue and Igiode in Edo State, Nigeria knows no peace. Things have fallen apart. The falcon can no longer hear the falconer.\n\nTo be continued…\n\nTHOUGHT FOR WEEK\n\n“As a nation, we will only become the shining light to the world with the emergence of more and more role models worthy of emulation by all” – Fela Durotoye\n\nBy Mike Ozekhome\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the last two parts of this treatise, we started by taking a look at the meaning of vanity of life and the ephemerality of power taking a leap from historical sketches and nuggets. Later we explored power generally and man’s dominion over it, political power, the abuse of power – noting the ephemerality of life itself. We also posed the question: ‘what is power?’. And then observed that God is the supreme power Who controls men of power, today, we shall continue and conclude with nothing lasts forever. Read on.\n\nNOTHING LASTS FOREVER\n\nNothing lasts forever, even this life is vanity upon vanity. [Ecclesiastes 1:2 – 8 KJV]. In William Shakespeare’s epic in Macbeth, Macbeth himself tells, “Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” (Act V, Scene V).\n\nBut let us not forget the seriousness of this topic; for beneath the veneer of my foregoing satire lies my profound examination of the fleeting nature of power. In a country brimming with sundry potentials, how do we navigate the tumultuous waters of leadership? How do we separate the genuine statesmen from the artificial temporary showmen? And what does it mean for a nation like Nigeria when ephemeral power eventually slips through the hands of those entrusted with its stewardship?\n\nPower to these sit-tight leaders is like opium; it intoxicates; power is an aphrodisiac; an intoxicating liquor. It bemuses. It gives one the delusional ‘Dutch courage’. It can either make or mar the holder. It forces reason to vacate its seat. It is not certain – but – evanescent, fleeting, transitory, volatile and short-lived.\n\nWe must note that the intoxicating liquor of power can be a double-edged sword, corrupting even the noblest of intentions. Abuse of power occurs when public office holders who succumb to their baser instincts, using their positions for personal gain, and turning a blind eye to the needs and aspirations of the people they are meant to serve. Brutus, mulling his fears over Caesar’s rise to power and the stringent calls to crown him, soliloquized: “The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power” (Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, Act II Scene I). He feared that though he had not known Caesar to be unreasonable, power may change him. So, for the common good, Caesar must die. What is therefore easily forgotten is the ‘EPHEMERALITY OF POWER’ and the temporary positions that the wielders hold. Nothing in life is permanent except for the word of God almighty Himself, which endures forever (Peter 1:25). What we ask again, and again is this: Leaders, what do you want to be remembered for when you leave power? For certainly you must leave someday. If not today, surely tomorrow; but certainly, you must.\n\nEPHEMERALITY AND VANITY- ANY CONNECTION?\n\nThe connect between ephemerality and vanity is apparent, if not obvious: they are all but mirror-images of each other. What is vain, is at least partly so because it is ephemeral; what is ephemeral, (in the sense in which it is discussed here), is, by definition (at least, according to both the Bible and the Quran) vanity. All of it, including power and life itself. Everything is transient – almost illusory and like a mirage or a vapour: it is here today, and by tomorrow, it is gone. This dovetails neatly into the pomp, pageantry and excessive mourning which (culturally and as individuals) attend the passage or transition (death) of our loved ones. The sheer folly and mindlessness of such banal practices and traditions is best is best captured in this pith by an unknown author:\n\n“Burials do not befit the dead. They’re dead and unaware what befits them or not. “Befitting burials” are bragging points for the living. The dead do not care. Love your loved ones while they’re here, make sacrifices for them. Give them gifts. Speak words of affirmation to them. Do acts of service for them. Touch them, hug them, kiss them, and spend time with them. Laugh and smile with them, enjoy them. Don’t save your accolades for the pages of their burial programs. The dead won’t read it. Say what you need to say now, to the ones you love who are alive. Befitting burials are for the living, not the dead. The dead do not know, the dead do not care. Go home and help the living live better!”\n\nUNKNOWN\n\nThat is not all. Our literature is replete with innumerable musings on the subject of death and our reaction to it. A few are selected below: (https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/talkabout/articles/nine-famous-death-quotes-i-joyfully-await-the-exit-and-i-hope-never-to-return/281841)\n\n“Analysis of death is not for the sake of becoming fearful but to appreciate this precious lifetime.” – Dalai Lama\n\n“I have now decided that my death should be very precious. I really want to use it. I’d like my death to be as interesting as my life has been, and will be.” – David Bowie, Playboy Magazine interview, 1976.\n\n“It’s part of the privilege of being human that we have our moment when we have to say goodbye.” – Patti Smith.\n\n“The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.” – Harriet Beecher Stowe.\n\n“In the midst of death, life persists. In the midst of untruth, truth persists. In the midst of darkness, light persists.” – Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n“Though lovers be lost, love shall not.” – Dylan Thomas.\n\n“In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life.” – Marilyn Monroe.\n\n“When you wake up from death, you will find yourself in my arms…” – Richard Brautigan.\n\n“I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return” – Frida Kahlo\n\n“I’m not afraid of death; I just don’t want to be there when it happens.” – Woody Allen.\n\n“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.” – J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.\n\n“Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don’t know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.” – Anais Nin.\n\n“I’m the one that’s got to die when it’s time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to.” – Jimi Hendrix, The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Axis: Bold as Love.\n\n“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” – Mark Twain.\n\n“Death ends a life, not a relationship.” – Mitch Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie.\n\n“A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.” – Oscar Wilde\n\n“It is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die. That is true, it’s called Life.” – Terry Pratchett, The Last Continent.\n\n“I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” – Mark Twain.\n\n“I don’t want to die without any scars.” – Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n\n“It kills me sometimes, how people die.” – Markus Zusak, The Book Thief\n\n“Life is for the living. Death is for the dead. Let life be like music. And death, a note unsaid.” – Langston Hughes, The Collected Poems.\n\n“That was the thing. You never got used to it, the idea of someone being gone. Just when you think it’s reconciled, accepted, someone points it out to you, and it just hits you all over again, that shocking.” – Sarah Dessen, The Truth About Forever.\n\n“If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn’t be filled?” – Jodi Picoult, Nineteen Minutes.\n\n“Even death has a heart.” – Markus Zusak, The Book Thief\n\n“Don’t feel bad, I’m usually about to die.” – Rick Riordan, The Battle of the Labyrinth.\n\n“When people don’t express themselves, they die one piece at a time.” – Laurie Halse Anderson, Speak\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe ephemerality of life underscores its vanity. What is the point of it all when it will go up like smoke in next to no time? What shall it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul? Two questions which are opposite sides of the same coin. Suffice it to say that whether you believe in God, are an agnostic or a non-believer, the emptiness of many of our exertions, aspirations and attitudes, or of those connected to us (or even total strangers far removed from us by space and time) are stark reminders of the imperative of re-ordering our priorities and focusing on the things that really matter: substance as opposed to form; self-denial/self discipline as opposed to self-indulgence, conspicuous consumption and excess. None of us is here to live forever and we shall all make our exits sooner or later – perhaps sooner than we imagined. Death is inevitable. It stalks us all like our shadow, sticking to us wherever we go to. What matters is to live purposeful, impactful lives and leave worthy legacies that will inspire others – regardless of any notion of the hereafter and personal accountability to a Supreme Being. God, please, help us. Forgive our many sins. Look upon us with mercy. AMEN. (The end).\n\nTHOUGHT FOR THE WEEK\n\n“The vanity of human life is like a river, constantly passing away, and yet constantly coming on.” (Alexander Pope).\n\nBy Mike Ozekhome SAN\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the 1st part of this treatise, we set the tone by examining its meaning with the aid of historical sketches and nuggets. Today’s feature explores power generally and man’s dominion over it, political power, it’s abuse – noting the ephemerality of life itself. I pose the question: ‘what is power?’. I then observe that God controls men of power, concluding that nothing lasts forever. Enjoy\n\nPOWER AND MAN’S DOMINION\n\nPower is as old as the creation of the world. The first expression of power was by God – when he created the Heavens and the Earth. [Genesis 1 v. 1 – 2]. The Qur’an states that ‘Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them.’ [7:54].\n\nGod proceeded to create man in His own image and likeness when he said, ‘Let us create man in our image, to our likeness. Let them rule over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over the cattle, over the wild animals, and over all creeping things that crawl along the ground.’ [Genesis 1 v. 27]. This means that man looks like God and possesses the attributes of God – with absolute dominion [power] over all things created by God. Psalm 82 puts it poignantly: “I said, you are “gods”; you are all sons of the MOST HIGH”.\n\nPOLITICAL POWER AND ITS ABUSE\n\nIn the labyrinthine corridors of political power, a captivating dance of death unfolds- where the mighty ascend to the throne with the grandeur of illusion and tall promises, only to find themselves ensnared in the maze and quagmire of their own making. Such is the hypnotic and seductive tale of power and its ephemeral grip on those who wield it. In the Nigerian political landscape, this narrative has played out time and again, as public officeholders have succumbed to the allure of authority, often leading to the abuse, misuse and disuse of power.\n\nEdmund Burke was on target when he admonished that “the greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse”. The reason is that in the words of Paul Harris, “personality has power to uplift, power to depress, power to curse and power to bless.”\n\nLIFE ITSELF IS EPHEMERAL\n\nThe ephemeral nature of power, as highlighted in religious texts such as the Holy Bible and the Holy Quran, emphasizes the transient and fleeting nature of human existence and the potential pitfalls of wielding power in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary and unconscionable manner, without humility, righteousness and due regard to those at the receiving end.\n\nIn James 4:14 of the Bible, it is expressed that humans do not have control over what will happen in the future. Life is compared to a vapor that appears for a short time and then vanishes away. Hear James: “Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.” This metaphor conveys the brevity and fragility of human life. It also suggests that power, like life itself, is temporary and also dissipates rapidly. Similarly, the Quran, in verse 28:76, narrates the story of Korah, a person of power during the time of Moses. Korah abused his authority and tyrannized his people. He was granted immense wealth and treasures that “even their keys would burden a group of strong men”. So, his people advised him, “Do not be prideful. Surely, Allah does not like the prideful.” The supremacy of divine power surpasses the transience of mortal power. God stands as the ultimate force to be acknowledged, while humanity’s existence is temporary. As they say, “Soldier come, Soldier go, Barracks remain”.\n\nThe Legendary musical icon, Prince, once said passively that, “But life is just a party, and parties weren’t meant to last.”\n\nThe historical Chinese politician and poet, Li Shang-yin, also told us that, “And a moment that ought to have lasted for ever has come and gone before I knew.”\n\nThe much celebrated Indian author, Krishna Udayasankar, also echoed this, “No empire lasts forever, no dynasty continues unbroken. Someday, you and I will be mere legends. All that matters is whether we did what we could with the life that was given to us.”\n\nI once a read mesmerizing poem that is engraved in my everyday thought of action. It was a poem written by the highly celebrated English poet, Percy Shelly– “Ozymandias”. This was the first foremost metaphor for the ephemeral nature of power. It was written in a parlance – depicting a traveler telling the speaker a story about two vast legs of stone standing without a body, and near them, a massive, crumbling stone head lies ‘half sunk’ in the sand. The words on the statute read thus: “My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! But today, the statute is broken and even decayed, where is the self-acclaimed king?”.\n\nSame long-living Biblical figures still died anyway: Adam (930 years); Seth (912); Kenan (910); Noah (950) and Jared (962).\n\nEven Methuselah reputed to be the longest-lived human whose lifespan was recorded as 969 years in Gen 5:27, still kissed the dust. When man became swollen-headed and too sinful, God cut his age to a maximum of 120 years (Gen 6:3). This God’s ceiling of human lifespan is why the oldest ever recorded Guinness Book of Records human being is Branyas of Spain who lived for 113 years and 364 days.\n\nYET, GOD CONTROLS MEN WHO CONTROL POWER\n\nWith this observation, a compelling pattern emerges, a thought-provoking notion that everything, as if orchestrated by the hands of time, may eventually and inexorably reach its transient conclusion.\n\nThe terrific Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylonian, reigned for so many years. After his great fall, and having come to true repentance, acknowledged the unlimited and unending power and greatness of God, thus: ‘The matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever HE will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.’ [Daniel 4 – 1].\n\nSO, WHAT IS POWER?\n\nAn American writer – Robert Green, popular for writing international books on human nature, all power-related, was asked the meaning of power. This was his response: “Power is the measure of the degree of control you have over circumstances in your life and the actions of the people around you. It is a skill that is developed by a deep understanding of human nature, of what truly motivates people, and of the manipulations necessary for advancement and protection”.\n\nReturning to the nucleus of our riposte, let us embark on an expedition through the intriguing Nigerian terrain, shedding more light on the fleeting nature of assumed dominion bestowed upon the fortunate wielders of power.\n\nPicture this: Nigeria is a land of vast potentials and immense diversity, where power dynamics dance like fickle flames in the wind. It is a place where nondescript politicians rise to sudden prominence like shooting stars, captivating a tired nation with alluring promises of change, progress, and prosperity. In my Ozekpedia, I once called the “Politrictians” who practise “Politricks”. (See Nigerian “Politricks” and the Politrictians“ https://nigeriaofourdreams.wordpress.com/ November 4, 2014). But alas, as the old saying goes, “Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” In this case, it also evaporates like water in the Sahara. In 1655, King Louis XIV of France proudly stood in front of Parliament and imperiously declared, “L’etat C’est Moi” (meaning, “I am the State”. This was to accentuate his complete hold on power to the total exclusion of all other lesser mortals. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27%C3%89tat, _c%27est_moi, February 7, 2024).\n\nOh, how we have witnessed the Nigerian political stage transform into a theatre of comedy, tragedy and the absurd; an Odeon where the script is written by fate itself. We have seen leaders sprinting towards power, like Usain Bolt, fueled by sheer ambition and infatuation rhetoric, only to stumble and fall on banana peels of their own making. It is as if there is a cosmic prankster, ever delighting them in the ironic twists and turns of political fortune.\n\nEven an era of authoritarian rule or maximum dictatorship no longer guarantees a leader’s everlasting hold on power. While it may prolong their tyrannical reign, as seen in many cases, their grip must one day end. In history, we have seen long-lasting dictators like Nguema Mbasogo, Omar Bongo, Kim ll Sung, Muammar Gaddafi, Ali Khomeini, Sassuo Nguesso, Gnassingbe Eyadema, Paul Biya, Hun Sen, Yoweri Museveni, Omar Al-Bashir, Saddam Hussein, Haile Selassie and Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nDictators’ and rulers’ rule is inevitably bound to reach its end, sometimes through violent means, as witnessed in the fate of certain long-standing dictators. Even King Louis XIV who ruled the kingdom of France for 72 years, 3 months and 18 days, still bit the dust. Ditto Sobhuza II who ruled Swaziland for 82 years and 254 days, same with Min Hti of Arakan who ruled in the Kingdom of Arakan for 95 years. What about Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled the Kingdom of Egypt for 94 years? They all went the way of all mortals. They became mere dust. Furthermore, the limitations of human lifespan must be taken into account. An individual’s productive years typically fall within the 40 to 50-year range, following a normal distribution pattern known as the “Poisson” distribution. This implies that their most fruitful years span from ages 25 to 75, with the peak occurring between 35 and 65. Considering these factors, the window of power becomes remarkably narrow and encroaches upon the more enjoyable stages of life. Observing some politicians’ desperate and suicidal maneuvers to cling to power forever, one wonders if they harbor the illusion of immortality.\n\nNOTHING LASTS FOREVER\n\nNothing lasts forever, even this life is vanity upon vanity. [Ecclesiastes 1:2 – 8 KJV]. In William Shakespeare’s epic in Macbeth, Macbeth himself tells, “Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” (Act V, Scene V).\n\n(To be continued).\n\nTHOUGHT FOR THE WEEK\n\n“The vanity of human life is like a river, constantly passing away, and yet constantly coming on.” (Alexander Pope).\n\nBy Mike Ozekhome SAN\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI have written severally on the Ephemerality of Power, but never have I written on the correlation of the ephemerality of power and the vanity of life, which I now do. (See generally, “Magu: https://www.tell.ng/magu-the-ephemerality-of-power-mike-ozekhome-san/, dated July 8, 2020; https://penpushers.com.ng/nigerian-leaders-and-the-ephemerality-of-power/ProfMikeOzekhome, June 6, 2023). https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/603439-how-buharocracy-put-nigeria-in-throes-by-mike-ozekhome.html, June 9, 2023).\n\nPower. Life. Life and Power. One depends on the other. But, not necessarily the other way round. At least, not literally. Yes, you need life (as in, to be alive) to be in a position to exercise power. But, strangely, you can exercise power (not merely influence) even after death. This shows the sheer depth and breadth of this topic. Both concepts have fascinated philosophers and engaged the greatest thinkers throughout history, some of whom have concluded (not without reason) that, by reason of death being the Great Leveler (it is no respecter of persons) the pursuit of material possessions and status is pointless. In other words, it is sheer vanity. Kings (and Queens) have come and gone. Empires and Dynasties have crumbled and been replaced by others – including different forms of State. It makes you wonder: why do men (and women) still persist in the vainglorious pursuit of the things of this world? Why are they prepared to shed blood, risk life and limb (and everything else) knowing that they will inevitably leave it all behind? That they would be separated from it all by that silent sentinel, the Grim Reaper? Are those exertions worth the effort?\n\nHistory is replete with example of great historic men who held sway over large swathes of the earth: Julius Caesar (the Roman Empire); Kamal Ataturk (the Ottoman Empire); Napoleon Bonaparte (the French Empire); the Mongols; Adolf Hitler (Nazi Germany); King Bismarch (the Austro-Hungarian Empire); a Succession of British Sovereigns (the British Empire); Imperial Japan; The Raj (Pre-Colonial India); the Incas of Peru and the Tsars of Russia. Closer to home, we had the likes of Benin Empire, Kanem-Borno Empire, Ghana Empire, Songhai Empire, Mali Empire, Oyo Empire and the Sokoto Caliphate. Virtually all of them have either completely disappeared (along with their ruling classes/royal dynasties) or (like the British and similar Royal Families – especially in Europe) greatly diminished in power and influence – if not quite in stature. Some tyrants, despots and dictators fell from power – from grace to grass – kissing the canvas. Remember Idi Amin of Uganda; Saddam Hussein; Joseph Stalin; Pol Pot; Genghis Khan; Mao Zedong; Ivan the Terrible; Leopold II and Vlad the Impaler. They were reputed to have killed hundreds of thousands of people, mostly their citizens.\n\nToday, only very few absolute monarchies remain, such as that of Brunei, Vatican City, Eswatini, UAE, Thailand, Swaziland, and Saudi Arabia. The passage of the immediate past British monarch (Queen Elizabeth II) who died on September 8, 2022, at 96, brought the transience (or ephemerality) of power and life itself – not to mention the sheer vanity of it all – into sharp focus. One by one, her revered symbols of power (crown, scepter, jewels etc.) were taken off her casket and she was buried with not a single one of them. For good measure, the Officiating Minister simply addressed her as “our sister, Elizabeth”. He added that she was being buried as a ‘simple Christian’. Nothing more. This calls for some detailed insight into both phenomena starting with ‘ephemerality’.\n\nThis word ‘ephemeral’ has been defined as either lasting a very short time or lasting only one day. Accordingly, ‘ephemerality’ is the quality of state of lasting for a very short time; and a thing that lasts only for a short time. Some scholars have argued that, as with all things, context matters and that what is considered ‘a very short time’ varies; and therefore, it is best to think of ephemerality as a spectrum. In one particular context, social media platforms increasingly give users the option of ephemerality through settings that delete or hide posted content after a set period of time.\n\nHowever, in terms of the bigger picture, there is none bigger than our very lives – on a very personal level. We are born and (for the vast majority of us), our exits (i.e. our deaths) are mysteries in terms of the precise time and manner of their occurrence. What is clear, however, is the fleetingness of time. How often we hear the expression (or we exclaim ourselves) ‘How time flies!’, ‘time is short’ and ‘time waits for no one’. All of them convey the ephemerality of our lives. There is never enough time. Is it not it a mystery, then, why people still waste time on inanities, frivolities and simply idling away? You would think that the universality of the acceptance of the ephemerality of life would manifest in the urgency of its optimization. No second should be wasted. Our lives should be purposeful and meaningful. Alas, the reality has been anything but. Many still drift through life either trying to make sense of it all or suffering from the illusion that they have the luxury of time – that time is on their side. Needless to say, reality invariably sets in and gives such people its unique chastening: they’ve been sleep-walking through life and now it is too late. Tardiness never pays. One should always make hay while the sun shines and always strike when the iron is hot. Opportunities – when lost – are seldom regained.\n\nEphemerality of Life Nuggets\n\nThe transience of life has inspired many pith and cerebral quotes from sages and philosophers over the years. While they are, in the nature of things, broad and general in terms, their breadth and profundity, are nevertheless striking, and sometimes moving. Here is a selection:\n\n“Life is short, and it’s up to you to make it sweet.” – Sarah Louise Delany\n\n“Life is too short to stuff a mushroom.” – Jasmin Morin\n\n“Life is a first impression. You get one shot at it. Make it everlasting.” – J.R.Rim\n\n“With life as short as a half-taken breath, don’t play anything but love.” – Rumi\n\n“Life lies in the blink of an eye.” – Mike Skinner\n\n“Life is too short for unreality and you don’t owe anybody anything – especially your time, energy, and attention.” – Oli Anderson\n\n“Distractions make life seem way shorter than it is.” – Mokokoma Mokhonoana\n\n“Life goes by fast. Enjoy it. Calm down. It’s all funny.” – Joan Rivers\n\n“Yes, life is short, the roads are very difficult, but our love for life is greater than all these negativities!” – Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n“Time flies, whether you’re wasting it or not.” – Crystal Wood\n\n“Life is too short not to start something stupid.” – Richie Norton\n\n“At some point your candle will go out, so make use of the light.” – Shaun Hick\n\n“Life is short; love is longer.” – Kamand Kojouri\n\n“Life is so short, transient, and beautiful that there is not enough time to get old.” – Debasish Mridha\n\nThe list is endless, (paradoxical given the subject) and the following are additional expressions of our fascination with things ephemeral:\n\n“A dress is a piece of ephemeral architecture, designed to enhance the proportions of the female body”. – Christian Dior\n\n“Once music ceases to be ephemeral – always disappearing – and becomes instead material… it leaves the condition of traditional music and enters the condition of painting. It becomes a painting, existing as material in space, not immaterial in time”. – Brian Eno\n\n“I like the ephemeral thing about theatre, every performance is like a ghost – it’s there and then it’s gone”. – Maggie Smith\n\n“Substance is enduring, form is ephemeral”. – Dee Hock\n\n“Fashion is something which is non-lasting; it’s ephemeral”. – Lapo Elkann\n\n“I think probably the thing I’m worst at is the most ephemeral stuff, like blogs. I find it really hard to write. And I’m often been asked to write columns for papers in Peru. And I can’t. I would die. There’s no way I could write a column”. – Daniel Alarcon\n\n“Television is ephemeral, a fact that some will find reassuring. But earthlings will continue to pump the kilowatts into the ether. And eventually, when those signals have washed over a few hundred thousand star systems, someone may notice” – Seth Sostak\n\n“Perhaps summer’s ephemeral nature is what inspires us to embrace the beach read. We tell ourselves that these twisted plots and wild characters are literary ice cream sundaes – extravagant treats that aren’t as calorie-laden when we’re wearing flip flops”. – Sarah MacLean\n\nLet us now discuss vanity.\n\nVanity\n\nVanity has been defined, inter alia, as anything that is vain, empty or valueless. This meaning is arguably best known for its Biblical expression (Ecclesiastes 1:2): “Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.” The message is clear! Everything is meaningless without a proper focus on God; it underscores the importance of the fear of God in a confusing and frustrating world.\n\nAccording to a Bible scholar: “Everything is transitory and therefore of no lasting value. People are caught in the trap of the absurd and pursue empty pleasures.”\n\nKing Solomon in Ecclesiastes 1:2-3 was forced to conclude, “Vanity of vanites … Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. What profit has a man from all his labours in which he toils under the sun?”.\n\nThis view tallies with a passage in another part of the Bible, (1 John 2:16-17).\n\n“For everything in the world – the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life – comes not from the Father, but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.”\n\nThis passage, in the opinion of Duane Garrett, speaks to the short-lived (or ephemeral) nature of the passions of the world. According to him: “Many people run after pleasure thinking it will bring satisfaction (but they soon realize) that the pleasure of the moments is fleeting. It felt good while they were doing it, but after it was over, they were left unfulfilled. For most, the answer is to pursue greater pleasures, but they soon recognize they come to the same conclusion. When this happens, pleasure becomes vanity.”\n\nI cannot agree more.\n\nThe same message is contained in the Qur’an, several of whose verses emphasize the emptiness of life. For instance, in the last line in Chapter 57 (Surat Al Hadid or Iron), Verse 20, the Qur’an says that:\n\n“The present life is but the joy of delusion” (“Wa maal-hayatud-dunyaaa ila mataa-ul- gurur”).\n\nAnother instance is Chapter 47, Verse 36, where the following passage occurs:\n\n“Innamal-hayaatud-dunyaa a-ibun-wa lahw” (“This present life is but a sport and a diversion”).\n\nHowever, the full rendition of Chapter 57, Verse 20, (part of which is quoted above), drives home the point more succinctly:\n\n“Know that the present life is but a sport and a diversion, an adornment and a cause for boasting among you, and a rivalry in wealth and children, it is as a rain whose vegetation pleases the unbelievers, then it withers, and then seest it turning yellow, then it becomes broken orts”"
