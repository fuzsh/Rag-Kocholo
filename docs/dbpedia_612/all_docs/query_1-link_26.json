In his compelling talk, Emad explored pressing challenges such as the critical balance between consumption and creation of technology by few AGI companies, as well as the challenge of ensuring high-quality multimodal big data to train massive AI models. Emad highlighted the important role of open source communities in the development of Edge optimized LLMs, allowing Africans to tackle challenging problems of Africans especially in Education and Healthcare. The approach Emad Mostaque advocates for, using AI to unlock potential and catalyze innovation and creativity within the cultural context of Morocco and the broader African continent, presents a strategic roadmap for progress. This vision aims to foster a culture of innovation and talent growth in the region, setting a foundation for sustainable development and technological advancement. We extend our sincere gratitude to Emad for sharing his profound insights and reflections on critical topics, and demonstrating unwavering commitment to nurturing innovation across Morocco and Africa. His perspective serves as a call to action for Moroccan innovators, startups, and policymakers to embrace AI as a pivotal tool in shaping a prosperous future. Stay tuned for more updates and insights from our conference, as we invite you to engage with Emad‚Äôs insights, and join the conversation by sharing your thoughts on the future role of AI in Morocco and beyond. #Morocco #MoroccoAI #MoroccoAI2023 #AI #Africa #FutureOfWork\n\nLast Saturday, I had the honor of moderating a panel discussion titled 'AI in the Future of Africa' at the Africa Business Conference in Washington D.C. A huge thank you to our panelists: Sherif Nessim- Founder & Managing Partner at Jedar Capital Chidube Ezeozue Sunga Mkwezalamba- Principal at Stradford Venture Partners The conversation was not only enlightening but also a clarion call to action. Key takeaways include: Tailored solutions: AI solutions must be developed with African contexts in mind. Robust data infrastructure: Signifiant investments are required in data infrastructures to ensure proper representation in the datasets upon which the tools are developed STEM education: We must nurture the next generation of African AI innovators. AI is a powerful tool, and while not a panacea, it holds great promise for the African continent. The journey ahead has its challenges, but let's continue this vital work of collaboration and innovation to build an AI-powered future for Africa. #AI #Innovation #Technology #Africa #EconomicDevelopment #ArtificialIntelligence\n\nAs we witness an era of remarkable innovation in AI and technology, it's crucial to recognize the trailblazers who have paved the way for progress. One such luminary is Philip Emeagwali, a Nigerian computer scientist whose contributions have had a global impact. Read More: https://lnkd.in/e3q6J_zq üåç Africa's Tech Renaissance In recent years, Africa has become a burgeoning hub for technology and AI development. With a rich talent pool and a growing number of tech startups, the continent is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of these fields. Philip Emeagwali's Legacyüë®üíª Emeagwali's story is one of resilience and brilliance. Often referred to as the \"Bill Gates of Africa,\" he used his insights into data processing to formulate algorithms that revolutionized the way we search for natural resources like petroleum. His work in the 1980s on the use of interconnected processors helped lay the groundwork for the modern supercomputing era. üîç AI in Africa Today Inspired by pioneers like Emeagwali, African innovators are now harnessing AI to solve local and global challenges. From healthcare diagnostics to agricultural optimization and beyond, the applications are vast and the potential is enormous. Joining Hands for a Better Future ü§ù Investment in technology and education is surging, as governments and private entities recognize the importance of fostering local talent and innovation. Collaborations across borders are helping to accelerate growth, bringing African tech to the world stage. üîó Connecting Continents üîó As we celebrate African innovation, let's also acknowledge the interconnectedness of global community. The advancements made here are contributions to the world's technological landscape, and like Emeagaliw remind us that great minds know no geographical boundaries. The legacy of Philip Emeagwali remind us that future advancements in Africa regarding technology, particularly in AI, is already unfolding. Let's continue to support and celebrate the brilliant minds driving this progress. #africa #technology #ai #nigeria #leadership #computerscience #whatinspiresme #STEM BlackPast.org\n\nHonored to have been part of a panel discussion on \"How to Leverage Homegrown AI Solutions for Economic Growth in Africa\" alongside esteemed colleagues Mutembei Kariuki (Fastagger), Mellena H. (Telliscope), Shikoh Gitau (Qhala), and Gerald Chirinda (Future Africa Forum) organised by the Global Perspectives Initiative. Thank you Rhoda Berger for successfully leading the discussions! During the session, I shed light on Smart Africa's pivotal work and highlighted two transformative initiatives that are taking momentum: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Establishing an Africa AI action-oriented Hub to support our Member States to develop favorable policy and regulatory environment that will accelerate AI adoption. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Launching an AI uptake accelerator program to swiftly identify and implement practical AI solutions, igniting uptake in governments and various sectors. Boldly, I affirm: #Africa, with its projected population of 2.5 billion by 2050, is destined to lead in AI! By cultivating conducive policies & regulations, enhancing quality datasets accessibility, and nurturing AI skills, we'll tackle real-life challenges in healthcare, education, agriculture, climate change, finance, and beyond. As the momentum builds, I urge all our partners to board the train: Let's not stand on the sidelines or wait too long. \"It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.\" - Charles Darwin. Let's join forces to shape the future of AI in Africa through proactive action! #DNK #AIforAfrica #Innovation #JoinTheRevolution #SmartAfrica\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), a transformative technology, is a key driver of global digital transformation. It offers many new opportunities to break down barriers to human development, enhance social inclusion, and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the open online project launch on the \"Development of South Africa's AI Maturity Framework (MF)\", panellists discussed the need for a MF and the potential outcomes of the assessment, such as: informing holistic policy interventions, guiding investment decisions by both government and private sectors, establishing a baseline for AI maturity, mitigating intersectional inequalities, facilitating robust data governance, and providing recommendations for nurturing an ethical human-centred globally competitive AI ecosystem that balances innovation with safeguarding SA citizens from potential harms. Panellists Ms. Deshni Govender ‚Äì GIZ South Africa, Lesotho & eSwatini Ms. Debra Setsiba ‚Äì Department of Communication and Digital Technologies Ms. Shamira Ahmed ‚Äì Data Economy Policy Hub (DEPHUB) Prof. Jacques Joubert ‚Äì University of the Western Cape (UWC) Moderator Dr. Humphrey Brydon ‚Äì UWC Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)\n\nI had the honour of hosting a panel on ‚ÄúFostering prosperity through policies on Artificial Intelligence in Africa‚Äù at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) summit with the formidable panelists @Ousman A. Bah Fayaz King, Sandra Makumbirofa, PhD and Baratang Miya. My greatest takeaway was that the future of AI in Africa is our shared responsibility. Together, we can work across industries to create a comprehensive policy framework that strikes a balance between responsible use and innovation. As we discuss technology and the future of our continent, we need to consider practical applications, identify opportunities, and address challenges head-on and the only way we will succeed is if we work together. If we adopt a cohesive strategy, Africa will be able to fully utilise AI's potential while safeguarding its population. #UNECA #COM2024 #AIForAfrica https://lnkd.in/dzZWkUQm\n\nWe are excited to officially introduce mLab Southern Africa Southern Africa‚Äôs #AIMashup which is yet to be one of the most exciting and insightful AI events this year!
