        "text": "On February 28th…\n\nin 1704, ELIAS NEAU, a Frenchman, opened SCHOOL FOR BLACKS in NEW YORK CITY.\n\nin 1708, one of the FIRST RECORDED SLAVE REVOLTS occurred in NEWTON, LONG ISLAND, NY. Seven White People were killed. Afterward, 2 Black male slaves and a Native American Man were hanged and a Black Woman was burned alive.\n\nin 1776, PHYLLIS WHEATLEY was INVITED TO PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON’S HEADQUARTERS in Cambridge, MA. Ms. Wheatley was asked to READ A POEM she had written in his honor.\n\nin 1778, RHODE ISLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY in precedent-breaking act AUTHORIZED THE ENLISTMENT OF SLAVES. After being appointed Commander, Christopher Greene and his staff were sent back to Rhode Island to raise a black regiment to fill the ranks of the depleted 1st Rhode Island regiment. The General Assembly voted that “every able bodied Negro, Mulatto and Indian slave” could enlist for the duration of the war. Bounties and wages would be the same as they were for free men. Once enlisted and approved of by the officers of the regiment, the recruits would be free. At the time, there was a Black and Native American population of 3,331 in Rhode Island. The scheme, which compensated owners for the freedom of their slaves, produced less than 200 men. Seeing how expensive the plan was becoming, the Assembly cut off the recruiting of slaves on June 10, 1778.\n\nin 1854, the REPUBLICAN PARTY was ORGANIZED in RIPON, WI. About 50 SLAVERY OPPONENTS began the new political group.\n\nin 1859, ARKANSAS LEGISLATURE required FREE BLACKS to choose between EXILE AND ENSLAVEMENT.\n\nin 1871, SECOND ENFORCEMENT ACT gave federal officers and courts control of registration and voting in congressional elections.\n\nin 1879, the “EXODUS OF 1879,” Southern Blacks fled political and economic exploitation. Exodus continued for several years. BENJAMIN “PAP” SINGLETON, a former slave, was one of the major leaders of the Exodus movement.\n\nin 1894, ERNEST JUDSON WILSON, Negro League baseball player and manager, was BORN in REMINGTON, VIRGINIA. Wilson’s professional career spanned from 1922 to 1945 and he had a career batting average of .351, ranking among the top five hitters in the league. Wilson died June 24, 1963 and was posthumously inducted into the BASEBALL HALL OF FAME in 2006.\n\nin 1932, RICHARD SPIKES invented the AUTOMATIC GEAR SHIFT.\n\nin 1943, The play “PORGY AND BESS,” starring TODD DUNCAN and ANNE BROWN, OPENED ON BROADWAY.\n\nin 1945, CHARLES AARON “BUBBA” SMITH, retired football player and actor, was BORN in ORANGE, TEXAS. Smith played college football at Michigan State University where he was awarded ALL-AMERICA HONORS in1965 and 1966. In 1967, he was the Baltimore Colts’ number one pick in the NFL draft.

Noticing a wounded companion outside of the perimeter, he dragged the man to safety but was struck by a sniper’s bullet which shattered his left hand. Refusing medical attention and continuously exposing himself to the increasing fire as the enemy again assaulted the perimeter, P/Sgt.

Under the cover of the main attack, the enemy moved a machine gun into a location where it could sweep the entire perimeter. P/Sgt. Leonard rose to his feet, charged the enemy gun and destroyed the hostile crew despite being hit several times by enemy fire. He moved to a tree, propped himself against it, and continued to engage the enemy until he succumbed to his many wounds.

Over the next half-decade, Domino’s backbeat-heavy, rolling piano played a vital role in defining the shape of rock and roll. “Ain’t That A Shame” needed a boost from Pat Boone’s white-bread cover version before finding its way to the pop charts in 1955, but that breakthrough paved the way for two more top-five pop hits in “Blueberry Hill” and “I’m Walkin'” in 1956 and 1957, respectively.\n\nAfter three decades as a major international star—a star who sold an estimated 65 million records worldwide—Domino went into semi-retirement in the 1980s, announcing that he would no longer travel outside his native New Orleans. A man of his word, Domino was not enticed to travel even to be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Grammy, a National Medal of the Arts from President Bill Clinton or induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Domino remained a neighborhood fixture in the Ninth Ward, however, living in his colorful double-shotgun mansion and making occasional forays out to local clubs in his enormous, bright-pink Cadillac. Not surprisingly, Fats Domino returned to New Orleans as soon as he could following Hurricane Katrina.\n\nFats Domino was the best selling R&B artist of the 1950s according to Billboard books.\n\nin 1930, “THE GREEN PASTURES” OPENED at Mansfield Theater.\n\nin 1933, GODFREY MACARTHUR CAMBRIDGE, comedian and stage and film actor, was BORN in NEW YORK CITY.

Mr. Jackson, a Deacon in Marion, Alabama, was only 26 years old on the day of the shooting. On February 18, 1965, approximately 500 people attempted a peaceful walk to the Perry County Jail where a young Civil Rights worker was being held. The demonstrations were designed to get the attention of the Johnson administration in Washington, DC. The protesters were met by Marion City police officers, sheriff’s deputies, and Alabama State Troopers who began to beat the protesters. When Jackson attempted to protect his mother, a trooper shot Mr. Jackson twice in the abdomen and he died from the wounds a week later. Trooper James Bonard Fowler admitted to shooting Jackson but in September, 1965 a grand jury declined to indict him. On May 10, 2007, 42 years after the crime, Fowler was charged with first and second degree murder for the death of Jackson. In 2010, two weeks before he was scheduled to go to trial, Fowler pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor second-degree manslaughter charge and was sentenced to six months in jail.

It was the FIRST NON-CHURCH BLACK INSTITUTION IN AMERICA, predating Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa., by a year. With the help of a group of friends, Mr. Bowen, the principal founder organized the “YMCA for Colored Men and Boys.” This YMCA was founded only nine years after the world’s first YMCA was founded in London, England and less than two years after the first North American YMCAs were organized in Boston and Montreal. This milestone was achieved eight years before the Civil War and ten years before slavery officially ended in the United States.\n\nAnthony Bowen, a true trailblazer, was born a slave in 1809 and was the FIRST BLACK MAN TO BECOME A CLERK IN THE U.S. PATENT OFFICE. It was a white co-worker, William Chauncy Langdon, a member of the board of the year-old Washington YMCA for white men and boys who first told Mr. Bowen about the YMCA. With black people barred from membership in any organizations of the day, Bowen decided that a “Black YMCA” was needed.\n\nAs Anthony Bowen’s work in the 1850s indicates, African Americans embraced the YMCA early on, but social and financial conditions for black people made it difficult for the movement to grow very quickly. However, by the late 1860s, the movement grew roots in the black community and gave life to associations in New York City, Philadelphia, Charleston, SC and Harrisburg, PA. In 1867, E. V. C. Eato of New York City became the first black delegate to attend the YMCA’s annual convention.\n\nThe DC branch of the organization was incorporated on June 6, 1892. Its first building at Twelfth Street, N.W. in Washington DC was dedicated on 12 May 1912. African American citizens of Washington contributed $27,000 toward the cost. In 1972, the name was officially changed from “Twelfth Street YMCA” to the “Anthony Bowen Branch YMCA” in honor of its founder and first president.\n\nin 1837, CHEYNEY UNIVERSITY, the OLDEST INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, was founded in CHEYNEY, PA, west of Philadelphia. At its founding, the university was named theAFRICAN INSTITUTE however the name was changed several weeks later to THE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED YOUTH. In subsequent years, the school was named CHEYNEY TRAINING SCHOOL FOR TEACHERS, CHEYNEY STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE, and CHEYNEY STATE COLLEGE. Today the university has approximately 1,300 undergraduate students, 180 graduate students and 125 faculty members. Notable alumni include Bayard Rustin, Ed Bradley, Robert W. Bogle, Congressman Curt Weldon, and Ambassador Joseph M. Segars.\n\nin 1870, two days after Mississippi was granted representation in Congress for the first time since it seceded in 1861, HON. HIRAM RHODES REVELS was sworn in, becoming THE FIRST BLACK U.S. SENATOR. Sen. Revels represented Mississippi from Feb. 25, 1870, to March 4, 1871, during reconstruction. However, because, there were no black delegates in the House of Representatives, Sen. Revels is also the FIRST BLACK PERSON TO SERVE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS. During the Civil War, Revels, a college-educated minister, helped form African American army regiments for the Union cause, started a school for freed men, and served as a chaplain for the Union army. Posted to Mississippi, Revels remained in the former Confederate state after the war and entered into Reconstruction-era Southern politics.\n\nIn 1867, the first Reconstruction Act was passed by a Republican-dominated U.S. Congress, dividing the South into five military districts and granting suffrage to all male citizens, regardless of race. A politically mobilized African American community joined with white allies in the Southern states to elect the Republican Party to power, which in turn brought about radical changes across the south. By 1870, all the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union, and most were controlled by the Republican Party, thanks in large part to the support of African American voters. On January 20, 1870, Hiram R. Revels was elected by the Mississippi legislature to fill the Senate seat once held by Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederacy.\n\nin 1919, Monford Merrill “MONTE” IRVIN, hall of fame baseball player, was BORN IN HALEBURG, ALABAMA. Irvin began playing baseball professionally in the Negro League where he starred until 1949 when he was signed by the New York Giants of the Major Leagues.

Higginbotham founded the South Africa Free Election Fund and raised several million dollars to support fair elections in South Africa and served as one of the international mediators of the 1994 election. After the election, he helped the government draft a new constitution. President William Clinton awarded Higginbotham the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM in 1995 and in 1996 the NAACP awarded him the SPINGARN MEDAL.

HENRY OSSAWA TANNER had the FIRST ONE-PERSON SHOW BY A BLACK ARTIST.\n\nin 1930, ARCHIBALD HENRY GRIMKE, lawyer, journalist, diplomat and CO-FOUNDER OF THE NAACP, DIED. Grimke was born enslaved on August 17, 1849 in Charleston, SC. He and his family were freed by their owner upon his death. Grimke went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree, with honors, and a Master of Arts degree from Lincoln University in 1870 and 1872, respectively. In 1874, he earned a law degree from Harvard University.\n\nAfter doing graduate work at Princeton Theological Seminary, Grimke was ordained a Presbyterian minister.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was ORDAINED as a Baptist minister\n\nin 1951, JOSEPH “CYCLONE JOE” WILLIAMS, Negro League baseball pitcher, DIED. Williams was born April 6, 1886 in Seguin, Texas. He began playing baseball professionally in 1905. Although records are sketchy, Williams was credited with 41 wins and 3 losses in 1914. He also pitched many games against major league stars in post-season barnstorming exhibitions and is credited with posting a record of 20 wins and 7 losses in those games.\n\nWilliams retired in 1932 and although most modern sources consider Satchel Paige to be the greatest Negro League pitcher, a 1952 poll by the Pittsburgh Courier gave that title to Williams. Williams was inducted into theBASEBALL HALL OF FAME IN 2001.\n\nin 1951, Olympic Gold Medalist, DONALD QUARRIE, One of the top sprinters in the world in his day was BORN in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nin 1964, before a crowd of 8,300 spectators at the Convention Hall Arena in Miami Beach, Fla., CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY, JR. was awarded a TKO (Technical Knockout) in 6 rounds OVER SONNY LISTON to win his FIRST OF THREE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLES. Clay was undefeated but had been knocked down and almost out by England’s Henry Cooper in his previous bout. Clay came into the match a 10-1 underdog against the seemingly invincible Liston. However, Clay predicted victory, boasting that he would “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and knock out Liston in the eighth round. This loud taunting and high pulse rate before the bout convinced many that he was terrified of the Liston, then Champion. At the end of the fourth round, blinded by an unknown substance, Clay begged trainer Angelo Dundee to let him quit. Dundee did not oblige. Instead, Clay, nicknamed the “Louisville Lip,” proved to not be a bragging fraud. Clay danced and backpedaled away from Liston’s powerful swings and circled the onrushing Liston until his vision cleared. He peppered the Champion with quick, yet, punishing jabs to Liston’s head and a bevy of straight rights. Liston hurt his shoulder in the first round, injuring some muscles when he swung for and missed the fleet-footed and elusive. At the end of round 6, the Champ and Clay were almost equal in points. However, the Champion complained of the injured shoulder again and stayed on his stool. The loquacious 22-year old youngster had shocked the odds-makers with a seventh-round technical knockout. It is still rumored that Liston faked the injury and threw the fight, but there has never been any evidence, such as a significant change in bidding odds just before the bout, to support the claim.\n\nMr. Clay was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1942. He started boxing at age 12 and had amassed a record of over 100 wins in amateur competition by age 18. In 1959, he won the INTERNATIONAL GOLDEN GLOVES HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE and in 1960, a GOLD MEDAL IN THE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CATEGORY AT THE SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES IN ROME. Clay turned professional after the Olympics and went undefeated in his first 19 bouts, earning him the right to challenge Sonny Liston, who had defeated Floyd Patterson in 1962 to win the heavyweight title.\n\nTo celebrate winning the world heavyweight title, Clay went to a private party at a Miami hotel that was attended by his friend Malcolm X, an outspoken leader of the Black Muslim group known as the Nation of Islam. Two days later, a markedly more restrained Clay announced he was joining the Nation of Islam and defended the organization’s concept of racial segregation while speaking of the importance of the Muslim religion in his life. Later in 1964, Clay, who was the descendant of a runaway Kentucky slave, rejected the name originally given to his family by a slave owner and TOOK THE MUSLIM NAME OF MUHAMMAD ALI.\n\nMuhammad Ali would go on to become one of the 20th century’s greatest sporting figures, as much for his social and political influence as his prowess in his chosen sport. After successfully defending his title nine times, it was stripped from him in 1967 after he refused induction into the U.S. Army on the grounds that he was a Muslim minister and therefore a conscientious objector. That year, he was sentenced to five years in prison for violating the Selective Service Act but was allowed to remain free as he appealed the decision. His popularity plummeted, but many across the world applauded his bold stand against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1970, Ali was allowed to return to the boxing ring, and the next year the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Ali’s draft evasion conviction. In 1974, he REGAINED THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE in a match against George Foreman in Zaire and successfully defended it in a brutal 15-round contest against Joe Frazier in the Philippines in the following year. In 1978, he lost the title to Leon Spinks but later that year DEFEATED SPINKS IN A REMATCH, making him the FIRST BOXER TO WIN THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE THREE TIMES. He retired in 1979 but returned to the ring twice in the early 1980s.\n\nThe former “Draft Dodger” would go on to become a notable figure in American and International diplomatic affairs. In 1990, Ali was inducted into the INTERNATIONAL BOXING HALL OF FAME and in 1996, he LIT THE OLYMPIC FLAME at the opening ceremonies of the Summer Games in Atlanta, Georgia. On JANUARY 8, 2005, Muhammad Ali was presented with the PRESIDENTIAL CITIZENS MEDAL BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH. At a White House ceremony on NOVEMBER 9, 2005, Muhammad Ali was awarded the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM. On DECEMBER 17, 2005 Mr. Ali received the “OTTO HAHN PEACE MEDAL IN GOLD” from the UN Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin for his work with the US Civil Rights Movement and the United Nations.\n\nin 1967, CARL J. MURPHY, journalist, civil rights leader and educator, DIED. Murphy was born January 17, 1889 in Baltimore, Maryland. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Howard University in 1911 and a Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1913. Murphy served as chairman of the German Department at Howard from 1913 to 1918.\n\nIn 1922, he assumed control of the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper and over the next four decades solidified it as a major African American newspaper, increasing circulation from 14,000 to more than 200,000 with over 200 employees. Under his leadership, the newspaper was deeply involved in the organization of the 1965 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Murphy was awarded the NAACP SPINGARN MEDAL in 1955. The Murphy Fine Arts Center and the Carl J. Murphy Scholarship Fund at Morgan State University are named in his honor.\n\nin 1975, ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, leader of the Nation of Islam, DIED.

In 1931, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad and in 1932 he took over leadership of Temple No. 1 in Detroit. In 1934, Muhammad was named Minister of Islam. In 1942, he was charged with eight counts of sedition for instructing his followers not to register with Selective Service or serve in the military. Found guilty, he served four years in prison. Following his release from prison, the Nation of Islam grew significantly and by the 1970s they owned businesses, farmland, schools and a bank. In 1972, Muhammad stated that the NOI had a net worth of $75 million. In the early 1990s, the City of Detroit renamed part of Linwood Avenue, “Elijah Muhammad Boulevard.” Several books have been published about Muhammad, including “An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad” (1998) and “The Messenger: The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad” (2001).\n\nin 1978, DANIEL “CHAPPIE” JAMES, JR., the FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO ACHIEVE THE RANK OF 4 STAR GENERAL IN THE U.S. AIR FORCE, DIED at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO.
