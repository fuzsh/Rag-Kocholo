        "text": "Nestled right in the middle of our nation’s capital, George Washington University provides students with a wealth of research, non-profit, and career opportunities. It embraces its role at the center of politics, with curriculums that connect the classroom to real-world policies and “to internships, particularly those in international or political fields.” The administration “has great communication with its students and professors,” and “the school makes it very easy to gain access” to jobs, research assistant positions, and speaking events. “I’ve heard speeches from the German ambassador, the French ambassador, Supreme Court justices, Bill Gates, and many more,” says one student.\n\nProfessors have “relevant and current experience in what they’re teaching” (for instance, “a large number of history professors work for the Office of the Historian for the State Department”) and are “extremely qualified.” Where applicable, expect teachers to make the most of on-site learning: “I took a class called The Visual World of Shakespeare. We traveled to art museums and libraries across DC every Friday.” For those looking to get even more hands-on, study abroad is a popular option that forty percent of students engage in. Professors also encourage students to pressure themselves less with acing an exam and more on the ability to “understand and ask questions about the material,” and students have positively responded: “It’s great having access to such experienced resources.” In short, the emphasis is on the learning, not the frustration: “If someone is struggling with something, there will always be someone to talk to.”\n\n“Part of the appeal of being at GW is the Washington, DC, landscape,” and there is no shortage of cultural options like the Smithsonian institutions, the National Mall, and visiting the monuments (“Especially at night, it’s so fun!”). Since the university “does not have a traditional campus and is instead integrated with the city, most people just go their own way during the day”; it’s not unusual to “find a lot of people at coffee shops getting their caffeine fixes and eating while studying.”\n\nStudents do acknowledge that “housing and dining are amazing,” and point to intramural sports, clubs (more than 400 organizations, all told), and the Greek scene, but at least during the week, the focus is on how “academics are a big part of daily life,” so much so that “people go to internships as frequently as they go to class.” That can be seen in the more technical clubs—“a really great opportunity to learn in a more hands-on and practical way”—as well as in the number of students actively working, whether that’s for the school, through an internship, or professionally. One student describes how a short-term gig “creating a new branding identity and set of materials for their yearly gala” wound up leading to a full summer job. These on-the-go students benefit from the GW SafeRide, a free cab service between academic buildings and residence halls at night. The final consensus is that “being in Foggy Bottom is a unique professional and academic experience that you cannot receive at any other institution.”"
