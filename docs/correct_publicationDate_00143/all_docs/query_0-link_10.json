Previous owners’ names written inside it.\n\nBlurb: Check out this gorgeous Richard Powers cover to Ballard’s first book! The Wind from Nowhere is a science fiction novel by English author J.G. Ballard. Published in 1961, it was his debut novel. He had previously published only short stories. The novel was the first of a series of Ballard novels dealing with scenarios of natural disaster.\n\nThe wind came from nowhere … a super-hurricane that blasted round the globe at hundreds of miles per hour burying whole communities beneath piles of rubble, destroying all organized life and driving those it did not kill to seek safety in tunnels and sewers – where they turned against each other in their desperate struggle to survive."
