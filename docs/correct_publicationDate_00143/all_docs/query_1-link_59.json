        "text": "J.G. Ballard was an English author who passed away in 2009. As an author, he first rose to fame for his novel The Drowned World that put him in association with the New Wave of science fiction. He would go on to write Empire of the Sun, a semi-autobiographical novel about a young British boy in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation.\n\nThat book was made into a film starring Christian Bale and directed by Steven Spielberg. That wasn’t the only book of his to be adapted into a film as he also had his books Crash (by David Cronenberg) and High-Rise (by Ben Wheatley) adapted into films.\n\nPublication Order of Empire Of The Sun Books\n\nEmpire of the Sun (1984)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Kindness of Women (1991)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nThe Wind from Nowhere (1962)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Drowned World (1962)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Drought (1964)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Crystal World (1966)Amazon.com | Amazon.deLove and Napalm (1970)Amazon.com | Amazon.deCrash (1973)Amazon.com | Amazon.deConcrete Island (1974)Amazon.com | Amazon.deHigh-Rise (1975)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Unlimited Dream Company (1979)Amazon.com | Amazon.deHello America (1981)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Day of Creation (1987)Amazon.com | Amazon.deRunning Wild (1988)Amazon.com | Amazon.deRushing to Paradise (1994)Amazon.com | Amazon.deCocaine Nights (1996)Amazon.com | Amazon.deSuper-Cannes (2000)Amazon.com | Amazon.deMillennium People (2003)Amazon.com | Amazon.deKingdom Come (2006)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nPublication Order of Short Stories/Novellas\n\nChronopolis (1971)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nPublication Order of Collections\n\nBillenium (1962)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Voices of Time (1962)Amazon.com | Amazon.dePassport To Eternity (1963)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Terminal Beach (1964)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Day of Forever (1967)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Disaster Area (1967)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Atrocity Exhibition (1970)Amazon.com | Amazon.deVermilion Sands (1971)Amazon.com | Amazon.deChronopolis and Other Stories (1971)Amazon.com | Amazon.deLow Flying Aircraft and Other Stories (1976)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Best Short Stories of J.

Ballard Books, You’ll Love…\n\nPhilip K. Dick\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\nOctavia E. Butler\n\nThe Drowned World imagines a terrifying world where global warming has melted the ice caps and a jungle has overrun a now tropical London. The book takes place in 2145 and follows a biologist named Dr. Robert Kearns and his team of scientists as they confront the city jungle. The book works as a biological mystery with giant lizards, dragonflies, and insects fiercely as well as a retelling of the Heart of Darkness as the story also includes a mad white hunter and his hordes of native soldiers.\n\nConsidered one of the most shocking novels of the twentieth century, Crash is a blend of violence, transgression, and eroticism. The book follows a man named Robert Vaughan, a former TV scientist who has turned into a nightmare angel of the expressway. He collects alienated crash victims and also dabbels in experiments with a series of autoerotic atrocities that continue to get more and more sinister. All of this works to satisfy Vaughan, but it is not enough as he craves the ultimate crash – a head-on collision of blood, semen, engine coolant, and iconic celebrity.\n\nWhile I appreciate all offers of donations to show your appreciation for the site, I’d much rather you do that by supporting causes that need the money far more than I do. Each month I pick a few select charities broken down by our most popular countries that you can support instead.
