        "text": "The Wind From Nowhere -1962\n\nThis title is currently out of print in the U.S.\n\nSince this is Ballard's first book and probably the longest out of print, I guess I should be glad that I at least have a copy of this novel. I found this at some NY thrift store for a few bucks. This marked the beginning of a Ballard genre, the global catastrophe.\n\nDr. Maitland is leaving England, and his wife Susan. Or at least, those are his plans, but a strange global wind has stopped him. A strange mysterious wind begins crossing the globe, increasing at a rate of 5mph per day, and reddish-brown, Tibetan topsoil is dusting down all over London. All air and sea transport is halted, stranding Maitland in London as he tries to leave for Vancouver. As the winds build, how will they all survive?"
