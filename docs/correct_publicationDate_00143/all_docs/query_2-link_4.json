        "text": "I recently finished Running Wild - brilliant - and I am just about finished with War Fever.\n\nI've also read a few short story collections (including The Best SF Short Stories of... which is probably my 2nd favorite collection of short stories I've ever read, right after Alfred Bester's Virtual Unrealities), The Atrocity Exhibition, Empire of the Sun, and Concrete Jungle.\n\nBeyond his imaginative ideas, what I like best about Ballard is how he uses the form of the narrative to strengthen the theme. He thinks of both form and function, and how the two possess a symbiotic relationship.\n\nFor instance, one \"story\" in War Fever is actually just a list of 40 or so answers to a questionnaire. However, we are never told who is taking the test, or what the questions were. Just based on the answers, it is up to us, the reader, to parse out the plot and the character.\n\nAnother story is basically just a title, but each word in the title has a footnote to be read.\n\nIt is all very fascinating, and many of his stories are written in such a way.\n\nI own, or have recently ordered/purchased, about 15 of Ballard's books, and I am greatly looking forward to reading each and every one.\n\nAnd with his ailing health (I've heard that his prostate cancer has spread throughout much of his body), it looks like another brilliant SF author will be leaving us all too soon.\n\nIf any of you haven't yet read Ballard, I would first ask why, and secondly I would encourage you to do so. He is an author who 1) makes you think, a lot, 2) really understands western culture, 3) will challenge you at each and every turn, and 4) could possibly change the way you think about literature, and, perhaps, life itself.\n\nDitto. Ballard is one of the most original, thoughtful, challenging, and provocative writers of the latter half of the twentieth century (and opening years of the twenty-first, of course). He has also written several pieces that far transcend genre lines, as well as no few that are considered classics of either sf or fantasy. I can't think of a piece by Ballard that is not worth reading (though, of course, some are better than others), and nearly all are worth pondering and rereading, as well.\n\nA truly unique voice, with many who attempt imitation (some more talented than others, as well), and one who has raised the bar on speculative fiction time and again....\n\nWhat kind of SF is he famous for ? Dystopia's ?\n\nHis recent books i have seen in the stores dont sound like SF books.\n\nIsnt he also the guy that wrote the book that become that movie with a young Christian Bale ?\n\nThat was Empire of the Sun - part autobiography. It's about Ballard's early life in Shanghai. It is followed by The Kindness of Women, about his mother's death.\n\nIn regards to his SF, it is more Speculative than Science, and yes, it is often described as dystopian.\n\nHe is an author who really understands western culture: society, pop-culture, consumerism, technology, family, desires, dreams, and how all of these things impact our psyches. He often deals with isolation in the midst of society, and many of his stories possess an atmosphere of intense loss and longing.\n\nWhile he has moved away from what we might call SF (at least in the way it is defined by genrehounds), he still deals with themes that present themselves in a SF manner.\n\nPick this up:\n\nThe Best Short Stories of...\n\nAmazon.com: The Best Short Stories of J. G. Ballard: J. G. Ballard, Anthony Burgess: Books\n\nIt is amazing, and will give you a great insight into the kind of author he is. I cannot imagine anyone who is really into SF and good literature not loving most of these stories.\n\nOh, Ballard will definitely make you think... with a vengeance!\n\nAnd Ballard's work, as he so often said himself, was more about \"inner space\" than outer space. He's not interested in hardware, but in the human (or, as he so often wryly called it, the \"post-human\") element, but in rather unique ways.\n\nTry any of the following for the flavor of his work (which is really quite varied, to be honest...):\n\nThe Voices of Time (sc)\n\nThe Drowned World (novel)\n\nThe Crystal World (novel)\n\nVermillion Sands (sc)\n\nThe Atrocity Exhibition (sc/novel)\n\nCrash (novel)\n\nConcrete Island (novel)\n\nHigh Rise (novel) (these form a trilogy of sorts)\n\nLow-Flying Aircraft and Other Stories (sc)\n\nMyths of the Near Future (sc)\n\nMemories of the Space Age (sc)\n\nWar Fever (sc)\n\nA User's Guide to the Millennium (essays)\n\nYou might want to check this out, to help you decide:\n\nJ. G. Ballard - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nI can't comment conclusively about dystopian Sf/lit, but many of Ballards books are considered to be within the realms of this sub-genre without necessarily being apocalyptic.\n\nEven the short book I recently finished - Running Wild - could probably be described as dystopian. It deals with the psychological effects of complete sanity, gated communities, surveillance, and sterile environments.\n\nHe often takes ubiquitous things such as advertising, or our consumer driven tendencies, and then extrapolates upon these ideas and how they impact our near future selves.\n\nHe also deals a lot with the atrocities and absurdities of war culture, and out disgusting infatuation with violence and weapons. The book War Fever contains an awesome little story called The Secret History of World War 3. It is quite brilliant. The title story from this collection also deals with the idea of a war-society in an interesting manner.\n\nMany of the stories in The Best Short Stories of... also deal with the problems that future humans will have to face because of the choices we are making now, thus creating a dystopian society out of seemingly benign decisions. Ballard often comments so deftly on the here and now that his stories become prophetic without really trying to be.\n\nI haven't read enough Vonnegut to draw a comparison, but I believe he and Ballard could be shelved together without a problem.\n\nA speedy reaserch on library catalog and bookmooch showed these books/collections are my choice for trying out Ballard :\n\nLibrary :\n\nShort story collections\n\nWar Fever\n\nThe disaster area\n\nBooks\n\nSuper-Cannes\n\nBookmooch :\n\nHello America\n\nRushing to Paradise\n\nThe Day of Creation\n\nAny recommendation on which short story collection and novel i should get ?\n\nThey dont sound like his most famous works which is fine by me i would rather buy them later if i come to like JG Ballard anyway.\n\nIt was a nice suprise the library had 39 books of his. Which is alot for a SF writer and they were most his SF+ Empire of The Sun. Shame they were often the same books with different languages...\n\nI don't know as I'd call any of Ballard's work \"post-apocalyptic\" in the strict sense. Even his \"ecological disaster\" quartet (The Wind from Nowhere, The Drowned World, The Drought, and The Crystal World) aren't truly -- save perhaps for the last -- post-apocalyptic in the usual sense. He takes a single shift in the environment and shows its effect on the human psyche, and it is often those who make the most unconventional adjustment to that change that are the protagonists of his novels. Even with something like The Atrocity Exhibition, the \"apocalypse\" (if there is one) can be said to be entirely internal... though whether said apocalypse happened to T- or to everyone else, or to both though in vastly different forms, is one of the questions Ballard poses the reader....\n\nNor are his books particulary dystopian or utopian... they are much more difficult to classify than that, really. They are, however, quite disturbing, often beautiful; definitely surrealistic, yet frequently with an almost clinical eye to addressing reality....\n\nAs I said before, a truly unique voice, with a truly unique vision....\n\nAs for D_Davis' question... I only fairly recently got hold of Hello, America, and I've not read either at this point, so I'm afraid I won't be any help there....\n\nThat was Empire of the Sun - part autobiography.

I cannot imagine anyone who is really into SF and good literature not loving most of these stories.\n\nI see what you mean by Speculative rather than Science. But im starting to dislike the word Speculative when its used to SF.\n\nMany authors are liked that not about the Science. Its why its called Science Fiction.\n\nToo many times people use Speculative like SF isnt good enough of genre for authors like this.\n\nI read even an interview where my alltime favorit Jack Vance didnt want to call his SF...Science Fiction.....\n\nIts just a genre name, it doesnt bring down the quality of work automaticly, its not Sc-Fi....\n\nI can definitely vouch for War Fever - it contains some excellent stories, and it a pretty good introduction to Ballard.\n\nDo the \"ecological disaster\" quartet books need to be read in order, or are they a quartet in theme only?\n\nIn trying to think of a way to describe Ballard's voice, his vision, I found that it is really hard to come up with the right words. His stories are like snapshots of beautiful and frightening dreams, dreams that are often times nightmares of our own making. His characters find themselves trapped and isolated by the very worlds and things they helped to create.\n\nYou know that unsettling feeling you get while watching a David Lynch film? Reading Ballard is kind of like this. His books will make you look at things in a different light.\n\nI can definitely vouch for War Fever - it contains some excellent stories, and it a pretty good introduction to Ballard.\n\nDo the \"ecological disaster\" quartet books need to be read in order, or are they a quartet in theme only?\n\nIn trying to think of a way to describe Ballard's voice, his vision, I found that it is really hard to come up with the right words.

Or are you new to JG and read only few works ?\n\nWar Fever it is then.\n\nBooks wise its beteween Super-Cannes and Day of the Creation which has a plus cause of the interesting sounding version of Africa.\n\nI have Day of Creation, but I have not read it yet. I've mostly read his short stories and novellas, but I will be diving into his novels soon. I read The Best Short Stories of... Years ago, and, like I said, it totally blew my mind. I then read the few books I could get my hands on, and only recently have I ordered a bunch of the harder to find in stores stuff.\n\nIt's weird, I did the same think with Theodore Sturgeon. I read The Dreaming Jewels many years ago, totally loved, but I waited until about a year ago to really dive deep into his work.\n\nI have heard many good things bout DoC.\n\nWar Fever is worth it just for The Secret History of World War 3. It's a great story. I rank it right along side Bester's The Disappearing Act, which is probably my favorite short story.\n\nCool quote from a good inverview:\n\nJGB: [FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif] So if you regard s.f. as the folk literature of the twentieth century, as many people do, its inaccuracies pale into insignificance. In many ways, accuracy is the last refuge of the unimaginative -- it's a last-ditch retreat. Because I think there's something vital about the power of the imagination and its ability to remake the world. You see this, for instance, in the classic surrealist paintings of Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, Giorgio de Chirico and Paul Delvaux, where the laws of time and space are constantly being suspended, and where reality is decoded in an attempt to discover the superreality that lies behind the facade of everyday life. And that means everything from the world of politics and mass merchandising to something as trivial as the fabrics people have in their homes.[/FONT]\n\n1987 Rolling Stone JG Ballard interview with Jonathan Cott\n\n[FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][/FONT]"
