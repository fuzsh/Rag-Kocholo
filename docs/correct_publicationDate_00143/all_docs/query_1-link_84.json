My introduction to J. G. Ballard proper. This is the FINAL English reissue done by Penguin in 1974. Cover art by David Pelham. Ballard’s first novel that is famously suppressed by both Ballard and his estate. I don’t know why since it was a fun read, though far more “traditional” in structure than what I have read of Ballard from his short stories. From the back: “The wind came from nowhere… a super-strong hurricane that blasted round the globe at hundreds of miles per hour burying whole communities beneath piles of rubble, destroying all organized life and driving those it did not kill to seek safety in tunnels and sewers - where they turned against each other in their desperate struggle to survive…”\nI found it a very fast- paced novel that was loads of fun. Nothing like an environmental apocalypse novel to finish a lazy Sunday ☕️ Ballard’s prose is simpler here but it was far more accessible than what his later work suggests. I give it a B. #bookstagram #jgballard #penguinbooks #read #reading #vintagesciencefiction #sciencefictionbooks #sciencefictionnovel #vintagesf #readmorebooks #scifiart #bookaddict #scifireads #vintagebooks\".",
