        "text": "J.G. Ballard (born November 15, 1930, Shanghai, China—died April 19, 2009, London, England) was a British author of science fiction set in ecologically unbalanced landscapes caused by decadent technological excess.\n\nThe son of a British business executive based in China, Ballard spent four years of his boyhood in a Japanese prison camp near Shanghai during World War II. This experience is recounted in his largely autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun (1984; film 1987). The devastated city and nearby countryside also provided settings for several of his apocalyptic novels. He attended King’s College, Cambridge, but left without a degree. His first short stories appeared in the 1950s. Beginning in the 1960s, Ballard wrote longer works, including The Drowned World (1962), The Wind from Nowhere (1962), The Burning World (1964), and The Crystal World (1966).\n\nWith the gory images of his surreal short stories in The Atrocity Exhibition (1970; also published as Love and Napalm: Export U.S.A.; film 2000), Ballard began writing of dehumanized sex and technology at their most extreme. His novels Crash (1973; film 1996), Concrete Island (1974), and High Rise (1975; film 2015) depict 20th-century middle-class people devolving into savagery. Contrasting with this apocalyptic vision of the future were his almost wistful short stories about the decadent technological utopia Vermilion Sands; these were collected in Vermilion Sands (1971). His short-story collection War Fever (1990) contains humorously nihilistic meditations on such topics as compulsory sex and the oblivious attitudes of a media-saturated society.\n\nBallard’s stylistic debts to Joseph Conrad are evident in his novel The Day of Creation (1987). The Kindness of Women (1991) follows the alternately dissipated and transcendent later life of the protagonist of Empire of the Sun and is written in the same semiautobiographical vein as its predecessor. Ballard infused later works with new variations on the dystopian themes of his earlier novels. Rushing to Paradise (1994) concerns an environmentalist so rabidly committed to her cause that she becomes homicidal, and Cocaine Nights (1996) centres on an island community whose cultured lifestyle is supported by crime. Ballard deploys events of extraordinary violence in the plots of Super-Cannes (2000), Millennium People (2003), and Kingdom Come (2006), effectively exposing the foibles of his middle-class characters by documenting their reactions to the violence against a stark backdrop of shopping malls and office parks."
