Anthropocentrism interprets the world in terms of human values and experiences. Although anthropocentrism has maintained a manner to understand the global, this has led to have an effect on all human domains . Rob Boddice asserts that during historic times, human beings have constantly appeared themselves in connection to divinities instead of animals . As a end result of those, human beings want to rethink their role inside this planet. J.G. Ballard does an splendid task in exposing human beings and their relation to the non-human global in his post-apocalyptic collection of novels. In J.G.Ballard &#39;s climate fiction the first and foremost is The Wind from Nowhere though it is not his best.This paper deals with anthropocentrism to justify the usage of nature as an significant device which belongs to human beings. In this novel J.G.Ballard turns the anthropocentric belief the wrong way up through growing a global this is absolutely ruled through nature."
