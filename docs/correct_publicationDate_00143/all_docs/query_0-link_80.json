        "text": "James Graham \"J. G.\" Ballard (15 November 1930 √ê 19 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist. Ballard came to be associated with the New Wave of science fiction early in his career with apocalyptic (or post-apocalyptic) novels such as The Drowned World (1962), The Burning World (1964), and The Crystal World (1966).\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s Ballard focused on an eclectic variety of short stories (or \"condensed novels\") such as The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), which drew closer comparison with the work of postmodernist writers such as William S. Burroughs."
