        "text": "July 19, 2024\n\nBallard’s first two novels.\n\nThe Drowned World is exactly what it sounds like, where the earth has been inundated by a deluge following the melting of the ice caps. This was caused by solar radiation and the planet is getting hotter year over year. The story starts after this catastrophe has been going on for about 30 years. This is a well-written tale that took a minute to get moving, but once some of the philosophic elements were introduced, I was into it. Expectations get subverted a few times and you never quite know where the story is going, which is a plus for me. Some suspension of disbelief is required, but the story takes itself seriously. 4 stars.\n\nThe Wind From Nowhere is another apocalyptic tale where the winds have gone amok and continue accelerating while the poor humans get to deal with it. This story was a little hard to follow. I couldn’t get invested in the characters or their story, and even through there’s plenty of action, I just didn’t care much. 3 stars tops.\n\nBoth novels present more as end-of-the-world horror rather than science fiction. The horror element is mild compared to what would come later in this genre, as fans of apocalyptic fiction from the late 70s to today can attest. Ballard is a skilled writer and there are occasional hints of genius in The Drowned World.\n\nI’ll round this up to 4 stars if they’re still publishing these books as a two-for-one.\n\nFebruary 24, 2016\n\nA double-feature of the sort of apocalypse porn that dominated '60s sci-fi. My dad used to say he stopped reading sci-fi in the '60s and '70s because of stuff like this, and it's not hard to see how a steady diet of doomsaying and nihilism would wear thin pretty fast.\n\nThat said, these books, in-and-of-themselves are not bad. \"The Wind From Nowhere\" is an early apocalyptic, while the \"The Drowned World\" is a late apocalyptic, bordering on post. Both are well-written in terms of attention to detail and conveying worlds where \"slight\" (in the cosmological sense) changes result in catastrophic conditions for human civilization.\n\nLooking at it factually, our protagonists in \"Drowned\" appear to be neurotic, affected by a disease that draws them deeper into this new, very hot, wet, jungle world where triassic life forms are re-asserting dominance. Besides the people affected by this condition, the two main factions are remnants of the old civilization, and looters who seem to be trying to reclaim land from the encroaching swamp.\n\nThere's a suggestion that, somehow, the crazy people are reverting to an ancient archetype, but not only is this not backed up, it's essentially refuted at the end, at least by the facts. I didn't hate it because there seemed to be at least a hint of truth or validity given by the author, or maybe just a convincingly sold delusion. It avoids utter nihilism this way.\n\nThe only thing that tripped me up with \"Drowned\" is that periodically Ballard would describe moisture as evaporating instantly (due to the heat) but I couldn't see how that made sense given, you know, the whole drowned thing. I mean, where I live, I can spill some water and it'll be gone by the time I've gotten back with something to wipe it up with, but this is an anti-swamp.\n\nA minor point, but given the detail he put into the \"Drowned\" ecosystem, it was sort of jarring.\n\nIn \"Wind\" the wind just starts kicking up. No explanation given. It just gets faster and faster until all the soil of the earth is flying through the air at 500mph. In this case, the protagonists are just trying to survive, and the only neurotic is a millionaire hotel mogul (kaff!) who decides he's going to not hide underground with the proles. That and the wife of one of the protagonist's who decides...well, I don't know what was going on in her head, but it doesn't end well for her.\n\nOne might wonder about Mr. Ballard's relationships with women from these two books.\n\n\"Wind\" was a little harder to track some of the characters on, and I don't know if that's due to environmental distractions I had, or if they weren't super-strongly drawn, or because Ballard alternates between them chapter-by-chapter, in very intense chapters, so that it becomes easy to lose particular identities in the struggle to survive. Or maybe it was because there were so many last names beginning with the letter \"M\", I don't know.\n\nThe Trumpian might-be-villain is introduced at the very end of the book, with only a hint earlier on. That might be part of it, too.\n\nAnyway, largely books about enduring. Our characters don't demonstrate a lot of adaptability or ingenuity so much as timing and luck, and there's a distinct callback to England during the Blitz. Interestingly, \"Wind\" was Ballard's first novel (1961) and not one he considered \"serious\", probably because he hadn't ladened it with the necessary '60s/'70s-era angst found in 1962's \"Drowned\".\n\nBut no big surprises here. We have left the optimistic, science-as-a-way-out, SF of the '50s, and are well into the \"man can do nothing in the face of nature\" phase of SF, which at least hasn't given way to the \"man screwed everything up\" phase of SF yet."
