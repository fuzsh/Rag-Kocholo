        "text": "The Drowned World (1962)\n\nCrash (1973)\n\nMillennium People (2003)\n\nWhen I read JG Ballard, I go into a particular kind of trance. The effect of his books isn't comparable to those of any other writer. His prose, right from the beginning, has a mesmerising pace, rhythm and decorum all its own. Even more remarkably, Ballard has established his own set of visionary locations. Plenty of other writers now fictionally venture into multistorey carparks, airport hospital wards, decaying hotels, but they do so in the knowledge that they're trespassing on Ballard's territory. He was here first; he was the pioneer - back when these places were seen as totally unliterary. What could possibly happen on a motorway embankment that was of interest?\n\nBallard's first four novels, The Wind from Nowhere, The Drowned World, The Drought and The Crystal World, can be read as a series of variations on the global catastrophe novel. Some critics have discovered an elemental programme within the quartet: world-death by air, water, fire and earth. Whether or not this is the case, Ballard was definitely experimenting with different ends for civilisation. In the wake of his bestselling autobiographical novel The Empire of the Sun and his most recent autobiography, Miracles of Life, it's easy to trace glib links between Ballard's boyhood in a wartime Shanghai internment camp and the collapsed-then-resurrected ecologies and communities that so often feature in his novels. Ballard has always been remarkably chipper on the subject of his imprisonment. And, through the total destruction of normal human society, his invariably male heroes are able to find some sort of fulfilment.\n\nThe Drowned World is perhaps the most mesmeric of these four novels. It contains a series of hyperreal descriptions: a cityscape beneath waves, suburban swamps and lagoons. Too much contemporary art is compared with a state of waking dream, but in this novel Ballard really comes close. He's always been a devotee of the surrealists (Max Ernst is a close companion-in-imagery), and in The Drowned World this works in synch with the hero Kerans' quest to adapt and survive.\n\nIn mid-period Ballard, represented by Crash, the catastrophic collapse moves inside the characters' heads. Guided by the monomaniac Vaughan, our hero enters a society-within-a-society - life as a sterile mating game in which first contact can be made only by car crash. Mechanistic paraphilia has replaced any sort of romantic love or genital sex. The human body is attractive only when seen within the intersecting frames of car door, seatbelt, steering wheel - preferably smashed and warped. The flesh comes to erotic life only once violated.\n\nOf Ballard's most recent novels, the most successful, in my opinion, is Millennium People, which redoes the collapsing society but in a comic mode. A middle-class revolution takes place within Chelsea Marina, an exclusive Thames-side estate. Unsurprisingly, the results are inept and farcical. Ballard's writing, though still focused on the weird forms human normality can take, is gently tickled by our creative misdemeanours rather than awed by them."
