        "text": "Set in junkyards, abandoned waysides and disaster zones, J.G. Ballard’s fiction assumes waste to be integral to the (material and symbolic) post-war landscape, and to reveal discomfiting truths about the ecological and social effects of mass production and consumption. Nowhere perhaps is this more evident than in his so-called climate novels, The Drowned World (1962), The Drought (1965), originally published as The Burning World, and The Crystal World (1966)—texts which Ballard himself described as “form[ing] a trilogy.” In their forensic examination of the ecological effects of the Anthropocene era, these texts at least superficially fulfil the task environmental humanist Kate Rigby sees as paramount for eco-critics and writers of speculative fiction alike: that is, they tell the story of our volatile environment in ways that will productively inform our responses to it, and ultimately enable “new ways of being and dwelling.” At the same time however, there is nothing straightforwardly redemptive about them: Ballard appears to suggest that the most interesting thing about eco-catastrophe is the non-human remains that it will leave in its wake, and the non-human life-forms these remnants might breed. This article explores Ballard’s treatment of waste and material devastation in The Drowned World, The Drought, and The Crystal World, focussing specifically on their desistance from critiquing industrial modernity, and their exploitation, instead, of the narrative potential of its deleterious effects. I am especially interested in examining the relationship between the three novels, whose strikingly similar storylines approach ecological catastrophe from multiple angles. To this end, I refrain from discussing Ballard’s two other climate novels, The Wind from Nowhere (1962), which he himself dismissed outright as a “piece of hackwork” he wrote in the space of a day, and Hello America (1981), which departs from the 1960s texts in its thematic structure. More broadly, I am interested in examining the ways in which the articulations of waste in these texts anticipate contemporary discussions in discard studies of waste’s “liveliness.”\n\nThis paper offers a discussion of J. G. Ballard's first four novels, The Wind From Nowhere (1962), The Drowned World (1962), The Drought (1965), and The Crystal World (1966) that centers on their portrayal of environmental transformation. Drawing on revised conceptualizations of the second law of thermodynamics and recent materialist scholarship, I illustrate how Ballard invokes material transformations that are ambivalently coded as terminal stasis and morphogenesis. In anticipations of the paradigm of the Anthropocene and ecocritical approaches to global climate change, Ballard's novels re-embed the human in an ecology of inhuman forces and modes of self-organization that radically challenge entrenched ontological divisions and systemic boundaries. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which emergent structures, such as hurricanes and crystals identify his landscapes as dissipative systems far from equilibrium and rife with potential for the spontaneous generation of form. This resonance with scientific frameworks reveals itself in poetic registers that parallelize metaphors of life and death, and hinge on an estrangement of not only landscape, but also temporality, thus literalizing what it might mean to understand the human as a geological subject in the age of the Anthropocene.\n\nThis is a paper I presented at JG Ballard and the Natural World, a one-day conference held by the School of English at Birmingham City University. It is an extract of a longer article I am submitting for publication. Set in junkyards, abandoned waysides and disaster zones, J.G. Ballard’s fiction assumes waste to be integral to the (material and symbolic) post-war landscape, and to reveal discomfiting truths about the ecological and social effects of mass production and consumption. Nowhere perhaps is this more evident than in his so-called climate novels, The Drowned World (1962), The Drought (1965), originally published as The Burning World, and The Crystal World (1966) —texts which Ballard himself described as “form[ing] a trilogy.” This paper examines the representation of material wreckage in these three texts, focussing specifically on the role of waste in “making new” the worlds the characters inhabit. What renders these texts fascinating, and sets them apart from much of climate fiction, is their desistance from critiquing industrial modernity, and their exploitation, instead, of the narrative potential of industrial modernity’s deleterious effects. I am especially interested in examining the relationship between the three novels, whose strikingly similar storylines approach ecological catastrophe from multiple angles. More broadly, I am interested in examining the ways in which the articulations of waste in these texts anticipate contemporary discussions in discard studies of waste’s “liveliness.” The paper examines: the interplay of basic pragmatism and the Surrealist ethos of re-use in the characters’ recuperative practices; the centrality of interpreting remains and forging new things from discards to the very plot; the extent to which the characters’ constructions of the future involves a radical re-thinking of the categories of value/valueless; and the extent to which the re-use of waste (objects and landscapes) is explicitly framed as a physical embodiment of self-transformation.\n\nJ.G. Ballard is one of the most influential British authors of the 20th century. Renowned for his surrealist works of fiction, Ballard delivered the primary examples of climate fiction. The Drowned World is J.G. Ballard’s second novel of a post-apocalyptic quadrilogy. The novel tells the story of a scientist’s quest for survival amidst a global flood. Moreover, Beatrice Dahl happens to be the only woman left alive in London and the sole woman character of the novel itself. To that end, ecofeminism is a comprehensive theory which combines feminist thought with the school of ecocriticism. The Drowned World is a novel that incorporates notions of social ecofeminism through the character of Beatrice. This article aims to provide a social ecofeminist analysis of Ballard’s The Drowned World by focusing on the character of Beatrice Dahl. All in all, the relationship between patriarchal capitalism and the oppression of women and nature is exposed in the article with specific references to the novel.\n\nEmbodiment of apocalyptic imagination has been a major theme in which many writers have pointed it out especially from the midst of twentieth century onwards. Earth today is vulnerable and would be so dangerous for future generation from now on. Although, J. G. Ballard&apos;s narrations do not create an ordinary apocalyptic apprehension of human abolition, but he enters the core of the apocalyptic theme by intertwining our world with an altering people&apos;s psyche who try to develop a new relationship with nature. This paper examines Ballard&apos;s The Drowned World (1962) from the view of the human psyche in an apocalyptic setting. It follows and analyzes the characters of Dr. Robert Kerans (a biologist) and his team in which they are transformed in the story – both mentally and physically.\n\nThe Drought is the third work in a trilogy of climate fiction novels published in the early 1960s. As the primary examples of climate fiction, The Drought stands out in the series as the novel in which the catastrophe is fully caused by human activities. Thus, suitable for ecocritical analysis, this article analyzes The Drought from a social ecological perspective in specific. Moreover, social ecology is a philosophy and movement that emerged The Drought from a social ecological perspective and reveals the implications that the author foresaw concerning the future of our planet. While criticizing the global climate crisis is also mentioned as a possible solution to maintain a harmonious existence that end, it has been concluded that Ballard targets the capitalist world order by exposing the devastating consequences of a climatic cataclysm caused by excessive industrial activities.\n\nEschatological jouissance is defined here as a grim pleasure in the failure of the world. It is a feature of J. G. Ballard's prescient ecological disaster fiction of the 1960s as well as of the sardonic treatment of ecological idealism in his later fiction. Expressions of pleasure in the end of the world can be seen as forming a counter genre to utopia and, in philosophical terms, as a refusal of humanism. Humanism is defined here as the insistence to see the world from a human point of view. Anti-humanism and a concurring openness to eschatological jouissance are elements of existentialism and of poststructuralism, together with Marxism the main alternatives to humanism proposed in the twentieth century. Ecocriticism, in some of its strands, is another such replacement of humanism in which eschatological jouissance plays a significant role. Humanism may not seem a promising attitude for dealing with the ecological disasters we face, concerned as it is in the first place with the comfort of human beings. Still, it is argued here that humanism includes an awareness of the parochialism of human sympathies and that an appeal to the need to extend its sympathies to non-human sharers of the planet might well be heeded. Eschatological jouissance, as a feature of dystopian fiction and imagination, will provide the needed shudder to nudge us into such an extension of our sympathies.\n\nThis article examines J. G. Ballard’s The Drowned World (1962), focussing on its imagination of watery submergence as a vehicle for interrogating problematic boundaries of subject and ecology. The article argues that the text encodes the figure of submergence as both a manifest, representable narrative experience, and as a kind of latent structural logic which explains the entanglement of human and nonhuman at a material level. This reading builds upon recent work on the novel, and more generally of Ballard’s oeuvre, which figures it as proto-cli-fi, suggesting that it is a text which both predicts and responds to questions of human finitude and ecological imbrication raised by the Anthropocene era. The article engages with the philosophy of Timothy Morton to show how the novel places stable notions of anthropocentric mastery of environment under question, and analyses the aesthetic strategies employed by Ballard in order to do so, suggesting that he depicts ambiguous bodily and ecological limits and disturbing presences in ways which accord to the modes of “weird”, “eerie”, and the “uncanny” as defined by Mark Fisher. Ballard’s submergent imaginary describes an active ecological space which repeatedly revokes anthropocentric frameworks of comprehension and thus engages with problems of spatial and temporal scale in a manner which has been thus far radically under-theorised.\n\nThis Masters Dissertation studies the tropes of contemporary English speaking Western climate fiction. The climate crisis is perhaps the most urgent critical collective issue that the contemporary global population faces today. It is therefore a matter of shared concern to imaginatively address these meteorological and anthropogenic issues through such a means as literature. This dissertation investigates the underlying tropes of Western climate fiction and seeks to understand how they may be better used to create awareness and galvanise action for mitigating climate crisis. Using critical and theoretical analyses of predominantly American contemporary novels, this dissertation examines the influence of different literary tropes that are widely used in climate fiction, such as humanitarian extinction, the child saviour and class discrimination. These are complicated through other themes of interest, which include consumerist culture, legacy, religion and the poetics of remains, authenticity and responsibility. Broad tropes of importance to this discussion include urban, wilderness, pastoral and collapse motifs. The themes are explored in conjunction with existentialism, post-structuralism, idealism and morality. Key critics include Greg Garrard, Astrid Bracke, Ursula Heise, Rebekah Sheldon and Frederic Jameson. Discussion is orientated towards the efficacy of these tropes as literary constructs within any didactic narrative or social activism.\n\nG. Ballard’s “Billennium” presents apocalyptic consciousness. This paper argues that Ballard uses the rhetoric of apocalypse to visualize the impending disaster caused by the problem of overpopulation. It attempts to analyze the story in the light of Friedrich Buell, Greg Garrard and Lawrence Buell’s concept of apocalypse within environmental discourses. The nature of apocalypse in the story is not the usual presentation of violent or cataclysmic end of everything but comic in the sense that it ‘unveils’ or ‘uncovers’ the weaknesses and follies of human beings such as greed for money and power that are responsible for the looming threats of the problem of overcrowding and loss of space in the near future."
