        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Legacy Recordings, the catalog division of Sony Music Entertainment, has exclusively licensed the North American catalog rights to recordings made by The Kinks for RCA Records and Arista in the years from 1971 to 1985.\n\nOne of the great and abiding bands to emerge during the first wave of the British Pop Invasion of 1964, The Kinks released an album, an EP and four singles that year--\"Long Tall Sally,\" \"You Still Want Me,\" \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\"--arguably inventing hard rock with the opening riff of \"You Really Got Me\" while introducing American R&B to British music hall vaudeville. The genius of The Kinks became more apparent with each subsequent release and, throughout the 1970s and 80s, the group recorded a series of unprecedented album masterworks, showcasing the keen observational songwriting of Ray Davies and the band's unforgettable chords and melodies.\n\nOn September 9, 16 classic Kinks album titles (listed below) were remastered and made available as hi-resolution digital downloads.\n\nRay Davies, recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 12, said, \"It is terrific to be reunited with the company that inspired and was involved with one of the finest Kinks albums, Phobia.\"\n\nOn October 14, Legacy Recordings will celebrate 50 years of Kinkdom with the historic release of The Essential Kinks, the first-ever career-spanning retrospective anthology comprised of key recordings made for the Pye/Reprise, RCA, Arista and Columbia labels (track list below), and fully endorsed by the band. \"I've never heard a Kinks song that I didn't like,\" writes David Bowie in his newly-penned, revelatory liner notes for The Essential Kinks.\"Of course, from their noisy and brash beginnings, the Kinks have come to stand for some of the most enduring and heart-clutching pop of all time. They are in the gut of every British song-writer who followed them and are indisputably a cornerstone of everything pop and rock. I love 'em. The world loves 'em.\" The Essential Kinks may be pre-ordered at Amazon.\n\nOn November 10, Legacy will release an expanded CD/DVD deluxe edition of Muswell Hillbillies, The Kinks' 1971 masterpiece of working class social observation, a musical statement remarkably relevant in today's world. Newly remastered from the original analog tapes, Muswell Hillbillies includes the original album in its entirety as well as nine bonus tracks (seven of them previously unavailable in North America), and a DVD of rare 1972 television appearances (never released in North America). The Kinks, Muswell Hillbillies, Legacy Edition, may be pre-ordered at Amazon.\n\nA 2LP 12\" vinyl edition of Muswell Hillbillies, including the original album and a selection of bonus material from the expanded Legacy Edition, will be available later this year.\n\nThe Essential Kinks Release Date: October 14, 2014\n\nDisc One:\n\n1.
