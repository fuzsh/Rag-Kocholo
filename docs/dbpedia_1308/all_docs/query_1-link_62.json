        "text": "Rock musicians in the first decade of the 21st century found themselves in a paradoxical situation. On the one hand, the business model that had driven (and been driven by) the rise of rock since the late 1960s—the hugely profitable manufacture, promotion, and distribution of albums—seemed to be in terminal crisis. On the other hand, the live music sector, long regarded as uncompetitive commercially and therefore dependent on record company support, flourished. The prices people were prepared to pay for concert tickets rose dramatically from the mid-1990s, and a new kind of multinational music corporation emerged, led by Live Nation, the live-music division of Clear Channel.\n\nIf the value of live music rose as the amount of money people were prepared to spend on CDs in the digital age fell, at least part of the live music industry’s new profitability was an effect of its own use of digital technology. New Internet-based ticketing companies became significant international businesses in themselves. Clear Channel spun off Live Nation as an independent company in order to avoid accusations of monopoly, but Live Nation’s subsequent merger with Ticketmaster, the dominant global ticketing agency, led to new concerns about competitiveness. Though the merger was ultimately approved by the U.S. government in January 2010, Live Nation Entertainment (as the combined corporate entity would be known) was required to license its proprietary ticketing software to its largest competitor, Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), and to sell its Paciolan ticketing and event management division to Comcast Spectacor, a subsidiary of media giant Comcast.\n\nCrucial to the shift in the live-music economy was the crowd-drawing power of classic rock acts such as the Rolling Stones and the Police, whose tours topped annual earnings lists. While live shows had once been subsidized by record companies’ promotional budgets—live performance being used to sell records—now tours were the source of the major rock groups’ continued income, and new recordings were released to promote new tours. David Bowie explained the situation in an interview he gave to the New York Times in June 2002:\n\nI don’t even know why I would want to be on a label in a few years, because I don’t think it’s going to work by labels and by distribution systems in the same way.…I’m fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years, and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing. Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity, so it’s like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again. You’d better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that’s really the only unique situation that’s going to be left.\n\nFrom one perspective, then, rock in the 21st century sounded much as it had in previous decades. The major acts that had emerged since the 1960s, from the Stones to U2, remained the biggest earners, with Coldplay the only new addition to their ranks. From another perspective, however, the digital revolution had the odd consequence of reviving pre-corporate rock methods of musical consumption. The iPod, a portable music player that enabled people to carry around personal libraries of their favorite tracks in a digital format, made the single song (rather than the album) the focus of personal consumption. Rock festivals, which in Europe in particular came to dominate the way new acts and releases were marketed, resembled the kind of package show—a variety of acts on stage—that the Beatles had once played. Moreover, for new bands such as Arctic Monkeys and Kings of Leon, social networking Web sites were crucial to the way in which audiences could be built from the bottom up, initial enthusiasm spreading by word of mouth rather than by top-down media campaigns. The “local” buzz that has always driven youthful rock and roll now described a sense of musical excitement with an immediate global resonance. The sites for musical discoveries were MySpace and YouTube rather than radio stations or record stores (the most obvious casualties of the consumer shift from CD to MP3 formats). And it was on the Internet, too, that communities of record collectors and musical cultists flourished; for example, the continued interest in vinyl recordings, as both aesthetic and sonic objects, was fueled by specialist Web sites."
