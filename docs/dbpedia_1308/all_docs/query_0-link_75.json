        "text": "Come Dancing\n\nThe Kinks - Come Dancing\n\nIf The Kinks had split up in the mid-1970s, they would have been a festival-headlining band for their 1990s or '00s reunion.\n\nInstead, they just kept plugging away as their star slowly faded. They never hit the success of their '60s heyday, but there's a sprinkling of fantastic music across their later years.\n\nThis 1982 single from the State of Confusion album was a rare late-era hit for the band, going to number 6 in the US (their joint-highest ever single there) and number 12 back home, while its fine Julien Temple-directed video got a fair bit of play on MTV.\n\n'Come Dancing' is inspired by the tragic death of Ray Davies's sister Rene, who died dancing at the Lyceum ballroom when she was just 31, apparently the same evening she had given Ray his first guitar as a gift.\n\nWhere Have All the Good Times Gone\n\nWhere Have All The Good Times Gone\n\nOriginally the B-side to the admittedly superior 'Till The End of the Day', 'Where Have All The Good Times Gone' was still strong enough to appear on the band's third album, 1965's The Kinks Kontroversy.\n\n\"Our tour manager at the time, who was a lot older than us, said, 'That's a song a 40-year-old would write. I don't know where you get that from',\" Ray said.\n\n\"But I was taking inspiration from older people around me. I'd been watching them in the pubs, talking about taxes and job opportunities.\"\n\nIt's been covered over the years by David Bowie, Van Halen and Supergrass.\n\nSet Me Free\n\nSet Me Free\n\nOne of the band's more introspective singles, 'Set Me Free' tells the story of a fella wanting his love to \"set him free\", if he can't have her all to himself.\n\nIt reached 23 in the US and number nine back home, and has the distinction of being the band's first song to appear in a film – Ken Loach's BBC film Up The Junction.\n\nDedicated Follower of Fashion\n\nDedicated Follower Of Fashion\n\nA cheeky dig at the London scenesters clogging up the streets, 'Dedicated Follower of Fashion' had a nod at The Scarlet Pimpernel (\"they seek him here, they seek him there\") and was inspired by Ray's fisticuffs with an actual designer at a party.\n\nThe song The Kinks embrace a vaudeville/music hall sound for a standalone single that went all the way to number four in the UK in 1966.\n\nDead End Street\n\nDead End Street (2020 - Remaster)\n\nAnother one of the band's stunning non-album singles, 'Dead End Street' mixed up both sides of the Kinks' '60s sensibilities – music hall and rock 'n' roll – shot through with a bit of trad jazz for good measure.\n\n\"'Dead End Street' was the epitome, to me, of what the Kinks were all about,\" said Dave in his memoir.\n\n\"A song full of character, pathos, yet containing an underlying sense of hope. Reflecting a fondness for the past but at the same time expressing a determination and yearning for change.\n\n\"Anguished voices calling to a heartless world. A world where the plight of the ordinary person mattered little. \"\n\nIt was recorded in the brief period in 1966 where John Dalton had replaced Peter Quaife on bass after the latter had suffered a scooter accident, and reached number 5 in the UK singles chart.\n\nI’m Not Like Everybody Else\n\nI'm Not Like Everybody Else (Mono Mix)\n\nRay Davies wrote most Kinks songs himself and sung them too. Dave wrote a few which he took lead vocals on.\n\n'I'm Not Like Everybody Else' was a bit of an exception, with Ray writing the storming proto-punk track for The Animals who inexplicably turned it down, so Dave took lead vocals to mix things up.\n\nIt was originally released as the B-side to the much more gentle 'Sunny Afternoon', but quickly became a fan favourite and pops up on all their best-ofs.\n\nTired of Waiting For You\n\nTired Of Waiting For You\n\nReleased ahead of second album Kinda Kinks on which it appeared, 'Tired of Waiting For You' topped the charts in the UK and scored as best-for-the-band number six in the US.\n\nDave Davies has called it the perfect pop song and it's hard to argue.\n\n\"The recording went well but there was something missing and it was my raunchy guitar sound,\" said Dave.\n\n\"Ray and I were worried that putting that heavy-sounding guitar on top of a ponderous song might ruin it. Luckily it enhanced the recording, giving it a more cutting, emotional edge.\"\n\nScattered\n\nThe Kinks - Scattered\n\nThe Kinks last album Phobia had came out in 1993, just before the peak of a Britpop scene that would give them the credit and love they had been unfairly missing the last couple of decades odd.\n\nIt was too long and padded out somewhat, but its highlights proved what those who had kept up long knew – the Kinks could always surprise you with a great single at any point in their career.\n\nThe closing track of Phobia and the band's last original single 'Scattered' was a beauiful study of mortality (\"To the fields we are scattered / From the day we are born\") that was dedicated to Ray's late mum Annie Florence Davies and friend Carol Bryans.\n\nThe Village Green Preservation Society\n\nThe Kinks - The Village Green Preservation Society (Official Audio)\n\nIt's hard to pick out single moments from the Kinks' excellent run of concept albums. That's partly because the songs do work better in context on the LPs, but also because they were so packed with fantastic tunes.\n\nWe're choosing 'The Village Green Preservation Society', the opener/title track from 1968's classic because how much melody and joy it squeezes into its less-than-three minutes.\n\n\"Somebody said that one of the things the Kinks have been doing for the last three years is preserving nice things from the past, so I thought I'd write a song which said this,\" Ray explained of the lyrics.\n\nVictoria\n\nVictoria (2019 Remaster)\n\nAnother concept album opener, the stomping, satirical 'Victoria' opened 1969's Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) stalled outside the top 60 in the US and only scraped to number 33 in the UK.\n\nIts stature has grown though, helped along by a punky cover by The Fall in 1988 and a more recent version by The Kooks, who frequently record at Ray Davies's Konk studios.\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\nCelluloid Heroes (2022 Remaster)\n\nTaken from (and its lyrics giving the title to) 1972's Everybody's in Show-Biz album, 'Celluloid Heroes' is one of the Kinks finest post-1960s moments.\n\nDave hasn't always said the loveliest things about Ray over the years, but he was effusive in his praise for this single, which namechecks total icons Greta Garbo, Rudolph Valentino, Bela Lugosi, Bette Davis, George Sanders, Marilyn Monroe and Mickey Rooney.\n\n\"One of my favourite songs ever, by anybody,\" he told Guitar World. \"I remember when we were just starting out down the road with tidying up the lyrics.\n\n\"That really filled me with a lot of emotion because it is quite an incredible idea anyway, all those stars, names and handprints being on those stars.\n\n\"There are all these great stars immortalised on pavement, in concrete.\"\n\nTill The End of the Day\n\nTill the End of the Day (2014 - Remaster)\n\nOne of those powerful, punky, power-chord-driven early Kinks singles that elevated them above the throng of beat bands that came in the wake of The Beatles.\n\n'Till The End of the Day' went to number 8 in the UK and appeared on The Kink Kontroversy album.\n\n\"That song was about freedom, in the sense that someone's been a slave or locked up in prison,' said Ray.\n\n\"It's a song about escaping something. I didn't know it was about my state of mind.\"\n\nA Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy\n\nA Rock 'n Roll Fantasy\n\nNot just the Kinks' greatest single outside the 1960s, but one of their very best songs full stop.\n\nWith songs like 'You Really Got Me', the band had been a definite influence on the punk scene unfolding all around them, but this standout moment of 1978's Misfits was a tearjerking, soaring ballad.\n\nIt told the story of a band – presumably the Kinks themselves – as things all seem to be falling apart (\"You say you want out, want to start anew / Throw in your hand, break up the band\")\n\nDays\n\nAfter the relative flop of 'Wonderboy', the Kinks got back up the charts (in the UK at least) with the introspective 'Days', which got to number 12 over here.\n\nIt's a beautiful, tender song about love and loss (\"I bless the light that lights on you, believe me\"), and it's definitely worth digging out the a capella version from the Sunny Afternoon stage musical.\n\nLola\n\nThe Kinks - Lola (Official Lyrics Video)\n\nNot written, as legend says, after Ray Davies dated Warhol superstar Candy Darling (the two only shared a friendly dinner).\n\n\"It was a real experience in a club,\" explained Ray. \"I was asked to dance by somebody who was a fabulous looking woman.\n\n\"I said, 'No thank you'. And she went in a cab with my manager straight afterwards. It's based on a personal experience. But not every word.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Dave claims he wrote the music for the song (which is credited to Ray alone), and it's become one of the band's most enduring hits.\n\nSome radio stations were turned off by the twist of Lola's identity, while the BBC initially banned the song for a much more prosaic reason. That champagne tasted just like Coca-Cola... a brand name being endorsed on the Beeb was a big no-no.\n\nRay is said to have made a 6,000 mile round trip from LA to London and back again in the middle of a US tour to record the phrase \"cherry cola\" for the single version to keep Auntie happy. It went to number 2 in the UK and number 9 in the US.\n\nThis Time Tomorrow\n\nThe Kinks - This Time Tomorrow (Official Audio)\n\nNestled on the Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One. album was one of Ray Davies's most lovely melodies and contemplative lyrics (\"This time tomorrow, where will we be? / On a spaceship somewhere sailing across any empty sea\")\n\n\"I felt that I'd lost contact with my family,\" Ray explained.\n\n\"Because I'd been in a pop music bubble for five years, and I didn't know the people around me anymore.\n\n\"'This Time Tomorrow' was about transience, and an ephemeral world. Clouds, and where do we play tomorrow, and what am I doing as a person tomorrow?\n\n\"It's a floating song, and I was floating into a different era. Going with the flow for a while, until I work out where I want to be.\"\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nThe Kinks - You Really Got Me (Official Audio)\n\nWhere it really all began. Sure the Kinks had already released a cover of 'Long Tall Sally' and the self-penned 'You Still Want Me', but it was 'You Really Got Me' that gave them their first charting single, and also proved the archetype for their early hits.\n\nWritten on the piano, earlier versions were bluesier, but that was swapped out for the scuzzy power chords and Dave Davies riff that pre-empted punk by well over a decade.\n\n\"When I first heard it I said, 'S**t, it doesn't matter what you do with this, it's a number one song',\" said producer Shel Talmy\n\n\"It could have been done in waltz time and it would have been a hit.\"\n\nA hit it was, going in at number 7 in the US and all the way to number one in the UK.\n\nSunny Afternoon\n\nSunny Afternoon (Remastered)\n\nA brother to The Beatles' moany 'Taxman' (\"There's one for you, nineteen for me\"), 'Sunny Afternoon' also referenced the high top rate of tax levied by Harold Wilson's Labour government of the time, though from a quirkier angle of drunken aristocrat (the taxman's taken all my dough / and left me in my stately home\").\n\n\"At the time I wrote Sunny Afternoon I couldn't listen to anything,\" said Ray of the music hall-inspired song, which went all the way to number one in the UK and 14 in the US.\n\n\"I was only playing The Greatest Hits of Frank Sinatra and Dylan's 'Maggie's Farm' – I just liked its whole presence, I was playing the Bringing It All Back Home LP along with my Frank Sinatra and Glenn Miller and Bach—it was a strange time.\n\n\"I thought they all helped one another, they went into the chromatic part that's in the back of the song.\"\n\nWaterloo Sunset\n\nThe Kinks - Waterloo Sunset (Official Audio)\n\nWe were spoiled for choice for all-time great singles putting this list together. Any number of other bands would gladly have taken any of these songs as their number one.\n\nFor The Kinks we've had to go with Something Else track and 1967 single 'Waterloo Sunset'.\n\n\"I didn't think to make it about Waterloo, initially, but I realised the place was so very significant in my life,\" said Ray.\n\n\"I was in St Thomas' Hospital when I was really ill and the nurses would wheel me out on the balcony to look at the river.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's about the two characters – and the aspirations of my sisters' generation who grew up during the Second World War.\n\n\"It's about the world I wanted them to have. That, and then walking by the Thames with my first wife and all the dreams that we had.\"\n\nIt unbelievably failed to chart in the US (maybe the talk Waterloo Station was too parochial for them?) but got to number 2 in the UK and frequently pops up on \"best song ever\" lists wherever you read them.\n\nIt's been covered over the years by Cathy Dennis, David Bowie and The Jam."
