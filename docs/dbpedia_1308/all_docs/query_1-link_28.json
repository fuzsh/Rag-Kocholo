This makes their sound heavier and more aggressive. They also often mix in elements of Southern rock and blues, which gives their music a unique flavor.

While traditional country often focuses on acoustic instruments and lyrics about rural life, rock music is known for its heavier sound, reliance on electric instruments, and focus on melody and harmony. In addition to this, rock music often has a more energetic live performance style, and its songs are typically longer than those of traditional country.\n\nMany people view rock music as less traditional than traditional country music, with a sound that is influenced by blues, psychedelia, and rockabilly. Rock music also typically has a devoted fan base that is passionate about the band and its music. Albums released by rock bands are typically released on independent labels, rather than major labels.\n\nRock music has been able to crossover into the mainstream and achieves commercial success in a way that traditional country music has not. This is likely because rock music is seen as more rebellious and less conformist than traditional country.\n\nLyrics that often tell stories or depict rural life.\n\nCountry rock lyrics often tell stories or depict rural life.
