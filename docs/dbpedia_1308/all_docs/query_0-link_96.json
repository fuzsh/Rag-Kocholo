        "text": "I hate having to play catch up on the weekend as I really wanted to engage in GTPWTW but unanticipated detours with work as consumed much of my time recently…\n\nAnyway, picking up where I left off after “Around the Dial…”\n\nGive the People What They Want - The shouty, repetitive, virtually melody-less chorus is evocative of my least favorite characteristics of “Low Budget” tracks (and no surprise it was conceived during those session) and yet I like it nonetheless. Maybe it’s the verses that won me over—arguably Ray finally getting his history lesson into a song where it doesn’t feel labored, e.g. “History,” “Nobody Gives,” “Education.” It rocks whereas those three don't, though as Kinks rockers go I rank it mid-pack among very strong competition. Perhaps it succeeds for me simply because it’s among a collection of strong tracks, elevating it somewhat in a sort of high-tide-lifts-all-boats kind of way.\n\nKiller Eyes — Musically it’s almost like a demo, fleshed out with a bed of synthesizer under it to make it feel more polished. I don’t mind the demo-sounding part. Not so crazy about the synth. No knock on Mr. Gibbon’s talents, but I wonder how different—and possibly better?—the music would be if the synth was replaced with Pye-era harmonies or RCA-era horns. Anyway…minor quibbles because subject-wise…\n\n…welcome back, Ray. Don’t let the surface topic of a killer distract you from the power of this song. This is a layered lyric, the depth of it being not about the killer, but about the parents of one. The heartbreak of having a child who grew up to turn into this. Note how Ray doesn’t need to overly say ‘I’m the parent.’ He reveals it in the details: the insight into the killer’s childhood that only a parent would have (“you cried the way other children cried.”) The little sister still in the household. These are the kinds of detail writing the past few albums have largely lacked, so welcome back subtle Ray the lyricist of 1966-71 where detailed touches conveyed empathy in such winners as Rosie Won’t You Please Come Home. Big Black Smoke. Two Sisters. Some Mother’s Son. Oklahoma USA. Killer Eyes doesn’t have that kind of poetry, of course—the wording is pretty stark—but it comes closer to my favorite version of the Kinks than anything else on this record.\n\nPredictable - For all Clive Davis’s radio-friendly marketing savvy, how does he determine this offbeat number is a single? After trying to steer the band into syrupy ballads like “Brother,’ or encouraging the aping of existing formulas on Low Budget, maybe…just maybe…now Clive is starting to ‘get’ the Kinks, opening the door to releasing things like “Come Dancing’ that don’t hew to rock radio expectations. “Predictable” is different—that chugging, plodding pace. There’s nothing else on the record quite like this one and God Bless the Kinks for it. It teases like it is going to go ska at a few places but never commits, which makes its address that special Kinks-ian place. It’s a great track that I didn’t appreciate at first. It has grown on me over the years. Another winner.\n\nAdd It Up — One of those rare Kinks tracks I have zero strong thoughts one way or another. It’s just sort of ‘there’ without leaving an impression. I suppose if I had to ID a weak link on side one, I’d say this is it. But it’s not a weak song…which simply points to what a great first half GTPWTW is.\n\nDestroyer — It’s gimmicky in its employment of a classic riff, but beyond that my take on this is pretty much identical to my take on another classic riff appropriation, “Catch Me Now I’m Falling”: a number that highlights the band members going through their paces—which they do well—but not much substance beyond that. This one hasn’t aged well for me. Probably my least favorite on the disc. Combined with the next song—coming Monday—side two’s beginning is the least interesting section of GTPWTW for me.\n\nThe Kinks 1981/82 Touring.\n\nGive The People What They Want was recorded between May and June 1981, and released in August in the US, and January 1982 In Europe... as we already spoke about, due to wanting to do a full video album... which of course never happened.\n\nThe 1981 shows started on the last two days of April 1981, in Ireland.\n\nOver the course of May the band were touring around the UK. They also did 4 UK shows in June, and their first US gig of 1981 was August 5th in New Orleans.\n\nAugust was a fairly intense US focus with 14 US shows and The Reading Festival in the UK on Aug 3oth.\n\nAug 14 - The Forum, California\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nBird Dog\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nYo-Yo\n\nTired of Waiting\n\nKiller's Eyes\n\nLola (tease) / Blues\n\nLola\n\nBack to Front\n\nToo Serious\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nMisfits\n\nCabaret\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nGallon Of Gas\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\n20th Century Man\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nencore\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nPressure\n\nTwist And Shout\n\n2nd encore\n\nLow Budget\n\nStop Your Sobbing\n\nBatman\n\nSuperman\n\nAug 19 - Hollywood Palladium\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nWhere Have All The Good Times Gone\n\nBird Dog\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nYo-Yo\n\nLola\n\nToo Serious\n\nBack to Front\n\nMisfits\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nA Gallon of Gas\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nCome On Now\n\nLow Budget\n\nTwist And Shout\n\nDestroyer\n\nPressure\n\nAug 21 - Greek Theater, Berkeley\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nBird Dog\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nYo-Yo\n\nLola\n\nWhere Have All the Good Times Gone\n\nTired of Waiting for You\n\nToo Serious\n\nBack to Front\n\nMisfits\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nGallon Of Gas\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\n20th Century Man\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nTwist And Shout\n\nWaterloo Sunset\n\nDavid Watts\n\nBetter Things\n\nPressure\n\nLow Budget\n\nSuperman\n\nAug 30 - Reading Festival\n\nTill the End of the Day\n\nVictoria\n\nAll Day and All of the Night\n\nPlastic Man\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nWaterloo Sunset\n\n(the only songs listed)\n\nIn September it was back to the USA, and also quite a few gigs in Canada.\n\nOctober had a few more gigs in the US, and then they seem to have had a short break.\n\nThe guys end up in Ireland again Nov 20th for their only November gig.\n\nThen in December they played eight shows in Germany between Dec 1 and Dec 10.\n\nIt's interesting that most of the shows seem to have Too Serious from Dave's glamour album.\n\nSep 21 - Veterans Memorial Auditorium, Columbus Ohio\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nLola\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nAll Day and All of the Night\n\nGive the People What They Want\n\nYo-Yo\n\nToo Serious\n\nDestroyer\n\nArt Lover\n\n(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\n\nA Gallon of Gas\n\n(The only songs listed)\n\nSep 25 - Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nDestroyer\n\nYo-Yo\n\nLola / Toronto Blues\n\nToo Serious\n\nArt Lover\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nBack to Front\n\nA Gallon of Gas\n\nTill the End of the Day\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\n20th Century Man\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nMisfits\n\nLow Budget\n\nBatman/Superman/Shakin' All Over\n\nLittle Queenie\n\nTwist And Shout\n\nOct 3 - Madison Square Garden\n\nOpening / Around the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nDestroyer\n\nYo-Yo\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nBetter Things\n\nLola / NYC Blues\n\nToo Serious\n\nArt Lover\n\nWaterloo Sunset\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nBack to Front / Get Back\n\nGallon Of Gas\n\nTill The End Of The Day\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\n20th Century Man\n\nKillers Eyes\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nMisfits\n\nLow Budget\n\nAdd It Up\n\nSuperman/Shakin' All Over\n\nPressure\n\nVillage Green Preservation Society\n\nTwist And Shout\n\nI'm assuming the MSG gig was a pretty big thing for them, and they seem to have really thought about the set list.\n\nJanuary 1982 and the band was back in the USA\n\nIn February it's nice to see the lads went to Australia playing in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth .... I scratch my head and wonder how I could have missed them, but I was 13, so I probably couldn't afford it or something. They played 10 Aussie gigs all up.\n\nFeb 19 - Hordern Pavillion, Sydney (final Aussie gig)\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nWhere Have All the Good Times Gone / Tired of Waiting for You\n\nCome On Now\n\nDestroyer\n\nYo-Yo\n\nLola\n\nDead End Street\n\nA Gallon of Gas\n\nLow Budget\n\nAdd It Up\n\nArt Lover\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\nTill The End Of The Day\n\nBernadette\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nencore\n\nGive the People What They Want\n\nPressure\n\nTwist And Shout\n\nStop Your Sobbing\n\nDavid Watts\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nFebruary rounded off with 4 shows in Japan.\n\nIn April we have the Essen show that would be the Rockpalast gig.\n\nApril 4 - Grugahalle, Essen\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nWhere Have All the Good Times Gone\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nCome On Now\n\nDestroyer\n\nYo-Yo\n\nLola\n\nDead End Street\n\nAdd It Up\n\nLow Budget\n\nArt Lover\n\nBack To Front\n\nGallon Of Gas\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\nTill The End Of The Day\n\nBernadette\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nPressure\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nStop Your Sobbing\n\nDavid Watts\n\nThe next set of gigs are in June and it's back to the USA.\n\n2 gigs in August\n\nThen the US Festival in September\n\nSept 4 - US Festival\n\nAround the Dial\n\nThe Hard Way\n\nWhere Have All the Good Times Gone\n\nCatch Me Now I'm Falling\n\nDestroyer\n\nYo-Yo\n\nLola\n\nEntertainment\n\nLow Budget\n\nBack to Front\n\nArt Lover\n\nCelluloid Heroes\n\nCome On Now\n\nGallon Of Gas\n\nTill The End Of The Day\n\nBernadette\n\nAll Day And All Of The Night\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nThe last shows in 1982 were in December with one show in Scotland and the rest around England. It's here that Come Dancing enters the set, and they were probably trying it out, perhaps refining it for the album they were recording over this period.... perhaps testing if it was a single.... which we know it was.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the sets I see, is that Destroyer and All Day And All Of The Night were generally both in the sets... Which is pretty interesting in itself... Definitely different songs, but obviously very similar, but the spacing in the set probably made it work ok."
