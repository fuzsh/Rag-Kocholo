        "text": "Be independent and free in actions.\n\nAristippus of Cyrene, ancient Greek philosopher.\n\nApril 13 may seem like an ordinary day to most people. However, few know that several interesting events from the world of music are associated with this date. For example, in 1962, the famous Star Club opened its doors for the first time, where the legendary “Fab Four” from Liverpool, namely The Beatles, performed. And in 1967, the famous Rolling Stones performed in Warsaw as part of a European tour. Both bands quickly became popular all over the world. But it is unknown how their fate would have turned out if it was not for the rise of rock and roll ten years earlier.\n\nThe exact history of the origin of this genre is difficult to track: however, it is known for sure that the new style spread in the 1950s, in the southern United States. In the post-war years, an atmosphere of calm and haste-free life reigned in the US. And the music, which mixed African-American motifs, country and blues, became a real revelation and a kind of challenge to society.\n\nThe term “rock and roll” was coined in 1952 by African American DJ Alan Freed.\n\nBut what was the first rock song? Was it Jackie Brenston’s “Rocket 88”? Maybe “Crazy Man Crazy” or “Rock Around The Clock” by Bill Haley?\n\nFor the majority of the genre enthusiasts, the latter option is the most obvious. Few know that Sonny Dae and His Knights were the first to perform this composition. But real success came with Bill Haley’s version, after the song was featured in the sensational film “Blackboard Jungle”. Haley sincerely believed in success and worked diligently on the musical arrangement and sound of the song, which subsequently influenced the careers of some rock bands.\n\n“I don’t know what made me pick up the guitar. Maybe “Rock Around The Clock”, which came out when I was ten?” pondered David Gilmour, the member of the rock band Pink Floyd.\n\nOver time, Bill Haley’s fame was overshadowed by new artists. Among them was the “king of rock and roll”, Elvis Presley. He was one of the most successful musicians in world history. For many people, Elvis is the first association with the entire genre. The musical genius did not live long, but managed to give the world a huge number of albums and singles, some of which are still considered classics. However, let’s focus on the sensational composition “Jailhouse Rock”. Incidentally, this song became the soundtrack to the eponymous film, in which Presley played the lead role.\n\nMusical revolution\n\nPresley’s work inspired many musicians: among them the famous “Fab Four” from Liverpool, who made a cultural and musical revolution and created a new genre: rock.\n\nThe creativity of The Beatles, changing from album to album, impressed not only with its sound but also with the themes addressed in the lyrics. Most people know the band for lyrical compositions like “Yesterday” and “Let It Be”, but there were times when the band performed with bold rock and roll motifs. “Twist and Shout” is one of the most expressive songs in the career of The Beatles, and it’s also a real test for the musicians’ vocal abilities.\n\nInteresting fact: originally, this track was composed in the rhythm and blues format.\n\n“Rock and roll is eternal because it is simple, there is nothing superfluous in it. His rhythm penetrates all barriers,” — that’s how John Lennon described rock music.\n\nTime will tell whether he was right about it, but the fact that the genre has been considered one of the most popular musical genres in the world for over seventy years is undeniable.\n\nA symbol of freedom and individuality\n\nRock and roll became popular not only because of its energy and drive, but also because it became a symbol of freedom and individuality. This was demonstrated by another British band, The Rolling Stones.\n\nThe musicians played not only in the rock and roll genre. They experimented extensively with various genres, including blues, psychedelic rock and funk, creating a unique sound. The clear influence of their music can be heard in the work of many modern rock bands. By the way, The Rolling Stones still perform and sell out stadiums.\n\n“Rollings” are more than just a musical group. They have become a symbol of freedom and individuality, embodying the spirit of the time and inspiring millions of people around the world. And their music and lifestyle continue to influence culture and society, making them true rock and roll legends. Due to their tremendous contributions to not only the music industry but also to society, the band has been included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nA little more than 10 years later, another legendary band from Foggy Albion — namely,Queen — received this honor. In their acclaimed hits, the musicians expressed the ideas of self-expression and tolerance. Their music embodies the spirit of rebellion and protest, while inspiring millions of people around the world. For example, the song “I Want to Break Free” became a symbol of every person’s desire for independence. The composition caused a huge resonance in society thanks to its lyrics and memorable video clip, in which the musicians dressed up as women from the popular TV series at the time “Coronation Street”. It is worth mentioning that the music of legendary band inspired the queen of outrageousness Lady Gaga, whose creative path we told about in one of our previous articles.\n\nYou have probably noticed that all rock musicians share a desire to be independent. After all, as Aristippus said:\n\n“Independence is the right to lead one’s own life. Be independent and free in actions.”\n\nRock and roll is not just a musical genre, but an entire cultural phenomenon that has influenced many aspects of our lives, including ways of thinking, fashion and social movements. Its rhythms and energy have become the voice of a generation seeking self-expression. Within rock culture, musicians encouraged listeners that everyone should not be afraid to express their thoughts, feelings and beliefs.\n\nRock and roll philosophy\n\nFans of rock musicians as well as the artists themselves have always promoted their ideas and views of the world openly and bravely. The lyrics carry not only catchy words and rhymes, but also the artists’ views on various social and political issues. One of the main aspects of rock and roll philosophy is its ability to unite people of different cultures, races and social classes. Even nowadays, people enjoy listening to songs that may be several times older than themselves and find answers to the questions they are concerned about in them.\n\nRock and roll was destined to become one of the most popular musical genres of the twentieth century. New genres were actively developing within it. And the subgenres that emerged in later times — pop-, punk-, psychedelic rock and others — still do not lose the impressive fan base gained in the last century."
