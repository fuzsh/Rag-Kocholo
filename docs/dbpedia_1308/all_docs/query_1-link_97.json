        "text": "Troy L. Smith, cleveland.com\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Another year, another Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Class and another week full of passionate arguments from fans. This year’s list of nominees pushes forward several longtime snubs, like Soundgarden, the Doobie Brothers, Pat Benatar and Nine Inch Nails\n\nStill, there’s a backlog of musicians who deserve to be inducted. In fact, we managed to find 100 we think have been snubbed by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Nominating Committee and the voters.\n\nSome of them have been waiting a long time while others could make it into the Class of 2020.\n\nAP Image\n\n100. Phish\n\nThis generation's version of the Grateful Dead, Phish is a throwback that has redefined how a band can become famous in the modern era. No band has a more loyal fanbase that has helped them set the bar for the jam band and concert touring over the past few decades.\n\n99. Bad Company\n\nBad Company has the hits, longevity and impact to argue that maybe the super group could have been considered (and inducted) before some of its recent peers that got in.\n\n98. The Doobie Brothers\n\nThey’re not the coolest name on this list (Not by a long shot). But there’s something to be said for longevity and the ability to evolve over time. The Doobie Brothers’ hits and record sales are well-known, while the band’s influence stems from writing timeless pop songs future generations would latch onto. The Rock Hall finally nominated the Doobie Brothers this year and the band has a great shot at getting in.\n\n97. Fela Kuti\n\nThe ultimate pioneer of the Afro-beat genre and political activist whose music has influenced various pop, hip-hop and reggae artists moving forward.\n\n96. The Ravens\n\nAs one of biggest R&B/doo-wop acts of the 1940s and 1950s, The Ravens would prove influential to virtually every vocal group that came after.\n\nJeff Daly\n\n95. Sparks\n\nNot the most well-known artist on this list or the most successful. But there's not denying Sparks' massive influence on the art rock community and bands like Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Bjork and New Order\n\n94. Rufus with Chaka Khan\n\nRufus certainly played a huge role in the funk sounds of the 1970s. Add Chaka Khan in and you have a powerful force with a voice for the ages and production that would be sampled in R&B and hip hop over the next 30-plus years. The duo has certainly been nominated numerous times, including this year.\n\n93. Steve Winwood\n\nIf you have a problem with Traffic being in the Rock Hall, there was another option. Steve Winwood's influence on a few amazing bands, as well as his solo career produces a resume that is perhaps better than that of, say, someone like Jeff Beck\n\n92. Harry Nilsson\n\nNilsson was one of the singer-songwriters of his time, who helped pioneer overdubbing while fusing different genres that would influence today's indie-rockers.\n\n91. Jan and Dean\n\nThe Beach Boys popularized surf rock, but Jan and Dean pioneered it. The duo's groundbreaking California Sound would become a building block for pop music throughout the 1960s.\n\n90. Los Lobos\n\nOne of the most important Latin rock acts of all time, who has built a catalog of brilliant albums and remains impactful today.\n\n89. The Meters\n\nThe Meters may be known as a backing band (one of the most talented ones at that). But the group was as essential as anyone not named James Brown in taking the music Little Richard pioneered and transitioning it into funk.\n\nRobert Mora\n\n88. Dolly Parton\n\nA country singer who became a true pop-culture icon, influencing the career of future female country stars as well as pop singers like Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus.\n\n87. The Marvelettes\n\nOvershadowed by other female soul groups of the same era (namely The Supremes), The Marvelettes songs are among some of the most important in R&B history, such as \"Please Mr. Postman\" and \"Don't Mess With Bill.\"\n\n86. Pavement\n\nMaybe the band doesn't have the recognition as the Pixies or The Smiths. But Pavement may just be the most important indie-rock act of the 1990s and the band countless number of current musicians emulate, both in mentality and sound.\n\n85. Johnny Burnette and the Rock 'n Roll Trio\n\nOne of the most influential rockabilly acts, Burnette helped shape rock and popular music as a whole. He's probably best known for the original version of the landmark rock anthem \"Train Kept A-Rollin'.\"\n\nJonathan Short\n\n84. A Tribe Called Quest\n\nCall it backpack rap, alternative rap or whatever you want. No act had a bigger impact on the genre that would inspire artists like Kanye West, Chance The Rapper and Drake quite like Q-Tip, Phife and company.\n\n83. X\n\nAnother one of the innovative West Coast punk bands the Rock Hall has yet to embrace. X helped push punk rock into its next phase, while also adding to the evolution of alternative rock.\n\n82. Peter Paul & Mary\n\nWhen you think of the early folk scene and the dominant artists, you think Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. But Peter, Paul & Mary's rise to fame marked a key point in which folk music moved out of Greenwich Village and into the mainstream.\n\nJason DeCrow\n\n81. The B-52's\n\nDespite being innovators of the new wave genre, The B-52s have never been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band has been eligible since 2004.\n\n80. Mott the Hoople\n\nLed by one of the great British songwriters of all time in Ian Hunter, Mott the Hoople's blending of sounds and genres, along with its attitude would prove highly influential for future bands of various genres.\n\nMatt Sayles\n\n79. Jane's Addiction\n\nThere have been and will be a lot of bands inducted who owe something to Jane's Addiction. The band's late 1980s work was essential in expanding the concept of hard-rock that would impact funk-rock and grunge, among other genres.\n\n78. Joe Cocker\n\nCocker's voice has redefined some of the greatest songs of all-time while scoring some of his own unique hits. Perhaps his passing two years ago will shine the spotlight on his stellar career.\n\n77. The Runaways\n\nYou could easily make the case that Joan Jett's first band was far more important than her time fronting the Blackhearts. The Runaways were the start of that edgy female punk sound and should have been honored years ago.\n\n76. Toots & the Maytals\n\nThe next logical entry from the reggae genre, Toots & the Maytals maybe didn't invent the genre. But the group helped popularize and evolve its sound as much as anyone not named Bob Marley.\n\n75. Odetta\n\nA major figure of the folk revival who brought political activism into the mix, influencing numerous future songwriters to come.\n\nJack Plunkett\n\n74. De La Soul\n\nDe La Soul brought the art of skits, sampling and an alternative for of rapping to hip-hop music at a time it was sorely needed. You could make the case that the group's brand of backpack rap has endured longer than gangsta rap.\n\n73. War\n\nOne of the essential funk bands of all time that broke down color lines. The group began as a vehicle for Eric Burdon but went on to achieve massive success even without him.\n\n72. Patsy Cline\n\nOne of the first country artists to take hold of the pop charts. Patsy Cline is the most important and influential woman in country's rich history.\n\nJim Cooper\n\n71. Outkast\n\nThere might be earlier hip-hop acts on your list before Outkast, but they aren't bigger or more impactful. Outkast may very well be the greatest hip-hop group of all time who crossed over to massive pop success and put Atlanta rap on the map.\n\n70. Mary Wells\n\nWells was an important part in getting African American music on the radio during the 1960s and was one of the key figures on Motown and arguably its greatest female solo act.\n\n69. Can\n\nA band like Can has the same problem a Kraftwerk has. They're high-art style doesn't stick with your typical hard rock voters. But the band's experimental rock has gone on to influence about as many artists as anyone else on this list.\n\nLennox McLendon\n\n68. Pat Benatar\n\nFor some reason, women just don’t get the love they deserve when it comes to the Rock Hall. If a man had the resume of hits and impact on rock music that Benatar did, he would have been inducted already. Thankfully she’s finally earned her first nomination.\n\n67. Lonnie Donegan\n\nThe biggest and most influential British artist of the pre-Beatles era remains one of the most towering figures in UK music history.\n\n66. The Go-Go's\n\nThe first all female band to score a No. 1 album that was completely written and recorded by themselves, The Go-Go's are one of the biggest and most important female-led acts of all time.\n\n65. Ben E. King\n\nAlready inducted as a member of The Drifters, Ben E. King deserves serious consideration for his solo career. His voice, showcased on one of the greatest songs of all time in \"Stand By Me,\" became an influence for countless artists in various genres moving forward.\n\nAdam Nadel\n\n64. Beck\n\nNot even nominated for the Class of 2019, there will come a day when Beck is recognized as one of the finest solo artists of the past 25 years, whose catalog ranks with the best of his era.\n\n63. Kate Bush\n\nOne of the biggest artists in UK history, whose inventive pop sounds influenced an endless number of today's female singers, songwriters and producers.\n\n62. Alice In Chains\n\nAlice In Chains separated itself from the other big grunge bands in that its sound was harsher. That would help the band become a force in the metal and hard rock scenes, with Layne Staley's voice helping shape those genres as much as any artist of the early 1990s.\n\n61. Brian Eno\n\nEno has been snubbed twice. Once with Roxy Music and once for his inventive solo career which essentially shaped pop music for the indie generation.\n\nAP Photo\n\n60. Slayer\n\nNo band represents the spirit of thrash metal more than Slayer, which makes the act one of the most influential in heavy metal history. Slayer's impact can still be felt today in the sounds of metal acts like Slipknot, Bullet for My Valentine and Lamb of God.\n\n59. Procol Harum\n\nProcol Harum's music during the late 1960s and 1970s was unlike anything before it, redefining progressive rock by incorporating a classical influence into its soul and blues sounds.\n\n58. Buzzcocks\n\nArguably the most influential punk band of all time whose amazingly catchy singles laid the groundwork for pop-punk.\n\n57. Merle Haggard\n\nWe'll fully admit that Merle Haggard is as country as it gets. Still, he influenced several big name rock artists and helped inspire country rock.\n\nAP Photo\n\n56. Willie Nelson\n\nThe Rock Hall hasn't honored country music in the way it should. But if it is to put another name from the genre on the ballot it should be Willie Nelson, whose crossover success impacted more than just country musicians.\n\n55. Big Mama Thornton\n\nThe Rock Hall has acknowledged Big Mama Thornton's impact with features on her and inclusions in its collection of iconic songs. Yet, she hasn't been inducted. The woman who sang the original version of \"Hound Dog\" and set a blueprint for countless soul and rock singers has earned the honor.\n\n54. Duran Duran\n\nDuran Duran was a monster of a band that sold more than 100 million records around the world. The band was also important in the development of the video music art form at the onset of MTV.\n\n53. Peter Tosh\n\nIf you're looking for the most influential reggae artist of all time not named Bob Marley, you could easily go with Peter Tosh. The core member of The Wailers is often overshadowed by Marley's legendary status, but deserves recognition as an icon of an underrated genre.\n\n52. The Clovers\n\nThe group behind the hit \"Love Potion No.9\" was one of the early doo-wop acts to have a huge influence on the development of rock and roll. They're in just about every hall of fame besides the Rock Hall.\n\nAP Photo\n\n51. Motorhead\n\nYou’ll notice a theme of metal bands being under-appreciated. That includes Motorhead, who proved being aggressive and heavy as hell could produce mainstream success in the early 1980s. The band earned its first nomination this year but has to go up against Soundgarden and Judas Priest for votes.\n\n50. Diana Ross\n\nYou could make the case that Diana Ross should have been the first woman inducted into the Rock Hall a second time. Her post-Supremes career ranks with some of the biggest artists of all time in terms of chart success and impact.\n\n49. New Order\n\nIt takes a really special band to, at one time, release the greatest selling 12-inch single of all-time. New Order deserves credit for being one of the most influential bands of the 1980s and carrying on the legacy of Joy Division.\n\nAlan Greth\n\n48. George Michael\n\nMichael's death in 2016 certainly makes you re-evaluate his career. He was more than just a pop star, he was an innovator both the music he created and the causes he stood behind. Michael was really a groundbreaking star whose legacy feels more impactful as time goes on.\n\n47. The Jam\n\nThe leaders of the Mod revival and creators of some of the most melodic tunes of the 1970s and early 1980s, all led by influential genius Paul Weller.\n\n46. Dead Kennedys\n\nOne of the most influential punk bands of all time, who, along with a few other acts, invented hardcore music while broadening the scope of the punk scene.\n\n45. Lonnie Johnson\n\nJohnson was a pioneer of the jazz guitar and the first person to play an electronically amplified violin, which made him the precursor to electric blues and almost all rock music.\n\nHandout\n\n44. Nick Drake\n\nThe highly influential singer-songwriter wasn't a commercial success in his heyday. But Drake's legend has grown over the years with him being responsible for impacting just about every major indie-folk songwriter of the past 20 years, from Elliott Smith to Bon Iver.\n\n43. Wyonnie Harris\n\nI suppose if you're considered one of the founding fathers of rock and roll, and the biggest influence on the greatest rock star of all time in Elvis Presley, you're place in the Rock Hall should be certain.\n\n42. The Spinners\n\nPerhaps the most overlooked Motown act of all time. The Spinners collection of Top 40 hits were as essential to the growth of the Motown sound as any act on the label.\n\n41. Gil Scott-Heron\n\nYou have to wonder if an artist like Gil Scott-Heron's name has come up with the Nominating Committee. Known for his poetry, Scott-Heron was a major influence on hip-hop's greatest lyricists, including recently inducted Tupac Shakur.\n\n40. Captain Beefheart\n\nSome of the greatest bands of all time, including several Rock hall inductees and future candidates, wouldn't be what they were without listening to Captain Beefheart, often cited by the B-52's, David Byrne, Red Hot Chili Peppers and others as an influence.\n\n39. Eurythmics\n\nThe music of the Eurythmics was so far ahead of its time, its taken a while for the Nominating Committee to truly appreciate it. The band's first nomination wasn't enough to get them in...yet.\n\nAP Image\n\n38. Smashing Pumpkins\n\nThere will be several 1990s-era bands popping up in Rock Hall conversations over the next several years. But don't forget about Smashing Pumpkins. Billy Corgan's project is responsible for two landmark albums from the decade redefining what alternative rock could before future acts like Panic! at the Disco and My Chemical Romance.\n\n37. Eric B. & Rakim\n\nEric B. and Rakim's impact on rap music is hard to overstate. Rakim the most influential lyricist in hip-hop history, while the duo's production style would help merge rap with the styles of music (funk, soul, etc.) it was based upon.\n\n36. Depeche Mode\n\nThere’s no denying Depeche Mode’s influence on acts like Coldplay, Radiohead, Muse and Nine Inch Nails. But before some of those artists earn induction, Depeche Mode should be inducting on the strength of selling more than 100 million records worldwide. The band is up for induction again this year.\n\nStephan Savoia\n\n35. LL Cool J\n\nIf this wasn't LL Cool J's year, then when will it be. Rap's first superstar will have a harder time getting in with more 1990s hip-hop acts entering the conversation. And that's a shame.\n\n34. Black Flag\n\nAs one of hardcore’s forefathers, Black Flag developed a blueprint for several future bands, including many grunge acts with how under-appreciated its diverse catalog is.\n\nRichard Drew\n\n33. Dick Dale\n\nVarious guitar legends have had a hard time making it into the Rock Hall. Hopefully Stevie Ray Vaughan and Steve Miller finally making it in will shift focus to surf rock pioneer Dick Dale.\n\n32. W.C. Handy\n\nWhen we say Handy is old school, we mean born in the 1870s. Handy may not have invented the blues but he popularized it and stands as a massive figure (maybe the most important) in the genre's history.\n\n31. Pixies\n\nThey may be the indie rock band to end all indie rock bands. Kurt Cobain routinely mentioned the Pixies as one of his biggest influences. Having the biggest rock star of the past 25 years behind you helps.\n\n30. The Replacements\n\nWhile not as widely celebrated for its impact on college rock and alternative music as, say, R.E.M., The Replacements aren't that far off. The band was able to turn punk rock into an emotionally driven art form.\n\nAP Image\n\n29. Rage Against the Machine\n\nThe band's induction is really just a matter of time. The politically charged rap-rockers' combination of success and impactful tunes is what the Rock Hall lives for. Don't make us wait too long.\n\n28. The Shangri-Las\n\nThe Shangri-Las weren't your typical soul act. They were essentially punk rock before punk rock, paving the way for artists like The Go-Go's and Joan Jett, while impacting other genres an artists (Adele, Amy Winehouse) with its soulful, yet edgy style.\n\n27. The Dominoes\n\nThe Dominoes were one of the most successful vocal group of the 1950s, but some how got lost in the shuffle when it came time for Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductions. Sure, members Clyde McPhatter and Jackie Wilson were honored for the amazing solo careers. But that doesn't adequately represent just how pioneering The Dominoes were, led by Billy Ward and its other members.\n\n26. Joy Division\n\nJoy Division had a short career, but they made the most of it. The band set the stage for acts like like U2 and a crop of melancholy rock acts that came out of the 1980s and continue to this day.\n\nAP Photo\n\n25. Mariah Carey\n\nCarey's stunning career can be divided into two parts. The first part saw her rise as the greatest pop diva of all time with record sales we've never seen before. The second half of her career saw Carey merging pop music with R&B and hip-hop that would forever change the format and pave the way for the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and Ariana Grande.\n\n24. Jethro Tull\n\nOne of the most influential and popular progressive rock acts of all time, you have to scratch your head why Jethro Tull hasn't been nominated. This is a band with a tremendous impact on art rock and hard rock artists spanning multiple decades.\n\n23. Link Wray\n\nYounger fans may not immediately recognize the name, but Link Wray is one of the most influential guitarists of all-time, having inspired everyone from Jimmy Page to Neil Young.\n\n22. The Carter Family\n\nIf the Rock Hall is to get around to putting in more country acts, it might as well start with one of the most important acts of all time. The Carter Family predates rock and roll and influenced every country (and country rock) artist that came after them.\n\n21. Tina Turner\n\nTina Turner is already in the Rock Hall as part of her work with Ike Turner. But that doesn't take into account Tina's monumental solo career, which is not only one of the greatest comeback stories in music history but also one of the most successful runs any artist has ever seen.\n\nNam Y. Huh\n\n20. Soundgarden\n\nPearl Jam and Nirvana overshadowed them, but Soundgarden was the first band from the grunge era to break out into the mainstream, thus paving the way for the rest. With the tragic death of Chris Cornell, the Rock Hall should really continue its grunge trend. Nirvana and Pearl Jam are in. Soundgarden finally made the ballot this year.\n\n19. Carole King\n\nCarole King is in the Rock Hall as a songwriter. But for some reason, she wasn't inducted as a performer. Yes, her songwriting was stunning but her own resume of music is so far ahead of several acts in the Rock Hall.\n\n18. Big Star\n\nThere are those who will swear by their love of Big Star like they would the Beatles. In truth, Big Star merged the best sounds of the best bands that came before them, building a cult following that would influence alternative and indie rock.\n\nC9D\n\n17. MC5\n\nThe MC5 were put a jolt on the rock industry when the band arrived during the second half of the 1960s. The band’s middle finger to the man politics and raucous style became a foundation of the punk rock movement. Sadly, it looks like the band could be on the ballot for a while.\n\n16. Devo\n\nThe Akron-born band knew how to develop a concept that fueled its amazing punk and new wave music. Other bands would copy those concepts of style and musicianship.\n\n15. T. Rex\n\nMarc Bolan & Company were instrumental in the development of glam rock in the 1970s. Bowie got his Rock Hall due. Give T. Rex its props, too. The band is one of the most influential not to make it in. Though, that could change this year.\n\n14. Chic\n\nDon't be fooled by Nile Rodgers being inducted with the Musical Excellence Award. His bandmates in Chic also deserve their credit for being essential to dance, soul and hip hop genres.\n\n13. The New York Dolls\n\nNominated just once in 16 years of eligibility, the punk rock legends were just as influential as The Stooges and Velvet Underground (and most other bands in music history).\n\nAlan Greth\n\n12. Warren Zevon\n\nSongs like \"Werewolves of London\" can't be argued. Neither can the endless list of great songs he wrote for other artists.. As a songwriter, Zevon deserves to be mentioned with artists like Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen.\n\n11. Iron Maiden\n\nWithout Iron Maiden, there is no Metallica. And you could say that about any number of metal bands as it pertains to Maiden.\n\nJoe Mahoney\n\n10. Sonic Youth\n\nSonic Youth expanded the realm of possibilities when it came to alternative-rock, becoming their generation's version of The Velvet Underground.\n\nHandout\n\n9. Gram Parsons\n\nOne of the all-time great singer-songwriters and a pioneer of country rock, the only reason Parsons isn't in the Hall of Fame already is because he was sadly overlooked as part of The Byrds induction years ago.\n\n8. Son House\n\nWe're not exactly sure what The Rock Hall is waiting for when it comes to Son House. He screams Early Influencer as, arguably, the most influential blues musician of all time. Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters would not exist without him. Therefore, neither would rock and roll.\n\n7. King Crimson\n\nYes' induction in 2017 should really push a few other prog-rock acts to the forefront of Rock Hall discussions. One of the chief among them should be King Crimson, one of the most inventive and unique bands of all time.\n\n6. John Coltrane\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame finally inducted Miles Davis in 2006, but hasn't really honored jazz music since. A good place to pick back up would be with the incomparable Coltrane, who pioneered the art of free jazz. You might say there's no rock in John Coltrane. Say what? There's a lot of roll.\n\nJohn Gaps\n\n5. Nine Inch Nails\n\nNIN, a band that brought industrial rock into the spotlight, has been shockingly overlooked the past few years. Trent Reznor and company, which started in Cleveland, will hopefully find its way into the Rock Hall over the next few years.\n\nRhino\n\n4. The Smiths\n\nThe Smiths may be the most important indie-rock band of all-time. Heck, you could make the case that frontman Morrissey could go in on his own as a solo artist. Expect the band to work its way into contention again in the years to come.\n\nAP Images\n\n3. Whitney Houston\n\nRolling Stone lists her as the biggest Rock Hall snub of all-time, and for good reason. The era of the pop diva truly begins here. Houston’s amazing voice, critical and commercial success changed the music industry. Every label wanted a Whitney Houston and to this day that hasn’t changed. She earned her first nomination in 2019 and could get in.\n\nRusty Kennedy\n\n2. Judas Priest\n\nThe creation and growth of heavy metal owes as much to Judas Priest as it does Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Undoubtedly, Priest is the next in line in terms of the Rock Hall honoring the genre. And you have to wonder how close they came after a first ever nomination this year.\n\nKling Klang Records\n\n1. Kraftwerk\n\nMore than any other artist nominated for the Rock Hall in recent years, Kraftwerk’s impact can be felt within 10 minutes of turning on mainstream radio. Dance and electronic music are all the rage, and all of it borrows from the German electronic band that broke through in the early 1970s. Do they get in with the Class of 2020?"
