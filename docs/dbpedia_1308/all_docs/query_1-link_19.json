        "text": "Respond to this Friday Faithfuls challenge by writing anything about rock and roll, or your favorite type of music, or you can write about whatever else you think might fit. Danny and the Juniors sang, “Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay”, letting us know that it will never die, but Marilyn Manson said that Rock Is Dead, so people have different opinions. A lot of rock and rollers have died like Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Elvis, Ritchie Valens, Little Richard, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and Tom Petty are all gone, but I would like to think that they are still playing up in Rock and roll heaven. Every generation has their own music and people want to hear the songs they grew up with, so I am a fan of Classic Rock even though many of the iconic artists, such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and others are not making music anymore, and the sad reality is that rock ‘n’ roll will never be the same.\n\nMaybe I should take that back what I just wrote, as The Beatles just released their new song ‘Now and Then’, which will debut at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart starting tomorrow, giving them a landmark 35th top 10 hit spanning 59 years, nine months and three weeks, the longest span of all time (excluding holiday songs), extending their record for the most among groups and being their first since 1996. The Rolling Stones new album Hackney Diamonds, entered the Billboard chart at #3, extending their record as the act with the most US top 10 albums of all time, with 38 in total just ahead of second-placed Barbra Streisand who has 34. Fleetwood Mac is done as there is no reason to continue without Christine. Bruce Springsteen has sold his entire song catalogue and has postponed all of his remaining 2023 tour dates. At 82 years old, Bob Dylan announced a new run of North American shows to his long-running “Never Ending Tour.” Acts like Metallica, Coldplay, U2, Iron Maiden, Guns ‘N’ Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, and many other rock bands are still touring today.\n\nThe term rock ‘n’ roll derives from the more literal “rocking and rolling”, a phrase used by 17th-century sailors to describe the motion of a ship on the sea. Rock and roll music is a descendent of various musical genres with blues being the heaviest influence, but I don’t think that Hip Hop or Rap music should be considered to be part of this genre. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s nominating committee has sold out to the record industry and made Hip Hop artists the new rock stars and if this doesn’t change, then rock music might as well be dead. The music business today is all about the moment, with whatever is selling right now being the most important thing. This is the basis for what makes the record charts, like the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the Official UK Singles Chart, the YouTube music chart, the Spotify Charts, the USA playlist on Apple Music, the iTunes Top 100 Songs Chart, the Shazam Music Charts, or iHeartRadio Top 40 Song Chart. For more than a hundred years, Billboard has been the most influential entertainment business magazine in the United States, but it’s always been an insider publication. Started in 1894 as a trade magazine for show bill posters, the company concentrated on various aspects of the entertainment business until it began to focus on music (mostly juke boxes) in the 1920’s. In 1936, the company published its first chart, the Music Hit Parade. Since then, the magazine has gradually expanded its charts to include just about any style of music you can think of.\n\nRock is no longer the dominant genre in music and it has not been for some time mow. Taylor Swift seems to be the hottest artist now having the #1 ‘Cruel Summer’ and the #3 ‘Is It Over Now?’ songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Billboard magazine has a music chart called Hot Rock & Alternative Songs that seems to include other genres and the #1 song on this chart is ‘I Remember Everything’ by Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves. The chart includes what it considers to be the top 50 songs and there are 16 more songs on this chart by Zach Bryan, but I always considered him to be a Country Music artist. There were some artists on this list that I have heard of before like Lana Del Rey, Imagine Dragons and the Rolling Stones with their new song ‘Angry’, but it was also filled with Hip Hop artists like Post Malone and Jelly Roll who has now turned Country and Noah Kahan who is hard to define.\n\nFor the better part of the past few decades, naysayers have written off rock music, saying that the genre is dead. It may not be as prominent as it was during its formative years, but there remains a strong, vital scene with a number of bands that are keeping rock alive. Older rock music is still very popular, partly due to the large population of the Baby Boomer generation and to a lesser extent with Gen X. Classic rock has been voted to be the favorite genre among age groups spanning 35-65+, and almost half (49%) of 25-34 consider it their favorite. People 50+ (classic rock lovers) collectively spend $3.2 trillion annually. Classic rock ranked #1 in total album sales in 2017 (34.6%) compared to #2, R&B/hip hop (14.6%). The most popular genre in the U.S. is rock and indie music, with 45 percent of respondents who listen to the radio or digital music content saying that they listen to rock music. Other sites may rank Pop, R&B and hip-hop ahead of rock music because this music dominates the US market. There are nearly 1,500 U.S. radio stations spanning the rock universe of classic rock, alternative, triple A, active rock and mainstream rock. While shares have long ebbed and flowed, rock radio is currently on an upswing with slightly more people listening to rock on the radio than there were four years ago. People are still going out and buying The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band album, which was released 56 years ago."
