        "text": "There’s been many threads and votes for a Classic Rock station by so many people over the past couple of years yet the devs choose to ignore them and throw in an 80’s retro wave station instead - just because 1 dev on the livestream wanted it. I don’t recall anybody asking for that so why are the Classic Rock enthusiasts being ignored ?\n\nGive us the Classic Rock station that so many players wanted.\n\nI’m talking proper Classic Rock from the mid 60’s to mid 80’s here. See the multiple threads on this devs and give us what we want.\n\nSorry but I have to disagree here.\n\nYes - XS is pitiful as a Classic Rock station, as is Epitaph - but my idea of a Classic Rock station goes back to the mid 60’s to mid 80’s.\n\nLed Zep, Black Sabbath, early AC-DC, early Iron Maiden, Metallica, etc. are Classic Rock, plus many others that I don’t have time to list. They’ve all been covered in other threads if you want to look.\n\nYour list is more 50’s to 60’s Rock’N’Roll plus a few slightly later versions of Rock’N’Roll - not Classic Rock as the thread name suggests.\n\nAll the previous threads and votes have been for a Classic Rock station.\n\nAs said, there’s many that could be added to the list - Floyd a definite.\n\nThere’s so many to list in the Classic Rock status that the list would be pretty huge. Anything before the mid 60’s doesn’t really fall into that category with a few exceptions from earlier 60’s but not that many. I do however consider many Blues bands that, whilst not Classic Rock, would be more than acceptable as decent additions to the playlist.\n\nElton John is definitely not Classic Rock though and not something I would be interested in listening to.\n\nBest thing would be to search for the previous threads that have discussed this with numerous suggestions that I’ve forgotten to list.\n\nNot really - Rock’N’Roll is totally different from Rock.\n\nRock leans more towards Metal, Rock’N’Roll is the old school 50’s with the suits and hair gel.\n\nI don’t have any interest in that genre - your Elvis’s etc.\n\nI look for actual Rock with guitars, lead solos, drum solos, Bass solos if you will with Jason’s Bass shredding riffs that were as close to a Kirk guitar solo that you could get.\n\nNot to mention Lemmy Rockin’ up the Bass with the best of them.\n\nIf you can’t see the difference between Rock & Rock’N’Roll then I give up."
