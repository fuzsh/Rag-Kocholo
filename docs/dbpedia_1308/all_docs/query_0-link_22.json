        "text": "Back in 1981 I bought the album that this song is the title track to. I had their greatest hits of mostly their sixties hits and this album was the first new Kinks album I ever bought.\n\nThe song is a pure rock song with a huge punk edge. I read where a critic wrote that The Kinks were a great punk band who could actually play their instruments and with this song you see that.\n\nThis song is my favorite song off the album. While writing Low Budget, their previous album, Ray was watching American TV including “That’s Incredible” where people did dangerous and insane stunts. He writes a fair statement about the viewing public…now and then. Parts of it are crude but is true to life. When Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane, But still we watch the re-runs again and again, We all sit glued while the killer takes aim…\n\nThe song tells the truth…violence sells.\n\nRay Davies: “What happens is the consumer is being used to entertain, to get high ratings, to sell products to consumers. It was going around in a circle. That’s a real con. And good shows were being dropped from TV. I’ve just written an outline, and I hope we’re going to get some money from RCA to do a videodisc because it’s a media-based album.”\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nThe title track to The Kinks 1981 album, “Give The People What They Want” was written by their frontman Ray Davies in response to what he saw on American TV when he was writing songs for their previous album, Low Budget. He noticed that TV was getting more and more sensational, and that viewers were fascinated with violence and tragedy – similar to how Romans watched Christians get fed to the lions.\n\nOne show Davies watched was That’s Incredible, where regular people performed dangerous stunts.\n\nRay Davies said that he took out the following verse:\n\nThe French Revolution was a crazy scene\n\nAll those aristocrats getting guillotined\n\nThe promoters cleaned up\n\nThe expenses were low\n\nAn execution costs nothing\n\nIt’s a wonderful show\n\nTaken at face value with just the title for reference, this song can appear to be about The Kinks making an effort to please their audience by delivering a hit. That interpretation is way off, however, as the song is much more a social commentary on those who pander to the masses.\n\nThe Kinks went for a monster drum sound on this one in an effort to make it arena-friendly. To get his sound, they placed corrugated iron around the walls of Konk Studios in London, where they recorded the album.\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\nHey, hey, hey\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nWell, it’s been said before, the world is a stage\n\nA different performance with every age\n\nOpen the history book to any old page\n\nBring on the lions and open the cage\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nThe more they get, the more they need\n\nAnd every time they get harder and harder to please\n\nThe Roman promoters really did things right\n\nThey needed a show that would clearly excite\n\nThe attendance was sparse so they put on a fight\n\nThrew the Christians to the lions, it sold out every night\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nThe more they get, the more they need\n\nAnd every time they get harder and harder to please\n\nGive ’em lots of sex, perversion and rape\n\nGive ’em lots of violence, and plenty to hate\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nWhen Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane\n\nBut still we watch the re-runs again and again\n\nWe all sit glued while the killer takes aim\n\n“Hey Mom, there goes a piece of the president’s brain!”"
