        "text": "Hey guys, didn’t know where to post this, if it’s inappropriate, please move it to the right place.\n\nI haven’t been in a band for quite awhile now, mostly due to my own insecurities, but I’m soon moving to a country where I can find a rock band to play at some bars a bit easier.\n\nI think this is a great opportunity to develop a repertoire of standard rock songs, since I was never patient enough to actually learn 25-30 songs from start to finish.\n\nSoooo, what songs do you guys play with your bands? Is there a “standard” repertoire in rock music? All suggestions are welcomed.\n\nI’ll chime in with ZZ Top and Kansas\n\nI’d go with some simpler Queen songs and AC/DC.\n\nDepends on the ability/range of the singer!\n\nThat I can’t know without joining a band, but let’s just assume that the singer won’t be Freddie Mercury or something\n\nI just want to learn some pretty standard stuff, because I feel that my repertoire is quite limited. I’ve been practicing sequences/exercises/licks for far too long.\n\nJustin Sandercoe of Justin Guitar – a prominent and good YouTube teacher of non-shred guitar – has a bunch of lessons on full songs, and without knowing your tastes or preferences I think they are a reasonable starting point at a canon.\n\nThere’s not a lot of Yngwie, though\n\nOh I forgot about Justin! He has a wide range of rock songs uploaded. Thanks! Fortunately I can play most of that stuff without having to see what he does note for note.\n\nYngwie is remarkable, I just haven’t been able to really dive into his mechanics, even though I’m a huge fan.\n\nBrown Eyed Girl. I don’t know why. Played in bars for 20 years. The request never went away.\n\nLesson about choosing repitoire: Early on…my band worked-up ‘La Villa Strangiato’, got the crowd worked up and then dropped the tune. Cleared to dance floor. Lesson learned for us young bucks: playing in a bar is not about you, it’s about them. I know it’s a cliché but it’s so true.\n\nYou might not get to do much shredding if you’re looking to entertain others…but throw in a few licks here and there and you will know who the guitar players in the crowd are. Also great experience to work on tone in a live setting.\n\nOnce you’ve done 10 gigs you will know the common requests…the repitoire eventually presents itself! Good luck and have so much fun! Watch your back carrying equipment around.\n\nThanks man! I’ve never actually sat down to learn Brown Eyed Girl, I’ll give it a shot.\n\nI don’t really “need” to shred, I also get satisfaction by rocking hard and playing groovy songs. Some savagery here and there is welcomed of course!\n\nSo far I have AC/DC, ZZ Top, Foo Fighters, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Billy Idol, Queen and Big Wreck. I think this covers quite a bit of ground, at least for now.\n\nBack in my teen band days I used to carry around a 50w Marshall JVM with a 2x12 cab. Yikes! I’ll definitely build a much smaller rig. I’m thinking of a Friedman Pink Taco combo version along with 4-5 pedals tops.\n\nHendrix tunes\n\nSpanish Castle Magic- and oh almost forgot! Whiskey in the Jar is always a classic.\n\nI mostly play bass and while I am happy to play through any backline provided, when I take my own it’s a MarkBass 121P; it’s a 1x12 class D amp rated at 350W without an extension cab (500W with) and I can pick it up comfortably with one hand.\n\nIf I was looking at playing Billy Idol et al. in bar bands I would get a Boss Katana without hesitation. My back would thank me and they sound great.\n\nI played the Friedman Jerry Cantrell combo recently, was blown away by the tone and volume from the little box! The $1700 price tag smacked me in the face lol.\n\nCrossroads\n\nSunshine of your Love\n\nHeartbreaker\n\nWhole Lotta Love\n\nFoxy Lady\n\nPurple Haze\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nAint Talking bout Love\n\nMy teacher is playing a Friedman Phil X, that’s how I was introduced to the company, they make some fantastic amps! I haven’t played a mediocre one yet. They’re pricy indeed, but really worth the hustle. I’ll try to find a used one of course, I won’t be able to handle my taste with a phD candidate salary.\n\nThank you for the suggestions, some nice songs in there.\n\nSweet Home Alabama\n\nCan’t You See - Marshall Tucker Band\n\nSome 90s tunes would go over big depending on the audience\n\nSmooth - Santana\n\nFar Behind - Candlebox\n\nAlive - Pearl Jam\n\nOne - U2\n\nDepending on how good the singer is lean on songs that the audience can sing along. It’s probably not a bad idea to look up the top streamed rock songs from various decades on spotify.\n\nQuite literally anything from Tom Petty’s popular catalog would work!\n\nLast dance with MJ\n\nRunnin’ down a dream\n\nSaving Grace\n\nWould be my picks\n\nHow could we forget?\n\nFreeeeeeee Bird!\n\nCan’t forget this classic! —\n\nHaha I’ll be honest I’m not enough of a rock connoisseur to make a full list, but I kind of love how “standard rock repertoire” can encompass such a range of eras / styles that everyone can have a totally different and valid idea of what this means.\n\nA few to consider: Van Halen, Hendrix, Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Bowie, Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Nirvana, Guns N’ Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers…\n\nThere’s probably some regional variation too. I’d imagine the ratio of Springsteen to Lynyrd Skynyrd is different in the south than the northeast.\n\nPretty much any semi rural club is going to like Mellencamp, Springsteen, Bob Seger, Skynyd, Allman Bros etc. Lean heavier on Springsteen and Mellencamp in the rust belt. Lean heavier on Skynyrd, Allman bros etc in the south.\n\nI love this topic! Plenty of good tunes here in the replies, but thar be dragons there.\n\nWhen people like us put together setlists, we gravitate towards guitar-based music. More guitar? We like it more!\n\nBut the crowd doesn’t like songs for the same reasons we do. They like what they like.\n\nBar owners don’t care what you sound like—they care if the crowd shows up, stays through your way-way-way-too-long set break, and spends a ton of money on booze. Make the bar owner happy? You get more (and better) gigs.\n\nAll else being equal, it’s also a lot more fun to play for enthusiastic crowds.\n\nKnow whose job depends on keeping the dance floor packed? Wedding bands. And luckily, every wedding band on earth keeps a full setlist of songs they know on their website. Go crib a few successful bands’ setlists. See what songs pop up again and again.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you have to play stuff you don’t like. Think of the Venn Diagram overlap between “songs I like” and “songs drunk people like” and learn those songs.\n\nI love singer-songwriter deep cuts. People in bars don’t. So I don’t play those songs (in bars anyway).\n\nPeople in bars love Luke Bryan, but I think he’s terrible. So no matter how many requests I get, I ain’t learning Luke Bryan.\n\nDrunk people love The Killers, Bruce Springsteen, and Whitney Houston. So do I! So Whitney, Bruce, and the Killers are all in heavy rotation.\n\nTreat it like a hypothesis—“I think people will lose their minds over this song.” But if you play it at three gigs and no one cares about it, take it off the list. Try something else. Keep refining until there’s no fat in your sets. You’ll know you’ve got it when people forget to go home.\n\nPersonally I try to steer clear of up-to-the-minute hits. Sure, for two weeks last summer everyone wanted to hear Old Town Road, but now we’re largely over it. It’ll be a great tune to cover in three years, once we’ve all had a chance to get nostalgic about that moment in time.\n\nIt’s one of the hidden-in-plain-sight things about playing covers: you’re using other people’s memories as a lever. Your version of Life Is A Highway or Boys Of Summer might be totally mediocre, but it’s a skeleton key that opens up everyone’s fond remembrances of driving with the windows down and the radio up.\n\nSomething that’s worked really well for me is “song menus”—we hand trifold brochures with a list of songs we know and invite people to text our “request hotline.”\n\nI’m linking to a Dropbox folder here with our song menu. You can see the list of tunes that are still on our menu after four years of playing the same bar every week. I’ve also included editable templates (for both Word & Pages) if you want to try them out for yourself."
