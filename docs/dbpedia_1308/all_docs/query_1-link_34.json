        "text": "The \"If I were a carpenter\" part is almost definitely a reference to the 1966 Bobby Darin album If I Were a Carpenter.\n\nWe have, from the lyricists' own lips, in an interview \"Sleeping Giants? Never,\" in the Houston Chronical March 5, 2008:\n\n\"Uh, there's a little bit of stream of consciousness to writing that one. This sounds really abstract, but in order to begin wrapping a piece of string around itself, you need something to start with. Like a rock. I guess you can make a ball of string starting from nothing if you just make a tiny loop at the end of the string. But it seems theoretically impossible. It's a metaphor for getting started.\"\n\nSo, it's a metaphor for getting started. --Christina 19:40, 6 March 2008 (UTC)\n\nThat's really cool. I like how at the beginning, it's as if the narrator is floating around in a nebula waiting for something to start this process - because in order for anything to move, it needs some stimulus. \"Where was I? I forgot. I said if I was smart, that I would save up...\" Thus the chain (string?) can begin. Though the prosthetic forehead mention is still confusing. ~ magbatz 03:30, 15 May 2008 (UTC)\n\nI feel it would be obvious that this song is about the Cold War.\n\nThe two things that people \"want\" - a rock to wind a string around, and a prosthetic foreheads - are truly bizarre. While the narrator acts like the reasons why these things should be wanted is obvious when really they are not.\n\nThen a massive threat - someone who wants to destroy all the... meaningless... things everyone likes. Now here comes the hook of my interpretation: someone wants to destroy the rocks/foreheads, yet supposedly everyone wants them. Thus the paradox between the \"Free World\" claiming that communist nations' peoples all wanted capitalism, while claiming that communists wanted to destroy capitalism. This works both ways, with communists saying capitalists want communism and whatnot.\n\nThe infant reference is also about how both sides of the conflict treated their citizens with a patronizing paternal attitude, talking down to them.\n\nFinally, the \"hammering on my piglet\" remark is ingenious. Piglet is a character from A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh series, and a perfect example of art and literature becoming commercialized beyond recognition. Of course this must be a Piglet piggy bank.\n\nOther minor metaphorical references: the hammer of the hammer and sickle, the fact that ancient currency was rocks tied upon strings, etc.\n\nThe point is I WIN\n\nI think that it is a song about being forced to grow up, as a child you are able to be happy with simple pleasures like tieing a piece of string around a rock, or putting something silly on your head, but as you grow older, things are changed and you are no longer able to keep your silly little playthings. -FOXhound\n\nI think this song is about jealousy. The narrator saves up for a piece of string and a rock to tie the string around. Other people have string, but they aren't smart enough to think to buy a rock. They get jealous and act like babies (\"Throw the crib door wide/let the people crawl inside\") - Juttman\n\nIt's about throwing a bear hang. Up in the Boundary Waters of Minnesota you have to hang your food so the black bears don't get at it. You tie the rope around a rock and throw it over the tree branch you want. You have to find a rock with lots of good angles so the rope doesn't fall off. Hence, the rock to tie a string around. --erika\n\nThe \"anonymous\" guy who said \"I thought this song was a play on \"We want \"To\" Rock\" made something click in my mind- If anyone here knows the history of Rock and Roll, they know that the parents of the white kids didn't want the kids listening to \"black\" music because black people were \"inferior\" and everything- so, basically, we want TO rock, we want A rock? my theory is basically the same as everyone else's, only sort of flipped. Instead of them wanting it, but the play-house-burn-downers (if you will; or just \"The Man\")not wanting them to have it; The Man doesn't want them to have it so they want it. Anonymous numbah whatever it is by now.\n\nThis one is simple. It's about needing love (awwwwwwww). But its true. Everbody wants love. the \"crib\" analogy is saying that all adults are really baby's needing love. And they try to hurt people and \"burn the playhouse down\" - and they want to stop the one;s who want love - but deep inside, \"everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around.\" - sappy but true\n\nYeah, I thought that this was a play on the ambiguity of \"we wanna rock\" as a statement. I bet the idea for the song stemmed from that idea, wanting things with very little purpose. --Ed\n\nI thought this song was a play on \"We Want To Rock\". However, I can't explain the \"prosthetic foreheads\" and \"crib\". --anonymous\n\n\"a rock to wind a sting around\" would imply a yo-yo. componded with the fact that the yo-yo was originally a weapon everyone would want one as a method of self-defense. - empallin\n\nI think the reason why the purpose for having a rock or prosthetic forehead is not readily apparent is because there isn't one. They are just examples of stupid things that, for some reason, catch on. Even arson will not stop the masses, who are mesmerized like babies. --another anonymous\n\nI second the first and second anonymites. This is a genre parody song, like \"I'm Def\". ... Actually, having heard it a few more times on random play, I think maybe it is further than just parodying fads; it is parodying things that \"everybody wants\". Let the people into your little crib, because someone wants to take their prosthetic foreheads away. How crazy is that? Everybody wants prosthetic foreheads! What a lunatic! --ThirdAnonymous\n\nAh, by the way, in case you're as dense as I am, \"if I were a carpenter I'd hammer on my piglet, I'd collect the seven dollars\" refers to breaking open a piggy bank to buy the forehead. --ThirdAnonymous\n\nAs another dedicated anonymous TMBG fan, I think the \"prosthetic forehead\" refers to a hat. A really popular faddish hat, mind you. --Fourth anonymite\n\nMe? I thought 'rocks and string' was a suicide reference. You know, tie yourself to a rock and throw it in the river as a weight. Prosthetic foreheads - call me a geek, but that made me think of Star Trek and their propensity to give a human a prosthetic forehead and call them an alien. --The Fifth Anonymite\n\nWhen I lived in Hawaii there was lots of news about Sumo wrestling and it turns out there's a height restriction that shorter wrestlers would overcome by getting head implants to make them taller. Not quite prosthetic, but the only other explanation I can come up with for \"prosthetic forehead\" besides a hat or nonsense. -- scragz\n\nI've always seen this song as people's desire to own things. The pleasure that we take in acquisition for its own sake. We believe that a new car or yo-yo or plastic surgery will make us into happier people. I was recently listening to this on my brand-new MP3 player and unfortunately the irony was not lost on me. --Heinz Kiosk\n\nMy belief is that this is a reference to how in various schools across the country, some event will precipitate a fad of all the kids bringing yo-yos or wearing baseball caps to school, causing a severe backlash from the administration and goofy zero-tolerance rules like \"bring a yo-yo to school and get suspended for a week.\" (Of course, when this album came out in 1990, yo-yos and baseball caps were about the extent of the behavioral problems which most schools had to deal with...) --fluffy\n\nHeinz K has come the closest to my interpretation - I, with several other people I know, reached the conclusion that this song is about religion. Everybody wants a rock (a solid foundation, faith for example) to wind a piece of string (their own insecurites) around, thus anchoring themselves more firmly to earth. The song is obviously portraying these people in a negative light, treating them as small children who, when a crib is flung open, crawl INside, rather than out, as would most actual babies. The 'Someone in this town' is some outside menace to religion, either Atheism, Reason, or some other religion, but 'everybody' (ie, all the people of the original religion, who see themselves as the only true people, thus excluding others from everybody) is strong in their faith, and won't let the invader in. The forheads bit, is, in my opinion, a comment on how religion lets people feel justified even when doing completely ridiculous things, because everyone is doing it, and under the sanction of god no less. The forheads section may also refer to the disguising nature of religion, covering people's true selves with a veneer of righteousness. --- Personman\n\nThis song, to me at least, is talking about conformity. Everybody wants to be like everybody else. You guys have bad grammar.-thegooddoctor\n\n++ I always thought it was about people (possibly young people) who want frivolous, silly things because they are popular (for no good reason). \"They\" wanting to stop them from having them could be parents who realize the silliness of these materials. -D\n\nCould it possibly be about how humans can be so easily amused by the most mundane things? Winding a piece of string around a rock sounds like a thing I'd do if I had both objects and was completely bored. And, I know from experience that wearing a prosthetic forehead can be a very exciting experience. So much that other people I've run into want to wear the forehead on their real head. -Groucho Marx\n\nWHAT? anyway when ever i hear this song i think of Linnell with a giant forehead.\n\n\"Prosthetic foreheads\" may refer the masks from children's Halloween costumes. Halloween costumes, sold in drug stores at the time, came with a thin plastic mask of a character's face. For some reason, most of these masks had very high \"hairlines\" and as a result, the plastic foreheads dominated half of the design. (would keep with the childhood/toy theme)\n\nI interpret this song as being about the desire of society to limit liberty. The two things that \"everybody wants\" in this song are \"a rock to wind a piece of string around\" and \"prosthetic foreheads on their real heads\", which I see as symbols of weapons and personal expression, respectively. In the song we see people wanting to \"burn the playhouse down\", an example of society attempting to regulate artistic expression.\n\nBut I think the final clue for me is \"throw the crib door wide, let the people crawl inside\". In working to create rules in society against weapons, against certain forms of expression, we create systems in which we attempt to protect ourselves, like infants. The people are throwing their own crib doors wide, crawling, not as free adults, but as children of a system they created, into the prison-like symbol of a crib.\n\n--joedecker\n\nThis song is about sex.\n\n-- anonymous\n\nAbout the prosthetic foreheads: it was sort of a running joke on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" that every alien race they encountered was just like humans (for budget reasons) except they had some kind of ridges or bumps on their foreheads, (so they would look obviously \"alien\"). Those bumps and ridges were done by means of gluing rubber appliances to the actors' faces; thus, prosthetic foreheads on their real heads.\n\n-- anonymous\n\nI think this song is about freedom of expression. Like the Fifth Anonymite, the prosthetic foreheads made me think of Star Trek--namely, Star Trek conventions at which many people dress in costume. Our culture has quite a lot of scorn for geekiness, so there would be a lot of people wanting to stop the ones with prosthetic foreheads on their heads.\n\n--Dairhenien\n\nI think that far from being nonsense, and like (in my humble opinion) a lot of other TMBG songs, this song's lyrics were specifically written to defy interpretation. Every interpretation thus far has one line that just won't mesh. --Sir Gimp of Baath\n\nI think it's the opposite of society today: We want large, complicated things, but they only want a rock to tie a string around: something even a baby could do. --The Mu\n\nI think that rhe rock, the string, and the prosthetic forheads represent all things people like to do, that are not alowed, in some places or any(drugs, rock music, skateboarding) and the person who is trying to burn the playhouse down is the government. The crib is somewere hidden where people can do things that they want to do without being pushed around. Funny song- drworm 818/ if you want to talk about TMBG on IM be my guest.\n\nA prosthetic forehead would be useful for someone who doesn't really want to think. --Nehushtan 17:38, 6 Mar 2006 (CST)\n\nI thought large foreheads represented intelligence, hence wanting to artifically augment one's forehead. Generally, I do think this song is about bandwagon-jumping, and then the backlash that often results. It kind of makes me think of the music man too, in terms of the backlash against the young folks who just want to be able to have a good time at the pool hall. -E\n\nI see this song as everybody wants the necessities (could be love, represented by a rock and a string), but everybody wants, well, what people would sometimes call wants. Wants and needs. The needs are the rock and string, could be love, as stated before, but eveyrbody wants those dang fake forheads too, 'cause they're something everybody has. The end. =) --Lemita 18:29, 9 Apr 2006 (CDT)\n\nI think this song is about people who make up fads. This guy is making up all these things that people think are cool. But, there's this one person who thinks it's annoying and/or stupid and wants to stop it. (I know I'm probably repeating someone else's so...)- Monkiepeople99\n\nI think Personman has a good point, but allow me to suggest my own ambiguous claim- just roll with it. I actually have 2 theories, so here they are:\n\n1. Like Personman said, a rock represents something solid and reliable (he used the example of faith). The string represents just the opposite- mankind's emotions and insecurities. People wrap their insecurities around their \"rocks\", which just happen to be their material possessions. Everyone clings to their belongings, because they make people happy about what they have (the things you own end up owning you, and if you dont understand what im saying, watch Fight Club). So we have these possessions, which Linnell calls 'rocks' to stress their meaninglessness in life. The crib represents the prisons that people make for themselves by relying on material goods- they're slaves to what they own. Someone (be it a TMBG Tyler Durden) wants to burn the playhouse down (a lot like blowing up credit card buildings) to set people free from their obsession.\n\n2. The song is about society and how easily people are influenced by those around them. Note: the title is \"Everybody WANTS a rock\" but how sure are we that everybody NEEDS a rock? rocks and strings are meaningless pieces of junk, but everyone's winding their string around their rocks, so naturally, the narrator wants to do it too. He even thinks hes being smart by saving up for string and a rock, but he's only following the crowd. The crib is any figurative cage that all the people crawl inside. Someone with common sense wants to break everyone free from their conformist ways, \"but everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around\". in other words, its pointless to try having people think for themselves. they'll just keep winding string around rocks 'cuz all the cool kids are doing it. Let's not even get started on the stupid prostetic foreheads they're all wearing.\n\n-Mike (blueshotgun017)\n\nP.S.- I don't know if anyone said this yet, but i thought of something that agrees with Personman's religion theory. The opening line to the 2nd verse is \"if i were a carpenter...\". Now, who from a famous religion was a carpenter? Answer: Jesus.\n\nI think this song is from a socially liberal or possibly even a libertarian perspective (the difference being issues such as gun control and casinos and such). In my opinion \"everyone\" conformed or not, are the good guys. And I saw the rock as two random things that we all should have a right to do, but authority says we cant, often without a reason, or with unsound reasons to back it up. For example my school recently banned wearing anything over your head (with the exception of religious gear but including hoods) but we all wanted to wear prosthetic foreheads on our real heads. On a bigger (and more contriversial issue) there is gay marriage, now obviously not everyone wants to have a gay marriage, but everyone in that particular group waiting to get married does (my advice to you is find a church (there are ones out there) that will spiritually bond you, that will make you unnoficially married and the economic benifits shouldn't be the focus anyhow) but authority along with sodomy laws keeps the playhouse burnt down. In Summary, I think this song is about unreasonable authority.\n\nOh, sorry if I offended anyone by bringing up gay marriage.--Fasterthanyou 05:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)\n\nI refer you to I Should Be Allowed To Think. Shii 00:02, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI think it's about how people tend to conform to things so easily, no matter how silly [rock to wind a peice of string aound]. Then there are also people who do not conform [the people who try to burn the playhouse down]. Basically, the narrator is a mindless person, shepereded by the people who sorround him, and conforms to what they want. We can assume that this man just wants to fit in because he is considered a 'social outcast' without these things. Therefore, he goes to great lenghts to get these things. Because of this, he also hates people who do not try to conform, and urge other people to stop conforming, thinking that this would cast him out again. -Zero R. 12:56, 21 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI mostly agree with the interpretation above, and some others who said similar things. I feel that the rock and the prosthetic foreheads are meant to generically represent silly, useless objects (or interests) that are viewed as interesting only because everyone wants or has one.\n\nThough the speaker is a firm believer in the virtues of rocks and prosthetic foreheads, the song itself is meant to convey a sardonic view of these things. Thus, the lines about the crib, etc., are meant to paint the rock/forehead enthusiasts as being silly and childish.\n\nThe playhouse-burning entity represents a reasonable, perceptive person, who is just trying to point out that the rock/forehead business is silly. Unfortunately, the speaker and his comrades are so deeply entrenched in their rock/forehead obsession that they view this person as hostile and threatening.\n\nOn a side note, I'm kind of amused by the line \"but everybody wants [etc.],\" as spoken immediately after the discussion of the playhouse-burning man. I view it as the speaker's incredulous response--\"what?! But everyone wants these things!\" --Keriostar 23:29, 13 June 2007 (UTC)\n\nWell, I never looked much into it, it's usually (to me) just a song about people wanting prosthetic foreheads, rocks, string, and all that good stuff. When I look at it interpretively, it's about people wanting pointless things, and thus everyone else wants them, and only one person in the town knows that it's stupid and pointless. I don't know about why he burns the playhouse down, though.-Salioshy\n\nYou know, I always thought this song was just poking fun at the Twisted Sister song 'I Wanna Rock' by being more literal and less egocentric with 'We Want A Rock'. The idea, to me, was making fun of the fact that 'Wanna Rock' can be interpreted as either wanting a rock or wanting to rock and wanting a rock is very bizarre, as is wanting string and prosthetic foreheads.\n\n--Timus\n\n\"Hammer on my piglet\" isn't that obtuse. It refers to pig iron, which carpenters use.\n\n-A professional carpenter (With a prosthetic forehead)\n\nThe quote now on the main page of this song, \"This sounds really abstract, but in order to begin wrapping a piece of string around itself, you need something to start with.\" agrees with the interpretation I had when I first listened to this song.\n\nPeople want something to give meaning. Everything abstract must have a foundation, a beginning, but it's usually the case that the foundation is fabricated, and that the true essence of the world is that you need a rock to tie a string around itself, a string cannot be tied about itself alone.\n\nThis is an amusing interpretation, because I think it mocks interpretation. Everyone here has some complicated political/religious issue tied into a ridiculous story, and though these ideas have grounding (like a rock is natural and real), they're just attaching meaning to something which has none on its own.\n\nThis interpretation works if you consider the first lyrics \"I was making a point... but I forgot it,\" -- the speaker probably realizes his point is irrelevant because he may as well buy a rock and tie a string around it.\n\nOf course this is merely an interpretation too.\n\n-Anonymous\n\nFranz Kafka wrote a (very) short story entitled Bachelor's Ill Luck. It's about imagining one's self as a bachelor later in life, and how depressing it would be. He then concludes with the line:\n\n\"That is how it will be, except in real life, both today and later, one will stand there with a palpable body and a real head, a real forehead, that is, for smiting on with one's hand.\"\n\nBasically saying that actually living such a situation is much worse than only imagining it, perhaps to cast a light onto mankind's shortsightedness or perhaps to cast a light on mankind's lack of empathy, stating that some are living with such a curse today.\n\nMaybe everybody wants prosthetic foreheads to protect their real heads from the smiting of their hands?\n\nMaybe rather than try to live life properly, people would prefer to not think about it, but save themselves from the terror of regret?\n\nMaybe Linnell never read this story and it's entirely coincidental?\n\nI would say the answers to the previous questions are: no, no, and yes. But hopefully it draws a parallel between Linnell and Kafka. Two brilliant minds that cast light on the darker elements of man with a filter of the absurd.\n\n-Liam\n\nI see this song as following along with the story Alfred tells Bruce in The Dark Knight about the man who stole the rubies and were just throwing them away because he wanted to watch the world burn.\n\nRelating to this song, the prosthetic foreheads and the rocks to wind a string around are nice things and things that everyone wants (money, nice houses, etc.) and the people wanting to burn the playhouse and foreheads down are those who aren't content with others being happy, so they have to ruin it for everyone.\n\nMy friend told me her church camp would make them find a rock from the forest and wind string around it as a reminder to keep God in their thoughts. They were supposed to carry the rock around with them wherever they went. When I interpret the song with religion in mind, I see the prosthetic forehead as being a Pope hat.\n\nI think it's about Americans & all the useless shit we buy & our craving for new gadgets. I think the song is making fun of it.\n\nI saw the rock as a sort of allusion to Perseus and the minotaur, i.e., he needed a rock to tie his string around, for to not get lost in the labyrinth, and that 'everybody wants a rock' is referring to some anchor point so that they won't get lost in the 'labyrinth' of life.\n\nI always interpret this song about those people who, inexplicably, want to stop kids from being kids (\"Someone in this town/is trying to burn the playhouse down\") and, in a larger sense, want to shame adults for having fun in any silly, undignified manner (\"They want to stop the ones who want/ A rock to wind a string around\") arbitrarily determined to be immature or inappropriate for a grown-up. Kids can entertain themselves with anything--a refrigerator box, or a rock with a piece of string around it. But most adults (i.e., \"everybody\") secretly still enjoy some of the simple pleasures they enjoyed as children, or might still enjoy them if they would only give themselves the chance. With the \"playhouse\" of childhood unselfconsciousness forbidden, the song's narrator invites people to \"crawl inside\" (like an infant, but also implying a secret visit) to the \"crib\" where they can be as playful and joyful as they want without being judged.\n\nI'm with Dairhenian super in thinking of \"Star Trek\" fandom, though I have no idea if that were intentional on Johns' part. In particular, the 'Throw the crib door wide/Let the people crawl inside' triggers in my mind those parts that see all fandoms as regressive attempts to avoid adulthood (other parts disagree). The 'If I were a carpenter/I'd hammer on my piglet' might be an oblique reference to the song \"If I Had a Hammer\". Anon ibn-Ibid (talk) 06:49, 30 June 2014 (EDT)\n\nI think it's definitely about consumerism but also about love. I think it's a bunch of fun metaphors used in different places to mean different things, but remain the same concrete object. So it's \"Everyobody wants to rock\" and \"people are buying meaningless crap\" and \"everyone wants someone in their life to rely on\" depending on where you are in the song. Playfairmoriarty\n\nIn the rock I see a starting point, like the stone in stone soup. The string you tie around it exercising human control over a part of the world. We don't know what we can do with it, but we can swing it and that's something more than we had before.\n\nThrow the crib door wide, let the people crawl inside? I think the idea is of people in need of protection, of the fragility of art and the support it's granted by venues. There is an innocence in the idea of a \"play house,\" where people are free to explore new modes of behavior without fear of coercion.\n\nSomeone in this town is trying to burn the playhouse down. I believe this concept is illustrated in this case, where the someone is named Frank Winstead\n\nKing David slew goliath with a rock he wound a string around. People who believe in God are in trouble, so we need shelter in the crib. Jewish priests wear prosthetic foreheads to show their devotion to God and his messengers, who had large heads.\n\nI have always thought this song was about ideologies, beliefs and the way that these things can cause conflict. Blind adherence to any belief system often manifests as absurd behaviours. The song depicts two groups: one that wants a rock to tie a string around (an absurd behaviour); another that wants prosthetic foreheads to wear on their real heads (another absurd behaviour). Both of these practices could coexist - they aren't natural opposites. Yet, the two groups are constantly trying to tear \"the playhouse\" (the world) down. Their violent fight to practice their absurd behaviour is further exacerbated by two perceptions (common to ideological beliefs) that: 1) there's \"some one\" in the town trying to stop them from practicing their behaviour and 2) \"everybody\" wants to practice the behaviour. Yet, none of them seem to realise that if anybody is trying to stop their behaviour then it isn't possible that everybody wants to practice the behaviour. Consequently, through blind observance of their beliefs each group makes itself an enemy of the other group (literal, \"othering\").\n\nThe behaviours themselves mirror numerous practices in various belief systems though I doubt that they are literal references to any one practice or belief system in particular. For example, Indigenous American cultures would tie strings around various things and hang them in trees for some religious purposes. Numerous religious and spiritualist people wear amulets (literally, rocks with strings attached) with a belief in their efficacy or power. The Tefillin in Jewish religious observance is worn on the forehead much like a prosthetic forehead might be. I don't think the nature of the practice being described in the song is particularly significant; rather, the fact that these ridiculous practices have been imbued with the highest level of significance for the groups in the song is the important thing.\n\nThe authors voice in the song is quite clearly mocking the groups as infantile. Their world is a playhouse. Their revolution is throwing \"the crib door wide\" and letting the people \"crawl inside\" like babies. Yet, ultimately, like children they are fighting over things that really don't matter. -FG\n\nA call for art and free thought[edit]\n\nMy guess is that everybody wants a few things and are threatened by one thing.\n\nFirst, he wants to plan on his retirement where he can take his leisure and use his savings for a \"piece of string and a rock to wind the string around\". This is not some random activity to do in his free time. Rather, this is any artistic expression of something that takes time to do. The string and rock metaphor could be any type of creativity that he could afford in his retirement years. His advise is that if he were smart, he would save up for that. It may not be retirement, but creativity is certainly something he wants to save up for, so he doesn't need to rely on his 9 to 5 job.\n\nSecond, if he were a carpenter (i.e. no college), he'd break open his piggy bank and spend $70,000 on an education. However, he realizes that formal education is merely the echoing the thoughts (foreheads) of highly opinionated professors onto the brains (foreheads) of their 'tabla rasa' students. These are then nothing more than fake brains that you wear in front of people to impress them with how large your brain (forehead) is.\n\nLastly, there's a threat from someone who wants to 'burn the playhouse down'. That could mean that there are people who are trying to stop others from practicing personal expression through art (pro rocks and strings) and free thought (anti prosthetic foreheads). His solution is for like-minded people to open their homes (throw the crib door wide) and let creative people gather inside to express themselves.\n\n174.85.97.253 12:33, 16 September 2020 (EDT)\n\nMST3K Interpretaion[edit]\n\nI am watching \"Women of the Prehistoric Planet.\" There is a scene where a group of men must cross a log over a pool of burning crude oil. One man skips across with a \"rope\" which is more like a string. He ties his end to a tree, and someone on the first side spends an entire dialogue wiggling the other end around after it is already tied around - you guessed it - a rock. Thin resemblance, I know, but the reason I believe this is the inspiration is that one of the characters inexplicably has a shiny, apparently prosthetic, forehead on his real head!\n\nDwayne the \"Rock\" Johnson has an artificial forehead[edit]\n\nThis song is about Dwayne the \"Rock\" Johnson having an prosthetic forehead. He seriously injured his forehead in his wrestling days and is required to wear this prosthetic using a Velcro mechanism to make it in TV and movies. Without the prosthesis he would be known as Dwayne the \"ugly forehead\" Johnson. Wrestling really messed up his forehead.\n\nSource:Kevin Hart\n\n172.58.197.235 09:17, 10 January 2022 (EST)\n\nWehahuhah[edit]\n\nIve always veiwed this song as attemptin to impress upon the beauty and or fun of simplicity? Like someone else said inocence of childhood? And have you ever heard of the idea that smarter people tend to find joy much more easily? So everyome wants a rock and a prosthetic forehead: simple stuff is fun. Everyones tryna burn the playhouse down to stop them: possibly sayin others tend to dislike people who dont flock their feather yknow? Someone else mentioned the hammer on the piglet: piggy bank: also very simple, but follows better the idea of childhood and most of this idea derives of the first few linez saying where was i forgot my point: meaning their scatter brained but then the idea of the rock and string hit them i guess, \"i said if i was smart that i woul...\" yeah dead giveaway in my eyes. All of it points to the beauty in simplicity if you ask me Uhm sign it? Okay anon: 1223 am how do i upload what?\n\nBIBLICAL[edit]\n\nWe Want A Rock = a comedy way of saying \"I wanna rock\" but GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT because... EVERYTHING HAS MEANING. EVERYTHING. WWG1WGA (JFK bell. Look it up) (from the album FLOOD, which is BIBLICAL)\n\nAre you ready... (frogger) to ROCK?... (on this ROCK I will build my church)\n\n... = connect the dots and THINK! THINK HARD!\n\nsong was first played Dec 05, 1989 Dec 05 = (only TMBG will understand... The beginning (the rock) and the end (the beginning of the end in biblical terms...)\n\nWhere was I? I forgot = the \"swiss cheese\" brain of the unicorn (miracle) from \"The Last Unicorn\". The WIZARD goes on this historic journey to the end of the earth to free the rest of the unicorns (the 144,000 miracle children of light allegory) from The Red Bull. Moses brought his brother to Egypt... The Red Bull is scary but it's just a hologram really. Doesn't have REAL power, just an illusion of the mind, per se. Red in color, like the illusion of The Devil. Satan isn't really red but that's what he eats... Satan is out for blood, literally. \"Where was I, I forgot\" also means you know so much that it's HARD to focus because EVERYTHING came at you at once because MULTIPLE MEANINGS EXIST. \"Mind blown = Where was I. I forgot.\" They do. TMBG knows this. The first line of the song I could go on forever tbh.\n\nThe point (.) that I was making = The point \".\" The POINT is the unicorn HORN. It went missing when the wizard turned the unicorn into a mortal female human. Anyone who's seen \"The Last Unicorn\" understands this. Watch it. Awesome, dark animation with America singing the soundtrack. Think of that allegory. Jimmy Webb wrote all the music/lyrics (Highwayman Galveston... city at the end of the earth. Allegorical once again) With this simple, genius statement that TMBG made, I could also go on forever.\n\nOk, now for the 3rd line... 1,2,3...\n\nI said if I was smart than I would = S.M.A.R.T. SMART criteria: S.M.A.R.T. is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of goals and objectives that are assumed to give better results, for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal development. The term was first proposed by George T. Doran in the November 1981 issue of Management Review.[1] He suggested that goals should be SMART (specific, measurable, assignable, realistic and time-related). Look up the rest online. It's also an acronym for https://smart.ojp.gov/about SMART Mission To assist with implementation of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act and provide assistance to criminal justice professionals across the entire spectrum of sex offender management activities needed to ensure public safety.\n\nPedophiles are in the bible. \"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.\" Mark 9:42 (the evil ones will have the mark of the beast...) The Millstone is THE ROCK. The string is THE ROPE.\n\nRevelation 21:8 ESV But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”\n\nLuke 17:1-37 And he said to his disciples, “Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” ...\n\nIn order to understand the Bible (I'm not a scholar), you must understand allegories or you will ONLY take it literally.\n\nmore verses regarding the rock to wind a string around. EVERYBODY wants a rock to wind a piece of string around = the whole world apparently wants to kill all sides off. Think, \"This group wishes this group were erased from the face of the earth. And this group wishes this group were erased from the face of the earth. So on and so forth.\" It just doesn't stop. IMHO, Trump could quite possibly be the ONLY ONE that could lay down the law in good and bad ways to STOP WW III. Think THE FINAL BATTLE... Apocolypse/Book of Revelation. Biden for fuck's sake isn't going to stop Jack Shit. (Jesus freed me so I can say whatever the fuck I want :)\n\nHere's more verses (verses is allegorical... On this ROCK I'll build my church...) https://www.openbible.info/topics/pedophiles\n\nOk, line 4. PS TMBG's are genius's, more than you know.\n\nSave up for a piece of string = Get your money together first so you can, like Trump, NOT TAKE ANYBODY'S MONEY and do it RIGHT! Don't sell out! What does a UNICORN's horn look like? A ROPE!\n\nOn The Last Unicorn (watch it!), the Wizard transforms the unicorn into a mortal female woman (or did God really do the real magic?...) so even SHE didn't know what was going on so she could be put into the STING OPERATION of SAVING. SAVING. SAVING... THE OTHER UNICORNS (all of you, ALL OF YOU ARE MIRACLES from GOD). Think, \"Got to get back to the garden from CSN&Y) Get back to the Garden of Eden. THE BEGINNING AND THE END. Watch The Last Unicorn and try to understand ALL THE ALLEGORIES. Do the same with TMBG's. LISTEN!...\n\nAnd a rock to wind a string around = Woah, this is heavy (back to the future). The anchor at the bottom of the ocean is also an ALLEGORY to the ROCK/Millstone millstone noun One of a pair of cylindrical stones used in a mill for GRINDING GRAIN... A source of worry or distress. \"a responsibility that became a millstone.\"\n\nTHINK!\n\nThe Lord will SEPARATE the wheat from the weeds at the end. We must get rid of true evil for all diverse people of God's Earth to prosper. We must all be OUR OWN UNIQUE SELVES. God made us all different FOR A REASON. We are all experts in our OWN FIELD. (Think farmers that own \"their field\")\n\nTHE ENTIRE BIBLE IS AN ALLEGORY FOR YOU TO EXPAND YOUR MIND, GET YOUR MIND BLOWN, BE HAPPY AND MOVE FORWARD)\n\nYou think TMBG's is just SILLY NONSENSE?! The world won't know what hit them when they discover THE TRUTH. The MOAB (Mother Of All Bombs aka a NuCLEAR War Head) (there are sexual innuendos to that too lol) The MOAB = YOUR MIND WILL BE BLOWN (an allegory) to who the REAL children of light ACTUALLY ARE.\n\nYOU!\n\nGuess what The Bible says about the end. The end won't be for everyone. THAT MEANS TRUE EVIL WILL BE ERASED AND HEAVEN ON EARTH WILL BE HERE FOR EVERYONE!\n\nYOU. WIN!\n\nOk, I'll try to do the rest more efficiently now that you've caught on.\n\nThrow the crib door wide = crib is the beginning... go back to your roots. Also, a bad meaning exists that the evil ones know what they've been doing...\n\nLet the people (WE THE PEOPLE) crawl inside = When you see the lord, you will be weak and get on your knees. EVERYONE WILL. Including the evil ones. running for shelter when the day of The Lord (the LAND lord) comes...\n\nSomeone in this town is trying to burn the PLAYHOUSE down...= The FAKE JEWS (not the real Jews) (Israeli Govt. for one. Did you know the real Jews know about their own government is causing all this shit?) GOD gave us this world, IT'S OURS. \"We want the world and we want it... NOW. Right mama (Mother Earth). NNNOOOOOWWWWW!!!!\" - Jim Morrison\n\nYou've all been already going to church and you didn't even realize it. Fun huh?\n\nLet me interject. Remember this. Seriously. this: IT'S GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. Don't tell anybody but here's a secret: we already won. :)\n\nWho do you think WANTS TO STOP THE ONES who want a rock to tie a string around? Everyone who worships death, not life.\n\nWhat religions want death for their enemies? There's your answer...\n\nIf you celebrate death, you hate life. If I were you, and hated LIFE, I'd quit that right now because your days are numbered. FAST!\n\nWhen you FAST, you suffer (it's easy actually) and then your future (your food) TASTES MUCH BETTER. It's literal AND AN ALLEGORY. You also remove PARASITES from your \"body\" (mother earth) and cleanse (only drink water) aka FLOOD (think TMBG's FLOOD...)\n\nC'mon people :) THINK!\n\nSimple Gematria is also involved here but that's a whole other ball of WACKS lol\n\nIF I WERE A CARPENTER... I'd hammer on my piglet (piggy bank) = Once again, like I said way above, GET YOUR MONEY TOGETHER and do God's work. Who was a CARPENTER?\n\nAre you ready?\n\nJesus AND the 144,000 Who are the 144,000? YOU ARE! Don't believe me? Listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgcUDcDE7tk\n\nsong: I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal (But I'm Gonna Be A Diamond Someday) look up the lyrics.\n\nThey want to stop the ones who want prosthetic foreheads on their heads But everybody wants prosthetic foreheads on their real heads = the 144,000 HAVE BEEN MASKED! Once again, think THE LAST UNICORN (watch it!) At the beginning of the movie, the unicorn didn't even know she was one because she'd never seen another in her forest (for rest... the easy life) then THE LAST UNICORN (the 3rd eye is the REAL sight of the you and the world and most importantly: GOD), THE LAST UNICORN goes on this incredible journey (think National Lampoons Vacation) and on this journey she discovers the evils of the world but MUST DO IT to SAVE THE REST OF THE UNICORNS (remember, YOU are the MIRACLE UNICORNS per se. AN ALLEGORY!) and then she faces what looks like Satan (The Red Bull) (the energy drink where you CAN NOT SLEEP if you drink it) The evil ones \"work like the devil\" because that's what life is when you LIE LIE LIE LIE. You have to always fight to remember the lie to keep up with the lie. Think, \"You're Cheatin' Heart\" by Hank Williams. He went through hell and is saved because HE WON'T LIE AGAIN BECAUSE IT JUST SUCKS to live that way.\n\nMultiple answers ALWAYS EXIST and I just can't do it all. It's not possible. But you \"get the drift\".\n\nThis may be the longest de-code of a TMBG song. Amirite?\n\nPS. Who says \"Who's your favorite band?\" TMBG and who says \"Who's your favorite president?\"...\n\nWho's the band called \"The Presidents Of The United States of America\"? Now, how would that be possible...\n\nMaybe... POWER WILL BE GIVEN BACK TO WE THE PEOPLE. Making US (think allegory) THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! Once again, think allegory because using all caps means, in legal terms, CORPORATION.\n\nWe are NOT a corporation anymore. Trump dissolved the corporation and GAVE IT BACK TO US, WE THE PEOPLE! I'm using ALL CAPS because I'm screaming it :)\n\nYou'll have to use your own judgement from now on to know what EXACTLY (stressed) is being said exactly...\n\nAlso, who was called, \"John John\"?\n\n)\n\n-END-\n\nTrends[edit]\n\nI believe this song is about how trends and trendy items aren't any more inherently valuable than other ideas or items.\n\n\"I said if I was smart that I would Save up for a piece of string And a rock to wind the string around\"\n\nThese could either be referring to a person with enough influence to make a trend, or a person caught up in a trend.\n\n\"Everybody wants a rock To wind a piece of string around Everybody wants a rock To wind a piece of string around\"\n\nThis is showing the trend, everybody wants this now.\n\n\"Throw the crib door wide Let the people crawl inside\"\n\nPeople are easily controllable, they do whatever you want.\n\n\"They want to stop the ones who want A rock to wind a string around But everybody wants a rock To wind a piece of string around\"\n\nThis is people who are not part of the popular culture or someone attempting to create a new trend.\n\nThe rest of the song consists of the same sentiment over again, likely from the people who were mentioned above."
