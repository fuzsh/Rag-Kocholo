        "text": "How do you compile a list of the one hundred greatest rock and roll and pop music artists of all time and not have it be purely subjective? How do you quantify it?\n\nI put together a formula that will attempt to do just that. I used a system to rank the music acts and at the end of the article I have included links to the sources used in case you would like to do further research.\n\nIt should be noted, that this list leaves off numerous top selling acts that would be best classified as Country Music such as Garth Brooks and Johnny Cash or old standards artists such as Frank Sinatra. Rap artist are included since many of them have crossed over onto the pop charts and are being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nStep 1: Albums sold received the most weight. You might think this would be a straight forward process but there are wildly varying numbers given depending on your source. I used sources from RIAA and Billboard then averaged them. I used six different compilations in total to eliminate most errors. From that list I then cut it down to a list of 150 musical acts.\n\nStep 2: After I had my list of the 150 highest selling musical acts of all time, I next wanted to give them points based on critical review. Obviously, this is far more subjective than their sales numbers, so I used a variety of sources such as \"best of\" lists and \"greatest ever\" rankings from well known websites and magazines and added a value to each of those numbers from best to worst and added it to the point total I got in step one. Critical review carried about half the weight as did sales numbers and Billboard chart rankings. This should eliminate the bias between the two as the critics were literally all over the place.\n\nWithout further delay, here are the 100 Greatest Acts in Rock and Popular Music. There also is a podcast special discussing this list in further detail if you are interested in more detail about the process used to put the list together. The number after the name is the total points they accumulated so you can judge for yourself the gap between the acts.\n\n1) The Beatles - 1363 pts.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison) were head and shoulders above everyone else. The Beatles performed strongly in every category from album sales, to chart success, to critical acclaim. I have personally stated many times that I felt The Beatles were overrated but the statistics show that I am clearly wrong. The Beatles are indisputably the best Rock & Pop music act ever.\n\nWhen I first tried to imagine what this list might look like, I knew The Beatles would finish strong but I wasn’t sure if they would finish above Elvis or Michael Jackson but it soon became clear as list after list, critic after critic, and sales chart after sales chart confirmed that The Beatles were massively beloved and extraordinarily influential.\n\nAs you might imagine, I read a lot of rock and roll related biographies and the vast majority of them somewhere credit The Beatles with inspiring them or getting them into music. Beatlemania was a little before my time so I didn’t live through the hottest time of it so I can only imagine what it must have been like at it’s peak. The Beatles are an absolute phenomenon. They are also the greatest rock and pop music act of all time.\n\n2) Elvis Presley - 1319 pts.\n\nThe King of Rock & Roll remains the King. As you can imagine, Elvis performed strongly in every category, especially sales, but he also did well in critical acclaim too. I can only imagine how insane his numbers would be had he lived past the age of forty-two, gotten himself in shape, and updated his music style to a more modern take and released albums into the 1980's.\n\nElvis Presley, a boy from a two room house in Tupelo, MS, became the second greatest Rock & Pop music artist in history and didn't live past the age of forty-two. Let that sink in for a minute. Elvis’ star burned incredibly bright but only for a short time in the overall scheme of things but to a certain generation he is the biggest megastar of all time. In fact, in Americana there are a few certain celebrities who manage to transcend being a star into becoming something even bigger, a fixture of American culture. Muhammad Ali, Michael Jackson, and Elvis come to mind.\n\nI actually expected Elvis to finish first ahead of The Beatles but after reading numerous articles and critical reviews it seems that most saw that The Beatles evolved their music with their later offerings being far more mature and complex than their earlier ones. Elvis never truly evolved his style. Elvis songs in the mid-1970s still sounded like 1950s music in a lot of ways while more contemporary acts like Led Zeppelin were doing music far more interesting. Keep in mind Elvis was only around forty at that point he could have still easily advanced his style and been making relevant music into the early 1980s but, sadly, his life ended in 1977.\n\n3) The Rolling Stones - 1289 pts.\n\nI expected Michael Jackson to end up number three, and on the sales charts he is, but The Rolling Stones (Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, and Ian Stewart) gathered enough points during the critical acclaim portion of the ranking system to pass the King of Pop.\n\nIt seems every critic loved The Rolling Stones. I fully expected to see them in the top five greatest rock and roll acts of all time but I did not expect to see them at number three. I guess they finally got some satisfaction. It also helped that The Rolling Stones continued rocking seemingly forever. The never ending touring schedule of The Rolling Stones keep them perpetually exposed to new generations of fans and their music is largely timeless. While Elvis can seem dated there is some quality about The Rolling Stones that isn’t.\n\nAgain, The Rolling Stones heyday was just a bit before my time. I came along listening to music in the 1970s and in retrospect I sort of viewed The Rolling Stones as a more hardcore version of The Beatles. I’m still not sure that I’m very far off base on that but I do know one thing, when I think about the term “rock and roll” The Rolling Stones are the first thing that comes to mind.\n\n4) Michael Jackson - 1266 pts.\n\nThe King of Pop, Michael Jackson, was one of the most thrilling (see what I did there?), charismatic, and talented performers in music history. He also sold a whole lot of albums and dominated the charts during the 1980's. But… there is also controversy.\n\nI noticed when compiling the statistics during the critical acclaim portion of the rankings that critics began backing off on Michael Jackson during the period where he was facing some very serious legal allegations involving children. I believe this critical freeze period hurt him and probably kept him out of the number three spot. Several \"Top\" and \"Greatest\" lists from the later years of his life omitted him or placed him significantly further down the charts than his talent and sales would suggest he should be.\n\nIt’s hard for people to separate the art from the artist and in Michael Jackson’s case it has significantly hurt his place in history. Before all the allegations, documentaries, and news stories about his interactions with various children came to light, his accomplishments, performances, and critical reviews would have given him a serious contention for the greatest rock and pop artist of all time. With all the controversy now surrounding the life of Michael Jackson it’s my guess that his status and place in history may only continue to fall.\n\n5) Led Zeppelin - 1231 pts.\n\nI have noticed a small but vocal Led Zeppelin backlash over the last few years. I have heard on television shows, podcasts, and radio programs multiple times recently that Led Zeppelin is overrated. Sales suggest otherwise.\n\nWhile Led Zeppelin did about as well as expected in critical acclaim, their sales numbers were staggering and they were easily in the top ten during the entire process. I believe the facts firmly show that Led Zeppelin (Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham) are certainly not overrated. They are, in fact, one of the greatest musical acts of all time.\n\nThe rise of Greta Van Fleet has also brought new attention to the music of Led Zeppelin. The sound-alike newcomers have, if nothing else, brought a nostalgia back for straight forward guitar and drum driven rock and roll with soaring powerhouse vocals out front. Led Zeppelin did that better than anyone.\n\nIt also helps that members of this band are considered among the best in their particular arts. John Bonham very often sits near the top of “best drummers of all time” lists. Jimmy Page often is near the top of “best guitarist of all time” lists and Robert Plant also places highly anything singers and frontmen are ranked. Led Zeppelin had the talent, the sales, and the support to be one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.\n\n6) Madonna - 1197 pts.\n\n26) Celine Dion - 936 pts.\n\nAgain, Celine Dion is not my cup of tea. She falls too close to that Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond \"not really rock and roll but still on the pop charts\" territory for me. That being said, she has a great voice and has sold an enormous amount of albums. She got virtually no critical support.\n\n27) Stevie Wonder - 933 pts.\n\nStevie Wonder performed amazingly well and it comes as no surprise. Fans love Stevie Wonder and bought his albums in droves. He performed well on the singles charts too and critics love him. Stevie Wonder is one of the few R&B stars to escape the bias of that genre's lower than pop numbers sales with several big mainstream crossover hits.\n\n28) Chicago - 932 pts.\n\nI feel vindicated. I have been a Chicago fan since the 1970's and I never expected them to chart this high. I'm not going to even try to list all the members of this band over the years, there are seemingly dozens, but you know the major players: Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, Walt Parazaider, Terry Kath (d.), Danny Seraphine (f.), and many more. They received virtually no critical acclaim but their album sales and chart success was enormous.\n\n29) Rod Stewart - 922 pts.\n\nI'm actually surprised Rod Stewart finished this low. His sales were terrific but he received very little critical support, less than I expected.\n\n30) Bee Gees - 920 pts.\n\nThe brothers Gibb (Barry, Robin, and Maurice) made a nice showing for themselves. Consider this, they had very few hits outside of the 1970's disco era and because they were, well, disco, they got virtually no critical support. In other words, though the disco era was short lived the Bee Gees ruled it and people bought lots of it.\n\n31) Eminem - 916 pts.\n\nEminem will likely only go up from here. He is one of the most significant of the modern era acts. The bias against modern era acts is that the older acts have had longer to sell their albums and the acts with longevity have had more albums to sell. Eminem has been around long enough now to amass a significant number of album sales and is still active in the music business. While his biggest and most successful days are probably behind him he is still relevant in pop culture and his albums still move. He also had a significant degree of support from critics.\n\n32) Van Halen - 914 pts.\n\nVan Halen is one of the harder rocking acts to make the list. Van Halen enjoyed two very distinct periods of chart success, once with David Lee Roth as lead singer, the other with Sammy Hagar fronting the band. Critical success was significant due mainly to the incredible guitar skills of Eddie Van Halen.\n\n33) Phil Collins - 913 pts.\n\nPhil Collins placed lower than I anticipated. Collins was a monster hit maker in the 1980's into the early 1990's before falling off the charts and even retiring for a period of time. While most of Phil Collin's support came from album sales and chart success, he also had considerable critical success too. Phil Collins is also on the top 100 list again as a member of Genesis. Everyone on Earth air drums to In the Air Tonight including Mike Tyson and probably you too.\n\n34) Nirvana - 895 pts.\n\nNirvana is an extremely influential band who had enormous chart success in the early to mid-1990's. Nirvana would likely have placed much higher had they had a longer run but the personal demons and ultimate death of frontman Kurt Cobain ended Nirvana. They have maintained this position through significant critical support and are likely to remain high on the list into the coming years.\n\n35) Bon Jovi - 873 pts.\n\nBon Jovi is interesting in that you would obviously expect them to be on the list since they were a huge hit making machine in the 1980's. But despite long periods of inactivity and lack of critical support, Bon Jovi has still remained somehow relevant largely due to charismatic and charming frontman Jon Bon Jovi and enormous continuing album sales.\n\n36) Taylor Swift - 871 pts.\n\nTaylor Swift is, far and away, the most significant of the current day acts on the list. Unless something massively changes, she is probably destined for the top 25, perhaps even the top 10. Current day acts are hampered by the amount of time they have had to sell albums, the changing music industry which has moved away from album sales in general, and also lack of critical support. Taylor Swift, however, has moved massive amounts of albums and held a dominance over the pop charts. It's only up from here for Taylor Swift.\n\n37) The Doors - 868 pts.\n\nI personally am not a fan of The Doors but I am not surprised to find them here. They had a large amount of critical success and the late frontman Jim Morrison has a large cult following.\n\n38) Janet Jackson - 860 pts.\n\nJanet Jackson made the top 50 due entirely to chart performance and album sales. She was a powerhouse, hit making machine, during her peak. However, she received virtually no critical support in the lists used.\n\n39) The Who - 851 pts.\n\nI was shocked to see how low The Who ranked on this list. While they had tremendous critical acclaim, their album sales and chart performance fell below my expectations. Even when studying the UK charts I was surprised to find them a little below where I anticipated. Still, being in the top 50 music acts in history is a tremendous accomplishment.\n\n40) Santana - 836 pts.\n\nSantana is another act that performed better than I expected. Santana performed well in album sales, moderately in chart success, but best of all in critical acclaim.\n\n41) Def Leppard - 825 pts.\n\nDef Leppard were massively successful in the 1980's with a string of chart topping albums including the mega-selling Hysteria. While they got very little critical support, album sales, chart success, and continuous touring helped to put this band in the top 50 music acts of all time. It should be noted that despite being one of the top 50 acts of all time they are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and did not get the 10 point bonus that came with that honor. Still, even had they gotten it they would not have passed Santana.\n\n42) The Carpenters - 821 pts.\n\nI was just a kid when The Carpenters were a big deal. I was surprised to find out what a large selling act they were. They did strongly on the charts and got significant critical acclaim.\n\n43) Foreigner - 817 pts.\n\nForeigner were a radio staple of my teenage years. They were played in heavy rotation then and even now on classic rock radio stations. Obviously, their massive ballad I Want to Know What Love Is helped place them this high. They got virtually no critical support. Again, despite being one of the fifty biggest musical acts in history they are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and did not get the ten point bonus. Had they gotten it they would have passed The Carpenters and Def Leppard on the list.\n\n44) Journey - 815 pts.\n\nJourney is a great, and historically under appreciated, band. They are finally getting their due with a recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Steve Perry is one of the greatest vocalist of all time and Neil Schon is a great guitarist. The When It Was Cool family saw Journey last year (now with vocalist Arnel Pineda) and they put on a great show.\n\n45) Jay Z - 814 pts.\n\nJay Z and his wife Beyonce have established a pop culture empire. They are virtually everywhere you look in 2017, that's why I was surprised how low both of them placed on the all-time list. I expected their album sales to be considerably higher than what they are but I think that is more a commentary on the music industry than an indictment of them. Overall album sales were lower than expected, chart performance was lower than expected, and critical acclaim was virtually non-existent. I still expect both to only go up from here as the numbers continue to come it.\n\n46) Backstreet Boys - 813 pts.\n\nBackstreet's back alright? Every few years it seems there is a powerhouse boy band that pops up, sells a bazillion records, then fades into obscurity. The Backstreet Boys have shown considerably more staying power than others of their ilk. Obviously, critical support was non-existent, their ranking was obtained solely from album sales and chart success.\n\n47) Britney Spears - 803 pts.\n\nBritney Spears was another act that I expected to place higher. While she has kept her name in the spotlight, her album and chart success hasn't come close to matching her early fame. As you might imagine, there was zero (perhaps even negative) critical support. Her chart placement comes from the millions of albums sold and chart success.\n\n48) Simon & Garfunkel - 800 pts.\n\nLike a Bridge Over Troubled Waters... what an amazing song. Simon and Garfunkel performed well in virtually every metric including album sales and chart success but their biggest boost came from massive critical support.\n\n49) Bob Marley - 799 pts.\n\nThe face of Reggae music, Bob Marley's sales figures exceeded my expectations. While his singles chart success was limited he was adored by critics putting him solidly in the top 50 music acts of all time.\n\n50) Linda Ronstadt - 792 pts.\n\nWhen will I be loved? It looks like Linda Ronstadt always was. It doesn't hurt that her backing band was made up of members that eventually became The Eagles. Linda Ronstadt was a big album seller and chart topper in the 1970's.\n\n51) Aretha Franklin - 791 pts.\n\nAretha Franklin was hurt by the lower sales numbers of R&B acts but benefited greatly from longevity and critical acclaim.\n\n52) Eric Clapton - 782 pts.\n\nEric Clapton performed significantly lower than I expected. Again, his critical support was great but his overall sales fell below my expectations.\n\n53) Jimi Hendrix - 779 pts.\n\nJimi Hendrix is yet another act who got a big boost from critical support. His sales were also good but he wasn't a big singles chart topper. He also died very young which hurt his longevity.\n\n54) Paul McCartney - 776 pts.\n\nWhile Paul McCartney is at number one as part of The Beatles, his singles career also did very good sales figures, strong enough to place him on the chart again as a solo artist at number 54.\n\n55) 2 Pac - 767 pts.\n\nFar and away the biggest hardcore rap act in the rankings. 2 Pac got a big boost from critics as well and is a member of the rock and roll hall fame.\n\n56) Lionel Richie - 755 pts.\n\nSmooth Lionel Richie was a big chart success in the 1980's following his stint in the critically acclaimed The Commodores. Lionel Richie had massive album sales and chart success.\n\n57) Bob Seger - 745 pts.\n\nBob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band are one of those acts that I think gets overlooked a little bit. They were constantly on the charts, their albums sold very well, and they had some critical acclaim. They did their job consistently well and that has earned them a place in the top one hundred acts of all time.\n\n58) Genesis - 741 pts.\n\nPhil Collins arrives on our list for the second time, this time as a member of Genesis. While they gained some critical acclaim early on it was their tremendous run as a top charting act in the 1980's that earned them enough points to make the list.\n\n59) David Bowie - 735 pts.\n\nI was stunned that David Bowie ranked so low on the overall list. I expected his sales and chart success to be greater than it was. I also expected his critical acclaim to be better represented. It seemed to me critics raved about him constantly but when I began to compare list after list after list, Bowie was often referenced in the middle of the pack. There are obviously huge supporters of Bowie but consistently his acclaim was milder than I anticipated.\n\n60) James Taylor - 731 pts.\n\nAgain, I have a hard time considering James Taylor a rock and roll act but he had significant representation in album sales and some chart success. As you might imagine, he had a fair degree of critical support also.\n\n61) John Mellencamp - 722 pts.\n\nI like John Mellencamp a lot. I expected him to have more critical backing than he did but his chart success was good in the 1980's and he sold a ton of albums.\n\n62) Creedence Clearwater Revival - 717 pts.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) is another group I expect to perform better. I had assumed their album sales were stronger than what they were since everyone I knew as a kid owned their greatest hits album. They had good sales numbers, decent chart numbers, but were lacking in critical support though John Fogerty was occasionally mentioned.\n\n63) Rihanna - 716 pts.\n\nRihanna was another strong recent act that sold albums in such significant numbers that, despite lack of critical support, still managed to place in the top 100. Obviously, she was a strong performer on the charts as well.\n\n64) Boys II Men - 715 pts.\n\nBoys II Men managed to be the most enduring of the vocal R&B harmony groups of the 1990's. They had overwhelming chart success and sold a lot of albums in a relatively short period of time but also managed to have consistent staying power despite falling out of mainstream pop culture.\n\n65) Lynyrd Skynyrd - 712 pts.\n\nThe face of southern rock music, Lynyrd Skynyrd were a staple of radio in the 1970's. While much of the band was killed in a plane crash in 1977, they reformed and continued as a significant touring act to this very day. They obviously haven't been hurt by having two major anthemic songs \"Freebird\" and \"Sweet Home Alabama\". They also had more critical support than I expected.\n\n66) Rush - 709 pts.\n\nI wasn't sure if my favorite band would make the top 100 or not but I'm proud to say that Rush made it. They had no chart success. Zero. Individually, they had tremendous critical acclaim but critics wouldn't put that all together for the band itself. Geddy Lee often topped the best bassist list. Neil Peart, more often than not, was listed as the greatest drummer of all time. Alex Lifeson often made the best guitarist list. But guess what? When it came time to give Rush their due as a group- nothing. Fans made the decision themselves by buying their albums.\n\n67) Pearl Jam - 698 pts.\n\nWhile grunge was an influential movement in the early to mid-1990's, the album sales numbers for the genre, over all, were less than you might expect. Still, the big two grunge acts made the top 100 of all time list. While clearly Nirvana ranked higher, Pearl Jam did very well for themselves and still remain a beloved act to this day.\n\n68) R. Kelly - 697 pts.\n\nR. Kelly was another artist who broke free of the low sales curse of the R&B genre. R. Kelly had a lot of sales and chart success though little critical acclaim.\n\n69) Tom Petty (and the Heart Breakers) - 693 pts.\n\nTom Petty and the Heart Breakers have been radio staples since I was in High School. Tom Petty has had steady album sales, chart success, and a fair degree of critical support. He continues to tour to this day.\n\n70) The Police - 692 pts.\n\nI also expected The Police to chart higher. While they did have several radio hits and sold a sizable amount of albums they were also helped tremendously by factoring in critical support.\n\n71) KISS - 687 pts.\n\nI want to rock and roll all night and party everyday! When I think of ROCK AND ROLL I think of KISS. Believe it or not, KISS was actually patterned after the number one act- The Beatles. They were a group of four band members who each would write and sing and play... only with make-up, fire breathing, and pyrotechnics. God gave rock and roll to you and KISS makes the top 100 greatest acts of all time.\n\n72) REM - 684 pts.\n\nREM was the face of the college music scene during their heyday. They had several big charting hits, sold a considerable amount of records, and had solid critical acclaim.\n\n73) Red Hot Chili Peppers - 676 pts.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers were a really big act during the early to mid-1990's and had a lot of chart and sales success. Critics even came around to them giving them good well rounded support to land in the top 100.\n\n74) ZZ Top - 675 pts.\n\nI've always felt ZZ Top were underrated. They had strong sales and sizable chart success in the 1980's. They are finally beginning to get some critical praise as well.\n\n75) Ozzy Osbourne - 667 pts.\n\nRounding out the top 75 is the madman of metal and hard rock- Ozzy Osbourne. The Oz-Man cometh in at number 75. While he had no chart success to speak of, he sold lots of albums.\n\n- The Next 25 -"
