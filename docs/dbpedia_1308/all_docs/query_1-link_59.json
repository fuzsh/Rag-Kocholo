        "text": "By Martine Ehrenclou\n\nIn the heat of summer, we are full-on into music festival season. Which means more than our fair share of live music! Which rock bands are on your radar?\n\nRock is alive and well, and in fact, it’s experiencing a resurgence. And I don’t mean older classic rock bands that are still around. I’m talking about current bands who have created a new sound, some with vintage influences.\n\nSome might think that rock is dead. That is just not true. Rock is the second leading genre across the world, with pop first and hip-hop/rap coming in at third. But it depends where you live—in the US hip-hop/rap is the leading genre and in Europe pop and rock are the dominant genres.\n\nRegardless, there’s nothing like rock music cranked loud. Here’s some outstanding music from the U.S., UK, Canada, France, Scandinavia and other parts of the world. Some draw influences from some of the greats, and others have a new contemporary rock sound all their own. Each of these modern rock bands are hand-picked and most have new and upcoming albums.\n\nThis is real music by real musicians. A few of these bands are fairly well known and others are on the crest. Each demands to be heard at peak volume to get that rock experience. The thrill of music discovery is real. And I hear it all the time that people have no idea there’s so much great new rock music. If you’re ready to rock out, read on.\n\nI tried my best to include straight up rock artists and bands, and not lean into blues-rock or Southern rock. A couple might have slipped through but they are just that good. You’ll find killer bands that rock. Hard.\n\nEach band/artist has links to info and videos.\n\nSpotify Playlist Below.\n\nI welcome your comments in the comment section below. Your suggestions are also welcomed. I hope you enjoy.\n\nBlack Country Communion\n\nIf this isn’t one of the most highly anticipated rock albums to come out sometime in the near future, I don’t know what is. Glenn Hughes (lead vocals, bass) tweeted about the band’s recording in Los Angeles and that their upcoming album BCC V is done. This supergroup includes guitarist Joe Bonamassa, vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple, The Dead Daisies), drummer Jason Bonham (Led Zeppelin) and keyboardist Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater, Alice Cooper). The band entered Sunset Sound studio in Hollywood California to record their fifth studio album. Glenn Hughes reported on twitter that 10 tracks were recorded and “there’s a lot of magical music being made.” Can we please have a release date? We can’t wait.\n\nVideo Here\n\nInfo Here\n\nMammoth WVH\n\nWolfgang Van Halen, yes the son of that Van Halen, is set to release Mammoth II August 4th. The guitarist, singer, songwriter recorded the new 10-track set at 5150 Studio. Grammy nominated for his first single “Another Celebration At The End Of The World,” Mammoth WVH live band includes Frank Sidoris (guitars), Jon Jourdan (guitars), Ronnie Ficarro (Bass) and Garrett Whitlock (drums). A high energy rocker, Wolfgang wrote all the songs and performed the instrumentation and vocals himself. He just announced a North American Tour with Nita Strauss.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nHannah Wicklund\n\nAcclaimed rock guitarist, singer, songwriter Hannah Wicklund is set to release her new album ‘The Prize’ on October 13, produced by Sam Kiszka (bassist Greta Van Fleet). The 10 songs on The Prize serve as a rock ‘n roll roadmap to a crossroads that Wicklund has been unknowingly gravitating towards for over a decade. Wicklund recently did a run of shows with fellow guitar slinger Marcus King and continues to headline shows and tour with Greta Van Fleet.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nThe Dust Coda\n\nLondon-based rock and roll outfit The Dust Coda very recently released their new album ‘Loco Paradise,’ the new-style classic rock album you’ve been waiting for all year. The Dust Coda is a talented, four-piece group that generates a non-derivative rock sound built on the bedrock of great songwriting and high-level musical skills. New spin, new sound. Check them out.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nMojothunder\n\nA four-piece rock band from Kentucky, this is a highly talented band that released their new album, Alive, with Friends in March of 2023. With a fire-power singer and tight band, this is high-energy rock with a Southern flavor. They’re dubbed the “Southern Alternative”. This is another recommendation from our followers/subscribers. We thank you!\n\nVideo\n\nMojothunder website\n\nAyron Jones\n\nRock guitarist, singer, songwriter Ayron Jones was nominated for Best New Rock Artist at the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards. A gritty, rocking musician whose album Chronicles of the Kid was released June of 2023, Jones makes his stake in heavy rock. A badass musician, this Seattle-born rocker’s song “Child Of The State” hit #1 on the Billboard Rock Chart. He is one of the few Black artists to achieve that. He’s opened for the Rolling Stones and performed with Guns N’ Roses and Public Enemy.\n\nVideo\n\nVideo\n\nAyron Jones website\n\nThem Dirty Roses\n\nSouthern rock with an emphasis on rock, I decided to include Them Dirty Roses because I really like them and we haven’t featured them before. Besides, you our readers recommended them and knowing your great musical taste, I decided to check them out. Soulful vocals and a tight band. Brothers James and Frank Ford along with their hometown friends Andrew Davis and Ben Crain formed the southern rock band. They are James Ford (vocals, guitar), Andrew Davis (guitar), Ben Crain (bass) and Frank Ford (drums.) They are good!\n\nVideo\n\nThem Dirty Roses website\n\nThe Warning\n\nSister rock trio The Warning have been recommended to us a few times. Thank you! Now we’re digging in. From Monterey Mexico Daniela “Dany” (vocals, guitars, piano), Paulina “Pau” (drums, vocals, piano) and Alejandra “Ale” Villarreal (bass, piano, backing vocals) released their last album ‘Error’ in June of 2022. The band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and spent 2022 headlining tours and also opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. In July of 2022 they toured the US supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless. They continued their headlining tours and in 2023 opened for Muse and in September will be opening for Guns N Roses.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Warning website\n\nDirty Honey\n\nThe rock band everyone’s talking about, Dirty Honey, announced their sophomore album Can’t Find The Brakes, set to release this Fall and very recently shared a new video “Won’t Take Me Alive.” Guitarist John Notto delivers the biggest riff you’re going to hear this year, one that will pummel your speakers and leave them begging for more. Marc LaBelle leads the charge from the vocal mic, with the voice and strut of a true rocker. Along with other band members Justin Smolian and Jaydon Bean, Dirty Honey has toured the world with Guns N’ Roses, KISS, Rival Sons, Mammoth WVH and more. Okay, some blues-rock in their songs I’ll admit, but they’re one of my favorites.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nOrianthi\n\nEven though Orianthi doesn’t have a new album out now, her last one Rock Candy (October 2022) is definitely worth a listen. Or two or three. This guitar slinger is on tour now and at the top of her melodic rock game on both guitar and vocals. She’s an explosive guitar player who can drop riffs and throw down solos with the best of them as well as a smooth, powerful singer with hit-single tone and authority.\n\nVideo and Info Here\n\nBlacktop Mojo\n\nTexas rock band Blacktop Mojo has one of the best rock vocalists around, Matt James. Since their self-titled album in 2022, they’ve released a few singles since then, and one of which is “Strike Me.” Their sound is built upon epic rocking beats, immense guitar riffs, and fired-up, intelligent vocals. Blacktop Mojo is a cultural force. The tight rhythm section is made up of Nathan Gillis (drums), Ryan Kiefer (guitar), Chuck Wepfer (guitar) and Matt Curtis (bass.) They have a new album set to release April 5, 2024 titled Pollen.\n\nVideo about the new album Here\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nGreta Van Fleet\n\nRegardless of which side of the fence you’re on with GVF, you have to admit this band has come a long way since their first album Anthem of a Peaceful Army. Their new album Starcatcher dropped July 21. The band is lead singer Josh Kizska, guitarist Jake Kizska, bassist/keyboardist Sam Kizska and drummer Danny Wagner. The new album was produced by Grammy-winning producer Dave Cobb\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nBlack Stone Cherry\n\nOne of Kentucky’s favorite rockers Black Stone Cherry have a new album set to release on September 29th titled Screamin’ At The Sky. No doubt this is going to be another blockbuster rock album, given that this outfit has a certain knack for cranking out one great album after the other, complete with catchy big hooks, outstanding vocals and songs. The band is Chris Robertson (lead singer/guitar), Ben Wells (guitar/backing vocals) and drummer John-Fred Young (drums/backing vocals), are joined for the first time on an album recording by ‘new’ bassist, Steve Jewell Jr. (ex-Otis)\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nRed Light King\n\nCanadian-American rockers Redlight King reveal the fifth new music video single, “Eye Of A Hurricane,” from their fourth album In Our Blood released March 3 via AFM Records. The album was written and produced by frontman Mark “Kaz” Kasprzyk. What separates In Our Blood from so much of mainstream rock today is its sense of optimism. Challenging, introspective and complex themes run throughout all 11 tracks as a defiant undercurrent of hope. Great songs.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nRival Sons\n\nTwo-time Grammy nominated rockers Rival Sons just released their new album Darkfighter on June 2nd . The new set reaffirms the band’s status as song-focused rock and roll. And they rock. Produced by Dave Cobb, Darkfighter ranges from all-out blasters to mid-tempo, soulful cuts and more nuanced acoustic moments, held together by top-tier songwriting. The rock outfit is Jay Buchanan (vocals, harmonica, rhythm guitar), Scott Holiday (lead guitar), Mike Miley (drums), and Dave Beste (bass).\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nThe Damn Truth\n\nPsychedelic four-piece rock and roll band, The Damn Truth hail from Montreal and released their third album Now or Nowhere, produced by Grammy winner Bob Rock (Motley Crue, Aerosmith, Metallica). The band is Lee-la Baum (lead vocals/guitar), Tom Shemer (lead guitar/vocals), PY Letellier (bass/vocals), and Dave Traina (drums/vocals). Over the last nine years, they’ve been touring in the US, Canada, and Europe. They have opened for ZZ Top, the Sheepdogs, Styx, and Rival Sons. Lee-la’s vocals must be heard.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nElectric Mob\n\nBrazilian rock four-piece Electric Mob is edgy and ripping. With the influence of contemporary hard rock giants while also paying respect to the 70s and 80s rock giants, Electric Mob consists of young, very talented musicians with rock & roll swagger. Heavy sounds with distinct grooves, the band includes Renan Zonta (vocals), Ben Hur Auwarter (guitar), Yuri Elero (bass), and André Leister (drums). Their second album Discharge was released in 2020 on Frontiers Music S.R.L.\n\nVideo\n\nElectric Mob website\n\nThe Cold Stares\n\nOriginally from Western Kentucky, the band is composed of guitarist Chris Tapp, drummer Brian Mullins and bassist Bryce Klueh. They are authentic, hard rock, blues/rock, and rock & roll with powerful vocals and outstanding songs. With hints of SRV, Black Sabbath, The Black Crowes, Free and Led Zeppelin, this band is known for their songwriting and heavy grooves. The Cold Stares have gone from a bare-bones two-man sound to a more fleshed-out approach that channels a vintage power trio vibe with the addition of their bass player. They have toured nationwide alongside Rival Sons, Spoon, Joe Bonamassa, Big Head Todd and the Monsters. Their newest album is Voices.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nSkindred\n\nA Welsch rock band formed in 1998, Skindred’s sound is contemporary with plenty of swagger. Throw some reggae in, and you’ve got a band with a unique spin on rock. It’s heavy rock with a twist. Their new album ‘Smile’ comes out August 4th on Earache Records. Skindred is Benji Webbe (lead vocals), Daniel Pugsley (bass, backing vocals), Mikey Demus (guitars, backing vocals), Arya Goggin (drums). Tight band.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nThundermother\n\nAll-female heavy rock band Thundermother released their new album Black and Gold in August of 2022. Hailing from Sweden, the band’s 12 new adrenaline-fueled songs take fans on a high-voltage power ride into the band’s catchy rock & roll sound. With four studio albums and countless acclaimed live shows under their belt, they’ve joined The Scorpions on tour and more. Even with lineup changes, Thundermother doesn’t let that slow them down. Thundermother is guitarist Filippa Nässil, singer Linnéa Vikström, bassist Majsan Lindberg and drummer Joan Massing. The rock music festival queens are hitting Scandinavia and European festivals as well headlining shows.\n\nInfo and Video Here\n\nI welcome your comments below."
