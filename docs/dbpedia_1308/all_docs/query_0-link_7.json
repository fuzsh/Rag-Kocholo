        "text": "2001 compilation album by Sub Pop Records\n\nGive The People What We Want: Songs of The Kinks is a 2001 tribute album to music of The Kinks by various garage, punk and indie artists from the Northwestern United States.\n\nAs described by one reviewer, the compilation is a \"truly weird amalgamation that eviscerates the competition by providing you with what you never even thought about wanting. For instance: a quiet, heartfelt rendition of 'Waterloo Sunset', as performed by the Fastbacks. It's the most charmlessly charming, utterly superfluous album I've heard in a while; where most tribute albums suffer from a hyper-obsession while remaining true to the original artist, this compilation makes a strong case for the offbeat.\"[1]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Revenge\" - C Average 2:55\n\n\"Gotta Get the First Plane Home\" - Young Fresh Fellows 2:03\n\n\"Nothin' in the World Can Stop Me from Worryin' About That Girl\" - Mark Lanegan 4:12\n\n\"Who Will Be the Next in Line\"[2] - Mudhoney 2:10\n\n\"Ring the Bells\" - Model Rockets 2:25\n\n\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\" - Fall Outs 2:20\n\n\"The Way Love Used to Be\" - Heather Duby 2:40\n\n\"Sunny Afternoon\" - Baby Gramps 5:00\n\n\"Alcohol\" - Murder City Devils 3:25\n\n\"Session Man\" - Congratulators 3:06\n\n\"Tin Soldier Man\" - Love As Laughter 3:46\n\n\"Waterloo Sunset\" - Fastbacks 3:23\n\n\"Fancy\" - Jon Auer 3:04\n\n\"Brainwashed\" - Pinkos 2:18\n\n\"Act Nice and Gentle\" - Larry Barrett 2:55\n\n\"Wicked Annabella\" - The Minus 5 2:25\n\n\"Strangers\" - Makers 3:49\n\n\"Come Dancing\" - Briefs 2:25\n\n\"I Go to Sleep\" - Nikol Kollars 3:53"
