        "text": "Tekena suggested I write something about this and I thought good idea. What does it take to be a person with good taste in music, fashion, or movies? I guess it’s time to look within and look outside and explore this. So here’s a (relatively) short read on what I think is good taste.\n\n“You have good taste in music/fashion/whatever”\n\nIt’s a great compliment to hear. It means a lot to me when someone says I have good taste in something. But what is the underlying meaning? When I say someone has good taste what do I mean? I think when giving a compliment, you gotta mean it and be specific about it. It feels even better when someone follows up “you look good” with reasons why I look good.\n\nWhat it takes to have good taste:\n\n1. An Open Mind\n\nI think it all begins with an open mind. I love classic rock. Lots of people do. Some people though think that classic rock is the only music that exists and ignore and decry anything else as inferior.\n\nI generally would say my top genres are: literally any subgenre of rock from the 60s and 70s, R&B, soul, ska, disco, and reggae. I’m open to blues music or jazz, but it’s not my favourite. Generally, I wouldn’t say I’m a fan of country music, classical music, electronic music, or hip hop. Now this is generally speaking. There are exceptions. I’ve heard country songs that spark joy in me. I like progressive rock’s modernised take on classical – gimme ELO, Rick Wakeman, ELP, or Jon Lord. Early hip hop that incorporates a little disco is pretty good, I like a funky bassline.\n\n2. The Ability to Adapt\n\nTekena said that being able to pick songs from various genres that have appeal to those outside the subculture/fandom is a sign of good taste. And I think a good ear.\n\nThink of the tastemakers of radio back in the day. Sure, record labels released songs as singles, but the consumers and tastemakers ultimately decide what’s hot and what’s not. DJs had some degree of freedom and a lot of them decided what was going on the air. They had an ear for what would have wide appeal and what would be a hit. Listeners would call in and say they want to hear that song again or ask what’s that song called.\n\nSomeone who really knows their music can name a song from their preferred genre that would have crossover appeal. This leads me to my next point…\n\n3. Knowledge and Passion\n\nThese things can be applied to anything: fashion, decor, movies, books, you name it. You know what you’re talking about and can well articulate why you like something. When you explain what you like well, you sound like more of an authority. Being knowledgeable means you can make connections between things and be able to suggest music that someone might also like.\n\nKnowledge alone isn’t enough. A love of music/art/whatever is important to having good taste. If you don’t love something and have fun with it, what’s the point? Passion makes you stand out in a crowd of fans. The most memorable fans are the ones who are enthusiastic and supportive.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nA person with good taste in “X” isn’t necessarily someone who agrees with you the most on things. It’s about having an open mind, willing to explore new horizons. Adapting to other people’s tastes and not losing touch with that is important too. I appreciate learning about different types of music and I love to hear suggestions that are tailored to what I already like. With that, you need knowledge and passion about the subject. Know what you’re talking about and show enthusiasm.\n\nOn my blog, I strive to be a sources that is accessible and easy to read, but packed full of facts. I want to encourage music fans out of their musical comfort zones and get them to try new things. I love getting music suggestions from readers and I love reading fellow music bloggers’ work and that’s how I learn about new things. I never want to stop learning and sharing. This blog is a demonstration of my growth in music taste.\n\nWe can all have good taste in music.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nAngie"
