From Frank D. Gilroy - a prolific and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright (THE SUBJECT WAS ROSES), screenwriter (DESPERATE CHARACTERS), novelist (FROM NOON TILL THREE) and most recently, author of three best-selling Kindle Singles (LAKE, PRIVATE and CROONING) - comes this stunning portrait of Phyllis, mid-life crisis, who abandons herself to an unpredictable future (moving, sensual, painful, comic) that contradicts everything she previously thought about herself. With Vonnegut-like verve and consummate grace, Gilroy delivers a piercing new work of deep compassion and insight.Cover design by Evan Twohy.
