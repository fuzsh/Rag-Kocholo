        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept 14 — Frank D. Gilroy, whose 1964 Broadway debut, “The Subject Was Roses,” won the theatre’s triple crown — a Pulitzer Prize, a Tony and a Drama Critics’ Circle Award — but proved to be the high note in his life as a playwright and television and Hollywood dramatist, died on Saturday at his home in Monroe, New York. He was 89.\n\nHis death was announced by his son Tony.\n\n“Roses,” the tale of a World War II veteran returning home to the Bronx and the parents who vie for his love in an emotional caldron, was likened by some critics to masterworks by Eugene O’Neill and Arthur Miller. It ran for two years, was adapted by Gilroy for a 1968 movie, and has been revived in New York and around the country many times.\n\nBut for Gilroy, who wrote more than 30 other plays, “Roses” was his only major theatrical success. And while he wrote the screenplays for 10 feature films (some of which he also produced or directed); three novels; and scores of adventures, westerns and dramas in the golden age of television, none had the impact of his first and only Broadway hit.\n\nIndeed, one would be hard-pressed to find a review, magazine profile or news article over nearly a half-century that did not identify him as the author of “Roses.”\n\nWhen the play was revived off Broadway in 1991, with John Mahoney, Dana Ivey and Patrick Dempsey, Gilroy bemoaned his inextinguishable escutcheon.\n\n“I’d like to walk into a room sometime and be introduced as the author of something other than that play,” he told The New York Times shortly before the revival opened. “There’s always one thing in a career that has more impact than anything else. In my case, ‘The Subject Was Roses’ was that thing.”\n\nTo Gilroy, playwriting was storytelling, and his spare style, dialogue and simple architecture — two or three characters in a room, the events often compressed into an afternoon or evening in one or two acts — reflected the craftsmanship of his early work in television. “What saves them from being mere inflated TV dramas is a substratum of complex overtones and compassions,” Jerry Tallmer wrote in The New York Post.\n\nIn the 1950s, Gilroy wrote for “Playhouse 90,” “The United States Steel Hour,” “Kraft Television Theater,” “Omnibus,” “Westinghouse Studio One” and “Lux Video Theater.” His versatility took him to Hollywood, where he wrote for television westerns including “The Rifleman” and “Have Gun — Will Travel,” and movies, including “The Gallant Hours” (1960), about Adm. William F. Halsey Jr. He also created the homicide detective Amos Burke (played by Gene Barry) for the series “Burke’s Law.”\n\nGilroy made an auspicious Off Broadway debut in New York in 1962. “Who’ll Save the Plowboy?” — about a GI who rescues a comrade in war and 15 years later finds him mired in seediness — won an Obie (the award created by Tallmer, then with The Village Voice).\n\nWhen Gilroy’s loosely autobiographical “Roses” opened two years later, with Martin Sheen as the veteran and Jack Albertson and Irene Dailey as his parents, advance sales were modest but the reviews were excellent. Howard Taubman of The Times wrote, “With simplicity, humour and integrity, he has looked into the hearts of three decent people and discovered, by letting them discover, the feelings that divide and join them.”\n\nAudiences did not respond, and the play almost closed, but borrowed money kept it afloat for five weeks. Ticket sales soared as the awards piled up: the Outer Circle for outstanding new playwright, the Drama Critics’ Circle and the New York Theater Club for best play, the Tony, the Pulitzer Prize for drama.\n\nAfter his next three plays failed, Gilroy returned to Hollywood and adapted “Roses” for the screen. Albertson and Sheen reprised their stage roles, with Patricia Neal as the mother, in the movie, which was directed, as the play had been, by Ulu Grosbard. The reviews were mediocre.\n\nThe movie “Desperate Characters” (1971), which he adapted from a Paula Fox novel and produced and directed, won a Berlin Film Festival award, but many moviegoers found it so depressing that they walked out. Vincent Canby wrote the death knell in The Times: “I wish I liked it more.”\n\nFrank Daniel Gilroy was born in the Bronx on Oct. 13, 1925, the only child of Frank B. Gilroy, a coffee broker, and the former Bettina Vasti, who raised him in an apartment at Andrews Avenue and West 176th Street in Morris Heights. He was a lacklustre student, but liked fiction. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1943, was drafted into the wartime Army, served in Europe and was discharged in 1946.\n\nAt Dartmouth College, he wrote eight student productions and graduated with high honours in sociology in 1950. He attended Yale University’s drama school, but dropped out because he needed to work. He was a messenger in New York and rented out beach cabanas in Atlantic City, but continued to write, selling his first script, a sketch for Kate Smith, in 1952. He was soon writing for television.\n\nIn 1954 he married Ruth Gaydos. She survives him, as do their sons, Tony, Dan and John, and five grandchildren.\n\nWhile he lived in New York and Los Angeles for many years, Gilroy and his family settled permanently in Monroe, in the foothills of the Catskills, in 1962, and he wrote many of his plays and scripts in an office in nearby Goshen.\n\nHis stage works included “Present Tense: Four Plays” (1972), “Last Licks” (1979), “Reel to Real” (1987), five one-acts called “A Way With Words” (1991) and “Any Given Day” (1993). Among the films he wrote and directed besides “Desperate Characters” were “From Noon Till Three” (1976), a comedy western starring Charles Bronson, and “The Gig” (1985), a highly regarded independent movie about a group of amateur jazz musicians.\n\n“I remember how I would wait for a play idea,” Gilroy said in 1989 when his movie “The Luckiest Man in the World” was released. “I wasted a tremendous amount of time. I didn’t realise that ideas could be made into movies or novels.\n\n“I hope I live long enough to write about all the ideas that have come to me since.” — New York Times"
