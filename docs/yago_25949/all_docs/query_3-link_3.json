        "text": "There can be a fine line between turning to the literature of the past for insight into our own times and bending its messages into the ones that our ears are most eager to hear. After I learned that the writer Paula Fox had died last week, at the age of ninety-three, I took out my copy of “Desperate Characters,” her best-known novel, wary of the temptation to indulge in solipsistic interpretation. “Desperate Characters” is partly about gentrification in New York, an inescapable fact of life in the city as we live it now. But it was published in 1970, and so the late-sixties New York it describes—seedy and decrepit, its abandoned streets blowsy with garbage and drunks—is many moons from our own hale town bursting with chain-store, starchitect vigor. There was no need to worry. The novel—tense, quick, prickling with suppressed panic—is very much of its time and has a lot to say to ours, too. If you’ve never read it, or if, like me, it’s been a while since you did, now is an excellent moment to pick it up.\n\nThe action, such that it is, takes place as a series of episodes over a winter weekend in the lives of the Bentwoods, a childless married couple of forty who live in a handsomely refurbished town house in a Brooklyn neighborhood that’s still part slum. Otto is a lawyer whose partnership has just acrimoniously dissolved. Sophie used to do literary translations from the French, but lately she has drifted into indolence, sleeping in and scheduling lunch dates to give some shape to her days. What she does most regularly is cook, preparing the sorts of European-inflected meals that showcase her cultured sense of bourgeois good taste. As the novel opens, Otto contemplates the dinner his wife has set before them: “the straw basket which held slices of French bread, an earthenware casserole filled with sautéed chicken livers, peeled and sliced tomatoes on an oval willowware platter Sophie had found in a Brooklyn Heights antique shop, and risotto Milanese in a green ceramic bowl.”\n\nThose vessels, paid such telling attention, are as significant as the foods they hold. There is something ridiculous about their craftsy, simple elegance; the Bentwoods’ aspiration to unpretentiousness is itself pretentious. Fox lifts her eyes from the table to show us the rest of the room: the Tiffany lampshade, the stainless-steel sink, the refurbished cedar floorboards, the “highly polished” Victorian secretary desk. (Now it would be Danish mid-century modern.) All of it is documented as neutrally and thoroughly as a crime scene. Everywhere in “Desperate Characters,” obsessively burnished exteriors conceal the rotting state of what lies within. Inside the Bentwoods’ beautiful house is the Bentwoods’ troubled marriage. Theirs is hardly the only one. “She was like a time capsule into which men deposited messages that were to be read in the dust centuries hence,” Sophie thinks of a friend who brags too much about her lovers, most of them husbands to other women. It is a brutal metaphor, cruelly apt.\n\nAnd there is Sophie herself, who pats fancy cream (“$25 for four ounces”) on her face to gain some semblance of control over a body that seems intent on betraying her by breaking down. When she drinks beer, her stomach grows swollen and bloated as if in mockery: she has had two miscarriages. “I’ve got a uterus like a pinball machine, apparently,” she says, and it is that tossed-off “apparently,” with its effort at detachment, that breaks your heart. At the start of the novel, Sophie is bitten on the hand by a stray cat she is trying to feed, like a baby, with milk. The horror that she might have contracted rabies spreads through her like the disease itself, and yet she refuses to go to the hospital for the standard regimen of preventive shots. Accepting the cure would make the possibility of infection real. The shots would have to be administered to the belly, piercing her in that psychically tender place.\n\nIn many ways, Sophie is a woman of her time, a child of the Depression and of the Second World War. Born a decade too early to take full advantage of feminism’s imminent second wave, she is too privileged to have to work for money, too smart to be idle and stay sane. She is drawn to the vitality of the younger boomer generation, which is bound to hers by what Fox depicts as a posture of mutual contempt. (It is funny and oddly familiar to see the boomers, in their hippie phase, derided by their parents’ generation as self-involved and unserious, as boomers sometimes deride millennials now.) At a party in a Brooklyn Heights town house far more opulent than hers, Sophie tries to converse with a couple in their twenties, friends of the hosts’ deadbeat son. They ignore her. It is as if they speak a different language, or maybe Sophie has become invisible to them. The girl is wearing a heavy anklet, and Sophie compliments her on it. “Every time I move, it hurts,” she replies. Chic shackles are still shackles, after all.\n\nThough “Desperate Characters” is a work of realism, a fierce symbolic current courses through it. Sophie sees the ominous things that happen to her, like the cat bite, as “portents that lit up the dark at the edge of her own existence,” and she’s not wrong. As I read the novel again, I thought of “Rosemary’s Baby,” a contemporaneous tale of a New York woman with a blighted womb trapped in a bad marriage and a piece of prime real estate. (The one sex scene in “Desperate Characters” is aggressive and unsettling, a vampiric deed done in the dead of night.) At the book’s emotional climax, Sophie, alone in her bedroom, has a revelation: “God, if I am rabid, I am equal to what is outside.” Rather than horror, she experiences “an extraordinary relief.” The “outside” is what the Bentwoods have spent so much time and money fending off—the poverty and resentment that lies just beyond their well-painted front door, which they sense could combust into violence against them at any moment. Stoking that fear is an emotionally and morally exhausting labor. Sophie is glad to be done with it, at least for a moment. Anyway, the encroachment of the outside is Otto’s obsession, not hers. He speaks of the threat of the “locals” with the furious irony of a British colonial administrator who imagines rebellion fomenting at every turn. In this early exchange between the couple, Sophie is the first speaker:\n\n“What happens to the people in them when the houses are bought? Where do they go? I always wonder about that.”\n\n“I don’t know. Too many people everywhere.”\n\n“Who bought the houses?”\n\n“A brave pioneer from Wall Street. And the other, I think, a painter who got evicted from his loft on Lower Broadway.”\n\n“It doesn’t take courage. It takes cash.”\n\nWhat Otto loves is order, a sense of things being put in their right, and rightful, places. In this, he is typical of his class of new Brooklynites, planting their flags in their freshly acquired territory:\n\nWith one or two exceptions, each of the houses on the Bentwoods’ block was occupied by one family. All of the houses had been built during the final third of the last century, and were of brick or brownstone. Where the brick had been cleaned, a chalky pink glow gave off an air of antique serenity. Most front parlor windows were covered with white shutters. Where owners had not yet been able to afford them, pieces of fabric concealed the life within behind the new panes of glass. These bits of cloth, even though they were temporary measures, had a certain style, a kind of forethought about taste, and were not at all like the rags that hung over the windows of the slum people. What the owners of the street lusted after was recognition of superior comprehension of what counted in this world, and their strategy for getting it combined restraint and indirection.\n\nOne boardinghouse remained in business, but the nine tenants were very quiet, almost furtive, like the last remaining members of a foreign enclave who, daily, expect deportation.\n\nThat short, blunt paragraph arrives after the long one like a punch. Like the predestined elect in Calvin’s Geneva, Brooklyn’s rich think of their improved homes as an outward sign of inward virtue. They don’t bother to notice the resigned dread of the poor they are busy displacing; but Fox does, and she makes us see it, too.\n\nSophie’s question of what happens to the people whose houses are bought by people like her is fundamental to life and real estate in New York City. Compare the passage above to one from “The Nest,” last year’s blockbuster novel by Cynthia d’Aprix Sweeney, about four adult siblings in New York who must split an inherited fortune. Here is the backstory of a character called Stephanie—or, rather, of her house:\n\nStephanie’d had the foresight to buy at the end of Giuliani’s reign as mayor, only weeks after 9/11 during what would turn out to be the tiniest of real-estate dips. When she moved to the block on the wrong side of Flatbush Avenue, the non-Park Slope side, everyone—including Leo—thought she was crazy. One of the houses on that corner was occupied by a thriving drug business. Her house had ugly metal gates on the front and back windows. The door of the kitchen, leading to an unused and rotting deck, had been cemented shut with concrete blocks. But the day she looked at the building, she noticed city workers planting cherry trees along her side of the street, which she knew signaled an active neighborhood association. There was a decent garden floor rental beneath the owner’s triplex. And then there was the sheer size of the place—she could fit three of her Upper West Side studios into the first floor. As she wandered the neighborhood that day, she counted three couples with strollers. Her agency was thriving, and she’d always lived frugally, saving as much as she could. She offered the asking price.\n\nThis is a tale of perseverance and triumph. Stephanie worked hard; Stephanie saved; Stephanie made a canny bid at the right time. “The Nest” is an entertaining novel, full of observations about envy and competition among New York’s wealthy classes. What is missing, in this passage, is a sense of all other people, the ones who used to live on Stephanie’s street and had to put up the “ugly” gates for protection. Even the corner house is said to be occupied by a drug business; but, of course, a house is not occupied by a business. It is occupied by the people who run it. Who was there before? Where did they all go? Stephanie doesn’t think to ask, and neither does Sweeney.\n\nIn a beautifully ambiguous moment at the end of “Desperate Characters,” Fox disentangles herself from the consciousness of the Bentwoods—they are in bed, asleep—and drifts to their window, where she observes their neighbors in the building across the way. These are the “slum people” for whom Otto has such contempt. A man stumbles to his window and pees outside into the yard. In another apartment, an infant wakes and begins to cry. Its father stands looking down into the crib, naked below the waist, cradling his penis in his hands. He doesn’t pick the baby up; there is a chilling sense that something terrible is about to happen. (Fox herself had an atrocious childhood, and it haunts all her work.) But nothing does. The baby wets itself, relaxes, and suddenly, for the first and only time in the book, we find ourselves transported to the mind of another character: “ ‘All that for a shit!’ the father muttered to himself in Spanish. ‘What a scandalous life it is . . .’ ”\n\nMaybe Fox is telling us that each person is desperate in his own way. But there seems to be another message, too, if a harder one to make out. In the morning, siting alone at the dining-room table, Sophie looks out the window and sees the same man, watching her. He is still without pants, holding his crotch; he begins to open his hands, as if to expose himself. “She turned away quickly, thinking, that is his prize. Then, sneaking another look back, saw that he was holding an infant in his arms, kissing its neck with an intensity she could almost feel on her own.” That surprising moment of love in the midst of so much tension, the unexpected warmth of lips on neck, doesn’t thaw the rest of the novel’s bitter chill. But it still feels good, like sunlight."
