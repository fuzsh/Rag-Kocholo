        "text": "Frank D. Gilroy, whose 1964 Broadway debut, “The Subject Was Roses,” won the theater’s triple crown — a Pulitzer Prize, a Tony and a Drama Critics’ Circle Award — but proved to be the high note in his life as a playwright and television and Hollywood dramatist, died on Saturday at his home in Monroe, N.Y. He was 89.\n\nHis death was announced by his son Tony.\n\n“Roses,” the tale of a World War II veteran returning home to the Bronx and the parents who vie for his love in an emotional caldron, was likened by some critics to masterworks by Eugene O’Neill and Arthur Miller. It ran for two years, was adapted by Mr. Gilroy for a 1968 movie, and has been revived in New York and around the country many times.\n\nBut for Mr. Gilroy, who wrote more than 30 other plays, “Roses” was his only major theatrical success. And while he wrote the screenplays for 10 feature films (some of which he also produced or directed); three novels; and scores of adventures, westerns and dramas in the golden age of television, none had the impact of his first and only Broadway hit.\n\nIndeed, one would be hard-pressed to find a review, magazine profile or news article over nearly a half-century that did not identify him as the author of “Roses.”\n\nWhen the play was revived off Broadway in 1991, with John Mahoney, Dana Ivey and Patrick Dempsey, Mr. Gilroy bemoaned his inextinguishable escutcheon.\n\n“I’d like to walk into a room sometime and be introduced as the author of something other than that play,” he told The New York Times shortly before the revival opened. “There’s always one thing in a career that has more impact than anything else. In my case, ‘The Subject Was Roses’ was that thing.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
