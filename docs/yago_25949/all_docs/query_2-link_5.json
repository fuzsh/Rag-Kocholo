        "text": "August 10, 2023\n\nis there a better feeling on earth than finding a book you've wanted to read for years for $3 in a used bookstore, and then it living up to your expectations?\n\nthis was very sharp and very concise and very clever and very, very good.\n\ni tried to be \"normal\" and spend my pool- and beach-filled vacation reading watery, beachy things, but it didn't work and i came back to this and i had a much better time doing it.\n\nthank you to < href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... bestselling thriller i read 6 years ago for the recommendation.\n\nbottom line: living the dream!\n\n-------------------\n\ntbr review\n\ngoing to read this as part of my lifelong quest to be a manic pixie dream girl on a level worthy of stalking\n\nMay 25, 2019\n\nA woman gets bitten by a stray cat. She spends the weekend in fear, avoiding the possibility that she could have rabies. Meanwhile her husband, a conservative lawyer, is facing the dissolution of his practice with his long time, liberal partner.\n\nYou could get to the end of this short 1970 novel, penned by none other than Courtney Love's grandmother (weird! random!), and think \"well, darn, what just happened here?\" And you wouldn't be alone. Or, you could sigh, like I did, and think \"I don't know what just happened here, but, by jove, it was brilliant!\"\n\nIn few pages, this elegant little book aptly highlights the cracks in politics, in marriage, and in self. A feeling of delight blossomed in my heart so many times as I luxuriated over perfect sentences, over the tension and paranoia evoked by the maybe-rabies, and the feeling that I was reading someone who in her lifetime was certainly the smartest person in any room at any time (and who deserves more readership). Thank goodness this book, which was out of print for some years, has had a revival.\n\nI also felt that this would be best read in a postmodern literature class in Harvard or the like, because it could be studied repeatedly and still you'd know there was more to learn in a subsequent reading.\n\nBut, even without the ivy-league lectures, I still heard the beating heart of this book. It's the damn desperation of it all. Written almost a half century ago, the novel has aged beautifully. I felt the despair, that desperation, of people who are suffocated by what feeds them. They are horrified to see their fragile world crumbling around them, feeling powerless but at the same time a nihilistic ambivalence to change anything.\n\nThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. - Henry David Thoreau\n\nJuly 3, 2022\n\nShort, dense, unsettling, sharp and incredibly relevant to this day and age although it was written fifty years ago. It could be a Harold Pinter play or a Michelangelo Antonioni film. It is one of the best books I’ve read lately.\n\nLa Notte, 1961 Jeanne Moreau, Marcello Mastroianni\n\nThis is the story of a weekend in the life of the Bentwoods, a middle aged pair of well-to-do New Yorkers living in an ascending Brooklyn neighborhood at the end of the 60s. It’s a suspenseful tale of personal and social turbulence, loaded with images of order and chaos, attachment and estrangement. These partners dance around each other for 155 pages, an intimate choreography the steps of which, one senses, have been repeated multiple times in their longstanding relationship.\n\nOtto Bentwood, once an actively liberal lawyer, finds himself spiritually confused in a fast-changing society. Sophie Bentwood is soporific enough to go on clinging to their world of privilege even as it suffocates her. They are both so well-equipped to read themselves and their environment that there’s a kind of horror in such an overload of meaning. Yet, they are in that phase of life where their capacity and readiness for change is rapidly diminishing. (I felt for them.)\n\nAnd so, they remain in perpetual inertia although they frantically move around in a setting that seems to be closing in on them. The cracks in the carapace of their ‘civilized’ existence are affecting them and they can’t pretend otherwise.\n\nOminous signs are everywhere: a stone is thrown into their living room, a drunk is sleeping in his own vomit across the street (and this is supposed to be a good neighborhood.) An anonymous caller breathes into the phone late at night, a stranger barges into their house frenziedly asking money for train fare. Their Victorian country house is being vandalized and they are aware of class-hatred even in the rural kitchen of their ex-farmer-turned-to-caretaker of the summer houses of “city folks.” The novel opens with Sophie getting bitten by a stray cat she had fed minutes ago; for the following three days she’s dreading what the bite will bring her: rabies, shots in the belly, death or nothing at all.\n\n\"God, if I am rabid, I am equal to what is outside,\" she said out loud, and felt an extraordinary relief as though, at last, she’d discovered what it was that could create a balance between the quiet, rather vacant progression of the days she spent in this house, and those portents that lit up the dark at the edge of her own existence. She cleaned up the kitchen, saying to herself over and over, I have to think. Think, she commanded her reflection in the bathroom mirror. Then she covered her face with a cream that had cost $25 for four ounces.\n\nThis reminder of mortality, paired with the couple’s emotional desolation, makes them the “Desperate Characters” of the title. Still, as Jonathan Franzen says in his brilliant introduction, this is “…the rare novel that does justice to both sides of marriage, both hate and love, both her and him.” Vivian Gornick, another writer I respect and the one that put this on my radar in the first place, sees this work solely through a feminine lens. I can certainly relate to that but I prefer Franzen’s more universal approach.\n\n\"I wish someone would tell me how I can live,\" he said, and shot her a glance. The half-question affected her unpleasantly, and she turned her head away instantly so he could not see her face. She felt the injustice of her own response – what if his words were puerile? The plea behind them was not. But she couldn’t tell anyone how to live!\n\nThe questions the novel raises are radical and unpleasant. Easy answers are not given. Franzen adds: “As bad as it is to be desperate, it’s even worse to be desperate and also be aware of the vital questions of public law and order and privilege that are entailed in your private desperation, and to feel as if by breaking down you’re proving a whole nation of Charlie Russels right.” Charlie Russel being the close friend and ex business partner now accusing Otto of complacency: “… Charlie brayed that no oppression had ever been so difficult to resist as middle-class oppression, because it wears a thousand faces, even the face of revolution, and that it is an insatiable gut that can even nourish itself on the poison its enemies leave lying about to destroy it. I asked him what alternative he had in mind and he buzzed his secretary and told her to send in his appointment.”\n\nNothing much happens in the end but the beauty of the book lies in that what little happens stands up to all kinds of interpretation. The perspective kept changing according to my mood as I went through. Franzen claims that he had read it half a dozen times by the time he wrote the preface in 1991 (which, brilliant as it is, should better be read after one is finished with the story.) I believe I’ll do the same before I can safely say I’m done with it. For me, that is what defines great fiction and instantly puts this in my favorites.\n\nRoom in New York, 1932 by Edward Hopper\n\nΚαι στα ελληνικά: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5...\n\nApril 14, 2021\n\nFrom the very first sentence of this novel, you experience movement:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Otto Bentwood drew out their chairs simultaneously.\n\nDrew out their chairs, pushed them back in, poured the coffee, read the paper, opened the door, shut the door, hit the sidewalk walking, took the subway, got into the car, drove.\n\nOtto and Sophie Bentwood seem more like verbs than nouns in this fast-paced novel of a mere 190 pages.\n\nWe learn less about them and their marriage through character development or plot than we do from learning how they move around each other like tokens on a game board when another piece (a cat, a neighbor, a co-worker, a friend) enters the game.\n\nThis is a short novel with a quick pace, and it reminds me of three other novels: The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, and The Catcher in the Rye.\n\nYes, the setting of New York plays a role in three out of four of these novels, but it's more than that. These are all novels of great movement, where the characters are walking, riding, driving, talking, drinking, walking, riding, driving, talking, drinking, walking, riding, driving, talking, drinking. . . you get the picture.\n\nThe reason is. . . and it's kind of brilliant, actually. . . these people are nervous, they are anxious, they are pacing. They are postwar, all of them, and they are experiencing the degradation of the shine and allure of their former lives.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nWithin all of this buzz and motion, there are languid moments, and they contrast the physical activity beautifully, similar to the light and dark images so famous in Rembrandt's paintings.\n\nWhere there is movement, there is then silence, and, oh, how crushing the blow, to stop moving and think.\n\nTicking away inside the carapace of ordinary life and its sketchy agreements was anarchy.\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nDecía Santayana que “vivimos dramáticamente en un mundo que no es dramático”, una forma de subrayar nuestra insignificancia ante un mundo exterior al que no soportamos su indiferencia. Por eso es que tenemos que construirnos un mundo que, ineludiblemente, será a nuestra imagen y semejanza, en el que dotaremos a las cosas de un significado que objetivamente no tienen, en el que vislumbraremos intenciones en personas que posiblemente no alberguen, en el que los sitios a los que nos dirigimos o de los que huimos en realidad no tienen las propiedades que les atribuimos: el mundo, nuestro mundo, para bien o para mal, es tal como somos.\n\nY así como vivimos, impelidos a dotar a todo de significado, también leemos. Por eso es que un libro, sobre todo uno como este de Paula Fox, tan sugerente, tan abierto, tan críptico incluso, se adapta de una forma tan maravillosa a lo que cada uno busca, la verdadera magia de la literatura, como si el libro estuviera especialmente dirigido a cada uno de nosotros. Y es por eso que “Personajes desesperados”, inabarcable como todo gran libro, mueve a la relectura, pues siempre nos deja con la sensación de que lo principal, esa clave esencial destinada a nosotros, se nos ha escapado.\n\n“Las palabras solo servían para lo que podía decirse”\n\nTambién los personajes desesperados de esta novela se han creado un mundo a su imagen y semejanza, o al menos esto es lo que yo he querido leer: una pareja en su mediana edad, Otto y Sophie, cultos, inteligentes y sin problemas económicos viven en un barrio de Nueva York en pleno proceso de gentrificación; ambos atraviesan ese momento de crisis en el que se valora la tranquilidad en la que se vive tanto como se aborrece, en el que se desea mantener el orden tanto como acabar con él, en el que se echa la vista atrás buscando esos momentos cruciales en el que dejamos de vivir la vida que nos estaba destinada; están en esa edad en la que aparecen las primeras molestias corporales que siempre “conllevan la reducción, o el fin, de algún placer”, en el que empiezan a brotar esas grietas físicas “a la vez ordinarias y risibles”; ese punto en la vida en el que se teme constantemente la llegada de una mala noticia, ese momento en el que de pronto aparece la muerte en el horizonte.\n\n“¿Cómo hemos llegado aquí?”\n\nTal es su estado interior, que el exterior, la vida que ha ido surgiendo a su alrededor sin apenas darse cuenta, les rechaza, como si ya no les perteneciera ni ellos pertenecieran a ella. Surge en sus vidas un miedo inconcreto que acaba tiñéndolo todo: los objetos parecen encerrar amenazas, un porche es un nido de cuervos, unas estatuillas miran con malevolencia, los edificios amenazantes como enormes mamíferos carnívoros, entes inquietantes que van creando esa atmósfera de desasosiego tan propicia a la desesperación tranquila que, como la mayoría de los hombres (Thoreau), viven estos personajes. Una intranquilidad que se nos va contagiando con los elementos que Fox va dejando caer aquí y allá: cucarachas que corren por encimeras, cantidades de inmundicias anegando las calles, vecinos que se carcajean de la patada con la que vuelcan cubos de basura, una piedra arrojada contra una casa sin motivo aparente, otra invadida por unos gamberros que, sin llevarse nada, han destrozado todo lo que contiene, hombres que se quedan inmóviles y pensativos mirando el chorro de agua que sale de un grifo o la rejilla de una alcantarilla, malos olores, malos sabores y, como no, ese gato callejero que araña y muerde la mano de Sophie cuando esta se le acerca a darle de comer, punto de partida de la novela.\n\n“Con qué rapidez se hacía pedazos la cáscara de la vida adulta, su importancia, ante el embate de lo que, de repente, era real, imperioso, absurdo”\n\nP.S. La edición de la novela viene precedida de un prólogo de Jonathan Franzen: ni se les ocurra leerlo antes de terminar la novela.\n\nSeptember 11, 2016\n\nIf it were possible to give a book six stars, this would be the book.\n\nEach time I reread Fox's masterpiece, which is receiving increasing yet still insufficient attention, I am struck by its remarkable balance of depth and breadth. If there are a handful of works of literature that are deserving of their own college course -- maybe Anna Karenina or Invisible Man or Ulysses -- then one could structure an entire college education around this compact and easily-accessible novel. On the surface, we are introduced to Sophie and Otto Bentwood of Brooklyn Heights, a forty-something couple in a desiccated marriage, on the day Sophie receives a potentially lethal cat bite. But the novel transcends this domestic pas-de-deux to grapple with complex, unsettling questions of social order and justice, race and religion, freedom and obligation. It is a book as relevant today -- maybe more so -- than at at the height of the social protest and disorder of the late 1960s, when it takes place. Not a book to be read for plot or diversion, but to be savored for its penetrating insights into marriage, friendship and civilization.\n\nI recognize that art reflects taste, but the sizable number of one-star reviews of this book leave me genuinely concerned for the future of literature.\n\nMay 16, 2016\n\noooh, i like this new cover. maybe i would have liked the book more if i'd read it with this cover.\n\nApril 14, 2021\n\nThe Year of Women--in which I'm devoting 2021 to reading female authors only--continues with my introduction to the fiction of Paula Fox. I intersected my reading project with Julie Grippo’s 1970s fiction jag by choosing Desperate Characters, published in 1970. This is an exquisitely well written novel fraught with enough anxiety to make me need to puke. It’s set in New York, a city I first became aware of at a very young age due to a new, publicly funded TV show called Sesame Street. The “I ❤ NY” tourism campaign was also in high gear nationwide at the time. But Fox’s vision of New York in the ‘70s isn’t one where humans and Muppets maintain a safe learning environment. It’s a cesspool where ideals go to die, or people too if they’re bitten by a stray cat. I felt fortunate to escape it.\n\nThe story involves Sophie and Otto Bentwood, a forty-year-old childless couple existing in a refurbished Victorian era townhouse in Brooklyn Heights. Sophie is a French translator who hasn’t taken an assignment in a while. She sleeps late, meets other women for lunch and to remind herself of how cultivated she is, cooks. Otto is a defense attorney whose longtime friend Charlie Russell has dissolved their partnership due to irreconcilable differences, being much more impulsive than the compulsively orderly Otto. Smart with money—owning a Mercedes-Benz sedan and a summer farmhouse on Long Island—Otto spends his nonbillable hours fussing to Sophie about the city, society or what frauds their friends are. More upsetting than the fact that Otto won’t stop talking is that Otto is right.\n\nSurrounded by New Yorkers who pass out drunk on the sidewalk or urinate out of a window, the Bentwoods are visited by a stray cat. Giving the animal a saucer of milk and stroking its back, she’s bitten on the hand. Sophie shares news of the attack with Otto and her friends but is reluctant to follow their advice to seek medical treatment. She passes the incident off as nothing, despite feeling a deep sense of betrayal or of being profoundly wounded. Her lover—a married man, publisher of sorts and client of Otto’s named Francis—who might empathize with Sophie's despair isn’t around. The husband who is around seems to care about everything but Sophie.\n\nThat they should be sitting across from each other in the same way they had sat for so many years and that the habitual intimacy between them could have suffered so wrenching a violation without there being evidence of it, was harrowing to Sophie. If, all these months, she had so ardently lived a life apart from Otto without his sensing something, it meant that their marriage had run down long before she had met Francis; either that, or worse—once she had stepped outside the rules, definitions, there were none. Constructions had no true life. Ticking away inside the carapace of ordinary life and its sketchy agreements was anarchy.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Desperate Characters is how dizzying the language is. This book is like grabbing onto a helium balloon lifting as it floats away. I was momentarily elated to be defying gravity followed by a very anxious sense of foreboding. It’s clear that this little trip, and it’s a short novel, won’t end well. Financial security for the Bentwoods has built a very nice zoo exhibit in which the couple are inside staring out at the animals. Otto sees the world as going down the tubes. Sophie feels her life going down the tubes. Her wound gets concerning enough that she finally visits the emergency room, which is aptly named.\n\nIt was like a bus station, an abandoned lot, the aisles in the coaches of the old B. & O. trains, subway platforms, police stations. It combined a transient quality, the disheveled atmosphere of a public terminal with the immediately apprehended terror of a way station to disaster.\n\nIt was a dead hole, smelling of synthetic leather and disinfectant, both of which odors seemed to emanate from the torn scratched material of the seats that lined three walls. It smelled of the tobacco ashes which had flooded the two standing metal ashtrays. On the chromium lip of one, a cigar butt gleamed wetly like a chewed piece of beef. There was the smell of peanut shells and of the waxy candy wrappers that littered the floor, the smell of old newspapers, dry, inky, smothering and faintly like a urinal, the smell of sweat from armpits and groins and backs and faces, pouring out and drying up in the lifeless air, the smell of clothes—cleaning fluids imbedded in fabric and blooming horridly in the warm sweetish air, picking at the nostrils like thorns—all the exudations of human flesh, a bouquet of animal being, flowing out, drying up, but leaving a peculiar and ineradicable odor of despair in the room as though chemistry was transformed into spirit, an ascension of a kind.\n\nFox conjures up a nightmare that I was relieved to wake up from. Language and ambiance are her strengths. Narrative is somewhere further down the list. It also ended too abruptly for me, which says more about the book than it does the ending. However, Fox’s vision will stay with me. Desperate Characters was adapted as a film of the same name in 1971 with Shirley Maclaine playing Sophie Bentwood. Maclaine’s performance was lauded by critics, but the movie disappeared, one of many released in the early ‘70s whose idiosyncrasies failed to resonate with a wide audience.\n\nPaula Fox was born in 1923 in New York City. While her parents settled in Los Angeles to write screenplays, she was passed from her grandmother to relatives to others, growing up in Cuba, Florida and New York. In 1944, Fox was living with acting coach Stella Adler, unmarried and broke, when she gave birth to a daughter she gave up for adoption. Taken by a wealthy couple, Fox’s biological daughter—Linda Carroll—would also become a single teenage mother, settling in the Pacific Northwest and giving birth in the mid-1960s to Courtney Harrison, who became the rock star Courtney Love.\n\nThis family tree makes Fox the biological great-grandmother of Frances Bean Cobain, Love’s daughter with the late rock legend Kurt Cobain. Fox would attend Columbia University, marry and have two sons. Working for many years as a teacher and tutor for troubled children, Fox published the first of six novels in her 40s, none of which sold well and would be out of print by 1992. She would be championed by author Jonathan Franzen, who helped get her books reprinted. Fox died in Brooklyn in 2017.\n\nPrevious reviews in the Year of Women:\n\n-- Come Closer, Sara Gran\n\n-- Veronica, Mary Gaitskill\n\n-- Clothes, Clothes, Clothes, Music, Music, Music, Boys, Boys, Boys, Viv Albertine\n\n-- Pizza Girl, Jean Kyoung Frazier\n\n-- My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Ottessa Moshfegh\n\n-- Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, Fannie Flagg\n\n-- The Memoirs of Cleopatra, Margaret George\n\n-- Miss Pinkerton, Mary Roberts Rinehart\n\n-- Beast in View, Margaret Millar\n\n-- Lying In Wait, Liz Nugent\n\n-- And Then There Were None, Agatha Christie\n\nSeptember 18, 2015\n\nI thought this would mostly be a dissection of marriage, but it turned out to be more of a tense observation on class distinction in 1960s NYC, and about how dangerous it is to have too much time on your hands to devote to introspection.\n\nThe central plot of a cat bite and the ensuing paranoia was highly symbolic. In fact, this short book is crammed with hidden meanings and I loved that. The snotty couple show up to their vacation house to find that someone has literally shit in it. A homeless man vomits. A baby won’t stop crying. A rock is thrown into someone’s window. The well-off housewife takes a shot of whiskey because it’s “Monday morning” and oh, life is so very hard when you don’t have to work. We’re probably supposed to hate Otto and Sophie and their petty bourgeois issues, and it’s not hard to do with their misdirected anger and privileged disillusionment.\n\nFairly enjoyable overall.\n\nFebruary 6, 2017\n\nHow was I bamboozled in this WASPy angst reminiscent of John Cheever or somebody. I picked up this book after a recent article listed the best taut and rather obscure books that you can read in a single sitting. Well, yeh, you can read it in a single sitting so that part is true.\n\nI should've known to back away when it received the endorsement of Jonathan Franzen who called it the greatest realist novel of the postwar era. ughh!\n\nBook written in 1970 with the setting taking place somewhere around that time, maybe late 60's Brooklyn. A marriage in trouble with a lot of symbolism that starts with a cat bite and the possibility of rabies. Urban decay in a pre-gentrified Brooklyn/Brooklyn Heights. A strange, uncomfortable preoccupation and curiosity with scary Negroes permeates throughout the book.\n\nWhen I have to overtax myself in trying to figure out what you're trying to say with metaphors and symbolism up the wazoo it's just not worth it. I guess hipsters might love it but short book or not I was bored. Unfortunately I will never get those hours back. Oh well.\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\n3.5 Stars\n\nEveryone in this book is desperate, in one way or another. Sophie, who has just been bitten by a stray cat, is desperate to know if she has rabies. But she is also feeling desperate in her marriage and life. She is feeling discontent and disconnected.\n\nHer husband, Otto, has just “fractured” from his law partner, Charlie, who has also been a lifelong friend. He is feeling desperate as well as he is not sure he can do it on his own. He loves his wife and feels desperate for her in his own way.\n\nCharlie is also desperate- he wants to feel like he is doing the right thing for people. He wants his practice to reflect that.\n\nThe book started so strong, with such witty, sharp dialogue. I was rubbing my hands with glee. And then, I became one of the desperate ones. I was desperate to finish this book and leave these annoying people behind.\n\nThere is some beautiful writing in this book. A line I especially liked:\n\n“Now it was like the laboured conversation among guests at a late hour after there is nothing more to say, nothing but ashes in the fireplace, dishes in the sink, a chill in the room, a return to ordinary estrangement.”\n\nI think this could be a case of it’s me, not the book! Hey, Jonathan Franzen raves about it in the foreword. I have been on a roll of reading depressing, weighty books, albeit excellent. I think it’s time for a change and a lightening of mood.\n\nPublished: 1970\n\nJanuary 2, 2018\n\n“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” Henry David Thoreau\n\nSetting: Late 60s--Vietnam era: a time of social unrest, assassinations, civil rights movement, anti-Establishment upheaval that gave rise to the saying, \"Don't trust anyone over 30.\"\n\nScene: a renovated brownstone in Brooklyn, NY, on a street that is experiencing urban gentrification, but whose back overlooks a decaying slum.\n\nMain characters: Otto and Sophie Bentwood, a wealthy, highly-literate couple who have been married for 15 years, childless, both 40. Otto is a lawyer; Sophie translates books into French but has the wherewithal to pick and choose her work.\n\nThey live a life of staid order surrounded by their beautiful things. Then, in the course of one late-winter weekend, cracks begin to appear in their carefully constructed lives.\n\nOn a Friday evening during dinner, Sophie is bitten by a feral cat she has taken to feeding on the back stoop. She is shocked and frightened and tries to keep this attack from Otto but the wound is too painful. Wouldn't you immediately seek medical help? But no, the Bentwoods go to a social event they had planned on attending that evening where even the host, a psychiatrist, urges Sophia to go to the emergency room.\n\nThe dread builds, the specter of rabies raises its ugly head but Sophie keeps denying that anything is wrong.\n\nThen she learns that Otto's partnership with long-time friend and fellow lawyer, Charlie Russel, has ended. The two men have always been an odd couple, one strict and orderly, the other a charmer and would-be social activist, but they have found ways to co-exist until now. Otto is worried that Charlie is stealing clients out from under him by gossip and insinuations. From Charlie's point of view, the Bentwoods are \"drearily enslaved by introspection while the foundation of their privilege is being blasted out from under them.\"\n\nThis short, character-driven book, contains deep insights into marriage, friendship, justice, and social responsibility and even though it was published nearly fifty years ago, there is relevance to be found for our own times and social issues.\n\nThis is a book to be savored and reread to reveal the many layers of meaning. Perhaps I'll make a resolution to read it on January 1st for many years to come.\n\nJuly 7, 2022\n\nThis book was recommended to me by Elena Ferrante, via Frantumaglia: A Writer's Journey. If you’re familiar with Ferrante’s works, especially The Days of Abandonment, and then read this earlier novel, you’ll easily understand why Ferrante is drawn to it. In response to a fan comparing her to Paula Fox, Ferrante answers, “Desperate Characters is a book that I love for its narrative intensity, but it has a richness of meaning that I feel unfortunately far from achieving myself.”\n\nThough neither of the married couple at the center of the book have abandoned each other, there’s the sense of the fragility of a marriage, even one of fifteen years, and the unknowingness (though there are clues) of the inner life of any human being. The novel’s depiction of the encroachment of violence on a nice house in a poor New York City neighborhood may have reminded Ferrante of a certain Neapolitan neighborhood. (Funnily enough, last night I read of the same theme in Little Dorrit as pertaining to Tite Barnacle's “gentlemanly residence,\" which sits in a mews.) The couple is terrorized by a feral cat, and other forces seem to be preying on them as well: Nowhere is safe.\n\nIt’s a well written novel, at times blunt in its language, with the best prose coming near the end when the narratorial voice expands, as the couple sleeps, to a mouse trapped in the kitchen, then outward to the neighborhood, and then for the first time into the mind of the husband. In some ways, the novel seems dated; in other ways, it could be of today.\n\nMay 24, 2014\n\nI must be stupid but I just didn't get this book at all. The writing was good but the story was not. A woman is bit by a cat and is worried about getting rabies over the weekend. She has a life with issues just like all of us do but hers are just not that interesting. She is a little desperate but not as desperate as I was to turn the last page. The best part about this book was that it was short.\n\nNovember 26, 2021\n\nΗ Σόφι και ο Ότο είναι ένα παντρεμένο ζευγάρι που ζεί στο Μπρούκλιν στα τέλη της δεκαετίας του '60.\n\nΜια αδέσποτη γάτα όμως, δαγκώνει τη Σόφι και η πιθανότητα και μόνο να έχει λύσσα, την αποσυντονίζει.\n\nΟ Ότο από την άλλη μεριά, αποφασίζει να διαλύσει τη συνεργασία του με τον καλό του φίλο Τσάρλι μετά από πολλά χρόνια.\n\nΔύο άνθρωποι που ζουν κάποιες καταστάσεις χωρίς να φτάνουν στην ουσία των πραγμάτων.\n\nΜια σχέση με πολλές αδυναμίες και κάποιες φορές χωρίς ουσιαστική επικοινωνία.

Descriptions are so perfectly judged, incidents so astonishingly well balanced, episodes so impeccably resonant with one another, hints and allusions so delicately poised, psychological insights so bewilderingly sharp, that almost any novelist will seem dull-headed by comparison. I went from \"Desperate Characters\" to a novel by Cees Nooteboom, and I could hardly stomach it: Nooteboom, by comparison, seems hulkish and animalistically unreflective. His prose is blockish and his sense of timing and humor are like crude uncomprehending apings of real wit. It's not his fault: Fox has in dense excess what other novelists sweat to achieve. The number of felicitous, inimitable formulations on each page puts most anyone else to shame (her companions in this sense are perhaps Flaubert, or Joyce).\n\nBut on the other hand. The reason Jonathan Franzen could write about this book in such superlatives is that he is himself very much a product of the \"New Yorker\" style from the 1970s onward. He is right that the novel can be read and re-read (he says he's read it six times). He's right, too, that it's a kind of model of what novels might be. But one of the Amazon reviewers, Jay Dickson, is also correct that this novel is very much a product of the style exemplified -- or should I say molded? -- by the \"New Yorker.\" And what is wrong with that? Well, it breeds a kind of virtuosity in which a reader is continuously interrupted, and asked to stand back and admire what has just been deployed with such apparently unstudied effortlessness. A number of times reading \"Desperate Characters,\" I wanted to put the book down, stand up, and applaud. But those moments were more or less quickly followed by irritations. I pictured the author, not the narrator, expending a jeweler's attention on every turn of phrase, weighing and considering it until it was at once perfect and brittle. The same happens in Nabokov.\n\nVirtuosity at this level is a snake that bites its own tail, and a novel as perfected as \"Desperate Characters\" chews off little pieces of its own plausibility each time it indulges in another coruscating fireworks of outlandishly gorgeous, uncannily insightful, hyper-eloquent, impossibly well-judged description.\n\nJuly 24, 2016\n\n4.5 stars. This is a brilliant short novel that in less than 200 pages really gets in your head and under your skin. I think a second reading is probably required to fully appreciate all the subtext. Can't wait to discuss this one with my book group.\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\n3,5*\n\nΈνα ανθρώπινο καλοζωισμένο χέρι δαγκώνεται από μια γάτα και ένα μεγαλοαστικό εξοχικό βανδαλίζεται από άγνωστα χέρια.

Αν, όλους εκείνους τους μήνες, είχε ζήσει τόσο φλογερά μια ζωή χωριστή από τον Ότο, χωρίς εκείνος να διαισθανθεί κάτι, σήμαινε ότι ο γάμος τους είχε πάρει τον κατήφορο πολύ πριν γνωρίσει τον Φράνσις· ή αυτό ή, ακόμα χειρότερα – από τη στιγμή που είχε ξεπεράσει τους κανόνες, τους ορισμούς, δεν υπήρχε τίποτα.

[…]\n\nMarch 20, 2015\n\nSimply put, this is a good piece of writing.\n\nBravo to Jonathan Franzen for rediscovering Paula Fox\n\n\"A perfect short novel. A few characters, a small stretch of time; setting and action confined- and yet, as in Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich, everthing crucial within our souls bared.\" blurb on the back\n\nI enjoyed reading it.\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\nAl contrario de lo que decía en mi última reseña al respecto del título de la novela que entonces comentaba (Yo que nunca supe de los hombres), que bien le va el título a esta: Personajes desesperados. Cada uno manifiesta su desesperación de forma distinta, pero creo que tras la apariencia de la normalidad de una clase media acomodada y burguesa, se esconden unas mujeres y hombres absolutamente desquiciados y al borde del precipicio.\n\n“Vestida con un abrigo de tweed francés, calzada por un florentino, esperó en el andén, su verdadera vida tan enmascarada con las personas que pasaban sin prisas por su lado o se apoyaban en las columnas ennegrecidas que sustentaban el techo. Entonces, muy a su pesar, se le saltaron las lágrimas. Encontró un pañuelo en el bolso y se refugió detrás de una máquina expendedora de refrescos. Ahí, encontró dos mensajes, uno escrito con tiza, decía: “Que alguien me bese”; el otro grabado con una llave o navaja, decía: “Jodeos todos menos Linda”.\n\nEsa percepción de la tensión contenida que soportan todos la encontré casi desde la primera página; indicar también que el fantástico prólogo de J. Franzen lo leí tras terminar el libro, he tenido demasiadas malas experiencias con el exceso de información que a veces se facilita sin pensar para nada en el nuevo lector. Y por otro lado, siempre me gusta enfrentarme a una novela de forma inédita: tomo razón de que un libro pudiera ser bueno y ya no quiero saber más, quiero sacar mis conclusiones.\n\nDetrás de la apariencia de forma y fondo simple, se esconde toda una bomba oculta. Como digo la apariencia formal de la novela es sencilla, mucho diálogo, aparentemente sencillos o intrascendentes; por otro lado la apariencia de la historia es una cierta inquietud por una historia insignificante: el ataque de un animal doméstico y la lenta evolución de la protagonista.\n\nCuál es la bomba oculta y aquí cada cual que tome lo que quiera, o se de por aludido en la medida que quiera: mujer (hombre), edad madura, expectativas de pareja insatisfechas, cuestión laboral deficitaria, escepticismo de los ideales, relaciones sociales agotadas, expectativas vitales no satisfechas, futuro nublado…¿hay alguien por ahí a quien le pudiera sonar esa música?\n\nLa protagonista se está autodestruyendo poco a poco de forma evidente, sin parecer importar a nadie, ni tan siquiera a ella misma. Se acoge a algún momento dichoso de su vida, alguna aventura…pero parece poca cosa para el tremendo obstáculo que se presenta en el horizonte.\n\nManifiesta influencia de John Cheever, pero con menos alcohol: se asemeja en los grandes retratos que hace de la clase media norteamericana acomodada usando pocas palabras, las conversaciones, el diagnóstico, esa lucidez que aportan.\n\nImpresionante el prólogo de J. Franzen que yo según decía al inicio lógicamente leí al final. No estoy de acuerdo con él en varias cuestiones: no es mejor Paula Fox que P. Roth desde luego, ni mejor que Updike, y no tengo claro que sea mejor que Bellow (que no es de mis favoritos y no pienso dar la cara por el).\n\nNo estamos en las mismas condiciones en cuanto a opinión y diagnóstico de la novela, debo reconocerlo, ya que Franzen reconoce haber leído 7 veces el libro, ha impartido cursos sobre él, etc y aunque a mí me ha gustado e inquietado más por lo que sugiere que por lo que afirma, no creo que vuelva a releerlo. Por otro lado se sugiere que al inicio aparenta ser una novela de suspense al estilo P. Highsmith, y debo decir que a mi en ningún momento me causó esa impresión, ni mucho menos.\n\nMay 20, 2014\n\nI feel a a little stupid not liking this book. However if you needed an example of intellectual navel gazing this book would be a perfect example\n\nJuly 28, 2013\n\nOkay. Here is my unsophisticated reaction to this sophisticated novel.\n\nFirst off, I most assuredly appreciated the writing. The sentences were a work of art, beautifully constructed with just the right amount of detail.\n\nI recognize that this novel was meant to be Symbolic and to offer lots of Great Themes. And that I probably missed a lot of them. But here is my issue with a lot of these lofty novels: I just don't get the dialogue.\n\nAre these people actually talking to each other? Would conversations like this really happen? My sense is, not really. You have people questioning or commenting and responding, but it doesn't feel like they're addressing what the other one said. And then you have some description in dialogue which seems just a little too artistic to be real.\n\nThere are other things I don't get. There was a sense of tension building, but it was never really clear what it was about, where it was coming from, etc. I guess it was meant to have some sort of existential significance, but on the superficial story level I was left scratching my head.\n\nI can't give this less than three stars. Even a cretin like me recognizes that it's artistic and smart, and not entirely impenetrable. But although it may deserve four, or even five, I can't give that high a rating to a book that made me feel so alienated.\n\nNovember 1, 2011\n\nThis is the type of small novel that critics and other novelists love. Jonathan Franzen writes in the introduction: \"It seemed to me obviously superior to any novel by Fox's contemporaries John Updike, Philip Roth, and Saul Bellow.\" Irving Howe ranks it up there with The Great Gatsby, Billy Budd, Miss Lonelyhearts, and Seize the Day.\n\nFor me that's a bit of a stretch. It reminded me of Patricia Highsmith's A Dog's Ransom, another novel where the urban neighborhood is a place of danger and hostility even for those living comfortably. In Desperate Characters Otto and Sophie Bentwood are well-to-do 40-somethings without children, living in the late 60s in a renovated brownstone on a slowly gentrifying Brooklyn street. They are surrounded by garbage, excrement, stray cats, drunk stumbling Negroes, crying babies, lecherous, half-dressed Latino men. Nor can they escape unease and danger by vacationing at their Hamptons farmhouse, which they discover has been vandalized and ransacked, with a pile of excrement left in the living room.\n\nWhen a cat Sophie is feeding bites her and we spend the rest of the novel wondering if she has rabies, it serves as a metaphor both for larger societal dangers, and for the Bentwood marriage, whole but fractured, fraught with tension, anger, boredom, angst. Otto has just broken with his law partner, and Sophie can't stop thinking about the man she had an affair with several years earlier. Everyone in the novel is unhappy, unsettled, and on edge. The title refers to Thoreau's line in Walden about leading lives of quiet desperation.\n\nA couple passages illustrate Fox's descriptive gifts. In the first, Otto and Sophie sit in the hospital waiting room to have her cat bite looked at.\n\nThere was the smell of peanut shells and of the waxy candy wrappers that littered the floor, the smell of old newspapers, dry, inky, smothering and faintly like a urinal, the smell of sweat from armpits and groins and backs and faces, pouring out and drying up in the lifeless air, the smell of clothes - cleaning fluids imbedded in fabric and blooming horridly in the warm sweetish air, picking at the nostrils like thorns - all the exudations of human flesh, a bouquet of animal being, flowing out, drying up, but leaving a peculiar and ineradicable odor of despair in the room as though chemistry was transformed into spirit, an ascension of a kind.\n\nAnd here they are driving out to Long Island; this is probably my favorite passage in the book:\n\nThey drove through miles of Queens, where factories, warehouses, and gas stations squeezed up against two-story, two-family houses so mean and shabby that, by contrast, the ranks of uniform and tidy tombstones rising from cemetery islets that thrust up among the dwellings seemed to offer a more humane future. Sidewalks, brutal slabs of cracked cement, ran for a block or two, then inexplicably petered out, and along the center of the tarmac streets, short lengths of old trolley tracks occasionally gleamed among the potholes. Here and there, the skeletons of a vast new apartment complex sat on the rent ground; tree roots and rocks and earth rolled up around its foundation. Cries of boredom and rage were scrawled across the walls of factories, and among these threats and imprecations, invitations and anatomy lessons, the face of an Alabama presidential candidate stared with sooty dead eyes from his campaign posters, claiming this territory as his own. His country, warned the poster - vote for him - pathology calling tenderly to pathology.\n\nSeptember 26, 2017\n\nThe title of this book comes from Thoreau's famous dictum that the 'mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation', and it is referenced in a fractious exchange between married couple Otto and Sophie and Otto's absent law partner, Charlie - who is the silent, but still important, voice in the conversation.\n\nOtto and Sophie have all of the trappings of middle-class success: the books, the car, the vacation home, the boat, the beautifully set dinner table. But still, the ugliness of life insists on intruding and making itself felt: whether it is the ugly landscape of Queens (so 'mean and shabby' that the 'tidy tombstones' seem to 'offer a more humane future'), the poor and drunken people who leave their trash and bodily fluids on their Brooklyn sidewalk, or the bite of a (possibly rabid?) cat. The reader is catching them in a moment where the 'centre cannot hold' (to borrow from Yeats). Their neighbourhood is changing, the country is changing and Otto's law partnership is splitting apart. I had the sense that they were a post-war 1950s couple who were completely ill-equipped for the social changes of the 60s, and just becoming aware of that fact. Sophie is a translator who doesn't seem to translate any more. It's just one of the details which could be read symbolically; another is the fact that the couple have not had children, and are now realising that they probably never will. Is the author suggesting that their existence has a certain sterility to it? The reader never knows for sure. The tone of the narration stays balanced on the knife-edge of sympathy and cold-eyed judgement, not quite satire, but you feel the edge of it.\n\nJonathan Franzen writes the excellent introduction to this book, and one of his insights - which really struck me - is that 'the fear of pain is more destructive than pain itself'. Throughout the book, Sophie tentatively explores her various pains - her unsuccessful affair, which seems to still haunt her; the cat's bite on her hand - but she shies away from exorcising them or dealing with them conclusively. Neither Otto nor Sophie is happy with the status quo, but they seem to fear losing even that. It's an interesting book - definitely a period piece in some ways, but still quite powerful.\n\nJanuary 31, 2015\n\nI can appreciate the skillful writing, yet I find the book tedious. Another story of the discrete charm of the bourgeoisie and of their petty concerns. I want to scream get a job! Get a life! Create some meaning in your lives, you boring twats!\n\nSome examples: \"How quickly the husk of adult life, its importance, was shattered by the thrust of what was, all at once, real and imperative an absurd.\" (p.112-113).\n\nand: \"For God's sake, be a little uncertain!\" (p. 113).\n\nThe sense of increasing dread created by banal incidents is well portrayed, but I prefer books where there are at least one antagonist that you like. I just want to give them all a smack to the head and tell them to get a grip!\n\nJuly 31, 2022\n\nΜου άρεσε πολύ η στακατη γραφή, γυμνή από φιοριτουρες, χωρίς κανένα συναίσθημα. Οι πρωταγωνιστές ψυχροί και απόμακροι αλλά ταυτόχρονα και τόσο οικείοι και συναισθηματικά φορτισμένοι. Ένας γάμος σε τέλμα και ένα δάγκωμα γάτας που έρχεται να παραλληλίσει την σαπιλα του γάμου με την κακοφορμισμενη πληγή. Εξαιρετικό."
