My first book was published with a traditional small press. Unfortunately, the publisher went out of business, forcing me to self-publish. I am now again with another small traditional publisher with two books.\n\n4zette\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 1:25 am\n\nI have a number of small press and ebook publications in both fiction and nonfiction (writing-related) books. I'm still looking for the 'big sale' but I've done alright.\n\n5zette\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 1:26 am\n\nOh, and the only self-published work I have at the moment is a nonfiction book for NaNo people, okayed by Chris Baty -- NaNo for the New and the Insane. A thousand or more people download it each year and many of them enjoy it.\n\n6iansales\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 10:10 am\n\nI've had about half a dozen short stories published - see here - and I have an agent who is attempting to sell a space opera trilogy.\n\n7Mud\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 10:15 am\n\nNot published or at least not in anything but newsletters. Never been paid for anything.\n\n8lshelby\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 1:17 pm\n\nI have sold a non-fiction article, and two short stories. As far as I know, one of those shorts was never actually published, but I got my check, and it was for 11 cents per word, so I figure I've got no cause for complaint. :)\n\n9JannyWurts\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 1:18 pm\n\nCareer author, seventeen novels/3 more under contract, one short story collection/30 short stories, all traditionally published.\n\nLast time I posted a suggestion to this group concerning a good how to book, the response suggested that this sort of knowledge was not welcomed here - in effect, real writers wouldn't work professionally.\n\nI do write for the love of it - I do make a living by it. Knowledge is better than ignorance, therefore, for the chance that particular experience was an anomaly - here's another try.\n\n10iansales\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 1:24 pm\n\nJanny, there's actually a thread in this group in which several people have recommended books on writing - which makes the response to your suggestion somewhat puzzling...\n\n11adeptmagic\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 2:18 pm\n\nian -\n\nIt doesn't puzzle me. In the past, when I've talked about getting an agent, etc, I've gotten a sort of weird reaction from some people here that I haven't gotten elsewhere that indicated to me that they look down on traditional publication routes. It doesn't particularly bother me--I know what I want and why and how I want it--but it did strike me as odd. I don't know where Janny ran into her issues, but suggesting \"how to\" books about traditional publication routes could easily raise the ire of some folks.\n\n12iansales\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 3:03 pm\n\nAh. I was flamed by the self-publishing evangelists on another thread.\n\n13lshelby\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 3:04 pm\n\nIf you admit that you think traditional publishing is a good idea, some people here will treat you as if you are an imbecile. If you admit that you are considering self-publishing, some people here will treat you as if you are an imbecile.\n\nWhatever you do, don't confess to thinking they both have their strengths and weaknesses -- then all the nuttier elements will be after you, and you'll get no peace at all. ;)\n\nPersonally I welcome the input of anyone else who can manage to speak sensibly, remain on topic, and not get drawn into endless boring philosophical/religious debates about whose way of writing/publishing is better.\n\nIf they have experiences to share, so much the better.\n\n14copyedit52\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 4:36 pm\n\n>12 iansales: Nothing personal, Ian. And in the spirit of amity, I'll overlook the \"evangelist\" provocation.\n\n15iansales\n\nEditado: Feb 21, 2010, 4:39 pm\n\nI was using the term as it's used in the IT industry - i.e., \"champion\" - rather than referencing those creepy blokes with the teabag tans and bouffant hair you see on US television who seem more concerned with parting you from your money than they do saving your souls...\n\n16zette\n\nEditado: Feb 21, 2010, 5:30 pm\n\nI'm not certain why people think this has to be an either/or situation when it comes to publishing. Unless you only write one thing in your life, you are likely to have the opportunity to try to reach traditional publication and to see if other, new opportunities suit you. The world of publishing is changing. We can all see if, but we can't see where it is going to go. It's already changed in ways people didn't expect 20 years ago. It will keep changing. That means opportunities, but not all of them will be good.\n\nMy problem with self-publishing is that many new authors rush into it without having a clue at all of what it means. Your books will not be in the major bookstores. You will not instantly draw readers. And if you haven't bothered to learn about POV, plot or grammar, you are not getting anywhere at all. Unfortunately, the self-publish world is filled with people who think putting the words down is all it takes to be a writer, and they rush off to their favorite self-publish spot and throw the story out to the world. This has given the self-publishing world a very bad name where it comes to quality, and anyone who takes that route is automatically assumed to be in that group and that the book isn't good enough for 'real' publication. Even good writers have a very hard time overcoming this pre-judgment, but when they do it is by a liberal approach to marketing. Marketing is another thing a lot of self-published authors usually don't understand, though.\n\nTraditional publishing is the dream of many authors, both for the prestige and because it usually pays better. However, it is a hard wall to break through, and many writers -- especially younger ones who have grown up in the age of the Internet -- don't have the patience to work harder to achieve that goal. We live in the age of instant books, and authors can have their work ready to sell in an hour. Why would they bother with working harder?\n\nThere are evangelists on both sides of the fence. I tend more toward the traditional side, but I have always tried to temper my self-publishing statements with two things people need to consider. First is that if you are self-publishing because it's 'easy' then you aren't approaching it professionally. You need to work twice as hard as a traditionally published author to make a quarter of the sales. This isn't easy.\n\nSecond, know what you are getting into. This isn't the same as traditional publishing. You, personally, are going to have to sell every single copy of your book. You can't just put a link on your website and expect people to find it. You have to drive people to your site, and then you have to make the book sound interesting enough to draw their attention. Even the middle-ground small press and ebook publishers who use a traditional model (submission, change of rejection, editing), are in better shape to make sales than you are as an individual because they have sites with groups of different authors (which draw more people), and they have access to some distribution that won't be available to you.\n\nOh, and there -- there's the big reason I see so many people leaping at self-publishing. I can't think of how many times I've heard 'I couldn't stand to be rejected.'\n\nFirst, you are not being rejected -- your story is and sometimes for reasons that sometimes have nothing at all to do with the quality of the writing. Second -- grow up. Writing is a tough world and a rejection is the least problem you'll face. Bad reviews, dismissal of your work by friends and family, rude emails -- even if you self-publish, that's what you're going to face.\n\nSeeking traditional publication is a test of patience, if nothing else. Submissions to agents and the few publishers who don't require work come through an agent, limits the field somewhat, but it will still be a long, slow process. Query letters, cover letters and the dreaded synopsis are all art forms in their own rights. And acceptance is certainly not a guarantee of any kind of wealth and fame. However, for many writers this is a pursuit of a dream as much as pursuit of a career. Very few writers can actually make a full-time living at writing, no matter what path they take. Don't assume that a sale to a big name publisher means you're going to be quitting your day job. Also understand that publishers these days expect you to do a lot of marketing. Having a book accepted does not make it easier.\n\nHowever, let's get back to my original statement. There is no reason, in this new, changing world of publication, that you can't try your hand at many different systems of publication, from self-publishing, to ebook publication through an established publisher, to small press publication and on to traditional publication. You do, obviously, need to have a body of written material already done to try your hand at different kinds of publication. If you are pinning your hope of success on a single book, you aren't going to make it in any of the choices.\n\nNo matter what you decide to do, do it wisely and not because it's easier, or even because it's 'your dream.' Learn everything you can and approach any type of publication professionally.\n\n17ajsomerset\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 5:34 pm\n\nGood post, zette, but let's not have the whole self-publishing discussion derail the thread.\n\nRe the OP: do not fear being a \"wannabe\" writer, simply because you're unpublished. Some people remain unpublished despite being excellent writers, while others see their work in print but remain for all intents and purposes wannabes. Being a \"real\" writer is about your attitude towards the work more than whether you ever got paid to write. \"Real\" writers want to be writers, that is, they're interested in writing itself; others just want to be authors, that is, they only want to see their name on the spine of a book. The difference shows up in the quality of the work.\n\n18MinaKelly\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 5:41 pm\n\nShort stories so far, and I have a rewrite request on a novella. Profile has the links. Currently waiting on a ezine that has actually paid me to update their website so I can link the latest.\n\n(re: self-publishing versus trad = the problem is by choosing the former you tend to exclude the latter often reject you out of hand, but if you are part of the latter and move to the former people will assume (a) your publisher dropped you or (b) you're rather overconfident about going-it-alone. All kinds of publishing have their appropriate mediums and markets, and you need to choose the most appropriate for your current work. Much of the marketing is actually the same; it just has more of an impact on sales if you're self-published. For my current work, I favour the bigger ePresses (i.e. print publication only after you've proved yourself with eBook sales) but I have WiPs that suit tad publishers and others that suit self-publishing)\n\n19zette\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 6:27 pm\n\n#17\n\nSince the original post asked if people were either published or self-published, I took it to be part of the discussion.\n\n18 --\n\nWhile it may not be wise to mention self-published work in a cover letter or query, it is not an automatic 'we don't want you' unless you are offering the same manuscript. If you do well, it's even a bonus because it shows you have beat the system.\n\n20AlexandraKitty\n\nFeb 21, 2010, 7:30 pm\n\nI have been published in newspapers as a columnist, in magazines, even in an academic journal and I have had three books published (two non-fiction and one fiction).\n\n21JannyWurts\n\nFeb 22, 2010, 2:06 pm\n\n#10 - I'd only posted a book that had been extremely helpful to me, yes, in that appropriate (I thought) thread about books on writing, with a mention that it was what lifted my efforts from rejects to acceptances, and would have done so two years earlier, had I found the title, before.\n\nNo mention was made about any sort of alternate choices made by other writers - I was simply dumbfounded by the hostility thrown back by the immediate responders. (How dare I presume they Wanted to be published in the first place...)\n\nLeft me wondering if this group did not welcome/warned off writers who chose to pursue their work professionally (which, for me, offers the enjoyment of pursuing storytelling, full time).\n\nThis thread seemed a place to test the waters and find out. That's why I answered the roll call.\n\nI've never told any person what to choose, with regard to pursuit of their talent.\n\nI would suggest, however, there's a horrific amount of misinformation/false advertising prevalent on the internet -- stuff that definitely is geared to mislead an aspirant, if not lure them to part with their hard-earned cash in pursuit of their dream -- but that's quite another topic.\n\n22lshelby\n\nEditado: Feb 22, 2010, 4:10 pm\n\n21 I seem to have missed this infamous thread.\n\nWhich book did you recommend?\n\nI recommended Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army to one of my friends as an excellent reference book (it had been recommended to me by Patricia C. Wrede) and it took her more than ten years for to actually get around to looking at it, at which point she posted to her blog what a great book it was and thanked me for recommending it.\n\nSometimes a bit of good advice that appears to go unheeded does actually bear fruit way down the road. :)\n\n23zette\n\nFeb 22, 2010, 5:26 pm\n\n#17\n\nI just realized what you were saying about my post and I entrirely agree. I must have thought I was on a different thread! Sorry!\n\n24adeptmagic\n\nFeb 22, 2010, 5:40 pm\n\nJanny -\n\nSince I love your writing, I'd like to hear what book you recommended! Can you post it here, even though it received a negative reaction elsewhere?\n\n25JannyWurts\n\nFeb 22, 2010, 10:29 pm\n\n#22, Ishelby, and\n\n# 24 , adeptmagic (blush, thanks by the way!)\n\nWith pleasure, here's a re-post of the book I found extremely helpful -- there is no other like it for providing the nuts and bolts and the toolbox of handling fiction writing:\n\nTechniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight V. Swain\n\n26GaryBabb\n\nFeb 22, 2010, 11:59 pm\n\nOne of the best books I have found to get an agent or publisher is \"The First Five Pages.\" I can't remember the author.\n\n27MinaKelly\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 5:42 am\n\nLeft me wondering if this group did not welcome/warned off writers who chose to pursue their work professionally (which, for me, offers the enjoyment of pursuing storytelling, full time).\n\nInteresting. I've often got the opposite vibe, in fact. That if you're just writing as a hobby - that if, gasp, you go for whole months without writing a word because you just don't feel like it - then you don't deserve to call yourself a writer. Though I suspect that's more of a problem with \"how do you definte writer/author\" threads than this forum in particular; they seem to bring out the more evangelical amongst any community.\n\n28lshelby\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 8:10 am\n\n25 Thanks for the book recommend, Janny. That's one I haven't read yet, I'll have to take a look at it.\n\n27 That is because both forms of extremists hang out here, as I explained above, and naturally they target the people who are appearing to disagree with them, so whatever opinion you express will get jumped all over by the extremists on the opposite side.\n\nThis is a universal of being on the internet, isn't it? There's always someone so desperately insecure that they feel the need to put down other people.\n\n29K.J.\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 8:18 am\n\nMy first book is self-published, for a multitude of reasons, none of which include rejection by a traditional publisher. My book of short stories and essays was not a clean fit for a traditional publisher.\n\nI hope to have a traditional publisher pick up my second book, 'The Other Lamb,' and I have a sense that I may have to self-publish 'An Atheist in a Foxhole,' for a variety of reasons.\n\n30K.J.\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 8:24 am\n\n26> Noah Lukeman is the author, and I read his book after I wrote my first one.\n\n31copyedit52\n\nEditado: Feb 23, 2010, 8:41 am\n\nFinished Digging Deeper, A Memoir of the Seventies, yesterday. The sequel, you might say, to I Think, Therefore Who Am I?, since it begins where that book left off. Only this memoir covers seven or so years instead of one, and is a bit longer; probably 300 or so pages in published book form.\n\nI've been putting off thinking or doing anything about placing it, and now that time has come. I don't even bother sending to agents anymore. My work is not what's called commercial so I'm not an easy sell; though I don't write in an experimental style or lack for characters, dialogue, plot line and the rest. Not worth going into why I'm a hard sell, except to say that I am. So my question is, do I go back with Xlibris, try one of the others like iUniverse, do some research into lulu, or what?\n\nHere are my minimal demands:\n\nIt has to be put in book form--a cover, pages, binding. (I'm not interested in kindle and probably never will be.)\n\nI have to be the one to copyedit it, since I do that professionally at least as well, and for less, than anyone else. (Though I might accept proofreading, if the fee isn't too stiff.)\n\nThe book has to be priced reasonably, or at least the paperback version does. (I had to pay Xlibis to get them to lower the price on my book!)\n\nWhoever publishes it must be an Internet distributor (to amazon, B&N, etc.), since I don't want to extensively peddle my book in bookstores, which often, I discovered with I Think, do not accept books on consignment anyway.\n\nAnd I wouldn't mind choosing and designing my own cover, which I did for the psychedelic memoir, though this is not a deal breaker.\n\n32iansales\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 8:50 am\n\n#31 - you want POD then, not a vanity publisher. Providing the book has an ISBN, then it will appear on Amazon, B&N, etc. The current most popular POD for self-publishing are Lulu, Lightning Source and BookSurge (Amazon's own POD).\n\n33copyedit52\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 8:58 am\n\nThanks for the quick response, Ian. And to think I once flamed you! I'll look into that, and whatever other suggestions come my way that might make this book placing a better one than the last.\n\n34K.J.\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 9:59 am\n\n31 & 33> I spent considerable time with the Lulu model, and came away thankful that I did not pursue it. It would have priced my book out of reach of my audience. Those of us who were from Europe also found the Lulu team to be unbelievably unresponsive, when problems with their Spanish printer persisted. In the end, they ignored the problem, and the writers who were looking for resolution.\n\nInstead of using a Lulu-like format, I did the following:\n\n1. I had already designed my own cover, so this was not something I needed from someone else.\n\n2. I purchased my own ISBN\n\n3. Sent requests for bids to several printers, internationally.\n\n4. I set up my own website, and tagged onto others.\n\n5. Developed relationships with others who would help promote my book to our shared audience.\n\n6. I ship my own books, directly, in a secure and book-specific packet. Not one book has arrived with even a smudge, so far, and no complaints about postage or shipping (Germany allows me to ship Airmail for 6 Euros, worldwide. France is a bit different).\n\nI found a printer who would print in smaller runs, and chose to begin with a 100-copy run, including two proofs for editing. My cost was less than half of what Lulu would charge (including shipping from the UK to my shared studio in Germany), and by taking delivery of the books, I was able to keep track of the quality, whereas with Lulu this is not possible. You will not even hear about quality or shipping problems, unless a reader contacts you directly. By then, it is too late: you have an unhappy customer. You should also know that their shipping charges are sky-high. Read the Lulu forums extensively, before proceeding with them.\n\nIf you follow their model, and use their distribution, it is unlikely that you will make any substantial money from your book. The price for your book will have to be high, to provide the cost of production, and then the discounts necessary for distribution. Out of 100 books, I will have paid off my publishing costs at 45 books, and still keep the cost of my book low. The rest is all profit. Measure this against the income to be secured from Lulu publication and distribution. If I order 500 books from my printer (CPI Antony Rowe, UK), the cost is substantially reduced, and the profit thereby substantially increased.\n\nMy perception of Lulu and like entities is that they are good for the person who wants to create a personal book to give to friends. They do not have the means to drive readers directly to your book. They do minimal advertising and that is directed to authors, and not necessarily readers, which means that a person visiting the site has to weed through thousands of other books, to get to yours. Learn how to drive traffic to your website, and you can beat any traffic they 'purport' to deliver to your Lulu page.\n\nThis is just one experience, though. I would spend some time in the Lulu forums, before making a decision about their possibilities.\n\n35copyedit52\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 10:12 am\n\nThanks for your extensive answer, K.J. I never did set up my own website, and that's something I certainly should do, whatever publishing direction I go in.\n\n36iansales\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 10:14 am\n\nIf the printer you used is not POD, then it's no surprise they were cheaper.\n\nLulu did have problems with printers, but AFAIK they've been resolved. Certainly the last few batches of books I've ordered have been fine.\n\nPostage on Lulu is geared towards large orders. Buy one copy and p&p is £6.50. Buy 20 copies and p&p is... £6.50.\n\nHowever, the advantage of POD is that you don't have to invest £1000s in a substantial print-run, and then fill up your garage with cardboard boxes of books.\n\n37K.J.\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 4:39 pm\n\n36> However, the advantage of POD is that you don't have to invest £1000s in a substantial print-run, and then fill up your garage with cardboard boxes of books.\n\nNeither do you have to do this with many printers. Shop around. My first run was 100 books, and they would run off 50 copies, if I wanted to pay more for them. It didn't make sense to do that, so I opted for a first run of 100, and my costs did not even come close to 1000 BPS.\n\nLulu did have problems with printers, but AFAIK they've been resolved. Certainly the last few batches of books I've ordered have been fine.\n\nAre your books coming from the Spanish printer? Their quality was not consistent before, and if you were using Lulu distribution, you would have no idea what quality the reader was receiving from Lulu.\n\nIn the Lulu forums, there were a substantial number of complaints regarding the high cost of ordering more than 20 books by authors. If this has been resolved it is new information, for me, as I am not aware that they have changed their shipping rates to reflect the concern of USA authors.\n\nIt would appear, from the currency reference, that you are in the UK. If so, you might want to check out CPI Antony Rowe. They did the printing for me, and it was much better quality, from my viewpoint. I will say that the USA quality from Lulu is said to be good, but they refuse to print for European authors, and we were told we had to use the Spanish printer. I chose to take an alternate route.\n\n38K.J.\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 4:43 pm\n\n32> The current most popular POD for self-publishing are Lulu, Lightning Source and BookSurge (Amazon's own POD).\n\nfor Copyedit52: I forgot to mention that I was contacted by a rep from Booksurge (Amazon) and after several conversations and a thorough review of what they would provide, I realized that I would have to sell thousands of books just to recoup my expenses with them. There was no guarantee that I would even sell 100 books, through Amazon, with the help of BookSurge. I thanked the rep for her time and told her I would not be interested.\n\n39iansales\n\nEditado: Feb 23, 2010, 4:54 pm\n\n#37 I believe Lulu were using a Spanish printer, but they now also source from a UK printer. My books came from there. The quality has been fine.\n\nIn April of last year, I bought one copy of my anthology on Lulu. Postage & packing was £7.30. In May, I bought 20 copies. Postage & packing was... £7.30.\n\nI've also been told that UK firm called Biddle - they're used by both PS Publishing and NewCon - give very reasonable rates on low print-runs.\n\nAll the same, lithographic printing still requires you to buy a print-run, however small. POD doesn't.\n\nOh, and I think we're dragging this thread off-topic.

I didn't realize your new book is a sequel to your first. This fact tends to change the publishing opportunities for the worse by linking the two.\n\nThis is the situation I ran into with my second book. I had planned a trilogy, but quickly realized I had dug myself into a rut with self-publishing and small presses. I had to break off from my trilogy after the second book to start something completely new, which I did.\n\nMy third book was a stand-alone, something I could start over with and try to do right. So far this strategy seems to be working for me, but unfortunately, I disappointed my fans by leaving them hanging.\n\nEvent though my stand-alone book may work for me, I have now gone back to complete the last of the trilogy, knowing it will never be picked up by a larger publisher, because of its affiliation with the previous books in the series. Even so, I owe it to the fans to finish the story.\n\nThe good news for me is that I am almost finished with the trilogy, and I can move on to another NEW project.\n\nThe lesson I learned is: \"Don't write sequels or trilogies!\" It will only limit your publishing opportunities. My suggestion is try to keep each work stand-alone to increase your chances of obtaining an Agent and larger publisher. You can always go back and write a sequel IF the first one builds an audience.\n\nIn response to your question seeking suggestions for self-publishing, you might want to check out AuthorHouse. I have found them to be excellent for me.\n\n42sprucely\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 6:24 pm\n\nLuckily, I am.\n\nI have poems, prose, and art work published/forthcoming in journals and magazines - mostly small, experimental.\n\nAnd, I've had a lot more rejections than publication credits.\n\n43mskrypuch\n\nFeb 23, 2010, 7:14 pm\n\nI'm published. My 12th book came out at the beginning of Feb.\n\n44copyedit52\n\nEditado: Feb 23, 2010, 7:35 pm\n\n>41 GaryBabb:. In fact, Gary, my book is a stand-alone. In calling it a sequel I was just explaining that it follows the other one, but except for myself (the first person protagonist), and a character I discuss in a writing group and with a poet friend (using that as a vehicle to talk about writing), there's no one in \"Digging Deeper\" who's in the psychedelic memoir (and even the character from that book whom we discuss needs no backstory explanation). But your info about not couching the book in those terms, as a sequel, is interesting; the drawback never occurred to me. So maybe I'll just keep that on ice.\n\nAnd I will look into Author House. Thanks for the lead.\n\n45MargaretCmelik\n\nFeb 24, 2010, 8:38 am\n\nI am humbled by all of you who actually write entire books.

All non-fiction.\n\n53Toby_Ball\n\nJun 24, 2010, 10:18 am\n\nI went the traditional route and my first book is coming out from St. Martin's in September. It was a loooong process, even after I signed my publishing contract, but I have been happy with how everything has turned out. My book is in a much better place after working first with my agent (a former editor) and then my editor at SMP. Both the plot and the writing are quite a bit better now. I know that people express concern about loss of control, but there was no point in the process where anyone told me I had to do this or that and I agreed with about 90% of the advice given and the other 10% we talked about and people were okay about it if I wanted to keep things the way they were.\n\nAnyway, I have no beef with self-publishing, POD, or small presses. Large presses, in my experience, are filled with smart, hard-working people who genuinely love books. The process can be frustrating, but I think that is a product largely of the sheer number of people who are writing these days rather than arrogance or what-have-you on the part of the bigger publishers. But that's just my opinion.\n\nWriting book-length fiction or nonfiction is an accomplishment that should be celebrated, regardless of how it is eventually published.\n\n54ronmcmillan\n\nEditado: Jun 29, 2010, 11:27 am\n\nTwo books published, both by Sandstone Press, a good independent publishing house (www.sandstonepress.com)\n\nThe first is a travel narrative about the Shetland Islands, BETWEEN WEATHERS, Travels in 21st Century Shetland (which was nominated for the 2008 Saltire Society Literary Awards). The second could hardly be any different, being a crime thriller set in the Far East, a region I know well from my years travelling around it as a journalist and photojournalist.

I can't complain...and for some reason, a seller at Amazon has one of my books priced at $444.00 ($3.99 shipping)...which is bizarre... I'm sure it's a typo...but it's been like that for DAYS (gee, do you think I should tell them? \"Psst, dude...that price is ridiculously high!\")\n\n58MinaKelly\n\nJun 30, 2010, 4:06 am\n\nInsanely high prices are pretty common on resellers of self-published books; you see it loads with secondhand copies of Publish America books even the authors wouldn't buy another copy of. I think the prices are based on number of copies in existence, or availability, or something. They figure since you're a self-publisher there's a chance one day someone will come along and you won't be able to fill that order right away, so that person might (just might!) pay for the ridiculously overpriced copy. Never known of it actually happening, but I guess at prices like that it only takes one to make it worth your while.\n\n59LauraJWRyan\n\nJun 30, 2010, 5:58 pm\n\n58: As far as I know, the book orders are quickly fulfilled without delay through Amazon, and the other sellers through the Amazon marketplace are beating Amazon's price by a dollar, nearly two...B&N sells it even cheaper (go figure).

Not everyone with artistic talent has a head for business or for how to market and sell their work--in fact, I would say many don't. After I took the self-publishing route, writer friends commented on how well I seemed to know how to market my work. Actually, I know nothing about marketing except what I've read in books and observed my parents do when I was younger. And I also know as a reader what really annoys me--and what catches my eye--when it comes to buying books for myself.\n\nI have no illusions about indie authors toppling the bastions of the publishing industry--indie musicians haven't surpassed the record companies' sales, and indie musicians have been at it a lot longer than indie authors like myself. However, I think there's room in the market for some indie authors to succeed and make a living. It's an exciting time to be an author, whether you have snagged an agent or publisher or gone indie. I do think publishers who continue to make print books need to look seriously at print on demand instead of doing these huge print runs of books--huge print runs are neither economically nor environmentally sound, especially when competing with e-books. And it would be nice to have an agent--sometimes all I want to do is write and take a break from the promotion/sales stuff. But hey, my book's out there now, and if it doesn't sell like I want it to, I have time to tweak my marketing strategy and respond to what works and what doesn't. If my book had a traditional publisher, I wouldn't have that time--POD and e-book formats allow me a lot more flexibility to respond to the market, and that's what I like about being self-published. Also, so far, I have loved connecting directly with readers--it's a natural high for me every time I sell a book to someone who doesn't know me and that person enjoys reading it.\n\n66Tbloom\n\nJul 23, 2010, 10:35 am\n\nEste usuario ha sido eliminado por spam.\n\n67zette\n\nJul 23, 2010, 1:57 pm\n\n#66 -- Amazon.com just posted that ebooks are far outselling hardbounds.\n\nEbooks have already come into their own, in my opinion.

I've had less success with my short fiction which has all sold, but most in the small press. I had an agent for my novel Selene of Alexandria, but no success in placing it with a traditional publisher because of the time period it covered (5th C). The publishers kept saying, \"good writing, loved the characters, do you have anything about the Tudors?\" I finally self-published and it's been getting a very good reception by external reviewers and LibraryThing readers (9 reviews so far.) I'm hoping to use the success of this book to sell my next one. We'll see.

I worked with an editor, writers critique groups, and let it be read and polished by people that could give me honest feedback. The most difficult aspect of being an author is marketing, and that applies to both published and self published, but my day job requires marketing so I knew what I was getting into.

(mostrar)\n\nI'd like to say thank you for allowing open acceptance into this group. Before I go any further I must state the following piece so you may know me a little better.\n\nI'm M.D. Birmingham and to be honest I haven't been able to do much leisure reading since Feb 11th, 2007. The year of 2007 after awakening (emerging & merging) from my 63 day non-responsive coma reading wasn't an ability that I was easily capable to do. It's not because I couldn't read and comprehend (as with illiteracy), or my earlier stages of hand dexterity deficits (no gross motor skills). It wasn't because of shortened attention span due to stimuli overload; it was my double vision (best generally explained as a side effect from my coma and injury nature of DAI). Whether it was a large magazine page or typically sized book, whenever I looked at the words on the page it was like staring at a “wordsearch.” All the letters were jumbled on the page and it took much consistent effort to retrain my vision to follow the page line by line; along with my mind. Aside from books and pages with writing, typical exit signs and labels with writing (on doors, etc) that I encountered in my \"world\" (inpatient hospitalized stay) were seen either as a “wordsearch” or double. The double vision caused the same object to appear as you would see if you were to cross your eyes while reading this. One set of the writing is slightly off to the other side (left or right) and a bit lower than its \"twin.\" I did overcome this challenge through the help of time and creating my own strategies to no longer see double but only one object (like 1year olds or younger, vision tests were obviously not possible). Needless to say, that was only one challenge I overcame to write my own autobiography titled Getting There... and yes I did type it entirely prior to submitting as a galley; along with this whole message. For other groups that I belong to I will cut and paste this information regarding the topic question of introducing myself as it is truth to who I am. During the final days to my book’s “being” before becoming \"live\" to the public I made the website www.getting-therebook.com which contains links to the web address (photos, etc) mentioned in the book. You are welcome to follow my trail of \"crumbs\" that will lead you to both desire more and satiation.\n\nI look forward to gaining more info from and within this group.\n\nWith utmost gratitude,\n\n74mdbirmingham\n\nAgo 11, 2010, 3:09 am\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n75rebeccaslibrary\n\nAgo 12, 2010, 5:18 pm\n\nI've had three creative nonfiction essays published in essay anthologies.\n\n76Peter1683\n\nAgo 14, 2010, 4:28 am\n\nIm actually published but through a POD, I know the stigma on them but the house i published through has been great.

My first book was published by a traditional small trade publisher. I decided to self-published my second book in digital form. I've also republished my first book in digital form. Was that a mistake? Only time will tell. I'm not sure I could even explain my reasons. Many self-published authors put a lot of time and money into their publishing efforts, just like small publishers. You need editors, cover graphics designers and layout expertise if you truly want to compete with traditionally published books. You also need to set a marketing budget, and study your market so that you don't waste money on the wrong avenues.\n\nThe success of a book often depends on the author, regardless of how the book was published.\n\n78Menshevixen\n\nEditado: Ago 17, 2010, 11:57 am\n\nI've just had a short story published in a journal.

Advertising your product requires having impressions made. However having an impression made is much different than making an impression and it doesn't guarantee someone that clicked on your Ad will purchase; it only means they have interest. Unfortunately you are doubled taxed. Double taxed because of a sales tax and a cost per click. The following information tells you where to go.\n\nThe internet is definitely a formidable form of marketing that is gaining much more use. Facebook and Twitter are only two names of social media that has vast global coverage. Everybody wants to use these “venues” to make Ads that promote their product. Logic or common sense tells one that part of this form of marketing includes large numbers of continuous impressions. However, many times you have to “pay per click.” Think of it as paying an additional tax on whatever product you are trying to promote, but because the individual “clicked” (shows interest) it doesn’t mean that they will follow through and buy instantly. I was fortunate to “stumble” onto a new service offered by Wpromote that doesn’t charge per click. I was skeptical but it was soon changed as I was easily able to contact a person both by phone and email. The key is that you have a one time payment for your choice of level advertising (minimal-very aggressive), demographic, and Ad preferred. For those that have further interest go to my site www.getting-therebook.com and click on their banner that’s within my page to get more info and/or started.\n\n85gilroy\n\nOct 1, 2010, 9:52 am\n\n#84 > I'm not sure how this relates to if a person is a publised author or not?\n\n86zinarohan\n\nOct 9, 2010, 5:53 pm\n\nI am a published author (3 novels) and 1 self-published.

In my case, I tried for almost twenty years to get my novel out using the traditional publishing route to no avail. The usual rejection was \"not strong enough\". I now understand that meant that one of the central premises in my novel about spies who hid in plain view for decades was preposterous. Well until June 2010 of course, when Russian spies were found to be doing just that. That is when I decided to self-publish lest anymore of my story came out on prime time news.\n\nThe essence of self-publishing is the satisfaction that your story will finally be told. The downside is that you have to be your own publisher, marketeer, PR person, clerk, and bottle washer. In addition, tradition reviewers will generally avoid you like you have leprosy.\n\nIf some literary agent or publisher wanted to speak with me, I would certainly not turn them down. ;)\n\n92KDSarge\n\nDic 8, 2010, 2:08 pm\n\nAfter years of faith that a good book will always find a home, I decided that home was with me.\n\nMy book has a gay main character but the book isn't about his being gay--it's space opera. Even when I found a pro who loved the book, she had to go with the cold hard reality that she'd probably never sell it. Great books break the rules all the time, but my book is not \"great.\" I think it's darned good, though, and deserves to be out there. So I self-published it.\n\nI would hear out a publishing pro who wanted to work with me--but they'd need to be able to back up their enthusiasm with details on how they would talk their way past an editorial board, because I have no plans to write inside-the-box books.\n\nJannyWurts in case she wanders by--I'm an admirer! And I'll check out that book.\n\n93JacobDrake\n\nDic 12, 2010, 3:49 am\n\nI guess that depends on how you view publishing on Smashwords.com. I have ten eBooks there and make money off them, so I am published, but since \"all\" I had to do was write my stories and upload to Smashwords (after many hours of formatting, editing, reformatting, more editing, etc. Oy vey!), some might consider that self-publishing. I see it as the wave of the future in publishing books.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love paper books. I grew up on them. I get high off a new book just printed, but I am open enough to see that eReaders are something many more people every day are enjoying and thriving on. With that in mind, why should I quibble over whether someone reads my book on paper or on an electronic device?\n\nYes, I am published to the tune of ten eBooks so far. One currently being written and three partly done as I am working feverishly on these two vampire series I want to complete.\n\nWriting is infectious,\n\nJake :=\n\n94JacobDrake\n\nDic 12, 2010, 3:57 am\n\nTO: ajsomerset**\n\nGood post (#17). I agree on the attitude a person has about writing. Before I was published I told my wife, \"I have to write, even if they never get published. These stories will drive me insane if I don't sit down and write them out\". Then I became published, but don't make a lot of money (yet), so I'm saying, \"Damn, it would be great to actually make my living off what I write\".\n\nAnyway, regardless of how much I get off my writing, I LOVE what I am doing and could not live without it. Don't tell my wife I said that, que?\n\nWriting - the world's most infectious disease,\n\nJake :=\n\n95PJWetzel\n\nDic 12, 2010, 4:56 am\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n96copyedit52\n\nDic 12, 2010, 8:42 am\n\nSelf-published, again (though my first was \"discovered\" by an Italian publisher and will be translated and appear in bookstores there next year), this time not by Xlibris (I got tired of them trying to rip me off), but an outfit in England called Epic Press--which I learned about in discussion on one of the reader-writer threads.\n\nStill a few glitches to deal with (I had to supply my own cover photo, and you won't find it yet on barnesandnoble.com), but it did become available yesterday:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Digging-Deeper-Seventies-Peter-Weissman/dp/190655711X/ref=...\n\n97PJWetzel\n\nDic 12, 2010, 11:41 pm\n\nHmmmmmm ... when I posted >95 PJWetzel: yesterday, I followed what seemed like acceptable protocol for this thread, which included a 'touchstone' with the name of my book.

Maybe a spammer who didn't like being flagged for it getting 'revenge'?\n\n104PJWetzel\n\nEditado: Dic 15, 2010, 1:59 pm\n\nOK, I'm going to re-post what I deleted above, because it was relevant to this thread:\n\nI self published Twilight's Ashes with a well known POD publisher. But this wasn't mainly for the 'vanity' of seeing my work in print. I have three very specific motivations for going this route in this current publishing enviornment:\n\n1. It was a learning experience. I worked with an editor who taught me a lot. I became familiar with every aspect of the publication process from rough draft to marketing. It was a crash course rather than the slow initiation that the conventional approach might have been--and who knows if I would have ever been successful, or how much time I would have spent going in query-rejection circles without any useful feedback. And in the end I still own all rights to my book, whereas with a conventional publisher I surrender those rights. So I can *still* seek a conventional publisher for the series ...\n\n2. Because this book is the first of a trilogy, which is truly an ongoing story rather than a book and two sequels, my intent on self-publishing the first volume is to serve as an extended query - a sample of my work in polished final form that I can distribute to interested publishers and agents when I'm ready to publish the second volume.\n\n3. (and most relevant to LT), I published the book in order to get feedback from real readers. (I've done a Member Giveaway and am going to do another combined MG and Hobnob Giveaway.) Readers provide feedback that fellow writers in the various critique groups I participate in cannot provide -- they aren't looking for technical issues so much as for the value of the content. I plan to take advantage of the readers' perspectives that I get in order to refine and improve Books 2 and 3.\n\nI spent a good chunk of cash in this process--the self-publishing industry is very much about getting a hook into you by offering an apparently low price, and then seeking to milk you for lots of other services that are *absolutely* necessary to produce a marketable book worth reading (such as professional editing and proof-reading). If you publish on the cheap, you are seriously doing your work a disservice - better not to publish than to go off half-cocked.\n\n105MinaKelly\n\nDic 16, 2010, 5:38 am\n\nAnd in the end I still own all rights to my book, whereas with a conventional publisher I surrender those rights. So I can *still* seek a conventional publisher for the series ...\n\nI don't want to burst your bubble, but the odds of it being picked up now are incredibly slim. Unless it proves hugely popular (talking about the tens of thousands of sales) and you can show there's still an untapped market, most publishers won't touch something that's used up its first rights. First Rights are used the minute the audience exapnds beyond people you have personally sent it to, and commercial publishers can be pretty precious about them.\n\nPlus, it could count against you in the long run, as they'll wonder why you went for the crash course rather than the conventional route, and make assumptions about you and your writing that may be unfair. Whatever you do, if you do query with the novel, don't send them a copy of the pre-published book (but do mention it has already been published), because they'll probably throw it away without reading and that's a waste of your time and money.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't think about commercial publication for the series now, and focus on getting the furthest you can along the path you've started. If you have the time and money to invest in marketing, especially on getting it into bookshops, you'll find it rewarding, even if not as ultimately profitable as commercial publishing.\n\n106iansales\n\nDic 16, 2010, 7:19 am\n\n#104 what rights do you surrender to a conventional publisher? Copyright always remains with you.\n\n107MinaKelly\n\nDic 16, 2010, 11:41 am\n\nIt depends what you negotiate, but you can surrender print, digital, foreign language, audio and film rights, and you can surrender them all for life-of-copyright, if the publisher tries it on and you don't have an agent/lawyer to stop them. They can even take the rights to books you haven't written yet, and to derivative works to what you have, and to your penname (Harlequin used to do this, until authors put up a real fight). You retain copyright but you sign away the ability to do pretty much anything except be acknowledged as the holder of that copyright.\n\nA conventional publisher will usually make a grab for everything, and for as long as possible, but will allow an author to negotiate the rights down to something more reasonable (say, print and digital until sales drop below a certain point, right of first refusal on sequels, audio and film for a set number of years, and you keep foreign language rights for your agent to sell to someone else). That's why agents are so crucial when playing with the big boys. Yes, you have to make some concessions you may not want to, but on the other hand your book will reach audiences across the country, not just friends-of-friends, and you get an advance for it.\n\n108gilroy\n\nDic 16, 2010, 12:00 pm\n\nI heard that there was a court case regarding the rights to books not writte and derivative works. An agent or publisher tried to claim a breach of contract on Martha Grimes related to books she had published since leaving said agent/publisher. I can't remember what the court case said, other than they can't hold the claim once you are no longer a client.\n\n109iansales\n\nDic 17, 2010, 4:44 am\n\nA conventional publisher will contract for worldwide first publication rights. If they demand anything more, they're not a conventional publisher.\n\n110PhilipChen\n\nEditado: Dic 17, 2010, 6:29 am\n\nThe discussion about the spam patrol flagging posts here and on other forums (most notably, the Amazon Forums) struck a chord with me. In response, I started a board called the Independent Authors Forum at http://pugetsoundspeaks.com to provide a place where readers and authors can convene to talk about what's most important: books, without having to always look over their shoulders for the spam patrol. I work under the premise that we are all adults and as adults we will self police to assure our selves that collegial conversations will be unencumbered by trollish behavior on everyone's part. Check us out.\n\nBack to the main theme of this thread, I believe that the world is large enough for all manner of publication strategies. EReaders are becoming increasingly popular and as a result it is lowering the initial cost of entry for many writers, present company included. However, I doubt that eReaders will render the traditional book obsolete as many people, myself included, enjoy the pleasure of holding a physical book in our hands.\n\nI think that the smart author will look to both methods for delivering their words to potential readers. As a result, the traditional approach to publishing, i.e., through a literary agent and publishers will be with us for a long time to come. Self-publishing places too great a burden on writers to be everything in order to make their words widely know and distributed. This is what agents and publishers do best.\n\nThere is resistance from the traditional world in accepting indie books, though I find it difficult to understand why. In my case, the absolute best review I ever got was from a traditional book reviewer who does not review indie books and definitely no eBooks, who agreed to look at my novel on almost a lark. He finished his review with the words (rarely uttered by him),\n\n\"If you read just one novel in 2011, make it Falling Star.\" (Alan Caruba)\n\nMaybe, the walls are coming down?\n\n111PJWetzel\n\nDic 17, 2010, 8:14 am\n\n>105 MinaKelly: I appreciate you sharing your knowledge, and I take it seriously. I understand the stigma associated with POD publishing - it was an eyes-wide-open risk I chose to take in today's changing landscape. (Note that even Publisher's Weekly has begun to print a quarterly supplement listing self-published works submitted to them. The first one comes out this month.)\n\nYes, I will go all-out marketing this first book. But my horizon is long term (or as much so as a 62-year-old can muster). First and foremost I want to finish writing and polishing books 2 and 3. (I'm almost done book 2 as we speak and am just brimming with energy to write the killer climax at the end of book 3.) Then begin to work to find a conventional publisher for them. If I do, and the enterprise is reasonably successful, then it's reasonable to expect that the publisher will want to release a second edition of book 1 in order to have 'control' of the entire trilogy.\n\n112oldstick\n\nDic 18, 2010, 9:59 am\n\nIt seems you are happy to use your first book as a giveaway taster and as long as you are not trying to make money on it that seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, I have found that writing a trilogy means the only people who are eager to read book two are those who have read book one. This makes marketing the second book difficult unless you link them together.\n\nMy greatest problem is that both my books are now being shared by people who lend them to friends and , because of the lightweight novels that they are, no-one minds if they get passed on rather than staying in the purchaser's library.\n\nObviously it is slightly different with POD as you will be doing much more advertising on line in order to get your book known but there is nothing quite like the kick one gets when a reader of the first book asks for the second!\n\noldstick.\n\n113copyedit52\n\nEditado: Dic 18, 2010, 4:40 pm\n\nYeah, it's tough publishing your own book. But after years of going the traditional route and getting nowhere, I didn't see that I had a choice. So I published my first book with Xlibris, and just published the second with an outfit called Epic Press--a lead I got on one of these threads.\n\nAnd in between the two (a few of you have already heard this tale, I suspect), the most unlikely of success stories (though it was of course a success to see my book in print, and have an actual audience): a publisher in Rome contacted me (how they found my e-mail address, I still don't know), apparently having come across my book on amazon or one of the other Internet outlets, asked if I owned the rights, then read it and offered me a contract.

Dealing with Italian--not the kind of Italians I know from Brooklyn and New Jersey, as I've told a few people, but Italian Italians--has been an education. I did wonder about the operatic drama with which they decided to promote the book, for instance, but now I'm just sitting back and enjoying it.\n\nAlso, while publishing myself, I chose the typeface and the cover; there are some plusses to it. Now, there are sales and marketing people making decisions, in an exchange for which, of course, my book will appear in bookstores and be read by more than a few hundred people.\n\n116K.J.\n\nDic 23, 2010, 7:47 am\n\n115> It is Italy, after all.\n\n117megwaiteclayton\n\nEditado: Dic 23, 2010, 11:38 am\n\nI have a third novel, the Four Ms. Bradwells, coming out in March.

Sometimes somone new is picked as the \"new shiny\" - it helps if they're prolific and unibquitous - and then people start to talk about their fiction. Quality is entirely irrelevant. It doesn't help when there are only a handful of people who set tastes for readers - editors of magazines, or popular commentators, for example.

Not sure if either counts, but it was sure harder than I expected it to be. And I've got some paperwork to contend with at a later date when it eventually reaches me.\n\nDue to the large volume of vampire books already published, I didn't think mine (which isn't a YA about some teen in love with the hot vampire) stood a chance of getting published any other way, despite those who read it wanting to see more. I edited and polished it several times (to the very best of my abilities), but, for above reason, I'm not expecting a major influx of buyers. I'll be happy if it eventually reaches 50 sales.\n\nI fully understand the unlikelihood of an agent snaffling up an already self-published work. But I wonder how it can hurt the chances of a second book if you choose to go the agent route for that not-published, and completely unrelated, second book as I thought agents were meant to go on the merits of each book. What if your first story was less likely to appeal to a wide audience (or in my case, most of the agents are screaming ‘no vampire novels!’), but your second has a far better chance?\n\nAnd surely those who have had success at self-publishing and (for whatever reason), choose the agent route can still use that accomplishment to highlight their marketability.\n\nSorry for the rambling. I'm still new to both the eBook and self-publishing things (after swearing I'd never have anything to do with either) and a little baffled by some of the assumptions.\n\n142randyattwood\n\nJul 26, 2011, 10:13 pm\n\nI'll join in here by repeating a post I've done elsewhere\n\nReflections of an aging writer\n\nI started trying to create fiction in college.

Very short. Some not bad.\n\nBest thing for me was I went to work for a newspaper whose publisher/editor wrote a wonderful column. I got into doing columns and editorials along with reporting and editing. Doing the column helped me find my writing voice.\n\nIdeas came. Longer pieces were tried. Nothing really worked. Everything seemed forced. In my 40s things finally started to click. I was up by 5 a.m. and my eight-year-old son was up, too, practicing the piano (Koji Attwood, google him). I'd write for two hours and go to work at the paper. Then you start to try and get published and query letters to agents, some interest, no cigar. I had an address for Walker Percy. I sent him a letter and the first two chapters of \"The 41st Sermon.\" \"Reads fine. Send rest\" he responded. I thought I might finally get a break. I waited and waited. Three months later I read his obit in the paper.\n\nKeep writing. New idea worth pursuing. Opening scene worth getting on paper. See where it might go. Characters get born and you wonder what will happen to them. Keep exploring.\n\nWriting conferences, small literary magazines, writers groups. None of it turned our right or helpful for me.\n\nInternet arrives. Easier to email queries. Web based magazines appear. Some accept my work. Got paid $150 for one story. Found a couple of agents, amateurs it turned out. And work and life and all that brought a long period in my life where I shoved the fiction aside with a \"I tried. I couldn't have written any better than I have.\"\n\nGot laid off near 60. Freelance writing helped, not financially, but the ego. Interesting consulting work developed. Re-approached the whole effort of finding an agent. Nada.\n\nCould be self-delusional. Maybe my stuff is junk. Time to test myself with comedy. If you could make a reader laugh, you've succeeded. Had an opening scene idea and the damn thing almost wrote itself in three months. Never had anything come that fast. I have a novella that took me 30 years.\n\nFinally snared an agent. \"Reminds me of Hiaasen.\" Nice. Work got before editors at good houses. Close, but no cigar. Recession hits, Kindle happens, publishing business turned upside down.\n\nNever wanted to self-publish. Seemed like admitting defeat. Then the agent says a couple of editors urged self-publishing. Now they can use author-paid test marketing.\n\nSo here I am. And now semi-retired so I have more time to pursue all this and plenty of completed works beside the agented one to promote. It actually feels pretty good that my stuff can find a home outside my file cabinet. Now it's up to me to go out and find an audience for them. What a brave new world that is.\n\nI wonder how young writers do it now. I spent a lot of time with my writing and my ideas. Rereading, rethinking, rewriting. The internet is a huge distraction. Especially when you're involved in self-promotion. To create, I need a lot of stare-off-into-space time. But now I bounce around websites and follow tweets and Facebook messages and blogs. Overload.\n\nThanks for giving me your eye time.\n\n143pameladavis\n\nJul 31, 2011, 3:54 am\n\nMy first novel was published this year by a small press.\n\nI am thinking of trying the self-published route on a shorter novel later this year, just to see how it is different.\n\n144mikomi6\n\nAgo 1, 2011, 11:05 pm\n\nI was first published 10 years ago then I went the self publish route .\n\n145Stephen_Graff\n\nAgo 3, 2011, 6:10 am\n\nI'm self published with a novel on amazon and barnes and noble. So far, not much happening but I'm trying to make use of the commonly used internet strategies.\n\n146JesseVCoffey\n\nAgo 12, 2011, 1:27 pm\n\nIf they looked askance, then they're either self-deluding or flat out full of crap. Find me one Indie Published author that would turn down a chance at a big contract and I'll show you someone lying through their teeth.\n\nI'm very happy as an indie author. I like the control I have over my story, my editing, my cover. I like taking my product straight to the reader because ultimately they are the ones who are the gatekeepers and I don't need any buffer between me and them. If I suck, I suck. If I don't, they'll tell me that too. I like that.\n\nBut, baby, I ain't stupid. Crazy, but not stupid. And if one of the big six offered me a trad contract, I'd be all over that thing like a duck on a june bug.\n\nI thought this group was about writing in general, and that includes all types. So, as far as I'm concerned, until they split this group in to Indie Readers/Writers and Legacy Readers/Writers, you got the right, baby. Go for it. We'll talk.\n\n147JesseVCoffey\n\nAgo 12, 2011, 2:13 pm\n\nI am a published author--both sides of the aisle, actually. You're not the only one in the group. Although, hopefully more recently replies come your way along with mine. ;-)\n\n148MarysGirl\n\nEditado: Ago 16, 2011, 12:59 pm\n\n146> There are reasons to turn down a contract, given the panic in the traditional publishing world and the draconian contracts they are putting out now: little or no advance, excessive rights grabs and \"non-compete\" clauses are good ones. Everyone has to look at the money thing and decide what they can live with...some can do better going Indie. If the publisher wants all rights for everything in perpetuity and won't budge, I don't think I'd go for it. Publishers have also recently started inserting language that says an author can't write/publish anything without their permission--not just similar books with the same characters, but ANYTHING including blogs, non-fiction, short stories, etc. No one but me will control my writing career. Everyone will have the things they need to draw the line on; these are mine. Authors can get these modified to something reasonable with a lot of hard negotiating, but they have to be willing to walk away from a contract if they can't get the publisher to budge or else give up control of their money, work and career. Here's an excellent blog post by an author, who has feet in both worlds, on what could be deal breakers:\n\nhttp://kriswrites.com/2011/07/27/the-business-rusch-deal-breakers/\n\n149C_S_McClellan\n\nAgo 16, 2011, 6:59 pm\n\nCall me a liar, Jesse. I just self-published my first novel, through Smashwords and B & N's Pubit. Would I turn down a big contract (not that it will ever happen)? You bet. Why? Because I'm not so hungry for money that I'd give up control of my work. Years ago, when it was the only choice, I dreamed of writing a novel (novels) and publishing with one of the big houses. That was then, this is now. I'm an adult of advanced years who knows exactly why I write and what I want to gain from it. And signing a contract is *not* one of the things I want.\n\nDo I think my position is appropriate for everyone? Not at all. I have no problem with anyone who wants to see their books in print with an established publisher. Or with someone who starts out Indie and then signs a contract.\n\nBut I do resent the hell out of being told that my choice is a self-deluded lie.\n\n150gilroy\n\nAgo 17, 2011, 7:51 am\n\nI'm seeing a lot of assumption that signing a contract \"gives up control of my work.\"\n\nCan I ask where people are getting this concept from?\n\n151C_S_McClellan\n\nEditado: Ago 17, 2011, 10:26 am\n\nSo, having someone else decide how your book will be priced, how long it will be available, how or whether it will be promoted, giving up many rights, and literally losing ownership of it for some specified time, etc., etc. isn't giving up control? Have you bothered to read any of the widely available discussions of book contracts?\n\nBut, as I said, it may be right for some people. I'm not arguing that. The claim was made that anyone who says they'll turn down a contract is a liar. That's what I was responding to.\n\n152gilroy\n\nAgo 17, 2011, 10:31 am\n\n#151 I wasn't targeting you specifically. I saw many people state that in this thread.\n\nAs for deciding pricing, part of that is related to your advance. How long it will be available is something you can negotiate, plus with the new advance of everyone having e-books, that changes everything. Promotion has always been up to the author unless you're a HUGE name. What rights are sold is entirely up to the author. If you don't want to sell the movie rights, then don't. If its a breaker for the contract offer, then perhaps that's a sign that the house in question isn't worth working with right then.\n\nUm, yes, I've read many discussions regarding book contracts. Most of the issues listed relate to smaller publishers and scammers who make bad names for those houses who do legit work.\n\n153RobertCollins\n\nAgo 22, 2011, 9:32 pm\n\nHello, all,\n\nI've been published by small presses and I'm presently self-publishing. My first three SF novels came out through small presses. I rereleased my first earlier this year; I'm hoping to do so with my second soon. I have plans to self publish a short novel in the next couple weeks.\n\nI also had several nonfiction books released by small publishers. I went the SP route with a series of travel booklets 20 years ago. I've gone that way with a few of my newer nonfiction books.\n\nI've sold many SF/F short stories over the last 20 years; one pro sale and the rest to small press magazines. A few months ago I started selling my published stories through Amazon and Smashwords.\n\nI like the control I have over the process. Not to say that, if asked, I'd turn down a contract from a big publisher. I doubt I will, so I'll try to find readers on my own and keep writing.\n\n154Singa.Crew\n\nAgo 23, 2011, 7:35 am\n\nWell, I am a published author but because\n\na) I am a noob and...\n\nb) Mine isn't a novel but a mere volume of short stories. *\n\nSo anyway, due to the above two reasons, I am not getting much help from my publisher with regards to marketing. I mean yeah, they distributed my book to major book chains in the region and set up an online store on their website, but I have to do all the marketing myself without any advertising budget etc.\n\nSinga Crew\n\n* I personally contributed more than a few chapters but the rest I compiled from other sources and edited.\n\n155JaneReed\n\nSep 8, 2011, 3:11 pm\n\nI am self-published .... using amazon and Barnes and noble.\n\n156mikomi6\n\nSep 8, 2011, 3:28 pm\n\nJust to jump in with a quick note on giving up control when you sign a contact. Many people feel this is true because it does happen a lot. Not just with writing but also with music. My ex was a succesful musician who once the record label got ahold of his work and he signed on the dotted line they chewed it up and spit it out and everything from the album artwork to how they were promoted was totally wrong.\n\nI also just read in a gaming magazine about what happened to the old ' Mario Brothers\" video game movie. It was so far from what the video game was about the movie was considered a disaster.\n\nHowever on a positve note I think that if someone is fortunate enough to get a paid contract that there are good points to what your publishing house has to say as to changes in the story, market, jacket work etc.\n\nCompromise I think is golden.\n\n157pjsullivan\n\nSep 10, 2011, 3:20 pm\n\nI self published three times because I am not a superstar.\n\n158A.G.Claymore\n\nSep 21, 2011, 1:45 pm\n\nI self published my first novel a few months ago. I don't know if I would want to go the traditional route but maybe I would change my tune if I was approached.\n\nI enjoy the freedom of telling the story I want to tell and not having to change the characters. I also enjoy creating my own art on Paint.net and Blender. Though that time might be better spent on writing the next story...\n\nI think the term 'traditionally published' is gong to evolve over the next few years. Publishing houses are reporting lower print sales every quarter, despite charging more for eBooks than for paperbacks. Surely such literary minded folk will see the writing on the wall. I believe we will see the end of the traditional submission process. Commissioning editors will start approaching successful self pubbed writers with offers rather than sifting through piles of manuscripts.\n\nWhy take chances on the pile on your desk when you know you can print a sure thing?\n\n159dgr2\n\nSep 21, 2011, 6:12 pm\n\nI am self-published in trade paperback, Mobi and Kindle.\n\n160Mr_Rice\n\nSep 26, 2011, 1:33 pm\n\nI'm both. I published my first novel last year with a small publisher and this year I decided to have a go at it myself with a novella. Both reviewed pretty well, but it's a long, hard journey getting the word out myself (though it is more satisfying to reep all the rewards of my labor).\n\n161MiriamVanScott\n\nNov 2, 2011, 2:04 pm\n\nRe: giving up control with the 'traditional publishers'\n\nI sold my first book to Facts On File, a 'traditional' pub house and sent them the ms. Before it was published, FoF was sold and the new owner put EVERYTHING 'on hold' to go over it and decide whether or not to go forward with the book projects currently under contract. I was told it would be at least 3 YEARS before I got a decision, and could not shop the ms. to anyone else since it was technically still under contract with FoF. After months of negotiations, I repaid the advance and also had to pay a lawyer to terminat all FoF's rights and return exclusive control to me. It was costly, and then I had to start the entire submissions process over from square one.\n\nThe book (Encyclopedia of Hell) was then purchased and yes, published by St. Martin's Press / Thomas Dunne, but it was a very long, tough road. Control doesn't just mean 'creative input,' it can be the difference between whether your work ever sees the light of day or dies on some bean counter's desk!\n\n162gilroy\n\nNov 2, 2011, 2:22 pm\n\n#161\n\nUnless I'm being misinformed, every standard and legitimate book contract has a revision clause that says if a book isn't published with X number of months/years, the rights automatically revert back to the writer. Did your contract not have such a clause?\n\n163MiriamVanScott\n\nNov 3, 2011, 7:07 am\n\nThe problem was that the new owners claimed that THEY did not agree to any of the terms of the contracts --- since they bought the company AFTER those contracts were negotiated --- so they didn't have to honor them. Sure, I could have contested that but that too would have meant hiring a lawyer and many authors (like myself at the time) often don't have the resources to take on a publishing house that can drag out litigation for years.\n\nFor subsequent books, I have added a clause addressing what happens to the book and my rights should the company's onwership change between purchase and publication.\n\nMy point is that there are very real issues of 'control' when a book is published by a traditional publisher, including some you might never even anticipate when signing the contract\n\n164DErnst\n\nNov 8, 2011, 2:07 pm\n\nI'm self-published as an ebook and trade paper. I had an agent - still do, actually, we just had lunch - and she gave me her blessing after trying and failing to sell my book for over a year. I appreciated all her hard work and will definatly let her see my new manuscript when it's finished, but she understands how and why I may go directly to self-pubbing.\n\n165carolinegerardo\n\nNov 8, 2011, 5:09 pm\n\nTraditional published, indie published, performance poet, slam poet,\n\n166megwaiteclayton\n\nNov 20, 2011, 8:20 pm\n\nI have three novels published now, and am working on a fourth for Random House/Ballantine:\n\n- the national bestselling The Wednesday Sisters\n\n- Bellwether Prize finalist The Language of Light\n\n- The Four Ms. Bradwells (coming in paperback next month)\n\n- the forthcoming The Wednesday Daughters\n\nI also host a blog, 1st BOOKS; STORIES OF HOW WRITERS GET STARTED, on which I host book-published, often award-winning or bestselling, authors sharing their stories. It's at http://megwaiteclayton.com/1stbooks I have Julia Glass (NYT Bestseller and National Book Award winner for her 1st novel, Three Junes, which was years in the making and saw a lot of rejection) posting today.\n\nAnd I've written for The Los Angeles Times, The San Jose Mercury News, Runner's World, Writer's Digest, the Literary Review, and other online and print sources.\n\nMeg\n\nwww.MegWaiteClayton.com\n\n167metis63\n\nNov 20, 2011, 10:15 pm\n\nI published an academic dictionary a couple of years ago with a reputable press. The work filled a low cost niche, and it was a labor of love. I received the contract within a year of finishing my dissertation, and it took about two and a half years to complete the manuscript, edit it thoroughly, and have it shipped. I am grateful to the publisher for taking it on.\n\nI have also published some short articles for a major academic dictionary. Even those small pieces give a sense of satisfaction. It is all about communicating something meaningful.\n\n168MaryChase\n\nNov 22, 2011, 1:44 pm\n\nI started out as a traditionally published author in the early 90's with four books. I took a break for cancer, divorce, work, etc., and when I came back, publishers in my genre, Regency Romance, had shrunk to one or two houses. The spots for mid-list authors had also withered.\n\nWhen I started writing suspense, I discovered I no longer had the patience for the long response times from agents and editors. I'm not getting any younger, oddly enough, so I decided to self-publish. It is starting to be a much more acceptable venue than it used to be.\n\nThe biggest problem I see is that many self-published writers haven't done sufficient revision to produce a smooth story. Even though I self-publish now, I am still in a critique group and revise everything at least 5-6 times. Often more. You can't ignore craft, regardless of how you publish.\n\n169NefTwink\n\nNov 26, 2011, 10:37 pm\n\nI've self-published a short story and my memoir. Both are available on Amazon.\n\n170dgr2\n\nDic 1, 2011, 6:07 pm\n\nI am probably going to stay an Indie or self published author. Apart from the obvious pitfalls and those outlined above, I actually enjoy doing it all myself, including the images on the covers.\n\nThe advent of ebooks means that the printing, despatch and warehouseing costs have all gone. And the risk and cost of returnable books has also gone. Although I have my books as trade paperbacks (now with Createspace) the majority of any sales I make will be through the ebook versions. I just like to have the actual book versions for me personally, and to register the book as an actual book with ISBN for copyright purposes.\n\nThe longer this goes on, the less interested I will become in an actual publisher.\n\n171NineTiger\n\nMar 16, 2012, 2:50 pm\n\nIndie.\n\nMGP\n\n172JonathanGarrett\n\nMar 16, 2012, 4:11 pm\n\nSelf-published\n\nI think, however, that the line between published and self-published (likely regarded right now as the professionals vs. the indies) is going to become very blurred over the next 5 to 10 years. More \"professional\" writers go the self-publishing route for one reason or another and young, up-and-coming writers choose to go the self-published route and achieve success.\n\n173MarkJacobs\n\nMar 24, 2012, 1:15 pm\n\nSince you asked... I've had several published non-fiction books and written for a number of newspapers and magazines. But I also have several novels I could never find a home for just sitting on my computer.
