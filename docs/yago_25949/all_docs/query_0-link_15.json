        "text": "If there were such things as urban renewal projects for people, then Sophie and Otto Bentwood (Shirley MacLaine and Kenneth Mars), a couple approaching lovelessness and middle age on the outskirts of Brooklyn Heights, would be likely prospects for immediate aid.Otto is a well-to-do lawyer and Sophie is an occasional translator of books, but their emotional lives are run down and scarred as their renovated brownstone is handsome and spruce. They are childless, middle-class city dwellers, coming apart in a world whose problems have grown beyond the liberal's capacity to comprehend, much less solve.The time of \"Desperate Characters\" is now, and it could be taking place just a year or two before Jules Feiffer's \"Little Murders.\" In the vision of Frank D. Gilroy, who produced and directed the film, as well as adapted Paula Fox's novel, New York is still functioning, but all of the omens are bad.When Sophie feeds a stray cat, it bites her and for several days she's threatened with a series of rabies shots. Otto, contemptuous of his law partner, who specializes in needy cases, is, nevertheless, a guiltily easy mark for a fast-talking, black chizzler, who insinuates himself into the house to use the telephone and then walks out with a nonrepayable $10 loan.The subways they ride are inhabited by two kinds of people, those who talk to themselves and those who pretend not to notice. The streets are boobytrapped with garbage and dog excrement and drunks who might be stiffs. There's an obscene phone call, a rock tossed through a window and a depressing visit with Leon, an English professor who won't eat in the cafeteria because he's afraid someone will slip a little acid into his soup.I describe all of this at some length because it reflects the quality of the film itself, which is full of the details of urban desperation, painfully and accurately observed at eyelevel, without exploitation or condescension. Yet I must confess that \"Desperate Characters\" left me, if not unmoved, then unenriched. It's as if its cheerlessness had been bottled straight, without the additive that transforms recognizable experience into art.I've not read Miss Fox's novel, but I've been told that Gilroy's adaptation is a model of fidelity, even to careful inconclusiveness with which it treats the future of the Bentwood mariage. In every respect, the screenplay is a vast improvement over Gilroy's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"The Subject Was Roses.\" Its literary style, however, is similar, and it's a style to which I, for one reason or another, find it difficult to respond.His characters talk in great chunks of theatrical exchanges, and monologues, which not only deny the splendid accuracy of the situations and the settings, but also somehow make me suspicious of the integrity of the characters. This is especially true of the supporting characters, who are always telling us too much, remembering too many details out of the past, nudging us for sympathy and never letting us discover them at our own speed.In drama, as in real life, people have to earn the right to bestow confidences, as well as to receive them. There is a dramatic license for just about everything, including Gilroy's style of theater, a style that I associate with the more serious television writing of the 1950's. It is not, however, for me.Perhaps because they have more time on screen, and are less pressed to make their points quickly, the stars of the film come off best, which is not always the case in movies with lots of little character-specialty numbers. I have nothing but admiration for both Miss MacLaine, who seems to be as sweet and appealing as a woman at the end of her rope can be, and Mars, whose denseness and cruelty are obviously the eroded remains of decency.\"Desperate Characters,\" which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, marks Gilroy's debut as a film director, and I have a feeling that the director has perfectly served the writer. That is to say that Gilroy has realized the movie he intended to make. I wish I liked it more.\n\nThe CastDESPERATE CHARACTERS, directed by Frank D.
