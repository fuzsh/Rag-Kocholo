        "text": "In the past few years Paula Fox has been rediscovered as the author of six novels, at least two of which, Desperate Characters and The Widow's Children - both published in Britain for the first time this month - have a cliam to a place on the list of 20th-century American classics. Fox is already well-known as the author of two dozen much-loved and generously garlanded children's novels. Yet until they were recently reissued in the US with specially commissioned introductions and much fanfare, the last of her adult novels had been out of print since 1992. Most of the earlier books had been unavailable for decades. Jonathan Franzen has, notoriously, ranked her above Roth, Bellow and Updike and others have compared her with Kafka, Chekhov and Flaubert.\n\nSome of the recent fuss has focused on Fox's life. In 2001, prompted in part by a mugging that left her with serious cranial bleeding and a sudden intimation of mortality, she published a memoir of her childhood, Borrowed Finery, which was excerpted in the New Yorker and published here last year. It is a tale of startling neglect, told with a combination of directness and reticence unusual for the form. As with her fiction, the impression is of distanced, though not unfeeling, control - and so what you don't expect is the warmth and vigour of her physical presence (she turned 80 in April, but looks far younger) and her laughter. Then there's her voice: husky, perfectly modulated, very deep, capable of great \"tonal drama\", to borrow a phrase from The Widow's Children .\n\nFox's mother Elsie, determined not to have children, had already had three or four abortions, but did not realise she was pregnant with Paula until too late, so the baby was instead deposited at a foundling home in New York. From there she was rescued by Elsie's mother, Candelaria de Sola, once the beautiful Spanish child-wife of a Cuban plantation owner, now sad and passive, \"the paid companion of an ancient cuckoo woman\" on another Cuban plantation, and temporarily visiting the States. The baby was passed from friend to friend. When she was five months old, a Congregational minister, the Reverend Elwood Corning, doing the rounds of his parishioners in Orange County, New York, noticed her. \"I struck him in some way - so he took me and he kept me with him until I was almost six years old.\" Fox laughs. \"Mr Corning was my first conquest. Alas, my mother and father were not.\"\n\nThis did not mean that Elsie or her husband Paul Hervey Fox - a minor novelist and Hollywood screenwriter ( The Last Train to Madrid , said Graham Greene, is \"the worst movie I ever saw\"), ruinously handsome and an alcoholic in thrall to his wife - ignored Paula's existence. They tended instead toward brief, dramatically disruptive appearances. Five-year-old Paula's first meeting with her mother, for instance, was so calamitous that, she wrote in Borrowed Finery , \"I sensed that if she could have hidden the act she would have killed me.\" When, during the same visit, Paula was badly scratched by a cat, her instinct was not to tell her parents; instead, that bite played a central role in two of her best books, Desperate Characters and One-Eyed Cat .\n\nNot long after, another visit with Paul and Elsie, temporarily in New York (\"their arrangements, as far as I could work out, were permanently temporary\") ended when her mother threw a glass at her. \"Water and pieces of ice slid down my arms and over my dress,\" she wrote. Many years later Paul told his daughter that \"She gave me an ultimatum ... She said, 'Either she goes or I go' ... I had no choice, he said, in a faintly self-pitying tone of voice.\"\n\nBut Paula loved and trusted \"Uncle Elwood\" absolutely. He taught her to read and listened to her, and showed her that \"everything counted and that a word spoken as meant contained a mysterious energy that could awaken thought and feeling in both speaker and listener\".\n\n\"I can still remember my grandmother walking up the rocky driveway to the house when I was seven,\" says Fox. \"My heart sank. She'd come to take me away. 'She's of my blood,' she said, and I thought, 'I've always been of your blood - how come you only think of it now?'\" For many years her grandmother and father lobbed her like a shuttlecock between Hollywood, Manhattan, Queens - where, on tenement steps, she read aloud to neighbourhood children - Florida and Cuba. In Cuba, left alone on the plantation for days at a time, she absorbed the atmosphere that pervades her 1984 novel A Servant's Tale . When her parents separated in 1939, she joined Paul in New Hampshire, where he was living with Mary Gildersleeve Parkes, an heiress he would later marry. There Paula went to high school, discovered poetry, was briefly happy - but was asked to leave because of her father's drunkenness. She also spent a year at a Montreal finishing school, learning bridge and reading DH Lawrence; Sons and Lovers , she later wrote, \"calmed my turbulence, eased my restlessness and shame\".\n\nFox had wanted to be a writer from the time she was seven - \"I think it was because I knew my father was a writer\", she says now - but did not publish her first novel until she was 43. At 15 she was fending for herself, first in Manhattan, then, for about four years, in Hollywood. She helped out in a dress shop, painted ceramic baubles, taught in a dance studio and worked a drill press for Bethlehem Steel during the second world war. She read Chilean and Argentinian novels for Warner Brothers, turning every one down as not good enough.\n\nAnd she married Howard Bird, a merchant seaman and part-time actor in Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre. \"I didn't want to marry him. I didn't even like him. But I always felt I had to say yes to men. And to women also. There are all kinds of ways of tracing that back to my mother and father. But then there are other things involved, I think, like my own nature. Anyway, I felt compelled to marry him. And then he immediately went off with a girl to Palm Springs.\" She divorced him months later. A photograph from the time shows a self-absorbed girl wearing a floppy beehive and an inward smile, smoking. She's only 17, but looks older. \"Probably my experiences,\" says Fox, sighing.\n\nHer friends were labourers, actors, journalists, Communists - a radical pre-war California milieu so accurately described in her third and most autobiographical novel, The Western Coast (1972), that, novelist Frederick Busch wrote in his introduction, \"a number of intellectuals of the 1970s averted their eyes\" when it was published. Readers now might flinch more at Fox's unforgiving portrayal of a young girl adrift on what Busch has called the \"Sargasso Sea of the soul of the United States\" - though, in its worrying combination of urban anomie, of quiescence with ferocious intelligence, it has more in common with Jean Rhys's Good Morning, Midnight or After Leaving Mr Mackenzie. Annie Gianfala just lets things happen to her, watching from what seems an immense distance: sleeping with her husband, \"she fled him even as she lay there so passively\".\n\nWhen Borrowed Finery was published many were surprised to discover just how autobiographical Fox's fiction is. \"All you know is yourself,\" says Fox. \" If you know yourself. But there's something about the process of writing that refines all the elements so they don't bear the stamp of personality. They're intensely personal, but they are also extra-personal.\" She's dubious about the idea that writing can provide catharsis. \"I think probably there isn't any catharsis possible. You get a sense of order from arranging things. It's a process of growth, of wisdom and spirit. Those are big words, but ... in a sense you become a different person after you've written them. So perhaps that's catharsis - becoming different, not becoming better or worse.\"\n\nHer Hollywood period ended when she gave birth to a daughter, whom she surrendered for adoption. \"It was a terrible grief for me, a terrible loss. But I didn't see any way I could keep her, I didn't have any money. Of course I could have - we would have struggled together and it would have been better. But I saw no alternatives at the time.\" She changed her mind 10 days later. \"I just couldn't bear it. But the doctors formed a phalanx and wouldn't let me. I think they'd gotten money to place her.\" Fox was 20.\n\nDesperate to escape what she calls \"the country of my defeat\", she took a troopship to Europe in 1946. In London she modelled, read for Twentieth Century-Fox and Victor Gollancz (who had published her father), and then, as a stringer for a small British news service, reported on the reconstruction of Warsaw. A year later she was back in New York. She had a second, \"serious marriage\", to Richard Sigerson, a PR agent, which produced two sons, Adam, now an environmental consultant with two children, and Gabriel, who has worked in zoos from Philadelphia to Madagascar. When that marriage in turn ended, about eight years later, she supported herself as a teacher at private schools and at a centre for delinquents; an autodidact, she also applied to Columbia University, passing an entrance exam despite her near-total lack of formal qualifications. \"That is what I never forgave my father for. I went to high school for about three months.\"\n\nShe married Martin Greenberg, sometime editor of Commentary, a respected translator of Faust and Heinrich von Kleist and brother of the art critic Clement Greenberg, in 1962. In 1963 he won a Guggenheim fellowship, which gave Fox the support and time to write. She embarked on two novels: Maurice's Room , for children, and Poor George, for adults. Between 1966 and 1976, she published 15 books.\n\n\"Poor George\" is George Mecklin, a teacher at a Manhattan private school, restless with the privilege that surrounds him. When he apprehends a young delinquent in his home in the country, he decides to help the boy. His wife strongly disapproves. But George, caught in blind philanthropic fervour, ignores her. The first line of the novel - \"Who listens?\" - was unfortunately prophetic; it was only published in paperback three years ago, and the novelist Jonathan Lethem, who wrote the introduction, says now that \"the nearest in her work to anything that dates would be in Poor George . It's just some slight sense of there being a watershed moment in the war against conformity - and of course in retrospect the 60s look a little less revolutionary now.\"\n\nIn her children's books, Fox does not shy away from difficult subjects: homelessness, disease, disability, death; she tends to focus on children who find themselves outsiders. \"I think what my growing up gave me was that I didn't just swim like a goldfish, unaware of anything - water, my environment - I had leapt out of the bowl, so I could see in a certain way that is given to some people and not to others. I think I write mostly about children who, like me, are out of the bowl. I had the experience on the streets that I wrote about in Monkey Island [about an 11-year-old homeless boy in Manhattan], for example, and I have been in a storm at sea [ The Slave Dancer ].\" But she has also discovered that \"middle-class kids, who have parents, and things - children's rooms look like toy stores now - also have wretched lives sometimes, and it's all hidden beneath smiles and gifts. Middle-class children don't get a certain kind of spiritual life with their parents. And it's a real deprivation.\" Some find all this too much. \"I read The Slave Dancer to my nine- and 11-year-old sons,\" wrote one Californian mother in a review posted on the internet. \"I selected it because it was a Newbery award winner [the highest US award for children's authors] and I wanted to read a book about slavery. Oh my, although we did read the whole book, it was outrageous. It was too horrifying and it made my kids feel sick. I tried to explain that by being aware of the atrocities in life we can change the world and do things better. That still didn't help.\" The Slave Dancer was controversial when first published in 1973, and as recently as 1998 parents were attempting to have it removed from school reading lists because of its liberal use of derogatory terms for black people.\n\n\"Her subject matter is quite extraordinary because there is no topic she won't address,\" says Anita Silvey, editor of The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators (1995). \"She runs the gamut from Slave Dancer to more internal stories that show the devastation of a child's emotional landscape.\" But Fox is also part of a trend that began with Louise Fitzhugh's Harriet the Spy in 1962 and intensified in the climate of the Vietnam war. \"There was an extraordinary strand of realist children's fiction in the US at the time that Fox began writing,\" says Silvey. \"The children were often less than attractive, set in conditions that caused adults to cringe. So Fox was not groundbreaking, but she always had her own voice and her own vision. And she's definitely among a handful of the finest writers of contemporary and historical fiction for children.\"\n\nFox has loved writing for young people, finding it no less of a challenge than writing for adults. \"It's hard work - because all writing is. And nobody ever said in a review of my children's books that I write down - I write straight across to them. I don't try to teach.\"\n\n\"Fox's achievement,\" wrote Margaret and Michael Rustin in Narratives of Love and Loss: Studies in Modern Children's Fiction (1987), \"is to write with magnificent restraint and precision about the interplay of personal and historical, inner growth and outer framework, the process of learning to think about oneself and the world.\"\n\nFox remembers a passage from Coleridge's Notebooks her husband once read to her. \"A little boy comes home and he says, mother, mother, I gave a penny to a beggar. And she says oh, that was so good of you, and so wonderful. And Coleridge says that's the worst thing you could do to a child. You shouldn't be praised for doing what's right. You should just do it.\" Goodness, and how \"the minute you become conscious that you are doing good, that's the minute you have to stop because from then on it's wrong\", is a theme also central to her adult novels.\n\nSophie Bentwood, a middle-aged Brooklynite, puts down milk for a stray cat at the beginning of Desperate Characters (1970). \"She smiled, wondering how often, if ever before, the cat had felt a friendly human touch, and she was still smiling as the cat reared up on its hind legs, even as it struck at her with extended claws, smiling right up to the second when it sank its teeth into the back of her left hand and hung from her flesh ...\" For the rest of the weekend Sophie fears she may have contracted rabies, and the bite serves as a catalyst for the sudden implosion of the cosy world she shares with her husband Otto.\n\n\"Desperate Characters is a very acute documentary snapshot of New York City circa 1971,\" says Lethem, who grew up in Cobble Hill, where the novel is set, and attended the school that adjoins Fox's back yard. \"New York City was at a terrible, all-time low point and this neighbourhood was basically an embattled slum, with pockets of aggressive gentrification.\" The book was highly praised by critics; Irving Howe said Fox's prose was, \"sentence by lapidary sentence ... the realisation of a mind committed to the hardness of its own truth\" and placed her in the tradition of American short novels \"exemplified by Billy Budd, The Great Gatsby, Miss Lonelyhearts and Seize the Day \".\n\nIn his introduction to the 1999 reprint, Franzen went further: \"It seemed to me obviously superior to any novel by Fox's contemporaries, John Updike, Philip Roth and Saul Bellow. It seemed unarguably great.\" He stands by the judgment, he says now, \"because it's a completely achieved novel, a rigorously structured, line-by-line brilliant novel\". And many have come to share Franzen's view. \"Fox has little of Roth's self-consciousness, less of Bellow's self-importance, and none of Updike's self-pity,\" wrote Sarah Churchwell in the TLS last year. \"Unlike all three men, Fox does not jealously save the best lines for a favoured alter ego, and her protagonists do not have a monopoly on nuance. Instead, she distributes her formidable acumen unselfishly, so that even the most minor characters can suddenly offer crucial insight, and unsympathetic characters are often the most fascinating: brilliant, unfathomable and raging.\"\n\nIn 1970 Frank D Gilroy made Desperate Characters into a film starring Shirley MacLaine (\"lame\", according to David Thomson); Fox used the $35,000 she got for the rights to buy the first home she really considered her own. Unlike many other houses in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, it is not a brownstone, but a beautiful, spa cious English-style terrace house. She works at the top, in a room full of light lined with shelves of her own work in many foreign languages.\n\nWhen Fox's grandmother died, Elsie decided she shouldn't be told, as \"she wouldn't be interested\", and this throw-away cruelty was the seed for The Widow's Children (1976), which eschews the baggier picaresque of The Western Coast, returning to the tight, controlled claustrophobia of her first two novels. Laura, an ageing Spanish beauty, chooses not to tell a family gathering of her mother's death; instead she charges her editor friend Peter with the job. \"'Shall I call [her daughter] Clara?' he asks. 'No!' her voice rang out. 'Not her! She's not to know!'\" Peter loses the most important friendship of his life by going against Laura's wishes. \"I don't think Peter thought of it as an act good or bad,\" says Fox. \"He just had to do it. He knew he had to get Clara to the funeral. My mother set that off by saying I wouldn't be interested [in my grandmother's death]. But I sharpened a moral knife on that phrase and made it come out different. I think what she failed in was to be good in the way Peter was. To make me come to the funeral.\" She would not see Elsie again for nearly 40 years.\n\nThis is Fox's favourite among her novels, and her publisher told her at the time it was her best - but declined to publish it. He felt it wouldn't sell. It was turned down by another 12. A Servant's Tale, which followed in 1984, was turned down by 17 before appearing. Her last adult novel, The God of Nightmares (1990), had a slightly easier time but didn't survive. By 1992 they were all out of print (although, Fox is keen to point out, \"There were very few of them, but I never ran out of readers\").\n\nThe same has not applied to her children's books. Since 1978 she has published 12 more; they have stayed in print, their ex-cellence duly recognised, winning her the Hans Christian Andersen Medal (1978), a National Book Award (1980), Newbery Honors (1984), the Empire State Medal (1994). A new book has just been sent to the publisher. \"As a novelist, I'm conscious that your pressure on the world to recognise you matters,\" says Lethem. \"I think it's possible that her own insistence to be recognised for the adult novels slackened a bit because she was having such a fulfilling career as a children's book author.\"\n\nIn 1991, Franzen, fighting to finish his second novel, was at Yaddo, the writer's colony in upstate New York. He was looking for something to read when another writer, Sigrid Nuñez, suggested Desperate Characters. Franzen read and re-read it, taught it, pressed it on everyone he met, and then, in 1996, placed it at the centre of an essay for Harper's Magazine about the American novel. He argued that Fox's absolute insistence on seeing things straight amounted to a tragic, as opposed to a depressive realism, and that \"tragic realism has the perverse effect of making its adherents into qualified optimists\". The fact that he called Desperate Characters a classic caught the eye of Tom Bissell, then an editorial assistant at WW Norton. Bissell suggested it as a paperback reprint with an introduction by Franzen, but the editors hadn't heard of Fox and, pre- The Corrections , thought Franzen not starry enough, so had to be persuaded. Fox got no advertising and no publicity - until a glowing profile appeared in the New York Times Magazine in 2001. Suddenly she was a phenomenon.\n\nReading Fox can be gruelling. Even the novelist Zoë Heller, whose instant reaction to a mention of Fox is \"she's a great, great, great, great, great writer\", admits she can be \"crucifyingly bleak\" - though, \"bleakness done by someone really good can be transcendent. And it is with her.\"\n\nMuch of the bleakness arises from Fox's utter rejection of illusion. \"We must put a good face on it,\" says Helen's mother, the main character in The God of Nightmares (1990). \"It was her credo,\" thinks Helen. \"I detested it. It was like an order to fool yourself.\" \"We all get betrayed, in some way or another,\" Fox says now, \"even by people we love. Mostly by them.\" \"Yes. It is bleak. But it's only bleak relative to the expectations that people have. I think we're all cursed with expectations - about other people, about marriage, about ourselves - almost everything that's bad comes out of disappointed expectations.\"\n\nAsk Fox who is reading her now, and her answer is immediate: the young. \"I just think they're less delusive now than they were when I was a child, and than when the next generation were children. They don't have that American failing of false optimism.\" She is not the only one to feel so: Zadie Smith has recently written of a phenomenon first identified by David Foster Wallace, that to be young in America now, despite all grounds for optimism, is to feel a pervasive \"stomach-level sadness\". \"Among people my age - people in their early and mid-30s - there's not a serious reader I know who has not read at least one of Fox's books,\" says Bissell, \" Desperate Characters especially.\"\n\nTwelve years ago, to her immense happiness, Fox was traced by Linda, the daughter she gave up for adoption. She discovered that she had five extra grandchildren, one of whom is the rock musician and actress Courtney Love, with whom Fox does not get on. Love, for her part, was impressed to find, reading Borrowed Finery , that through Fox she was distantly related to Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nFox's adult novels, though never soft, have mellowed a bit since The Widow's Children . At the end of The God of Nightmares - \"a stealth novel with a huge left hook,\" says Franzen - Helen's absolutes are suddenly questioned and she discovers, in the words of novelist Rosellen Brown, that \"Betrayal ... [is] not as simple as she had thought, and faithfulness to someone you love [is] not necessarily to be confused with self-delusion.\"\n\nDoes this begin to point towards a way of living - not mindless stoicism, but something more knowing? \"At my 80th birthday,\" answers Fox, \"I looked around at the faces of the 22 or 23 people who were there, and except for my own three children and one grandson they were all people I've known for 50 years. And I was intoxicated with joy. I thought how far we'd all gotten, and I admired the unknowing bravery of human life.\"\n\nAt the dinner Linda told her mother a story. She had gone to see Elsie, then 92, and Elsie had given her pictures of a child saying, \"Here's Paula\". But it wasn't.\n\nPaula Fox\n\nBorn: April 22, 1923, New York.\n\nEducated: Columbia University.\n\nMarried: 1940 Howard Bird, divorced; '48 Richard Sigerson (two sons), divorced; '62 Martin Greenberg.\n\nNovels: 1967 Poor George; '70 Desperate Characters; '72 The Western Coast; '76 The Widow's Children; '84 A Servant's Tale; '90 The God of Nightmares.\n\nSome children's books: 1966 Maurice's Room; '67 A Likely Place; '68 Dear Prosper; '68 The Stone-Faced Boy; '69 The King's Falcon; '70 Blowfish Live in the Sea; '73 The Slave Dancer; '78 The Little Swineherd and Other Tales; '80 A Place Apart; '84 One-Eyed Cat; '86 The Moonlight Man; '88 The Village By the Sea; (UK title In A Place of Danger); '91 Monkey Island; '93 Western Wind; '95 The Eagle Kite (UK title The Gathering Darkness); '99 Amzat and His Brothers: Three Italian Tales.\n\nMemoir: 2001 Borrowed Finery.\n\nDesperate Characters, The Widow's Children and Borrowed Finery are published by Flamingo."
