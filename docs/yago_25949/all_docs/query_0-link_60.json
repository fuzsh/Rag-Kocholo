        "text": "About the Play:\n\nThe Only Game In Town has long been a favourite of acting teachers for Male Monologues and Female/Male Scenes.\n\nThe Only Game In Town is a full-length romantic comedy by Frank D. Gilroy. A Las Vegas dancer who is pushing thirty and facing the downside of her career is caught up in \"the only game in town\": love and marriage. She's torn between two men who both want her exclusively – a wealthy, but married businessman and a charming musician who is an inveterate gambler. A fond and humorous romance.\n\nThe Only Game In Town is about that fascinating arena of romance and broken dreams known as Las Vegas in the 1960s. The title is a perceptive comment on both gambling and love. The scene opens with a second-rate lounge piano player and a chorus-line dancer entering her apartment shortly after a chance encounter entwines the lives of a pair of Las Vegas low-rollers adrift in the world. Joe, it turns out, is a compulsive gambler just biding his time till he gets the bankroll with which he plans to make his fortune at the wheels, while Fran is embroiled in a 10-year affair with a wealthy, married businessman. While Joe is raising the $5,000 he needs to flee Vegas and she is waiting for her married suitor to come and rescue her,they both fall in love. When the businessman finally arrives and announces he has divorced his wife and wants to marry Fran, she shows him the gate; and when Joe finally raises $3600, the piano player loses it quickly only to hock his watch, start over, and amass the bundle he always knew was his.\n\nThe Only Game In Town premiered in 1968 on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York City. The play has become a favourite scene study vehicle in acting classes and workshops and has been performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles a showcase of acting talent.\n\nCast: 1 female, 2 male\n\nWhat people say:\n\n\"Has a distinguished gift for realistic drama. Mr. Gilroy can create believable characters and knows where to put in an amusing line.\" — New York Post\n\nAbout the Author:"
