        "text": "IN THE WINTER of 1991, I was a resident for a month at Yaddo, the artists’ retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. On the second floor of one of the buildings on the property was a small library, which was also where, at that time, artists in residence during the winter season took their meals. One day, I happened to see on a shelf a novel called “Desperate Characters” by Paula Fox. Though the title was new to me, the author was not. Some years earlier, I had read another book by Paula Fox, a children’s novel called “One-Eyed Cat.” Published in 1984, it had been assigned to me as part of my freelance work for an agency called Triad Artists, assessing books for possible movie deals. I loved the novel, a beautifully written story set in the mid-1930s in upstate New York, whose main character, 11-year-old Ned Wallis, is tormented by the fear that an air rifle shot he took at a shadow in the moonlight may have put out the eye of a feral cat. His guilt is compounded by the fact that his father, a Congregational Church minister, had forbidden him to use the rifle — a birthday gift from Ned’s uncle — until Ned is older. Now he lives in secret shame, unable to confess and trapped in a series of lies he tells to hide what has happened from his parents.\n\nMy enjoyment of “One-Eyed Cat” made me want to read “Desperate Characters,” Fox’s second novel for adults, published in 1970, and one in which a cat also happens to play a significant role. In this case, though, it is the cat that causes the injury by literally biting the hand that feeds it — the hand of a woman, the novel’s main character, Sophie Bentwood. This incident occurs right at the beginning of the book and, as we read on, we are kept in suspense as to how serious the bite is, whether the cat — a stray — might be rabid and why Sophie, an intelligent and educated woman, would rather deny the problem, even as her hand swells and throbs, than seek medical advice. Another source of suspense has to do with whether or not an extramarital affair she once had will come to light."
