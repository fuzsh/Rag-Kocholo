Cancellation[]

"Wiseguy" was cancelled after one additional episode (with Billy Dee Williams as a guest star) aired.

The program was never the strongest ratings draw, despite the positive feedback from critics.

The loss of Ken Wahl combined with the move to a traditionally low rated Saturday night spot depleted the ratings further and the series came to its end after 75 episodes.

Ken Wahl said that the entire fourth season concept was "ridiculous" because it got away from what the had been about, whereas before the show was more character driven, CBS wanted to make the show more of an action-based crime drama and Wahl felt that he could not continue in the role if that was where they wanted to go.
