Robert De Niro is attached to play two different mob bosses in the Warner Bros. film “Wise Guys.”

In a report by the “Hollywood Reporter,” the film is a period mobster drama that was intended for theatrical distribution that will be directed by Barry Levinson.

The project reunites De Niro and Levinson, who previously teamed on “Wag the Dog” and “Sleeper.”

“Wise Guys” follows Italian American crime bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, who ran their respective families during the 20th century. In 1957, Genovese tried (and failed) to assassinate Costello, who was ultimately injured and attempted to retire from the mafia. De Niro is expected to portray the two main characters.

De Niro would play both characters, according to sources.

“Wise Guys” is a return to a familiar genre for De Niro, who starred in “Goodfellas,” “The Godfather Part II” and “Casino.”
