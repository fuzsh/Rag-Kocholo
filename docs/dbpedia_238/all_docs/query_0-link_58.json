        "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - A Robert De Niro gangster film shot in the Cincinnati area will be released later this year.\n\nThe mobster drama, initially called \" \" but re-titled \" ,\" follows a feud between two Italian-American crime bosses in the mid-20th century. It's a style for which De Niro is famous, having starred in blockbuster films such as \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Godfather Part II.\"\n\n\"Alto Knights\" is set to be released Nov. 15 in the United States. It was originally scheduled to be released on Feb. 2, but delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\nParts of the film were shot in Warren County in December of 2022 and at Arnolds Bar & Grill in Downtown Cincinnati the following two months.\n\nThe film also stars Debra Messing, Kathrine Narducci and Cosmo Jarvis.\n\nThe movie also reunites De Niro with director Barry Levinson. The two previously worked together on “Wag the Dog,” “Sleeper,” the HBO series “The Wizard of Lies,” and “What Just Happened.”\n\n\"Goodfellas\" co-writer Nicholas Pileggi wrote the screenplay for \"Alto Knights.\""
