Take, for example, Netflix’s Escaping Twin Flames, which explores the dark side of an online community that preys on people looking for love.

You may or may not have watched MH370: The Plane That Disappeared, which delves into the unsolved mystery of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane that jetted off to Beijing in 2014 and never returned.

So, without further ado, here are the 53 best true crime shows to watch in 2024."
