        "text": "With a bleached-blond mane, a glittering blue-eyed stare and a ferocious smile, Smurf Cody (Jacki Weaver) is the mama lion to a criminal brood of armed robbers and drug dealers in the mostly terrific Australian gangster film “Animal Kingdom.” The opening images of the movie, the directorial and screenwriting debut of David Michôd, are statues and drawings of lions. Although the Codys live in bland-looking suburban Melbourne, it might as well be the jungle, for all they care about law and order.\n\nWith the exception of J Cody, the 17-year-old stray cub who narrates the story several years after the fact, the family is a clan of sociopaths engaged in a deadly war with Melbourne’s out-of-control armed-robbery squad. J (James Frecheville) is thrown into the lion’s den when he goes to live with Smurf and her three sons, Darren (Luke Ford), Craig (Sullivan Stapleton) and Pope (Ben Mendelsohn), after J’s mother dies from a heroin overdose.\n\nNumbed and expressionless in the opening scene, which shows J’s mother slumped beside him as if asleep in front of a television, J telephones his grandmother, Smurf, who hurries over to the house she hasn’t visited in years and takes him home to stay with her and her brood. Later it is revealed that Smurf and J’s mother were estranged for years after a bitter squabble over the rules of a card game."
