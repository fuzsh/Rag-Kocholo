        "text": "Are you looking for the best American Italian movies? You’re in luck. As an American living in Italy who loves great Italian movies, I will share some of the greatest Italian films and TV shows made by American and Italian filmmakers.\n\nTogether we will cover the best movies set in gorgeous Italian locations like Rome, Venice, Sicily, Tuscany, and the Amalfi Coast.\n\nIn the United States, we will explore films shot in iconic locations like New York City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Chicago.\n\nWe will discuss actors and actresses who have won numerous awards in film, such as Academy Awards and Emmys, for portraying memorable characters in these movies.\n\nIf you’re a fan of great Italian American actors like Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese, Robert de Niro, Sophia Loren, Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp, and Robert Duvall, you will love this list of my favorite American Italian movies set in Italy and the United States.\n\nGladiator\n\nThis fantastic film is one of my all-time favorites.\n\nThe brilliant Ridley Scott directs Russell Crowe who portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius.\n\nBesides being the second highest-grossing film of 2000, Gladiator was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 5, including Best Actor to Russell Crowe, and Best Picture.\n\nThe cast included Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, and, in his final role, the remarkable Oliver Reed who portrayed Julius Ceaser.\n\nHans Zimmer was also nominated for an Oscar for the original score he composed for the film.\n\nSet in the year AD 180, during the height of the Roman Empire, Gladiator is perhaps the most epic tale of revenge ever portrayed on the silver screen.\n\nWatch Gladiator on Amazon Prime here.\n\nAngels & Demons\n\nRon Howard is the brilliant director of this 2009 mystery thriller, which is the sequel to Dan Brown’s novel The Da Vinci Code.\n\nTom Hanks stars as Professor Robert Langdon who is trying to solve the case of the kidnapped cardinals who have been taken from the Vatican to a secret location in Rome, Italy by an Illuminati terrorist.\n\nThe cast includes Ewan McGregor as Father Patrick McKenna and Ayelet Zurer as Dr. Vittoria Vetra.\n\nBesides the excellent cast, Hans Zimmer wrote the score for the film. Due to its portrayal of the Catholic Church, the film was banned in certain locations.\n\nYou can watch the film on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley\n\nThis wild that this deliciously dark and twisted psychological thriller came out in 1999, more than a quarter century ago.\n\nNominated for three Academy Awards, the all-star cast includes Matt Damon, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who were all still at the beginning of their careers.\n\nThis film is set in 1950s Italy and is a dazzling feast for the eyes.\n\nThis is easily Matt Damon’s darkest role and watching the film is an emotional rollercoaster between hoping Damon’s Tom Ripley does or doesn’t get caught in his devious ways.\n\nI recently watched Netflix’s Ripley remake of this classic and it’s an even deeper dive into this dark world of murder and deception.\n\nWatch The Talented Mr. Ripley on Amazon Prime.\n\nOcean’s 12\n\nDirected by Steven Soderbergh, Ocean’s Twelve is the 2nd film in the Ocean’s trilogy and has some of the most beautiful scenes shot on location in Northern Italy.\n\nThe villa on Lake Come from the film, in the city of Laglio, is actually owned by George Clooney.\n\nThe main character of the film, Danny Ocean is portrayed by George Clooney along with an incredible cast of his real-life actor friends including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Scott Caan Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, and Casey Affleck.\n\nWatch this thrilling American film, set in both Northern and Southern Italy, on Amazon Prime.\n\nRoom With A View\n\nWhile Room With A View is technically a British film adapted from E. M. Forester’s 1908 romantic novel by the same name, Americans have considered it to be a favorite since the film’s premiere in 1985.\n\nSet in both Italy and England, this film has a cast that is truly remarkable.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Judi Dench round out one of the most talented casts ever assembled.\n\nRoom With A View was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and won 3, along with multiple British Academy Film Awards and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nIf you’ve never seen this classic film, treat yourself to it today on Prime.\n\nUnder The Tuscan Sun\n\nOf all the films on this list, Under The Tuscan Sun might just be the most iconic Italian American film since Roman Holiday.\n\nIn Diane Lane’s most famous role, she portrays author Frances Mayes, a recently divorced middle-aged woman who unexpectedly falls in love with a dilapidated Tuscan villa.\n\nIn 2023 this delightful romantic comedy-drama celebrated its 20-year anniversary.\n\nThis is one of those films you can watch again and again but it never gets old.\n\nEscape to Tuscany by watching this beautiful film today on Amazon Prime.\n\nRoman Holiday\n\nSpeaking of Roman Holiday, nothing says Italian American romance like Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on a Vespa in Rome.\n\nThis was the film that launched Audrey Hepburn into international stardom when she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her brilliant portrayal of a European princess.\n\nThe costumes and iconic Roman locations make this classic 1953 film really pop off the silver screen.\n\nIf, for some reason, you have never seen this classic Italian American movie, grab a bowl of popcorn and watch it on Amazon Prime tonight.\n\nEat, Pray, Love\n\nAlthough the only chapter of this 2010 American Italian film that’s set in Italy is the “Eat” chapter, no one makes pizza, pasta, and wine look better than Julia Roberts, as Elizabeth Gilbert, in this delightful biographical romantic drama.\n\nBased on Gilbert’s memoir of the same name, the film was not a critic’s favorite but audiences loved it.\n\nRyan Murphy was a co-writer and director of this film which turned out to be a financial success grossing over $200 million dollars worldwide.\n\nWatch it for the first or indulge again by renting or buying it on Amazon.\n\nCall Me By Your Name\n\nThis is probably the most controversial film on this list of American Italian films.\n\nA coming of age drama, set in Nothern Italy in 1983, where 17-year-old Elio Perlman falls in love with his professor father’s 24-year-old graduate student research assistant Oliver.\n\nTimothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer make the most unexpected romantic duo.\n\nNo matter how you feel about this film, one cannot deny that it is beautifully filmed, the acting is superb, and the soundtrack is sublime.\n\nSufjan Stevens wrote and performed three original songs for this stereotype-breaking movie that was shot on 35 mm film rather than the more modern digital filmmaking.\n\nWatch this award-winning film on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nThe is no more truly American Italian film than Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather.\n\nBased on Mario Puzo’s best-selling novel, published in 1969, the film premiered three years later in 1972.\n\nMarlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton are the incredible lead actors in this all-star cast.\n\nIf for some reason you have never seen what is one of the greatest films on Italian Americans culture, from the organized crime mafia world, it is absolutely worth watching.\n\nNominated for ten Academy Awards, The Godfather won three Oscars including Best Picture, and was a commercial success as, for a time, it was the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nIn case you think this classic film only focuses on the criminal underworld of Italian immigrants creating their own version of the American dream – you couldn’t be more wrong.\n\nTaking the best elements from Mario Puzo’s novel, the film focuses more on the family life of the Corleone family than the “family business”.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is one of the best Italian mafia movies of all time.\n\nThe strong performances, great screenplay, and excellent cinematography make this one of those Italian-American movies you can watch again and again.\n\nSpeaking of watching The Godfather over and over, you can do just that when you rent or buy this film, for the first time or the 100th time, on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Godfather II\n\nSpeaking of the Godfather, did you know that there are a total of 3 films in the Godfather series based on Mario Puzo’s books?\n\nThe criminal activities of the infamous Corleone family continue in The Godfather Part II.\n\nMichael Corleone is forced to a small town in the region of Sicily, Italy during the second installment of The Godfather.\n\nWhile Michael had a love story in Sicily with a beautiful young Sicilian woman who is sadly killed in a car bomb, his true love played by Diane Keaton is rekindled when he returns to the United States.\n\nThe head of the family Vito Corleone, who is the actual godfather in the story, recovered from a near-fatal shooting and is ready to turn the family business over to his son Michael.\n\nAs with the first film, the iconic original musical score for the film was composed by Nico Rota as well as some additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.\n\nUnlike many sequels that fail to live up to the original, The Godfather Part II is one of the best Italian American movies ever made, according to both critics and audiences alike.\n\nRent or buy on Amazon Prime today.\n\nBig Night\n\nAre you as much of a Stanley Tucci fan as I am?\n\nEven if you are, it’s very likely that you haven’t seen this 1996 film about two Italian immigrant brothers.\n\nThese two brothers played by Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott own a restaurant and in order to gain exposure for their restaurant they offer a night of free food.\n\nThe stellar cast includes Isabella Rossellini, Minnie Driver, Tony Shalhoub, and Allison Janney.\n\nSet in the 1950s on the Jersey Shore, this indie film has flown under the radar of many lovers of Italian American films.\n\nIt is available to rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Italian Job 1969\n\nThe genre of film referred to as “Italian crime” got a real shake-up when this “mold-breaking” film was released in 1969.\n\nMichael Caine portrays Charlie Croker, a clever ex-con who leads a team of fellow criminals to an epic heist of gold bars in the Italian city of Turin, Italy.\n\nSome consider this to be the best film of the Italian crime genre.\n\nNot only is 1960s Italy a feast for the eyes, but the soundtrack is also excellent.\n\nThe Italian Job 1969 can be rented or purchased on Amazon.\n\nThe Italian Job 2003\n\nBased on the 1969 version of the film with the same name, this one takes it to the next level.\n\nWith plenty of nods to the original, including the gold bullion that is the target of the heist, this 2003 remake is a wild ride.\n\nSet in Venice, Italy, and Los Angeles, the cast of this heist action film includes a star-studded cast with Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland, and Seth Green.\n\nCritics and audiences alike enjoyed this film and rated it one of the best films of the year.\n\nA sequel called The Brazillian Job was in production but never made it to the big screen after being canceled in 2004.\n\nThe Italian Job 2003 can be rented or purchased on Amazon.\n\nThe Untouchables\n\nDuring 1930s Prohibition era, the infamous mafia kingpin Al Capone was growing his fortune by supplying illegal liquor from the Chicago area.\n\nSean Connery, Kevin Costner, Andy García, and Charles Martin Smith, lead the cast of this 1987 classic Italian-American film.\n\nWritten by David Mamet and directed by Brian De Palma The Untouchables covers one of the most famous American Italian mafia stories of all time.\n\nNominated for four Oscars, the film took home one Academy Award for Sean Connery who won Best Supporting Actor.\n\nOne of my favorite films on our list, this mafia classic can be rented or purchased on Amazon Prime.\n\nGoodfellas\n\nGoodfellas is one of the best Italian American movies of all time.\n\nOne of Martin Scorsese’s most popular films, Goodfellas is a classic released in 1990 based on the 1985 book Wiseguy, a true story by Nicholas Pileggi.\n\nGoodfellas recounts the true story of Henry Hill and stars Italian American actors Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.\n\nThe story of the film covers the years of Henry Hill’s life from a young boy in 1955 through 1980.\n\nMany people consider Goodfellas one of the greatest films ever made, and it was nominated for six Academy Awards.\n\nIn 2000, the film was inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in the United States.\n\nGoodfellas can be rented or purchased on Amazon.\n\nCasino\n\nAnother Martin Scorsese film, Casino was released in 1995 and is set in “Sin City” Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nSharon Stone, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Don Rickles, and James Woods come together to bring this 1960s through 1980s film that was based on a true story.\n\nFor her portrayal of Ginger, Sharon Stone received a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for a non-feel-good film that recounts the epic rise and fall of a casino manager and his call-girl wife, this is the film for you!\n\nCasino can be rented or purchased on Amazon.\n\nRipley\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the original The Talented Mr. Ripley film premiered over 25 years ago.\n\nThis limited Netflix series based on the 1955 crime novel The Talented Mr. Ripley is set in 1950s Italy and feels both classic and surprisingly modern.\n\nStarring Dakota Fanning, Andrew Scott, and Jonny Flynn this is the most recently released production on this list as it debuted on the Netflix platform on April 4th, 2024.\n\nI personally just finished watching it and I loved it. This show is one of the best I’ve seen in years – Italy looks surprisingly amazing filmed in classic black and white.\n\nSteven Zaillian’s brilliantly written show will have you on the edge of your seat for each episode.\n\nI dare you to try to watch this show without binging it all in one weekend – click here to watch on Netflix now.\n\nThe White Lotus – Season 2: Sicily\n\nShows like The White Lotus by Mike White come around once in a generation – if you’re lucky.\n\nThe characters, the writing, the locations, the social commentary, the dark humor, and the actors all come together to make pure magic in this show.\n\nI fell in love with the first season of The White Lotus which was set in Maui.\n\nAs an American who lives in Italy, when I discovered that the 2nd season was going to be set on the Island of Sicily in Southern Italy, I was so excited.\n\nNot only did Mike White raise the bar with the 2nd season, but he somehow managed to maintain the same suspenseful, raw believability that he created in the first season.\n\nIf you haven’t had a chance to watch this incredible show, do it now!\n\nOne word of warning, this is not a show for children or those with prudish tendencies – if you enjoy very dark humor mixed with character-driven plots this is the show for you.\n\nYou can stream the show on HBO Max or buy the seasons on Amazon Prime.\n\nFrom Scratch\n\nNeed a good cry?\n\nThis true story about an American girl who falls in love with an Italian boy is the perfect indulgent Italian romance for you.\n\nBased on the best-selling memoir by the same name, this is a tale of true love, loss, and learning how to begin again.\n\nWhen I first started watching this show I honestly thought it wasn’t going to be for me, I felt it was a little too much like a Hallmark movie.\n\nBut as the show continued, I felt like it was a much more authentic story than I had previously thought.\n\nAvailable to stream on Netflix.\n\nMalena\n\nGrowing up in California, this was the first Italian film I ever watched.\n\nIt was also the first film I ever watched in a language other than English.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite films ever made. Following the life of a young boy in Sicily, who becomes a teenager in Musulini’s Italy during World War II, this film will steal your heart.\n\nThe boy develops a crush on Malena, a great beauty in town played by the gorgeous Monica Belucci, and he takes on the role of her secret protector as her husband goes away to war and she is left to fend for herself.\n\nAs painful as the story in this film becomes, it has a beautiful ending that restores ones faith in humanity, which is nearly lost during the middle part of the story.\n\nEven if you are not a fan of foreign language films, in my opinion, this is the best foreign language film and if you have a love for all things Italian, as I do, I believe this will become a favorite film of yours as well.\n\nYou can rent or buy Malena on Amazon Prime.\n\n​La Vita E Bella (Life Is Beautiful)\n\nRoberto Benigni is an Italian actor and director who both starred and played the lead in this heartbreaking tale of a Jewish Italian father and his son who were ripped from their beautiful life owning a bookshop in Italy and spending two years in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during WWII.\n\nBoth critics and audiences alike loved this film and it won 3 Academy Awards in 1998 including Best Actor for Roberto Benigni (the first time a non-English speaking actor) and Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nLa Vita E Bella won numerous other awards in Italy and Europe.\n\nThis is one of the best Italian films of all time.\n\nThis classic Italian film is available on Amazon Prime.\n\nDisclosure:\n\nHere at All Roads Lead To Italy, we only recommend products we would use ourselves and all opinions expressed here are our own.\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links with potential savings at no additional cost to you.\n\nIn some cases, we may earn a small commission.\n\nRead our privacy policy for full details."
