        "text": "One thing is for sure, since its announcement the movie Three Wise Men and a Baby was more anticipated than Christmas itself. The excitement of seeing Andrew, Paul and Tyler together on screen already made it iconic even before it was aired on TV. So should you watch it or not?\n\nThree Wise Men and a Baby, the plot.\n\nThis Hallmark movie is very much inspired by the 1987 hit film 3 Men and a Baby (which itself was an adaptation of the French film Three Men and a Cradle). The storyline is simple: Three brothers, still living with their mother, find themselves in charge of a baby. Baby Thomas is left at the firehouse where Luke, the eldest, who is the most responsible but also the heartthrob brother, is working. It’s Christmas so Luke decides to take the infant home, at least until his mother is found. The Brenner brothers, Stephan the anxious one who prefers animals to humans and Taylor the geeky younger one with anger issues, will have to put their differences aside and collaborate during this period. A closeness and a challenge that will inevitably bring them closer and make them realize the sacrifices of their own mother. What if they were finally able to communicate and tell each other everything they’ve been holding in their hearts for years?\n\nMy random thoughts\n\nI like to share my thoughts without structure as they come to me while watching, like on Twitter. Spoiler alert!\n\nAndrew Walker is not my type, but this opening scene is a nice gift to his fans.\n\nStephan’s anxiety clearly gives me anxiety.\n\nBarbara Facetiming her sons = My mother! Couldn’t be more realistic, I laughed so hard.\n\nAt what point did Tyler think doing squats while holding the baby was a good idea?\n\nStephan and Taylor overwhelm after one day with the baby = #RealLife.\n\nStephan and Taylor at the end of their rope and on edge throwing a fit at Luke twice in a row = Epic!\n\nUncle Luke’s ease was too good to be true. He still manages to do a lot in one morning.\n\nFiona doesn’t look like a happy person…\n\nSusie is the very definition of perseverance.\n\nThe elf scene was nothing like I imagined from all the clips and behind the scenes content. It was fast and cute but not WOW…\n\nThe three brothers’ choreography on The Nutcracker, on the other hand, is gold!\n\nI dropped a tear once in this movie, when Paul Campbell cries in the car. A beautiful, humble and accurate performance.\n\nI’m confused about the Nativity scene, I felt like it lasted 30 minutes and I was embarrassed the whole time. Even more so with the arrival of the mother who takes back her baby as quickly as she abandoned him.\n\nNot at all impressed with the speech and explanations of Thomas’ mother, Sophie. The whole story of giving birth with Luke’s help is far-fetched.\n\nThree Wise Men and a Baby, my finale opinion\n\nThree Wise Men and a Baby is different from any usual Christmas movie. The story does not focus on a predictable romance between two protagonists. It’s all about family and its complexity and more difficult topics like male sensitivity and vulnerability, mental stress, anxiety, fear of abandonment and living with your parents past 30. The men are completely lost and the female figures help them to find their way. The dynamic between the three brothers is not overplayed. And I had a hard time not believing that Andrew, Paul and Tyler aren’t actually brothers. Plus, the friendship between them is striking on screen and definitely makes this movie endearing. Taylor’s character’s sarcasm and lines are hilarious, Tyler clearly steals the show from his co-stars. Paul is excellent in his role and his character has the biggest development of the three. For once in a Christmas movie, the atmosphere is not too idyllic and one can easily put oneself in the shoes of the Brenner family. The arguments with my brother and the family diners at my house are quite similar to what I saw on screen. I found the Nativity scene a bit long, and the ending was too predictable. I would have liked to continue with something plausible. These are the only downsides for me.\n\nI loved that Margaret Colin, who played Tom Selleck’s girlfriend in the 1987 movie, was the Brenner mother. A nice touch! This production also reflects how Hallmark is a real family as all the actors from the network supported the movie’s promotion during the week. It’s very nice to see.\n\nIn conclusion, don’t miss Three Wise Men and a Baby. It will certainly make you laugh as much as it will move you. Expectations were high, but the challenge was met with flying colors!"
