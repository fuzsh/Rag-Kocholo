        "text": "Nobody could feasibly kill Robert De Niro — aside from, perhaps, Robert De Niro himself. It's fitting, then, that the Taxi Driver vet is reuniting with Goodfellas book writer Nicholas Pileggi (that coincidentally being called Wiseguy) and filmmaker Barry Levinson, dad of Euphoria's Sam, for a mob drama in which De Niro will reportedly play a duo of warring crime family figureheads in the '50s.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter describes it as “centred on Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, two Italian-American crime bosses that ran their respective families in the middle of the 20th century,” the movie is very much embedded in cut-throat truth. “In 1957, Genovese attempted to assassinate Costello but failed, although he was wounded and decided to retire, as much as one can retire from the mafia.”\n\nHere's everything else we know about Wise Guys.\n\nWho are Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?\n\nThey aren't twins, that's for sure. Unlike Tom Hardy in Legend or Armie “lemme eat yo' ass” Hammer in The Social Network, De Niro's dual parts of Genovese and Costello are not blood-related and look alike insofar as you'd expect from an ageing pair of mob bosses. Which is to say: they wear sharp suits, boast slicked-back ‘50s hair and would probably stick a horse's head in your bed if you don't pay your due respects.\n\nAccording to The Mob Museum, Costello was born in Calabria, Italy on 26 January 1891. He was an “influential mobster,” surviving a number of mob wars and Genovese's assassination attempt to “control the powerful national Commission of Mafia bosses”. He was a leading figurehead in the illegal sale of alcohol during the years of Prohibition, working with a veritable identity parade of early mob associates including Tommy Lucchese, Bill Dwyer, Dutch Schultz and Lucky Luciano.\n\nGenovese, for his part, is described by The Mob Museum as a don with “a complex legacy … ruthless, ambitious and power hungry,” partially remembered for his role in the downfall of American organised crime in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nSo why'd they go to war? Here's the deal: Genovese became head of one of New York's famous Five Families in 1936, but fled to Italy amid fears that he'd be indicted on murder charges from earlier in the decade. He stayed there until the end of the war, variously supporting Mussolini and the Allies, when he was shipped back to New York to be tried on murder charges. Two key witnesses were murdered, the case fell apart, and Genovese was acquitted — but in the meantime, Costello had become the head of the Luciano crime syndicate.\n\nIn May 1957, Genovese ordered Costello's assassination to reclaim the power he'd lost two decades prior. Fortunately for the latter, the bullet that entered his head only resulted in a superficial wound, leaving him to live another day. Nevertheless, he was pushed into an early retirement, because you just don't survive two headshots.\n\nWhen will Wise Guys be released?\n\nThere's no release date yet — don't expect this one for a couple of years."
