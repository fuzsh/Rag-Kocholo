        "text": "Date Posted: January 2, 2024\n\n2023 proved to be another great year for Northern Ireland Screen with many successes across film, TV, animation, games and interactive content. Despite the challenges brought about by the writers’ and actors’ strikes in the US the industry was kept incredibly busy. Productions continued to boost our economy and provide employment and training opportunities for hundreds of local people, while content made in Northern Ireland beamed out on big and small screens all across the globe. We round off 2023 with much to look forward to including Sky’s Christmas film The Heist Before Christmas airing on Christmas Eve and Netflix’s Lift, starring Kevin Hart, streaming from 12th January.\n\nReflecting on the past twelve months, Richard Williams Chief Executive of Northern Ireland Screen commented: “In 2023, our vibrant screen industry once again demonstrated its resilience and creativity, overcoming challenges and delivering outstanding content across film, TV, animation, games, and interactive media.\n\n“Our local talent shone bright, earning accolades, breaking records, and captivating audiences worldwide. From the historic success of An Irish Goodbye to the continued triumphs of Derry Girls, Lyra and Nothing Compares our storytellers excelled on every front.\n\n“2024 is already shaping up well with Universal’s How to Train Your Dragon getting ready to shoot and Netflix’s Lift streaming globally, as well as an exciting slate of new projects across all genres.\n\n“We remain committed to fostering new talent, supporting innovation, and ensuring that our stories continue to resonate with audiences everywhere. We are grateful for the ongoing support from of our funders, the Department for the Economy and the Department for Communities and our many partners and stakeholders. In the spirit of collaboration and creativity, we press on, united in our pursuit of making Northern Ireland a global hub for screen excellence.”\n\nLike 2022, 2023 got off to an award-winning start with Ross White and Tom Berkley following in Ken Branagh’s footsteps by picking up an Oscar.

Having also won the BAFTA and IFTA, the duo has sealed its place in history with An Irish Goodbye being the first film to do the treble.
