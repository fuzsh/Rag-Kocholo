        "text": "The Republic of Pirates\n\nBy Colin Woodard,\n\nFrom my list on pirates (fact and fiction).\n\nBy Laura Nelson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy interest in pirates began after attending the Real Pirates exhibit in Denver, Colorado, in 2011. All I can say now is that while I walked through the exhibit, I felt as though the pirates were personally speaking to me, asking me to tell the world their stories. I wrote several non-fiction articles about some of the men who sailed with Sam Bellamy on the Whydah Galley, the vessel featured in the exhibit. The writing and research were fun and fulfilling. In the last few years, I moved into fiction because I like reading fantasy myself and I wanted to explore the freedom of writing without having to document everything I wrote about.\n\nLaura's book list on pirates (fact and fiction)\n\nWhy did Laura love this book?\n\nThis was one of the first books I read as part of my research about pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nIt has a bibliography and footnotes, but it reads more like an adventure novel. You can read it for research, entertainment, or both. Everything in this book really happened. It’s one of the best starting points for someone to learn about piracy in the early 1700s.\n\nBy Colin Woodard,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked The Republic of Pirates as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn entrancing tale of piracy colored with gold, treachery and double-dealing (Portland Press Herald), Pulitzer Prize-finalist Colin Woodward's The Republic of Pirates is the historical biography of the exploits of infamous Caribbean buccaneers.\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, the Pirate Republic was home to some of the great pirate captains, including Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach, \"Black Sam\" Bellamy, and Charles Vane. Along with their fellow pirates — former sailors, indentured servants, and runaway slaves — this \"Flying Gang\" established a crude but distinctive democracy in the Bahamas, carving out their own zone of freedom in which servants were free, blacks could…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Valachi Papers\n\nBy Peter Maas,\n\nFrom my list on mob stories that tell it like it is.\n\nBy Marco Manfre Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn I heard stories about local mafia figures. Now, as the author of several books that deal with crime, I am passionate about good storytelling. I believe that a novel delving into the world of crime and criminals should be fast-paced and believable. Readers have told me that they give up on a book because, in their words: 1. “It isn’t believable” and 2. “It didn’t draw me in.” God forbid that any of the books I’ve written should fall into either of those categories! The books that I recommend are tops in the genre of The Best Mob Books That Tell It Like It Is.\n\nMarco's book list on mob stories that tell it like it is\n\nWhy did Marco love this book?\n\nThe Valachi Papers, a 1968 book written by Peter Maas, is the life story of Joe Valachi, a former member of the Genovese crime family, who testified in 1963 before a Senate committee, revealing until-then confidential information about the American mafia. The book was made into a film in 1972, starring Charles Bronson as Valachi.\n\nMaas describes in vivid detail Joe Valachi’s initiation into and rise within a mafia family, frequently relying on Valachi’s own gutsy descriptions. Although it is a biography the book has the verve and pace of a thrilling work of fiction. In many ways better than even a well-written novel, The Valachi Papers is an edge-of-your-seat reading experience.\n\nBy Peter Maas,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Valachi Papers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe First Inside Account of the Mafia\n\nIn the 1960s a disgruntled soldier in New York's Genovese Crime Family decided to spill his guts. His name was Joseph Valachi. Daring to break the Mob's code of silence for the first time, Valachi detailed the organization of organized crime from the capos, or bosses, of every Family, to the hit men who \"clipped\" rivals and turncoats. With a phenomenal memory for names, dates, addresses, phone numbers—and where the bodies were buried—Joe Valachi provided the chilling facts that led to the arrest and conviction of America's major crime figures.\n\nThe rest is…\n\nPreview\n\nBoss\n\nBy Mike Royko,\n\nFrom my list on wise guys you’ll love.\n\nBy Ray Pace Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve worked both in politics and as an investigative reporter in print and broadcasting in Chicago, Miami, Key West, San Francisco, and Honolulu. I’ve had an up-close look at how the system doesn’t work and how the wise guys get their share. I find it easy to use fiction to get to the truth.\n\nRay's book list on wise guys you’ll love\n\nWhy did Ray love this book?\n\nChicago is where I grew up watching the fascinating interplay between the so-called forces of law and order battle the criminal element. It wasn’t much of a battle unless the law-and-order guys and the crooks found themselves reaching for the same loot. Mike Royko’s book describes very well the interplay. On a personal note, I once worked for one of the Illinois governors who ran as a reform candidate. He ended up going to jail on a fraud scheme.\n\nBy Mike Royko,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Boss as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"The best book ever written about an American city, by the best journalist of his time.\"- Jimmy Breslin\n\nNew edition of the classic story of the late Richard J. Daley, politician and self-promoter extraordinaire, from his inauspicious youth on Chicago's South Side through his rapid climb to the seat of power as mayor and boss of the Democratic Party machine. A bare-all account of Daley's cardinal sins as well as his milestone achievements, this scathing work by Chicago journalist Mike Royko brings to life the most powerful political figure of his time: his laissez-faire policy toward corruption, his unique brand…\n\nPreview\n\nGet Shorty\n\nBy Elmore Leonard,\n\nFrom my list on crime about Hollywood.\n\nBy Marjorie McCown Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI've been hooked on the magic of storytelling since childhood, always eager to go wherever imagination can take me. I think that early fascination led me to become a costume designer – because costume design is about using clothing to help tell a story. I spent 27 years working on the costume design teams for films like Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Angels & Demons, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. When I decided to take what felt like a logical creative step, to write my own stories, I knew I wanted to write murder mysteries. And I thought the world behind the scenes of a movie would make the perfect setting.\n\nMarjorie's book list on crime about Hollywood\n\nWhy did Marjorie love this book?\n\nElmore Leonard knew the vagaries of the movie business back to front, and he serves them up on a platter of delicious satire in this story about an East Coast loan shark, Chili Palmer, who comes to Los Angeles chasing a deadbeat debtor and winds up in his own fractured fairy tale version of the Hollywood dream.\n\nChili’s an endearing character, street smart with a unique blend of humility and self-confidence. When his collection job throws him into company with a group of movie people, he sees them and their milieu with clear-eyed objectivity.\n\nTalking to an underworld associate, he says, “The movie business, you can do anything you want because there’s nobody in charge.” Leonard’s mastery of dialogue and character, along with his wit and sly affection for the industry he’s skewering combine to make this book a complete delight.\n\nBy Elmore Leonard,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked Get Shorty as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA thriller filled with Leonard's signatures - scathing wit, crackling dialogue, twisted plot, mad scams - and set in the drug sodden world of Hollywood.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Godfather\n\nBy Mario Puzo,\n\nFrom my list on crime dramas that keep you hooked.\n\nBy Kaeleb LD Appleby Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always loved a good crime drama/suspense thriller novel–the way they keep you glued to the pages, and you think you’ll just sit down for a quick couple of chapters before dinner, and the next thing you realize, it's 12am, and you’re on the last chapter. The depth of the character studies that you get with this genre is the other reason I enjoy it so much, there’s nothing worse than having main characters that are one dimensional and unreachable as a reader. I have always tried to create this kind of character depth and gripping narrative in my own books.\n\nKaeleb's book list on crime dramas that keep you hooked\n\nWhy did Kaeleb love this book?\n\nI really liked the way Puzo really nails the intricate plot with his straightforward writing style. He takes you through intricate events that jump around in time, keeping you hooked and on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe progression of the characters is another great bit. As a reader, you watch as Michael turns from a war hero with the potential to be a great guy into a ruthless mafia boss, almost as if it were destiny or repercussions for his father’s mistakes.\n\nBy Mario Puzo,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n11 authors picked The Godfather as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n_________________________________\n\nThe classic novel that inspired 'the greatest crime film of all time'\n\nTyrant, blackmailer, racketeer, murderer - his influence reaches every level of American society.

They’ve become part of my professional identity. I’ve taught detective (and crime) fiction at various universities in the U.S. and the Middle East. I believe the genre is incredibly rich, allowing the writer to explore anything from contemporary social issues to historical events and from psychological phenomena to philosophical problems. Apart from my academic work, I also write and edit detective/crime stories, and I try to keep up with the stream of new works being published every year. The list here contains some of my all-time favorites, and I hope you will enjoy them as much as I have.\n\nMartin's book list on novels to impress a cocktail party crowd\n\nWhy did Martin love this book?\n\nIt might not impress all the cocktail party goers, though it ought to! Brilliantly plotted, unforgettable characters, terse compelling prose, and probably the best MacGuffin of all time. I must have read this novel half a dozen times, and each time, I come away more in awe of Hammett’s flawless craftsmanship.\n\nThe book also knows its own pedigree. It is a story about a cynical modern knight searching for a medieval artifact. The world he is moving through, however, is a fallen one, and so the treasure is flawed. The damsel in distress is also not quite the maiden she makes herself out to be.\n\nBy Dashiell Hammett,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked The Maltese Falcon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOne of the greatest crime novels of the 20th century.\n\n'His name remains one of the most important and recognisable in the crime fiction genre. Hammett set the standard for much of the work that would follow' Independent\n\nSam Spade is hired by the fragrant Miss Wonderley to track down her sister, who has eloped with a louse called Floyd Thursby. But Miss Wonderley is in fact the beautiful and treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and when Spade's partner Miles Archer is shot while on Thursby's trail, Spade finds himself both hunter and hunted: can he track down the jewel-encrusted bird, a…\n\nPreview\n\nHell's Angels\n\nBy Hunter S. Thompson,\n\nWhy did Joe love this book?\n\nNothing beats an author willing to immerse himself into an outlaw world to get their perspective – until that world starts to literally beat the writer. Hunter Thompson’s first book is more of a journalistic work, examining the infamous biker gang from the inside than what would follow (Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas and so on.) He is very much part of the action at riotous parties, on bar stools, and alongside at motorcycle runs, but his first-person narration is an effective tool for revealing the Hell's Angels as independent people and as a fraternal organization. The writer and his subjects willingly project their images of unrepentant criminals. But when Thompson is on the receiving end of a gang beatdown, it’s a reminder that the line between outlaw and citizen can be hazy, and you might not know you’ve crossed it until blood’s being spilled.\n\nBy Hunter S. Thompson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Hell's Angels as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the father of 'gonzo journalism', Hunter S. Thompson's research for Hell's Angels involved more than a year of close association with the outlaws who burned a path through 1960s America, resulting in a masterpiece of underground reportage published in Penguin Modern Classics.\n\n'A phalanx of motorcycles cam roaring over the hill from the west ... the noise was like a landslide, or a wing of bombers passing over. Even knowing the Angels I couldn't quite handle what I was seeing.'\n\nHuge bikes, filthy denim and an aura of barely contained violence; the Hell's Angels could paralyse whole towns with…\n\nPreview\n\nTo Kill the Irishman\n\nBy Rick Porrello,\n\nWhy did Joe love this book?\n\nDanny Greene is a bad role model but a great protagonist. A former US Marine and union boss convicted in federal court of embezzling, he transitioned into organized crime by doing enforcement work for the Cleveland Mafia. However, he soon branches out on his own in the most brazen ways possible, incurring the wrath of his former associates. Murders, an extended bombing campaign and Greene’s work supplying intel to federal agents all culminate in a conclusion that has real consequences – the downfall of La Cosa Nostra in Cleaveland in 1977. It’s hard not to empathize with the crazy-brave Greene, standing shirtless in plain sight in front of his headquarters as the Mafia plots his death. When a criminal is this kind of character, it’s easy for a reader to lay polite society aside and immerse inside that world, enough so to root for a bad guy.\n\nBy Rick Porrello,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked To Kill the Irishman as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBe sure to see Kill the Irishman-the major motion picture based on Rick Porrello's true-crime masterpiece!\n\nA modern warrior known as Greene\n\nWas very quick and smart, and mean.\n\nHe scrambled hard and fought like hell,\n\nAnd led a charmed existence.\n\nThey shot him down and blew him up\n\nWith most regular persistence.\n\n-From The Ballad of Danny Greene Clevelan d, the 1970s:\n\nA fearless Irishman boldly muscles in on the Italian-American Mafia-intrepid, charismatic, shrewd, cunning, and armed with a master plan to take over the rackets under the auspices of the Irish banner of which he was so fiercely…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Gangs of New York\n\nBy Herbert Asbury,\n\nWhy did Mark love this book?\n\nThis work came out in the Roaring Twenties, but the gangsters of that decade had nothing on the 19th-century outfits like the Dead Rabbits and the Gas House Gang.\n\nWhen the dive bars have names like the Tub of Blood and they’re kept in business by the likes of Razor Riley, One-Lung Curran, and Stumpy Malarkey, you can’t go wrong. But to me the most compelling part was Asbury’s account of New York’s horrendous Civil War draft riots.\n\nThe Molly Maguires of Pennsylvania were born in opposition to that same draft, after a Protestant Republican allied with the coal industry used conscription to try to rid the coal fields of Irish Catholic Democrats and mine labor activists before a crucial election.\n\nBy Herbert Asbury,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Gangs of New York as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFirst published in 1928, Herbert Asbury's whirlwind tour through the low-life ofnineteenth-century New York has become an indispensible classic of urban history.\n\nFocusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens, and winding alleys of the Bowery and the notorious Five Points district, The Gangs of New York dramatically evokes the destitution and shocking violence of a turbulent era, when colorfully named criminals like Dandy John Dolan, Bill the Butcher, and Hell-Cat Maggie lurked in the shadows, and infamous gangs like the Plug Uglies, the Dead Rabbits, and the Bowery Boys ruled the streets. A rogues gallery of prostitutes, pimps, poisoners, pickpockets,…\n\nPreview\n\nDonnie Brasco\n\nBy Joseph D. Pistone,\n\nWhy did Mark love this book?\n\nIn this case, I saw the film before I read the book, and if I’m going to call myself an honest man, I’d have to say I enjoyed the film more than the book.\n\nStill, the book struck me as a great read because it embraced and portrayed the extraordinary amount of tension an undercover agent deals with 24/7. I mean, when you’re trying to make an arrest undercover, you’re two people at the same time, but you’d better not mess up and let anyone know you are or it’s game over—and very probably, bang-bang, pal, you’re history.\n\nAdd to that being undercover for the FBI and you’re guaranteed a high-stakes conundrum. Which is to say, after reading this book, how could I not have had my book’s character working undercover for what he and his partner Jonas refer to as “the Bureau”?\n\nBy Joseph D. Pistone,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked Donnie Brasco as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn 1978, the US government waged a war against organised crime. One man was left behind the lines. From 1976 until 1981, Special Agent Pistone lived undercover with the Mafia. Only able to visit his young family once every few months, Pistone - under the alias Donnie Brasco - ate, drank, partied, worked and sometimes killed with the wiseguys. He got so close that his Mafia partner, Lefty Ruggiero, asked him to officiate as best man at his wedding. Pistone's eventual testimony, in such spectacular prosecutions as 'the Pizza Connection' and 'the Mafia Commission' resulted in more than 200 indictments…\n\nPreview"
