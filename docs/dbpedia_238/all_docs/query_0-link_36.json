        "text": "Warners' first original feature of the Warner Bros. Discovery era is here … and it's a period mobster drama fronted by two Hollywood veterans.\n\nReturning to the genre that made him a household name, Robert De Niro will star in Wise Guys, a feature intended for theatrical distribution that will be directed by Barry Levinson, the filmmaker known for 1980s classic Rain Man and movies such as Wag the Dog.\n\nNicholas Pileggi, who coincidentally authored Wiseguy, the 1985 book that was the basis for the 1990 De Niro-Martin Scorsese crime classic, Goodfellas, wrote the script. Irwin Winkler, best known for producing the Rocky movies as well as being a producer on Goodfellas, is a producer.\n\nThe project is centered on Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, two Italian-American crime bosses that ran their respective families in the middle of the 20th century. In 1957, Genovese attempted to assassinate Costello but failed, although he was wounded and decided to retire, as much as one can retire from the Mafia.\n\nDe Niro would play both characters, according to sources.\n\nRobert De Niro, Barry Levinson Team for Warner Bros. Gangster Drama ‘Wise Guys’ (Exclusive)\n\nNicholas Pileggi, who authored 'Wiseguy,' the book that was the basis for the 1990 Martin Scorsese-De Niro crime classic, 'Goodfellas,' wrote the script.\n\nThis could be incredible, but I do find it funny their first movie is a movie starring Robert Deniro playing two roles directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nAlso, the title seems like it would be a Goodfellas parody in something. I know it was the original name of the book, but still.\n\nZaslav has championed Wise Guys, with its pickup initiated in late May under Warners' former Toby Emmerich regime. The project doesn't seem to have the hallmarks of a tentpole — big budgets, visual effects, big intellectual property — nor does it feel like \"young Hollywood,\" something that would seemingly attract the demographic most known for going to the movies. Instead, it feels like a throwback, and has a team whose average age is four score — De Niro is 78, Levinson is 80, and Winkler is 91.\n\nGross. Could you be any more obvious. Rich white man wants more movies with white men.\n\nJokes aside, I'll watch for sure.\n\nI still can't get over why they didn't just have a double for these scenes. And don't get me started on the de-aging.\n\nGross. Could you be any more obvious. Rich white man wants more movies with white men.\n\nHollywood in a nutshell. LOL"
