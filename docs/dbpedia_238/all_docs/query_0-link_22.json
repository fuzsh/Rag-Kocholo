        "text": "Lawrence Flynn August 23rd, 2022 - 6:37 PM\n\nRobert De Niro will be starring in the upcoming gangster drama Wise Guys and will share the screen with Robert De Niro. Wise Guys follows Italian American mafia Vito Genovese and Frank Costello. In this true story, the families during the 20th century tried to attempt an assassination on Costello, who attempted to retire from the mafia. De Niro will portray both main characters.\n\nNicholas Pileggi co-wrote for Martin Scorsese’s ‘Goodfellas‘ and had De Niro playing Jimmy Conway alongside the late Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci. But De Niro has long played in crime dramas ever since The Godfather Part II, and too long ago De Niro played in The Irishman another film produced by Scorses. And he’s planning to team up with Scorsese again for the new Apple movie Killers of the Flower Moon, but this time it’ll be a Western crime drama about the 1920 Oklahoma murders in the Osage Nation.\n\nIrwin Winkler, one of the producers for the upcoming gangster drama was also the producer of ‘Rocky‘ and ‘Goodfellas‘ will be lending his service to producer De Niro’s forthcoming film.\n\nWarner Bros has yet to set a release date for Robert De Niro’s Wise Guys."
