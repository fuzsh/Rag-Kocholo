        "text": "Sam’s debut feature explores the story of Francis Burns (Senan Jennings), a devout atheist and loner who strikes up an unconventional friendship with a mentor hiding in the nearby woods (Darrell D’Silva).\n\n“I can’t think of any other way where we can almost, quite literally, manifest out imagination. There are images in that film that I conceived four years ago when I was writing that film,” says Sam of the film, produced by Out of Orbit.\n\n“With a book, everyone can interpret it themselves. But with a film, you do have this incredible opportunity to create, literally, what was in your head, or as close to it as you can. That is incredibly exciting.\n\n“They say Hitchcock preconceived all his films, apparently. And when he was on set, he never even bothered to look through the viewfinders because he already knew what it was going to look like. I don’t think I’m quite there.\n\n“It’s amazing, but it’s also a very vulnerable making experience, because people are seeing what is in your head, what kind of flows through me, what kind of makes up my soul... [It’s] in that little film.\n\n“So, probably the scarier thing is people not necessarily just seeing the film, but I suppose seeing me through that film.”\n\nWhile many film debuts come from a place of memoir, Sam says The Wise Guy is not autobiographical but does contain elements of his childhood that become “elevated” and take “huge diversions from reality”.\n\nThough not raised as an atheist, Sam was interested in its cinematic depiction.\n\n“I never really see a film about a child who is raised as an atheist and the problems that can come with that,” he explains.\n\n“But also what I hope comes across in the film are the strengths that can come from that as well, the idea that we may be alone in the universe but there’s still so much to believe in. I hope that is something that comes through in the film.”\n\nIn recent years, film production has flourished in Northern Ireland. Sam echoes the importance of this development when saying that there was nowhere else he could have made The Wise Guy.\n\n“Northern Ireland Screen have this unique scheme here that puts faith in a debut filmmaker and lets them make a feature,” he says.\n\n“They helped me develop this film. They funded it and they supported me through it. And perhaps even more than that, they allowed me to make it, they allowed me to experiment, they allowed me to learn on the process and allowed me to fail at points as well. That’s so important.\n\n“We shot this film in three weeks, with a very small amount of money, but when we were making it, we were left alone and we could just make it. No one was looking over our shoulder and that was incredible. It felt kind of like the way I made films when I was a kid; you just got your friends and you went to the woods with a camera and you shot something.\n\n“It wasn’t just important that I made it here — this was the only place where I could have made this film. I moved over here four years ago from London. It was the best decision of my life.\n\n“I was an actor for 15 years and I was always making films in the background but I was never kind of able to find the opportunities. Then I moved here and doors just opened; people gave me a chance.\n\n“I made music videos here in the past and I always found it so incredible to make stuff here. Not only with the talent here, but there was a generosity of spirit that I just didn’t find anywhere else, and that went right through to making this film.”\n\nFrom when the film was greenlit, the crew were shooting within seven weeks. The cast of five includes Joanne Crawford (Blue Lights), Paul Mallon (Derry Girls) and Lisa Dwyer Hogg (The Fall).\n\n“To a certain extent, you write and create something that is going to be achievable, or within those circumstances. You’re not writing something with 18 cast members,” says Sam, who is based in Holywood.\n\n“I come from a theatre background and I think some of the best pieces of drama certainly have a nice small, core cast whom through you can reflect certain themes.\n\n“And, certainly, for my first film, that’s what I wanted to do — have a story that could be more controlled to a small amount of people. And, yes, certainly there was a lovely kind of sense of community with that small cast.”\n\nSam was “obsessed” with film since he was 10 and given a camcorder.\n\n“At 12 years old, I used to basically stalk film crews around Ireland,” he says, laughing.\n\n“I would turn up on set and linger around until someone gave me a job.\n\n“I ended up down in Wexford when they were making Saving Private Ryan and I got to move some buckets around one day.\n\n“In the south, there’s a year called transition year and you can basically kind of almost do what you want and I ended up working on a Neil Jordan film for a month in the props department, unpaid. But I was a dog with a bone: if I saw a film crew parked nearby, I was turning up.\n\n“On that Neil Jordan film, I had to give Maggie Smith her props. And then I stood on Maggie Smith’s foot, she screamed at me and my props career ended quite quickly.”\n\nFor those wanting to make film, Sam’s advice is to throw themselves into it.\n\n“Here, I can’t think of a better place where people will give you a shot. If you go and you ask, there are only a limited number of production companies here. There’s only one big funder here.\n\n“You can get a shot if you go there and you’re willing to work and you’ve got a good enough imagination. Honestly, people would give you a shot.\n\n“I would love to be a teenager interested in the film industry growing up here, because the opportunities would just be incredible.\n\n“You drive down to the docks and you just see these enormous sets standing out there on car parks. These are some of the biggest films in the world that have been shot 10 minutes down the road under those cranes.\n\n“You see those cranes, the symbol of Belfast, everywhere, but what happens beneath those cranes are films.”\n\n​Follow Sam on Instagram @samomahonyfilm.
