The Straight Man and Wise Guy are an inseparable Odd Couple duo who play off each other for comedy. The Straight Man approaches everything seriously (even things that are patently ludicrous) and presents a straightforward, sane, conventional point of view. The Wise Guy is a jokester who answers the Straight Man's stodgy pronouncements with puns, wisecracks, and wackiness.\n\nOftentimes, this will involve one bringing up a topic of discussion, only to have the other interrupt, correct, or otherwise play foil to him. Traditionally the Straight Man brings up a serious topic and the Wise Guy riffs on it, but sometimes the Wise Guy brings up a loony topic, the Straight Man objects to its lunacy, and the Wise Guy riffs on that. The point is for the Straight Man to \"set up\" a situation which the Wise Guy can joke about.\n\nSee also Boke and Tsukkomi Routine, where a foolish character sets up the jokes for a straight man to correct, often violently.\n\nExamples of Straight Man and Wise Guy include:\n\nAnime and Manga[]\n\nTiger and Bunny: Barnaby serves as the Straight Man to Kotetsu's Wise Guy.\n\nComic Books[]\n\nBlue Beetle and Booster Gold, although that's really more of a \"wise guy and wise guy\" duo.\n\nThis is the main focus of the comic book series Cable and Deadpool. Deadpool was a crazy, No Fourth Wall character who loved pop-culture references and extreme violence. Cable was a serious leader who barely tolerated Deadpool's antics.\n\nThe Joker invariably plays the Wise Guy to Batman's Straight Man... a psychotic, murderous, twisted genius of a Wise Guy, and an obsessive, violent, angst-ridden Straight Man. Mental health is not the strong point of the Batman oeuvre. Given that that Batman is the world's most Comically Serious, he plays the straight man to all his flamboyant Rogues Gallery, and other superheroes.\n\nExcept Alfred, who serves as a more snarky version of the wise guy to Master Bruce and is quite possibly one of the only level heads in Gotham.\n\nFilm[]\n\nAbbott and Costello, the classic American comedic duo played off of this almost exclusively.\n\nKevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob.\n\nLaurel and Hardy mixed Straight Man and Wise Guy with slapstick physical comedy. In either case, Oliver Hardy (the fat one) was the straight man.\n\nIn the Marx Brothers movies, Groucho was always the Wise Guy; whoever he was talking to (except for Chico) would be his Straight Man (or in Margaret Dumont's case, Straight Woman).\n\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost, in Spaced, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and anything else they do.\n\nLive-Action TV[]\n\nThe Andy Griffith Show: Andy Griffith and Don Knotts were like this. Andy's Andy Taylor was the straight man and Knotts' Barney was the wise guy. Although it was originally to be the other way around.\n\nDag Sinterklaasje: Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet in this Belgian series.\n\nGeorge Burns and Gracie Allen used a variant: Straight Man And The Ditz.\n\nHome Improvement: Al and Tim usually seem to pull off this dynamic in Tool Time, but they once switched roles accidentally and had Tim play the straight man when they did a cooking show.\n\nKenan and Kel\n\nMASH, which had one wise guy (mostly Alan Alda) for every straight-man (or woman).\n\nOn The Muppet Show, Statler and Waldorf unintentionally play the Wise Guy to Fozzie's Straight Man. It's the only reason that Fozzie's act is funny.\n\nAnd Kermit was the Straight Man to the rest of the cast's general zaniness, although he was often the Deadpan Snarker too.\n\nMyth Busters: Adam and Jamie.\n\nPerfect Strangers: Of course Balki and Larry deserve to be listed here, don't be ridiculous.\n\nPsych: Shawn and Gus! Or Shawn and Juliet. Or Shawn and Lasseter. Or Shawn and his dad. Or Shawn and pretty much any other character.\n\nSupernatural: In the early seasons, Sam often played straight man to Dean's wise guy. This happened less and less often as the show fleshed out their relationship.\n\nThe Vicar of Dibley: Geraldine Granger (or sometimes David Horton) and everyone else.\n\nNewspaper Comics[]\n\nHoward and Nester formed a Straight Man and Wise Guy duo in the long running Nintendo Power strip, with the difference being that Howard never physically \"corrected\" Nester - the environment (or an enemy nearby) corrected Nester for him.\n\nPodcasts[]\n\nNitro Game Injection: KyleJCrb is the Straight Man to Liontamer's Wise Guy on the video game music podcast.\n\nRadio[]\n\nMike & Mike in the Morning: Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic on ESPN Radio's show.\n\nRecorded and Stand Up Comedy[]\n\nJerry Lewis and Dean Martin\n\nJon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, which overlaps with the outdated Vaudeville act of An Irishman And A Jew.\n\nThe Kids in The Hall: Parodied in a sketch where the Straight Man ruined the joke every time by laboriously explaining why it's funny.\n\nMel Brooks and Carl Reiner, especially in their legendary \"2,000 year old man\" routine, which involved a news reporter (Reiner, the straight man) interviewing a Jewish fellow who happened to be 2,000 years old (Brooks, the wise guy.) This routine was actually created on the fly; the two spontaneously came up with it at a party.\n\nMorecambe (Wise guy) and Wise (Straight man)\n\nMorecambe and Wise are often cited as a subversion of this in their later (and funniest) years -- one description was \"Ernie Wise is a wise guy who isn't funny, Eric Morecambe is a straight man who is\".\n\nPenny Arcade: Tycho and Gabe.\n\nRowan and Martin also used this in a straightforward way. Dan Rowan was the straight man; Dick Martin, the Wise Guy.\n\nTheatre[]\n\nThe Merchant of Venice: Lorenzo (Straight Man) and Launcelot (Wise Guy).\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nDragon Age: Origins: Everyone and everyone else at various points. That the entire cast is composed of sarcastic people doesn't help. The Warden and Alistair is probably the most notable example.\n\nAwakening adds Velanna and Nathaniel.\n\nDragon Age 2 gives us Merrill or Anders as the Straight Man when placed opposite Silly!Hawke.\n\nFire Emblem: Most of the games have at least one pair:\n\nMystery of the Emblem: Julian and Ricardo\n\nGenealogy of the Holy War: Jamke and Dew\n\nThe Blazing Sword: Kent and Sain, Dorcas and Bartre\n\nThe Sacred Stones: Kyle and Forde\n\nAwakening: Frederick and Henry in their supports\n\nFates: At least half the retainer duos are this, but especially Niles and Odin\n\nThree Houses: Dimitri and Edelgard are the straight man and woman to Claude's wise guy\n\nFelix and Ingrid are the straight man and woman to Sylvain's wise guy\n\nSubverted with Alois, whose supports with serious people have him behaving in a serious manner...except for Dimitri, who laughs heartily at his awful jokes.\n\nWeb Comics[]\n\nDubious Company: Walter is the 'Costello' to Tiren's 'Abbott'. Also occasionally, Mary and Leeroy are the wise guys to Sue and Sal respectively.\n\nMegatokyo: Piro and Largo, initially.\n\nWeb Original[]\n\nThalias Musings: Apollo often ends up playing the Straight Man to Thalia's Wise Guy.\n\nThough, strictly speaking, he's not a straight man.\n\nWestern Animation[]\n\nThe Amazing Chan and The Chan Clan: Brothers Henry and Stanley (though Henry is often a Deadpan Snarker and gets some funny lines).\n\nFamily Guy: Brian and Stewie. Also happens with Brian and Peter, but not as often.\n\nPinky and The Brain, with Pinky as the Wise Guy and The Brain as the Straight Man.\n\nThe Simpsons: Early Lisa and Bart was a classic Straight Man And Wise Guy pair, especially when they investigated mysteries together. Usually, Lisa would compare the situation to some historic moment or classical literature, and Bart would make a joke about it.\n\nVoltron: Legendary Defender: Keith is the straight man to Lance's wise guy. When they're not arguing.\n\nWallace and Gromit, notable in that the Straight Man (Gromit) is completely mute and only expresses himself through pantomime. Their exchanges are usually along the lines of:"
