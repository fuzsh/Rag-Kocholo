        "text": "Nothing gets the juices flowing quite like crime, eh? A heist, some weapons trafficking, maybe a little arson?\n\nThe problem is the consequences. The court appearances, the jail time, the change in one's relationships with family and friends. Sometimes it's just not worth it. That's where crime TV shows come in: You get all the thrills of crime without the negative personal ramifications!\n\nNetflix has a whole bunch of crime shows just waiting to be dug into, from court-focused miniseries to investigation procedurals to action-packed spotlights on criminal activities. Netflix being Netflix, there are quite a few shows to sift through, and some you might miss on a cursory search, so we compiled the best for you.\n\n1. Better Call Saul\n\nBoth a prequel and a sequel to Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul is a fantastic crime and legal drama that stands on its own two feet. Bob Odenkirk is Jimmy McGill, a con man trying to make good who ends up becoming a legitimate and bombastic criminal lawyer. It is a simmering, dark, and comedic character study that gets its hooks into you early on. With a fantastic cast, including the always-excellent Giancarlo Esposito, Better Call Saul evolves in unexpected directions as its seasons unfold. If you haven’t seen it yet, you’re in for a ride! — Kristina Grosspietsch, Freelance Contributor\n\nHow to Watch: Better Call Saul is streaming on Netflix.\n\n2. Wednesday\n\nCredit: Netflix\n\nOne part mystery, one part supernatural show, and one part teen drama, Wednesday was an undeniable 2022 breakout hit. The internet was abuzz with star Jenna Ortega’s take on the classic Addams family character, and it’s no wonder — Wednesday is a delight!\n\nAfter getting kicked out of yet another high school, Wednesday is sent by her parents (Luis Guzmán and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both having a ball as Gomez and Morticia Addams) to their old alma mater, Nevermore Academy. There, Wednesday meets werewolves, gorgons, and impossibly broody teens — and finds herself at the center of a complex murder mystery that threatens to engulf the school in scandal. It’s soapy, supernatural teen fun peppered with fantastic characters and plot twists to spare. — K.G.\n\nHow to Watch: Wednesday is streaming on Netflix.\n\n3. Lupin\n\nCésar-award-winning actor Omar Sy is absolutely magnetic in this fun and unpredictable French mystery series. Assane Diop is the son of a Senegalese immigrant who was convicted of stealing his Parisian employer’s diamond necklace. All Assane has left of his dad is a shared love of Arsène Lupin, a classic French literary character who is both a gentleman and a thief. As an adult, Assane follows in Arsène Lupin’s fictional footsteps and becomes master thief, determined to use his skills to prove his father was innocent all those years ago.\n\nNo matter what language you speak, Lupin is a 10-out-of-10 show. It’s an energetic, poignant, gripping, and joyful watch, all wrapped into one. — K.G.\n\nHow to Watch: Lupin is streaming on Netflix.\n\n4. Bodyguard\n\nIn the tense British drama Bodyguard, a former Army veteran with PTSD takes on the role of principal protection officer for the UK's Home Secretary.\n\nIf you think actor Richard Madden looks familiar in this show, it's probably because you last saw him getting pasted into oblivion at everyone's least favourite Game of Thrones wedding. Poor old Madden doesn't have a much easier time of it in Bodyguard — although we'd be lying if we said his struggles don't make for some addictive viewing. Jed Mercurio's pacey series is everything you'd expect from a police thriller, with twists, tension, and explosions aplenty. But what makes it even better is how well-drawn the characters are.* — Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor\n\nHow to Watch: Bodyguard is streaming on Netflix.\n\n5. Money Heist\n\nWe’ve got ourselves a heist, people! This complex Spanish drama (La Casa de Papel) is a suspenseful, winding puzzle that unfolds in real time. It all starts when a mysterious man called “The Professor” recruits eight anonymous individuals to help carry out a massive heist on the Bank of Spain.\n\nMoney Heist subverts the well-worn heist genre with style. Its characters are flawed and three-dimensional, its conflicts are earned, and it’s super entertaining. This show is so popular, a South Korean adaptation has already been released, a spin-off is in the works at Netflix, and multiple real-life robbers have attempted to copy the heist plans from the show! Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, folks! — K.G.\n\nHow to Watch: Money Heist is streaming on Netflix.\n\n6. Blacklist\n\nJames Spader is hypnotic as Raymond \"Red\" Reddington, a notorious criminal who turns himself in, offering to provide information on his “blacklist” of fellow ne'er-do-wells in exchange for immunity. The only catch? He refuses to work with anyone but a rookie FBI agent, Elizabeth Keen, who has no clue why she’s been requested for the job. This is a high-quality network drama, with twists you don’t see coming and a deep mythology — perfect when you’re jonesing for a binge. — K.G.\n\nHow to Watch: Blacklist is streaming on Netflix.\n\n7. Alias Grace\n\nCredit: Sabrina Lantos / Netflix\n\nBased on celebrated author Margaret Atwood’s novel of the same name, Alias Grace is an engrossing psychological mystery. A fictionalized telling of a real-life 1843 murder, the mini-series investigates the sanity and guilt of convicted murderess Grace Marks (Sarah Gadon), who has been imprisoned for 15 years but has no memory of the incident. Psychiatrist Dr. Simon evaluates Grace and becomes more connected to his subject the more he learns about her past.\n\nWritten by Sarah Polley (Women Talking) and directed by Mary Harron (American Psycho), this 2017 adaptation honors its source material with aplomb. The cast, which includes Anna Paquin, sparkles, and the tension is palpable. An addicting and eviscerating watch! — K.G.\n\nHow to Watch: Alias Grace is streaming on Netflix.\n\n8. Murderville\n\nCredit: Netflix\n\nMurderville is not so much a parody as it is a work of cleverly experimental comedy that toys with our mystery-solving expectations by layering in the spontaneity of improvisation. With Will Arnett's steady hand guiding every episode and the energy shifts each new clueless celebrity guest brings, Murderville carefully splits its time between challenging viewers to follow the clues and leaving them breathless with anticipation and laughter as they watch to see which talented performer breaks character next.* — Adam Rosenberg, Senior Reporter\n\nHow to Watch: Murderville is streaming on Netflix.\n\n9. The Watcher\n\nCredit: Eric Liebowitz / Netflix\n\nWhen Nora and Dean Brannock move their family into their dream home, they feel like everything in their lives is starting to fall into place. That’s when the first of the mysterious and unnerving messages from a stalker named “The Watcher” arrives.\n\nThe cast for Ryan Murphy’s campy horror The Watcher — based on a true crime! — is unbelievably stacked: Jennifer Coolidge (!!!), Naomi Watts, Bobby Cannavale, Margo Martindale, Richard Kind, Mia Farrow, Christopher McDonald, Noma Dumezweni, and more. That list alone should be enough to bring you on board! — K.G.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nHow to Watch: The Watcher is streaming on Netflix.\n\n10. Collateral\n\nA routine investigation into the murder of a London pizza delivery man leads to the discovery of a massive conspiracy that puts everyone at risk. Carey Mulligan is fantastic as the dogged Detective Inspector Kip Glaspie, unwilling to accept this killing as a random act of violence. Thanks to an airtight script and a few top-notch English actors (Billie Piper and John Simms), Collateral is a breathless, addicting mystery as well as a thoughtful meditation on modern Britain. — K.G.\n\nHow to Watch: Collateral is streaming on Netflix.\n\n11. American Vandal\n\nThe conspiracies flow as suspects are targeted and investigated in \"American Vandal.\" Credit: Scott Patrick Green / Netflix\n\nThis mockumentary-style comedy series is set in a high school where two heinous crimes have taken place. In the first season, someone spray paints dicks on a bunch of cars in the parking lot. In the second season, someone tampers with the cafeteria offerings, making dozens of students lose control of their bowels. Shot through the lens of a few high schoolers trying to document their search for the truth, both season are hilarious as the mysteries unravel and we learn more about these high schoolers, their relationships, and their proclivity for hijinks. — Kellen Beck, Entertainment Reporter\n\nWhere to watch: American Vandal is streaming on Netflix.\n\n12. Breaking Bad\n\nWalter White (Bryan Cranston) learns how to be a pretty great criminal. Credit: Ursula Coyote / AMC\n\nBreaking Bad takes one guy involved with one specific topic, methamphetamines, and covers it from pretty much every possible angle imaginable. The series stars Bryan Cranston as mild-mannered chemistry teacher Walter White, who turns to producing and selling meth to cover the cost of his cancer treatments and make sure his family will be financially stable no matter what. Things spiral out of control continuously for several seasons as the DEA (including his brother-in-law) hunts him, and Walter's hunger for power drives him to mingle with increasingly dangerous dealers, cartels, and gangs. The setting of New Mexico, the writing, the photography, and the entire cast is excellent. The spin-off, Better Call Saul, which is a bit less crime-y, is equally as entertaining (if not a little more so), and is also mentioned in this list. — K.B.\n\nWhere to watch: Breaking Bad is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n13. Death Note\n\nThings are very, very dark in the world of \"Death Note.\" Credit: Viz media\n\nDeath Note, based on the manga of the same name, is a fantastic anime series that blends the supernatural with psychological thrills and mystery. Light Yagami, a young genius, finds a book called the \"Death Note,\" to which a shinigami (demon) named Ryuk is attached. The Death Note allows whoever uses it to kill anyone by writing their name down in it, and Light gets to work killing lots of people he deems bad, setting off a manhunt led by a detective known as L to track him and stop him. It's weird, dark, sometimes goofy, and full of suspense and moral quandary. (There's also a live-action movie on Netflix, which is pretty bad. Stick to the anime.) — K.B.\n\nWhere to watch: Death Note is streaming on Netflix.\n\n14. When They See Us\n\nWrongly accused. Credit: Atsushi Nishijima / Netflix\n\nThe most culturally significant project Netflix released in 2019, Ava DuVernay's When They See Us revisits the case of the Central Park Five in excruciating detail. Examining the wrongful convictions of five Black and Latino men — Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise — for rape in 1989 (for which they would be exonerated over a decade later) this poignant true-crime miniseries offers a heart-wrenching look at the ongoing flaws in our justice system. A powerful watch, When They See Us highlights the insidious biases that plague our society and the vulnerable people put at risk.* — Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: When They See Us is streaming on Netflix.\n\n15. Good Girls\n\nTwo of the electric good girls from \"Good Girls.\" Credit: Jordin Althaus / NBC\n\nThree of your TV faves — Christina Hendricks of Mad Men, Retta of Parks and Recreation, and Mae Whitman of Arrested Development — star as a trio of suburban moms who stick up a grocery store to pay some bills. Unsurprisingly to anyone who’s ever seen a crime drama before, they quickly discover they’ve gotten in way over their heads. Equal parts thrilling and funny, with unexpected touches of emotion and cast chemistry you want to live in, Good Girls is a great time. — Angie Han, Deputy Entertainment Reporter\n\nWhere to watch: Good Girls is streaming on Netflix.\n\n16. Top Boy\n\nBritain's answer to \"The Wire\"? Credit: Netflix\n\nCreated by Ronan Bennett, Top Boy first aired in the UK from 2011 to 2013, originally set in the fictional Summerhouse public housing estate in East London, and featuring drug dealers Dushane and Sully (Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson). Drake revived the show for Netflix alongside Adel Nur, Maverick Carter, and Jamal Henderson in 2019, with Walters and Robinson returning to their roles, and Lover's Rock star Micheal Ward joining as new gang leader Jamie.\n\nThis meaty drama, which has been compared to HBO’s The Wire, is startlingly grounded, anchored by a young, talented cast that radiates with vulnerability. This is television at its best.* — K.G.\n\nHow to watch: Top Boy is streaming on Netflix.\n\n17. How to Get Away with Murder\n\nThe drama never stops compounding in \"How to Get Away with Murder.\" Credit: Byron Cohen / ABC\n\nHow to Get Away with Murder is a show of complicated storylines and simple pleasures. The premise, which centers on a law professor and five students who get tangled up in a high-profile murder case, lends itself to one dizzying twist after another. But you can reliably count on the series for increasingly ridiculous plot twists, a knowingly campy tone, a super-sexy cast, and above all, a powerhouse performance by Viola Davis that elevates it into something truly special. Just be warned: You will try to binge the whole first season in one sitting. — A.H.\n\nWhere to watch: How to Get Away with Murder is streaming on Netflix.\n\n18. Mindhunter\n\nGetting in the heads of some of the most heinous killers in modern history. Credit: Netflix\n\nBased on true accounts of the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit, a now-defunct department of the ‘70s credited with establishing many modern criminal profiling tactics, Mindhunter offers a terrifying meditation on violent crime. Although much of the series is structured around the hunt for Dennis Rader (aka \"BTK\"), Mindhunter isn’t a police procedural in the true sense. Instead, it takes its viewers on a terrifying meet-and-greet with some of the most prolific serial killers of the 20th century, and asks why they did what they did. It’s a tremendously dark watch, but offers a nuanced portrait of criminologist history worth a watch for any true crime fan. — Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: Mindhunter is streaming on Netflix.\n\n19. Narcos\n\nThe hunt for some of the biggest players in drug trafficking in \"Narcos\" is intense. Credit: Juan Pablo Gutierrez / Netflix\n\nWhether you caught this Netflix staple in its heyday or are circling back after getting into its successor, Narcos: Mexico, you’re definitely making a solid crime show choice with Narcos. Better and better across its three seasons, this look at the life of drug lord Pablo Escobar (played by Wagner Moura, who earned two Golden Globe nominations for his performance), is deeply unnerving and tremendously dark. Still, its consistently excellent pacing and high production value make it more than a slog through underworld horror, instead offering a warped but resonant portrait of power. — A.F.\n\nHow to watch: Narcos is streaming on Netflix.\n\n20. Ozark\n\nThe Byrdes really get into some stuff in \"Ozark.\" Credit: Netflix\n\nAs Tolstoy wrote, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. But in Ozark? The Byrdes get screwed in a uniquely shitty fashion. In this spiritual successor to Breaking Bad, executive producer and director Jason Bateman stars as Marty, a mild-mannered money launderer who accidentally sticks his family in the crosshairs of a Mexican drug cartel. Across four seasons, we watch as Marty, his wife Wendy (Laura Linney), and their two kids (Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaertner) grapple with life and death consequences against the ominous backdrop of the Ozarks. This one is just truly great TV, with supporting performances to die for. — A.F.\n\nHow to watch: Ozark is streaming on Netflix.\n\n21. Peaky Blinders\n\nThe best break from the cutthroat streets is a boozey one. Credit: BBC\n\nPeaky Blinders is a superbly gripping British crime drama that’s loosely based off of real people and historical events. The series, created by Steven Knight, is set in post-World War I Birmingham, England, and follows war hero Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) who’s taken his place as boss of the family and crafty gang leader. Viewers are masterfully transported to the gritty 1920s streets, where Tommy struggles to manage his family’s business, crimes, and enemies — all while dealing with severe PTSD.\n\nThe show is ripe with seduction, love, loss, mismanaged emotions, booze, guns, violence, and wits. It delivers twists and turns that are sure to shock even the most attentive viewers, and it features a stacked cast (including Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, and Tom Hardy). The costume design is fiercely impressive, and in case you’re not hooked yet, it also has a killer soundtrack full of PJ Harvey, The White Stripes, Radiohead, and Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds. — Nicole Gallucci, Culture Reporter\n\nWhere to watch: Peaky Blinders is streaming on Netflix.\n\n22. The Sinner\n\nCredit: Netflix\n\nSaying there are a lot of crime shows out there in a roundup of crime shows feels like stating the obvious, but it does sometimes feel like a genre that's become oversaturated. As Mashable's Jess Joho wrote in her review of Season 2, though, \"The Sinner is one of the few crime series more interested in innocence than in guilt. It's exactly what makes it feel so compelling and fresh.\"\n\nThe anthology show focuses on a different case each season, with troubled Detective Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) investigating scenarios where unexpected people have seemingly committed terrible crimes. Although I'd argue the earlier seasons are the strongest, The Sinner never pulls any punches and always places its well-drawn characters at the centre. — Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor\n\nWhere to watch: The Sinner is streaming on Netflix.\n\n23. Riverdale\n\n\"Riverdale\" is, frankly, wack. Credit: Warner Bros.\n\nIs it weird that a TV series based on the generally saccharine Archie Comics is actually about murder, sex, and drugs? Yes. Is any of that weirdness remotely bad in Riverdale? No. Not at all. Riverdale kicks off with the mysterious death of Jason Blossom and blooms further into a smart, unabashedly bonkers CW classic that isn’t afraid to get messy. From the occasional musical number to the Gargoyle King enthralling legions of children with hallucinogenic Pixy Stix, Riverdale makes good on its most iconic line: No one’s innocent in crime town. — Alexis Nedd, Senior Entertainment Reporter\n\nWhere to watch: Riverdale is streaming on Netflix.\n\n24. Sacred Games\n\nSartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan) pursues a ruthless criminal in \"Sacred Games\" Season 1. Credit: Netflix\n\nAdapted from Vikram Chandra’s 2006 novel, Sacred Games centers on the underworld of Mumbai and one notorious gangster: Ganesh Gaitonde (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Gaitonde sends a missive to police officer Sartaj Singh (Said Ali Khan) with a 25-day ultimatum for saving his city from catastrophe. It is a show that could have buckled completely with subpar casting, but Siddiqui’s performance is indelible from start to finish. Gaitonde’s every look, movement, and spitting curse word create a dynamic anchor for this sinister tale as it unravels... even if Season 1 is way better than Season 2. — Proma Khosla, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: Sacred Games is streaming on Netflix.\n\n25. Unbelievable\n\nKaitlyn Dever in \"Unbelievable.\" Credit: Beth Dubber / Netflix\n\nUnbelievable is absolutely one of the best shows of 2019, because it's a thoughtful crime miniseries that focuses on the victims, not the perpetrators. Thanks to Kaitlyn Dever's memorable, heartbreaking performance, viewers never forget the very real people behind the horrific headlines. In this based-on-a-true-story adaptation, a man breaks into a teen's home and rapes her, but doesn't leave any evidence, and the police doubt her story... until similar crimes start happening all over, and two tenacious detectives (Toni Collette and Marritt Weaver) join forces to finally bring these women justice. — Erin Strecker, Entertainment Editor\n\nHow to watch: Unbelievable is streaming on Netflix.\n\n*This blurb appeared on a previous Mashable list.\n\nUPDATE: Mar. 3, 2023, 3:49 p.m. EST This article has been updated to reflect Netflix's current selection."
