        "text": "When you hear the word ‚Äútough,‚Äù what comes to mind? Physical prowess and strength? Strength of character and mental fortitude? Or something else? Whatever it may be, toughness in a movie character has one characteristic that stands out above all else: you know it when you see it. It‚Äôs in the way a person carries themselves, or, in this instance, the way a character is framed, how a score is composed around them, and how they jump right in to face seemingly insurmountable odds without hesitation.\n\nüéû Let‚Äôs geek out over our favorite movies together, join Pop Mech Pro!\n\nWhether it be a total lack of fear, the assistance of superpowers, or an extremely fine-tuned set of skills, the characters on this list are some of the biggest badasses we‚Äôve ever seen. From animated movies, to sci-fi thrillers, to films inspired by real events and people, these are the toughest movie characters of all time.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Some entries contain major spoilers.\n\nJohn Gilpatrick is a freelance writer and film critic from the Lehigh Valley, PA. He loves movies about space and movies about oil drillers (especially when they go together). He also thinks the Star Wars prequels are mostly OK and that Ivan Reitman's Draft Day is a low-key masterpiece. He is a member of the Online Film Critics Society (OFCS).
