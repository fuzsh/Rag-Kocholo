        "text": "We don’t typically cover comedy specials here at The Playlist. That isn’t because we don’t enjoy them, but there are just so many, it’s difficult to keep up. But one way to ensure that we’ll pay attention to a specific comedy special is to get Josh Safdie to direct it.\n\nREAD MORE: Timothée Chalamet To Star In Josh Safdie’s Ping-Pong Movie ‘Marty Supreme’\n\nAs seen in the trailer for Adam Sandler’s new comedy special, “Love You,” the comedian is back to doing his stand-up routine, and he’s gotten one of the Safdie Brothers to direct. You can also tell that there is a lot of Safdie influence on the special, as it isn’t Sandler telling jokes in some sort of well-lit, packed arena. There is some artistry on display.\n\nUnfortunately, as excited as we are to see Josh Safdie direct Adam Sandler’s comedy special, it doesn’t make up for the fact that the film the duo were supposed to be working on was completely derailed by the SAG and WGA strikes. So, instead of getting a new Josh Safdie drama, we’re having to settle for a comedy special. You can’t help but feel a bit let down.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Happy Gilmore’ Sequel In Development At Netflix\n\nAll that said, who doesn’t like a funny comedy special? If you are somehow upset that Adam Sandler is releasing a comedy special directed by an award-winning filmmaker, then you are probably a miserable human. It’s ok to laugh.\n\n“Adam Sandler: Love You” is set to arrive on Netflix on August 27. You can watch the trailer below:"
