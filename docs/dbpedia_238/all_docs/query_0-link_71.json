        "text": "Johnathon SchaechSheriff Justin Wise\n\nJohnathon Schaech exploded onto the scene as one of Hollywood’s most handsome leading men in Jocelyn Moorhouse’s HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT and Tom Hanks’ directorial debut THAT THING YOU DO! Over the last twenty-five years, he’s starred in more than 160 Hollywood productions, working opposite some of the most acclaimed and awarded actors, producers, writers, and directors, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Kenneth Branagh, Ed Harris, Idris Elba, Antonio Banderas, Tom Fontana, Gary Goetzman, Greg Araki, Cary Brokaw, Roy Lee, Jessica Lange, and Bill Paxton. Schaech captivated television audiences as an eccentric movie-star in Showtime’s hit series RAY DONOVAN and has portrayed comic-book legend ‘Jonah Hex’ on the first four seasons of DC’S LEGENDS OF TOMORROW.\n\nSarah LancasterElli Wise\n\nBorn in Overland Park, Kansas, Sarah moved to Mission Viejo, California, when she was 10 years old. In 1994, she secured her first role, as a series regular on Saved by the Bell: The New Class (1993). She then gained attention for her recurring role as “Madison Kellner” on the critically-acclaimed Warner Bros. series, Everwood (2002). She went on to star in Dr. Vegas (2004), for CBS from 2004-2006. Followed by ABC’s What About Brian (2006), from 2006-2007. Sarah is perhaps best known for her lovable portrayal of “Ellie Bartowski” on NBC’s long-running series, Chuck (2007).\n\nTom ProctorJeremiah Wade\n\nTom’s ability to deliver a powerful performance is not affected, but rather drawn from his real life experience. He grew up in the remote, unpopulated canyons of the Rocky Mountains doing things most of us only see in movies, like riding horses, breaking wild mustangs, driving cattle and training wild animals. He became a sponsored motorcycle racer and a world champion MMA fighter. He traveled the world in the occupation of bodyguard and “executive protection”. But Tom’s life-long dream was always set on becoming a filmmaker, and he made that dream come true and he figured out how to bridge the gap between reality and film by seeing the world through a camera lens: as grip, gaffer, camera operator, second unit director, director of photography, producer and director. His physical power, strength, agility and coordination are legendary, and his stunt resume impressive. His commitment to acting training led Tom to immerse himself in classes, workshops, private coaching, linguistics, improvisation, comedy, and Meisner techniques."
