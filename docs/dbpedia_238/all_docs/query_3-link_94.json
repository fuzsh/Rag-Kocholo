A good logline will always have these 4 elements (not necessarily in the same order as given below):[protagonist] + [inciting incident] + [protagonist‚Äôs goal] + [central conflict]\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a logline from the movie Silence of the Lambs , starring Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster: ‚ÄúA young F.B.I. cadet must confide in an incarcerated and manipulative killer to receive his help on catching another serial killer who skins his victims.‚Äù\n\nüí° Pro-Tip: Study other people‚Äôs loglines for inspiration to strike, and to understand how to write one!\n\nüí° Pro-Tip: To give your movie idea a complete look, it is important to build a backstory. A backstory is a method to fill gaps in the story and give characters in your movie depth.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a backstory: Lord Voldemort is a character from the Harry Potter franchise. He is one of the darkest wizards in the wizarding world- even wizards and witches did not dare speak his name. By piecing together flashbacks and memories, we understood the reason behind why Lord Voldemort was after Harry Potter."
