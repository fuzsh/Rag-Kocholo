        "text": "Friday 9 August\n\nOlympics: Paris 2024\n\nBBC One & Two & Eurosport, all day\n\nThe final lap approaches, which means we’re at the business end of plenty of events today. Headlining for Britain will be Katarina Johnson-Thompson, beginning the final day of the heptathlon with the long jump from 9.05am. Can she finally bag a medal at the fourth time of asking, or will Belgium’s Nafi Thiam complete an unprecedented treble? Britain may also be in with a chance of a medal in the men’s and women’s 4x100 m relay finals from 6.30pm, with the women in especially encouraging form. In the hurdles, the peerless Karsten Warholm should also be worth a look as he goes for a second gold and another world record in the 400 m at 8.45pm.\n\nAway from the track, the men’s football final at 5pm could see Thierry Henry coaching Les Bleus to a home victory, Britain’s Hector Pardoe could pick up an early-morning medal in the marathon swimming at 6.30am, the women’s hockey concludes at 7pm and a succession of boxing finals begin at 8.30pm. At 3pm, however, comes the only new sport of the Paris Olympics: breaking, in which 16 B-Girls will square off in head-to-head battles of eye-(and body-)popping physicality, musicality and invention. GT\n\nAndrew Tate: Icon or Toxic? A Faking It Special\n\nDiscovery+\n\nAn hour and a half devoted to the internet’s foremost misogynist may be hard to stomach for many, but this in-depth investigation pledges to examine the grim hold that Tate possesses over so many young men, as well as the charges he faces of tax evasion, rape and human trafficking.\n\nGardeners’ World\n\nBBC Two, 8pm\n\nSloping gardens, homegrown vegetables, green roofing and test-bed planters are on the agenda for Adam Frost, Joe Swift and Arit Anderson tonight as the temperature continues to rise outside.\n\nA Kanneh-Mason Playlist at the Proms\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nCellist Sheku and violinist Braimah Kanneh-Mason join forces with guitarist Plínio Fernandes and the Fantasia Orchestra for an ambitious Prom showcasing a huge variety of music, from Brahms’s Hungarian Dances to Stevie Wonder’s I Wish, by way of Bob Marley, Béla Bartók and Chic.\n\nMiriam Margolyes: A New Australian Adventure\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nBohemian Byron Bay is the next stop of Miriam Margolyes’s trans-Australian trip. Taking no prisoners on her mobility scooter, she has her say on influencers, Botox and farmers markets (she is a fan of just one). She is also impressed by the community’s diversity and commitment to sustainable living, and scrutinises the increasing impact of flooding on a community living on the frontline of climate change. And then she takes a dip in the sea…\n\nChampions: Full Gallop\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nMaster and apprentice go head-to-head as trainers Paul Nicholls and Dan Skelton enter their various charges at the Cheltenham Festival, with everything on the line at the Gold Cup – but perhaps the biggest threat in the latter is posed by Willie Mullins and Galopin Des Champs, aiming to defend the title.\n\nThe Claremont Murders\n\nMore4, 9pm\n\nThe superior true-crime miniseries comes to a shocking conclusion as the cold case is reopened. DNA technology provides a stunning breakthrough and brings to the police’s attention a man who, superficially at least, seems a most unlikely candidate for the serial killings.\n\nThe Instigators (2024) ★★\n\nApple TV+\n\nCasey Affleck and Matt Damon team up for the sort of buddy action-comedy that would have rocked the box office back in the early Noughties; today, it’s straight to streaming, and seems woefully outdated. Produced by the pair, alongside Ben Affleck, it sees them play two chaotic thieves who go on the run with their therapist (The Whale’s Hong Chau) after an attempt to steal a corrupt politician’s earnings goes badly awry. Doug Liman (Mr & Mrs Smith, Edge of Tomorrow) directs.\n\nSelf Reliance (2023) ★★★\n\nParamount+\n\nNew Girl actor Jake Johnson turns director for this comedy thriller. He also plays the lead, Tommy, a down on his luck loser who is offered the chance to win $1 million by taking part in a reality show. The maxim “if it looks too good to be true…” is proven right, again, when it turns out the show involves 30 global assassins being sent to kill him. Think Squid Game crossed with the raucous humour of Game Night. Anna Kendrick co-stars.\n\nUnder the Boardwalk (2023) ★★★\n\nSky Cinema Premiere, 3pm\n\nDreamWorks veteran David Soren directs this fun, flitty animated musical comedy. It follows two crabs (voiced by Nope’s Keke Palmer and Superbad’s Michael Cera) as they try to get home after a storm sweeps them away. Keep an ear out for the tunes: Steven Van Zandt, of Springsteen’s E Street Band, is on the cast list. Looking for something more grown-up? Bryce McGuire’s horror Night Swim premieres at 8pm.\n\nHeat (1995) ★★★★\n\nGreat! Movies, 9pm\n\nThanks in large part to the irresistible pairing of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Heat is a tautly plotted and superbly acted action thriller from The Last of the Mohicans director Michael Mann. Its premise is very simple: a dedicated cop (Pacino) is on the trail of a ruthlessly efficient thief (De Niro, on scintillating form), who lives by one callous motto: “Never have anything in your life that you can’t walk out on in 30 seconds flat.”\n\nSaturday 10 August\n\nElizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes\n\nSky Documentaries, 9pm\n\nThe Elizabeth Taylor who emerges from Nanette Burstein’s absorbing film is no damaged child actor, but a defiant, self-aware star and survivor of Hollywood misogyny (“Can she cook?” a hack asks her fourth husband Eddie Fisher), hypocritical moralising and relentless tabloid scrutiny. The “Lost Tapes” in question are interviews recorded with journalist Richard Meryman in the mid-1960s, when her relationship with Richard Burton had gone public and Cleopatra had made her the world’s first $1 million movie star.\n\n“An untrustworthy lady, completely superficial, not too pretty… inside,” is her assessment of her public image. Taylor, who died in 2011, aged 79, makes for wonderful company here: she is candid, self-deprecating and full of valuable insights. The questions are probing but Taylor is clearly in charge, appraising both films and romantic partners over some smartly edited archive footage. The rather perfunctory treatment of her final decades, ticked off in 10 minutes, thwarts any claims for The Lost Tapes to be definitive, but it is never less than richly entertaining. GT\n\nWW2: Women on the Frontline\n\nChannel 4, 7pm\n\nMore remarkable stories of heroism, this time from the skies. Tonight’s tales from both sides of the Second World War include a Luftwaffe test pilot and a member of the Soviet “Night Witches” regiment. Nonagenarian Grace Taylor, meanwhile, talks us through her work on anti-aircraft artillery.\n\nBritain’s Most Beautiful Road\n\nChannel 4, 8pm\n\nBack after a three-year hiatus, the Highland Games form the heart of tonight’s gloriously picturesque trundle around northern Scotland, as a caber tosser enters training, a historic pathway by Loch Maree requires urgent attention and a “shellfish safari” draws in the crowds in Badachro Bay.\n\nWeather Hits at the BBC\n\nBBC Two, 9pm; Wales, 10pm\n\nWhether it’s raining men, always raining on Travis’s Fran Healy or the sun not shining on a lovelorn Bill Withers, the weather has been an effective device for pop songwriters for decades. With Carol Kirkwood and Tomasz Schafernaker providing the links, this is another bright and breezy trip into the BBC’s archives.\n\nSandringham: A Royal Residence with Nigel Havers\n\nChannel 5, 9pm\n\nInto the modern era for this final instalment, with the death in 1952 of George VI at Sandringham thrusting his 25-year-old daughter Princess Elizabeth onto the throne; 70 years later, with Sandringham now open to the public, Prince Charles would accede to the throne and inherit the estate, for which he has big green plans. While Nigel Havers ambles around relating the history, Raksha Dave examines the diary of the man who designed the late Queen’s coronation dress, and JJ Chalmers takes a bird’s eye view.\n\nChanging Ends\n\nITV1, 9.45pm\n\nThe climax to one of the greatest seasons in the history of Northampton Town FC is the backdrop to the final episode of Alan Carr’s amiable sitcom about his childhood years, with his dad (Shaun Dooley) under pressure as the crunch game approaches against Crewe and Alan (Oliver Savell) struggling with drama onstage and off.\n\nPiglets\n\nITV1, 10.10pm\n\nThe gleefully daft police comedy continues with Geeta (Sukh Ojla) fretting about the imminent bleep test, Bob (Mark Heap) turning superhero and Paul’s (Jamie Bisping) future hanging by a precarious thread. Safe, but amusing.\n\nThe Man Who Never Was (1956) ★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 12.35pm\n\nRonald Neame’s haunting wartime spy thriller was adapted by Nigel Balchin from Ewen Montagu’s book, based on the real story of Operation Mincemeat. Clifton Webb plays Montagu, the officer assigned to plant false papers on a human corpse and dump it in the sea near Spain, in a bizarre plan to feed misinformation to the Germans. Bizarre truth aside, it’s all quite tense and surprisingly moving.\n\nUnforgiven (1992) ★★★★★\n\n5Action, 9pm\n\nClint Eastwood’s dark, sombre Western won four Oscars and enhanced the actor’s reputation as a serious film-maker. He plays a gunslinger turned pig farmer, who is searching for some redemption from his violent past, but is struggling with his quiet new life. Never mind: he’s eventually coaxed out of retirement when a bounty is offered by some vengeful prostitutes. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman lend excellent support.\n\nThe Score (2001) ★★★\n\nGreat! Movies, 9pm\n\nFrank Oz’s heist-thriller pivots on master safe-cracker Nick Wells (Robert De Niro), who fleetingly considers leaving the world of crime behind to settle down – before being lured back in by the promise of a $6 million cut from a mission to steal a royal sceptre. It stars Marlon Brando in his final film, and also marks (tragically, for cinema lovers) the only time Brando and De Niro appeared together on screen.\n\nShadow in the Cloud (2020) ★★★\n\nBBC One, 11.40pm\n\nRoseanne Liang’s horror film combines the fast-paced action sequences of Terminator 2 with the mystical elements of King Kong. Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) plays US flight officer Maude Garrett, who is stationed in the Pacific during the Second World War and winds up trapped on a plane with an evil gremlin. It’s far-fetched, of course, but the CGI is solid and Moretz has a canny sense of fun.\n\nSunday 11 August\n\nOlympics: Paris 2024: Closing Ceremony\n\nBBC One, 7pm\n\nThe world will be holding its collective breath – and offering prayers to the weather gods – in the hope that the closing of the Paris Games at the Stade de France won’t suffer the same soggy fate as its opening. Just two weeks ago, the grand spectacle of boats carrying athletes along the Seine was somewhat overshadowed by the pouring rain; only Celine Dion’s performance from atop the Eiffel Tower escaped unscathed.\n\nNow, the rumour mill for the Closing Ceremony is in overdrive: Tom Cruise is set to perform an “epic stunt” that involves the 62-year-old Mission Impossible actor abseiling down from the roof of the stadium to collect the Olympic flag, matching up with a filmed segment (made in March) of him skydiving onto the Hollywood sign in order to deliver the flag to Los Angeles for the 2028 Games. Not that that will distract from the main purpose of the ceremony, which is to gather all the athletes and officials one last time for a moment of joyful celebration, as the Olympic torch and flags are lowered and passed on. But first Clare Balding looks back at some of the highlights, before handing over to Hazel Irvine and Andrew Cotter. GO\n\nTitanic in Colour\n\nChannel 4, 8pm\n\nThis compelling episode takes us through RMS Titanic’s final day, using film from her sister ship Olympic to reimagine how she would have looked, while graphics allow us to follow her – post-iceberg – down into the icy depths. Survivors’ stories are also brought to life by newly restored film capturing their rescue by the nearby ship, Carpathia.\n\nNYO Plays Mahler’s First at the Proms\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nA recording of last night’s concert, at the Royal Albert Hall, by the National Youth Orchestra. Along with Mahler’s First, the orchestra performs the overture to Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman, Missy Mazzoli’s Orpheus Undone and the world premiere of a stirring new piece by British composer Dani Howard.\n\nGladiators\n\nSky Nature, 8pm\n\nThe second episode of the absorbing nature series takes us to the western coast of Australia, where the disruptive effects of climate change are forcing some species – among them kangaroos, venomous redback spiders, sea lions, gigantic bull ants and great white sharks – to push into new territory. Sean Bean narrates.\n\nVienna Blood\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nAmusing cameos tonight from Amelia Bullmore and Conleth Hill as Max’s (Matthew Beard) concerned parents, who descend like a plague following last week’s shooting. With Max’s life hanging in the balance, Reinhardt (Jürgen Maurer) is even more determined to unmask the traitor Mephisto, but it’s not long before he’s in the firing line, too.\n\nThe Body Next Door\n\nSky Documentaries, 9pm\n\nThis oddly entertaining – if horrifying – true-crime docu-series begins with the discovery of a body wrapped in plastic in a garden in a Welsh village. With the local police initially led down a variety of blind alleys, it takes until the end of episode one (of three) to unearth the key clues that eventually pointed them in a different direction entirely – New Zealand.\n\nThe Other Mrs Jordan\n\nITV1, 10.15pm\n\nA free-to-air showing (it’s boxsetted on ITVX) for this true-crime series about the bigamist, fraudster and convicted sex offender William Jordan. While posing as a CIA agent, he targeted vulnerable women and conned them into marrying him and having his children, while using their money to fund his fantasy lifestyle.\n\nFlushed Away (2006) ★★★★\n\nITV1, 12.30pm\n\nAlthough it hails from the same studio that gave us Wallace & Gromit, this is only a computerised imitation of Aardman’s “claymation” technique. The fun plot follows Roddy the Mouse (voiced by Hugh Jackman) after he gets flushed into the London sewer system and must save the rat population from an evil toad (Ian McKellen). There’s more child-friendly animation over on Sky from today with The Inventor (Cinema Premiere, 2.45pm).\n\nThis Beautiful Fantastic (2016) ★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 2pm\n\nSimon Aboud’s sweet drama tells the story of an anxious woman with a fear of the outdoors, played by Jessica Brown Findlay, and the crabby elderly neighbour (Tom Wilkinson) who she reluctantly turns to for help bringing her neglected garden under control when her landlord threatens her with eviction. It’s richly, if not subtly, allegorical and uplifting as spring sunshine. Andrew Scott provides some heft in support.\n\nThe Elephant Man (1980, b/w) ★★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.30pm\n\nDavid Lynch’s perennial tear-jerker stars the brilliant John Hurt as the deformed 19th-century Londoner Joseph Merrick, who was exhibited in a freak show as “The Elephant Man”. After being rescued by Dr Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick reveals an intelligent mind, hidden by his exploiters. Lynch’s peculiar vision of the world and an unsentimental script make for a timelessly moving drama about what we perceive as “different”.\n\nI Am Not Your Negro (2016) ★★★★\n\nBBC Four, 11.55pm\n\nIt was recently James Baldwin’s 100th birthday, making Raoul Peck’s astonishing, Oscar-nominated documentary about the writer and activist a timely watch. Combining archive clips from speeches by Baldwin and Civil Rights leaders such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr, with narration provided by Samuel L Jackson, it paints a blistering portrait of the US in the 1960s, and serves as a testament to Baldwin’s quiet, understated gravitas.\n\nMonday 12 August\n\nMy Tiger Family\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nMy Tiger Family is a story of survival: how the tiger population of Rajasthan’s Ranthambore Fort, in India, once on the verge of being poached out of existence, is now thriving thanks to humans. Film-maker Valmik Thapar first visited on a whim in the 1970s and fell hard for the fort’s new feline rulers, tracking their progress through the generations. By his own admission, he is neither conservationist nor activist; just an admirer with a camera. However, Thapar uses this to his advantage by leaning into the emotional connections to a far greater degree than we tend to see in the BBC’s other blockbuster nature series. “They are like family to me,” he concludes, and we believe him.\n\nThe footage used is jaw dropping, too: tigress Arrowhead, pregnant and desperate for protein, diving into the river and attacking crocodiles; or Machli, scrapping furiously for supremacy with an unwanted potential mate with designs on both her and her territory. All of it is filmed against the stunning backdrop of a stronghold held by numerous dynasties over its 1,000-year lifespan, offering a valuable new perspective on this most majestic of beasts. GT\n\nIolo’s Valleys\n\nBBC Two, 7pm\n\nFirst shown on BBC Wales, this charming series sees Springwatch presenter Iolo Williams on the hunt for fauna including butterflies, kingfishers, skylarks and honey buzzards in stunning South Wales landscapes.\n\nMastermind\n\nBBC Two, 7.30pm\n\nClear your diaries on Monday nights as the BBC’s three-course feast of cerebral entertainment returns. Up first is Clive Myrie, challenging four contenders on specialist subjects including Jane Austen, Dad’s Army and Shania Twain. Victoria Coren Mitchell is back with Only Connect at 8pm, while finally, Liverpool face Queen’s University Belfast for a place in the second round of University Challenge at 8.30pm, with Amol Rajan in the chair.\n\nAmbassadors in Berlin\n\nPBS America, 8pm\n\nWhether it was wilful denial or disbelief, the reality of Hitler’s intentions dawned on many of the governments of the great powers far too late. But as this considered documentary demonstrates, it was not for lack of trying from their ambassadors in Berlin, who understood the dangers posed by the Nazis but were largely ignored or disregarded.\n\nLong Lost Family\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nDavina McCall and Nicky Campbell present another well-judged blend of the heartrending and uplifting: one woman learns from her elderly mother that she has a brother who was given up for adoption, and another gets confirmation that the sister she long felt was out there really exists. Will the long-awaited reunions take place?\n\nEmergency\n\nChannel 4, 9pm\n\nRunning over four consecutive nights, this deeply stressful series following London’s frontline medics begins with another array of serious cases: a man whose leg has been crushed by a bus, a paratrooper in a paragliding accident and a teenager with an arterial bleed. And that’s just for starters.\n\nCall My Bluff\n\nBBC Four, 9pm\n\nBack to the 1970s for tonight’s double bill of loquacious quizzing, with Robert Robinson the ringmaster, Frank Muir and Patrick Campbell the resident wits and Miles Kington and Joanna Lumley among the guests for Call My Bluff. At 9.30pm, Crossroads star Jane Rossington and folk musician Tim Hollier join Max Robertson to appraise a series of mystery objects in Going for a Song.\n\nRoman Holiday (1953, b/w) ★★★★★\n\nFilm4, 2.30pm\n\nThe film that made Audrey Hepburn a star is still, 71 years later, among cinema’s most charming romcoms. Hepburn plays a princess on a visit to Rome, who escapes her guardians and takes off on a jaunt through the city with a handsome journalist (Gregory Peck) on a Vespa. He recognises her, but isn’t letting on because he’s hoping for a scoop. Gorgeously shot on location, their chemistry sizzles and soars.\n\nThe Sense of an Ending (2017) ★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.05pm\n\nJulian Barnes’s novel about the slippery nature of the past is a tricky prospect for cinema, a challenge that playwright Nick Payne and director Ritesh Batra grapple with here. Jim Broadbent plays Tony, a divorced Londoner reassessing his school days, when his friendships and first love (Charlotte Rampling) came unstuck. Broadbent is compelling, though Harriet Walter, as his ex-wife, is better yet.\n\nNuns on the Run (1990) ★★★\n\nFilm4, 11.10pm\n\nEric Idle and Robbie Coltrane impersonate ladies of the habit in this raucous, unapologetically silly comedy about two men trying to dodge the law. It’s a modern interpretation of Some Like It Hot and there’s even a nod towards Monty Python in the cod theological debates. Plus, Idle and Coltrane must get the award for best bad cross-dressing in cinema for their slapstick bafflement and sheer lack of effort at being womanly.\n\nTuesday 13 August\n\nFreddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams On Tour\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nFreddie Flintoff already proved himself to be one of those rare sportsmen who could transform themselves into an engaging, thoughtful broadcaster with the first series of Field of Dreams, in which the former England cricket ace mentored a group of disadvantaged teenagers from Preston and used cricket to give their life clearer purpose. Whether this sequel would ever actually happen was uncertain after Flintoff’s near-fatal car crash while filming Top Gear in 2022. It is evident the accident changed his life for good; he seems quieter, more reflective, but still intent on helping those in need.\n\n“I feel like I’m a father to nine lads,” is how he describes his relationship with his teenage charges, as they swap Lancashire for the bright lights of Kolkata, India. Once in the bustling city, they take on a once-in-a-lifetime cricket tour that pushes each of them to their limits; not just in a sporting sense, competing against people from the cricket-loving nation, but personally, too, as the lads try, to put it bluntly, not to deck each other following arguments fuelled by homesickness and typical adolescent angst. The remaining three episodes will follow weekly. PP\n\nCelebrity MasterChef\n\nBBC One, 8pm\n\nJohn Torode and Gregg Wallace prepare to welcome more gifted (or not) celebrity cooks into the MasterChef kitchen. Tonight’s round of contestants include presenter Craig Doyle, Geordie Shore’s Charlotte Crosby, radio host Edith Bowman, Steps singer Ian “H” Watkins and BBC Radio 1Xtra’s Snoochie Shy. Their first challenge? Turning the likes of pigeon and sweetbreads into delicious dishes.\n\nCooking with the Stars\n\nITV1, 8pm\n\nAll fear the three-way cooking battle – in tonight’s episode, Abbey Clancy, Katherine Ryan and Pasha Kovalev must rustle up a date night-worthy dish without the help of their star chef partners.\n\nWarship: Life in the Royal Navy\n\nChannel 5, 9pm\n\nJulia Bradbury and former Royal Marine JJ Chalmers meet with recruits in Devon to learn about cutting-edge jets, drilling exercises and cheap meals that make up a typical day in the Navy.\n\nCountry House Auction\n\nMore4, 9pm\n\nThis new series takes us behind-the-scenes at the auction held at Ireland’s Castle Durrow. Rare items on offer for the budding bidders to fight over include a Fender guitar signed by the Rolling Stones and a ceremonial Tibetan dagger made more than 400 years ago.\n\nCorridors of Power: Should America Police the World?\n\nBBC Four, 10pm\n\nThe Bosnian War is the focus of tonight’s second episode, with the US, and President Bill Clinton, under mounting pressure to intervene and stop the genocide against Bosniak Muslims; footage of the massacre at Srebrenica, in 1995, is harrowing but vital. All eight episodes (others cover conflicts in Rwanda, Libya and Syria) are available on iPlayer.\n\nUntold: The Rise and Rise of Taylor Swift\n\nChannel 4, 11.05pm\n\nEarlier this week, three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austria, were cancelled after police foiled an Isis terrorist plot. At the time of writing, Swift’s five-night Eras run at London’s Wembley Stadium is still set to go ahead, starting on Thursday. Away from the news, here self-confessed “Swiftie” and Radio 1 DJ Dean McCullough attempts to describe just what has made the US singer – and her music – such an inescapable, profitable force.\n\nWaterloo (1970) ★★★\n\nGreat! Action, 3pm\n\nThis lavish costume drama, which tells the story of the Battle of Waterloo, was estimated to have cost $100 m. It stars Rod Steiger as Napoleon, Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington and a cast of 15,000 Soviet soldiers as extras; director Sergei Bondarchuk was supposedly “in command of the seventh largest army in the world” during the film. Look out for a cameo by Orson Welles as Louis XVIII of France.\n\nValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017) ★★★★\n\nFilm4, 6.20pm\n\nIf more than every fifth element of Luc Besson’s joyous Day-Glo opus seems familiar, that’s because the 1960s French comic-strip on which it is based helped to shape every classic science-fiction cinematic universe from Star Wars (and Trek) to Avatar. Wallow in the ugly-beautiful wonderment, while Cara Delevingne and Dane DeHaan tumble through the CGI scenery.\n\nThe Keeper (2018) ★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.05pm\n\nThe story of Bert Trautmann, Luftwaffe paratrooper turned Manchester City goalkeeper, feels ready-made for the big screen, and Marcus H Rosenmüller very nearly hits the back of the net with this handsome period weepy. PoW Trautmann (David Kross) is shipped off to the north of England where he finds a new calling, minding the nets for a local team. Michael Socha and John Henshaw co-star.\n\nWednesday 14 August\n\nBad Monkey\n\nApple TV+\n\nIn sunny, eccentric Florida, an amateur fisherman pulls the severed arm of a man from the ocean. It is not just any severed arm either, but one with its middle finger stuck in the offending position. It is a fittingly punchy opening for this breezy 10-part comedy, which stars Vince Vaughn as a suspended Miami cop – the irreverent maverick Andrew Yancy – who is trying to get his job back. If you are familiar with Vaughn’s movies (Wedding Crashers, Old School, Dodgeball et al) you’ll know the type: the wisecracking womaniser with a heart of gold and a penchant for filling his annoying neighbour’s house with bees.\n\nYancy sees the mysterious arm as his chance to redeem himself. Little does he know, however, that the case will suck him into a conspiracy involving the building of a new beachside resort in the Bahamas. This is where we meet Neville (Ronald Peet), a disgruntled local who owns the titular monkey. The opening two episodes, premiering today, flick between these two threads with panache. This is helped by the smooth voice-over of Captain Fitzpatrick (Tom Nowicki), owner of the boat whose men found the arm, who tells the story like he’s drinking a cold beer on a hot day. SK\n\nDaughters\n\nNetflix\n\nThis lyrical feature-length documentary follows the build-up to the Daddy Daughter Dance, a US prison programme that gives incarcerated fathers a rare chance to bond with their children. It is an intimate portrait of the emotional toll of absent parents – both for the daughters, who are wise beyond their years, and the inmates themselves.\n\nThe Big Brunch\n\nU&W, 8pm\n\nDan Levy, best known as the star of US sitcom Schitt’s Creek, presents this big hearted eight-part cooking show. The format is essentially MasterChef: 10 talented cooks are tasked with creating a brunch-themed starter and main dish. The difference is tone, which feels inspired by the gentleness of The Great British Bake Off.\n\nCelebrity Race Across the World\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nThe celebrity edition of the race returns. This year’s globetrotters are broadcaster Kelly Brook and her husband Jeremy; Ted Lasso actor Kola Bokinni and his cousin Mary; radio host Scott Mills and his husband Sam; and presenter Jeff Brazier and his son Freddie. Tonight they find themselves in Brazil, where they must start their epic 12,500 km journey to the Andes.\n\nIrvine Welsh’s Crime\n\nITV1, 9pm; Wales, 10.45pm\n\n“I put my hand through the powdered skull of a dead child!” sobs Dougray Scott’s tortured DI Lennox tonight. The highlight of this week’s episode of the tense crime drama, however, is Derek Riddell’s deliciously hateful politician Richie Gulliver. The series continues tomorrow.\n\nKidnapped: The Chloe Ayling Story\n\nBBC Three, from 9pm\n\nIn 2017, a glamour model called Chloe Ayling was kidnapped in Milan and held for ransom. This intriguing six-part drama outlines the ordeal and its aftermath, which saw Ayling (Nadia Parkes) falsely accused of making it up. The first two episodes premiere tonight and also air tomorrow on BBC One; all six are on iPlayer.\n\nRemember… Inspector Lynley Mysteries\n\nBBC Four, 10pm\n\nLead actors Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small reflect on their 2001 drama, which smashed together two detectives from opposing backgrounds. It’s followed by the first two episodes: the meeting of DI Thomas Linley, 8th Earl of Asherton, and working-class Detective Sgt Barbara Havers.\n\nBoyz N the Hood (1991) ★★★★★\n\nGreat! Movies, 9pm\n\nJohn Singleton’s debut film, made when he was just 24-years-old, is a searing wake-up call about friends growing up on the rough streets of Los Angeles. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Laurence Fishburne, it blazed the trail for black directors in the early 1990s, thanks to its cautionary rhetoric about gang culture, the scourge of inescapable poverty and magnetic performances (especially from rapper Ice Cube as surly layabout Doughboy).\n\nBridge of Spies (2015) ★★★★★\n\nBBC One, 11.20pm\n\nSteven Spielberg’s Cold War thriller swirls with intrigue; its tension is worthy of the best of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic noir films. Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a US lawyer recruited by the CIA to defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in a role that deservedly won him both a Bafta and an Oscar) and arranges to trade him for a captured US pilot in East Berlin. Amy Ryan and Alan Alda also stalk through the fog.\n\nMeet the Parents (2000) ★★★★\n\nFilm4, 11.20pm\n\nJay Roach’s oh-so-Noughties romantic comedy may be silly, but it’s elevated by terrific, understated performances from Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. The former is Jack Byrnes, an uptight ex-CIA agent deeply suspicious of his daughter’s new boyfriend, the eager-to-please but accident-prone Greg Focker (played with winning charm by Stiller). The equally hilarious sequel, Meet the Fockers, is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThursday 15 August\n\nWho Do You Think You Are?\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nFar from the complicated, ferocious characters that she portrays on television, actress Vicky McClure is the definition of level-headed, down to earth and rooted; she even still lives just a few minutes from her parents and extended family in Nottingham, where she grew up. But with a grandmother who was abandoned at birth and a great-grandfather who died at the hands of the Japanese during the Second World War, she makes a perfect subject for the first episode in this new run of the engrossing celebrity genealogy show (other personalities to come include Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill, actress and Strictly winner Rose Ayling-Ellis and former Spice Girl Mel C).\n\nWhile McClure’s grandmother Jean’s story is a sad one, it yields few surprises, so we move quickly on to the trials of her great-grandfather, Harry, who worked as a miner before joining up during the war, where he fought the Japanese in Singapore before being captured and sent to Taiwan as a prisoner of war. Of course, McClure heads there, too, to hear of the horrifying conditions that Harry had to endure as a forced labourer in a copper mine, and the circumstances in which he met his end. A moving testament to sacrifice. GO\n\nEmily in Paris\n\nNetflix\n\nWhatever else you may think about it, the clothes and setting remain fabulous as the much-anticipated fourth season of the love-it/hate-it series about an American PR (played by Lily Collins) frollicking around Paris finally arrives. Expect quite a few refreshes in personnel – and love interests – this time out.\n\nStags\n\nParamount+\n\nThis raucous six-part dramedy follows Stu (Nico Mirallegro) and his eight variously numpty/smart British pals (among them Charlie Cooper and Asim Chaudhry) on a stag-do trip to South America that goes very, very wrong. In the first episode, they’re banged up in a hellhole island prison run by feuding criminal siblings; think The Hangover, but with much higher stakes.\n\nThe Bureau\n\nParamount+\n\nCould this be the next Spiral? The grittily atmospheric spy series revolving around the lives of France’s version of MI6, the DGSE external security agency, was so well received at home in France that it ran for five seasons and won awards for acting, writing and direction. All 50 episodes are available from today.\n\nClassic Movies: The Story of Whisky Galore!\n\nSky Arts, 8pm\n\nFilm journalist Ian Nathan explores the true story that inspired Alexander Mackendrick’s glorious 1949 Ealing wartime romp about a Scottish island community whose fortunes turn when a freighter carrying 50,000 crates of whisky is shipwrecked on its shores.\n\nDaddy Issues\n\nBBC Three, 9pm & 9.25pm\n\nActor David Morrissey may be a familiar face in serious drama, but he is wonderfully funny in this Stockport-based six-part comedy opposite the equally brilliant Aimee Lou Wood (Sex Education). They play divorced dad Malcolm and his pregnant daughter Gemma, forced to move in together to save cash. Also airing on BBC One from tomorrow.\n\nKlitschko: More Than a Fight\n\nSky Documentaries, 9pm\n\nAfter President Zelensky, the heavyweight-boxer brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko are probably the best-known Ukrainians leading the fight against Putin’s invading Russian forces. This dual profile by Oscar-winner Kevin Macdonald focuses marginally more on former World Champion Vitali in his role as mayor of the capital, Kyiv.\n\nBridge to Terabithia (2007) ★★★\n\nFilm4, 12.40pm\n\nAnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson (who went on to star together in The Hunger Games) play two young misfits who become friends and create a magical world of the imagination in a remote part of the forest. This quality Disney production, adapted from Katherine Paterson’s wondrous 1977 novel, ventures into unexpectedly dark territory, and manages to carry some genuine emotional freight.\n\nDial M for Murder (1954, b/w) ★★★★\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nIt’s not quite as brilliant as Hitchcock’s best (Vertigo, The Birds), but his spin on Frederick Knott’s stage play is still packed with suspense. Tony Wendice (played by the superbly sinister Ray Milland) is trying to have his wife (Grace Kelly) murdered. When his first plan fails, he dreams up another that’s even more devious. If you’re in the mood for more Hitchcock, 1941 noir Suspicion follows.\n\nLucy (2014) ★★★★\n\nITV4, 10.10pm\n\nScarlett Johansson stars in this excellent Luc Besson thriller as Lucy, a woman whose drug-addled brain begins to surpass our usual (reputed) 10 per cent level of grey-matter use; but take the “science” with a lump of salt and just enjoy Johansson’s riveting, icy performance. Morgan Freeman plays the neuroscientist tasked with explaining the mind’s power. What happens at 100 per cent? “We just don’t know…”\n\nFriday 16 August\n\nModern Movie Soundtracks At the Proms\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nIt has become a tradition in recent years for the Proms to include a night or two themed around the most populist form of classical music: TV and film scores. Tonight’s eclectic celebration of movie soundtracks from the 2020s was recorded earlier this week at the Royal Albert Hall and is presented by Edith Bowman, and showcases some of contemporary cinema’s most compelling composers.\n\nVolker Bertelmann’s Oscar-winning work on 2022 war epic All Quiet on the Western Front, for instance, is just one of many pieces played here by The London Contemporary Orchestra, conducted by Robert Ames. Elsewhere, you can enjoy Jerskin Fendrix’s quirky score for Frankenstein riff Poor Things; Hildur Guðnadóttir’s eerie soundtrack for cancel-culture satire Tár and Jed Kurzel’s composition for bloody action-flick Monkey Man. There are some exceptions to the theme, with TV shows including Netflix hit Squid Game (whose score was composed by Jung Jae II) getting their time in the spotlight. The night concludes with Max Richter’s devastating On the Nature of Daylight, made famous by the terrific sci-fi film Arrival. SK\n\nOur Lives: Two Sisters, One Goal\n\nBBC One, 7.30pm\n\nThe slice-of-life docu-series returns with the story of Katy and Emma, two sisters from the Welsh village of Brynamman who have decided to arrange an all-star charity football match between Wales and England. They have to find a venue, persuade celebrities and find two big-name managers. The only problem? Neither of them know anything about football.\n\nA New Australian Adventure\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nMiriam Margolyes concludes her Australian odyssey with a visit to Broken Hill, the outback town whose famous mines are dwindling, along with its population. It is an episode themed around reinvention, both for Broken Hill and Margolyes herself, who is adapting to life after a critical heart operation. “If you don’t grow,” she says wisely, “you diminish”.\n\nChampions: Full Gallop\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nTonight we go behind the scenes of one of the most famous races in the calendar – the Grand National. The million-pound prize pot draws a field of 34 riders, although tonight’s big characters are ambitious trainers Dan Skelton and Willie Mullins.\n\nHostage\n\nMore4, 9pm & 10pm\n\nThis slick six-part Swedish thriller, based on the novel by Kristina Ohlsson, has a killer concept. A plane has been hijacked by terrorists demanding the release of a detained professor. The twist? The co-pilot of the plane is the estranged son of a police officer in charge of rescuing the hostages.\n\nRev\n\nBBC Two, 10pm\n\nIt has been 14 years since the first episode of Rev premiered, and the wry clerical comedy still feels as fresh as ever. The key, of course, is the masterful Tom Hollander, whose disgruntled London priest Adam subverts the idea of the cosy village vicar in favour of something grittier and soulful. A repeat well worth tucking into.\n\nThe Golden Cobra\n\nBBC Three, 10pm & 10.15pm\n\nThis crudely animated cartoon comedy has shades of 2003 cult favourite Monkey Dust, rendering it an acquired taste. It is set around a surreally hellish takeaway in the Welsh valleys, whose curries melt through the floor like acid. In the first of tonight’s two episodes (each 15 minutes long), owner Basil tries to murder a health inspector.\n\nThe Union (2024)\n\nNetflix\n\nMark Wahlberg has certainly had his practice playing agents or officers unafraid to get their hands dirty (or bloody): just cast your mind back to The Corruptor, Patriots Day or Mile 22. In this new action flick from Julian Farino (Giri/Haji), he plays a down-on-his-luck guy who runs into his ex-girlfriend (Halle Berry) at a high-school reunion. One small twist: she’s now a secret agent, and soon drags him into her world of guns and criminal gangs.\n\nDangerous Minds (1995) ★★★\n\n5STAR, 9pm\n\nCritics had mixed feelings towards this drama starring Michelle Pfeiffer: some found it moving, others thought it was full of stereotypes. The soundtrack, featuring Coolio’s Gangsta’s Paradise, however, was a sure-fire hit, topping the charts and certified platinum. Pfeiffer plays a former Marine who takes up a teaching gig at a tough high school near LA. The kids try to wear her down, but her training soon comes in clutch.\n\nBraveheart (1995) ★★★★\n\nBBC One, 10.40pm\n\nMel Gibson sports his woad, his sporran and one of the oddest accents committed to film to play William Wallace in this shouty, gory Highland epic chock full of memorable quotes (“The trouble with Scotland is that it’s full of Scots”). It’s great fun, though perhaps undeserving of its Best Picture Oscar (it won four more). Sophie Marceau, as a sultry love interest, cranks up the anachronism – in reality, Isabella of France was then only six years old.\n\nSpy (2015) ★★★\n\nITV1, 10.45pm\n\nBridesmaids director Paul Feig reunites with Melissa McCarthy for this espionage comedy. McCarthy plays CIA operative Susan, who gets the career break she’s been waiting for when she’s sent to Europe to follow Rose Byrne’s villainous Rayna. There’s plenty of f-bombs, toilet humour and fun action sequences, and Jason Statham and Miranda Hart offer solid support. Feig’s new film Jackpot is on Amazon Prime Video from Thursday.\n\nFilm of the Week: Moon (2009) ★★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.05pm\n\nHuman beings have long been obsessed with the planets that exist, far, far away, from our own here on Earth. But no distant object found in space captures our imagination quite like the Moon: from Moonfall to Gravity and First Man. This spectacular sci-fi film by Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie, son of David who introduced his son to the world of 8mm one-stop animation) is among the finest; its echoes of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and its quiet beauty, make it hard to believe that it marked his directorial debut (he scooped the Bafta for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer). The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, who went on to win an Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), the only worker in a mining facility on the far side of the Moon, who discovers a chilling truth about his life as he nears the end of his three-year stint of solitude. The creeping sense that something has gone amiss lingers over the film like a blanket of dread, as Sam descends further into unease and starts experiencing mysterious visions; overshadowing any chance he has at a happy reunion with his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter.\n\nTelevision previewers\n\nStephen Kelly (SK), Veronica Lee (VL), Gerard O’Donovan (GO), Poppie Platt (PP) and Gabriel Tate (GT)"
