        "text": "Whatever your go-to genre—musicals, thrillers, crime dramas, romantic comedies—here’s a roundup of movies to remind you why there’s simply no place like New York.\n\nAt the best of times, life in New York can be disarmingly cinematic, whether you’re walking through the park (any park!) on a perfect fall day, jammed into a booth at a gorgeous old-style restaurant, or riding the Q train over the East River. The hum and thrum of the city is filled with grace notes—which is why, for decades and decades, its boroughs have been a backdrop for some of film’s most hilarious, romantic, and deeply moving moments.\n\nWhatever your go-to genre—musicals, thrillers, crime dramas, romantic comedies—here’s a roundup of movies to remind you why there’s simply no place like New York.\n\nOn the Town (1949)\n\n“New York, New York, it’s a wonderful town!” So begins the opening number of this golden age romp, adapted from the Broadway musical of the same name (and, before that, Jerome Robbins’s 1944 ballet Fancy Free). Directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, On the Town stars Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin as Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie, three Navy men spending their shore leave in the Big Apple.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on HBO Max.\n\nThe Seven Year Itch (1955)\n\nOne of the most enduring images of Manhattan is of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress as steam rises from a New York subway vent. The iconic scene—which took place on the corner of 52nd Street and Lexington Avenue—is from the 1955 comedy The Seven Year Itch, which sees a restless husband (Tom Ewell) ensorcelled by a neighboring blond.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nWest Side Story (1961)\n\nFrom its artful prologue (the colorblocked Saul Bass graphics, those bird’s-eye views, that utterly irresistible Leonard Bernstein score!) to its lacerating finale, West Side Story set a high watermark for New York movies. Under the direction of Robert Wise and director-choreographer Jerome Robbins (who also commandeered the original stage production), the playgrounds and fire escapes of the Upper West Side framed an epic—and enduringly compelling—urban love story.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s (1961)\n\nBased on the 1958 novella by Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany’s draws its name from its main character, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) and her habit for taking breakfast to-go while window shopping at Tiffany’s. A trip to the famed jeweler is also her solution whenever she feels sad or lonely. “The only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany's,” Holly says. “Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look of it; nothing very bad could happen to you there.”\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Apple TV.\n\nThe Group (1966)\n\nBorn in Philadelphia but raised in Manhattan, director Sidney Lumet made nearly all of his films in New York—from 1957’s 12 Angry Men to 2007’s Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead. Early in The Group, his delightfully soapy adaptation of the 1963 novel by Mary McCarthy, wedding guests lunch at the elegant old Brevoort Hotel before trailing the happy couple to the subway and blissfully throwing rice down the stairs after them. All told, it was the city’s biggest film production to date, budgeted at $2.6 million and calling for—according to Maura Spiegel’s Sidney Lumet: A Life —“thirty-five locations, more than fifty sets on sound stages, and more than a thousand costumes.”\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nSymbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One (1968)\n\nFilmed one summer in Central Park, with cameos from a mounted policeman, a gaggle of teens, and other random passersby, Symbiopsychotaxiplasm is ostensibly about the making of a romantic drama—we see the same marital squabble performed again and again—which soon begins to fall apart. The crew, we learn, is working without any real sense of the movie’s story, structure, or even its cast, and they debate whether the director (Greaves, seemingly playing himself) actually knows what he’s doing. It’s little wonder, in the end, that the working title for their project is “Over the Cliff.”\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on HBO Max.\n\nThree Days of the Condor (1975)\n\nRobert Redford and Faye Dunaway star in this stylish espionage thriller from director Sydney Pollack. Between coded calls from phone booths and run-ins with mustachioed assassins (see the late, great Max von Sydow), this is Redford in his mid-1970s prime, sprinting around New York as a herringbone-blazer-wearing CIA researcher who finds his colleagues dead. (A bit dark for your taste? Redford also takes Manhattan in 1967’s Barefoot in the Park, based on the delightful Neil Simon play, with Jane Fonda; and in 1973’s The Way We Were, also directed by Pollack, with Barbra Streisand.)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nAn Unmarried Woman (1978)\n\nThere’s an interesting uptown/downtown dichotomy at work in Paul Mazursky’s An Unmarried Woman, which sees a well-to-do woman (Jill Clayburgh) get together with an artist (Alan Bates) when her white-collar husband (Michael Murphy) moves out. From ice-skating in Rockefeller Center to sneaking in a make-out on an empty SoHo side street, Clayburgh’s character, Erica, slowly carves out a life in a Manhattan of her own—one that exists quite apart from her glassy, East-60s aerie.\n\nHow to Watch: Buy on Amazon.\n\nMoonstruck (1987)\n\nMoonstruck, directed by Norman Jewison (Fiddler on the Roof) has everything you’d want from a New York movie: A large Italian family in Brooklyn Heights; Cher, playing the bookkeeper for a funeral home; Nicolas Cage without a hand; dogs howling at the moon over the East River; an emotional night at the opera; a lovely dinner between Olympia Dukakis and John Mahoney; and lots of crying, slapping, and unsentimental wisdom (“When you love them, they drive you crazy because they know they can”).\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nCrossing Delancey (1988)\n\nIn Joan Micklin Silver’s Crossing Delancey, based on the play by Susan Sandler, Amy Irving is Isabelle “Izzy” Grossman, a single woman in love with a dashing European author (Jeroen Krabbé)—but being nudged toward the owner of a local pickle shop (Peter Riegert) by her meddling grandmother. One of the rare (explicitly) Jewish rom-coms of the period, it followed Claudia Weill’s small but significant Girlfriends by a decade, and anticipated Charles Herman-Wurmfeld’s wonderful Kissing Jessica Stein, from 2001.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nWorking Girl (1988)\n\nMelanie Griffith, Harrison Ford, and Sigourney Weaver star in this quintessential workplace comedy about a secretary making her way up the corporate ladder. Come for Griffith’s iconic transformation from Staten Island naif to Manhattan man-eater (“I have a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything wrong with that?”), stay for the outrageous, proto-Balenciaga padded-shoulder jackets.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nDo The Right Thing (1989)\n\nSpike Lee directed and starred in this iconic Brooklyn film, which was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood. Set over the course of one of the hottest days of summer, the film chronicles the long-simmering racial tensions in the neighborhood. Do the Right Thing was a commercial and critical hit, earning Academy Award nods for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally (1989)\n\nAs a chronicler of city life, Nora Ephron had a flair for both the comically specific and the sweepingly romantic—her screenplay for When Harry Met Sally being the obvious example. A Manhattan movie par excellence, it made Katz’s Deli into a veritable pilgrimage site, besides playing up the almost shocking beauty of autumn in New York. (A year and a half before her death, in June 2012, Ephron compiled a list of the things she’d miss most, among them “fall,” “a walk in the park,” “the idea of a walk in the park,” and “the park.”)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nGoodfellas (1990)\n\nFrom Mean Streets and Taxi Driver to The Age of Innocence and The Wolf of Wall Street, Martin Scorsese’s best-loved films have seldom strayed far from the New York metropolitan area. Among them is Goodfellas, that canonical crime drama starring Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta (“As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster...”). Focused on a mobster and his vast web of family and friends, much of the film was shot in Astoria, Queens. (Scorsese himself was born in Flushing.)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nMetropolitan (1990)\n\nWhit Stillman’s wryly funny indie—set “not so long ago,” according to a title card—centers on a set of wealthy, New York City coeds (and one red-headed, Upper West Side outsider) during debutante ball season, over their winter break. What could easily be a send-up of the insular uptown rich, however, turns out to be a very charming study of identity politics, teenage angst, strip poker, and love across the aisle on snow-dusted Park Avenue. (As a follow-up to this, watch The Last Days of Disco—Stillman’s paean to the downtown club scene and its hapless adherents—from 1998, starring Chloë Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale.)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on HBO Max.\n\nThe Prince of Tides (1991)\n\nIt helps that in The Prince of Tides, adapted from Pat Conroy’s popular 1986 novel, the protagonist—Nick Nolte’s ornery, South Carolina–born Tom Wingo—arrives in New York determined to hate it. Without giving too much of the drama away, his sister’s psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand, who also directs), eventually changes his mind—and as he falls in love with her, so too does he fall for her loud, unfriendly city. Soon, we see Wingo playing football in the park, strolling past the Corner Bookstore on 93rd and Madison, bidding a fond farewell in bustling Grand Central Station, and slow-dancing in the Rainbow Room.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nHome Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992)\n\nThe 1992 blockbuster Home Alone 2 brings Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) to New York City. While in town, he visits Rockefeller Center and stays the night at the Plaza Hotel, orders a stretch limo and a large cheese pizza for one (and also bests those pesky bandits who also happen to be in town). Fans of the 90s favorite can visit the Big Apple, Kevin-style, courtesy of The Plaza’s Home Alone 2–themed experience, which includes a private limo and an ice-cream sundae delivered to your suite.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nSleepless in Seattle (1993)\n\nIt was a delightful concept: Over several years in the early ’90s, a group of actors, including Julianne Moore, Wallace Shawn, and Lynn Cohen, met for periodic rehearsals of Anton Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya, overseen by director Andre Gregory, without intending to actually stage it (l’art pour l’art, indeed). When, after a time, this pseudo-production was opened to tiny pockets of friends and family, Gregory had the idea to record the action, eventually getting the filmmaker Louis Malle (who had directed Shawn and Gregory in another Manhattan masterpiece, 1981’s My Dinner With Andre) onboard. Malle would capture the players at work at the grand but crumbling New Amsterdam Theatre on West 42nd Street, sans costumes or any real set—a perfect confluence of art and life.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nUptown Girls (2003)\n\nAmong the many familiar sights in Uptown Girls, with Dakota Fanning and Brittany Murphy, are the old Bendel’s storefront, Christie’s, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Cooper Hewitt Museum (masquerading, in this case, as a girls school); Sheep’s Meadow and Bow Bridge in Central Park; and the Tea Party ride on Coney Island. That said, a fair warning: Ray’s hypochondria hits a little differently now.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nSaving Face (2004)\n\nIn Saving Face, software engineer turned filmmaker Alice Wu’s feature-length debut, Michelle Krusiec plays Wilhelmina “Wil” Pang, a New York City surgeon negotiating two challenging relationships: one with her conservative mother (Joan Chen), who becomes pregnant out of wedlock and moves in with her; the other with her girlfriend, Vivian (Lynn Chen), whom she’s afraid to kiss in public. Filmed on location in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, the film offers an affecting look at the queer Chinese-American experience—not to mention lots of lovely streetscapes.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nRent (2005)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nFrances Ha (2013)\n\nShot in black and white, Noah Baumbach’s endlessly endearing film, starring and co-written by Greta Gerwig, renders the city with all of the intimacy, romance, and mystery that comes with finding your way there after college.\n\nHow to Watch: Buy on Amazon.\n\nOceans 8 (2018)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on HBO Max.\n\nVogue’s Favorites\n\nWhat Gigi Hadid’s Open Letter to the Paparazzi Means for Celebrity Children\n\nThe Best Romantic Comedies of All Time\n\nWhat I’ve Learned From Dating Every Sign of the Zodiac\n\nThese Are the Best Books to Read in 2021\n\nSign up for Vogue’s shopping newsletter The Get to receive the insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it"
