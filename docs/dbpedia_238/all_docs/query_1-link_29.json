        "text": "We love a great drama. Have zero issues with an ugly-cry tearjerker. And will never say no to an all-time best comedy. But when it comes to the ultimate big-screen, small-screen, any-screen experience, we LIVE for the art of the cinematic reveal, a.k.a. the movie plot twist.\n\nUsually delivered as a fun surprise in the third act, this effective trickery on the part of the screenwriter and director throws viewers for a loop, pulling the rug out from underneath them, and when done exceptionally well, results in that elusive spark every filmmaker tries to achieve: movie magic. Ahead, some of the best plot twists in movies to date. And, yes, there are spoilers.\n\nFor more roundups, check out the scariest horror movies of all time, the most anticipated shows of 2024, and where to stream all the 2024 Oscar nominees.\n\nThe Plot: In town for an interview, Tess arrives at her Airbnb to find it’s been double-booked and is currently occupied by Keith, a kinda nice, but kinda creepy dude who refuses to leave.\n\nThe Twist: Mid-movie, there is a slight genre-shift that adds to the film’s intrigue and layers of twists, but ultimately, the biggest reveal is that it’s not Keith who Tess should fear. It’s the deformed mothering creature being held captive in the dungeon under the rental.\n\nWATCH\n\nThe Plot: While investigating the murder of a man who was found at the base of a mountain, married detective Jang Hae-jun falls in love with Song Seo-rae, the dead guy’s wife.\n\nThe Twist: Yes, Song is the killer, and her husband isn’t the only victim. But the most profound reveal in this gorgeous and devastating romance has to be the ending. Song’s decision to leave—her decision to commit suicide and the ways she decides to leave—sees her dig a hole on the beach, climb in, and patiently wait for the tide to erase her forever.\n\nWATCH\n\nThe Plot: A squad of all-female spelunking enthusiasts dive into a bat-infested cave inhabited also by some very hungry humanoids the director calls Crawlers.\n\nThe Twist: Main character Sarah is your final girl, dragging herself out of the ground and speeding away in her SUV from the bloody entombment she just experienced. Until, not so fast, an apparition of antagonist Juno riding shotgun jerks Sarah out of her own mania and puts her right back into the cave where she really is. The camera fades to black. And we hear the Crawlers drawing near.*\n\n*This is the director’s final cut of the film. U.S. audiences were treated to a diluted ending in theaters.\n\nWatch\n\nThe Plot: Briony Tallis has a crush on the son of her family's housekeeper, Robbie; when she walks in on her sister Cecilia having sex with Robbie, Briony misinterprets the situation. Later that night, she blames Robbie for an assault on her cousin Lola even though she didn't witness the attack. Robbie is sent to prison, later joining the army to fight in World War II, while Cecilia becomes a nurse. Years later, Briony, feeling guilty for derailing Cecilia and Robbie's lives, visits them in their apartment to apologize, but they turn her away.\n\nThe Twist: Cecilia and Robbie never had a life together; Robbie died in the war, while Cecilia died in a bombing in London. As an old woman, Briony wrote a book in which they lived happily ever after as repentance.\n\nWatch"
