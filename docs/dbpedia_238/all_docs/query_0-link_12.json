        "text": "A gangster film starring Robert De Niro sounds like a big win for the movies. But do you know what a bigger win is? A gangster film starring not one but two Robert De Niros. The veteran actor is set to play two major roles in Oscar-winning director Barry Levinson's next project from Warner Bros. Discovery, a feature film titled \"Wise Guys.\" The movie fictionalizes two real-life Italian-American crime bosses from the 20th century. De Niro has more than enough understanding of the genre; he has portrayed multiple gangsters throughout his career, from \"Mean Streets\" to \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Irishman.\" If there's any actor who can play two leading gangster roles in the same movie, it's De Niro, without a doubt.\n\nIt's safe to say that \"Wise Guys\" is shaping up to be a highly-anticipated project â€” so we've compiled everything there is to know about it.\n\nRobert De Niro has played some notable mobsters on the silver screen before, and it appears he's ready to dive back into the genre once again. In Barry Levinson's \"Wise Guys,\" the actor will portray two real-life figures, Italian-American crime bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello. As former contemporaries during America's mafia scene in the mid-20th century, Genovese led an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Costello, which caused him to retire from the crime game.\n\nThis means that in \"Wise Guys,\" Robert De Niro will plot to assassinate Robert De Niro (no, your mind is not playing tricks on you), which sounds rather fun.\n\nJoining De Niro is his colleague from \"The Irishman\" and \"Bronx Tale,\" actress Kathrine Narducci (per Deadline), who is best known for her turn as Charmaine Bucco, Artie Bucco's wife, on HBO's critically-acclaimed series \"The Sopranos.\" The actor is set to star as De Niro's on-screen partner Anna Genovese, who was Vito's second wife. In the mid-20th century, Anna is known to have played a key role in Manhattan's drag bar scene. This is Narducci's second project with Levinson, following the Emmy-nominated \"Wizard of Lies.\"\n\nThe actress was recently seen in Sam Levinson's \"Euphoria,\" in a role as young Fezco's grandmother ... who was also a drug dealer and taught him all about it. If you want someone to play a character who knows to skirt the law, Kathrine Narducci is the perfect choice.\n\nRobert De Niro's forthcoming gangster film will be released at theaters across the globe. \"Wise Guys,\" which has been described as a period piece mobster drama, has Nicholas Pileggi, the man who authored \"Wiseguy,\" the book that inspired \"Goodfellas\" writing the script. Irwin Winkler (known for producing the \"Rocky\" movies as well as \"Goodfellas\") is attached as producer. The movie is the first original production under Warner Bros. Discovery following their merger, and it's shaping up to be a very anticipated project."
