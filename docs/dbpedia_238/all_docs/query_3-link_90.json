        "meta_description": "A list of 59 films compiled on Letterboxd, including The Heiress (1949), The Last of the Line (1914), The Lady of the Dugout (1918), Blood on the Moon (1948) and Red River (1948). About this list: I love the idea of putting different films together into one program. I grew up seeing double features, programs in repertory houses, evenings of avant-garde films in storefront theatres. You always learn something, see something in a new light, because every movie is in conversation with every other movie. The greater the difference between the pictures, the better. Over the years, I’ve been asked to pair my own pictures with older films by other people that have inspired them. The request has come from film festivals, which present the pairings as a program. The terms “inspiration” and “influence” aren’t completely accurate. I think of them as companion films. Sometimes the relationship is based on inspiration. Sometimes it’s the relationships between the characters. Sometimes it’s the spirit of the picture. Sometimes it’s far more mysterious than that. Here is a list of my own films and their companions in cinema history.",

        "text": "Companion to Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nEach one of these pictures was so important to me as I was preparing Killers of the Flower Moon: The Heiress for the relationship between Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift, which was a reference point for Leo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and myself; Last of the Line, which I saw for the first time when I was young, for the presence of real Lakota Natives in many key roles, and for the unusual point of view, which truly expresses the tragedy of Native experience; Lady of the Dug-Out for its authentic portrait of outlaw life, the reality of the settings; Blood on the Moon, a noir Western, for the friendship between Robert Mitchum and Robert Preston, which goes wrong in a way that was close to Leo and Bob De Niro in Killers, and also for the way the actors look in the frame, and the clumsy, grungy, seemingly unchoreographed fight in a low-ceilinged dark cantina, which has always stayed in my mind; Red River because it gave me another angle on the relationship between Leo and Bob; Wild River for the extraordinary look of the picture, and for the key moment where…\n\nCompanion to Personality Crisis: One Night Only\n\nWhen David Tedeschi and I started thinking about how to approach David Johansen’s cabaret performances at the Café Carlyle, we went back to the years before cinema, Paris in the 19th century, Aristide Bruant at Le Chat Noir, the tradition of the “chanson réaliste”. It’s connected with a particular visual style, especially the paintings of Toulouse-Lautrec, who painted Bruant and who lived in that world. So of course we looked to Moulin Rouge, John Huston’s film about Lautrec. Huston told his DP, Oswald Morris, that he wanted the picture to look “like Toulouse-Lautrec had directed it: vivid but subdued, with a smoky hue”. That’s the feeling we were going for. Ellen Kuras handled it beautifully.\n\nI also thought about the New York Underground world, the world that David Johansen had come out of: the beautiful, crazy, exciting experimental pictures made by Jack Smith, Andy Warhol, Ken Jacobs, and the Godfather of it all, Jonas Mekas. Jonas made moves straight from his heart. He brought people together under the umbrella of avant-garde cinema, and he created a big beautiful family of filmmakers. After I showed Mean Streets at The New York Film Festival, there was a knock on my hotel room door. It was Jonas and his brother Adolfas, and they came with peaches and champagne, to welcome me into the family. I’ll never forget it.\n\nCompanion to The Irishman\n\nThe Irishman was of a piece with GoodFellas and Casino in one sense, a very different picture in another sense. It was all about the emotions of the characters, the friendships, the betrayals. It was about the gradual, inevitable unfolding. The three pictures chosen for The Irishman involve very carefully, painstakingly planned criminal enterprises, two heists and an attempted assassination, and in each one everything is very cool, deliberate, quiet throughout: even the violence and the betrayals happen quietly. I actually used a piece of the music from Grisbi for the score.\n\nCompanion to Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\n\nThis was the second picture we made about Bob Dylan. Would it be No Direction Home II? Boring. So what to do? We decided to follow Bob’s lead in his own life and music, and create a film in which you were never quite sure what was reality and what was fiction. And I had a great model in my old friend Abbas Kiarostami’s extraordinary film about Hossain Sabzian, the man who impersonated the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf.\n\nClose-Up deals directly with loneliness and the cinema as a community, a family. That’s what happens when you make a film or a series of films. You become a family. That touched me. Hossein tried to become a filmmaker because of his loneliness, and this community of artists that he wanted so much to be a part of is like the traveling troupe of artists in the Rolling Thunder Revue. They’re the best of family and the worst of family, but a family all the same. Close-Up really represents that.\n\nCompanion to George Harrison: Living in the Material World\n\nAgain, a documentary? No. A portrait, woven from non-fiction elements and Georges Harrison’s own music. And his spiritual orientation.\n\nThe River opens with women making a rangoli, a design painted with a mixture of rice flower and water, that welcomes us to the picture but also to the beauty of the culture itself, the same beauty that George discovered a decade later, that informed his music and changed his life. That beauty was always present in my mind as I was making the film.\n\nCompanion to Public Speaking\n\nWith Fran Lebowitz, the writer, cultural commentator and raconteur, I thought: what do you do but just unleash her before the camera? She’s completely uninhibited, uncensored, it flows out and she’s often speaking the truth. You might not agree with it, but it’s the truth. That’s exactly what Hara did with Kenzō Okuzaki, who he just follows around as he tries to right what he sees as the wrongs of WWII. Fran is funnier.\n\nCompanion to Shutter Island\n\nI showed Leo a few pictures—post-war, noir—to prepare for Shutter Island, and the one that seems to have made the biggest impression on him was this one—the tone, the cool unfolding of the action and the imagery, the way that Robert Mitchum looks in the frame… Within the film, there’s something mysterious about the past itself as it unfolds in the flashbacks. I felt this even at the age of 6, when I saw the picture for the first time… on a double bill with Bambi! For me, it doesn’t have a beginning or a middle or an end—I’ve always felt like I could enter it anywhere, at any point, and experience it like a dream. In a sense, there’s a metaphysical level to the movie, in that it deals with the past as a presence, a force. I had that very much in mind when I made Shutter Island.\n\nCompanion to Gangs of New York\n\nSam Fuller’s pictures had a powerful effect on me when I was young. Yes, the acting and the dialogue are blunt, unsophisticated; yes, the budgets are dirt cheap, the stories are pulp. But at the core of Fuller’s pictures is pure cinema. This is one of his earliest, most personal, and best, and the force of it was what I was trying to get at with Gangs of New York.\n\nCompanion to Casino\n\nFirst of all, it’s a matter of style. I wanted GoodFellas and Casino to blast out of the screen and come right at you, just like in Peckinpah’s picture. We’re in the outlaw universe: swaggering, lawless, steal and steal more, kill or be killed. The guys in The Wild Bunch have a code of honor: at the end, they have to go back to get their friend Angel and they know it’ll be a bloodbath. The guys in Casino? Like one of the mob bosses says, “Why take a chance?” In a sense, they have their own code of honor, and their own system, and it originates far back into the Sicilian past. But unlike the outlaws in Peckinpah’s picture, the mob bosses aren’t glorified by their sense of honor—it’s something that’s just between them.\n\nCompanion to The Age of Innocence\n\nHow do you film the American past—in this case, the world of Old New York? In our story, all that wealth, all those fine possessions and exquisite manners, become a prison house. The characters are trapped in all that material wealth. In that sense, Visconti’s masterpiece was a direct inspiration.\n\nBut we also looked to The Heiress (at the top of this list as it’s also a companion to Killers of the Flower Moon), the absolute emotional brutality of the picture. For the Ralph Richardson character of the father, it doesn’t really matter at all who is in love with whom, as long as it doesn’t disrupt the society. It’s more about keeping the society and the bloodline clean, not to have interlopers like Morris, played by Montgomery Clift, come in and try to marry his daughter Catherine, played by Olivia de Havilland.\n\nCompanion to Made in Milan\n\nNot many people have seen Made in Milan, a film I made about Giorgio Armani.\n\nAgain, a documentary? I wanted something that had the elegance of the movies that inspired Giorgio, in particular the movies of Cary Grant. I could have chosen a few—Notorious or North by Northwest, for instance—but I went with this extremely unusual Joseph L. Mankiewicz picture.\n\nCompanion to The King of Comedy\n\nI love comedy and comedians, the very fine line between humor and absolute bitterness. I’ve used a lot of comedians in my pictures, come to think of it: Albert Brooks, Don Rickles, Alan King, Sandra Bernhard, Catherine O’Hara, Sacha Baron Cohen, and many others. Station Six-Sahara is not a comedy, but it is bitterly funny: every laugh is on the knife-edge of desperation and despair. It’s the tone we were going for. Every laugh had to be excruciatingly uncomfortable. It’s a study in psychological intimidation.\n\nCompanion to Taxi Driver\n\nI saw this low budget independent picture about a hired killer on a double bill with The Journey by Anatole Litvak—I went to see the second, but I came away thinking about the first. The spareness, the single-mindedness of the killer (played by Vince Edwards), the ritualized quality of his preparation and his actions… it haunted me and came directly to mind when I made Taxi Driver.\n\nPerry Botkin’s score, the sound of his guitar, has had a formidable influence on me (I believe that Botkin was himself influenced by the Anton Karas zither score for The Third Man). It’s where the tango guitar theme in Howard Shore’s score for The Departed came from.\n\nCompanion to Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore\n\nTechnicolor—the real 3-strip IB Technicolor—was an amazing process, and it’s extremely difficult to replicate the effect with modern film stocks or digital cameras: the colors were tactile, vibrant, overflowing, and they heightened everything.\n\nTake Care of My Little Girl, made in the ’40s, is set on a college campus. It’s about a girl joining her mother’s old sorority. The story had all these odd college rituals of American white society, but they weren’t cute or fun. The picture seemed to be actually criticizing the establishment and the culture of exclusivism in sororities and fraternities, the cruelty. That’s where the title comes from, the pain of sending your children out into the world to a place where values are inverted. It’s interesting to see a film being made at that time that criticized the Ivy league WASPish world. It becomes an unexpectedly serious picture, and the Technicolor gives it an almost perverse, David Lynch feel.\n\nCompanion to Italianamerican\n\nShirley Clarke’s picture is all about what happens in the frame. You’re just with this man, as he speaks to the camera, tells the story of his life and his dreams, reacts to comments and asides from behind the camera. You’re focused on him as a person, the stories he tells, his body language, his behavior. In a way, Portrait of Jason broke down the barriers between fiction and documentary, acting and behavior. It was liberating.\n\nCompanion to Who’s That Knocking at My Door?\n\nShadows was the movie that told me: no more excuses, get started now, make your own movies. The Bohemian world of the picture was far from my own life, but Cassavetes’ film didn’t want to be imitated—it wanted to inspire you to make you own pictures from your own lived experience. It demolished the idea that moviemaking had to be expensive and monolithic and technically perfect—if you had something to say and you said it, by any means necessary, that was the most important thing. Shadows was made 100% independently. Once I saw it, I was ready to go."
