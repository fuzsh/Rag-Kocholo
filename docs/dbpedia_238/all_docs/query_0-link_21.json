        "text": "New gangster film, Wise Guys, directed by Barry Levinson and starring Robert De Niro, is set to film in Cincinatti.\n\nBacked by Warner Bros., Wise Guys follows Italian American crime bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, who ran their respective families during the 20th century. In 1957, Genovese tried (and failed) to assassinate Costello, who was ultimately injured and atempted to retire from the mafia. De Niro is expected to portray the two main characters.\n\nDe Niro and Levinson previously worked together on Wag the Dog, Sleeper, HBO series The Wizard of Lies, and What Just Happened.\n\nNicholas Pileggi, the co-writer of Martin Scorseseâ€™s crime epic Goodfellas, which starred De Niro, is writing the screenplay for Wise Guys. While Irwin Winkler, a producer on Goodfellas, will serve as a producer."
