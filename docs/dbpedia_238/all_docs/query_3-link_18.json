Cannell & Frank Lupo.\n\nThe show aired from September 16, 1987, to December 8, 1990, lasting for four seasons & 75 episodes.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe series followed Vincent \"Vinnie\" Terranova, an undercover agent of the OCB (Organized Crime Bureau), a fictional division of the FBI.\n\n\"Wiseguy\" kept its focus on both the mechanics of being deep undercover and the consequences of the protagonist's actions.\n\nCast[]\n\nKen Wahl as Vincent \"Vinnie\" Terranova\n\nJonathan Banks as Frank McPike\n\nJim Byrnes as Daniel Benjamin \"Lifeguard\" Burroughs\n\nGerald Anthony as Father Pete Terranova\n\nElsa Raven as Carlotta Terranova (Aiuppo)\n\nKen Jenkins as Paul Beckstead\n\nDwight Ross as Mark Cermak\n\nKevin Spacey as Mel Profitt\n\nMartika as Dahlia Mendez\n\nCancellation[]\n\n\"Wiseguy\" was cancelled after one additional episode (with Billy Dee Williams as a guest star) aired.\n\nThe program was never the strongest ratings draw, despite the positive feedback from critics.\n\nThe loss of Ken Wahl combined with the move to a traditionally low rated Saturday night spot depleted the ratings further and the series came to its end after 75 episodes.\n\nKen Wahl said that the entire fourth season concept was \"ridiculous\" because it got away from what the had been about, whereas before the show was more character driven, CBS wanted to make the show more of an action-based crime drama and Wahl felt that he could not continue in the role if that was where they wanted to go.\n\nAccolades[]"
