        "text": "12 producers from across the whole of the UK will partake in the six month professional development programme\n\nSelected producers demonstrate a broad range of talent, approaches and styles, including those working in television and documentary\n\nBFI NETWORK announces the 12 up and coming producers taking part in the latest edition of INSIGHT. A six month professional development programme with a focus on supporting underrepresented talent, INSIGHT aims to equip producers at a formative stage of their career with the confidence, skills and knowledge to realise their creative ambitious and to build sustainable businesses.\n\nThe selected producers (listed below), who are based across the UK, all have a strong track record in producing short form work with a compelling development slate of long form work. The practical programme will be delivered by Screen Yorkshire, led by CEO Caroline Cooper Charles and Senior Talent Exec Jo Schofield, and benefit from a host of experienced industry professionals. INSIGHT hones in on how the producer’s role sits within the core creative team – and how that can change throughout development, production and post – and crucially how the role is pivotal in finance, sales and distribution.\n\nMade up of five core modules, INSIGHT will run as a combination of in-person, online and hybrid events. At least half of all in-person activity will take place outside of London, covering subjects ranging from financing, marketing, distribution and business planning. The cohort will also have the opportunity to take part in the European Film Market in Berlin.\n\nReece Cargan is an RTS award-winning producer and founder of Bombito productions, a Scottish production company.

In August 2022, Reece was selected by Screen International as a Rising Star Scotland.
