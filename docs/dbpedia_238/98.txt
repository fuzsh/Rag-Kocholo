Hollywood icon Robert De Niro is coming to Cincinnati to film the upcoming gangster drama "Wise Guys."

The film's producers are looking to cast extras in the Cincinnati area, "especially anybody who is of Italian descent or who looks like they could be a NY mobster in the 1950s," Lynn Meyers, a local casting director, wrote in a Facebook post on Friday.

According to Variety, the movie will follow two feuding Italian American crime bosses during the mid-20th century, with De Niro expected to play both main characters.

The film reunites De Niro with director Barry Levinson, as the pair previously worked together on "The Wizard of Lies," "What Just Happened," along with earlier films "Wag the Dog" and "Sleepers," Deadline reported in August.

The film's setting and tone is a return to form for De Niro, whose credits include critically acclaimed gangster flicks "The Godfather Part II," "Goodfellas," and "The Irishman."
