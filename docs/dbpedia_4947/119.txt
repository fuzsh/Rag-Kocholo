WELLINGTON, New Zealand - Clayton Lewis has departed Auckland City FC to take up a one-year contract with the Wellington Phoenix.

The 23-year-old Lewis made 67 appearances and scored 18 goals for Auckland City FC over two spells.

The All Whites midfielder spent two seasons playing for Scunthorpe United FC in English football’s League Two division.

Lewis also has significant All Whites experiences under this belt, having made 14 international appearances during his career – including scoring four goals while playing in the New Zealand Under-20 team and participating in both the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.

The 14-cap international becomes the 14th player to pass through Auckland City FC to the Wellington Phoenix since the 2007-08 season behind Ben Sigmund, Michael Boxall, Jacob Spoonley, Ian Hogg, Albert Riera, Tom Doyle, Oliver Sail, Matt Ridenton, Jason Hicks, Tim Payne, Callum McCowatt, Te Atawhai Hudson-Wihongi and Roy Krishna.

Six players have made the reverse journey in the past with David Mulligan, Sean Lovemore, Cam Lindsay, Logan Rogerson, Spoonley and Riera all turning out for the Navy Blues following their time with the Wellington Phoenix.

During his time with Auckland City FC, Lewis won one ISPS Handa Premiership title, three league titles, two OFC Champions Leagues and two NZF Charity Cups.
