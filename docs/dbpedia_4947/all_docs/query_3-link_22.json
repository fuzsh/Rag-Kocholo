        "text": "Malasia\n\nAge 13\n\nMalasia loves drawing, food, and playing volleyball. She also loves wearing necklaces and bracelets that represent herself. Her favorite accessory is her cell phone. She has one dog that lives with her dad; it is a black-and-white pitbull with brown eyes. Malasia lives to journal. She also likes to listen to music in her free time and is on a volleyball team at her school. Malasia is very passionate about her religion.\n\nMy Crying Shame Of Injustice\n\nOne day in third grade, I sat by a boy, Chris. Another boy had a really cool rubber band bracelet. Chris stole the bracelet. The boy told the teacher about the stolen bracelet—and the teacher assumed I had stolen the bracelet. The boy sat between me and Chris, but he didn't see Chris take the bracelet. The teacher humiliated me and searched my desk. Although he didn’t find the bracelet in my desk, he called my mom and told her that I had hidden the bracelet.\n\nJust because I’m black doesn’t mean I’m misbehaved or smart-mouthed. I have been stereotyped because of my race. I have dealt with injustice in many settings—this is one.\n\nWhen I got home, my mom waited for me to tell her what had happened. As soon as I walked through the door, I dropped my things on my bed. I dashed into the kitchen where my mom was and sat faster than a bullet. I was loud and heavy footed on my way into the kitchen.\n\nI quickly said, “Momma, guess what happened today?” She turned her head and calmly said, “You stole a bracelet?” with a questioning face. I replied, “No!” She said, “Okay,” with a hesitant nod. I eventually convinced her that I didn't steal the bracelet. She knew that I wasn’t a thief.\n\nThe next day at school, the teacher made me apologize to the boy. I did, but it wasn’t a sincere apology because I didn’t do anything wrong. The teacher then made me pull a chair up to his desk and sit there for the rest of the month until he got to know me. It made me feel very sad. I felt very ashamed about how I was treated. Later, I became angry at the thought. I felt rage about being treated that way. I was glad my mom trusted me and believed me.\n\nInjustice is something that bothers me and I want people to know that it's okay to tell someone how you feel. It's okay to tell the person who treated you unfairly how they made you feel. I watch a show about injustice that has many scenes of people treating others unfairly; there are even people who are scared to talk about how they have been treated. It's called Law and Order. I like this show because there's always justice being displayed.\n\nImagine feeling broken from a situation.\n\nI don’t like when people are falsely accused. That’s one of the reasons I've wanted to be a lawyer since I was five years old. I have even thought about applying to high schools because of their law and government academies.\n\nI can imagine myself in fifteen years standing at a podium of power with a white button-down blouse, my shirt elegantly tucked into my plain black pants. I am speaking to persuade.\n\nAya\n\nAge 13\n\nAya Alzubaidy lives in Louisville, Kentucky with a big family. She likes to read and write. Her biggest future goal is to publish twelve books and be a successful dentist or pediatrician. Her favorite food is tacos and her favorite color is blue or purple. She gets inspired to write from the Young Authors Greenhouse people and her favorite dessert is ice cream.\n\nJust Because\n\nJust because I’m a girl doesn’t mean I’m not capable or responsible. Girls are always underestimated and expected to look perfect.\n\nJust because I am Muslim doesn’t mean I want to hurt you or that I go to bomb-making class.\n\nI remember watching the news and seeing people say that muslims are a threat to others.\n\nJust because I’m not sharing my opinion doesn’t mean I don’t have one.\n\nI remember people speak but never listen and understand. Instead they talk over you and never give you a chance. They don’t open their ears and brain, but always their mouths.\n\nJust because I am “different” doesn’t mean I don’t deserve what everyone else does.\n\nI remember looking at a survey and the first question was about race. None of the answers fit me. But I guess I should just check “other” because that’s what I am, right? Just “other.”\n\nI remember people choosing others automatically over me because I don’t look like I know English. Because a piece of clothing on my head defines who I am, including my language.\n\nJust because you say there is justice, doesn’t mean there really is.\n\nHate is a hit with tight fists.\n\nHate is boiling water.\n\nHate is a thief—stealing confidence and comfort.\n\nI remember justice, fairness, and equality being promised to everyone. But is it there? Is it a broken promise? They say, “All men are created equal.” Do they mean, all wealthy white men are created best? No matter their actions or opinions?\n\nI remember getting into a car accident with someone who turned the wrong way. My mom was the one driving, so she had to talk with the lady who hit her. When the cops came, they didn’t believe my mother because she was wearing a hijab and we were too. The woman who hit us assumed we didn’t know english, so she just started talking about us to the cop, saying it was our fault.\n\nI remember the answer. There is no such thing as justice. But there would be if people stopped judging. If people listen to understand. If people understand that we are people and deserve the same privileges.\n\nIf I could pass any law, I would pass the law saying that money and looks don’t come first. I would put the importance of life first.\n\nRokaia\n\nAge 14\n\nRokaia is the daughter of two Iraqis, but she was born and raised in Louisville, KY. She has been living in the same house her whole life. As the fourth out of five children, she has three sisters, one brother, and two parents. She shares a room with her crazy and wild younger sister named Sarah. Born on October 13, 2005, Rokaia is a 14-year-old eighth grader. Rokaia really wants to travel and would love to visit Iraq again. When she grows up, Rokaia plans on becoming a lawyer. Her favorite color is olive green and she despises the color orange. Her favorite author is Stephen King and she is currently reading his book “The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger.” She is quite a feminist and believes that all people should be treated equally.\n\nA So-Called Home And What It Should Be\n\nLiving in a toxic environment should never be normal for people, but it is for my family in America. An environment where you wouldn’t want to be different. A place where being different is bad. A place where racism and discrimination are normal. A home is a place where I should be able to sit comfortably without feeling scared or unsafe. A place where one can stay with their family without having to worry about the possibility of someone breaking in or targeting them. I can’t even lay in my bed without thinking that someone could break into my house any second—thinking that someone would target me specifically because I am not the stereotypical white, or because I wear a hijab that says “I am Muslim.”\n\nI am from red roses—buying them every time my mom comes back from Iraq and buying them for each family member’s birthday. From growing them in our front yard to giving them to loved ones. The roses my mother loves and the ones she dedicates her time to. The love it expresses along with the time it takes. From watering the plants every other day, to making sure they get enough sunlight. Making sure to use the right soil, and even the correct amount of water. Going to Iraq myself and being the one that receives the roses. They are similar to humans. They come in many colors and shapes, bright and dark. Looking at a rose makes me feel better, the beauty just gives me a more positive vibe. They are filled with many memories that I cherish and feel make roses even better. I wish to be able to go to Iraq again, which also means coming back to roses again.\n\nI am Iraqi. I was born in America, but I consider myself Iraqi. There are people there. It’s not a country of danger. There may have been a war, but the country is beautiful, and one-of-a-kind. I don’t mean the people; I said the country. Being able to go and not experiencing racism or discrimination. A country surrounded by my fellow Muslims. My beautiful brothers and sisters. The sound of people selling food on the streets. The smell of gasoline and burning tires. Not because of conflict, it's just considered normal there. The taste of Arabic tea in my mouth. The coffee that they choose to drink at night, and the cup noodles we’d stay up eating. The way everything is unique—from what you see to what you smell. Iraq is beautiful. It isn’t a deadzone of sand and scorpions. This country you don’t see is not a literal desert. It’s home to many. It’s home to roads, buildings, and people like me. I am trying to say the country is as much of a home to me as America is to you. The cities are lit up at night, sparkling with many amazing lights. There are malls, grocery stores, and parks, too. The culture and the way people dress. The many colors of the rainbow, all seen at once. The grocery stores that you can find inside the mall. The smell of bread in the streets and the smoke of the never-ending flames.\n\nI do not look American, but I was born here. Born and raised in the same house for most of my life, in the same city and state. I live in America, which is where I am from wearing my religion on my head, showing my beliefs like they’re written on my forehead. I am from receiving compliments for my hijab, while also receiving insults. Being able to wear my hijab without anyone commenting or saying something about it. This is what I wish for. This is why I am from self-love. From then and still now. I might fall off track sometimes, but there is nothing that I love more than myself. Even if that means ignoring all the hate comments about how I look or act. People calling me “fat,” “ugly,” or even “short.” I have built myself up to know and believe that these comments don’t matter as much as I originally thought they did. These are just simple ways that people can see you. Not all people think of me this way, but there are some that do. The only opinion that matters is my own. I’ll never let your negative energy in, and I’ll never let my positive energy out.\n\nI might not look like the stereotypical, white person that is considered an “American,” but I can speak English. Fluently actually, the same way you would expect a white person to. I go to a normal, public school in Louisville with people of many races and religions.\n\nJust because I cover my head, it doesn't mean I don’t have hair. This is just some kind of stereotypical thing that people believe. They look at me and think “She has no hair. That’s why she covers her head.” When in reality, I cover my head for religious reasons, not because of hair. Trust me, hair is one thing I have a lot of, and yet I still cover my head. There are also people that’ll say things like “Is there a bomb under there?” or “Are you gonna bomb us?” This is what I consider an insult. I won’t be able to tell if you're genuine or just joking around. These are ideas that people put in their head when they see someone that isn’t white and isn’t showing lots of skin. They always see them as a threat, and that’s because they are unfamiliar with it. Even though you may see me as a threat, I’m really not. I come from a religion that revolves around love and peace. I have based my life on this religion, which means my life also revolves around love and peace. I just don’t look the same way as you.\n\nI’m waiting for the day where I can walk outside without thinking someone will try to pull my hijab off, jump me, or even shoot me. Until then, I will continue to wait and pray. I’ll pray for that day to come as soon as possible. While doing that I will continue to tune out all people who insult me and try to protect myself from anything that is coming. I hope that you can do this also. Whether it is you praying or you preparing—I will support you. In the end, I will always have myself—and that's all that matters.\n\nTeziah\n\nAge 15\n\nTeziah has lived in Louisville her whole life. They claim that she is a poet. She likes Sprite and buffalo wings. Her future goal is to be a pediatric nurse. Most of the time, she’s asleep. She loves to give her friends and family good advice. She also loves to eat food. This project helped Teziah express herself through writing and also everyone can tell how she feels because of her tone. This experience helped Teziah realize that poetry is a great way to express her feelings about issues that matter in her community.\n\nLife of Police Brutality\n\nIsn’t it the police’s job to keep everybody safe?\n\nIs it their duty to kill unarmed black people?\n\nIs it an officer's duty to keep everyone safe?\n\nBut how?\n\nAnd they are killing us, black people.\n\nAtatiana Koquice Jefferson, a 28 year old woman, shot by a white officer, shot in her home in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nHow are we supposed to trust our police officers when they are killing us?\n\nThis is society and this is not the way it should be.\n\nHow does police brutality even begin?\n\nDo they grow up to be like this?\n\nMothers have to bury their own child before their child has to bury them.\n\nCan you imagine having to bury your child first?\n\nCan you imagine losing a child or loved one to a police officer?\n\nPut yourself in a black woman’s shoes.\n\nTore up. Broken down. Dirty. Broken bottoms.\n\nHow can we stop this?\n\nHow would white people feel if we switched it around and started beating on white people for no reason?\n\nHow would white people feel if we killed them for no reason?\n\nDevon Bailey, 19 years old shot in the back by police on August 3, 2019 in Colorado Springs.\n\nChristopher Whitfield, 31 years old, shot by a police officer in Louisiana.\n\nJamarion Robinson, 26 years old, shot seventy-six times after refusing to open the door of his girlfriend’s home in East Point, Georgia.\n\nBrandon Webber, 20 years old , shot sixteen-twenty times by U.S. Marshalls in Memphis.\n\nD’ettrick Griffin, 18 years old, shot multiple times by officers. D’ettrick was unarmed.\n\nTrayvon Martin, you might know about this one, 17 years old, shot and killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, February 26, 2012 in Sanford, Florida.\n\nMichael Brown, 18 years old, an unarmed black teenager, fatally shot on August 9, 2014 by officer Darren Wilson.\n\nLaquan Mcdonald, 17 years old, shot sixteen times by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke.\n\nSandra Bland, 28 years old, taken to jail over a traffic stop.\n\nEric Garner, 44 years old, choked to death by multiple police officers, accused of selling single cigarettes.\n\nHow many more do I have to name before y’all understand?\n\nDo you feel how we feel now?\n\nThese people were\n\nfathers\n\nmothers\n\nsons\n\ndaughters\n\nbrothers\n\nsisters\n\nuncles\n\naunts\n\ncousins\n\nsomeone\n\nWill this ever end?"
