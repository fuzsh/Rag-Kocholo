        "text": "After the earthquake hit, two ambulance cars were sent by Wellington Free Ambulance to help the city in whatever capacity was needed. Once in Hawke’s Bay, Superintendent Roffe was designated controller of the fleet of rescue vehicles, managing the movement of casualties who were evacuated by rail to other parts of the country. Once people reached Wellington the remainder of the Wellington Free fleet provided transport to hospitals and homes.\n\nJoe Gibson was one of our young first aiders who made the journey to the traumatised city, a difficult journey as many of the roads were destroyed. For a week Joe and his colleagues worked round the clock transporting the injured from the ruins of Napier City to the temporary hospital that has been set up under the grandstand at the racecourse. They were called to Napier whilst at work so they didn’t even have a change of clothes or food supplies.\n\nThe Navy’s contribution to help with the earthquake was incredible, providing a well-organised force of helpers, equipment and communications to aid the devastated city. A series of field kitchens sprang up, to provide a constant supply of hot tea and hot meals to those who needed it, including Joe and his colleagues.\n\nFor a young first aider it was invaluable experience in the management of a wide range of injuries, and at the end of a long week Joe and his colleagues had to be forced to withdraw themselves and their grubby clothes from the field.\n\nReference: A.W Beasley, Borne Free, 1995\n\nBack in 1944 Kathryn Arthurs was only four years old when her dad joined as a member of the men’s auxiliary at Wellington Free Ambulance. Kathryn believes there might have been a focused effort on recruiting volunteer drivers during the war to ensure they had enough staff to man all posts.\n\nHarry Alfred Arthurs worked elsewhere during the day and was a volunteer driver in the evenings. His job was to get poorly patients from A to B as quickly and as safely as possible. Drivers were trained in basic first aid but as a single crewed vehicle it was less about treatment at the scene and more about getting them to hospital to receive the appropriate medical care from doctors and nurses.\n\nTo ensure Harry and his fellow drivers knew how to transport patients with broken bones, cuts and other such injuries they needed to update their first aid training from time to time. To make things as realistic as possible staff regularly recruited family members to be ‘dummy patients’.\n\nKathryn remembers going along to the old boat shed on the waterfront, Wellington Free’s original base, with her brother who was a few years older than her. She recalls lines of mattresses down each side of the building, ready for the dummy patients to play sick. “It was a big affair with 20 or so models, both adults and children played as dummy patients with broken bones and cut heads. They practiced on us with bandages and splints and we had to pretend to be poorly,” Kathryn recalls.\n\n“I don’t think there was any formal education for ambulance drivers, just passion for caring and a willingness to learn. We went down to the boat shed two or three times a year and there was always someone official looking with a clipboard coming round and ticking things off, so it must have been their formal assessment of skills to ensure they were competent enough to be out on the road.”\n\nCaptivated by this experience Kathryn decided very early on she was going to become a nurse, and that she did. Starting on 1 April 1958 as a registered nurse she retired 38 years later in 1996.\n\nTraining for paramedics is very different now! It takes a three year degree and time on the job to become a qualified paramedic. However, the training back in 1944 was more than sufficient when attending the 20,975 cases the service saw that year!\n\nTragically ambulance Officer Sydney Barlow lost his life trying to save two boys trapped and overcome by carbon monoxide fumes in a tunnel in Khandallah. Sydney is the only Wellington Free paramedic to ever die in the course of duty.\n\nDenis Smithson volunteered as a member of the Wellington Free Men’s Auxiliary during the 1960s. Honorary staff double crewed with an ambulance officer; they had basic first aid knowledge but were not trained to drive vehicles. They assisted as an extra pair of hands when needed and did lots of jobs at the station such as cleaning vehicles and sorting equipment. Being on the road as an honorary officer was the most valuable experience for any aspiring ambulance officer.\n\nHaving just finished his carpentry apprenticeship, Denis decided that being an ambulance officer was really what he wanted to do. He got a job as a chauffeur for the New Zealand Post Office, driving everything from cars to trucks so he could gain experience driving big vehicles ahead of applying to join the ambulance service as a full time member of the team.\n\nDenis had been an honorary officer for about a year when he was dispatched to a call in Khandallah:\n\n“I can remember being dispatched with Syd Barlow, to a call that some children and adults were trapped in a water board tunnel at Khandallah. On the way up Syd appeared to know where the tunnel was and asked me when we got there to come up to the tunnel entrance with him, I was to get the OxyViva and Syd got the first aid kit.\n\nOn arrival Syd assessed the scene discovering that possibly some fire officers, police officers and civilians had gone into the tunnel before we arrived.\n\nHe asked me to report back via the radio that we required extra assistance. I informed them that Syd had gone into the tunnel with the Oxyviva and I was going to set up a first aid post at the rear of the ambulance.\n\nControl advised me there was another ambulance on its way and I was to stand by the radio and relay what was going on at the scene”.\n\nThe official incident report noted that when the Superintendent arrived at the tunnel entrance there was a boy and a Police Officer in a collapsed state. The boy was instantly taken to hospital and the Superintendent called for additional ambulance coverage, additional oxygen, wooden poled stretchers and other equipment, which was immediately forthcoming.\n\n“I think I remember two fire officers coming out of the tunnel who were immediately brought to our first aid post. The second ambulance then arrived with Ambulance Officer Ray Edwards and Honorary N Hardy.\n\nRay told me that there were no other ambulances available at the moment and that I should load the two fire officers into the ambulance and proceed to Wellington Hospital. Back then auxiliary members didn’t drive the ambulances, we just weren’t trained and therefore not allowed. However, there with no other ambulances available at the time and an unknown number of patients were still in the tunnel, so I proceeded to hospital.\n\nWhilst Denis was transporting patients to hospital, a distinct lack of communication from within the tunnel meant a growing concern for those inside.\n\n“I returned to the incident and remember the fire brigade brought a large blower up to the face of the tunnel, to help clear the air”.\n\nAs the fan worked it was noticeable that a current of air was getting through and some members of the rescue party returned in a semi-collapsed state. Unfortunately Officer Barlow was found collapsed in the tunnel as he was giving oxygen to one of the boys.\n\nThe tragedy touched the hearts of Wellingtonians who sent messages of condolence and support to Wellington Free Ambulance. It was quickly decided to launch an appeal that would fund a memorial ambulance in Sydney Barlow’s name. With the generous support of the community and local businesses, £3,407 was quickly raised. The Sydney Barlow memorial ambulance became a reality and Wellington continued to remember Syd and his incredible act of one-of-a-kindness.\n\nIn the Queen’s Birthday Honour List one year after the tragedy. Sydney was awarded a posthumous Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct.\n\nFollowing the incident Denis continued as member of the Men’s Auxiliary for a further two years before joining the permanent staff. He says “it cemented my dreams to be an Ambulance Officer for Wellington Free Ambulance, and later the Ambulance Service of New South Wales. I retired 13 years ago after over 40 years’ service”. Thanks for being one-of-a-kind Denis.\n\nReference: A.W. Beasley, Borne Free, 1995\n\nAs the morning continued the weather got worse; roofs detached from houses, trees blew over and power lines toppled. As Wellington was battered by this ferocious storm, the inter-island ferry T. E. V Wahine was starting to enter the harbor as winds were hitting over 100 miles per hour.\n\nOnce it reached Pencarrow Head, the 8,994 tonne vessel hit with a number of problems; it’s radars failed, a huge wave carried it into Barrett Reef where the main body was the vessel was torn by the rocks, the starboard propeller was lost and the port engine failed. Both anchors were dropped but with the waters as rough as they were it took some time before they held steady.\n\nAs each huge wave passed under the Wahine it brought the ship crashing down into the reef, inflicting more damage. When the wind eased, the tide dropped very rapidly and the sudden outpouring of pent-up water caused the Wahine to swing and rake on a heavy list.\n\nBy the early afternoon Wahine’s 734 passengers and crew were ordered to put on their life jackets and abandon ship, but with the severe list, only four of the eight lifeboats could be used.\n\nA number of passengers jumped into the sea, some were picked up by lifeboats and other vessels, but sadly others drowned, died of exposure, or were swept over to the eastern shore colliding with the rocks. Eastbourne was the scene of greatest tragedy with survivors unable to reach the shore and rescue volunteers unable to reach them. The disaster claimed 51 lives.\n\nThe tragedy inspired many acts of heroism and bravery that day. Passengers and crew helped others before themselves; other vessels engaged in valiant rescue efforts and numerous individuals struggled against the surf and harsh weather conditions to save wreck victims.\n\nAware of the severe weather conditions in the early morning Wellington Free Ambulance had called in nearly all of their off duty staff as they anticipated a day that would bring a number of accident and injury cases. At this point the Wahine was under no serious threat but Wellington Free had already attended 43 cases in the first few hours of the day due to the severe weather conditions. When Police advised of the imminent danger of the Wahine rolling over six ambulances were immediately dispatched to Seatoun Wharf and two ambulances headed to Eastbourne. Along with members of the men’s auxiliary, Red Cross volunteers and other local volunteers a dressing station was established at Eastbourne and a co-ordination point at the Inter-Island Ferry Wharf. 212 cases were logged by Wellington Free relating to the Wahine disaster.\n\nOn Wahine Day, Wellingtonians commemorate those who died and remember with gratitude the courage and initiative of those who took part in the rescue operations.\n\nReference: Wellington Museum\n\nStarting as an ambulance officer in 1970, Richard has been part of the road staff team for 47 years, which is a remarkable feat!\n\nHis motivation to get involved in ambulance work grew from an early interest in First Aid. He started as a volunteer with the Red Cross and later with Wellington Free, since then the ambulance service has been his whole career.\n\nWhen Richard started the job was basically “a glorified First Aid role” he explains. “We had no invasive interventions – not even any pain relief. The only piece of equipment that elevated us, marginally, above a First Aider was a portable oxygen set that was able to administer oxygen and mechanically ventilate a patient,” says Richard. Back then an ambulance officer’s role was mostly to recognise that a patient needed hospital care – and take them there.\n\nTraining in the 1970s certainly wasn’t the same as it is now either. The role was so different “back then we quickly learned all there was to know about ambulance work – because there wasn’t much to know. Later, as we became much better trained and achieved paramedic qualifications we realised how little we actually knew when we first started,” says Richard.\n\nTo be a paramedic in 2017 it takes a three year degree and time on the job before you’re fully qualified. However in Richard’s time at Wellington Free, the organisation and its staff came on leaps and bounds. Wellington Free introduced the Cardiac Care scheme which saw care in a pre-hospital setting – basic resuscitation drugs and defibrillators. “We acquired Entonox, Scoop stretchers; and Bedford ambulances – the start of the vehicle design concept we still have today,” says Richard.\n\nAmbulances in the 1970s were pretty different to what you see on the roads now too. “The most noticeable difference between then and now was that the ambulances had limited height, meaning you had to crouch over to move around in the back,” says Richard.\n\nAs well as not being able to stand in the back you couldn’t access the patient compartment from the drivers seat either. “If you needed to check your patient on the journey you would have to stop, get out, go around to the back and through the back doors.” remembers Richard.\n\nVolunteers, or ‘auxiliaries’ The service was pretty small with a total of 28 staff members when Richard started. However, ambulance officers were supported by volunteers, named ‘auxiliaries’ back then. They were able to provide support and an extra pair of hands on evening and weekend shifts before Wellington Free introduced double crewing.\n\nAlong with his colleagues Tony Nicholas and John Wells, who have completed 46 years and 28 years’ service respectively, they all retired at the end of June. They each have a cheeky story or two to tell from their time at Wellington Free but all say the thing they’ve loved the most about the role is the opportunity, and privilege, to help others.\n\n“I like the idea of knowing what to do in an emergency and being able to help when it mattered,” says Richard. The 1970s were a nostalgic time for Richard and he says he misses them. Wellington Free will certainly miss him.\n\nThank you for being one-of-a-kind.\n\nFollowing a tremendous fundraising campaign and regional street appeal the Wellington community pulled together to help with the costs of the new building. Thousands of supporters joined the Building’s Appeal and ‘bought a brick’ to make a tangible contribution to their local ambulance station. Some of those bricks are still visible in the reception area of Headquarters.\n\nAs with any big move it didn’t all happen at once. A Maori ceremony to bless the new Davis Street building was held on 22 December 1993 but the crews, their vehicles and the Control Room (now known as the Communications Centre) didn’t settle into their new home until 26 January 1994. Thanks to meticulous planning the move happened seamlessly, and if anyone called for an ambulance on moving day they would be none the wiser that their call was now being taken in another building in a different part of town.\n\nOn 8 February 1994, the Service was honoured by having the Prince of Wales visit the building to have a tour of the various departments and meet the staff. In front of an audience of 800 invited guests, Prince Charles officially opened the new building by unveiling a commemorative stone, which is located in the entrance foyer next to the bronze plaque of our founder, Sir Charles Norwood. The event created the usual media frenzy as with any Royal visit, and was reported in press and television around the world. Wellington made its mark!\n\nFollowing the Royal opening, the people of the Wellington were invited to look over their proud new Ambulance station, a particularly special occasion for those who had bought a brick towards the building. Wellingtonians once again proved themselves as a generous bunch who want to support their free ambulance service.\n\nReference: A.W. Beasley, Borne Free, 1995\n\nBy 4.30pm, four Wellington Free Ambulance paramedics had arrived at Hagley Park and began attending to the sick and injured.\n\nHernan Holliday, an intensive care flight paramedic, was one of the staff who volunteered to help begin the relief effort.\n\n“I got a text from the roster administrator to say there was a major earthquake in Christchurch, and to call back if I was available to attend.\"\n\n“It was such a hard decision, leaving my wife and young kids, but I knew other people needed me. Within an hour, I had packed my bags and left.”\n\nBy 3.30pm, Hernan was in a helicopter along with three other Wellington Free paramedics travelling to Christchurch.\n\nMark Osborne, a rescue squad paramedic, was also part of this crew.\n\n“We were getting updates while we were on the way. We knew that it was big, there were injuries and fatalities, and buildings were on fire.”\n\nOn arrival in Christchurch, the team didn’t see much of the damage. Hernan said it was the next day that he saw the destruction.\n\n“It was devastating. When I looked around and thought about all those people who lost everything, especially loved ones – it was just hard to believe.”\n\n“For those first two days we worked pretty much 24/7. When we slept, it was on the floor – everyone was in the same boat.”\n\nHernan was a clinical leader of the makeshift welfare centre he helped set up at a school.\n\nThey treated the sick and injured, and made sure there was enough water and medical supplies to cater for the 800 people they looked after.\n\nMark was assigned a job relieving local front line ambulance staff, so they could go home to their families. He rotated around different areas, and spent some time at the CTV building.\n\nFreeing the last survivor from that building is a lasting memory for Mark.\n\n“I’ve been a hardened paramedic for a while, and a firefighter before that, so I’ve been involved in lots of emergencies – but this was just incredible.\"\n\n“There was very little infrastructure, water or power – but we’re trained to work in high pressure situations, so we just had to get stuck in and get the job done.”\n\nThe initial crew returned to Wellington after five days, when another group were sent down to take over.\n\nHernan said Wellington Free Ambulance were outstanding, responding to the disaster almost instantly.\n\n\"We’re a small service, and a charity, so it’s amazing that the effort was put in to help out as much as we could down there.\"\n\n“It was so hard, but such an amazing experience. It’s something I will never, ever forget.”\n\nMark agreed, he was privileged to be a part of the volunteer effort.\n\n“We were the first paramedics from the North Island to reach Christchurch. We had a great working relationship with St John and other volunteers. It really showed that in a crisis, working together to combine skills and clinical experience was seamless.”"
