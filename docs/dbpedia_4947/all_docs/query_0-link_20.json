        "text": "💥 Climate Clash @ Rubio 💥 If you’re feeling discomfort in climate tech at the moment, you’re not alone. With temperatures rising, planetary boundaries exceeded, climate politics regressing, and more cautious climate tech funding there’s plenty of good reasons to feel the unease. But we say, embrace the discomfort! ❤️ That was the overarching theme of our 2024 “What the Heck, It's Climate Tech!”. Driven by curiosity and our own feelings of climate vulnerability, we tackled some of the most uncomfortable climate tech questions of 2024. Where and how should we invest our limited climate action funds 💰? When should corporations take climate responsibility? Is climate regulation our superhero 🦸 or merely a sidekick? Helmer Schukken called out that to be a VC is to be a \"paranoid opportunist\", making the case for Rubio’s True, Eager & Bright values keeping us focussed on true partnership and a Just Transition. Next Charlie Macdonald shared Rubio's take on climate tech, that embracing uncomfortable investing helps us find fundamentally transformative ideas beyond the hype. And we hosted two “Climate Clash” debates on thorny topics with the experts. In the first, Mark van Baal (Founder, Follow This | Shareholders change the world) and Ernestien Idenburg (Co-founder, The Zoönomic Institute) shared contrasting models of steering corporate decisions from the courtroom vs the boardroom. And in the second, Jakop Dalunde (MEP) and Nancy Kabalt- Groot (Chair of Sympower, Partner at Windkracht 5! 5, and Board member of Fastned, Ennatuurlijk B.V., Better Energy) tackled how regulation like the ETS and CBAM from Brussels is playing out in the world. A huge thank you to all the guests who made this event unforgettable – a great mix of Amsterdam's start-up ecosystem and industry professionals from the energy, agrifood, and circularity sectors. We loved connecting with all the passionate entrepreneurs, operators, and investors dedicated to Climate Tech. Here's to many more exciting events! 💪🔥 #impact #impactinvesting #people #climate #tech #event"
