So much so that if anyone wants to compete with them, they need to forget about the local lads and just ring in the 'best' players possible.\n\nBut yeah, another discussion for another thread ...\n\nFair question. And I don't know. But you would think (just on the law of averages) that there would be players in the Central League capable of playing ASB Premiership, but very few of them are. And a fair number of the ones that are play for Hawke's Bay. This is weird and (in my view) indicative of a problem.\n\nBut I don't know what the problem is exactly.\n\nNot many of the franchises have been a great representation of the regions for awhile. The fact most of them are run by a single club (rather than how it was to begin with) probably has something to do with that. So essentially some are run like clubs rather than representitive teams. But like Smithy I don't really know what the problems or solutions are. Is it broken enough to warrant big changes?\n\na couple of interesting games for the weekend i feel.\n\nmaybe some form maybe forming and maybe some form has been just the luck on the day.\n\n4th round should start to show if there is any real outstanding teams and also any real struggling teams.\n\nwests at home might give Rapa a shock but i hope not.\n\nand tawa might have a new game plan and get points on the board because NCR see no threat and miss the boat but again i hope not.\n\nas for the other games i think it is sorting time for some consistent results to be top half and clear of tawa and miramar.\n\nshame i cannot make 230 at endeavour to see the ole experiment up against the Ifill experiment.\n\nCracking game at Endevour Park.\n\nWests 3-0 up after 30 minutes. Then 3-1 only for Rapa to concede an own goal for 4-1 within two minutes. Then Paul I gets one just before half time for 4-2.\n\nWests up 5-2 early in the 2nd half before Rapa got another back with about 15 to go.\n\nFinal score 5-3. Could though have been 7-6 either way. Both sides guilty of missing gilt edged chances. Wests good for their win but Rapa deserved at least a point in my neutral opinion.\n\nO and I thought Peter Linney contributed to it being a good spectacle for the neutral fans with his refereeing performance.\n\nleithal wrote:\n\nBig win for Stop Out I see on the Capital football results page. Great result. Anyone at the game who can give us a bit of a report? Dairyflat?\n\nI'm on the spot now. Your lightweight match reviewer here...\n\nGood match I thought. First twenty was very even and cagey. With lots of possession football from both sides. Once Stop Out scored the first one (about 30' in) they stepped up the intensity and took control. Martin Packer had a great game scoring two and generally being every where. His second goal was very good.\n\nJames McPeake made one VERY good save in the first half.\n\nI felt, that there was some tension between a few of the Olympic players. More so after the second went in.\n\nStop Out well worth the win.\n\nBig win for Napier today over Tawa 7 - 1. Score tied at 1 - 1 at half time.\n\nGoals to Karl Romijn (Tawa) after 14 minutes, then Angus Kilkolly at 35 mins. - - that was the first half action.\n\nChris Greatholder, the stand-in coach while Bill Robertson is away, must have had a few things to say at half-time.\n\nSecond half Napier goals to Ryan Tinsley (47, 70, 88), Angus Kilkolly (46, 64) and Tom Biss (60).\n\nMike Ramaekers saw red after a stupid challenge in the back of Greatholder with about 10 mins to go.\n\nThe beer tasted great in the Clubrooms after that result. Will be a long trip home for the Tawa boys.\n\nso NCR has the shield…\n\ni was wondering where it was these days.\n\nmight be there a long time by the looks of that performance in the second half.\n\ni think tawa might of lost the plot a bit after scoring and celebrating like they did.\n\nand forgot there keeper not Mr Moss\n\nSauce yellow fever Kiwis in UK\n\nGowan Stares grew up in England but didn't play football.\n\nNow the 15-year-old Tawa College pupil is preparing to return to the mother country for a crack at the big time, having earned a trial at English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion.\n\nStares, a central midfielder for Western Suburbs' reserve team, was one of three young Kiwis to impress West Brom's academy head coach Ryan Maye during a camp in Auckland this week.\n\nMaye saw potential for the 1.83m Stares to be converted into a modern-style centre back who is comfortable with the ball at his feet.\n\nStares, who speaks with a maturity beyond his tender years, will fly to England in the Easter holidays with a view to breaking into the club's academy on a fulltime basis.\n\n\"Even though I was born in England, I never actually played football over there,\" Stares said.\n\n\"So it'll be good to go over there and test myself against the other kids and see where it takes me. I grew up in Brighton, then moved to Australia in 1999 and Wellington in 2005.\n\n\"They said they don't have any defenders at West Brom that can take the ball out of defence and are good on the ball. So they want me to play there because with my midfield background I'm a more attacking option. I work quite hard and if you work hard enough, good opportunities happen. I see it as a good experience, training with a Premier League team.\"\n\nWest Brom, who are 16th in the Premier League, already have a Kiwi presence in the form of 19-year-old All Whites striker Chris Wood, who is on loan at League One club Brighton and Hove Albion."
