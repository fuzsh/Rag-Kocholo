        "text": "Yesterday was a reminder of the profound impact of sharing knowledge with others. Thank you, Se√°n Pattwell, for your kind words and for reigniting our connection after all these years. As a consultant and advocate of SME's, I always find such fulfillment in offering advisory services to fellow business owners. My insights are not just theories; they come from firsthand experience in building and scaling an organisation. I understand the challenges and triumphs that accompany the entrepreneurial journey. Entrepreneurship is more than a career path; it's a mindset‚Äîa commitment to innovation, resilience, and continuous learning. By sharing our knowledge and experiences, we empower others to navigate their own paths to success. It's a ripple effect, where each act of guidance and mentorship fosters growth and prosperity within our communities. Hug congratulations on the remarkable success of CW8 Communications over the past five years. Your achievements embody the spirit of entrepreneurialism and I feel certain you will continue to succeed. I'm glad to be of help to you and other entrepreneurs.

They discuss the challenges Kayvon faced and his strategies for scaling a business and enhancing sales effectiveness. The conversation covers common pitfalls in business ownership and key aspects of onboarding and training within franchise systems. Kayvon offers insights on tailoring sales roles, improving processes, and evaluating client businesses for sales optimization. They also explore recruiting and managing sales teams in a franchise. The episode concludes with information on how to connect with Kayvon Kay. Key Points Effective sales strategies can transform not only the sales team but also the entire business by focusing on authentic connections and energy rather than just handling objections. Many business owners fail to scale effectively because they try to do everything themselves and do not empower their sales teams with proper systems and processes. A successful sales team requires not just recruiting the right people but also having the right onboarding, training, and lead generation systems in place to ensure their success.

I‚Äôll be staying on as a Strategic Advisor for a couple of months, and as a cheerleader, mentor, and friend to the company for the rest of my life. While I can‚Äôt possibly express all of my emotions, I‚Äôll take on Bren√© Brown‚Äôs challenge of ~brave vulnerability~ and share a few: üòû ü•π I feel sad. I have been mourning a bit as I wake up and don‚Äôt spend every day with an amazing team of humans, solving complex problems that ignite me, for a customer base I grew to love more than they all could ever know. ü•≤ ü§ë I feel proud. Looking back makes the enormous growth suddenly so clear: From crafting buyer personas and hosting early brand workshops solo ‚Üí Finalizing a brand guide & launching a sophisticated new look with a talented marketing team. From personally closing the first 100+ customers (first few while we were still building the product!) ‚Üí Cementing playbooks and revenue operations with a fierce sales team. From hiring the first person across my three teams (Colin Connor- Customer Success, Mallory Mullen- Sales, Carmen Bodziak- Marketing; ALL of whom are still there, multiple times promoted, and THRIVING!) and crafting company values from scratch ‚Üí Winning multiple ‚ÄúBest Tech Startup‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Places to Work‚Äù awards and retaining unbeatable talent. From hitting our first $1mm (and many more following) on a shoestring budget ‚Üí Raising a Series A to fuel continued success. üòé üí™ With that, I feel confident in this team. What I feel most proud of is leaving behind a team and infrastructure that I know are poised for undoubtable continued success. We built with scale in mind from Day One. I told my team on my final day ‚ÄúI know you can do this next chapter without me‚Äù and I deeply meant it. ü§© üëÄ I feel excited. When I look back on Fall 2016 meeting Erik Dreyer and Andrew Garcia, I couldn‚Äôt have immediately imagined how I‚Äôd spend nearly 8 years building a multi-million dollar business that changed an industry with two people I‚Äôd grow to view almost like family. It has me wondering: What‚Äôs around the next corner? So, after spending the better part of a decade deeply invested in this industry, my current goal is to open as many doors as possible to find my next opportunity for innovation, impact, and growth. I‚Äôm also excited to take on a few consulting gigs and have the space to pursue a couple personal passion projects, as well. Most importantly, I‚Äôm dubbing this the ‚Äúsummer of connection‚Äù. Let‚Äôs grab a virtual coffee and catch up! üåû ‚òï\n\nüåü Saturday Spotlight üåü With over 28 years at the helm of @RecMediaInc., Troy Sedgwick has led the company from its inception in 1995 to its current status as a leading provider of indoor out-of-home media and sponsorship campaigns in recreational facilities across North America.

Beyond work, Troy enjoys staying active through triathlons and says, \"I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a 'triathlete'‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm more a weekend warrior.\" He also loves wine, cars & driving autocross, and travel with his family. \"We love travel - my wife and I thrive on going new places and taking the kids to see new cultures.
