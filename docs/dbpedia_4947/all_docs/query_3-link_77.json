        "text": "The Buffalo Bills are AFC East champs for the fourth year in a row, after their 21-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe win is an incredible feat for the Bills, who were 6-6 the Sunday after Thanksgiving, with low odds to make the playoffs, let alone the AFC East. They're the first team in NFL history to be .500 or lower with five or fewer games left, and be the No. 2 seed or higher.\n\nThe game last night saw the Bills average 8 yards per play. Their defense had troubles stopping the run in the first half but played amazing in the second half, despite injuries during the game to Rasul Douglas and Tyrel Dodson.\n\nJosh Allen had three turnovers but he also contributed well over 400 yards of offense. He was great towards the end of the game, including a miraculous 3rd and 13 first down run on the Bolls final offensive drive.\n\nAfter the win, the Bills celebrated the division win. We saw head coach Sean McDermott actually dance and smile, which I don't think we have ever seen him do before as head coach.\n\nThe Bills now prepare for the 7th seed Pittsburgh Steelers. They got into the playoffs because of the Tennessee Titans upsetting the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, which allowed the Houston Texans to win the AFC South and be the 4 seed.\n\nThe Steelers won't have star edge rusher T.J. Watt, who sprained his MCL in week 18 vs. the Ravens.\n\nPittsburgh will start Mason Rudolph or Kenny Pickett at quarterback and it's a game the Bills should win. They cannot play off, however, since the playoffs are one and done."
