        "text": "Not only is June an exciting month due to school coming to an end and the smell of beach days and late-night ice cream runs creeping around the corner, but it is also Pride Month! After learning from friends who celebrate it, I have realized how meaningful it is for the LGBTQ+ community. And it relates to baseball because MLB has put a spin on how they show their allyship and support through their annual Pride Nights. Of course, these don’t all happen in June; some are celebrated throughout the year, as they should be. So now, without further ado, let’s get into what exactly these nights consist of and why I believe they’re so important.\n\nWhat Are MLB Pride Nights?\n\nMLB Pride Nights are fun and colorful events that each MLB team hosts once a year to show support, awareness and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community. These nights first started in 2001 when the Chicago Cubs debuted their solidarity with “Gay Days,” now called “Out at Wrigley.” And let me tell you, MLB doesn’t hold back when it comes to this event. It is extremely over the top, but that’s the best part. Rainbows paint the stadium, from the logo behind home plate to a rainbow stripe running along the bases to the T-shirts sold in the team shop. Naturally, though, these Pride Nights are a lot deeper than just that.\n\nIn 2019, an MLB Pride Night led to a proposal. According to The Washington Post, a man attended a Washington Nationals game on Pride Night with his boyfriend. Between the sixth and seventh inning, he was chosen to play a trivia game on the main scoreboard. Cut to the question, and his boyfriend is on a knee, asking for his hand in marriage. And who said baseball wasn’t romantic? Now don’t get me wrong, I know that proposals happen during ball games all the time, but for MLB to provide a safe space for two men to show their affection without enduring ridicule is major — literally.\n\nMore recently, the San Francisco Giants took their show of support a step further by wearing a rainbow logo on their sleeves and hats, not just during Pride Night but from the start of June. Only a few players have worn colors to show their support for the LGBTQ+ community, like LHP Sean Doolittle with his Pride cleats during Players Weekend, just to name one. Not only are these players and teams showing impactful support for this community, but they also help to spread a lot of positive awareness.\n\nWhy Are Pride Nights Important?\n\nMLB Pride Nights are great, as they provide a safe, inclusive space for everyone. Whether you are a part of the LGBTQ+ community or not, the atmosphere from these events is highly accepting and positive. These nights allow people to attend a game and be themselves without feeling judged or scorned. I love that, but I think every game should be like that. Unfortunately, the sad reality is that that isn’t the case. I have seen dozens of videos of people, and even players, being called disgusting, homophobic slurs at games, and it is genuinely heartbreaking. At Pride Night, you don’t see any of that. The stadium is filled with love and acceptance, and there isn’t any room for slurs or judgment.\n\nSecondly, these nights bring awareness. If you see your favorite celebrity — and in this case, famous athletes — spreading awareness about a particular topic, most of the time you’ll show interest as well. I have fallen victim to becoming a consumer of way too many products that my favorite celebrities have promoted in ads, but that’s my point! We want MLB to be the role model for inclusivity. So these Pride Nights aren’t just fun nights featuring charming colors. They are valuable to the LGBTQ+ community and those who lack awareness.\n\nI have to say that the next MLB game I attend will be a Pride Night game. Not only do they look enjoyable, but there is also nothing that I love more than being surrounded by positive people with zero judgment.\n\nHappy Pride Month everyone!"
