        "text": "In the days since leaving Austin, I’ve thought about our shared experience at SpiceWorld many many times… mostly paired with the phrase “I don’t think I’ll ever not be tired again…” My thinking is also paired with a tremendous feeling of optimism about the path we at Spiceworks are on for this business and this brand. As we closed the event on Thursday, a thought that had been rattling around crystallized for me: I can firmly represent how important transparency is to all of us, both our staff members and our community stakeholders, as we embark on a growth strategy for our business and brand. Thank you all for your help ensuring that message sticks!\n\nThe team here asked me to post a bit of a recap of the event from my POV. Since I could not narrow it down, I’ve decided to borrow a format from David Letterman to share my thoughts. Without further ado….\n\nTop 10 SpiceWorld 2023 Highlights (because it was too hard to choose less):\n\nDr. James Stanger educating us on Cowboy IT (and western films)! Thank you CompTIA for connecting him with us!\n\nThe Community Pre-Release Playground is live and we want your feedback!\n\nI met SpiceRex up close at the NinjaOne Dino Disco (and I was scared)!\n\nOur team had to break up a non-sanctioned dodgeball game at the ACC! A first for even our event pros supporting SpiceWorld – Well done, SpiceFam & Eaton Brand Reps!\n\nAll of the feels shared by Chris Hill earlier this week (is this cheating?!). So many new friends made and a fantastic time connecting with my day-to-day colleagues.\n\nLearning all the things – State of IT with Peter Tsai, Anarchy Over Agility with Mark Cruth, and the Women in IT roundtable gave me a ton to think about and bring back to our Spiceworks team!\n\nThe welcome video. I don’t even have words to express the joy it brings. The outfits, the dance moves, the Slava cameo!\n\nThe Future of IT Hardware and Software Panel with Jim Rapoza, Justin Ong, Glenn Pitchford, and Neil McAlister was so engaging and full of insight!\n\nA sea of attendees singing Happy Birthday to the one and only Sean Dahlberg!\n\nGetting over my stage fright (with the help of so very many Spiceworks colleagues) to be able to welcome y’all to the event and share a bit more about what we’ve been up to!\n\nAs I said in the welcome keynote, I challenge each one of you to invite a new community member! Growing our community means more questions, more answers, more spice, and more opportunities for connection. I look forward to all of the work in progress and wonderful things to come from this dedicated Spiceworks team!\n\nSo a massive thanks to each and everyone of you, new and veteran attendees alike! I’ve learned so much and I can’t wait to hear what you took away from this year’s event. Speaking of which, let us know:\n\nWhat was your favorite part?\n\nWhat was your favorite session?\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nAnd, of course, I do have to plug the overall event survey ; this info and your comments and feedback help us do this better and better each time.\n\nPS this note is getting long so I do not want to lengthen it, but in the spirit of transparency: we are reimagining our IRL experience and we’re not yet sure what form next year’s event will take, but all of your comments and survey feedback is helping to shape it. As we know more, we’ll share more, but for now, let the feedback roll in!\n\n@Eaton @CompTIA @NinjaOne\n\n@glenn-p @slava @spicerex @cynlis @technical-angel @sean-spiceworks @peter-spiceworks @geekylibrarian @chris-spiceworks\n\nWhat was your favorite part?\n\nGetting to talk to virtual friends/coworkers in person was the best. … The breakfast on the last day with piles of bacon was pretty good too though.\n\nWhat was your favorite session?\n\nI didn’t get to go to a lot of sessions because I was working the registration desk, but of the ones that I attended, I liked the Women in IT one the best.\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nI think that having a virtual get-together for all the community members that couldn’t be there would give more people the opportunity to touch base with each other.\n\nAlso, a swag store so that people who couldn’t be there can still get their hands on a SpiceRex plushie or a T-shirt would be good.\n\nWhat was your favorite part?\n\nI loved putting faces with avatars and names, and talking to people that do what I do in the trenches each and every day. As a one-person show, it’s tremendously valuable to spend time with “my people” and exchange ideas/struggles/solutions.\n\nWhat was your favorite session?\n\nI truly enjoyed the Future of IT Hardware and Software Panel. I know it was only an hour and there was a lot to discuss, but I remember keynotes from prior years always had a Q&A session at the end, and my only disappointment in this session was not having one at the end.\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nBring back Q&A’s at the end of the general sessions.\n\nThere were a few different time slots that had multiple breakouts that interested me, and I had to choose one over the others. It would be nice if the ones we missed could be watched on demand at a later date.\n\nImprove the app so we can actually interact with attendees through it. I could find fellow attendees if they made themselves visible, but there was no way to just follow them right from there or even chat with them or exchange contact info. I had to go “old school” and exchange paper business cards with a few or just hit the SW website and find/follow them that way.\n\nI think it would be fantastic if the avatars could be printed on the badges. Many times I recognize these even more than I do the handles/screennames, so the visual would be incredibly helpful for people like me.\n\n@geekylibrarian ​ was taking Hub orders from Discord!\n\nI’m so happy to hear both of you mention the Women in IT panel! Ever since I quazi-crashed the panel in 2016 (Thank you, @katiemattison ​!!), I’ve always made sure that it was submitted, and I’m thankful that we’ve always been selected! No matter the form future SpiceWorlds may take, I will keep submitting it! (Though, if we have another year like '22, where in-person and virtual are separate sessions, I will NOT try to submit any other sessions, because, gah, that was a lot of work!)\n\n@megan-ju-spiceworks ​ and everyone else that was involved, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for my double SpiceWorld cereral miracle! And, also, I’ve heard a lot of people happy about the cereal out on the snack tables Wednesday morning!\n\nAlso, another huge THANK YOU on behalf of the SpiceBuddies! Having an actual booth in a great location meant a lot to us, and we were able to help a lot more people!\n\nAnd, again on the subject of future SpiceWorld formats, like @suzanne-spiceworks ​ said, I was only able to make it to two sessions that I was not presenting, even though there were quite a few I wanted to hear! When we were virtual, or even pre-COVID when certain sessions were recorded and posted online later, we could go back and watch the sessions we missed. That’s something I really miss.\n\nWhat was your favorite part?\n\nOh wow, I have to pick a favorite?! Hmmm I mentioned this before, but the impromptu “silent” dodgeball tournament was hilarious to witness. I love how vendors and Spiceworks users can come together at an event like this in fun ways. Of course, the technical aspects of the conference are fantastic! However, it’s the people who participate in this event (Vendor, Tech Pro, and Spiceworks Employee) that make this conference so unique.\n\nWhat was your favorite session?\n\nI’m completely biased, but “Pure Capsaicin: The Future of Community” with @georgie-spiceworks ​, @lisa-marie-spiceworks ​, @benb and the team was so exciting! My team and I live and breathe in this Community, and I’m so excited to see this new era take flight.\n\nWhat could we do better?\n\nI’d love more of a connection with the Spiceworks Community & SpiceWorld with attendees and Vendors. It was surprising that some of the newbie SpiceWorld attendees I met had very little knowledge about the Spiceworks Community and what it offers! SpiceWorld (although an incredible event) is only 3 days. However, this Community is all the time Kudos to the Spicebuddies for helping support the newbies at their booth! I loved hearing about all the connections you all made.\n\nSpiceworld #8 for me.\n\nFavorite part\n\nBeing with my IT family. They have done so much for me this past year, and I hope they realize it.\n\nGrandpa @sean-spiceworks ​ birthday and celebrating more than once.\n\nMeeting @chris-spiceworks . Thank you for the above reference.\n\nDodgeball against Eaton\n\nFavorite Session\n\nOpening keynote and the Women in IT Fireside Chat\n\nWhat could we do better\n\nBring back Q&A\n\nApp needs improvement\n\nSessions on demand for those that had conflicting timeslots\n\nBetter music at the ACL party. This year did not match the theme at all.\n\nAvatars on badges"
