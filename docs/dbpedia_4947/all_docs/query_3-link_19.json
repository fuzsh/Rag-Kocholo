        "text": "Much like a man over 40 who’s suffering from low testosterone, Orlando City is looking a little thin up top. The Lions’ current list of strikers who have proven themselves capable of playing at the Major League Soccer level is comprised of Duncan McGuire, Ramiro Enrique…and that’s it. Orlando does have 24-year-old Jack Lynn, who absolutely torched MLS NEXT Pro by scoring 19 goals in 26 games on his way to securing a share of the golden boot. But as Sean Rollins pointed out earlier this week, he’s only made six appearances in two years for the first team, and 2024 is very much a prove-it year for him.\n\nWith that in mind, the Lions could potentially look at securing the services of a free agent to help with striker depth. Duncan McGuire is likely to maintain the starting job with Ramiro Enrique as the backup, but OCSC could benefit from a savvy vet who both knows the league, and where the goal is. Here are three players who I think could fill precisely that role for Orlando this year, ranked in order of who I’d most like to see the team sign.\n\nJosef Martinez\n\nNo need to stand on ceremony here, Josef Martinez would instantly add firepower to the Lions’ roster. With seven goals and an assist in 27 games last year, his production fell off a little from where it’s been in years past, but the sheer number of attack-minded cooks in Inter Miami’s kitchen didn’t do him any favors either. There’s zero doubt that he’s well aware of where the goal is, and at 30 years of age he should still have a good amount of tread left on his tires. There might be some questions about whether he’d want to play second fiddle to McGuire, but frankly if he hypothetically beat Duncan out for the starting job, I wouldn’t have any problem with the youngster learning behind him for a little bit. Plus between Concacaf Champions Cup, Leagues Cup, the regular season, and potentially the U.S. Open Cup, there should be plenty of games to go around. The downside is that very likely wouldn’t come cheap, but players of his caliber require you to break open the checkbook a little bit. He’s been one of Orlando’s most hated heels for years, but the only thing people love more than a good heel, is a well-earned face turn. Get him in purple.\n\nDiego Rubio\n\nA favorite son of the Colorado Rapids, Rubio had three goals and four assists in 16 games last year for the Western Conference team. Like Martinez, his production has fallen off from where it was when he scored 16 goals and provided 17 assists in 30 games back in 2022. Still, like Martinez he’s only 30 years old and should have some juice left. It’s also hard to hold his 2023 numbers against him too much when he played on a Rapids team that finished last in the West with 27 points and only scored 26 goals all year. One way of looking at things is that he was directly responsible for just over 25% of all the goals the Rapids scored last year, and the man only played in 16 games. In theory, he could function similarly to Martinez in that he could compete for the starting job, and even if he didn’t win it, there would still be a good chunk of playing time up for grabs. Rubio made $600,000 in base compensation last year, so while he’d be cheaper than Martinez, he’d still cost the team a fair bit of money. I’m not quite as high on him as I am Josef, but he would still provide a veteran presence and extra scoring punch that would really upgrade Orlando’s depth up top.\n\nKei Kamara\n\nI know, I know, Kamara is ancient. He’ll turn 40 this September and buying players who are that old typically isn’t good business. But Kamara just scores, man. Everywhere he’s been he’s gotten goals, even as he’s gotten well into his thirties. He had five goals and two assists in 27 games last year for a Chicago Fire team that finished 13th in the East. In this scenario Duncan would be the starter and Kamara and Enrique would be battling it out to be the first man off the bench. At 6-foot-3, he’d also give the Lions some much needed height and would provide a completely different look in games that Orlando was either chasing, or times where the team wants to bunker deep and play the ball up to a big target man. He almost certainly isn’t a guy who you sign to a multi-year deal like Martinez or Rubio, but he could be the final piece for a team looking to make the most of what could be a closing championship window. He’d also almost certainly be the most cost effective of the three options, as his base compensation was $200,000 last year.\n\nThose are my top three choices for MLS free agent strikers who I believe could help Orlando City this season. They all have their pros and cons, but at the end of the day each one would make the team better and help OCSC chase an MLS Cup. Are there any free agents who you’d like to see suit up in purple this season? If so, be sure to sound off down in the comments. Vamos Orlando!\n\nOrlando City finished its run in the 2024 Leagues Cup Friday night after a 0-0 draw, exiting at the hands of Liga MX side Cruz Azul in the team’s first ever penalty kick shootout loss. With the sun now set for the Lions on this year’s version of the clash between clubs from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, what positives can be taken from the competition?\n\nWhat follows are some of my reactions to the squad’s performance over the three matches in Leagues Cup play.\n\nHot Start\n\nOrlando City started Leagues Cup with an emphatic 4-1 victory over CF Montreal. For a team that was enjoying a scoring resurgence prior to the start of the midseason competition, it was reasuring to see the offensive success continue. Forward Ramiro Enrique led the Lions with two goals over three matches and also added an assist. Designated Player Facundo Torres also had three goal-scoring contributions in the competition with one goal and two assists. Martin Ojeda and Dagur Dan Thorhallsson joined the stat sheet with goals as well. While the goals dried up as the Lions advanced into the knockout round, the team was still creating good chances, and if that can continue down the stretch of the regular season, the Lions should be able to solidify a playoff spot.\n\nEl Pulpo Continues Strong Play\n\nBelieve it or not, earlier in the season some fans were calling for Peruvian No. 1 Pedro Gallese to be benched in favor of backup goalkeeper Mason Stajduhar. Gallese’s performance in Leagues Cup and over the last several weeks of the regular season prior to the competition should have all but have eliminated that notion. My favorite moment of the entirity of the 2024 competition came thanks to El Pulpo in the first match of group play when Gallese faced familiar Orlando City foe Josef Martinez from the penalty spot. Gallese stood tall and stonewalled Martinez, denying the persisent thorn in Orlando’s side a second goal on the evening. The most meaningful performance by El Pulpo came in the knockout round, when he kept a clean sheet after saving six shots through 90 minutes, helping to get Orlando City into a position where it could advance to the next round. Had his teammates been a bit more clinical, the game against Cruz Azul might not even have been close.\n\nStreaks Come and Go\n\nThe second match of Orlando City’s foray into the 2024 Leagues Cup continued multiple impressive streaks. One was Enrique’s scoring streak and the second was Orlando City’s spotless record in penalty shootouts. Enrique’s scoring streak started in the July 6 beatdown of D.C. United, and he managed to score in six consecutive matches to break Daryl Dike’s club record of five. His streak finally came to an end against Cruz Azul, as he failed to score for the first time in over a month despite having multiple good chances. Enrique may not be the most physically imposing player on the field, but he is easily enjoying the best stretch of his young Orlando City career, as he was able to score in both of the group stage matches and converted his penalty kick attept against Atletico San Luis.\n\nSpeaking of penalty kicks, Orlando had already locked up the group stage by drawing the match against Atletico San Luis, and I had never been a part of a shootout which carried no weight whatsoever. It was kind of neat! Orlando made it nine unbeaten shootout victories by beating San Luis from the spot. Just like Enrique’s goal-scoring streak, Orlando’s perfect record in shootouts also fell against Cruz Azul, which was a painful reminder that all good things eventually come to an end. Both captain Robin Jansson and Thorhallsson had their attempts saved.\n\nUltimately, the Lions will not lift the Leagues Cup trophy this year and will have a more difficult road to qualify for the Concacaf Champions Cup for a third year in a row. However, the team played some quality minutes during the Olympic break, and in watching the Lions, I think that there is some strong chemistry to ride down the stretch of the regular season.\n\nI love dunking. Oreos, Dunkaroos, my son in the pool, basketballs on a lowered rim — I love all types of dunking. You do too, I know you do. In fact, I think dunking is universally loved by everyone, except the NCAA during the 1960s, when they outlawed dunking in basketball because Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) was unstoppable and they were trying to find a way to make college basketball games more interesting.\n\nFrédéric Weis probably also does not love dunking (France, Olympics, basketball, this is the time of all times to reference that dunk), but that may be it for those who were or are anti-dunk. I also love Dunkin’, and their slogan, “America runs on Dunkin’,” which Orlando City fans co-opted to Orlando runs on Duncan (McGuire), who is the subject of my focus this week. Duncan has returned from the Olympics but the question on all of our minds now is: for how long?\n\nThat we are even asking that question two years into McGuire’s professional career is a testament to his skill and will, because he is one of only four players from the entire 2023 MLS SuperDraft (88 selections) to have played more than 2,500 MLS minutes, and as the sixth overall pick, he was drafted four spots behind teammate Shak Mohammed, who has played only five MLS minutes in his career thus far. MLS draftees generally do not blossom so quickly that they are European targets after their first season, though Orlando City has had more success than most in the SuperDraft, as they drafted Cyle Larin, Chris Mueller and Daryl Dike, all of whom play(ed) in Europe after starting their careers in Orlando.\n\nWhile Duncan was not Orlando City’s top pick in 2023 he was still a top six overall pick, so he did come in with some pedigree, but he was not a player who came up playing on youth national teams and with the expectation that he would walk right into minutes as a professional player. He did not play in either of his first two professional matches, and for the opening half of the 2023 season he generally sat behind Ercan Kara and then came in as a sub at some point in the final third of the game. But in those limited minutes he showed that his style of play was better suited to partnering with the rest of the Orlando City attack than that of Kara, leading to Kara’s return to Europe and McGuire taking over as the team’s primary striker.\n\nLooking at his stats in 2023, it is easy to see why he took over that starting role, as using stats found on fbref.com, McGuire finished tied for 12th in goals (13), was third in goals per 90 minutes (0.84), and led MLS in shots-on-target percentage (72.7%), percentage of shots that became goals (39%), and goals – expected goals (+7.7). In general, I do not love bringing in expected goals as a stat, but in some cases it can be instructive, and in this case I think it is, because expected goals measure the average likelihood of a player scoring a goal from a specific location. That means McGuire scored 7.7 more goals than the average player would have been expected to score from where he took his shots in 2023.\n\nHere are his 2023 MLS shots, courtesy of fotmob.com’s shot chart (the red circle is his final goal of 2023, because the site does not have a view without at least one shot highlighted):\n\nInterestingly, that shot from near the midfield line has an expected goal value of 0.03, meaning the coders who set the values expect a goal about once in every 33 shots from there. I disagree. Vehemently.\n\nComing back to Duncan, let’s look at how he has been doing in 2024 as compared to 2023 in those same categories where he did so well, with one additional stat added in for comparison purposes (MLS rank among qualified players is shown in parentheses for the metrics; t means tied for):\n\nYes, the numbers on the right do not look quite as impressive as those on the left, as there are no top 10 rankings in any of these metrics so far this year. However, McGuire’s 2024 numbers are not bad, they are just not quite as good as 2023, except for the fact that when he shoots it on target he scores at exactly the same clip as he did in 2023, which is likely not coincidental and is a product of his shooting proficiency.\n\nWith about one quarter of the season left to play, he will have plenty of chances to increase his goal tally (unless he’s transferred out), and he also can make some improvements on the other percentage-based metrics as well. I do not think he will get to 13 goals again, but he has a shot to get to 10, which could make him the third or fourth (depending on if Facundo Torres also scores 10 goals) Orlando City player ever to have multiple 10+ goals in an MLS season. McGuire also now has 20 MLS goals in his first two seasons, and I expect he will get a few more before the end of the 2024 campaign, which I will come back to after a quick detour to look at those 20 total goals.\n\nThat 20 goals made for a nice round number, so I took a look at this decade (the 2020s) to see how many players in their age 23 or younger season had scored at least 20 MLS goals. The answer: 17. My dad, the world’s foremost pointer outer (go with it) of the prevalence of how often 17 shows up in the world is nodding his head and saying he knew it would be 17.\n\nFor those wondering, the leader this decade in goals scored by young players is FC Dallas forward Jesús Ferreira, who has scored 43 goals and will not turn 24 until this December. Ferreira has scored those 43 goals in 8,950 MLS minutes, McGuire’s 20 goals were scored in only 2,730 MLS minutes, the fewest of any of those 17 players. Duncan’s career MLS goals per 90 minutes is 0.66, which ranks him first among those 17 young players and also fourth in all of MLS (among players of any age) in this decade. The other three in the top four (Giorgos Giakoumakis, Chicho Arango, and Cucho Hernandez — presented in order of rank) were/are all Designated Players and all had/have salaries at least 20 times higher than McGuire’s, according to the MLS Salary Guide.\n\nI mentioned that I would come back to the fact that I expect Duncan to score a few more goals this season, and that is because I think that he will finish this season with Orlando City. I have no inside information. I just think it makes more sense for him to finish this MLS season strongly and then depart in the MLS off-season, which is right smack in the middle of European seasons, when there will be teams who really need a striker due to injury or a relegation battle or because they are chasing promotion — like Barnsley was several years ago when the club made a loan deal for Daryl Dike to try to win promotion to the Premier League. It is no secret that McGuire wants to play in Europe, and he clearly has the ability to do so based on his stats and the eye test, but as it usually comes down to, it will be about timing and the purchase price.\n\nTransfermarkt values Duncan at €5 million (approximately $5.46 million), third highest on Orlando City behind Facundo Torres (€14 million, $15.26 million) and Martín Ojeda (€6 million, $6.54 million), tied for 33rd overall among all MLS players, and tied for 12th among players 23 or younger. For a player who cost Orlando City nothing to acquire, any compensation would be nearly pure profit, so the team has an incentive to sell him as opposed to letting him play out his contract and leave for free.\n\nMcGuire had an opportunity to break out at the Olympics and drive up immediate interest, but the U.S. Olympic Team was not really set up in a way to maximize, or really even utilize at all, his talents, and he did not contribute any goals or assists. I do not think this Olympic performance will affect how talent evaluators and other teams view him, but had he scored some goals or contributed more than just his trademark max effort at all times, that could have been a catalyst for a move before the end of the MLS transfer window on Aug. 14.\n\nAlas for Duncan, it did not go the way he had hoped, but as he always does, he left it all out on the field…and then left France the following day (Saturday), returning to Orlando in time to sub in during the Leagues Cup match on Sunday night. That’s impressive dedication, and it indicated to me that he is locked in on getting on the field and showing what he can do again.\n\nHe did return to a different Orlando City team though, one with a scorching-hot Ramiro Enrique playing in what was McGuire’s striker role and on a five, which became six, game scoring run. We may see the return of supersub Duncan for a while, reminiscent of his first few months in 2023, but I think that by the end of the season we will see McGuire back as the starting striker. If so, it will mean he is in good form, because Enrique is only going to be beaten out by a deserving player.\n\nI think this is a best-case scenario for Orlando City — a highly motivated McGuire who wants his spot back and who wants to show European evaluators that they should bring him across the Atlantic, and a highly motivated Enrique, who wants to keep his starting spot and who will want to be the clear choice to be the starter when Duncan eventually does leave.\n\nOrlando City fans are in for 90 minutes of strong striker play in every match now that McGuire is back and Enrique has come on like the proverbial freight train, and I think we have a good chance to see another end-of-season run coming for the Lions down the stretch.\n\nAs the Pride’s Kerry Abello always says, vamos!\n\nSince dropping a 4-2 contest to NYCFC on June 28, Orlando City has gone unbeaten in six games across all competitions, winning five games and drawing once. A big part of the headlines has understandably been the offensive explosion that we’ve seen from the Lions. In those six games, OCSC has scored 18 goals and been held to a single goal just once.\n\nThat sort of offense always tends to draw the eye, but Orlando has quietly been just as good on the other side of the ball. Across those six games, the Lions have only conceded four goals while keeping two clean sheets in the process. Offensive prowess aside, if a team is averaging fewer than a goal conceded per game, it’s going to be a tough side to beat. That’s exactly what we’ve seen during this unbeaten run, but let’s take a deeper look at how OCSC has done it.\n\nFor starters, the back line has benefitted from the sort of stability that was merely a pipe dream during the first few months of the season. A wicked combination of injuries, call-ups and suspensions meant that the defense had to endure shifting lineups, shifting formations, and shifting tactics, with Wilder Cartagena even being deputized as a center back at one point (and doing a pretty admirable job). Stability has been the name of the game over the last six matches, with the quartet of Kyle Smith, Robin Jansson, Rodrigo Schlegel, and Dagur Dan Thorhallsson starting three games in a row from the 2-1 win against Toronto through the 3-1 victory over the New England Revolution. Rafael Santos replaced Smith for the next two games, a 3-0 win over Nashville SC and a 1-1 draw with NYCFC, and David Brekalo and Smith stepped in for Schlegel and Santos respectively in the 4-1 win over Montreal in Leagues Cup action.\n\nThe consistency in both formation and the personnel being used in it breeds familiarity and comfort on the field, and that chemistry is especially important for a back line. If a defense isn’t holding an even line, stepping up as a unit when playing an offside trap, and covering each other when necessary, things break down quickly. We’ve still seen some goals given up through silly mistakes and mental errors, but far fewer than at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Lions have also done an excellent job at limiting shooting opportunities for the opposition. Across the last six games, Orlando City’s opponents have taken double-digit shots only once: in the victory over Toronto, when the Reds took 15. In the next game, D.C. United took five shots (a slightly skewed number, considering United played 45 minutes with 10 men), while New England, Nashville, and NYCFC each took eight, and Montreal attempted nine.\n\nWhen other teams have managed to get shots off, Orlando has mostly done well at getting blocks in to make Pedro Gallese’s life easy. In Toronto, the Lions registered six blocks, recorded one against D.C. United, two against New England, three against Nashville, two against NYCFC, and four against Montreal.\n\nOn occasions that the opposition does get a clean shooting opportunity, the Lions have largely kept them from coming in dangerous areas. I say all the time that the expected goals statistic isn’t perfect, but it does provide a reasonable idea of how good a team’s scoring opportunities are. OCSC might have surrendered 15 shots against TFC, but the Reds’ xG only amounted to 1.48, in large part due to seven of those shots coming from outside the box. Two of D.C.’s five shots came from outside the box, and United finished with 0.26 xG. Three of the Revs’ eight attempts were outside the box and they tallied 1.03 xG. Half of Nashville’s eight shots were outside the box and it recorded 0.34 xG. Three of NYCFC’s eight attempts came outside the box and the Pigeons finished with 1.3 xG, and four of Montreal’s nine shots were outside the box, although I haven’t been able to find xG data for the Leagues Cup match.\n\nThat’s a lot of stats to sort through, but essentially OCSC has done well at limiting shooting opportunities, and has been doing a good job at keeping them to less dangerous areas and blocking shots that do get taken. That tends to be a good recipe for success, and it’s one that’s been working well for the Lions.\n\nFollowing an uncharacteristically shaky start to the year, the Lions have used consistent faces and consistently strong play to turn in defensive performances that have been much more in line with what we’re used to seeing from this unit. The offensive fireworks have grabbed a lot of the attention, and rightly so, but Orlando’s improved play at the back deserves its plaudits. Long may it continue."
