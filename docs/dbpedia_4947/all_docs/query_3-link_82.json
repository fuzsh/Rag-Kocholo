        "text": "There are certain things the Internet just loves. Screaming at each other with righteous anger. Videos where a dog and a horse are best friends. Pornography. But there's nothing the Internet seems to love more than collectively dunking on former Trump press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer.\n\nAnd I get it! Like a tall, gangly white center who constantly frustrates his team's fanbase, Spicer always look like he's primed to be dunked on. So it should come as no surprise that Spicer found himself back in the paint again recently, unable to decide if he wanted to take a charge or contest the shot. And by that I mean, Spicer posted a dumb thing on Instagram and people are mocking him.\n\nNow, again, I get it. During his time in the White House, Spicer did a lot to earn the scorn that many feel for him, and on its face this is pretty dumb. But maybe, just maybe, there's a good explanation for why Spicer called FDR's copy of A Christmas Carol \"FDR's book of christmas carols.\"\n\nExplanation #1: Sean Spicer is making a funny joke.\n\nCome on, you online jerks! Of course he knows what A Christmas Carol is, he's just pretending to be dumb for comic effect. Now sure, this is a very dumb joke, but there's a certain logic to the humor. It'd be like taking a picture of a copy of Romeo and Juliet, and making the caption, \"Can't believe they wrote a non-lawn ornament version of Gnomeo and Juliet. Seems dumb.\" Now, believing this explanation means giving Spicer the benefit of the doubt, which I know no one wants to do, but it seems like a possibility.\n\nExplanation #2: Sean Spicer is actually smarter than you.\n\nMaybe Sean Spicer is secretly a literature buff! Maybe he's going from cocktail party to cocktail party talking about his theories on the classics. And if you accept this supposition, maybe he's using his Instagram to offer his interpretation of Dickens' title. After all, Dickens called his story a \"carol\" and named its parts \"staves.\" This is the language of music. Dickens did this, I assume, because he wanted his novel to take on the quality of a song. He wanted it to be told and re-told over and over again. Maybe Spicer knows this and simply was thinking of the author's wishes when he captioned that photo. \"Ol' Charlie would love hearing his work referred to as songs.\"\n\nExplanation #3: He might not be very smart.Okay, yeah, this one is highly probable. But shouldn't we save our dunks for more challenging centers? It's not that impressive if LeBron dunks on a Plumlee or a Zeller, but if he dunks on Joel Embiid or Rudy Gobert? That's the stuff of legends. Shouldn't we, like the creators of the Fyre Festival, aspire to that?\n\n[Remembers Sean Spicer lying to the press every day for months and months]\n\nYeah, you're right. Dunk on Sean."
