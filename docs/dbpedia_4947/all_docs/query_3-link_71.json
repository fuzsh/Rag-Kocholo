[2] A month later he got invited to perform the dance on The Queen Latifah Show. He got most fame of public eye by his appearance on season two of NBC's World of Dance as Sean & Kaycee in 2018, and since 2021 playing Chris de la Rosa in the drama, thriller series The Cleaning Lady, which made his break through as actor, but within the dance community Sean was already an established star, since her was 14, by holding workshops, hosting and attending conventions, showcasing dances and teaching masterclasses around the world in front of thousands of people.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] He stated at July 2018 that he doesn't have permanent long-term goals, because everything is so last-minute and he doesn't know where he will be tomorrow. He wants just go the flow and taking chances.[10] He isn't actually seeking for a career as dance teacher, but wants to support groups who having a certain amount of hunger and passion for life and dance, which he had experienced himself in LA when her was younger and wants to (re-)establish it worldwide. [11] Sean is considered as big influence-r on kid dancer talents today - as dancer, choreographer, teacher and mentor. For instance, he taught at THE LAB in West Covina and supported their dancers, who won season two of World of Dance and members became hip-hop world champions as team TLxWC in the Varsity division in 2017. [12]\n\nBeyond his strong support for the dance community, Sean is a distinguished industry dancer, choreographer, creative film and stage director, editor and producer. He worked with/for celebrities, such as, Justin Bieber, Meghan Trainor, Janet Jackson, Jackson Wang, to name a few. He performed on commercials, for instance, for Disney, Canon, Red Bull and Old Navy. He also choreographed for commercials for Samsung, Nike, Feng Chen Wang and others. Worked as model for some labels. Produced an one hour independent dance short film \"II: AN UNSPOKEN NARRATIVE\" and was creative director and choreographer for the entire Jackson Wang Choachella Show 2023, and many more (see below). He got his first professional gig as dancer when he was eight years old on the Glee show. He won on Dance-Off Juniors season one episode eight, competed on season one of NBC's World of Dance as member of ImmaBEAST and on season two with his partner Kaycee Rice as Sean & Kaycee. After that show Sean turned into a viral social media star as well and attracts with videos millions of views. As dancer he appeared on many TV shows, such as, on Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2012 and 2014, on Dancing with the Stars 2013 and The X-Factor together with Carly Rose Sonenclar at the finals in 2012. He was also interview guest concerning dance on NBC Morning News, KTLA5 news and LA TV - The Zoo. He appeared on Sia's music short film video The Greatest with Maddie Ziegler. He performed with Chris Brown and Kris Wu. He later went on to dance for Janet Jackson on her Unbreakable World Tour in 2015.\n\nHe was also one of the important supporting members to help Janelle and her future husband William \"WillDaBeast\" Adams (surname did change, it is Ginestra-Adams now) founding IMMA in 2012/2013[13] and became a member of the crews ImmaBEAST and LilBEAST [14][15]. He was also an early member of the dance group Boy Squad.\n\nPlease support Sean and his fellows Phillip, Makenzie, Megan, and Mark for their crowdfunding request new Artist Clubhouse Feybl. Notable sponsors are already Tessandra Chavez, Paul Karmiryan, Krystin Wong, Dominic Sandoval, Maddie Ziegler, STEEZY Connor, Derek Hough and many more.\n\nBiography[edit | hide all | hide | edit source]\n\nSean started dancing when he was able to walk as got inspired by his two older sisters Sarah and Sirris, who used to be competition dancers as well, by watching them featuring on competing videos, [16] took his first dance classes when he was four and started competing at the age of five. Sean ascribes his love of art to his mother and grandmother, both painters. He started choreographing at the age of ten [17] and got finally his accolade as established choreographer during World of Dance season two by the judges, who were blown away by his unique, smart, well thought, storytelling and emotional choreography with the age of 16. Shortly afterwards he toured with Brain Friedman through Europe[18] and Asia[19] attending conventions and teaching masterclasses - even he actually hates the term, because he doesn't consider himself a master and is just holding workshops. But he already worked before with Janelle and Will for Step Up:Year of the Dance in China.[20] and taught classes in Japan[21], Mexico and, of course, across the US as member of ImmaBEAST as dancer, teacher and choreographer. His first bigger concept video as choreographer, creative director, editor and dancer was \"Life Experiences: Wrong Words\" in June 2017, when he worked first time on a project with his current permanent dance partner and best friend Kaycee Rice. But already \"Miracle\", filmed and edited by \"Typo\", was an impressive work.[22] Later \"Breathe\" was an extraordinary creation as well.[23]\n\nSean stated that he didn't watch often TV or playing video games, but music was an important part of his life right from the beginning. He started choreographing to express himself better by music and dancing. His older sister Serris shot the first videos of his choreography and edited it until he was 12. Soon dance partners like Jordyn Jones or Kenneth San Jose helped him showing his choreography. About after a year Sean took over filming and editing. Was a dance partner missing, a little CGI helped and he danced by himself as duet [24] or got transparent to the background.[25] Later producers like MyTypo or TJ Lewis filmed and edited his choreography with more production effort. His first dance masterclass teaching was filmed when he was 11, to help his sisters school for charity.[26] And the end of the process Sean dropped out as a brilliant camera man, editor, creative director and choreographer. His work can be watched on his YouTube channel or sometimes Instagram account. In 2016, he choreographed and danced for the BET Awards 2016 normees Big Sean, Kanye West & John Legend.\n\nSean has had already an impressive non-dance related child acting career, but he considered the character roles he got as embarrassing. [27] Regarding IMDb, he appeared on TV soup series \"See Dad Run\" (2014), \"Sam & Cat\" (2014), \"Bizaardvark\" (2016), \"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn\" (2014), on the documentary series \"On the Spot Interviews\" (2013), \"Rachael vs. Guy: Kids Cook-Off\" (2016), on home series \"Home & Family\" (2016), on boulevard series \"E! Live from the Red Carpet\" - reporting from The Academy Awards 2015 .and several online-network-series like \"To the Pointe\" (2018). He also appeared on music short film \"Todrick Hall: Freaks Like Me\" (2014). Sean was even part of the ADR (\"Automated\" or \"Automatic\" Dialog Replacement) group of the \"Penguins of Madagascar\" (2014) and added his voice to the film. [28] So FOX thought this man can be helped and made him series regular \"Chris\" in thriller, drama series The Cleaning Lady.\n\nSean was in public school from pre-school to second class middle school, then he tried homeschool, after then he was going a year in public high-school, and got almost kicked out due his missing time, and finally switched back to online homeschooling. He graduated technically high-school at the age of 15, but he was keep going on in high-school, because his parents as non-native English speakers couldn't support him in certain ways. Sean was in his last year in Nov 2019, but he graduated officially at Jun 19th, 2019 at the California Connections Academy. [29][30] He finds the balancing between homeschooling, traveling, teaching and dancing really tough.\n\nSean also dances many years as philanthropist, for causes which matters to him, such as for http://www.idance4acure.org,[31] and supporting to fight childhood cancer. Due his engagement and popularity, and those of many other dancers and choreographers, the funds rises very well, financing research and treatments for children with cancer. Other engagements by him went public are \"#prayforpaloma\" [32], https://pedrogtprelief.org [33] and https://thecameronboycefoundation.org/ [34]. Notable and honorable is his engagement for UN Development Programme with the ambitious goal to end poverty at 2030. By watching the video on his channel to the end $20,000 USD donation was send to UNDP power by Live Nation Concerts and Sean. People of his status normally doesn't bother just to look.\n\nAn other talent he is known for is cooking. His mother is a great cook, so it was only natural that Sean became obsessed with cooking shows. He started cooking when he was seven years old[35] One day her threw a “Family Appreciation Day,” where he re-envisioned their Walnut home as a restaurant. At 11, he cooked a multi- course dinner for his parents and sisters, even serving them like a waiter. “I didn’t know what I was doing, but seeing the emotions on their faces made me really happy,” Sean said at an interview with Jeff Weiss. “I don’t ever really see cooking as a career. It’s always just been a vessel for me to make people happy.\" Later he won on season one episode 13 of \"Chopped Junior\" $10,000 USD [36] and been on season two by six episodes of charity fund raising \"Rachael Vs. Guy: Kids Cook-Off\" [37]. He was cooking to bring other dancers some self-made lollipops and got invited from their parents to cook in their houses and somehow got on the show by that and because he same kids were later on Chopped Junior, he got on this show as well. He loves cooking for family, friends and sometimes the whole company, but, of course, everyone is welcome to join and help preparing, washing and cleaning up. He wanted once to have his own show called \"The Dancing Chef\", but it seems to change to \"The Cooking Dancer\" now. What he later really got was starring on \"Sean Lew Approved\", produced by Kaycee Network, a sort of restaurant and food critics online show, which was renewed for season two despite the low rates, because he knows the producer pretty well.[38] Today he has some entrepreneur partnerships by food and drink products as well as cuisine restaurants and producer. A creation with his co-chef Yitai Geng on July 12, 2023. Later he crossed cooking with fashion with his business partners Geng and Back, and founded the brand ME N U.\n\nSean plays piano since he was six years old. Her won 2nd place at the Music Teachers Association of California when he was eight years old. [39][40] Sean is also noticed as good singer and sound editor. He started singing to support his friend Tate McRae, [41] who is an excellent singer and got at the end of 2020 already four platinum and 11 gold certifications, but he didn't make it public for a long time. He published three music videos by covering \"this town\" by Niall Horan, \"Youth ft. (Kahlid)\" by Shawn Mendes and \"Be Alright\" by Dean Lewis. Or he just grab his smart phone and makes everyone \"Happier\".\n\nHe got the nickname \"Lewser\" by his family, who said it as a joke, but made later a family merchandise by that. [42] The brand is owned by his sisters Serris and Sarah - fashion designer and computer engineer - and himself and offers a small clothing line. It started when he ordered a t-shirt online with the print \"Lewser\" and people were asking where they could get one of these.\n\nHis skills as dancer are not less impressive. He started dancing with his older siblings Sarris and Sarah at Mather Dance Studio at the age of four and became a member of Mather Dance company. He got at the beginning most of his technical training there - ballet, contemporary, jazz, tap, lyrical and hip-hop. He started with tap, then hip-hop and then he was trained within 4-5 years in ballet. He performed his first hip-hop dance on stage even before had a class. Most impressive, he learned ball room dancing as well and won with his partner \"Sia\" at the age of 8 or 9 two championships with the standards Rumba, Samba, Jive, ChaCha and Paso Nova in Latin dancing. [43][44] Due his work as dancing far from the dance community, he took also a lot of dance industrial classes in LA with some of the most influential and established choreographers. On September 2022, he said his favorite style is contemporary. He got first time on The Pulse convention when he was eight years old, and was made to Pulse Protegè without even knowing what is this all about or competing for it, just by the attention of the choreographers, his self-expression in the forefront and his daring clothing. Finally got later on The Pulse on Tour in 2013 at the age of 12 as Elite Protégé and graduated as Elite Alumnus in 2014. Two years before, he met his friend and mentor those days William \"WillDaBEAST\" Adams, who became later to a kind of dance father or big brother for Sean and Sean supported him and his future wife Janelle Ginestra(-Adams) founding ImmaBEAST, by dancing on his videos, finding supporters and even cooking. In these days one of the most important dance industry companies in the world. Sean mixed more and more other influences to his style of dancing. NEYO stated at NBC's World of Dance season two to him: \"I feel I can watch someone else do your choreography and go 'Yeah, that's Sean.'\" In 2015, he competed on YouTube's Teen Dance Challenge together with his friends Talia Seitel, Lucy Vallely, Sophia Lucia and Chloe East and won a two weeks summer intensive scholarship of the Joffery Ballet School, including tuition to his domestic location.[45]\n\nSean also learned the classics beyond mainstream dancing. Especially Galen Hooks, Tessandra Chavez and Nika Kjun gave him frequently retro approaches. Galen let Sean perform The West Side Story like a Broadway veteran,[46][47] hard rock like the 80's (which drives the girls in classes crazy by this animal)[48] and jazz funk.[49] Nika let Sean feel the 70's by Grease, [50] funk and urban dance[51]. Or soft rock by Tessandra [52] His new partner Kaycee Rice stated in NBC's World of Dance season two: \"He is literally good at everything. He is basically like a dance genius.\" His strongest suit is hip-hop.[53] Sean's fingerprint of dancing can be described as the \"Master of 1,001 Figures with Hands and Legs\", making waves with his body[54][55] and the most fierce accentuation of dancers of the younger generation. Giving him millions of permutations by texture movements and basics for innovative choreography as well. Due his ballet training he is capable do 8-10 two-feet-leading pirouettes in row and very fast, even with closed arms (extremely difficult), and a backward barrel, a 360° turn jump backwards with hanging arms.\n\nHe doesn't have such flexibility like his partner Kaycee [56] - he was frequently complaining that he has a spine and cannot do that - but the same musicality. Sean on the other hand has an accentuation by texture movements Kaycee cannot match (hardly anyone can)[57] The couple is always noticed as outstanding, because both are extremely clean, controlled by a lot of multi-coordinated texture movements, fierce accentuation [58] and high expressive performance.[59] Their chemistry is considered legendary for their age. Both were nominated for the Industry Dance Awards 2018 for most fierce dancer under 18, together with Charlize Glass, JT Church and the winner Eva Igo. A long time their relationship was just superficial. They were once competing against each other. Their photo showing around where they stand together as little competion kids was actually an one time intiative by their parents and after that they went separated paths for a very long time. They bombed frequently into each other in classes and at some point Sean was like, 'Ok, I see you too often not knowing your name.' And one day he had asked her, if she minded to join him as a partner for an Institute in his first bigger concept video \"Life Experience: Wrong Words\" and then they learned each other. - \"He found the perfect little partner. Didn't he?\" asked Jennifer Lopez & Derek Hough at NBC World of Dance 2018 and Derek agreed when Sean & Kaycee entered the stage for their 'The Cut' performance. And the dance world and maybe some of the TV watchers agreed either, because after the show they got very prominent, especially younger people were standing in line for selfies with them and many videos where they both get featured went viral; individually or as duet.\n\nIn 2019, Sean choreographed a music video for mega-star Meghan Trainor \"AFTER YOU (Directed by Charm La'Donna)\" on Vevo-YT with just 17 years old and is starring with Kaycee on it as duet. Meghan was actually a secret fan of Sean for many years and they finally met at October 31, 2019. He started in April a crowd funding project for his new short film of dancing cultures worldwide with planned budget $65,000 USD, but the subject changed later and he didn't get raised the target budget. He was nominated for an Arena Award in the category \"Rising Star of the year\" together with Emma Portner, Logan Edra and the winner Bailey Sok. He was performing the NBC World of Dance World Final intermezzo show on season three together with Kaycee Rice and Ian Eastwood while NE-YO was singing on stage. They got the honor to be in line with dance legends like Les Twins, Keone & Mari Madrid, Derek Hough, The Kinjaz, The Lab, Charity Anderson & Andres Peñate and Michael Dameski. Finally the Step Up: Year of the Dance (aka Step Up China or Step Up 6) movie was released. Sean was assistant choreographer and dancer for it along with William \"Willdabeast\" Adams, Janelle Ginestra-Adams and Jaken Isaiah Preston, featuring Jade Cynoweth and Janelle Ginestra-Adams and Wei Qi and SuperDino are starring - against USA Phantom Dancers in the final battle. It is currently with about $17,000,000 USD estimated budget Sean's biggest project he participated in. [60] A convention dance video with Kaycee to the song \"False Confidence\" by Noah Kahan went viral by 5M+ views within just one month and got Noah's personal attention and the Australian invited them to perform in LA live on stage with him.[61] When Sean turned 18 he celebrated it in Iceland at Reykjavík with his family and Kaycee [62] Before became an adult he already visited many countries in the world. In this year it was at least China, Dominican Republic, Poland, Japan, Iceland and Denmark. Not many people can claim to be a world citizen at his age.\n\nIn 2020, he choreographed for mega-star Justin Bieber on his music video \"At Least For Now\", was solo starring on it and Sean leveled-up to celebrity choreographer at the age of 18. Just few days before, Justin's new music video \"That's What Love Is\" was released, where he is with Kaycee Rice one of six starring dance couples and he had also with Kaycee choreographed the kick off and episode three of Disney's new dance series On The One! and they were performing it with some friends, before Kaycee broke her ankle shortly afterwards. However, this was WARP-speed in the fast lane during the coronavirus quarantine period, when many people get frustrated on perspectives to find dance gigs in future due national-wide shutdowns and economical downswings.\n\nOn February 27, 2021 he released his \"II: AN UNSPOKEN NARRATIVE\" - The Short Film\" and broke some rare records. The \"short film\" has about an hour length, had 285.000 views in four days and got about 38,000 likes by just 51! dislikes (about 745:1) and broke his own record of False Confidence by 220:1 on about 28M+ views at that time, which is for a YouTube video with that many hits extremely rare. In the film are starring some of best industry dancers in the world. The full cast - himself, Kaycee Rice, Tre De Rego, Kea Peahu, Destinee Mayarea, Hiro Homura, Giselle Silva, Jaime Mora, Isaac Meija, Leilani Zepeda, Ava Chavarria, Bailey Sok, Julian DeGuzman, Stephanie Mincone, Connor Gormley, Shannon Kelly, Zack Everheart, Marie Spieldenner, Zach Venegas, Anthony Westlake, Matthew Kubitz, Emma Hauser, Ashlynn Malia, Leconte Banks and Jazz Smith. Director of Photography/Gimbal Operator are Gerald Nonato und Nick Kim. Unit Still Photographers are Lee Gumbs and Chad Brady. Choreography by Sean Lew, Tessandra Chavez and Benji Schwimmer. It is featuring also some spiritual locations like the tree house at the end. DanceSpirit was headlining after an interview: \"Sean Lew's New Film is Bound to Leave You Speechless\" [63]. How he gets it done with the low budget?! Because most of crew and cast are friends and he had some family support. The film won a New York’s Oniro Film Award in the category \"Best Dance Choreography\" in March and was already introduced on two short film festivals in Venice and Montreal in 2020. He delivered with 19, four years later after he had the idea and adds on his calling card producer, script writer and director now. Shortly afterward he signed for crime, drama and thriller series \"The Cleaning Lady\" as Chris. The first season premiered at Sep 9th, 2021 on FOX with international releases.[64] Sean got regular in first season. Not bad for someone who thought once his acting is embarrassing. In June he has taught his first dance class at the Millennium Dance Complex LA. [65] Insane, but when most of his fellow pro dancers properly celebrating their first teaching class at the \"most iconic dance studio in the world\" as an important milestone of their careers, for Sean it feels just natural; not worth mentioning. On Dec 13, Sean & Kaycee attended the The World Choreography Awards 2021, the \"Oscars of Dance\". They were nominated in the category Digital Content twice for their Disney Channel dance videos - Party in the USA and Don't Start Now.[66][67]\n\nIn 2022, he directed and edited the entire `AMERICAN BALLET THEATRE 2022 Campaign’ posted it as director's cut, but Director of Photography was an old friend - Scott David Winn. Scott composed and played also the score and Sean was singing to it.[68] As expected, The Cleaning Lady was renewed for season two and Sean plays Chris again premiered on Sep 19,2022 on FOX. He got right from the beginning more responsibility of the development of the story line. He earned some trust by director and producer, but if he still messes up, he has to die, go to prison or something else. No pressure. Sean's activities stayed diversified. He worked further in fashion business, cuisine, as choreographer and teacher, visited Japan, and found some time shoot the concept video with Kaycee It's Okay where he did the choreography. Scott DW shoot with Sean a new short film - \"MONSTER\" [69] Since November 2022, Sean started V-logging his personal life on monthly basis - 11/22. In December, he co-choreographed and performed also for Jackson Wang's music video Come Alive and hold a workshop class with pro fellows @haruto.0117 and @shu_riii322 at the GEEKOUT World 2022 in Yokohama, Japan.[70]\n\nOn February 1, 2023, Fox decided to renew The Cleaning Lady for third season and Sean stays regular on the show. The early renewal for The Cleaning Lady could also serve as a hedge against the eventual strike by writers, actors or directors in the coming months. On-air ratings for The Cleaning Lady cooled some in its second season: The drama averaged 3.52 million viewers per episode with a week of delayed viewing, according to Nielsen (those figures don’t include streaming), versus 5.17 million for its first season. Per Fox, the show’s multi-platform audience was 5.4 million viewers for season two, a 53 percent jump over the Nielsen seven-day figure.[71] But after five months of the WGA Strike, and three months SAG-AFTRA Strike, the premiere was not expected before 2024. On February 22, 2023, Sean posted his choreo video for the Vibrancy convention Ungrateful Eyes - Jon Billion with Kaycee and went strait in tradition of False Confidence with 45M+ views at that time and they set a kind of trademark here. Sean choreographed also for Jacob Chase's musical short film Troubles[72] On March, he taught at the Radical Forze Jam & Summerjam Dance Camp Convention in Da Nang, Vietnam[73] , - FALLIN by Inayah | - RIE HATA Choreography, Bang by Jacob Banks & Tobe Nwigwe, Voices again, Jumbotron Sh*t Popping by Drake doing Josh Price choreography with him and an unknown young lady, was freestyling, attended a dance battle at the beach and shot a concept video. On April 11, 2023, he was co-starring with Brynn Cartelli on her new music video \"Secondhand Smoke\" where he choreographed the dance ând was the co-producer with Brynn as well.[74] From April 30, 2023 to May 1, 2023, he was part of the faculty of the Urban Dance United 2022 in Radès, Tunesia - RAYE - Five Star Hotels, second class solo, Flume - Voices and performed with Jade Chynoweth as duo to same song and to Blackpink's Pretty Savage choreographed by Jane Kim. After that he flight, properly ultrasonics, to New York City, USA to perform next day as part of the Wiggle Crew with his fellows Jade Chynoweth, Sienna Lalau, Taylor Hatala, Alexander Chung & Kenneth San Jose at the func'tion XII 2022 convention and had a nice chill out at the Brickhouse in NYC to Sienna Lalau's choreography. Sean competes also on the RedBulL Dance 2023 and advanced to the second round in Chicago. His strength & conditioning trainer Karl Flores prepared him five months for the event. They started a documentation series The New Mindset about Sean's training (episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Last - Director Sean, Director of Photography Donovan Okimura and Alex Lackey, Editing Alex Lackey). He started it, because he wanted to face his biggest fear in dance: battling. On April he was creative director and choreographer for the entire Jackson Wang Coachella Show 2023 (tech rehearsal video). He directed also with Jackson Wang his new music video Cheetah. On May 22, Sean was crowned as the new Red Bull ‘Dance Your Style’ USA Champion 2023[75] - Finale Battle Daisy VMZ vs Sean Lew (Sean's battle analysis).

There was a hell of competition (Line-up), because about 4,370 dancers competed in 45 national championships plus three handpicked dancers and eight wild cards for the final directly by the promoter had sent some of the world's best street dancers. He had to qualify in pre-final 1 by being under the top 4 of 24 in a KO system. - Pre-Final 1: Ryu, Akim, Neha, Dimas, Almas, Verb, Leonidou, Black Joker, Odour, Phex, Andre DB, Adamson, Sean Lew, Mostafa, Jedras, J XYB, Tevin Not Kevin, Skitta Star, Lil Syd, Viegas, Luwam, Volkan Arici, Hector und Nahiel.

Simmons II and Skyler Sharp. He auditioned first round and impressed the judges Todrick Hall, Ladia Yates and Devon Werkheiser. Choreographer Matt Steffanina set up the choreography for next round for a trio and Sean won the competition and $5,000 USD due his shining, accentuated and controlled performance. [90][91]\n\nWorld of Dance[edit | hide | edit source]\n\nIn 2017, he performed as member of ImmaBEAST with his crew members Josh Price, Will Simmons, Julian Deguzman, Josh Beauchamp, Jenna Alvarez, Reese Hatala, Nat Bebko, Tayler Reef, Sienna Lalau and Kerrynton Jones in the Junior Division on season one of NBC's World of Dance and were eliminated in The Cut. But their qualifying routine was completely \"cut out\" from the show and even their scores weren't announced. There is still a rehearsal video left of the routine. [92] In The Duels they won against Mini Request, but neither opponent dancing was shown, nor their individual scores by judging. [93] And in The Cut just their final score was shown and that they were eliminated. However, some members performed on season two. Josh Price became a member of S-Rank, Josh Beauchamp performed as Josh & Taylor with his partner Taylor Hatala, her 11 years old sister Reese Hatala with her new partner Sarah Phoenix as LULAS [94] - and got \"cut out\" again - and Sean with Kaycee Rice as Sean & Kaycee. Below are the scores of the rounds they participated in.\n\nQualifiers (Wall To Wall) AVERAGE unknown\n\nDuels Round (Juice) Mini Request 85.7 ImmaBEAST 86.0\n\nThe Cut (Look At Me Now) AVERAGE 84.2\n\nIn 2018, on the NBC World of Dance show season 2 he performed with his partner Kaycee Rice as Sean & Kaycee, getting second in Divisional Final and they became one of the most popular acts of the show with a lot of special clips and interviews by NBC. Both were contacted individually by different people to join the show, but at the beginning they declined. Sean, because of his experience of been \"cut out\" of the show, he didn't want experience it again and felt he wasn't self-assure enough, he couldn't choreograph it under that time pressure in front of millions alone. And Kaycee because she had no idea how do it alone. Later Sean changed his mind, considered participation and gave Kaycee a face-time call if she minded to join as a duo. She said immediately \"Yes!\", and instantly dropped the mobile on the floor after that and Sean was just watching the ceiling for about 10 minutes, and was asking like \"Kaycee?!?\", while on both sides the parents were cheering them up \"Go for it!\". The next two hours there was silence at the phone to process how to manage it in detail. They decided having not too much hope they would survive to next rounds and didn't prepare for more than just one round. Telling a story that matters and inspires to anyone was more important for them than top scoring. They just wanted show case their performance skills and Sean's choreography.[95] Sean filmed with Kaycee behind-the-scene documentaries during each round, how they choreographed and rehearsed four routines under time pressure and became best friends by that. Sean stated later for him the most important part of the show aftermath was that he found in Kaycee someone who is really understanding why he is dancing and is sharing same motivation and attitude. Kaycee said later they add the blindfolds in rehearsals of The Qualifiers three days before the show and changed the routine completely the day before the show after a terrible failure, when she hit him by a push.\n\nBut they got huge laudation during the show. Jennifer Lopez eulogized them as with \"If anyone in this competition can be called prodigies, it's Sean and his partner Kaycee.\" ... \"You have a real talent\" ...\"technically perfect\" ... \"You move me in a way I cannot explain sometimes.\" and actually broke out into tears after Sean & Kaycee had the nerves to perform half of their qualifiers routine blindfolded in front of 8.5 million watchers (air day + 7 days) on national television later (taped 4 months before), making an huge impact in the dance community. Jenna Dewan stated in an interview later: \"I swear to you, they are the future of choreography and dance.\"[96] After first airing the adorable couple was no longer treated as dance stars, but as common celebrities, who pointed out that they are just best friends and not dating (yet). Below are the scores of the rounds they participated in.\n\nQualifiers (Silence) Ne-Yo 97 Jennifer Lopez 96 Derek Hough 95 AVERAGE 96\n\nDuels Round (Grimey) 3 Xtreme 87 Sean & Kaycee 93.3\n\nThe Cut (Can I Be Him) Ne-Yo 88 Jennifer Lopez 94 Derek Hough 94 AVERAGE 92\n\nDivisional Final (The Way I Do) Ne-Yo 91 Misty Copeland 92 Jennifer Lopez 95 Derek Hough 91 AVERAGE 92.3\n\nNote: Regarding IMDb he performed on season 6 (2011) on America's Got Talent at Seattle auditions, but regarding other sources he performend on season 8.

He is the most talented dancer I've ever met.\" (Tate McRae - Tate's YT Q&A)\n\n\"I think, art is not what Sean does. Art is who Sean is.\" (His fitness & condition trainer Karl Flores)\n\n\"I think, what makes Sean unique as a dancer is his ability to tell stories.\" (Karl Flores)\n\n\"If Zoomers are often stereotyped as distracted and anxious narcissists addicted to social media, Lew comes off as the diametric opposite. Despite being one of the best and most famous dancers on Earth, he speaks gently and with striking empathy. His phone is nowhere in sight. He makes eye contact with the concentration of a Zen master. His discipline, politeness and humility lend the wizened air of someone who has lived several lifetimes before this one. The old-soul calm is a stark contrast to his electric charisma and Olympian dance floor athleticism. \" (Jeff Weiss about his interview with Sean. He should talk about it with Sean again ...)\n\n“Sean was always self-motivated. He’s the one who went out in search of projects, trying new things.\" (his older sister Sarah)\n\n“My parents always wanted to keep him levelheaded. He still had to get good grades. There was that expectation that even if you’re an amazing dancer, there’s a business aspect. You have to communicate well with people. No matter how famous he got, my parents cared most about how hard he was working.”(his older sister Serris Lew)\n\nBy Sean[edit | hide | edit source]\n\n\"Where is love, there is life!\" (his \"Golden Quote\")\n\n\"When all the dust is settled and all the crowds are gone. The things that matter are faith, family, and friends.\" (Sean's epilogue of his \"ICELAND\" video)\n\n\"I can’t party. I’m antisocial. I like to be at home before midnight,” Lew laughs. “My best friends are in their late 20s and older. I love that. I love being around people who are better than me. I love being around people who know more than me, because it inspires me to want to know more.\" (Sean in his interview with Jeff Weiss)\n\n“At public school, I got made fun of for being a male dancer. When I tried to play basketball, I got pushed away or laughed at for the clothes I wore, or the career I was trying to pursue. In public school, I found myself a little depressed and lost.” (Sean about the year he spent at junior high before switching to homeschooling. Yeah, many male young dancers switch the #METOO on now for being or been bullied.)\n\n“My biggest supporter is definitely my mother. Biggest fan ever. No one can beat her. which is one of the trillion reasons why I love her more than anything. She’s been with me since day one, literally, and we’ve been through everything together as I grew to be the person I am today.\" (Interview Naluda Magazine)\n\n\"We all can dance really good, we are all amazing dancers. But unless we have something to say, we blind it. And remember, we are not going to be like: Oh, I'm the best dancer here. There is no such thing. Yeah, there is no such thing. So it's more about: OK, what makes me special? What is my superpower? What can I do what no one else can touch? And to honest, you already have it. Yeah, you already have it. Now you have to say what that is. Ask yourself where are these things? What are these questions? Where are these answers? I cannot teach you that. You have to ask yourself that. Everybody has his own like attitude. Like this or like this *showing walking fingers*. That the beauty of it. It's all like: What I would gonna do? So turn it off the entire time. Does it make sense? - Cool!\" (Sean's teaching intro in one of his classes - see dear Jeff what he meant?!)\n\n\"“The beauty and curse of my life, is I just want to do everything.” (Interview by Kristi Yeung, concerning his new first steps into creative and film directoring)\n\nFun Facts[edit | hide | edit source]\n\nDue all public confirmed information and an indiscreet video Sean is NOT dating Kaycee (yet). They tried an innocent shot at the early days, but it didn't worked out. Sean described the love for Kaycee as pure platonic.[129] But as long as they work permanently together, the rumors will never stop. In general, Sean and Kaycee don't talk about their relationships in public. They appreciate their privacy in this matter. Wise decision. Correction: In an interview on September 2022 he admitted, he never kissed anyone yet. Two things. First, he is such a hopeless nerd. So much for \"You never be ready for the ring, until you step into the ring.\" (Red Bull docu \"Sean Lew's Journey\"). Despite underdeveloped chasing skills, he cannot complain about a lack of offers. Maybe a little bit too picky, because he doesn't look like anti-sexual. And second, we said: WISE DECISION !!!\n\nA couple years ago Sean was mentoring Ayden Nguyen of THE LAB a little, nicked \"The Mini Sean Lew\", who is the NBC World of Dance Champion 2018 with his team mates, is listed as one of the Top 100 Child Prodigies in the world and many more [130], and one day both appeared in class with colored a white metallic strip in their black hair like a skunk, and instantly the hype increased.\n\nBy the \"False Confidence\" video Sean & Kaycee got really immortal. As of March 2024, it is the very first convention video ever with about 50M views. Zeus himself made a reaction video from Olympus about his former student's Werk. Countless dancers tried to cover the performance and choreography of Sean & Kaycee master work and posted their videos, and even an animation video was made. But the dance video with most views of all times at that pointe was Baby Shark Dance Animal Songs with about 14 billion views. That happens if you throw your smartphone into the cradle, just to get some silence.\n\nAt November 2019, his favorite dream celebrities he would like work with are Beyoncé and Rami Malek. His favorite dancer collaboration would be Keone Madrid, but he was sitting in the Kinjaz Dojo when he said that. Keone was a former The Kinjaz member and is currently enjoining his father luck anyways. - Baby Girl, Numah, no superpowers detected yet, but \"more poo poo\". :-)[131]\n\nAdditional Pages[edit | hide | edit source]\n\nSean Lew/Gallery\n\nSean Lew/Filmography\n\nSean Lew/Professional Stage Credits and Convention Assistance\n\nReferences[edit | hide | edit source]\n\n[edit | hide | edit source]"
