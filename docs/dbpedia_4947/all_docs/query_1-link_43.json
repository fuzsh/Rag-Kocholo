        "text": "TEAM Wellington FC are debutants in the Fiji Airways Oceania Champions League and they want a win to sign off their season as a successful one.\n\nCoach Matt Calcott said their season which ended last week was not that much of a success but winning the Champions League would be icing on the cake.\n\nThe team consists of former Waitakere and Auckland City players and some who have donned the All Whites Jersey.\n\n“We have a lot of experience in the team and a lot of players that have been to the Oceania Champions League so we are very excited about it. It is a new territory for us, we have to get to a good start and the boys looked very good this afternoon and it’s looking all very positive,” Calcott said.\n\n“The temperature at the moment is just fine, it is just like Wellington. Climate is not going to be an issue but the early kick off maybe.\n\n“Our local competition finished just over a week ago and that finished with a little bit of disappointment, now we have got an opportunity to make this a successful season and the boys are raring to go and we are looking forward to Sunday.”\n\nMajority of the boys are New Zealand-based except Solomons Islands Henry Fa’arodo.\n\nCaptain and midfielder Cole Peverly said the players knew the task on hand was a massive one.\n\n“Our first game this Sunday will not be an easy one. The boys are prepared and are raring to go. We have been talking and I think the players realise what is required of them,” he said.\n\nWellington FC takes on Tefana of Tahiti at 7pm on Sunday evening.\n\nWellington FC; Michael O’Keeffe, Dan Clarke, Alex Carr, Aaron Scott, Justin Gulley, Bill Robertson, Tim Myers, Henry Fa’arodo, Cole Peverley, Jarrod Smith, Luis Corrales, Michael Gwyther, Ian Hogg, Alex Feneridis, Jake Butler, Chris Bale, Tom Jackson, Mickael Partodikromo, Adam Cowan, Sean Lovemore."
