        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nA Beef Wellington Recipe Fit for a King and Queen (and Princes & Princesses!)\n\nThe traditional Beef Wellington recipe is made with a beef tenderloin wrapped in a puff pastry and then baked. The dish, created in England in the 19th century, is believed to be named after the Duke of Wellington, and is said created by his chef.\n\nThere are many different recipes for Beef Wellington, (even a single-serve size Individual Beef Wellington recipe) but the traditional way is with beef tenderloin. However, you could use a ribeye roast or sirloin butt roast. You could even use a pork tenderloin if you prefer.\n\nBut for me, the best Wellington is with a beef tenderloin. This prime cut of meat is very tender and has a lot of flavor. When it is wrapped in pastry, it creates a delicious and impressive dish perfect for any special occasion.\n\nIt truly is a special dish. It’s not just the beef that makes it so, but the entire package. The beef is encased in a pastry shell, which is then baked. This creates a beautiful crust that seals in all of the flavors of the beef. The result is a juicy, tender piece of meat that is absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\n\nTen side dishes that are delicious with Beef Wellington:\n\nAsparagus Tips\n\nButtered Green Beans\n\nButternut Squash Bisque\n\nClassic French Onion Soup\n\nPotatoes Au Gratin\n\nGarlic Mashed Potatoes\n\nFondant Potatoes – Cheese Stuffed Potatoes\n\nStuffed Onion – Using a Sweet Vidalia Onion\n\nStuffed Portobello Mushroom with Arugula Salad\n\nSpinach Salad with Garlic Custard & Hot Bacon Dressing\n\nStep by Step Guide - The Perfect Beef Wellington Recipe\n\nChef Jean-Pierre\n\nHello there friends, come and watch my Step by Step Video Guide below on how to make the Perfect Beef Wellington. It may be time-consuming. Although there is a lot of prep you can all do this! It is not as difficult as many expect. And it makes the perfect meal for those special occasions and holidays. Or make it for a dinner party and really blow your guests' minds! So, let's get cooking!\n\n4.43 from 89 votes\n\nCalories\n\nRecipe Video\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n\nPrepare the Meat:\n\n1 Filet trimmed about 2 pounds\n\n2 tablespoons Clarified Butter or your favorite cooking oil\n\n2 tablespoons Dijon Mustard\n\nSalt and Pepper\n\nMake the Duxelle:\n\n2 tablespoons Butter\n\n10 ounces Portobello Mushrooms cut into very small pieces\n\n¼ cup Shallots minced\n\n¾ cup ham, no water added diced into very small dice\n\n2 tablespoons Tarragon chopped\n\nPorcini Salt, if you have some if not regular salt will work as well and pepper to taste\n\n1 Egg White\n\nMake the Crepe Batter (make about 2 cups and 6 Crepes):\n\n2 large Eggs\n\n1 cup Whole Milk\n\n1 cup All-Purpose Flour\n\n2 tablespoons Butter melted\n\nSalt and Pepper to taste\n\nWrap the Filet and Prepare it for the Oven:\n\n2 to 3 Crepes depending on their size and the size of your Filet\n\n8 to 10 VERY THIN Slices of Prosciutto\n\n2 cups of cooled Mushroom Duxelle\n\n3 Egg Yolks - mixed with 2 tablespoons Milk for the egg wash\n\nCook ModePrevent your screen from going dark\n\nRecipe Instructions\n\nPrepare the Meat:\n\nSalt and pepper your filet and Sauté it BRIEFLY in clarified butter in a 375ºF/190ºC to create a nice crust.Brush with Dijon mustard generously and wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours\n\nMake the Duxelle:\n\nIn a large frying pan, add butter and when hot add shallots, sauté until LIGHT golden brown. Add the mushroom and cook slowly until ALL the water has evaporated. This could easily take 10/12 minutes. Add the ham and the tarragon. Transfer to a glass bowl and add on add egg white. And let it cool in a cookie sheet to allow the moisture to escape easier.\n\nMake the Crepe Batter (make about 2 cups and 6 Crepes):\n\nMake the crepe batter and if you have time let is rest in the fridge for 24 hours. This will produce a more relax crepe not as elastic and rubbery as it can be if you use the batter right away.In a glass bowl just mix all the ingredients until nice a smooth, if you have a blender do not hesitate to use it!\n\nCook the Crepes:\n\nUse the largest NON-STICK frying pan you have heat some butter ,when hot at about 300ºF pour 3 to 4 ounces of the batter (depending on the size of your pan) and cook the crepe like the Chef did in the video.\n\nWrap the Filet and Prepare it for the Oven:\n\nPreheat Oven to 400 ºF/ 205 ºC:\n\nFirst put one or two crepes on your kitchen counter and carefully measure with your filet to make sure you’ll have enough “real estate” to cover the filet. Like the chef did in the video.Top the crepes carefully with the prosciutto.Top the prosciutto with the duxelle to cover the entire surface.Wrap the filet with plastic wrap the let it rest in the fridge for a few minutes while you take out your dough from the fridge.\n\nWrap with the pastry like the Chef did in the video.\n\nBAKE AT 400 ºF / 205 ºC UNTIL THE DOUGH IS GOLDEN BROWN\n\nYou can find the items below used in making this dish at our online store!\n\nPrivate Notes"
