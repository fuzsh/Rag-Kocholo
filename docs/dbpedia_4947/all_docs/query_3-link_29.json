So I let him answer a few mailbag questions. Ask more in the comments.\n\nPick one\n\nOkstate Gents - We? Since you and me haven't discussed this, I don't know if I can speak on behalf of us. Is there a none of the above option though? Find me new blood. Actually, do you want to come coach?\n\nGerald - I have to say probably Wickline. But only if we can erase the past two years. But a new coach all together would work too.\n\nI wish\n\nOkstate Gents - It's as possible as me having a Limey race at the end of the night and not blacking out. So very unlikely.\n\nI'm not even sure this is a question\n\nOkstate Gents - The Clint Chelf? Has a special spot reserved next to Moses probably. He set my people free.\n\nGerald - I used to think there was no such thing as a stupid question. But then I read this.\n\nWhat is love? Baby don't hurt me\n\nOkstate Gents - What is love? What type of love? How strong do I love them? This is all too fast. I haven't gotten a chance to yell at either in person so it's more of long distance social media relationship where I gripe and they never know and go on with their lives probably. But to answer your question, lol.\n\nGerald - I love lamp.\n\nI think you mispelled something\n\nOkstate Gents - Mike didn't mention it to me when we were having mimosas and omelets during our usual Sunday brunch. I'll ask the orange facturd.\n\nGerald - Wouldn't be surprised to see Yurcich gone or even a position coach or two.\n\nThe question everyone's asking.\n\nOkstate Gents - I don't even go to school here how would I know? (Kidding)\n\nGerald - Because cheering for a team called the Cowboys means you have to be realistic but unrealistic at the same time."
