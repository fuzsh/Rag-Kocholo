        "text": "So I missed last round and this ones easy as most teams have never played each other before but here is a preview for the Quarter finals this weekend\n\nSaturday 4 August\n\nManukau United (NPL) v Cashmere Technical (MPL, SIL), Centre Park, Mangere, KO 2pm\n\nManukau United are a new club, but they have Kevin Fallon at the helm and he has won the cup before with Nelson United. Although he probably provided some easy motivation for Cashmere Technical when he described them in his blog as Aaron Clapham and 10 other blokes!\n\nCashmere Technical won the cup in 2013 & 14\n\nPICK Think Manukau will win due to the home advantage, whatever the score follow Manukau United on twitter for an entertaining afternoon, the account would make even the dullest 0-0 draw seem entertaining!\n\nOnehunga Sports (NPL) v Western Suburbs (CL), Waikaraka Park, Onehunga KO 2pm\n\nThis is THE game of the round, defending champions against probably the most exciting football team in NZ for a long time\n\nOnehunga will be with out their coach, who is away in Fiji with the U20s. Wests could have lost 5 players to the U20s but they haven't gone\n\nWests have won the Cup three times, 1935, 71 and 2006\n\nPICK a very entertaining game with some lovely football, think Wests will edge it but wouldn't be surprised if it goes to pens\n\nAll I really know is if you are in Auckland and trying to pick which game to go to, pick this one\n\nWairarapa United (CL) v Birkenhead United (NPL), Masterton Memorial Park, KO 5pm\n\nRapa 2011 winners up against Birko 2016 winners, another one that is very hard to pick and could easily go to pens\n\nSunday 5th August\n\nNelson Suburbs (MPL, SIL) v East Coast Bays (NPL), Saxton Field, Nelson, KO 2pm\n\nNelson Suburbs best run in the cup came in 2008, they got to the semi finals that year where they lost 2-1 to......East Coast Bays, ECB went on to win the cup that year which is their best ever performance\n\nPICK I'd love to say Nelson, but got a feeling that ECB will be too strong for them\n\nWests 4 , Onehunga 1. Probably should have been more but Onehunga did well to make a game of it after being 3-0 down early on. Not sure what the opposite of men against boys is ? Onehunga ended with 9 , and Wests had a player (previously substituted I think sent late on. Was surprised at how direct Wests were but probably a good idea as Onehungas game plan was basically to try and physically kick the Wests kids. Also Wests tended to over elaborate when they played it slower and muffed a few chances to extend their lead. Wests too quick generally and a lot of mistimed tackles resulted. Was surprised as to how calm Declan was on the bench and thought it was interesting that he largely stayed out of the dressing room at half time.. Did hear on the touchline that McCowatt and Just off soon.\n\nWests were absolute class. No only are they are a bunch of skilled footballers, every single one of them played with their heads and were fully engaged into to whatever Declan was instructing. Played a constantly changing game plan that was orchestrated by the manager on the side of the pitch. And to put the polish on it, they're even willing to work their arses off closing down, etc.\n\nRight from the get go Onehunga turned up to play \"kick the kids\" and were rightly got punished for it. Could have easily been more cards.\n\nFull time Cashmere Tech 2 - Manukau Utd 1\n\nTech through to the semis again.\n\nSounds from the audio commentary like Tech did well to withstand Manukau pressure in first half to come back and win it in the second.\n\nWinner from Tom Schwarz from a corner.\n\nThat boy scores a lot of goals for a centre-back.\n\nManukau United (NPL) v Cashmere Technical (MPL, SIL), Centre Park, Mangere, KO 2pm\n\nManukau United are a new club, but they have Kevin Fallon at the helm and he has won the cup before with Nelson United. Although he probably provided some easy motivation for Cashmere Technical when he described them in his blog as Aaron Clapham and 10 other blokes!\n\nCashmere Technical won the cup in 2013 & 14\n\nHey Kev, how's it going? Sorry, probably should have told you, those other 10 lads are just as good as AC :)\n\nbunter wrote:\n\n(though Wests did play a few long balls towards Billingsley; probably a good tactic in this game).\n\nHeard a few people around me commenting that Wests were playing long-ball. (lol)\n\nThe difference being that they'd keep possession and wait until Onehunga set a high defensive line, then they wouldn't hesitate to play over top.\n\nNot stupid at all when:\n\na) your players are fast\n\nb) the opposition is playing a high line and\n\nc) the people playing the long balls aren't being pressured\n\n20 Legend wrote:\n\nbunter wrote:\n\n(though Wests did play a few long balls towards Billingsley; probably a good tactic in this game).\n\nHeard a few people around me commenting that Wests were playing long-ball.

People misinterpret why Declan likes his teams to keep the ball. It's not about passing the ball into the back of the net every time, it's about controlling the game and then finding the way to break the opponent down, whether it's playing through, around, or over. This is Declan's best team so far, in part because they're very adaptable without having to alter their basic shape or playing style. Whoever they get next, they will find a way to score goals.\n\nYakcall wrote:\n\nWell draw Monday/Tuesday is going to be interesting. Have Auckland (Birkenhead), Wests (Wellington), Suburbs (Nelson) and Tech (Christchurch). Quite possible there will be no semi in Auckland. Be really interesting to see if NZF still hold the final at QBE if there is no Auckland team. Though that could still be dictated by the Kate Sheppard Cup probably still having Auckland team in it. 2x Auckland with Glenfield and Forrest Hill, Wellington with United and Dunedin with Technical.\n\nboth Auckland teams are playing each other in the KS Cup semi so only be 1 Auckland team in that final\n\nThere is precedent for NZF moving the final, they played it in Palmerston North when Napier and Wairarapa made the final in 2011\n\nand they moved it to Christchurch in 2013 when Cashmere Tech made the final against Waitakere and Coastal Spirit were in the womens cup final against Glenfield\n\nHere's hoping for Western Suburbs making the Chatham Cup Final and Wellington United making the KS Cup final!\n\nI’ve known Mohamed Awad since he was young and he’s had experience in the USA, doing the College/Football thing. He has played national league a few years ago with Waikato and is a player of huge potential. He is also a very nice guy and a top student as well and a very level headed person. Would be great if someone (like the Phoenix) could give him an opportunity.\n\nbunter wrote:\n\nOnehunga 1-4 Wests\n\nWests played better, more skilful football and could have won by more.\n\nOnehunga (by their twitter feed) conceded 8 yellow cards to six players (i.e. two sent off), all for foul play. One of the yellows (to their captain) could have been a straight red - their card count could have been higher. Is it time NZ Football directed refs to toughen up on foul play, so skillful players can develop?\n\nWests - one red for abusing the match officials, one contested yellow for diving (Billingsley; I'd question if he has the ability to dive) and two yellows for foul play.\n\nThat tells the story - a traditional physical-to-dirty NZ team vs a team playing skillful possession based football (though Wests did play a few long balls towards Billingsley; probably a good tactic in this game).\n\nStandout players today IMO for Wests were Awad, then a gap to Just and McCowatt.\n\nAwad looked the best of the Wests. Best touch, really nice; also very fast, good passing, dribbling and vision. Like Singh, but faster - or Krishna, without quite the finishing ability (in this game). Dangerous in possession, and drew a great save from Caunter with a shot from 20m out. Would be interesting to see how he went at a higher level. NZ / Somali; 24.\n\nJust and McCowatt also showed good touch, passing and vision but both made a few mistakes.\n\nFor Onehunga - Sean Lovemore was aggressive, determined, skillful at times and effective. Their late sub (41 - Boon Ozawa?) didn't get much of a run but looked promising.\n\nEdge - passionate and vocal, full of instructions. I wonder if the team would play even better if he left them to it.\n\nHere's hoping Wests win the cup.\n\nYea the commentary is largely spot on.\n\nWests were too good and embarrased Sports in my opinion. Quite a few of the Sports supporters were quite salty after the game blaming the ref for the result. Sports went in early to kick Wests players and got punished for it. Sports simply were not in Wests class and got punished to trying to biff the kids. Maybe they thought the physical game would scare them but up against the Greeks and some of the animals in Central League, they would have seen that all before. Just a dumb tactical ploy from Sports."
