        "text": "LEARNING CULTURE\n\nWellington Middle-High School (WMHS) exists to ignite curiosity, to nuture resilency, and to inspire lifelong learning. We believe that teaching and learning must be interactive, meaningful, and appropriate to each student's development and learning style so that all students have access to grade level standards. WMHS strives to be a safe, nuturing school where self-confidence, self-worth, a growth mindset, and initiative are promoted and celebrated!\n\nCORE VALUES\n\nCommunity - We prioritize relationships and collectively own outcomes\n\nInnovation - We believe challenges drive change\n\nEquity - We believe everyone should have what they need to be successful\n\nOpportunity - We believe in the choice to pursue and engage in our passions\n\nTHE HISTORY\n\nThe first schoolhouse in Wellington town limits was a two-story building built around 1902. The old frame building was replaced by a brick building in 1917. That was replaced by the new Eyestone Elementary School in 1973.\n\nWellington High School, 1926-1964\n\nWellington High School was first opened in 1926 and graduated its last class in 1964. At that time, high school students from Wellington changed attendance to the newly opened Poudre High School. The high school building remained open for junior high students through 1993. In 1993, the original building was replaced with the building that currently houses the middle school. Throughout this timeline, the secondary schools in Wellington have maintained the Eagle mascot, and school colors of maroon and white.\n\nWellington Middle School (formerly Junior High), 1993 - 2022\n\nThe current building that used to house Wellington Middle School was built in 1993 where it operated both as a junior high school and middle school over the last 29 years. With the addition of the new 1500 student facility in the community that will eventually serve students 6th through 12th grade, we have the opportunity to build a true feeder system that will educate students pre-school through high school graduation. As Wellington continues to build out this feeder, Eyestone will expand across the street to take over the Wellington Middle School building in the coming years.\n\nWellington Middle-High School\n\nOnce again, the Town of Wellington will have learning opportunities within its boundaries for high school students. In the fall of 2022, we will be welcoming back high school students for the innagural year of WMHS. For the 2022-2023 schoolyear, the school will serve students in grades sixth through tenth grade.\n\nThe ground on which the new Wellington Middle-High School sits, was most recently farmed by the Bridges family. As you will see, the library is named in memory of Kathryn Louise Bridges, the late wife of Curtis Bridges.\n\nOUR MASCOT\n\nThe school was proud of the Eagle mascot and the colors of maroon and white. The Eagles were very competitive athletically, even winning state championships in football in 1952 & 1953 and in basketball in 1953 and 1957.\n\nContinuing on with the Wellington Eagles at both the middle and high school level is an opportunity to honor and celebrate the schoolâ€™s roots. Not only do we get to build a new school culture that reflects the values of the district and the town of Wellington, we get to celebrate and embrace the origins of the Wellington school system.\n\nTIMELINE AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS\n\nMiddle School\n\nNational School to Watch, 2012 - 2018\n\nColorado School to Watch, 2012 - 2018\n\nColorado Governor's Distinguished Improvement Award\n\nColorado Department of Education's Highly Effective School Library Progam School, 2014 - 2017\n\nUnited States Department of Education National Green Ribbon School\n\nAVID National Demonstration School, 2013 - 2019\n\nAVID National School of Distinction, 2015 - 2016\n\nNational Yearbook Program of the Year, 2012 - 2019\n\nColorado Environment Leadership Bronze Medal\n\nState of Colorado Knowledge Bowl Champions\n\nHigh School"
