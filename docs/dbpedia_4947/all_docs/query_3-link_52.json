        "text": "My name is Allie, originally I am from California, I am a mother of a sweet little boy who is my everything and my dog Cooper. My interest in aesthetics has been a lifelong one. I love educating people about their skin, the best products to use, how to create a skin care routine. I also very much enjoy waxing and transforming people into their best version of themselves. When I’m not at The Pearl, I enjoy taking walks in nature with my son, and exploring the beautiful pacific northwest. I look forward to meeting you and working with you to achieve your skin care goals.\n\nCOS- 10181550\n\nI was born and raised in Eugene and currently live in South Eugene with my two boys and two dogs. I’ve loved the spa/salon environment since I was in the 8th grade. I knew this was the path for me, but it took me a while to get here. Being able to make a person feel good in the skin they’re in, whether through facials or waxing, makes me happy, and I feel fortunate to have a job that allows me to do so. I look forward to meeting and working with you and helping you feel your best!\n\nCOS - 10215161\n\nI was born and raised in the Eugene/Springfield area. I currently live in West Eugene with my beautiful teenage daughter. I've been doing nails and esthetics for a year and a half now. I previously spent 17 years in banking so this is still a fairly new career for me but it's become one that I love more and more every day. I feel lucky to have a job that helps people feel happier, healthier and like a better version of themselves when they walk out the door.\n\nCOS - 10198130\n\nMy name is Maya I was born in Guatemala and I was raised on the coast of Oregon. I come from a very small town and am fairly new to the Eugene area. I graduated from beauty school in April of 2021 and have been loving it since then. I’m so happy to be providing services to a wide variety of clients. I enjoy meeting new people and giving them a memorable experience here at the spa.\n\nCOS - 10215503\n\nMy journey in bodywork originated from my mother's struggles with chronic pain and my goal of healing scoliosis in my own body. I believe bodywork isn't a luxury, but a necessity for the fast-paced life and demands of a modern world.\n\nI have practiced some form of bodywork since 2005 and have studied in both Oregon & Utah, attaining the title of master bodyworker in Utah. After completing massage school, I studied with Marcia York under the supervision of Hawaiian Healing Academy to learn a traditional Hawaiian bodywork called Lomi Lomi and it continues to form the base of my practice. I specialize in injury work, trigger point therapy, deep tissue massage, headaches, neck pain, back pain, and traditional Hawaiian Lomi Lomi bodywork.\n\nI have worked in many settings from resorts and spas, to clinics and private practice and aim to bring this diverse set of skills to the table for my clients every day that not not only heals the body but restores the mind.\n\nLMT #19099\n\nI've been licensed for eleven years. In my practice I specialize in myofascial release, sports injury, pregnancy, deep tissue, trigger point release, and cupping therapy. I value taking my time to listen to clients so I can more effectively treat their needs and leave them relaxed. I enjoy providing supportive and helpful feedback that clients can take home as part of their continued self care regime.\n\nI've lived in SE Eugene since 1999. I’m a mother to a precocious and active son who brings me lots of joy! I am blessed to have a beautiful community of dear friends and colleagues with which I share this beautiful life.\n\nLMT #12464\n\nI am an experienced massage therapist. I have been licensed since 2013 but have always been drawn to massage, and very intuitive with it. I'll find all your sore spots. I have a heavy hand. I specialize in deep tissue and also like to work on alot of trigger points for a 'hurts so good' massage that will leave you feeling like a new person.\n\nLMT #19343\n\nHaving always been fascinated with holistic health, I finally delved into the realm and received my massage therapy license in 2012 from the Colorado School of Healing Arts. While living in Denver, I had my own business and worked as a sole practitioner for 7 years until moving to Eugene in August 2021. During that time, I met so many people and worked on all different types of bodies. Deep tissue, Swedish, Sports, & Prenatal are just some of the modalities that I specialize in, but I love exploring other styles and trying to find ways to incorporate them into my flow. If you’re looking for a unique massage tailored to fit your needs, then I’d love to meet you!\n\nLMT #26260\n\nMy name is Logan. I am initially from The Bay Area in California, but fortunately found myself in beautiful Oregon. Currently I live in Springfield, Oregon. Ever since I can remember I have been passionate about the human body and its peak performance. I used to be a personal trainer in California and have always enjoyed helping others build and recover. Realizing the importance of recovery as time goes on I wanted to take it a step further and become a bodyworker. Therefore I took the step in the right direction by attending The National Holistic Institute in Santa Rosa, CA. I specialize in deep tissue and have a heavy hand. Whether you're just looking for a tune up or a whole body rebuild, you can count on me to be a part of the process.\n\nLMT #26095\n\nHello! My name is Stormie, and massage is one of my biggest loves in life! What I receive from each massage session is an opportunity to listen to both your body and your words. I hear what you need and what you want, then I get to tailor my techniques during your massage to balance the two. My goal for you is that you come out of your massage with your body heard, and your needs met. While massage is one of my biggest passions in life, I also have a deep love for lyric composition and wordplay! My favorite pastimes are writing music, playing video games, and making puns. Thank you for meeting me!\n\nLMT #25084\n\nMy recent entry into massage therapy has proven to be my calling. My passion for integrating the mind and body truly awakened during my time in massage therapy school here in Eugene in 2022. Anatomy, kinesiology and nervous system regulation are areas I thrive in studying. I enjoy working with those who are feeling the exhaustion from the demands of life and need to take time for themselves, those who are recovering from injury, those who are dealing with trauma, grief, a life transition or those who are simply looking to relax and reset. Recognizing the power of healing therapeutic touch has been life changing and I feel honored to share that with others. I see the value of massage therapy as part of regular self care. By regulating our own nervous system and filling our own cup I believe we can be better prepared for the demands life has to offer. My focus is Swedish Massage at this time though I am committed to continuing my education in other modalities. I look forward to working with you to design a session specific to your needs.\n\nLMT #27373\n\nHello! I became licensed here in Oregon in 2022 and so far I am deeply committed to this healing and rejuvenating work. I have found that my techniques lean toward Swedish and deep tissue, mostly because of what I've learned thus far. I am continuing to learn about other modalities and techniques that I intend to incorporate into my work as I grow. I am also deeply inspired by subtle energy and intend to deepen my experience with it so I may utilize it in my practice. Although I am new to this work, I have a rich history in working with people and providing a safe, healing space for those under my care. I am very grateful to be part of such a wonderful team of people offering relaxation and healing to this community.\n\nLMT #27371\n\nHello! My name is Amber and I am happy to be a part of The Pearl's caring and committed team. I have been fascinated with human physiology and the subtle bodies for 10+ years, and have recently received my license here in Oregon. My style of work is a hybrid of deep tissue and slow, methodical holds in areas of the body that need attention. I also practice sports massage and range-of-motion therapy when your body can benefit from it. My approach is gentle, though my pressure can be firm. I enjoy creating a different session for every client's needs and desire. I look forward to working with you!\n\nLMT #27863\n\nI’m Alaska grown, and have been in Eugene for long enough to call it home. As a licensed nail technician in the spa setting, I value nail care and health first and foremost. I also have a degree in Studio Art and I’m passionate about art and fashion and making nails a form of self expression! I love meeting new people and being a part of our beautiful community.\n\nCOS - NT -10231014\n\nIn the chaos of modern life, we all crave escape. Whether that escape is exercise, vacation, time in the garden, or time on a massage table, I encourage people to find time for rest, repair, and healing in their life. With many years of experience in team management, spa administration, and private practice building, I bring a diverse set of skills that equip me to serve not only clients, but also my staff and the personal life I love. As a self-admitted weekend warrior, I strongly encourage us to find our most productive selves as evolving from a place where we take time to focus on our desires, our health, and our quietness of mind."
