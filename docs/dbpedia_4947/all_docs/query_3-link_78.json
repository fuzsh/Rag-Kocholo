        "text": "Steve Virgen\n\nOrange Coast College sophomore pitcher Matt Clanton, chosen 38th\n\noverall by the Chicago Cubs, tops five local baseball standouts selected\n\nin the first 11 rounds of Tuesday’s Major League first-year player draft.\n\nClanton was picked in the compensation phase of the first round, after\n\ncompiling a 6-3 record and a 2.90 ERA for the Pirates.\n\nThe waiting game also ended for OCC freshman shortstop Donnie Murphy\n\nand sophomore pitcher Justin Azze, along with Vanguard senior first\n\nbaseman Chad Chop, UC Irvine junior pitcher Sean Tracey, and UCI junior\n\ncatcher Chris Miller.\n\n“There’s no one in the world I love more than the Cubs,” Clanton said.\n\n“They took me where I think I should belong. This is the greatest feeling\n\nin my life.”\n\nThe Cubs selected three pitchers before Clanton (Nos. 21, 32, 36), and\n\neight pitchers after him in the 20 rounds on the first day.\n\nClanton, kicked off the Pirates’ team after he said he refused to\n\npitch with an arm injury May 12 in the Southern California Regional\n\nplayoffs, was “ecstatic” to hear his name called during an Internet\n\nbroadcast of the draft.\n\n“I totally thought I was going to get low-balled by every Major League\n\nBaseball team because everyone has this thought that I’m not coachable,”\n\nsaid Clanton, a first-team All-Orange Empire Conference selection who\n\nrecorded 108 strikeouts and allowed 48 hits and 35 walks in 83 1/3\n\ninnings. “My hard work paid off in the long run. I worked really hard to\n\nget where I am. People don’t understand me. I didn’t feel like I should\n\nhave been throwing (May 12). My arm was hurting. I tried to go some\n\ninnings, but I couldn’t throw. I made a decision for myself. I thought it\n\nwas going to affect me in the draft, after coming up with a lame arm at\n\nthe end of the season, and having a scuffle with the coaches.”\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 210-pound Clanton says he has tendinitis in his elbow,\n\nwhich he is confident he will overcome with rehabilitation.\n\n“My right arm was killing me (May 12),” Clanton said. “I couldn’t\n\nthrow the ball. I got pressured into playing. I did what I could do, and\n\nafter the third inning I couldn’t do any more.”\n\nClanton said he and Coach John Altobelli exchanged heated words and\n\nthat Altobelli sent him an apology letter recently. Altobelli, in Hawaii\n\non vacation, could not be reached for comment.\n\nMurphy, who helped lead the Pirates to a 32-14 record and the Super\n\nRegional this season, was selected in the fifth round by the Kansas City\n\nRoyals, 138th overall.\n\nMurphy, a first-team All-OEC selection and OCC’s Male Athlete of the\n\nYear, amassed 82 hits to break the school single-season record of 75. He\n\nalso posted a .425 batting average, including 13 home runs and 46 RBIs.\n\nMurphy committed just four errors in 23 conference games.\n\nThe Montreal Expos selected Chop, the Golden State Athletic Conference\n\nPlayer of the Year, in the sixth round, 167th overall. The 6-3,\n\n210-pounder led the Lions to their first NAIA Region II championship,\n\nhitting .395 with a team-leading 15 home runs.\n\n“I was just relieved,” Chop said. “I wanted to go in the top 10\n\nrounds. I know I have the talent. I’m just really happy. I’m excited. I\n\nknow there are questions with the organization. I don’t care. I’m excited\n\nto play.”\n\nTracey, right-hander, was taken in the eighth round, 240th overall, by\n\nthe Chicago White Sox. Tracey started 17 games this season, leading the\n\nteam in strikeouts (96) and innings pitched(106 2/3). He was 8-7 with a\n\n4.44 ERA, averaging 8.1 strikeouts a game.\n\n“I’ve been dreaming of playing in the big leagues,” said Tracey, who\n\nhelped the Anteaters tie Cal State Fullerton for fourth in the Big West.\n\n“With the team like the White Sox, you couldn’t ask for a better\n\nsituation.”\n\nTracey and the other local draftees, will attempt to negotiate\n\ncontracts with their respective teams the next few days.\n\nTracey and Miller could play for the Anteaters next season.\n\nAzze, a second-team All-OEC pitcher, will most likely sign with the\n\nExpos, who selected him in the 10th round, 287th overall. Azze, a close\n\nfriend of Clanton, said he expected to be picked between the fifth and\n\n10th rounds.\n\n“It was a little stressful, but it was exciting at the end,” said\n\nAzze, who played with Clanton at Fountain Valley High. “It’s so exciting,\n\nbeing able to play on the professional level.”\n\nMiller was selected by the Cubs in the 11th round, 333rd overall. The\n\nsecond-team All-Big West Conference performer hit a school\n\nsingle-season-record 12 home runs.\n\n“I was listening on the Internet,” said Miller, who followed the draft\n\nwith Tracey and several other teammates. “I was pretty excited. It’s a\n\ngreat option for me to have. I really want to start my professional\n\ncareer. I definitely want to get out there. We’ll see what happens in the\n\nnext couple of weeks.”"
