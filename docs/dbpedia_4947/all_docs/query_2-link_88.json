        "text": "Eagle standard\n\nThis French eagle standard was captured during the battle. It was one of nearly 100 presented by Napoleon to his army in 1815 to replace those which had been destroyed during his exile.\n\nDuring the British heavy cavalry charge, Captain Alexander Kennedy Clark killed the French soldier carrying the standard, and Corporal Francis Stiles retrieved it. Although the pair disputed each other’s roles in its capture, both were later credited.\n\nYou can see the standard on display in our Conflict in Europe gallery."
