        "text": "LAKELAND -- Early in the third quarter of the Florida Christian Association of Private and Parochial Schools (FCAPPS) eight-man state football championship game, Kissimmee’s City of Life Christian Academy had all the momentum.\n\nThe Warriors had scored just before halftime, closing the gap to six points against Ave Marie’s Donahue Academy. City of Life marched all the way to the Donahue 1-yard line, when Sean Doman took matters into his own hands.\n\nLiterally.\n\nDoman recovered a fumble at the 2, preventing a game-tying and possible go-ahead score. On the ensuing drive, he was Johnny on the spot offensively, recovering a J.P. Klucik fumble and preventing the Warriors from getting the ball back inside the 10. The Shamrocks eventually scored on the drive, and Doman put an exclamation mark on a brilliant third quarter with a 10-yard fumble return after Thomas Donohue knocked the ball loose, sparking Donahue Academy to a 40-13 win and first-ever state championship.\n\nDonahue lost the seven-man state title game 56-33 to Gainesville’s Cornerstone Academy in 2013, and fell 66-20 to Clearwater International Academy in last year’s eight-man championship contest.\n\n\"My teammates did all the work, breaking through the line,\" Doman said of his crucial recovery at the 2. \"I just happened to be the one at the bottom of the pile with the ball.\"\n\nDoman has come up with big play after big play all year for Donahue, returning four fumbles for touchdowns.\n\n\"He's got more touchdowns than some of our receivers, and he's a defensive end,\" Shamrocks coach Rich Scanlon said. \"It's a game-changer. When we score and can come back and get a quick score on defensive touchdown, it really puts a team down in the dumps.\"\n\nAll year, the Shamrocks believed this was their time. With seniors like Doman, quarterback Elias Allan, tight end Andrew Scanlan and linebacker JP Klucik going through the heartache of championship losses as freshmen and juniors, they were determined to end their high school careers on a positive note.\n\nThis year, the Shamrocks (11-0) entered the title game as the clear favorites, with Clearwater International Academy moving up to 11-man ball in the FHSAA. Donahue came into the state title game outscoring its opponents 494-144 in 10 games, an average win of 49-14.\n\nBut this one wasn’t easy, at least not early.\n\nThe game got off to a slow start, with the two quarterbacks seeming a bit jittery. Allan and City of Life’s Bobby Edwards combined to misfire on their first nine passes.\n\nAllan was 0 for 6 when he finally completed a pass, and it was a big one to his favorite target. Allan found junior wide receiver Mark Cheffers open over the middle for a 41-yard score on a screen, giving the Shamrocks a 7-0 lead late in the first. Scanlan made a huge block to break Cheffers loose.\n\n\"Andrew came up to me and said 'that was the best block I've ever had in my life' and that was why I was able to score,\" Cheffers said. \"It just opened up and then our offense started moving. (City of Life) got more tired as the game went on. We went into the half with the lead, and we just kept it the rest of the way.\"\n\nAllan and Cheffers hooked up again early in the second, with Allan throwing a beautiful deep ball and Cheffers sprawling out for a 25-yard touchdown catch and a 13-0 lead. Due to his big game on offense and his blanket coverage as a defensive back, Cheffers was named the game's MVP.\n\n\"I can't put this into words,\" Cheffers said. \"I've been playing with these (seniors) for three years. I don't know if there's a group I love more. To work for this goal for three and a half years and finally achieving it on their last chance, it's an indescribable feeling.\"\n\nScanlon said the two early plays came on suggestions by Cheffers himself.\n\n\"Mark's a returning all-state wide receiver and he's been instrumental to our offense all year,\" Scanlon said. \"He actually came and told me on the sideline 'I think I can get a big gain on a screen play' and sure enough, he did it. The second touchdown, he came up and said 'I think I can get a big play on a fake screen and a go' and so I called it, and he scored again. I said 'maybe I should give you the playbook and I'll just stand off to the side with the fans.'\n\nHe knows how to use his body in space better than any athlete I've ever coached. And so, even though he may not be the fastest guy out there, he's able to block out players to catch footballs. And you saw on defense, he's got great closing speed. Several plays, it looked like their receivers were open but he closed quickly and knocked the ball away. And that's why he got the MVP, he was excellent on both sides of the ball tonight.\"\n\nCity of Life (8-2) responded on its very first play from scrimmage after Cheffers' second touchdown, with tight end Zamar Velez finding himself all alone in the left flat. Edwards spotted him and hit him in stride for a 45-yard touchdown pass, getting the Warriors on the board at 13-6.\n\nRandy Beidelschies took the kickoff 65 yards for a score and 19-6 Shamrocks advantage, capping off a wild stretch of three touchdowns in 31 seconds of game time.\n\nThe game remained that way until late in the half, when Jonathan Ledezma picked off an Allan pass at the Shamrocks 19. Four plays later, Edwards fired a five-yard touchdown strike to Tate Krisle, closing the Donahue edge to 19-13.\n\nThe Shamrocks felt they had a score right before the half, when Beidelschies fumbled and the ball appeared to be recovered in the end zone by Scanlan. However, the referees had blown the play dead at the City of Life 8, and Allan’s final pass fell incomplete to keep it a six-point game at the half.\n\nCity of Life got the ball to start the second half and had a first-and-goal at the two, but couldn't punch it in. Doman's recovery came on a third-down play, after the Shamrocks had already stuffed the Warriors twice.\n\n\"When you have a first-and-goal at the 1 and you fumble it, that's got to be pretty bad,\" Allan said. \"But then you give up a 78-yard touchdown drive, that was pretty much it for them. They were done.\"\n\nAllan finished 10 of 23 for 234 yards, throwing three touchdown passes and two interceptions. He also rushed for 79 yards and a score.\n\n\"The past two state championship games, I completely bawled my eyes out every time we lost,\" Allan said. \"Tonight, I didn't have a single tear to shed. There was nothing left to cry about. We were totally ready for it, ready to win. We were sick of losing, and this was our time.\"\n\nCheffers hauled in four passes for 83 yards and two touchdowns, while tight end Scanlan had a huge game with 118 yards on just three receptions. JP Klucik hauled in an eight-yard touchdown pass on his lone reception of the night.\n\nDONAHUE ACADEMY 40,\n\nKISSIMMEE-CITY OF LIFE 13\n\nCL 0 13 0 0 - 13\n\nDA 7 12 15 6 - 40\n\nFirst quarter\n\nDA – Mark Cheffers 41 pass from Elias Allan (Randy Beidelschies run ), 1:07\n\nSecond quarter\n\nDA - Cheffers 25 pass from Allan (kick failed), 9:55\n\nCL - Zamar Velez 45 pass from Bobby Edwards (run failed), 9:40\n\nDA - Randy Beidelschies 65 kickoff return (pass failed), 9:24\n\nCL - Tate Krisle 5 pass from Edwards (Velez pass from Edwards), :59\n\nThird quarter\n\nDA - JP Klucik 8 pass from Allan (Andrew Monterosso kick), 3:13\n\nDA - Sean Doman 10 fumble return (Andrew Scanlan pass from Beidelschies), 2:50\n\nFourth quarter"
