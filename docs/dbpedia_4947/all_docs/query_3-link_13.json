        "text": "The power of being different. This photo spread and story came out in the Atlantic and brought a smile to my face, as it truly sums up our organization and the Banana Ball World Tour. When we first came to Savannah it was so difficult to share with people our vision for the Savannah Bananas and how we believed we could bring more fun to baseball. In the beginning, very few people could see or believe in what we were trying to do with the game and the fan experience. And I don't blame them. They hadn't seen it and they hadn't felt it. We just kept talking about it, but we realized that talking was just noise. We had to show it to the fans. Finally on Opening Night the experience came to life. And since then, we've built our entire organization on creating these \"You Wouldn't Believe\" moments every night at the ballpark. We believed by showing people who we are and what we stand for, we could create fans. Now, we believe so much in the power of being different, that all of our weekly ideas sessions are based on what can we do each game that we've never done before on a baseball field. If we could create these unique moments of fun, we believe fans would keep wanting to come back and see what we would do next. Seeing photos of the Banana Nanas, Man-Nanas, Stilts pitching, stunt coaches, six foot bats, coaches roasting s'mores, player weigh-ins, Banana Babies, player dances, catcher's catching on bean bags and entire teams coaching third base, captures some of those unique characters and moments that make up Banana Ball. It's been a long journey to get here and we know there will be more of these ideas that don't work along the way, but for the fans, seeing something different drives our creativity. I believe every company can strive to bring something different for their customers. And the key is to not just talk about it, but show it and let your customers see it and feel it. That's why today we spend $0 on traditional marketing and invest all of our time and energy into ideas and creating unique experiences. How can make your customer experience different and photo worthy? When you are able to do that, you have the opportunity to create fans that do all the marketing for you. https://lnkd.in/ecxSdAQA"
