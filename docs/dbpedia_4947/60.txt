Wellington Phoenix coach Ricki Herbert has called in two New Zealand Football Championship players to bolster his squad for Wednesday’s Hyundai A-League game against Sydney FC.

Forward Sean Lovemore and midfielder Aaron Clapham will fly to Australia on Tuesday morning to link up with the Phoenix squad which was left depleted after captain Andrew Durante was suspended for two games following his eighth yellow card of the season.

Vince Lia, meanwhile, was ruled out with a hamstring injury suffered in the win over Adelaide United.

Clapham, who plays for Canterbury United, was part of Herbert’s 23-man New Zealand squad at the World Cup last June, while Lovemore, of Waitakere United, has played in the Phoenix development side.

“Aaron has always showed a passion to play professional football and this provides him with another chance to sample what that is like,” said Herbert, whose side have all but sealed their spot in the top six thanks to the 1-0 win over Adelaide.

“Since the World Cup Aaron has continued to play for Canterbury United and his inclusion shows that the Phoenix has a strong visibility across the country’s domestic competition.”

“In Sean’s case it is a great opportunity for a young boy to get some more experience in a professional environment.”

Wellington round off the regular season at home to North Queensland Fury on Sunday.
