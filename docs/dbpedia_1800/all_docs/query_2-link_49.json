        "text": "NOBARTV.CO.ID PSSI also reported the VAR referee, PSSI not only reported the main referee Nasrullo Kabirnov regarding indications of cheating in the Indonesia vs Qatar match. The Indonesian football federation also reported the VAR referee from Thailand who he thought made many mistakes.\n\nLast Monday night was one of the most stressful nights for the young Garuda squad. Because how could it not be, in their first match in the 23 U-2024 Asian Cup, they were immediately slaughtered by hosts Qatar U-23 with a final score of 2-0.\n\nWhat was even more disappointing was that the match did not go as expected. In fact, the match could be called unfair for several reasons. The figure who made the match unfair was the referee Nasrullo Kabirnov. In that match, Nasrullo made many decisions that were detrimental to the Indonesian national team.\n\nFirst, Nasrullo gave Ivar Jenner a red card early in the second half. In the replay, Jenner clearly did not foul the opposing player.\n\nSecond, the red card that Nasrullo had issued to a Qatari player after a serious foul on Witan Sulaeman suddenly turned yellow. In fact, at that time Nasrullo already held the yellow card.\n\nThird, the referee didn't care or gave Indonesia a foul after Marselino Ferdinan was pushed to the ground in front of him.\n\nThese various controversial decisions have not been supplemented by other decisions. Therefore, PSSI officially submitted a protest to AFC as the organizer of the 23 U-2024 Asian Cup.\n\nHowever, it turns out that PSSI not only reported Nasrullo - as the party who made the Indonesian National Team lose money, but he also reported the VAR referee from Thailand. This was conveyed by PSSI Exco Endri Erawan.\n\n\"Of course we are all disappointed with the leadership of referee Nasrullo Kabirov and the VAR referee, Sivakorn Pu-Udom, who can all see that they made many decisions that were detrimental to the U-23 Indonesian National Team,\" said Endri Erawan.\n\n\"After the match, on behalf of the team, we officially protested to the AFC regarding their decisions,\" added Endri.\n\nâ€œWe know this protest will not change the outcome of the match. But at least for the next matches in the prestigious U-23 Asian Cup.\"\n\n\"The referees and match officials can be better at making decisions that do not harm the U-23 Indonesian National Team,\" he concluded."
