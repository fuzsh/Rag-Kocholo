        "text": "DOHA: Syria effectively reached the Asian Cup last 16 for the first time in their history on Tuesday with a 1-0 win over India, sending their opponents home.\n\nHector Cuper’s side finished Group B with four points and are set to go through to the knockouts as one of the best four third-placed teams.\n\nOmar Khribin was Syria’s hero, his 76th-minute goal the winner.\n\nIgor Stimac’s India head home with three defeats and no goals.\n\nSyria did most of the attacking in the opening exchanges in Doha but were restricted to speculative shots, as they sought their first goal and win at this Asian Cup.\n\nThey were lucky not to be reduced to 10 men after 25 minutes, when Mahmood Al-Aswad violently chest-barged Mahesh Singh Naorem to the ground, having been dragged back in possession.\n\nReferee Sivakorn Pu-udom booked both players, in a generally lenient performance.\n\nMoments later, the Thai official declined fierce penalty appeals from the Syrians for a trip in the box on Ammar Ramadan.\n\nBy half-time, with Uzbekistan trailing Australia 1-0 in the other match, a win would have seen Syria tie the Uzbeks on four points.\n\nBut they trailed their rivals on goal difference, and would need to score a few to take second place and an automatic place in the knockouts.\n\nMinutes after the break, India’s defense was weakened as center-back Sandesh Jhingan limped off with an injury, replaced by the less experienced Nikhil Poojary.\n\nSyria continued to hog possession, but could not conjure a real chance.\n\nIndia, who were also yet to register a goal in Qatar, could not connect with striker Sunil Chhetri, despite the 39-year-old’s spirited running.\n\nWith 20 minutes left and many goals required, Syria coach Cuper sent on forward Alaa Al-Dali, replacing Ramadan.\n\nAs Indian legs tired, Syria finally mustered a moment of slick football 14 minutes from time, Ibrahim Hesar delivering a cutback from the left for Khribin to drill into the net."
