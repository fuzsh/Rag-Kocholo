        "text": "jpnn.com – JAKARTA – The 2024 U-23 Asian Cup semi-final match between Indonesia vs Uzbekistan at the Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium, Doha, Qatar, Monday (29/4) evening, ended with Garuda Muda losing.\n\nUzbekistan’s two winning goals were created by Khuisain Norchaev in the 68th minute and Pratama Arhan’s own goal in the 86th minute.\n\nThis match was also marked by Rizky Ridho’s red card in the 83rd minute after a Video Assistant Review (VAR) review led by Sivakorn Pu-Udom.\n\nAfter a VAR review, Chinese referee Shen Yinhao annulled Indonesia’s goal which was scored by Muhammad Ferrari’s feet.\n\nFootball observer Akmal Marhali believes that the AFC referee has again harmed the Indonesian U-23 national team.\n\nDuring the Indonesia vs Uzbekistan match, the Thai VAR referee Sivakorn Pu Udom did two things that were detrimental to the Garuda Muda squad.\n\nFirst, when there was a potential penalty for a foul on Witan Sulaeman, which actually resulted in the free kick being cancelled.\n\nSecond, when Muhammad Ferrari’s goal was not approved by referee Shen Yinhao, because the VAR display showed that Ferrari was in a slightly offside position from a certain angle."
