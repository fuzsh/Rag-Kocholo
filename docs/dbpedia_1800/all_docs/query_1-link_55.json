Don't ask me how I feel (about retirement). Because I don't want to address it. We really need to win tomorrow. Once we win this game, it gives us a great chance to go to the third round, which we have never been to. One thing we know for sure is that this is not going to be easy. And one thing we are very happy about is that we're playing in Kolkata. We'll have tremendous support.\"\n\n\"I'll be there wearing a nice suit, coming to watch all our boys play. That's the dream. We win tomorrow, hopefully, and we'll be almost qualified. It's not 100% guaranteed. There are some permutations and combinations, but we'll qualify. There will be 10 top games against the best in Asia, home and away. We'll go and watch the games.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, everything goes according to plan and I can go and watch them (in the third round). Just imagine playing against Japan and Australia in the third round. Just imagine what the whole euphoria will be and that is why the win is important. That's why we want everyone together.\"\n\n\"I think it's the right time. This is the right setup. It's one of the biggest games that I, who has played for 19 years, is going to play. We win, we go to the third round where we've never been before. There couldn't be a better game for me to call it my last. I'm at peace from the inside. I've given whatever I had.\"\n\n05.06.2024: India is all set to face the challenge of Kuwait in an important 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers (second round) and to ensure a qualification into the third round of the qualifiers of the AFC region and the 2027 AFC Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia on 6th of June at the iconic Vivekananda Yubabharati Kriangan at Kolkata.\n\nIGOR STIMAC IN PRE MATCH PRESS CONFERENCE\n\n\"We had three tight, tough games against Kuwait. Either team could've won them. I would say our best game was away in Kuwait in these qualifiers because that was perfect defensive shape, not allowing them to get near our box and create clear chances. That's what we need to repeat tomorrow, with our discipline, focus, tight marking, reaching the opposition goal and scoring the goal because that's what we need.\"\n\n\"Knowing that this is the last game of our captain for the national team makes this occasion much, much bigger. But of course, this is still about India winning against Kuwait. We are focussed on what we need to do. I will put it in a few words - we are ready for it.\"\n\nRUI BENTO IN PRE MATCH PRESS CONFERENCE\n\n\"We expect a good game tomorrow. We know that both teams have competitive targets and the same goal. We've had a good environment in our training. We believe that more than the one week of camp in Thailand, it's about the one and a half year of us being together as a team.\"\n\n\"Yes, we played three games against India last year. They were all very balanced and the teams were at a similar level. But all those matches are history. Football is always an ongoing process, and we are proud and confident of ourselves. We are more prepared now to face India and expect ourselves to be better than before and win the game.\"\n\nHEAD TO HEAD\n\nTOTAL MATCHES: 6\n\nINDIA WON: 3\n\nKUWAIT WON: 2\n\nTIED MATCHES: 1\n\nINDIA SCORED: 8 GOALS\n\nKUWAIT SCORED: 19 GOALS\n\nLAST MATCH SCORE\n\n16.11.2023 : FIFA WORLD CUP QLF - INDIA 1-0 KUWAIR\n\nSCORER: MANVIR SINGH\n\nHIGHEST MARGIN WIN\n\n14.10.2010: INTERNATIONAL FRIENDLY - INDIA 1-9 KUWAIT\n\nIGOR STIMAC REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MATCH\n\n\"Reaching Round 3 will be another step in Indian football history,â said Stimac. âIt will be an amazing thing to have the opportunity to play another 10 games against the best Asian teams and dream big about trying to reach the biggest stage of football.\"\n\n'\n\nReaching Round 3 would be a double delight. A place in the third round would also ensure Indiaâs direct qualification for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 in Saudi Arabia, a fact that makes the June 6 tie a momentous occasion.The top two teams from each group from the second round will head into the third round, where 18 nations will be split into three groups of six and play each other on a home-and-away basis.\n\n\" First, winning the game is crucial. And to reach that target, we need to be very clever. If we donât open the scoring in the first half an hour, we need to be intelligent and play quality football together with pace. All these aspects are very important and we have to prepare for them. We have to prepare everything, not only the starting eleven players, but also the five on the bench, who could enter the pitch as substitutes.\"\n\nWE WANT TO WIN FOR SUNILBHAI: SUBHASISH\n\n03.06.24: India will face against Kuwait in an important qualifying match on Thursday evening at a full house iconic Yubhabharati Kriangan in Kolkata.\n\nSubhasish Bose, an important member of India spoke with the media before the trainning session.\n\nWhile interacting Subhasish said, \"The match against Kuwait is hugely important for us. It is a golden opportunity to create history in Indian football. After all, India could never reach Round 3 of the World Cup qualifiers. A victory in this match would also ensure our place in the 2027 Asian Cup final rounds.\"\n\nWhile answering a question regarding Sunil Chetri, the Indian defender said, \"The motivation level among the players is higher than usual; they all know this will be Sunil bhaiâs farewell match and there is an urge among all of us to make it memorable. We all want to win this match, a farewell gift for Sunil bhai. Sunil Bhai is a role model and an inspiration for many youngsters, who joined the national team much later. Itâs a special match, indeed. But it's also an India match; we are all playing for India and will do everything for an Indian victory. We want to win this match to make 140 crore people in this country happy. \"\n\nSUNIL CHETRI IS COUNTING HIS DAYS IN INDIA TEAM\n\n01.06.24 Indian captain Sunil Chetri will play his last international match at Kolkata against Kuwait on 6th of June. After reaching to the City of Joy from Bhubaneswar he wrote in his social media, âThese last few days, Iâve been caught in a bit of a dilemma. Now that thereâs a number to my days with the National Team, whatâs the right route to take â do I count every day, every training session? Or do I simply turn up without the thought of how this is coming to an end ?â\n\nSunil Chetri is third highest goal scorer in international circuit by scoring 94 goals in 150 appearances.\n\nRELIANCE FOUNDATION DEVOLOPEMENT LEAGUE: 2023-24\n\nPUNJAB FC ARE THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS OF RDFL\n\n18.05.2024 : EAST BENGAL FC 2-3 PUNJAB FC (FT)\n\nSCORER:\n\nPFC: Omang Dodum (5'), Yendrembam Boby Singh (59'), Hamanpreet Singh (72')\n\nEBFC: Guite Vanlalpeka (43'), Joseph Justin (50')\n\nEBFC : Gourab Shaw, Adil Amal, Guite Vanlalpeka, Aman CK, Suman Dey, Debojit Roy, Joseph Justine, Md.
