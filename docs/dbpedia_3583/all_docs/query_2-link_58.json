Shopping can make you hungry. Great Lakes Crossing offers some of the best dining experiences including, Bar Louie, Mex, Johnny Rockets, and Rainforest CafÃ©. GLCO is also home Michiganâs largest food court.

HUB Stadium also features two state of art kitchens, one exhibition kitchen and a larger kitchen to accommodate banquets, two private rooms, a 50,000-watt sound system with 12 subwoofers and 32 speakers, two fully stocked bars, both with a âbottomâs upâ beer tap which fills the beer from the bottom of the cup preventing a foamy head on the beer, a DJ booth, Michiganâs largest TV at 240 inches and can hold up to 600 people.\n\nMeadow Brook Hall on the Campus of Oakland University\n\nThe 88,000 square foot manor was home to Matilda Dodge Wilson, widow of John Dodge, co-founder of Dodge Brothers Motor Car Company. This stunning 110-room home was built on a 320-acre farm and later became the cornerstone for Oakland University, which was built on the expanded 1,500-acre estate which was donated by the family in 1957.Â In 2012, it was named a National Historic Landmark making it the fourth largest historic house museum in the United States and opened to the public in 1971.Â It serves as a hosting space for Oakland University, weddings, events and is open for historic tours.Â The walls still echo from some the most amazing talent in the entertainment industry. Frank Sinatra serenaded Frances Dodge for her 25th Birthday, a scene from âTransformers: Dark of the Moonâ was filmed at the hall and with Miley Cyrusâs music video for âWho Owns My heartâ.Â Famed Detroit born rapper, Eminem married his wife Kim Scott at the highly sought at wedding venue.Â The Summer Concert Series provides and fun and relaxing evening while enjoying live music by local artists and light hors dâoeuvres.Â Take this opportunity to stroll the enchanting gardens or take a self-guided tour of the main level of the mansion. Their familiar community programs sell out quickly due to their success and popularity, including:Â Mother Daughter Tea, Wild Game Dinner & Murder Mystery Dinner.Â Come enjoy the spirit of the holiday season during the annual Holiday Walk, a self-guided tour of the holiday decorations throughout the manor, or stroll over to Dannyâs Cabin, a playhouse built for John and Matildaâs son Danny, to visit Santa!\n\nMeadow Brook Theatre on the Campus of Oakland University\n\nOver the past twenty years, Meadow Brook Theater has launched Michigan premieres for world renowned performances such as âThe Woman in Blackâ, âHaving Her Sayâ, âRabbit Holeâ, âThe 39 Stepsâ, âNext to Normalâ, and âDing Dongâ which is a sequel to the hit âBoeing Boeingâ which had its US premier at Meadow Brook in 2011, and off-Broadway sensation âAtomicâ. The theaterâs stage still resonates with thespian energy from well-known actors such as, William Hurt, Curtis Armstrong and Robert Englund.Â The holiday traditional story of Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge is bright to life every year for 34 years in âA Christmas Carolâ which is the theaterâs highest revenue production. Founded in 1966, the 584-seat theatre had its first staged production in January in 1967 when John Fernald, head of Londonâs Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, established a resident professional theater company on Oakland Universityâs campus.Â The theaterâs stage still resonates with thespian energy from well-known actors such as, William Hurt, Curtis Armstrong and Robert Englund. In 2003, the theater became Michiganâs largest non-profit professional theater and is a separate entity from Oakland University however, they are still located on the campus.Â Â Families are able to feel right at home with the theaterâs mission to âprovide a season of innovative, Broadway quality theater productions that make audiences smile, laugh and cryâ¦â."
