        "text": "New data from the U.S. Census Bureau show Michigan’s population is experiencing significant changes.\n\nMichigan posted its largest population ever, but growth is lagging behind much of the country. Hispanics and Asians are rapidly moving in, while fewer white people were counted. West Michigan is booming, and the Upper Peninsula is on the decline. Detroit continued a seven-decade slump, but suburbs surrounding it are growing.\n\nRelated: Where are Michigan’s fastest-growing counties? See population change 2010-2020\n\nThe release of detailed, once-in-a-decade population data has huge political and economic implications. The count is used to divvy up federal dollars and political districts.\n\nMichigan’s new independent redistricting commission will rely on the numbers to draw the maps for congressional and state legislative seats ahead of 2022 elections. Armed with the new data, the 13-member panel anticipates starting the map-drawing process next Thursday, beginning with state Senate districts.\n\nThe 2020 census recorded 10 million Michigan residents, a 2% increase in the last decade. Michigan added 193,691 residents overall.\n\nMeanwhile, some have questioned the accuracy of the census count. The COVID-19 pandemic proved a difficult obstacle for staffers who went door-to-door and field operations ended earlier than usual. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan vowed to challenge what he views as an undercount of his city’s population, while civil rights groups worry minority groups were also undercounted.\n\nPolitical junkies and data wonks will pour over the data in the coming weeks, but here are a few early revelations from the numbers.\n\n1. West Michigan is growing fast\n\nMichigan communities along the western lakeshore are enjoying a healthy increase in residents during the last decade.\n\nThe latest decennial count shows Ottawa, Grand Traverse and Kent counties were the three fastest-growing parts of Michigan in the last decade. Census data shows West Michigan communities are increasingly popular destinations for residents while the Upper Peninsula and most eastern counties in the Lower Peninsula lost residents since 2010.\n\nOttawa County is the seventh-largest county by population, but outpaced the rest of the state in growth, swelling by 12% in the last 10 years. The county added 32,399 residents, increasing to a total of 296,200 people.\n\nThe 2020 Census showed Grand Traverse County close behind. The county, best known as a northern recreation destination, grew by 10% since 2010. Grand Traverse County added 8,252 people for a total of 95,238 residents recorded in 2020.\n\nRelated: Ottawa, Grand Traverse and Kent counties fuel West Michigan population surge\n\nKent County, located directly east of Ottawa County and home to Grand Rapids, was the third-fastest growing county in Michigan. Census figures show Kent County grew by 9%, adding 55,352 residents.\n\nKent County also ranks third in the state for total population. The 2020 Census recorded 657,974 residents. The population of Grand Rapids grew by 6% to reach 198,917 residents in 2020.\n\nAllegan County, to the south of Kent and Ottawa, grew by 8%. Much of the western half of Michigan’s Lower Penninsula experienced steady growth in the last decade.\n\nSee how every Michigan county’s population changed from 2010-2020 in the map below (Can’t see the map? Click here.)\n\n2. Michigan became more diverse\n\nMichigan remains a majority-white state, but the census recorded significant changes in the state’s various ethnic groups. A booming population of Hispanic, Asian and biracial residents made up for losses in white residents.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Michigan’s population is white, 14% is Black and 6% is Hispanic or Latino. The rankings are the same as 10 years ago, but whites made up 77% of the population in 2010.\n\nMichigan’s white population dropped by 4% overall, a decline of 274,288 people from the 2010 count. Whites remain the majority in every county.\n\nThe state’s Black population dropped by 2%, with 25,298 fewer people counted. The Hispanic or Latino population climbed by 29%, an increase of 128,064 people.\n\nMichigan’s Asian population soared by 40%, growing by 95,798. The Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander population rose by 17%, according to census data.\n\nThe number of people identifying as two or more races was up 176% from 2010.\n\nWhite people declined in numbers for the first time on record in the overall U.S. population, according to the 2020 census data. Meanwhile, the Hispanic and Asian populations rocketed nationwide.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau also created a “diversity index” measuring the likelihood that any two random people will be of different races. It determined a 45% chance in Michigan, though the figure changes quite a bit across the state.\n\nIn Wayne County, there’s a 63% chance that any two people are from different races. Meanwhile, there’s only a 9% chance in the Upper Peninsula’s Keweenaw County.\n\nOther counties with diversity scores over 50% include Ingham, Chippewa, Washtenaw, Saginaw and Oakland. Only Wayne County was in that category a decade ago.\n\n3. Detroit is still shrinking, but not as quickly\n\nDetroit’s population decline has been evident in every census since the city’s peak in 1950, when 1.8 million people lived there.\n\nThe city was home to 639,111 residents in 2020, a 10.5% decrease since the last count was taken in 2010.\n\nRelated: Census shows Detroit keeps shrinking, but mayor disputes accuracy of 2020 count\n\nHowever, there was a silver lining in the latest census figures. The city experienced the smallest population decline since it first started showing population loss in the 1960 census. Detroit lost one-quarter of its residents between 2000 and 2010. That sharp rate of decline slowed down in the last decade.\n\nWhile census data shows Detroit lost 74,666 residents from 2010 to 2020, the city dropped nearly 237,500 people in the prior decade.\n\n3. Suburban areas surrounding Detroit continue growing\n\nSuburban counties around Detroit also recorded a healthy increase in residents. Washtenaw County, home to Ann Arbor, grew by 8%, while Oakland County grew by 6% and Macomb County grew by 5%.\n\nOakland County added the most residents overall, increasing by 72,033 residents. Kent County grew by 55,352 people, followed by Macomb County, which added 40,239 new residents.\n\nHamtramck, a small city surrounded by Detroit, grew by 27%, adding 6,010 residents in the last decade. Dearborn, immediately to the west of Detroit, grew by 12% with the addition of 11,823 people.\n\nCity-level data shows Metro Detroit suburbs of Bloomfield Hills, Auburn Hills, Novi, Wixom and Farmington each grew by at least 10%.\n\n4. The Upper Peninsula is shrinking\n\nAll but one county in the Upper Peninsula lost population in the last decade. Houghton County was the lone outlier; it added 733 people since the 2010 count and grew by 2%.\n\nThe bottom three counties for population loss were all in the Upper Peninsula: Luce (20%), Ontonagon (14%) and Gogebic (13%).\n\nThe Upper Peninsula lost 9,753 residents in the last decade, dropping by 3%. Gogebic County was the biggest loser in terms of population too; the county’s population dropped 2,047.\n\n5. Overall, Michigan is struggling to add new residents\n\nMichigan is home to more people than ever recorded, but the state’s rate of growth lags behind most of the country. The sluggish population growth during the last decade is costing the state a U.S. House seat.\n\nCommunities near the southern border with Ohio, Michigan’s thumb region, the northeast part of the Lower Peninsula and most of the Upper Peninsula lost residents in the last decade.\n\n6. Michigan’s population is aging\n\nOverall, the number of children in the U.S. is declining, and Michigan is aging even faster than other states.\n\nChildren under the age of 18 now make up 21.5% of the state’s population, down from 23.7% in 2010.\n\nNationwide, kids make up 22% of the overall population, down from 24% in 2010. Michigan ranks 15th in the nation for the number of adults over 18, clocking in at 78.5%.\n\nWithin the state, Ontonagon County had the highest percentage of adults — 88.5% of the county’s population is over 18. St. Joseph County had the lowest percentage of people over 18 at 75.5%.\n\nCounties with highest percentage of adults:\n\nOntonagon County: 88.5%\n\nAlcona County: 86.5%\n\nRoscommon County: 85.8%\n\nMontmorency County: 84.8%\n\nPresque Isle County: 84.6%\n\nCounties with lowest percentage of adults:\n\nSt. Joseph County: 75.5%\n\nBranch County: 75.8%\n\nAllegan County: 75.8%\n\nOttawa County: 76.3%\n\nKent County: 76.3%\n\nSee a database of how populations in Michigan municipalities changed over the last decade below.\n\n7. Metro regions posted most growth, but some cities shrunk\n\nMichigan’s population growth areas were generally clustered in the state’s largest metropolitan regions, while populations in more rural regions and some of the state’s cities saw declines.\n\nOf Michigan’s 1521 cities and townships on record, 809 saw losses, 711 saw gains, and one, Eagle Harbor Township in Keweenaw, had the same population count as 2010 (217).\n\nAs mentioned above, municipalities in West Michigan and Southeast Michigan grew the most. Ann Arbor officially surpassed Lansing as the state’s fifth-largest city, and Grand Rapids saw a 5.8% boost to its population.\n\nDetroit, Lansing, Kalamazoo and Saginaw were among the cities that saw populations shrink — but in cities of more than 50,000 people, Flint saw the most dramatic decline, losing more than 20% of its population over the last decade.\n\nNationally, while more than half of U.S. counties saw population losses over the last 10 years, metropolitan areas grew by an average 9%, and 81% of the country’s metropolitan areas saw population growth.\n\nSee how the population changed in Michigan’s metropolitan areas in the database below.
