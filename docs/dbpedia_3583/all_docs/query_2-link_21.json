        "text": "Had a ton of fun! We were here for a bachelor's party. Reese was our Axe throwing coach and was very engaged with us. He seemed like he really enjoyed his job and hanging out with us. Kacey and Ross were great servers. Very attentive, kind, and always smiling. The apps were delicious too! We had soooo many green tea shots. Great place to hang with close friends.\n\nThis is one of the first outings we have taken since March 2020. We were more than impressed with both the service and the cleanliness. Service staff were friendly, food was amazing, and axe throwing was seriously therapeutic after what might have been the worst year EVER. Thanks for a hilarious night of birthday shenanigans!!!\n\nI could go on and on about the dessert being soooo good. The cajun chx pasta was great. The only problem i had was our waitress was lost. It took 20 minutes to get drinks for my wife and i. I know everyone is short staffed cause of unemployment but it happened 3 times. Will go back again for sure.\n\nFood was Way beyond expectations. I had the pork street tacos and the chips and salsa trio. Everything was very very good. Way beyond your standard entertainment/barfood. Good selection of draft beers. I did not play any football bowling or ax throwing but it is all set up and looks very fun. Good place to have a team building event or family / friends gathering...\n\nThe Home of Axe Throwing and Football Bowling\n\nThe HUB Stadium features: 10 Interactive Axe Stalls, 10 Classic Axe Stalls, 8 Football Bowling Lanes, 3 Topgolf Swing Suite Simulators, Four Private Event Rooms, Two Full Bars equipped with Bottoms Up Draft Beer System, Craft Cocktails, and a Scratch Kitchen featuring New American Cuisine.\n\nBook your next event with us!\n\nWe are the perfect place for Corporate meetings and personal celebrations! Schedule our entertainment activities for Team Building or just for some friendly competition and fun. Let our Sales Team put together the perfect event for you, and choose from a variety of food and beverage packages. Less stress, more fun!\n\nTorque & Targets; Car Show & Axe Throwing Bash\n\nFriday August 16th\n\nJoin us at The HUB Stadium for our exhilarating “Torque & Targets” event!\n\nExperience the thrill of axe throwing and marvel at an impressive lineup of cars on August 16th and 17th from noon until 10 PM.
