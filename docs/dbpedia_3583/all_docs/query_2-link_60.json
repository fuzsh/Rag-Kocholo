        "text": "The site where the Palace of Auburn Hills arena once stood will be reinvented over the next 18 months, according to plans submitted to Auburn Hills’ community development office. Just over a mile away, another manufacturing facility is being planned at the former Silver Bell Ski Lodge site.\n\nThe city received drawings for building permit review of the former Palace site earlier this month, said Steve Cohen, Auburn Hills’ director of community development, adding that the city has been working closely with the developer.\n\nSchostak Development Inc.’s plan for the Palace site shows $70 million in site preparation and $130 million for building construction that will result in a long-term lease between Schostak and General Motors. GM would manufacture a variety of automotive parts that should be sent to GM’s Orion Assembly Plant, north of Brown Road at 4555 Giddings Road in Orion Township.\n\nThe Palace opened in 1988 and was the Detroit Pistons’ home and a sports and concert venue until Bob Seger’s final concert there in 2017. The arena was demolished and site cleared in 2020\n\nTara Kuhnen, GM’s director of corporate news relations and broadcast for real estate and human resources, said the company will “secure space for a supplier facility to support its Orion Assembly Plant, which will be expanded to produce electric pickup trucks. We will have more to share later in the year.”\n\nJeffrey Schostak, president of Schostak Development, said he would have more to say about the project in 30 to 60 days.\n\n“We are working collaboratively to help keep the development on track to meet critical benchmarks,” Cohen said.\n\nConstruction is scheduled to start in early May though weather and other factors could cause a date shift, Cohen said.\n\n“The site will be prepared for development with grading, major utility installation, and building foundations poured between May and August,” Cohen said. “Structural steel for the building is expected to be erected at the pad site just after Labor Day, with the building fully enclosed by March 2025.”\n\nCohen anticipates the facility to be fully operational by early November 2025, based on the current plan.\n\nMeanwhile, city officials are waiting on a development application for a nearby site. Warren-based Crown Enterprises purchased 79.24 acres at 4250 Interpark Drive, Cohen said.\n\nCrown Enterprises, which is owned by the Maroun family, specializes in building and leasing turnkey properties for big corporations. The family also owns businesses related to trucking, transportation, insurance, logistics, management and the Ambassador Bridge over the Detroit River, which connects Detroit and Windsor.\n\nThe Interpark Drive site was transformed from the Silver Bell Ski Lodge in the early 1960s into a landfill in the 1970s and an industrial park in the early 2000s. Cohen said it became a “zombie site” during the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2009.\n\n“City staff anticipate meeting with the company in the weeks ahead to learn more about their proposal for the land,” Cohen said."
