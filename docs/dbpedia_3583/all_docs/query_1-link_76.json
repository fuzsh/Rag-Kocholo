        "text": "Amazing Facts About Auburn Hills\n\nAuburn Hills is home to 40 international corporations from 32 countries. They also have 22 high-technology parks and four colleges/universities.\n\nGreat Lakes Crossing has over 175 store, restaurants, entertainment venues, and is home to Sea Life Michigan. The aquarium is the largest in Michigan!\n\nThis community got its name in 1983! Auburn Hills was originally called Auburn (after Auburn, New York). Through the years, the community was briefly called Amy before taking the name Auburn Heights in 1919. The name stuck until 1983 when Auburn Heights and Pontiac Township came together to form Auburn Hills.\n\nRiverside Park is located exactly where the community was officially founded: The corners of Auburn and Squirrel roads.\n\nWe sent City of The Week’s Joel Morgan out Auburn Hills. Strangely, Joel seems to have spent most of his time at Legoland. We are shocked. Joel is a huge Lego fan and an amazing builder. We spotlighted Joel and his love of Legos a couple of years ago for Lego day. Sending Joel to Legoland Discovery Center may not have been 100% work for Joel. I love that Joel turned it into an adventure with his wife, Kim, and friends! -Doni\n\nJoel’s Notes\n\nIt’s been a while since Auburn Hills was the WCSX City of the Week! On this trip back, I visited some of my favorite spots: Legoland Discovery Center and Downtown Auburn Hills!\n\nDowntown Auburn Hills is a recent development you might not even know about! Auburn Hills never really had a downtown area, so they made one from scratch in 2002! It’s a very beautiful and relaxing area that features Riverside Park, several tasty restaurants, and cool shops and stores.\n\nGreat Lakes Crossing Mall also features Legoland Discovery Center– one of my favorite locations in Michigan! It’s a great place to learn about the world of Lego- it has a gallery that features hundreds of Lego Creations or re-creations of recognizable metro Detroit landmarks. You can also learn Lego-building tips from Clint, The Master Builder! Legoland is a total blast, but they have some rules you want to know before you go.\n\nYes, I miss the Palace, but there is still a lot that is rockin’ in Auburn Hills—the 94.7 WCSX City of The Week!\n\nAuburn Hills Pictures"
