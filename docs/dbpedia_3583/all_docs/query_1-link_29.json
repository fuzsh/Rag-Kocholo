        "text": "Advertisements\n\nI’m moving to MI from Canada for grad school later this month. My school has campuses in both AA and AH. I want to find a safe and “nice” neighbourhood for the next 2 years of living. I never had been to either AA or AH. Please give me some advice. much appreciate...\n\n1. I heard AA is a college town and named the nicest city in MI. I’m curious how “quiet” this city is. Are there any bars or clubs open till late? I’m in late 20’s and am not a party-fan. However, I lived in a “retirement” town before and never wanted to look back…\n\n2. How about coffee shops? Does Ann Arbor have more coffee shops than Auburn Hills?\n\n3. How about community or fitness centres in AA /AH? If the weather is nice, which city people do more out-door activities?\n\n4. How about winter time in these two cities?\n\n5. If I never wanted to start a family in MI, which city would you recommend to my age-group people?\n\n6. Oh, last thing – dinning. (emm, I consider this is totally different question from “coffee shop”…) I eat out often. Which city offers more good restro.? (well, mid range $ )\n\nThanks a bunch!!!\n\nThese two cities are worlds apart, completely different. I'm sure you'll hear from people who live in both places - I don't but have spent plenty of time in each. Mostly I've driven through & around Auburn Hills and gone to the movies & big mall a few times. I've done a lot of walking around A2, lots of neat little funky restaurants.\n\nA2 is very much a liberal college town. Wide diversity of restaurants, clubs, music, events, independent stores. It has a fairly bustling downtown, lots of pedestrian activity, sidewalk seating at restaurants, coffee shops, lots of people walking, biking, skateboarding, etc. Tons and tons of stuff to do.\n\nAuburn Hills is suburban, big malls, box store, no real downtown, freeways running through it. Freeways congested during rush hour.\n\nA2 has many more parks and trails for biking and hiking and so on...I am not sure about fitness centers in either city but I imagine there's good ones in both cities.\n\nWeather comparable in both cities.\n\nI am guessing you can find cheaper home/rental prices in and around AH (it's pretty much unbroken sprawl in all directions, for miles and miles there, although there are some great parks and open spaces) than A2, which may be a bit pricier.\n\nFrom the city-data home page you can pull up information on both cities and compare various statistics.\n\nHands down I would recommend A2 to a 20-something person with no kids (or even with - I don't know about the schools.) I'm 50-something and would much rather live in A2 that AH, if those were my only two choices. Although I'm a bit over the college town vibe thing personally."
