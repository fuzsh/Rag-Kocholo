Juba is the capital and largest city of the Republic of South Sudan. The city is situated on the White Nile and also serves as the capital of Jubek State.

Juba became the world's newest national capital on 9 July 2011, when South Sudan formally declared its independence from the Republic of the Sudan. However, the South Sudanese government and others expressed dissatisfaction with the city's suitability as a national capital, and the government studied a proposal that would see a new planned city built as a replacement capital elsewhere.

On 5 September 2011, the government announced the capital would move some 250 km away from Juba to Ramciel. As of 2016, the move has yet to occur.
