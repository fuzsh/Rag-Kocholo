        "text": "Caroline Faria\n\nGeography and the Environment, African and African Diaspora Studies\n\nCaroline Faria's research examines three connected strands of work on neoliberal globalization, development, and nationalism. These are: 1) diasporic nationalism, violence and migration, 2) globalizing beauty trade networks, and 3) global retail capital and urban displacement. Her research focuses on Uganda and Mexico.\n\nAaron O'Connell\n\nHistory\n\nAaron O'Connell's scholarly interests span three inter-related fields: 20th-century military history, U.S. foreign affairs, and the military's effects on contemporary U.S. culture and society. He teaches courses in military history, U.S. foreign policy, terrorism and insurgencies, and the U.S.' role in the world."
