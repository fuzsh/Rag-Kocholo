        "text": "Humanitarian Needs\n\nSouth Sudan’s seemingly unending cycle of violence\n\nSouth Sudan is a country that has suffered years of conflict and violence. At the same time, it has also experienced climatic shocks which have contributed to making it one of the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Even today, there is no accurate count for the number of people who have fallen victim to the years of conflict.\n\nSouth Sudan's health care system has been severely weakened by conflict and struggles to offer even the most basic services. A large portion of the population must walk for hours to access the nearest health facility. Curable diseases like malaria and water-borne diseases kill thousands of people every day, and now they must face a new threat of the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNearly half the population in the country is estimated to be going through a food crisis, brought about by conflict. Food insecurity has been worsened by climatic events like the catastrophic floods in late 2019 that washed away crops and affected the livelihoods of an estimated 900,000 people.\n\nIn 2020, an outbreak of desert locusts has affected several countries in Eastern Africa including South Sudan and is likely to have devastating consequences for the population.\n\nICRC Action\n\nICRC’s Humanitarian action in South Sudan.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working in parts of southern Sudan since 1984 and opened a delegation in Juba in 1986. Since then, it has grown to be one of the largest operational delegations with programs in health, mental health, economic security, water and habitat, and protection with the assistance of the South Sudan Red Cross.\n\nThe medical teams provide evacuations for injured people and perform life-saving surgical interventions as well as supporting hospitals with expertise and equipment.\n\nTogether with the South Sudan Red Cross, the ICRC restores family links by reuniting families, red cross messages, and phone calls. Providing access to clean drinking water is one of the main priorities as well ensuring that people affected by the conflict have food to eat.\n\nThe ICRC also promotes respect for international humanitarian law and works with both military and police personnel through trainings and educational material.\n\nLearn more about ICRC’s humanitarian action in South Sudan"
