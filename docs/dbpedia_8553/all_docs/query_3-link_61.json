        "text": "INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES\n\nThe headquarters for Juba County was relocated from Juba city to Luri in Northern Bari Payam in 2022 (Eye Radio 2022a). Juba city hosts a number of key public institutions relating to education, healthcare and governance, including the Juba Teaching Hospital, Juba University, as well as the national government institutions. Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, major development projects and rapid urbanization as well as private sector initiatives focused on the county spurred rapid economic growth. The Konyo Konyo and Gumbo markets are the main markets in Juba, particularly for fresh produce being imported into the country and act as the feeder locations for smaller markets in Juba County and further afield.\n\nAs Juba continues to grow, the expansion of the informal economy is complemented by the web of local authorities, formal and informal though they might be, who often serve as the negotiators of personal disputes and neighbourhood management in the absence of effective civil administration (Kindersley 2019). As land values in and around Juba continue to rise and the pressures of urbanization challenge local communities’ rights to land, the role and authority of these arbiters of justice as a complement or replacement to official channels continues to evolve.\n\nJuba’s reputation as South Sudan’s centre of learning is bolstered by the range of educational institutions. Juba County is home to two hundred and twenty-two (222) Early Childhood Development centres, three hundred and thirty-one (331) primary schools and one hundred and twelve (112) secondary schools. The secondary schools are located throughout eight (8) of Juba’s payams, include two (2) all-girls schools among their ranks and four (4) institutions boast of enrolment of over one-thousand students. During the conflict with Sudan, Juba University had been re-located to Khartoum, but was moved back to Juba during the CPA period (Kuyok 2017). Following the outbreak of conflict in 2013, higher education institutions such as John Garang Memorial University and Upper Nile University were temporarily relocated to Juba from other parts of the country due to insecurity.\n\nJuba County was reported to have one hundred and eleven (111) health facilities including one hundred and seven (107) functional health facilities, among them fifty-eight (58) PHCUs, thirty-seven (37) PHCCs and twelve (12) hospitals in March 2022. This means that there were an estimated 1.52 PHCUs per 15,000 people and 3.25 PHCCs per 50,000 people according to the WHO. The Juba Teaching Hospital is the only tertiary public healthcare institution in the county, providing specialized healthcare services not available in local clinics.\n\nAccording to OCHA’s Humanitarian Needs Overview for 2023, an estimated 313,700 people in the county have humanitarian needs. Of these people, nearly 179,000 are non-displaced persons, with the remainder comprising IDPs and returnees. This is equivalent to approximately 60% of the estimated population for Juba County reported in the HNO. The former UN Protection of Civilian (PoC) site to the south-west of the city (which transitioned to a conventional displacement camp in 2020) hosts 31,865 IDPs as of July 2022 (IOM DTM 2023), many of whom were displaced at the outset of the national conflict in 2013-14. A 2022 IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix report observed that 91.5% of the households within the former UN PoC site have engaged in coping strategies to mitigate the lack of food at some point during the twelve months prior to data collection in 2021, including skipping meals. The same report found that over 39% of households in the former PoC site accessed humanitarian relief (primary food assistance), with many households requiring assistance but not receiving it, and over of surveyed households indicating they received inadequate information about humanitarian services available to them. Juba county’s WASH needs are highlighted by OCHA as particularly dire in part because of the rapid urbanization and limited public utility services available in the growing capital (OCHA 2021 p. 70). Rapid urbanization has also put a strain on fuel supplies in the capital and there has been a major expansion of the charcoal trade and increased reliance on urban markets for purchasing household fuel in recent years (Leonardi 2020).\n\nCONFLICT DYNAMICS\n\nAs the seat of the national capital, Juba County has experienced the impact of national political turbulence and a variety of localised conflicts. The Bari, Lokoya, Lulubo and Nyangwara** ethnic groups are established in the county, while groups from adjoining areas of Central Equatoria (including the Mundari of Terekeka County, and the Pajulu of Lainya County and Wonduruba Payam) and beyond (notably Dinka and Nuer communities) have played an active role in the county’s social, political, and economic life. Despite established patterns of socio-economic cooperation among Juba’s various communities, tensions have periodically arisen – notably over land and administrative issues – with tensions tending to increase during moments of national transition.\n\nJuba during the second Sudanese and South Sudanese civil wars\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the second Sudanese civil war (1983-2005), tensions had increased in Juba following a controversial round of administrative reorganisation in Southern Sudan, as well as political and economic competition between parts of the Bari, Mundari, and Dinka communities (Wani Gore 2014, see also the profile for Terekeka County). By the mid-1980s, Juba had become an increasingly isolated garrison town, with a strong SAF presence supported by a militia from part of the Mundari community that had aligned with the government (Badiey 2014, pp.57-58). This alignment would become a point of contention in the Mundari community (Africa Watch 1990, p.98). SPLM/A aligned militias were reportedly active in south-eastern parts of present-day Juba County (Africa Watch 1990, p.158). Food shortages and supply constraints in Juba town were exacerbated by the arrival of IDPs from nearby counties, with famine conditions reported in the town in the late 1980s. Despite strict government security measures, an SPLM/A underground network existed in Juba, and helped coordinated two unsuccessful SPLM/A assaults on Juba in 1992 and escalating military activity in the surrounding areas (Badiey 2014, pp.64-65). In 1993, the Sudanese government began sponsoring the Ugandan Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), who established a presence in parts of Magwi and Juba counties during the mid-1990s and disrupted SPLM/A supply routes to Uganda (Schomerus 2008, p.11).\n\nAs a result of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), the SPLM/A would establish itself in Juba, and begin the task of building administrative systems and undertaking the rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure. Although progress was made towards reconciliation and cooperation during the CPA-era, a number of tensions emerged or resurfaced in Juba during this time, which by this stage had become a rapidly expanding city and a hub for the humanitarian and development sectors. Among these tensions were various political disputes and difficulties in integrating non-SPLM/A forces into the SPLA (ICG 2016, p.9), alongside disputes relating to land and ownership of government assets, which risked undermining the working relationship between parts of the local administration and the new SPLM-led Government of Southern Sudan (Badiey 2014, ch.2). From 2006, Juba hosted peace talks between the Ugandan government and LRA, until the collapse of the talks in 2008.\n\nOn 15 December 2013, fighting erupted between members of the Presidential Guard in their Juba barracks, which became the catalyst for the nation-wide conflict that persisted until the signing of the R-ARCSS in 2018. The exact trigger of the initial conflict remains contested. Fighting rapidly spread throughout Juba as the SPLA pushed anti-government forces to the outskirts of the city and the opposition group attempted to enter Juba from Bor (Small Arms Survey 2014). Large numbers of civilians were killed, particularly during the first three days of fighting, amid numerous reports of extra-judicial killings, ethnic targeting, conflict-related sexual violence and looting (African Union 2015). In the wake of the conflict, thousands of civilians sought refuge in the UNMISS bases in Juba, creating the first of the Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites falling under the legal protection and jurisdiction of the UN. Many of those who sought protection in the PoC sites were from the Nuer community that had become displaced from their residences within the town as a result of the fighting and reprisal attacks.\n\nFollowing the 2015 ARCSS, a number of SPLA-IO leaders and soldiers arrived in Juba as part of security provisions under the agreement. Amid escalating tensions between parts of the SPLA-IO and security forces, heavy fighting between the two forces broke out in July 2016 in circumstances which have yet to be conclusively determined (Young 2017, pp.23-25). Fighting also took place near PoC sites, with a CIVIC report (2016, p.20) noting that over 30 displaced persons died during the fighting. The SPLA-IO ultimately vacated their positions in western Juba and retreated to the Congolese border, with the government consolidating control of the city.\n\nConflict dynamics in peri-urban and rural Juba County\n\nThe national conflict between the government and SPLA-IO – alongside ongoing conflict between the government and the National Salvation Front (NAS, a non-signatory to the R-ARCSS) – has also affected rural areas and settlements in Juba County, with insecurity being concentrated in Wonduruba and Lobonok payams. The spread of conflict has often had negative repercussions for civilians living in the area.\n\nFor example, in September 2015, the SPLA was reported to have clashed with opposition forces in Wonduruba (Sudan Tribune 2015), though a subsequent CTSAMVM (2017) report stated that no fighting had occurred. Instead, the report observed that allegations had been made regarding local reports that large numbers of civilians being killed in Wonduruba in September 2015 and in August 2016, and recommended that the allegations be investigated. Further human rights abuses were alleged to have occurred in Wonduruba in August 2017, according to a UN Human Rights Council report (2018, p.56). A number of reports observed insecurity in Lobonok in September 2016, reportedly occurring in the context of tensions between parts of the local community and Dinka Bor community (Sudan Tribune 2016; UN Panel of Experts 2016, p.12; UNSC 2016, p.10).\n\nMeanwhile, clashes involving the SSPDF and NAS forces escalated in the Wonduruba and Lobonok areas from late 2018, reaching Rokon Payam in early 2019. In January 2019, the SSPDF and NAS accused one another of involvement in an unexplained incident in which 19 civilians were allegedly killed in the Gorom area (UNSC 2019, p.5). Significant fighting between the forces was also reported in mining areas in Lobonok Payam, and reportedly displaced hundreds during the summer of 2020 (The Insider 2020; Radio Tamazuj 2020). Although conflict in Juba County has decreased between the NAS and SSPDF in recent years, fighting flared in Wonduruba Payam in early 2022 and early 2024, and in mining areas around Lobonok in July 2023 (UNMISS/HRD 2023; Eye Radio 2024).\n\nLocalised violence involving irregular armed groups has periodically occurred in rural and peri-urban areas in the vicinity of Juba, often taking the form of land or grazing disputes. These instances of violence have typically involved disputes between agricultural and pastoralist communities, though have increasingly occurred within pastoralists communities. Despite close connections between the Mundari and Bari communities, relations have deteriorated at several points since the signing of the CPA, resulting in insecurity on the northern outskirts of the city (Sudan Tribune 2009; Radio Tamazuj 2015). Violence has also occurred in the predominantly Nyangwara** area of Dolo Payam, allegedly involving pastoralists from the Mundari community (Radio Tamazuj 2018; Radio Tamazuj 2023a). Areas to the south-west of Juba have recently been affected by conflict within parts of the Mundari community in late 2020, with clashes shifting to the north-west of Juba in August 2021. Meanwhile, violence involving Mundari pastoralists in the Jebel Lado area to the north of Juba reportedly spilled over into the Bari community in mid-2023 (OCHA 2023).\n\nAdditionally, tensions between some local communities and security forces have increased in recent years over issues such as alleged land appropriation and civilian disarmament (Eye Radio 2022b; Eye Radio 2023a; Radio Tamazuj 2024). As noted below, land disputes in and around Juba increased following the signing of the CPA, though are reported to have re-escalated in recent years (Radio Tamazuj 2023). Land issues have become increasingly pertinent in South Sudan, in part as a result of the transition away from a political economy based around the oil economy (Craze 2023, p.23).\n\nJuba County has also been affected by a number of boundary disputes. A dispute involving Juba and Lainya counties relating to the jurisdiction over Wonduruba Payam escalated during the 2010 elections, and is discussed further in the profile for Lainya County. Tensions and occasional conflict between parts of the Mundari, Dinka Bor and Bari communities also escalated over the disputed Mangala area, which straddles the eastern border between Terekeka and Juba counties (Deng and CSRF 2020). This has been especially sensitive given the establishment of a humanitarian response – and associated inflow of resources – in Mangalla following widespread flooding in Jonglei State since 2019. Tensions most recently crossed over into violence between parts of the Bari and Dinka Bor communities in late 2022 and early 2023, with the UN Panel of Experts (2023, p.23) reporting the alleged involvement of elements of the security services.\n\nFinally, south-eastern areas of Juba were affected by spillover violence from Magwi County, which involved parts of the Dinka Bor and Madi and Acholi communities (discussed further in the profile for Magwi County). This includes two alleged attacks in June and November 2022 that took place in Lokiliri Payam (Radio Tamazuj 2022a; Radio Tamazuj 2022b).\n\nConflict dynamics affecting Juba city\n\nIn addition to the episodes of large-scale violence discussed above, the city of Juba has been affected by forms of insecurity and localised conflict relating to urban growth; the management of land resources and administrative jurisdictions; and patterns of internal displacement, resettlement, and return. Land disputes within urban and peri-urban areas of Juba increased after the 2005 CPA, and have been associated with distinct conceptions of ownership and rights (which have at points taken on a political and/or ethnic inflection), alongside land pressures relating to rapid urbanisation and the return of refugees and the South Sudanese diaspora at large (Badiey 2014, ch. 3; McMichael 2016). During the CPA-era, urbanisation and land acquisition was also linked to the reported demolition of IDP settlements (Rolandsen 2009, p.20). Criminality also increased alongside the expansion of Juba, including violence relating to gang activity. Levels of crime have been exacerbated by the deteriorating economic situation that accompanied the national conflict (2013-2018), while a number of informal security mechanisms (including community watch groups) have been established in parts of the city (Kindersley 2019).\n\nAs with a number of other urban areas of South Sudan, demonstrations have become more common in Juba in recent years. Protests have increasingly related to economic conditions and the cost of living, and occasionally to political or security developments in the country or wider region. In recent years, demonstrations relating to contested land ownership have been reported, several of which have involved violence (Eye Radio 2023b), including a land dispute in Shirikat in 2020 that resulted in subsequent demonstrations and interventions by security forces (Human Rights Watch 2020). During periods of alleged political tension as well as during some demonstrations, increased deployments of security personnel and heightened security measures are often reported (Amnesty International 2021; Sudan Tribune 2022).\n\nIn November 2020, the Juba PoC sites were transitioned from UN authority, with the state government assuming responsibility for the IDP sites and the civilians who continued to live there. The former PoC sites continue to host a predominantly Nuer population who are often unable to seek alternate solutions for their displacement, and in some instances may be unable to access or reclaim their homes (Conflict Research Programme 2019, p.9). There have been a number of incidents of protests as well as insecurity – both before and after the redesignation of the PoC sites – including violence in May 2015 involving parts of the Bul Nuer and Dok Nuer clans, and further clashes between parts of the Bul Nuer and Leek Nuer clans in 2018, that often reflect wider tensions explained in the profile on Mayom County. Occasional unrest has also been reported among IDPs based elsewhere in the city, including clashes between youths from the Murle and Anyuak communities in 2022 at the Mahad IDP Camp in Hai Malakal (Radio Tamazuj 2022c). Meanwhile, Sudanese refugees engaged in sit-in protests at the UNHCR reception centre in July 2023, expressing concern about conditions at the refugee settlement at Gorom (VOA 2023)."
