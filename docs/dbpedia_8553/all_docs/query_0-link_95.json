        "text": "What the World Food Programme is doing in South Sudan\n\nFood assistance\n\nWFP works to ensure that vulnerable people affected by conflict, displacement, climate shocks (flooding and drought) and economic crises can meet their food and nutrition needs. This includes conditional or unconditional food distributions and, where possible, cash transfers.\n\nNutrition\n\nWFP provides specialized nutritious food and nutrition counselling to pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children. The nutrition programme is twofold – treating malnutrition among pregnant or breastfeeding women and children under 5, and preventing malnutrition for pregnant or breastfeeding women and children under 2. WFP works with UNICEF and other partners to ensure nutrition programmes reach even the most inaccessible parts of the country.\n\nLivelihood support\n\nWFP works with smallholder farmers and farmers’ organizations to improve resilience to shocks, through training and the creation of assets, such as roads, dykes and shallow wells, which can boost agricultural productivity and post-harvest management, improve access to basic services and markets, and help communities adapt to climate change. WFP has introduced livelihood initiatives and supported shared community assets, such as communal farming land, in conflict-affected areas where humanitarian assistance is needed. This works helps reduce conflict and contributes to peace among communities. Where possible, WFP also procures food locally to boost livelihood opportunities and the local economy.\n\nSchool feeding\n\nSchools meals support a healthy and productive learning environment for children. Where WFP has provided school meals, enrolment and attendance rates have increased by up to 80 percent. WFP seeks to assist more than 400,000 children through school meals and a special take-home ration to encourage girls to attend classes through 2023.\n\nLogistics support\n\nWFP provides air transport and logistics services to humanitarian partners, to ensure the delivery of assistance to hard-to-reach areas. This includes flights to 59 destinations through the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service. The WFP-led Logistics Cluster provides coordination and information management, delivery of humanitarian relief items, common warehousing and geographic information system mapping. WFP also supports infrastructure works across the country. This includes building and restoring roads to facilitate the transportation of goods, and creating dykes to prevent floodwaters from devastating communities.\n\nIn focus\n\nSpiking hunger and prices: Sudan’s neighbours grapple with a refugee crisis\n\nStory\n\nAs Sudan’s war rages, fallout spreads to nearby countries\n\nStory\n\nRice to the rescue: A WFP project changes lives and diets in flood-hit South Sudan\n\nStory\n\nGrace and Salwa: a story of resilience in South Sudan\n\nStory\n\nSouth Sudanese head home from war-torn Sudan\n\nStory\n\nWorld humanitarian day: ‘WFP school meals save many girls from forced marriages’\n\nStory\n\nSouth Sudan news releases\n\nGo to page"
