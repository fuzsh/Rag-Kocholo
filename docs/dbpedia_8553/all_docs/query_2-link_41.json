        "text": "Initially used by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army during the liberation struggle, the flag was adopted as the national flag of the new Republic of South Sudan by all political parties, the Government of Southern Sudan cabinet and the Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe flag’s colours symbolize the following:\n\nRed: Blood that was shed by the liberation struggle martyrs.\n\nWhite: Peace attained after many years of the liberation struggle.\n\nBlue: Waters of the Nile River, a source of life for the country.\n\nGreen: The countries natural resources.\n\nBlack: Black African skin.\n\nYellow: Star guiding the country and its citizens.\n\nThe prominent feature of the coat of arms is the African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), which is common in most areas of South Sudan. It symbolizes vision, strength, resilience and majesty. The eagle is leaning against a traditional shield and crossed spear and spade which symbolize the people’s resolve to protect the sovereignty of their republic and work hard to feed it."
