        "text": "The construction of South Sudan's new $10 billion capital remains shrouded in mystery, with virtually no progress made more than 13 years after it was first announced, according to an analysis of recently captured satellite images.\n\nRamciel, the new capital, is located in Lakes State, in an area that was once a rhino sanctuary. Despite the lack of recent updates on the project, the government insists that it is still on course.\n\nThe South Sudanese government announced the resumption of the Ramciel project in 2023, with Vice President for Infrastructure Cluster Taban Deng Gai mentioning it was underway as recently as February of last year.\n\nHowever, no further developments have been reported since then. Pictures of the master plan appeared on social media, but many were misleading.\n\nThe original plan involves moving the executive branch of the government to Ramciel while Juba, the current capital, remains South Sudan's commercial center and potentially either the judicial or legislative hub. Currently, Ramciel is uninhabited and lacks basic infrastructure such as roads and electricity.\n\nThe relocation aims to address the unplanned nature of Juba. The capital was never intended to be a large city; it expanded from a small town to accommodate a growing population without the necessary infrastructure. The population surged from an estimated 250,000 in 2005 to over 500,000 by 2010, exacerbating congestion and straining resources.\n\nProponents argue that Ramciel offers a fresh start for a modern city designed for future growth and technological advancements. National Security Minister Oyai Deng Ajak noted that the new city could attract significant foreign investment, boosting the economy and improving citizens' lives.\n\nDespite the government's optimism, a 2006 feasibility study raised serious concerns about Ramciel's suitability. The study found that parts of the proposed site were swampy and prone to flooding, casting doubt on its capacity to support large-scale urban development.\n\n'Years in the Making'\n\nThe plan to move the capital dates back to Dr. John Garang, the late leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), before his death in 2005. According to Garang, its implementation would follow the independence of Southern Sudan.\n\nYears later, South Sudan did in fact gain independence after a January 2011 referendum, where the people overwhelmingly voted for secession from Sudan following a bloody war that left at least two million people dead, mostly civilians. The Council of Ministers then embarked on developing the master plan for the proposed megacity.\n\nThe move was also motivated by the desire to avoid land disputes with the Bari tribe, which owns much of the land in Juba.\n\nInitial planning for the project, reportedly funded by approximately $5 million from Morocco and carried out by South Korea, has faced delays due to financial constraints, political considerations and logistical challenges. South Sudan's vice president mentioned several setbacks in the construction, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly derailed the country's plans.\n\nThe decision to relocate the capital has divided opinion among lawmakers and citizens. Some see it as a way to distribute development more evenly across the country, while others view it as an unnecessary expenditure given the young nation's current struggles, including an escalating humanitarian crisis developing next door in Sudan that threatens to spill over.\n\nSeveral countries have constructed new capitals for various strategic, economic and political reasons. Brazil established Brasilia in 1960 to replace Rio de Janeiro, aiming to promote development in the country's interior and reduce the concentration of political power in coastal regions."
