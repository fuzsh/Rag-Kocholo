        "text": "JUBA, South Sudan — After a weekend of sudden bloodshed, an uneasy calm has fallen over South Sudan’s capital.\n\nOutside an imposing Roman Catholic cathedral here painted gold and white, civilians milled about on the expansive lawn. Some tried to soothe crying babies. Some sat idle in the midafternoon heat. Others lined up for small rations of food. A cease-fire had been called the night before, but many were still nervous about returning to their bullet-riddled homes.\n\n“We all ran here for our survival,” said Ray Scot, 32, who moved here with his four children on Saturday. “And people are still afraid to go outside.”\n\nOn Monday, South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, and his vice president, Riek Machar, each called for a cease-fire to end a series of back-and-forth battles between soldiers that began last Thursday.\n\nThe two men — longstanding rivals who have jockeyed for power for years — have spent much of the last two and half years leading opposing factions in a civil war that has torn this new nation apart.\n\nAs part of a peace agreement reached last August, Mr. Machar returned to Juba in April to reclaim his old post as Mr. Kiir’s vice president. But since then, troops supporting the former warring rivals have not found a way to coexist peacefully.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
