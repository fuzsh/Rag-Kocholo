        "text": "There are many things to do in South Sudan, but endless civil wars have prevented the world from seeing what the country has to offer in terms of biodiversity and culture. Internal wars have meant that the country has had to start and wait again in developing its tourism resource and overall economy, just as it appeared to be recovering after its independence in 2011. Tourism currently contributes less than 4% to the South Sudanese economy. Apart from insecurity in certain parts of the country, the greatest challenges to tourism are a lack of sufficient marketing, a scarcity of high-quality accommodation facilities, a scarcity of skilled personnel to manage the tourism sector, poor road networks, funding gaps, and weak policies.\n\nThe ongoing civil wars in certain parts of the country have played a significant role in discouraging potential visitors from visiting Juba or any of the remote towns. The news in all media outlets is negative about the country’s political situation. Few people discuss the positives, such as the fact that South Sudan has one of the world’s largest animal migrations. Fewer people mention the lakes, rivers, 14 national parks and reserves, the world’s largest swamp (the Sudd), and possibly the best birding site on the planet. Some of South Sudan’s national parks are larger in size than those in East Africa.\n\nAnother mistake many people make is assuming that what they see in Juba is the entirety of what the country has to offer. The best parts of South Sudan are found in the countryside. South Sudan’s wildlife and remarkable cultures are still isolated in the vast and remote wilderness, waiting to be discovered with the assistance of an experienced local guide.\n\nTo attract tourists to the country’s amazing tourism attractions, the country will need to work harder to build the necessary infrastructure and aggressively market the destinations. The country’s road network remains deplorable, and more high-quality hotels in national parks are needed to accommodate both budget and luxury travelers. There are already signs of progress.\n\nJuba is South Sudan’s capital and one of Africa’s fastest-growing cities. It has good lodging options and many more are being built. With direct flights from the Middle East and Africa’s major capitals, Juba International Airport is becoming busier by the day. The roads within and outside of the city are improving, and large corporations have established bases to capitalize on the available business opportunities. Juba is small enough to explore in a day or two. While in the capital, there are many interesting things to see and places to visit. Some of them will be covered as separate attractions in later chapters.\n\nThose arriving by road from Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo should fly into Juba International Airport. The University of Juba is the largest public university in the young country and a must-see. The university was founded in 1977, but due to civil unrest in the 1980s, it was relocated to Khartoum (Sudan). Students are instructed in English. After visiting the University, you can go to the new presidential palace, which opened three months after the country gained independence in 2011. Some areas of the palace are open to visitors, but photography is not permitted.\n\nRoad travelers from Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo should fly into Juba International Airport.

Students are taught in English. You can visit the new presidential palace after visiting the University, which opened three months after the country gained independence in 2011. The palace is open to visitors in some areas, but photography is not permitted.\n\nWe recommend hiking to the top of Jebel Kujur Mountain for the best views of the city. This mountain stands only 684 meters tall. Its original name was Korok, but it was changed to Kuruk because many people came to the summit to perform rituals and other forms of witchcraft. You can also visit some of the old colonial buildings or the monument in the center of the main roundabout. Konyo Konyo is the name of Juba’s largest market. It is a chaotic environment, but it is arguably the best place to observe locals congregating in one location to buy vegetables, fruits, and groceries."
