        "text": "Terrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.\n\nTerrorism in South Sudan\n\nTerrorist attacks in South Sudan cannot be ruled out.\n\nAttacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.\n\nPolitical situation\n\nFollowing 5 years of internal armed conflict, a 2018 peace agreement significantly reduced violence. However, slow and uneven implementation of the agreement means the political and security situation remains unpredictable. Conflict and a series of natural disasters have created a humanitarian crisis across South Sudan.\n\nIf the unstable security situation deteriorates, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked. Juba airport may close or be inaccessible. Flights may be cancelled at short notice.\n\nRegional developments may also affect international transport. For example, in 2019 and 2023 events in Sudan caused South Sudan’s airspace to close temporarily.\n\nIf you choose to remain in South Sudan, stay aware of your surroundings and follow political developments closely. If there is civil disorder, stay somewhere safe and limit your movements as much as possible. Avoid all protests, political rallies and large gatherings, and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services. Make sure you have a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas.\n\nCrime\n\nRobbery and assault\n\nThere is a high risk of serious crime such as robbery and assault in Juba and other urban areas, particularly at night and on public transport. There are drive-by robberies by individuals or groups on motorbikes.\n\nThere are regular attacks by armed groups and accidents on the Juba-Nimule road, the main supply route from Uganda into South Sudan.\n\nCriminals in South Sudan are often armed.\n\nCriminal kidnapping and violence against aid workers\n\nIt is extremely difficult for businesses and non-governmental organisations to work in South Sudan. Although the number of aid workers killed in targeted attacks has fallen in recent years, South Sudan remains one of the most dangerous environments in the world for aid workers. There are incidents of criminal kidnapping, violence, intimidation and arbitrary detention.\n\nRoad checkpoints\n\nCheckpoints operated by soldiers or other armed men are common in and around Juba, particularly after dark. Armed men at checkpoints have been known to demand money from drivers and abuse people, especially women. Roadblocks can create volatile and dangerous situations and are often put up after sunset, so it advisable not to travel after dark.\n\nArmed conflict\n\nArmed conflict, including violence targeting civilians is common throughout South Sudan. Fighting often starts quickly and unpredictably.\n\nLandmines and unexploded weapons\n\nThere is a risk from landmines or unexploded cluster bombs in some areas of South Sudan.\n\nAffected states include:\n\nCentral Equatoria\n\nEastern Equatoria\n\nJonglei\n\nCentral and Eastern Equatoria\n\nLakes\n\nUpper Nile\n\nWarrap\n\nWestern Equatoria\n\nMost areas with unexploded weapons have been marked and signposted, but there may still be small, previously unidentified hazardous areas in remote places.\n\nBe cautious near areas with unexploded weapons or where there was previously heavy fighting. Do not enter marked areas with landmines or other explosives. Do not touch any suspicious objects (even to move them to a safer place).\n\nLimited UK government support\n\nConsular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section. If you are in South Sudan and need urgent help from the UK government, contact the British High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nIf you decide to travel to South Sudan, make sure you carefully consider the threats and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place. Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to help keep employees safe.\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nPersonal ID\n\nPolice can ask to see photo ID. Always carry a colour copy of your passport with you.\n\nIllegal drugs penalties\n\nThere are severe penalties for using or trafficking drugs in South Sudan, including the death penalty and life imprisonment.\n\nUsing cameras\n\nDo not take photographs close to government buildings, military installations, bridges, airports, public utilities (including petrol stations) and other sensitive areas. Plainclothes public security officers operate in Juba and across South Sudan.\n\nLGBT+ travellers\n\nSame-sex relationships are not culturally accepted. Same-sex sexual activity between men is illegal and punishable by a prison sentence of up to 14 years. LGBT+ travellers are at risk of discrimination and violence.\n\nRead more advice for LGBT+ travellers.\n\nMoney\n\nInternational credit and debit cards are not widely accepted, although some of the newer hotels and supermarkets are starting to.\n\nATMs are hard to find, and it is often not possible to use international cards. You can use your credit or debit card to withdraw money in some supermarkets. Bring large denomination US dollars (clean, unblemished notes dated 2017 onwards). Dollars are acceptable currency in many places, but shops and restaurants are likely to refuse notes that are marked in any way.\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nIt is extremely dangerous to drive in South Sudan due to armed robbery, violent attacks and poor driving standards.\n\nDriving standards are well below those in the UK and other European countries. Very few roads are surfaced and maintained, particularly outside Juba. Residential areas usually have dirt roads. Road traffic accidents are common, particularly on the Juba-Nimule road.\n\nAt night there is almost no street lighting, and many vehicles have no lights. Motor vehicles share the road with pedestrians, donkey carts and rickshaw-style cabs.\n\nAlthough drivers should have a licence and insurance, many do not. Make sure you have adequate insurance. Your insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice.\n\nYou can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in South Sudan. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP).\n\nSee information on driving abroad.\n\nPublic transport\n\nPublic transport, including small buses, vans and motorbike taxis (‘boda-bodas’), is extremely unsafe. Drivers are reckless, traffic accidents are common and vehicles are in poor condition. There is also a high risk of mugging. Avoid public transport.\n\nExtreme weather and natural disasters\n\nFind out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.\n\nFlooding\n\nDuring the rainy season from April to November, most roads outside of Juba become impassable. There is a risk of being cut off by floods in areas outside the capital, particularly in Unity, Warrap, Jonglei and Upper Nile states. There is also a risk of flash flooding."
