        "text": "JUBA, South Sudan—(July 10, 2016)– As South Sudan marked five years of independence, the peace process seemingly collapsed with outbreak of violence in the capital city of Juba that quickly spread to areas surrounding the city. In order to avoid complete fallout of the country and further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis, CARE calls on the warring parties to reach a ceasefire immediately and return focus to the signed peace deal.\n\nFred McCray, CARE Country Director based in Juba, South Sudan said: “In the past three days, we have watched South Sudan’s peace deal crumble before our very eyes. The violence erupted in Juba on Thursday night, and has been ongoing throughout the weekend. The fighting escalated significantly on Sunday with small arms fire, heavy artillery and helicopter gunships ensuing on multiple parts of the city. This violence has caused widespread panic and massive displacement in Juba and the surrounding areas. Families are fleeing multiple times seeking safety from the violence that has taken over the city the past few days. CARE is particularly concerned for the safety of women and girls who are most vulnerable in this volatile environment. It is imperative that the warring parties reach a permanent ceasefire immediately, before the violence spreads throughout the country and more innocent lives are impacted.”\n\n-END-\n\nMedia Contact: Holly Frew hfrew@care.org +1.770.842.6188"
