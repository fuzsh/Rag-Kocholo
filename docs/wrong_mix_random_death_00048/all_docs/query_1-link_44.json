        "text": "Treat Williams, the star actor of Hair, left the world in pieces after his motorcycle accident in Vermont that eventually took his life on June 12. The tragic end to the 71-year-old’s life was confirmed by his agent of 15 years. Barry McPherson said, “He was killed this afternoon. He was making a left or a right [and] a car cut him off.”\n\nWhat has been confirmed since is that crash happened on Monday around 5 p.m. on Route 30 by Long Trail Auto near Dorset, Vermont. Meanwhile, the world has been in shock by this tragic loss. WTA legend Chris Evert and her best friend, Martina Navratilova, mourned the loss on Twitter.\n\nTreat Williams’ death left Martina Navratilova dejected\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs reported by People, Fire Chief of Dorset Jacob Gribble confirmed that the incident involved a car and the motorcycle driver by Williams. He informed that the accident left nobody hurt except Williams. Later, LifeNet helicopter was brought to the location to airlift Williams to the hospital.\n\nThe 59-time Grand Slam winner tweeted that Treat Williams left the world too soon. Her tweet reflected her sadness like many other grievers across the globe. Who better to sympathize with the dead than someone who has successfully beaten a deadly disease? Navratilova beat cancer twice successfully. She tweeted, “via @NYTimes- this is so sad… RIP Treat, gone too soon!”\n\nEarlier this year, the 66-year-old was diagnosed with double cancer in the breast and throat. However, this wasn’t the first time the legendary Czech-American tennis star had a tryst with this deadly disease. In 2010 she was diagnosed with non-invasive breast cancer and fought with a lumpectomy.\n\nREAD MORE: Nostalgic ‘King’ Richard Celebration Brings Yesteryear Emotions to 42-Year-Old Venus Williams as She Finds Right Motivation to Excel in Her Highly-Anticipated Grass-Court Comeback\n\nOn both occasions, Navratilova showcased her steely spirit to overcome the disease.\n\nNavratilova was scared she may not be around to ‘see next Christmas’\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe nine-time Wimbledon winner has had to endure two separate bouts with cancer. Just when she thought her breast cancer was treated, she was diagnosed with throat cancer with a relapse of breast cancer.\n\nIn an interview with ‘Piers Morgan Uncensored’ on TalkTV, she said: “As far as they know, I’m cancer-free. I was in a total panic for three days thinking I may not see next Christmas. The bucket list came into my mind of all the things I wanted to do. And this may sound really shallow, but I was like, OK, ‘which kick-a** car do I really want to drive if I live like a year?”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBesides Navratilova, Chris Evert was also under the evil claws of cancer. However, they are both now cancer-free."
