        "text": "Rafael Nadal is \"convinced\" Carlos Alcaraz will be at a \"great level\" for the Olympics ahead of their anticipated doubles team-up.\n\nThe pair will be representing Spain at the upcoming Games in Paris, with both also participating in the singles event.\n\nNadal reached his first final since his French Open triumph in 2022 at the Swedish Open on Sunday, eventually losing out to Nuno Borges in straight sets.\n\nHe has previously won two Olympic gold medals though, his first in the singles at the 2008 Games in Beijing, and the second at Rio 2016 in the doubles.\n\nMeanwhile, Alcaraz has won back-to-back grand slams this year, winning at Roland Garros in June before beating Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon earlier this month.\n\nThe 21-year-old is competing at the Olympics for the first time in his career ahead of the hard-court swing of the season.\n\nNadal admitted he was not happy with his performance level in the final in Bastad and is determined to improve to match Alcaraz's level.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to being part of the Olympic team and representing Spain,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"This is the most important event in sport. I hope I can find the energy I need and do some good training.\n\n\"If I manage to play good tennis, I will also do so in doubles, but I must analyse well what happened this week and work hard.\n\n\"I am convinced that Carlos will be at a great level because he is coming in with confidence. We will train together this week.\"\n\nRafael Nadal felt his performance levels at the Swedish Open were \"so far from what they should be\", but was pleased to emerge from his run to the final in Bastad without any injuries.\n\nThe 22-time major winner reached his first ATP championship match since winning his 14th French Open title two years ago, losing out to Nuno Borges in straight sets.\n\nNadal saw off Leo Borg and Cameron Norrie, before battling past Mariano Navone and Duje Ajdukovic in three sets. However, he was no match for Borges, who was a commanding 6-3 6-2 winner in the final.\n\nThe injury-plagued Spaniard opted to skip Wimbledon to focus on participating in the forthcoming Paris Olympics, where he will play in the singles and doubles events.\n\nAnd though he admitted he wanted to play better in Bastad, Nadal was thrilled to come through multiple demanding matches unscathed.\n\n\"The level was so far from what it should be. Probably, the energy too. It has been a long week with long matches,\" Nadal told reporters.\n\n\"I don't have damage [to my body], that's important - but mentally and physically, I'm not used to playing four days in a row and playing long matches.\n\n\"I need to analyse well and find the reason why I played that way, even if the energy wasn't right. Things like this can happen, and that's the situation.\n\n\"I played the final, that's positive. I was able to play long matches without having an injury. That's good.\n\n\"In some ways, I felt that I arrived here practising much better than what I played in the tournament during the whole week. That's something that I am not satisfied with.\"\n\nArthur Fils came through a decisive tie-break to beat home favourite Alexander Zverev in the Hamburg Open final, securing his second ATP-level title.\n\nThe 20-year-old triumphed 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-1) in a three-and-a-half-hour marathon, saving a remarkable 21 of 22 break points, including five in the final set, to follow up his 2023 triumph in Lyon.\n\nFils raced into a 3-0 lead in the opener before having to fend off four break points in the fifth game as he took the lead, but defending champion Zverev roared back in the second set.\n\nZverev got the breakthrough six games into a back-and-forth second as the big-serving German forced a decider.\n\nHaving saved break points at 4-4 and 5-5 in the third, Fils came on strong in the tie-break, recording the biggest win of his career and his fourth versus a top-10 opponent.\n\nData Debrief: Fils' rise continues as Zverev falls short\n\nFils is just the second player aged under 21 to triumph at the Hamburg Open, after Roger Federer in 2002 and Lorenzo Musetti in 2022.\n\nZverev, meanwhile, missed the chance to become the fifth man to defend the Hamburg title in the Open Era, after Eddie Dibbs (1973-74), Andre Medvedev (1994-95), Federer (2004-05) and Nikoloz Basilashvili (2018-19)."
