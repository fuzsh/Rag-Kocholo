        "text": "Can you think of a better health and fitness ambassador for the American Association of Retired Persons than tennis legend Martina Navratilova?\n\nI can’t.\n\nFirst of all, she’s actually retired from the women’s pro tour twice – the second time was just last year one month shy of her 50th birthday. Secondly. she defected from communist Czechoslovakia in\n\n1975 and has been a proud – and outspoken – American citizen since 1981.\n\nMartina called me the morning of the AARP announcement last week for a quick chat.\n\n“I sort of represent longevity and the face of health and fitness,” she said. “I’m in the middle of the baby boomer generation and AARP is going back to prevention of problems rather than fixing them with\n\ndrugs. The baby boomer generation is a big target for AARP, trying to prevent problems down the road. It’s about making members as active and vital and healthy as possible. I’ve been living that lifestyle for a long time now.”\n\nWhen Martina retired from the women’s tour in 1994, she did so shortly after reaching her 12th Wimbledon singles final at the age of 36. That was considered quite an accomplishment for someone of such advanced tennis age. So people thought she was a little nuts when six years later, she decided to rejoin the tour as a doubles player.\n\n“So what if I didn’t play as well as I did when I was 25,” Martina said of her second tennis cereer. “I’ve never let the naysayers get in the way. I’ve sort of done my thing, obviously, and never let age define me. I sort of believe in doing what you love to do and really going after what your dreams are. Go after what you are passionate about.”\n\nShe went on to win many more titles in her 40s, including mixed doubles crowns at Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the U.S. Open. Her second retirement from tennis came in September 2006 – one month shy of her 50th birthday.\n\nHow did she celebrate? By winning the U.S. Open mixed doubles title with Bob Bryan.\n\nMartina’s had a few knee surgeries since then and, well, there have been other life changes: “I’ve been going through menopause and put on a few pounds this year,” she said. “I wasn’t able to do as much\n\nphysical activity and I was traveling a lot. That’s no way to stay healthy. I had to get rid of a few pounds, I got fed up with not feeling as well or moving as well.”\n\nSo, like millions of other Americans – retired or not – she had to get back into shape.\n\n“I started running again, for five minutes the first day and was too tired,” she admitted. “Two days later I went 17 minutes. I worked up to an hour. The legs are starting to look better and I lost a few pounds. But my preference is doing organized sports – soccer, softball, basketball. Get me on a treadmill and it’s like torture.\n\nDon’t do what’s torturous for you do what you really enjoy and make sure you don’t overdo it at first.”\n\nTo read the first part of my interview with Martina, which deals with being an out athlete in a hostile environment, click HERE.\n\nDonny Osmond!\n\nI dunno, kinda hard to believe. He still looks terrific and is working as hard as ever. I like Donny for many reasons. First, he has preservered in showbiz even when it was tough for him to be taken seriously post the “Donny & Marie” show. So he took to the stage and did hundreds of performances of “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” and re-invented himself in the late 80s with his “Soldier of Love” album. Since then, he has continued to tour and to release new albums of various genres from 70s love songs to Broadway tunes. He even hosted a daytime talk show for a few years with Marie as well as a few game shows. But one thing I most admire him for is how candid he was in his memoirs about his crippling panic attacks that threatened to derail his career on stage. He helped a lot of people by going public and sharing the story of his recovery.\n\nI met Donny a few years ago at a DVD Conference in Marina del Rey and he could not have been nicer. I wanted to do an interview with him after an awards ceremony and he jokingly played hard to get: “Daily News? No way.” I mentioned that my big sister had bought “One Bad Apple” in the 70s. He shook his head no. Then I mentioned how much I liked “Soldier of Love” and he warmed up a bit. I finally hit paydirt after telling him what a great job he was doing hosting the “Pyramid” game show! Hey, sometimes ya gotta pull out the big guns.\n\nDonny was in the process of putting together the “Donny & Marie” DVD sets and was absolutely involved in every stage of production and told me which skits he was going to include and he seemed as excited as a kid.\n\nI guess in some ways, Donny will always be young at heart.\n\nHappy Birthday!\n\nAlexis Arquette swept onto the red carpet of the Ribbon of Hope Celebration last weekend and stopped for a gab. Of course, I just had to come out and ask if her sister, Rosanna is dating Paul McCartney as has been reported.\n\nShe’s very, very, very close friends with Paul, they’re good friends,” Alexis said. “I know a lot but I’m not saying (expletive). They don’t need the pressure. It’s so high school, actually junior high school, for people to be going (in Valley girl voice), `Are you guys going out yet?”‘\n\nAlexis was the subject of the documentary “Alexis Arquette: She’s My Brother” which screened at Outfest last summer and says she’s now working on a book proposal: “A lot of it’s on being a transgendered actor in Los Angeles and also being a sibling of [several] stars and a lot of it’s just kind of views on society and morality. They’re describing me as the anti …I’m blanking on her name…Who’s the blonde conservative writer we all hate?”\n\n“That would be Ann Coulter,” I say.\n\nAlexis: “Yes! I’m the anti-Ann Coulter!”\n\nAnd finally, i mentioned to Alexis that I had interviewed Tuc Watkins recently and when I asked for his thoughts on her, he said that whenever he thinks of her, he smiles. The two played a couple in the gay indie classic “I Think I Do” back in 1999 and also shared many delicious scenes in the awesome Showtime series “Beggars and Choosers.” Tuc was a gay TV exec and Alexis played a tempermental transgender actress.\n\n“Oh, I love me some Tuc Watkins,” she told me. “I’ve worked with him several times and it’s always good when somebody looks that good and has a brain on him, you know?”\n\n…Yes, the brain seems very nice…and so does that body! The photo is of a pre-transgendered Alexis and Tuc in “I Think I Do” which is on DVD. My favorite line is when Tuc, playing a self-absorbed soap actor, is sticken when Alexis wants to break up and says: “But I told you my REAL age!”\n\nThis is chilling, especially for those of us who often attend events in Hollywood. Actor David Blue, who we’ve recently gotten to know as Cliff on “Ugly Betty” – a photographer who is dating Michael Urie’s character of Marc. St. James – was mugged at gunpoint in the heart of Hollywood after leaving a wrap party for season 2 of “Ugly Betty.”\n\nHere is his blog entry about the scary incident:\n\n“Sorry to be a downer\n\n,\n\nI went to a wonderful wrap party for season 2 of UGLY BETTY tonight. It was a blast, full of cast, crew, producers, writers, etc. I had a lot of fun with America, Michael and a bunch of other nice people. In fact, even after working on the show for so long, I had somehow never gotten pictures of myself with any of the people I’ve worked with. So, tonight I took a lot of pictures and had a great time.\n\nThen, walking back to my friends’ car, about a block away from the party, two men jumped out of their car and held a gun to my face and stole my wallet and my friends’ purse/camera/phone. They drove away and I’ve spent the past 2 hours talking with the police and my credit card companies.\n\nThere’s a sad part of me that is just happy that I got away alive and that my friend wasn’t hurt. There’s another sad part of me that is happy they got me and not America Ferrera, Michael Urie, Judith Light or anybody else at the party with WAY more money than myself.\n\nThere’s another sad part of me that is so angry that I just want to see these people put behind bars as soon as possible. You see, though I’ve been lucky to recur on two different shows, I’m still far from financially stable. I don’t have any money for these people to steal. Hopefully, I was able to catch my credit cards before they got anything. [In fact, all my companies say they tried to spend some money on ALL of them in the past 20 minutes at a single gas station but were denied because I cancelled them so fast.] But now I have no money for food, supplies or anything for a week. It’s sad how quickly your life can be affected… and even more sad how angry a few people’s SAD choices can affect people’s lives so morosely.\n\nIt bothers me that this was Hollywood. I’ve lived in New York, Astoria, Queens, Florida, Kentucky, Virginia, Texas, all over… and this crap happened in the heart of Hollywood near a MAJOR intersection. I’m just glad we were smart enough to hand over our money so quickly. Because I can tell you, even with a gun in my face, my first reaction was to nail this guy in the face with as many punches as I could muster… but instead I looked at my female friend and realized it’d be better to hand over my wallet and call the police.\n\nBe careful kids. And let’s hope these guys get caught before they do too much damage. The police told us that this has happened a few times in the past few weeks. And on top of that, as we were in their car, we heard a radio call saying another mugging happened with the same description…about 30 minutes after ours.\n\n_david”\n\nThe movie version of the smash Broadway show “Rent” may not have made “Dreamgirls” or “Hairspray” level box office grosses, but it did something even better in my opinion: it cast much of the original cast from the stage production including the amazingly talented Anthony Rapp who I met last week at the Ribbon of Hope Celebration.\n\n“I call it like a showbiz miracle. Like, it never happens,” Anthony said. “Occassionally maybe one person from an original cast. But six of us? It was amazing. A gift.”\n\nThe 36-year-old actor returned to Broadway for a several months this summer and fall to reprise his signature role of Mark Cohen in the still-running show that remains a huge part of his life and career.\n\n“I wrote a book that came out last year and I’m working on a one-man show adaptation of it called “Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss and the Musical ‘Rent,'” Mark said. “It’s about being in the show, my mom passed away while I was in the show and [playwright] Jonathan Larson who wrote the show passed away so it’s about the amazing fulfillment of being a part of that experience at the same time as these really difficult thing happened. The complicated colliding of all that.”\n\nAlthough “Rent” provided Anthony with a break-out part, he has been working professionally since the age of nine. He played Charlie Brown in the Broadway revival of “You’re A Good Man Charlie Brown” and other theater credits include the original Broadway production of “Six Degrees of Separation” (he also appeared in the film version), “An American Family” as well as productions of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” and “Little Shop of Horrors.”\n\nHe’s also worked steadily in other mediums. On television, Anthony had a recurring role on NBC’s “Kidnapped,” and guested on such series as “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and “The X Files.” In addition to “Rent” and “Six Degrees,” movie credits include “Winter Passing,” “Open House,” “A Beautiful Mind,” “Road Trip,” “School Ties,” “Dazed and Confused” “Adventures In Babysitting” and “Twister.”\n\nBut “Rent” still draws him and Anthony embraced being something of a spokesman for the musical which has been running on Broadway for more than a decade. Inspired by and partially based on Giacomo Puccini’s opera La bohme, “Rent” is about impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York’s Alphabet City in the thriving days of the Bohemian East Village, under the shadow of AIDS.\n\nThat shadow still exists, even after all these years.\n\n“I got to go to South Africa this year to work on a production of “Rent” there, I directed it, and the AIDS and HIV world there is so different there than it is here,” Anthony said. “I’m seeing both sides of things. There, they have so little access to many of these drugs that are helping so many people here. At the same time, here, the drugs aren’t always helping everyone in the same way. So, we’ve made enormous strides, but it certainly is not over…The flip side of the [drug] cocktails is that people are probably taking bigger risks than they used to because they think you take the cocktails and everything’s fine. My musical director in South Africa is HIV positive and he’s very healthy but it’s a big deal in his life. He has to take those cocktails, it’s not a small thing.”\n\n“I’ve been in the business since I was a kid in the early 80s and I witnessed colleagues of mine even then succumbing to AIDS. We didn’t even know what it was. My mom was a nurse and she worked in the prison system so we was a part of that front line. So, it’s been a part of my world and awareness for a very long time.”\n\nIf anyone is wondering why writers are so important to what we watch on television, you need look no further than last night’s classic episode of “Ugly Betty.” There were so many delicious lines from start to finish that I could barely scribble them all down – plus I was laughing at the same time.The episode, “Bananas for Betty,” will be the last we will see in 2007. Three more episodes have been shot so we will see them sometime next year and unless the strike is resolved soon and everyone goes back to work, that will be it for the sophomore season of this inspired show.\n\nI gotta start with the Betty White storyline. The Golden Girl played herself and she was shoved to the ground by Wilhelmina (Vanessa Williams) while trying to get a cab on a rainy night. “I’m Wilhelmina Slater and I don’t get wet!” she says as she flings some money at Betty and the cab takes off.\n\nSomeone recorded the whole thing with a cellphone and it ends up all over the news. Wilhelmina: “Obviously I didn’t know it was Betty White – I thought it was just some old lady in the rain!” she tells Marc who has been trying to rehab her tattered public image. Earlier that day he had her doing a series of good deeds (“Trust me lady, I can make you into Mother Teresa – with better boobs.”\n\nCut to Betty White in the hospital talking to TV reporter Suzuki St. Pierre (Alec Mapa): “I stopped to sign a few autographs and almost bled out on the sidewalk.” Betty says she loves her fans “except for the sickos who keep writing lesbian fiction about me and Bea Arthur!”\n\nBefore the cameras roll, Betty White checks her make-up and complains: “Oh terrific, I’m going on TV with whore eyes!”\n\nBetty White calls Wilhemina saying she forgives her. Wilhelmina wants her to do it on camera to restore her public image. So she shows up to the hospital ready to make nice. Betty turns on her: “I’m sorry honey, this feud is huge and I’m gonna milk it till it’s dry!”\n\nBut she’s a TV legend, she doesn’t need the publicity. Betty cracks: “Are you kidding? The ‘Golden Girls’ money went right into the nickel slots!”\n\nThere were two other storylines going on including Daniel (Eric Mabius) and Alexis (Rebecca Romijn) battling for control of the magazine. It ended up in a silly paint ball fight but intially, they are fighting over their late father’s desk chair and Daniel says to his transexual sister: “Why are you so strong? Did they give you super strength when they installed your vagina?”\n\nOK, before I get into the Harry and Betty on a date stuff, one more line. It was one from the English dress designer (name escapes me right now) who said to Betty Suarez when they were talking about the movie “27 Dresses” which stars Katherine Heigl and James Marsden (in some not-so-subtle movie product placement):\n\n“I love James Marsden. I want to bake him naked and eat him for dessert!”\n\nGet in line honey!\n\nAnd finally, Betty (America Fererra) and Henry (Christopher Gorham). Love them! Already posted video of their date scene that has Betty trying to eat an ice cream sundae off of Henry’s stomach. It’s a disaster: “My belly button’s frozen!” Henry says before the ice cream gets all over Betty’s glasses.\n\nLater, Henry tries to fix the sink in Hilda’s new salon and ends up drenched forcing him – lucky for us – to wear a way too-tight T-shirt belonging to Justin. “Can I really rock this look?” Henry asks Justin of the midriff baring look. Anyway, the sandwich guy (Freddy Rodriguez) who has the hots for Betty asks Hilda out and they end up at a dance club with Henry and Betty. Henry ends up catching on fire (really) and it looks to be a disaster until he returns, wearing a wife-beater T-shirts, and proceeds to dance like he was John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever.”\n\nIt was, hot!\n\nIf “Dante’s Cove” star Charlie David were merely one of the most handsome men on television, you’d want to hate him for being so beautiful. But because he is so smart, so multi-talented and so wonderful to talk to, he is a cut above the usual beefcake we love to admire from afar.\n\nI’ve interviewed Charlie several times now and caught up with him again last weekend at the Ribbon of Hope Celebration. This season on “Dante’s,” Charlie had blonde highlights but they now gone. I wondered about the whole hair thing because, you know, a serious journalist needs to know these things.\n\n“It was a travesty really,” a laughing Charlie said of his blonde do. “It was one of those things where I thought with the relationship with Kevin (Gregory Michael) over, sometimes when you come out of a relationship, you decide to re-invent yourself with a little bit of a new look. So that’s what I figured Toby was doing. Flush out the old, bring in the new because, of course, Toby’s with Adam (Jon Fleming) this season. But I’m glad it’s grown out and is back to the natural.”\n\nI had to know, do blondes have more fun? Said Charlie: “Maybe this season! (laughs).”\n\nWhile “Dante’s Cove” has made many of us fans of Charlie, it’s not his only regular gig. He has for several years now hosted the gay and lesbian travel show called “Bump!” which this fall was added to the here! Network which also airs the gay soap.\n\n“I just got back from South America,” Charlie said. “I did Argentina and Brazil so I’m pretty lucky. Every month or so I go to a few different countires and knock off 3-4 episodes. It’s absolutely wonderful. It’s really fun and now the show is getting more distribution and I think we’re the world’s number one watched gay and lesbian travel show. Now it’s available on here! and on webisides and mobisodes. You can get it everywhere.”\n\nIn addition to the television work, Charlie has appeared in several indie films (“A Four Letter Word,” “Kiss the Bride”) but his next one is especially close to his heart: it’s called “Mulligans” and not only does he star, but he wrote the script and is a producer. He plays a young man who begins an affair with his best friend’s FATHER!\n\nI’m sure the script is terrific but Charlie, are there hot love scenes?\n\n“Of course there’s some hot love scenes! [“Dante’s Cove” co-star] Thea Gill is absolutely brilliant in the movie. Brilliant. Brilliant. She was over for dinner the other night and we watched a few scenes together. So, we’re poretty excited about it.”\n\nThe film is currently in post-production with things like color correction, sound and soundtrack being worked on with the goal of being ready for the film festival curcuit this spring: “So keep your eyes peeled,” Charlie advises.\n\nCharlie is busy, but not too busy for love. He’s been “very happily together with a great guy” for the last year-and-a-half.\n\nBut no names!!"
