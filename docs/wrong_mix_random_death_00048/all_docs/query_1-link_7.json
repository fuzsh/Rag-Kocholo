        "text": "Tennis legend Martina Navratilova shared some uplifting news on Monday.\n\n“After a day full of tests at Sloan Kettering, I got the all clear!” the 66-year-old wrote on Twitter.\n\n“Thank you to all the doctors, nurses, proton and radiation magicians etc- what a relief:) #byebyecancer and yes, #f–kcancer!!!”\n\nNavratilova first revealed in January that she was undergoing treatment for throat and breast cancer, both of which were discovered in the early stages.\n\nAlthough she stated in a March interview with Piers Morgan that she was cancer-free, Navratilova explained at the time how she was due to have further preventative radiation for two weeks on her breasts.\n\n“Then I should be good to go,” she said, according to The Sun.\n\nThe 18-time Grand Slam champion was previously diagnosed with a non-invasive form of breast cancer in 2010 and had a lumpectomy and six weeks of radiation treatment.\n\nThe Czech superstar is regarded as one of the most decorated athletes in tennis as no player since 1968 has won more singles tournaments, doubles events or matches.\n\nNavratilova has won 59 major titles, including 31 in women’s doubles and 10 in mixed doubles, the last of which coming at the U.S. Open in 2006, a month away from her 50th birthday.\n\nShe is also a nine-time Wimbledon champion, who won the tournament six straight times from 1982 to 1987.\n\nElsewhere on the court, Navratilova had a long-standing and legendary rivalry with Chris Evert.\n\nThe two played 22 Grand Slam matches, which Navratilova led 14-8.\n\nShortly after Monday’s update, Navratilova’s wife, “Real Housewives of Miami” star Julia Lemigova, said she is excited to begin the next chapter of their lives together.\n\n“We just try not to go too much ahead of ourselves. Just embracing each other, thanking life for every healthy day and being positive, being happy and just taking it slow. It’s almost like a clean slate in life,” she told People.\n\n“I have no idea what the future shows, really don’t. I’m just happy to be healthy. I’m happy that Martina is healthy.”\n\nNavratilova married Lemigova, 50, in 2014."
