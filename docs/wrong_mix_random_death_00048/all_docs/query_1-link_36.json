It’s going to stink for a while, but I’ll fight with all I have got.\"\n\nA spokesman for Navratilova told The Times that \"both these cancers are in early stage with great outcomes.\" She’s not expected to travel for the Australian Open as her treatment is reportedly set to begin treatment for the cancers later this month.\n\nNOVAK DJOKOVIC ARRIVES IN AUSTRALIA NEARLY A YEAR AFTER COVID-19 VACCINE SAGA, DEPORTATION\n\nBoth cancers are in the early stages.\n\nShe was diagnosed with breast cancer more than a decade ago. She underwent an operation to remove the cancer cells along with radiation treatment and kept up with her exhibition tennis schedule.\n\nNavratilova is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time – up there on the Mount Rushmore list with Serena Williams, Chris Evert, Billie Jean King and Margaret Court. She was ranked No. 1 in the world for 332 and won 59 major titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles competitions.\n\nNotably, she won nine Wimbledon titles."
