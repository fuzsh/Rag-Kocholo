        "text": "Martina Navratilova is a legend in the sport of tennis, known for her calm and measured approach to disagreements, although she has recently found herself at the epicenter of a heated debate over trans rights within competitive sports.\n\nWhilst Navratilova has been opposed to trans athletes being able to compete alongside genetically born women, the nature of the row recently got turned up a level as the former tennis great got into an argument with a journalist.\n\nThis discussion stemmed from accusations that Navratilova was leading an \"anti-trans crusade.\"\n\nNavratilova has publicly endorsed the Take Back Title IX-Our Bodies, Our Sports rally, demonstrating her opposition to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nShe was pictured at the rally with Olympic swimmer Donna de Varona, former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines, and former women's lacrosse coach Kim Russell, showing her dedication to maintaining traditional gender roles in sports.\n\nWhy did the journalist say to Navratilova?\n\nRenowned reporter Ben Rothenberg accused Navratilova on Twitter of turning her opposition to the inclusion of trans athletes into an \"anti-trans crusade.\"\n\n\"Martina Navratilova turning this anti-trans crusade into her life's obsession in recent years remains dispiriting,\" Rothenberg posted on Twitter.\n\n\"And she turns it into way more transphobic vitriol than just discussing sports fairness, as I've covered before, just being nasty and cruel and dehumanizing. Boo.\"\n\nWhat was Navratilova's response?\n\nNavratilova responded strongly, making it clear that she didn't agree with the journalist's perspective.\n\n\"Yet another man telling women what they should care about. And who are you exactly? Oh yeah, the reporter who tells tennis players it's off the record and then prints what they said anyway,\" she replied.\n\n\"Good to know you care about women's sports and women's sex-based spaces. I care.\""
