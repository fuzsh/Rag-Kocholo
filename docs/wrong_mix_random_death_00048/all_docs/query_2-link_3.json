        "text": "This year's Wimbledon gathered numerous tennis legends in the stands, including 62-year-old Martina Navratilova, a retired Czech tennis player who was greeted by fans with applause.\n\nHowever, the most attention was attracted by her beautiful wife Julia Lemigova, with whom the tennis player has been married since 2014. It is about the last Miss of the USSR, the second companion of the world contest for Miss Universe from 1991 and the daughter of the former general of the Red Army, who had an interesting but also tragic life.\n\nJulia, 47, is now a successful business woman who has a failed marriage to French banker Edouard Stern, who left her then-wife. The couple soon had a son Maximilian, but he died after 6 months under unclear circumstances. While he was with his father, he suddenly fell ill, and the autopsy showed brain injuries.\n\nHis soon disappeared Bulgarian nanny, who was suspected of killing the boy in retaliation for Stern. It was suspected that Stern himself had killed his son, but there was no evidence.\n\nStern was very jealous and possessive and followed Julia every step, and the model found it increasingly difficult to bear. Shortly after the tragic death of their son, their marriage fell apart, and in 1995 Stern was found dead.\n\nAt that time Julia was in Paris where she opened a beauty salon and blamed her for the death of her ex-husband his mistress.\n\nStern was found in pink latex jumpsuit, and was killed by a prostitute whose services he often enjoyed. Given that it was about orgies of the rich in which a powerful company took part, the whole case was covered up.\n\nThe meeting with Martina Navratilova meant a big turning point for Julia because since then things have gone well for her. After a six-year relationship, they got married, and Julia has two daughters whose father is not known to the public."
