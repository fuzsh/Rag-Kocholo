        "text": "As a former Playboy model, reality star and the wife of prominent Miami plastic surgeon Dr. Leonard Hochstein, Lisa is officially the richest cast member.\n\nLisa and her husband also co-own the Hochstein Medspa, which they describe as “where luxury meets state-of-the-art technologies and treatments”.\n\n2. Martina Navratilova, 65\n\nEstimated net worth: US$25 million\n\nThe Czechoslovakian-American tennis player is widely considered one of the greatest players of the sport of all time – and now she’s also dabbling in reality TV! Yep, the 65-year-old tennis icon appears on RHOM as the wife of cast member Julia Lemigova.\n\nNot surprisingly, Navratilova has accumulated an impressive estimated net worth of US$25 million until now. Best of all? She’s probably the most modest star on the show, and has turned her Miami mansion into an actual farm house.\n\n3. Marysol Patton (friend), 55\n\nEstimated net worth: US$15 million\n\nAfter running one of the premiere public relations firms in the city, The Patton Group, Patton started off as a cast member and has returned to the reboot as a friend of the cast.\n\nIn April 2021, the 55-year-old businesswoman married Steve McNamara in Tulum, Mexico, in a traditional Mayan ceremony lead by a shaman.\n\n4. Larsa Pippen, 47\n\nEstimated net worth: US$10 million\n\nLarsa Pippen rose to fame as the wife of NBA star Scottie Pippen, but the pair called it quits in 2018 after 21 years of marriage.\n\n5. Adriana de Moura (friend), 56\n\nEstimated net worth: US$10 million\n\nAdriana de Moura, best known as the “Brazilian bombshell of the Miami art scene”, appeared on the earlier seasons of the show, which followed her luxurious life with then-fiancé, Frederic Marq. The couple eventually got married in front of the show’s cameras.\n\nSince then, they separated in 2020, and the newly single reality TV star has returned as a friend of the cast for the latest season.\n\n6. Alexia Echevarria, 54\n\nEstimated net worth: US$3 million dollars\n\nCuban-born Alexia Echevarria is back for more drama following her wedding to Todd Nepola in St. Barths back in December 2021. The ceremony took place four months after the death of her mother Nancy, who died of Covid-19 on the same day Echevarria was previously meant to get married.\n\nThe reality star was previously married to Herman Echevarria, who died in 2016. If anyone deserves a pleasant season four, it’s Echevarria.\n\n7. Nicole Martin, age unknown (but believed to be 36)\n\nEstimated net worth: US$2.5-3 million\n\nDr. Nicole Martin is one of the three newcomers on season four, and she’s wasted no time dazzling viewers with her charm.\n\n8. Guerdy Abraira, 43\n\nEstimated net worth: US$2-3 million\n\nBorn in Haiti, and raised in Paris and Miami, newcomer Guerdy Abraira is the fabulous party planner of the group. Back at home, she’s a mum of two boys and has been with her high school sweetheart husband for 26 years.\n\nWith her company Guerdy Design cementing her as one of the top planners in the world, Abraira has only started making her millions.\n\n9. Julia Lemigova, 49\n\nEstimated net worth: US$1-3 million\n\nAnother newcomer, Julia Lemigova is a Russian former model and was crowned Miss USSR 1990.\n\nLemigova and her wife Navratilova have made reality TV history this season by becoming the first ever same-sex couple to be featured on the Housewives franchise.\n\nShe was previously in a relationship with banker Édouard Stern. The couple had a son, Maximilian, who died of shaken baby syndrome following the appointment of a new nanny.\n\n10. Kiki Barth (friend), 32\n\nEstimated net worth: US$1-1.5 million\n\nKiki Barth is a model, mum and former Miss Haiti who joins season four as a friend of the cast.\n\nFollowing her move from Haiti to the US aged 13, she started her modelling career at age 16 to provide for her family, and bagged her first big break on a Bobbi Brown project."
