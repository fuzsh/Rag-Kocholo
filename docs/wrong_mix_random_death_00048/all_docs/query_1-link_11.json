        "text": "The former tennis player, Martina Navratilova, is hailed as one of the most ferocious and dominant players in the history of the sport. Navratilova defied the odds by winning the Wimbledon title at the age of 34 while the other players of her era were retiring at the age of 30.\n\nThe 18-time Grand Slam title winner, Navratilova, once revealed how she was a groundbreaker in longevity because of her off-court activism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nMartina Navratilova once talked about her fitness levels after the age of 30\n\nThe former Czech-American tennis player, Navratilova, once revealed that the basketball star Nancy Lieberman once criticized her for being lazy and also asked her to train harder. Later on, Navratilova started cross-training when it was barely a concept. She worked and trained with the help of a female bodybuilder. Additionally, she started sprinting daily to enhance her fitness levels.\n\nNavratilova also changed her diet with the help of a nutritionist, and her physique improved massively. She also appointed a new coach, Renée Richards, and grasped the skill of hitting a topspin backhand and forehand volley. As a result, Navratilova’s game became more aggressive, and she used to dominate her opponents with her attacking skills on the tennis court.\n\nALSO READ- ‘How Fab Is This?!’ – Martina Navratilova Reacts as a Dog Beautifully Plays ‘Setter Position’ During a Volleyball Game\n\nLater on, her friend and rival Chris Evert also opted for cross-training. The next generation of tennis athletes was also inspired by Navratilova. The American tennis legend’s hard work and training was one of the major reasons why she became a Wimbledon champion at the age of 34. Additionally, she also has many double championships on her glorious tennis journey.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNavratilova also stated, “It lifts the pressure off you.” She added, “It’s like having a near-death experience. Once you go through it, you embrace life.”\n\nNavratilova is a staunch supporter of the L.G.B.T.Q community\n\nIn the 1980s, Navratilova was hailed as one of the best on the tennis court. However, she didn’t have the liberty to talk about her sexuality during that time. She won many Grand Slam titles but also faced difficulties to come out of the closet. But, after many struggles and backlashes, she decided to come out as a lesbian.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch this story: Rise of a superstar – Iga Swiatek’s victorious moments on the WTA tour\n\nBeing a part of the community herself, Navratilova understands the criticism and backlashes faced by the L.G.B.T.Q. community. As a result, she has always shown her support and respect for female athletes like Billie Jean King. Navratilova is also very active on social media, as she likes to give her unfiltered thoughts on various important issues."
