        "text": "Tennis greats Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert have been accused of \"turning their backs on women\" after pushing back on plans to hold the season-ending WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia's capital.\n\nLast week, the former on-court rivals rallied together to lobby the women's professional tennis tour to keep the WTA Finals out of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"There should be a healthy debate over whether 'progress' and 'engagement' is really possible, or whether staging a Saudi crown-jewel tournament would involve players in an act of sportswashing merely for the sake of a cash influx,\" they wrote in an op-ed piece printed in The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Fury at surprise twist in Russian teen's doping ban\n\nREAD MORE: 'I won't quit': Murray lashes out over 'dumb' column\n\nREAD MORE: 'Next Nathan Cleary' in line for 'shock' selection\n\nSaudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, has responded, expressing that the pair's stance is \"beyond disappointing\".\n\nEvert and Navratilova claimed that staging the tournament in Saudi Arabia \"would represent not progress, but significant regression\" with women's rights in the country still subject to gender discrimination about marriage, family, divorce, and the criminalisation of same-sex relationships.\n\n\"Not only is this a country where women are not seen as equal, it is a country where the current landscape includes a male guardianship law that essentially makes women the property of men. A country that criminalises the LGBTQ community to the point of possible death sentences. A country whose long-term record on human rights and basic freedoms has been a matter of international concern for decades,\" they wrote.\n\nBut in a statement, Princess Reema declared that the pair had rejected the very same women the tour was working to inspire.\n\nPrincess Reema said Evert and Navratilova should \"get your facts straight\" on matters of the law influencing women's rights and claimed their arguments were \"based on outdated stereotypes and western-centric views of our culture\".\n\n\"Failing to acknowledge the great progress women have made in Saudi Arabia denigrates our remarkable journey. This not only undermines the progress of women in sports, it sadly undermines women, progress as a whole,\" she said.\n\n\"Sports should not be used as a weapon to advance personal bias or agendas or punish a society that is eager to embrace tennis and help celebrate and grow the sport.\"\n\nPrincess Reema did not address the pair's criticism of laws that criminalise the LGBTQ community.\n\nTennis is the latest sport to be approached by the wealthy kingdom, following significant investments in golf, Formula 1, football and combat sports.\n\nSaudi Arabia began hosting the men's tour's Next Gen ATP Finals for the top 21-and-under players in Jedda last year as part of a deal that runs through to 2027.\n\nCritics of the deal between tennis' governing bodies and the Saudi government have accused the country of using sports-related investments as a way of sportswashing its concerning human rights record.\n\nFollowing her first-round win at this month's Australian Open, women's world No.1 Iga Swiatek told media that female players were still waiting on confirmation of the host venue for the WTA Finals.\n\n\"There were a lot of rumours about the WTA Finals going to Saudi. We're still waiting for the decision,\" she said.\n\n\"It is always hard for me to say if it's good or not because it's not easy for women in these areas. Obviously, these countries also want to change and improve politically and sociologically. It's not easy to decide. Also in terms of many events that were held, there were rumours about sportswashing.\"\n\nAfter withdrawing from the Australian Open, 22-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal announced that he would serve as an ambassador for the Saudi Tennis Federation, a role that will involve spending dedicated time in the Gulf nation with the establishment of a Rafael Nadal Academy there.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with Rafa (Nadal) and his decisions, it should be up to the federations and the governing bodies who decide if we're going to play there or not. If there would be some negative backlash, they should take the responsibility,\" Swiatek said.\n\n\"For me, it's hard to straightforwardly go one way and say anything. I didn't even know about Rafa's decision. Obviously, men's sport is already there in Saudi. I don't know if it's a good decision or not. I'm kind of trying not to be too upfront.\""
