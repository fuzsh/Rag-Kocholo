        "text": "The timing of it all hardly could be more symbolic: All within a span of two weeks, Serena Williams plays what is believed to be her last match at age 40, Roger Federer announces he’ll be retiring at 41, Iga Swiatek wins her third Grand Slam title at 21, and Carlos Alcaraz gets his first at 19.\n\nThis combination photo shows the cover of \"All In: An Autobiography\" by Billie Jean King, left, and King posing for a portrait on June 4, 2015, in New York. Alfred A. Knopf announced Thursday, March 4, 2021, that the book will be published Aug. 17 and will cover the highlights of King's celebrated and groundbreaking tennis career. (Knopf via AP, left, and AP)NEW YORK – Billie Jean King has a memoir coming this summer, and she calls it a journey to her “authentic self.”Alfred A. Knopf announced Thursday that “All In: An Autobiography” will be published Aug. 17. She was married to Larry King (no relation to the late broadcaster) for more than a decade before being outed in 1981. King published a memoir in the early 1980s, “Billie Jean King: The Autobiography,” but says she rushed it out at the urging of her then-manager, who was concerned about her finances in the wake of her outing.\n\nThe last American man to win a Grand Slam tournament was Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open in 2003, and there's no sign the drought will end anytime soon. “But I don’t see it being what it once was ever again.”AdOpelka, for one, isn’t surprised the United States has the same number of seeded men in Melbourne as, say, Bulgaria or Norway. The United States has four seeded women in Melbourne, including Kenin and Serena Williams. That’s a challenge, because those kids want to play basketball and football.”The United States Tennis Association has inner-city programs in more than 250 locations. Opelka (ranked 38th), Fritz (ranked 31st), Tommy Paul (53rd) and Frances Tiafoe (64th) are all 23 and good friends who root for each other."
