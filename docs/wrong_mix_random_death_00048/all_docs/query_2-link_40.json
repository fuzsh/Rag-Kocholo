        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tennis great Martina Navratilova said Monday that she has been diagnosed with throat cancer and breast cancer.\n\nIn a statement released by her representative, the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion and member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame said her prognosis is good and she will start treatment this month.\n\n“This double whammy is serious but still fixable, and I’m hoping for a favorable outcome,” the 66-year-old Navratilova said. “It’s going to stink for a while but I’ll fight with all have I got.”\n\nShe said she noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck while attending the season-ending WTA Finals in Fort Worth, Texas, in November, and a biopsy showed early stage throat cancer. While Navratilova was undergoing tests on her throat, she said, the unrelated, early stage breast cancer was discovered.\n\n“Needless to say my phone and twitter are both blowing up so I will say again - thank you all for your support and I am not done yet,” she tweeted Monday.\n\nNavratilova was diagnosed with a noninvasive form of breast cancer in 2010 and had a lumpectomy.\n\nShe won 59 Grand Slam titles overall, including 31 in women’s doubles and 10 in mixed doubles. The last was a mixed doubles championship with Bob Bryan at the 2006 U.S. Open, a month shy of her 50th birthday.\n\nNavratilova originally retired in 1994, after a record 167 singles titles and 331 weeks at No. 1 in the WTA rankings. She returned to the tour to play doubles in 2000 and occasionally competed in singles, too.\n\nNavratilova was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000. She has worked as a TV analyst in recent years.\n\nThe statement issued Monday said Navratilova would not be a regular part of Tennis Channel’s coverage of the Australian Open later this month “but hopes to be able to join in from time to time” via video conference.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
