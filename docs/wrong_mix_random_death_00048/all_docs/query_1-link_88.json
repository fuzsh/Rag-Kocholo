        "text": "The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that this year, the United States will see 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 51,400 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). “Well, I was one of the 51,000 DCIS patients, and I was lucky,” declared Martina Navratilova. The tennis icon is aware of her good fortune as she knows that over 43,000 women are expected to die from the second-most common cancer in women (skin cancer is first.) In recognition of October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the nine-time Wimbledon champion sat down with me to share her journey with this potentially fatal disease, from the early stages of diagnosis and treatment, to what’s compelling her to speak out publicly (watch the full interview here and below).\n\nWhen She First Found Out\n\n“It was four years between mammograms,” recalled Navratilova, who was diagnosed in January 2010 at age 53. She was told that the cancerous changes likely began at the latter end of the four years. “But if it had happened earlier, who knows where the cancer would've gone? So, I felt obliged to speak out and make women aware because I wasn't aware.” After the initial diagnosis, Navratilova underwent a lumpectomy followed by 30 days of radiation.\n\nThe tennis legend is partnering with Hologic, an innovative medical technology company and pioneer of 3D mammography (a.k.a. digital breast tomosynthesis). Hologic formed an alliance with the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) in March 2022.\n\nEarly testing really is the key. But women still don’t prioritize their own health, according to Navratilova.\n\n“Women take care of everybody else but we don't take care of ourselves,” noted the outspoken women’s health advocate. “But if your dog needs to have a rabies vaccination, you take him tomorrow, right?”\n\nDisparities in Care\n\nNavratilova also recognized disparities in care. While breast cancer incidence between Black and white women are close, the ACS reports that Black women have a 40% higher death rate from breast cancer. Unfortunately, for younger Black women, the disparity is worse: the mortality rate among Black women under age 50 is double that of young white women. And it’s not genetic or biological; it’s structural, social and economic. Black women are more likely to have heart disease, diabetes and obesity, according to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, all of which increase their risk for developing breast cancer.\n\nBlack Women and Breast Cancer\n\nBlack women are also less likely to have adequate health insurance compared to white women. The lack of universal health care in the wealthiest nation in the world still flabbergasts the Czechoslovakian-born tennis star. “People still equate healthcare for everyone as socialism,” remarked Navratilova. She firmly clarified: “No, there's nothing socialist about it. It's about the health of the nation which means better outcomes for everybody, whether it's economical, emotional, mental, physical. It's nothing but a good thing when everybody has that access.”\n\nRisk Factors for Getting Breast Cancer\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, the biggest risk factor is advancing age – the median age of diagnosis is 63 for white women and 60 for Black women. Dense breasts, a history of radiation therapy, obesity and a lack of physical activity can also increase the risk of breast cancer. In addition, early menses, late menopause, nulliparity, alcohol consumption and a family history of invasive breast cancer or DCIS are also risk factors. Research also suggests that smoking, exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and hormonal changes related to night shift work are associated with a rise in breast malignancy.\n\nHow Can I Prevent Getting Breast Cancer?\n\nYou may not be able to change your family history or your race, but according to the CDC, you have the power to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by keeping a healthy weight, being physically active, consuming alcohol in moderation (or not at all), breastfeeding (if possible) and getting genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 if you have a family history. You should also talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nMartina’s Message to Policymakers\n\nThe candid athlete did not hold back when sharing her views on the role of elected officials. “Make sure you know what policy you're making,” said Navratilova, and specifically, avoid making “policies that impact people negatively.” This was a not-so-subtle reference to laws restricting abortion access proposed by many state and local officials. “We have politicians making rules and laws for women when they don't know anything about women's healthcare. They don't know what an ectopic pregnancy is,” referring to the treatment of this potentially life-threatening condition which requires ending a nonviable pregnancy using either medications (if possible) or induced abortion.\n\nAdvice for Doctors\n\nThe former world #1 tennis player also had a message for medical professionals like me. “They need to be more on the forefront with this stuff. They've been too quiet. Doctors now are waiting for the lawyer to tell them if it’s okay to perform an abortion because otherwise, the woman's gonna die,” said the 18-time Gland Slam champion. “I mean, it's insane that politicians are making healthcare decisions.” It is, indeed, insane. Navratilova’s comments resonated with me because accurate health messaging matters.\n\nA 2021 Ipsos poll ranked physicians as the most trusted profession – and we need to leverage that trust by advocating for our patients and the public, correcting misinformation and standing up to corrupt and misogynistic elected officials who create policies to advance their own political agenda. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Americans held a high level of trust in physicians at a time when healthcare professionals were needed more than ever. I was a late comer to the advocacy space, making excuses like ‘I don’t have time,’ I don’t know how’ and ‘I’m just one person.’ I quickly learned, however, that health advocacy needn’t be time-consuming. Small steps can pay huge dividends: emailing or calling a local official; signing an online petition; posting on your social media pages; attending a protest; donating money; or volunteering your time.\n\nSo, whether you’re a seamstress in South Sudan or an elite athlete in the International Tennis Hall of Fame, your life has VALUE. Preventive health measures like mammograms and colonoscopies can save lives. This October, reflect on what matters to you and to your loved ones, and put your health FIRST!\n\n*****"
