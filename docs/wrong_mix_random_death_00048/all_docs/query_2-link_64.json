        "text": "Kind and creative, Amanda Doyle lived a life rich in family and friends. Amanda was upbeat, fun-loving, and laid back. Never one to judge others, Amanda was a warm person who ensured people felt safe and comfortable. Amanda had a great sense of humor. Her subtle, quick wit made people smile. Amanda was loving, supportive and accepting. She led with her heart and inspired others to do so as well. A treasured daughter, sister, granddaughter, cousin, companion and friend, Amanda will long be remembered and missed by all who were blessed to know her.\n\nThe year 1985 was the year Michael Jordan was named NBA's \"Rookie of the Year,” Live Aid pop concerts in Philadelphia and London raised over 50 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and Steven Spielburg brought the Color Purple to American Theaters. Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA and We Are the World, recorded by the supergroup USA for Africa dominated the airways while Martina Navratilova won her 100th tennis match. But most notably, Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns were taking the ring for a big boxing match on April 15 when Amanda decided to begin her debut into the world. Born to Michael and Terri (Nyenhuis) Doyle on April 16, 1985 shortly after midnight in Fort Hood, Texas, she was welcomed with loving arms. In December 1985, Mike completed his enlistment in the US Army and the family moved back to Wyoming, Michigan.\n\nThe family settled into their family home on Johanna Avenue in 1987. Amanda enjoyed the good company of her older sister Angela and her younger brother Patrick. Amanda spent much of her time with neighborhood friends Kristi Jones, Kyla Feier and next door neighbor Brandon Miller. They enjoyed swimming in the family pool, nearby Pinery Park, and renting movies from Blockbuster. Amanda and her family spent summer days at the beach, including Maplewood Lake in Jenison and Lake Michigan. As a young child, Amanda's gifts for the arts began to shine. She loved painting and drawing and later learned to sew from her mother. She learned to love travel when the family frequently made the trip to Florida to visit her great-grandma in St. Petersburg and also to Mike’s hometown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They also spent time visiting Canada and Chicago. Amanda found her love of animals at a young age. The family had cats, bunnies, and guinea pigs. Amanda would carry the love of animals her entire life.\n\nAmanda attended Godfrey Lee Public Schools. During her school years, Amanda played volleyball. She also enjoyed bowling and was part of a league at Comet Lanes every Saturday. She had also had a part time job at Walden Woods, a senior living community. She was voted best dressed in high school. Amanda graduated from Godfrey Lee in 2003.\n\nAfter high school, Amanda went to Grand Rapids Community College for the Radiological Technician program. During this time, Amanda worked at Applebees in Wyoming and Electric Beach, a tanning salon. She met her best friend, Chelsi Melville, while working together at Electric Beach. After graduating from GRCC, Amanda took a job at Bouma and worked her way into an accounting role. For the last couple of years, she worked at Advantage Millwork.\n\nFor about 8 years after high school, Amanda dated Nolan Rowe. While with Nolan, their Shih Tzu Chloe was a favorite canine companion. When Nolan found his first home, she expertly helped him decorate. They parted ways in 2012.\n\nAmanda met Chris Syrba, who she dated for 9 years. While in Italy, Amanda and Chris became engaged. Sadly, Chris passed away in November of 2021.\n\nThe loves of her life also included her cats, Loki and Neko. She was quite the cat lady, with a cat camera in her house, bird feeders to keep them entertained, and a warm lap always ready for a snuggle.\n\nAmanda loved traveling and taking adventures with the people she loved, including her best friend Chelsi and her sister, Angela. She loved to plan for them as well, a self-described planning guru. Whether going to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, camping, Italy, or on a cruise to the Caribbean, she loved excursions and exploring the world. It was common for Amanda to pose for a picture with an animal she encountered along the way.\n\nA year and a half ago, Amanda reunited with Nolan. The pair cooked together, making new recipes and starting a cookbook of their favorites. On their walks, they would occasionally stop alongside a nearby farm to feed the animals. They talked of their next vacation, one where she could go whale watching. She loved Christmas and said the best part was wrapping the gifts, because often the presentation is the best part. She was looking forward to signing up to wrap gifts for others.\n\nThroughout her life, she was slow to anger and quick to forgive. Full of joy and bubbly, she would quickly laugh at her own dry jokes. But most importantly, she created a safe place where people could simply be themselves around her.\n\nThough our days with Amanda were far too few, every moment we shared proved a gift we will long treasure. As we celebrate Amanda’s life, may we find much comfort in our many wonderful memories. May we also find comfort in the honor of carrying her beautiful legacy forward. Whenever we fully embrace the moment, say “yes” to adventure, choose love, embrace others with kindness, marvel at an animal, or curl up in one of the blankets she made for us, we keep Amanda’s bright spirit alive and inspiring others as she so inspired each of us.\n\nAmanda Marie Doyle, age 39, of Kentwood, passed away June 6, 2024. Amanda is survived by her parents, Mike Doyle and Terri Doyle; sister Angela (Aaron) Pease; brother Patrick Doyle; niece and nephew Grayson and Emma Pease; grandparents, Mike & Dee Doyle; aunts and uncles, Kathy Haverkamp, Tom (Julie) Doyle, Susan (Andy) Filius, Tammi Parmalee; many cousins; boyfriend, Nolan Rowe; and her longtime dear friend, Chelsi Melville. She is also survived by her cats, Neko and Loki.\n\nAmanda is preceded in death by her grandma, Judy Nyenhuis.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to gather to celebrate her life on Sunday, June 30, at Heritage Life Story Funeral Home – Alt & Shawmut Hills Chapel. A service will begin at 3 PMand there will be an open house to visit with her family from 4-6 PM."
