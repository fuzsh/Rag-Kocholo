        "text": "- LONDON - The ghost of Wimbledons past has seen the future of women's tennis, and its name and their name is Williams.\n\nThe bespectacled Martina Navratilova suffered from double vision Wednesday afternoon.\n\nShe stared upon, at once, both the Williams Wonder Women, Venus and Serena.\n\nTeam Williams, which will be split today in the women's semifinals, beat Martina and her Legend.\n\nBut Navratilova corroborated why she is unmatched among the women who've played in the fabled history of the All England Tennis and Croquet and Green Grass Club.\n\nIn the doubles quarterfinal, Navratilova and partner Mariaan de Swardt shocked V&S in the first set, 6-4. But the Williamses, whose combined ages are five years younger than the 43-year-old Navratilova, came back to dominate the next two sets 6-2, 6-1.\n\n\"It was a once-in-a-life opportunity\" to play Navratilova, Serena Williams said. As if the elder stateswoman of tennis is at death's door.\n\n\"How old is she?\" Williams said.\n\nWhen told her opponent's age, Serena, like all teenagers, seemed convinced that Navratilova is ancient.\n\nBut the Williams sisters realized after the first set - and after their father/coach Richard Williams abruptly departed - that they weren't playing some charity case on Court No. 3. Navratilova certainly was unleashing some pent-up brilliance.\n\n\"She was my favorite player when I was a kid,\" said Serena, who at 18 is still is a kid. \"I always wanted to play against her, but never thought I would get to.\"\n\nPicture Alex Rodriguez batting against Bob Feller.\n\nNavratilova, Venus Williams said, \"played better than we ever expected. Our power didn't seem to get to her. Her hands were quick as ever, probably quicker than ours.\" Serena said Navratilova \"really played decent tennis. Her serve has a lot of weird stuff on it.\"\n\nColorado's own Martina Navratilova ...\n\nWith an aspenrisk (that's an amalgamation of Aspen and asterisk). The Czech-born Martina became a United States citizen after she turned pro and spent many years living in the glitzy Colorado mountain town.\n\nBut after winning the singles title at Wimbledon a record nine times - most recently in 1990 - she \"retired\" four years ago.\n\nAlthough Wimbledon honored its old-timers last weekend, Navratilova didn't just want to get a salute and a souvenir sweater. She signed up for the women's and the mixed doubles events. And she made it this far. \"It was a blast, even more fun than I thought it would be. I haven't played (competitively) for years, and I held my own.\"\n\nShe was on form and in shape. Martina still can hang with the youngsters. \"In my prime I could have beaten Venus and Serena, but they're not in their prime yet,\" she said, breathing normally after the match.\n\nNavratilova raised the bar ... uh, the net ... in tennis because of her overpowering serve and forehand strength. But the Williams sisters amaze Navratilova, who is 5-foot-7 and 147 pounds. \"They are so imposing. Venus is so tall (6-1), and Serena has shoulders out to here,\" said Navratilova as she extended her arms to the length of a swordfish. \"They hit the ball hard, hard, hard.\n\n\"If they can harness that power and become technically more efficient, they both can be No. 1 and No. 2 (or 1 and 1A) for a long time.\"\n\nMartina The Magnificent did. I first met Martina at a women's tennis tournament in Denver in 1975. She was a pudgy teenager who barely knew English. Now she speaks it like an Aspenite. She possessed an innocence of personality and a heavy hand on the racket. Navratilova and Chris Evert took their show on the road - aggressive against finesse styles.\n\nNow, Venus and Serena are the duo to view. One of them can win Wimbledon for the first time this weekend. The other will be defeated in the semifinals for the first time here. They didn't want to talk about their matchup Wednesday. \"We feel like we've answered enough of those questions,\" said the elder sister and Team Williams leader, Venus.\n\nBut Navratilova, who, as a TV commentator, has observed Venus and Serena from upstairs, but never from up close before Wednesday, was willing to handicap the Sistero a Sistero duel. \"I give Serena a slight edge. She is hitting the ball deeper, and she is coming to the net better. Venus has more of a flawed serve, and it can get away from her. Serena comes at you a little bit more physically, but they both have great positioning on the court. Whomever makes the fewer unforced errors will win.\n\n\"It will be a slugfest.\"\n\nFrom 1978-94, Martina Navratilova reigned at Wimbledon, and she always bowed at victory.\n\nAt the end of her match Wednesday, she smiled, waved and bowed out gracefully while keeping an eye on the future."
