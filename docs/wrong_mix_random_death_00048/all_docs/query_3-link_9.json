        "text": "LONDON -\n\nMartina Navratilova returned to TV work at Tennis Channel for its coverage of the Miami Open on Tuesday, less than three months after saying she had throat cancer and breast cancer.\n\n\"It's great to be back. ... Thrilled to be here,\" said the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion and member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. \"So happy to be working. How many people can say that?\"\n\nThe 66-year-old Navratilova said her sense of taste disappeared during the treatment for cancer and she lost 15 pounds. She did not appear on television during the Australian Open in January or the BNP Paribas Open this month.\n\n\"It puts you face-to-face with your mortality, No. 1, because at the beginning, I wasn't sure if it was treatable, so that was hard,\" she said. \"But once I got into the program, it was a little easier emotionally, but more difficult physically. ... But I'm still standing.\"\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV scheduled to air Tuesday, Navratilova said she has been told by doctors that, \"as far as they know, I'm cancer-free,\" and that she should be \"good to go\" after some additional radiation treatment.\n\nAccording to The Sun newspaper, Navratilova also told Morgan that when she was diagnosed, \"I was in a total panic for three days, thinking I may not see next Christmas\" and came up with a bucket list of things she wanted to do.\n\nShe noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck while attending the season-ending WTA Finals in Fort Worth, Texas, in November, and a biopsy showed early stage throat cancer. While Navratilova was undergoing tests on her throat, she said, the unrelated, early stage breast cancer was discovered.\n\nNavratilova was diagnosed with a noninvasive form of breast cancer in 2010 and had a lumpectomy.\n\nShe won 59 Grand Slam titles overall, including 31 in women's doubles and 10 in mixed doubles. The last was a mixed doubles championship with Bob Bryan at the 2006 U.S. Open, a month shy of her 50th birthday.\n\nNavratilova originally retired in 1994, after a record 167 singles titles and 331 weeks at No. 1 in the WTA rankings. She returned to the tour to play doubles in 2000 and occasionally competed in singles, too."
