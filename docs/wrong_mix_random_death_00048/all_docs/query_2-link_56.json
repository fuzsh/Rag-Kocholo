        "text": "It’s no secret the ladies of The Real Housewives of Miami like to make it rain. We’re talking cash, of course. Loads and loads of cash. From lavish homes and extreme parties to trips to the Hamptons, top-shelf booze and a few nips and tucks, these personalities spend it hard and fast.\n\nWith season 5 of RHOM well on its way, let’s see which of the Miami housewives have the highest net worth, shall we?\n\nSee also: Interview: Alexia Nepola talks ‘RHUGT’ and ‘fighting like sisters’ with Marysol Patton.\n\nJulia Lemigova’s net worth: $1-3 million\n\nThe former Russian model and Miss USSR 1990 has earned the majority of her income from her days as a model, but she has also run successful beauty business ventures over the years. At one time she was romantically linked to successful banker Édouard Stern, who died in 2005. These days she’s married to tennis superstar Martina Navratilova, whose own estimated net worth is $25 million.\n\nRelated: RHOM’s Julia Lemigova reacts to wife Martina Navratilova’s cancer diagnoses: ‘We will fight this.’\n\nGuerdy Abraira’s net worth: $2-3 million\n\nThis Haitian-born housewife (who grew up in Paris and Miami) is also a mom-to-two and married to her high school sweetheart. On the show, she has been known to throw a fabulous party or two, so it makes sense that she earns her bread as the owner of Guerdy Design, a top-rated, international wedding planning company. While things have naturally taken a bit of a hit during COVID, back in 2020 the personality was named Harper Bazaar’s Top Planner in the World, which makes us think that Guerdy is only getting started on her fortune. Currently, Distractify places her net worth at somewhere between $2 million and $3 million.\n\nYou might also like: The Real Housewives of Miami: then and now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr. Nicole Martin’s net worth: $2.5 million\n\nThis anesthesiologist earns her income through her work with the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics and as an attending physician at the Lennard Foundation Medical Center. There, she reportedly pulls in nearly $390K per year. It seems like a fair salary for what she does, especially since she has been practicing for a decade now. Given Nicole’s current participation in RHOM, it seems as though her $2.5 million net worth is destined to increase even more in the years to come.\n\nSee more: Real Housewives who come from humble beginnings.\n\nAlexia Nepola’s net worth: $3 million\n\nThis “Cuban Barbie” is a successful businesswoman and the former executive editor of Venue Magazine, which basically involved being on the forefront of fashion and picking out all of the latest trends. She’s also the widow of well-known businessman Herman Echevarria. These days Alexia is the co-owner of Alexia + Frankie’s Beauty Bar, “a hidden gem” that offers “more than just manicures and pedicures,” and has secured a net worth of $3 million.\n\nRead more: Alexia Nepola claps back at Leah McSweeney after harsh comments on ‘RHUGT.’\n\nAdriana de Moura’s net worth: $10 million\n\nThis Brazilian bombshell has reportedly earned her cash through modelling gigs and of course her time on the show’s original run, where she was estimated to have made $75,000 per season. She’s also appeared in other reality and scripted projects, but one of her biggest sources of income is a little more surprising: art. Adriana studied Art and Culture in Florence and Paris and is now a successful curator with a specialty in Brazilian works.\n\nRead more: 10 Things to know about Julia Lemigova, the first lesbian Real Housewife.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLarsa Pippen’s net worth: $10 million\n\nLarsa may be known as NBA star Scottie Pippen’s ex-wife, or as an ex-friend to the Kardashian Krew (she used to appear regularly on their series until the families had a falling out in 2020). These days though, Larsa’s side-hustle is real. She reportedly pulls in her money as a social media influencer, she has her own jewellery brand and she’s the owner of Larsa Pippen Fitness. Then there’s her OnlyFans page, where her exclusive content reportedly brings in around $10,000 a day.\n\nRead more: Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan’s relationship timeline.\n\nMarysol Patton’s net worth: $15 million\n\nWhen Marysol first hit the RHOM scene back in Season 1, we knew her as a PR maven who ran the premiere public relations firm, The Patton Group. While she no longer works at the company (she left it behind in 2016), these days she’s married to businessman Steve McNamara and seems to lead a more chill life, despite her impressive net worth. That could be in part because of her mother’s death in 2019; the two were pretty close. You may recall the psychic, “Mama Elsa,” from her previous appearances during the show’s original run.\n\nRead more: Marysol Patton on why ‘RHOM’ is so good this time around.\n\nLisa Hochstein’s net worth: $50 million\n\nThe former Playboy model (and Toronto native), beauty expert and fitness guru is among the richest cast members of the bunch, helped of course by the fact that her ex-husband, Dr. Leonard “The Boob God” Hochstein, is a prominent plastic surgeon. Now, however, her impressive net worth could fluctuate quite a bit, as her and Leonard are getting a divorce.\n\nRead more: The ‘RHOM’ season 5 trailer previews the destruction of Lisa Hochstein’s marriage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT"
