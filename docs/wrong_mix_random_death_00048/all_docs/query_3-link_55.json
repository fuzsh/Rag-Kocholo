        "text": "Martina Navratilova (Czech: Martina Navrátilová pronounced [ˈmartɪna ˈnavraːtɪlovaː]; born Martina Šubertová pronounced [ˈmartɪna ˈʃubɛrtovaː]; October 18, 1956) is a retired Czech American tennis player and coach. Billie Jean King, former World No. 1 player, said in 2006 that Navratilova is \"the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who's ever lived.\"[1]\n\nNavratilova won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, 31 major women's doubles titles (an all-time record), and 10 major mixed doubles titles. She reached the Wimbledon singles final 12 times, including nine consecutive years from 1982 through 1990, and won the women's singles title at Wimbledon a record nine times. She and King each won 20 Wimbledon titles, an all-time record. Navratilova is one of just three women to have accomplished a career Grand Slam in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles (called the Grand Slam \"boxed set\") a record she shares with Margaret Court and Doris Hart. She holds the open era record for most singles titles (167) and doubles titles (177). She recorded the longest winning streak in the open era (74 consecutive matches) and three of the six longest winning streaks in the women's open era. Navratilova, Margaret Court and Maureen Connolly share the record for the most consecutive major singles titles (six). Navratilova reached 11 consecutive major singles finals, second all-time to Steffi Graf's 13. In women's doubles, Navratilova and Pam Shriver won 109 consecutive matches and won all four major titles in 1984, i.e. the Grand Slam. Also the pair set an all-time record of 79 titles together and tied Louise Brough Clapp's and Margaret Osborne duPont'srecord of 20 major women's doubles titles as a team. In addition she won the season ending WTA Tour Championships a record 8 times and made the finals a record 14 times and won the doubles title a record 11 times. Navratilova is the only person of either sex to have won eight different tournaments at least seven times.[2] Navratilova is one of only five tennis players all-time to win a multiple slam set in two disciplines, matching Margaret Court, Roy Emerson, Frank Sedgman and Serena Williams.\n\nOriginally from Czechoslovakia, she was stripped of her citizenship[3] when, in 1975 at the age of 18, she asked the United States for political asylum and was granted temporary residency.[4] At the time, Navratilova was told by the Czechoslovakian Sports Federation that she was becoming too Americanized and that she should go back to school and make tennis secondary.[5] Navratilova became a US citizen in 1981, and on January 9, 2008, she had her Czech citizenship restored.[6] She stated she has not renounced her U.S. citizenship nor does she plan to do so and that the restoration of her Czech citizenship was not politically motivated.[7][8]\n\nNavratilova is a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy. She also serves as the Health and Fitness Ambassador for AARP[9] in an alliance created to help AARP's millions of members lead active, healthy lives.\n\nNavratilova is involved with various charities that benefit animal rights, underprivileged children, and gay rights.\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Early life and tennis career\n\n2 Personal life\n\n3 Activism and politics\n\n4 Career statistics\n\n4.1 Records\n\n5 Awards\n\n6 Recognition\n\n7 Media\n\n8 See also\n\n9 Notes\n\n10 References\n\n11 Further reading\n\n12 Video\n\n13 External links\n\nEarly life and tennis career[edit][]\n\nNavratilova was born Martina Šubertová in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her parents divorced when she was three,[10] and in 1962 her mother Jana married Miroslav Navrátil, who became her first tennis coach. Martina then took the name of her stepfather (adding the feminine suffix \"ová\"), thus becoming Martina Navrátilová (Czech pronunciation: [ˈmarcɪna ˈnavraːcɪlovaː] ([1] listen)). Her father Mirek[11] remarried and divorced. When she was eight, he committed suicide.[12] In 2008, Navratilova's mother died of emphysema, aged 75.[13]Navratilova has a sister, Jana, and an older paternal half-brother.[10]\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 15, Navratilova won the Czechoslovakia national tennis championship. In 1973, aged 16, she made her debut on the United States Lawn Tennis Associationprofessional tour but did not turn professional until 1975. Although her career is largely defined by her mastery of fast low-bouncing grass, her best earliest showing at majors was on the red clay at the French Open. In 1973, she made the quarterfinals where she lost 6-7 4-6 to Evonne Goolagong. She made the quarterfinals the next year and lost to Helga Masthoff (née Niessen), after again losing the first set in a tiebreak. She won her first professional singles title in Orlando, Florida in 1974, at the age of 17. Upon arriving in the United States, Navratilova first lived with former Vaudeville actress, Frances Dewey Wormser, and her husband, Morton Wormser, a tennis enthusiast.[14]\n\nNavratilova was the runner-up at two major singles tournaments in 1975. She lost in the final of the Australian Open to Evonne Goolagong Cawley and in the final of the French Open to Chris Evert. After losing to Evert in the semifinals of that year's US Open, the 18-year-old Navratilova went to the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York City and informed them that she wished to defect from Communist Czechoslovakia. Within a month, she received a green card and in 1981 became a US citizen.[4] Also, in 1975, Navratilova teamed with then world number one, Chris Evert, to win the French Open women's doubles title, Martina's first major title. They teamed again in 1976 to win the women's Wimbledon doubles title over Billie Jean King and Bette Stove.\n\nNavratilova won her first major singles title at Wimbledon in 1978, where she defeated Evert in three sets in the final and captured the World No. 1 ranking for the first time, although Evert maintained the number one ranking at the end of 1978. She successfully defended her Wimbledon title in 1979, again beating Evert in the final, and earned the World No. 1 ranking at the end of the year for the first time. Just before Wimbledon in 1979, Navratilova and Evert played possibly the highest scoring women's professional match ever in the Eastbourne final, which Evert won 7-5, 5-7, 13-11. In April 1981, Evert whipped Navratilova in the finals of the Women's Tennis Association championships, 6-0, 6-0. It was Navratilova's only professional double bagel loss. It was at this point that Navratilova began working with Nancy Lieberman to improve her fitness to better compete with Evert. In 1981, Navratilova won her third major singles title by defeating Evert in the final of the Australian Open. Navratilova also reached the final of the US Open, where she lost a third set tiebreak to Tracy Austin. Navratilova won both Wimbledon and the French Open in 1982.\n\nAfter adopting basketball player Nancy Lieberman's exercise plan and using Yonex isometric midsize graphite racquets, Navratilova became the most dominant player in women's tennis. Interestingly, she initially argued against the legalization of such \"giant\" racquets, saying that they made the game too easy. After losing in the fourth round of the first major event of 1983, the French Open, she captured the year's three remaining major titles (the Australian Open was held in December at that time). Navratilova's loss at the French Open was her only singles defeat during that year, during which she established an 86–1 record. Her winning percentage was the best ever for a post-1968 professional tennis player. During 1982, 1983, and 1984, Navratilova lost a total of only six singles matches.[citation needed]\n\nNavratilova won the 1984 French Open, thus holding all four major singles titles simultaneously. Her accomplishment was declared a \"Grand Slam\" by Philippe Chatrier, president of theInternational Tennis Federation. Some tennis observers, however, countered that it was not a true slam because the titles had not been won in a single calendar year. Navratilova extended her major singles tournament winning streak to a record-equalling six following wins at Wimbledon and the US Open. She entered the 1984 Australian Open with a chance of winning all four titles in the same year. In the semifinals, however, Helena Suková ended Navratilova's 74-match winning streak (a record for a professional) 1–6, 6–3, 7–5.[citation needed]\n\nA left-hander, Navratilova completed a calendar grand slam in women's doubles in 1984, partnering with right-handed Pam Shriver, a tall and talented player whose most noted stroke was a slice forehand, a shot virtually unheard of in the game today. This was part of a record 109-match winning streak that the pair achieved between 1983 and 1985. (Navratilova was ranked the World No. 1 doubles player for a period of over three years in the 1980s.) From 1985 through 1987, Navratilova reached the women's singles final at all 11 major tournaments held during those three years, winning six of them. From 1982 through 1990, she reached the Wimbledon final nine consecutive times. She reached the US Open final five consecutive times from 1983 through 1987 and appeared in the French Open final five out of six years from 1982 through 1987.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Navratilova played in what many consider to be the best woman's match of all time, the French Open final against Chris Evert. Navratilova battled back from 3-6, 2-4 down to 5-5 all in the third set, before Evert hit a winning backhand passing shot on match point to defeat Navratilova 6-3, 6-7(4), 7-5. This was a major turnaround for Evert, who was so outmatched the year earlier in the final that Bud Collins remarked as a TV commentator that the sport needed to create a higher league for Navratilova to compete in. Racquet technology may have had a significant impact, as only the losing player in both matches used a racquet with power-dissipating fiberglass in it. In outdoor matches against Evert, Navratilova was up 10 - 5 on grass and 8 - 7 on hardcourts. But, Evert was up 11 - 3 on clay and 23 to 21 overall in outdoor matches.\n\n17-year old German player Steffi Graf emerged on the scene in 1987 when she beat Navratilova in the final of the French Open. Navratilova defeated Graf in the 1987 Wimbledon and US Open finals (and at the US Open became only the third player in the open era to win the women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles at the same event). Graf's consistent play throughout 1987, however, allowed her to obtain the World No. 1 ranking before the end of the year. Graf eventually broke Navratilova's records of 156 consecutive weeks and 331 total weeks as the World No. 1 singles player but did not break Navratilova's record 167 singles titles, as Graf reached 107. In terms of doubles, Navratilova won 177 women's doubles titles and 15 mixed titles to Graf's 11 and 0, respectively. In 1988, Graf won all four major singles titles, beating Navratilova 5–7, 6–2, 6–1 in the Wimbledon final along the way.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1989, Graf and Navratilova met in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open, with Graf winning both encounters in three sets. Despite the age difference between the two players, and Graf's comparative lack of investment in doubles and mixed doubles, Navratilova won 9 of the 18 career singles matches with Graf and 5 of the 9 major singles matches with her. At age 34, Navratilova defeated Graf the last time they played in a major in the semifinals of the 1991 US Open 7–6(2), 6–7(6), 6–4.\n\n[2][3]Navratilova and Sukova playing doubles\n\nNavratilova's final major singles triumph was in 1990. In the final, the 33-year old Navratilova swept Zina Garrison 6–4, 6–1 to claim a record-breaking ninth Wimbledon singles crown. Though that was her last major singles title, Navratilova reached two additional major singles finals during the remainder of career. In 1991, she lost in the US Open final to the new World No. 1 Monica Seles after defeating Graf in a semifinal. And then in 1994, at the age of 37, Navratilova reached the Wimbledon final, where she lost in three sets to Conchita Martínez. Soon after, she retired from full-time competition on the singles tour. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nIn 2000, Navratilova returned to the tour to play doubles events, while rarely playing singles. In her first singles performance in eight years, at Eastbourne in 2002, she beat World No. 22 Tatiana Panova before losing in the next round to Daniela Hantuchová in three sets. In 2003, she won the mixed doubles titles at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, partnering Leander Paes. This made her the oldest ever major champion (aged 46 years, 8 months). The Australian Open victory made her the third player in history to complete a \"boxed set\" of major titles by winning the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles at all four majors. The Wimbledon win allowed her to equal Billie Jean King's record of 20 Wimbledon titles (in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles combined) and extended her overall number of major titles to 58 (second only to Margaret Court, who won 62). Despite being criticized for receiving a wildcard, Navratilova won a singles match over Catalina Castaño 6-0 6-1 at the first round of Wimbledon in 2004, aged 47 years and eight months, to make her the oldest player to win a professional singles match in the open era. She then lost her second round match with Gisela Dulko in three sets.\n\nOn July 6, 2006, Navratilova played her last career match at Wimbledon, losing in the third round of mixed doubles to the eventual champions, Israel's Andy Ram and Russia's Vera Zvonareva. Earlier that day, Navratilova lost her women's doubles quarterfinal match against Chinese fourth seeds Yan Zi and Zheng Jie, also the eventual champions. Navratilova capped off her career by winning the mixed doubles title at the 2006 US Open with Bob Bryan, her 41st major doubles title (31 in women's doubles and 10 in mixed doubles) and 177th overall. At the time, she was just over a month away from her 50th birthday.\n\nNavratilova won 167 top-level singles titles (more than any other player in the open era) and 177 doubles titles. Her last title in women's doubles came on August 21, 2006, at the Tier I Rogers Cupin Montreal, Canada, where she partnered Nadia Petrova. Navratilova won 18 major singles titles: nine at Wimbledon, four at the US Open, three at the Australian Open, and two at the French Open. Her overall record in 67 major singles events was 306–49 .862 (120–14 at Wimbledon, 89–17 at the US Open, 51–11 at the French Open, and 46–7 at the Australian Open). Some observers argue that the very few singles matches she played in her forties should be counted separately in her career statistics. She won at least one tour event for 21 consecutive years and won the singles and doubles at the same event a record 84 times. Her career singles match win total of 1,442 is the most during the open era.[citation needed]\n\nIn September 1992, the 35-year old Navratilova played Jimmy Connors in the third Battle of the Sexes tennis match at Caesars Palace in Paradise, Nevada. Connors was allowed only one serve per point and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7–5, 6–2.[15] She played for the Boston Lobsters in the World TeamTennis pro league through the 2009 season.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life[edit][]\n\nIn 1981, shortly after becoming a United States citizen, Navratilova came out publicly about her sexual orientation through a column written by Skip Bayless. During the early 1980s, she was involved with author Rita Mae Brown. From 1984 to 1991, Navratilova had a long-term relationship with Judy Nelson. Their split in 1991 included a much-publicized legal wrangle. Navratilova was featured in a WITA (Women's International Tennis Association) calendar, shot by Jean Renard with her Wimbledon trophies and Nelson's children in the background.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Navratilova released an autobiography, co-written with The New York Times sports columnist George Vecsey, titled Martina in the U.S. and Being Myself in the rest of the world.[16] She had earlier co-written a tennis instruction book with Mary Carillo in 1982, entitled Tennis My Way.[17] She later wrote three mystery novels with Liz Nickles: The Total Zone (1994),[18] Breaking Point (1996),[19] and Killer Instinct (1997).[20] Navratilova's most recent literary effort was a health and fitness book entitled Shape Your Self, which came out in 2006.[21]\n\nOn April 7, 2010, Navratilova announced that she was being treated for breast cancer.[22] A routine mammogram in January 2010 revealed that she had a ductal carcinoma in situ in her left breast, which she was informed of on February 24, and in March she had the tumour surgically removed;[23] she received radiation therapy in May.[22]\n\nIn December 2010, Navratilova was hospitalized after developing high altitude pulmonary edema while attempting a climb of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.[24]\n\nActivism and politics[edit][]\n\n[4][5]Navratilova and Mark Tewksburyread the Declaration of Montreal at the opening ceremonies of the World Outgames.\n\nWhen not playing tennis, Navratilova is involved with various charities that benefit animal rights, underprivileged children, and gay rights. She participated in a lawsuit against Amendment 2, a 1992 ballot proposition in Colorado designed to deny gays and lesbians legal protection from discrimination.[25] In 1993, she spoke before the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation.[26]\n\nIn 2000, she was the recipient of National Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian activist/lobbying group.[27]\n\nA vegetarian, Navratilova appeared in ad campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In an April 2006 interview, however, she said she had recently begun eating fish again because she found it hard to get enough protein while on the road;[28] which would make her a pescetarian rather than a vegetarian; nevertheless in 2008 she described herself as vegetarian.[29]\n\n[6][7]Navratilova in September 2011\n\nShe has spoken out on a number of volatile political issues, including tort/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme—aside from gay and lesbian rights—has been her unstinting opposition to Communism, and unrelenting opposition to the former Eastern Bloc power structure that she believes compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's former hegemony over Eastern Europe.\n\n\"Whenever people go into politics and they try to say that Communism was a good thing, I say, 'Go ahead and live in a Communist country then, if you think it's so great.' \"[28]\n\nNavratilova was a guest on CNN's Connie Chung Tonight show on July 17, 2002. During the show, Chung quoted a German newspaper which quoted Navratilova as saying: \"The most absurd part of my escape from the unjust system is that I have exchanged one system that suppresses free opinion for another. The Republicans in the U.S. manipulate public opinion and sweep controversial issues under the table. It's depressing. Decisions in America are based solely on the question of how much money will come out of it and not on the questions of how much health, morals or environment suffer as a result.\"[30]\n\nNavratilova said that the remarks referred to what she perceived as a trend of centralization of government power and a loss of personal freedom. In the discussion that followed, Chung stated: \"Can I be honest with you? I can tell you that when I read this, I have to tell you that I thought it was un-American, unpatriotic. I wanted to say, go back to Czechoslovakia. You know, if you don't like it here, this a country that gave you so much, gave you the freedom to do what you want.\"[30]\n\nNavratilova responded, \"And I'm giving it back. This is why I speak out. When I see something that I don't like, I'm going to speak out because you can do that here. And again, I feel there are too many things happening that are taking our rights away.\"[30]\n\nMartina was quoted in 2007 as being ashamed of the US under President George W. Bush because unlike the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Bush was elected.[31][32]\n\nCareer statistics[edit][]\n\nMain article: Martina Navratilova career statistics===Records[edit]===\n\nThese are Open Era tennis records.\n\nRecords in bold indicate peer-less achievements.\n\n[show]Time span Selected Grand Slam tournament records Players matched\n\n[show]Grand Slam tournaments Time Span Records at each Grand Slam tournament Players matched\n\n[show]Time span Other selected records Players matched\n\nAwards[edit][]\n\nITF World Champion 1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986.\n\nWTA Player of the Year 1978, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986.\n\nRecognition[edit][]\n\nTennis magazine selected her as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1965 through 2005.[35] Tennis historian and journalist Bud Collins has called Navratilova \"arguably, the greatest player of all time.\"[36]\n\nTennis writer Steve Flink, in his book The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century, named her as the second best female player of the 20th century, directly behind Steffi Graf.[37]\n\nIn June 2011, she was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by Time.[38]\n\nIn March 2012, The Tennis Channel named Navratilova as the second greatest female tennis player of all times, behind Steffi Graf, in their list of 100 greatest tennis players of all times.[39]\n\nOn August 2, 2013, Navratilova was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.[40]\n\nMedia[edit][]"
