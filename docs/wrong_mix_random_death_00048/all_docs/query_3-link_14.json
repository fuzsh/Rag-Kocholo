        "text": "Martina Navratilova was born in 1956 in Prague, in the then Czechoslovakia. In 1975 she defected to the US to pursue her tennis career. She was ranked world number one for seven years and won the Wimbledon singles title a record-breaking nine times. She retired after winning the mixed doubles at the 2006 US Open. She is covering this year's Wimbledon, which starts on Monday, for the Tennis Channel.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nDying, of course.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nCutting my hair at about two years old.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nA great friend who at 65 has untreatable leukaemia - her positive attitude as well as her wisdom are a work of art.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nBeing too trusting.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nLying.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nMy skirt falling down during one Wimbledon final.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nA locket with my mother's hair.\n\nWhere would you like to live?\n\nKenya.\n\nWhat makes you unhappy?\n\nHuman or animal misery.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nSabre-toothed tiger, but I will settle for keeping what we have and not losing any more.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nRipe mangoes.\n\nWhat is your favourite book?\n\nThe Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand.\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nAnjelica Huston or Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nReading a newspaper in the presence of others.\n\nWhat would be your fancy dress costume of choice?\n\nAlexander the Great.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone's said to you?\n\nMy sister telling me our mom died.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nMy mother and sister for having left them when I defected, and a friend in Philadelphia for abandoning her.\n\nWhat was the best kiss of your life?\n\nSummer of 2008.\n\nWhich living person do you most despise?\n\nDick Cheney.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\n\"Wow\", \"Ridiculous\", \"Dammit\".\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nThe direction my country took in 2000-2008. Compare that with Monica Lewinsky... I mean, really!\n\nIf you could edit your past, what would you change?\n\nHaving to leave my family behind.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\nTo see what Earth looked like prior to human habitation.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nDuring this interview.\n\nWhat is the closest you've come to death?\n\nNearly drowning at nine.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nFinding my soul mate.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nMenopause.\n\nTell us a secret\n\nThelma and Louise live!!!"
