        "text": "Judy Woodruff:\n\nAs the U.S. Open tennis tournament continues this week in New York, we turn to a conversation Amna Nawaz had there with tennis legend Chris Evert.\n\nEvert's win-loss record and singles matches is the best of any pro player, male or female, in history. But perhaps her toughest match is taking on ovarian cancer, often known as the silent killer.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nSeven French Open titles, 18 major championships in all. Became the first player, male or female, to win 1,000 singles matches. And to this day, holds the record for the second most career wins, behind Martina Navratilova.\n\nEvert grew up in a tennis family in Florida. Her dad taught all the kids to play on public courts. Now 67 and herself the mother of three sons, Evert spent most of her life in the white-hot spotlight. She became known for her tough, seemingly unemotional outer shell. But nothing, she says, could have prepared her for the loss of her sister, Jeanne Evert Dubin, who played on the tour with Chris for a while.\n\nJeanne's ovarian cancer was detected late. She lived for two more years and died in 2020. Jeanne had tested negative for the harmful variant of the BRCA1 gene, but her blood was stored in a lab, in case knowledge or data of new variants became available and as genetic testing evolved.\n\nTwo years after her death, Jeanne's blood tested BRCA-positive, a warning bell for possible ovarian or breast cancer predisposition in the family. A call from her doctor took Chris Evert's life down an unexpected path, ovarian cancer, but caught early, stage 1C.\n\nToday, Evert is back courtside as a commentator for ESPN, coaching and mentoring the next generation. We talked about her journey, her health, and what's ahead.\n\nIt's been three months since you finished your chemotherapy. How are you feeling today?\n\nChris Evert:\n\nAndy, my former husband, took me to all six chemos. And he was really supportive.\n\nI had a little nausea and fatigue, not tiredness, but fatigue is a different feeling. I had that for like five days, and then I would have two weeks of feeling OK. And I could go to my tennis academy and coach, and I could do pretty much normal things. So, I feel very lucky.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nThe geneticist called and said, we retested Jeanne's blood and another variant has come up, and now she's BRCA-positive. So you're going to have to take the BRCA test.\n\nAnd so all of our siblings took it. I went the next day and took the BRCA test and 10 days later discovered that I was positive. I went to the doctor. He said: \"OK, you have to have a hysterectomy. You don't need the reproductive organs. So, the best thing, the safest thing is just to get everything out.\"\n\nI encourage anybody, any woman not to be afraid of having a hysterectomy. But what happened was surprising after that. My doctor called me three days later and said: \"We are really shocked about this, but our findings are that you had ovarian cancer and you had cancer in your fallopian tubes.\"\n\nAnd I was like, whoa. But I didn't feel anything. And that's why this is an insidious, ugly cancer, because you don't feel any effects whatsoever. And many times when women are diagnosed, they're already in stage four.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nNo. I don't think you ever feel that way. She was like the wind beneath my wings, that song.\n\nAnd she was so proud of me, and supportive of me, and never envious or jealous. She was just a wonderful sister. And I wish I could I could have told her more. But, sometimes, when somebody is really sick, that's not the time to tell them, because then they start to feel worse. They know it's the end.\n\nBut I think she knows. I mean, I talked to her every day, and I think she knows that now.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nOh, my God. I'm sorry. I talk about this so much. And I have never cried like this.\n\nBut I just can't believe how strong she was, and that she never complained. And she had ports, and she had incisions all over her body. And she was down to 80 pounds. And I saw her go through this. And she would either be quiet or she tried to muster up a smile.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nSure.\n\nLook, when I grew up and started playing on the tour, I was 15 years old. And the more I read that, the more I got to be that way. I never had the freedom, I think, to develop on my own terms, because I always had the press saying I was somebody else.\n\nWhen I look at the young women today on the court, I see they have come a long way. They're fearless. They're emotional. They have a lot of power .They feel the power. They have a lot of respect.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nI grew up in the '60s, played in the '70s. They were taboo subjects. You didn't talk about it. You didn't talk about being gay. And you didn't talk about controversial subjects at all.\n\nThat was the way the society was, the culture was here in America, maybe here in the world. But now women are just owning themselves. And they're empowering themselves. And we're reaching more and more equality with the men.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nI have so many ways of being involved in the game. I mean, I love telling people of me being on center court in the finals, what it feels like, what the pressure feels like. I mean, I love that.\n\nI think what I love even more is the mentoring part. I'm very involved with the USTA Foundation, which is all about under-resourced kids combining tennis and education, and giving them a safe place to go to after school, talking to them, mentoring them, seeing the joy on their face.\n\nAn extension further, I have my own tennis academy with my brother."
