        "text": "4.5K\n\nThis season of The Real Housewives of Miami will go down as one of the most dramatic ever.\n\nThe reunion is coming up soon, and fans can’t wait to see what issues get resolved. Much of the drama this season has been between Guerdy Abraira and Larsa Pippen, but it’s unclear if they can fix things. Now, Julia Lemigova is talking about the reunion and giving a hint about who we’ll see go at it.\n\nAs fans know, they filmed the RHOM reunion in New York last month.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, Julia had a few tidbits about the season six reunion while at a Clive Davis pre-Grammy party.\n\nSome may wonder why Julia would be at a pre-Grammys party. As it turns out, Clive is a very close friend of Julia, and this was her second year attending.\n\nJulia said, “I think we kind of know that Guerdy and Larsa kind of had it from the beginning, and so I think probably it will be the natural thing, I would say.”\n\nThe RHOM star then said, “The reunion will be spicy.”\n\nLike RHOSLC, the reunion will have three parts. They will begin airing on March 9, and the final one will grace our screens on March 23.\n\nJulia also provided a health update from her wife while on the red carpet. Her wife, Martina Navratilova, had a battle with throat and breast cancer. Luckily, she is now cancer-free.\n\nAs many fans know, Martina is also a tennis legend.\n\nJulia had this to say about her wife’s health, “She’s doing fantastic, terrific actually. Serena [Williams] just asked that question, and she is doing great; she is doing better than ever. She’s a champion; like, she’s my GOAT. I mean, I have 20 GOATs back at home; she might be a GOAT.”"
