Early morning on 17 April 1790, Benjamin Franklin died at his home in Philadelphia. Almost a generation older than most of America’s founders, he was the first to inspire a national, and indeed international, period of mourning. In arranging Franklin’s memorial, his own and Craven Street family set in place lasting ideas on remembrance and identity. Dr. Boudreau is a cultural historian focused on 18th century Anglo-America.
