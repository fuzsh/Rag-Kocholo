It is computed that no less than 20,000 attended and witnessed the funeral,” Philadelphia’s Federal Gazette reported on April 22, 1790.\n\nThis number is remarkable when compared to the city’s population of 28,000. More than 70% of Philadelphia attended Franklin’s funeral.\n\n“The order and silence which prevailed, during the procession, deeply evinced the heartfelt sense, entertained by all classes of citizens, of the unparalleled virtues, talents and service of the deceased.”\n\nThe pallbearers were the president of the state, the chief Justice of Pennsylvania, and other leaders.\n\n“All the clergy of this city, including the ministers of the Hebrew Congregation, (walked) before the corpse.”\n\nRead the full article as originally published at Genealogybank.com"
