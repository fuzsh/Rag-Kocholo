        "text": "Wednesday April 17 2019, 5.30pm\n\nEarly morning on 17 April 1790, Benjamin Franklin died at his home in Philadelphia. Almost a generation older than most of America’s founders, he was the first to inspire a national, and indeed international, period of mourning. In arranging Franklin’s memorial, his own and Craven Street family set in place lasting ideas on remembrance and identity. Dr. Boudreau is a cultural historian focused on 18th century Anglo-America. His his Benjamin Franklin teacher workshops have received numerous grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and he holds a 2019 post-doctoral fellowship at the George Washington Library at Mount Vernon. He is author of Independence: A Guide to Historic Philadelphia (2012)."
