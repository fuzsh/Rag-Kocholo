        "text": "‘You know my house … you will be most heartily welcome,’ Dr. Benjamin Franklin once said.\n\nIn a low-facade building tucked away in Philadelphia’s Independence National Historical Park between Market and Chestnut streets at Third and Fourth streets – surrounded by the Fox 29 building, the National Liberty Museum and The Bourse – the Benjamin Franklin Museum recently received some snazzy upgrades, giving visitors a deeper appreciation of the life and legacy of the famous American Founding Father, statesman, inventor and 18th century renaissance man.\n\n‘We completely revitalized it,’ said Independence National Historical Park ranger Jane Cowley. ‘The exhibits are designed … to reflect Benjamin Franklin’s personality. People walk away feeling like they know Benjamin Franklin. I learned so much when we (reopened) this museum.’\n\nYou’ll know you’re there when you see the ‘Ghost House,’ a three-dimensional, outline of where Franklin’s three-story Philadelphia home once stood, and a similar frame of the former site of the printers office run by Franklin’s grandson, Benjamin Franklin Bache.\n\nThe new-look Benjamin Franklin Museum is educational, and yet kid-friendly. The museum’s cartoon mascot, Skuggs (what Franklin’s contemporaries called pet squirrels), offers clues for families exploring the museum on a path of curiosity, the path of a hard worker, or the path of a team player.\n\nAmusing short animated films placed throughout the museum highlight lesser-known parts of Franklin’s life – like his struggles with gout, brought on by overindulging in food, wine and chess (which encouraged a sedentary lifestyle). Another brings to life an anecdote from a 1776 letter by future-President John Adams on how a late night argument with Franklin over whether or not to leave the window open overnight in a New Jersey tavern room, where the two stayed while traveling, ended up lulling Adams to sleep. Adams, like most people of those times, ‘feared the night air,’ while Franklin hypothesized that ventilation was the healthier choice.\n\nDid you know that Ben Franklin tried becoming a vegetarian? That’s one of the interesting nuggets in a theater-style video presentation on Franklin’s autobiography, which imagines that you’re sitting in his library as he’s writing it.\n\nAnother interactive element is touch matching games that introduce you to Franklin’s philosophy, his many inventions and more. When you successfully complete a game, a voice exclaims ‘huzzah!’ – the period word for ‘hooray.’\n\n‘You’ll hear a lot of huzzahs,’ commented Cowley.\n\nThe museum also features personal relics from Franklin’s life, such as a sedan chair that he used to get to Congressional sessions in the last years of his life, portrait paintings, chairs and a chess set, bowls and ceramic items from the Franklin kitchen, and a family Bible. Cowley noted that some artifacts are on loan, so it’s a good idea to make return visits to see if there’s anything new.\n\nThe rooms are divided into Franklin sayings, such as ‘What good have I done today?’ – the area marked with little fire buckets – which points out his role in creating the University of Pennsylvania, and America’s first fire department, lending library, hospital and post office.\n\nAnother – ‘A thirst for knowledge’ – reflects Franklin’s creative and scientific mind. It’s decorated with little kites in honor of his celebrated kite flying in a lighting storm. The experiment led to the invention of the first batteries, which stored static electricity in Leyden jars.\n\nOne video interactive dedicated to Franklin’s maritime innovations credits him with the idea of water propulsion from pressurized water and air. ‘ … So Franklin invented the jet ski,’ Cowley quipped.\n\nAccording to one museum panel, Franklin never patented any of his inventions, which included swim fins, the odometer, the Franklin stove and the glass armonica (a musical instrument that you can virtually play thanks to one of the interactives). ‘We should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours,’ Franklin wrote.\n\nThere’s a section dedicated to Franklin’s printing career, which led to the publishing of ‘Poor Richard’s Almanack,’ and his newspaper, ‘The Pennsylvania Gazette.’ His successes in business allowed him to retire at the age of 42.\n\nAnother video interactive station offers a first-hand point of view of the difficulty of historical interpretation. Presenting conflicting facts regarding Franklin’s views on slavery, it asks you to decide for yourself whether the deep-thinking Franklin supported slavery or changed his mind about it.\n\nPoints of interestOther Franklin-related sites within Independence National Historical Park include:\n\n? Ben Franklin’s print shop, a short walk across Franklin Court from the museum.\n\n? Franklin Post Office & Museum, 316 Market St., is an active U.S. post office, and has displays of postal history and memorabilia on the second floor.\n\n? Christ Church, 22-26 N. Second St., is where Franklin’s wife, Deborah, attended services. The couple is buried in the church’s burial ground.\n\n? The American Philosophical Society, 105 S. Fifth St., was founded by Franklin.\n\n? Carpenter’s Hall, 320 Chestnut St., is where Franklin’s public lending library was located. It was also the site of the first Constitutional Convention."
