        "text": "In the 1990s, Philadelphia nearly spent a bunch of Benjamin Franklin’s money to put on an Aretha Franklin concert. Yes, really.\n\nWe can start tracking this chain, chain, chain of events with an advertisement in the 1791 Pennsylvania Gazette.\n\nThe “advertisement” is a notice about Franklin’s last will and testament.\n\nHe had died the prior year, in 1790.\n\nEver the innovator, Franklin left an unusual set of instructions in his will.\n\nIn the codicil, Franklin bequeathed 1,000 pounds sterling (roughly four grand) each to Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nFranklin was born in Boston and lived most of his adult life in Philadelphia.\n\nHe hoped to help the people of both cities after he died.\n\nBut Franklin didn’t just *give* each city 1,000 pounds.\n\nThe money would be loaned at low interest to young, married tradesmen (yes, all men). In his will, Franklin wrote: “ I wish to be useful even after my death, if possible, in forming and advancing other young men.”\n\nFranklin felt he was paying it forward. His career as a printer began thanks to loans from a pair of friends.\n\nBut this arrangement would serve a second purpose. The interest paid on the loans would help grow his original gift.\n\nTo prevent Boston or Philadelphia from raiding the piggy bank, Franklin put limits on the money.\n\nNone of it could be spent until 100 years had passed. And *most* of the money had to remain in trust until 200 years after his death.\n\nThen, after two centuries, it *had* to be spent.\n\nThat 200-year anniversary arrived in 1990 — at which point Franklin’s original investment was worth millions.\n\nPhiladelphia’s portion was worth about $2 million.\n\nBoston, thanks to different management, had about $4.5 million.\n\nPer Franklin’s instructions, the money had to be split between the governments of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. That left Philly with about $520,000 to spend.\n\nNo surprise, this inspired quite a bit of debate.\n\nAt first, a city official told Inquirer journalist Tom Ferrick Jr. that Franklin’s money would be used to subsidize a pair of festivals, one called the Festival of Firsts and another called the Freedom Festival.\n\nThe city was basically broke, so officials figured they could use Franklin’s money to plug the budgetary hole *and* honor Franklin.\n\nTo make it fit better, they proposed inviting BEN Vereen and Aretha FRANKLIN to perform.\n\nMany in the public…did not care for this plan.\n\nSome felt it contradicted the spirit of Ben Franklin’s will, which mentioned investment in public works. (Franklin himself speculated that the money might be used to build pipes from Wissahickon Creek.)\n\nAfter the concert debacle, Mayor Wilson Goode convened a panel of scholars to help decide how the money should be used.\n\nSuggestions flowed in.\n\nOne proposed housing for homeless youth. Another suggested a garden. Apparently there was even a proposal centered on smoke alarms.\n\nUltimately, the city decided on a plan rather similar to Franklin’s original idea: The money was used to fund scholarships for young people learning a craft or trade.\n\nSome of the money was used to fund the Franklin Institute — on the Ben Franklin Parkway.\n\nIn Boston, the will’s funds led to the establishment of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology.\n\nAt every turn, there was debate.\n\nPerhaps that’s fitting.\n\nBen Franklin himself was no stranger to vigorous arguments, be they over a new constitution — or how to spend a few bucks."
