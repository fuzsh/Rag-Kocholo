        "text": "Henry Hill (1732 —1798) was a merchant, politician and Revolutionary War Colonel who became extraordinarily wealthy outsmarting British tariffs by importing Madeira wine.\n\nBorn on his father’s tobacco plantation in Annapolis, MD, Hill’s Point, Henry Hill was the second son of Quakers Deborah Moore Hill and Dr. Richard Hill, a physician.\n\nWhen Dr. Hill and his wife had to leave the colonies and their plantation due to financial difficulties and the harsh penalties for owing creditors, the family dispersed.\n\nHenry and seven of his siblings moved to Philadelphia to be raised by their older sister Hannah and her husband Dr. Samuel Preston Moore. And his two older sisters, Harriet and Mary, accompanied their parents to Madeira, Portugal.\n\nHenry wrote about this separation in a letter he wrote his parents around Christmas of 1742, “…My brother Moore [Hannah’s husband] tells me I must mind the books that I may be a Dr. and I am very willing and wou’d go to Scotland to school or anywhere else where I may be able to know how to be a Doctor like my papa.”\n\nHenry did travel to Scotland for school and from there he wrote his father again, in the Fall of 1746, “I desire of seeing you more until I have done with the schools here…” and hope that “I might come home well educated…after all the expence and Pains that has taken’d upon me.”\n\nAfter seven years in Scotland including one year at Edinburgh College, Dr. Hill reached out and asked Henry and another son to join him in his new, thriving Madeira wine business.\n\nDr. Hill had recovered the fortune he’d lost in Maryland, but he needed help managing his expanding wine export operation and its offices in Madeira and London.\n\nAlong with his father, Henry’s mother Deborah welcomed him to the island in 1751. She was overjoyed to see her 19 year-old son after so many years, and Henry remained in Madeira for most of the remaining decade.\n\nBut sadly during his years in Madeira, Henry’s mother and his only brother passed away, leaving Henry as his father’s sole surviving son.\n\nAs early as 1752, Henry’s father had expressed concern that his son needed to find a wife. After he had died, his sisters took up the cause of finding their brother a suitable partner, preferably Quaker.\n\nBut Hill’s business responsibilities took over and it was not until 1772, at the late age of 40, that Hill finally met someone he wanted to marry: Ann Meredith, the daughter of Reese and Martha Carpenter Meredith.\n\nAnn’s father, Reese Meredith, was a rich Quaker merchant, who had made his fortune in real estate and shipping, further enhancing Hill social connections. Meredith had also known Hill’s father and been helpful to him during his financial difficulties in the 1730’s.\n\nThough both Ann and Henry were Quakers, the couple opted to be married at the socially more connected Christ Church. Although Ann wound up inevitably being disowned by her Quaker Meeting group when she married, she had followed the path of both of her siblings who had also left the Society of Friends.\n\nHill’s marriage connected him with two successful and socially prominent brothers-in-law.\n\nAnn’s sister Elizabeth Meredith was married to George Clymer, a future signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, donor to the war effort, and captain of the Third Battalion of Associators, a volunteer military association comprised of upper-class Philadelphians.\n\nIn 1789, Clymer was elected to the first U.S. Congress and later, he served in many public roles until his death in 1813, including as Trustee of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnn’s brother Samuel Meredith who had married Margaret Cadwalader, was a partner in Ann’s father Reese Meredith’s extensive merchant and land speculation business, as was George Clymer.\n\nSamuel also served three terms in the Pennsylvania Assembly, was a delegate to the Continental Congress, and was a Brigadier General of the Third Battalion of Associators, serving in four major battles. After the war, at his friend George Washington’s request, Samuel Meredith also served as first Treasurer of the United States.\n\nHenry Hill continued to remain on the political stage and in the limelight. Hill was asked to serve on the Board of Directors of the Bank of North America (1781-1792), to which he had been a founding subscriber and donor.\n\nDuring this period, Hill also continued to serve as a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly, and the Executive Council (1785-1788).\n\nIn 1783, together with Benjamin Rush, William Bingham, and others, Hill became a founding trustee of Dickinson College, the first college chartered after the formation of our new nation.\n\nThe college is named after Quaker John Dickinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and later governor of Pennsylvania, and his wife Mary Norris Dickinson, whose extensive personal libraries were given to the college.\n\nIn 1790, Henry’s close friend Benjamin Franklin died and Hill was named one of four executors of his will. The will provided for some endearing gifts, including one for Henry Hill: a silver cream pot with the motto, “keep bright the chain.”\n\nTragically, three years earlier, on December 11, 1787, Henry’s wife Ann Hill had died of a “tedious and painful illness”, likely grand mal seizures or epilepsy which her father had also suffered from.\n\nAnn died in the house we know today as Hill-Physick, which she had helped plan, design and pay for with her inheritance from her father’s estate. The house was still only partially finished, so Ann never got to enjoy the house in its final form.\n\nTen months before she died, Ann wrote a letter to her husband outlining the charities she wanted her estate to donate to: the poor of Philadelphia, the public school in Germantown, and to her sister-in-law Mrs. Patsy Moore for “promoting her plan of Female Education.”\n\nEleven years later, Henry Hill died in the lesser known Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1798. 1,200 people would die along with Hill, who stayed in his house on Fourth Street even after two of his servants had died. He only called on his friend Dr. Benjamin Rush near the end, but refused treatment, despite a visit by his concerned sister.\n\nSadly, virtually all of the free-standing houses in Society Hill from the colonial era have been torn down. Happily, the Hill-Physick House still stands, the only free-standing house remaining from in Society Hill from that time period.\n\nInnovative Medical Inventions. Dr. Physick was known both for his skills and decisiveness in the operating room, but also in the mechanics of the art and for the innovative surgical tools he invented. These included the stomach pump, curved needle forceps, absorbent catgut sutures, third molar forceps for tooth extraction, and the guillotine/snare for performing tonsillectomies.\n\nContributions to Orthopedics and Urology. Dr. Physick also made improvements in the field of orthopedics — splints and traction devices for skeletal dislocations, including for thighs, and for displacement of the foot (‘Pott’s fracture.’) Many of the devices Dr. Physick created and/or enhanced remain in use today.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Physick played a significant role in the developing field of urology. He devised numerous urological procedures and instruments which included clamps and tubes for removing kidney stones. He was unequal in his skill in lithotomy and one of his last operations was the removal of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall’s kidney stones.\n\nBlood Transfusions. A footnote in the “Philadelphia Journal for the Medical and Physical Sciences” in 1825 credited Dr. Physick as the first person to complete a blood transfusion; though there is not any case history to substantiate this claim. However, this idea may have been introduced to him at the University of Edinburgh, where Dr. James Blundell, the first published account of a successful transfusion, also attended.\n\nAnother first. Early in his career, in an attempt to build his practice, Dr. Physick offered the first healthcare insurance package in the country. He advertised that he could take care of an entire family for a year for $20.\n\nMagnanimous Fee Policies. Throughout his career, though he did make a sizable income, Dr. Physick always asked his patients about their financial circumstances, often taking payment in trade or reduced fees if the patient was of limited income. He never accepted payment from clergy or officers in the Army or Navy.\n\nA Maryland Summer Residence. In 1833, Dr. Physick acquired a summer house called Octorara Farm in Cecil County, Maryland to escape the hot Philadelphia summers.\n\nSituated on a hill with commanding views of the Susquehanna River, the property included 201 acres and a Greek Revival house built in 1775 which included numerous outbuildings. Dr. Physick added significantly to the size of the house, as he loved spending time there with his two daughters and their families.\n\nDeath. Sadly, after just four summers of enjoyment at his new property, Dr. Physick died on December 13, 1837. The cause was described as ‘hydrothorax’, possibly emphysema.\n\nHis funeral was held in his Philadelphia house, as was the custom then. After a reception, the coffin was carried up 4th street to Church Christ burial ground. There were hundreds of mourners following behind: faculty members and trustees, his past students, fellow members of all his various societies and organizations and many friends and patients.\n\nHis Will Provided for his Children. Dr. Physick’s will divided his estate into equal shares for his son and two daughters. He bequeathed Octorara Farm to his daughter Susan Physick Conner, the wife of Commodore David Conner, US Navy.\n\nTo his daughter Sally Physick Randolph, who had married Dr. Jacob Randolph, he gave the house on 321 South Fourth, now called the Hill-Physick House.\n\nDr. Physick’s son Philip Syng Physick Jr. took his share of the inheritance in significant monies, stock and other valuables and built a house at 1901 Walnut Street, a large marble and stucco mansion which became known as ‘Physick’s Folly’.\n\nHe Also Provided for his Staff. Dr. Physick provided generously for two servants, his housekeeper Anna Marie Shields and another servant Rhoda Poynter. These women played a significant part of his daily life, as he described them in his will as having “so long lived in the utmost kindness and harmony.”\n\nIn his will, Dr. Physick directed his son to provide $2,500 to buy them a suitable house to share, in Anna’s name. He also provided furnishings and trust funds for ongoing income.\n\nOf the two women, Anna Marie Shields was given the larger of the trusts and it was said that she had been a sort of companion to Dr. Physick."
