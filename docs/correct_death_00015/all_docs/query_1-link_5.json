        "text": "Historic site in Philadelphia\n\nFor the cemetery in Quincy, Massachusetts, see Christ Church Burial Ground (Quincy, Massachusetts).\n\nUnited States historic place\n\nChrist Church Burial Ground\n\nShow map of Philadelphia\n\nShow map of Pennsylvania\n\nShow map of the United States\n\nLocation5th and Arch streets,\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.CoordinatesNRHP reference No.71000062[1]Added to NRHPJune 24, 1971\n\nChrist Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia is an important early-American cemetery. It is the final resting place of Benjamin Franklin and his wife, Deborah. Four other signers of the Declaration of Independence are buried here, Benjamin Rush, Francis Hopkinson, Joseph Hewes, and George Ross. Two additional signers of the Declaration of Independence, James Wilson and Robert Morris, are buried at Christ Church just a few blocks away.\n\nThe cemetery belongs to Christ Church, the Episcopal church, which was founded in 1695 and served as a place of worship for many of the most notable participants in the American Revolution, including George Washington. The burial ground is located at 5th and Arch streets, across from the Visitors Center and National Constitution Center in Center City Philadelphia. The Burial Ground was opened in 1719, and is still an active cemetery. The Burial Ground is open to the public for a small fee, weather permitting; about 100,000 tourists visit each year.\n\nWhen the burial ground is closed, one can still view Benjamin Franklin's gravesite from the sidewalk at the corner of 5th and Arch Streets through a set of iron rails. The bronze rails in the brick wall were added for public viewing in 1858 by parties working at the behest of the Franklin Institute, which assumed the responsibility of defending Franklin's historic ties to Philadelphia after prominent Bostonians criticized the city's maintenance of the grave and erected a Franklin statue there.[2] Leaving pennies on Franklin's grave is an old Philadelphia tradition.\n\nOther famous people buried at Christ Church Burial Ground include:\n\nJohn Andrews, (1746-1813), fourth Provost of the University of Pennsylvania\n\nMichael Woolston Ash (1789–1858), U.S. Congressman[3]\n\nSamuel John Atlee (1739–1786), delegate to the Continental Congress[3]\n\nBenjamin Franklin Bache (1769–1798), grandson of Benjamin Franklin, printer and publisher of the Aurora newspaper[3]\n\nSarah Franklin Bache (1743–1808), daughter of Benjamin Franklin[3]\n\nWilliam Bainbridge (1774–1833), Navy hero of War of 1812 and captain of the USS Constitution\"[3]\n\nFrancis Biddle (1886–1968), former U.S. attorney general\n\nJames Biddle (1783–1848), Commodore in United States Navy\n\nThomas Bond (1713–1784), co-founder (with Benjamin Franklin) of Pennsylvania Hospital, the nation's first hospital[3]\n\nPaul Busti (1749-1824), Agent General of the Holland Land Company\n\nMajor General George Cadwalader (1806–1879), American Civil War general[3]\n\nJohn Cadwalader (1805–1879), congressman and judge[4]\n\nMatthew Clarkson (1733–1800), mayor of Philadelphia\n\nJoseph Clay (1769–1811), U.S. Congressman\n\nTench Coxe (1755–1824), Continental Congress delegate\n\nWilliam Henry Drayton (1742-1799), Continental Congress delegated and signer of the Articles of Confederation\n\nJohn Dunlap (1747–1812), printer of the Declaration of Independence[3]\n\nLewis Evans (c.1700–1756), cartographer and surveyor\n\nTench Francis, Jr. (1730-1800)\n\nDavid Franks (1740–1793), aide-de-camp to General Benedict Arnold during the American Revolutionary War[3]\n\nSamuel Hardy (1758–1785), delegate to the Continental Congress\n\nMichael Hillegas (1729–1804), first Treasurer of the United States[3]\n\nThomas Hopkinson (1709–1751), father of Francis Hopkinson, president of the Philosophical Society, and one of the founders of The Library Company of Philadelphia[3]\n\nJohn Inskeep (1757–1834), mayor of Philadelphia\n\nMajor William Jackson (1759–1828), Revolutionary War officer and secretary of the Constitutional Convention[3]\n\nThomas Lawrence, five-time mayor of Philadelphia\n\nMajor General Charles Lee (1732-1782), controversial Revolutionary War officer and second-highest ranking general after George Washington from 1776 to 1778.\n\nCharles Mason (1728–1786), astronomer and surveyor who laid out the Mason–Dixon line in 1763[3]\n\nGeorge A.
