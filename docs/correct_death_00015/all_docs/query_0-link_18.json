        "text": "This year’s theme of “Craftsmanship” explores how American creators and makers throughout history have shaped our lives.\n\nThe annual Ben Franklin Celebration serves as a public “junto” about the important issues that trace a through line from Franklin’s day to our own, followed by a colorful procession through Old City Philadelphia and a ceremonial wreathlaying at Franklin’s grave at Christ Church Burial Ground.\n\nCraftsmanship\n\nBenjamin Franklin was a printer and artist–a true craftsman. Franklin’s work as a tradesman and inventor left its mark on Philadelphia and America. How did “craft” shape early America and how do artisans and makers shape the world we live in today? Through the lens of history, we examine the important role of craftsmanship in America.\n\nWhat does BF have to do with this?\n\nBEN FRANKLIN was the quintessential American. A founding father with a powerful and lasting legacy, he was also a genius of inquisitive mind and broad interests. In celebrating Franklin, we revisit his accomplishments and their impact on history while casting new light on the American character.\n\nEach year, the celebration highlights a theme that connects Franklin’s work to current social issues and concerns. The Franklin Founder Award is presented to an honored guest who has excelled in that field."
