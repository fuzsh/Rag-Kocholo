        "text": "Benjamin Franklin's remarkable scientific accomplishments were, in part, enabled by slavery, pervasive in the British colonies both North and South. He chose to take advantage of that system. His attitudes about slavery were complicated and changed over time. Even though he later became an abolitionist, he personally held multiple people in bondage during his lifetime. Their labor helped to build his fortune, allowing him to retire early and pursue electrical research and politics. In his Pennsylvania Gazette newspaper, he published anti-slavery writings by authors such as the outspoken Quaker, Benjamin Lay. But he also published advertisements for the sale of enslaved people and bounties for the capture of escapees. A competing publisher in Philadelphia refused to run such ads, believing them morally wrong. To supplement income from his printing shop, Franklin established a store in which he sold paper, ink, books, and general goods. He sometimes also sold enslaved people. Not a central part of his business, he most often acted as a broker, making sales on behalf of others. Franklin also accepted enslaved people as payment for debts, then resold them.\n\nFranklin held people enslaved during the time he pursued his electrical experiments. Their labor in his household helped make time that he could use to study electricity. Family, friends, and visitors directly participated in electrical experiments. The records are few and unclear, but enslaved people may also have directly assisted his research. Ways in which people directly participated in Franklin’s work included operating the research equipment and acting as experimental subjects.\n\nElectrostatic generators were human-powered, typically operated by turning a crank. If an assistant operated the machine, Franklin could more easily perform experiments and lecture to those who witnessed his demonstrations. A second pair of eyes and ears would have been helpful in estimating the length of a spark, and the volume of its sound. He invented an alarm to alert him if a storm was approaching. Members of his household were told to observe the alarm bells if they rang while he was away. Many of the experiments Franklin performed required two or more people, and he sometimes mentioned the assistance of a family member or friend. That assistant could also have been an indentured servant or an enslaved person, although he never mentioned them in reports of his work.\n\nUsing people as test subjects was common in Franklin’s era. Researchers took and gave shocks in experiments and demonstrations because they did not have precise electrical meters. They wanted to feel the shock to determine how powerful the electric charge might be.\n\nResearchers also used people as conductors to determine how far an electrical charge might travel, and if electrical effects would fade with distance. Franklin wrote about experiments in which he took shocks and used family and friends in these ways, although he seldom identified who in particular assisted him. Indentured servants and enslaved people in his household could also have been used, although we may never know for certain.\n\nWho were the enslaved people?\n\nWe know very little about the people Franklin held enslaved between 1735 and 1781. We are not even certain exactly how many people he kept enslaved. Nevertheless, we can piece together a partial, if incomplete record of those individuals from Franklin’s papers, letters, and the writings of his friends and family. This information is drawn from the work of several scholars, listed below.\n\nIn 1735, a local merchant billed Franklin for shoes for a “negro boy.” In 1742, he received a bill for a beaver hat “for your man Joseph.” In 1745, he was billed for a racoon hat “for your Negro.” Those ledger entries may refer to one, two, or three different people. One scholar believes that Joseph may have been an indentured servant named Joseph Rose who worked for Franklin, not an enslaved person. Regardless, the fate of this person (or people) remains unknown.\n\nIn a letter to Jane Mecom, dated 10 June 1756, Franklin wrote, “The Small Pox is beginning in Town by Inoculation, but has not otherwise spread as yet; those who have been inoculated not being yet in the ripe state to communicate Infections. We have only a Negro Child to have it.” Franklin is referring to his household not Philadelphia at large when he says “we.”\n\nThe child referenced in the letter may have been Othello, who may also have been the child purchased for £41.10 before Franklin left for London in 1757. Franklin’s wife Deborah intended to send Othello to a local school established for educating Blacks, but he died of a “distemper” (a generic term for disease) in early February 1760.\n\nWhen Benjamin Franklin and his son William travelled to London in 1757, they took two enslaved men with them as personal servants: Peter and King. In 1758, King escaped and was given shelter by a woman living in Suffolk. The Franklins discovered his whereabouts but made no attempt to reclaim him. King's fate is unknown. Presumably he died a free man in or near Suffolk.\n\nPeter remained with the Franklins after King’s escape. During a trip to Ecton, the town from which Franklin’s father emigrated, Peter was tasked with cleaning the headstones of Franklin’s ancestors while William copied inscriptions. Peter returned to Philadelphia with the Franklins in 1763 to be reunited with his wife, Jemima. His fate is unknown.\n\nPurchased by Franklin in the early 1750s, Jemima remained with Deborah Franklin in Philadelphia while their husbands were in England. Othello may have been Jemima’s son, although that is uncertain. She died enslaved around 1765.\n\nUpon returning from London in 1763, Benjamin Franklin bought a man named George from a business associate, James Parker. Before going to France in 1776, Franklin gave George to daughter Sarah and son-in-law Richard Bache. They were living in Franklin's house, Deborah Franklin having died two years earlier. George died enslaved in June 1781.\n\nAnother man, Bob, may have been purchased by Deborah around 1760. He was held enslaved by Richard Bache until emancipated by the terms of Benjamin Franklin's will. According to Franklin’s great-granddaughter, he remained with the Baches until his death.\n\nOne final enslaved individual appears in the known records, possibly named Jack. Jane Mecom mentioned a “little mulatto” in a letter to Deborah Franklin in 1770.\n\nFranklin’s changing views on slavery\n\nAs he moved into politics in the years following his electrical work, Benjamin Franklin often faced the contradictions of promoting liberty for some and enslavement for others. England was moving toward abolition when he, William, Peter, and King arrived there in 1757. The Franklins probably made no attempt to reclaim King, who had fled to Suffolk, because political opponents could have used that against him. He began publishing anti-slavery tracts in England around 1760, but did so anonymously. Today we see how easy it is to promote controversial political positions using anonymous social media. Although personally uneasy about slavery by then, Franklin did not take an overtly anti-slavery position in England.\n\nLater, despite his changing personal views, Franklin worked to keep proposals for abolition from interfering with American independence or ratification of the Constitution. In 1776, Franklin did not free George before going to France to represent the new United States, something he could have done. Instead, he gave George to his daughter and son-in-law. That made his negotiating position easier with the French, while not angering pro-slavery colleagues in the US delegation. During the Constitutional Convention, Franklin’s main goal was to keep the new country united. He understood that southern states would not accept a constitution that abolished slavery, so he chose to compromise. He hoped people would voluntarily choose to end slavery, a step taken by some states as well as nations like France and England.\n\nFranklin became president of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery in 1787, and supported Pennsylvania’s adoption of gradual emancipation. But during his lifetime he never emancipated any of the people he enslaved. In his will, he made emancipation of Bob a condition for the Baches to inherit his estate. One of his last letters parodied pro-slavery arguments made by a southern representative. He recast the man’s words into a letter from a fictional Islamic sultan who ridiculed the idea of doing away with enslaving Christians.\n\nFranklin’s place in the nation’s history of slavery is part of his legacy, as is his electrical research. He held views, values, and opinions that evolved over the course of his life. Ahead of his time in many respects, as a scientist, advocate for democracy, and celebrity, Franklin was unwilling to push too far on the issue of slavery. We encourage visitors to look for more information about Franklin, and especially about the people whom he enslaved. Untapped resources exist in local library and archival collections, family papers, and other records.
