        "text": "Christ Church Burial Grounds\n\nA Who's Who of Early America.\n\nIn 1719 the burial ground next to Christ Church was becoming full, and the neighboring lands proved too marshy to be useful for burials. (Ducks swam in a nearby pond!) An entry in the minutes of the Christ Church Vestry from May 15, 1719 reads \"The Church wardens are desired to agree...for a plot of ground which they have already viewed for a burying place and to collect the money [for it] with all convenient speed.\" A June 23 record continues in the same vein: \"The Vestry being Mett considered the unhappy circumstances of our Church Yard for a burying place & Mr. Trent & Mr. Assheton are desired to find out a convenient purchase of Ground to add to the Church Yard...\"\n\nLand was purchased along Fifth Street \"in the suburbs\" from a Mr. James Steel. In 1719, the city of Philadelphia was only 37 years old and Fifth Street, only about three blocks from Christ Church, was considered the \"suburbs\" or outskirts of the city.\n\nFunerals in the Revolutionary Era\n\nDuring the era of the American Revolution, many colonists felt that funerals had become overly pomp-filled ceremonies. Simple solemn ceremonies were more in keeping with the tenor of the times. And as the process of embalming was still not practiced, burials were conducted with all possible celerity. Plain pine coffins were covered with palls, black for adults and white for children. Religious services were held at graveside.\n\nThe Burial Ground Today\n\nMany of the gravestones dating from the 18th and early 19th centuries were in an advanced state of deterioration that made them impossible to read. Acid rain and the high content of lime in the marble are the prime culprits for the damage. Thanks to efforts by Christ Church, many of the stones have been repaired, and the inscriptions restored.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790)\n\nInterred at Christ Church Burial Ground are hundreds of Colonial, Revolutionary and Post-Revolutionary notables. The most famous of whom is Benjamin Franklin.\n\nFranklin, the human multitude, was among other things, Signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, printer, author, scientist, postmaster, inventor, and diplomat. At Franklin's death some 20,000 Philadelphians followed his cortege to his grave. His passing in 1790 symbolically severed the most important link to Colonial Philadelphia and the Revolutionary Era. The City of Brotherly Love would have to face a new century without its Renaissance man. William Smith, a long-time Franklin foe and Provost of the University of Pennsylvania, gave Franklin's eulogy in Christ Church, and the Comte de Mirabeau did the same before the French National Assembly in Paris.\n\nBuried with Franklin is his wife Deborah. Much has been written about their relationship. To get some notion of how he perceived her, he once sent her an English beer jug with this message: \"I fell in love with it at first sight for I thought it look'd like a fat jolly Dame, clean and tidy, with a neat blue and white calico gown on, good natur'd and lovely, and put me in mind of â€” Somebody.\" That Somebody was her!\n\nNearby is a tiny marker for Francis Franklin who died of small pox at age four. After \"Frankie's\" death, his grieving father urged Philadelphians to inoculate their children against this dread disease.\n\nNext to Benjamin and Deborah Franklin, are their daughter and son-in-law, Sarah (\"Sally\") Franklin and Richard Bache. The Baches lived with Benjamin Franklin in a house that stood where Franklin Court is today. Bache published the virulently anti-Washington newspaper The Aurora. Franklin's other son, William, is not buried here. During the Revolution he was a Loyalist. Benjamin Franklin wrote that nothing in his life had ever hurt him so much as the defection of his son.\n\nAlso Buried Here, a Who's Who of Early America"
