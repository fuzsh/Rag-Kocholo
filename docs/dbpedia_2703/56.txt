Callicarpa [genus] L. LAMIACEAE

Synonyms: Geunsia [genus] Blume

Common names: Beautyberry (Hortus)

Asia, Australia, N & Cent. Am., tropics & subtrop.; 135 spp. Polygamous, deciduous or evergreen shrubs & trees, often with stellate or scurfy pubescence. Lvs. opp., simple, entire or toothed, often acuminate. Fls. pink, bluish, red, purple or whitish, in axillary cymes. Calyx 4-toothed, rarely 4-parted or 5 toothed, corolla 4-lobed, rarely 5-lobed, stamens 4 or rarely 5, ovary 4-celled, 4-ovuled. Fruit drupaceous. Grown for both the ornamental fls. and clusters of colored fruits. In Verbenaceae (Hortus Third 1976:201) Cymes small, many-fld., fls. small, corolla infundibular or salverform, stamens exserted. Fruit a small bead-like drupe. In Verbenaceae (Griffiths 1994:187) Dioecious spp. on Bonin Is.; females have non-germinating pollen, perhaps pollen is a reward for pollinators (Mabberley 1997:115) Plants are sub-aromatic, often bitter in taste. Throughout the East used medicinally, some internally, others in poulticing. Several spp. of Am. are active diuretics & purgatives. Wood of little use. Malayan spp. mostly have similar medicinal uses. Names such as ‘tampang’ indicates the plants are used to make plasters; such names occur as far E as the Philippines. 3 spp. which contain a saponin are used as fish-poisons in the Philippines. Interesting that twigs of two of them, dried until the lvs. have fallen, are used as bait for prawns. In Verbenaceae (Burkill 1966:Vol. 1 page 407) Geunsia: shrubs (Burkill 1966:Vol. 1 page 1085) One sp. from the Philippines is a stunning tree with fragrant lavender fls. followed by brilliant scarlet berries in great masses like elderberries [Sambucus, Caprifoliaceae]. It is only two and a half years since the seeds arrived here, and this summer a tree 20 ft. high covered with berries and alive with birds, just as it was beside a road in Mindanao (Fairchild 1943)
