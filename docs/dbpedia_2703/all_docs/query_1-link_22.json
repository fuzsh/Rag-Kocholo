        "text": "Etymology\n\n- Genus name Callicarpa derives from the Greek word 'kalli' meaning beautiful and \"karpos\" meaning fruit. (15)\n\n- Species names 'pedunculatus, a, um,' is Latin, meaing 'equipped with peduncle', referring to the peduncle of inflorescences longer than the petioles. (21)\n\nBotany\n\nPalis is a shrub growing 1 to 3 meters high. Younger plant parts are thinly or densely covered with short, stellately arranged, brownish or pale hairs. Leaves are ovate-lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate, 5 to 15 centimeters long, 2.5 to 6 centimeters wide, with a long slender, pointed tip and pointed to blunt base. Lowers surfaces of the leaves are densely covered with stellate hairs, and with numerous, small, waxy, yellow glands. Cymes are axillary, short-stalked, and 2 to 4 centimeters long. Flowers are pale purplish or lavender, and about 3 millimeters long. Fruit is a berry, fleshy, rounded, pale lavender, and 4 to 5 millimeters in diameter.\n\nDistribution\n\n- Native to the Philippines.\n\n- Throughout the Philippines in thickets and secondary forests at low and medium altitudes.\n\n- Sometimes cultivated as an ornamental.\n\n- Also native to Assam, Bismark Archipelago, China, Hainan, Himalaya, Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Maluku, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, New Guinea, New South Wales, Queensland, Solomon Is., Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam. (8)\n\nConstituents\n\n- Ethanol extract yielded four new iridoid glycosides, 6-O -benzoylphlorigidoside B, 6-O-trans-cinna- moylphlorigidoside B, 6-O-trans-p-coumaroylshanzhiside methyl ester, and 4'- O-trans-p-coumaroylmussaenoside together with known constituents, 6b-hydroxyipolamiide and phlorigidoside B, in addition to five known clerodane diterpenoids, hardwickiic acid, monomethyl kolavate, echinophyllin C, clerodermic acid methyl ester, and 15,16-dihydro-15-methoxy-16-oxo- hardwickiic acid. (3)\n\n- Study of fresh leaves yielded two new naturally occurring flavonoids, 3,4',5,7-tetramethoxyflavone and 3,3',4',5,7-pentamethoxyflavone, along with known compounds, 5-hydroxy-3,4',7-trimethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3,3',4,7tetramethoxyflavone, ursolic acid, 2Î±,3Î±-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, phytosterols, and phytosteryl glucosides. (4)\n\n- Study of essential oil from the leaves of C. formosana yielded 48 constituents. Main components were (-) spathulenol (20.3%), ß-caryophyllene (17.22%), germacrene D (8.06%), ß-eudesmene (5.52%). (see study below) (2)\n\n- Phytoconstituent studies of leaves yielded flavonoids (5-hydroxy-3,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone, 5,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone, 3,5,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone) and phytosterols (Ã-sitosterol, Ã-sitosterol-d-glucoside, stigmasterol, stigmasterol-D-glucoside), triterpenoids (2a,3a-dihhydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, ursolic acid). (10)\n\n- Study of fresh leaves yielded two new naturally occurring flavonoids, 3,4â²,5,7-tetramethoxyflavone and 3,3â²,4â²,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone, along with known compounds, 5-hydroxy-3,4â²,7-trimethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3,3â²,4,7-tetramethoxyflavone, ursolic acid, 2Î±,3Î±-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, phytosterols, and phytosteryl glucosides. (11)\n\n- Study of ethanol extracts of twigs and leaves isolated four new iridoid glycosides i.e., 6-O-benzoyl- phlorigidoside B (1), 6-O-trans-cinnamoylphlorigidoside B (2), 6-O-trans-p-coumaroylshanzhiside methyl ester (3), and 4'-O-trans-p-coumaroylmussaenoside (4). (12)\n\n- Leaf essential oil of C. formosana from Vietnam was dominated by caryophyllene oxide (38.9%), Ã-bisabolene (18.6%), and (E)-caryophyllene (6.5%). Composition is notably different from EO collected in Guangdong China, which was composed largely of spathulenol (20.2%), (E)-caryophyllene (17.2%), germacrene D (8.1%), and Ã-eudesmol (5.5%). (see study below) (18)\n\n- Study of C. pedunculata yielded four diterpenes: 14Î±-hydroxy-7, 15-isopimaradien-18-oic acid; 16Î±,17-dihydroxy-3-oxophyllocladane; 8,11,13,15-abietatetraen-18-oic acid; 6Î±-hydroxy nidorellol. (19)\n\n- Study of chloroform extract of whole plant yielded 14 Î±-hydroxy-7, 15-isopimaradien-18-oic acid (1), 16 Î±, 17-dihydroxy-3-oxo-phyllocladanetriol (2), 8, 11, 13, 15-abietetraen-18-oic acid (3), and 6 Î±-hydroxy nidorellol (4); 2 flavonoids: 5-hydroxy-3, 4â², 7-trimethoxy-flavone (5), and 3, 5-dimethyl kaempferol (6); and the others were ursolic acid (7), myoinositol (8), Î²-sitosterol (9), and Î²-amyrin (10) Conclusion Compounds 1-4 were found in this plant for the first time.
