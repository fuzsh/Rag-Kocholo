gynoecial), ovules unitegmic, integument thick, endothelium +, nucellar epidermis does not persist, style single, long; seed exotestal; endosperm cellular, embryo long. - [Back to Index]\n\nEstimates of the age of the stem group asterids range from ca 128Ma before present, mid Early Cretaceous, the Cornales and Ericales diverging soon afterwards, and the other asterid orders all diverging over 100Ma before present (K. Bremer et al. 2004) to ca 112Ma before present for the stem group, ca 109Ma before present for the crown group (Anderson et al. 2005: asterids other than Cornales and Ericales not sampled).\n\nIridoids, common in asterids, have been implicated in herbivore preferences, detering some and attracting others (e.g. see discussion under Plantaginaceae, Scrophulariaceae, etc.: Bowers 1980, 1988). Iridoids have a bitter taste and are emetics for vertebrates, at least, yet iridoids are sometimes sequestered by insects and used in their defences against predators (Nishida 2002 for a summary). Thus Uraniidae (moths) are found on Dipsacales, Lamiales, Gentianales - and also Daphniphyllaceae, one of the few iridoid-containing members of Saxifragales (see Lees & Smith 1991). Larvae of Nymphalidae-Melitaeini butterflies are also almost restricted to asterids. However, in this case they are also quite common on Asteraceae and Acanthaceae, which, although asterids, lack iridoids, furthermore, Melitaeini distinguish between plants with route I secoiridoids, which they commonly eat, and those with route II decarboxylated iridoids (iridoid glycosides), which they rarely eat (Wahlberg 2001). Iridoids may also be involved in plant-plant relationships, the iridoid aglucone, formed by removing the sugar moiety, being toxic and perhaps accentuating the effect of parasite Orobanchaceae on their hosts (Rank et al. 2004), while iridoids from roots of Verbascum (Scrophulariaceae) may depress germination of competitors (Pardo et al. 2004).\n\nIn the asterids, compound leaves are relatively uncommon, and if the leaves are compound, the leaflets are often not articulated and/or distinct (but c.f. Bignoniaceae, Oleaceae). Taxa with stipules are also fairly uncommon, as are those with apetalous flowers, complex seed coats, and arillate seeds. ympetalae of older studies were defined largely by their sympetalous corolla; monosymmetry may have arisen some fifteen times in the asterids, with reversal in Lamiales and Dipsacales (Jabbour et al. 2008: see also Donoghue et al. 1998; Ree & Donoghue 1999). Such flowers may have one, or rarely two, spurs (Jabbour et al. 2008). Within asterids, Ericales and Cornales in particular show much variation in the degree of sympetaly, stamen number, adnation of stamens to corolla, ovule morphology and anatomy, and seed coat anatomy, etc. Some of this variation is like that found in rosids, Dilleniales, etc., and unlike that in the ASTERID I + ASTERID II group, which see for more details. Ericales and Cornales may also have ellagic acid, which has a rather similar distribution in seed plants. Note that a tube-forming hypanthium is rare in asterids, although in the largely polypetalous rosids a hypanthium is quite common. The integument, when single, is often dermal in origin, as is the inner integument of other angiosperms, while the outer integument is largely subdermal (but c.f. monocots: see Bouman 1984; de Toni & Mariath 2009). Although this might suggest that the single integument of asterids corresponds to the inner integument of many bitegmic angiosperms, sampling need to be improved, and given that a number of Cornales and Ericales in particular have botegmic ovules, the evolutionary story is unlikely to be simple. In general, where many characters are to be placed on the tree depends on resolution of relationships within Ericales and Cornales, and the pattern of gain-loss of some of these features is liable to be rather complex (see monosymmetry above).\n\nSome families included in the asterids seem to be polypetalous, but developmental studies like those of Erbar (1991) may show they have a ring primordium very early on (see also, for example, Reidt & Leins 1994). However, the position of \"type\" of corolla initiation on the tree is quite uncertain. Apiales + Asterales + Dipsacales of the asterid II group have many members with early tube initiation, as do both Oleaceae and Rubiaceae, \"basal\" or almost so in their orders in asterid I group, and so do some Cornales. Although sampling leaves a great deal to be desired, early initiation could conceivably be a synapomorphy for the asterids as a whole (see Leins & Erbar 2003b for details). Whatever the method of tube initiation, it is only in Ericales and other asterids that the mature flower may have an obvious corolla tube, hence the apomorphy of corolla tube uniting [Ericales + other asterids].\n\nSome characters common in asterids may have functional and logical linkages that must be taken into account. Thus the presence of a tenuinucellate nucellus is linked with that of unitegmic ovules, the development of an endothelium (Kapil & Tiwari 1978), and a simple exotestal seed type (Netolitzky 1926); that of sympetalous monosymmetric flowers with epipetalous stamens, etc.\n\nThe monophyly of the asterids is well established (e.g. Olmstead et al. 1992, 2000; P. Soltis 1999); Albach et al. (1998) suggest the four main groupings recognised here; see also K. Bremer et al. (2001), Albach et al. (2001b), and the Bayesian analyses of Lundberg (2001b, d). B. Bremer et al. (2003) provide a recent comprehensive phylogeny of the clade, although with minimal sampling within families, using three coding and three non-coding chloroplast markers. Both B. Bremer et al. (2003) and Olmstead (2000) found strong support for Cornales being sister to all other asterids (see also Albach et al. 2001; Soltis et al. (2003). However, in Hilu et al. (2003: matK gene alone) the positions of Cornales and Ericales were reversed.\n\nSympetalae of older studies were defined largely by their sympetalous corolla, and so families like Pittosporaceae, Theaceae s.l., etc., were usually excluded. The distinction between the other angiosperms and the asterids partly corresponds to another long-recognized distinction, that between the crassinucellate and tenuinucellate groups of Young and Watson (1970, based on phenetic analyses). There are also substantial differences, for example, Young and Watson included Apiaceae-Araliaceae in their crassinucellate group. Philipson (1974) further emphasized the distinction between the crassinucellate and tenuinucellate groups of Young and Watson, linking the two via Celastraceae, Grossulariaceae and Brexiaceae (here Celastrales, Saxifragales, and Crossosomatales) - although none of these is a phylogenetic \"intermediate\". Philipson thought that Theales, Primulales and Ebenales (here part of Ericales) together made up a separate lineage. Later Philipson (1977) resurrected van Tieghem's (1901) names Unitegminae and Bitegminae for these two groups; integument number and nucellus condition are correlated.\n\nBernadello (2007) surveys nectary variation in asterids.\n\nCORNALES Dumortier - [Back to Index]\n\nIridoids diverse, ellagic acid +; nodes 3:3; inflorescence cymose; C valvate, apparently free, tube formation early; A basifixed, G inferior, crowned with disc-like nectary, 1-2 apical crassinucellate ovules/carpel, ventral carpellary bundles usu. in the carpel wall [transseptal bundles, i.e. vascular bundles to ovules go over the top of the septum and then down; there are no bundles running up the central axis of the gynoecium]; fruit drupaceous, with germination valve(s) in the stone. - 7 families, 51 genera, 590 species.\n\nMolecular studies (e.g. Xiang et al. 1993) suggest a break-up of Cornaceae s.l. (see below); the core is here. Relationships within Cornales as a whole are unclear, and the inclusion of Hydrostachys in analyses considerably affects topologies and support values (but Hydrostachys may belong to Lamiales). For the relationships of Grubbiaceae and Hydrostachyaceae, see especially Fan and Xiang (2003) and Xiang et al. (2002). Basic information about embryology, chemistry, etc., needs to be gathered from many genera to allow broad comparisons across the order, but Manchester et al. (2007) suggest interesting groupings based on fruit anatomy; of the taxa whose fruits have massively thickened walls, only in Nyssaceae are the cells fibrous (?an apomorphy), while in the other genera they are more or less sclereidal. Burleigh et al. (2009) recently found that in a five gene analysis there was strong support for a position of Hydrostachys within Lamiales, largely because of the matK sequence added. However, where in the Lamiales it might be placed was unclear, although it would be in a clade that excluded Oleaceae, at least (Burleigh et al. 2009).\n\nTakhtajan (1997) included Hydrangeales in Cornidae-Cornanae, but Loasales-Loasanae were part of his Lamiidae, while in earlier classifications Hydrangeaceae were often considered to be woody Saxifragaceae, sometimes being included in that family or placed in Rosales (e.g. Cronquist 1981). Eleven of the fifteen genera included in Cornaceae s.l. have been placed in monotypic families, or conversely, the family has been circumscribed very broadly, as by Mabberley (1997, but c.f. 2008); it has turned out to be polyphyletic. For other Cornaceae s.l., see e.g. Garryaceae (Garryales), Curtisiaceae (Solanales), Argophyllaceae (Asterales) and Griseliniaceae (Apiales).\n\nFor information mostly about Cornaceae s.l., see Faure (1924: anatomy), Ferguson (1977: pollen), Sato (1976: embryology) and Grayer et al. (1999: saponins).\n\nThis is the asterid IV group of some early phylogenetic studies.\n\nIncludes Cornaceae, Curtisiaceae, Grubbiaceae, Hydrangeaceae, Hydrostachyaceae, Loasaceae, Nyssaceae.\n\nCornaceae + Nyssaceae: route I secoiridoids; hairs T-shaped, unicellular; K small, pollen with complex endaperture [a pore joining two lateral thinnings parallel to the colpus], ventral carpellary bundles usu. in the carpel wall [transseptal bundles, i.e. vascular bundles to ovules go over the top of the septum and then down], style short.\n\nCORNACEAE Dumortier - 2/85. Scattered, not S. South America.\n\nMany Cornaceae are recognisable vegetatively by their T-shaped hairs and leaves often with entire margins and actinodromous venation, the lateral (secondary) veins arching and proceeding towards the apex. The flowers are often small and aggregated into heads or other compact inflorescences; the flowers of one inflorescence open more or less together. The flowers have a small calyx, apparently free and valvate petals, an inferior ovary crowned by a disc-like nectary and having 1-2 locules/carpel, and a 1-seeded drupaceous fruit.\n\nViburnum (Adoxaceae) is quite often confused with Cornus, but it has stellate hairs and the lateral veins are widely spreading.\n\nNote that the floral organ diversity genes B and C are expressed in the large, white inflorescence bracts of Cornus (Maturen et al. 2005).\n\nFor relationships within Cornus, c.f. Murrell (1993) and Xiang et al. (2006); morphology seems to be somewhat misleading here. Blue-fruited dogwoods have lost iridoids (Xiang et al. 1997).\n\nFor information, see Adams (1949: anatomy) and Eyde (e.g. 1968, 1988: flower and fruit in particular), Neubauer (1978: petiolar anatomy), Jensen et al. (1975a: iridoids), Johri et al. (1992: embryo sac), and Kubitzki (2004b: general).\n\nNYSSACEAE Dumortier - 5/22. Mainly East Asia, also Indo-Malesia and E. North America.\n\nFossils of Nyssaceae fruits are widespread in the northern hemisphere in the early Caenozoic, some being 3- or 4-carpelate (Eyde 1997, for details); Mastixia was especially abundant in Europe 65-70Ma before present.\n\nA small but still heterogeneous family. Davidia has flowers in heads subtended by two large white bracts (hence its common names, the dove tree or the handkerchief tree); the individual flowers lack a perianth and may have bitegmic ovules. Diplopanax has recently been placed in Mastixiaceae s. str. (Eyde & Quiyun 1990; c.f. Xiang et al. 1997). It seeds contain petroselenic acid (Zhu et al. 1998), common in Apiales, and relationships between Cornaceae and some Apiales have been suggested in the past...\n\nFor the alkaloid camptothecin, see Lorence and Nessler (2004), for cytology, see He et al. (2004), for general information, see Kubitzki (2004b: as Cornaceae), for Mastixia, see Matthew (1976).\n\nHydrangeaceae + Loasaceae: similar route I secoiridoids and route II decarboxylated iridoids, ellagic acid 0; cork cambium deep-seated; hairs tuberculate, walls calcified, with basal cell pedestals; leaves opposite, with glandular teeth; placentation parietal, gynoecium with axial/central vascular bundles; fruit septicidal; exotestal cells variously elongated, inner walls thickened.\n\nA perhaps surprising family pair, although the two have many characters in common. The androecium of both families is very variable in development (Hufford 1990, 1998). Flowers with ten stamens may well be plesiomorphic, with polystemony derived.\n\nHYDRANGEACEAE Dumortier - 17/190. Warm temperate, a few tropical.\n\n1. Jamesioideae Hufford - Leaf buttresses conspicuous after leaf fall; K valvate, C free, style branched. - 2/ca 5. W. North America.\n\n2. Hydrangeoideae Burnett - Raphide sacs +. - 15/185. Warm temperate, esp. South East Asia and North America, S. to Chile and Malesia.\n\n2a. Philadelpheae - C imbricate; A initiation as five common primordia, embryo sac ± protruding from the nucellus. - 6/130: Philadelphus (65), Deutzia (60). Warm temperate, esp. South East Asia to the Philippines, S.W. North America, also Central America, one sp. in Europe.\n\n2b. Hydrangeeae - Inflorescences with conspicuous marginal flowers; C valvate; fruits loculicidal. - 9/65. Warm N. temperate, S. to Chile and Malesia.\n\nHydrangeaceae are usually rather robust herbs or shrubs with opposite leaves that are joined by a line across the stem. The flowers have free petals that are often valvate in bud and usually at least twice as many stamens as petals; the ovary is more or less inferior.\n\nInflorescences of Hydrangeae may have conspicuous marginal flowers, the sepal-like whorl being much enlarged. Hydrangeae include taxa with both centripetal and centrifugal androecial initiation, and initiation as antesepalous triplets or irregularly (Ge et al. 2007); Philadelphus has centrifugal androecial development. In a number of Philadelpheae the embryo sac more or less protrudes into the micropyle or beyond; how widely this character occurs is unclear (Maheshwari 1950; Hufford 2004). Fendlera has nuclear endosperm (Johri et al. 1992).\n\nFor relationships within the family, see Hufford (1997b) and Hufford et al. (2001); in the latter study, support for its monophyly is not overwhelming. For a classification of the family, see Hufford et al. (2001).\n\nFor vegetative anatomy, see Styer and Stern (1979 and references) and Gornall et al. (1998), for floral anatomy, see Bensel and Palser (1975c), for seeds, Hufford (1995, 1997) and Nemirovich-Danchenko and Lobova (1998), for iridoids, Frederiksen et al.(1999), for androecial development, Gelius (1967) and Hufford (1998, 2001a), and for general information, see Hufford (2004).\n\nLOASACEAE Jussieu - Trichomes glochidiate, often silicified; integument very thick, style hollow. - 14/265. Mostly American, also Africa and the Marquesas Islands.\n\n1. Eucnide - A connate basally. - 1/15. S.W. North America.\n\n2. Schismocarpus - Filaments shorter than the anthers. - 1/1: Schismocarpus pachypus. Mexico.\n\nLoasoideae [Mentzelioideae + Gronovioideae]: ?\n\n3. Loasoideae - Petals clawed, stamens in groups opposite petals, staminodes antesepalous. - Nasa (105). America, but also Africa (Kissenia) and Marquesas Islands (Plakothira).\n\nMentzelioideae + Gronovioideae: loss of C-A synorganisation.\n\n4. Mentzelioideae - A centripetal, connate basally. - 1/60. America.\n\n5. Gronovoioideae - C valvate, petals with a single vascular trace; A 5, opposite sepals, anthers bifacial; G with 1 apical crassinucellate ovule; fruit a cypsela; testa none. - America.\n\nLoasaceae are usually herbs that have barbed or glochidiate silicified and sometimes stinging hairs; at least the first pair of leaves is opposite. The flowers, which usually have separate, spreading petals, numerous radiating stamens with long filaments, and an inferior ovary, are distinctive.\n\nWeigend and Gottschling (2006) discuss pollination, revolver flowers, etc., in the large genus Nasa.\n\nIn some species of Petalonyx (Gronovioideae) there is postgenital fusion of the corolla, this forces the stamens outside the corolla. For the complexities of androecial initiation, see Hufford (1990 and references); antepetalous stamens may arise from the flanks of antisepalous stamen primordia, and androecial development may be centripetal or centrifugal. Hufford (2003) described staminode evolution in detail. Thus in Loasoideae the outer whorl of antesepalous staminodes may be connate and form scales, the inner whorl of staminodes remain separate and are more elaborated.\n\nStrongly supported relationships suggested by Moody and Hufford (2000), Moody et al. (2001), Hufford et al. (2003) and Hufford (2003) are Eucnide [Schismocarpus [Loasoideae [Mentzelioideae + Gronovioideae]]]. The clade [Plakothira + Klaprothia + Kissenia] may be sister to all other Loasoideae, but with little support (Hufford et al. 2005), or they may be part of a major polytomy (see also Weigend et al. 2004). The distribution of this little clade is remarkable - the Marquesas Islands, where it was only fairly recently discovered, South America, and Africa.\n\nFor information, see Thompson and Ernst (1967: Eucnide), Brown and Kaul (1981: floral morphology), Weigend (1996: Loasaceae of Ecuador), and Weigend (2004: general).\n\nHYDROSTACHYACEAE Engler - Submerged herbs; primary root 0; stomata 0; leaves in a rosette, deeply and complexly divided, surface with small enations, stipule +; inflorescence spicate, plants di(mon)oecious; P 0, nectary 0; staminate flowers: A 2, two-sporangiate, extrose, pollen in tetrads, inaperturate; carpelate flowers: G [2], placentation parietal, many unitegmic tenuinucellate ovules/carpel, styles separate, filiform; fruit a septicidal capsule; seeds minute, outer cell walls much thickened, mucilaginous; endosperm scanty or 0. - 1/20. C. and S. Africa, Madagascar.\n\nHydrostachyaceae are submerged, rosette-forming, aquatic herbs with complex leaves bearing enations, usually intrapetiolar stipules, dense, spicate inflorescence, and rather small flowers with extrorse anthers and free styles.\n\nAnother interpretation of the androecium is that is consists of a single ordinary (i.e., four locular/sporangiate) stamen.\n\nHydrostachyaceae have variously been suggested as being sister to Decumaria (Hydrangeaceae: molecular data suggest that it is perhaps most likely somewhere around here), or close to Crassulaceae (Saxifragales), or - perhaps - close to Podostemaceae (near Clusiaceae, Malpighiales). Takhtajan (1997), on the other hand, included Hydrostachyales in his Lamiidae. As Albach et al. (2001) note, few morphological characters support a position here, but this is perhaps to be expected of a highly-derived aquatic. However, members of sympetalous groups, especially Lamiales, show several similarities to Hydrostachyaceae in ovary structure (apical septae) and ovule and endosperm development (Jäger-Zürn 1965; Rauh & Jäger-Zürn 1966, 1967; see also Leins & Erbar 1990).\n\nFor general information, see Erbar and Leins (2004a).\n\nGrubbiaceae + Curtisiaceae: leaves opposite, bases connected by a ridge; flowers small, one ovule/carpel, style short; endosperm copious.\n\nGRUBBIACEAE Endlicher - Ericoid shrublet; anthers with two sporangia; fruit a syncarp. - 1/3. Cape Province, South Africa.\n\nGrubbiaceae are ericoid shrubs with capitate or cone-like inflorescences lacking radiating inflorescence bracts; its fruits are closely aggregated (c.f. Bruniaceae).\n\nThere is support for a sister group relationship to Curtisiaceae (e.g. Fan & Xiang 2001); Xiang et al. (2002) suggested that the two might be combined, but they are kept separate here because they are rather different in appearance. The inversion of the anther is very comprehensive in Grubbiaceae, and for some (e.g. Fagerlind 1947b) this suggested relationships with Ericaceae. Carlquist (1978a) found Grubbiaceae to be anatomically identical to Bruniaceae (near Asterales here), c.f. also Geissolomataceae (Crossosomatales).\n\nFor information, see Fagerlind (1948b: embryology), Dahlgren and van Wyk (1988: general) and Kubitzki (2004b: general).\n\nCURTISIACEAE Takhtajan - Gynoecium with axial/central vascular bundles. - 1/2. Southern Africa.\n\nManchester et al. (2007) recognised fruits of Curtisia from the Eocene of southern England; the fossils were originally described under Epacridaceae (= Ericaceae - Styphelioideae)!\n\nFor general information, see Kubitzki (2004b).\n\nERICALES [LAMIIDAE/ASTERID I + CAMPANULIDAE/ASTERID II]: ovules lacking parietal tissue [tenuinucellate].\n\nERICALES Dumortier - [Back to Index]\n\nNodes 1:1. - 25 families, 346 genera, 11,515 species.\n\nThe age of the stem group asterids may be ca 128Ma before present, mid Early Cretaceous, the Ericales diverging soon afterwards (K. Bremer et al. 2004). Interestingly, a fossil named Archaeamphora and assigned to Sarraceniaceae has been described from rocks about the same age as those in which Archaefructus was found, i.e. ca 124Ma before present (Li 2005), although this attribution needs to be confirmed. Anderson et al. (2005: asterids other then Cornales and Ericales not sampled) suggest figures of ca 109Ma before present for stem group Ericales, 103-99Ma before present for the crown group. Indeed, in the late Cretaceous of E. North America there is a great diversity of fossil flowers that may belong to Ericales, the oldest being some 90 Ma old (Crepet et al. 2001, 2004; see also Herendeen et al. 1999), and some of these have a morphology quite unlike that of extant members of the clade, e.g. some have sepals with numerous huge abaxial and/or marginal glands (Crepet 2008). Schönenberger and Friis (2001) described Paradinandra from the Late Cretaceous of Sweden, and this has a number of Ericalean features, some suggesting relationships with Pentaphylacaceae in particular (perhaps the relationships could more accurately be described as being with Ericales minus the Balsaminaceae and Polemoniaceae clades). Its placentation was intrusive parietal, the pollen was tricolpate, and there was a nectary disc around the base of the ovary; there were paired stamens opposite the petals and single stamens opposite the petals, as in some Sapotaceae, Ebenaceae, Styracaceae, Pentaphylacaceae and perhaps even Actinidiaceae (see also Friis 1985: a Diapensiaceae relative?; Keller et al. 1996: an Actinidiaceae relative?). Note that tricolpate pollen is uncommon in extant Ericales, being known only from Balsaminaceae and Lecythidiaceae.\n\nToday Ericales are an important component of the diversity of the understory in tropical rainforests, including ca 10% of the species and some 22% of the total stems (Davis et al. 2005a); families like Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae and Ebenaceae are involved. However, this forest may have developed only early in the Caenozoic (Burnham & Johnson 2004) whenever the clades now making it up initially diverged; members of Malpighiales are the other main component of this vegetation. Ericales contain ca 5.9% of eudicot diversity (Magallón et al. 1999), of which one third is made up of Ericaceae alone, not a noteworthy component of lowland tropical rainforests. Lens et al. (2007b), however, suggest that the ancestors of Ericales-Cornales grew under more temperate and boreal-arctic conditions and moved into tropical lowland rainforest. Insectivorous members of Ericales are nonmycorrhizal (Brundrett 2004 and references).\n\nTheoid leaf teeth, or modifications thereof, are common in Ericales, but I do not know details of their distribution. Theoid teeth are vascularized by a single vein that proceeds into an opaque, deciduous apical structure that ranges from a cap to a gland-headed hair.\n\nRelationships within the order were for some time poorly understood (e.g. Bayer et al. 1996: Morton et al. 1997a - both largely molecular data). However, Polemoniaceae + Fouquieraceae, Myrsinaceae and relatives, Ericaceae and relatives, and Balsaminaceae and relatives formed distinct clades, and the clade [Styracaceae + Diapensiaceae] was moderately (D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2007) or poorly (Albach et al. 2001b) supported. A study by Anderberg et al. (2002: five genes, both plastid and mitochondrial) suggested a beginning of resolution of \"basal\" relationships within the order (see also Geuten et al. 2004, a Bayesian analysis of some 13 kb of nucleotide sequences). In a study employing some 59 terminals, nearly 20 kb of sequences, and a variety of analyses, Schönenberger et al. (2005) suggest the family associations in the tree here (see also Duangjai et al. 2006b, rather weak [73% bootstrap] support for Lecythidaceae sister to most other Ericales; Sytsma et al. 2006), however, caution is still in order when interpreting this phylogeny. Schönenberger et al. (2005) also looked at character evolution, which now perhaps makes a little more sense, although it still shows extensive homoplasy. Independently of such studies, Barkman et al. (2004) had suggested that Mitrastemonaceae belong to Ericales, a suggestion that is followed here. Placing them next to Ericaceae and their immediate relatives in the tree is largely for convenience, although there are some similarities with that group such as extrorse anthers.\n\nThe order is made up largely of Sarracenianae, Ericanae, Primulanae, and some families in Theanae, all adjacent groups in the Dilleniidae of Takhtajan (1997). It is the asterid III group of some early phylogenetic studies.\n\nFor other information, see Grayer et al. (1999: chemistry), Jansen et al. (2004: aluminium accumulation), Ng (1991: placentation) and Lens et al. (2007b: wood anatomy, optimisation of characters on to a tree with rather different topology than that below).\n\nIncludes Actinidiaceae, Balsaminaceae, Cyrillaceae, Clethraceae, Diapensiaceae, Ebenaceae, Ericaceae, Fouquieriaceae, Lecythidaceae, Maesaceae, Marcgraviaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Myrsinaceae, Pentaphylacaceae, Polemoniaceae, Primulaceae, Roridulaceae, Sapotaceae, Sarraceniaceae, Sladeniaceae, Styracaceae, Symplocaceae, Tetrameristaceae, Theaceae, Theophrastaceae.\n\nBalsaminaceae [Marcgraviaceae + Tetrameristaceae]: myricetin +, ellagic acid 0; raphide sacs +, druses 0; lamina toothed; inflorescence racemose; stamens = and opposite sepals, anthers (near) basifixed, gynoecial nectary 0, ovules bitegmic, style short; endosperm with micropylar haustorium.\n\nWhen dry the raphide sacs are visible under the dissecting microscope as white pockets in the stem.\n\nMonophyly of these three families is well supported, and the clade is probably sister to rest of Ericales (e.g. Källersjo et al. 1998; Soltis et al. 2000; Geuten et al. 2004). If Balsaminaceae and Marcgraviaceae are sister taxa, there are no obvious synapomorphies for the family pair (Geuten et al. 2004). Pellicieraceae and Tetrameristaceae formed a well-supported clade in the morphological analysis of Luna and Ochoterena (2004), but Macgraviaceae did not join them, nor were other Ericales part of the clade; too much importance should not be given to these results.\n\nFor wood anatomy, see Lens et al. (2005b), for palynology, see Lens et al. (2005: Marcgraviaceae) and Janssens et al. (2005: the rest).\n\nBALSAMINACEAE Berchtold & J. Presl - Herbaceous; flowers vertically monosymmetric, inverting during growth; functionally abaxial sepal with prominent spur, nectary inside, adaxial C with a sepaloid keel, lateral petals connate in pairs, filaments stout, partly connate apically, anthers connate and forming cap over stigma, pollen with cellulose threads holding it to anther, grains colpate, integuments intermediate unitegmic-bitegmic [with a degree of congenital fusion]; fruit an explosive septifragal capsule, walls inrolling from base. - 2/1000. Mostly Old World, Africa (esp. Madagascar) to mountains of SE Asia.\n\nBalsaminaceae are fleshy herbs with more or less translucent stems and usually spiral, toothed leaves. The flowers are strongly monosymmetric and nearly always have a spur on the adaxial sepal, but since the flower is held upside-down the spur is on the lower (abaxial) part of the flower. The anthers cap the gynoecium and the style is at most short. The fruit is usually an explosively dehiscent capsule with the walls inrolling from the base.\n\nThe combination of non-hydrolysable tannins and raphides, both of which are found in Balsaminaceae, is rarely found in herbs (Fischer 2004). Indeed, it has been suggested that the wood is paedomorphic (Lens et al. 2005b). Balsaminaceae are vegetatively rather uniform, if florally very diverse. The flowers are protandrous. The abaxial-lateral sepal pair (non-inverted orientation) is often reduced, perhaps becoming fused with the abaxial petal (Caris et al. 2006; see also Grey-Wilson 1980b). Taxa of Impatiens with five sepals are scattered through the genus, so that condition is apparently at least sometimes derived. The cellulose threads that are produced as the anther walls break down and then retract hold the exposed pollen in a basketwork of these threads over the anther (Vogel & Cocucci 1988). A recent study by McAbee et al. (2007) shows considerable plasticisty in integument development in the family, although many species show more or less well developed congenital fusion of the integuments (and bitegmy may be derived). The micropylar endosperm haustorium is massive and may invade the funicle and even the placenta.\n\nHydrocera and Impatiens are clearly sister taxa (Janssens et al. 2006a); Hydrocera has just a single species, Impatiens conatins the rest of the family. Taxa of Impatiens with five sepals are scattered through the genus, so that condition is apparently at least sometimes derived. The current infrageneric classification of Impatiens needs complete overhaul (Janssens et al. 2006a).\n\nFor information on floral anatomy, etc., see Grey-Wilson (1980b), cellulose threads in the anthers, see Vogel and Cocucci (1988), ovule and seed development, Boesewinkel and Bouman (1991), seed morphology, Utami and Shmizu (2005: considerable variation), floral development, Caris et al. (2006a), and for general information, see Fischer (2004a).\n\nMarcgraviaceae + Tetrameristaceae: ± branched sclereids +; lamina elongating while still in bud, with obscure abaxial lines when mature.\n\nMARCGRAVIACEAE Candolle - Stomata with four subsidiary cells each oblique to the long axis of the guard cells [staurocytic]; lamina entire, surface with with marginal to abaxial cavities; inflorescence a raceme, bracts abaxially saccate, nectariferous; C ± connate; fruit with fleshy placentae; seeds many, small. - 7/130. New World tropics.\n\nMarcgraviaceae are often lianas that can be recognised by their often rather fleshy leaves with indistinct venation and minute marginal or abaxial cavities or black dots; their inflorescences have abaxially saccate bracts that function as nectaries. The fruits, with numerous small seeds borne on a fleshy, colored placenta, are distinctive. Heterophylly is common in Marcgravia, the climbing form of the plant often having orbicular leaves adpressed to the trunk.\n\nThe prominent inflorescences with nectar secreted in the cup-shaped (ascidiate) bracts attract a variety of large pollinators including humming birds and bats (e.g. Dressler 1999; Tschapka et al. 2006).\n\nThe black dots on the margin of the leaf blade make the leaf appear \"serrate\", but that character is not so much about serrations per se as about the marginal glands, etc., that terminate any serrations that are present.\n\nWard and Price (2002) suggest phylogenetic relationships within the family; Marcgravia is distinct and has several synapomorphies, e.g. environmentally-reversible heterophylly, two-ranked leaves, four-merous flowers, and nectaries adnate to abortive flowers, is distinct; furthermore, its corolla is connate and thrown off like a cap when the flowers opens. In the rest of the family both synapomorphies and generic limits are unclear.\n\nFor information, see Dressler (2004: general).\n\nTETRAMERISTACEAE Hutchinson - Petioles short; bracteoles rather large, ± caducous; K with adaxial glands, 1 ovule/carpel. - 3/5. W. Malesia, Central and N. South America.\n\nPelliciera has long, pointed terminal buds, large, axillary flowers with conspicuous petal-like bracteoles, and large, sharply-pointed, single-seeded fruits. Fluted buttresses formed by vertical series of adventitious roots form a conical mantle at the base of the trunk. Pentamerista and Tetramerista are rather small woody plants that can be recognised by their spiral, short-petiolate leaves with indistinct venation and marginal glands; there are three distinct bundles visible in the peiole scars. The flowers are rather small, the sepals and petals being rather similar and spreading; at least the sepals have glands on their adaxial surfaces.\n\nPelliciera rhizophorae is a tree in New World mangrove vegetation that used to be much more widespread there (A. Graham 1977), even being known from the Old World. For the evolution of the mangrove habitat, to which Pelliciera is restricted (it prefers less saline conditions, being found along rivers up to the limit of tidal influences), see Rhizophoraceae).\n\nIn Tetramerista there are glistening dots on the adaxial surface of both calyx and corolla.\n\nTetrameristaceae s. str. were placed in Theales by Takhtajan (1997).\n\nThe embryology, morphology and anatomy of Tetrameristaceae s.l. are poorly known. For general information, see Kobuski (1951), Tomlinson (1986), Maas and Westra (1993: all Pelliciera) and Kubitzki (2004b: the rest).\n\nOther Ericales: corolla tube well developed, style long.\n\nPolemoniaceae + Fouquieriaceae: C connate, nectary +; G [3], style strongly lobed.\n\nSchönenberger (2006a) lists many other features occurring in this family pair, including free sepals, stomata on the calyx (also e.g. Ericaceae - what is the general distribution of this feature?), stamens adnate to the corolla, and details of gynoecial development.\n\nPOLEMONIACEAE Jussieu - K connate, with a midrib with veins and paler margin, stamens = and opposite sepals, adnate to C. - 18/385: N. temperate, W. North America, South America.\n\n1. Polemonioideae Arnott - 13-22/350: Phlox (70), Linanthus (35), Navarretia (30), Polemonium (27), Gilia (25). W. North America, N. temperate region, southern South America.\n\n2. Cobaeoideae Arnott - K not differentiated. - 4/34. Baja California, tropical America.\n\n3. Acanthogilioideae J. M. Porter & L. A. Johnson - Shrubby; leaves very dimorphic, persistent branched spines on long shoots, deciduous and unlobed on short shoots; seeds winged. - 1/1: Acanthogilia gloriosa. Baja California.\n\nPolemoniaceae are herbs, or sometimes shrubs or lianas, that may be recognised by their often opposite leaves; the plant may smell unpleasant. The calyx is more or less connate, the units of which it is made up often having a green central portion, the rest being whitish. The corolla is strongly sympetalous and the five stamens are frequently inserted at different levels in the tube (not in Loeselia, Collomia, Microsteris, etc.) and/or are of different lengths. The style is usually three-lobed, the fruit is a capsule and the seeds are mucilaginous when wetted.\n\nMany Polemonioideae are more or less desert-dwelling herbs or subshrubs, and there are several cases where predominantly western North American genera have a few species in the southern part of South America. In Cobaea the leaves are tendrillar and the basal pair of leaflets is foliaceous-stipuliform.\n\nAcanthogilia has been placed in its own subfamily (Porter et al. 2000). However, its position relative to the other two subfamilies is still unclear (Johnson et al. 2008 and references). For further details of phylogenetic relationships in the family, see Johnson et al. (1999) and Porter and Johnson (1998); some generic limits need re-evaluating. Johnson et al. (2008) suggest the following relationships within Polemonioideae - [[Polemonieae (one genus) + Phlocidae] [Gilieae + Loselieae]].\n\nPolemoniaceae were included as Polemoniales in Solananae by Takhtajan (1997).\n\nFor information, see Grant and Grant (1965: floral variation), Weberling (1989: inflorescence morphology), Day and Moran (1986: description of Acanthogilia), Grant (1998: evolutionary classification), and Wilken (2004: general).\n\nFOUQUIERACEAE Candolle - Xeromorphic, with long and short shoots; leaves heteromorphic, spines developed from petioles. - 1/11. S.W. North America.\n\nFouquieriaceae are often little-branched shrubs with entire, spiral leaves, well developed short shorts, and petiolar spines on the long shoots. The flowers have free and almost scarious sepals but a strongly connate corolla; the ten or more stamens are free from the corolla. The style is three-lobed.\n\nLayers of fibrous cells alternate with layers of cork cells in the stem cork, while the cork cambium in the root is described as being superficial (Henrickson 1969), an unusual position for angiosperms although perhaps commoner in desert plants and epiphytes than elsewhere. The perianth parts are borne in a distinct spiral, and the antepetalous stamens may be doubled (Schönenberger & Grenhagen 2005).\n\nFouquieriaceae were placed in Violales by Cronquist (1981).\n\nFor relationships within the family, see Schultheis and Baldwin (1999).\n\nSee Kubitzki (2004b) for general information.\n\nLECYTHIDACEAE A.

Foetidioideae Engler - SiO2 bodies +; C 0, placentae peltate. - 1/17. E. Africa to Mauritius.\n\nLecythidaceae are difficult to characterise. They are usually trees with spiral leaves borne in tufts at the ends of the branches, but the leaves can also be two-ranked and scattered along the stem. The leaves are minutely stipulate and/or the margins are serrate. The flowers are often large and have free petals or what appear to be petals. The numerous (up to 1200!) stamens are free to connate; when connate, they may form a complex, cochleate structure that obscures the style and top of the ovary. The ovary is inferior and crowned by the persistent valvate calyx.\n\nMonosymmetric Lecythidoideae are pollinated largely by euglossine bees and several taxa have fodder pollen usually produced by the anthers in the hood, but sometimes by some of those in the ring; nectar is also found in some of these taxa (Prance & Mori 1979; Mori & Prance 1990); details of floral development, incuding the origin of monosymmetry, are to be found placed in a phylogenetic context in Tsou and Mori (2007). Monosymmetric flowers of Lecythidoideae are unlike those of any other angiosperm, with the monosymmetry primarily being evident in the massive development of the abaxial part of the staminal ring that leads to the production of the sometimes complexly coiled hood into which bees force their way. A rather close evolutionary association between euglossine bees and these monosymmetric Lecthyidoideae has been suggested (e.g. Mori & Boeke 1987: Note that monosymmetrtric flowers are not an apomorphy for Lecythidoideae.) Polysymmetric Lecythidoideae are pollinated by a variety of bees, other than euglossines. Napoleonaea vogelii pollination and floral morphology has been described in detail (Frame & Durou 2001). Despite the size of the flower, pollination by thrips is suggested; there are also nectaries inside the flowers at the bases of some of the staminodes and also on the outside of the calyx. Seeds of Lecythidoideae are probably mostly dispersed by mammals, especially primates.\n\nThere is banded apotracheal parenchyma (c.f. Sapotaceae!). There are also crystals in the axial parenchyma, as is common in several other Ericales, but wood anatomy suggests little about groupings within Lecythidaceae and relationships of the family (c.f. Lens et al. 2007b). Ditsch and Barthlott (1994) suggested that the rather dimorphic wax platelets of Asteranthos differ from those of Scytopetalaceae, but such platelets also occur in some species of Barringtonia (c.f. their figs 26, 27, 29), so are not out of place in Lecythidaceae. The exact nature of the petal-like structures in the flower is still a matter of discussion. There is both centripetal and centrifugal androecial development in the family.\n\nRelationships: [Napoleonaeoideae [Scytopetal-likeeae [Lecythidoideae [Planchonoideae + Foetidioideae]]]] - see Morton et al. (1998) and Mori et al. (2007). Crateranthus is placed in Napoleonaeoideae, and although in morphology, including androecium, Asteranthos is similar, yet its sequence data align it with Scytopetal-likeeae... Although an extended Lecythidaceae can more or less be characterised, Lecythidaceae in the strict sense, that is, Lecythidoideae plus Planchonioideae plus Foetidioideae, cannot. There is currently no evidence for particular sister group relationships between Lecythidaceae and any Ericalean clades, although they are definitely not sister to the Balsaminaceae clade (Schönenberger et al. 2005).\n\nScytopetalaceae were considered quite distinct until recently (e.g. Cronquist 1981, in Theales; Takhtajan 1997, in Ochnales [both Dilleniidae]).\n\nFor more information, see Appel (1996: Scytopetal-likeeae), Tsou (1994: embryology) and Tsou and Mori (2002: seed coat in Lecythidoideae), Takhtajan (1992: endothelium and testa vasculature); for recent general summaries, see Appel (2004: Scytopetalaceae), Prance (2004: Napoleonaeceae), Prance and Mori (2004: Lecythidaceae s. str.), and Scott Mori's The Lecythidaceae Pages (Lecythidoideae only).\n\nSladeniaceae + Pentaphylacaceae: hairs unicellular; C ± campanulate, only basally connate, fairly small [petals 1³ cm long]; A basifixed, not articulated, nectary 0, placentae becoming ± swollen; fruit a capsule, columella persistent; endosperm +.\n\nSome recent work (Geuten et al. 2004) suggests that [Pentaphylacaceae + Sladeniaceae] are sister to Maesaceae and related families. Luna and Ochoterena (2004) were unable to recover any strongly supported relationships in this area in a morphological phylogenetic analysis.\n\nSLADENIACEAE Airy Shaw - Inflorescence cymose, branches widely spreading; flowers small; A opening apically. - 2/3. S.E. Asia, tropical E. Africa.\n\nSladeniaceae are evergreen trees with serrate, exstipulate leaves and distinctive axillary cymose inflorescences. The flowers are small, being less than 5 mm long.\n\nSladenia is poorly known. It was included in Theaceae (e.g. as Sladenioideae - Takhtajan 1997), and is sister to Pentaphylacaceae in rbcL studies (Savolainen et al. 2000b: as Ternstroemiaceae). Ficalhoa is even more poorly known; although it lacks sclereids like Sladenia, the two were not associated in anatomical studies (especially Deng & Baas 1991). They do come out as sister taxa in some recent molecular analyses (Anderberg et al. 2002), although Schönenberger et al. (2005) did not find support for this clade. Li et al. (2003) have recently described a number of very distinctive embryological, etc., features for Sladenia, including monocot wall development; it will be interesting to see if Ficalhoa is similar in these respects. Sladenia has porose anthers, while in Ficalhoa the anthers open across the apex.\n\nFor general information, see Stevens and Weitzman (2004).\n\nPENTAPHYLACACEAE Engler - Inflorescence of axillary flowers or fasciculate; mesotesta well developed; embryo U-shaped. - 12/337. Tropical and subtropical, but few in Africa.\n\n1. Pentaphylaceae - Stamens 5, opposite sepals, filaments very broad, narrowed and incurved apically, theacae each opening by a valve that lifts up, 2 apical ovules/carpel; loculicidal capsules with midrib [\"teeth\"] separating from rest of the valve; mesotestal cells thin-walled; cotyledons longer than radicle. - 1/1: Pentaphylax euryoides.

Tropics, esp. Malesia and Central to South America, in W. Africa only 2 species.\n\n3. Frezierieae - Sclereids little branched; fruit a berry; seeds many, <4(-6) mm long, brown or black, sclerified mesotesta 1-5 cells across. - 9/233: Adinandra (80), Eurya (75), Freziera (57). SE Asia to Malesia, Hawai'i,Central to South America, E. Africa (Balthasaria) and Canaries (Visnea).\n\nPentaphylacaceae are shrubs or trees that often have two-ranked, serrate leaves which may remain rolled up as they elongate, so the lower surface of the blade has longitudinal markings. The flowers are medium-sized to smallish, and the numerous stamens usually have short filaments and long, basifixed anthers. The fruit, which has a persistent calyx, is usually a berry, and the embryo is curved.\n\nWhen the shoot of Pentaphylax does not develop expanded leaves after the flowers appear, it appears that it has a racemose inflorescence. Although the margins of the leaf blades of Pentaphylax are entire, they, the bracts, and some sepals, are terminated by blackish, deciduous and probably glandular points, rather similar to those found in the rest of the Pentaphylacaceae. The reports of an aril in Ternstroemieae (e.g. Keng 1962) are incorrect; there is a sarcotesta which may, by its expansion, aid in the irregular rupture of the fruit. Ternstroemia itself, with its pseudoverticillate and usually entire leaves, can look rather unlike other Pentaphylacaceae. Freziera shows considerable variation in nodal anatomy, stomatal morphology, seed type and pollen surface (Weitzman 1987). A few Pentaphylacaceae such as Cleyera have quite long filaments - up to five times longer than the anthers.\n\nFor general information, see Weitzman et al. (2004, as Ternstroemiaceae), for pollen, see Wei (1997), for a phylogeny that includes Theaceae s. str. and a few other Ericales, see Yang et al. (2006: relationships unclear).\n\nSapotaceae [Ebenaceae [Maesaceae [Theophrastaceae [Myrsinaceae + Primulaceae]]]]: ellagic acid 0; C connate. - [Back to Index]\n\nSapotaceae and Maesaceae and relatives were sister taxa (89% bootstrap) in a six-gene study focussing on Ebenaceae (Duangjai et al. 2006b); the latter was part of a polytomy including many other Ericales. However, Geuten et al. (2004) suggested that [Pentaphylacaceae + Sladeniaceae] were sister to Maesaceae and related families.\n\nSAPOTACEAE Jussieu - Plant with latex [gutta]; T-shaped hairs +; stamens = and opposite the petals, ovary hairy; fruit a berry; seed coat multiplicative, hard, shiny, outer part with isodiametric much-lignified cells, with large hilum. - 53/975.

Pantropical.\n\n3. Chrysophylloideae Luersson - Stipules 0; endosperm copious, cotyledons foliaceous. - 25/550: Pouteria (200-305: inc. Planchonella), Chrysophyllum (80), Micropholis (38). Pantropical.\n\nSapotaceae are woody plants that may be recognized by their rather small, naked terminal buds with adpressed, brownish, often T-shaped unicellular hairs, axillary branches often with prominent, basal prophyllar buds and then long internodes, leaf blades that tend to have rather closely parallel secondary veins and entire margins, and petioles that are bottle-shaped when alive. Prophylls seem to be basal on axillary shoots even when growth is sylleptic, i.e., the axillary shoots are developing without an obvious rest period. The twigs usually exude copious latex. The flowers, with their persistent sepals and often protruding style, are distinctive, as are their seeds, which are large and have a thick, shiny, brown testa with a very large, pale-coloured hilum.\n\nThe flowers are sometimes described as being up to 6-merous, i.e. following the number of sepals in a single whorl, however, petals, androecium and gynoecium must then be considered to have doubled in number; see Pennington (2004) for a good summary of floral variation. Swenson and Anderberg (2005) suggest that the basic floral morphology of the family is K5, C5; A 5 + 5 staminodes, and that the staminodes common in Chrysophylloideae, but derived within the clade, are perhaps not immediately comparable with those of other members of the family; the former are outside the staminal whorl while the latter are in the same whorl as the stamens. Floral variation in the family is considerable and most characters are very homoplasious, including the occurrence of anisomerous flowers in which the corolla and stamens in particular are more numerous than would be predicted just by looking at sepal number alone and thinking of a normal isomerous flower in which the number of parts stand in a simple relationship to one another (e.g. Swenson et al. 2008a, c).\n\nSarcosperma is sister to the rest of the family; there are then two major clades, [Isonandreae + Mimusopeae + Sideroxyleae] and [Chrysophylleae + Omphalocarpeae] (Anderberg & Swenson 2003). The inclusion of Xantolis, which tends to group with the latter clade in many analyses, weakens support for this otherwise strongly supported clade; the two major clades were later recognised formally as the subfamilies Sapotoideae and Chrysophylloideae (Swenson & Anderberg 2005). Morphological characters are highly homoplasious, more so than the molecular data, and characters for the subfamilies are hard to come by. Smedmark et al. (2006) outline details of relationships and character evolution in Sapotoideae; Swenson et al. (2007a, 2008) discuss generic limits in the monophyletic Australasian Chrysophylloideae, Swenson et al. (2007b) focus on Planchonella and Swenson et al. (2008c) on its sister group, the New Caledonian Niemeyera complex. For relationships among the monophyletic group of ca 80 species of the Pouteria (Chrysophylleae) complex on New Caledonia and islands in the southwest Pacific, perhaps including some species from New Guinea, see Bartish et al. (2005); Pouteria sensu Pennington is polyphyletic (Triono et al. 2007). In Sideroxylon (Sapotoideae) there seems to have been ancient hybridization 43-36.6 Ma between a representative of a basically African clade and of a basically American clade (see also Swenson et al. 2008a for comparable hybridization in Chrysophyllum). The descendents, previously segregated as Nesoluma and found on very young islands in the Pacific, may have persisted hopping from island to island ever since (Smedmark & Anderberg 2007); for other taxa perhaps behaving similarly, see Hillebrandia (Begoniaceae), Psiloxylum (Myrtaceae), etc.\n\nGeneric limits have been notoriously fickle in Sapotaceae, and have depended on which particular character was emphasized: \"it is difficult to understand how two authors working on the same family could have come to such widely different conclusions\" (Pennington 1990, p. 29), but Pennington himself (1991) clarified things somewhat and molecular data are providing much further information. Clade limits in e.g. New Caledonian Sapotaceae are now becoming clear enough so that species can at last be described in their appropriate genera (Swenson et al. 2008c).\n\nEbenaceae [Maesaceae [Theophrastaceae [Myrsinaceae + Primulaceae]]]: ?\n\nEBENACEAE Gürcke - Leaves two-ranked, margins entire, flat glands on lower surface; plant dioecious, inflorescence cymose; C contorted; A 2x K, adnate to C, 2 pendulous ovules/carpel; fruit a berry; testa vascularized. - 4/548. Tropical (to temperate).\n\n1. Lissocarpoideae Wallnöfer - Plant glabrous; pollen triporate; ovary inferior. - 1/8. Tropical South America.\n\n2. Diospyroideae Thorne & Reveal - 3/540: Diospyros (500). Tropical (to temperate).\n\nEbenaceae are woody plants that may be recognised by their usually two-ranked, entire leaves that may have flat, dark-colored glands on the lower surface of the blade. The corolla is contorted. In Diospyros and relatives the flower buds have adpressed brown indumentum (sometimes of T-shaped hairs) and are distinctively pointed; the calyx is usually much accrescent in fruit. The bark, even of twigs, is black, its undersurface is yellow; the heartwood is also black and the leaves, too, may dry blackish - because of the naphthoquinones that are common in the family. The flowers of Lissocarpa are glabrous and have a rather narrow sympetalous corolla and an inferior ovary below which are two well-developed bracteoles.\n\nThere is considerable variation in growth patterns in the family, starting with the seedlings. When cotyledons are foliaceous, subsequent leaves are \"alternate\", when cotyledons are thick, the next leaves are opposite. The terminal bud of each innovation frequently aborts. Both Massart's model (growth rythmic, branches monopodial) and variants (e.g. Roux's model - continuous branching) occur in Diospyros.\n\nLissocarpa is well supported (rbcL only) as sister to Ebenaceae s. str. (Berry et al. 2001), with which it also has much morphologically in common, so it is reasonable to combine the two. However, the genus is poorly known and I do not know of details of its chemistry, so whether the presence of naphthoquinones is a synapomorphy of Ebenaceae as a whole or just part of them remains to be established. Duangjai et al. (2006b), sequencing six plastid genes, found extensive phylogenetic structure in the rest of the family; the African(-Arabian) Euclea and Royena were sister to Diospyros, and within Diospyros there were a number of well-supported clades, although relationships between them are unclear. Duangjai et al. (2006b) outlined generic characterisations.\n\nFor information, see Wallnöfer (2001, 2004a: general; 2004b: revision of Lissocarpa), Francheschi (1993: general, also related families).\n\nMaesaceae [Theophrastaceae [Myrsinaceae + Primulaceae]]: schizogenous secretory canals +; (stomata anisocytic); small ± immersed often peltate glandular hairs +; inflorescence racemose; C and A from common primordia, stamens = and opposite C, nectary +; G [5], placentation free-central, ovules at least partly immersed in swollen placenta, bitegmic, endothelium +, style short, stigma ± capitate; seeds angled; endotesta crystalliferous; endosperm nuclear, copious, cell walls thick, amyloid or hemicellulosic.\n\nMembers of this group are not often eaten by butterfly larvae, but Lycaenidae-Riodininae-Hamearini and a few Riodinini (see also Abisara) are found on them, especially on Maesaceae but not so far on Samolus and Theophrastaceae (Ehrlich & Raven 1964).\n\nThe monophyly of the group is not in doubt (see especially Källersjö et al. 2000: note that support values for Samolus as sister to Theophrastaceae s. str. are reduced when morphological data are added to molecular), and it was often recognised as Primulales in the past (Plumbaginaceae [see Caryophyllales] were also often associated with it because of similar placentation and stamen arrangement). Perhaps the only question, particularly in light of the break-up of Primulaceae, the removal of Maesa from Myrsinaceae, the placement/addition of Samolus as sister to/within Theophrastaceae, the many herbaceous taxa perhaps sister to the old-style, woody Myrsinaceae, and the many features shared by the group as a whole, is whether it is worth recognising families at all... Subfamilial names are already available. For general morphology, see Anderberg et al. (2000) and especially Ståhl and Anderberg (2004).\n\nThere is variation in nodal anatomy in this clade, although there is no good survey for this feature. Maesa has trilacunar nodes, although many Myrsinaceae are unilacunar, some are trilacunar, Samoulus is probably unilacunar, while within the multilacunar Theophrastaceae s. str, Jacquinia is unilacunar, the trace immediately dividing into three. Details of the secretory system - most evident as the blackish to pellucid punctations in the leaves of many members of this clade - also need study. For reports of glandular dots on calyx and corolla of Theophrastaceae, see Mabberley (1997); Ståhl (2004) suggests that a secretory system is present, if not always conspicuous in that family, while Solereder (1908) reported that secretory tissues occur in Androsace (Primulaceae). Although the presence of staminodes is shown as an apomorphy of [Samolus + Theophrastaceae] here, Saunders (1936) suggested that some of the lobing of the corolla of Soldanella might be staminodial, and Lysimachia section Seleucia may have evascularized staminodes.\n\nFor staminodes, Caris and Smets (2004: those of Samolus and Theophrastaceae are developmentally rather different), for nectar secretion, see Vogel (1986, 1997) and Caris and Smets (2004), for wood anatomy, see Lens et al. (2005a), and for floral morphology and ontogeny, Dickson (1936: esp. gynoecial arrangement), Sattler (1962), Sundberg (1982), Ronse Decraene (1992), and especially Ma and Saunders (2003).\n\nMAESACEAE Anderberg, B. Ståhl & Kallersjö - Stamen primordium smaller than petal primordium, ovary inferior. - 1/150. Old World tropics to Japan, the Pacific, and Australia.\n\nMaesaceae are often rather small woody plants that can be recognised by their serrate, exstipulate leaves that often lack much venation, even when dry, and which have well-developed and conspicuous canals in the leaf blades, sepals and petals. The small, obviously bracteolate flowers have a connate corolla, stamens opposite the petals and an inferior ovary; the many-seeded fruit is drupaceous.\n\nThe ovules are separated by and partly sunken in placental tissue (see also Utteridge & Saunders 2001).\n\nFor floral development, see also Caris et al. (2000), for a general account, see Stôhl and Anderberg (2004).\n\nTheophrastaceae [Myrsinaceae + Primulaceae]: herbs[?]; rays ³5-seriate, uniseriate rays 0; bracteoles 0; stamen primordium larger than petal primordium, C imbricate, subrotate, tube rather short.\n\nFor the suggestion that rosette herbs may be the plesiomorphic condition for this part of the clade, see Anderberg et al. (2001); however, Lens et al. (2005a) find no evidence from wood anatomy that this is likely (apart from in a few Myrsinaceae). Note that in Myrsinaceae, herbaceous taxa such as Stimpsonia, Ardisiandra and Coris may form a paraphyletic basal complex. Variation in habit is very extensive in this clade as a whole, woody plants having lower rates of molecular change than herbaceous (Smith & Donoghue 2008).\n\nTHEOPHRASTACEAE Link - Bracts displaced up the pedicels; staminodes +, petal-like. - 5/105. Mostly New World and tropical, some also more temperate and Old World.\n\n1. Samolus - G semi-inferior. - 1/15. America, the Antipodes, Europe, tropical to temperate.\n\n2. The Rest (Theophrastaceae s. str.) - Shrubs; anthers extrorse, with calcium oxalate; seeds rounded. - 4/90. New World tropics.\n\nTheophrastaceae have sympetalous flowers with five stamens opposite the petals and five, petal-like staminodes opposite the sepals. Most taxa are woody plants with broad rays and often pseudoverticillate leaves with toothed or spiny margins or a sharp, pungent apex. The extrorse anthers form a cone in the center of the flower when it opens, but later spread; the staminodes are more or less petal-like. The subepidermal fibers are visible in the dried leaf as fine striations - use a hand lens!\n\nThe subepidermal fibres may lack lignification. The ovules completely cover the placenta, but fingers of placental tissue may poke up between them in Samolus, although this was not evident in the material examined by Caris and Smets (2004); Ma and Saunders (2003) suggest that in this whole clade (i.e. Theophrastaceae s.l.) the ovules are not embedded, and this feature would then be a synapomorphy for it. The valves of the capsule are opposite the calyx (Caris & Smets 2004).\n\nKällersjö and Ståhl (2003) suggest that some generic realignments are needed.\n\nFor general accounts, see Ståhl (2004: as Theophrastaceae and Samolaceae).\n\nPrimulaceae + Myrsinaceae: ?\n\nPRIMULACEAE Borkhausen - Secretory canals 0; inflorescence scapose. - 9/900: Primula (490-600), Androsace (160). Northern hemisphere, scattered elsewhere.\n\nPrimulaceae are usually rosette herbs with a scapose inflorescence and medium-sized flowers with connate sepals, obviously connate petals, hypocrateriform corolla and stamens borne opposite the corolla lobes; the placentation is free-central and the capsular fruits have numerous, angular seeds.\n\nHeterostyly is common in Primulaceae, although it is unlikely to be an apomorphy for the family; it is sometimes lost, as in those Primula with buzz pollination, the erstwhile Dodecatheon (Mast et al. 2001, 2006). For relationships within Primula, see also Trift et al. (2002) and Mast et al. (2004), Cortusa and Dionysia will probably also have to be included; for relationships within Androsace, see Wang et al. (2004) and Schneeweiss et al. (2004b), Douglasia will probably have to be included. Richards (2003) provides a good general account of Primula s. str.\n\nFor pollen variation, see Mast et al. (2001), and for general morphology, see Anderberg (2004).\n\nMYRSINACEAE R. Brown - 41/1435: Ardisia (450), Myrsine (155: inc. Rapanea, Suttonia, many species in the Pacific), Lysimachia (150), Discocalyx (115: inc. Tapeinosperma), Embelia (100), Parathesis (85), Stylogyne (60). Pantropical and N. Temperate.\n\nMyrsinaceae are trees to herbs, and many have distinctive yellowish to blackish dots or streaks on the often spiral leaves and also often obvious on the persistent calyx and on the fruit - but not in genera like Trientalis, Anagallis or Cyclamen, or in some Lysimachia. The sympetalous corolla is often contorted, the five stamens are antepetalous, the ovary is superior, and the ovules and/or seeds are immersed in the placenta. In many woody taxa the point of insertion of the branches on the main stem is vertically elongated; growth is often sylleptic.\n\nVogel (1986) discusses pollination, which in a group of yellow-flowered Lysimachia in particular is by oil-collecting Macropis (Mellitidae) bees (see also Simpson et al. 1983); the oil is secreted by trichomes. However, species of Lysimachia with white flowers have nectariferous hairs (for a phylogeny that focuses on Lysimachia, see Hao et al. 2004). Anderberg et al. (2007) suggested that Lysimachia with buzz-pollinated flowers and those with nectar-producing hairs both formed separate clades and were both derived from oil-producing ancestors. At least some species of Myrsine may be anemophilous (Otegui & Cocucci 1999).\n\nThe Malesian mangrove genus Aegiceras has a number of anomalous anatomical and morphological features, and the seed characters in particular are those that might be expected from a mangrove plant since seeds lack endosperm and contain a large, viviparous embryo (Ståhl & Anderberg 2004; Lens et al. 2005). Some species of Ardisia have pustules along the edge of the leaf blade; although inhabited by bacteria, it is unclear what role these bacteria might be playing (Miller 1990).\n\nMyrsinaceae include all those members (other than Samolus) of the old Primulaceae that have non-scapose inflorescence (Anderberg et al. 2000, 2001; limits of Myrsinaceae not so clear in Martins et al. 2003, but ITS data alone). Coris and Ardisiandra are successively sister to the rest of the family and with strong support in the three gene plus morphology analysis of Källersjö et al. (2000). Anderberg et al (2007) studied the relationships of the herbaceous taxa; the family had moderate support as being monophyletic (72% jacknife), and Cyclamen, the herbaceous taxa, and the woody taxa then formed a trichotomy. Generic limits in the woody members in particular are unsatisfactory, but the limits of genera like Lysimachia are also unclear (Anderberg et al. 2007); Oh et al. (2008) looked at seed morphology of these latter taxa.\n\nCoris is a particularly distinctive genus. It is a small, ericoid, sub-shrub with monosymmetric flowers that have a spine-tipped epicalyx. There is nectary at the base of the ovary and there are only 5-6 ovules. Monosymmetry is expressed early in development by the calyx, monosymmetry of the corolla becomes evident only later (Ronse Decraene et al. 1995). Cyclamen has one cotyledon and one integument. In morphological analyses it tends to group with Dodecatheon (= Primula) probably because both taxa have flowers with the distinctive buzz pollination syndrome. It (and Aegiceras) have unitegmic ovules.\n\nFor information, see Ståhl and Anderberg (2004: general) and Lens et al. (2005a: wood anatomy).\n\nMitrastemonaceae + Theaceae + Symplocaceae, etc. + Ericaceae, etc.: ?\n\nAlong with Cytinaceae and Rafflesiaceae, relationships with of Mitrastemonaceae to Malvales have also been suggested (Nickrent 2002). Barkman et al. (2004) use mitochondrial sequences to place Mitrastemonaceae in Ericales, a position that appeared in most analyses in Nickrent et al. (2004: for further discussion, see Rafflesiaceae). Its cellular endosperm is certainly compatible with a position in Asterids, and its extrorse anthers are perhaps comparable with those of Ericaceae and their relatives. Since its parietal placentation is found in many other parasitic angiosperms, as well as in the echlorophyllous hyperparasitic Ericaceae-Monotropoideae, this is not necessarily a taxonomically informative character.\n\nMITRASTEMONACEAE Makino - Endophytic root parasites; leaves opposite, scale-like; flowers quite large, single; P 4, connate, stamens extrorse, completely connate and surrounding gynoecium except for small apical pore, polythecate, pollen 2-aperturate; G with 9-20 intrusive parietal placentae, ovules very numerous, style stout, stigma hemispherical; fruit berry-like, circumscissile; funicle sticky; embryo unorganised, 4-celled. - 1/2. South East Asia to Malesia, Central America, N.W. South America, scattered.\n\nMitrastemonaceae are root parasites, often found on Fagaceae, with opposite, scale-like leaves. The single, terminal flowers are surrounded at the base by the perianth, the stamens are completely connate, forming a conspicuous cone entirely surrounding the gynoecium except for a terminal opening, and the anthers are extrorse. The ovary has parietal placentation and the fruit contains many minute seeds.\n\nFor general information (including a more extensive list of hosts) and references, see Meijer and Veldkamp (1993), also the Parasitic Plants website (Nickrent 1998 onwards) and also Heide-Jørgensen (2008).\n\nTheaceae + Symplocaceae, etc., + Ericaceae, etc.: ? - [Back to Index]\n\nTHEACEAE Ker Gawler - A many. - Ca 9/195(-460!). Mostly South East Asia-Malesia, also S.E. U.S.A.\n\n1. Theeae Szyszylowicz - Pedicels multibracteolate, bracteoles calyx and corolla all intergrading; capsule with columella; seeds winged or not; n = 15. - 5/. Southeast Asia, Malesia, tropical America.\n\n2. Gordonieae de Candolle - Capsule with columella; seeds apically winged. - 3/. Southeast Asia, West Malesia, S.E. United States.\n\n3. Stewartieae Choisy - 1/9. East Asia, E. North America.\n\nTheaceae are shrubs or trees that are recognised by their quite thick and serrate exstipulate leaves that often turn red just before falling. The plant has sclereids that may be visible as minute punctations, e.g. in the leaf blades. The flowers are usually medium-sized to large, and the bracteoles, calyx and corolla are quite often in a single spiral and are not clearly distinguishable one from another. The numerous stamens have quite long filaments and short, dorsifixed anthers. The fruit is usually capsular and with a columella, and the seeds, often flattened, have straight embryos.\n\nCamellia has bisporic, eight-nucleate embryo sacs, and pseudopollen is produced from connective; I do not know how widely either feature occurs in the family.\n\nGeneric limits in Theaceae are difficult, and family relationships are still poorly understood (for useful notes on the genera, see Prince 2007). An analysis of two chloroplast genes by Prince and Parks (2001) suggests that there are three major clades within the family and that Polyspora and Laplacea should be separated from Gordonia (see also Yang et al. 2004, 2006). However, the relationships between the three clades is unclear, different genes suggesting different arrangements.\n\nTheaceae s.l. have in the past been associated with Asteropeiaceae (e.g. Takhtajan 1997), for which, see Lecythidaceae. Pentaphylacaceae, Sladeniaceae and Pellicieraceae, erstwhile Theaceae, are all separate families here; Pentaphylacaceae, often recognised as a monotypic family (see e.g. A.P.G. 1998) are here expanded to include Ternstroemiaceae, also part of or adjacent to the old Theaceae.\n\nFor further information, see Keng (1962: general), Grote and Dilcher (1989: fossil record), Liang and Baas (1991: anatomy), Tsou (1995, 1997, 1998: embryology), Wei (1997: pollen), Stevens et al. (2004b: general), and Wang et al. (2006: Apterosperma, chromosomes and morphology).\n\nSymplocaceae [Styracaceae + Diapensiaceae]: inflorescence racemose; endosperm copious.\n\nSYMPLOCACEAE Desfontaines - C basally connate; A many, ovary inferior. - 1/320. Tropical to subtropical, inc. New Caledonia, not Africa.\n\nSymplocaceae are shrubs or trees that can be recognised by their serrate, exstipulate leaves which often dry yellowish (the petioles may be purplish when alive) and racemose inflorescences with rather small flowers. The petals are only basally connate, there are often many stamens, and the ovary is inferior - indeed, the flowers look superficially rather like those of Rosaceae-Maloideae. The fruit is drupaceous and the stone has germination pores.\n\nThe style just below the stigma secretes oil in the ca 145 species of Symplocos sect. Symplocastrum, and the oil probably helps the pollen stick to the pollinators (Kriebel et al. 2007); this seems to be unique in flowering plants.\n\nFor a phylogeny of the genus, see Y. Wang et al. (2004) and Fritsch et al. (2006, 2008); section Cordyloblaste appears to be sister to the rest. The current infrageneric taxonomy needs reworking, but it has been suggested that two genera should be recognised in the family (Fritsch et al. 2008).\n\nThe androecium has been interpreted as being basically obdiplostemonous (Caris et al. 2002).\n\nFor testa anatomy, see Corner (1976) and Huber (1991), and for general information, see Nooteboom (2004).\n\nStyracaceae + Diapensiaceae: cork cambium pericyclic; glandular hairs 0; anther basifixed, style continuous with ovary, hollow; fruit a capsule.\n\nSTYRACACEAE Candolle & Sprengel - Hairs stellate; K open, ovary slightly inferior, hairs inside the carpel loculi. - 11/160: Styrax (120 - benzoin, gum bejamin [sic]). Warm N. temperate to tropical.\n\nStyracaceae may be recognised by their stellate or lepidote indumentum; spiral, serrate, exstipulate leaves; and sympetalous flowers with a more or less completely connate and/or small calyx and a more or less inferior ovary. The filaments are stout and not sharply distinguished from the anthers.\n\nVan Steenis (1949b) illustrates the remarkable galls found on Malesian species of Styrax. There is a rather close association between the aphids involved (Cerataphidinae) and individual species of Styrax; the morphology of the galls is ultimately determined by the aphids (Cerataphidinae also produce soldiers - Stern 1995; Stern & Foster 1996).\n\nThe floral vasculature suggests that although the stamens are in a single whorl, they are basically obdiplostemonous (Dickison 1993).\n\nFor relationships within Styracaceae, see Fritsch et al. (2001) and within Styrax Fritsch (2001). The main phylogenetic structure in the family is [[Huodendron + Styrax] [[Alniphyllum + Bruinsmia] The Rest]]; both main clades, especially the second, are well supported. Members of the former clade have entire leaf blades, members of the latter have dentate blades, an inferior ovary, and bud scales, with the exception of the Alniphyllum + Bruinsmia clade which differs from The Rest on all three counts. For possible additional synapomorphies for Styracaceae, see Fritsch et al. (2001).\n\nFor general information, see Fritsch (2004).\n\nDIAPENSIACEAE Lindley - Herbs; secondary wood rays 0; stamens = and opposite sepals, anthers ± incurved, thecae horizontal. - 6/18. Arctic and N. temperate, esp. East Asia and E. U.S.A.\n\nDiapensiaceae are herbs or subshrubs with moderately-sized and weakly sympetalous flowers; the five stamens with their flattened filaments alternate with the petals and the anthers are incurved. There are usually staminodes, the stigma is shortly three-lobed, and the fruit is a loculicidal capsule with small seeds.\n\nFriis (1985) described Actinocalyx from the Upper Cretaceous of Sweden. It has a number of similarities with extant Diapensiaceae, although the anthers are rather different, the pollen is smaller (7-9.5 µm, versus 17-40 µm), and the styles are separate. The mycorrhizal association in Diapensiaceae may be a distinctive ectendomycorrhiza as is found in many Ericaceae (Asai 1934).\n\nGalax and Pyxidanthera are successively sister taxa to the rest of the family (Rönblom & Anderberg 2002); if these relationships hold, the presence of staminodes is a derived feature within the family. This will also be true of the formation of the floral tube by the andation of the broad filaments to petals on either side, which does not occur in Diapensia; there the filaments are connate.\n\nDiapensiaceae have often been considered close to Ericaceae because of apparent similarities in their androecia, but the anthers of some genera of the former family which appear to be inverted, are not.\n\nFor general information, see Scott (2004), for pollen and a morphological phylogeny, see Xi and Tang (1990).\n\n[Sarraceniaceae [Actinidiaceae + Roridulaceae]] [Clethraceae [Cyrillaceae + Ericaceae]]: anthers extrorse, inverting during development, opening by pores or short slits, endothelium +, style impressed; exotesta with strongly thickened inner walls; endosperm copious.\n\nSarraceniaceae [Actinidiaceae + Roridulaceae]: route I secoiridoids +; no nectary surrounding base of ovary.\n\nSARRACENIACEAE Dumortier - Insectivorous rosette herbs; leaves with pitchers, bases broad; pollen 5+ colporoidate. - 3/ca 15. E. and W. U.S.A. and the Guyana Highlands.\n\nSarraceniaceae are herbaceous, insectivorous pitcher plants. The pitchers are long, with short petioles, and are borne in a rosette. The flowers are quite large, with free sepals and petals, the former being petal-like, and usually numerous stamens; the style is either branched or peltate. The capsules have many small seeds.\n\nArchaeamphora has been attributed to Sarraceniaceae and described from rocks ca 124 Ma old (Li 2005).\n\nLarvae of the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii live in the pitchers of Sarracenia, and the mosquito shows subtle adaptations to both photoperiod and temperature throughout its considerable latitudinal range. There are nectar glands on the pitcher which attract insects that fall into the pitcher and drown - alternatively, the nectar may take up water increasing the possibility of the insect's hydroplaning into the pitcher (see Bauer et al. 2008). The pitcher varies in the amount of digestive enzymes it contains, in Sarracenia purpurea, for example, there are few enzymes and nutrients from the entrapped animales are made available to the plant by the activity of detritivores that break up the prey that is further decomposed by bacteria, in turn eaten by rotifers and protozoa and ultimately by mosquito larvae - all forming a microcosm in the liquid of each pitcher (Ellison et al. 2003; Butler & Ellison 2007). Caterpillars of the moth Exyra fax drain the pitchers by opening up a hole at the base; they then eat the pitcher. Species of Exyra eat Sarracenia throughout its range. For general information on carnivory, see especially Lloyd (1942) and Juniper et al. (1989).\n\nFlowers of Heliamphora lack a nectary and are buzz po"
