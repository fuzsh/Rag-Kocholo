Fruit drupaceous. Grown for both the ornamental fls. and clusters of colored fruits. In Verbenaceae (Hortus Third 1976:201) Cymes small, many-fld., fls. small, corolla infundibular or salverform, stamens exserted. Fruit a small bead-like drupe.

Throughout the East used medicinally, some internally, others in poulticing. Several spp. of Am. are active diuretics & purgatives. Wood of little use. Malayan spp. mostly have similar medicinal uses. Names such as ‘tampang’ indicates the plants are used to make plasters; such names occur as far E as the Philippines. 3 spp. which contain a saponin are used as fish-poisons in the Philippines. Interesting that twigs of two of them, dried until the lvs. have fallen, are used as bait for prawns.
