        "text": "Callicarpa longifolia Lamk. var. floccosa Schauer 1847 is a perennial shrub of genus Callicarpa and family Lamiaceae (Chen and Michael 1994, Li et al. 2016). It is mainly distributed in southwestern China, India, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This species has high ornamental value with clustered white, purple or red berries, and also has certain medicinal value. In this study, the chloroplast (cp) genome characteristics of C. longifolia var. floccose were assembled and described for the first time. It will provide valuable resources for further study of genetic conservation, evolution, and molecular breeding studies in the genus of Callicarpa L.\n\nFresh leaves of C. longifolia var. floccose was collected from Pengshui County of Chongqing, China (N29°00′47.85″, E107°52′31.09″, 553 m). The voucher specimen (CY Wang PS 20191002) was deposited in the herbarium of Southwest University (SWCTU, Qian Wang, nc.ude.uws@321naiqgnaw). Whole cp genome sequences were generated by using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at the Beijing Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). To obtain the complete cp genome, de novo assembly of the raw data was performed by using SPAdes version 3.5.0 (Bankevich et al. 2012). The cp genome sequence was annotated by using PGA (https://github.com/quxiaojian/PGA) (Qu et al. 2019) with manual adjustments. The sequence cp genome was deposited in GenBank (accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MW149076\",\"term_id\":\"1935004502\"}}MW149076).\n\nThe cp genome of C. longifolia var. floccose formed a typical circular quadripartite structure of 154,285 bp length, containing two inverted repeats (IRs) of 25,700 bp, a large single-copy (LSC) region of 85,008 bp, and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 17,877 bp. The GC content of the whole cp genome is 38.07%. In total, 112 distinct genes were annotated, including 78 protein-coding (PCGs), 30 transfer RNA (tRNA), and 4 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The gene content and organization are similar to other members of Callicarpa (Wang et al. 2019; Du et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021; Xie et al. 2021)."
