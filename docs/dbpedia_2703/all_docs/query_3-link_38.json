Â\n\nAgain, as much as possible, Iâve followed the evolutionary development of angiosperms (and that of Flora of North America).Â Again, as you might guess, with DNA analysis, there has been significant revisions of species, genera and even families since I once practiced botany as a profession.\n\nThis volume ends with the viburnum family of plants and from there, we head to volume 3.Â The layout and format is the same as volume 1.\n\nAlso as before, Iâm sure there are some misidentifications of plants.Â There will also be some errors in the text even though I have proofed the volume very closely.Â It reminds me of how many times I read and re-read my thesis and how many times Dr. Pullen did the same.Â After it was published, I opened it up midway and immediately noticed a spelling error that we had both overlooked. Hopefully, there will not be too many to distract from the volume.Â\n\nChapter 2\n\nFabaceae\n\nThe Encyclopaedia Britiannica states this family is the third largest family of plants in the world, with 700 genera and 20,000 species,Â just behind the orchid family and the aster family. Although Flora of North America has not published their volume on Fabaceae, they list 164 genera within the family.Â There is no count as of yet as to the number of species.\n\nAs for me, in my graduate school days, I collected 22 genera and 46 species in Tishomingo State Park.1Â In recent travels, I found 45 genera and 81 species. Â\n\nYears ago, when I began my graduate studies, this family was also known as the Leguminosae - the legumes.Â Members of this family include some of the most commercially important plants on earth: soybeans, beans, peas, peanuts, alfalfa, clovers, etc. Â\n\nA large number of this family have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria located in nodules on the roots of these plants.Â Plants and animals cannot use atmospheric nitrogen.Â Instead, we are dependent upon bacteria and blue-green algae to convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrites and nitrates - a form which we can utilize.Â Plants also require nitrites and nitrates for growth.\n\nFor this reason, a lot of leguminous crops are planted in rotation with other crops in order to put nitrates and nitrites back into the soil - in other words, to provide fertilizer. Â\n\nIn the Fabaceae, the leaves are often either trifoliate (three leaflets) or pinnately compound.Â The flowers may be irregular and in some cases, highly modified into what we recognize as a âpeaâ flower.Â That flower has bilateral symmetry and is composed of a dorsal âbannerâ petal, two âwingâ petals, and two âkeelâ petals.Â The keel petals may or may not be fused. Â\n\nAbrus precatorius L.\n\nRosary Pea (Abrus precatorius L.)\n\nIf you ever saw the movie Blue Lagoon with Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, you saw the rosary pea when they attempted suicide.Â The seeds (the pea) contain the toxin abrin. A single pea can be fatal if chewed and ingested.Â\n\nThe movie was released in 1980.Â Around 1987, I began taking students to Archbold Biological Station near Venus, Florida and saw it for the first time growing close to the buildings at the station.Â It was one of the first plants I warned students about and used the movie as an example.Â At that time, most had seen the movie, but like most things, over the years fewer and fewer students had seen the movie and I lost that analogy for my lectures.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in their Plants Database show the vine growing in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.Â I assume the common name comes from the ability to make rosaries from the seeds.\n\nAcacia constricta A. Gray\n\nWhitethorn (Acacia constricta A. Gray)\n\nThis is also known as Vachellia constricta by some authorities, but Iâll stick with Acacia until Flora of North America publishes volume 10 on Fabaceae.Â The USDA reports it in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and strangely, Maryland and Virginia where Wikipedia calls it a disjunct population.Â It is really a southwestern species.\n\nIf you notice, it looks a little like mimosa flowers.Â The Fabaceae are broken down into major groups based on floral anatomy and leaf structure and the mimosa group is common.\n\nThe leaves are distinctly evenly pinnate (an even number of leaflets) and, as I remember, rather thick. Â\n\nAlysicarpus vaginalis (L.) DC.\n\nAlyce Clover (Alysicarpus vaginalis (L.) DC.)\n\nThis is one tiny flower.Â I used my macro lens to capture this image.Â It is not native to the U.S. but has been introduced. Â\n\nIf you go visit Shark Valley in Everglades National Park, youâll find that a certain times of the year, the parking lot is insufficient to handle the influx of tourists.Â Probably more people out of the state have heard of Shark Valley than inside the state.Â When the lot fills up, youâll be asked to park along Tamiami Trail (SW 8th Street, or as we know it, Calle Ocho).Â You have a short hike into the park. Â\n\nI was walking back to my truck and stumbled across this growing along the shoulder of the park loop road. Â\n\nIf you go to Shark Valley, I encourage you to take the tram tour (or you can rent a bicycle).Â The tram takes you to the tower which overlooks the valley.Â Itâs called Shark Valley because of the abundance of fossilized sharkâs teeth in the ground. Â\n\nOverlook at Shark Valley\n\nBe careful at the overlook.Â At the base will be a large number of alligators.Â They look fake.Â The ranger tells the story of the couple from Asia that thought they were fake and were about to put their baby on the back of one for a photo op.Â The ranger stopped them just in time.\n\nShark Valley is one of the best areas in the U.S. for bird watching.Â My colleague at the college, Chris, used to volunteer at the park and heâs got some excellent photographs of birds from Shark Valley. Â\n\nA word about the specific epithet.Â Apparently Georgia OâKeeffe wasnât the first person to draw the analogy between flowers and female reproductive structures.\n\nAmorpha canescens Pursh\n\nLeadplant (Amorpha canescens Pursh)\n\nThis plant is the epitome of the color purple to me.Â It is also a very intense purple.\n\nLeadplant (Amorpha canescens Pursh)\n\nWikipedia suggests the name comes from the âleadenâ color of the leaflets.Â This is perhaps shown better in the first photo.Â The leaflets have a dense layer of hairs on the surfaces. Â\n\nIt grows as a small shrub. The USDA shows it mostly in the midwest U.S. and Canada. I found it at Custer State Park in South Dakota but also, although not reported by the USDA, at Blue Spring State Park in Florida.\n\nAstragalus agrestis G. Don\n\nCockâs Head (Astragalus agrestis G. Don)\n\nAlthough this one is commonly called cockâs head, the genus as a whole is commonly called milkvetches.Â According to the Biota North American Programâs North American Plant Atlas (NAPA), there are only five (by my count) species found east of the Mississippi River and thatâs out of 694 species.Â This is a western plant.Â\n\nCockâs Head (Astragalus agrestis G. Don)\n\nCockâs Head (Astragalus agrestis G. Don)\n\nA. agrestis is fairly widespread and even extends into Iowa and Illinois.Â This photo was taken along the Ridgeline Trail of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, south unit.Â\n\nA lot of the members of this genus have very pubescent leaves, particularly on the lower surfaces of the leaflets. Â\n\nThe species are not easy to identify.Â You often need the fruit (legumes) for positive identification.Â Most of my identifications are based upon plant checklists for the area as well as descriptions and photos in field guides to the areas.\n\nAstragalus amphioxys A.Gray\n\nCrescent Milkvetch (Astragalus amphioxys A.Gray)\n\nI thought this a particular attractive milkvetch and one of the first ones I found out west.Â This was photographed near the Windows in Arches National Park.Â Note the curved fruits (legumes) in the right foreground and you can see how it gets the common name âcrescent.â Â\n\nNAPA shows this mostly in the desert southwestern U.S. Â\n\nTauck pulled Nancy, Michel and me out on their âdawn patrolâ at Arches.Â I have to admit, itâs a great time to view the park.Â You beat the heat, see a beautiful sunrise, and are back in time for breakfast.\n\nThis formation at Arches is known as âThe Windowsâ and also as âThe Spectaclesâ.Â I think I prefer spectacles. Â\n\nWe had a pretty nice sunrise that morning.\n\nAstragalus desperatus M.E.Jones\n\nRimrock Vetch (Astragalus desperatus M.E.Jones)\n\nOne of the reasons I like milkvetches is because they often grow sparsely as a tight clump and are easily found.Â (Iâm a lazy botanist.)Â This particular species was very common on the âSpirit of the Desert Southwestâ tour.Â\n\nNAPA shows it restricted to four states in the desert southwest: Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. My photographs are all from Utah.Â\n\nMy first view of this was Grand View Overlook at Canyonlands National Park.Â The second was a little further west along the Capitol Gorge Road at Capitol Reef National Park.Â That purple of the flowers really stands out against the background of bare soil.\n\nRimrock Vetch (Astragalus desperatus M.E.Jones)\n\nThe seed pods are slightly curved and inflated and covered in hairs.\n\nRimrock Vetch (Astragalus desperatus M.E.Jones)\n\nThe drive along Capitol Gorge Road was one of the most spectacular Iâve made in all my trips.Â The milkvetch was growing alongside the road and I pulled over and dodged what little traffic there was to get the photo.Â I wonder why the specific name âdesperatus?â\n\nAstragalus gilviflorus Shelton\n\nPlains Milkvetch (Astragalus gilviflorus Shelton), south unit\n\nI found this in two locations of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and it seemed to have two different growth forms.Â This photo is a looser form than the other and it may have been due to its location.Â This was on the Boicourt Trail, south unit.\n\nPlains Milkvetch (Astragalus gilviflorus Shelton), north unit\n\nThis photo was taken on the Oxbow Overlook of the north unit. This was far more exposed to the elements than the first.Â That could be the difference in the two.Â A close examination of the flowers showed the same features of both.\n\nPlains Milkvetch (Astragalus gilviflorus Shelton), south unit\n\nThese have a purple keel petal and you can see the trifoliate leaves covered in tiny hairs.Plains Milkvetch (Astragalus gilviflorus Shelton), north unit\n\nThis one has the same colored keel petal albeit more reddish purple.Â It also has the same trifoliate leaves with silky hairs although the leaflets are a little broader. Â\n\nI think this is a good example of how environmental conditions can lead to distinct differences.Â\n\nMy first view of this came by jeep when I pulled into the parking lot for the overlook and walked a short distance to the view of the oxbow.Â Later that day, I hiked into the area from Caprock Coulee Trail, a 4.1 mile loop.Â As I hiked the trail, I met several hikers whose one comment seemed to be watch out for ticks.Â Sure enough, I pulled about three of them off me before I finished the loop.\n\nAstragalus miguelensis Greene\n\nSan Miguel Island Locoweed (Astragalus miguelensis Greene)\n\nThis is a very large milkvetch.Â Contrary to its common name, I found it on Santa Cruz Island of the Channel Islands. Â\n\nSan Miguel Island Locoweed (Astragalus miguelensis Greene)\n\nCalflora (a website to report plant observations in California) shows one location for the plant in Santa Barbara County and the other locations are all in the Channel Islands National Park.\n\nSan Miguel Island Locoweed (Astragalus miguelensis Greene)\n\nThe leaves (and leaflets) are densely covered with tiny hairs.Â The legumes are much inflated, very much like a bladder.Â I was hiking back to the harbor from Cavern Point and saw this growing on the hillside. Â\n\nA word about loco weed.Â Wikipedia reports that any plant which produces the phytotoxin (plant toxin) swainsonine is considered a loco weed.Â It is most commonly found in the genus Astragalus and Oxytropis. Not all species of Astragalus contain the compound nor, I assume, Oxytropis.\n\nAstragalus missouriensis Nutt.\n\nMissouri Milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis Nutt.)\n\nThis is not a showy milkvetch.Â I had to look for the flowers.Â From the name, you might deduce, correctly, itâs from the middle of the U.S. and Canada. Â\n\nMissouri Milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis Nutt.)\n\nI found the flowers in clusters of threes.Â Iâm not sure that is a characteristics but, for this plant, it was the norm for this plant. Â\n\nMissouri Milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis Nutt.)\n\nAs you can see, the flowers vary from deep purple to milky white( also note there are four blooms).Â Both plants were growing within sight of each other on the Caprock Coulee Trail of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, north unit. Â\n\nCaprock Coulee Trail, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, north unit.\n\nIt was here I started to meet people warning me of ticks.\n\nAstragalus newberryi A.Gray\n\nNewberryâs Milkvetch (Astragalus newberryi A. Gray)\n\nI was driving to Hidden Canyon Ranch (it really was hidden) for my stay and visit to Great Basin National Park when I saw this growing on the side of a cliff.Â It was low enough on the cliff for me to get a photo and there was no traffic to worry about.Â I stopped the jeep and snapped a few quick pics. Â\n\nNewberryâs Milkvetch (Astragalus newberryi A. Gray)\n\nThis is probably the hairiest milkvetch Iâve come across in my travels.Â You almost canât see the leaflets for the hairs.Â To me, the flowers look more like snapdragon flowers than legumes. Â\n\nNAPA reports it distributed throughout the western U.S.Â\n\nAstragalus praelongus E. Shield\n\nStinking Milkvetch (Astragalus praelongus E. Shield)\n\nIâm not sure it stinks because I didnât stop to smell the flowers.Â Notice the inflated legumes.Â This was growing along the Chimney Rock Trail of Capitol Reef National Park. Â\n\nNAPA reports this from Texas, west to Nevada.Â Southwest Colorado Wildflowers says it picks up selenium from the soil which is described as âfetidâ in aroma.Â Simply touching the plant can release the stink.\n\nChimney Rock Trail is a steep climb at first but once you get to the top of the mesa, itâs a great view of the park.\n\nAstragalus oophorus var. caulescens (M.E.Jones) M.E.Jones\n\nEgg Milkvetch (Astragalus oophorus var. caulescens (M.E.Jones) M.E.Jones)\n\nThis is from Devilâs Overlook of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.Â I assume the common name comes from either the eggy looking flowers or that the fruit may be egg shaped. Images of the fruit Iâve seen looks more oblong than oval.\n\nEgg Milkvetch (Astragalus oophorus var. caulescens (M.E.Jones) M.E.Jones)\n\nThen again, it may be due to the shape of the leaflets of the plant.Â Notice the apical notch in each leaflet. Â\n\nDevilâs Overlook, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\nThe overlook does, indeed, look quite devilish.Â Itâs also a very long way down from the overlook.\n\nAstragalus zionis M.E.Jones\n\nZion Milkvetch (Astragalus zionis M.E. Jones)\n\nIâm still amazed at the number of species indigenous to Zion National Park.Â NAPA does report it in other locations in Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.Â This one was not in flower but the legumes were enough to make the identification - that an its location in Zion National Park.\n\nZion Milkvetch (Astragalus zionis M.E. Jones)\n\nOne of the characteristics is the mottling of the legumes as well as their curved shapes.Â Also not the apex of the leaflets with an acuminate (see glossary) tip. Â\n\nThis was growing along the roadside of the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. Â\n\nBaptisia alba (L.) Vent.\n\nWild Indigo (Baptisia alba (L.) Vent.)\n\nNAPA shows 15 species and 8 hybrids for the genus Baptisia.Â According to Wikipedia, several plants contain a compound related to the dye indigo.Â B. alba contains a dye similar to indigo but this is not the plant from which true indigo is derived although it can be used to dye objects blue.\n\nWild Indigo (Baptisia alba (L.) Vent.)\n\nItâs hard to tell in this photograph because the nodes of the plant are so close together but the leaves are trifoliate (three leaflets per leaf).Â This is a tall plant.Â It was so tall that it fell over and the bloom was at ground level. Â\n\nI was just finishing my hike along the Wolfden Loop Trail at F.D. Roosevelt State Park near Warm Springs when I came across this single plant growing in the woods.Â Normally, where I find this plant is growing in waste places and open areas but this was deep in the woods. Originally, this plant was classified as B. leucantha but it has since been renamed B. alba.\n\nCaesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb.\n\nGray Nicker Bean (Caesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb.)\n\nThis is reported by NAPA to be found in Texas, Louisiana and Florida with 10 species in North America and three restricted to Florida: C. crista, C. major, and C. pauciflora.Â The Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) and their Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants reports five species in Florida but does not list them.Â The Atlas of Florida Plants published by the Institute for Systematic Botany list two species in Florida. Since it is listed with invasive plants by IFAS, I assume it is considered one.\n\nGray Nicker Bean (Caesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb.)\n\nWhat drew me to the plant were the seed pods which are quite large and with hundreds of projections on their surfaces.Â Where it gets the âgrayâ part of the common name, I have no idea.\n\nThe leaves are technically thrice evenly pinnately compound.Â A single leaf may be three feet long.\n\nThis was photographed at Bahia Honda State Park near Big Pine Key, Florida.Â As a Mississippi boy, I had never seen anything like this.\n\nCalliandra eriophylla (Benth.) Shehbaz\n\nFairyduster, Mesquitilla (Calliandra eriophylla (Benth.) Shehbaz)\n\nThere are two things that would make you think this is in the Fabaceae: the leaves look like tiny mimosa leaves and the flowers certainly are mimosa-like.Â This stands out like a sore thumb in dry desert environments like the Sonoran desert where I found this. It was part of the Saguaro National Park, Tucson Mountain District growing along side the road.Â I found a pull over and hiked back to the plant to get the photo.Â It looks a little the worse for wear but who wouldnât in that desert heat?\n\nFairyduster, Mesquitilla (Calliandra eriophylla (Benth.) Shehbaz)\n\nNAPA shows 10 species in North America but only six are indicated on the atlas maps.Â I can only assume the other four are unconfirmed reports. C. eriophylla is the most widespread of the six mapped species.\n\nDoes anyone know why you would need to dust a fairy?\n\nCanavalia rosea (Sw.) DC.\n\nBay Bean (Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC.\n\nAt first, the trifoliate leaves of this plant and the vine growth reminded me of an old favorite kudzu.Â Like kudzu which has a raceme of flowers, the bay bean also produces a raceme but the flowers are so spread apart it appears that are solitary in the axils of leaves. Â\n\nBay Bean (Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC.\n\nThe seed pods are longer than wide and appear inflated (none were found on the plants I photographed) and reports are they can be carried out to sea to further the distribution of the plant. That makes sense since I photographed it beach side of Bahia Honda State Park.\n\nCentrosema virginianum (L.) Bentham\n\nButterfly Pea (Centrosema virginianum (L.) Bentham)\n\nThis is a very large flower.Â I would say itâs larger than a silver dollar.Â Itâs a very attractive vine. I remember the first time I saw it in Mississippi.Â Itâs fairly widespread throughout the southeastern U.S.Â Iâve run into it numerous times over the years and itâs always a treat to find. This particular photo was taken on the Sand Hill Trail at Silver Springs State Park.\n\nButterfly Pea (Centrosema virginianum (L.) Bentham\n\nThe leaves are trifoliate.Â The banner petal, unusually, is found on the bottom of this flower. Â\n\nSilver Springs State Park is divided into two sections. One is like all state parks with visitor center, camping areas, cabins, and hiking trails. The second section is the old tourist trap with the glass bottom boats.Â Itâs considered Floridaâs first tourist attraction.Â These boats have pretty much run continuously since the 1870âs when the attraction first started.Â The tourist attraction finally went out of businessÂ (Disney World competition, I guess) and the state purchased the property in the 1980âs. Â\n\nI stopped back by Silver Springs from one of my trips to Warm Springs, Georgia.Â My Dad was stationed at Camp Blanding before WWII and he apparently made a side trip to Silver Springs when on leave.Â Hereâs the photo of the glass bottom boat at Silver Springs, pre-WWII. Â\n\nÂ\n\nThe boats are still there.\n\nCercidium microphyllum (Torrey) Rose & I.M. Johnston\n\nYellow Paloverde (Cercidium microphyllum (Torrey) Rose & I.M. Johnston)\n\nI had heard of paloverde before but never seen it.Â This was on the Desert Discover Nature Trail at Saguaro National Park, Tucson Mountain District.Â The Plant List has Parkinsonia microphylla as the synonym for this plant whereas Flora of North America in their prepublication list has it as the actual name.Â Iâll wait until the publication of volumes 10 and 11 to make the final determination.\n\nNotice how green the branches are.Â That indicates that photosynthesis takes place in the trunk and branches. Â Wikipedia points out that the pinnate leaves fall off in dry times and that means something has to take up the slack for photosynthesis.Â Thatâs not too terribly unusual in the plant kingdom.Â Another example is Psilotum nudum, or whisk fern.Â There are no true leaves on that plant and it is the stem that is photosynthetic.\n\nCercis canadensis L.\n\nRedbud (Cercis canadensis L.)\n\nThis was one of the first trees I learned to recognize, along with dogwoods.Â In the spring of the year, my grandmother and I would ride out to Roosevelt State Park outside Morton, Mississippi to see the redbuds and dogwoods in bloom.Â This was always around Easter.Â The tree has distinctive leaves and bark and the flowers are prolific on the tree in the spring.\n\nRedbud (Cercis canadensis L.)\n\nThey have the classic banner, wings, keel shape to them with the stigma projecting past the stamens.Â They produce the classic âbeanâ pod as fruit, albeit much flattened.\n\nThis photo was taken in, for me, an unusual place.Â It was growing along the roadside as I made my way to Lassen Volcanic National Park in California. Â\n\nMore unusual was the snow on the ground at Lassen but not on the road to the park.Â Itâs like crossing over from early spring into the dead of winter.\n\nChamaecrista fasciculata (Michx.) Greene\n\nPartridge Pea (Chamaecrista fasiculata (Michx.) Greene)\n\nThe common name partridge pea applies to a lot of species in the Fabaceae but this genus and species is one of the most common in the southeastern U.S.Â NAPA shows 13 species in North America and two more unconfirmed sightings. Â\n\nThis particular one was at Archbold Biological Station near Venus, Florida along their nature trail.Â It was growing in a recently cut over section in boggy conditions. Â\n\nIf you look carefully at the upper right leaf of the previous photo, you should notice two things: persistent stipules at the base of the leaf and a pair of glands on the petiole. Â\n\nPartridge Pea (Chamaecrista fasiculata (Michx.) Greene)\n\nWhen mature, the legume turns brown.Â You can see the individual places to find the seed within the legume.Â Also, note the leaflets are acuminate on their tips.\n\nChapmannia floridana Torr. & A.Gray\n\nChapmanâs Pea, Alicia (Chapmannia floridana Torr. A.Gray)\n\nAccording to NAPA, there is only one species and it is restricted in distribution to Florida, so it comes by the specific epithet honestly. This was abundant in the woods of Silver Springs State Park (not the tourist area).Â I found it growing on both the Sink Hole Trail and the Sand Hill Trail.Â In the previous photo you can see the abundant glands on the stem of the plant.\n\nChapmanâs Pea, Alicia (Chapmannia floridana Torr. A.Gray)\n\nThe leaves are basal and if any are on the stem, they are much reduced.Â Itâs a tall plant - around head high. Â\n\nChapmanâs Pea, Alicia (Chapmannia floridana Torr. A.Gray)\n\nThe wing petals are very large in this flower, more so than usual in the Fabaceae. Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Sinkhole Trail, Silver Springs State Park, Florida\n\nIf you are looking for a nice, level trail to walk, Sinkhole Trail is it.Â The only problem is that at certain times of the year, the Silver Springs River floods the low lying areas of the park and they are off limits.Â Itâs always best to check with the park before hand.\n\nSilver Springs River at Silver Springs State Park\n\nThe water here is crystal clear. To find this spot, hike or bike the River Trail to the place they launch canoes in the park.\n\nClitoria mariana L.\n\nButterfly Pea (Clitoria mariana L.)\n\nWho says botanists donât have a sense of humor?Â Literally, Maryâs clitoris, the plant was named because of the resemblance to the female vulva.Â The common name butterfly pea is the same as Centrosema virginianum. Â\n\nÂ Butterfly Pea (Clitoria mariana L.)\n\nThis, like Centrosema is a very large flower and it readily catches your attention as you walk through the woods. Â\n\nButterfly Pea (Clitoria mariana L.)\n\nThese photos were taken along the Sinkhole Trail and River Trail of Silver Springs State Park.Â However, I have found it pretty much everywhere in the southeastern U.S.\n\nCrotalaria pallida Aiton\n\nSmooth Rattlebox (Crotalaria pallida Aiton)\n\nNow thatâs a banner petal!Â Look at the blood red lines and how they look against that yellow background.Â Rattlebox gets its name from the mature fruit.Â When dry, the seeds ârattleâ around inside the legume.Â The sound is very pronounced and you can hear the rattle from a short distance as the plant blows in the breeze.\n\nSmooth Rattlebox (Crotalaria pallida Aiton)\n\nThe leaves are trifoliate and the plant gets rather tall - around 2-3 feet. Â\n\nSmooth Rattlebox (Crotalaria pallida Aiton)\n\nThe seed pod is hairy at first but it may lose the hairs as it matures.Â The pod is elongated and will eventually turn brown.Â These photos were taken along the nature trail of Archbold Biological Station.\n\nCrotalaria spectabilis Roth\n\nShowy Rattlebox (Crotalaria spectabilis Roth)\n\nThis is indeed a showy plant but I prefer the flowers of smooth rattlebox to this one.Â It can grow head high and the raceme of flowers is like a flower wand sticking up from the plant. Â\n\nI photographed this in the Big Cypress Preserve.Â As you head west on the Tamiami Trail, just past Shark Valley there is a pull off for the Old Tamiami Trail.Â That leads to a loop road through the little community of Pinecrest.Â There are plenty of places to pull off the road and explore and thatâs why my friend Pat and I did in March of 2013.Â Â\n\nWe did have to share the area with this goofy looking guy.Â Iâd say he was about six and one half feet long.\n\nDalbergia ecastaphyllum (L.) Taub.\n\nCoin Vine (Dalbergia ecastaphyllum (L.) Taub.)\n\nI almost missed this - it was growing as a vine on a tree - and then when I saw it, I had no idea as to what family it belonged.Â The flowers are very small and, at first glance, do not look like a member of the Fabaceae.\n\nCoin Vine (Dalbergia ecastaphyllum (L.) Taub.)\n\nThere are four species mapped at NAPA and one is simply a report with no location.Â The otherÂ three species are found in Florida and D. sissoo is also found in Arizona.\n\nThis was photographed along the nature trail at Secret Woods Nature Center.Â There is a nice, long boardwalk along the south fork of the New River.Â I took the photo from the boardwalk.\n\nDalea candida Willd.\n\nWhite Prairie Clover (Dalea candida Willd.)\n\nI am more familiar with the purple species of Dalea, D. purpurea.Â You never know when you run into a plant that the flower color may just be a variant but there are enough botanists that consider this to be a separate species. Â\n\nI photographed this at Devilâs Tower National Monument - of Close Encounters of the Third Kind fame.Â Iâve always thought it interesting that people âdiscoveredâ Devilâs Tower through the movie. Itâs not like it hasnât been sitting there for millions of years.Â I was on a trip with Michel and Nancy in July 2013.Â They decided to play golf near Rapid City, S.D.Â and I decided to drive to Devilâs Tower in Wyoming.Â I hiked around the base - it does take time - and I was surprised how you could climb anywhere you like on the tower without much interference from park personnel. Â\n\nThere were plenty of people rappelling down the side but this blew me away - free climbing the tower.Â He was about three quarters of the way up.Â Itâs amazing we survive childhood, much less youth.\n\nDalea purpurea Vent.\n\nPurple Prairie Flower (Dalea purpurea Vent.)\n\nThis was also along the trail around Devilâs Tower.Â In my thinking, the purple species is more attractive.Â The leaf type is pretty much the same and the only real difference in my mind is the color of the flowers on the head. Â\n\nIt took me a while to wrap my mind around the concept of a head of flowers.Â It is sometimes used rather loosely in botany but there are times that it has a very specific meaning as in the plant and in all members of the aster family.\n\nEysenhartia texana Scheele\n\nTexas Kidneywood (Eysenhartia texana Scheele)\n\nWhat caught my attention with this plant was not the flowers but the leaves.Â They were very stiff and firm and all the leaflets on leaf were fairly small.\n\nI found this at the top of a 490 foot climb to a a ridge at Lost Maples State Natural Area.Â I was tired and had a hard time getting my camera to focus (or my eyes) and it took several shots before I got one that I could use.Â Â\n\nI knew it was in the Fabaceae but that was about it.Â I later was able to identify it in a local field guide.Â NAPA reports this as restricted to the state of Texas, which considering the common name, is apt.Â The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center states the common name comes from the idea that it was used to treat kidney and bladder maladies.\n\nThe waters are not as clear as they once were but you can still see very well.Â Unfortunately, invasive algae are taking over the bottom.\n\nErythrina herbacea L.\n\nCoralbean (Erythrina herbacea L.)\n\nWhat a red flag!Â This will get your attention no matter the background.Â Although Wikipedia describes this as a small shrub or tree Iâve only seen it in a perennial herb form. Â\n\nCoralbean (Erythrina herbacea L.)\n\nThe leaves are trifoliate and the leaflets are triangular or arrow-head shaped.Â If you look carefully at the stem of the flowers, you may be able to see curved spines.\n\nCoralbean (Erythrina herbacea L.)\n\nTo me, the flowers only remotely resemble a leguminous flower.Â The banner petal is the most obvious.Â I donât remember ever seeing it as a graduate student in Mississippi but I have run into it three times in Florida.Â Itâs reported throughout the southeastern U.S. I found this at Archbold Biological Station near Venus, Florida and also at Blue Spring State Park near Orange City, Florida\n\nBlue Spring State Park, Orange City, Florida\n\nThis is one of Floridaâs numerous freshwater springs with exceptionally clear water.Â The temperature stays around 72 F year round and this is a great place to see manatees in the winter months.Â I can attest to the 72 F water.\n\nGalactia elliottii Nutt.\n\nElliottâs Milkpea (Galactia elliottii Nutt.)\n\nGalactia is an old friend.Â I collected two species in Tishomingo State Park during my graduate work: G. mollis and G. volubilis.Â G. elliottii was new to me and for good reason.Â NAPA shows the range only into Georgia and South Carolina in addition to Florida.Â My exposure came at Lake George State Forest near De Leon Springs, Florida. Â\n\nThis is a small climbing vine and if you look carefully at the end of the leaves, youâll find one leaflet is modified into a tendril to attach the plant to anything upright.Â Tendrils may be modified stems, leaves, and even flowers. Â\n\nSt. Johnâs River at Lake George State Forest\n\nI was just getting into camping again after a long hiatus and decided I needed a shake-down trip with my new tent.Â I found you needed no permits or admission fee to camp at the state forests in Florida so off I went.Â The sign in the next photograph was prominently displayed at the campground.Â I was the only person there.\n\nAs you might guess, I forgot to carry my bear spray with me on the hiking trails that day.Â I promised myself never again.\n\nGalactia regularis (L.) Britton & al.\n\nTwining Milkpea (Galactia regularis (L.) Britton & al.)\n\nNAPA has this more widely distributed through the southeastern U.S. I found it in two different locations in Florida: Allen David Broussard Catfish Creek Preserve State Park near Haines City, Florida and Silver Springs State Park.Â\n\nÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Twining Milkpea (Galactia regularis (L.) Britton & al.)\n\nAlthough the leaves are similar in shape, the texture from the different locations is different and the flower color is significantly different.Â Again, itâs probably due to habitat. Â\n\nGalactia striata (Jacq.) Urb.\n\nFlorida Hammock Milkpea (Galactia striata (Jacq.) Urb.)\n\nFrom the common name âFlorida Hammockâ you may well assume itâs restricted to Florida hammocks in the Everglades.Â The term hammock was new to me when I moved to Florida but it simply means a small land mass in the Everglades formed by vegetation over many years.Â Large hammocks were often home to Seminoles back in the day.Â You may find full size trees on well established hammocks. Â\n\nAs far as the milkpea, the green legume looks very much like the traditional butterbean of southern gardens.\n\nFlorida Hammock Milkpea (Galactia striata (Jacq.) Urb.)\n\nIn any case, the Florida hammock milkpea can be found in those counties that border the Everglades plus one or two more scattered counties.Â Note the appressed hairs on the stem and âpea.â\n\nGenista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson\n\nFrench Broom (Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson)\n\nAs I was driving from Lassen Volcanic National Park to Redwoods National Park, I was steered by my hosts at Redding, California to drive north to Oregon and then cut across and down into California and Redwoods.Â Itâs apparently one of those you-canât-get-there-from-here situations.Â As I drove from Oregon to Redwoods, I kept seeing this flash of yellow along the roadside.Â\n\nAfter I got settled in my cabin at Jedediah Smith State Park (associated with Redwoods) I did a short recon of the area.Â I found a river flowing through the park and this same shrub growing along the riverbank.Â I was later able to identify it.\n\nThe leaves are trifoliate and the leaflets are acuminate on their tips.Â If you look carefully in the next photo, youâll be able to see tiny hairs (trichomes) along the margins of the leaflets.\n\nFrench Broom (Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson)\n\nThe flower is definitely pea-like and the flower color is very intense.Â Iâd estimate the size of each flower to be about the size of a nickel.Â Calflora reports it as not native and naturalized in the wild.\n\nGlycyrrhiza lepidota Pursh\n\nWild Licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidota Pursh)\n\nThe North American Plant Atlas (NAPA) only lists two species in North America: G. glabra and G. lepidota with G. lepidota by far the most common.Â G. glabra is considered the âtrueâ licorice and G. lepidota is sometimes referred to as American licorice.Â Wikipedia also states the sweet taste of the plant is due to the compound glycyrrhizin.\n\nI photographed it at Devilâs Tower National Monument.Â Thereâs something about this plant that stands out.Â Why it strikes me as so different from other members of the family I have no idea.Â Life is funny like that.Â Somethings just get your attention in life and others donât.\n\nHedysarum alpinum L.\n\nAlpine Sweetvetch (Hedysarum alpinum L.)\n\nThere are four species of Hedysarum reported on the NAPA website with H. alpinum mostly in Canada but also as far down as Wyoming.Â I photographed this at Lake Moraine in Yoho National Park, Alberta. Â\n\nWikipedia reports it as an important food source (leaves, seeds, roots) for wildlife in the area, including grizzlies!\n\nI admit the specimen looks a little bedraggled.Â It wasnât because of the weather but I think the flowering period had passed.Â If you look at the raceme, youâll see new flowers at the top and at the base youâll see some fruit developing.Â Thatâs typical in a lot of plants with a spike or raceme.\n\nHedysarum boreale Nutt.\n\nNorthern Sweetvetch (Hedysarum boreale Nutt.)\n\nThis is similar in appearance, habitat, and distribution as H. alpinum but is more widely distributed across the western U.S. and down as far as Texas (NAPA).Â\n\nIn the next photo, note how the banner petal, the keel petal and the two wing petals are exactly the same color. Â\n\nYou could also argue (botanically, that is) that this flower structure is a raceme or a spike.Â Technically a spike is where the flowers attach directly to a stalk with no pedicel at the base of the flower.Â The flowers on this plant have an exceptionally tiny pedicel so you might be justified in calling this a raceme of flowers instead of a spike of flowers. Â\n\nIf you want to know what botanists get into heated discussions about, now you know.Â Raceme or spike.\n\nNorthern Sweetvetch (Hedysarum boreale Nutt.)\n\nThe flower color is more intense (to me) than in H. alpinum.Â This was growing along side the Capitol Gorge Road and stood out like a sore thumb.Â I had to stop, pull of the side of the road, and hike back to the plant.Â I was glad I did.\n\nNorthern Sweetvetch (Hedysarum boreale Nutt.)\n\nIndigofera miniata Ortega\n\nScarlet Pea (Indigofera miniata Ortega)\n\nI photographed this near the lake at Lake Livingstone State Park north of Houston, Texas.Â It was to be a short visit to the park.Â The park was packed and the family camping next to me, albeit nice, decided to throw an all night party with crying babies and friends from town. Â\n\nI packed up at 10 pm and found a La Quinta at Livingstone.Â The park ranger caught me exiting the park and apologized.Â I was wondering to myself what he was doing all night instead of patrolling the park like he should have been.Â At least I got a short hike in and found a few interesting plants during my short visit.\n\nIt was probably my own fault - camping at a state park on labor day.\n\nThe flower was a very intense salmon pink with oddly pinnate leaves.Â It isnât really a vine but more low growing and trailing along the ground, almost like a ground cover.\n\nLathyrus brachycalyx Rydb.\n\nZion Sweetpea (Lathyrus brachycalyx Rydb.)\n\nThis was another roadside find at Zion National Park.Â I was a little late for the blooming period but it was good to catch the legume in development.Â The real interesting part to me were the leaves.Â The leaves are quite long and although the leaflets start out as opposite on the rachis, the soon turn to alternate.Â The end of the leaf develops into a tendril.Â I donât believe Iâve ever seen that phenomenon before. Â\n\nThere was nothing for this to climb on along the roadside so it just became a tangled mass of leaves and stems.\n\nÂ Â\n\nLathyrus japonicus Willd.\n\nBeachpea (Lathyrus japonicus Willd.)\n\nThe common name is appropriate since I found this on the beach, such as it was, at Ship Harbor at Acadia National Park.\n\nBeachpea (Lathyrus japonicus Willd.)\n\nLike L. brachycalyx, the end of the leaf ends in a tendril and there is a little tendency for the leaflets to become less opposite in orientation and more alternate toward the apex. Â\n\nBeachpea (Lathyrus japonicus Willd.)\n\nWhile the banner petal is purple, the wing petals tend to be whitish and surround the keel petal.Â NAPA shows this to be a mainly northeastern and western species.\n\nLathyrus latifolius L.\n\nEverlasting Pea (Lathyrus latifolius L.)\n\nOf the four species of Lathyrus I photographed, this was by far the most attractive, and according to NAPA, the most widely distributed.Â Itâs not native to the U.S. but has been introduced and grows quite well in a variety of habitats. Â\n\nEverlasting Pea (Lathyrus latifolius L.)\n\nOther than the large blooms which attracted me right off the bat, the other features of this plant that stood out are the winged stems and the very large and persistent petioles of the plant.Â The term âwingedâ in botany means outgrowths of tissue on the petiole of a leaf, the stem of the plant, or other plant part. Â\n\nThe leaves, like all Lathyrus, end in tendrils.Â This also grew more upright than the other species and the tendrils did attach to other vegetation near by.\n\nI found this along Lands End Coastal Trail.Â It probably one of the more beautiful walks you can take in San Francisco.Â You have a perfect view of the Pacific Ocean and, occasionally, the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLands End Coastal Trail\n\nThe trail can get quite busy.Â I kept meeting people all along the trail and a few were even curious enough to ask me the name of the plant I was photographing at the time. Â\n\nLathyrus vestitus Torr. & A.Gray\n\nWoodland Pea (Lathyrus vestitus Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nAlthough called the woodland pea, I found this on the same trail at Lands End and not in the woods. Â\n\nWoodland Pea (Lathyrus vestitus Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nThe plant was extremely dusty and it was probably because that section of the trail was heavily traveled.Â This was near the end of the trail which ended at Sutro Baths and the Cliff House.\n\nSutro Baths Ruins\n\nThe Sutro Baths were a huge saltwater swimming pool (six saltwater and one freshwater pool) at Lands End.Â It finally went out of business and was destroyed by fire in 1966.\n\nCliff House at Lands End\n\nThe current Cliff House is the fifth of a long line of buildings, starting in 1858,Â atop a cliff at Lands End.Â It is now a famous restaurant and bar.Â People come from all around to sit in front of the magnificent windows and watch for seals on Seal Rocks.Â\n\nSea Rocks at Lands End - Alas, no seals that day\n\nI can attest that the bartender at Cliff House makes an excellent martini.\n\nLotus corniculatus Linnaeus\n\nBirdâs Foot Treefoil (Lotus corniculatus Linnaeus)\n\nThis photo was taken at Mount Rushmore National Monument and it shows the trifoliate leaves on the stem.Â However, my first exposure to this plant was in France.Â I was on a barge tour of the Bourgogne region. As the barge went through one lock (LâÃ©cluse) after another (I think we went through 22 locks all together), we could leave the barge and walk or bike to the next lock. Â\n\nI took advantage of that and began to photograph wildflowers. Â\n\nBirdâs Foot Treefoil (Lotus corniculatus Linnaeus)\n\nTo this day, this is one of my favorite shots.Â Not simply because it turned out well but because of the magnificent colors.\n\nÂ Â\n\nThe Nenuphar passing through lâÃ©luse - Nenuphar translates as waterlily\n\nThe Nenuphar is one of several barges operating by French Country Waterways.Â The barge season is short.Â There are specific times of the year when there is enough water in the canals of France to allow for barge traffic. Â\n\nLupinus albifrons Benth.\n\nSilver Bush Lupine (Lupinus albifrons Benth.)\n\nYou say toe-may-toe and I say toe-mah-toe.Â Lou-peen, lou-pine. Or is that loop-in?Â It was on a field trip with Dr. Pullen back in the 60âs to the Mississippi Gulf Coast that I saw my first lupine and Iâve always enjoyed finding them ever since.Â When I find them, they tend to be in well drained soils, often on hills and roadsides.Â L. albifrons was something of a shock since I had not seen many bush forms of the genus.Â\n\nSilver Bush Lupine (Lupinus albifrons Benth.)\n\nThe common name silver comes from the dense covering of tiny hairs on the palmately compound leaves.\n\nSilver Bush Lupine (Lupinus albifrons Benth.)\n\nFlowers are arranged as a raceme and, in this species, quite large. Iâve photographed it in two locations in California: Lands End and Pinnacles National Park.\n\nLupinus arboreus Sims\n\nTree Lupine, Yellow Bush Lupine (Lupinus arboreus Sims)\n\nTree is stretching it a bit.Â More like a tall shrub.Â Lupines have palmately compound leaves but notice how these seem to be tipped in white. Â\n\nTree Lupine, Yellow Bush Lupine (Lupinus arboreus Sims)\n\nIn the previous photo, the flowers are not quite fully open but you can see the beginning of the expansion of the banner petal in the topmost flower. Â\n\nTree Lupine, Yellow Bush Lupine (Lupinus arboreus Sims)\n\nThe legumes are just as hairy as the leaves.\n\nI photographed this in two different locations: Lands End Coastal Trail in San Francisco and Point Reyes National Seashore.\n\nLupinus argenteus Pursh\n\nSilvery Lupine (Lupinus argenteus Pursh)\n\nIâve probably seen more of this lupine than any other species out west.Â It seems to be abundant in Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Crater Lake.Â It certainly is attractive growing in large clumps. NAPA shows a wide distribution in the west. Silvery Lupine (Lupinus argenteus Pursh)\n\nThe silvery aspect comes from tiny hairs, abundant on the undersurface of the leaves but with some on the upper surface as well.Â At the right center of the photograph you can see the beginnings of the legumes.Â They will also be hairy.\n\nLupinus bicolor Lindl.\n\nBicolor Lupine (Lupinus bicolor Lindl.)\n\nI think you can see white splotches against a purple background on the individual flowers, hence the name bicolor. Â\n\nBicolor Lupine (Lupinus bicolor Lindl.)\n\nI took this alongside the Sacramento River in Redding, California. Â\n\nI was staying at Apples Riverhouse B&B.Â I had just returned from hiking in Lassen Volcanic National Park and had recovered enough I wanted to walk the river trail which started adjoining the B&B.Â The owners recommended I the trail to the famous Sundial bridge, about a mile. Â\n\nOf course, I got turned around and walked the opposite direction and didnât get to see the bridge but I did get to see a meadow with abundant wildflowers along the river. Â\n\nAs I departed the B&B the next day for Redwoods National Park, the owners again recommended I stop for the Sundial bridge on my way out.Â I kept thinking, a bridge is a bridge.Â Reluctantly, I diverted my gps to the bridge.Â Iâm glad they were insistent. Â\n\nSundial Bridge Across the Sacramento River at Redding, California\n\nThe bridge was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it was opened on July 4, 2004.Â Itâs 720 feet long and 23 feet wide and you walk across 2,245 glass panels.Â The bridge is a stunner.\n\nThis was in April of 2018.Â I returned from my cross country trip in June and in August, I began reading about the Carr fire near Redding. The fire boundary was within one block of the B&B.Â I tried to contact the owners of the B&B but Iâm sure they had been evacuated and not sure they were able to respond.Â Certainly, much of the area I walked near the B&B was destroyed by the fire.Â At least, the website for the B&B is still active. Â\n\nThe couple that ran the B&B were the nicest people.Â I needed to wash a load of clothes and they washed and folded my clothes for me.Â When I arrived, neither were there but they provided me access and waiting for me was two bottles of wine.\n\nLupinus bingenensis Suksd.\n\nBingen Lupine (Lupinus bingenensis Suksd.)\n\nThis little lupine was growing along the Lakeshore Trail at Stehekin, Washington near North Cascades National Park.Â The walk along the trail were pretty spectacular and even I couldnât keep my eyes off the beauty of the trail and on the wildflowers.Â The flower is very pastel blue and I almost missed it.\n\nOne of the things that make lupine attractive to me are the palmately compound leaves.Â I think they are true art forms.\n\nBingen Lupine (Lupinus bingenensis Suksd.)\n\nBingen Lupine (Lupinus bingenensis Suksd.)\n\nLupinus chamissonis Eschsch.\n\nDune Lupine (Lupinus chamissonis Eschsch.)\n\nI was hiking the Bear Valley Trail to the Glen Camp at Point Reyes National Seashore when I saw this along the trail.Â It was a spectacular sight.\n\nDune Lupine (Lupinus chamissonis Eschsch.)\n\nThese leaves were more pubescent on the top surface than on the bottom surface.Â I generally find the opposite more common in nature.\n\nDune Lupine (Lupinus chamissonis Eschsch.)\n\nThere were not a lot of flowers on the raceme but their pastel purple was quite an attention getter.\n\nDune Lupine (Lupinus chamissonis Eschsch.)\n\nThe light from the back highlights the pubescence of the legumes and you can see the persistent style of the ovary on the legume.\n\nIt was 4.6 miles into the camp site and, of course, 4.6 miles back out.Â I was scheduled for two nights at Glenn Camp.Â On the first day, however, I pretty much exhausted myself at the Point Reyes Lighthouse and on a hike to Chimney Rock.\n\nThe trail to Chimney Rock starts at the historic lifeboat station.\n\nFrom there, you walk the coastline to Chimney Rock. Â\n\nMost of the area around the cliffs were closed due to recent earthquake activity but I was able to get this photo with my zoom lens.\n\nI returned to the lifeboat station and walked another 0.9 miles to Elephant Seal Cove. I didnât see any elephant seals but I did see some river otters frolicking in the ocean.\n\nTo make a long story longer, after the lighthouse, Chimney Rock, and river otters, I was exhausted and realized I was not going to hike to Glen Camp that day.Â I was later glad that I didnât. Â\n\nInstead, I splurged at a motel on Tomales Bay.Â I had read about the bay before but had never seen it.Â It was a treat.Â The motel wasnât much but the view was spectacular.\n\nThat evening, I found an interesting looking restaurant called saltWATER Oyster Depot at the small town of Inverness (back to my Scottish heritage).Â Later, I found out how famous the place is for San Francisco and environs.Â It was serendipity I found it and had a delicious meal. Â\n\nThe next morning, I got up and hiked to Glen Camp.\n\nLupinus concinnus J. Agardh\n\nBajada Lupine (Lupinus concinnus J. Agardh)\n\nThis is a small but attractive lupine that was near my campsite at Catalina State Park outside of Tucson.Â I was camping for a couple of nights there in order to visit Saguaro National Park.Â I highly recommend the park.\n\nThe term bajada refers to a slope of alluvial material at the foot of a mountain.\n\nBajada Lupine (Lupinus concinnus J. Agardh)\n\nI donât think Iâve seen anything this hairy before.Â The hairs hold onto dew for the plant which then absorbs the water from the hairs.Â The flowers, from a distance, are not showy but up close they are very attractive.\n\nLupinus latifolius J.Agardh\n\nBroadleaf Lupine (Lupinus latifolius J.Agardh)\n\nIâm not sure why this is called broadleaf lupine.Â The leaves donât look any broader to me than any of the other species Iâve come across. Â\n\nBroadleaf Lupine (Lupinus latifolius J.Agardh)\n\nThe one thing that does stick out to me is the lack of pubescence on this plant.Â Look closely at the stems.Â They are distinctly purple and very smooth.\n\nBroadleaf Lupine (Lupinus latifolius J.Agardh)\n\nEven when you look at the inflorescence, there is very little hairiness.Â All the photos I have of this are from Crater Lake. Â\n\nLupinus lepidus Lindl.\n\nDwarf Lupine (Lupinus lepidus Lindl.)\n\nDwarf is a good term.Â This is a very small lupine I found on the Rim Drive of Crater Lake.Â On the rim, plants are exposed to pretty harsh environments and I suspect this has a fight on its hand year round.\n\nThe Rim Drive is not open year round.Â You have to choose your dates carefully if you are headed to Crater Lake but the trip is certainly worth the effort. Â\n\nDwarf Lupine (Lupinus lepidus Lindl.)\n\nThe raceme of flowers is very tight on the stem.Â Weâre also back to the pubescence typical of most lupines.\n\nLupinus polyphyllus Lindl.\n\nBroadleaf Lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.)\n\nAnother commonly called broadleaf, I can at least see why this would merit the name.Â The leaflets on the leaves are very large.\n\nBroadleaf Lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.)\n\nQuite simply, this is a pretty large herbaceous plant, almost reaching the size of most shrubs.Â This was photographed at Sequoia National Park. Â\n\nBroadleaf Lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.)\n\nWhen the seeds are ready to be released, the legume valves twist open freeing the seeds.Â This is also a common phenomenon in lima beans.\n\nSequoia is a two-fer park.Â Right next door to Sequoia is Kings Canyon National Park.Â Thereâs a winding, curvy road that connects the two that can be a little challenging if you get up, like I did, before dawn and start down the road.Â Best keep an eye out for wandering deer.\n\nI stayed in Kings Canyon at Grant Grove Village.Â Most of the campsites were hike-in (often several miles) and I decided to take it easy and rent a cabin.Â The cabin I was in was rustic to say the least.\n\nThe outside looked pretty good but the inside was even more primitive.Â At least I wasnât staying in the tents on the property.\n\nOn second thought, they may have been better than the cabin.\n\nOne of the more interesting stops I made was in Sequoia to Moro Rock.Â You climb quite a few steps to the top for a spectacular vista of the surrounding area.\n\nThey keep warning you about lightning strikes and to stay off the rock if any bad weather occurs.Â Fortunately for me the sky was cloudless.Â There are 400 steps to the top.\n\nVista from Moro Rock\n\nAtop Moro Rock\n\nLupinus pusillus Pursh\n\nDwarf Lupine (Lupinus pusillus Pursh)\n\nAnother dwarf lupine, different genus, different location.Â Again, this points out the difficulties of common names and the need for use of scientific names.Â This was at the Windows at Arches National park.Â The colors really pop against the reddish sandstone soil of Arches.Â\n\nLupinus sparsiflorus Benth.\n\nCoulterâs Lupine (Lupinus sparsiflorus Benth.)\n\nI suppose the flowers are a little sparse but Iâve seen a few with a large number of flowers.Â I photographed this at two locations in the west: Canyonlands National Park in Utah and Catalina State Park near Tucson. The first photo is at Catalina State Park and the second photo is from Canyonlands.\n\nCoulterâs Lupine (Lupinus sparsiflorus Benth.)\n\nMacroptillium lathyroides (L.) Urb.\n\nPhasey Bean (Macroptillium lathyroides (L.) Urb.)\n\nThe best description I can give you of this plant is a legume that experimented with LSD when it was in college.Â Thereâs nothing that makes sense of the petals of this flower.Â IFAS reports it native to tropical America but has become established in Florida.Â NAPA reports it in Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, sometimes in single counties. Â\n\nPhasey Bean (Macroptillium lathyroides (L.) Urb.)\n\nI find the leaves attractive. They are acuminate at the end of each leaflet (three leaflets per leaf) and the edges of the leaflet are colored reddish black - like an outline. Â\n\nI ran across this for the first time at Archbold Biological Station near Venus, Florida in April 2016.Â Iâve been going to Archbold since the late 1980âs and never saw it.Â I suspect some bird deposited the seed. Â\n\nMedicago lupulina L.\n\nBlack Medic (Medicago lupulina L.)\n\nMost people mistake this genus for clover (Trifolium) and the three leaflets per leaf does remind one of clover.Â However, there are some differences between the species.Â I assume itâs called black medic because the legumes turn black when mature.Â Â\n\nNAPA reports 15 species of Medicago in North America and M. lupulina and M. sativa are the most common.Â This photo was taken at Devilâs Tower National Monument.\n\nMedicago polymorpha L.\n\nBurr Clover (Medicago polymorpha L.)\n\nThe first thing that got my attention on this was the pubescence on the leaves.Â I knew it was Medicago but had not seen such hairiness on the genus before.Â I found this at Fanning Springs, along the Nature Coast State Trail (bikes). Â\n\nNAPA has it fairly widely distributed throughout the southeastern U.S., the northeastern U.S. and the western U.S.Â For some reason, it misses the midsection.\n\nThe common name refers to the enations of spikes on the fruits to make it look like burrs.\n\nMedicago sativa L.\n\nAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)\n\nThis is probably the most valuable forage crop in the world.Â It is nutritious for animals and the roots of the plant contain nodules with nitrogen fixing bacteria, so the plant provides nutrients for the soil.Â Hay from alfalfa often brings premium prices on the market.\n\nWikipedia states that California, Idaho and Montana are major areas for alfalfa but it is grown throughout the United States.Â I photographed this in Badlands National Park in South Dakota.\n\nMy first experience with Badlands was when I hired on as a Botanist/Plant Ecologist with the Bureau of Land Management in Miles City, Montana.Â I was to do a plant survey of the Wibaux-Beach area of eastern Montana, some 358 square miles of rolling hills prairie. Â\n\nWhen I hired on in Miles City, the Bureau had all kinds of instructions I had to go through: how to drive a four-wheel drive vehicle, how to survive in a ground blizzard, first aid, etc.Â One thing they did was hire a private plane and fly me over Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming to get a feel for the terrain (your tax dollars at work).Â One region we flew over was the Badlands.Â\n\nLater, I was driven through the Badlands by my supervisor for some reason - perhaps to test out my 4-wheeler skills. Â\n\nThe Badlands have such a wonderful history - with outlaws holing up in the area, Theodore Roosevelt ranching in the area, the richness of the region for coal deposits, and most interestingly, the area is rich in fossils, especially T. rex. Â\n\nIn July of 2013, Nancy, Michel and I paid a visit. Â\n\nPanorama Overlook, Badlands National Park\n\nItâs a vast area with some really interesting views. Iâm not too sure I would like to hike the area.\n\nYellow Mounds Overlook, Badlands National Park\n\nFor several reasons.\n\nMelilotus officinalis (L.) Pall.\n\nYellow Sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis (L.) Pall.)\n\nIâve collected the white flowered version of this (M. officinalisÂ var. alba) during my graduate student days and Iâve seen M. officinalis many times during my travels.Â Wikipedia states it is introduced from Europe and NAPA has it as the most widely distributed of seven species.Â\n\nIt can be used as forage but if improperly dried as hay, it produces an anticoagulant toxin that can cause bleeding deaths in cattle (Wikipedia). Â\n\nMimosa quadrivalvis L.\n\nSensitive Briar (Mimosa quadrivalvis L.)\n\nThis is such a neat plant.Â Itâs like a tiny mimosa tree that spreads along the ground.Â If you look at the lower left, youâll see some of the leaves beginning to close up.Â The leaflets are folding inward.Â They do that in response to touch or shaking. Â\n\nI was sitting in botany lecture with Dr. Pullen as an undergraduate when he began lecturing on this phenomenon.Â He had earlier brought in a potted specimen of M. pudica and placed it on the coat rack at the front of the room to allow it to open its leaves. Â\n\nHe then explained how the plant responded to touch and went over to demonstrate.Â He lightly touched a leaf with his pencil.Â Absolutely nothing happened.Â He then tapped a little harder and nothing again. Â\n\nIt got to the point he was practically beating the poor plant with the pencil and it still refused to cooperate.Â In frustration, he said âI guess itâs not going to do it.âÂ He turned and started walking back to the lectern when the entire plant collapsed in the pot. Â\n\nIt was always a challenge to get students involved in botany for me.Â However, I could always get some interest when I showed them the plant and how it closed up its leaves.Â\n\nTo see the mechanism of how it closes, click here.\n\nAt the base of each leaflet is a tiny structure called a pulvinus.Â That structure is extremely sensitive to changes in turgor pressure.Â Any touch or movement will cause water in the pulvinus to rapidly leave and cause the leaf to fold.Â It comes by the name briar honestly.Â It has prickles all along the stem.\n\nOlneya tesota A.Gray\n\nDesert Ironwood (Olneya tesota A.Gray)\n\nThis is one of those âthank goodness the nature trail has labelsâ plants.Â I would have had no idea at all about this, much less that it was a member of the bean family.\n\nThis was on the Desert Discovery Nature Trail of Saguaro National Park, Tucson Mountain District. Â\n\nDesert Ironwood (Olneya tesota A.Gray)\n\nSince the plant was not in bloom or seed, the only hint to indicate to me it was a member of the bean family was the pinnately compound leaves. Â\n\nWikipedia reports that it is an indicator species of the Sonoran Desert and that the wood is so dense, it does not float.Â That is similar to Floridaâs lignum vitae tree Guaiacum officinale or G. sanctum.Â Donât go making any life rafts with the wood.\n\nOxytropis campestris (L.) DC.\n\nField Locoweed (Oxytropis campestrisÂ (L.) DC.)\n\nThis is another of those genera that often absorb toxins from the soils and concentrate them in the plant tissues, hence the name locoweed.\n\nField Locoweed (Oxytropis campestrisÂ (L.) DC.)\n\nNAPA places it mostly in the northwestern U.S. and Canada.Â I photographed it along the shore of Lake Louise, Yoho National Park, Alberta.\n\nOxytropis lambertii Pursh\n\nLambert Crazyweed (Oxytropis lambertii Pursh)\n\nNAPA has O. lambertii as the most widely distributed of the genus with most of the midwest and west included. Like most locoweeds or crazyweeds, it contains the compound swainsonine. Â\n\nLambert Crazyweed (Oxytropis lambertii Pursh)\n\nThe raceme of purple flowers is very noticeable against the rather dusty background in which it is often found. Â\n\nLambert Crazyweed (Oxytropis lambertii Pursh)\n\nThe Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Centerâs Plant Database says the hairs on the leaves are unusual in that they are attached perpendicularly to the leaf much like a see-saw or a lever and fulcrum mechanism.Â They say you need a hand lens in order to see this.Â I had one but was too tired to pull it out after hiking all morning.Â I found this along the Coal Vein Nature Trail at the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, south unit.\n\nPithecellobium keyense Coker\n\nBlackbead (Pithecellobium keyense Coker)\n\nFortunately, Bahia Honda State Park had a labeled nature trail or I would have not any idea as to this plant.Â Trees and shrubs give me fits, particularly if they are not in flower or fruit and particularly if they are out of the range of my expertise.Â Most of south Florida is out of my area of expertise. Â\n\nAccording to signage, it has flowers much like a mimosa and is the larval host for several butterfly species.Â NAPA shows it restricted to Floridaâs southernmost counties.\n\nProsopis velutina Wooten\n\nVelvet Mesquite (Prosopis velutina Wooten)\n\nNAPA maps eight species of mesquite in North America (all of the genus Prosopis).Â Only six of those are verified.Â Again, I thank whoever labeled the plants along the Desert Discovery Nature Trail at Saguaro National Park.\n\nVelvet Mesquite (Prosopis velutina Wooten)\n\nIn order to save water, the plant closes its leaves at night.Â As you know, the wood is prized for grilling.\n\nRhynchosia cinerea Nash\n\nSandhill Snoutbean (Rhynchosia cinerea Nash)\n\nNAPA maps this as a Florida species with 17 species in North America and 14 confirmed.Â I photographed this at Myakka River State Park just outside of Sarasota, Florida.Â Interestingly, NatureServe Explorer refers to this as a ânon-climbing herbaceous vineâ and yet the photo shows it climbing. Â\n\nSandhill Snoutbean (Rhynchosia cinerea Nash)\n\nIn the past, Iâve collected R. tomentosa at Tishomingo State Park and the leaves of the two are very similar - trifoliate and spear-like.Â I assume the common name snoutbean refers to the fruit which must have a projection. Â\n\nRobinia hispida L.\n\nBristly Locust (Robinia hispida L.)\n\nSince I was a kid, I knew black locust (R. pseudoacacia) and according to NAPA, that species is the most common in North America.Â However, R. hispida is the second most common species. Iâve photographed this in two locations: Curtis Valley Overlook on the Blue Ridge and Mount Mitchell State Park, North Carolina.\n\nThe term hispid means very coarsely hairy.Â The hairy part comes from trichomes.Â In this case, itâs the young stems. Â\n\nBristly Locust (Robinia hispida L.)\n\nIf you look carefully at the stem at the top of the photo, youâll see hundreds of tiny projections on the stem which gives it a rough appearance.\n\nBristly Locust (Robinia hispida L.)\n\nAlso, if you look carefully at the leaf bases, youâll se a short spur sticking out.Â These are spines which are modified leaves (in this case, the stipules of the leaf).Â\n\nCurtis Valley Overlook at 4,460 Feet\n\nAs you can see, the overlook was a little cloudy.Â Thatâs good for plant photography!\n\nRobinia neomexicana A.Gray\n\nNew Mexico Locust (Robinia neomexicana A.Gray)\n\nThis was taken on our Zion trip.Â I saw it from the tour bus growing along side the road.Â It was this plant that decided me to not do the next Zion tour with the group and instead walk the roadside to get plant photos. Â\n\nThis is very much a southwestern U.S. plant.\n\nNew Mexico Locust (Robinia neomexicana A.Gray)\n\nLater, after I had looked it up in a local guide, the tour guide asked me if I knew the plant.Â I was pleased to be able to show him a photo from a website to confirm it for him. Â\n\nRobinia pseudoacacia L.\n\nBlack Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.)\n\nAh, the locust of my childhood.Â You learned very early in life not to grab the plant with the spines at the bases of the leaves.Â The plant was popular in my region of Mississippi because the wood from the tree made excellent, long lasting fence posts. Â\n\nBlack Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.)\n\nThe flowers have a wonderful aroma to them.Â These photos were taken at Brandywine Falls at Cuyahoga Valley National Park.\n\nSecurigera varia (Linnaeus) Lassen\n\nCrown Vetch (Securigera varia (Linnaeus) Lassen)\n\nI stumbled across this in the parking lot for Upper Linville Falls in the Pisgah National Forest.Â I was with my cousin Jimmie and her husband Stephen and Jimmie and I had just returned from the upper falls. Â\n\nNAPA reports this as widely distributed across the entire U.S. and Canada.Â Most species of vetch are in the genus Vicia and this was a new genus for me.\n\nSenna lindheimeriana (Scheele) H.S.Irwin & Barneby\n\nLindheimerâs Senna (Senna lindheimeriana (Scheele) H.S.Irwin & Barneby)\n\nThere are two genera that absolutely stump me: Senna and Cassia.Â I look forward to the publication of volume 10 of Flora of North America so I can closely compare the descriptions and distinctions.Â Most local floras and most guide books make no real distinction between the two species.Â Iâm used to detailed descriptions in taxonomic references and I have yet to find anything that works well to tell the two genera apart.Â As an additional problem, some Cassia and Senna have been reclassified as Chamaecrista.Â Even S. lindheimerianaÂ was once classified as Cassia.\n\nRegardless, there are a couple sources that agree on Senna lindheimeriana.Â One is Wildflowers of Texas.2Â Another is SEINet.\n\nLindheimerâs Senna (Senna lindheimeriana (Scheele) H.S.Irwin & Barneby)\n\nItâs a very attractive (and large) flower found in dryer areas of foothills and mesas (SEINet).Â\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as velvet leaf senna because of the texture of the leaves caused by the hairs on each surface.\n\nLindheimerâs Senna (Senna lindheimeriana (Scheele) H.S.Irwin & Barneby)\n\nI found it in two locations in Texas: Big Bend National Park and Lost Maples State Natural Area.\n\nMy cousin Jo introduced me to Lost Maples many years ago and itâs always stuck with me as a beautiful place in the Texas hill country.Â If you get a chance, hike to the top of the ridge.Â Once there you get a wonderful view of the canyon.\n\nSophora secundiflora (Ortega) DC.\n\nTexas Mountain Laurel (Sophora secundiflora (Ortega) DC.)\n\nI was first introduced to this plant at Lost Maples and then later at Carlsbad Caverns.Â It is very popular as an ornamental in Texas and I can see why. Â\n\nÂ Â Â Texas Mountain Laurel (Sophora secundiflora (Ortega) DC.)\n\nThe leaves are oddly pinnate and evergreen. Â\n\nTexas Mountain Laurel (Sophora secundiflora (Ortega) DC.)\n\nThe seed pods are very distinctive when present.Â The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center reports the seeds as poisonous.\n\nI found several trees growing at the main entrance to Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Main Entrance to Carlsbad Caverns National Park and Amphitheater\n\nI had visited Carlsbad many, many years ago to see the night bat flight.Â They have upgraded the facility significantly since my first visit.Â I think I remember wooden benches in the amphitheater. Â\n\nMain Entrance to Carlsbad Caverns National Park and Amphitheater with Texas Mountain Laurel on the left\n\nAs luck would have it, the elevator to the cavern was out of order.Â I had just finished a grueling hike to the top of Guadalupe Peak the day before and was looking for something easy to do.Â Walking to the bottom of the cavern and then back up was not my choice of easy, but at least I made it. Â\n\nHiking back out of the cavern\n\nAbout this time my calves were screaming at me.\n\nStrophostyles leiosperma (Torr. & A.Gray) Piper\n\nWild Bean (Strophostyles leiosperma (Torr. & A.Gray) Piper)\n\nI found this growing along the shore at Lake Livingstone State Park in Texas.Â The two things projecting out from the flower are seed pods.\n\nWild Bean (Strophostyles leiosperma (Torr. & A.Gray) Piper)\n\nThe keel petal is unusual in that it has a curve to it and gives the flower a quixotic look.Â Wikipedia reports that Choctaws used to eat the roots and probably the peas in the pods.\n\nStylosanthes hamata (L.) Taub.\n\nCheesytoes (Stylosanthes hamata (L.) Taub.\n\nI first encountered this on my walks with my dog Rocky near the Boys and Girls Club in our neighborhood.Â It was growing in the swale of the street and I could see these tiny little yellow blooms.Â I later determined it to be Stylosanthes.Â I had collected the genus before at Tishomingo (S. biflora) and recognized the flower. Â\n\nCheesytoes (Stylosanthes hamata (L.) Taub.\n\nI have no idea as to how it got the common name cheesytoes but that has stuck with me.Â I have seen it growing at three locations in Florida: Torreya State Park, Bahia Honda State Park and my neighborhood.\n\nÂ Tephrosia chrysophylla Pursh\n\nScurf Hoarypea (Tephrosia chrysophylla Pursh)\n\nIâve seen three species of Tephrosia in my lifetime.Â According to NAPA, only 18 more to go.Â During my Tishomingo days, I collected T. spicata and T. virginiana.Â These are upright species whereas T. chrysophylla grows close to the ground and spreading. Â\n\nScurf Hoarypea (Tephrosia chrysophylla Pursh)\n\nWikipedia states that the genus comes from the Greek tephros or ash-colored from the pubescence of the leaf.Â They also say most species of Tephrosia contain rotenone, a fish toxin. Â\n\nStrangely, the husks of walnuts contain a similar compound and is also a fish toxin.\n\nLike most members of the family Fabaceae, the roots contain nitrogen fixing bacteria in root nodules.\n\nScurf Hoarypea (Tephrosia chrysophylla Pursh)\n\nThe pubescence is most obvious on the upper left leaves of this photo.Â I took the photo along side the trail to my campsite at Allen David Broussard Catfish Creek Preserve State Park near Haines City, Florida.Â It was growing in pure sand of the Lake Wales Ridge.\n\nThermopsis rhombifolia (Nutt. ex Pursh) Nutt. ex Richardson\n\nPrairie Goldenpea (Thermopsis rhombifolia (Nutt. ex Pursh) Nutt. ex Richardson)\n\nWhile on my way to Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota, I made a single night stop at Rapid City, South Dakota, primarily because the distance from Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado and secondarily, to re-live a trip I made with Michel and Nancy in 2013 where we stayed at the Hotel Alex Johnson, an historic hotel in downtown Rapid City.\n\nMichel put together a wonderful trip of Yellowstone, Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse Monument, the Badlands and Wind Cave that year.Â Our base of operations for everything but the Yellowstone trip was Rapid City and we all fell in love with the place. Â Â\n\nHotel Alex Johnson, Rapid City, South Dakota\n\nOur favorite place in the hotel was the rooftop bar called the Vertex.Â We would meet for happy hour and more often than not eat dinner up there. Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Michel and Me at TheVertex at the Hotel Alex Johnson, Rapid City, South Dakota\n\nInside the Vertex Bar, Hotel Alex Johnson, Rapid City, South Dakota\n\nThey had updated the rooms on my second stay and I have to admit the place had become luxurious compared to our first stay.Â Itâs well worth the visit if you are in the area.\n\nAnyway, I was driving along highway 12 West (north) and kept seeing these bright yellow blooms along the highway.Â Finally, I couldnât help myself.Â I pulled over and snapped a few quick shots. Prairie Goldenpea (Thermopsis rhombifolia (Nutt. ex Pursh) Nutt. ex Richardson)\n\nThis is about as showy of a legume as you would wish to see.Â It was early spring (May) for North and South Dakota and there wasnât much else in bloom. Â\n\nLater, I found it in Theodore Roosevelt National Park.Â\n\nTrifolium hybridum L.\n\nAlsike Clover (Trifolium hybridum L.)\n\nI think everyone is familiar with clovers and who hasnât looked for a four-leaf one?\n\nIn the south, I grew up with red clover (T. pratense) crimson clover (T. incarnatum) and white clover (T. repens). In my travels, Iâve added three more.Â According to NAPA, that only leaves me 26 more to photograph!Â The devil, of course, is in the details and those must be examined with the use of a dissection scope. Â\n\nAlsike Clover (Trifolium hybridum L.)\n\nThis particular clover makes me think of a cross between red clover and white clover to get a pinkish tinge to the flowers.Â Both these photos were taken at the Upper Falls of the Yellowstone viewpoint.Â Later, I found it at Mount Rushmore.\n\nThe Upper Falls are magnificent and Iâve been fortunate to see them in summer and winter.Â In the winter, part of the falls ice over and there is hoar all around the sides from the mist.Â\n\nTrifolium gymnocarpon Torr. & A.Gray\n\nDwarf Clover (Trifolium gymnocarpon Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nI figured this one would be fairly easy to identify based on its location and the distinctive markings on the trifoliate leaves.Â I was right.Â This was at the Painted Wall Overlook at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Â\n\nDwarf Clover (Trifolium gymnocarpon Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nNotice how the edges of the leaves look serrate, like the blade of a knife. Â\n\nTrifolium pratense L.\n\nRed Clover (Trifolium pratense L.)\n\nIâve always wondered why red clover isnât really red.Â Now crimson clover is really red. Regardless, close up photos of this is really beautiful. Â\n\nÂ\n\nRed Clover (Trifolium pratense L.)\n\nAs you can see, there is some variation of color within the species. Also note the markings on the leaflets.Â Iâve probably photographed this species in more places than any other plant. Â\n\nPlaces Iâve photographed red clover include: Chagny, Bourgogne, France; Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone; Lake Louise, Yoho National Park, Alberta; Takakkaw Falls, Yoho National Park, British Columbia; Deep Creek Trail, Great Smoky Mountains; and Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse, Acadia.Â Â\n\nTakakkaw Falls, Yoho National Park, British Columbia\n\nA word about Takakkaw Falls.Â John and I were on the Heli-hiking tour with Tauck and we had a free day.Â We took a side trip to Lake Moraine and Takakkaw Falls.Â The falls are amazing.Â The water comes over the falls with such force that when it hits the first level, it drives the water out vertically over the falls.\n\nTrifolium repens L.\n\nWhite Clover (Trifolium repens L.)\n\nThis is probably the most common species in the United States and it still beckons me to take its photograph every time.Â Something about childhood, four-leafs, and always being able to find it on any trip!\n\nIt was my cousin Jimmie who introduced me to the concept of finding four-leaf clovers for good luck.Â We spent inordinate amount of time in her yard looking for them.Â She was pretty good at finding them - me, not so much.\n\nTrifolium willdenovii Spreng.\n\nSand Clover (Trifolium willdenvoii Spreng.)\n\nThis is a western species according to NAPA, found in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho.Â I found it at Crater Lake.\n\nSand Clover (Trifolium willdenvoii Spreng.)\n\nItâs a sparse flowerer for a clover and not particularly attractive.\n\nVicia americana Willd.\n\nAmerican Vetch (Vicia americana Willd.)\n\nVetches are fairly easy to recognize in the field as far as the genus goes.Â Getting to species is a little more difficult.\n\nThe leaflets can be hairy or not, the stems hairy of not and you have to pay attention to the size of the flower, the tendrils, and many other factors.Â I found this particular one at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, both north and south units.\n\nAccording to NAPA, itâs the most widespread of all vetches.\n\nAmerican Vetch (Vicia americana Willd.)\n\nVicia nigricans subsp. gigantea (Hook.) Lassetter & C.R.Gunn\n\nÂ Â Â Â Giant Vetch (Vicia nigricans subsp. gigantea (Hook.) Lassetter & C.R.Gunn)\n\nItâs a very large, very tall, very clingy vetch.Â The flowers are not large but the plant is.Â This was photographed at Lake Louise in Alberta.\n\nNAPA reports it along the coastal counties of California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, I general donât place plants down to the subspecies or varietal level but due to location, there was no doubt on this one.\n\nVicia villosa subsp. varia (Host) Corb.\n\nSmooth Vetch (Vicia villosa subsp. varia (Host) Corb.)\n\nVetches can quickly get out of control in areas they grow.Â This species is almost as tall as giant vetch but this one may be more aggressive.Â Itâs a good thing the flowers are attractive.\n\nSmooth Vetch (Vicia villosa subsp. varia (Host) Corb.)\n\nThere is very little pubescence on the stems and leaves, hence the name smooth vetch.Â This field was most likely burned over during the Carr Fire near Redding, California.\n\nVicia villosa Roth\n\nWooly Vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)\n\nI included this, not because of the common name but because of the lack of varietal name.Â This species was photographed at Takakkaw Falls, Yoho National Park in British Columbia. Â\n\nVigna luteola (Jacq.) Benth.\n\nCowpea (Vigna luteola (Jacq.) Benth.)\n\nThere were no cows around but this was climbing all over the place at Shark Valley in Big Cypress Preserve.Â This species is pretty widespread throughout the southeastern U.S. according to NAPA. It really liked the canals of Shark Valley and I had a difficult time getting a photograph because for some reason, the plant liked the opposite side of the canal I was on.\n\nCowpea (Vigna luteola (Jacq.) Benth.)\n\nNotice how the vines are almost maroon.Â There are the typical trifoliate leaves.\n\nCowpea (Vigna luteola (Jacq.) Benth.)\n\nThe seed pods turn brown upon maturity and twist open to disperse the seeds.\n\nSpecies/Location\n\nAbrus precatorius\n\nArchbold Biological Station, Venus, Florida\n\nAcacia constricta\n\nThe Windows Trail, Big Bend National Park\n\nAlysicarpus vaginalis\n\nShark Valley, Everglades National Park\n\nAmorpha canescens\n\nCuster State Park, Custer, South Dakota\n\nBlue Spring State Park, Orange City, Florida\n\nAstragalus agrestis\n\nRidgeline Trail, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, South Unit\n\nSkyline Vista, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, South Unit\n\nAstragalus amphioxys\n\nThe Windows, Arches National Park\n\nAstragalus desperatus\n\nGrand View Overlook, Canyonlands National Park\n\nCapitol Gorge Road, Capitol Reef National Park\n\nAstragalus gilviflorus\n\nBoicourt Trail, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, South Unit\n\nOxbow Overlook, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Unit\n\nAstragalus miguelensis\n\nCavern Point Trail, Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park\n\nAstragalus missouriensis\n\nCaprock Coulee Trail, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Unit\n\nAstragalus newberryi\n\nHidden Canyon Retreat, Great Basin National Park\n\nAstragalus praelongus\n\nChimney Rock Trail, Capitol Reef National Park\n\nAstragalus oophorusÂ var. caulescens\n\nDevilâs Overlook, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\nAstragalus zionis\n\nRoadside, Scenic Drive, Zion National Park\n\nBaptisia alba\n\nWolfden Loop Trail, F.D.

and Takakkaw Falls.Â The falls are amazing.Â The water comes over the falls with such force that when it hits the first level, it drives the water out vertically over the falls.\n\nChapter 3\n\nMelastomataceae\n\nI generally refer to this family of plants as the meadow beauty family.Â The prepublication of volume 10 of Flora of North America list only three genera within the family: Melastoma, from which the family derives its name, Rhexia, and Tetrazygia. Â\n\nIâve only photographed one species, Rhexia virginica.\n\nRhexia virginica Linnaeus\n\nMeadow Beauty (Rhexia virginica Linnaeus)\n\nI think you can see why it is called a meadow beauty.Â I photographed this alongside the lake at Myakka River State Park in wet soils.Â These plants like the dampness.\n\nNAPA lists this as an eastern species in North America with one outlier in British Columbia.Â\n\nMeadow Beauty (Rhexia virginica Linnaeus)\n\nNote the leaves are opposite each other on the stem and are said to be decussate (cross shaped on the stem).Â Both the stem and the edges of the leaves are hairy.\n\nSpecies/Location\n\nRhexia virginica\n\nLakeside, Myakka River State Park, Sarasote, Florida\n\nChapter 4\n\nMyrtaceae\n\nThe myrtle family is well represented in Florida with Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Callistemon, and Eugenia.Â Of the genera only Eugenia has native species to Florida.Â The other three are primarily Australian in origin. Â\n\nMelaleuca (for some reason pronounced MAL ah loo kah in Florida - but then, natives pronounce Miami as my AM ah) was brought in to help drain the Everglades.Â It is a water hog.Â Unfortunately, it does the job only too well and has become a serious pest species in Florida, to the point the state imported a melaleuca weevil to help control it. (IFAS)\n\nEucalyptus and Callistemon were brought in as ornamentals.\n\nEugenia foetida Persoon\n\nSpanish Stopper (Eugenia foetida Persoon)\n\nYou may wonder about the specific name.Â The flowers tend to have a foul odor, though not nearly as bad as the white stopper.Â The white stopper is often detected by its smell - very skunk-like. Â\n\nSpanish stopper is found mostly in south Florida (NAPA) and particularly the Florida Keys.Â Fortunately, Bahia Honda State Park had this identified for me. Iâve never really had much exposure to any of the species found naturally in Florida.\n\nSpecies/Location\n\nEugenia foetida\n\nBahia Honda State Park, Big Pine Key, Florida\n\nChapter 5\n\nOnagraceae\n\nI learned this as the evening primrose family although it includes more than just the genus Oenothera (primroses). Â\n\nAs I write these volumes, Iâm constantly amazed at how many plants I knew as a kid growing up, even without the benefit of Boy Scouts.Â I wonder if kids today have anywhere near the knowledge of common names kids in my day knew? Â\n\nI remember evening primroses (and to me, it will always be Oenothera biennis) growing along the roadsides of my home town, Morton, Mississippi.Â They would bloom in the afternoon close up at night and stay closed until the next afternoon.\n\nEvening Primrose (Oenothera biennis Linnaeus)\n\nDuring my cross country travels, Iâve been introduced to more genera and species I didnât know even during my graduate school days. Â\n\nTypically, members of this family have four sepals and four petals and four or more stamens. Â\n\nOenothera biennis Linnaeus\n\nEvening Primrose (Oenothera biennis Linnaeus)\n\nI found this growing near the cabin I was staying at F.D. Roosevelt State Park near Warm Springs, Georgia. Â\n\nThe growth form here is a little atypical but that is because the area I found it was often mowed by the park service.Â That stunts the growth of the plant and also causes it to branch out more than would be typical.\n\nOenothera caespitosa Gilles ex Hooker & Arn.\n\nDwarf Evening Primrose (Oenothera caespitosa Gilles ex Hooker & Arn.)\n\nThis is a particularly attractive primrose growing under pretty intolerable conditions.Â Iâve photographed this at Arches National Park and Zion National Park.\n\nThis is pretty much a western species (NAPA).\n\nOenothera elata Kunth\n\nEvening Primrose (Oenothera elata Kunth)\n\nTalk about a hard life!Â This was growing in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone amid the hot springs.Â I think we can say it is heat tolerant!Â Also, note how many of these are referred to as âeveningâ primrose.\n\nOenothera fruticosa Linnaeus\n\nSundrops (Oenothera fruticosa Linnaeus)\n\nThis is an eastern species (NAPA) and I photographed it in two separate locations of North Carolina along the Blue Ridge Parkway.Â My first encounter was at Deerlick Gap Overlook along the Blue Ridge and the next time was at Mount Mitchell State Park just off the Blue Ridge.Â Both were photographed in June of 2017.\n\nSundrops seems to be a very appropriate name. Â\n\nOenothera laciniata Hill\n\nCutleaf Evening Primrose (Oenothera laciniataÂ Hill)\n\nObviously, the common name comes for the dissected leaves.Â Itâs not unusual for species of Oenothera to have lobed leaves, but these are the deepest Iâve seen.\n\nThis was growing along the bike trail near Fanning Springs, Florida. Also note how the sepals are reflexed away from the petals.\n\nOenothera pallida Douglas ex Lindl.\n\nPale Evening Primrose (Oenothera pallida Douglas ex Lindl.)\n\nThis was growing along the Capitol Gorge Road at Capitol Reef National Park.Â I certainly didnât expect to see a primrose in this area.Â The flower head, in relation to the rest of the plant is all out of proportion.Â I also like the yellow tinge at the base of the petals.\n\nEpilobium angustifolium L.\n\nFireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.)\n\nThe nomenclature is a little confused on this.Â The prepublication data for Flora of North America includes the genus Chamerion.Â The Plant List has Chamerion angustifolium as a synonym of Epilobium angustifolium.Â Wikipedia has it as Chamaenerion angustifolium. Â Hopefully when volumes 10 and 11 of Flora are published, it will clear this up.Â Regardless, a fireweed by any other name....\n\nFireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.)\n\nÂ The common name comes from the ability of this plant to become one of the first plants to establish after a fire.Â I first encountered this at Hayden Valley in Yellowstone and I keep running into it out west.Â\n\nNAPA, which lists it as Chamaenerion angustifolium shows it widely distributed across the west, northern U.S. and Canada.\n\nEpilobium anagallidifolium Lam.\n\nAlpine Willowherb (Epilobium anagallidifolium Lam.)\n\nThere are some of the smallest flowers Iâve encountered.Â Duckweed is an aquatic plant that is much, much smaller with only a single stamen and pistil and no petals or sepals, but this pretty much comes in second.Â The moss growing with it looks large in relationship.Â It took quite a few shots to even get the thing in focus. Â\n\nThis was at Silver Basin near Frenchman Mountain in The Bugaboos of British Columbia.\n\nThe long, reddish part of the flower (behind the petals) is the ovary.Â The petals and stamens are located on top of the ovary so the ovary is said to be inferior (to the petals and stamens).\n\nEpilobium canum (Greene) P.H. Raven\n\nÂ\n\nCalifornia Fuchsia (Epilobium canum (Greene) P.H. Raven)\n\nIâve run into this plant in three different places, and yes, they were all in California.Â It really doesnât look too much like fuchsia except for the way the stamens, stigma and style protrude from the floral tube.\n\nMy first encounter was on the Skull Rock Trail at Joshua Tree National Park.Â You canât imagine how this stood out against all the brown of the desert.Â It was like a red flag to a bull.\n\nThe next time was when I started my climb of Moro Rock in Sequoia National Park.Â This was growing just on the other side of the steps as I headed up.\n\nMy last encounter was at the visitor center of Channel Islands National Park in Ventura, California.Â Each and every time it was a stunner.\n\nEven though it is called California fuchsia, its found throughout the western U.S. (NAPA)\n\nEpilobium latifolium L.\n\nRiver Beauty, Red Willowherb (Epilobium latifolium L.)\n\nRiver beauty is a good name.Â It was growing along a stream that emptied into Lake Louise.\n\nRiver Beauty, Red Willowherb (Epilobium latifolium L.)\n\nThe flowers are spectacular!Â The color is amazing. Â\n\nLake Louise is a place Iâve heard about many times over the years but I never thought I would get a chance to go there. Â\n\nWhen my endocrinologist heard I was heading to Lake Louise, he suggested I hike to a certain location where he and his family had hiked.Â I carefully remember the name of the location at Lake Louise (now forgotten) and was surprised when our tour guide with Tauck made the same suggestion.Â The only problem was my endocrinologist had the wrong name.Â They still sold sandwiches (according to the tour guide) but I didnât make the hike.Â I was too busy taking photos of wildflowers along the lake.\n\nTetrapteron graciliflorum (Hooker & Arn.) W.L. Wagner & Hoch\n\nHill Sun Cup (Tetrapteron graciliflorum (Hooker & Arn.) W.L. Wagner & Hock)\n\nThese were growing trailside of The Balcones Trail at Pinnacles National Park.Â The yellow flowers stood out although they were very small.Â The characteristics of the leaves and the petals and the unopened flowers reminds me very much of the genus of evening primrose, Oenothera.\n\nHill Sun Cup (Tetrapteron graciliflorum (Hooker & Arn.) W.L. Wagner & Hock)\n\nNote the four yellow petals and also how the sepals are reflexed backwards.\n\nLudwigia peruviana (L.) H. Hara\n\nPrimrose-willow (Ludwigia peruviana (L.) H. Hara)\n\nThe genus Ludwigia is an old friend but this is a new species for me.Â Iâve walked the trails of Archbold Biological Station many years but it was on my last trip in October 2017 that I ran across this species.\n\nPrimrose-willow (Ludwigia peruviana (L.) H. Hara)\n\nThe thing that keys me in to the genus is the inferior ovary which is typically four-sided.Â The four or more sepals are attached to the top of the ovary and you can see the very short style and stigma poking above the ovary.Â The stems of Ludwigia are often also square in cross section.\n\nNAPA reports this in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.\n\nLudwigia octovalvis (Jacq.) P.H. Raven\n\nMexican Primrose Willow (Ludwigia octovalvis (Jacq.) P.H. Raven)\n\nI found this in September of 2013 in Big Cypress Preserve when my friend Pat introduced me to the loop road off the Old Tamiami Trail.Â Fortunately, I didnât have to wrestle alligators to get the shot.\n\nNAPA shows collections from Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Florida.Â The specific name suggests there are eight sections to the ovary (eight-valved).\n\nGaura angustifolia Michaux\n\nSouthern Beeblossom (Gaura angustifolia Michaux)\n\nThis little beauty was growing along the roadside to my campsite at Blue Spring State Park near Orange City, Florida.Â I immediately recognized it as a member of the primrose family but had to do a little digging to find the genus. Â\n\nIâve run into the genus Gaura before but for some reason, I always have to look it up to remember it.Â\n\nSouthern Beeblossom (Gaura angustifolia Michaux)\n\nEither the leaves have very large stipules at their base or the axillary bud is overactive in this species.\n\nSouthern Beeblossom (Gaura angustifolia Michaux)\n\nThe plant was a little past its prime in blooming but still beautiful.Â The flowers are tiny and at first I didnât think it was in bloom when I saw it.Â Not only are there four petals, four reflexed sepals and four stamens, but the stigma of the pistil is four-lobed.\n\nBlue Spring State Park\n\nThe water in the springs was cold but the manatees who overwinter had already headed south for their summer vacation.\n\nIt was a hot day and I admit to partaking of the springs.Â The bottom is nice and sandy but you do have to be careful of a few rocks scattered along the shoreline.
