        "text": "A deciduous shrub 3 to 5 ft high, with erect, semi-woody stems furnished at first with a pale tufted felt, which soon falls away. Leaves narrowly oval or ovate-lanceolate; 3 to 5 in. long, 11⁄2 to 2 in. wide; tapering at both ends, often long and slender-pointed, the central part only toothed; almost or quite glabrous, with numerous yellowish glands beneath; stalk 1⁄6 to 1⁄3 in. long. Flowers pale pink, crowded in axillary cymes which are 1 to 11⁄2 in. across, and expand in August. Fruit globular, about the size of peppercorns, violet.\n\nNative of Japan. Although this plant lives in the open ground at Kew, and is only killed in very severe winters, it really needs some sheltered, sunny corner, such as the angle of a house facing south-west, to be seen at its best. As it flowers and fruits on the shoots of the year, a mere cutting back by frost does not matter; some such pruning is necessary. A loamy soil, not enriched, is best for it.\n\nFrom the Supplement (Vol. V)"
