        "text": "Preamble Pre\n\nINTERNATIONAL CODE OF BOTANICAL NOMENCLATURE\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nBotany requires a precise and simple system of nomenclature used by\n\nbotanists in all countries, dealing, on the one hand, with the terms which\n\ndenote the ranks of taxonomic groups or units, and on the other hand with\n\nthe names which are applied to the individual taxonomic groups. The purpose\n\nof giving a name to a taxonomic group is not to indicate its characters or\n\nhistory, but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate its taxonomic\n\nrank. This Code aims at the provision of a stable method of naming taxonomic\n\ngroups, avoiding and rejecting the use of names which may cause error or\n\nambiguity or throw science into confusion. Next in importance is the avoidance\n\nof the useless creation of names. Other considerations, such as absolute\n\ngrammatical correctness, regularity or euphony of names, more or less pre~\n\nvailing custom, regard for persons, etc., notwithstanding their undeniable\n\nimportance, are relatively accessory.\n\nThe Principles form the basis of the system of botanical nomenclature.\n\nThe detailed provisions are divided into Rules, set out in the Articles, and\n\nRecommendations; the notes and examples attached to these are integral\n\nparts of them.\n\nThe object of the Rules is to put the nomenclature of the past into order\n\nand to provide for that of the future; names contrary to a rule cannot be\n\nmaintained.\n\nThe Recommendations deal with subsidiary points, their object being\n\nto bring about greater uniformity and clearness, especially in future nomen~\n\nclature; names contrary to a recommendation cannot, on that account, be\n\nrejected, but they are not examples to be followed.\n\nThe provisions regulating the method of amending this Code form its\n\nlast division.\n\nThe Rules and Recommendations apply throughout the plant kingdom,\n\nrecent and fossil. However, special provisions are needed for certain groups.\n\nThe International Microbiological Congress has therefore issued an Inter~\n\nnational Bacteriological Code of Nomenclature (Journ. Gen. Microbiology\n\n3 (3): 444~462. 1949). Similarly the International Horticultural Congress has\n\npublished an International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants\n\n(London, 1953). Provisions for the names of hybrids and some special\n\ncategories appear in Appendix I, and special provisions concerning fossil\n\nplants in Appendix II.\n\nThe only proper reasons for changing a name are either a more profound\n\nknowledge of the facts resulting from adequate taxonomic study or the\n\nnecessity of giving up a nomenclature that is contrary to the rules.\n\nIn the absence of a relevant Rule or where the consequences of rules are\n\ndoubtful, established custom is followed.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 01 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nI~VI Principles\n\nDivision I. Principles\n\nPrinciple I\n\nBotanical nomenclature is independent of zoological nomenclature, in\n\nthe sense that the name of a plant must not be rejected merely because it is\n\nidentical with the name of an animal. *\n\nPrinciple II\n\nThe application of names of taxonomic groups is determined by means\n\nof nomenclatural types.\n\nPrinciple III\n\nThe naming of taxonomic groups is based on priority of publication.\n\nPrinciple IV\n\nEach taxonomic group can bear only one correct name, the earliest that\n\nis in accordance with the Rules, except in specified cases.\n\nPrinciple V\n\nScientific names of plants are Latin or are treated as Latin.\n\nPrinciple VI\n\nThe Rules of nomenclature are retroactive except when expressly limited.\n\nSee Arts. 45 and 64 (3).\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 02 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nRanks 1~5\n\nDivision II. Rules and Recommendations\n\nChapter I. RANKS OF TAXA, AND THE TERMS DENOTING THEM\n\nArticle 1\n\nTaxonomic groups of any rank will, in this Code, be referred to as taxa\n\n(singular: taxon).\n\nArticle 2\n\nEvery plant is treated as belonging to a number of taxa of consecutively\n\nsubordinate ranks, among which the rank of species (species) is basic.\n\nArticle 3\n\nThe principal ranks of taxa in ascending sequence are: species (species),\n\ngenus (genus), family (familia), order (ordo), class (classis), and division\n\n(divisio). Thus each species belongs (is to be assigned) to a genus, each\n\ngenus to a family (certain artificial groups of fossil plants excepted), etc.\n\nArticle 4\n\nIf a greater number of ranks of taxa is required, the terms for these are\n\nmade either by adding the prefix sub (sub) to the terms denoting the ranks\n\nor by the introduction of supplementary terms. A plant may be assigned to\n\ntaxa of the following subordinate ranks: Regnum Vegetabile, Divisio, Sub~\n\ndivisio, Classis, Subclassis, Ordo, Subordo, Familia, Subfamilia, Tribus, Sub~\n\ntribus, Genus, Subgenus, Sectio, Subsectio, Series, Subseries, Species, Sub~\n\nspecies, Varietas, Subvarietas, Forma, Subforma.\n\nFurther supplementary ranks may be intercalated or added, provided\n\nthat confusion or error is not thereby introduced.\n\nFor special categories resulting from genetic analysis of taxa, see\n\nAppendix I.\n\nRecommendation 4A\n\nIn classifying parasites, especially parasitic fungi, authors who do not give specific\n\nvalue to taxa characterized from a physiological standpoint but scarcely or not at all\n\nfrom a morphological standpoint should distinguish within the species special forms (formae\n\nspeciales) characterized by their adaptation to different hosts.\n\nArticle 5\n\nThe relative order of the ranks specified above in Arts. 3 and 4 must\n\nnot be altered.\n\nA name given to a taxon which is at the same time denoted by a mis~\n\nplaced term is treated as not validly published, examples of such misplacement\n\nbeing a form divided into varieties, a species containing genera, or a genus\n\ncontaining families or tribes.\n\nAn exception is made for names of the infrageneric taxa termed tribes\n\n(tribus) in Fries Systema Mycologicum, which are treated as validly published.\n\nExample: The names Delphinium tribus Involuta Huth (Bot. Jahrb. 20: 365. 1895),\n\ntribus Brevipedunculata Huth (l.c. 20: 368. 1895), etc., are treated as not validly published,\n\nsince Huth misapplied the term tribus to a category of lower rank than a section.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 03 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n6~7 Definitions, typification\n\nChapter II. NAMES OF TAXA (GENERAL PROVISIONS)\n\nSection 1. DEFINITIONS\n\nArticle 6\n\nEffective publication is publication in accordance with Arts. 29 and 31.\n\nValid publication is publication in accordance with Arts. 32~45.\n\nA legitimate name or epithet is one that is in accordance with the rules.\n\nAn illegitimate name or epithet is one that is contrary to the rules.\n\nThe correct name of a taxon with a particular circumscription, position,\n\nand rank is the legitimate name which must be adopted for it under the rules\n\n(see Art. 11).\n\nNote. In this Code, unless otherwise indicated, the word name means\n\na name that has been validly published, whether it is legitimate or illegitimate.\n\nExample: The generic name Leptostachya Nees (in Wallich. Pl. As. Rar. 3: 105.\n\n1832), based on L. virgata Nees, is legitimate because it is in accordance with the rules.\n\nThe same is true of the generic name Dianthera L. (Sp. Pl. 27. 1753), based on what\n\nwas then the only species, D. americana L. Both generic names are correct when the\n\ngenera are thought to be separate. Bentham, however, reduced Leptostachya Nees to\n\nDianthera L.; when this concept is accepted the latter name is the only correct one for\n\nthe genus with this particular circumscription. The legitimate name Leptostachya may\n\ntherefore be correct or incorrect according to different concepts of taxa.\n\nSection 2. TYPIFICATION\n\nArticle 7\n\nThe application of names of taxa of the rank of order or below is\n\ndetermined by means of nomenclatural types. A nomenclatural type (typus)\n\nis that constituent element of a taxon to which the name of the taxon is\n\npermanently attached, whether as an accepted name or as a synonym.\n\nNote 1. The nomenclatural type is not necessarily the most typical or\n\nrepresentative element of a taxon: it is merely that element with which the\n\nname is permanently associated.\n\nNote 2. A holotype (type) is the one specimen or other element used\n\nby the author or designated by him as the nomenclatural type. For so long\n\nas a holotype is extant, it automatically fixes the application of the name\n\nconcerned.\n\nNote 3. If no holotype has been indicated by the author who described\n\na taxon, or when the holotype is lost or destroyed, a substitute for it may\n\nbe chosen, unless its name must already be rejected under this Code. The\n\nauthor who makes this choice must be followed unless his choice is superseded\n\nunder the provisions of Art. 8.\n\nThe substitute may be either a lectotype or a neotype. A lectotype always\n\ntakes precedence over a neotype.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 04 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nTypification 8~9\n\nA lectotype is a specimen or other element selected from the original\n\nmaterial to serve as nomenclatural type when the holotype was not designated\n\nat the time of publication or for so long as it is missing.\n\nWhen two or more specimens have been designated as types by the\n\nauthor of a name (e.g. male and female, flowering and fruiting, etc.), one\n\nof them must be chosen as lectotype.\n\nA neotype is a specimen selected to serve as nomenclatural type for so\n\nlong as all of the material on which the name of the taxon was based is\n\nmissing.\n\nNote 4. When a new name or epithet was published as an avowed\n\nsubstitute (nomen novum) for an older one which is not available, the type\n\nof the old name is automatically that of the new one.\n\nNote 5. The typification of organ genera, form genera, genera based\n\non plant microfossils (pollen, spores, etc.), genera of imperfect fungi, and\n\nany other analogous genera or lower taxa does not differ from that indicated\n\nabove.\n\nArticle 8\n\nThe choice of a lectotype or neotype is superseded if the original material\n\nis rediscovered, or if it can be shown that the choice was based upon a\n\nmisinterpretation of the original description.\n\nRecommendation 8A\n\nFor other specimens of special interest the following terms are recommended:\n\nAn isotype is a duplicate of the holotype.\n\nA paratype is a specimen cited with the original description other than the holotype\n\nor isotype(s).\n\nA syntype is one of two or more specimens used by the author when no holotype was\n\ndesignated, or one of two or more specimens simultaneously designated as type.\n\nRecommendation 8B\n\nIt cannot be too strongly recommended that the original material, especially the\n\nholotype, of a taxon be deposited in a permanent responsible institution and that it be\n\nscrupulously conserved. When living material is designated as a type, appropriate parts\n\nof it should be immediately preserved.\n\nRecommendation 8C\n\nWhenever the type material of a taxon is heterogeneous, the lectotype should be\n\nso selected as to preserve current usage unless another element agrees better with the\n\noriginal description and (or) figure.\n\nRecommendation 8D\n\nFor the name of a fossil species, the lectotype, when one is needed, should, if possible,\n\nbe a specimen illustrated at the time of the first valid publication.\n\nRecommendation 8E\n\nThe listed type species of a conserved generic name (see Art. 14) should not be\n\nchanged without irrefutable evidence in support of such action.\n\nArticle 9\n\nThe nomenclatural type of an order or of any taxon of a rank between\n\norder and family is the family whose name is based on the same generic\n\nname, that of a family or of any taxon between family and genus is the genus\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 05 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n10~11 Priority\n\non whose present or former name that of the taxon concerned is based (see also\n\nArt. 18), and that of a genus or of any taxon between genus and species\n\nis a species. The types of the names of families not founded on generic names\n\nare the types of their alternative names (see Art. 18).\n\nArticle 10\n\nThe nomenclatural type (holotype, lectotype, or neotype) of a species\n\nor taxon below the rank of species is a single specimen or other element\n\nexcept in the following case: for small herbaceous plants and for most non~\n\nvascular plants, the type may consist of more than one individual, which ought\n\nto be conserved permanently and assembled on one herbarium sheet or\n\npreparation.\n\nIf it is later proved that such a type herbarium sheet or preparation\n\ncontains parts belonging to more than one taxon, the name must remain\n\nattached to that part (lectotype) which corresponds most nearly with the\n\noriginal description.\n\nNote. For plants of which it is impossible to preserve a type specimen,\n\nor for a species without a type specimen, the type may be a description or\n\nfigure.\n\nExamples: The holotype of the polygamous species Rheedia kappleri Eyma is a male\n\nspecimen collected by Kappler (593a in Herb. Utrecht). The author designated a\n\nhermaphroditic specimen collected by the Forestry Service of Suriname as a paratype\n\n(B.W. 1618 in Herb. Utrecht).\n\nThe type sheet of Tillandsia bryoides Griseb. ex Baker (Journ. of Bot. 16: 236. 1878)\n\nis Lorentz no. 128 in Herb. Mus. Brit.; this sheet, however, proves to be a mixture. L. B.\n\nSmith (Proc. Amer. Acad. 70: 192. 1935) acted in accordance with Art. 10 in designating\n\none element of Lorentz specimen as the lectotype.\n\nSection 3. PRIORITY\n\nArticle 11\n\nEach order or taxon of lower rank with a particular circumscription,\n\nposition, and rank can bear only one correct name, special exceptions being\n\nmade for 9 families for which alternative names are permitted (see Art. 18)\n\nand for certain fungi (see Art. 59).\n\nFor any taxon from order to genus inclusive, the correct name is the\n\nearliest legitimate one validly published with the same rank, except in cases\n\nof limitation of priority by conservation (see Arts. 14 and 15).\n\nFor any taxon below the rank of genus, the correct name is the combination\n\nof the earliest available legitimate epithet validly published in the same rank\n\nwith the correct name of the genus, species, or taxon of lower rank to which\n\nit is assigned.\n\nThe principle of priority does not apply to names of taxa above the rank\n\nof order (see Art. 16).\n\nNote. The name of a taxon below the rank of genus, consisting of the\n\nname of a genus combined with one or more epithets, is termed a combination.\n\nExamples of combinations: Gentiana lutea, Gentiana nivalis var. occidentalis, Equisetum\n\npalustre var. americanum f. fluitans.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 06 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nStarting points 12~13\n\nSection 4.

Schlotheim, Petrefactenkunde, 1820, is regarded as published\n\nbefore 31 Dec. 1820.\n\nNote 2. It is agreed to associate generic names which first appear in\n\nLinnaeus Species Plantarum ed. 1 (1753) and ed. 2 (1762~63) with the first\n\nsubsequent description given under those names in Linnaeus Genera Plan~\n\ntarum ed. 5 (1754) and ed. 6 (1764) (see Art. 39).\n\nNote 3. The two volumes of Linnaeus Species Plantarum ed. 1 (1753),\n\nwhich appeared in May and August, 1753, respectively, are treated as having\n\nbeen published simultaneously on the former date (1 May 1753).\n\nExample: The generic names Thea L. Sp. Pl. 515 (May 1753) and Camellia L. Sp. Pl.\n\n698 (Aug. 1753), Gen. Pl. ed. 5. 311 (1754), are treated as if they had been published\n\nsimultaneously in May 1753. Under Art. 57 the combined genus bears the name Camellia,\n\nsince Sweet (Hort. Suburb. Lond. 157. 1818), who was the first to unite the two genera,\n\nchose that name, citing Thea as a synonym.\n\nNote 4. For nomenclatural purposes names given to lichens shall be\n\nconsidered as applying to their fungal components.\n\nArticle 14\n\nIn order to avoid disadvantageous changes in the nomenclature of genera,\n\nfamilies, orders, and intermediate taxa entailed by the strict application of\n\nthe rules, and especially of the principle of priority in starting from the dates\n\ngiven in Art. 13, this Code provides, in Appendix III, lists of names that are\n\nconserved (nomina conservanda) and must be retained as exceptions. These\n\nnames are preferably such as have come into general use in the fifty years\n\nfollowing their publication, or which have been used in monographs and\n\nimportant floristic works up to the year 1890.\n\nNote 1. These lists of conserved names will remain permanently open\n\nfor additions. Any proposal of an additional name must be accompanied by\n\na detailed statement of the cases both for and against its conservation. Such\n\nproposals must be submitted to the General Committee (see Division III),\n\nwhich will refer them for examination to the committees for the various\n\ntaxonomic groups.\n\nNote 2. The application of both conserved and rejected names is de~\n\ntermined by nomenclatural types.\n\nNote 3. A conserved name is conserved against all other names for the\n\ntaxon whether these are cited in the corresponding list of rejected names\n\nor not, so long as the taxon concerned is not united with another one bearing\n\na legitimate name. In the event of union with another taxon, the earlier of\n\nthe two competing names is adopted in accordance with Art. 57.\n\nExamples: If the genus Weihea Spreng. (1825) is united with Cassipourea Aubl.\n\n(1775), the combined genus will bear the prior name Cassipourea, although Weihea is\n\nconserved and Cassipourea is not. ~ If Mahonia Nutt. (1818) is united with Berberis L.\n\n(1753) the combined genus will bear the prior name Berberis, although Mahonia is conserved.\n\n~ Nasturtium R. Br. (1812) was conserved only in the restricted sense, for a monotypic genus\n\nbased on N. officinale R. Br., hence, if it is reunited with Rorippa Scop. (1760), it\n\nmust bear the name Rorippa.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 08 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nNomina conservanda 15\n\nNote 4. When a name has been conserved against an earlier synonym,\n\nthe latter is to be restored, subject to Art. 11, if it is considered the name\n\nof a genus distinct from that of the nomen conservandum.\n\nExample: The generic name Luzuriaga Ruiz & Pav. (1802) is conserved against the earlier\n\nnames Enargea Banks ex Gaertn. (1788) and Callixene Juss. (1789). If, however, Enargea\n\nBanks ex Gaertn. is considered to be a separate genus, the name Enargea is retained for\n\nthis.\n\nNote 5. A conserved name is conserved against all its earlier validly\n\npublished homonyms.\n\nExample: The generic name Swartzia Schreb. (1791), conserved against Tounatea\n\nAubl., Possira Aubl., and Hoelzelia Neck., is thereby conserved automatically against the\n\nearlier homonym Swartzia Ehrh. (1787).\n\nNote 6. Provision for the retention of a name in a sense that excludes\n\nthe type is made in Art. 48.\n\nArticle 15\n\nWhen a name proposed for conservation has been provisionally approved\n\nby the General Committee, botanists are authorized to retain it pending the\n\ndecision of a later International Botanical Congress.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 09 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n16~18 Names of higher taxa\n\nChapter III. NOMENCLATURE OF TAXA ACCORDING TO\n\nTHEIR RANK\n\nSection 1. NAMES OF TAXA ABOVE THE RANK OF ORDER\n\nArticle 16\n\nThe principles of priority and typification do not apply to names of\n\ntaxa above the rank of order.\n\nRecommendation 16A\n\n(a) The name of a division is preferably taken from characters indicating the nature of\n\nthe division as closely as possible; they should end in ~phyta, except when it is a division\n\nof FUNGI, in which case it should end in ~mycota. Words of Greek origin are generally\n\npreferable.\n\nThe name of a subdivision is formed in a similar manner; it is distinguished from\n\ndivisional names by an appropriate prefix or suffix or by the ending ~phytina, except when\n\nit is a subdivision of FUNGI, in which case it should end in ~mycotina.\n\n(b) The name of a class or of a subclass is formed in a similar manner and should\n\nend as follows:\n\n1. In the ALGAE: ~phyceae (classes) and ~phycidae (subclasses);\n\n2. In the FUNGI: ~mycetes (classes) and ~mycetidae (subclasses);\n\n3. In the CORMOPHYTA: ~opsida (classes) and ~idae (subclasses).\n\nSection 2. NAMES OF ORDERS AND SUBORDERS\n\nArticle 17\n\nThe name of an order is taken from that of its type family, and has the\n\nending ~ales.\n\nA suborder is designated in a similar manner, with the ending ~ineae.\n\nExamples of names of orders: Fucales, Polygonales, Urticales; suborders:\n\nBromeliineae, Malvineae.\n\nSection 3. NAMES OF FAMILIES AND SUBFAMILIES,\n\nTRIBES AND SUBTRIBES\n\nArticle 18\n\nThe name of a family is a plural adjective used as a substantive; it is\n\nformed by adding the suffix ~aceae to the name of its type genus\n\nor of a synonym of this name, even if illegitimate. (For the treatment of\n\nfinal vowels of stems in composition, see Rec 73G).\n\nExamples: Rosaceae (from Rosa), Salicaceae (from Salix), Plumbaginaceae (from\n\nPlumbago), Caryophyllaceae (from Caryophyllus, a pre~linnaean generic name), Winteraceae\n\n(from Wintera Murr., a synonym of Drimys J.R. & G.Forst.).\n\nNote 1. When a name of a family has been published with an improper\n\ntermination, the ending must be changed to accord with the rule, without\n\nchange of the authors name.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 10 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nGeneric names 19~20\n\nNote 2. The following names, sanctioned by long usage, are treated as\n\nexceptions to the rule: Palmae, Gramineae, Cruciferae, Leguminosae, Gutti~\n\nferae, Umbelliferae, Labiatae, Compositae.\n\nThose who regard the Papilionaceae as constituting an independent\n\nfamily may use that name, although it is not formed in the prescribed manner.\n\nBotanists are authorized, however, to use as alternatives the appropriate\n\nnames ending in ~aceae.\n\nArticle 19\n\nThe name of a subfamily is a plural adjective used as a substantive:\n\nit is formed by adding the suffix ~oideae to the stem of the name of its\n\ntype genus or of a synonym of this name. A tribe is designated in a similar\n\nmanner, with the ending ~eae, and a subtribe with the ending ~inae.\n\nExamples of names of subfamilies: Asphodeloideae (from Asphodelus), Rumicoideae\n\n(from Rumex); tribes: Asclepiadeae (from Asclepias), Phyllantheae (from Phyllanthus);\n\nsubtribes: Rutinae (from Ruta), Madiinae (from Madia).\n\nNote. When a name of a taxon belonging to one of the above categories\n\nhas been published with an improper termination, such as ~eae for a sub~\n\nfamily or ~oideae for a tribe, the ending must be changed to accord with the\n\nrule, without change of the authors name. However, when the rank of the\n\ngroup is changed by a later author, his name is then cited as author for the\n\nname, with the appropriate ending, in the usual way.\n\nExample: The subfamily name Climacieae Grout, Moss Fl. N. Am. 3: 4 (1928) must\n\nbe changed to Climacioideae with rank and authority unchanged. If it is held necessary\n\nto change the rank of this taxon to a tribe, then the name Climacieae must be used followed\n\nby the name of the author making the change.\n\nSection 4. NAMES OF GENERA AND SUBDIVISIONS OF GENERA*\n\nArticle 20\n\nThe name of a genus is a substantive, or an adjective used as a sub~\n\nstantive, in the singular number.\n\nIt may be taken from any source whatever, and may even be composed\n\nin an absolutely arbitrary manner.\n\nExamples: Rosa, Convolvulus, Hedysarum, Bartramia, Liquidambar, Gloriosa, Impatiens.\n\nManihot, Ifloga (an anagram of Filago).\n\nRecommendation 20A\n\nBotanists who are forming generic names should comply with the following suggestions:\n\n(a) To use Latin terminations insofar as possible.\n\n(b) To avoid names not readily adaptable to the Latin tongue.\n\n(c) Not to make names very long or difficult to pronounce.\n\n(d) Not to make names by combining words from different languages.\n\n(e) To indicate, if possible, by the formation or ending of the name the affinities\n\nor analogies of the genus.\n\n(f) To avoid adjectives used as nouns.\n\n(g) Not to use a name similar to or derived from the epithet of one of the species\n\nof the taxon.\n\n_________________\n\n) Here and elsewhere in the Code the phrase subdivision of a genus refers only\n\nto taxa between genus and species in rank.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 11 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n21~22 Names of subdivisions of genera\n\n(h) Not to dedicate genera to persons quite unconnected with botany or at least\n\nwith natural science.\n\n(i) To give a feminine form to all personal generic names, whether they commemorate\n\na man or a woman.\n\nArticle 21\n\nThe name of a subdivision of a genus is a combination of a generic\n\nname and a subdivisional epithet connected by a term (subgenus, section,\n\nseries, etc.) denoting its rank.\n\nThe epithet of a subgenus or section must not be formed from the name\n\nof the genus to which it belongs by adding the ending ~oides or ~opsis.\n\nExamples: Banisteria subg. Hemiramma; Ricinocarpus sect. Anomodiscus; Sapium\n\nsubgenus Patentinervia; Euphorbia sect. Tithymalus subsect. Tenellae.\n\nThe same epithet may be used for subdivisions of different genera, but\n\ntwo subdivisions of the same genus, even if they are of different rank, can~\n\nnot bear the same epithet unless they are based on the same type.\n\nExample: Under Verbascum the sectional epithets Aulacosperma and Bothrosperma\n\nare allowed although there are also in the genus Celsia two sections named Aulacospermae\n\nand Bothrospermae. These however, are not examples to be followed, since they are\n\ncontrary to Rec. 22A.\n\nRecommendation 21A\n\nFor a subgenus and a section the epithet is usually a substantive resembling the name\n\nof a genus or repeating the name of the genus itself (see Art. 22).\n\nFor a subsection and a lower subdivision of a genus the epithet is preferably a\n\nplural adjective agreeing in gender with the generic name and written with a capital\n\ninitial letter.\n\nArticle 22\n\nThe subgenus or section including the type species of the correct name\n\nof the genus to which it is assigned repeats that name unaltered as its epithet,\n\nbut contrary to Art 46, without citation of an authors name.\n\nSimilarly, a section including the type species of any subgenus must bear\n\nas its epithet the correct epithet of the subgenus.\n\nValid publication of a name for a subgenus or section which does not\n\ninclude the nomenclatural type of the next higher taxon automatically circum~\n\nscribes another subgenus or section which has as its type the type of this\n\nhigher taxon and which bears the generic name (or subgeneric epithet)\n\nunaltered as its epithet.\n\nExamples: The subgenus of Croton L. containing the lectotype of the genus (C.\n\ntiglium L.) must be called Croton subg. Croton and not Croton subg. Eluteria Griseb.\n\nThe section of the genus Mouriri Aubl. containing the type species of the subgenus\n\nTaphroxylon Morley (M. acutiflora Naudin) must be called Mouriri subg. Taphroxylon\n\nMorley sect. Taphroxylon and not Mouriri sect. Acutiflos Morley.\n\nRecommendation 22A\n\nBotanists proposing an epithet for a subdivision of a genus should avoid adopting\n\none already used for a subdivision of a closely related genus, or one which is identical with\n\nthe name of such a genus.\n\nThey should also avoid the use of epithets in the form of a substantive together\n\nwith others in the form of a plural adjective in co~ordinated subdivisions of a genus.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 12 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nSpecific names 23\n\nIf it is desired to indicate the resemblance of a subgenus or section (other than the\n\ntype subgenus or section) of one genus to another genus, the ending ~oides or ~opsis may be\n\nadded to the name of that other genus to form the epithet of the subgenus or section\n\nconcerned.\n\nRecommendation 22B\n\nWhen it is desired to indicate the name of a subdivision of the genus to which a\n\nparticular species belongs in connection with the generic name and specific epithet, its epithet\n\nis placed in parentheses between the two; when necessary, its rank is also indicated.\n\nExamples: Astragalus (Cycloglottis) contortuplicatus; Loranthus (sect. Ischnanthus)\n\ngabonensis.\n\nSection 5. NAMES OF SPECIES\n\nArticle 23\n\nThe name of a species is a binary combination consisting of the name of\n\nthe genus followed by a single specific epithet. If an epithet consists of two\n\nor more words, these must either be united or hyphened. An epithet not so\n\njoined when originally published is not to be rejected but, when used, must\n\nbe hyphened (see also Art. 70 (5)).\n\nThe epithet of a species may be taken from any source whatever, and\n\nmay even be composed arbitrarily.\n\nExamples: Cornus sanguinea, Dianthus monspessulanus, Papaver rhoeas, Uromyces\n\nfabae, Fumaria gussonei, Geranium robertianum, Embelia sarasinorum, Atropa bella~donna,\n\nImpatiens noli~tangere, Adiantum capillus~veneris.\n\nSymbols forming part of specific epithets proposed by Linnaeus must\n\nbe transcribed.\n\nExamples: Scandix pecten ♀ L. must be transcribed as Scandix pecten~veneris;\n\nVeronica anagallis ∇ L. must be transcribed as Veronica anagallis~aquatica.\n\nThe specific epithet, when adjectival in form and not used as a sub~\n\nstantive, agrees in gender with the generic name.\n\nExamples: Helleborus niger, Brassica nigra, Verbascum nigrum, Rubus amnicola; Peri~\n\ndermium balsameum Peck. but also Gloeosporium balsameae J. J. Davis, both from Abies\n\nbalsamea,the specific epithet of which is treated as a substantive in the second example.\n\nBinary combinations of a specific epithet with the word Anonymos (and\n\nsimilar token words) are illegitimate, since the word Anonymos is not a\n\ngeneric name (see Art. 68(1)). Such combinations are not taken into\n\nconsideration for purposes of priority of the epithet concerned.\n\nExamples: The binary combination Anonymos aquatica Walt. (Fl. Carol. 230. 1788) is\n\nillegitimate. The correct name for the species concerned is Planera aquatica J. F. Gmel.\n\n(1791), and the date of the epithet aquatica for purposes of priority is 1791. The species\n\nmust not be cited as Planera aquatica (Walt.) J. F. Gmel. If, however, it is desired to indicate\n\nthat the epithet originated with Walter, the name may be cited as Planera aquatica [Walt.]\n\nJ. F. Gmel.\n\nRecommendation 23A\n\nNames of men and women and also of countries and localities used as specific epithets\n\nmay be substantives in the genitive (clusii, saharae) or adjectives (clusianus, dahuricus).\n\nIt will be well, in the future, to avoid the use of the genitive and the adjectival form\n\nof the same word to designate two different species of the same genus; for example\n\nLysimachia hemsleyana Maxim. (1891) and L. hemsleyi Franch. (1895).\n\nRecommendation 23B\n\nIn forming specific epithets, botanists should comply also with the following suggestions:\n\n(a) To use Latin terminations insofar as possible.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 13 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n24 Infraspecific names\n\n(b) To avoid those which are very long and difficult to pronounce.\n\n(c) Not to make epithets by combining words from different languages.\n\n(d) To avoid specific epithets formed of two or more hyphened words.\n\n(e) To avoid epithets which have the same meaning as the generic name (pleonasm).\n\n(f) To avoid those which express a character common to all or nearly all the\n\nspecies of a genus.\n\n(g) To avoid in the same genus epithets which are very much alike, especially those\n\nwhich differ only in their last letters or in the arrangement of two letters.\n\n(h) To avoid epithets which have been used before in any closely allied genus.\n\n(i) Not to adopt unpublished names found in travellers notes or in herbaria,\n\nattributing them to their authors, unless these have approved publication.\n\n(j) To avoid using the names of little~known or very restricted localities, unless\n\nthe species is quite local.\n\nSection 6. NAMES OF TAXA BELOW THE RANK OF SPECIES\n\n(INFRASPECIFIC TAXA)\n\nArticle 24\n\nEpithets of subspecies and varieties are formed as those of species and\n\nfollow them in order, beginning with those of the highest rank. When adjectival\n\nin form and not used as substantives, they agree grammatically with the\n\ngeneric name.\n\nSimilarly for subvarieties, forms, and slight or transient modifications\n\nof wild plants, which receive either epithets or numbers or letters to facilitate\n\ntheir arrangement.\n\nCertain epithets specified in Art. 71 may not be used for infraspecific\n\ntaxa (except as provided in that Article).\n\nThe use of a binary combination for an infraspecific taxon is not\n\nadmissible. It is permissible to cite more complicated names as ternary com~\n\nbinations, provided that the rank of the taxon is stated.\n\nExamples: Andropogon ternatus subsp. macrothrix (not Andropogon macrothrix or\n\nAndropogon ternatus subsp. A. macrothrix); Herniaria hirsuta var. diandra (not Herniaria\n\ndiandra or Herniaria hirsuta var. H. diandra); Trifolium stellatum forma nanum (not nana).\n\nSaxifraga aizoon subforma surculosa Engler & Irmscher is permissible for Saxifraga\n\naizoon var. aizoon subvar. brevifolia forma multicaulis subforma surculosa Engler & Irmscher.\n\nThe same epithet may be used for infraspecific taxa within different\n\nspecies, and those within one species may bear the same epithets as other\n\nspecies.\n\nExamples: Rosa jundzillii var. leioclada and Rosa glutinosa var. leioclada; Viola tricolor\n\nvar. hirta in spite of the previous existence of a different species named Viola hirta.\n\nRecommendation 24A\n\nRecommendations made for specific epithets (see Rec. 23A, B) apply equally to\n\ninfraspecific epithets.\n\nRecommendation 24B\n\nSpecial forms (formae speciales) are preferably named after the host species; if\n\ndesired, epithets formed of two words joined by a hyphen may be used.\n\nExamples: Puccinia hieracii f. sp. villosi; Pucciniastrum epilobii f. sp. abieti~chamaenerii.\n\nRecommendation 24C\n\nBotanists proposing new infraspecific epithets should avoid such as have been used\n\npreviously for species in the same genus.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 14 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInfraspecific names 35~38\n\nArticle 25\n\nFor nomenclatural purposes, a species or any taxon below the rank of\n\nspecies is regarded as the sum of its lower taxa, if any.\n\nThe description of a subordinated taxon which does not include the\n\nnomenclatural type of the higher taxon automatically creates a second sub~\n\nordinated taxon of the same rank which has as its nomenclatural type the type\n\nof the higher taxon (see Art. 35).\n\nExample: The publication in 1843 of Lycopodium inundatum L. var. bigelovii Tuckerm.\n\nautomatically circumscribes another variety, Lycopodium inundatum L. var. inundatum, the\n\ntype of which is that of Lycopodium inundatum L.\n\nArticle 26\n\nIn the name of an infraspecific taxon which includes the nomenclatural\n\ntype of the epithet of the next higher taxon, the epithet of this higher taxon\n\nmust be repeated unaltered but, contrary to Art. 46, without citation of an\n\nauthors name. This epithet can no longer be used when that of the next\n\nhigher taxon is changed.\n\nExamples: The binary combination Lobelia spicata Lam. var. originalis McVaugh,\n\nwhich includes the type of Lobelia spicata Lam., must be replaced by Lobelia spicata Lam.\n\nvar. spicata.\n\nSince under Lobelia siphilitica L. there is described var. ludoviciana A. DC one must\n\nwrite Lobelia siphilitica L. var. siphilitica if only that part of L. siphilitica L. which includes\n\nthe type is meant.\n\nSince under Vochysia rufa Mart. subsp. sericea (Pohl) Stafl. there is described\n\na variety fulva Stafl. one must write Vochysia rufa Mart. subsp. sericea (Pohl) Stafl. var.\n\nsericea if only that part of the subsp. sericea (Pohl) Stafl. which includes the type is meant.\n\nAn infraspecific epithet may repeat unchanged that of the next higher\n\ntaxon only when it has the same nomenclatural type.\n\nArticle 27\n\nTwo infraspecific taxa within the same species, even if they are of\n\ndifferent rank, cannot bear the same infraspecific epithet, unless their names\n\nare based on the same type. If the earlier infraspecific name was validly\n\npublished, the later one is illegitimate and must be rejected.\n\nExamples: The following is inadmissible: Erysimum hieraciifolium subsp. strictum var.\n\nlongisiliquum and E. hieraciifolium subsp. pannonicum var. longisiliquum ~ a form of\n\nnomenclature which allows two varieties bearing the same epithet in the same species.\n\nThe name Andropogon sorghum subsp. halepensis (L.) Hackel var. halepensis is\n\nlegitimate, since the subspecies and the variety have the same type and the epithet must\n\nbe repeated under Art. 26.\n\nSection 7. NAMES OF PLANTS IN CULTIVATION\n\nArticle 28\n\nPlants brought into cultivation from the wild and which differ in no fun~\n\ndamental way from the parent stocks bear the same names as are applied to\n\nthe same species and infraspecific taxa in nature.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 15 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n28 Cultivated plants\n\nPlants arising in cultivation through hybridization, mutation or other\n\nprocesses which tend to establish recognizable differences from the parent\n\nstocks receive epithets, preferably in common language (i.e. fancy epithets),\n\nmarkedly different from the Latin epithets of species or varieties.\n\nDetailed regulations for the nomenclature of plants in cultivation appear\n\nin the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 16 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nEffective publication 29~30\n\nChapter IV. EFFECTIVE AND VALID PUBLICATION\n\nSection 1. CONDITIONS AND DATES OF EFFECTIVE PUBLICATION\n\nArticle 29\n\nPublication is effected, under this Code, only by distribution of printed matter (through sale, exchange, or gift) to the general public or at least to\n\nbotanical institutions with libraries accessible to botanists generally. It is\n\nnot effected by communication of new names at a public meeting, by the\n\nplacing of names in collections or gardens open to the public, or by the issue\n\nof microfilm made from manuscripts, typescripts, or other unpublished material.\n\nOffer for sale of printed matter that does not exist does not constitute\n\neffective publication.\n\nPublication by indelible autograph before 1 Jan. 1953 is accepted.\n\nNote. For the purpose of this Article, handwritten material, even though\n\nreproduced by some mechanical or graphic process (such as lithography,\n\noffset, metallic etching, or microfilm), is still considered as autographic.\n\nExamples: Effective publication without printed matter: Salvia oxyodon Webb &\n\nHeldr. was published in July 1850 in an autograph catalogue placed on sale (Webb &\n\nHeldreich, Catalogus Plantarum Hispanicarum.... ab A. Blanco lectarum, Paris, July 1850.\n\nfolio).\n\nEffective publication in reproduced handwritten material: H. Léveillé, Flore du Kouy\n\nTchéou (1914~15), a work lithographed from the handwritten manuscript.\n\nNon~effective publication at a public meeting: Cusson announced his establishment\n\nof the genus Physospermum in a memoir read at the Société des Sciences de Montpellier\n\nin 1770, and later in 1782 or 1783 at the Société de Médecine de Paris, but its effective\n\npublication dates from 1787 in the Mémoires de la Société Royale de Médecine de Paris\n\n5(1): 279.\n\nPublication on or after 1 Jan. 1953 of a new name in tradesmens\n\ncatalogues or in non~scientific newspapers, even if accompanied by a Latin\n\ndiagnosis, does not constitute effective publication.\n\nRecommendation 29A\n\nAuthors are urged scrupulously to avoid publishing new names or descriptions in\n\nephemeral publications, in popular periodicals, in any publication unlikely to reach the\n\ngeneral botanical public, in those produced by such methods that their permanence is\n\nunlikely, or in abstracting journals.\n\nArticle 30\n\nThe date of effective publication is the date on which the printed matter\n\nbecame available as defined in Art. 29. In the absence of proof establishing\n\nsome other date, the one appearing in the printed matter must be accepted\n\nas correct.\n\nExamples: There is some reason for supposing that the first volume of Adansons\n\nFamilles des Plantes was published in 1762, but in the absence of certainty the date 1763\n\non the title~page is assumed to be correct. ~ Individual parts of Willdenows Species\n\nPlantarum were published as follows: 1(1), 1797; 1(2), 1798; 2(1), 1799; 2(2), 1800;\n\n3(1) (to page 850), 1800; 3(2) (to page 1470), 1802; 3(3) (to page 2409), 1803\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 17 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n31~32 Valid publication\n\n(and later than Michaux Flora Boreali-Americana); 4(1) (to page 630), 1805; 4(2), 1806;\n\nthese dates, which are partly in disagreement with those on the title-pages of the volumes,\n\nare the dates of publication (see Rhodora 44: 147-150. 1942).\n\nWhen separates from periodicals or other works placed on sale are issued\n\nin advance, the date on the separate is accepted as the date of effective\n\npublication unless there is evidence that it is erroneous.\n\nExamples: Publication in separates issued in advance: the Selaginella species published\n\nby Hieronymus in Hedwigia 51: 241~272 (1912) were effectively published on 15 Oct. 1911,\n\nsince the volume in which the paper appeared states (p. ii) that the separate appeared\n\non that date.\n\nArticle 31\n\nThe distribution on or after 1 Jan. 1953 of exsiccata relative to any new\n\ntaxon, accompanied by an original diagnosis, even if this is printed, does not\n\nconstitute effective publication.\n\nNote. If the printed matter is also distributed independently of the\n\nexsiccata, this constitutes effective publication.\n\nExample: Works such as Schedae operis..... Plantae Finlandiae Exsiccatae, Helsingfors\n\n1. 1906. 2. 1916. 3. 1933, 1944, or Lundell & Nannfeldt. Fungi Exsiccatae Suecici etc.,\n\nUppsala 1~....., 1934~....., whether published before or after 1 Jan. 1953, are effectively\n\npublished.\n\nSection 2. CONDITIONS AND DATES OF VALID PUBLICATION\n\nArticle 32\n\nIn order to be validly published, a name of a taxon of recent plants\n\nmust be both (1) effectively published (see Art. 29) and (2) accompanied by\n\na description of the taxon or by a reference (direct or indirect) to a previously\n\nand effectively published description of it.\n\nExamples of names not validly published: Egeria Néraud (in Gaudichaud. Bot. Voy.\n\nFreycinet 28. 1826), published without a description or a reference to a former description. ~\n\nThe name Loranthus macrosolen Steud. originally appeared without a description on the\n\nprinted tickets issued about the year 1843, with Sect. II. no. 529, 1288, of Schimpers\n\nherbarium specimens of Abyssinian plants; it was not validly published, however, until\n\nA. Richard (Tent. Fl. Abys. 1: 340. 1847) supplied a description.\n\nExample of validation of a combination by indirect reference: The publication of\n\nthe new combination Cymbopogon martini by W. Watson in Atkinson. Gaz. NW. Provo India\n\n10: 392 (1882) is validated by the addition of the number 309, which, as explained at\n\nthe top of the same page, is the running~number of the species (Andropogon martini Roxb.)\n\nin Steudel. Syn. Pl. Glum. 1: 388 (1854). Although the reference to the synonym Andropogon\n\nmartini is indirect, it is perfectly unambiguous.\n\nA combination is not validly published unless the author definitely\n\nindicates that the epithet or epithets concerned are to be used in that particular\n\ncombination.\n\nExamples of combinations definitely indicated: In Linnaeus Species Plantarum the\n\nplacing of the epithet in the margin opposite the name of the genus clearly indicates\n\nthe combination intended. The same result is attained in Millers Gardeners Dictionary, ed. 8.\n\nby the inclusion of the epithet in parentheses immediately after the name of the genus,\n\nin Steudels Nomenclator Botanicus by the arrangement of the epithets in a list headed by\n\nthe name of the genus, and in general by any typographical device which indicates that\n\nan epithet is associated with a particular generic or other name.\n\nExamples of combinations not definitely indicated: Rafinesques statement under\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 18 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nValid publication 33~34\n\nBlephilia (in Journ. Phys. Chim. Hist. Nat. 89: 98. 1819) that Le type de ce genre est\n\nla Monarda ciliata Linn. does not constitute publication of the combination Blephilia\n\nciliata, since he did not indicate that that combination was to be used. Similarly, the\n\ncombination Eulophus peucedanoides must not be ascribed to Bentham and Hooker f.\n\non the basis of the listing of Cnidium peucedanoides H.B.K. under Eulophus (Gen. Pl.\n\n1: 885. 1867).\n\nA new transfer or combination published on or after 1 Jan. 1953 is not\n\nvalidly published unless the basionym (name~bringing or epithet~bringing\n\nsynonym) is clearly indicated with a full reference to its author and original\n\npublication.\n\nNote 1. In certain circumstances an illustration with analysis is accepted\n\nas equivalent to a description (see Arts. 41 and 43).\n\nNote 2. Bibliographic errors of citation do not invalidate the publication\n\nof a new combination.\n\nNote 3. For names of plant taxa originally published as names of animals,\n\nsee Art. 45.\n\nRecommendation 32A\n\nValid publication of a name should not be effected solely by a reference to a\n\ndescription or illustration published before 1753.\n\nArticle 33\n\nA name is not validly published (1) when it is not accepted by the author\n\nwho published it; (2) when it is merely proposed in anticipation of the future\n\nacceptance of the group concerned, or of a particular circumscription, position,\n\nor rank of the group (so~called provisional name); (3) when it is merely\n\nmentioned incidentally.\n\nNote 1. Provision no. 1 does not apply to names or epithets published\n\nwith a question mark or other indication of taxonomic doubt, yet published\n\nand accepted by the author.\n\nNote 2. By incidental mention of a new name or combination is meant\n\nmention by an author who does not intend to introduce the new name or\n\ncombination concerned.\n\nExample: The generic name Conophyton Haw., suggested by Haworth (Rev. Pl.\n\nSucc. 82. 1821) for Mesembryanthemum sect. Minima Haw. (l.c. 81. 1821) in the words\n\nIf this section proves to be a genus, the name of Conophyton would be apt, was not\n\nvalidly published, since Haworth did not adopt that generic name nor accept that genus.\n\nThe correct name for the genus is Conophytum N. E. Brown (Gard. Chron. III. 71:\n\n198. 1922).\n\nWhen, on or after 1 Jan. 1953, two or more different names (so~called\n\nalternative names) are proposed simultaneously for the same taxon by the\n\nsame author, none of them is validly published.\n\nExample: The species of Brosimum described by Ducke (Arch. Jard. Bot. Rio 3:\n\n23~29. 1922) were published with alternative names under Piratinera added in a footnote\n\n(pp. 23~24). The publication of these names, being effected before 1 Jan. 1953, is valid.\n\nArticle 34\n\nIn order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon of recent plants,\n\nthe bacteria and algae excepted, published on or after 1 Jan. 1935 must be\n\naccompanied by a Latin diagnosis or by a reference to a previously and\n\neffectively published Latin diagnosis.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 19 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nValid publication 35~38\n\nExample: The names Schiedea gregoriana Degener, Fl.

Papers 11 (23):\n\n3. 1936 (Apr. 10) were proposed for the same plant; the type of the former is a part\n\nof the original material of the latter. Since the name S. gregoriana is not accompanied by\n\na Latin diagnosis, the later S. kealiae is the legitimate name.\n\nIn order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon of algae published\n\non or after 1 Jan. 1958 must be accompanied by a Latin diagnosis or by a\n\nreference to a previously and effectively published Latin diagnosis.\n\nArticle 35\n\nPublication on or after 1 Jan. 1958 of the name of a new taxon of recent\n\nplants of the rank of order or below is valid only when the nomenclatural\n\ntype is indicated (see Arts. 7~10).\n\nRecommendation 35A\n\nWhen the nomenclatural type of a new taxon is a specimen, the place where it is\n\npermanently conserved should be indicated.\n\nArticle 36\n\nIn order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon of fossil plants\n\npublished on or from 1 Jan. 1912 must be accompanied by an illustration or\n\nfigure showing the essential characters, in addition to the description, or by\n\na reference to a previously and effectively published illustration or figure.\n\nIn order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon of algae of\n\nspecific or lower rank published on or after 1 Jan. 1958 must be accompanied\n\nby an illustration or figure showing the distinctive morphological features,\n\nin addition to the Latin diagnosis, or by a reference to a previously and\n\neffectively published illustration or figure.\n\nArticle 37\n\nA name of a taxon is not validly published when it is merely cited as\n\na synonym.\n\nExamples: Acosmus Desv. (in Desf. Cat. Pl. Hort. Paris ed. 3. 233. 1829), cited as\n\na synonym of the generic name Aspicarpa L.C. Rich., was not validly published thereby. ~\n\nOrnithogalum undulatum Hort. Bouch. ex Kunth (Enum. Pl. 4: 348. 1843), cited as a\n\nsynonym under Myogalum boucheanum Kunth, was not validly published thereby; when\n\ntransferred to Ornithogalum, this species must be called Ornithogalum boucheanum (Kunth)\n\nAschers. (Oest. Bot. Zeitschr. 16: 192. 1866).\n\nSimilarly Erythrina micropteryx Poepp. was not validly published by being cited\n\nas a synonym of Micropteryx poeppigiana Walp. (Linnaea 23: 740. 1850); the species\n\nconcerned, when placed under Erythrina, must be called Erythrina poeppigiana (Walp.) O.\n\nF. Cook (U.S. Dep. Agr. Bull. 25: 57. 1901).\n\nArticle 38\n\nThe name of a taxon is not validly published by the mere mention of\n\nthe subordinate taxa included in it.\n\nExamples: The family name Rhaptopetalaceae Pierre (Bull. Soc Linn. Paris 2: 1296.\n\nMay 1897), which was accompanied merely by mention of constituent genera. Brazzeia,\n\nScytopetalum, and Rhaptopetalum, was not validly published, as Pierre gave no description;\n\nthe family bears the later name Scytopetalaceae Engler (in Engler & Prantl. Nat.

Atlas\n\n3: pl. 265. 1894) was validly published, as it appeared on a plate with analyses of P.\n\nhibbertioides Baill. published before 1 Jan. 1908. ~ Strophioblachia fimbricalyx Boerl. (Handl.\n\nFl. Ned. Ind. 3(1): 235. 1900) is a new species assigned to the monotypic new genus\n\nStrophioblachia published with a combined generic and specific description.\n\nNote 1. A description of a new species assigned to a monotypic new\n\ngenus is treated also as a generic description if the genus is not described.\n\nSimilarly, a description of a monotypic new genus based on a new\n\nspecies is treated also as a specific description if the generic name and\n\nspecific epithet are published together and the species is not described.\n\nNote 2.

Austr. 4: 15, 14) as substitutes for Poa eragrostis L. and Briza\n\neragrostis L. respectively; these two names were cited as synonyms. As, however, the generic\n\nname Eragrostis was not validly published until 1812 (P. Beauv. Agrost. 70), the names\n\ngiven by Host cannot be considered validly published.\n\nIn 1880, Müller Argoviensis (Flora 63: 286) published the new genus Phlyctidia with\n\nthe species Ph. hampeana n. sp., Ph. boliviensis (= Phlyctis boliviensis Nyl.), Ph. soredii-\n\nformis (= Phlyctis sorediiformis Krempelh.), Ph. brasiliensis (= Phlyctis brasiliensis Nyl.).\n\nand Ph. andensis (= Phlyctis andensis Nyl.). These specific names are, however, not\n\nvalidly published in this place, because the generic name Phlyctidia was not validly published;\n\nMüller gave no generic diagnosis but only a description of the new species Ph. hampeana.\n\nThis description cannot validate the generic name as a descriptio generico-specifica in\n\naccordance with Art. 41, since the new genus was not monotypic. The first valid publication\n\nof the name Phlyctidia was made by Müller in 1895 (Hedwigia 34: 141), where a short\n\ngeneric diagnosis was given. The only species mentioned here were Ph. ludoviciensis n. sp.\n\nand Ph. boliviensis (Nyl.).

CITATION OF AUTHORS NAMES AND OF LITERATURE\n\nFOR PURPOSES OF PRECISION\n\nArticle 46\n\nFor the indication of the name of a taxon to be accurate and complete,\n\nand in order that the date may be readily verified, it is necessary to cite\n\nthe name of the author who first published the name concerned unless the\n\nprovisions of Arts. 22 or 26 apply.\n\nExamples: Rosaceae Juss., Rosa L., Rosa gallica L., Rosa gallica var. eriostyla R.\n\nKeller, Rosa gallica L. var. gallica.\n\nRecommendation 46A\n\nWhen a name has been proposed but not validly published by one author and is\n\nsubsequently validly published and ascribed to him by another author, the name of the\n\nformer author followed by the connecting word ex may be inserted before the name of\n\nthe publishing author. The same holds for names of garden origin cited as Hort. If it\n\nis desirable or necessary to abbreviate such a citation, the name of the publishing author,\n\nbeing the more important, should be retained.\n\nExamples: Havetia flexilis Spruce ex Planch. & Triana or Havetia flexilis Planch. &\n\nTriana. ~ Gossypium tomentosum Nutt. ex Seem. or Gossypium tomentosum Seem. ~\n\nLithocarpus polystachya (Wall. ex A.DC.) Rehder or L. polystachya (A.DC.) Rehder. ~\n\nGesneria donklarii Hort. ex Hook. or Gesneria donklarii Hook.\n\nRecommendation 46B\n\nWhen a name with a description (or reference to a description) supplied by one\n\nauthor is published in a work by another author, the word in should be used to connect\n\nthe names of the two authors.\n\nExamples: Viburnum ternatum Rehder in Sargent, Trees and Shrubs 2: 37 (1907);\n\nTeucrium charidemi Sandwith in Lacaita, Cavanillesia 3: 38 (1930).\n\nArticle 47\n\nAn alteration of the diagnostic characters or of the circumscription of\n\na taxon without the exclusion of the type does not warrant the citation of\n\nthe name of an author other than the one who first published its name.\n\nExamples: see under Art. 51.\n\nRecommendation 47A\n\nWhen the alteration mentioned in Art. 47 has been considerable, the nature of the\n\nchange and the author responsible should be indicated by adding such words, abbreviated\n\nwhere suitable, as emendavit (emend.), mutatis characteribus (mut. char.), pro parte (p.p.),\n\nexcluso genere or exclusis generibus (excl. gen.), exclusa specie or exclusis speciebus\n\n(excl. sp.), exclusa varietate or exclusis varietatibus (excl. var.), etc.\n\nExamples: Phyllanthus L. emend. Müll. Arg.; Myosotis L. pro parte, R. Br.; Globularia\n\ncordifolia L. excl. var. (emend. Lam.).\n\nArticle 48\n\nRetention of a name in a sense that excludes the type can be effected\n\nonly by conservation. When a name is conserved so as to exclude its type,\n\nit must not be ascribed to the original author with such expressions as\n\nemendavit, mutatis characteribus, etc.; instead, the name of the author whose\n\ncircumscription is conserved must be cited.\n\nExample: Protea R. Br.; Protea R. Br., nom. cons. (non Protea L. 1753). This must\n\nnot be cited as Protea L. emend. R. Br., since Browns circumscription excluded the\n\nLinnaean type.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 24 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nCitation author 49~50\n\nArticle 49\n\nWhen a genus or a taxon of lower rank is altered in rank but retains\n\nits name or epithet, the author who first published this as a legitimate name\n\nor epithet must be cited in parentheses, followed by the name of the author who\n\neffected the alteration.\n\nExamples: Medicago polymorpha L. var. orbicularis L. when raised to the rank of\n\nspecies becomes Medicago orbicularis (L.) All. ~ Anthyllis sect. Aspalathoides DC. raised\n\nto generic rank, retaining the name Aspalathoides, is cited as Aspalathoides (DC.) K. Koch.\n\nThe species of Corydalis based on Fumaria bulbosa γ solida L. (1753) must be cited as\n\nCorydalis solida (L.) Sw. (1819) and not as Corydalis solida (Mill.) Sw. The latter\n\ncitation refers to Fumaria solida (L.) Mill. from 1771, also based on Fumaria bulbosa γ solida\n\nL.: the former, correct citation refers to the first author of the legitimate epithet.\n\nThe same holds when a taxon of lower rank than genus is transferred\n\nto another taxon, with or without alteration of rank.\n\nExamples: Sorbus sect. Aria Pers. on transference to Pyrus is cited as Pyrus sect.\n\nAria (Pers.) DC. ~ Cheiranthus tristis L. transferred to the genus Matthiola becomes\n\nMatthiola tristis (L.) R.Br.\n\nArticle 50\n\nWhen the status of a taxon bearing a binary name is altered from\n\nspecies to hybrid or vice versa, the name of the original author must be cited,\n\nfollowed by an indication in parentheses of the original status. If it is desirable\n\nor necessary to abbreviate such a citation, the indication of the original status\n\nmay be omitted.\n\nExamples: Stachys ambigua J. E. Smith. (Engl. Bot. 30: pl. 2089. 1810) was published\n\nas a species. If regarded as a hybrid, it must be cited as Stachys ×ambigua J. E. Smith\n\n(pro sp.). ~ The binary name Salix ×glaucops Anderss. (in DC. Prodr. 16(2): 281. 1868)\n\nwas published as the name of a hybrid. Later, Rydberg (Bull. New York Bot. Gard. 1: 270.\n\n1899) altered the status of the group to that of a species. If this view is accepted, the\n\nname must be cited as Salix glaucops Anderss. (pro hybr.).\n\nRecommendation 50A\n\nAuthors names put after names of plants should be abbreviated, unless they are\n\nvery short. For this purpose, particles are suppressed unless they are an inseparable part\n\nof the name, and the first letters are given without any omission (Lam. for J. B. P. A.\n\nMonet chevalier de Lamarck, but De Wild. for E. De Wildeman).\n\nIf a name of one syllable is long enough to make it worth while to abridge it, the\n\nfirst consonants only are given (Fr. for Elias Magnus Fries); if the name has two or more\n\nsyllables, the first syllable and the first letter of the following one are taken, or the two\n\nfirst when both are consonants (Juss. for Jussieu, Rich. for Richard).\n\nWhen it is necessary to give more of a name to avoid confusion between names\n\nbeginning with the same syllable, the same system is to be followed. For instance, two\n\nsyllables are given together with the one or two first consonants of the third; or one\n\nof the last characteristic consonants of the name is added (Bertol. for Bertoloni, to distinguish\n\nit from Bertero; Michx. for Michaux, to distinguish it from Micheli).\n\nChristian names or accessory designations serving to distinguish two botanists of the\n\nsame name are abridged in the same way (Adr. Juss. for Adrien de Jussieu, Gaertn. f. for\n\nGaertner filius, R. Br. for Robert Brown, A. Br. for Alexander Braun).\n\nWhen it is a well~established custom to abridge a name in another manner, it is\n\nbest to conform to it (L. for Linnaeus, DC. for De Candolle. St.~Hil. for Saint~Hilaire,\n\nF. v. Muell. for Ferdinand von Mueller).\n\nRecommendation 50B\n\nIn the citation of a name published as a synonym, the words as synonym or\n\npro syn. should be added.\n\nWhen an author has published as a synonym a manuscript name of another author,\n\nthe word ex should be used in citations to connect the names of the two authors.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 25 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n50 Citation author\n\nExample: Myrtus serratus a manuscript name of Koenigs published by Steudel as\n\na synonym of Eugenia laurina Willd. should be cited thus: Myrtus serratus Koenig ex\n\nSteudel, Nomencl. 321 (1821) pro syn.\n\nRecommendation 50C\n\nIn the citation of a nomen nudum, its status should be indicated by adding nomen\n\nnudum (nom. nud.).\n\nRecommendation 50D\n\nThe citation of an author who published the name before the starting point of the\n\ngroup concerned is indicated, when considered useful or desirable, preferably between\n\nsquare brackets or by the use of the word ex. This method is especially applicable in\n\nmycology when reference is made to authors earlier than Fries or Persoon.\n\nExamples: Lupinus [Tourn. Inst. 392. pl. 213. 1719] L. Sp. Pl. 721. 1753; Gen.

In some instances it will be\n\nadvisable to cite also any later homonym.\n\nExamples: Ulmus racemosa Thomas, Am. Jour. Sci. 19: 170 (1831) non Borkh.\n\n1800. ~ Lindera Thunb. Nov. Gen. 3: 64 (1783) non Adans. 1763. ~ Bartlingia Brongn.\n\nAnn. Sci. Nat. I. 10: 373 (1827) non Reichb. 1824. nec F. v. Muell. 1877.\n\nRecommendation 50F\n\nMisidentifications should not be included in the synonymy but added after it. A\n\nmis­applied name should be indicated by the words auct. non followed by the name of the\n\noriginal author and the bibliographical reference of the misidentification.\n\nExamples: FICUS STORTOPHYLLA Warb. in Warb. & De Wild.

RETENTION, CHOICE, AND REJECTION OF NAMES\n\nSection 1. RETENTION OF NAMES OR EPITHETS OF TAXA\n\nWHICH ARE REMODELLED OR DIVIDED\n\nArticle 51\n\nAn alteration of the diagnostic characters or of the circumscription of\n\na taxon does not warrant a change in its name, except as may be required\n\n(1) by transference of the taxon (Arts. 54~56), or (2) by its union with\n\nanother taxon of the same rank (Arts. 57~58A), or (3) by a change of its\n\nrank (Art. 60).\n\nExamples: The genus Myosotis as revised by R. Brown differs from the original genus\n\nof Linnaeus, but the generic name has not been changed, nor is a change allowable, since\n\nthe type of Myosotis L. remains in the genus; it must be cited as Myosotis L. or as Myosotis\n\nL. emend. R. Br. (see Art. 47, Rec. 47A). ~ Various authors have united with Centaurea\n\njacea L. one or two species which Linnaeus had kept distinct; the taxon so constituted\n\nmust be called Centaurea jacea L. sensu amplo or Centaurea jacea L. emend. Cosson &\n\nGermain. emend. Visiani, or emend. Godr., etc.: the creation of a new name such as\n\nCentaurea vulgaris Godr. is superfluous and illegitimate.\n\nArticle 52\n\nWhen a genus is divided into two or more genera, the generic name\n\nmust be retained for one of them, or (if it has not been retained) must be\n\nreinstated. When a particular species was originally designated as the type,\n\nthe generic name must be retained for the genus including that species. When\n\nno type was designated, a type must be chosen (see Appendix IV).\n\nExamples: The genus Glycine L. (Sp. Pl. 753. 1753) was divided by Adanson (Fam.\n\n2: 324, 327, 562. 1763) into the two genera Bradlea and Abrus; this procedure is inadmissible:\n\nthe name Glycine must be kept for one of the genera, and it is now retained for part\n\nof Glycine L. (1753). ~ The genus Aesculus L. contains the sections Aesculus, Pavia\n\n(Poir.) Pax, Macrothyrsus (Spach) Pax, and Calothyrsus (Spach) Pax, the last three\n\nof which were regarded as distinct genera by the authors cited in parentheses; in the\n\nevent of these four sections being treated as genera, the name Aesculus must be kept\n\nfor the first of them, which includes the species Aesculus hippocastanum L., as this\n\nspecies is the type of the genus founded by Linnaeus (Sp. Pl. 344. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed.\n\n5. 1754); Tourneforts name Hippocastanum must not be used for a genus including\n\nAesculus hippocastanum L., as was done by Gaertner (Fruct. 2: 135. 1791).\n\nArticle 53\n\nWhen a species is divided into two or more species, the specific epithet\n\nmust be retained for one of them, or (if it has not been retained) must be\n\nreinstated. When a particular specimen was originally designated as the type,\n\nthe specific epithet must be retained for the species including that specimen.\n\nWhen no type was designated, a type must be chosen (see Appendix IV).\n\nExamples: Lychnis dioica L. (Sp. Pl. 437. 1753) was divided by Miller (Gard.\n\nDict. ed. 8. nos. 3,4. 1768) into two species, L. dioica L. emend. Mill. and L. alba Mill. ~\n\nG. F. Hoffmann (Deutschl. Fl. 1: 166. 1800) divided Juncus articulatus L.

Corse 1: 264.\n\n1910). ~ Genista horrida (Vahl) DC. (Fl. Franç. 4: 500. 1805) was divided by\n\nSpach (Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. III. 2: 252. 1844) into three species, G. horrida (Vahl)\n\nDC., G. boissieri Spach, and G. webbii Spach; the name G. horrida was rightly kept\n\nfor the species including the plant from Jaca in Aragon originally described by Vahl\n\n(Symb. 1: 51. 1790) as Spartium horridum. ~ Two species (Primula cashmiriana Munro,\n\nP. erosa Wall.) have been separated from Primula denticulata J. E. Smith (Exot. Bot.\n\n2: 109. pl. 114. 1806), but the name P. denticulata has rightly been kept for the form\n\nwhich Smith described and figured under this name.\n\nThe same rule applies to infraspecific taxa, for example, to a subspecies\n\ndivided into two or more subspecies, or to a variety divided into two or more\n\nvarieties.\n\nSection 2. RETENTION OF EPITHETS OF TAXA BELOW THE RANK OF GENUS\n\nON TRANSFERENCE TO ANOTHER GENUS OR SPECIES\n\nArticle 54\n\nWhen a subdivision of a genus * is transferred to another genus (or\n\nplaced under another generic name for the same genus) without change of\n\nrank, its epithet must be retained, or (if it has not been retained) must be\n\nreinstated, unless one of the following obstacles exists:\n\n(1) that the resulting combination has been previously and validly published\n\nfor a subdivision of a genus based on a different type;\n\n(2) that there is available an earlier and legitimate epithet of the same rank;\n\n(3) that Art. 22 provides that another epithet be used.\n\nExample: Saponaria sect. Vaccaria DC. when transferred to Gypsophila becomes\n\nGypsophila sect. Vaccaria (DC.) Godr.\n\nArticle 55\n\nWhen a species is transferred to another genus (or placed under another\n\ngeneric name for the same genus) without change of rank, the specific epithet,\n\nif legitimate, must be retained a), or (if it has not been retained) must be\n\nreinstated b), unless one of the following obstacles exists:\n\n(1) that the resulting binary name is a later homonym c) (Art. 64(2))\n\nor a tautonym d) (Art. 70(4));\n\n(2) that there is available an earlier legitimate specific epithet e).\n\nExamples: a) Antirrhinum spurium L. (Sp. Pl. 613. 1753) when transferred to the\n\ngenus Linaria must be called Linaria spuria (L.) Mill. (Gard. Dict. ed. 8. no. 15. 1768). ~\n\nb) Spergula stricta Sw. (1799) when transferred to the genus Arenaria must be called\n\nArenaria uliginosa Schleich. ex Schlechtend, (1808) because of the existence of Arenaria\n\nstricta Michx. (1803), a different species; but on further transfer to the genus Minuartia\n\nthe epithet stricta must be reinstated and the species called Minuartia stricta (Sw.) Hiern\n\n(1899). ~ c) Spartium biflorum Desf. (1798) when transferred to the genus Cytisus\n\nby Spach in 1849 could not be called Cytisus biflorus, because this name had been\n\npreviously and validly published for a different species by lHéritier in 1791; the name\n\nCytisus fontanesii given by Spach is therefore legitimate. ~ d) Pyrus malus L. (1753)\n\nwhen transferred to the genus Malus must be called Malus sylvestris Mill. (1768), the\n\ncombination Malus malus Britton (1913) being illegitimate. ~ e) Statice karelinii\n\nStschegl (Bull. Soc. Nat. Moscou 24 (4): 475. 1851) when transferred to the genus\n\n————————\n\nHere and elsewhere in this Code the phrase subdivision of a genus refers\n\nonly to taxa between genus and species in rank.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 28 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nUnion of taxa 56~57\n\nAcantholimon must be called Acantholimon karelinii (Stschegl) Bunge (Mém.

Moscou 12: 184. 1860).\n\nWhen, on transference to another genus, the specific epithet has been\n\napplied erroneously in its new position to a different species, the new com~\n\nbination must be retained for the species to which the epithet was originally\n\napplied, and must be attributed to the author who first published it f).\n\nExample: f) Pinus mertensiana Bong. was transferred to the genus Tsuga by\n\nCarrière, who, however, as is evident from his description, erroneously applied the new\n\ncombination Tsuga mertensiana to another species of Tsuga, namely T. heterophylla\n\n(Raf.) Sargent: the combination Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carr. must be retained for\n\nPinus mertensiana Bong. when that species is placed in Tsuga; the citation in parentheses\n\n(under Art. 49) of the name of the original author, Bongard, indicates the type of\n\nthe epithet.\n\nArticle 56\n\nWhen an infraspecific taxon is transferred without change of rank to\n\nanother genus or species, the original epithet must be retained, or (if it has not\n\nbeen retained) must be reinstated, unless one of the following obstacles\n\nexists:\n\n(1) that the resulting ternary combination has been previously and validly\n\npublished for an infraspecific taxon based on a different type, even if that\n\ntaxon is of different rank;\n\n(2) that there is available an earlier legitimate epithet;\n\n(3) that Art. 26 provides that another epithet be used.\n\nExample: The variety micranthum Gren. & Godr. (Fl. France 1: 171. 1847) of\n\nHelianthemum italicum Pers. when transferred as a variety to H. penicillatum Thib.\n\nretains its varietal epithet, becoming H. penicillatum var. micranthum (Gren. & Godr.)\n\nGrosser (Pflanzenreich 14: 115. 1903).\n\nWhen, on transference to another genus or species, the epithet of an\n\ninfraspecific taxon has been applied erroneously in its new position to a\n\ndifferent taxon of the same rank, the new combination must be retained for\n\nthe taxon to which the original combination was applied, and must be\n\nattributed to the author who first published it.\n\nSection 3. CHOICE OF NAMES WHEN TAXA OF THE SAME RANK ARE\n\nUNITED\n\nArticle 57\n\nWhen two or more taxa of the same rank are united, the oldest legitimate\n\nname or (for taxa below the rank of genus) the oldest legitimate epithet is\n\nretained, unless a later name or epithet must be accepted under the provisions\n\nof Art. 58. The author who first unites taxa bearing names or epithets of the\n\nsame date has the right to choose one of them, and his choice must be followed.\n\nExamples: K. Schumann (in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam. 3(6): 5. 1890),\n\nuniting the three genera Sloanea L. (1753), Echinocarpus Blume (1825), and Phoenicosperma\n\nMiq. (1865), rightly adopted the oldest of these three generic names, Sloanea L., for\n\nthe resulting genus. ~ If the two genera Dentaria L. (Sp. Pl. 653. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed.\n\n5. 295. 1754) and Cardamine L. (Sp. Pl. 654. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed. 5. 295. 1754) are\n\nunited, the resulting genus must be called Cardamine because the name was chosen by\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 29 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n58~59 Pleomorphic fungi\n\nCrantz (Class. Crucif. 126. 1769) who was the first to unite the two genera. ~ When\n\nH. Hallier (Bot. Jahrb. 18: 123. 1893) united three species of Ipomoea, namely I. verticillata\n\nL. (1759), I. rumicifolia Choisy (1834), and I. perrottetii Choisy (1845), he rightly\n\nretained the name I. verticillata L. for the resulting species because verticillata is the\n\noldest of the three specific epithets. ~ Robert Brown (in Tuckey, Narr. Exp. Congo\n\nApp. 5: 484. 1818) appears to have been the first to unite Waltheria americana L. (Sp.\n\nPl. 673. 1753) and W. indica L. (Sp. Pl. 673. 1753). He adopted the name Waltheria\n\nindica for the combined species, and this name must accordingly be retained.\n\nArticle 58\n\nWhen a taxon of recent plants, algae excepted, and a taxon of the\n\nsame rank of fossil or subfossil plants are united, the correct name or epithet\n\nof the former taxon must be accepted, even if it is antedated by that of the\n\nlatter.\n\nExample: If Sequoia Endl. (1847), a genus of recent plants, and Steinhauera Presl\n\n(1838), a genus of fossil plants, are united, the name Sequoia must be accepted for the\n\ncombined genus, although it is antedated by Steinhauera.\n\nRecommendation 58A\n\nAuthors who have to choose between two generic names should note the following\n\nsuggestions:\n\n(1) Of two names of the same date, to prefer that which was first accompanied\n\nby the description of a species.\n\n(2) Of two names of the same date, both accompanied by descriptions of species,\n\nto prefer that which, when the author makes his choice, includes the larger number\n\nof species.\n\n(3) In cases of equality from these various points of view to select the more\n\nappropriate name.\n\nSection 4. CHOICE OF NAMES OF FUNGI WITH A PLEOMORPHIC LIFE CYCLE\n\nArticle 59\n\nIn Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes with two or more states in the life\n\ncycle (except those which are lichen-fungi), but not in Phycomycetes, the first\n\nlegitimate name or epithet applied to the perfect state takes precedence. The\n\nperfect state is that which bears asci in the Ascomycetes, which consists of\n\nthe spores giving rise to basidia in the Uredinales and of the chlamydospores\n\nin the Ustilaginales, or which bears basidia in the remaining Basidiomycetes.\n\nThe type specimen of a name applied to a particular state must show the\n\ncharacteristics of that stage. However, the provisions of this Article shall not\n\nbe construed as preventing the use of names of imperfect states in works\n\nreferring to such states. The author who first describes a perfect state may\n\nadopt the specific epithet applied to the corresponding imperfect state, but\n\nhis binomial for the perfect state is to be attributed to him alone, and is not\n\nto be regarded as a transfer.\n\nWhen not already available, binomials for imperfect states may be\n\nproposed at the time of publication of a perfect state or later, and may contain\n\neither the specific epithet applied to the perfect state or any other epithet\n\navailable.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 30 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nChange of rank 60~63\n\nSection 5. CHOICE OF NAMES WHEN THE RANK OF A TAXON IS CHANGED\n\nArticle 60\n\nWhen the rank of a genus or infrageneric * taxon is changed, the correct\n\nname or epithet is the earliest legitimate one available in the new rank. In\n\nno case does a name or an epithet have priority outside its own rank.\n\nExamples: The section Campanopsis R. Br. (Prodr. 561. 1810) of the genus Campanula\n\nwas first raised to generic rank by Schrader and, as a genus, must be called Wahlenbergia\n\nSchrad. (Cat. Hort. Goett. 1814), not Campanopsis (R. Br.) O. Kuntze (Rev. 2: 378.\n\n1891). ~ Magnolia virginiana var. foetida L. (Sp. Pl. 536. 1753) when raised to specific\n\nrank must be called Magnolia grandiflora L. (Syst. Nat. ed. 10. 1082. 1759), not Magnolia\n\nfoetida (L.) Sarg. (Gard. & For. 2: 615. 1889). ~ Lythrum intermedium Ledeb. (Ind.\n\nHort. Dorpat 1822) when treated as a variety of Lythrum salicaria L. (1753) must be\n\ncalled L. salicaria var. glabrum Ledeb. (Fl. Ross. 2: 127. 1843), not L. salicaria var.\n\nintermedium (Ledeb.) Koehne (Bot. Jahrb. 1: 327. 1881). In all these cases, the name\n\nor epithet given to the taxon in its original rank is replaced by the first correct name\n\nor epithet given to it in its new rank.\n\nRecommendation 60A\n\n1. When a section or a subgenus becomes a genus, or the inverse change occurs,\n\nthe original name or epithet should be retained unless it is contrary to this Code.\n\n2. When an infraspecific taxon becomes a species, or the inverse change occurs,\n\nthe original epithet should be retained unless the resulting combination is contrary to\n\nthis Code.\n\n3. When an infraspecific taxon is changed in rank within the species, the original\n\nepithet should be retained unless the resulting combination is contrary to this Code.\n\nArticle 61\n\nWhen a taxon of a rank higher than a genus and not higher than an\n\norder is changed in rank, the stem of the name must be retained and only\n\nthe termination altered (~inae, ~eae, ~oideae, ~aceae, ~ineae, ~ales), unless\n\nthe resulting name is rejected under Chapter V, Section 6.\n\nSection 6. REJECTION OF NAMES AND EPITHETS\n\nArticle 62\n\nA legitimate name or epithet must not be rejected merely because it is\n\ninappropriate or disagreeable, or because another is preferable or better known,\n\nor because it has lost its original meaning.\n\nExamples: This rule was broken by the change of Staphylea to Staphylis, Tamus\n\nto Thamnos, Thamnus, or Tamnus, Mentha to Minthe, Tillaea to Tillia, Vincetoxicum\n\nto Alexitoxicum; and by the change of Orobanche rapum to O. sarothamnophyta, O.\n\ncolumbariae to O. columbarihaerens, O. artemisiae to O. artemisiepiphyta. All these\n\nmodifications must be rejected. ~ Ardisia quinquegona Blume (1825) must not be changed\n\nto A. pentagona A. DC. (1834), although the specific epithet quinquegona is a hybrid\n\nword (Latin and Greek) (see Rec. 23B.c).\n\nArticle 63\n\nA name must be rejected:\n\n(1) If it is illegitimate (see Arts. 64, 68, 69, 70, 71; however, see also Art. 72).\n\n————————\n\nHere and elsewhere in the Code the term infrageneric refers to all ranks below\n\nthat of genus.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1956 — Paris Code\n\n– 31 –\n\ntext: © 1956, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n64 Rejection\n\n(2) If it is a source of error (see Art. 65).\n\n(3) If it is based on a type consisting of discordant elements (see Art. 66).\n\n(4) If it is based on a monstrosity (see Art. 67).\n\nArticle 64\n\nA name is illegitimate in the following cases:\n\n(1) If it was nomenclaturally superfluous when published, i.e. if the taxon\n\nto which it was applied, as circumscribed by its author, included the type\n\nof a name or epithet which ought to have been adopted under the rules.\n\nExamples: The generic name Cainito Adans. (Fam. 2: 166. 1763) is illegitimate\n\nbecause it was a superfluous name for Chrysophyllum L. (Sp. Pl. 192. 1753); the two\n\ngenera had precisely the same circumscription. ~ The genus Unisema Raf. (Med. Repos.\n\n5: 192. 1819) was so circumscribed as to include Pontederia cordata L., the type of\n\nPontederia L. (1753). Under Art. 51 the name Pontederia L. must be adopted for the\n\ngenus concerned. Unisema is therefore nomenclaturally superfluous. ~ Chrysophyllum\n\nsericeum Salisb. (Prodr. 138. 1796) is illegitimate, being a superfluous name for C. cainito\n\nL. (1753), which Salisbury cited as a synonym. ~ On the other hand, Cucubalus\n\nlatifolius Mill. and C. angustifolius Mill. (Gard. Dict. ed. 8. nos. 2, 3. 1768) are not\n\nillegitimate names, although these species are now reunited with C. behen L. (1753),\n\nfrom which Miller separated them: C. latifolius Mill. and C. angustifolius Mill. as\n\ncircumscribed by Miller did not include the type of C. behen L.\n\n(2) If it is a later homonym, that is if it duplicates a name previously\n\nand validly published for a taxon of the same rank based on a different type.\n\nEven if the earlier homonym is illegitimate, or is generally treated as a\n\nsynonym on taxonomic grounds, the later homonym must be rejected.\n\nNote: Mere orthographic variants of the same name are treated as\n\nhomonyms when they are based on different types (see Art. 75).\n\nExamples: The generic name Tapeinanthus Boiss. ex Benth. (1848), given to a\n\ngenus of Labiatae, is a later homonym of Tapeinanthus Herb. (1837), a name previously\n\nand validly published for a genus of Amaryllidaceae; Tapeinanthus Boiss. ex Benth.\n\nmust therefore be rejected, as was done by Th. Durand (Ind. Gen. Phan. x. 1888),\n\nwho renamed it Thuspeinanta. ~ The generic name Amblyanthera Müll. Arg. (1860)\n\nis a later homonym of the validly published generic name Amblyanthera Blume (1849)\n\nand must therefore be rejected, although Amblyanthera Blume is now reduced to Osbeckia\n\nL. (1753). ~ Astragalus rhizanthus Boiss. (Diagn. Pl. Orient. 2: 83. 1843) is a later\n\nhomonym of the validly published name Astragalus rhizanthus Royle (Ill. Bot. Himal.\n\n200. 1835) and it must therefore be rejected. as was done by Boissier, who renamed\n\nit A. cariensis (Diagn. Pl. Orient. 9: 56. 1849).\n\nWhen the same new name is simultaneously published for more than one\n\ntaxon, the first author who adopts it in one sense, rejecting the other, or\n\nprovides another name for one of these taxa must be followed.\n\nExample: Linnaeus (Sp. Pl. 1753) published Aira 1 spicata on p. 63 and Aira\n\n7 spicata on p. 64, but in Errata line 9 from base (vol. 2, after Nomina trivialia\n\nand Addenda) substituted indica for spicata of species 1 on p. 63; the name Aira spicata\n\nL. is therefore legitimate for species 7 on p. 64.\n\n(3) If it is the name of a taxon which on transfer of that taxon from\n\nthe animal to the plant kingdom becomes, at the time of such transfer, a\n\nhomonym of a name for a plant taxon.\n\nIf a taxon is transferred from the plant kingdom to the animal kingdom, its\n\nname or names retain their status in botanical nomenclature for pu"
