        "text": "Kuhn History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nIsrael\n\nSimilar to many Austrian family names, the distinguished surname Kuhn is a proud sign of a rich and ancient ancestry. The earliest forms of hereditary surnames in Austria were the patronymic surnames, which are derived from the father's given name, and metronymic surnames, which are derived from the mother's given name. The patronyms were derived from a variety of given names that were of many different origins. The name Kuhn is derived from the Old German name Conrad, which is composed of the elements \"kuoni,\" meaning \"daring\" or \"brave,\" and \"rad,\" meaning \"counsel.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Kuhn family\n\nThe surname Kuhn was first found in Austria, where the family gained a significant reputation for its contributions to the emerging mediaeval society. The name became prominent as many branches of the family founded separate houses and acquired estates in various regions, always elevating their social status by their great contributions to society.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Kuhn family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Kuhn research.
