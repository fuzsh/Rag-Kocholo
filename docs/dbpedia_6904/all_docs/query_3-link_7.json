        "text": "The Kuhn name is not of Jewish origin. When the Ashkenazi Jews settled in Germany, some took German surnames to better assimilate into the population. The Hebrew name Cohen was thus changed by some of it's Jewish holders to similar-sounding German names, Kuhn being one of them. Unless it is specifically stated (or obvious) that the Kuhn in question is Jewish, then they aren't. I've traced them back to mid-16th century Germany and it's earliest professor (Casper Cuness) were Christians. Somehow the name evolved from Cuness, Cunnes, Cunes, Cuhnes, or a similar name. His children were the first to use Kuhn. From further research, I've found similar names in Dutch and Belgian families, so German Kuhn's may be descended from Dutch or Belgian migrants. There are also a great deal of Kuhn's originating in Scandanavian countries (primarily Denmark). Kuhn's were Christened in Lutheran, Reformed, and Catholic churches as far back as the 1630's (as far back as church records go), and there was no notable number of Jews converting to Christianity until the early 19th century. Thus, there is no possible way that Kuhn's are descendants of Jewish settlers."
