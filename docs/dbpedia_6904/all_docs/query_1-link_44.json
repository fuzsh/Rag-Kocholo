Were the words which fell from the lips of Shelbyville residents Sunday, and were accompanied with a sigh \"or a tear invariably.\" Mr. Kuhn had been a sufferer from stomach trouble several years, and had gone to the springs several times, only to find temporary relief from his suffering. Last Wednesday he was attacked with a severe spell and grew constantly worse until Sunday morning at nine o'clock, when death claimed the long and patient sufferer, although he had been unconscious the twenty-four hours previous. Deceased was born in Billigheim, Province of Bavaria, Germany, June 22, 1840, and was the son of Peter and Margaret Kuhn. His father died when he was four years of age, and when seven years of age with his mother, sailed for America, his mother dying with cholera en route, being buried at Natchez, Miss., leaving Adam in charge of the step-brothers, George and Peter Houk. The children drifted to Cincinnati, where they were met by Mr. Houk, Adam's step father, who had preceded them to this country. They remained in Ohio until 1862, when Adam came to Shelbyville and entered the tonsorial rooms of his relative, Michael Posz, who, with Henry Elder, he afterwards succeeded in business. He remained in the barber business until 1877, when he entered the retail liquor business with the late August DePrez. On the death of Mr. DePrez, deceased continued the business on East Washington street, until two years ago when he moved into the building erected by himself on Noble street, in the rear of his residence property and just south of Washington street. In early childhood he was stricken with white swelling, which had left him a cripple and caused him great suffering, but with all his pain he was always cheerful and strived to make his company agreeable to all who were thrown into it, and how well he succeeded hundreds will heartily testify. In 1863, one year after coming to Shelbyville, Mr. Kuhn was united in marriage to Sarah Rapp, daughter of John Rapp, of this city, and a more devoted couple never lived together as husband and wife. Mrs. Kuhn loved her husband as a mother loves her child, and his frequent reference to her, in general conversation, always proved his idolatry for his helpmate. Deceased never became a member of any religious denomination, but was a firm believer in the Supreme Being. Perhaps no man in Shelbyville gave to religious or charitable organizations with greater willingness that did Adam Kuhn. Several years ago a tall, ministerial looking gentleman, from one of the Southern townships of the county, entered Mr. Kuhn's place of business on east Washington street, with a book in his hand, the pages of which he was scanning on entering the door, evidently ignorant of the fact that be had entered a saloon. On removing his eyes from the book the fellow looked around as though greatly frightened, and started to retrace his steps. Mr. Kuhn was of an observant nature and at once knew what had caused the stranger's embarrassment. He was asked what he was doing with the book and replied; \"I am soliciting money with which to purchase a new bell for our church, but I guess I will not bother you.\" Laughingly, Mr. Kuhn asked the man for the book and taking a pencil, wrote his name in German and opposite it placed $5, which he handed to the astonished solicitor, who bowed himself out of the room with more money than he had collected all day. This is but one sample of the man's liberal heartedness. He was a staunch Democrat but would never accept a nomination at the hands of his party, and while he was firm in his convictions, he always carefully avoided wounding the feelings of those who disagreed with his political views. He was especially fond of children and regarded it as an unpardonable error to pass a bright eyed boy or girl on the street without having something to say to them. Deceased was a warm, personal friend of the editor and publisher of this paper and every person connected to it. To know him well, was to have a friend and one who would remain closer than a brother. It is firmly believed that he had not an enemy in the world. He had a reputation for integrity not, excelled by any resident. He will be missed in Shelbyville; he will be missed in our county, and his lonely widow will only know his loss in that home so suddenly bereft and made desolate which, for so many years, has been his delight and was so full of all the conforts a loving heart and willing hands could furnish. Deceased was a charter member of Kiowas Tribe No. 199, I.O.R.M. and his was the first death to occur in the Order since its organization one year ago; he was also a member of Pocahontas Council of the same Order, and his burial was under the auspices of these Orders. The remains were buried Tuesday, March 17. Services at the house at two p.m., Dr. J.C. Caldwell, officiating. Interment in Forest Hill Cemetery. D.B. Wilson & Son had charge of the remains.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nThe Semi-Weekly Repubican\n\nTuesday, March 17, 1896\n\nPage 4, column 3\n\n------------\n\nAdam Kuhn, died at his residence No. 108, corner of Jackson and Noble streets, at 9:10 a.m. Sunday, March 15, 1896, aged 56 years.

He came to Shelbyville in 1856 direct from Germany and soon after his arrival, he went into the barber shop of Mr. Mike Posz, with whom he learned the barber's trade. This occupation he followed for a number of years when he went into the saloon business, in which he continued until his death. Mr. Kuhn possessed a kind heart, he was charitable and true to his family and friends. He was a jovial, whole souled man in his way and will be long remembered by those who knew and understood him best.\n\nSubmitted by Barb Huff for Jann Rapp DeMeire\n\nThe Shelby Democrat\n\nJune 13, 1895\n\nPage 3\n\n----------\n\nThe infant child of Mr. and Mrs. Robert J.
