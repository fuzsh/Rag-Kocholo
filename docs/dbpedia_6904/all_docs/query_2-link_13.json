Records in this series document the exhibition, including the selection of art work in Europe and the U.S., selection of venues, negotiation of contracts, production of the exhibitions, publicity, promotion, sales, and the wide array of responses to the exhibitions in New York, Chicago, and Boston.\n\nTypes of material found in this series include correspondence, clippings, notes, inventories, insurance policies, mailing lists, a record book, writings, entry cards, marked and unmarked catalogs, pamphlets, postcards, floor plans, photographs, scrapbooks and memorabilia related to the exhibition. Also included are a handful of records related to retrospective accounts and exhibitions produced in 1938 and 1963 for the 25th and 50th anniversaries of the exhibition, including Walt Kuhn's 1938 pamphlet, \"The Story of the Armory Show.\"\n\nRecords relating to the formation and administration of the AAPS are found in Series 2.\n\nThis series is arranged according the following 9 subseries:\n\n1.1: Correspondence, 1912-1914\n\n1.2: Domestic Art Committee Records, 1913\n\n1.3: European Entry Cards, circa 1912\n\n1.4: Notes, 1912-1913\n\n1.5: Printed Material and Memorabilia, 1912-1913\n\n1.6: Writings of Walt Kuhn, 1912-1913\n\n1.7: Photographs, 1912-1913\n\n1.8: Scrapbooks, 1912-1913\n\n1.9: Retrospective Materials, 1938-1963, undated\n\nThis series has been digitized in entirety with the exception of duplicates, copies, and the 2015 addition.\n\n1.1: Correspondence, 1912-1914\n\nThis series contains correspondence among Armory Show organizers, artists, dealers, collectors, vendors, publicists, and the public concerning the planning, production, and reception of the exhibition in New York, Chicago, and Boston.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, incoming and outgoing correspondence has been interfiled and arranged alphabetically by correspondent. Often only unsigned carbons of outgoing correspondence exists for a listed correspondent. When a correspondent has less than five items in a series, their letters have been placed in general alphabetical files, whose contents are listed under their file heading. Announcements written by AAPS members and sent to multiple recipients have been filed under the heading \"Association of American Painters and Sculptors,\" regardless of the signature.\n\n1.1.1: Organizers' Letters, 1912-1913\n\nOrganizers' Letters include letters written by Arthur B. Davies and Walt Kuhn. Recipients include Walter Pach, Walt Kuhn, and Vera Kuhn. Letters describe Kuhn's and Davies' travel to Europe to collect works to exhibit, preparations in New York, and the traveling exhibitions in Chicago and Boston. Several letters from Walt Kuhn are illustrated, and a floor plan of a proposed installation in the Armory is among Davies' letters. One postcard to Vera Kuhn from Boston is signed by Maurice and Charles Prendergast and Frederick James Gregg, as well as by Walt Kuhn.\n\nAdditional letters from Walt Kuhn to his wife before and after his Armory Show activities can be found in Series 4.2: Walt Kuhn Letters to Family.\n\nLetters are separated by author and arranged chronologically.\n\nDescription Container Arthur B.

Americans living in Europe at the time of the show are generally filed in the European correspondence.

Davies, Walter Pach, Frederick James Gregg, Elmer MacRae, and John Quinn, William M.R. French, Arthur T. Aldis, N.H. Carpenter, J.F. Coolidge, Holker Abbott, and Desmond Fitzgerald.\n\nCorrespondence among exhibit organizers regarding sales made during the traveling exhibition is also filed here. A contract between the AAPS and the Copley Society, referred to in a telegram of March 4, 1913, is filed with that telegram. Correspondence regarding a contract dispute between the AAPS and the Copley Society is also filed in this series.

Davies and annotated by both men; exhibition catalogs for the New York, Chicago, and Boston exhibitions; printed exhibition announcements and notices; postcards printed with reproductions of art works; pamphlets published by the organizers of the show; two items of memorabilia including an Armory Show button and a lapel pin; and newspaper clippings.\n\nSeveral of the catalogs contain annotations. Annotated New York catalogs are marked with prices and other notes; annotated Boston and Chicago catalogs are marked with shipping and packing information. Researchers should note for each of the catalogs, the annotated copies have been digitized. Digitization was not repeated for clean duplicates of catalogs.\n\nAn additional annotated catalog can be found in Notes (Series 1.4) under the heading \"Prices and Purchasers.\" Additional clippings can be found in Scrapbooks (Series 1.8).

Photographs include individual prints and one photo album. The photo album consists of platinum prints of works of art that were made into postcards, and an original photograph of the Duchamp-Villon brothers.\n\nA handful of loose platinum prints of art works and of the Duchamp-Villon brothers match the prints in the photo album in image, tone, and print quality, and have been treated as originals. Copy photographs of images whose originals are not in this collection are filed in Series 1.9: Retrospective Materials.

They include magazine and newspaper clippings; printed materials related to the exhibition; typescript documents of the AAPS related to statistics, public speeches, and circulars; and telegrams remarking on the exhibition. Subjects of the clippings include advance press of the show, diverse responses to the show, satirical cartoons, John Quinn's fight to eliminate the tariff on art, Guzton Borglum's public resignation from the AAPS, and the vice investigation of the show by Chicago authorities.\n\nBecause of the poor quality paper used in the scrapbooks, items in this series have required conservation treatment, which has slightly modified their composition. The Beefsteak dinner menu, which is from the celebratory dinner hosted by the AAPS on March 8, 1913 and is signed by the attendees, was originally included in these scrapbooks, but was later conserved as a separate item. The menu is included in this series with reference to its original page number in the scrapbook. The original binding of volume 2 of the scrapbooks was removed when the volume was conserved, and is housed separately. Another item that was separated from the scrapbooks, a clean copy of the New York edition of the exhibition catalog, is now housed with the other catalogs in Printed Materials and Memorabilia (Series 1.5). Microfilm copies of the scrapbooks as they appeared at the time of accession are available on reels D242-D243.\n\nIn general, scrapbook items are loosely chronological. Duplicates of many of the pamphlets, notices, posters, catalogs and postcards in the scrapbooks are found in Printed Material and Memorabilia (Series 1.5).\n\nAdditional scrapbooks, which are unrelated to the Armory Show, are found in Series 3 and 4.\n\nDescription Container\n\n1.9: Retrospective Materials, 1939-1963\n\nThis series consists of materials related to retrospective accounts of the Armory Show from the 25th and 50th anniversaries of the exhibition, in 1938 and 1963. Items from the 25th anniversary include an article by Frank Crowninshield in Vogue magazine, and Walt Kuhn's pamphlet, \"The Story of the Armory Show\" (1938), which was later reprinted in the Art News annual of 1939. Additional items in this series, including a typescript catalog, a series of photographs of the Armory building exterior dated 1962, and reproductions of clippings and artwork, seem to have been gathered for the 50th anniversary exhibition held in 1963. The reproductions in this series were not made from the Armory Show records in this collection. Additional documents related to the Kuhn pamphlet can be found in the Walt Kuhn Family Papers (Series 4).\n\nDescription Container Proof of Frank Crowninshield Article for Vogue, 1940\n\nOversized material housed in Box 27\n\n2\n\n41\n\nClippings, 1939, 1940, 1950, 1962-1963\n\noversized material housed in Box 27\n\n2\n\n42-45\n\nClippings, 1954, 1963\n\n56\n\n1\n\nExhibition Catalog, circa 1963\n\n2\n\n46\n\nPamphlet, \"The Story of the Armory Show,\", 1938\n\n2\n\n47\n\nPhotographs, 1962\n\n2\n\n48\n\nReproductions, circa 1963\n\noversized material housed in Box 27\n\n2\n\n49-50\n\nOversized Proof of Frank Crowninshield Article for Vogue\n\nOversized material scanned with Box 2, F41\n\n27\n\nOversized Clippings\n\nOversized material from Box 2, F42\n\n27\n\nOversized Reproductions\n\nOversized material from Box 2, F49\n\n27\n\nMake a Request\n\nTo request an appointment to view materials, make your selections using the checkboxes and click the \"Reading Room\" button.
