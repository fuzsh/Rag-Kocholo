He was the second oldest son of Adam Joseph Kuhn and Elisabeth Fleckenstein. Georg arrived in Baltimore in 1862. He married Kunigunde Eberlein Aug. 17, 1862. She arrived on the same ship, but we don't know whether they knew each other before the voyage.\n\nThey had 12 children; four of which outlived them. One son, John, drowned at the age of 18 and was buried in the \"St. Joseph\" section of St. Alphonsus in 1883. The family church was St. Michael's Catholic Church. Interment records are missing from 1871-1881. I have only created FindAGrave records for known burials but it is assumed that George Joseph Kuhn (March 1871 - September 1871) and George Karlatz Kuhn (June 1874 - August 1874) were also buried at St. Alphonsus.\n\nGeorge is listed as Watchman, Brewer, Saloon owner on census records. He was listed as a farmer on the ship manifest when he arrived. According to his grandchildren, George owned two houses and a saloon at the time of his death. The address of the saloon (we believe) was 428 Eastern Avenue. The Kuhns may have also lived at this address until they moved to 619 N. Clinton Street ~1884. Houses were re-numbered in 1897. The new number for 428 is 2230 (close to Patterson Park).\n\nGeorg was buried at St. Alphonsus cemetery November 22, 1897. He died of Dropsy. According to http://www.germanmarylanders.org/cemeteries/st-alphonsus they would have been buried at St. Alphonsus III-Loney's Lane and Biddle Street near Edison Highway...and their remains moved to Most Holy Redeemer but we do not have confirmation. Some of the children would have been buried at St. Alphonsus II (today, assumed to be at the intersection of Druid Hill Road and Madison Avenue, Baltimore).\n\nKuhn surname This famous German surname and original personal name of the pre 7th century, is recorded in over one hundred spellings throughout Europe and Scandanavia. These include the basic forms of Conrad (Medieval German and post medieval English and French), Konrad, Kohrt, Kordt, Kunrad, Kuhndert, Kuhnt, and Kurth found mainly in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, to Koenraad (Czech), Kondrat (Russia), Corradi (Italian), Cunradi (Tuscany), Korlat (Hungary), diminutives such as Kienzle, Kunc, Kunz, Kuntz, Kunzel, Zunzelman, and patronymics Kurten, Coners, Conerding, Conradsen, Coenraets, and Kondratovich, and many, many, more. The origination is the ancient compound given name 'Kuoni-rad', which loosely translates as 'brave counsel', and is one of a very large group of similar Germanic names from about fifteen hundred years ago that include Albert, Frederick, and Willhelm. All have similar meanings associated with strength (of both mind and body), victory and courage. It may be that all relate to 'wishful thinking' or hope for the future, as the development of these names coincided with a period of total chaos and seemingly endless war and invasion throughout Europe, following the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century. The name has been recorded since time immemorial, and the first of what might loosely be called a hereditary surname recording, may be that of Conrad Conradi, (Conrad, the son of Little Conrad), in the charters of the German town of Elsabe in the year 1297, with Rudolf Kunzelman or Cunzelman being recorded in Ulm, Switzerland, in 1337.\n\nSources\n\nSt. Margareta Catholic Church records, Sulzbach am Main, Bavaria, Germany\n\nGeburtsmatrikel Sulzbach\n\nGeorge Kuhn\n\nBirth: 12 Mar 1831, Sulzbach am Main\n\nFather: Joseph Kuhn\n\nMother: Elisabeth Fleckenstein\n\nWoods Baltimore City Directory 1864, living at 59 Eastern Ave\n\n1870 Census has surname listed as Koon rather than Kuhn; First Ward, household 1139\n\n1880 Census: https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MNQ9-LL7\n\nFindAGrave: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/183561681/georg-kuhn\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23637449\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/374488099/?terms=George%2BKuhn#\n\nArticles\n\nHistory during George's life and departure from Bavaria: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bavaria\n\nhttps://www.myheritage.com/research/collection-90100/woods-baltimore-city-directory-1873?s=321698691&itemId=119900352&action=showRecord#fullscreen\n\nhttps://www.myheritage.com/research/collection-90100/rl-polk-cos-baltimore-city-directory-1887?s=321698691&itemId=91634705&action=showRecord\n\nhttp://www.baltimoremd.com/charm/pointofentry.html\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1I0nUYwz7wPNiwxD232RtZAYfw0A&hl=en&ll=39.28341647422434%2C-76.62283609712712&z=14\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Bavaria/History\n\nLost taverns of Baltimore\n\nBull's Head Tavern: A tract of property located on North Front Street in “Old Town” Baltimore in 1732 was owned by Captain John Boring in an area known, at that time, as Jones Town. It was a bustling neighborhood of residences, industry and commerce. In 1812, Elizabeth Edwards inherited this parcel of land and building from the Boring family and, with improvements, opened the Tavern House in 1836. By 1880, it became known as the Bull’s Head Tavern and operated under that name until the building was purchased in 1900 by a Russian tailor named Simon Friedman. No records remain to indicate it remained a tavern—the building was later converted to an auto repair shop and by the 1950s replaced by a parking garage. In 1998, sixteen youth, many from the Juvenile Justice System, helped archaeologists uncover relics from Baltimore’s past during excavation for the future Juvenile Justice Center on Gay Street. Among the curiosities unearthed were spittoons, utensils, food bones, hundreds of sugar molds from an early 19th century sugar refinery, and the foundation of the Bull’s Head Tavern.(5)\n\nKaminsky's Inn: Although the Horse You Came in On may have the title of the longest continuously operated tavern in Baltimore, Kaminsky’s Inn, built in 1750 at the northwest corner of Mercer and Grant Streets, may have been the oldest tavern in the city. A 1752 sketch by John Moale (1731-1798)—a prominent landowner and amateur artist—shows a two-story building. A later sketch shows a third story added, according to records at that time, to adjust to alterations in the street level. The Inn was constructed “of wood, two stories and an attic, with dormer windows. The first story was plastered outside and the upper part weather-boarded. A lone flight of stairs from the outside led up to the second story. The building presented the appearance of an old-fashioned German hostelry. It was the grand hotel of the city. Washington, Lafayette and other revolutionary heroes stopped there.”(3) In 1775, Acadians, descendants of French colonists who had settled in Canada’s East Coast Maritime Provinces, were being forced out by the British after the French and Indian War (1754-1763). Several boatloads were sent to Maryland in 1775 and many came to Baltimore, settling in “French Town” on South Charles Street. Many lodged at Kaminsky’s Inn, before continuing on to Louisiana, their initial destination, where the term “Acadian” eventually morphed into “Cajun.”. Kaminsky’s Inn “met its demise in the early 1870s when it was razed to make way for three iron-front buildings at 101-105 East Redwood Street. These buildings were in turn destroyed some 30 years later when the Great Fire of 1904 swept through downtown Baltimore. A dozen years passed before another edifice, the Sun Life Insurance Company Building, was erected.”(4)\n\nThe Fountain Inn opened in 1773 at the southwest corner of what is now Baltimore and Hanover Street. It was built in what was then termed the Old London Style with balconies around a tree shaded courtyard. In 1775 the Inn played host to General George Washington on his way to the Continental Congress and again in 1781 when we was en route to Yorktown. Washington stayed at the Inn again in 1783 when he traveled to Annapolis to resign his commission as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His wife Martha also lodged at the Inn on her frequent trips to visit her husband at his various encampments. The Fountain Inn became the headquarters for the Patriots of the Whig Society—American Whigs were those colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British authority during the Revolution. The Inn weathered the storm of the War of 1812 and the Marquis de Lafayette, during this visit to the United States in 1824-1825, had a suite reserved for him there. The Fountain Inn was razed in 1871 to make room for the Carrolton Hotel, which occupied the site until it was destroyed by the 1904 fire. Lavish for its time, the Southern Hotel opened its doors on this site in 1918 and remained there until 1964. Today the site is a parking lot.\n\nThe Maypole Tavern, in existence at least as early as 1824, was located at 16-18 S. Paca Street at the corner of German (now Redwood) Street. The Maypole was a favorite stopping point for waggoners passing through Baltimore. The first known owner was Henry Clark who operated it until his death in 1836. James Adams took over from Clark—his successor was Isaac Wilson who had been an agent for the B&O Railroad. The National Road, the first major highway in the United States was signed into law by Thomas Jefferson in 1806. Also known as the Cumberland Road, its’ purpose was to open up the West when construction started in 1811. The National Road connected Baltimore with the “Old National Pike” in 1824 and it brought business to the May Pole Tavern, along with others. According to the B&O Employees Magazine, some emigrants staying at the Maypole Hotel started their journey west ward from that point. In 1849, brothers Horatio and William Miller purchased the Maypole and renamed it “Miller’s Hotel.” They may have been more interested in the livery stables that were attached, which could accommodate up to 250 horses. The site, with a number of subsequent owners, remained a tavern until 1897, when it was converted into a warehouse. The livery stables continued to operate until around 1920. In the 1940s the building was torn down. Today the University of Maryland’s School of Social Work occupies the site.(6)\n\nReferences\n\nFrom the recollections of William Francis Kuhn.\n\nCensus 1870, 1880\n\nBaltimore City Records\n\nU.S. Naturalization Records Nov. 6, 1865, New York\n\nAddress from 1873 - 1885 - 428 Eastern Ave (home is no longer there redeveloped.): https://www.google.com/maps/place/428+Eastern+Ave,+Baltimore,+MD+21202/@39.2850912,-76.6039826,46m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c8037da3d7b627:0x1f2b594734bce125!8m2!3d39.2851296!4d-76.6039323\n\nAddress from 1884 - til death - 619 N Clinton: https://www.google.com/maps/place/619+N+Clinton+St,+Baltimore,+MD+21205/@39.2988928,-76.5727732,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c80414bd9f8d17:0xfb5cdb3b4920571f!8m2!3d39.2988928!4d-76.5705845!6m1!1e1\n\nTimeline\n\nHistory of Bavaria/Bayern:\n\nFindings from the Neolithic show that the Sulzbach valley was settled as early as 3500 BC. A circular rampart (Altenburg) on the Schlossberg (hill) between Sulzbach-Soden and Ebersbach (part of neighbouring Leidersbach) was in use in the late Hallstatt period (see Attractions). During Roman times, the Main and the Limes Germanicus formed Germania's border with the then Roman-occupied Odenwald area across the river. In the centuries that followed, several tribes lived in the Sulzbach valley: the Chatti, the Alamanni, the Burgundians and the Franks. It was likely in Charles Martel's time (714–741) that the municipality of Ruchelnheim, which lay within what are now Sulzbach's municipal borders and which was abandoned in the Thirty Years' War, was founded. As far back as Carolingian times, settlements on the streams Sulzbach and Leidersbach, like Sulzbach, Ebersbach, Leidersbach and Roßbach came into being. It is also likely that Soden's founding occurred in late Carolingian times. Sulzbach and Soden were assigned to the parish of Ruchelnheim, itself subordinate to the Stiftskirche Aschaffenburg (de) (collegiate church) in Aschaffenburg. Sulzbach had its first documentary mention in a document from Pope Lucius III, in which a curtem in Sulzibah (estate in Sulzbach) was listed among the Aschaffenburg Stiftskirche's holdings. This dates to 1184.[2]:154 From the mid-13th century, Sulzbach belonged to the Centena Ascaffinburg – the tithing area of Aschaffenburg – whose place was taken in the 15th century by the Cent vorm Spessart. Until the 1803 Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, Sulzbach was under Electoral Mainz's lordship. Thereafter, it was part of Prince Primate von Dalberg's newly formed Principality of Aschaffenburg, with which it passed in 1814 (by this time it had become a part of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt), to the Kingdom of Bavaria. It has remained Bavarian ever since. As in all other areas in the Spessart, farmland was splintered by Mainz inheritance law in the 18th and 19th centuries pulling Sulzbach, too, into an economic downswing with its attendant consequences for living conditions. Only with the onset of industrialization in Aschaffenburg and the opening of the Aschaffenburg-Miltenberg railway line in 1876 did conditions improve. The formerly self-administering municipalities of Dornau and Soden were amalgamated with Sulzbach on 1 July 1971 and 1972, respectively.[3] The status of the municipality was changed to Markt (\"Market\") on 15 May 1973.[4] Category: Bavaria, Germany\n\nHistory timeline of George's life in Baltimore, Maryland, starting with the year before arriving.\n\n1861 – Unarmed Militia Units from Pottsville and Schyulkill County of the Pennsylvania volunteer state militia travel by the Northern Central Railroad (NCRR) from the northeastern part of the Keystone State to the state capital Harrisburg continuing south to Maryland's \"Mason–Dixon line\" and arrive in Baltimore on Thursday, April 18 at the NCRR's Bolton Station and Calvert Street Station (situated between Bath and East Centre Streets – now site of offices/printing plant of The Baltimore Sun since 1950) on way to answer newly elected 16th President Abraham Lincoln's call to the states for 75,000 volunteers and declares a state of insurrection to subdue Southern rebellion, after the firing on Fort Sumter several days before on April 14 in Charleston harbor, in seceding South Carolina by new elements of an organizing Confederate States Army. Joined by two artillery regiments of Regular Army soldiers coming from the West heading for Fort McHenry, the Pennsylvania militiamen march down Howard Street to Camden Street Station to board the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to get to Washington. Because they are unarmed (rifles unloaded) they are jeered, hassled and some assaulted with physical and verbal attacks by Southern sympathizers and the commanding officer's free black servant Nicholas Biddle is injured, although no one is killed or wounded. Later upon arriving in the National Capital, greeted by the President and camping in the halls of the U.S. Capitol, these units are later known as \"The First Defenders\". Baltimore mobs' appetite for violence however is only whetted for more the next infamous day, \"Friday, the Nineteenth of April\". \"Pratt Street Riot\" on Friday, April 19 erupts when the Union's Sixth Massachusetts Regiment of volunteer state militia (from mostly mill towns of Lawrence and Lowell) and \"Washington Brigade\" of Philadelphia of Pennsylvania state militia, is attacked by mobs of Southern sympathizers when making the required transfer on their railroad journeys from Philadelphia to Washington, attempt to transfer horse-drawn railroad cars along East Pratt and President Streets waterfront from the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad's President Street Station to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Camden Street Station. Four soldiers killed and many wounded along with many uncounted Baltimoreans. New Police Marshal George P. Kane and recently elected Reformer Mayor George William Brown with escorts of city police with pistols try to hold back rioters. Later city officials send militia units north and east of the city to burn railroad bridges to forestall any future transfer passages and in meeting with Governor Thomas Hicks in Annapolis and President Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C. request no further military passages through city. Washington is isolated from the North by cut telegraph lines for several weeks. A month later, on May 14, Massachusetts volunteer state militia and now Union General Benjamin F. Butler sends regiments from Relay Junction southwest of city on B. & O. Railroad (where the Main Line to the West at the U.S. Arsenal at Harpers Ferry on the Potomac River and further to Ohio River divides from the Washington Branch to national capital) in night expedition during rainstorm to occupy city and fortify Federal Hill, overlooking downtown harbor \"Basin\" and declaring martial law the following day. Baltimore is occupied by Union Army troops manning surrounding earthen-bermed forts quickly constructed for the duration of the war to 1865. Additional Federal troops reinforce Fort McHenry and numerous members of the State Legislature, Mayor, (George William Brown), City Council and Police Marshal (George P. Kane), and other Board of Police Commissioners are arrested and confined, such as industrialist Ross Winans and politician John Merryman. Provost Marshal for city appointed with local military officer Col. John Kenly and commands city police officers.\n\n1863 – Invasion fears threaten Baltimore authorities in June as Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia passes Baltimore on the west going through Frederick, city placed under stricter martial law, additional militia called out, warships stationed in the harbor, and barricades erected in west-side streets. Later battle fought north at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, largest battle of the War and ever fought in North America. Construction began on stone Italianate style of architecture mansion \"Cylburn\" with material quarried from Bare Hills, in Baltimore County. Designing architect George A. Frederick (later plans for Baltimore City Hall in 1867–1875) on property located on Greenspring Avenue, west of Jones Falls hills, north of Druid Hill Park built for Elisha Tyson, industrialist, financier and Quaker abolitionist and civic activist with project continuing to 1888. Purchased by City in 1942 and estate developed into botanical gardens and arboretum as city park, named \"Cylburn Wildflower Preserve and Garden Center\", with Horticulture Division of Bureau of Parks and Maryland Ornithological Society headquarters, nature museum, mounted bird collections and Fessenden herbarium. House and estate placed on National Register of Historic Places. Newly organized \"Union Club\" sets up on northeast corner of East Franklin and North Charles Street (opposite First Independent Church of Baltimore – later First Unitarian Church (Unitarian and Universalist)), in former Greek Revival styled with stone portico/steps and columns of former William Howard (son of Col. John Eager Howard) mansion. One block east of opposing Southern-sympathizing Maryland Club at former Hoffman mansion at Cathedral and West Franklin. Later mansion becomes headquarters for \"Athenaeum Club\" and temporary site in the early 1870s for new Maryland State Normal School, founded 1866 (later after several name and location changes to Towson University).\n\n1864 – New Maryland state Constitutional Convention summoned and meets drawing up replacement document for previous charter of 1851 which is enacted ending slavery in Baltimore and throughout the state along with providing for additional political, educational and social reforms for the new free black population, which is later quite unpopular with the former white dominant Democratic Party power structure. St. Francis Xavier Church dedicated for Black/Afro-American Roman Catholics at North Calvert and East Pleasant Streets (to 1932). President Abraham Lincoln travels by B. & O. Railroad to now peaceful Baltimore to speak at the hall of the 1851 landmark Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts above Centre (\"Marsh\") Market along Market Place/Harrison Street at East Baltimore Street, by the west bank of Jones Falls to speak to the \"Sanitary Fair' sponsored by the local unit of the U.S. Sanitary Commission there being held to raise funds for orphans, widows and wounded soldiers of the Union Army on April 18. Gives a famous speech entitled the \"Baltimore Address\" or \"Liberty Speech\". Stays overnight in friend's brownstone mansion on Cathedral Street and West Mount Vernon Place, a block west of the Washington Monument. 1864 Republican National Convention temporarily known as the National Union Party, held in city nominates Abraham Lincoln for a second term as president and adding former Democrat but loyalist of Andrew Johnson (1808–1875), former U.S. Senator and War Governor of Tennessee as Vice President to replace previous incumbent Hannibal Hamlin during Lincoln's first term.\n\n1865 – Concordia Opera House opens.[13]. Funeral train for 16th President Abraham Lincoln assassinated April 14 stops in city and procession held for body to ly-in-state at Merchants' Exchange rotunda at South Gay and East Lombard Streets for several hours, cortege followed by thousands. Train continues on cross-country trip across the North to cemetery in Springfield, Illinois. Formation of Baltimore Association for the Moral and Intellectual Improvement of Colored People by the Rev. John F. W. Ware of the First Independent Church of Baltimore (later First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist)) and many freed slaves and freedman, setting up over 200 schools. Establishment by Afro-American Baltimoreans of the Douglass Institute in honor of former resident and escaped slave, Frederick Douglass near old Newton University founded 1840s, on south side of 200 block, East Lexington Street, between North Calvert, Davis Street alley, and North Streets (now Guilford Avenue). Later becomes forerunner for establishment by 1883 of the first \"Colored High School and Training School\", which by 1925 is renamed Frederick Douglass High School.\n\n1866 – New Peabody Institute building dedicated with philanthropist millionaire donor George Peabody (1795–1869), (formerly of Massachusetts, briefly Washington, and 20 years in Baltimore, now of New York City and London, in England) standing on front steps acknowledging the acclaim of thousands of Baltimore City Public Schools pupils gathered during elaborate dedication ceremonies held in front of building at the Washington Monument completed several years before in 1861 but delayed opening by the Civil War, and nine years after the original donation of $800,000. Constructed of white marble, the first section of one-third of building, (west wing) of Institute building located on southeast corner of North Charles Street and East Monument Street, which is also South Washington Place at East Mount Vernon Place, across from the landmark Washington Monument. Designed by famous architect Edmund G. Lind of Classical and early Beaux Arts style architecture, consists of music hall/auditorium, art gallery and small library space. Later second section, two-thirds of building, (east wing), with space for elaborate tiered atrium for future George Peabody Library, and more facilities, completed 12 years later by the same architect, matched perfectly. Authorized by Maryland General Assembly in an act of 1865, providing for a uniform public school system to be established in each of Maryland's 23 counties, along with a state department of education with a superintendent, and a teachers' training institute. The Maryland State Normal School opens January 15, under Professor and Principal McFadden Alexander Newell in temporary quarters in the old Red Men's Hall on North Paca Street, with first graduation ceremony that June. New school soon moves to northeast corner of North Charles Street and East Franklin Street in former Greek Revival 1820s era mansion of William Howard, son of Col. John Eager Howard (1752–1827), which by the Civil War became the Union Club, later the Athenaeum Club. Later construction in 1875 of designated landmark building at northwest corner of Carrollton and Lafayette Avenues with tall corner clock tower, occupied February 1876. Later relocates by 1915 to west side of York Road with construction of buildings for administration (later Stephens Hall) and dormitories/dining hall (Newell Hall) in county seat of Towson in suburban Baltimore County, becoming the Maryland State Teachers College at Towson, then Towson State College, finally Towson University, second largest college/university in the state.ref name=brit1910 />\n\n1867 –Concordia Hall is founded. Centenary Biblical Institute founded by then \"Negro\" or \"Colored\" (now African American) Baptists churches, later renamed as Morgan College, in honor of a former president, then absorbed in 1939 by the state becoming Morgan State College, finally by the 1990s as Morgan State University.\n\n1870 – African-Americans vote in Baltimore for the first time since 1810 with passage of Fifteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution.
