        "text": "Does anyone know anything about the Kuhn family? Also connected to Tracey and Lee. I am researching the family of my grandfather, Gus Kuhn.\n\nThe 1891 census shows Emil Kuhn, (Gus’s grandfather) living at 49 Dearman Road, Aston, Birmingham. His wife was Annie and their children (or at least those at the same address) are listed as Edith, Francois, Emil (Gus’s father), John, Constance, Florence, Mabel, Ralph and Hilda.\n\nGustav Emil Kuhn (my grandfather) was born in 1898 and his father is described as a master cycle maker. His mother is Annie Kuhn (formerly Tracey, born in Stratford 1874). Address 111 Fernley Road, Sparkhill, Yardley. Confusingly, Gus’s Parents and Paternal Grandparents were both called Emil and Annie Kuhn.\n\nThe 1901 Census shows that Gus’s father is now the manager of a wine and spirit merchant. It also lists his wife Annie, a daughter Constance and son Gustav. The address is still Fernley Road. Later Annie died giving birth to another daughter, Wilhelmena (Billie).​\n\nBillie stayed in the Birmingham area, married and became Mrs. Lee. She had a son called John, but was widowed when he was still young. John worked for the Post Office in the Telecom section. I believe Constance may have moved south and died in the early 50s.​\n\nGus joined the RNAS in WW1 and was stationed in London, where he married Eva Crowe. They lived in Clapham and he had a successful career as a motorcycle trials and speedway rider. (see www.guskuhn.net )​\n\nDon't know if this will add anything to what you know, but, in the 1912 Kelly's, there are two Kuhns mentioned:\n\nEmil Kuhn , Newbridge Villas, Coventry Road, Yardley This I estimate is on the site of the car park of the present New Inn.\n\nMiss Kuhn 1 Clarence Road Sparkhill.\n\nThere are no Kuhns in the 1896,1921 or 1940 directories\n\nMike\n\nHi Mike\n\nMany thanks for that info. I would guess that the Emil Kuhn is my grandfather's father and the Miss Kuhn is one of his aunts.\n\nHis mum died when he was about four or six, leaving dad with two kids and a baby. I don't know would have brought them up, as I can't imagine it would have been practical for dad to earn a living and look after the children.\n\nValentina, I have read your pm to me and i would put the \" the chicken stew\" memory as circa 1938 but i am going to speak to my older Brother who will able to give me his memories of your g/father which i will pass on to you. Len."
