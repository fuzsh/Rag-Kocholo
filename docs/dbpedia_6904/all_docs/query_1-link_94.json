        "text": "Kail, Harriet [Coughenour]\n\nMrs. Kail Dies In Bidwell Early Sunday Morning\n\nAged Woman Well-Known in upper Part of County – Funeral to be Held Tuesday at 10 O’clock\n\nMrs. Harriet Kail, an estimable, beloved woman of Bidwell died there at 2 o’clock Sunday morning, after a long illness. She was a native and lifelong resident of the county and a wife of the late James H. Kail, a well-to-do-farmer of Addison Township.\n\nMrs. Kail’s age was 85 years and 20 days, having been born April 11, 1847, in Cheshire Township. She was one of ten children of Isaiah and Margaret Coughenour. Only one of that family survives—Perry Coughenour of Cheshire Township.\n\nThe Kails were married August 22, 1876, and he passed away July 30, 1914. She united with the Second Kyger Freewill Baptist Church early in life and adhered to that faith to the end. Besides her brother, she leaves a number of nephews and nieces. She was a sister-in-law of Mrs. Margaret Coughenour, widow of S. F. Coughenour who died April 2 in Bidwell. In late years Mr. and Mrs. Wilford Bunce, the latter a great-niece, lived with Mrs. Kail and took care of her.\n\nFuneral services will be conducted at the Bidwell M. E. Church at 1 o’clock Tuesday by Rev. Wilford Packer. Burial at Gravel Hill Cemetery by Undertaker Coleman.\n\nGallipolis Daily Tribune\n\nMonday, May 2, 1932\n\nTranscribed by Sandy L. Milliron\n\nKail, James\n\nJames Kail Dead\n\nWell Known Farmer Has Gone To His Last Reward\n\nJames H. Kail, son of George and Nancy Kerr Kail, was born May 25, 1849, died Thursday, July 14, 1914, aged 65, years 2 months and 5 days. He was united in marriage to Harriett Coughenour on August 22, 1875. He is survived by his widow, one brother, John W. Kail, and one sister, Mrs. Mary Coughenour. Two brothers preceded him to the great beyond. Many relatives, neighbors and friends will mourn his death, especially his nephews and nieces, to whom he was greatly attached, and by whom he was dearly loved.\n\nMr. Kail had always made his home on the farm on which he was born. He was an obedient son, a kind and affectionate husband, a loving brother, a true friend, a good neighbor and a patriotic citizen. He had builded an unspotted character, always quiet, modest and sympathic, and deserves the good name his friends gave him. \"A manly man, a man among men.\" He respected the opinions of others, was kind and patient with those who differed with him, and was always ready to make concessions rather than break the thread of friends.\n\nHe never united with any church, but gave liberally to its support. He once said to the writer, \"I would not want to live in a land where there were no churches.\" He was a firm believer in a true and living God.\n\nHe hated evil in all its forms and loved the good with all his heart. He bore his afflictions with patience and greeted his friends with a smile until the last. All that loving hands and medical skill could do was done for him, but He who doeth all things well called and he is not, for God took him. He fully realized that he\n\ncould not get well and said, \"I am not afraid to die.\"\n\nThe funeral was held late Sunday afternoon at his late home, the services being conducted by his life-long friend, Rev. W.J. Fulton. The large number present showed the high esteem in which he was held. The floral offerings were most beautiful. Burial was in the Gravel Hill Cemetery by undertaker De Maine. W.J. Fulton\n\nGallia Times\n\nAugust 6, 1914\n\nTranscribed by Henny Evans\n\nKail, James H.\n\nJames H. Kail Passes to the Great Beyond at His Home in Cheshire\n\nJames H. Kail, son of George and Nancy Kern Kail was born May 25, 1849, died July 30, 1914 age 65 years, 2 months and 5 days.\n\nHe was united in marriage, to Harriet Coughenour August 22, 1875, whom he leaves to mourn the loss. Besides the wife, he leaves one brother, John, and one sister, Mrs. Mary Coughenour. Two brothers, William and Jacob have gone before. He also leaves many nephews and nieces, to whom he was very much attached, and by whom he was dearly loved.\n\nMr. Kail will be missed by a host of friends living far and near, especially those living in the immediate vicinity, as he was born, reared and lived his life at the present homestead. He was an obedient son, a kind and affectionate husband, a loving brother, a precious uncle, a loyal friend, a good neighbor and a patriotic citizen.\n\nMr. Kail leaves an unspotted character. He has been an exceptional man, always quiet and modest and sympathetic. He was a true gentleman and fully deserves the names his friends have given him such as a manly man, a man among men.\n\nHe respected the ideas of others, always willing to listen to the opinions of other men, ever kind and patient to those who differed with him, willing to compromise rather than break the thread of friendship with any one.\n\nHe never identified himself with any church but he always gave liberally for the support of the church. He once made the remark in the presence of the writer, “I should not want to live in a land of no churches.” He was a firm believer in a true and living God. He hated evil in all its forms but loved good with all his heart.\n\nAltho his last months were accompanied with intense pain, he bore it all patiently and always greeted his friends with a smile until the last. Everything was done that loving hands and medical skill could do, but all to no avail. He fully realized that his case was hopeless and said, “I am satisfied and not afraid to die.”\n\nHis funeral was held Sunday afternoon at the home, conducted by Rev. W. J. Fulton and was largely attended. The floral offerings were most beautiful. Burial was at Gravel Hill.\n\nGallipolis Journal\n\nFriday, August 7, 1914\n\nTranscribed by Suzanne Giroux\n\nKail, Mabel Edith [Leonard]\n\nMrs. Kail of Cheshire Dies\n\nMrs. Mabel Edith Kail, 75, a resident of Cheshire, died at Holzer hospital at 9:30 p.m. Saturday 10 hours after her admission.

Keller, 14, of 918 Second Avenue, was fatally injured on Eastern Avenue last evening. In less than two hours he died at the Holzer Hospital from fractures of the skull and many other injuries. A heavy wheel, breaking loose from the axle of a loaded coal truck, rolled 300 feet, crashed into the boy, knocked him down and unconscious, and then rolled 30 or 40 feet more across the street before its momentum was exhausted. But to make the accident all the stranger, the driver of the truck was Robert Keller, 18, older brother of the boy killed. They are sons of Mr. and Mrs. William Ammon Keller, who live in the old Pepple property on upper Second Ave.\n\nHead Strikes Pavement\n\nThe accident occurred at about 5:30, Glenn had just delivered a Columbus paper at the home of Roscoe Allen, who lives the first door below C. B. Allen’s store and on the corner of Eastern ave. and Berger Street, the latter being the street that extends out to H. P. Bradbury’s and Harry Swisher’s homes. The boy had returned to the sidewalk and turned down the street, going but a few steps when the wheel bowled him over. Whether or not he saw the wheel and made an effort to dodge it could not be learned. One resident of the neighborhood said the wheel seemed to bounce high just before it collided with the boy. The impact knocked the boy on his back or side, his head striking the concrete pavement, and then the wheel bounded over the curb and rolled across the avenue before it stopped.\n\nBoth legs were terribly bruised and skinned and the left one seemed to be fractured at the knee. There was an injury in the groin area that might have been sufficient to cause death. The chest, too, was skinned and bruised and there appeared to be extensive fractures and cuts on the skull and scalp. Robert says he saw Glenn and recognized him, a second before the latter was struck down.\n\nBoth parts of the double rear left wheel came off as the truck, going east, was opposite the home of John Walters. The exact spot can be determined by the markings on the street by the wheel rim. From that point to the spot where young Keller fell is estimated at 300 feet; and it was about 500 feet farther, perhaps more, to the point where the truck stopped in front of the P. E. Casto store. The other wheel took a different course, running into a garden below the Hanna filling station.\n\nThird Fatal Accident\n\nRobert was hauling coal from out near Theviner to Dam 26, he said. This morning, his truck, still loaded and minus the one double wheel, was parked on Second ave., below Pine. Last evening’s accident was the third fatal motor accident in which he has figured. He was riding with Francis Evans when Vinton Cox was run into and killed here in December, 1932. Robert ran into a stranger named J. J. Stacy at the intersection of Second and Spruce one night last October, Stacy later dying from his injuries. However, no blame attached to Robert in either accident.\n\nGlenn Shaffer Keller was born near Cadmus and was 14 years old on April 4. Robert is the only other child of his parents. The father operates a motorized grocery and is known throughout the county. The family moved here from Vinton two or three years ago. They occupied the French City hotel for about a year and have been living at 918 Second since December.\n\nThe boy’s body was moved to A. E. Tope’s mortuary. Funeral services will be held at the Baptist Church at 2 o’clock Wednesday, in charge of Rev. George Sagen and Rev. Earl Brewer. Burial at Mound Hill by Tope.\n\nThe following pall bearers were selected: Wilson Rust, John Newton Kerr, Clarence Boster, Fred Langdon, Junior Meadows and Morris Haskins.\n\nGallipolis Daily Tribune\n\nTuesday, May 29, 1934\n\nTranscribed by Sandy L.

Kennedy, of Mercerville, O., departed this life November 14, 1894, aged 80 years. Her remains were interred at the M.E. burying ground, Swan Creek, Ohio.\n\nIn all the relations of life as a wife, step-mother, neighbor and friend, she was, in a high degree, an example to her sex--meriting and retaining the love, esteem and confidence of all who knew her. To know her was to love her. She was lovely in disposition and possessed in an eminent degree all those qualities of heart and mind, which made every one her friend.\n\nShe was not afraid to die and when the hour of her departure drew near, she passed away without a murmur, through the dark shadow of death into the bright world beyond. No more will the sound of thy loving voice cheer our aching hearts. Their is an empty void that cannot be filled.\n\nWhen the heart is first wrung with grief for dear ones whom it has pleased God to remove from among us, death seems to be an enemy; but when the agonies of grief have melted away into the gentle tear of recollection, there is something grand and consoling in the idea of death. So, friends, let us bow in humble submission to the will of God, remembering that her spirit is only another link in that bright, golden chain, binding you closer to heaven.

Mr. Kennedy was a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Wayne Kennedy, one of the pioneer families of Ohio Township, and left the parent roof when quite a young man to try his fortune in the far west. He first located in Portland, Oregon, where he married and reared a family. For several years he was a conductor on the Oregon Pacific railroad, and filled that position creditably until he was compelled to retire from the railroad business on account of an injury received when jumping from a car when the train met with an accident. He was unable to work at anything for some time.\n\nIn later years he went to far away Alaska, where he held a position with the government until his health failed and he could no longer endure the severe climate of that country. He returned to Portland where he lived with his son Leslie until a month prior to his death. An operation was performed after he entered the hospital in the hope of saving his life, but he never rallied from the shock.\n\nMr. Kennedy is survived by the following brothers and sisters: Leslie Kennedy of Villisca, Iowa, A. J. Kennedy, Miss Emma Kennedy and Mrs. Thomas Morton of Waugh Bottom. A. J. and Miss Emma reside at the old Kennedy homstead.\n\nMr. Kennedy's body was cremated, and the ashes sent to his old home a few days ago where they were deposited by loving hands beside his father and mother in the family burying ground.\n\nGallipolis paper\n\nDecember 19, 1922\n\nTranscribed by Maxine Marshall Top of Page\n\nKennedy, Clarence\n\nVINTON - Clarence (Dick) Kennedy, 48, Vinton, died Sunday evening at Holzer Medical Center after a short illness.

Kent and Matilda Kent, was born February 4th, 1865, In Ewington, Gallia County, Ohio, and died September 3d, 1894 at the home of her parents, near Middleport, Ohio, aged 29 years, 6 months and 29 days.\n\nShe was married twice - the first time to Nelson B. Grover, the second time to John Harmon, who now survives her. She leaves 2 children - Chloe Grover, aged 6 years, and Eve Harmon, aged 18 months, whom she committed to the care of Almighty God on her death bed.\n\nRebecca joined the Methodist Episcopal Church in Gallipolis, Ohio, when she was about 12 years of age, but was not converted until some years later, at Porter, Ohio.\n\nShe took sick at her home in Huntington, West Virginia, on the 18th day of March, 1894. From the first she said she would never get well. She yearned to come home - home to her father, mother and sisters - the happy home of her childhood. Oh! How much that meant to her, God only knows. She got a little better, and came home on the 2d day of June, 1894. How glad she was to get home! Although, as she said, she “came home to die.”\n\nFor a short time she seemed to grow better, and her eyes that had been dimmed with tears, now brightened and for a while we fondly hoped we could rob death of his victim. But, alas! It was not to be as we hoped. The Lord must come to claim His own. She grew suddenly worse, and suffered intensely. But she bore it all with patience and resignation. “Death had lost his sting” long before she died, and she could exultingly exclaim, “Oh grave, where is thy victory?”\n\nDuring her last sickness, she gave frequent witness of her faith and hope in her loving Savior. But she is dead! Oh, no, not dead, but gone before. The remembrances of her will live with us, and the words, “Pa, kiss me,” will linger and reverberate along the years of life, until we meet on the other shore.\n\nHer Father and Mother.\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nSaturday, September 22, 1894\n\nTranscribed by Sandy L.
