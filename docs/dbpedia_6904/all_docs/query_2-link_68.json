Kuhn and William S. Kuhn under the name W.S. Kuhn and Company, which was formed in 1882 and was based in their hometown of McKeesport, Pennsylvania. William S. Kuhn formed five water companies, including one in Muncie, Indiana, where their father, John S. Kuhn (1813-1883), lived and owned the local gas company.\n\nCity\n\nState\n\nCompany\n\nIncorporated\n\nCompleted\n\nNotes\n\nConnellsville PA Connellsville Water Company March 21, 1883 September, 1883 Wellsville NY Wellsville Water Company September 29, 1883 December 1, 1883 Sold to the Village of Wellsville on September 1, 1915 for $75,000. Sioux Falls SD Sioux Falls Water Company June 26, 1884 November, 1884 Franchise expired in 1904 and the city built a new system. New Haven PA New Haven Water Company July 22, 1884 Supplied by Connellsville Water Company, which bought the system before 1911. Muncie IN Muncie Water-Works Company March 24, 1885 July 31, 1885\n\nThe Kuhn brothers joined with Charles H. Payson and others to form the American Water Works and Guarantee Company (Limited) under the 1874 Pennsylvania partnership law on August 20, 1886. Using a partnership allowed the firm to own stock in the water and gas companies they built and bought, whereas corporations could not own stock in other companies. $400,000 of the paid up capital came from stock in the above five companies, plus $50,000 of the $125,000 capital stock of the Hornellsville Water Company along with stock from gas light companies in Braddock and Muncie.\n\nStatistical Tables of American Water Works, 1887, Page 50\n\nThe partners built or bought another nineteen water systems between 1886 and 1891. The following table shows the year the company built or bought the works, along with the year they were sold to local municipalities by successor companies. Where no date is shown in the \"sold\" column, the system is still owned by the American Water Works Company.\n\nCity\n\nState\n\nCompany\n\nBuilt\n\nBought\n\nSold\n\nWichita KS Wichita Water Co 1886 1957 Mt.

The company's investors organized the American Water Works and Guarantee Company in New Jersey on January 26, 1891, which took over and continued to operate the 1886 limited partnership.\n\nThe new company built and bought several water systems, but also invested heavily in irrigation systems in the west, which stretched its finances to the breaking point and it was declared bankrupt in 1913. The reorganized company was incorporated in Virginia as the American Water Works and Electric Company. The company reincorporated under the same name in Delaware in 1927 to take advantage of that state's more favorable corporation laws and to avoid inheritance tax on Virginia corporation stock.\n\nThe company in partnership with Chemical Bank & Trust Company of New York formed the American Communities Company in 1936 to acquire control of the Community Water Service Company's 43 water systems. The name of American Communities Company was changed to the American Water Works Company Inc, on March 19, 1946 as part of a plan to divest the water properties into a separate company. John H. Ware, Jr. acquired 60% of the the water assets at an auction in 1947 and placed them under the control of the Northeastern Water Company. American Water Works merged with the Northeastern Water Company on August 17, 1962.\n\nOn January 10, 2003 American Water Works Company, Inc. was acquired by RWE and became American Water, but was divested on April 23, 2008 in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMajor Acquisitions and Divestments Bought Sold Regulated water assets of the Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company 1996 Borough of Coatesville PA water and wastewater systems 2001 51 water systems in Texas sold to Aqua America 2011\n\nHoldings in Missouri bought from Aqua America 2011\n\nSeven water systems in New York bought from Aqua America 2012\n\nEight water systems in Ohio sold to Aqua America 2012\n\nAmerican Water Works Company corporate web site.| Wikipedia page |\n\nReferences\n\n1886 Articles of Partnership Association, American Water Works and Guarantee Company, April 20, 1886 (Pennsylvania)\n\n1886 Annual report of the mayor and officers of the city of Raleigh, for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1887.\n\nPages 111-156: Report of Water-Works Committee\n\nPage 123: List of bidders, August 9, 1886, including American Water-works Company.\n\n1888 Sioux City Journal, October 17, 1888, Page 4.\n\nFor some time past negotiations have been in progress to transfer the stock of the Clinton Water-works company to the American Water-works and Guarantee company, limited, which has a paid capital of $500,000, principal offices, Pittsburg, Pa.

This is not because of lack of opportunity. There are still plenty of places where, by the construction of reservoirs that could store the spring floods, land which is now worthless desert could be converted into fertile and profitable fields.\n\nBut when the enthusiast who sees the possibilities of such a situation goes to a banking house in the East and asks it to finance the work, he is met with a reception compared to which a journey of polar exploration would be tropical. It will not do to blame the banker for this, because he knows by experience that irrigation bonds are today practically unsalable. Not a few banking houses have suffered in purse and in reputation because of the irrigation enterprises which they have financed in the past. It is worth while asking, therefore, why irrigation is unprofitable. It is true that many irrigation projects have been run by irresponsible men who have sought merely to sell stocks and bonds with little care whether the purchasers ever received any return or not. This, however, is only a part of the explanation why irrigation securities are shunned by investors. Wild-cat mining stocks innumerable have been sold in all parts of the country; but a valuable mine or valuable mining stock is not thereby rendered impossible of sale.\n\nThe trouble with irrigation enterprises is that even when they have been honestly and intelligently financed and managed, the final result has usually been either a loss to the investors or a return too small on the whole to pay for the risk and trouble. There are, of course, a few notable exceptions to this general rule. We are speaking in a large way now, and dealing not with particular enterprises but with the general run of well managed irrigation projects under private enterprise.\n\n1913 \"Annual Report American Water Works & Guarantee Company,\" Electric Railway Journal 41(26):1177 (June 28, 1913)\n\n1913 American Water Works and Guarantee Company in receivership, July 7, 1913.\n\n1913 \"Kuhn Brothers Both Known in Muncie,\" Muncie Evening Press, July 7, 1913, Page 1. | Part 2 | Part 3 |\n\nBuilt local water works plant and American Water Works Company was organized and for several years had is offices here - Will S.

Further, this step would mean an annual saving in taxes to the Company, and, due to the fact that the stock of a Delaware corporation is not subject to the Delaware inheritance tax when held by non-residents of Delaware, it would be of importance to the vast majority of the Companys common stockholders, who were subject to a Virginia inheritance tax.\n\nThe plan further contemplated the redemption of the Virginia Companys 7% Preferred Stock and the issuance of a $6 no par value Preferred Stock; changing the common stock to stock of no par value; and the issuance of two shares of the new Company's common stock in lieu of one of the old.\n\nThis plan, having been approved by the stockholders, was declared operative on July 23, 1927, and was promptly put into effect.\n\n1928 James Speer Kuhn grave, October 3, 1853 - December 13, 1928\n\n1928 Fifteenth Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1928.\n\n1930 Seventeenth Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1930.\n\n1931 Eighteenth Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1931.\n\n1932 Nineteenth Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1932.\n\n1933 Charles Henry Payson grave, April 12, 1853 - April 27, 1933\n\n1933 Twentieth Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1933.\n\n1934 Relation of Holding Companies to Operating Companies in Power and Gas Affecting Control, 73d Congress, 2d Session, H.

Samuel and Mary (Phillips) Payson; Rev. Phillips and Kezia (Bullen) Payson; Rev. Seth and Grata (Payson) Payson, and Rev. Edward and Louisa (Shipman) Payson, the grandparents of Charles H. Payson. His grandfather (q.v.) was one of the most eminent Congregationalist clergymen of his generation.\n\nFollowing his graduation at the Portland high school in 1870 Charles H. Payson entered the employ of his uncle Henry Martyn Payson, who in 1854 had founded a brokerage and investment business in Portland under the name of H. M. Payson & Co. When his uncle withdrew from the firm in 1886 Charles H. Payson succeeded him as president, retaining this position until his retirement in 1929.\n\nEarly in his business career he became interested in private water works companies and soon was nationally recognized as an expert in the development, management and financing of such enterprises. At his suggestion the American Water Works & Guarantee Co. was organized in 1888 for the purpose of building, buying and operating water companies, and he was a director of this company until he resigned in 1908, following the decision of the company to go into irrigation projects.\n\nA public-spirited citizen, he was prominently associated with social, welfare, educational and religious organizations. He was conspicuous for his widespread generosity and for his deep sense of personal responsibility for the success of the various causes in which his interest was enlisted. One of his major interests was the Maine general hospital in Portland. Elected an assistant incorporator in 1874, he afterward became a director and during the latter years of his life devoted much of his time to the raising of funds for the institution. In religion he was a Congregationalist. He was a lover of outdoor life and recreation and was widely known as a chess expert. His integrity, friendliness and Christian character commanded general respect and affection. Bowdoin college awarded him an honorary A.M. degree in 1914, \"in recognition of his character, eminent citizenship and beneficence.\" He was married Dec. l, 1886. to Margaret, daughter of Eliphaet Haskell Merrill, of Portland, and they had three children: Margaret, Phillips Merrill and Elinor Payson, wife of Douglas Rulison Coleman. He died in Portland, Maine, Apr. 27, 1933.\n\n1938 Fourth Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1938.\n\nPages 10-11: American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc.\n\n1938 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1938.\n\nPages 51-53: Subsidiary Companies of American Water Works and Electric Company, Incorporated as of December 31, 1938\n\n1939 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1939.\n\n1940 Herbert Payson grave, December 11, 1860 - July 25, 1940\n\n1940 Consolidated Income Account of Company and Subsidiaries, September 30, 1940.\n\n1940 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1940.\n\n1941 Consolidated Income Account of Company and Subsidiaries, June 30, 1941.\n\n1941 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1941.\n\n1942 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1942.\n\n1943 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1943.\n\n1944 Tenth Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPage 83: American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc.\n\n1944 William Speer Kuhn grave, November 30, 1856 - August 30, 1944\n\n1944 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1944.\n\n1945 Eleventh Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPage 55: American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc.\n\n1945 Annual Report of the American Water Works & Electric Company Incorporated for the year ending December 31, 1945.\n\n1946 American Communities Company name changed to American Water Works Company Inc, March 19, 1946.\n\n1946 \"American Water Works Co., Inc.,\" Commercial and Financial Chronicle 164:1825 (April 4, 1946)\n\n1946 Twelfth Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPages 67: American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc.\n\n1946 \"American Water Works Co., Inc.,\" Commercial and Financial Chronicle 164:1980 (October 17, 1946)\n\n1946 In the Matter of American Water Works and Electric Company, Incorporated; American Water Works Company, Inc.

(American) and certain of its subsidiaries. An order was issued on March 19, 1947 by the district court finding these plans fair and equitable and appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section 11 (b) of the act.\n\nHolding Company Act releases Nos. 7091 and 7208.\n\nPlan I is is concerned primarily with the creation of a new water works holding company to be known as American Water Works Co., Inc. Two subholding companies, Community Water Service Co.and Ohio Cities Water Corp., will be dissolved and the new holding company will then own directly or indirectly substantially all of the waterworks properties in the American system. Ten-year serial debentures of the new company in the amount of $15,000,000 are to be sold to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and approximately 2,500,000 shares of common stock are to be sold at competitive bidding.\n\nPlan II, which is to be undertaken after the consummation of plan I, proposes the liquidation of American. Thus, after segregation of the water companies in a new system, the remaining subsidiaries will be controlled by the West Penn Electric Co., now a subholding company in the American system. Under plan II American will payoff in cash its bank loan notes and preferred stock and will distribute its residual assets to its common stockholders. The question as to whether the preferred stock shall be retired at its liquidation price of $100 per share or at some greater amount has not been determined. The plan provides that certificates of contingent interest in any such additional payment shall be distributed to preferred stockholders if final determination of this question has not been made at the time plan II becomes effective.\n\nCommunity and Ohio Cities have outstanding preferred stocks with substantial dividend arrearages, and the Commission has determined that the equitable equivalent of such shares is $180 per share and $159 per share respectively, plus, in each case, an allowance for accrued dividends from October31,1945 to the effective date of the plan. Holders of the preferred stocks are to be given the option of receiving the amounts due them in cash or in new common stock of American Water Works Co., Inc., on the basis of the initial public offering price.\n\n1947 American Water Works and Electric Company, Inc. was liquidated after the water interests had been transferred to the American Water Works Company.

In 1882, with limited capital, James and William organized The American Water Works and Guarantee Company.

Payson & Co. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information\n\nPayson first became involved in water bonds when the Portland Water Company was formed in 1866, the same year that a great fire destroyed more than 200 acres in the heart of Portland, including Payson's own offices. It was a major blow to the local economy, given that an estimated $10 million in property was destroyed and only a third was insured. Payson helped to buoy the city's confidence by immediately making a public declaration that he would rebuild his office on the old site and vowed to be back in business there within six months. In many respects, a reliable water supply available to combat fires was of even greater importance during this period than healthy drinking water. New York City, for example, was in great need of unpolluted water, but it was only due to the threat of large-scale fires that the leading American city saw fit to build a modern water works.\n\nIn Portland the idea to tap into nearby Sebago Lake was first suggested in 1854, due to a drought that led to a short supply of water, but it was not until February 1866 that the Portland Water Company was incorporated. The fire that devastated the city on July 4 helped to spur the actual launch of the company. Water from Sebago finally began serving Portland in November 1869. Unfortunately, the company was poorly funded and managed. The main had not been properly laid, significantly hampering the flow of water. After the company twice succumbed to bankruptcy, Payson in the early 1870s was induced to join the board and help place the company on a solid financial footing. He was instrumental in securing the funds necessary to improve the infrastructure and turn Portland Water into a profitable business. It also marked Payson's entry into the water business, which became a main interest of the company for several decades.\n\nAs a result of his conservative approach, Paysons' clients were not wiped out like so many investors when the panic of 1873 hit the country, leading to a harsh five-year depression. During this time, in 1874, Payson took on his first partner, George F. Thurston, whom he had groomed since Thurston had graduated from high school and went to work for him as a clerk. A third partner joined the firm in 1879: Payson's nephew, Charles H. Payson, who like Thurston had no more than a high school education and worked his way up, also starting out as his uncle's clerk. Charles Payson's tenure would last more than 50 years and his influence on the firm's growth, both nationally and internationally, was so pronounced that he was considered H.M. Payson & Co.'s second founder.\n\nSeven years after becoming a partner he became president when Payson chose to retire. Under Charles Payson's leadership the firm became even more committed to the water business. In 1888 he traveled to London to sell $1 million worth of bonds in the Portland Water Company to help shore up the utility's finances. Moreover, he represented another $1 million in water for nine other water companies, including ventures in Elmira, New York; East Greenwich, Connecticut; Kokomo, Indiana; Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Wichita, Kansas; Fort Smith, Arkansas; Huntington, West Virginia; Meridian, Mississippi; and Merrill, Wisconsin. On that trip he also sold securities for the Marion (Indiana) Gaslight Company. In addition to selling bonds, Charles Payson became involved in running several water companies that he helped to found or acquired. The firm also underwrote any number of utility bonds during the final decades of the 1800s. The firm's interests spread from coast to coast, touching more than 100 utilities and leading Payson to become known as \"The Water Bond House.\"\n\nCharles Payson and several outside partners in 1886 created the American Water Works and Guarantee Company, which built and developed water companies across the country. Soon joining him would be two Payson partners: George S. Payson, the founder's son, who became a partner in 1883 and Herbert Payson, who became a partner in 1889. The three men acted as American Water Work's financial agents. When the firm formed American Water Supply Co. in 1888, the Payson partners added operational responsibilities as well. Payson now acquired control of water companies as far away as Kansas and ran them out of the Portland office. Even after American Water Supply was liquidated, the investment firm remained involved in the water business. In 1926 two Payson partners--Herbert Payson and Harold C. Payson, who became partner in 1919--and five outside partners formed a utility holding company called Consumer's Water Company, which not only housed some of the partners' water assets but also acquired companies, so that by the early 1930s the venture controlled ten subsidiaries in seven states. Payson maintained a connection to the company until 1999 when Philadelphia Suburban Water Company acquired it. Also of note, was Payson's acquisition of Lewiston Gas Light Co. in 1899. The firm developed the utility, which became a highly successful New England company, now part of Northern Utilities Inc.\n\n© 2019 Morris A. Pierce"
