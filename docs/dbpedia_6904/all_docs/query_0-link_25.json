        "text": "Specialist Investigations with a view to Confirming the Authenticity & Attributions of Works of Art believed to be by:\n\nINDAGARE AUTENTICITÃ E ATTRIBUZIONI DELL'ART - ENQUÃTE SUR L'AUTHENTICITÃ ET LES ATTRIBUTIONS DE L'ART\n\nWalt Francis Kuhn\n\n'Walt Kuhn'\n\nAmerican\n\n(1877-1949)\n\nBorn in New York, Khun became something of an aficionado of the theatre, the circus and vaudeville. Burlesque show girls, circus performers, including clowns, acrobats and ringmasters more or less epitomise his work created in the individual, almost signature portrait technique that Walt Khun developed. Deep, quite probing, intense and sometimes even disturbing. Though he experimented with cubism and fauvism, there are also some rarer landscapes and many quite bold still lifes in his oeuvres.\n\nHis works, as you will see from the examples set out below, fetch very high prices at auction so there is a real need to be extremely cautious and scrutinise the legitimacy of any painting claiming to be by him and equally, any descriptors that are given of them. Identifying any historically incorrect attributions that may have been previously given is vitally important, as they to may need to be investigated and clarified.\n\nUnfortunately sometimes there are artist attributions and descriptions that are deliberately falsified to deceive potential buyers. So any formal attribution should also be examined very carefully indeed. If only to verify that the quality, level of academicism and the accuracy of that assignment to that particular artist is well established and rightfully ascribed. Confirming that it is specifically accurate, correctly researched and a credible academic attribution is essential and it should always be kept in mind, that any attribution, no matter at what level of credibility or status it comes from, is still only an opinion that the work 'might' be by that artist.\n\nIt's a matter of your personal interpretation, discretion and judgement as to how you view and indeed, respect it.\n\nTo help understand the generally observed and well accepted semantics that are used in auction descriptions, they are set out further down this page. They define exactly what the 'expert' view of the work being offered is and they can also have a distinct bearing on the financial outcome. So be cautious that you don't miss the often well 'disguised' attribution. One that is carefully placed or even hidden somewhere in that descriptor which starts off by stating that it actually is BY the artist.\n\n***\n\nÂ\n\nÂ As a specialist fine art consultancy conducting art authenticity and attribution investigations internationally, we have been confidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients. People from all over the world and for well over 45 years from our bases in Europe, the UK and north America.Â\n\nIn so doing, we have investigated the authenticity of both single works of art and complete collections for clients. Conducted in-depth authentication and legitimacy investigations and directed full academic and forensic applications. Researching the origins of works of art, from different geographical regions, genres and from all eras.\n\nWe also scrutinize and conduct research necessary to verify the provenance and ownership lineage as a matter of due diligence.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ We are able to assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues relating to the investigation of the legitimacy and attributions of American art, including the works of Walt Kuhn and any other work of art that you need assistance or advice with.\n\nSome examples associated with this name appear below simply as comparative illustrations.\n\n*No inference is made, nor is it intended as to the question of their legitimacy here on this page. Moreover they are an across the board, representational view of the differing types of works of art that have, are, or may in the future be offered and advertised for sale at auction internationally in the public domain that you may need specialist advise on.\n\nÂ\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nÂ Â\n\nÂ\n\nÂ We strongly advise all clients before they embark on a full investigation into the legitimacy of art, or an artist or studio attribution inquiry, that it is very wise to engage us to undertake an impartial preliminary assessment of viability conducted first. One that is made to balance any issues that may be present that could make the longer term exercise unviable.\n\nÂ This is a professional advisory service we provide and based upon the images you supply, the full details of work of arts acquisition, its history and provenance as is known to you, along with sight of any documentation, previous research or analysis that you may formerly have had conducted on it. You should then have a far better understanding of both the prospects that lie ahead, or any pitfalls we might face, before making a decision.\n\nThis is a logical and cost effective professional review and advisory for which there is a modest set fee.\n\nOur FAQ section covers this in more detail.\n\n<FAQS>\n\nCONTACT US\n\nCONTACTEZ NOUS\n\nÂ\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n* ABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND ITS TERMINOLOGY *\n\nAs if in this case as if they were defining the works of the artist;Â Â\n\nWalt Francis Kuhn - American (1877-1949)\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ *It is very important to clearly understand the general auction terms that are widely used in a published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear an applied signature' or monogram.\n\nÂ Where the name, Walt Kuhn (1877 - 1949) is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as,Walt Kuhn including the dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt, it is a genuine and authentic item and one painted by that specific artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on that artist.\n\nÂ When Walt Kuhn (1877 - 1949) is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or Attribue, imputer Ã , imputÃ©e, or atribudo, or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it only 'possibly' may be by the artist.\n\nÂ But if the term Walt Kuhn (1877 - 1949) - circle of, entourage, or \"Circle of \"Walt Kuhn is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil, assistant or student.\n\nÂ When the name is given thus; Painted in the \"Style of or \"Follower of Walt Kuhn (1877 - 1949) is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artist's way, in their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.\n\nÂ If the phrase in the \"Manner of Walt Kuhn is used or is defined..\" then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.\n\nÂ When the term \"After Walt Kuhn \" is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.\n\nÂ Signed -Walt Kuhn ; \"Dated..\" or \"Inscribed Walt Kuhn \" Then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.\n\nÂ When the term 'Bears signature', is used, or the name, Walt Kuhn is specified followed by the words; \"With signature ..\", or \"With date ..\" or \"With ......inscription..\" or \"Bears signature of Walt Kuhn , / date / or inscription\" Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, apocryphal, of doubtful authenticity, forged and has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
