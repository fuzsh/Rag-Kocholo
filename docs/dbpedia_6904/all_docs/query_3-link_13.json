        "text": "Kuhn: What does the surname Kuhn mean?\n\nThe last name Kuhn is of German origin and primarily translates to \"bold\" or \"brave\". It is derived from the Middle High German term \"kuhn\" or \"kuoni\", meaning \"daring\" or \"experienced\". This surname often referred to individuals who were brave and daring. Over time, it evolved into a very popular surname in regions where German is spoken. It is also found in the Jewish (Ashkenazic) community, adopted by Jews in Eastern and Central Europe during the requirement in the late 18th-century to take on fixed hereditary surnames. It's important to note that names could also have been derived from different origins or meanings in different regions and families.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nKuhn: Where does the name Kuhn come from?\n\nThe last name Kuhn is of German origin, derived from the Middle High German word \"küne\" which means \"bold\" or \"brave\". Historically, it was used as a nickname before evolving into a surname. It was often given to people who were known for their daring or audacious behavior.\n\nToday, the name is commonly found in Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. In terms of demographics, Kuhn is most prevalent in Southwest Germany, particularly in the states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. In the U.S., it is concentrated in the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and California. Some bearers of this surname immigrated to the U.S. during the mid to late 18th century, resulting in an increased prevalence. Over time, the distribution of the Kuhn surname has been influenced by migration patterns; therefore, it can also be found in pockets globally. Despite its German origin, bearers may not necessarily have German ancestry due to various historical circumstances such as intermarriage and adoption.\n\nVariations of the surname Kuhn\n\nThe surname Kuhn has several associated variants and alternate spellings. Some of these include Kuhne, Kuhnel, Kuhnert, Kuhner, and Kuhnen, all of which carry the surname's original Germanic meaning relating to the bold, or the brave. However, given the phonetic nature of the name's spelling, it may also tie into similar sounding names of different origins, such as Coon or Koon.\n\nSome surnames of the same origin include Lemke, Roloff, and Springer, which are also rooted in Germanic culture and ancestry. Another possibility lies in the Austrian surname, Kun, which may be another variant tied to the name Kuhn.\n\nIn Switzerland, particularly in the German-speaking part, one might encounter the name Kuen, an alternate spelling believed to be descended from the same origins as Kuhn.\n\nIn the Jewish (Ashkenazic) region, names like Kohn and Kuhn are common and often refer to someone who is a priest. Kohen, another related name, also has similar meanings.\n\nPlease note that the exact origins of a surname could be pretty complicated due to the history of migration, regionally specific dialects, and spelling changes over time, so all possibilities might not be covered here.\n\nFamous people with the name Kuhn\n\nThomas Kuhn: A famous philosopher and scientist, known for his work in the philosophy of science.\n\nHarald Kuhn: A renowned economist who made significant contributions to game theory.\n\nJohn Kuhn: An American football player who played as a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers.\n\nLarry Kuhn: A prominent businessman and philanthropist, well-known in the fashion industry.\n\nMaggie Kuhn: An American activist known for founding the Gray Panthers movement, advocating for the rights of the elderly in the US.\n\nJudy Kuhn: An American singer and actress, known for her work on Broadway.\n\nAndreas Kuhn: A German artist and illustrator.\n\nGustav Kuhn: An Austrian conductor and theatre director.\n\nStefan Kuhn: A Canadian cross-country skier who represented Canada in multiple Winter Olympic Games.\n\nBrad Kuhn: An American car racer known for his achievements in midget car racing.\n\nFriedrich Kuhn: A Swiss linguist and scholar.\n\nBarnaby Kuhn: An American magician better known under his stage name, Barney K., he was a well-regarded figure in the Vaudeville era.\n\nSigrid Kuhn: A German textile artist.\n\nVilmos Kuhnen: A famous Hungarian footballer.\n\nOther surnames"
