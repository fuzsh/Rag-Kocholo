        "text": "Kuhn History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nIsrael\n\nThe distinguished surname Kuhn is a proud sign of an ancient Jewish culture. The surname Kuhn is an occupational surname for a priest, and it comes from the Hebrew word kohen. Traditionally, priests were considered to have been members of a hereditary caste, descended from Aaron, the brother of Moses. Not all Jewish bearers of the surname Kuhn belong to this caste, however. When many Jews were being forced to join the Russian Army for a term of 25 years, a number of them changed their last name to Kuhn, because members of the clergy were exempt from service.\n\nKuhn Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Kuhn is the 1,269th most popular surname with an estimated 24,870 people with that name. 1 However, in France, the name Kuhn is ranked the 1,365th most popular surname with an estimated 4,179 people with that name. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nKuhn migration to the United States +\n\nSome of the first settlers of this family name were:\n\nKuhn Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nConrad Kuhn, who arrived in New York in 1709 3\n\nMattheus Kuhn, who landed in New York in 1709-1710 3\n\nValentine Kuhn, who landed in New York, NY in 1710-1714 3\n\nAbraham Kuhn, who landed in Pennsylvania in 1733 3\n\nCasper Kuhn, who arrived in Carolina in 1739 3\n\n...
