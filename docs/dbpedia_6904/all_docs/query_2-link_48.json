        "text": "A Hungarian Assignment Algorithm is an assignment algorithm that is a combinatorial optimization algorithm.\n\nAKA: Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm.\n\nContext:\n\nIt can be applied by a Hungarian Assignment-based System (to solve a linear assignment task).\n\nSee: Combinatorial Optimization, Polynomial Time, Primal-Dual Method, Assignment Task.\n\nReferences\n\n2014\n\n(Wikipedia, 2014) ⇒ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm Retrieved:2014-8-22.\n\nThe Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time and which anticipated later primal-dual methods. It was developed and published by Harold Kuhn in 1955, who gave the name \"Hungarian method\" because the algorithm was largely based on the earlier works of two Hungarian mathematicians: Dénes Kőnig and Jenő Egerváry.[1] [2]\n\nJames Munkres reviewed the algorithm in 1957 and observed that it is (strongly) polynomial.[3] Since then the algorithm has been known also as Kuhn–Munkres algorithm or Munkres assignment algorithm. The time complexity of the original algorithm was [math]\\displaystyle{ O(n^4) }[/math], however Edmonds and Karp, and independently Tomizawa noticed that it can be modified to achieve an [math]\\displaystyle{ O(n^3) }[/math] running time. Ford and Fulkerson extended the method to general transportation problems. In 2006, it was discovered that Carl Gustav Jacobi had solved the assignment problem in the 19th century, and the solution had been published posthumously in 1890 in Latin. [4]\n\n↑ Harold W.

While it is possible to solve any of these problems using the simplex algorithm, each specialization has more efficient algorithms designed to take advantage of its special structure. If the cost function involves quadratic inequalities it is called the quadratic assignment problem.\n\n1955\n\n(Kuhn, 1955) ⇒ Harold W. Kuhn.
