        "text": "Marguerite Frank described her discovery of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in the video 'Marguerite Frank - Inventor of the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm - Honorary Discussion Panel' (6 March 2014) at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24e08AX9Eww.\n\nThis Discussion Panel was part of the workshop on \"Greedy Algorithms, Frank-Wolfe and Friends - A modern perspective\" held at Lake Tahoe, Nevada in 2013. In OPTIMA 95: Mathematical Optimization Society Newsletter, there are several articles written after the workshop and, in particular, there is one by Marguerite Frank giving more details than in the interview itself. We present a version of this article, together with the preceding ones putting it into context.\n\n1. Note from the Editors.\n\nMartin Jaggi (ETH ZÃ¼rich) and Zaid Harchaoui (INRIA Grenoble) jointly with Federico Pierucci organised a workshop on \"Greedy Algorithms, Frank-Wolfe and Friends - A modern perspective\" at the annual conference of the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation in 2013 (NIPS 2013) at Lake Tahoe, Nevada. On that occasion they had the chance to interview Marguerite Frank about the invention of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm she developed together with Philip Wolfe in the 1950's. We are very happy to have a column in this issue in which she shares with us her memories on this important moment in the history of mathematical optimisation dating back some 60 years. How influential her's and Philip Wolfe's invention was can be seen also from the scientific article in this issue, in which Martin Jaggi and Zaid Harchaoui describe recent successful applications of the method.\n\nWe hope that you will enjoy both the historical and the current aspects of this issue ...\n\n2. Preluding Remarks, by Martin Jaggi and Zaid Harchaoui.\n\nIn 1956, Marguerite Frank and Philip Wolfe published a paper entitled \"An Algorithm for Quadratic Programming\" in Naval Research Logistics Quarterly. The paper's title was a strong understatement, given that it introduces a new algorithm not only for quadratic convex, but general convex optimisation, and proves the O(1t)O(\\large\\frac{1}{t}\\normalsize )O(t1â) convergence rate. The Frank-Wolfe algorithm is widely considered the very first method for general constrained convex optimisation.\n\nOriginating in the famous Logistics Project group at Princeton, which was the most prominent place in linear programming and game theory at the time, the new collaboration between Marguerite Frank and Phil Wolfe (both coming from quite different scientific backgrounds) aimed at the following research question: Given the recent successes and tools of linear programming, is it possible to derive a method for the more general case, that is quadratic convex programming, or even general convex programming? The answer is well known to the reader at this point, and in our opinion marks some of the birth hours of the research field of convex optimisation, and a significant and brave departure from the linear programming territory.\n\nSince then, the powerful core idea of the Frank-Wolfe method - to decompose a (hard) general optimisation problem into a sequence of (easy) linear problems - has proven fertile numerous times in a surprisingly large variety of applications, and is continuing to have impact in many fields.\n\nWe feel extremely honoured that Marguerite Frank, co-author of the original paper, and one of the first female PhD students in mathematics at Harvard University, has agreed to share her thoughts on these interesting birth years of mathematical optimisation.\n\nWe would also like to thank Hallie Wolfe, P Wolfe's wife, and Isabelle Frank, M Frank's daughter, and Anna Nagurney for their constant kindness and generous help in preparing this article. We are indebted to the editors of Optima, Volker Kaibel, Sam Burer, Jeff Linderoth and Katya Scheinberg for many valuable comments, as well as to Alexandre d'Aspremont, Rob Freund, Anatoli Juditsky, Simon Lacoste-Julien, Claude LemarÃ©chal and Arkadi Nemirovski for fruitful discussions.\n\n3.
