American Psychiatric Association Publishing, Arlington, VA, 2018, 381 pages.\n\nIn 1969, Michael Crichton, MD, the author of Andromeda Strain, and future author of Jurassic Park, was the first Harvard Medical School (HMS) medical student to rotate through the Logan International Airport–Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Medical Station telemedicine program and write a book chapter about it. His first nonfiction book “Five Patients: The Hospital Explained” is the book in which HMS senior student Crichton tracked five patients he encountered at the MGH, including one telemedicine patient. The book became a popular success and was an alternative book club selection. Crichton's book provides a rare first-person account of a Harvard medical student's initial exposure to several then-futuristic medical innovations, including computer-enabled, automated patient history taking and telemedicine (then called telediagnostics), during his own medical school 4th-year clinical rotations. This was in the late 1960s, a half century ago. Crichton left medicine upon graduation from HMS. He never practiced medicine, but went on to become a famous science fiction writer and movie director. Nevertheless, Crichton retained his interest in progress in medical science throughout his life.\n\nIn his “Five Patients: The Hospital Explained” book, Crichton recounts his telemedicine patient encounter with a Logan Airport traveler, as a medical student stationed 2.7 miles away in the MGH Telediagnosis Center on the first floor of the White Building on the MGH campus, in remarkable detail. Crichton's telemedicine patient, Mrs. Sylvia Thompson, was a passenger flying from Los Angeles to Boston when she developed chest pain while in the air over Ohio flying east. Upon landing, she walked to the Logan Airport MGH Medical Station walk-in clinic near Gate 23 and was examined in the Teleconsultation Room at the Medical Station by a telephysician located at the MGH 2.7 miles away. At the end of her telemedicine physical examination, Mrs. Thompson exclaimed, “My goodness. It was just like the real thing.” Her immortal words, uttered at the Logan Airport walk-in clinic, were likely repeated by millions of new telemedicine patients a half century later during the COVID-19 public health emergency as health care providers rushed to utilize telemedicine as a means to continue providing health care to their patients while leveraging telemedicine's inherent social distancing to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nFollowing the rendering of her provisional diagnosis of pneumonia by a telephysician at the MGH in Boston, Mrs. Thompson was transported to the MGH for X-rays and treated for pneumonia following confirmation of her diagnosis by X-ray examination. It is interesting that television microscopy, the forerunner to modern telepathology, was available at the Logan Airport MGH Medical Station from the start of their telemedicine program in April 1968. Teleradiology became available at the MGH Medical Station over a year later. A decade of prior experience by television microscopy research investigators had validated the video microscopy technology. Television microscopy was ready for immediate implementation in clinical practice.\n\nCrichton expands on his medical student telemedicine patient experience with a remarkably insightful consideration of a series of futuristic medical service innovations that would leverage leading-edge technologies, including private telecommunications networks, telemedicine, computers, and even AI. Based upon his acknowledgments in his book “Five Patients,” it is likely that Crichton, the soon-to-be best-selling science fiction writer Michael Crichton, had extracted nuggets of sophisticated information from a series of personal interviews with leading, senior faculty members at the MGH and at MIT across the Charles River from the MGH campus. It is likely that some of these high-profile interviews had been arranged by Dr. John H. Knowles, the General Director at the MGH. Crichton, already a legendary summa cum laude graduate from Harvard College, whose reputation as a brilliant undergraduate student preceded him at HMS, had the instincts of an investigative reporter, which he had acquired from his journalist father at a young age. The younger Crichton had published his first article, one on travel, in the New York Times at age 14, and as a physically imposing 26-year-old, Crichton cut an extraordinary figure.\n\nAs a footnote to history, Weinstein, the coauthor of this article, and Michael Crichton were contemporaries at the MGH during their training. Although Weinstein was four academic grades ahead of Crichton, they were MGH trainees at overlapping periods of time in the late 1960s (1968–1969). Weinstein vividly remembers seeing the towering, 6-foot 9-inch Michael Crichton strolling through the MGH corridors accompanied by a relatively young, and equally charismatic, 5-foot 8-inch MGH General Director, John H. Knowles, MD. Dr. Knowles was an early proponent for telemedicine. Crichton and Knowles were seen either walking together or having lunch in the MGH employee cafeteria many times. Weinstein recalls seeing them engrossed in serious discussions: an HMS medical student and the youthful hospital director, Crichton and Knowles, a Socratic pairing always acting out in public, face-to-face, despite their striking differences in physical stature. They were a memorable pair to observe in person, even at a distance. High energy appeared to flow naturally between the two of them.\n\nRashid L. Bashshur and Gary W. Shannon's “History of Telemedicine” is the product of meticulous scholarship by a pair of accomplished historians who display a special talent for explaining the complex interrelationships between people, events, and technologies. Bashshur is more than a historian. He has been professionally immersed in telemedicine since the 1960s, arguably longer than almost anyone else alive today. He has chronicled major events in the field in real-time, up close and personal, while authoring a significant part of the analytical literature on many facets of this complex health care delivery field with a “who's who in the field” panel of collaborators. Bashshur and Shannon's particular interest in public policy is reflected in their insightful descriptions of societal influences on the jerky progression of the implementation of telemedicine, particularly in North America, over half a century. The recent surge in COVID-19 pandemic-related, telemedicine case activity becomes understandable in terms of the decades-long deadweight influences of policy on earlier efforts by an army of workers to implement telemedicine and take it to scale.\n\nThe first half of the book is a detailed recounting of the adaptations of groundbreaking technical innovations for uses of telemedicine in health care, dating back literally to the Trojan War. Much of the more recent history is told against the backdrop of the birth and expansion of a new nation. The descriptions of innumerable events and activities are often riveting and even majestic. There is great precision to the story telling, which adds to its credibility. Bashshur and Shannon shift gears in the second half of the book by focusing the second half of the book on the modern era of telemedicine in the United States (1950–2009) and, to a greater extent than in the first half of their book, on the influences of public policy on telemedicine adoption and expansion. They carefully select model programs to illustrate specific points, such as roles for government in creating successful telemedicine programs.\n\nA limitation of Bashshur and Shannon's “History of Telemedicine” is its under-reporting of telemedicine studies published in foreign language journals. Sponsorship of the book by the US National Library of Medicine may have played a role in limiting the scope of the book. It is noteworthy that there is a wealth of telemedicine and telehealth information in many foreign language journals. This is published in abundance in publications of the International Society of Telemedicine and Telehealth. Their publication reference citations and titles are dual published in the foreign language of origin and also in English translations.\n\nFor a greater international perspective on the development of telemedicine around the world, check out “A Century of Telemedicine: Curatio Sine Distantia et Tempora,” edited by Anton Vladzymyrskyy, Malina Jordanova, and Frank Lievens and published in 2016. This book is more of a survey than a history, and it is quite narrowly focused on technologies. The book's six chapters' titles include telecommunications, videoconferencing, telecardiology, biotelemetry, computational telediagnosis, and satellite technologies. Although titled in two languages, the detailed text is written entirely in English.\n\n“Century of Telemedicine” is profusely illustrated. It is fun to see page after page of thumb-nail sized pictures illuminating many surprises, not the least of which is how many other countries have had telemedicine-related developments for decades. Unlike Bashshur and Shannon's “History of Telemedicine,” there is barely any description of national health care systems, societal priorities, or telemedicine applications that have gone mainstream. We now know that was by design since “Century of Telemedicine” has been followed up with a three-volume set of books specifically on over a dozen individual national telemedicine programs (see below). This tends to debunk the popular US notion that “telemedicine started here!”\n\n“Century of Telemedicine” also includes an extensive interesting Appendix (called an Afterword) listing short bibliographies for historic participants in telemedicine programs. Included are descriptions and photographs for a large sampling of participants in telemedicine from the United States and Canada. Coverage is uneven and the criteria for inclusion are not stated. There are many obvious omissions.\n\n“Century of Telemedicine” is a product of the International Society for Telemedicine and Telehealth (ISfT). ISfT was officially founded in 1997 after several failed starts at several international meetings. The ISfT was officially registered in Basel, Switzerland, in 1997, with its Coordinating Office presently in Belgium.\n\nDr. Weinstein, coauthor of this article, delivered the opening lecture at the “First International Conference on the Medical Aspects of Telemedicine,” held in Tromsø, Norway, in May 1993. This is where the seed was planted for ISfT. Dr. Weinstein gave the opening keynote address at the Tromsø Conference, on the topic, “Telemedicine in the United States.” The Conference Chair acknowledged Dr. Weinstein's invention of robotic telepathology in 1986 and its successful implementation in northern Norway, above the Arctic Circle, 3 years later. Because of this, Dr. Weinstein was well known in the European pathology community. His invention had been successfully implemented by Tromsø University Hospital pathologists as an enabling telemedicine technology that supported intraoperative frozen section diagnosis at Kirkenes Hospital, 400 km to the east. This was over a two-way E1 2 megabit per second landline, the European version of a US carrier T1 1.5 megabit per second landline.\n\nISfT was renamed the International Society for Telemedicine and eHealth (ISfTeH) in 2005. Today, there are 90 countries participating in ISfTeH. The organization has robust education and publication programs. Its publications are authoritative and of generally high quality.\n\nIn retrospect, the original “A Century of Telemedicine” book now serves as an introductory book for a set of ISfTeH-endorsed books covering telemedicine programs in individual countries. The three books in this new series provide detailed descriptions of telemedicine programs in 16 countries: Book 1 (Australia, Brazil, Czech Republic, India, Nigeria, and Russia); Book 2 (Chile, Finland, Georgia, Japan, Peru, and United States); and Book 3 (Bolivia, Denmark, Iran, and Poland). The chapter on the United States in Book 2 is telenurse oriented and may disappoint physicians. Generally, comparisons of the telemedicine programs in individual countries, by the reader, might show how different national and cultural points of view influence countries' development and implementation of telemedicine and telehealth services. Each country has its own attitudes toward the well-being of its citizens. This can be reflected in the structures and functions of their telemedicine programs. However, such comparisons are somewhat complicated by the diversity of professions of the authors of the chapters (medical doctors and nurses, etc.). It would be helpful of ISfTeH to add a fourth book to the series, authored by a panel of experts assigned the task of analyzing the chapters describing telemedicine and telehealth in 16 individual countries and of identifying and discussing common threads. This ISfTeH global telemedicine book series calls out for analyses, and discussion, by authorities with a broad international perspective.\n\nA fifth ISfTeH-endorsed telemedicine book is a special gem. This 72-page “Atlas of the Telemedicine History,” published in 2013, contains many rare historical photos of early telemedicine pioneers and their programs from, literally, around the world. This is an outstanding, historical picture gallery.\n\nPDFs for these ISfTeH-promoted books are available, for free, at the ISfTeH webpage.1\n\nCurrently, there is a crescendo of interest in potential telemedicine and telehealth textbooks, worldwide. In the United States, schools, ranging from community and undergraduate colleges to a wide range of graduate schools, will be offering telehealth courses this year for the first time. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be functioning as an innovation accelerator in the distance education industry.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the United States, telemedicine caseloads in medical practices have increased at astronomical rates, not infrequently exceeding 3,000–6,000% for many medical practices in the United States. The vast majority of US practitioners had no telemedicine in their medical school training. Many office practices went from zero telemedicine cases to 1,000s of telemedicine cases per month in a matter of a month or two.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges, which oversees medical student education in the United States, has announced an urgent need to generate core competencies for medical students in virtual care, telemedicine, and telehealth. Other categories of health care profession schools have overlapping needs. A race is on to identify telehealth textbooks best suited to address trainees' needs. Potential contenders, already on the market, are worth mentioning.\n\nRichard Wootton, John Craig, and Victor Patterson's second edition of their “Introduction to Telemedicine” was published in 2017. The book's 17 contributors are drawn from five different countries on three continents. This reflects R. Wootton's extraordinary reach as an international authority on telemedicine. The second edition of Wootton's “Introduction to Telemedicine” lends itself to being a quick read for medical students or even practicing physicians who are exploring telemedicine for the first time. One drawback to using Wootton's “Introduction to Telemedicine” is that many of the pictures and figures are holdovers from the first edition and need updating.\n\nWootton's “Introduction to Telemedicine,” published by RMS Press, was designed to serve as a general introduction for what became a seven-book series of specialty telemedicine books. His “Introduction to Telemedicine” can be used either as a stand-alone textbook for an introductory telemedicine course or in combination with Wootton's advanced topic textbooks for multisemester courses. The introductory medical specialty books in Wootton's seven-book collection cover specific telemedicine applications, including telepsychiatry, telepediatrics, teleneurology, and teledermatology, quite well, but need updating.\n\nThe publication of “Understanding Telehealth,” edited by Karen S. Rheuban and Elizabeth A. Krupinski, was a major event for the telemedicine and telehealth industry. For the sake of disclosure, Dr. Krupinski and Dr. Weinstein have been colleagues and close collaborators since 1992.\n\nThat being said, Rheuban and Krupinski's book is brilliantly conceived and masterfully executed by any measure. “Understanding Telehealth” consists of 24 chapters, authored by 46 experts in the telemedicine field. Telehealth, per se, which is inclusive of telemedicine, is well represented. Chapter titles range from “Telehealth in Pediatric Cardiology” to “Legal and Regulatory Issues.” Despite their breadth of subject matter coverage, individual chapters are remarkably uniform with respect to the breadth of coverage of individual topics and their readability.\n\nIn addition to providing essential foundational information for a broad swath of health care workers new to telemedicine, Rheuban and Krupinski's “Understanding Telehealth” seamlessly kernels in what amounts to select up-to-date microreviews on a broad range of current topics of interest.\n\n“Understanding Telehealth” is highly recommended for a broad spectrum of learners and professionals, including nonmedical staff, medical, nursing, and pharmacy students, residents, medical practitioners, public health officials, and C-suite health care executives, seeking updates on the issues of the day. “Understanding Telehealth” might not be a suitable textbook for a college Gen Ed course or an introductory course in an allied health profession curriculum.\n\nCurrently, “Understanding Telehealth” is the telemedicine reference book of choice for our staff members at the Arizona Telemedicine Program. In addition, in our experience, some sophisticated patients and their advocates might find sections of the book worth reading. Finally, one can imagine that healthcare portfolio managers at financial institutions would be interested in diving into “Understanding Telehealth” with their eyes wide open. There is a great deal of information they will find worth mining in light of so many investment opportunities in telemedicine and telehealth these days! Outstanding nonfiction books such as this can generate large readerships.\n\nMy ideal telemedicine and telehealth textbook for undergraduate college students remains to be written. Frankly, if I had access to a suggestion box, this textbook would be a generalized version of Peter Yellowlees and Jay H Shore's “Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies: A Guide for Mental Health Professionals.” Book collectors do get to fantasize and, occasionally, dreams do come true. Although marketed as a telepsychiatry book, which it is, much of the information in “Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies: A Guide for Mental Health Professionals” is not psychiatry specific and could be of value to students planning careers in nearly every sector of the health care industry. In general, according to our analysis of the book, nonpsychiatry information in the book could be carved out and repackaged as a general textbook on telemedicine and telehealth that could be outstanding. That might be of great immediate use to faculties at US medical schools, and undergraduate colleges, which are in urgent need of a high quality, US-centric, general telemedicine textbook because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We can see how a revised, generalized, and shortened version of “Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies: A Guide for Mental Health Professionals” could fit that bill.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Yellowlees and Shore's strategy of developing their model textbook is clearly stated on the first page of their preface. This could be replicated by others willing to take the time to do so. Instead of giving recruited authors free reign in selecting their designated chapter's subject matter and then simply assembling their chapters, as is often the case, Yellowlees and Shore “initially mapped out the book down to the section headings…and then selected colleagues to write the various sections of the book based on their individual expertise and knowledge.” There it is! That is the way to do it. Their product is an excellent textbook for a course on telemedicine, created by master educators and executed in partnership with a team of carefully selected high-quality scholar educators willing to follow their coeditor's directions. For the medical reader, telepsychiatry becomes a metaphor for a broad spectrum of medical specialties."
