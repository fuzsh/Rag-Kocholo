        "text": "Johann Conrad Kühn, son of Georg Heinrich and Maria Margaretha Kühn, was born in Semd on 13 June and baptized 15 June 1727. Elisabetha Margaretha Mohr, daughter of Hieronÿmy and Maria Catharina Mohr was born 17 August and baptized 20 August 1728. Conrad and Elisabetha Margaretha married on 25 February 1755. They had five children, all born in Semd: Eva Elisabetha, born 4 October, baptized 5 October 1755; Johann Heinrich, born 19 February, baptized 20 February 1757; Helena, born 15 September, baptized 16 September 1759; Johann Nicolaus, born 7 September, baptized 17 September 1762; and Johann Michael, born 23 May, baptized 25 May 1764.\n\nThe couple and their four oldest children arrived in Russia on 31 July 1766. Johann Conrad does not appear in any published First Settler's List. It appears that he must have died during the journey to the villages, and Elisabetha Margaretha married Philipp Koch. She and the children are reported in Household #15 on the Frank 1767 Census.\n\nOn the 1798 Census, Johann Heinrich and his mother Elisabetha Margaretha are reported in Frank Family #38, Eva Elisabeth is reported in Family #68, and Johann Nicolaus is reported in Family #127."
