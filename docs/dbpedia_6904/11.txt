Kuhn History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms

Origins Available:

Germany

Israel

The distinguished surname Kuhn is a proud sign of an ancient Jewish culture. The surname Kuhn is an occupational surname for a priest, and it comes from the Hebrew word kohen. Traditionally, priests were considered to have been members of a hereditary caste, descended from Aaron, the brother of Moses. Not all Jewish bearers of the surname Kuhn belong to this caste, however. When many Jews were being forced to join the Russian Army for a term of 25 years, a number of them changed their last name to Kuhn, because members of the clergy were exempt from service.
