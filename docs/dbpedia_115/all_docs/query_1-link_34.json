        "text": "If someone asked you, “What month do you think has the most births in Australia?”, what would you say? If you guessed August (as this author did), you’d be wrong.\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, September is the most popular month for births in Australia. September 17th had the highest number of births recorded in Australia over a 10-year period, and three September dates make up the top five most common birth dates overall!\n\nGiven how many September babies there seem to be, it’s definitely important for us to talk about what the September birth flower is. Read on to learn more about September birth flowers (yes, there’s more than one!) and their meanings.\n\nAster\n\nOur first September birth flower is the humble aster. Once thought of as sacred but now more commonly (and unfairly) thought of as somewhat of a weed, there’s a lot more to this dainty, daisy-like bloom than meets the eye.\n\nThe history of the aster flower\n\nThe name “aster” comes from the Greek word asteri, meaning “star”. It’s definitely a fitting name for these little flowers, given their star-shaped heads. But the ties to Greece don’t end there!\n\nAsters were once believed to be sacred to the Gods. The ancient Greeks and Romans would lay aster flowers upon altars dedicated to gods and goddesses.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the goddess Astraea is said to have wept because there weren’t enough stars in the sky. Where her tears fell to Earth, asters sprouted—like pretty little stars—from the ground.\n\nIn mediaeval times, it was believed that burning aster flowers would ward off evil spirits and serpents.\n\nAsters have been used medicinally in China and elsewhere to treat a range of ailments, and have been the inspiration for many artists throughout history, including Claude Monet.\n\nIn the Hungarian Revolution of 1918, protesters donned aster flowers on their person, leading to the movement becoming known as The Aster Revolution.\n\nThat’s a lot of history for one tiny flower!\n\nAre asters the same as daisies?\n\nAsters are often mistaken for daisies. Though they may look similar, asters and daisies are actually two different types of flower. They do, however, belong to the same family: Asteraceae.\n\nSunflowers, chrysanthemums, dahlias, gerberas, marigolds, dandelions, zinnias and chamomile flowers all belong to the Asteraceae family, too! You can see their similarities just by looking at them.\n\nWhat might surprise you, though, is that lettuce, globe artichokes and chicory (yes, like the kinds you put in salads) also belong to the Asteraceae family.\n\nWhat do asters symbolise?\n\nHistorically, the aster flower has held a variety of meanings, from daintiness to patience to wisdom to faith.\n\nThe most common colour of aster is purple with a yellow centre, but they also come with pink and white petals. These different coloured petals carry different symbolic meanings.\n\nWhite asters symbolise purity\n\nIn a similar vein to white roses and other white blooms, white asters symbolise purity, innocence and loyalty. They’re lovely as part of a wedding, sympathy or new baby bouquet.\n\nPurple asters symbolise wisdom\n\nPurple is said to be the colour of royalty, so it’s fitting that purple asters should represent royalty and wisdom. Purple asters are perfect for gifting to a person you hold in high esteem, or to someone undertaking studies or who’s graduating.\n\nRed and pink asters symbolise devotion\n\nThe aster flower has been a symbol of devotion since antiquity. Today, pink and especially red asters are given as symbols of deep, undying love.\n\nIf your partner has a September birthday, a bouquet that features red or pink asters would be perfect for expressing your love for them. Red or pink asters are also perfect filler flowers for grander Valentine’s Day or anniversary bouquets.\n\nWhen do asters bloom in Australia?\n\nAsters are stars (pun intended) of the late summer to autumn garden. This is great news for pollinators like bees and butterflies, because when spring flowers lose their bloom asters are still around late in the season to provide nutrients.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, September is exactly the time of year you’d expect to see asters in bloom. But in Australia, you’ll find asters flowering naturally from around February into April and May, typically around Easter time. For this reason, asters are also known as Easter daisies!\n\nOf course, Easter time is a long time way away from September. Fortunately, greenhouse production means asters are virtually available all year round.\n\nAsters last up to ten days in a vase once cut, so they make great, long-lasting additions to floral arrangements.\n\nMorning Glory\n\nThe second September birth flower is morning glory. This lyrical name reflects the flower’s tendency to bloom early in the morning, and then close again by the end of the day.\n\nDespite this, some varieties of morning glory actually prefer to flower at night! The moonflower, for example, blossoms in the evening and then closes again around midday the following day.\n\nMorning glories make charming additions to home gardens, giving them a country cottage vibe. They grow in creeping vines, which sprawl across the ground, over trellises and along fences. They grow so well and so quickly that in fact, morning glory has become somewhat of an invasive weed in Australia.\n\nFun fact: The sweet potato is part of the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae.\n\nThe history of morning glory\n\nThe morning glory flower was important in ancient Mesoamerican cultures, like the Aztecs and the Mayans. Aztec priests are known to have used the hallucinogenic properties of the flower’s seeds to go on vision quests and to communicate with the gods.\n\nIn ancient China, the flower was also used for medicinal purposes.\n\nWhat do morning glories symbolise?\n\nMorning glories have come to symbolise a number of different things throughout history.\n\nMorning glory as a symbol of human resilience and mortality\n\nMorning glory is a somewhat tragic flower, blooming and “dying” all in one day. It grows and thrives in harsh conditions, and always rises again in the morning.\n\nFor these reasons, morning glory has become a pretty poetic symbol of human resilience and the fleeting nature of this life.\n\nThe different states of the morning glory flower are also said to represent the various stages of human life. In morning bud they represent youth, in full bloom at daytime they represent adulthood and as they wilt in the evenings, they represent the later stages of life.\n\nMorning glory as a symbol of love\n\nIn many cultures throughout history, the morning glory flower has had some association with love and affection. Sometimes, they represent an unyielding love that can overcome all challenges, and at other times they’ve been known to symbolise unrequited love.\n\nMorning glory meanings by colour\n\nAs with all flowers, morning glories can have different symbolic meanings depending on their colour.\n\nWhite morning glories are symbols of purity and innocence, as is the case with many white blooms.\n\nPink morning glories symbolise love and gratitude, while red morning glories symbolise deep and passionate love.\n\nLike many purple flowers, purple morning glory symbolises royalty, while blue morning glory symbolises honesty, respect and trust.\n\nWhen do morning glories bloom in Australia?\n\nMorning glory thrives in full sun and warmth, flowering from late spring, throughout summer and into early autumn.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, this would mean September would just fall within morning glory’s flowering season. In Australia, there's a chance you may find morning glory blooming in September, but only if the conditions are warm and sunny.\n\nMorning glory is not often used in floristry. This is partly because morning glories don't last long once cut from the vine.\n\nIf you’re looking to give a September friend (or anyone, really) the gift of morning glory flowers, you may need to pick a few blooms from a garden or from the sand by the beach, but don’t be disappointed if they wilt within a day or so!\n\nForget-Me-Not\n\nLucky Septemberians get a bonus flower! In Britain, the forget-me-not is sometimes thought of as a September birth flower, alongside aster and morning glory. These pretty little blooms are predominantly blue, but they may also appear pink or white.\n\nThe forget-me-not has always held romantic symbolism, representing true love and faithfulness.\n\nUnlike asters and morning glories, forget-me-nots bloom naturally from early spring to summer, so you are more likely to find these petite petals in bloom around September in Australia.\n\nAustralian native September birth flower: Geraldton Wax\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, we have Geraldton Wax. Though perhaps not thought of as a birth flower anywhere else in the world, Geraldton Wax is the Australian native birth flower of September.\n\nGeraldton Wax, also called waxflower, is endemic to Western Australia and grows naturally from autumn to the end of spring.\n\nThe petals most commonly come in shades of white, pink and red. Once cut, wax will generally last 7 to 12 days in a vase, making them a great, long-lasting addition to floral arrangements.\n\nWhat does Geraldton Wax symbolise?\n\nWaxflowers are symbolic of good fortune, happiness and enduring love. For this reason, they often feature in wedding bouquets—good thing they bloom right around wedding season!\n\nYou really can’t go wrong giving someone a bouquet that features Geraldton wax, whether they’re born in September or not.\n\nWe love waxflowers here at Floraly, and you’ll find them in a number of our bouquets throughout the year. These may include our best-selling natives bunch or seasonal bouquets and posies like The Wanda, The Mel, The Remi and The Lilah.\n\n***\n\nWith so many September birthdays, it’s only fitting that we be spoilt for choice in terms of September birth flowers!\n\nAsters, morning glories, forget-me-nots and waxflowers are all beautiful and meaningful in their own right, but they take on extra special meaning when given to our September-born friends and family.\n\nWhen you go the extra mile to gift a loved one a bouquet that features their birth flower, they’re guaranteed to love it all the more!\n\nIf you're looking to send birthday flowers in September, explore our range via the button below."
