        "text": "Hi everyone ,I am not sure why my initial post was removed. We have decided to move to Edmonton from Calgary .we both have jobs and can work from our Edmonton office hybrid. spouse also have the option to work full time from home, so commute is not an issue for us.\n\nWe cook most of our meals and only use restaurants only on few occasions. we spend most of our time at home and don't mind driving long distance for amenities as i love driving.\n\nSince we spend most of our time at home , we are looking at getting the most possible comfortable home we could afford. We are considering new or something not more than 7 years old in the newer communities. We are not interested in infills or older communities\n\nMy main concerns are community / quadrant desirability and safety . School for the kids is not much of concern.\n\nFrom a few people and a realtor i spoke to , they all seem to mention that the south ( newer communities ) outside of Anthony Henday Orchards , Chapel Charles worth , Aster , Allard, Glenriding etc. ( ,are the most desirable and prestigious, followed by the west ( The Uplands , Still water , Edgemont, Secord etc. The far north are the least recommended ( crystalina , Mcconachie , CY becker , Frazer etc ).\n\nIs There a reason why the far north(after 153rd ave ) were always least recommended/less respected/ valued ? All my research shows the communities in the far north are safe as well or is it just the mind set of Edmontonians?\n\nI found that there are better deals in the far north.\n\nIf you know what you know now before choosing the community you bought in the \"Newer communities \" and considering my main concerns , between the deep south , far north and west , where would you choose to buy and why?"
