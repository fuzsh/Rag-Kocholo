        "text": "Boulevard gardens are often referred to as “hellstrips” because they present challenging conditions to gardeners and plants alike. However, that little patch of lawn in-between the sidewalk and road should not be overlooked as a viable site for growing, and saving our wildlife with, native plants. In this article we will discuss the benefits of growing native plants in your boulevard instead of lawn.\n\nClick here to jump straight to the plant list.\n\nBenefits of boulevard gardens:\n\nYear-long natural beauty\n\nLet’s face it - Lawn is boring. Native plants can produce a stunning display of colour and interest in your boulevard all year round.\n\nReduced maintenance\n\nOnce a native boulevard garden is established, it will require far less maintenance than the lawn that was there initially (plus, it won’t go an ugly brown colour during droughts). Unlike lawn, properly chosen plants won’t require supplemental watering or fertilizer to look nice. Plus, you get out of having to mow the grass!\n\nPollinator habitat\n\nLawn does very little to support beneficial wildlife such as pollinators. By trading your boulevard grass for native plants, you can help restore lost and degraded habitat for pollinators. Even the smallest garden can help!\n\nEnvironmental education\n\nIn urban areas, lawn seems to be a default landscaping option. By planting a native garden in your boulevard, you can show your neighbours that they too can choose a more eco-friendly option than lawn. You can help educate the further by including habitat signs.\n\nHow to Design a Boulevard Garden\n\nCheck your local bylaws! Every city/town has different rules so you need to check with yours to make sure you are allowed to plant a garden in the boulevard. Some cities require permits and have height restrictions.\n\nBefore you dig, ensure there are no buried utilities.\n\nKeep it short. Tall, floppy plants not only look messy in such a small, narrow garden but, more importantly, can cause safety hazards if they are blocking sight-lines. Aim for plants under 1m in height.\n\nIn addition, it may be a good idea to leave a 1 foot wide section of grass or mulch in-between the garden and sidewalk to keep pedestrians from tripping, or stepping, on your plants.\n\nAvoid woody plants - Snow will need to be piled up on boulevards so keep this free of woody vegetation that will get in the way.\n\nBe prepared to move plants if the city needs to dig up the bed for maintenance work.\n\nFavor a more formal planting - Boulevard gardens and native plants are a new concept to people (neighbours) with more traditional garden views. While there is nothing wrong with a more natural (wild) look, it may be better to plant the garden more formally to help it be accepted by neighbours who might not be fully on board with a native plant garden instead of grass.\n\nSlightly lower the center of the garden to ensure that soil doesn’t wash off into the sidewalk.\n\nConsider adding a formal pathway through your garden. This will help stop people from walking through your plants.\n\nWhat to Plant in Boulevard Gardens\n\nNative Boulevard plants must be able to thrive in a variety of harsh growing conditions including:\n\nDrought\n\nCompacted soil\n\nUrban pollution\n\nFoot traffic\n\nRoad-salt\n\nFortunately, many of Ontario’s native plants have evolved to withstand harsh conditions and will actually grow quite well in your boulevard.\n\nThe conditions found between every boulevard garden will vary, so be sure to do research on which of the following plants will do best in your particular site. Remember: native plants are only low maintenance if we choose appropriate species for our site conditions.\n\nYou may notice that many of the wildflowers mentioned in this article can be found growing along roadsides. These plants are exceptionally suitable for boulevard gardens because they are naturally growing in similar conditions found in boulevard gardens."
