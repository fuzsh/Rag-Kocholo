        "text": "In the spring, I’m thinking about planting natives in an area of my garden. I’m doing this to try an increase the biodiversity in my yard. However, I have a couple of questions about doing this.\n\nHow do I obtain native plants? Is it bad to collect plants from the wild?\n\nAre weedy natives a good choice (ex. woodsorrel and ragweed)? It seems like they might take over an area given the opportunity.\n\nWhat are some good plants to grow in New England? Unfortunately, I can’t grow trees or large shrubs.\n\nThank you in advance for the responses.\n\nYou should not collect plants from the wild. However, seed collection can be done. HOWEVER, it is very important that you have the appropriate permission/permits from the land owner/manager and that you collect in an ethical way. I highly suggest reading through this PDF from The Xerces Society. There is undoubtedly a Native Plant Society for your state. Look them up. They will have a code of ethics to follow for seed collection. Many times they will have seeds/plants available, so you may not even need to collect.\n\nResearch every species before you collect/purchase seeds. As a note, ragweed is likely not a good choice as it causes hay fever.\n\nCheck out the native plant finders from The Audubon Society and The National Wildlife Federation. Additionally, the Facebook group Gardening with Native Plants may be of interest to you.\n\nOk, here are some suggestions. Not all of these will be easily bought at garden nurseries, but they might show up. Also, I know these are native to Massachusetts, but I’m not certain they are all native to Rhode Island.\n\nThese prefer slightly damp sites, but they will probably do fine in shade with some mulching:\n\nNorthern Maidenhair Fern, Adiantum pedatum\n\nWild Ginger, Asarum canadense\n\nJack-in-the-Pulpit, Arisaema triphyllum\n\nBellworts, Uvularia grandiflora, U. perfoliata, U. sessisilifolia\n\nCanada Lily, Lilium canadense\n\nCucumber Root, Medeola virginiana\n\nTrilliums, T. cernuum, T. erectum, T. undulatum\n\nCanada Mayflower, Maianthemum canadense\n\nSolomon’s Plume, M. racemosum\n\nAmerican Spikenard, Aralia racemosa\n\nGolden Alexanders, Zizia aurea (Z. aptera might be native in RI also?)\n\nWhite Wood Aster, Eurybia divaricata\n\nBlue Cohoshes, Caulophyllum giganteum, C. thalictroides\n\nCardinal Flower, Lobelia cardinalis - this is likely to be short-lived, but it is glorious when it flowers\n\nWild Geranium, Geranium maculatum\n\nSquirrel-corn and Dutchman’s-breeches, Dicentra canadensis and cucullaria\n\nBloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis\n\nBaneberries, Actaea pachypoda, A. rubra\n\nWild Columbine, Aquilegia canadensis - likely to be short-lived, but sometimes it re-seeds itself\n\nFoamflower, Tiarella cordifolia\n\nThese generally prefer more sun and can take drier soils:\n\nWood Lily, Lilium philadelphicum\n\nSwitch Grass, Panicum virgatum\n\nLittle Bluestem, Schizachyrium scoparium\n\nIndian Grass, Sorghastrum nutans\n\nButterflyweed, Asclepias tuberosa\n\nEutrochium spp. - these prefer damp soils, but drier soils will keep them from taking over the garden (maybe)\n\nNorthern Bush Honeysuckle, Diervilla lonicera\n\nWild Indigo, Baptisia tinctoria\n\nWild Senna, Senna hebecarpa - I think this prefers dampish soil, but it should do fine in “ordinary garden soil”\n\nMountain Mints, Pycnanthemum incanum. P. muticum, P. tenuifolium, P. verticillatum, P. virginianum - spectacular for attracting pollinators\n\nSweet-fern, Comptonia peregrina - this will likely spread a good bit if it’s happy\n\nAmerican Pokeweed, Phytolacca americana - big, messy, and spectacular\n\nVirgin’s Bower, Clematis virginiana - prefers dampish soil, but happy enough if it’s not too dry\n\nNew Jersey Tea, Ceanothus americanus - great for attracting pollinators\n\nVarious other asters and goldenrods would also be good, but I don’t know enough to say which ones would do better in a sunnier/drier site versus a shadier/damper site. E. divaricata spreads itself around in my garden in dry shade; Symphyotrichum cordifolium does well in a somewhat sunnier and damper site. S. laeve is a beautiful and well-behaved aster in my garden. New England and New York Asters are always worth trying.\n\nI’ll leave you with advice from my mother: Keep planting things until something does well; then plant more of that.\n\nAs others have mentioned, there’s hundreds of choices for native plants for a New England yard. I’m from New Hampshire, so I’m familiar with the sandy soil natives that do well on the often poor dry conditions we have. You would do well to locate your state’s native nurseries, which is the best place to obtain natives while supporting this growing industry. Specific resources I recommend are:\n\nhttps://grownativemass.org/\n\nhttps://wildseedproject.net/\n\nhttps://www.ernstseed.com/\n\nhttps://www.prairiemoon.com/\n\nAnd there are many excellent books for northeastern native plants for gardens, such as ’ The Northeast Native Plant Primer’ by the Native Plant Trust, ’ Native Plants of the Northeast: A Guide for Gardening and Conservation’ by Don Leopold, ’ Deer-Resistant Native Plants for the Northeast’ by Ruth Clausen, ‘Pollinators of Native Plants’ and its companion book ‘Bees: A Identification and Native Forage Guide’ by Heather Holm, and ‘Planting Native To Attract Birds To Your Yard’ by Sharon Sorenson, to name a few."
