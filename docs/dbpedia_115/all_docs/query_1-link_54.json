        "text": "There’s no denying that each year, as spring rolls around, it feels like quite literally a breath of fresh air. We made it through the post-holiday slump and are readying ourselves to embrace the sunshine that summertime brings. It’s somewhat of an awakening time of year filled with joyous anticipation and relief. Perhaps the spring season has that in common with welcoming a newborn baby. After we’ve spent nine months in eager anticipation, we’re ready to welcome our little one with open arms.\n\nIf you happen to find yourself having a spring baby this year and stuck on what name to give them, maybe drawing some inspiration from a pillar of the season is the way to go. That’s precisely why we wanted to collect a list of flower-inspired baby names that are perfect for spring newborns. With options for both boys and girls, the names below are either directly or loosely related to the most colorful characters of springtime. Read on for 65+ of our favorite flower-inspired baby names perfect for your spring bud or blossom.\n\nOur Favorite Flower-Inspired Baby Names\n\nFor Girls\n\nAmbretta\n\nThis unusual name not only is a type of purple-colored flower, but it also refers to a “jewel” in Arabic.\n\nAzalea\n\nA flower that can be found in several shades of pink, purple, red, and more, the Greek name also means “dry.”\n\nBelladonna\n\nFor a name with main character energy, look no further. This edgy baby name option holds the meaning of “beautiful lady” and shares a title with a nightshade plant that has deep purple flowers and poisonous black berries.\n\nBriar\n\nEnsure your little one has a free spirit by giving her this uncommon moniker that refers to a “thorny bush of wild roses.”\n\nBryony\n\nFor something even more uncommon, consider a Greek name that will encourage your little one to reach for the stars with a name meaning “climbing plant.”\n\nCalla\n\nIn the baby name realm, Calla is often seen as a nickname for the Greek Callista, meaning “beauty.” Gardners will quickly equate it to the gorgeous fluted flower, the calla lily.\n\nEliza\n\nWhile not directly related to a type of flower, fans of Old Hollywood movies may recognize this name meaning “pledged to God” as the flower seller and Audrey Hepburn’s character in My Fair Lady.\n\nEmbelia\n\nPerfect for a little girl who will be no stranger to the beach, this name references a tropical shrub that bears pink and white flowers.\n\nFlorentina\n\nEnsure your little girl “blossoms” into a bright young woman with this poetic Latin moniker.\n\nFleur\n\nThis highly feminine French title sweetly translates to “flower.”\n\nHeather\n\nJust as your little one will continue to grow throughout the years, her name will remain “evergreen.”\n\nHyacinth\n\nBotanists and Bridgerton fans alike can appreciate this unique title. Known as the youngest sibling in the series, the name refers to a blooming purple and blue perennial.\n\nIvy\n\nReferring to the climbing evergreen plant, we also appreciate that in the Ancient Greek culture, Ivy was seen as a sign of fidelity and faithfulness.\n\nKalei\n\nWelcome baby into your Ohana with this lovely Hawaiian name meaning “flower wreath.”\n\nLeilani\n\nOr, opt for another beautiful Hawaiian title meaning “heavenly flower.”\n\nLiliosa\n\nWe love this Spanish version of the popular name Lily, referring to a stunning flowering plant.\n\nLinnea\n\nA unique title of Swedish and Scandinavian descent, this name translates to “lime tree,” although it couldn’t be sweeter.\n\nMarguerite\n\nThis French version of the English Margaret is as elegant as it is rare. Meaning “daisy” and “pearl,” it is a highly luxurious title for any little one. As a bonus, the baby would share a birth name with the acclaimed American poet Maya Angelou.\n\nNeeja\n\nAnother name referring to the lily flower, Neeja is a feminine name of Hindi origin.\n\nPosy\n\nAn alternative to the classic Poppy, Posy is considered a “small bouquet of flowers.”\n\nRayen\n\nA common title in Chile, Rayen is a beautiful title holding the meaning of “flower.”\n\nViola\n\nA Latin name meaning “violet,” baby would share a name with celebrated American actress and film producer Viola Davis.\n\nWinika\n\nFit for a spring or winter baby alike, this unique moniker from the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand, the Maori, holds the meaning of “Christmas orchid.”\n\nZahara\n\nThis stunning Arabic name means “flowering” and “shining” and couldn’t be more perfect for a sweet little girl.\n\nMore Flower-Inspired Baby Names for Girls\n\nAmaryllis\n\nClover\n\nDaisy\n\nDahlia\n\nFlora\n\nLily\n\nHolly\n\nIris\n\nJasmine\n\nMarigold\n\nPetunia\n\nPoppy\n\nRose\n\nSaffron\n\nViolet\n\nWillow\n\nFor Boys\n\nAaron\n\nDraw inspiration from a yellow flowering shrub with this name that means “exalted” or “strength.”\n\nAciano\n\nThis earthy, masculine name of Spanish origin refers to the “blue bottle flower” that has a vibrant blue blossom.\n\nAnthony\n\nWe want our little boys to grow just like our favorite flowers and become “flourishing.”\n\nAlder\n\nJust like plants are highly “resilient,” we will want the same for our little ones.\n\nAsh\n\nThis ageless title dates all the way back to the time of the Vikings. Referring to the Ash tree, the Vikings considered it a symbol of protection.\n\nAster\n\nMeaning star, Aster was included on our list because of the vibrant star-shaped aster flowers commonly found in Eurasia.\n\nCedar\n\nTo add some additional hints of masculinity, we looked to trees, like the strong evergreen Cedar trees.\n\nCorey\n\nAnother tree-inspired inclusion, Corey is a youthful Irish name that refers to a “hollow” tree.\n\nCrisanto\n\nTraditionally an Italian surname, Crisanto has become increasingly rare over the years. But the charming name meaning “golden flower” may be fit for a spot on the charts.\n\nCypress\n\nReferring to the tall, slender trees, Cypress is a fun, edgy option we see making a name for itself in the near future.\n\nFlorian\n\nA popular option in many European cultures, Florian has Slavic, German, and Latin roots and holds the meaning of “flower.”\n\nFiorello\n\nGive your little bud a highly unique but gorgeous title with this Italian moniker meaning “little flower.”\n\nHawthorn\n\nOften seen as a symbol of natural beauty, this masculine British name refers to the flowering shrub in the rose family. We also appreciate that it’s reminiscent of the famed author of The House of Seven Gables, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nHeath\n\nBabies with this edgy title will share a name with the late Heath Ledger and have a name that refers to a scrubland habitat.\n\nIndigo\n\nGrowing in popularity for boys and girls, Indigo is a gender-neutral name that refers to the blue-ish purple color that’s found in nature.\n\nJacek\n\nPronounced “yat-zik,” the Polish masculine title refers to the hyacinth plant.\n\nJared\n\nThis Hebrew name that feels ’90s-inspired in the best way holds the meaning of “rose.”\n\nLaurence\n\nHonoring the bay laurel plan, Laurence is also said to symbolize victory, triumph, and success—what more could we want for our little ones?\n\nLupin\n\nAffectionately known as the bluebonnet, especially for our friends in Texas, the Lupin plant is a tall budding flower often seen in shades of blue. What makes this name even better is that it has a fierce meaning of “pertaining to the wolf.”\n\nOleander\n\nPoisonous yet beautiful, Oleander is known for being an evergreen Mediterranean shrub.\n\nRen\n\nShort but sweet, this Japanese name for a boy or a girl means “lotus.”\n\nRoosevelt\n\nQuickly associated with the 26th U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt, this strong name has the romantic meaning of “rose field.”\n\nSorrel\n\nNot just a brand of winter boots, Sorrel is a green leafy perineal plant native to Eurasia. The Old German title refers to a “reddish brown” color.\n\nWatson\n\nInspired by the stunning Watsonia flower, this distinguished Scottish surname means “son of Walter.”\n\nWilliam\n\nBrought to our list by the ornamental flowering plant known as the Sweet William, the title has an even better meaning of “resolute protector” and “desire.” The flowers are so sweet, in fact, that Kate Middleton included them in her bridal bouquet when she married Prince William in 2011.\n\nZahir\n\nJust like we want our little ones to do, this Arabic name means “blossoming.”"
