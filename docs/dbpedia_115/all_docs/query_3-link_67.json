        "text": "The Aster was conceived around the deeply held belief that the next generation of private members’ clubs will embody the warmth, welcome, and sophistication of the world’s best boutique hotels.\n\nGuests to The Aster choose their own adventure among exclusive bar and restaurant spaces, extensive wellness studios, the stylish pool lounge, and beyond. The sprawling club features a screening room, cabaret room, dedicated office space, and a recording studio. Guests also enjoy exclusive rates on The Aster's all-suites hotel.\n\nThe Aster is a place to refuel and refocus. They weave the pleasures of hospitality into everyday living. Surround yourself with people, sensations, and experiences that nurture your best thinking.\n\nThe Battery exists to provide its members an ideal social environment for interaction and inspiration. They're here to play host to bright minds with big ideas, provide an atmosphere that’s simultaneously stimulating and relaxing, and offer cocktails, cuisine and culture worthy of discussion.\n\nThe Battery is a place to engage with others. They do their best to keep phones pocketed when not in use and step away when talking on them. Laptops are always welcome in the library, and should be used sparingly in other areas, and only during less social hours.\n\nAnyone staying in one of the guest suites is considered a resident member of The Battery during their stay, and has access to many of the club’s facilities.\n\nIntentionally cultivated community, born from the collision of arts, local culture, entrepreneurial endeavors, and living a more meaningful and impactful life. Clayton's community values character over capital.\n\nSurrounded by like-minded individuals in a space that encourages and nurtures guests instincts to thrive and grow, they progress at Clayton. They are a community united by their commitment to best represent the remarkable locale of Denver – and continuously evolve it.\n\nThey convene, converse, and celebrate. They know there is a science to getting the room just right. A good feeling you get as soon as you walk through the front door, inviting you to experience something new, exciting, and utterly compelling. At Clayton, they're inspired and driven by their defining pillars: Be Fun. Be Curious. Be Authentic. Be Inclusive. Be Generous.\n\nClio is an evolved and elevated private members’ club for a generation of members grounded in purpose and seeking quality, connection and inspiration. A unique gathering place for a diverse community of bright minds and inspiring leaders who share a passion for the pursuit of excellence and recognize the importance of connecting with like-minded individuals.\n\nThe club is situated in the heart of Toronto’s King West village inside the inspired architecture of a bygone garment factory that has been reimagined into a creative, leisure-oriented “atelier”. With dynamic lounges, restaurant, vibrant bar, contemporary art gallery, cinema, roof terrace, and versatile private spaces offering custom-tailored environments for a broad range of activities and experiences.\n\nMembers and Alliance visitors are invited to a variety of events and experiences throughout the year, with fulsome monthly calendars insightfully programmed and expertly curated to their varied interests and discerning tastes.\n\nKjarval is a private members club, coworking- and social platform in downtown Reykjavik, Iceland. The club celebrates creativity in any shape and form, and the clientele represents their vision. Hence, Kjarval is a networking powerhouse for arts, business, politics, entrepreneurs, and academics. The social club is a platform for people who want to inspire others, be inspired, or enjoy a good cocktail and a glass of wine in beautiful surroundings.\n\nKjarval gets its name from Jóhannes S. Kjarval, one of Iceland’s greatest and most influential painters of the 20th century. Kjarval occupied the workspace from 1929 until he passed away in 1972. Kjarval became a prominent figure in downtown Reykjavik, and his influence lives on. The renovated workspace will continue with his legacy of finding the right balance between work & networking, with a focus on promoting creativity and innovation.\n\nThey welcome members from partnership clubs worldwide to Iceland, and they're eager to showcase their hospitality. If needed, they can help you plan your trip to Iceland, recommend and book hotels and restaurants, tours, rental cars, entertainment, etc.\n\nLocated in the heart of the Miami Design District, the landmark Moore building is a four story, 90,000 square foot space, anchored by a nearly 30,000-square-foot private social club located on the second floor.\n\nThe Club features culinary concepts led by Executive Chef Joe Anthony, formerly of Michelin-starred Gabriel Kreuther in New York City and the space boasts multiple bars and lounges, which offer an array of cocktails curated by internationally renowned mixologist Nico de Soto. It is home to a house art collection, curated by art advisor and collector Monica Kalpakian and showcases mixed media works by noted artists including Derek Fordjour, Sonia Gomes, Gabriel Orozco, Rob Pruitt, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, and others. Additionally, members of The Club receive invitations to private events, off-site travel excursions and interesting programming covering a range of topics, from fashion and design to technology and innovation, fine art, culinary, wine and spirits and more.\n\nOutside of the private members space, The Moore is home to Elastika, a public-facing restaurant, a dedicated Workplace, and a prestigious 13-key hotel located on the building’s 4th floor."
