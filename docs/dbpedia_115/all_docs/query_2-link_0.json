This development, called The Aster, is part of the Banff Housing Strategy to ensure those working in Banff are able to live in Banff. The homes were sold at the cost of construction only. The development was complete in October 2023.\n\nBanff celebrates completion of 33 new homes in The Aster\n\nThe Banff Housing Corporation will manage the building and sales of the dwellings. Learn more at banff.ca/housing\n\nThe Aster is named after a perennial wildflower frequently found in Banff National Park.\n\nThe Aster is located at 340 Banff Avenue.\n\nLearn more about The Aster, floor plans, price lists and more at AsterBanff.ca.\n\nLearn about the Hindes Cabin, a heritage structure on the site that will be preserved and integrated into the common area of the condominium complex.\n\nInquiries about the Banff Housing Corporation?
