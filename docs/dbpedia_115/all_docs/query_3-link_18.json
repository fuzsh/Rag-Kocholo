It has a fairly smooth, waxy stem that can reach up to 1.5 metres in height. The small daisy-like flowers have pale blue-violet petals and a yellow centre that turns purple with age.\n\nThe upper leaves are narrow and grass-like with a few small teeth along the edge. The tiny seeds are scattered by the wind.\n\nWhere it lives\n\nIn Ontario, the Willowleaf aster is found in openings of oak savannahs, a very rare type of vegetation community containing many tallgrass prairie herbs and oak trees.\n\nIt has also been found along railways, roadsides and in abandoned farm fields.\n\nWhere it’s been found in Ontario\n\nIn Canada, the Willowleaf aster is believed to exist at about 12 locations in southwest Ontario, in Lambton, Essex and Middlesex Counties and the Municipality of Chatham-Kent. Additional populations may no longer exist.\n\nThe largest populations are in the greater Ojibway Prairie Complex of Windsor and on Walpole Island. The population size is unknown. The Willowleaf aster is common in the Midwestern United States.\n\nView a larger version of this map (PDF)\n\nWhat threatens it\n\nThe main threat to Willowleaf aster is habitat destruction due to habitat alteration, urban, and industrial development.\n\nIn the last 20 years, urban expansion has caused this rare plant to disappear from several sites where it was once found.\n\nAction we are taking\n\nThreatened Species and their general habitat are automatically protected.\n\nRecovery strategy\n\nA recovery strategy advises the ministry on ways to ensure healthy numbers of the species return to Ontario.\n\nRead the executive summary (November 22, 2013)\n\nRead the recovery strategy (November 22, 2013)\n\nGovernment response statement\n\nA government response statement outlines the actions the government intends to take or support to help recover the species.\n\nRead the government response statement (December 15, 2014)\n\nReview of progress\n\nA review of progress made toward protecting and recovering a species is required no later than the time specified in the species’ government response statement, or not later than five years after the government response statement is published if no time is specified.\n\nRead the report on progress towards the protection and recovery of 16 species at risk, including Willowleaf aster (Symphyotrichum praealtum) (2019).\n\nHabitat protection\n\nGeneral Habitat Protection - June 30, 2013\n\nWhat you can do\n\nReport a sighting\n\nReport a sighting of an endangered animal or plant to the Natural Heritage Information Centre. Photographs with specific locations or mapping coordinates are always helpful.\n\nVolunteer\n\nVolunteer with your local nature club or provincial park to participate in surveys or stewardship work focused on species at risk.\n\nBe a good steward\n\nPrivate land owners have a very important role to play in species recovery; if you find Willowleaf aster on your land, you may be eligible for stewardship programs that support the protection and recovery of species at risk and their habitats.\n\nInvasive species seriously threaten many of Ontario’s species at risk; to learn what you can do to help reduce the threat of invasive species, visit:\n\nInvasive species in Ontario\n\nOntario Invading Species Awareness Program\n\nThe Ontario Invasive Plant Council\n\nPollinators, such as bees, are in steep decline across the globe and they play a key role in the survival of many of Ontario’s rare plants. For information on how you can help scientists monitor pollinator populations in Ontario visit Seeds of Diversyty.\n\nWillowleaf aster and many other species at risk depend on healthy grassland prairies, a rare habitat in Ontario; learn more about these habitats, the species that depend on them, and what you can do to help.\n\nReport illegal activity\n\nReport any illegal activity related to plants and wildlife to 1-877-TIP-SMNR (847-7667).\n\nQuick facts"
