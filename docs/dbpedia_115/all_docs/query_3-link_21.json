        "text": "Our work\n\nThe Wilder Institute has over 20 years of experience working and advising on conservation translocation projects around the world. With this experience, we are providing guidance and training to our partners that will contribute to the success of this initiative.\n\nPlant Propagation & Translocation\n\nThis research aims to increase the number and size of populations of at-risk Canadian plant species on protected lands. To accomplish this, researchers will be using the conservation tool of translocation to create new populations of crooked-stem aster in suitable habitats within the species’ historical range.\n\nOur partners at the University of Lethbridge are using computer modelling and Species Distribution Model (SDMs) to rank habitat suitability as low, medium, and high and will be exploring how well these SDMs can predict the success of these translocations.\n\nResearchers are also investigating the effect of other factors on the success on the translocation of the crooked-stem aster. Some factors to be tested include the effect of propagation method (i.e. using seed, immature or mature plants) and the effect of protected and unprotected plantings. Providing a protective structure over a translocated or recently seeded plant can help to protect from herbivory from animals such as white-tailed deer and mice.\n\nThey will be testing the effects of environmental factors of the sites such as sun exposure, soil moisture, and canopy cover. Finally, they will also be looking at the effects of competition by removing all other species in a plot and imitating mowing in adjacent plots. In addition to this research, the team will be plating some plants back into wild sites as a reciprocal plating or test control.\n\nThis research will also increase our knowledge of the life history and population demographics of some of Canada’s plant species at risk, including:\n\nOur conservation impact\n\nThe knowledge gained from this research has the potential to be used in plant translocations across Canada and beyond. It will inform recovery efforts for at-risk plant species in Canada and increase the knowledge and capacity to use translocations as a recovery tool for rare plant species in the future."
