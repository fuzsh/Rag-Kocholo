        "text": "It’s important to understand the impact pollinators have on nature and the economy in Ontario. Pollinators maintain biodiversity, support plant reproduction and provide many other ecological services.\n\nAll pollinators have an essential, often-overlooked role in our economy. By pollinating many crops humans consume and trade, they’re essential to our food security. Scientists estimate that approximately 75 per cent of the world’s flowering plants and 35 per cent of global food crops depend on animal pollinators to produce.\n\nFun fact: More than 800 bee species are native to Canada and more than 400 of those are in Ontario! The province is a bee diversity hot spot. In fact, Toronto was Canada’s first “Bee City.”\n\nA University of Toronto researcher developed a website to identify corporate “bee-washing,” when companies mislead consumers to buy products or subscribe to services under the pretense of helping bees, or as a marketing spin to improve their public image."
