        "text": "Summary\n\nDid you know?\n\nThis beautiful aster was originally described in 1835 by botanist John Leonard Riddell and named Aster oolentangiensis after the Olentangy River in Ohio where he found it near Worthington, Ohio. Riddell misspelled the river name with two Os and thus the species has that spelling. Its name was later changed to Aster azureus to reflect its sky blue flower color. When the genus was changed to Symphyotrichum the older species name had precedence.\n\nState Ranking Justification\n\nThere is one large existing population with hundreds of plants and another population with just one plant which is probably extirpated. There are three historical occurrences from 1888 to 1936 but they are also probably extirpated.\n\nShort-term Trends\n\nThe large population has been fairly stable over time although it was reduced at one time by excessive mowing.\n\nLong-term Trends\n\nThe large population has been fairly stable over time although it was reduced at one time by excessive mowing.\n\nGeneral Description\n\nSymphyotrichum oolentangiense is a native perennial that grows in erect, dense clumps of 1 to 5 or more stems reaching up to 1.5 m tall. The plants are short-rhizomatous or have branched, woody stems and roots. Away from the flower arrays the stems vary from being nearly smooth (glabrate) to covered with stiff, short hairs (hispidulous), within the arrays the stems bear either minute, long, soft straight hairs (pilosulous) or straight stiff, sharp appressed hairs (strigillose). Leaves are mostly concentrated towards the lower stem and are thick and firm, with entire or toothed margins, are variously hairy on both surfaces, and typically wither by flowering. The lower leaves are distinctive with long, often winged stalks with expanded, heart-shaped bases and scabrous upper surfaces. The upper leaves are lance-like and stalkless but do not clasp the stem. As with all asters, the infloresences are arranged radially into \"heads\" of many separate ray and disc flowers, with each head superficially resembling a single flower. The flowering heads of Sky-blue Aster are borne in open, loose, narrowly-branched, stiffly upright, more or less pyramidal clusters. The heads are 19 to 34 mm across and have 10 to 25 usually pale to azure blue to violet-purple (rarely rosy, white or bluish white), ray petals. The whorls of bracts (involucres) enclosing the flower base are bell-shaped to elliptic bell-shaped and 4.5 to 8 mm long. The individual involcral bracts (phyllaries) are in (3-)4-6 series, lying flat (appressed) or slightly spreading with a distinct dark diamond-shaped tip. The fruits are dull purple or stramineous with purple streaks, oblong-egg-shaped (obovoid) and more or less compressed. They are 1.8-2 mm long and 4-5-nerved, and smooth (glabrate) to sparsely covered with short stiff hairs and tipped with cream or slightly rose-tinged hair tufts (pappi) 3-4 mm long (Brouillet et al 2006).\n\nIdentifying Characteristics\n\nSymphyotrichum oolentangiense is a native perennial that grows in erect, dense clumps ( of 1 to 5+ stems reaching up to 1.5 m tall. The plants are short-rhizomatous or have branched, woody stems and roots. Away from the flower the stems vary from being nearly smooth (glabrate) to covered with stiff, short hairs (hispidulous), while within the arrays the stems bear either minute, long, soft straight hairs (pilosulous) or straight stiff, sharp appressed hairs (strigillose). Leaves are present mostly towards the lower stem. They are thick, firm, with entire or toothed margins, are variously hairy on both surfaces and typically wither by flowering. The lower leaves are distinctive with long, often winged stalks with expanded sheathing bases. The leaves have a very rough (scabrous) upper surface, and typically a heart-shaped base. The upper leaves are lance-like and stalkless but do not clasp the stem. 15 to 25 mm wide s with all asters, the infloresences are arranged radially into \"heads\" of many separate ray and disc flowers, superficially resembling a single flowerThe flowering heads are borne in open, loose, narrowly-branched, stiffly upright, more or less pyramidal shaped clusters (arrays). The flowering heads (19 to 34 mm across) have 10 to 25 usually pale to azure blue to violet-purple, rarely rosy, white or bluish white, ray petals (corollas). The whorls of bracts (involucres) enclosing the flower base are bell-shaped to elliptic bell-shaped and 4.5 to 8 mm long. The individual bracts (phyllaries) are in (3-)4-6 series, lying flat (appressed) or with the outer slightly spreading with a distinct darker (green) diamond-shaped tip. The fruits (cypselae) are dull purple or stamineous with purple streaks, oblong-egg-shaped (obovoid) and more or less Â± compressed. They are 1.8-2 mm long and 4-5-nerved, and smooth (glabrate) to sparsely covered with short stiff hairs (strigose) and tipped with cream or slightly rose-tinged hair tufts (pappi) 3-4 mm long. (Brouillet et al 2006)\n\nBest Life Stage for Proper Identification\n\nEntire flowering or fruiting plants are needed for identification.\n\nSimilar Species\n\nSymphyotrichum laeve has sessile, smooth, glabrous leaf faces in contrast to S. oolentangiense's stalked and noticeably rough and hairy leaves. Symphyotrichum concolor has sessile lower leaves S. cordifolium is more compact and has leaves with more deeply lobed bases, and is generally a forest species while S. oolentangiense is associated with more open sites.\n\nBest Time to See\n\nSkyblue aster typically flowers mid-August through late September, the fruits are typically present beginning in early October may persist into mid-November.\n\nFlowering\n\nFruiting\n\nThe time of year you would expect to find Sky-blue Aster flowering and fruiting in New York.\n\nSky-blue Aster Images"
