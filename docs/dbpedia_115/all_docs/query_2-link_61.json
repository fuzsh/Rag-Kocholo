        "text": "The Three Rivers Park District Board of Commissioners has approved the draft master plan for Segment A of the Canadian Pacific Rail Regional Trail (CP Rail Regional Trail) and released the plan for public comments. Segment A will link the Nine Mile Creek Regional Trail, Hyland-Bush-Anderson Lakes Park Reserve and the Minnesota River.\n\nCanadian Pacific Rail Regional Trail Draft Master Plan\n\nThe CP Rail Regional Trail is a planned 21-mile regional trail corridor that traverses six communities in Hennepin County – Bloomington, Edina, St. Louis Park, Golden Valley, New Hope, and Crystal.\n\nThe trail will fill a critical north-south gap in the regional trail system and provide a highly desirable recreation amenity to adjacent communities and the greater region. Once complete, the trail route will provide an exclusively off-road trail experience for an estimated 305,000 users.\n\nThe trail will link and expand access to numerous local and regional trails, residential neighborhoods, local and regional parks, businesses, and destinations and natural open spaces such as the Minnesota River and Hyland-Bush-Anderson Lake Park Reserve.\n\nThe proposed trail alignment will connect to six regional trails: Nine Mile Creek, Cedar Lake LRT, North Cedar Lake, Luce Line, Bassett Creek and Crystal Lake.\n\nPublic comment period from March 26 – April 26\n\nSend comments to:\n\nCPRail@ThreeRiversParks.org or\n\nCP Rail Regional Trail\n\nThree Rivers Park District\n\n3000 Xenium Lane N\n\nPlymouth, MN 55441\n\nHard copies of the master plan can be found at: Three Rivers Park District Administrative Center (3000 Xenium Lane N, Plymouth), Edina City Hall, Bloomington City Hall, and the following Hennepin County Libraries: Edina and Penn Lake in Bloomington."
