        "text": "Welcome to My Garden\n\nI am Jean Potuchek, a professional sociologist, retired college professor, and amateur gardener who loves flowering perennials. I garden in East Poland, Maine (USDA zone 5a/4b). Some posts also focus on a small garden I kept in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania (USDA zone 6b) where I used to teach and live part-time.\n\nSince my retirement, I've been deepening my horticultural knowledge by becoming certified as a Master Gardener Volunteer and by earning a Certificate in Native Plants and Ecological Horticulture from the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens.\n\nIn this blog, I draw on my gardening experience as I reflect on my own garden, make observations about gardens I visit, and review garden books and garden blogs. Occasionally, I use the lens of my sociological training to consider the social meaning of gardening and to observe the community of garden bloggers. This is my space to share my passion for gardening. Please join me!"
