        "text": "I rarely take accomodation or restaurant advice from guidebooks. I just haven't had much luck with them.\n\nI tend to forego \"charm\" for hotels that offer me frequent stay points and benefits. I'll take comfort and air conditioning when I'm traveling to insure a good rest. Plus the points can be used for free rooms in expensive areas. (Are you listening NYC?)\n\nI lean towards IHG, Hilton and Hyatt. I used to like Marriott but I'm tired of paper thin walls and poor service. I'll probably replace them with Accor or smaller chains that might not offer points.\n\nFor hotels, I check reviews on Tripadvisor and Booking.com.\n\nFor restaurants, I'll note suggestions on forums like this but also ask locals once I get to a location.\n\nI put blind faith in nothing.\n\nAllan, one small correction (actually kind of big) - she was encouraged to post her review by RS staff that she contacted first. Her first impulse wasn’t to come complain (although we see that a lot).\n\nBut in answer to your question, we all put faith in someone’s recommendation. I prefer to put mine in a combination of reviews, pictures, location, and my own quirkiness. Probably Rick’s recommendations are generally solid enough, but they are also generic AND are for what he likes. I occasionally pick hotels for other people and I don’t pick the same ones that I do for myself.\n\nI have stayed in a couple of his recommendations (and never taken a tour) but, while just fine, they didn’t do anything for me. On the other hand, I recently stayed in a place I loved that I think IS in his book because my hostess told me about him knocking on her door incognito (WAY back before internet) pretending to be looking for a place to stay. I don’t own the guidebook for this country to see if my place is still there; but if it is, it has been ages ago and theoretically it could have easily gone downhill (it hasn’t).\n\nAnd no offense to anyone here but I rarely use recommendations from here either, although I have come across a few real gems (for me). But that is why I also generally dislike making lodging recommendations…..\n\nI do like your analogy quite a bit.\n\nit’s only one kernel in a large bag of popcorn, and I have a lot of kernels to get through\n\nWell, considering that I find that Marriott Hilton etc. in Europe are way more expensive than other options And also often very poorly located while I’m pretty loyal to them in the United States, I’m not at all loyal to them in Europe. I will stay there if I could stay for free using my rewards, but if not, I’m going to stay at someplace else more than likely.\n\nBut I don’t rely on Rick anymore than I just rely on any one review. For example, the statement above about Marriott having thin walls and poor service. I do have a favorite Marriott in London and Paris that I have used for years when I have points and neither of those have either of those problems. Generalizations about any place generally don’t work so you need to research the hotel you’re looking at and see if it meets your needs.\n\nI’ve also developed my rules for reviews. When I’m reading reviews if it starts the statement about how they didn’t expect an upgrade because it was their anniversary birthday honeymoon random event they made up, but one would’ve been nice. I quit reading. Obviously, they expected an upgrade or they wouldn’t be writing about it and now they’re going to find things to complain about because the hotel didn’t realize how special they were. if the review complains about how the airline lost their luggage and the hotel didn’t help them, ignore the review. I’m sorry that you can’t tell the difference between the hotel and the airline but I can. (same rule applies for any complaints about taxis, etc. in the hotel review). if everyone in the hotel was rude and mean to them- ignore it. If everyone you meet at any location or place is rude to you, you may want to look in a mirror. ( I’ve been to some hotels with some rude front desks. And one of those was a Rick Steves recommendation in Paris, but the maid was not rude and the evening clerk was not rude.) if the airline canceled their flight or for some other reason, they didn’t show up for the reservation and the hotel won’t give a refund - Ignore the review. You need to read the terms and conditions of your booking and understand them. Most hotels now have a 24 hour cancellation so if you just don’t show up, you’re not getting Refund. They were holding a room for you so They couldn’t sell it to someone else. They deserve some compensation.\n\nIf a reviewer is on social media and they’re unhappy, that’s actually probably a good sign, imho. Several years ago I met a social media wannabe and literally when she gets to a hotel, restaurant etc. she stops and tells them how many thousand followers she has and about her social media presence and then expects upgrades, freebies etc. When they don’t do that she proceeds to go on social media and trash them. Obviously I no longer talk to this dingbat, but I don’t think she’s alone. . I’ve stayed in one social media popular hotel in Florida. Horrible service and way overpriced but cute places for your Instagram and TikTok videos and they advertised that they would help you with your social media posts. They just don’t help you with anything else. ( if anybody is going to lake Nona, let me know I’ll give you the name of this resort)’\n\nNot so much an issue of blind faith, but a heavy dose of skepticism. In the end after you've done your research your decision is still has an element of faith.\n\nI do like forums as a jump off point, a place to see what folks are talking about and what information is getting passed around. I don't read guide books, but if I did read a RS recommendation for the Astor House, once I hit their website it would be a hard no. No booking engine, no way to see room rates or availability by dates and no secure reservation/payment system.\n\nUsually when I'm contemplating towns to visit, Google Maps is part of the early search. Where is the train station, what hotels are near to the station and attractions that are a reason to visit. I'll go on to hotel websites, look at photos/videos and build my list. I won't book AirBnB nor through booking.com or any third party. When reading reviews, of course there's the need filter. I don't start with the 5 star/bubble/thumbs-up reviews. I dont need to start with the praise. I'll note the ratio of bad to good reviews and start with the thumbs down reviews. Is there a common theme to the complaints & criticism? Overly dramatic or emotional reviews get skipped over. Someone stays in a hotel that is a structure built in 1470 then complains about the lean of the room floor? It's a 1470 structure, what do you expect? Skip. Are the criticism and critiques reasonable? It's after I've whittled down my list that I take that final leap of faith and book a hotel.\n\nI've mentioned that I like Locke Hotels. Each time in London I stay at Broken-Wharf. So, when I made plans to visit Manchester I of course made a reservation at Whitworth Locke.\n\nI deleted another post where I was too critical of Rick's guidebook recommendation for that particular hotel.\n\nI came to this site through enjoying Rick's PBS TV shows on Youtube, but I've never read one of his guidebooks. His hotel recommendations and where the tours go seem a bit out of date. I think we're all guilty of a bit of nostalgia; I know I can be nostalgic for travel I did 20 or 25 years ago. Rick seems a bit stuck with the type of places that were feasible to run to a standard decades ago. It's a bit of a different landscape now. There's other alternatives in the same price bracket as Fawlty Towers.\n\nI don't think I have blind faith in anything I read, whether it's the news or travel recommendations. I think one has a few sources that they decide are credible, either in person, on a thread here or something in the media. It takes time to build up a degree of trust. As an example, Time Out's website is somewhere I have that degree of trust for London reviews; they've maintained a good standard since the days of print. Conde Nast Traveller was another recently that I assessed as being very in touch with London for North Americans, obviously with good correspondents on the ground.\n\nWell, considering that I find that Marriott Hilton etc. in Europe are way more expensive than other options And also often very poorly located\n\nI find it to be the complete opposite! Of the city trips I've taken just this year the Hilton I stayed at in Riga was next door to the Museum of Soviet Occupation (one of the best museums in Riga) and within 2 minutes walk to the closest square in the Old Town. The Radisson Blu in Gdansk was right on Długi Targ, possibly the most picturesque and most visited street in Gdansk. The Westin in Warsaw was ideally located to where I wanted to visit and the Hilton in Istanbul was a 10 minute walk to the Grand Bazaar or one stop on the tram located directly outside.\n\nThe big chain hotels have the resources to buy buildings and build hotels in the prime locations yet they also build hotels in locations that are also beneficial to their customers such as proximity to airports, conference centres etc.\n\nI tend to stick to the big chains partly due to loyalty status which means upgrades, lounge access etc but also because of reliability and continuity. I know that I'm going to have a good, comfortable bed (I even know the differences between a Hilton, Marriott and Radisson bed so know what to expect) which is a big deal for me, I've stayed at too many private rentals to know that beds and pillows, bedlinen etc are of a lower standard to what I find comfortable. I also want a good bathroom, a shower with decent water pressure and enough room to move around comfortably. I would never book a stay at the Astor House hotel referred to in another thread simply based on the photos displayed on the website, the place doesn't look like it's been updated since the 80's and that's a red flag for me.\n\nI use Booking.com to start for hotel reviews. Then I look for reviews on other platforms to see if similar reviews exist. I never use guidebook recommendations, especially Rick Steves guidebooks for hotels because they are just not my style. Charm and a central location are not always necessary to me. I have stayed in very nice and quiet hotels away from the central part of town if public transportation is readily available nearby. A fifteen minute tram or metro ride can save a lot of money per night and the hotels are much more modern and quiet plus most likely their AC does work. Fifteen minutes isn't a big deal for me personally. Trust me, there are locals working in those hotels as well as the ones in the central part of town and they are splendid to talk to about their city.\n\nI also rarely book direct with a hotel, much to the disagreement of many here, unless the hotel has a secure booking website. I would never fax, email or mail a credit card number to anyone. My attitude is that if the hotel cannot get into the 21st century with a reservation website, what other surprises do they have when I arrive? This may be an unfair general assessment and there are exception to the rules, but most horror stories that people post here say things like, \"I can't get an answer even from the owners even though I email them every other day.\"\n\nI think your strategy for getting just a kernel here and there is a good approach. I do the same for restaurants as well.\n\nI use a real variety of sources to find lodging and restaurants. I prefer smaller mom and pop type places for both of these, but there are some pretty darn good Marriotts etc too. One that specifically comes to mind is in Dresden, the Gewandhaus Marriott there is excellent! Prime location, not expensive, and just overall perfect, IMO. My husband used to stay there every month pre pandemic, and I tagged along once and was sold. When we planned that trip he said he would not even consider anywhere else, which was not like him, so I went on blind faith there. He did good;)\n\nI remember years ago planning a trip to France and we were taking my mom along. I found The Muguet and it was perfect, and then saw it listed in the RS book after I booked our stay. It had to laugh because on another forum, someone was basically bashing RS and saying they would never stay somewhere that he recommended, but they were recommending this same hotel. Sometimes you just gotta smile and walk away;)\n\nMr É's point is important. There is no way any review or guidebook could possibly identify \"the best\" of anything without trying all possible options multiple times, continually. You have to accept the limitations of reviews and use your experience and judgment. I guess some people skip the preliminary discussions in the RS guidebooks and go right to the lists. They're probably not the right guidebooks for you if you don't buy into his style.\n\nI've stayed in several RS suggested places in the UK and Germany, and on tours as well, I've been happy with them, quirks and creaks and all. But I understood the reasoning and limitations behind them - location is Rick's primary criterion, not comfort and luxury. It's part of the travel experience to me - local flavor I wouldn't get at a US-chain hotel.\n\nI stay at Marriotts in the US as well, but then we need cars to get around anyway, so central location is less important. And mom & pop hotels are less reputable places to stay.\n\nThe post about the Aster House was a good service to RS. I was told by one B&B operator that someone from RS stops by once a year to check on the prices and any major changes, but I can't imagine the expense of doing a regular thorough inspection of each and every place mentioned in all his guidebooks. It seems to me that RS needs and wants that feedback from users.\n\nBut blind faith - no.\n\nI don’t think people are saying they don’t have faith in Rick’s recommendations. Some of us are saying those recommendations may not be right for us and that’s a very legitimate statement. There are probably people on this forum who for example, in London would only be happy at the Ritz. Rick is never going to be happy at those places. It’s just not his style - that doesn’t mean his taste is wrong. It means he is a human and one of the nice things about Rick and his books is he gives his opinion and he hires people who think like he does.\n\nI’ve Recommended a budget hotel in the Latin quarter of Paris several times. It would not make ricks book because he has moved beyond it, but it is still a bathroom down the hall hotel and it still exist and it’s dirt cheap but Rick knows that most of his readers don’t want that anymore so he’s not going to list it. He only has so many pages. (He’s already got the paper as thin as they can make it. )\n\nBefore any trip, I read a lot of guide books and some magazines . And I’ll be honest I actually do trust Rick’s opinions more than a lot of others because I do think they actually go look at the hotel restaurant etc I’m pretty sure that some of them are just listing out hotels and I’m also pretty sure that some of them are getting paid to list out those hotels.\n\nRick admits he has a bias and he focuses on areas he likes etc. if you don’t want to stay there or if you have different requirements for hotel, you’re going to have to go beyond his recommendations. It’s not the end of the world. The world is not one size fits all\n\nI recognize that some on this board are pro local hotels and somewhat\n\nopposed to chains. I find that the consistency of experience and\n\ntravel benefits outweigh any negative aspects of global corporations.\n\nI'm on the fence on this one. Hotels are so important to the quality of a trip that consistency of a chain is comforting, but I also love quirky.\n\nNot calling anyone out, but these thoughts are commonly stated on various forums, so I am curious, what is local vs what is a chain? can a chain be local? Does it matter the size of the chain? How do we determine such things? And are we painting ourselves into a corner?\n\nI think we have all stayed in a great many variation of accommodations. I have enjoyed the family operated independent hotels, accommodations operated by churches or universities and chains.\n\nBut the one thing about so many of the big chains anymore is that they are not all corporate owned/operated, rather they are franchised properties, where the asset owners are paying for the benefit of brand and all that association brings. In turn the customer gets the brand consistency. The Brand 123 hotel in City X, may very well be owned by a locally owned and operated hotel franchised with an international brand name, it may have at some point in its history even been franchised by another brand. What about hotel groups that may only be a few properties or a regional brand?\n\nI do not ever see myself using chains like Premier Inn or Travelodge, I really do like Locke Hotels. What I do not enjoy is the cookie cutter sameness and I do like the uniqueness or quirkiness of many independent operations. I have a reservation at a pub/restaurant & hotel. It is local but the owners also operate a second location in the same town just a couple blocks away and a third in another near by town.\n\nIsn't all travel based on blind-faith, though? It seems that sometimes we look at sooo many reviews on TA and from this forum, and then book something completely different. And of course there are reviews we wouldn't consider, whether it's differences of taste, price, etc. Our process has been refined to each of us doing 'some' research, then narrowing down hotels to 3 each before choosing. For me, I like my own bathroom and always check to see if there's a hair dryer. For my husband, there needs to be a breakfast and coffee. We're headed to Spain soon and we found it easiest to join the Catalonia hotel group for the discounts in hotel reservations. That made the decision much easier!\n\nOver the years I've learned one has to be willing to be uncomfortable in order to travel. Things don't always go smoothly or according to plan. Weather happens. Travel hair is a real thing. We might not be feeling well. All the things. The RS forum, books, and tv shows have been helpful and are usually my jumping off point."
