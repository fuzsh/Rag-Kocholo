A common theme of ecological gardening efforts is the inclusion of native plants in landscape design (Uren et al., 2015). Research suggests that gardens composed of native plants are associated with higher native insect β-diversity (the change in species diversity between sites in a community) than those planted with exotic species (Burghardt and Tallamy, 2015). Other studies have shown that exotic plant species support lesser insect species abundance than native plants (Burghardt et al., 2010). Further work by Narango et al. (2017) suggested that urban plantings should include native plant species to provide improved habitats and sustain native fauna.\n\nWhen considering bees (Anthophila) in particular, many species are generalists and can be found broadly foraging across an array of native, non-native, and cultivated plant species (Baldock et al., 2015; Matteson and Langellotto, 2011; Salisbury et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2011). Nonetheless, gardens with higher proportions of native plants may experience increased bee activity (Fukase and Simons, 2016) and those with more diverse native plant groups increased pollinator diversity (Hostetler and McIntyre, 2001). Therefore, the use of native plant species in garden habitats may help conserve broad insect groups in urban and suburban landscapes, which is particularly timely because of recent reports of global declines in insect populations (Hallmann et al., 2017; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019).\n\nBecause of their ecological benefits, native plants are a market niche that nursery plant growers and vendors could target. Currently, native plant gardening is an area of interest and growth in the landscaping and nursery industries. The American Society of Landscape Architects ranked native plants and drought-tolerant plants as the two most popular landscape and garden trends in 2018 (Howard, 2018), and the use of native plants by landscape architects and contractors in the southeastern United States has increased with clientele interest (Brzuszek and Harkess, 2009). Despite increasing public interest in incorporating native plants in gardens and other ornamental landscapes, these species are not widely planted by home gardeners and are not widely available at retail nurseries (Avolio et al., 2018; Loram et al., 2008). It is unclear how public interest is balanced with the barriers to adoption that exist at the consumer level and the production level.\n\nOn the consumer level, a lack of availability contributes heavily to the low rate of adoption of native garden plants (Wilde et al., 2015). Native plants of limited diversity are available for sale at nurseries, and 74% of the vascular plant species native to the United States are not sold commercially (White et al., 2018). Additionally, gardeners tend to lack knowledge about native plants (Kauth and Pérez, 2011), thereby compounding the issue of availability because gardeners who are not aware of native plants will not request them to be stocked for sale. Finally, consumers tend to prefer cultivated plants that have been bred for aesthetic appeal, or garden standards that are familiar and traditionally used in ornamental landscapes (Yue et al., 2012).\n\nMultiple barriers to adoption also exist at the production level. Nurseries will not increase their selection of native plants for sale unless a market exists for these species, forming a feedback loop with a lack of demand from consumers (Wilde et al., 2015). From a production standpoint, there is limited information regarding the performance of native plants across a realistic range of garden settings, thus complicating the prioritization of plants to produce for sale. Similarly, propagation methods for these plants are generally lacking, and smaller niche nurseries lack resources to create protocols or introduce new plants into production (Norcini, 2007). In addition, the localized nature of native plants means that markets are regionalized. This can make it difficult for growers to scale-up production and can limit sales to smaller geographic regions.\n\nIf nursery growers are interested in meeting the public’s demand for native plants, then it would be useful to know which plants show the most promise for retail sales and how gardeners who identify as native plant gardeners (compared to the general gardening public) perceive native plants as garden plants. Therefore, we conducted two online surveys to quantify the appeal of flowering plants that are native to the northwestern United States. The objective of our first survey was to quantify the baseline appeal of 23 native northwestern U.S plant species to gardeners. For this first survey, we hypothesized that gardeners who identified themselves as a native plant gardener would find native plants more aesthetically appealing and would be more willing to include these native plants in their gardens than other gardeners.\n\nThe objective of the second survey was to investigate whether access to information regarding the ecological benefits of specific native plants would change gardeners’ opinions of these plants. We hypothesized that all gardeners would increase their positive impression of native plants by a similar magnitude, irrespective of demographic group, after learning about the bees that are associated with various native plant species. Again, we hypothesized that gardeners who identify as native plant gardeners would rank these plants higher, overall, than non-native plant gardeners.\n\nConclusions\n\nNative plant gardening has increased in popularity. There needs to be a corresponding increase in the understanding of which plants provide specific ecological benefits, which are most attractive to gardeners, and the interaction between these two factors. Our study indicates that gardeners have high potential to include plants native to the northwestern United States in their yards. Furthermore, the results of our ecological benefits survey indicate that only a minimum amount of education significantly increases gardeners’ positive impressions of native plants.\n\nLiterature cited\n\nAvolio,M.L., Pataki,D.E., Trammell,T.L. & Endter-Wada,J. 2018 Biodiverse cities: The nursery industry, homeowners, and neighborhood differences drive urban tree composition Ecol.
