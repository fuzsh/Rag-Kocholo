        "text": "Seven hundred and fifty-one of Georgia’s native plant species are of “special concern” on the State Heritage List. Some are critically endangered with no protection by law, even on state or federal land. The populations are rapidly dwindling and could very well go extinct if conservation actions do not quickly occur. We are working to ensure conservation of Georgia’s imperiled plant diversity. You can help us!\n\nAt the Mimsie Lanier Center for Native Plant Studies, our core mission is to inspire people to value plants. We do this for all the reasons plants are important; for the survival of other species, for the potential of medicines, for the support of foods, for the sake of clean water, for the production of air, for the beauty they provide by simply existing. We are focused on “high priority species” that are at risk of extinction and in most critical need of conservation actions. We are a research, education and plant production center at the State Botanical Garden in Athens, Georgia, nestled between the prairie, floodplain and forest natural areas. With 2.5 acres of fenced space, we propagate native Georgia plants for habitat restoration, introduction to the gardening community, and endangered species recovery. We also promote the incorporation of Georgia natives into garden displays and right-of-way restoration projects to enhance local biodiversity that contributes to food security, health, emotional well-being and quality of life.\n\nYou Can Preserve Georgia’s Native Plants\n\n“Preserving Georgia’s native plant species is the gift that we leave to future generations of Georgians.”\n\n— Mimsie Lanier\n\nThe Mimsie Lanier Center for Native Plant Studies has secure collections of ten high priority native plant species, and with your help we can ensure that they are preserved for future generations. A gift of $25,000 to the Mimsie Lanier Center for Native Plant Studies will support conservation efforts for your sponsored plant as well as increase our capacity to preserve and protect other endangered species. You’ll become a valued partner in our preservation efforts. Each year we will report to you the progress made on your species, as well as other native plants in Georgia. Your support helps us to strengthen a conservation network across the state that benefits not only the ten species profiled in this effort, but all of Georgia’s plant species diversity. As a very special thank you, the first ten Preservation Sponsors will receive an original painting of their species commissioned in their name."
