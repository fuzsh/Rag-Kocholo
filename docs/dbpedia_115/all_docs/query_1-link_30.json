        "text": "Me and my wife are expecting our first child in a few weeks. We don't know the gender so we're creating lists of names for girls and boys. We were thinking of plant related names as we both love gardening and nature.\n\nWe've got a few for a girl; Rose, Poppy, Daisy, Iris, Violet, Lily and Ivy.\n\nHowever, we're having problems trying to come up with ones for boys.\n\nSo far we only have William after Sweets Williams. We were thinking of maybe including trees so we could go with Ash or Rowan too.\n\nAre there any we've missed?\n\nUPDATE: Wow, thank you all for the great responses! We've now got too many to choose from. We've got a 'short'list now of: Forest, Florian, Briar, Reed, Heath and Ash. Guess we'll see what they look like on the day."
