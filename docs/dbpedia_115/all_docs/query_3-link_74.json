        "text": "“Move the needle away from just pretty, to pretty and ecologically functional.” That’s year-round gardening advice from Ulrich Lorimer, the director of horticulture at Native Plant Trust, America’s oldest plant-conservation organization, formerly known as the New England Wild Flower Society.\n\nMr. Lorimer’s advice is particularly relevant at the moment, as we head into late summer in a shifting climate. And following it could satisfy a landscape’s diverse constituencies — from gardeners to various animals and insects — who are all focused on one thing: What comes next?\n\nOf course, gardeners want the show — the “pretty” — to continue, but many of us increasingly understand that there are more urgent matters.\n\n“For a lot of insects, birds, other animals, the season of plenty will draw to an end,” Mr. Lorimer said. “There is a frantic push to get as much out of these late resources before they’re gone, whether for those migrating or staying put.”"
