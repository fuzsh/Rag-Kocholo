        "text": "Thanks for all your woodland plant ideas this spring. I added more penstemon after that post. But we also talked asters. The question now is: Which aster?\n\nThe site is as follows:\n\n20 ft long, narrow rectangle running along the sidewalk\n\n30 degree slope\n\nRain and high winds in fall (tornado and hurricane seasons)\n\nDrought in spring and summer.\n\nFull sun on one end: Switchgrass, culver's root, beardstongue penstemon, and other tall plants.\n\nPart sun in the middle: Baptisia australis, Zizia aurea, garden phlox, and Asclepias tuberosa\n\nPart shade (four hours of morning sun) on the other end: Phlox divericata, foamflower, strawberry, calico penstemon\n\nThis shadier side is my problem area. It's dominated by ground cover. But I need tall plants since the rest of the garden is tall. I also need drought tolerance and ability to withstand high winds. I'd like to avoid plants that tend to take over small gardens, so I think zigzag goldenrod is no longer a contender.\n\nI'm thinking about taller drought tolerant asters that can handle some shade. Specifically:\n\nSymphyotrichum laeve (smooth aster)\n\nSymphyotrichum oolentangiense (sky blue aster)\n\nRunner up: Solidago rugosa (not an aster)\n\nAnyone willing to share their experience with these plants in light shade or part shade?\n\nETA: Thank you all so much. I'm planting Solidago rugosa and smooth aster today, as it turns out that I'm out of range for sky blue. For heart leaved aster, I plan to winter sow and move the starts into the garden come spring."
