        "text": "Aster Raine\n\nMission: We at Aster Raine believe that less is more when it comes to skin care products. We strive to create products that are effective for all skin types and genders with as few ingredients as possible. Besides helping you feel confident in your own skin, our mission is to be environmentally responsible as well as giving back. As a small business, we give a portion of our proceeds to young people through education, believing education is vital for the advancement of their future. We support educating young girls and boys in developing countries to advance their bright futures and inspire them to be community leaders. This company exists for three reasons. Authenticity, Affordability, and Empowerment. We believe that when young people are given the opportunity to improve their own lives, society becomes a better place. Helping you feel confident in your own skin is central to our mission.\n\nAuthenticity: We believe our customers care about what they put on their skin. They want to be able to see an ingredient list and know their product has been tried and enjoyed by other people. They want a product that is plant based, that will make their skin feel and look great. We believe this about our customers, because at Aster Raine, we want the same things. Our products were developed and tested with our customers in mind. We personally tested our products on those we love, family and friends, because we want to provide a product inspired by love.\n\nAffordability: The developers at Aster Raine are hardworking women, some of us are moms. We often sacrifice our own care, as we strive to meet the needs of others. We want our skin care products to be affordable. We want them to feel like a luxury at a bargain price. Our customers are just like us. They don’t want to spend a fortune on skin care either. At Aster Raine, we strive to keep our expenses low, so we can produce high end products at affordable prices.\n\nEmpowering the Customer: As human, we all struggle with confidence from time-to-time. Great looking skin can boost our confidence. This product can help those with aging skin look radiant. The more skin is hydrated and retains moisture, the less wrinkles develop. That’s because skin shrinks when it’s dry. Aster Raine uses non-toxic plant-based collagen, to keep skin moisturized and hydrated. This freshly moisturized look can make skin appear supple and glowing.\n\nEmpowering Others: There are girls and boys who are smart/ambitious but don’t have the financial ability to get an education. At Aster Raine we want to help make dreams come true for girls/boys, and we believe our customers want to empower them too.\n\n10% of Aster Raine profits go to help. Currently the donations will go to Remember Nhu. Find out more about this foundation at www.remembernhu.org\n\nEach Year we will choose a new charity which focuses on educating young people, so check back annually to see where a portion of our sales will go.\n\nProduct FAQ\n\nAster Raine is made in the United States. Our products are plant based/botanicals, and our key ingredient is collagen extracted from clinically proven ingredients.\n\nAster Raine customers are women and men of all skin types who want to take care of their skin."
