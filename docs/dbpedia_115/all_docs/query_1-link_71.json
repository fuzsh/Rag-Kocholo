        "text": "Flowers speak a special language—so much so, there’s even a word for it. Floriography is the art of communicating through flowers and uncovering the symbolism behind our world’s beloved blooms (which started as a hobby back in the Victorian era)!\n\nWhile most flowers have widely accepted meanings, which we’ll get into later, they each have personal meanings worth spotlighting, too—which are just as valid (maybe even more so!). Flowers may symbolize special places, memories and people in your life—think birth flowers, wedding flowers, flowers that remind you of home—and even represent powerful affirmations you want to hold close. Or, hey, maybe you simply find a certain flower aesthetic and pretty. Also valid.\n\nOur Flora collection is a fusion of these ideas: the age-old symbolism of flowers plus their personal meanings, brought to life in elegantly illustrated, hand-stamped jewelry made to grow with you.\n\nReady to bloom? Let’s find the flower necklace & jewellery for you—then we’ll help you create your piece.\n\nWhat do flowers symbolize?\n\nLet’s start with a fun exercise: when you look at a rose versus a sunflower, for example, how do they both make you feel?

What does a rose evoke that a sunflower doesn’t (and vice-versa)?\n\nMost of us will find that roses evoke a deeper, richer, more romantic feeling, while sunflowers are bright, happy and vibrant, like sunshine incarnate—but it gets much deeper and more interesting than that.\n\nAnd what about lesser-known flowers and foliage—like gardenia, hellebore, lotus, olive branch? Which best represents or inspires you, and has it been hiding in plain sight all this time?\n\nThere are over 300,000 flowering plants across the globe, but our Flora collection (including our birth flower jewelry!) features 30 gorgeous florals and foliage that mean the most to us, because we think they’ll do the same for you, too.\n\nJump to a flower or foliage to learn about its meaning:\n\nAster | Baby’s Breath | Camellia | Carnation | Cherry Blossom | Chrysanthemum | Cosmos | Daisy | Daffodil | Dandelion | Forget-Me-Not | Freesia | Gardenia | Hellebore | Iris | Lotus | Lavender | Lily | Monstera | Olive Branch | Orchid | Peony | Poppy | Ranunculus | Rose | Snowdrop | Sunflower | Tulip | Wildflower | Willow\n\nSpecifically looking for birth flowers or birth flower jewelry?
