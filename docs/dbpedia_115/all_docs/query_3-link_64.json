        "text": "Summary\n\nDid you know?\n\nSaltmarsh aster is the only native aster in New York which is an annual (Brouillet et al. 2006). The scientific name subulatum means awl-shaped (Fernald 1970) and is perhaps in reference to the shape of the involucral bracts.\n\nState Ranking Justification\n\nThere are currently 13 known extant populations. At least an additonal 18 populations have not been seen in recent years and are considered historical. One population is believed to have been extirpated due to habitat destruction. Some of the historical populations occur in and around the New York City metropolitan area and have likely been extirpated. Overall, the habitat for this species is limited in New York and much of this habitat has been damaged or destroyed.\n\nShort-term Trends\n\nOne population has become extirpated within the past 20 years. There is very little other data available to indicate what the short-term trends are for this species in New York. Overall, it appears that this species may be at least slightly declining in recent years.\n\nLong-term Trends\n\nAt least one population in New York has become extirpated. At least an additional 18 populations have not been seen in recent years. Many of these historical populations are from around the New York City metropolitan area and have likely become extirpated. Some of the historical populations may still be extant but simply have not been searched for recently. At least five out of the 13 extant populations are very small in numbers with 50 or fewer individuals in the populations. While populations of this species may naturally be small these very low numbers for an annual may indicate that these populations are declining. Overall, this species appears to have declined in the past 100+ years.\n\nGeneral Description\n\nSaltmarsh aster is an annual herbaceous plant that grows up to 1 m in height. The stems become branched towards their summits. Its narrow linear leaves are scattered along the stems. Like all members of the sunflower family the \"flowers\" are actually clusters of numerous small flowers (flower heads). These flower heads occur at the summit of the plants and are composed of yellow disc flowers (the central inner flowers) and white ray flowers (the marginal outer flowers) (Gleason and Cronquist 1991, Brouillet et al. 2006).\n\nBest Life Stage for Proper Identification\n\nSymphyotrichum subulatum is best identified when it is in flower. The underground taproots are useful in its identification and voucher specimens should include these if the population is large enough.\n\nSimilar Species\n\nSymphyotrichum tenuifolium var. tenuifolium (perennial saltmarsh aster) is a somewhat similar aster that also grows in salt or brackish marshes in New York. It is in the same subgenus (Astropolium) as S. subulatum. Symphyotrichum subulatum can be distinguished by its annual habit, taproot, fewer disc florets (4-13), and shorter and narrower ray florets (1.3-3.1 mm long x 0.2-0.5 mm wide) vs. perennial habit, rhizomes, more disc florets (25-54), and longer and wider ray florets (4.5-9.5 mm long x 1.2-2.0 mm wide) for S. tenuifolium (Brouillet et al. 2006).\n\nSymphyotrichum ciliatum (rayless annual aster) is a non-native species in New York that occurs in salt-influenced habitats such as roadsides although it may also be found in saltmarshes. Like S. subulatum it is an annual. Symphyotrichum ciliatum differs in its sparsely ciliate involucral bracts, strigose achenes, and lack of ray florets (truly only lacking the ray of the ray florets) vs. non-ciliate involucral bracts, glabrate achenes, and distinct although small ray florets for S. subulatum (Semple et al. 2002, Brouillet et al. 2006).\n\nBest Time to See\n\nSince saltmarsh aster can easily be overlooked when vegetative, the best time to survey for this species is from August through mid-October when it is in flower.\n\nFlowering\n\nThe time of year you would expect to find Annual Saltmarsh Aster flowering in New York.\n\nAnnual Saltmarsh Aster Images\n\nImages of Similar Species\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nBest Identification Reference\n\nBrouillet, L., J.C.
