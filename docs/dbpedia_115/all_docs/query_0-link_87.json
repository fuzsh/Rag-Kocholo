FORMERLY ASSISTANT EDITOR OF \" CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA.\" VOLUME IV, BOSTON: ESTES & LAURIAT, 301 WASHINGTON STREET. 1878. ■J Eelp (Old Eng. gilp, 'dust,' 'powder') is the ashy residue left in burning in the open air various species of seaweed. It was formerly very much employed as a source of soda and potash salts for manufacturing purposes, and at that time K.- burning was an important industry in the northern and western islands and coasts of Scotland. The introduction of new chemical processes, and the discovery of new sources of these alkalis, has nearly extinguished the K. industry, and it is now only prepared for the extraction of iodine and bromine as primary products. The IC of different seaweeds varies much in composition, that obtained from Lajninaria digitata and L. saccharina being rich in iodine ; Himanthalia lorea yields potash salts chiefly, while the product of Fucus vesiculosus and F. nodosus abounds in soda. These seaweeds are thrown up on the coast, or collected during low water, and after drying in the sun are ignited and slowly burned at as low a temperature as possible, to avoid the dissipation of volatile iodides. The K. is dissolved in water, and concentrated by evaporation till the carbonates, chlorides, and sulphates of sodium and potassium crystallise out ; the remaining mother-liquor contains the iodine and Bromine (q. v.). Mr. E. C. C. Stanford has patented, and works near Glasgow, a process by which he avoids the use of K. proper in the preparation of seaweed products. He submits the dried seaweed to destructive distillation in closed vessels, by which, in addition to securing the whole of the iodine and alka- line salts, he obtains a residue of charcoal valuable for sanitary purposes. Law Regarding K. — The introduction of this article in the manufacture of glass gave ri^e to several questions as to the right to make it. It has been found that the taking of K. is not one of the uses for which the shore is held by the crown in trust for the public, and consequently the right is not inalienable by the crown, but is transferred to the granter, where land is granted bounded by the sea or seashore. Eel'so (anciently Kalchu, or Calchoii, supposed to be from Chaikheiigh, the name of a precipitous bank still so called), a town of Scotland, in Roxburghshire, beautifully situated on the N. bank of the Tweed, and opposite the embouchure of the Teviot, 5 miles W.S.W. of Coldstream, on the English border, and 45 S.W. of Edinburgh by rail. It consists mainly of four streets, radiating from a spacious market-place, on which stands the town-hall, built in 1816, and many well-built houses and elegant shops. The principal feature is the ruined Tironensian Abbey (1128-1152), partly in Norman and partly in Early Pointed style, shaped like a Greek cross, with the axis surmounted by a massive square tower 91 feet high, resting on four lofty centred arches, and four piers of clustered columns. It was the first endowment of David I., and its abbots long disputed precedence with the priors of metropolitan St, Andrews, and even with the parent-house of 228 Tiron in France. The abbfey was destroyed by the English under the Earl of Hertford in 1545. On the opposite bank stood Roxburghe Castle, a famous Border bulwark, the slight remains of which are all that is left of vi hat was formerly one of the four chief Scottish towns. A fine bridge connects K. with its southern suburb of Maxwellheugh. Floors Castle, the splendid seat of the Duke of Roxburghe, designed by Vanburgh in 1718, lies one mile N. of K., amid policies of unwonted beauty. K. has slight industries, but is the seat of important corn and cattle maikets, and has four annual fairs. Pop. (1871) 4564. Kem'ble, John Philip, a great English actor, son of a theatrical manager, was born at Prescot, Lancashire, February I, 1757, and educated at Roman Catholic schools, at Sedgeley Park and Douai, France. He made his debut at Wolverhampton in 1776, and played for seven years in country theatres. He first appeared at Drury Lane on September 30, 1783, as Hamlet. K. was manager of Drury Lane, 1790-1801, and sub- sequently of Covent Garden. He retired in 1817, and died at Lausanne, in Switzerland, February 26, 1823. K.'s place as an actor is second only to Garrick's. Noble in appearance, stately in elocution, grand in manner, he was the most classical of tragedians. He had a cultivated literary taste, and was the author of Lodoiska, an opera, Bclisarius, a tragedy, and several comedies and essays. See Boaden'sZz/i'ij/\"^'^ P. Keinble (1825). — Charles K., brother of John and of Mrs. Siddons, was born at Brecknock in Wales, November 25, 1775, and educated at Douai. He made his debut at Drury Lane in 1794, and leit the stage in 1840, on being appointed Examiner of I'lays. He died Novem- ber 12, 1854. K. had a handsome appearance, and excelled in genteel comedy. His daughter. Miss Fanny Kemble (born in 181 1), has maintained the dramatic traditions of her house. — John Mitchell K., son of Charles K., was born at London in 1807, and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1830. Three years after, he published The Anglo-Saxon Poem of Beowulf: a translation of Beowulf, 'with acopious Glossary, Preface, and Philological Notes' (1837); Codex Diplomaticus yEvi Saxonici (6 vols. 1839-48) ; The Anglo- Saxon Charters (1843) ; Dialogue of Salomon and Saturnus (1848) ; Considerations upon the Government of England (1849) ; and, in the same year. The Saxons in England, into which he garnered the best sheaves of his sustained research. State Papers and Correspondence appeared (1857), and Hone Ferales was making its appearance when he died at Dublin, March 26, 1857. It was afterwards published in 1863, under the editorship of Latham and Franks. Kem'pen, a town in the province of Diisseldorf, Prussia, 27 miles N.W. of Diisseldorf, has manufactures of silks, cottons, KEM KEN linens, and hosiery, and was the birthplace of Thomas a Kempis. Pop., (1875) 5390. — K. or Kempuo, a town in the province of Posen, Prussia, on the Silesian frontier, 47 miles N.E. of Breslan, with breweries wax-refineries, and tanneries, and a bri^>k trade in horses and cattle. Pop. (1875) 6267. Kem'pis, Thomas h, or Thomas Hamerken (Malleolus), born at Kempen near Diisseldorf, about 1380, was the son of a labouring man and a village schoolmistress. He studied grammar and plain chant with ' The Brothers of Common Life ' at Deventer, and in 1 399 entered as a novice among the canons-regular of Mount St. Agnes near Zwoll. Here he devoted himself to copying such works as the Bible, the Missal, and the works of St. Bernard. Fifteen years were spent on a copy of the Bible in 4 vols, folio. He also wrote some devotional works, of which the best known are Xh^Soliloqiiium Anitnce, and the Hortidiis Rosariim, both trans- lated into English by Flower in 1853. There are also modern Oxford editions of K.'s works in Latin. He died July 24, 1471. See Busch, Chronicon Windeshemense. It was long supposed that K. was the author of De hiiitation: Christi, per- hajis the most popular of all devotional works, which Corneilie translated into French verse, and on which Dr. Chalmers wrote an essay prefixed to Payne's translation in 1822. This book was also attributed to John Gerson, Chancellor of Paris University (1363-1429). But it is now almost certain that a similar book of tlie same name was in the family library of the ancient Ilaiian family De Advocati or Avogadro of Biella (' Defenders of the Church' from the 7th c.) long before K. was born ; and the evidence of the Codex Aronensis, and of other old MSS. and printed editions, is to the effect that it was written by John Ger- sen, or John of Cavaglia, Abbot of Vercelli. See Alemoire siir le Veritable Auteur de P Imitation, by the Chevalier de Gregory ; Introduction to Benham's Translation (Macmillan & Co. 1874), and Authorship of the De Imilalione Christi, by the Rev. S. Kettlewell (Lond. 1877). Kemp'ten, a town of Bavaria, on the Iller, 66 miles S.E. of Munich, is a walled place divided into two quarters, the upper of which (Neustadl), inhabited by Catholics, arose round the abbey founded by Hildegarde, wife of Karl the Great, has the finely- domed church of St. Peter, whilst the lower or Protestant quarter (Altstadt) was formerly a free imperial city, and is now the seat of trade ; its cotton- works employing 37,000 spindles and 680 looms, besides which there is a considerable trade in linen. Pop. (1875) 12,681. K. is the ancient Campodunum, and on its southern side is a lofty Roman tower, the medieval Hilarmont, now known as the Burghalde. The town was stormed by the Imperial- ists in the Thirty Years' War (1633), and again by the French in the War of the Spanish Succession (1703), and near it the French were defeated by the Austrians, September 17, 1796. Een, Thomas, an English prelate and hymnist, born at Berkhampstead, Herts, July 1637, and educated at Win- chester and New College, held the livings of Brixton in the Isle of Wight (1666), and of Wordhay, Hants, the latter with a prebend of Winchester (1669). In 1675 he visited Rome, and on his return was chaplain successively to Mary of Orange at the Hague (1679), to Lord Dartmouth at Tangier (1683), and to Charles II. (1684). Raised to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, he attended Charles in his dying moments, as also Monmouth on the scaffold, was one of the ' Seven Bishops' (16S8), but as a nonjuror was deprived of his see (1689), and retired to Longleat in Wiltshire, where he died March 19, 1710. K.'s Works {4 vols. 1721) are mostly forgotten, but his Morning and Evening Hymns live on the lips of thou- sands. See his Life by J. L. Anderdon (Lond. 1853). Ken'dal, or Kir'by Kendal {i.e., ' Kendal in the dale of the Ken or Kent '), a town of England, in Westmoreland, on the Kent, 20 miles N. of Lancaster by rail. It has a large parish church, restored in 1868, a market-hou.se, a grammar-school (founded in 1525), a mechanics' msiitute, a museum, a theatre, &c. The chief industrial products are linseys, carpets, hosiery, doeskins, tweeds, lining-stuffs, paper, leather, iron- wares, beer, fish-hooks, and combs. Tliere is an important weekly market. Pop. (1871) 13,446. K. sends one member to parliament. It was a market-town by licence of Richard I., and by a settlement of Flemings in the reign of Richard III. became the seat of a flourishing manufacture of woollen cloths, which are still well known as ' Kendals.' The town was incorporated by Elizabeth in 1576. Interesting antiquities are the ruined castle of the barons of K. , and the Castle Law Plill, crowned by an obelisk erected in commemoration of the Revolution of 1688. Ken'ilworth, a market-town of England, in Warwickshire, 4 miles N. of Warwick by rail, is chiefly famed for its castle, built in the reign of Henry I. Here Edward I. founded a second Round Table, and Edward II. was deposed. John of Gaunt enlarged it, and through his son, Henry IV., it reverted to the Crown. Conferred by Elizabeth on Dudley, Earl of Lei- cester, it was for seventeen days the scene of the gorgeous enter- tainment given to that sovereign (1575), described in Scott's Kenilworlh. Cromwell dismantled it in the Civil War, but its ruins are still the finest in England. Pop. (1871) 3335. Kenn'icott, Benjamin, D.D., a biblical critic, bom at Totnes, Devonshire, 4th April 171 8, succeeded his father in the mastership of a charity school-, till in 1744 some gentlemen sub- scribed to send him to Wadham College, Oxford. As an under- graduate he published Two Dissertations on the T?-ee of Life and on the Oblations of Cain and Abel (1747), which gained him a fellowship at Exeter College. He received a pension of £100 (1761); was successively appointed Radcliffe librarian (1767), prebendary of Westminster (1770), canon of Christchurch, and rector of Culham ; and died at Oxford, September 18, 1783. His first great work, 7he State of thi Hebrew Text of the Uld Tes- tament Considered (Oxf. 1 753), gave an account of all the He- brew MSS. known to be extant, and prepared the way for his Velus Testamentum Hebraici4m cum variis Lectionibus (Oxf. 1776), which was based on a collation of 600 Hebrew and 16 Samaritan codices. He was the author of nine other works, mostly on textual criticism. Ken'sington Gardens, a beautiful wooded park, forming an extension W. of the Serpentine of Hyde Park, London. The grounds (210 acres), which are intersected by fine avenues radiating in the form of a star, are a favourite and fashionable lounge. To the W. is Kensington Palace, the birthplace of Queen Victoria. In the south-eastern angle stands the magnifi- cent Albert Memorial. Kent ('the land of the Cantii '), a maritime county in the S.E. of England, is bounded N. by the Thames and the Tliames' estuary, S. by Sussex, W. by Surrey, and E. by the Straits of Dover. Area, 1627 sq. miles; pop. (1871) 848,294. It is a bold promontory, terminating in the Isle of Thanet (q. v.), and the coast, low and sandy in the N. and S., presents to the W. between the N. and S. Forelands, and opposite the Goodwins (q. v.), a line of high chalk cliffs. On the N. lies the Isle of Sheppey (q. v.). The surface is for the most part undulating, and is traversed from E. to W. by the Nor'h Downs (see Downs), but in the S. is low and unbroken, including the Weald and the Romney Marsh. Tiie formation is Tertiary in the N., chalk and greensand in the E. and centre, and wealden, a fresh- water deposit, in the S. K. is watered by the Medway, the Stour, and the Darent, has a mild climate, and a singularly fertile soil, producing an unusual variety of crops. In 1876 there were 240,205 acres under corn crops ; 81,712 under green crops; 61,179 under clover, sanfoin, and grasses in rotation; and 294,377 in permanent pasture, exclusive of heath or mountain- land ; also 30,076 horses, 66,284 cattle, 957,707 sheep, and 59,658 swine. The chief crops were wheat, oats, barley, beans and peas, turnips, hay, potatoes, mangold, and garden stuffs ; while 44,755 acres were under hops. The orchards yield cherries, plums, filberts, &c., for the London markets. The county returns six members to parliament. The county town is Maidstone ; other places are Canterbury, Greenwich, Wool- wich, Chatham, Sheerness, Gravesend, Margate, Ramsgate, Tunbridge Wells, Dover, Hythe, and Folkestone. K. is especially rich in historical associations; its principal ecclesias- tical structures are the cathedrals of Canterbury and Rochester, Aylesford Priory, and St. Radigund's Abbey near Dover. See Hasted's History of K. (4 vols. 1778-99). Ken'tigern, St., or Mungo {i.e., 'dear friend' of St. Col- umba), the successor of St. Ninian as apostle of Cumbria (q. v.), according to tradition was born 518 A. D. of a virgin, St. Thenew, daughter of Llew or Lothus, a semi-pagan prince of Lodoneis or Lothian. Educated by St. Servanus at the monastery of Culross, he was ordained bishop of the newly- founded see of Glasgow at the age of twenty-five, and laboured ten years for the conversion of the heathen, the recovery of KEN THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KER apostates, and the confirmation of the faithful, till in 553 Mor- ken of Stiathclwyd expelled him from his kingdom, to seek a refuge in Wales, where he founded Llanelwy or St. Asaph. He was recalled in 573 by Rhydderch Hael (Roderick the Liberal), was for eight years bishop at Hoddelm, returned to Glasgow in 581, and paid seven visits to Rome during the papacy of Gregory I. (590-604). The date of his meeting with Columba at the Slolendinar is uncertain, but must be placed before 597, that being the year of the latter's death. K. himself died in 603, and over his grave rose the cathedral of Glasgow, the arms of which city perpetuate three renowned miracles of this its patron saint. We have two lives of K., written the one by a foreign ecclesiastic during the episcopate of Herbert of Glasgow (died 1 164), the second and longer by Joceline of Furness some twenty- £ye years later, both of which were edited by Bishop Forbes of Brechin in vol. v. of The Historians of Scotland (Edinb. 1874). Joceline's book is a string of conventional miracles, varied Ijy contests with the secular power, in which the saint always comes ofif victorious. It is valuable, however, as the only record, with any show of authenticity, of the obscure history of Cumbria, and as forming a link between the legendary and historic periods — Arthur and Laloecen (Merlin) appearing in its pages side by side with characters whose history is beyond challenge. Een'tish Fire, rounds of applause, a term which owes its origin to the No-Popery meetings held in Kent, to protest against the Roman Catholic Relief Bill (1828-29). Kentish Hag, a tough calcareous durable building stone, developed in the Hythe Beds, a local formation belonging to the Lower Greensand of the Cretaceous Period. Kent's Cavern, a celebrated cave in the limestone rock near Torquay, Devonshire. It consists of two parallel series of galleries, the shorter of which is over 250 feet in length. Its floor deposits have been very fully described by a committee appointed by the British Association in 1864. Flint and bone implements, such as chisels, spoons, spear-heads, rings, pot- sherds, &c., have been obtained, evidently contemporaneous with the remains of living or recently extinct animals. The bones of the follov/ing mammals have been discovered in the red cave-earth which forms the fifth deposit in descending order: cave- lion, wild-cat, cave-hyaena, wolf, fox, badger, cave-bear, grizzly bear, brown bear, mammoth, rhinoceros, horse, bison, Irish elk, red-deer, reindeer, hare, water-vole, bank-vole, and beaver. Kentuck'y, a central state of American Union, in the Missis- sippi valley, is bounded N. by Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana; S. by Tennessee; E. by Virginia and W. Virginia; and W. by Missouri. Area, 37,680 sq. miles; pop. (1870) 1,321,011. The Mississippi forms the western and the Ohio the northern boundary. The surface is table-land in the W., hilly in the S.E., where the Alleghanies have an elevation of 3000 feet, and in the centre is occupied by the valleys of the K., Licking, Green, Cumberland, Tennessee, and other rivers. The formation is Tertiary in the VV., and Devonian and Silurian in the S. The coalfield of Illinois is continued into K., and has an nggregate area of 14,000 sq. miles in the latter State. Among other minei- rals extensively distributed are iron, lead, silver, salt, lime, and sandstones. The principal geological attractions in K. are the salt spring of Big Bone Lick, 60 acres in extent, with its thou- sands of huge fossil skeletons, and the famous Mammoth Cave, which is only one of thousands that are not so widely known. Saltpetre, gypsum, and syenite abound in the caves. The cli- mate is generally delightful, and the soil is extremely fertile, yielding (1873) rich crops of Indian-corn, wheat, rye, oats, bar- ley, cotton (1080 bales), flax (237,268 lbs.), hemp (7777 tons), tobacco (105,305,869 lbs.), maple, sugar, potatoes, &c. Other large products are silk-cocoons, wool, cheese, and butter. In January 1876 the number of cows in K. was 244,700; of other cattle, 389,600 ; of sheep, 683,600. The chief manufactures are iron and iron goods, tobacco and cigars, machinery, leather, and woollens, and there is extensive flour and saw milling, mining, brewing, and distilling. In 1875 there were 1519 miles of rail- way in operation. Frankfort is the capital. K. is an Indian name, meaning 'the dark and bloody ground.' The country was first settled by Boone (q. v.) in 1769, was organised as a territory in 1790, and admitted as a state two years later. It was frequently the scene of active hostilities, and its inhabitants were almost equally divided in sentiment during the Civil War. Ke'okuk, a city of Iowa, U.S., on the W. bank of the Mis- sissippi, near its confluence with the Des Moines, 90 miles S. E. of Iowa, with which it is connected by rail. It is at the foot of the lower rapids, and at the head of navigation for the larger steamers. From its position in the extreme S.E. corner of the state it is called the ' Gate City.' It has twenty churches, a medical college, a court house, public library, &c. The chief occupation is pork-packing, and there is a large wholesale trade in dry goods, groceries, &c. A splendid iron rail and highway bridge 2300 feet long spans the Mississippi. The government is constructing a ship canal 9 miles long skirting the lower rapids. Pop. in 1850, 2478, in i860, S136, and in 1870, 12,766. Kepler, Joh.ann, the celebrated astronomer, was born at Magstatt, near Weil in Wiirtemberg, December 27, 1 571. He studied at Tubingen with a view to entering the Church, but under the tuition of Majstlin, Professor of Mathematics there, and a disciple of Copernicus, he became a devoted student of mathematical and astronomical science, and resolved to abandon theology. In 1594 he became Professor of Mathe- matics at Gratz in Styria. His first publication was a calendar for 1595, and in 1596 appeared h'\\s Mysteriiim Costnographiciim, which abounds in fanciful analogies between the different parts of the universe. In 1599 he quitted Gratz on account of reli- gious persecution, and on the invitation of Tycho Brahe went to Prag to aid that astronomer in his labours. On Tycho's death in 1601 K. was nominated Astronomer to the Emperor Rudolph, and in 1614 settled at Linz. After the death of his patron he was constantly in pecuniary difficulties, notwithstand- ing his many efforts to obtain a liquidation of his claims upon the imperial treasury. It was in 1630, on one of these fruitless endeavours, that he was seized with the fever which ended his life on November 13, in Ratisbon. K.'s great work is his Astronomia Nova (1609), containing the remarkable book Dt Motibus Stellae Martis, which prepared the way for Newton's later discoveries. The reduction by him of Tycho's observation of Mars, begun with a view to the publication of the Rudolphine Tables, soon showed the impossibility of representing the re- volution of Mars by uniform circular motion, and led to the dis- covery of his first law, that planets move in ellipses, of which the sun forms a focus. His second law, that the radius vector of a planet sweeps over equal areas in equal times, was a happy conjecture based upon the observed fact that at the apsides the times of describing equal small arcs were nearly proportional to the distances of the planet from the sun. The third law, that the square of the periodic time is proportional to the cube of the mean distance from the sun, was discovered only after numerous efforts to establish other numerical relations which his lively fancy had suggested. Newton showed that the mathematical consequence of the second law was that the planets moved under the action of a force directed to a fixed point, and that the first law led as infallibly to the conclusion that this force varied inversely as the square of the distance from the centre. See Gravitation. His other chief works are Paralipomena ad Vitellionem (1604) ; Epitome Astrojiomiie Copernicce (2 vols. 1618-22); De Cometis {l6ig) ; and Tabulcz Rudolphina (1627), .which are famous as the first tables calculated with elliptic elements. His manuscripts were purchased for the library of St. Petersburg, but have never been published. One volume of his correspondence entitled Epistolce ad J. Keplerum was edited by Hausch in 1718. The best edition of K.'s works is that by Frisch (8 vols. Frankf. 1858-71). See Breitschwert, A'.'j Leben und Wirken (Stuttg. 1831) ; Brewster, Lives of Gali- leo, Tycho de Brahe, and Kepler (Lond. 1841). Later German biographies are those of Reitlinger ( 1 8685 and Rtuschle (1871). Ker'guelen Land, or Desolation Island, is in the S. Indian Ocean, and was discovered by the French navigator Ives Joseph de Kerguelen Tremarec in 1772. Christmas Har- bour, at the N. extremity, is in 48° 11' S. lat., 69° 3' E. long. The island is 100 miles long and 45 miles broad on an average, but is deeply indented by inlets. Its surface is rugged, and lakes are numerous. Fossil wood is plentiful, and coal is also said to exist. See Notes of a Voyage to K. L. to obset-ve the Transit of Venus, December 1874, by the Rev. S. J. Perry (Lond. 1876). Kerguelen's Island Cabbage is a perennial ciniciferous plant first brought into notice by Captain Cook, and since his I day has proved a very acceptable addition to the rations of KER THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KET many a ship's crew, as a wholesome aud agreeable vegetable. From botanists it has received the name of Piinglia anti- scorbulica, being a powerful antiscorbutic. The whole plant is rich in a pungent volatile oil, giving a sort of muslard-and- cress flavour to the leaves, and a taste somewhat like horse- radish to the long roots. The leaves in continuous growth are crowded cabbage-like into heads, beneath which the annual flower-stalks arise. These heads are cooked, and eaten in the same way as ordinary cabbage. Formerly supposed to be con- fined to Kerguelen Island where it ascends the mountain to 1400 feet, but luxuriates most on the sea coast ; it is now, however, known from the Challenger expedition to grow in Tristan d'Acunha, and one or two other islands. Kerman', or Kirman (anc. Carmania), a province in the S.E. of Persia, lies between the Great Salt Desert and the Per- sian Gulf, and is bounded W. by Fars, and E. by Seistan and Beluchistan. Area about 59,000 sq. miles ; pop. estimated at 600,000. It is occupied in the N. by the Great Salt Desert, and in the centre is traversed by mountains between which and the sea lies the unhealthy hot country or Garmsar, a belt of saline sand, from 10 to 30 leagues broad, producing only inferior dates. There is no river in K., and but for the few mountain springs and karezes or aqueducts the natives could not live. — The town of K., capital of the province, lies in the central mountain region, at an elevation of 5000 feet. It is girt with a high mud wall and a ditch 20 yards wide, has a governor's palace, a large bazaar, with elegant domes of a blue stone, and some ten cara- vansaries within the walls, and many inferior ones outside. Its shawls (which rival in delicacy those of Cashmere), carpets, matchlocks, and namads or felts are famed all over Asia. The trade consists in the exchange of the manufactures for dyes, drugs, skins, metal wares, firearms, tea, European cloths, &c. Pop. 30,000. K. was formerly the greatest trading city of Persia, has frequently been plundered and destroyed, and its trade has suffered much from the rise of Bushire (q. v.). Kermansliah.', the chief town of a district of the same name in Persia, on the Kerkhah, 250 miles S.W. of Teheran. It is surrounded by ruined walls, and has a palace and beautiful gardens, but is in great part gone to decay. It is of strategic importance, is governed by a prince of the blood, has an arsenal, and a garrison of 5000 regular troops. Its trade and manufactures are now things of the past. Pop\". 12,000. Ker'mea, or Alkermes, the name given to the dried bodies of female insects of various species of coccus, which like the cochineal insect yield a brilliant red dye-stuff. The K. dye has been known and used from the most remote antiquity. It is referred to in Scripture as well as by many classical writers, but the introduction of cochineal, after the discovery of America, has very largely superseded it ; and it is now only used locally in the East, and in the countries in which the insects occur. Four species are used : Coccus ilicis or common K. ; C. poloiii- cus, or Polish grains ; C. fragaria and C. uvaursi ; and these find their principal use among the Moors, Turks, Persians, &c. Kermes Mineral, a tersulphide of antimony with a small proportion of antimony trioxide, and sulphide of potassium or sodium. It is much used in Continental medicine as a dia- phoretic and emetic, occupying there the position held by James' Powder in British pharmacy. Ker'ner, Andreas Justinus, a German poet, born at Lud- wigsburg in Wurtemberg, September 18, 1786, studied medicine at Tiibingen, and after some years' travel settled down to a practice at Weinsberg. He died February 21, 1862. As a poet, K. belonged to the ' Swabian School ; ' his poems are marked at times by melancholy pathos, and again by fresh and vigorous humour. The best-known are Reiseschatten (181 1), Gedichtc (1826), and Letzter Bliithenslrauss (1852). His medical works — notably Die Seherin von Prevorst {1829) — are mainly devoted to animal magnetism. Kerowli [Karauli), the chief town of the native state of the same name in Rajputana, India, 80 miles S.W. of Agra. It was founded in 1348, and is surrounded by a sandstone wall. It con- tains a beautiful palace, and a temple of Krishna, which attracts many pilgrims. — The state ai K., which lies along the left bank of the Chumbul River, has an area of about 1870 sq. miles; pop. 124,000; army, 3625 men; revenue, 50,000. The counti7 is wild and hilly, and contains many old forts. The late Rajah was conspicuously loyal during the Mutiny of 1857. Kerr'y (Irish Gael. Ciarj-aidhe, the country belonging to 'the race of Ciar, ' a son of the legendary King Fergus), a county in the S.W. of Munster, Ireland, is bounded N. by the estuary of the Shannon ; S. by Cork and the Kenmare River ; W. by the Atlantic ; and E. by Cork and Limerick. Area, 1, 185,918 statute acres ; pop. (1870) 196,586. The coast line, 220 miles long, is deeply indented by Tralee and Dingle Bays, and is fringed with the Skeliigs, the Blaskets, Valentia, and other islets. K. is for the most part mountainous, containing in the Macgillicuddy's Reeks the highest peaks in Ireland (Cam Tual, 3414 feet). The mountain ranges are of red oj grey sandstone, overlaid in the lower parts by stratified limestone. Flags and slates are extensively exported to London from Valentia. The hydrography comprises the rivers Laune, Maine, and Cashan, and the famous Lakes of Killarney (q. v.). In 187 1 the surface included 152,689 acres of tilled land, 638,149 of pasture, 15,101 of plantation, 31,882 of water, and 348,097 of mountain, bog, and waste. The climate is mild ; the chief crops are barley, potatoes, turnips, oats, and flax. Other important products are fish, cheese, butter, and cider. The county sends two members to Parliament. Tralee is the capital, and other towns are Killarney, Listowel, and Dingle. K. is traversed by the Great South- Western Railway to Tralee. Ker'sey, a coarse woollen fabric, usually ribbed, principally manufactured in the N. of England, though originally made at Jersey, of which name K. is probably a corruption. Kertch, a seaport of the Crimea, on the Strait of K., forms with Yenikale, 5 miles higher up the strait, one township, having a total pop. (1870) of 22,449. K., which is built in the I'orm of an amphitheatre at the foot of Mount Mithridates, was sacked by the Allies in 1855, and the importance of its port was much curtailed by the closing of the Black Sea to the Russians (1856), but is now reviving. In 1875 1983 vessels of 766,623 tons entered, and the value of imports (tobacco, tea, nonware, &c.) was ;{^57,66l ; of exports (grain, butter, horses, cattle, &c.) 1 3 5, 663. K. is the ancient Panticapa:um, a Milesian colony, and in its museum is a splendid collection of antiquities discovered in the neighbourhood. It was the capital of the kmgs of Bosporus, was annexed to the Roman empire (63 B.C.), and fell successively under the Huns (375 A.D.;, Genoese (I280), Turks (1475), and Russians (i774)- \"Kestrel {Tiniiunculus alaudarius), a familiar spe;ies of Bri- tish hawk, distinguished by the peculiar attitude in which it hovers motionless in mid-air, with wings and tail outspread, on the watch for p' ey. From this peculiarity it has received the name of 'windhover.'^. The colour is an ashen grey \\ above, marked with streaks of deeper grey: brown tints pre- vailing in the female. The average length is 14 inches; the females being larger than the males. The nest is usually placed on rocky heigh ts and in ruined buildings. The eggs number three or four, aud Kestrel, are of a reddish-brown colour. The K. preys largely upon field-mice, moles, and other quad- rupeds. Kes'wick, an ancient market-town of England, in the county of Cuinberland, on the Greta, and near the head of Derwent- water, may be considered the capital of the Lake district, and is a central point for tourists. Brewing, tanning, and the manu- factuie of woollens, hardware, and lead pencils are the chief in- dustries. Southey resided here for forty years at Greta HalL Pop. (1871) 2777.

KET THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KHA Ketch.'up, or Cat'sup, a sauce much used with meat and fish, die name of which is said to be derived from the Japanese Kitchap. Common or mushroom K. is prepared by mixing and stirring together fresh mushrooms and common salt for two or three days, after which the juice is lightly squeezed out. To every gallon of juice obtained half an ounce of cloves and mustard seed are added, and an ounce each of allspice, ginger, and black pepper. The mixture is gradually raised to the boil- ing point and left to macerate for fourteen days, when the liquid is stiained off and is ready to bottle for use. Many other varieties of K. are prepared, among which may be mentioned zvalnuiYL., tomato K., oyster K., and wine K.

A pair of kettle-drums are commonly used in the orchestra, tuned to the tonic and dominant of the key. Keu'per, the highest member of the Triassic, or New Red Sandstone series. In Britain it rests upon the Bunter Sand- stones (q. v.), but on the Continent it is separated from these by tlie Muschelkalk (q. v.). Its base consists of dolomitic conglo- merate, which passes into thinly laminated sandstones and marls, and the whole is surmounted by the Red Marl Series, which frequently contains beds of gypsum and rock salt. The fossil species are few in number. Encrinus liliiformis and Tere- hratula vulgaris are characteristic crinoids. Belemnites, ammo- nites, and Crustacea are represented ; fishes and reptiles (Masto- donsaurus, N'othosauriis, crocodiles, &c.) occur, and the Microlestes antiquus may be cited as a characteristic Continental mammal. Kew (a corruption of Kayhoo, ' the quay on the spit of land'), a parish in Surrey, on the Thames, opposite Brentford, 7 miles W. of Charing Cross. Pop. (in 1871), 1033. The Royal Botanic Gardens, 300 acres in extent, form one of the attractions of London, and contain the finest collection of exotic plants in the world. There are many conservatories, a palm house, 362 feet by 100 ; a winter garden, 212 feet by 137 ; a museum, and an observatory. Key, Delivery of. In a sale of merchandise, deposited in a cellar or wareroom, delivery of the key of the place in which the goods are deposited is held to be equivalent to actual deli- very of the articles to the purchaser. Possession by the seller of a master-key does not alter the case. In the transference of goods in a bonded warehouse, certain entries in the custom-house books are directed to be made by special statute. Key (mus.) (l) A lever or other mechanical contrivance in the pianoforte, organ, flute, &c., by which the performer can operate on distant parts of the instrument. (2) The wrest, by which instruments with metal pegs are tuned. (3) The sign in notation usually called by the equivalent name e/ef. (4) That relation of six principal tones to a seventh (called the key-note), which is the foundation of modern music. On the pianoforte, seven white notes (or digitals) upwards from C (inclusive) con- stitute a pattern ; other keys are to consist of similar intervals. If the minor mode be regarded as a distinct K., seven notes upwards from A, all white except G (which is altered to G^), will give a pattern. But there is no separate signature for the minor K., either in the above form or in that in which two notes are sharpened in the ascending, and restored in the descending scale. Key, or Ke Islands (pron. K), a small group in the Banda Sea, between 5° and 6° S. lat., and in about 133° E. long. They consist chiefly of two islands, Great and Little K., the former of which measures 50 miles by 10. The islands are very mountainous and densely timbered. They are inhabited by Papuans, and by a mixed race who profess Mahommedanisnu The inhabitants trade in trepang, wild nutmegs, and tortoise- shell, but especially excel in boatbuilding. They annually turn out some hundreds of boats, some of 30 tons each, of which Mr. A. R. Wallace says they ' can hardly be surpassed for beauty of form and goodness of workmanship.'

Keys, in Heraldry, as the emblem of St. Peter, are often borne — indorsed, interlaced, or in saltire — in the arms of sees or religious bodies dedicated to that saint. Borne singly, the key is commonly in pale, with the wards in chief. Keys, Power of the, is the authority claimed by the Christian priesthood to administer the ordinances of the Church, and communicate or withhold its privileges ; and is so called from the words of Christ to Peter in Matt. xvi. 19. It is main- tained that the power here promised was afterwards conferred on St. Peter and the other apostles by Christ (John xx. 22, 23). In the Roman Catholic Church the P. of the K. is applied to the power of granting Absolution (q. v.) in the sacrament of penance ; the claim to do which has a better foundation on Matt. xvi. 19 than Protestants are willing to allow. Arch- bishop Tillotson got rid of the difficulty by supposing that the power of knowing men's hearts must have been one of the mira- culous gifts of the early Church. The phrase also means the supreme authority of the Church, which is vested in the Pope. St. Peter's keys represent his power in heaven, earth, and hell. In the Papal arms the golden key represents the power of abso- lution, the silver one that of excommunication. Key \"West (a corruption of the Span. Cayo Hueso, ' bone reef), a town of Florida, U.S., on an island of the same name, has a good harbour, seven churches, and three cigar-factories, which employ 2500 Cuban refugees. Fishing and sponge- gathering are the other principal industries. The pop., which has been much increased of late years by immigrants from Cuba and the Bahamas, is estimated at 9000. — The island, 7 miles long by I to 2 wide, is of coral formation, and nowhere attains an elevation of 20 feet above sea-level. Kliamgaon, a town in the district of Akola, Berars, India, 370 miles E. of Bombay, with which it is connected by a branch railVvay, 8 miles long, opened in 1870, joining the Great Indian Peninsula system : pop. (1867) 9432. K. is officially described as 'the largest cotton mart in all India.' It de- spatches annually about 100,000 bales, collected from the sur- rounding country. In 1870, there were nine European firms, two factories for cotton cleaning, three steam-presses, and four half presses worked by hand. Each pressed bale contains about 3^ cwt. The native traders are chiefly Marwaris from Rajpu- tana, and representatives of Bombay firms. Besides cotton, there is a considerable trade in English piece-goods, salt, opium, and ghee ; wheat is imported. The town only dates from 1820. Khan (properly khaghan, and given as cham by our older writers), a Mongolian title of supreme authority, assumed by Genghiz (q. v.), and adopted by his successors ; also, a Persian word for a Caravanserai (q. v.), introduced into English through the crusaders in ' balcony ' and ' ha.rh\\can.

Kharkov' (formerly t\\\\s Sslobodish Ukraine, i.e., 'the border- land '), a government in the S. of Russia, lies to the N. of Jek- alerinoslav, and has an area of 20,737 sq. miles, and a pop. (1870) of 1,681,486. It is watered by the Donez, a tributary of the Don, and by its affluents, one-fourth of the surface yielding grain, while 13 per cent, is covered with dense forest. Besides grain the chief crops are tobacco, potatoes, flax, and hemp, and there is great abundance and variety of fruits. The principal s KHA THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KHO industries are horse and sheep rearing, silk culture, corn, and brandy distilling. Two lines of railway connect it with the northern inarl<ets and the Black Sea. — K., the capital of the above Russian government, at the confluence of the Donez, the LiOpan, and the Kharkova, 415 miles S. of Moscow by rail. It is one of the finest cities in the E. of Russia, and has seventeen churches, a cathedral with a clock-tower 312 feet high, a uni- versity (since 1804), with a library of 50,000 vols., botanical gardens, &c. , a government house, two gymnasia, numerous mansions of nobles and wealthy traders, a beautiful public gar- den, and a new theatre. The great fourteen days' winter fair of K. begins with a market at which are assembled some 10,000 horses, and attracts merchants from all parts of the empire, and as many as 80,000 sledges. The value of the furs, silver wares, tea, coffee, sugar, and other wares brought to the fair is 40 million roubles. Pop. 81,028. Khartum' ('the promontory'), a town of Upper Egypt, at the confluence of the White and Blue Niles, in a sterile desert lone, and 150 miles N. of the grassy region. It is the residence of a governor-general, and headquarters of the Upper Nile ivory traders. In 1871 were erected a large number of brick buildings, and a spacious quay on the banks of the Blue Nile. There are extensive gardens and rows of old date-palms, but the health of the town suffers from part of it lying below the high-water level, and being occasionally covered with stagnant pools. Besides the transit trade with the interior, the chief in- dustry is the building of 'neggers,' the peculiar boats of the Upper Nile. Pop. 30,000. Elhasi, or Cossya Hills, a tract in Assam, on the N. E. frontier of India, lying between the Garo and Naga hills. Area, with the Jyntia hills,' 6157 sq. miles; pop. (1872) 141,838. It consists of twenty-five small confederated states in qualified de- pendence on the British Government. The chiefs are elected for life by the votes of their tribesmen. Their total gross revenue is estimated at ^^^6475. The food crop is rice ; the exports are elephants, cotton, timber, caoutchouc, and lime. Khatmandu', the capital of the state of Nepal, India, on the W. bank of the Baghmutty River, amid the Himalayas, about 60 miles N. of the British frontier ; estimated pop. 50,000. It contains a large number of temples of brick and wood, with gilded pinnacles. The British Resident lives here with an escort of 100 native infantiy, and it is the only place in Nepal which is known to Europeans. K. is the centre of a considerable trade, which converges here from India and Thibet. ■ — The valley of K., which for fertility and scenery has been compared with the valley of Cashmere, contains three successive capitals of Nepal. Its area is 300 sq. miles ; its pop. about 400,000. See History of Nepal, ed. by Dr. W. Wright (Cam- bridge, 1877). Khaya is the name of a lofty Senegambian tree [K. Sme- galitisis) with a wood like mahogany, to which family it belongs. The bark is used as a febrifuge. Khedive', the official title since 1 867 of the Viceroy of Egypt. The first K. was Ismail, son of Ibrahim Pasha. Kher son, a government of Russia, on the Black Sea, between Taurida and Bessarabia. Area, 27,497 sq. miles; pop. (1870) 1,497,995. It is hilly and well wooded in the N. and W., but in the E. it forms part of the saline steppe. About half of the surface is uncultivatable, while one-third is pasture, and one- fifth is cultivated. Bounded on the E. and W. by the Dniester and Dnieper respectively, it is watered by the Bug, Ingul, and Ingulez. The climate is one of extremes. The chief crops besides grain are flax, hemp, and tobacco. — K., capital of the government, on the right bank of the Dnieper, above its estuary of Liman, 115 miles E.N. E. of Odessa. In 1778 it was founded by Potenikin, and was only prevented from becoming the chief town of S. Russia by the shallowness of the Dnieper's mouth. It is strongly fortified and has ten churches, a navigation school, two wharfs, some shipbuilding, and an export trade of timber, grain, woollen, tallow, hemp, flax, &c. Important industries are wool-washing and the raising of melons and water-melons. Pop. (1870) 46,320. The Dnieper is here frozen from about 24th November to 12th February. Khi'va (the anc. Chorasmia), a khanate of Turkestan, which formerly extended from the Sea of Aral on the N. to Persia on the S., and had an area, mostly desert, variously estimated at 6 from 54,000 to 195,000 sq. miles, and a pop., stated with equal uncertainty, at from 480,000 to 2,600,000. By a treaty con- cluded after the Russian occupation of 1873, the Khivan territory E. of the Amu-Daria (anc. Uxus) was ceded to Russia, and the boundaries of the khanate were fixed as the Amu-Daria on the E. from Kukertli to the Sea of Aial and the 'ancient bed of the Oxus' S.VV. to the Caspian. The khan exercises no practical sovereignty beyond the oasis of K. , which has an area not ex- ceeding 30,000 sq. miles, and a pop. of 280,000. The Amu flowing through the midst of the oasis irrigates large tracts by means of many artificial canals. Steady, intelligent culture has converted much of the oasis into a smiling garden, and among the products are abundance of wheat, rice, cotton, apples, peaches, pines, pomegranates, and melons. Frost prevails from October to April, but the midsummer heat is excessive ; in December the Amu and Aral are covered with ice. Domestic animals are plentiful, including the horse, camel, and ass. The inhabitants of K. are chiefly Tajiks, Aryans, of affinity with the Persians, and of settled industrious habits ; but the Uzbeks, a Turkish tribe, are the ruling people. The desert nomads are Turkomans, or Yomats, Kirghis and Karapalkacs. The Tajiks have fine, intellectual features, full brown beards, and a lighter complexion than the Persians. Most of them can read and write, and they are very clever as merchants, artizans, constructors of irrigation works, and agriculturists. The chief manufactures are woollens, silks, shawls, brass utensils, and earthenware. A large trade is carried on by caravans, chiefly with Orenburg and Astrakhan, and with Bokhara by exchanging European for Chinese and other Oriental merchandise. The Khivans are mostly Sunnite Mohammedans ; they show an elegant taste in poetry and music, and have a considerable literature of songs and romantic tales. The ancient Chorasmia was subject successively to Bactria, Parthia, and Persia, and became a monarchy with the name of Kharesm or Khorasm, under a Seljuk dynasty in 1092. I'he Kharesmians conquered the whole of Persia and Afghanistan, but were in turn subjected by Genghis Khan in 1221, by Tiniur in 1370, and by the Uzbeks in 151 1. Two Russian invasions (of dates 1717 and 1854), were wrecked in the deserts. In 1873, however, the ill-treatment of Russian captives afforded a pretext for a campaign which was skilfully conducted by General Kauff- mann (q. v.), and which ended in the taking of the capital on the loth of June. The Khan Seid Mohammed tendered his sub- mission, and a treaty subsequently concluded abolished the slave- trade, fixed the frontier, deprived the Khan of the power of making treaties with foreign powers, imposed an indemnity of _;^3io,ooo, and secured that the Turkoman tribes should be punished for continued hostilities against Russia. In accordance with promises made to England, the independence of K. was recognised. In 1875 the Russians again occupied the capital, by request of the native ruler, who had been unable to maintain order. The Russian domains in Turkestan, including the ceded portion of K., have been formally converted into the ' Trans- Caspian Territory,' with the capital at Krasnovodsk, a newly established port of the Caspian. The capital of the khanate is also named K. ; other towns are Gorten, Gazavat, and Kiat Urghendj. K. is an irregular walled town, with a citadel, a rude palace, bazaars, a college, and several mosques. Most of the buildings are mud-built. Pop. about 9000. See Vambery's Central Asia, (1874) ; Spalding's K. and Turkestan (1874) ; MacGahan's Campaigning on the Oxus and the Fall of K. (1874) ; Hellvvald's Russians in Central Asia (Eng. transl. Lond. 1874) ; and Schuyler's 'Jurkistan (Lond. 1876); and Captain F. Bur- naby's Ride to K. (Lond. 1876). Khoi, a town in Azerbijan, Persia, 77 miles N. W. of Tabrez, stands in a fertile valley. The houses are of mud, but the bazaars of brick are, next to those of Shiraz, the finest in Persia. Cloths, linen, caps, socks, and copperware are the chief articles of trade. Near K. 30,000 Persians, under Shah Ismail, defeated 300,000 Turks, under Selim I. (1514), and the town was held by a Russian garrison (1827-28). Pop. 25,000-35,000. Khojend', a Russian town in Central Asia, on the Sir-Daria, 80 miles S. of Tashkend. It is girt by a well-armed double wall on all except the river side, and is considered the key to the Turkestan valley. Its transit trade is extensive. Pop. 20,000. K. formerly belonged to Khokan, but after a seven days' siege it surrendered at discretion to the Russians, June 6, 1866. KHO TJI£ GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KID Khokau', a khanate of Central Asia, lying between the Russian government and Si'r-Daria in tlie N., and Kashgaria in the S. It is about l6o miles long and 60 wide, is separated by the Thian-Shan mountains in the S. from the basin of the Amu- Daria, and lies chiefly in the valley of the Slr-Daria, with an average elevation of 1500 feet above the sea. The climate is one of extremes, and the soil is extremely fertile and well irri- gated, yielding abundance of rice, wheat, cotton, barley, hemp, flax, tobacco, madder, &c. K. is famed for the richness and variety of its fruits ; all the towns and villages are embowered in orchards and mulberry groves. In 1872 over 200,000 lbs. of silk were exported to Russia. Other products are turquoise, iron, coal, petroleum, and naphtha. The inhabitants, mostly Uzbeks and Tajiks, are extensively engaged in sheep-shearing. — K., the capital, is situated on the Sir-Daria, has 360 mosques, is guarded by a mud-wall and a ditch, and has a pop. of 5000. Other towns are Namangan and Andijan. The khanate of K. was formerly of far greater size, but the western part, with the cities of Tashkend and Khojend, was annexed by Russia in 1865-66. According to a Russian report, it had in 1872 an area of 28,270 sq. miles, and a pop. of 800,000. After the war of 1866, Russia replaced the Khan Khudayer, who was thenceforth little more than a vassal of the Czar. A rebellion in 1874 against the khan, stirred up by Yakub Khan, Amir of Kashgar, led to another Russian invasion, under General Kaufmann, and the annexation of most of K. to the N. of the Sir-Daria in 1875. Khorasan', the north-eastern frontier province of Persia, lies between the Khivan Desert on the N.E., and the Great Salt Desert on the S.W., and is bounded E. by Afghanistan, \\V. by the province of Mazanderan. Area, 150,00c sq. miles. The province is mountainous, consisting of narrow valleys, shut in by bare rocky hills, of which there are three distinct systems — the Elburz range in the N., a spur of Mount Elvand in the W., and in the S. a continuation of the Hindu Kush. The only rivers of importance are the Atrak, Tejand, and Pulabre- sham. The climate is extremely varied, as also is the soil, the northern districts being the most fertile, and yielding abundance of corn, gram, and rice. Among the manufactures are arms, stoneware, woollen and cloth goods, carpets, and velvets. Me- shid (the capital), Astrabad, Yezd, and Nishapur, are the chief towns. The pop., of which we have no trustworthy estimate, is a mixed one, comprising Persians in the centre, Kurds and Turkomans m the N., and Arabs in the S. Khorsabad'. See Nineveh. Khos'ru (Gr. Chosroes) I., surnamed Nushirvan ('noble- mind'), one of the gieatest rulers of the Sassanid dynasty in Persia, succeeded his father Kobad in 531 A. D. during a war with the Greeks, and two years after wrested from Justinian an annual tribute of 440,000 pieces of gold. In 540 began a second war, of vaiying issues, which lasted till 562, when Jus- tinian agreed to pay a tribute of 40,000 pieces of gold, retaining Colchis and Lazica. A third war dates from 571, but before its close K. died, March 579. Persian writers make K. a model of wisdom and justice, and his last lessons to his son and successor Hormuz IV. have been celebrated by Saadi and several other poets. — K. II., Purviz ('Generous'), succeeded his father Hormuz IV. in 591, and was the most powerful of all the Persian rulers. In a career of victory (603-616), he spread his empire from Chalcedon to Ethiopia and Yemen ; but the suc- cesses of Heraclius (q. v.) as quickly turned the scale. K. lost all his conquests, and his own son Siroes imprisoned and mur- dered him, 28th February 628. See Sir J.

Khundwa' (Khandwa), the chief town of the district of Nimar, Central Provinces, British India, 352 miles N.E. from Bombay; pop. (1872) 14,119. It is a station on the Great Indian Railway, and the terminus of the Indore State Line, which is now (1877) being continued through Rajputana; as such, it is the centre of a growing transit trade. K. is a place of great antiquity, the town being built on a mound which is full of ruins of old Jain buildings. It was burned by Tantia Topee during the Mutiny in 1858. Khuzistan', a province of Persia, in the extreme S.E. corner, is bounded N. and E. by Luristan and the Bakhtiari mountains, S. by Fars and the Persian Gulf, and W. by the Shat-el-Arab and the pashalic of Bagdad. Area, 25,677 sq. miles. In the S. is a chain of limestone hills, ranging in height from 2000 to 5000 feet, and the whole province is well watered by numerous im- portant streams — the Karun, Dizful, Kerkhah, &c. Next to cattle-rearing agriculture is the chief occupation, rice, tobacco, corn, and cotton being extensively grown. Among the articles of trade are tents, woollens, naphtha, and cottons, and dyeing is an important industry. Shuster (the capital) and Dizful are the principal towns. The pop. of K. is composed mainly of nomad tribes, those in the S. being of Arabian descent. Khy'ber {Khaibar) Pass, the defile which leads from the N.W. frontier of India into Afghanistan, about 33 miles in length, and in one place not more than 10 feet wide. It is bordered by precipitous hills, occupied by vi'ild tribes of the Afredee stock ; the rock is mostly slate, and a mountain torrent runs down the pass. It commences at Kadam, 10 miles W. of Peshawur, and terminates at Duka at the entrance to the plain of Jellalabad. The K. P. is the most practicable route into Afghanistan. During the Afghan war of 1839-42, it was re- peatedly forced by the British, and formed the scene of their most disastrous loss. Traders only now pass, on condition of paying a fixed black-mail. See Havelock's War in Afghanistan (Lond. 1840). Khyrpore' [IChairptir), the chief town of the native state of the same name in Scinde, India, 15 miles E. of the Indus; estimated pop. 10,000. The state of K. has an area of 6109 sq. miles; pop. (1872) 130,350. The land revenue, which is paid in kind, at the rate of one-third of the gross produce, amounts to about ^^45,350. The exports have been returned at ^'52,500, the imports zx£l'],^oo. The country, which extends from the left bank of the Indus into the desert of Rajputana, is only cultivated where irrigated by canals. The ruling Mahom- medan family of Beluchi origin, established in 1783, was the only branch of the Ameers of Scinde allowed to exist after the British conquest in 1843. See Gazetteer of Scinde (Lond. 1874). Kiacll'ta, a town of Russia, Siberia, in the government of Trans-Baikal, touching the frontier of the Chinese Empire, and 180 miles S.E. of Irkutsk. It is guarded by a fortress, has government and customs buildings, and was the sole mart for the Chinese trade from its foundation in 1727 till the treaty of Pekin (i860), which permitted commerce along the whole fron- tier. The trade, which is carried on by fairs, sometimes amounted in value to eight million dollars, but has greatly decreased of late. Pop. 5000. Kiang-Chu, or Kiung-Chow, a port of China, on the N. side of the island of Hainan, opposite Hoi-on on a peninsula of the mainland. It was declared open to foreign commerce in 1858, but it was only formally opened by proclamation of 24th March 1876. Its chief exports are sugar (much of which comes from Hoi-on), leather, ground-nut cakes and oil, sesamum and melon seed, and betel nuts ; its imports, opium, cotton and woollen goods. In the half year ending 30th September 1876 the port was entered by 23 steamers of 11,955 tons, and cleared by 22 of 10,996. Most of the trade is with Hong-Kong. Pop. about 200,000. Kiang-Si, a province in the S.E. of China, lies W. of the Tajiiling Mountains. It is watered by the Kia-Kiang, which enters the large lake Pojang-hu in the N. by innumerable branches. The surface is hilly, and the Yang-tsi-Kiang forms part of the N. boundary. The chief town is Nan-Chang. See Chinese Empire. Kiang-Su, a province of China bordering on the Yellow Sea, at the delta of the Yang-tsi-Kiang. It is the richest and most populous province in the capital ; its surface is low and flat, and the soil is extremely fertile, yielding much sugar and rice. It is watered by the net-work of streams into which the Yang-tsi divides, and by the H6ei-ho, which expands into several large lakes. Nan-King, is the capital, and the treaty ports are Chin- Kiang and Shanghai. See Chinese Empire. Kidd'erminster, a town of England, in the county of Wor- cester, on the river Stour four miles from its confluence with the Severn, and 125 N.W. of London by rail. It is the chief Eng. lish centre for the manufacture of the, finest Brussels and velvet. 7 THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPAEDIA.

Kid'napping is the offence of carrying oflf a child or adult. When free from certain intent, K. is only a misdemeanour punishable with fine and imprisonment. See Abduction. Kid'ney is a glandular organ concerned in the secre- tion of urine. In the humi.n body there are two, situated one on each side of the vertebral column, at the upper and back part of the abdomen. They are on a level with the last vertebrae of the dorsal region and the upper two or three lumbar vertebrae. The right has in front of it the peritoneum, the as- cending part of the colon or large bowel, and also at its upper part a por- tion of the liver. The left has in front of it the descending part of tlie colon, and is in contact, to the left, with the spleen. Each K. is about four inches in length, two inches in breadth, and ■'u about one and a half inches in thickness. Each has a convex border externally, and a concave border near the middle line. In this concave border there is a marked fissure or cleft, and to tliis the term hilus (h) is applied. In this hilus the renal artery, vein, and the duct or tube, the ureter (u), which carries away the urine from the K., are situated. The nerves and lymphatic vessels also enter into the substance of the K. through this fissure. On dividing the K. into two equal parts, by cutting it from its convex to its concave border, two distinct parts can be noticed. A part next the hilus, the medullary part, and a part further away, the cortical part {a). The medullary part is darker in colour than the cortical, and appears distinctly striated, these striae converging to certain points near the hilus. Hence the appearance of a number of pyramitls, the apices of which are directed towards the hilus, and the bases towards the cortical part. Attached to the sides of these pyramids, about midway between the apices and the bases, and completely enveloping the apices, vre have the commencement of the excretory duct or ureter. This duct within the hilus is dilated into a bag, which is moulded upon the papilla;, and thus appears to have on it cup-like depressions. This bag-like dilatation of the ureter is called the pelvis (/), and the cup-shaped depressions, calyces {c). The cortical portion of the K. is not striated ; it covers the medullary portion, and portions of it extend downwards between the pyramids. It has a granular appearance and is easily torn. On examining the medullary portion by means of the micro- scope, the striated appearance is found to be due to this part being made up of tubes, the uriniferous tubules, placed side by side. These tubes cominunicate with the pelvis of the K. by a number of openings situated upon the apex of each papilla, and in the bottom of the calyces. Traced into the substance of the K. these tubes are found to become convoluted when they pass beyond the limits of the medullary portion into the cortical por- tion, and finally they end by the bag-like enlargements, the Malpighian corpuscles. These tubules have a diameter varying from ij-i^th to -rJ^th of an inch, and the Malpighian corpuscles a diameter of Tj^th of an inch. The tubules are seen to be composed of an outer wall of con- nective tissue, the basement membrane, and lining this inter- nally, epithelial cells which, in the straight portion of the tube, are columnar in form, but in the convoluted portion, are more or less globular. The Malpighian corpuscles have al.so this basement membrane, but the epithelium is of a scaly or flattened 8 form. The kidneys are supplied with blood by two large arteries, the renal arteries, liefore entering the hilus of the IC each artery breaks n\\ up into two or three ^^^il^'^*^ branches, which again subdivide, and pass into the sub- stance of the K. be- tween the pyramids. On arriving near the bases of the pyra- mids, the branches communicate by means of arches which are formed here between con- tiguous vessels. From these arches branches are given off which pass on- wards between the straight tubes, and finally pierce the wall of the Malpig- hian corpuscles. At this point the artery receives the name of affereht\\e^ie\\. With- m the corpuscle the afferent vessel breaks up into a loop of ca- pillary vessels. The blood in these is col- lected into a single vessel, the efferent vessel, and this pierces the capsule of the corpuscle. After leaving the Malpighian corpus- cle this efferent ves- sel breaks up into a capillary plexUs which surrounds the convoluted tubes, and this plexus pours its blood into larger vessels, the comineiice- ment of the renal vein. By means of this vessel the blood is conveyed to the inferior vena cava, and so to general circulation. Recent observations have shown that, surrounding the smaller vessels, we have spaces filled with lymph which communicate with the general lymphatic system. Further, the convoluted tubules do not directly become continuous with the straight tubules, but after ceasing to run a convoluted course, they dip down and form a loop, the lower end of which is situated in the medullary part, and then ascend into the cortical part again. This looped tube joins at a right angle with the straight tubule. See diagram (h). Each K. is enclosed in a fibrous capsule. This capsule is so loosely connected with the substance of the K. that it can readily be separated, except at the hilus, where it becomes united to, and continuous with, the pelvis. The pelvis and ureter consist of a fibrous coat, a middie coat of muscular fibres, and an external coat of columnar epithelium. The nerves which are distributed to the kidneys are derived from the lesser splanchnic nerves, and from the renal plexus. The manner in which they terminate in the K. has not been made out, but from the effect which has been produced upon cutting them in the lower animals, it is very probable tliat they are distributed in the main part to the muscular coat of the arteries, and regulate the amount of contraction or dilatation of these vessels. Certain of the nerves are also probably distri- buted to the lining of the tubules, and regulate the activity ol the secreting cells. The chief modifications in the structure of the K. of mammals consist in the absence or alteration in the shape of the pyramids. In many mammals the K. consists of an aggregation of a number of smaller kidneys, each of these presenting a division into a medullary and a cortical part. The general character of the fluid secreted by the kidneys will be considered under article Urine, but it is necessary here to state that we have in urine Diagr,im of the course of uriuiferous tubules. KID THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KIB water containing in it certain organic and inorganic substances. The organic substances are chiefly urea and uric acid ; the inor- ganic, chlorides of sodium and lime, sulphates of potass and soda, and phosphates of lime and magnesia. The organic sub- stances are separated from the blood by the action of the cells lining the convoluted tubes by a process of secretion. The water and inorganic salts are separated from the blood by a process of filtration, this process occurring within the Malpighian corpuscle. Anything which alters the amount of pressure within the afferent or efferent vessels, will alter the amount of water and inorganic salts separated. Normally, the efferent vessels have a smaller calibre than the afferent, and hence there will be a greater pres- sure in the afferent than in the eflferent. Again, the pressure normally is greater within the blood-vessels than in the Mal- pighian body. If, by any means, the pressures in the afferent and eflferent vessels and the Malpighian body be equalised, the process of filtration will be stopped. The separation of the water and salts is influenced by physical conditions. The separation of the urea and uric acid is a vital process, dependent upon the functional activity of the epithelial cells lining the tubules. Diseases of the K. — The kidneys are subject to various affec- tions, the most important of which is that known as Bright s Disease (q. v.), characterised by intense congestion, with exuda- tion and haemorrhage into the tubes, and desquamation of the epithelium. Inflammation of the K. or Nephritis is also of frequent occurrence, and one or more of the tissues may be affected, as the nerves, the vessels, the parenchyma, or the interstitial connective-tissue. In addition, the cortical sub- stance, the pyramidal, the pelvis of the kidney, or all parts together may be affected, and the affection may be partial or diffused. The parenchymatous tissue is generally implicated, in the first instance, and afterwards, the interstitial tissue, which sometimes undergoes fatty or amyloid degeneration. The diag- nosis of these affections is difficult during life, and can be effected only by chemical tests and microscopic examinations of the urine. Most of these affections may terminate in suppuration, which may also depend upon morbid conditions of the blood, external violence, retention of urine, or calculi in the kidney or ureters. The most frequent symptoms of U. of the K. are more or less pain in the region of these glands, shooting along the ureters ; a sensation of numbness down the thigh ; pain in and retraction of the testicle ; frequent desire to void urine, and more or less febrile symptoms. D. of the K. are all of a very serious nature, more especially those of an acute form ; but even the chronic forms greatly impair health, and ultimately cause premature death. Suppuration is the most rapidly destructive of all the lesions, and is generally considered to be a fatal disease. Neu- ralgia of the kidneys is not of very frequent occurrence, and the affection, so termed, usually depends upon the passage of a con- cretion through the ureter, one of the most painful of all diseases. The pain comes on in paroxysms, with intervening periods of comparative ease, and is usually accompanied by vomiting, pro- fuse perspiration, and a small and feeble pulse. Suppression of Urine, or Ischuria, although generally a mere symptom of other diseases, is in some cases an independent or idiopathic affec- tion, there being either a complete cessation of the secreting action of the kidney, or such a diminution as to indicate morbid action. If no urine be separated from the blood, the urea re- tained acts as a poison on the nervous system, causing coma or intense stupefaction, which invariably terminates in death, unless the action of the kidneys be restored. For further information on D. of the K., see Bright's Disease, Addison's Disease, Diabetes, Calculus, Nephritis, and Uraemia. Kidney Bean. The common K. B., French bean, or haricot, is Phaseolus vulgaris, largely cultivated for human food both in tropical and temperate regions. Its native country is supposed to be India, from whence it may have come to Europe through the conquests of Alexander the Great. It varies from a low, almost bushy sub-erect plant, to one with stems that twine 6 to lo feet. As far back as English trustworthy garden records go, it has been grown in that island for the pods, which in the young green state are the most delicate legume in cultivation. They also make an excellent pickle. On the Continent of Europe the ripe seed, called haricots, is largely used, and when properly selected and cooked they are strongly recommended as an article of food, from their digestive and antibilious qualities. The scarlet ninner {P. tnultifloi-us) is grown for the same purpose as the K. B., and is 229 remarkably prolific. The pretty ripe beans, however, are un- wholesome, or even in some degree poisonous, and the root con- tains a narcotic poison. It is a native of Central America, whence it is stated to have been introduced into Europe in 1633. The genus Phaseolus — distinguished by the keel of its flowers being prolonged into a very long beak, which forms a complete or nearly complete spiral — numbers in all about sixty species, mostly tropical, but many besides the above are widely cultivated, such as P. Mungo, with nearly cylindrical pods, in India and Africa ; P. lunatus, in all hot climates ; P. perennis, in America ; P. restratus, cosmopolitan within the tropics. Klidney Vetch, the n.-ime given to the genus Anihyllis, belonging to the tribe Lotece of the natural order Leguminosa, from the former reputation of the commonest species, A. vulne- raria, in kidney complaints. The genus numbers about twenty species, distributed through Europe, Asia, and N. Africa, and the above named is not very rare in Britain in dry pastures, &c. It is a good sheep fodder. Kie'kie, the native name for Freycinetia Banksii, belonging to the Pandanroe (screw palms), a lofty climber growing in the northern island of New Zealand. The bracts and young spikes make a very sweet preserve ; the narrow leaves, 2 feet long, are used for basket-making. Kiel, a seaport in the province of Slesvig-Holstein, Prussia, on an excellent harbour at the head of Kieler Hafen, 55 miles N. of Hamburg, has an important trade, manufactures of tobacco, sugar, oil, soap, woollen goods, and machinery, and a university (founded in 1665), with a library of 140,000 vols. Since 1864 its harbour has become an important station for Prussian war-ships. In 1875 there entered the port 3977 vessels, of 332,883 tons, and cleared 4000, of 322,729 tons. K., founded in the nth c, entered the Hanseatic League in the 14th c. On the division of the duchies it fell to Gottorp, becoming in 1713 the seat of the duke and of the Government, but by the deed of exchange in 1773 was joined to the Danish part of Holstein. On the 14th January 1814, Denmark concluded peace here with England, and also with Sweden, which then lost Norway. Kiel'ce, a government of the former Russian province, known as the kingdom of Poland, bounded W. by Piotikov, N. and E. by Kadom, and S. by Galicia. Area, 3897 sq. miles ; pop. (1870) 518,730. K- is one of the fairest and most fruitful parts of Pol.ind ; more than half the surface is cultivated, and one fourth is forest. The chief industries are iron-smelting, tanning, and the preparation of brandy, beer, and flour. — K., the chief town, 100 miles S.S.W. of Warsaw, and surrounded by high mountains, is a bishop's see, and has some copper, mines, great corn-markets, and considerable trade in iron, flour, and wood. Pop. (1870) 11,000. Kie'pert, Heinrich, a geographical scholar and charto- grapher, was born at Berlin, 3 1 st J uly 1 8 1 8, and studied ( 1 836-40) at the university of that city, where he showed the peculiar bent of his mind in designing and lithographing many maps of ancient Greece and Italy for the use of his fellow-students. In 1841 he was sent by Ritter, along with Schaenbom and Loew, on a scientific expedition in Asia Minor, and in 1845 was appointed Director of the Geographical Institute at Weimar, He was called to the Statistical Bureau of Berlin in 1865. His chief works are an Atlas von Hellas (new ed. 1871), A'euer Hand-atlas Uber alle Theile der Erde (2d ed. 1 867, 40 sheets), Bibel-atlas (2d ed. 1854), Atlas Antiquus (5th ed. 1869), and Erdkarte (1863, 38 sheets. These are all more remarkable for their fulness, fresh- ness, and accuracy, than for their beauty of engraving. Kiev, or Kief [Kijev, Polish Kijov), one of the four govern- ments of the Ukraine, Russia, is surrounded by the governments Minsk, Tshernigov, Poltava, Kherson, Podolia, and Volhynia. Area, 19,687 sq. miles; pop. (1870) 2,144,276. K. is a fruit- ful, undulating plain, bounded on the E. by the river Dnieper, which receives from it Pripet, Teterev, Irpin, Ros, and Tjasmin. Corn-growing, cattle-rearing, and beet-sugar manufacture are the chief industries. One quarter of the surface is forest. — K., the chief town, on the Dnieper, 267 miles N. of Odessa, has nume- rous churches (including two cathedrals, one of which, St. Sophia, is the earliest monument of Russian ecclesiastical archi- tecture), great barracks, an arsenal, an exchange, a theatre, and a university (St. Vladimir, founded in 1833), and carries on important manufactures, chiefly of leather, crockery, chemical 9 KIK THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. preparations, and mineral waters.

K. is one of the oldest towns in Russia, was wrested from the Khazars in 864 by com- rades of Rurilt, and made the capital of Russia by Rurik's suc- cessor. Christianity was here proclaimed to be the national religion of Russia in 988, and the place continued to be the seat of the Russian rulers till 1300. It passed under Lithuania in 1320, and in 1650 under Poland, and reverted to Russia in 1686. Kikin'da, or Nagy-Kikinda, chief town of the comitat of Torontal in Hungary, 130 miles S.S.E. of Pesth by rail, is the centre of an agricultural district with large cattle-rearing. Pop. (1869) 18,834. Kil'da, St., the most westerly of the Hebrides, Scotland, lies 60 miles VV. of Harris, is 3 miles long by 2 broad, and has a precipitous coast, indented by two accessible bays. Area (in- cluding several small islets), 4000 acres ; pop. (1871) 71. The surface is hilly, rising in one point to a height of 1 380 feet, and affording pasture for some black cattle and a breed of Spanish sheep whose wool is of considerable value. There was formerly an export of grain, but now the inhabitants import sup- plies, and rough weatiier, by preventing vessels from approach- ing the island, often cause great hardship — notably in the winter of 1876-77. A curious and touching evidence of the stern reli- giosity of the islanders was furnished by the fact that when the relief vessel approached late on a Saturday night, they marched down to the shore with their minister at their head, and be- sought the captain not to break the Sabbath, but to wait till Monday before landing provisions (Scotsman, May 17, 1877), The chief occupations are fishing and fowling, and the exports are wool, salted fish, oil, and feathers. St. K. belongs to the parish, and is under a resident baron bailie. Gaelic is the com- mon language. Kildare', an inland county in the province of Leinster, Ire- land, is bounded N. by Meath, E. by Dublin and Wicklow, S. by Carlow, and W. by Queen's County, King's County, and Westmeath. Area, 654 sq. miles; pop. (1871) 83,614, being a decrease of 30,874 since the census of 1841. With the excep- tion of low offshoots of the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains in the E., and the conical Hill of Allen (560 feet) in the W., the surface is generally flat. The Boyne, Barrow, and Liffey are the chief rivers, and the Bog of Allen (q. v.) covers 36,000 acres in the N. W. of the county. The soil is a deep fertile loam ; the climate, owing to the vast extent of bog, is the moistest of any inland Irish county. In 1871, 138,146 acres were under tillage, 218,035 in pasture, 7585 of plantation, and 53,741 waste, bog, mountain, <S:c. The rearing of stock and manufactures of cotton, woollen, and linen goods, with paper- making, brewing, and distilling, are the leading industries. K. contains limestone and sandstone, and sends large quantities of peat to Dublin. It is traversed by the Great Southern and Western Railway, and by the Grand and Royal Canals. The chief towns are Athy, Naas, Newbridge, and K. The county sends two meinbers to Parliament. Amongst its antiquities are five round towers, three stone crosses, and numerous ruins of castles and religious houses. Eildare (Irish Gael. Cill-dara, ' church of the oak,' see Joyce's Jrish Names and Places, vol. i. pp. 106-7), ^ market- town of Ireland, in the county of the same name, 30 miles S.W. of Dublin by rail. The place is now much decayed, but its former importance is attested by a ruined castle and cathedral, a round tower 132 feet high, and many other antiquities. A weaving-mill, with 150 power-looms, is the only large manufac- tory. Pop. (1871) 2391. — The Ciirragh of K., 3 miles E. of the town, is the most famous racecourse of Ireland. It is 6 miles long by 2 broad, and on it a camp has been formed for 10,000 men. !Kil'ia, a fortified river-port of Moldavia, on the left bank of the K. channel of the Danube, 20 miles from its mouth, has ex- tensive fisheries, and is famed for its caviare. Pop. 6400. Eil'ian, St., the first apostle of the Franks, was an Irish monk who in 686 A. d. left his native land to devote himself to missionary labours, along with twelve companions, among them the presbyter Coloman and the deacon Donatus or Totman. Coming to Wiirzburg in the Austrasian kingdom, he was made first bishop of that place by Pope Conon (687), converted and baptized Gosbert, the Frankish duke, but was murdered (689) by Geilna, wife of the duke and at the same time his brother's 10 widow, whose marriage K. had pronounced unlawful. He is buried in the Neumiiuster Kirche at Wiirzburg, and his anniver- sary falls on July 8th. Kilimandja'ro ('the Great Mountain'), the highest moun- tain in Africa, near the western border of Zanzibar, in the range forming the watershed between the basin of the Nile and tlie Indian Ocean. It is covered with perpetual snow, and is thought to be about 20,000 feet high. Kilkenn'y, an inland county of Ireland, in the province of Leinster, is bounded N. by Queen's County, E. by Carlow and Wexfortl, S. by Waterford, and W. by Tipperaiy. Area, 796 sq. miles ; pop. (1871) 109,479. The surface is hilly. Mount Brandon in the E. attaining a height of 1696 feet, while in the W. are the Walsh Mountains. The chief rivers are the Barrow (q. V.) and its navigable tributaries the Suir and Nore. The soil is argillaceous, affording good tillage and pasture land. In 1871 there were 118,373 acres under tillage, 286,948 in pasture, 11,281 of plantation, and 90,074 of waste, bog, mountain, &c. Agriculture and stock-rearing are the chief occupations, and a once important woollen manufacture has now greatly declined. Anthracite coal of a sulphurous quality is raised from fourteen collieries, and limestone, sandstone, and a fine black marble are extensively quarried. K. returns two members to Parliament. Its only towns with a pop. of over 2000 are K. and Callan. At Dunmore is a remarkable stalactite cavern, and among the antiquities of the county may be noticed the abbeys of Jerpoint and Graig, Grandison Castle, five round towers, and the crom- lech of Kilmogue. Kilkenny, the capital of the county of the same name, Ireland, and itself a county, is situated on the Nore, 28 miles N. of Waterford by rail. It has a Protestant cathedral, dating from the I3ih c, restored in 1864; a Roman Catholic cathedral, erected in 1857; and the Black Abbey Church, which, after lying in ruins since the Reformation, was re- stored in 1864 for the use of the order of St. Dominic There are several other religious buildings, the ancient castle of the Ormonds, a Roman Catholic college, and a gram- mar-school, at which Swift, Congreve, and Farquhar were educated. The linen and woollen manufactures of K. have greatly declined, and its chief source of wealth is now a fine black marble, which is largely quarried in the neighbourhood. Pop. of parliamentary borough (1871), 17,012. K. returns one member to Parliament. K. takes its name from a St. Cain- neach or Canice, who is mentioned by Adamnan, in his Life of Coluniba, and who died in 598. See Joyce's Irish Nantes and Places (vol. i. p. 140). Strongbow founded a castle here (1172), which was destroyed by Donald O'Brien (1193), but rebuilt by William le Mareschal (1195). A great council of barons of the Pale was held at K. in 1294, and its parliament of 1367 passed the Statute of K., abolishing Brehon Law (q. v.). Richard II. was entertained here by the Earl of Ormond (1399), who had purchased the place in 1391. It was taken by the Lan- castrian Earl of Desmond in the Wars of the Roses, and surrendered to Ireton, after repulsing three assaults by Cromwell (1650). Killar'ney (Irish Gael. Cill-air^neadh, 'the Church of the Sloes'), a market-town of Ireland, in the county Kerry, near the N.E. angle of the largest of the lakes of the same name, and 12 miles S. by E. of Tralee by rail. After Tralee it is the chief town in Kerry, and has a modern Roman Catholic cathedral, and several handsome hotels for the reception of the numerous visitors to the famous lakes. There is a slight industry in the carving of articles from the arbutus tree, which grows here wild as in Italy. Monthly fairs are held here. Pop. (1871) 5195. — The Lakes of K. are three in number, and are romantically situated at the N.E. base of the Macgillycuddy's Reeks. They are linked together, and are drained by the Leane, through Castlemain harbour, into Dingle Bay. The lower lake, which is the most northerly, is by far the largest, having a length of 5 miles and a breadth of 3. The upper lake is hemmed in by lofty mountains, opening here and there in beautiful glens, and is studded with woody islets. Killiecrank'ie, The Battle of, was fought in the pass or defile of Perthshire from which it takes its name, 27th July 1689.

But ihe death of Claverhouse in the moment of victory 'broke the only bond which held the Highlanders together, and in a few weeks the host which had spread terror through the Lowlands melted helplessly away.' Kilmar'nock, a town in the district of Cunningham, Ayr- shire, Scotland, 12 miles N.N.E. of Ayr, on a small river of the sa.me name which joins the Irvine close by the town. It is one of the principal stations on the Glasgow and South-Western Railway, and is the southern terminus of the Kilmarnock and Barrhead line, opened in June 1873. has a fine town hall, an opera house, an athenreuni, a large fever hospital, several endowed schools (the Kay's scliools), a public park (obtained in 1877), to be adorned with a statue of Burns, and numerous handsome churches. It has extensive en- gineering works, carpet manufactories, woollen mills, breweries, tanneries, &c. , and is the centre of a rich mineral field. The calico-printing for which the town was noted some thirty years ago is nearly extinct, but block-cutting for floorcloths, wall- papers, &c., is cariied on to some extent. The district of Cunningham has long been famed for its ' butter and cheese,' and K. is now the seat of the greatest cheese show in the United Kingdom. In October 1876 the 22d annual exhibition of dairy produce, and the 14th cheese fair, was held, when 460 tons of cheese were 'pitched,' representing a value of ;^35,ooo. K. owes its name to a St. Marnock (8th c), but is first mentioned in the I2th c. It was made a royal burgh in 1591, and figures hon- ourably in the Covenanting period. The first edition of Burns's poems was published here in 1786 (reprint and fac simile by M'Kie, Kilmarnock, 1867), and the 'Kilmarnock wabsters' are touched off in one of his pieces, the Ordination, with more humour than mercy. K. unites with Dumbarton, Port Glasgow, Renfrew, and Rutherglen in electing a member to Parliament. Pop. (1871) 22,952. About a mile N. of the town are the ruins of the Dean Castle (destroyed by fire in 1735), the seat of the once renowned family of the Boyds, Earls of K. See M 'Kay's History of K. (3d ed. 1864). Kil'ogramme, a French measure of weight equivalent to 1000 grammes or 2'2046 lbs. avoirdupois. Kilrush.' ('the Church of the Wood or the Peninsula'), a seaport and market-town in Clare, Ireland, on a small inlet of the Shannon estuary, 36 miles W. of Limerick and 142 miles W.S.W. of Dublin, is a favourite bathing-place, and has a shel- tered harbour, with considerable trade in fish, corn, turf, and farm-produce. K. has some manufactures of coarse linen^; and woollens, and quarries of stone and slate. Pop. (1871) 4424. Kilsyth', a town in Stirlingshire, Scotland, 13 miles N. E. of Glasgow, and near the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, with stone quarries, and extensive mines of coal and iron. Weaving and paper-making are also carried on. Pop. (1871) 4895. K. was the scene of a crushing defeat of the Covenanters under Baillie, by the Marquis of Montrose, August 15, 1645. Kilwinning, a town in the district of Cunningham, county of Ayr, Scotland, 3 miles N. W. of Irvine, and a station on the Glasgow and Ayr Railway whence a branch line runs to Ardros- san. It is a very ancient place, and consists mainly of one long irregular street. K. carried on at one time an important industry in hand sewing or embroidery, but the inhabitants are now chiefly engaged in mining. In the immediate neigh'oour- hood are the Lglinton ironworks, employing (1877) looo men. Here are the remains of the famous Tironensian Abbey of K., founded in 1 140 by the Constable Hugh de Morville, and dedicated to St. Winning (8th c), from whom the town takes its name. Its last abbot was Gavin Hamilton of the Rosslock family, an ardent opponent of John Knox. The abbey was destroyed in 1560 by order of the Scottish estates, and little sur- vives to enable one to form an adequate idea of the design and magnitude of the structure, or of the richness and splendour of the execution. The present parish church (built 1775) occupies part of its site. The old abbey-steeple (103 feet high) fell August 2, 1814, a few minutes before a band of masons was to have gone to its top to make repairs. K. is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Free Masonry (q. v.) in Scotland. It still con- tinues the ancient game of archery, and has an annual contest for shooting at the Papingo. This game has been practised here for upwards of four centuries. In the neighbourhood is Eglinton Castle, the principal seat of the Earls of Eglinton (see Montgomery, Family of), and the scene of a memorable tournament in 1839. Pop. (1871) 3598. Kimljerley, Earl of, an English statesman, born January 7, 1826, succeeded his father as third Baron Wodehouse, May 29, 1846. He was Under Foreign Secretary, 1852-56; Envoy at St. Petersburg, 1856-58 ; Under Foreign Secretary, 1859-61 ; Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, 1864-66 ; Lord Privy Seal, 1868-70; and Colonial Secretary, 1870-74. His administration of Ireland during a critical period was firm and able. He was created Earl of Kimberley, June I, 1866. Kim'chi, R. David ben Joseph, born at Narbonne in 1 160 (died about 1235), was a celebrated Jewish commentator, gram- marian, and lexicographer. He was the first to discover the dis- tinction between the long and short vowels, and defended a natural and grammatical exegesis at a time when his brethren were almost all enamoured of Haggadic, Cabalistic, and astrological inter- pretations. His principal work was Michlol ('perfection'), which consisted of a Hebrew grammar and a lexicon. Besides which he wrote commentaries on the Pentateuch, the earlier Prophets (Joshua to Kings), the later Prophets (Isaiah, &c. ), the Psalms, Ruth, Chronicles, and Job, and a Refutation of Christianity. Kimm'eridge Clay, the lowest member of the Portland or Upper Oolites (see Oolitic Series), consisting chiefly of blue slaty clays with intermediate bands of sand or calcareous grit. It yields a bituminous clay known as K. coal, which burns with a yellowish smoky flame. Fossil remains of the various inver- tebrate groups and of fishes and reptiles are found — the most characteristic being the lamellibranch species Gryphea virgula and Oitrea delioidea. Kimm'eridge Coal Money, a name given to the circular discs of Kimmeridge shale found abundantly in Dorsetshire by antiquaries, who were long puzzled as to the origin and use of the discs. They are now believed to be the refuse parts of the solid pieces of shale from which the Britons and Romans turned bracelets and armlets. Kim'polung, a town of Wallachia, Roumania, 79 miles N.W. of Bucharest, and 18 S.E. of the Torzburg Pass, in the Carpathians, by which it carries on an active trade with Tran; sylvania. Pop. 10,970. Kinburn', a Russian fort at the confluence of the Bug and Dnieper, which was captured by Suwarrow from the Turks, 28th June 1788, and again from the Russians by the French and English fleets, 17th October 1855. Kincar'dineshire, or The Mearns, a county on the E. coast of Scotland, of triangular form, bounded N. and W. by Aberdeen, S. by Forfar, and E. by the North Sea. Area 388 sq. miles ; pop. (1871) 34.630. It has a rocky coast line of 30 miles, and extends inland 22 miles. On the coast between Bervie and Stonehaven, the two principal towns, are cliff's of 150-300 feet. The E. portion of the Grampians (with Mount Battock, at the W. extremity of K., 2505 feet) occupies the greater part of the county, and terminates in the promontory of Girdle Ness at the mouth of the Dee. To the S. lies the E. part of Strathmore (q. v.), called the ' How o' the Mearns,' a fertile and well-tilled valley of 50,000 acres, and there is also good land in the Dee valley and on the coast. About half of the surface, chiefly consisting of a rich loam, is under cultivation. The prevailing rocks are gneiss and conglomerate on the coast, and granite in the N. In 1876 45,255 acres were under corn, 22,433 green crops, 46,142 under various grasses, and 6126 in permanent pasture; there were 4748 horses, 28,504 cattle, 32,176 sheep, and 2523 pigs. The cod, ling, haddock, skate, and turbot fisheries are bri.sk, but the manufactures, confined to coarse linens, are unimpoitant. K. sends one member to Par- liament. Stone circles, cairns, and memorial stones abound. Roman coins and arms, as well as traces of Roman camps, have been found, and there are several ruined towers of the feudal period, the chief being Dunnoltar Castle (q. v.). Kinemat'ics (Gr. kinema, ' a motion ') is the science of pure motion. It combines the fundamental conceptions of algebra and geometry, and differs from Kinetics (q. v.) in leaving out of account the nature of the bodies used and the forces producing or called into action by the motion. The description of a sur- face by the motion of a line, and of a curve by the motion of a point, are familiar instances of kinematical conceptions. The most interesting cases of the K. of a point are considered under 1 1 KIN THE GLOBE ENCYCLOPEDIA. KIN such headings as Curvature, Cycloid, Epicycloid, Fluxions, Harmonic Motion, &c., and need not liere be particularly adverted to. The great importance of K. lies not, however, in its purely geometrical applications, but in its bearing upon phy- sical phenomena. It forms, indeed, the simplest introduction to mathematical pliysics, and has recently been applied with sin- gular success to the more practical departments of science, such as the theory of machines and engineering generally. The motion of a rigid body or of any relatively fixed system of points is completely determined if the motion of any three points not in the same straight line be so. If any plane figure suffer dis- placement in its plane, the displacement may be accomplished by a rotation round a fixed point in the plane, which is deter- mined by the initial and final positions of any arbitrary line in the figure. A succession of displacements may then be repre- sented by a succession of rotations round a series of points, each of which corresponds to one displacement. By joining these points a polygon is obtained, which is definitely fixed for the given motion. Now, it can be shown that there can be drawn in the figure a second polygon which has its sides equal, each to each, to those of the fixed polygon, and which by rolling upon this fixed polygon gives the complete motion to the figure. By supposing the successive displacements small enough, the sides of these polygons may be diminished indefinitely, and the poly- gons become ultimately for a continuous finite displacement con- tinuous curves. Hence any displacement of a rigid solid in directions wholly perpendicular to a fixed line may be produced by the rolling of one cylinder fixed in the solid upon another fixed in space — the axes of the cylinders being parallel to the fixed line. The point about which the figure at any instant is rotating is called the instantaneous centre of rotation. (See Rotation.) The application of these and other purely kine- matical theorems to the theory of machines has been given in an admirable treatise on I'heoretische Kinematik (1874-5) by Professor Reuleaux of Berlin, translated by Professor Ken- nedy of University College, London (1876). See also Pro- fessor Kennedy's Kinetnatical Models, one of the science lectures delivered at the South Kensington Loan Exhibition in 1876. Another very important class of kinematical problems will be considered under the article Strain. K., with many of its applications to the theory of curves and surfaces, forms the first preliminary chapter of Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy. Kinet'ics is the branch of Djmamics (q. v.) which investigates the motions of a material system resulting from the action of given forces, or discovers the combination of forces necessary to produce a given motion. The simplest problems are those which relate to the motion of a single particle under the action of a single force, and for problems of this nature Newton's first and second laws of motion (see Motion, Laws of) are neces- sary and sufficient. The introduction of conditions of restraint, such as that the motion takes place in a resisting medium or along a definite path, results only in increasing the difficulties of the mathematical analysis. When, however, the motion of two or more particles in physical connection is to be investigated, a further principle is necessary, which is fully supplied by New- ton's third law. In the scholium to this law Newton reckons the forces of resistance against acceleration as reactions equal and opposite to the actions which produce the acceleration. In other word?:, all the forces acting upon a system form with the reactions against acceleration an equilibrating set of forces; and this is the explicit statement of the principle enunciated by D'Alembert in 1742, and still known by his name. Its symbolic representation enables us to write down at once the equations of motion for any system for which the equations of equilibrium have been investigated. This principle Lagrange made the basis of his Mkanique Analytique {1788), a work which con- tains theorems of extraordinary beauty and generality, and is to be ranked along with Newton's Principia (1687) and Laplace's Mecanique Cileste (1798-1825). To Laplace we owe the first use in the theory of attraction of that function which is now known as the Potential (q. v.) ; while Lagrange developed in his remarkable system of generalised co-ordinates a general method for the solution of any dynamic problem. The whole investigation turns upon the mathematical treatment of a certain quadratic function of the rates at which the generalised co- ordinates vary. This function is now recognised as the kinetic energy (see Energy) of the system, and is the characteristic 12 element in Maupertius' principle of least action (see Action, Principle of Least), the importance of which in dynamical science was first fully appreciated by Lagrange. The principle of Varying Action, an extension of the above by Sir W. R. Hamilton of Dublin, is by far the most valuable development since the time of the French physicists. This principle led, in the hands of its inventor, to a general dynamic theory, by which the whole motion of any conservative system is determined by means of a single function known as Hamilton's Characteristic Function. It is the so-called action, and is a function of the co-ordinates and of a constant which is the sum of the kinetic and poten"
