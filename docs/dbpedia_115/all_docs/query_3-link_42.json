This under-valued native provides an important nectar source for pollinators from late summer until frost. Its roots can be divided annually and the flower colour can range from white, to pink to blue-purple. New England Aster is the host plant of the Pearl Crescent and several checkerspot butterflies.\n\nGrowing Instructions\n\nCold, moist stratification required. Mix seeds with moist substrate (vermiculite, perlite or moss) and place in a plastic bag and refrigerate for 6-8 weeks. Sow seed at soil surface. Do not let seedling dry out while it is establishing.\n\nOR\n\nSow directly outdoors in late fall to overwinter."
