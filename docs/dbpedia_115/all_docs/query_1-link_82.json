        "text": "I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve experienced a more pleasant July in east Texas. Or, anywhere in the southeast US for that matter. It feels like the weather is trying to atone for its sins of last summer where we had 36 days over 100Â°F and not much rain for a month and a half.\n\nSure, life was less than ideal when Hurricane Beryl knocked our power out for over two days right before we had over a dozen family members come to our house for Magnoliaâ€™s first birthday party.\n\nBut, the 4.6 inches of rain and cloudy days gave us mornings in the 60â€™s. Another cold front last week dropped the highs into the 80â€™s and brought another 2.5 inches. And, then this week, we got another 3.5 inches in the rain gauge.\n\nTo be honest it feels like September when the rains typically return, and there is the slightest chill on the breeze that July never has. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s not still hot and muggy, but instead of sweating through five or six shirts a day, itâ€™s three now.\n\nThe plants have responded to the kind weather. They lack that sunburned, crispy appearance they usually have in midsummer, and there are so many colors of green to enjoy.\n\nThe summer geophytes have also begun to emerge. It always amazes me how within days of precipitation we go from nothing there to brand new flowers. Itâ€™s still too early for Lycoris, but the rain lilies and spider lilies are flowering. I anticipated the rain lilies, but I was surprised to see our Hymenocallis occidentalis (summer spider lily) emerge so early. Usually, itâ€™s August or September when they make an appearance, but I happily welcome them in early July.\n\nThough I knew Hymenocallis from seeing their strap-like leaves in the woods before leaving Tennessee, I have gotten to know the genus much better and finally see it flower in Texas. My plants came from back roadsides where they had propagated themselves over the years into large patches.\n\nThese long summer days are precious. Here in East Texas the light becomes perceptible right around 5:30 am outside, and it doesnâ€™t take me long to be outside afterwards. The family is still asleep, and traffic on the road is light.\n\nEach morning, I scan the garden to see if thereâ€™s anything I need to consider for the dayâ€™s tasks. And, in these high days of summer, Iâ€™m greeted by the blooms of Hibiscus â€˜Lufkin Redâ€™. Itâ€™s baseball-sized flowers are visible from 100 feet away.\n\nI first learned of this plant from visiting Stoneleigh years ago. During a tour, Ethan Kauffman made an off comment about how this selection was named after a town near me, and once he said â€˜Lufkin Redâ€™, I immediately recognized the name for the town 30 minutes south of Nacogdoches.\n\nFrom further investigation, I learned this cultivar was developed with leaf spot resistance in mind. In the deep south where heat and humidity reign, fungal diseases abound. So, Cecil Pounders made selections of native hibisicus species that exhibited leaf-spot resistance and allowed them to naturally cross. â€˜Lufkin Redâ€™ (and another selection named â€˜Lufkin Whiteâ€™) originated from a blemish free plant collected from East Texas. It is a winter hardy Hibiscus laevis type, but due to being open pollinated, the complete parentage is unknown.\n\nWe are rejoicing over the clear skies. It seems all itâ€™s done over the past few weeks is rain after an already wet spring. I lamented in one of the last posts about just how wet we were. I didnâ€™t know it could get worse.\n\nWe were inundated last Sunday night when instead of the few tenths of an inch of rain forecasted we received 4.6 inches in 3 hours.\n\nIâ€™ve lost most of my tomatoes due to too high a water table, and Iâ€™m watching fungal diseases set in on other plants. I finally broke down the other day and just started gardening in the rain, cutting back flopped over Rudbeckia maxima (giant coneflower) and Coreopsis tripteris (tall tickseed) that has exploded in growth with its wet feet.\n\nBut, not all the garden is a source of frustration. Our blueberries have loved this wet spring. I have long admired Vaccinium virgatum (rabbiteye blueberry) for the multi-season interest it offers the gardener and its versatility in the landscape. For us in the deep south, this species is our best selection to grow. And, in case youâ€™re curious, the common name comes from the pink hue that fruit turn before they ripen that resembles the color of some rabbitsâ€™ eyes.\n\nBefore rabbiteyes bloom, their red stems offer color to the void of winter. And, in early spring I delight when the buds start to swell. They have attractive urn-shaped flowers that are pollinated by native bees. I have a fond memory of a southeastern blueberry bee sonicating a stem I was touching one day. I felt a slight shaking on the branch as the bee pollinated the flower by vibrating its flight muscles.\n\nOur flowers took a hit during the late March freeze last year, and I watched as the urn-shaped blossoms that dangle and catch the dew on wet mornings fell from the plants. Thus, we lost most the fruit on â€˜Austinâ€™, â€˜Climaxâ€™, and the red-fruited hybrid â€˜Pink Lemonadeâ€™. Only â€˜Powder Blueâ€™ yielded fruit.\n\nBut, this year has been much better, and the plants have been loaded in the absence of a crop from last year. After last seasonâ€™s dearth of fruit, Iâ€™m looking at adding more varieties for diversity to deal with weather issues.\n\nPlanting them is easy. I like to put blueberries in the ground in autumn when they are going dormant as I do most shrubs to help them establish and grow with the coming wetness of winter. And, I donâ€™t amend the soil with lime, as I have to for most plants to help neutralize our soilâ€™s 4.2 pH. They thrive in acidic conditions like many of their relatives in the Ericaceae (heath) family. Blueberries have a high iron requirement, and the lower pH frees more of the mineral nutrient into the soil solution. If your pH is too high, you can always use sulfur to bring it down.\n\nThe area surrounding Nacogdoches has acidic soil and used to be a nexus for blueberry production. I do hate that many of the farms have closed (save for a few), but we are holding onto our blueberry tradition here in the community with this past weekendâ€™s 34 annual Texas Blueberry Festival.\n\nAfter eating blueberry pancakes, Magnolia, Karen, and I helped paint part of a new blueberry mural as part of Brushing Up Nac, a non-profit that is making our quaint town even more charming.\n\nGrades are entered, and the school year is over for me.\n\nWhew.\n\nIâ€™ve been in reflection mode lately as it feels for the first time in 10 months that Iâ€™ve had a chance to breathe.\n\nSure, teaching, running a student botanic garden, giving presentations across the country, hosting a podcast, and then writing a weekly newsletter is a full life, but after throwing a first child into the mix last July, well, suddenly priorities drastically shift. Being inside listening to baby belly laughs beats pulling weeds.\n\nBut, Iâ€™ve barely planted the vegetable garden for the summer, weeds abound, and there are spots I have yet to mow out back.\n\nItâ€™s not all on me. The soil has been so wet, wetter than the last few years, that recent time outside is often spent watching the rain. This spring is one of those similar to when we first moved in where water would run through the property almost to June, and I would discover all the places I could get my mower stuck. It makes it harder to tend the ground, but I know weâ€™ll be wanting the moisture come August.\n\nThe one thing I feel like the beds are still lacking is a solid ground cover layer. Carex texensis (Texas sedge) is doing well, but this time of the year it can start looking gangly with the long scapes after setting seed. I cut them back to start with a fresh clump. Muhlenbergia reverchonii (rose muhly) is quickly becoming a favorite. After a couple of years in the ground it has already become a robust grass in the spring. The height is not too bad for later in the year. And, Sporobolus heterolepis (prairie dropseed) is doing well where the clumps have had time to mature. But, many plants and divisions are still quite young. I sow seed when I can, but patience must be had with that plant.\n\nIâ€™ll add that my thoughts on relying solely on plants to cover the ground have also changed. After a years long battle with trying to get gripeweed (Phyllanthus urinaria) under control, Iâ€™m finally having success with bark mulch to prevent germination. Itâ€™s amazing how the little seeds seem to get into everything, even the crowns of plants. So, itâ€™s a bit of a hybrid approach. Cover as much of the ground with plants as possible, but sprinkle in some mulch to cover the bare spots.\n\nSo, what does this have to do with gardening?\n\nIn early 2023, I announced that we named our smallholding Ephemera Farm to celebrate the little things in life. And, as we drove back home, I began to think about how a total solar eclipse is possibly the ultimate in natural ephemera. It lasts mere minutes, and it is estimated only 1 in 10000 people see one in their lifetimes.\n\nBut, I started to kick myself as I started to think of everything I had done wrong. How could something so important have such little planning on my part for the duration of the event? Sure, cloud forecast watching for days in advance allowed me to find the perfect clear sky spot while other areas of Texas had cloud cover, and I had hauled us 6 hours from home to see something we may only see a couple times in our lives.\n\nBut, I had regrets.\n\nNot leaving early enough the morning of\n\nNot buying snacks the night before (although we did get gas)\n\nNot scouting places in advance\n\nNot buying another pair of binoculars for Karen\n\nNot looking through the binoculars for longer\n\nNot having the camera settings perfectly figured out\n\nNot doing a video recording on my iPad.\n\nThen, I realized that all of the regrets were because I missed the feeling of witnessing the eclipse, and I wanted to recapture every millisecond that I could. And, because it wasnâ€™t perfect, it was taking away from the experience.\n\nItâ€™s often the same with the garden. Too often when I see something not perfect, I think next year Iâ€™ll do this differently. Thereâ€™s penstemon that are too thick in one spot and blend too much with the gaura. Next year. I missed sowing a spring crop of peas. Next year. The entrance to the patch looks bare and weedy after moving the 1000 lycoris bulbs last month. Next year. I want to overhaul the kitchen garden design, and itâ€™s not planted yet. Next year.\n\nBut, the eclipse doesnâ€™t offer much in the chance of a redo. The next one coming through this area is in 21 years.\n\nThe one thing I did right during the eclipse was to be present, to really look at it. I had read online that some people spend the whole time looking at the eclipse through a camera lens. I didnâ€™t want to make that same mistake. I remember much from that 4 minutes and 13 secondsâ€”the darkness, the coolness, the appearance of twilight all along the horizon, and right before it ended holding the binoculars as long as I safely could, noting the prominences that were erupting off the sides. Sure, I may not have the perfect photo or video, but I was there.\n\nIn the garden many areas arenâ€™t so perfect. Thereâ€™s weeds and even some perennials I havenâ€™t cut back their winter skeletons yet. I will say that raising a daughter means that thereâ€™s a few LOT more weeds this year than there have been in previous years. But, to have a bundle of joy and happiness is a worthwhile trade.\n\nHowever, the garden beds near the house look the best theyâ€™ve looked in the 7 years weâ€™ve lived here at Ephemera Farm. Iâ€™m so proud of them. I think too often I see one small thing thatâ€™s wrong and focus on that instead of appreciating the here and now. And, I have a feeling Iâ€™m not alone with those of you reading this perspective. I have to accept that things donâ€™t have to be perfect in the garden. They never will be in a planting. Thatâ€™s part of the beauty of it.\n\nAnd, just like the eclipse, I just need to be present and appreciate what I have in the moment.\n\nI woke up around 3 am to Magnolia crying for her nightly bottle. It was March 19 and the last few hours of winter. I walked into the kitchen, and looked at the thermometer.\n\n35Â°F. Close. Too close.\n\nWould it stay above freezing for the next couple of hours? I had been tossing and turning already, dreaming about below freezing temperatures. Most plants had already emerged in the garden yet again this year, and I was worried about a repeat of last spring where we had two nights of 26Â°F that blackened or nipped so many speciesâ€”persimmons and peaches in the orchard, and in the rest of the garden we lost blooms on Chionanthus virginicus (white fringetree), Nemastylis geminiflora (prairie celestial), Baptisia alba (white wild indigo) and Baptisia sphaerocarpa (yellow wild indigo), Rhododendron austrinum (flame azalea), and more. Gut wrenching.\n\nLoosing the bloom period of a single species is painful because once the buds are nipped, thatâ€™s it, and one has to wait another whole year to enjoy the spectacle. But, it hurts even more to see multiple plants lost. I began to wonder with climate change are these our springs to come where a whole wave of bloom may be periodically removed from the garden? And if so, how do we deal with that?\n\nMy hope for this year was that this front seemed to lack the punch last yearâ€™s did. Instead of two days below freezing, only one was forecasted. So, maybe it wouldnâ€™t be as bad? But, checking multiple websites showed the forecast anything between 29Â°Fâ€“36Â°F, and living in a little valley makes our garden prone to cold air settling. I can usually count on the temperature being a few degrees colder than the forecast.\n\nThe bottle warmed, I gave it to Magnolia, said a little prayer, and laid back down.\n\nA couple hours later I awoke to find it was 33Â°F, and once it was light out, I went to inspect the damage. Frost was on the top of the house, a few low plants to the ground, and the lowest patch of north facing turf where it always appears first in the fall. But, most things looked ok. I didnâ€™t see that watersoaked appearance that greeted me last year. A sigh of relief swept over me. I felt giddy. The first day of spring was off to a good start.\n\nItâ€™s been almost two weeks since that scare, and I can happily report the garden is flourishing. Spires of Baptisia are coming into color, the peach tree is loaded with so many fruit I need to thin them, and the fringetree appears as a misty haze. The garden looks the best it has ever looked in spring. Having lost several key players last year I donâ€™t think I got to fully see it for what it had become.\n\nThere are some gaps in the main beds that I am working to fill. The matrix layer has really begun to knit together with Carex species like Carex texensis (Texas sedge) and Carex flaccosperma (blue wood sedge) I collected on site and have been propagating. Iâ€™m making notes about where thereâ€™s holes. For example, Vernonia lettermannii â€˜Iron Butterflyâ€™ (narrowleaf ironweed) still hasnâ€™t risen yet, and it looks a bit barren in those areas. Iâ€™ll underplant the ironweed with something this coming winter.\n\nWhen I lived in Tennessee, as a teenager I would go to the woods in early spring to see if I could find any wildflowers starting to emerge or in bloom. I was a bit perplexed why my little spot in the northwest part of the state was so devoid of flora. Later, I would learn it was because high soil fertility reduced diversity in the Mississippi Delta region. But, thatâ€™s another blog post.\n\nThe dearth of wildflowers made me look even more for relics that might be along fencerows or river bottoms that the plow missed. And, in my searching I discovered plants that were brand new to me.\n\nI remember the first time that I stumbled upon Erythronium albidum (white trout lily). In 2005, my journal noted that the sighting of some Phlox divaricata (woodland phlox) near a creek beckoned me to see what else could be found in the area. After walking through the crunchy brown duff that had fallen the previous autumn, a clearing appeared with a massive patch of ghostly green mottled leaves. These leaves were alive unlike the foliar skeletons that carpeted the ground beneath their short stature. There were many single leaves rising from the forest floor while pairs of blades held little white flowers that nodded in the cool breeze and looked like octopi with their arms outstretched. Since it was mid-afternoon, the flowers were open. Had I been earlier or later, they might have been closed.\n\nBack home, I would identify these plants as Erythronium albidum, the white trout lily. I would read how they were ephemerals, plants that grow for only a slice of the season, in this case perhaps two months, while they captured what light they could before the canopy closed. I also learned white trout lilies had storage organs but were also rhizomatous or had droppers, which explained them occurring in such a large swath yet having an abrupt edge of the colony.\n\nThe next year I returned to the same patch with my first digital camera in hand to take some photos. They had returned once again in their diminutive yet wide splendor, and I writhed my body as low to the ground as I could to snap some photos. The blooms mere inches above the soil were hard to see inside. I wanted to lay down, but the barren sprigs of poison ivy that rose throughout the clump suggested that wouldnâ€™t be a good idea. Plus, I might have crushed some of the trout lilies. I angled the camera the best I could and snapped away. From that day came some of the first photos I ever took of a wildflower, which helped further cement the memory\n\nItâ€™s been almost 20 years since I first discovered Erythronium albidum. Iâ€™ve learned many more wildflowers since those days, even a few new Erythronium, but this one still holds a special place as one of the first wildflowers I ever found. Iâ€™ve also learned more about this native in that time, how it is visited by the specialist bee Andrena erythronii and how seed have elaiosomes and are spread by ants. It has been observed ants seem to have this interesting dispersal where seeds are moved a short distance but then dropped, perhaps due to the volatiles dissipating once removed from the plant.\n\nI stumbled upon them here in east Texas unexpectedly, much like my first encounter in Tennessee. I was driving to town one day when a patch of the characteristic ghostly colored leaves caught my eye on a woodland edge. After my discovery I got permission from the landowner to investigate and collect some plants.\n\nOnce I walked in the woods I was surprised to see there were several different patches. Each colony was uniform in color, but each patch had a slightly different leaf color, some a little whiter, some a little darker, and some more speckled. And, to my delight there was one clump that also was loaded with flowers, many more so than the ones around it. From that colony I collected a few plants. My guess was the ants had done their work years ago starting a single plant that had now become these diverse patches.\n\nAnother patch deeper in the woods was much larger and reminded me of my initial find in Tennessee those many years ago. I noted that the colony seemed to stop at a creekâ€™s edge and how fallen logs had separated plants temporarily from each other.\n\nI like to think that digging them is fishing for trout lily bulbs. The shovel has to be deep enough as their storage organs are about 6 inches down. My King of Spades blade was long enough to access their deep geophytes. I just made sure to not disturb the block of soil that contained them.\n\nThere seems to be some debate on whether they sprout from bulbs or corms. I have always felt they were bulbs, though I have not brought myself to cut the storage organ of a white trout lily open yet. However, Ian Young of Scottish Rock Garden Club Bulb Log was curious enough to slice a different Erythronium species open in 2005, to which we own him thanks for his sacrifice. (Seems that was a banner year for learning about trout lilies!) And, in the second set of images from the link one can see the buds emerging from what appears to be a basal plate and surrounded partially by scales, two tale-tell signs of a bulb. And, I think itâ€™s not too much conjecture to say the same is true for Erythronium albidum. So, after I wrote this post, I decided to go out and investigate when I was dividing my trout lilies. I cut open the geophyte, got out my hand lens, and sure enough, thereâ€™s no scales inside. Itâ€™s a corm!"
