        "text": "Botanical name: Aster, Callistephus, Eurybia, Kalimeris, Symphyotrichum\n\nCommon name: Michaelmas daisy, aster, China aster, New England asters\n\nAsters are popular plants, unrivalled for their range of late-season flower colour between summer and the end of autumn. Asters lend themselves well to a range of garden styles from prairie plantings to cottage gardens and mixed borders. More are perennials lasting years in the border, but some such as Callistephus (China asters) are grown as annuals from seed each spring.\n\nThey are all daisy-flowered plants and once they used to all be known as Aster. Now they have been split into several genera: Aster, Callistephus, Eurybia, Kalimeris, Symphyotrichum – we’ve kept them all together on this page so you can easily choose those that you really like and would grow well in your garden."
