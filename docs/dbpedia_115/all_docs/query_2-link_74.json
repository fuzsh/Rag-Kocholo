        "text": "ESRI 10m Annual Land Cover (2017-2023)¶\n\nTime series of annual global maps of land use and land cover (LULC) was updated to v3 with global 10m land cover from 2017-2023. The maps are derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. Each map is a composite of LULC predictions for 9 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of each year. This dataset was generated by Impact Observatory, who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification. The global map was produced by applying this model to the Sentinel-2 annual scene collections on the Planetary Computer. Each of the maps has an assessed average accuracy of over 75%. These datasets produced by Impact Observatory and licensed by Esri were fetched from Impact Observatory\n\nThis map uses an updated model from the 10-class model and combines Grass(formerly class 3) and Scrub (formerly class 6) into a single Rangeland class (class 11). The original Esri 2020 Land Cover collection uses 10 classes (Grass and Scrub separate) and an older version of the underlying deep learning model. The Esri 2020 Land Cover map was also produced by Impact Observatory and you can find it in GEE here. The map remains available for use in existing applications. New applications should use the updated version of 2020 once it is available in this collection, especially when using data from multiple years of this time series, to ensure consistent classification.\n\nYou can find more information starting with the first release here Kontgis, C. (2021, June 24).

Mix of small clusters of plants or single plants dispersed on a landscape that shows exposed soil or rock; scrub-filled clearings within dense forests that are clearly not taller than trees; examples: moderate to sparse cover of bushes, shrubs and tufts of grass, savannas with very sparse grasses, trees or other plants.\n\nFor Accuracy Assessment information visit the ESRI release page\n\nClass Value Remapped Value Land Cover Class Hex Code 1 1 Water #1A5BAB 2 2 Trees #358221 4 3 Flooded Vegetation #87D19E 5 4 Crops #FFDB5C 7 5 Built Area #ED022A 8 6 Bare Ground #EDE9E4 9 7 Snow/Ice #F2FAFF 10 8 Clouds #C8C8C8 11 9 Rangeland #C6AD8D\n\nEarth Engine Snippet¶\n\nSample Code: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users/sat-io/awesome-gee-catalog-examples:global-landuse-landcover/ESRI-10M-LANDCOVER\n\nCredits, Attributions and License¶\n\nThis dataset was produced by Impact Observatory for Esri. © 2021 Esri.
