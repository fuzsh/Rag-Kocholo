Plants for a boulevard garden need to be tough enough to withstand compaction, road salt and drought. Gardeners also have to be tough, preparing for disappointment if this garden gets disturbed when utilities workers need access below ground or a snowplow scrapes the edges. The plants selected were close to the one designed by Jennifer Ehlert (Metro Blooms) for a sunny boulevard with her permission. The two sets work nicely together with set 1 being at the center of the boulevard and set 2 being toward the edges.\n\nIf you are planning to plant a garden in a boulevard, you will need utility lines to be marked before digging. Contact Gopher State One Call to request a utility line location visit.\n\n2. Louisiana Oaks Prairie Garden\n\n2.

This south facing garden receives full sun all day. Weed Suppression Mat was used and the weedy turf was not removed before smothering. Despite the weeds and compacted, rocky soil, the natives are very happy here. What’s more is we are finding some unusual pollinators like the Tricolored bumble bee last fall and just recently we saw a huge monarch caterpillar on the rose milkweed.\n\n4.

This area is being converted from turf grass to a native plant garden. The edges were planted with live plants that thrive in sun and shade, while the middle was seeded in late October of 2022. This garden is where a woodland meets the lake and biodiverse communities thrive. While we were watering this garden in June a Great Crested Flycatcher flew in and landed on a cup plant. A very young pollinator garden is already an oasis for wildlife in our community.\n\n5. Mayor’s Monarch Garden\n\n5.
