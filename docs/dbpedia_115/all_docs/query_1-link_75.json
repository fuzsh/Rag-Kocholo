        "text": "The plants are trying to tell us something — if only we’d learn their official language, botanical Latin.\n\n“I am the Allium with just one leaf,” says Allium unifolium. (Get it?)\n\n“I am the juniper that carpets the ground,” says Juniperus horizontalis (whose alternate name, Juniperus prostrata, nails its appearance, too).\n\nAnd Aster alpinus chimes in: “My ancestors hailed from above the timber line — you know, like, the Alps. I won’t appreciate some sodden, clayey spot in your garden.”\n\nNot all plant names offer such easy clues about traits like appearance, preferred conditions or place of origin. It’s worth digging deeper, though, and I’m grateful to several formally trained old-school horticulturists, my first garden teachers, who used botanical Latin confidently."
