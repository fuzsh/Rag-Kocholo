        "text": "Ethical Poll: Would you sign a petition to take a 50% pay cut for 4 months to ensure no COVID related layoffs happen at your firm? Answer in the comments below.\n\nGenuine question for highly paid fish: Are you happy with your life? What are the negative aspects that come with the high salary?

I know sometimes I think it would be nice to be making bank but I imagine there are things which come with the territory that I don’t consider. (Including your salary would be helpful.)\n\nLet’s say you’re offered a job paying $250k/year but you’d have to be based out of one of the following cities. Which one would you choose? Houston Fort Lauderdale Atlanta Philly Denver"
