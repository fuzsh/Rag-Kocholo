        "text": "Aster lanceolatus Willd. is represented by five polyploid levels in southern Ontario: tetraploid (2n = 32), pentaploid (2n = 40), hexaploid(2n = 48), heptaploid (2n = 56), andoctoploid(2n = 64). Tetraploids were absent from the Niagara Peninsula in the southeast and Essex County, Kent County, Lambton County, and Elgin County in the southwest, whereas the hexaploids were ubiquitous. Correlations were found between chromosome number and habitat (community type), water content of the soil, physiographic region, and grouped physiographic region. These correlations notwithstanding, the distribution of the two predominant cytotypes in southern Ontario may also be related to historical factors.\n\nChromosome number determinations for 95 populations of Virgulus ericoides and 135 populations of V. novae-angliae from southern Ontario are reported for the first time. Although much of southern Ontario was sampled for these species, sampling was concentrated in the area formerly occupied by Ontario Island. All populations for both taxa were diploid (2n = 10), unlike the situation in several other asters that have been studied previously.\n\nAster lanceolatus has been reported to occur at five ploidy levels in at least some parts of its range: 2n = 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64. Chromosome number determinations from 127 populations from throughout the range are reported here. Octoploid plants were frequent from Nova Scotia to Virginia and across to the Great Plains. Hexaploids were predominant in some northern parts of the range, but very rare or absent in the southern portions. Tetraploids occurred sporadically in the northeast, were common in parts of southern Ontario and Michigan, and were not found in the southern parts of the range. Odd-level polyploids occurred rarely in areas where two even ploidy levels were sympatric. On the Great Plains A. lanceolatus intergraded with A. hesperius with which it is perhaps conspecific. Thirty-four hexaploid and octoploid populations of this western \"species\" were found in two transects across the northern portion of the prairies and from scattered montane and southern locations. Octoploids were frequent in the western areas while hexaploids were frequent in the northeastern area. Some aneuploidy was found in the montane populations of octoploids. One decaploid 2n = 80 population was found in Wisconsin that is best labelled as A. coerulescens DC. sensu Rosendahl and Cronquist.\n\nPrevious chromosomal studies within Melampodium (Asteraceae, Heliantheae) of Mexico and Central America have documented chromosome numbers n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 23, 25 Â± 1, 27, 30, and 33. Some species also have been shown to exhibit infra- and interpopulational polyploidy. The presence of cytotype mixtures is especially pronounced in the white-rayed complex, which occurs in the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico. This group includes M. cinereum (n = 10 and 20), M. leucanthum (n = 10 and 20), and M. argophyllum (n = 30). Cytotype distribution has been newly analyzed in 415 plants from 152 populations and added to existing data from 185 plants from 113 populations, yielding information from a total of 600 individuals from 265 populations. Within M. cinereum and M. leucanthum are parapatric distributions of cytotypes, with tetraploids centered in the eastern and diploids in the western portions of their ranges. Tetraploids are most likely of autopolyploid origin, forming recurrently, with adaptations that allow colonization and establishment in new ecological regions. Contact zones are relatively narrow and only two triploid individuals have been detected. The tetraploid cytotypes probably extended eastward into central and southern Texas to the natural barriers at the edge of the Edward's Plateau in M. leucanthum and the low sandy plains in M. cinereum. The hexaploid M. argophyllum is interpreted as a relict surviving in the low mountains of northern Mexico; it may be an allopolyploid of hybrid origin between ancestors of the evolutionary lines that eventually yielded M. cinereum and M. leucanthum."
