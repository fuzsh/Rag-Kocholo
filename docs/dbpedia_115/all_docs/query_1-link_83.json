        "text": "Overview\n\nSouthern wet meadow is an open, groundwater-influenced (minerotrophic), sedge-dominated wetland that occurs in central and southern Lower Michigan. Open conditions are maintained by seasonal flooding, beaver-induced flooding, and fire. Sedges in the genus Carex, in particular tussock sedge (Carex stricta), dominate the community. Southern wet meadow, commonly referred to as sedge meadow, also occurs in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Ontario.\n\nRank\n\nGlobal Rank: G4? - Apparently secure (inexact)\n\nState Rank: S3 - Vulnerable\n\nCounty Distribution Map\n\nLandscape Context\n\nSouthern wet meadow occurs on glacial lakebeds, lakeplains, and in depressions on glacial outwash and moraines. The community frequently occurs along the margins of lakes and streams, where seasonal flooding or beaver-induced flooding is common.\n\nSoils\n\nSouthern wet meadow typically occurs on neutral to strongly alkaline organic soils (i.e., sapric to hemic peat), but saturated mineral soil may also support the community. Because of the calcareous nature of the glacial drift in the regions where southern wet meadow occurs, its soils typically contain high levels of calcium and magnesium.\n\nNatural Processes\n\nWater levels in southern wet meadow may fluctuate seasonally, reaching their peak in spring and lows in late summer, but typically remain at or near the soil’s surface throughout the year. The structure of southern wet meadow is largely influenced by tussock sedge, which forms large tussocks up to 0.5 m high on which many additional species successfully establish above the zone of seasonal inundation. Community structure may depend on a consistently high water table as the tussocks of Carex stricta rapidly decompose when water levels are reduced by tiling. In addition to seasonal flooding, beaver-induced flooding also maintains open conditions by killing encroaching trees and shrubs.\n\nSouthern wet meadow is a fire-dependent natural community. By reducing leaf litter and allowing light to reach the soil surface and stimulate seed germination, fire can play an important role in maintaining southern wet meadow seed banks. Fire plays a critical role in maintaining species richness by creating open microsites for small species. Another critically important attribute of fire is its ability to temporarily reduce shrub and tree cover.\n\nIn the absence of fire or beaver-induced flooding, all but the wettest sedge meadows typically convert to shrub-carr and eventually swamp forest. Prolonged flooding may also create new southern wet meadows by killing trees and shrubs of swamp forests and shrub-carrs, thus allowing shade-intolerant wet meadow species such as tussock sedge to become established.\n\nVegetation\n\nSouthern wet meadow is typically dominated by tussock sedge. Because its roots form large hummocks or tussocks, the species is responsible for the community’s hummock and hollow structure. As the shaded areas between tussocks are often covered with standing water and leaf litter, many of the shorter species inhabiting sedge meadows grow almost exclusively from the sides or tops of Carex stricta tussocks. Additional common sedges include Carex aquatilis, C. comosa, C. bebbii, C. hystericina, C. lacustris, C. pellita, C. lasiocarpa, C. prairea, C. retrorsa, C. sartwellii, C. stipata, and C. vulpinoidea. The most dominant grass species in southern wet meadow is bluejoint grass (Calamagrostis canadensis), sometimes occurring as a codominant with tussock sedge. Other common grasses include fringed brome (Bromus ciliatus), fowl manna grass (Glyceria striata), marsh wild timothy (Muhlenbergia glomerata), leafy satin grass (M. mexicana), and fowl meadow grass (Poa palustris). A wide variety of wetland forbs and several ferns occur in southern wet meadow, including swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata), marsh bellflower (Campanula aparinoides), water hemlock (Cicuta bulbifera), swamp thistle (Cirsium muticum), common boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum), joe-pye-weed (Eutrochium maculatum), rough bedstraw (Galium asprellum), marsh pea (Lathyrus palustris), northern bugle weed (Lycopus uniflorus), tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), clearweed (Pilea pumila), water smartweed (Persicaria amphibia), Virginia mountain mint (Pycnanthemum virginianum), great water dock (Rumex orbiculatus), common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia), common skullcap (Scutellaria galericulata), Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), late goldenrod (S. gigantea), swamp goldenrod (S. patula), smooth swamp aster (Symphyotrichum firmum), swamp aster (S. puniceum), purple meadow rue (Thalictrum dasycarpum), marsh St. John's-wort (Triadenum fraseri), marsh fern (Thelypteris palustris), and sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis).\n\nFor information about plant species, visit the Michigan Flora website.\n\nPlant Lists\n\nGraminoids\n\nfringed brome (Bromus ciliatus)\n\nblue-joint (Calamagrostis canadensis)\n\nsedges (Carex aquatilis, C. bebbii, C. comosa, C. hystericina, C. lacustris, C. lasiocarpa, C. pellita, C. prairea, C. utriculata, C. sartwellii, C. stipata, C. stricta, C. vulpinoidea, and others)\n\nbald spike-rush (Eleocharis erythropoda)\n\nmarsh wild-timothy (Muhlenbergia glomerata)\n\nleafy satin grass (Muhlenbergia mexicana)\n\nfowl meadow grass (Poa palustris)\n\nForbs\n\nswamp agrimony (Agrimonia parviflora)\n\nCanada anemone (Anemone canadensis)\n\nthimbleweed (Anemone virginiana)\n\nangelica (Angelica atropurpurea)\n\nswamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata)\n\nhedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium)\n\nmarsh bellflower (Campanula aparinoides)\n\nwater hemlock (Cicuta bulbifera)\n\nswamp thistle (Cirsium muticum)\n\nflat-topped white aster (Doellingeria umbellata)\n\ncommon boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum)\n\njoe-pye-weed (Eutrochium maculatum)\n\nrough bedstraw (Galium asprellum)\n\nbog bedstraw (Galium labradoricum)\n\nsmall bedstraw (Galium trifidum)\n\njewelweed (Impatiens capensis)\n\nwild blue flag (Iris versicolor)\n\nmarsh pea (Lathyrus palustris)\n\nMichigan lily (Lilium michiganense)\n\ngreat blue lobelia (Lobelia siphilitica)\n\nnorthern bugle weed (Lycopus uniflorus)\n\ntufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora)\n\nwater smartweed (Persicaria amphibia)\n\nclearweed (Pilea pumila)\n\ncommon mountain mint (Pycnanthemum virginianum)\n\ngreat water dock (Rumex orbiculatus)\n\ncommon arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia)\n\ncommon skullcap (Scutellaria galericulata)\n\nCanada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis)\n\nlate goldenrod (Solidago gigantea)\n\nswamp goldenrod (Solidago patula)\n\nrough goldenrod (Solidago rugosa)\n\nsmooth swamp aster (Symphyotrichum firmum)\n\npanicled aster (Symphyotrichum lanceolatum)\n\nside-flowering aster (Symphyotrichum lateriflorum)\n\nswamp aster (Symphyotrichum puniceum)\n\npurple meadow-rue (Thalictrum dasycarpum)\n\nmarsh St. John’s-wort (Triadenum fraseri)\n\nbroad-leaved cat-tail (Typha latifolia)\n\nblue vervain (Verbena hastata)\n\nMissouri ironweed (Vernonia missurica)\n\nFerns\n\nsensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis)\n\nmarsh fern (Thelypteris palustris)\n\nShrubs\n\nsilky dogwood (Cornus amomum)\n\ngray dogwood (Cornus foemina )\n\nred-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea)\n\nninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius)\n\nswamp gooseberry (Ribes hirtellum)\n\nswamp rose (Rosa palustris)\n\nwillows (Salix spp.)\n\nmeadowsweet (Spiraea alba)\n\npoison sumac (Toxicodendron vernix)\n\nnannyberry (Viburnum lentago)\n\nTrees\n\nred maple (Acer rubrum)\n\nblack ash (Fraxinus nigra)\n\ngreen ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica)\n\ntamarack (Larix laricina)\n\nAmerican elm (Ulmus americana)\n\nNoteworthy Animals\n\nMuskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) commonly build lodges in southern wet meadows, which when abandoned are used by Canada geese (Branta canadensis) as nesting sites.

Maintaining the natural hydrology of southern wet meadow is imperative for the community’s continued existence. This may include avoiding surface water inputs to the meadow from drainage ditches and agricultural fields, and protecting groundwater recharge areas by maintaining native vegetation types in the uplands around the community. Management for southern wet meadows should include the use of prescribed fire to help reduce litter, stimulate seed germination, promote seedling establishment and plant growth, limit shrub and tree encroachment, and control invasive species. Ideally, prescribed fire management of southern wet meadows would be orchestrated with that of surrounding fire-dependent wetland and upland communities. If prescribed burning is not feasible, mowing can be used to reduce woody plant cover but should be restricted to the winter, when ground frost will reduce disturbance to soils, herbaceous plants, and hydrology, or late summer and fall when meadows are dry. Because most wetland shrubs are capable of resprouting when cut (or burned), the application of herbicides to recently cut stumps may be required to maintain open conditions.\n\nMonitoring and control efforts to detect and remove invasive species are critical to the long-term viability of southern wet meadow. Invasive species that threaten the diversity and community structure include purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), reed (Phragmites australis subsp. australis), narrow-leaved cat-tail (Typha angustifolia), hybrid cat-tail (Typha xglauca), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora).\n\nVariation\n\nCommunity structure and plant diversity can vary significantly among southern wet meadows depending on the dominant species of sedge. Wet meadows dominated by tussock sedge have complex microtopography, which fosters high levels of forb diversity. Wet meadows dominated by lake sedge typically have little microtopographic complexity and low forb diversity.\n\nSimilar Natural Communities\n\nEmergent marsh, northern wet meadow, poor fen, prairie fen, wet prairie, lakeplain wet prairie, Great Lakes marsh, and southern shrub-carr.\n\nPlaces to Visit\n\nGraham Lakes, Bald Mountain State Recreation Area, Oakland Co.\n\nHavens Road Meadow and Bassett Lake Meadow, Barry State Game Area, Barry Co.\n\nIndian Springs Wet Meadow, Indian Springs Metropark, Oakland Co.\n\nMill Creek Wet Meadow, Three Rivers State Game Area, St. Joseph Co.\n\nMoss Lake, Proud Lake State Recreation Area, Oakland Co.\n\nRiethmiller Road Wet Meadow, Waterloo State Recreation Area, Jackson Co.\n\nRelevant Literature\n\nCostello, D.F. 1936.
