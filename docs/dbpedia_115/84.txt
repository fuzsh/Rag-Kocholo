Residents of a southeast Edmonton neighbourhood are fearing for their safety after a third home was destroyed by fire in a matter of months.

Those living in Aster tell CityNews they don’t believe the fires are a coincidence. They feel crime in the community is highly concerning and would like to see more security and better patrols.

An under-construction house at 12 Street and 16 Avenue was destroyed after a morning fire Sunday.

“The call came in around nine this morning,” said EFRS district chief Pat Fleet. “Crews arrived shortly to find heavy smoke coming from the home in the Aster neighbourhood.”

No one was living in the home but neighbours tell CityNews a family with children had just purchased it. They said they were on scene Sunday and were extremely upset.

This latest fire in the community happened right next door to another newly built home that was destroyed by fire in early November. Just down the street, another home was also destroyed.

There’s no word yet on the cost of damages. Fire crews remained on the scene throughout the day Sunday.

“There’s a lot of damage inside,” said Fleet. “So it’s too dangerous for firefighters to go inside. We’ll be sending some equipment to dismantle the house.”
