Flowering plants commonly known as "asters" are members of more than a dozen genera in the tribe Astereae of the Sunflower family. Asters of all sorts occur throughout North America and across Northern and Central Eurasia, with a few species in South America. There are estimated to be some 350 species of "asters" worldwide; about 150 of them are native to Canada and/or the United States. Traditional treatments place most asters in the genus Aster L. However, during the last decade analyses of morphology, chloroplast DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms and ITS sequence data, and on going karyotype studies have all demonstrated that asters are polyphyletic and members of a number of very distinct phylads within the tribe (Nesom 1994 and numerous cited papers); Lane et al. 1996; Xiang and Semple 1996; Noyes and Rieseberg 1999; Brouillet et al. 2001; Semple et al. 2002; Brouillet et al., 2009). To understand relationships among the different kinds of asters, one must first know the phylogeny of the entire Tribe Astereae. Asters can be divided into two categories following the general phylogeny of the entire tribe:

"Asters" related to genera native to South America, Africa and Asian

"Asters" of the North American clade of the tribe

The presentation here represents a significant shift in my opinion regarding generic limits from a traditional view of Aster to one that I believe will be the "new standard taxonomy" of asters. There really is no satisfactory compromise between the desire to maintain Aster as a large broadly defined genus with as many species as possible and the need to recognize that the traditional very broad concept of the genus is not monophyletic and not based on synapomorphies (shared derived traits). The treatment of asters in Semple et al. (1996) was an attempt at an acknowledged compromise between the old and new classifications and as such was inconsistent with the most recent data. Most significant is that the molecular evidence strongly shows that there are no true asters in North America (members of the genus Aster) with one exception, the arctic-alpine Aster alpinus ssp. vierhapperi (syn: Aster culminis) and that the majority of species traditionally placed in the genus Aster by North American botanists correctly belong in Eurybia Nees and Symphyotrichum Nees.

The generic treatment of North American asters proposed by Guy Nesom (1994) fit the new data quite well, although there are a number of species and a few groups of species that are not aligned in accordance with the molecular data. These are either realigned as indicated in this website or the continuing ambiguity about their phylogenetic position is discussed.

In the discussion below many of the genera cited are linked to additional pages posted on the this web site that present information on morphology, cytology and summaries of unresolved problems with phylogeny and classification. Numerous illustrations of individual species can be accessed from these additional pages.

The Tribe Astereae includes about 225 genera and 3,100 species (Chen, Chen, Brouillet & Semple 2011). This web site deals with only a small portion of these taxa.

Old World and South American astereae

The first category of asters and many non-aster-like Astereae are found in Africa and Southeastern Asia, New Zealand and Australia with close relatives in Europe and Asia. An early branch of the tribe reached South America as did a later branch. The genus Aster in the new monophyletic sense (type species Aster amellus) is Eurasian and is a member of this first category of Astereae. It is a middle level branch in the phylogenetic grade from the begins with the basal genus Denekia and ends with the more recently evolved second South American clade (Brouillet et al. 2009). The genus Aster includes species previously included in Asteromoea, Diplactis, Heteropappus, Kalimeris, and Rhynchospermum. The basal grade of phylads also includes some African and Eurasian "aster" and aster-like genera such as Bellis, Callistephus, Felicia, Galatella, Linosyris and Tripolium, which at one time or another have been included in Aster in the broadest polyphyletic sense. These all have a chromosome base number of x=9. Bremer (1994) hypothesized that the tribe had either paleotropical or North American origins. Semple (1995) incorrectly hypothesized that the tribe had its origins in Eurasia and that on the basis of RFLP cpDNA data genera such as Erigeron and Felicia were primitive members of the tribe, while Aster was North American and not primitive. Nesom (1994) proposed a southern hemisphere origin for the tribe. Southern Africa is the likely point of origin for the Tribe Astereae (Brouillet et al. 2009). Long distance dispersal must account for the present distribution patterns of the tribe across the southern hemisphere and from southern hemisphere areas into northern hemisphere areas. Several migrations from Africa into South America occurred at different times in the history of the tribe. Migrations out of the Southern Hemisphere into Eurasian and Australia/New Zealand occurred several times and into North America just once. Members of the North American clade much more recently migrated into Europe, Asia and South America (e.g., Erigeron and Solidago).

Asters of the North American Clade

The North American Clade of the tribe Astereae is well defined genetically (Noyes and Rieseberg 1999; Brouillet et al. 2001, 2009). The NA Clade includes various kinds of asters, the goldenrods (Solidago including Brintonia, and related genera Chrysoma, Chrysothamnus, Oreochrysum, Petradoria; subtribe Solidagininae group I), the grass-leaved goldenrods (Euthamia; Solidagininae group II), fleabanes (Erigeron; subtribe Conyzinae), goldenasters (Bradburia, Chrysopsis, Heterotheca, Pityopsis; subtribe Chrysopsidinae), and many other genera of white, purple and yellow rayed or rayless flowering herbs and shrubs (e.g., Arida, Corethrogyne, Dieteria, Grindelia, Haplopappus in the narrow sense, Hazardia, Isocoma, Machaeranthera, Pyrrocoma, Rayjacksonia, Xanthisma in the broad sense, Xylorhiza; substribe Machaerantherinae: and Ericameria; subtribe Pentachaetinae)

The NA Clade includes some 13 genera of "asters" which sometimes occupy a basal position in several different main branches of the clade. These include Doellingeria (including Eucephalus), Eurybia, Herrickia, Ionactis, Oclemena, Oreostemma, Sericocarpus and Subtribe Symphyotrichinae, which is divided on molecular and morphological grounds into Canadanthus, Ampelaster, Almutaster, Psilactis and Symphyotrichum (including Brachyactis and Virgulus). Brouillet et al. (2001) and Brouillet et al. (2004, 2009) included sufficient species to adequately resolve the phylogenetic position of each of these genera within the North American Clade. Previous studies lacked sufficient numbers of "asters" to achieve this, although members of some were included in DNA studies (Xiang and Semple 1996; Noyes and Rieseberg 1999). Nesom's studies (2000, 1996 and earlier) give an overview of the morphological limits of these native North American genera of asters with some modifications noted on this web site. Revised treatments of all of these aster genera are presented in Flora of North America. Vol. 20. Asteraceae, Part 2. Astereae and Senecioneae (Oxford University Press).
