Short films, original music and photographs by Gary Yost, award-winning immersive creator located in Marin County, California.

I've been making films and photographs since the 1960s. Initially crazy enough to attempt a career in photography, I began creating computer animation software in the 1980s and was responsible for the creation of the most widely-used 3D production system in the world (Autodesk 3ds Max).

Here are a few stories of of how these things came to pass: Mill Valley Oral History Project, CG Garage interview about WisdomVR, the making of “The Invisible Peak.”
