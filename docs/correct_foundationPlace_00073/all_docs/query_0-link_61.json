        "text": "We're activists, business leaders, policymakers, and residents. We all have a common goal: Cut greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) below net zero emissions by 2045. We are the hub of collaboration for bold climate solutions in Marin.\n\nour mission\n\nAt Marin Climate Action Network (MarinCAN), our mission is to catalyze transformative climate action in Marin County through collaboration, education, and equitable engagement. We are dedicated to mobilizing diverse stakeholders to implement effective solutions that reduce the causes and prepare for the impacts of climate change, while prioritizing equity and resilience. By fostering partnerships across sectors and empowering communities, we aim to build a sustainable future that safeguards our environment and enhances the well-being of all residents. Together, we can create a more climate-responsible and climate-resilient Marin for generations to come.\n\nour vision\n\nImagine a 2030 where all Marin County residents are working together to address climate change. Marin farms and ranches are contributing to improved air and healthier soil. Bicyclists and pedestrians are commuting to work on safe paths under clear blue skies. Half of the vehicles on the road no longer cause air pollution or contribute to climate change. We grow our food locally and feed those who live here with fresh, healthy produce. Marin residents use clean energy to warm and cool their homes, and consume goods more consciously.\n\nThis is our vision for a thriving, equitable, and resilient Marin: MarinCAN.\n\nEQUITY\n\nAt Marin Climate Action Network, we are committed to addressing climate change with a strong focus on equity and inclusivity. We recognize that the impacts of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, and therefore, we prioritize collaborative efforts that center equity in all our initiatives. By working together with diverse stakeholders, including local residents, community organizations, and policymakers, we aim to ensure that our strategies and solutions benefit everyone, especially those most affected by environmental injustices.\n\nOur approach emphasizes equitable access to resources, meaningful participation, and targeted outreach to underserved communities in Marin City, San Rafael, Novato, West Marin, and elsewhere. Through inclusive education, advocacy, and policy interventions, we strive to reduce disparities and empower communities to reduce climate change, prepare for its impacts, and thrive sustainably.\n\nTogether, we are building a more resilient Marin that leaves no one behind, fostering a climate movement that is equitable, just, and inclusive. Join us in this collective effort to create a healthy and sustainable environment for all residents.\n\nboard of directors\n\nWilliam (Bill) Keene, Treasurer\n\nBill previously served as the General Manager of Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District.
