        "text": "American software companyTemplate:SHORTDESC:American software company\n\nAutodesk is an American multinational software corporation that makes software services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California, and features a gallery of its customers' work[2] in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide. Its U.S. locations are Northern California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, New England, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Its Canada offices are located in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.\n\nThe company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, who was a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD. AutoCAD, which is the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software and Revit software are primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, and on projects from the One World Trade Center[3] to Tesla electric cars.[4]\n\nAutodesk became best known for AutoCAD, but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment—and a line of software for consumers, including Sketchbook. The company makes educational versions of its software available at no cost to qualified students and faculty through the Autodesk Education Community, and also as a donation to eligible nonprofits through TechSoup Global. The manufacturing industry uses Autodesk's digital prototyping software—including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite—to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model in the design process.[5] The company's Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[6]\n\nAutodesk's Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[7] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.\n\nHistory[]\n\nProducts[]\n\nPlatforms[]\n\nPlatform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) division develops and manages the product foundation for most Autodesk offerings across multiple markets, including Autodesk's flagship product AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD for Mac, and AutoCAD mobile app (formerly AutoCAD 360). Autodesk Suites, Subscription and Web Services, which includes Autodesk Cloud, Autodesk Labs, and Global Engineering are also part of PSEB. In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store.[8] Also part of PSEB is the Autodesk Consumer Product Group, which was created in November 2010 to generate interest in 3-D design and “foster a new wave of designers who hunger for sophisticated software”.[9] The products from the group include Motion FX, and SketchBook. Users range from children, students and artists to makers and DIYers.[10]\n\nTraining And Certification[]\n\nAutodesk offers certificates in two categories: Autodesk Certified User and Advanced Certified Professional.\n\nAutodesk Certified User- Verifies entry-level skills in key Autodesk products. Designed for students and instructors who wish to demonstrate basic proficiency. Curriculum, courseware, and exams offered for independent study or institutional integration.\n\nAdvanced Certified Professional- Validates more advanced skills, including complex workflow and design challenges. Designed for students seeking a competitive advantage in a specific product area.\n\nArchitecture, engineering and construction[]\n\nThe Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry group is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, in a LEED Platinum building[11] designed and built using Autodesk software.[12] Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD, and Revit, which is their flagship product for relational Building information modeling. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including BIM 360, Advance Steel, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including Civil 3D, and InfraWorks; and the MEP industry, including Fabrication CADmep. The Autodesk Services Marketplace offering helps its clients train their team in AEC Industry.[13] Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building,[14] the San Francisco Bay Bridge,[15] the Shanghai Tower, and New York's One World Trade Center.[16]\n\nGenetic engineering[]\n\nAutodesk Life Sciences is an extensible toolkit for genetic engineering. It visualises DNA code (Molecule Viewer), and has a tool for writing DNA code (genetic constructor). The tool allows work on molecule-level, rather than nucleobase-level (A, C, G, T) constructs.\n\nIn 2018, all projects were suspended.[17]\n\nManufacturing[]\n\nAutodesk's manufacturing industry group is headquartered in Portland, Oregon. The company's manufacturing software is used in various manufacturing segments, including industrial machinery, electro-mechanical, tool and die, industrial equipment, automotive components, and consumer products. Products include Fusion 360, the Product Design & Manufacturing Collection, Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, PowerShape, Alias Products, Factory Design Utilities, Autodesk Vault, Nastran In-CAD, Autodesk CFD (formerly Autodesk Simulation CFD), Moldflow, Netfabb, Autodesk HSM (formerly Inventor HSM), FeatureCAM, PowerMill, PowerInspect, and VRED.\n\nMedia and entertainment[]\n\nAutodesk Media and Entertainment products are designed for digital media creation, management, and delivery, from film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing to animation, game development, and design visualization. Autodesk's Media and Entertainment Division is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was established in 1999 after Autodesk, Inc. acquired Discreet Logic, Inc. and merged its operations with Kinetix. In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias, a developer of 3D graphics technology. In October 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand from Avid.[18] The principal product offerings from the Media and Entertainment Division are Flame, Smoke, and the Media & Entertainment Collection, which include Maya, 3ds Max, Arnold, MotionBuilder, Mudbox, and ReCap Pro.\n\nMuch of Avatar's visual effects were created with Autodesk media and entertainment software. Autodesk software enabled Avatar director James Cameron to aim a camera at actors wearing motion-capture suits in a studio and see them as characters in the fictional world of Pandora in the film.[19] Autodesk software also played a role in the visual effects of Alice in Wonderland, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Inception, Iron Man 2, King Kong, Gladiator, Titanic, and other films.[20]\n\nRenderers[]\n\nAutodesk develops and purchased many specific-purpose renderers but many Autodesk products had been bundled with third-party renderers such as NVIDIA Mental Ray or Iray.\n\nAutodesk Raytracer (ART; aka RapidRT[21]) - a simple path tracing renderer based on Opticore technology.[22][23]\n\nAutodesk Real Time Ray Tracing (Autodesk RTRT; formerly Opus RTRT) - a ray tracing rendering engine used in Autodesk Opticore Studio[24] and Autodesk Real-Time Ray Tracing Cluster\n\nAutodesk VRED - a OpenGL/Raytracing real-time and offline renderer that supports direct NURBS ray tracing\n\nRenderGin (formerly Augenblick MMV) - a discontinued realtime NURBS ray tracing renderer the technology was merged into VRED.[25]\n\nAutodesk Realtime Renderer (formerly VSR Realtime Renderer) - a discontinued ray tracing renderer for Rhinoceros 3D.\n\nArnold Renderer - a CPU-only unidirectional path tracing renderer for animation and visual effects\n\nTurtle - a primary texture-baking renderer in Maya LT; its baking technology was also used in Beast, a discontinued lighting middleware with baking tools.\n\nMaya Software - a scanline/raytracing hybrid renderer in Maya\n\n3ds Max Scanline - a scanline/ray tracing/radiosity hybrid renderer in 3ds Max\n\nLightscape - a discontinued radiosity renderer; its technologies were merged within Autodesk VIZ (later 3ds Max Design).[26]\n\nMaya Vector - a vector renderer based on Electric Rain's RAViX technology.[27]\n\nOne Graphics System - a GPU photorealistic/non-photorealistic renderer, aka Nitrous/Quicksilver[28] in 3ds Max and Viewport 2.0/Hardware 2.0 in Maya\n\nMaya Hardware - a legacy GPU rasterize renderer in Maya 2017 or earlier.\n\nCloud rendering services[]\n\nAutodesk Rendering (formerly A360 Rendering) - a simple cloud renderer\n\nLagoa MultiOptics - a discontinued cloud renderer for visualization\n\n3ds Max Cloud Rendering - a technology preview cloud rendering system for Arnold on 3ds Max.[29][30]\n\nAzure Batch Rendering - a cloud rendering system for Maya, 3ds Max and Arnold, which is provided by Autodesk and Microsoft.[31]\n\n[]\n\nAutodesk ImageStudio (formerly Alias ImageStudio) - a discontinued visualization tool based on mental ray, marketed for Autodesk Alias\n\nAutodesk Showcase - a discontinued design visualization tool\n\nAutodesk Opticore Studio (formerly Opus Studio) - a discontinued design visualization tool\n\nAutodesk VRED (formerly PI-VR VRED)\n\n3ds Max Interactive - a real-time visualization tool based on Autodesk Stingray, shipped within 3ds Max.\n\nRevit Live - a real-time visualization service for Autodesk Revit\n\nDiscontinued products[]\n\nSome of Autodesk's \"retired\" products are listed here:\n\nLightscape 3.2 Was the world's only radiosity rendering package at the time (1991) developed from work done by Donald Greenberg at the Cornell University Department of Computer Graphics. The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, while existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped.[citation needed]\n\nVolo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.\n\nAutodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cel-based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.\n\nCyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in \"realtime\". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles.\n\nAutoSketch\n\nAutoShade\n\nAutoCAD Survey (Autodesk Survey)\n\nCivil Design\n\nAutoCAD Civil 3D Land Desktop Companion (AutoCAD Land Desktop)\n\nAutodesk Mechanical Desktop\n\nAutoCAD Freestyle, released in April 26, 2010 and discontinued January 31, 2011.\n\nAutodesk Fluid FX\n\nAutodesk Time FX\n\nInventor Fusion was discontinued August 23, 2014 due to redundancies with Fusion 360.[32]\n\nSketchbook designer has been discontinued as of November 1, 2012[33]\n\nSoftimage was discontinued after the release of Softimage 2015 in April 14, 2014.\n\nFace Robot\n\nLagoa Multiphysics\n\nAutodesk Stitcher Unlimited\n\nAutodesk ImageModeler\n\nAutodesk Movimento (formerly Realviz Movimento)\n\nAutodesk Combustion\n\nDiscreet Effect (formerly Illuminaire Composition)\n\nDiscreet Paint (formerly Illuminaire Paint)\n\nCleaner Streaming Studio\n\nCleaner Live\n\nCleaner\n\nCinestream (formerly EditDV)\n\n3D software for game modification\n\ngmax\n\nMaya PLE[34]\n\nXSI Mod Tool\n\nAutodesk Topobase Client - its feature was merged into AutoCAD Map 3D.[35]\n\nAutodesk Topobase Web - its feature was merged into Autodesk Infrastructure Map Server.[35]\n\nAutodesk Opticore Realizer (formerly Opus Realizer)\n\nAutodesk Opticore Studio (formerly Opus Studio)\n\nAutodesk AutoCAD ecscad - the product was replaced by AutoCAD Electrical.[36]\n\nAutoCAD Structural Detailing[37]\n\ntsElements for SolidWorks[38]\n\nFBX Converter\n\nFBX QuickTime Viewer\n\nAutodesk Scaleform Unity Integration[39]\n\nRevit variants\n\nAutodesk Revit Architecture - its features were merged into Revit itself.[40]\n\nAutodesk Revit Structure - its features were merged into Revit itself.[40]\n\nAutodesk Revit MEP - its features were merged into Revit itself.[40]\n\nAutodesk Ecotect Analysis[41]\n\nBuzzsaw[42] - the service was replaced by BIM 360 Docs.[42]\n\nMockup 360[43] - the tool was replaced by A360 Viewer.[43]\n\nAutodesk Remote[44]\n\nInventor Engineer-to-Order[45]\n\nAutodesk Advance Concrete[46]\n\nAutodesk Quantity Takeoff - some features of the product were merged into Autodesk Navisworks Simulate.[47]\n\nAutodesk 123D\n\nAutodesk 3D Print Utility - its features were merged into the Meshmixer.[48]\n\nAutodesk 123D CNC Utility\n\nAutodesk 123D Sculpt+ (formerly 123D Sculpt and Sculpt 123D)\n\nAutodesk 123D Make - its slice feature was now in \"Slicer for Fusion 360\" add-in.[49][50]\n\nAutodesk 123D Catch (formerly Project Photofly)\n\nAutodesk 123D Circuits (a.k.a.

This tool provided made it affordable for smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies to create detailed technical drawings.\n\nAutodesk became a public company in 1985. John Walker did not enjoy the process of writing the prospectus, relating the process to \"lying on the beach or juggling chainsaws\".[99]\n\nRelease 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP.[100] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.\n\nSubsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS & Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.\n\nAutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[101] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.\n\nIn 1989, Autodesk's sales grew to over $100,000,000 after just four operational years.[102]\n\nIn the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.\n\nIn 2007, Timothy Vernor sued Autodesk (Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.), alleging that he was entitled to resell \"used\" copies of AutoCAD software on eBay. He had obtained the software from an Autodesk licensee at an office liquidation sale.[103] A federal district judge in Washington state denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[104] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a \"sale with restrictions on use\"[105] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. Autodesk appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[106] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[107]\n\nAutodesk introduced its current logo at the TED conference in Long Beach, California on February 26, 2013.[108][109][110]\n\nAutodesk announced the largest lay off in its history on Nov 27th 2017 with the lay off of 1,150 jobs.

Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[158][159] Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company's gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk's C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company's global GDP contribution.[160] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.\n\nIn 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e² Design,[161] which focused on green building design around the world, describing the leaders and technologies that drive sustainable design.\n\nSee also[]\n\nDigital Prototyping\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nBusiness data for Autodesk:\n\nYahoo!
