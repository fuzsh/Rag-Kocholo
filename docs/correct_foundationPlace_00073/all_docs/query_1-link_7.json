        "text": "Short films, original music and photographs by Gary Yost, award-winning immersive creator located in Marin County, California.\n\nI've been making films and photographs since the 1960s. Initially crazy enough to attempt a career in photography, I began creating computer animation software in the 1980s and was responsible for the creation of the most widely-used 3D production system in the world (Autodesk 3ds Max).\n\nHere are a few stories of of how these things came to pass: Mill Valley Oral History Project, CG Garage interview about WisdomVR, the making of “The Invisible Peak.”\n\nOther more recent projects include:\n\nwww.insidecovid19vr.com. Emmy-nominated immersive VR documentary about an American doctor’s fight for his patients, and his life.\n\nwww.wisdomvr.org: What is the future of human memory? What will people know about us when we are gone? The goal of WisdomVR experiences is to capture the essence and distilled wisdom of a person and share that in a simple but immersive setting.\n\nwww.fijisings.com: Deep dive into how music and dance is inextricably linked to the Fijian people. Created as an artist-in-residence sponsored by the Naqaqa Giving Foundation.\n\nInteractive timeline of the history of Mt. Tam’s West Peak, and two video profiles about volunteer work for the mountain: Open Road \"Magical Mt. Tamalpais\" and “Beloved Bay Area Mountain may be getting an environmental makeover.”"
