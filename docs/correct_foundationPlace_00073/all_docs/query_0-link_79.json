        "text": "TechTown has selected Autodesk software solutions for its educational programs. Autodesk is offering their full software suite to TechTown, so local students, educators and other organizations can experiment and create with the same software that designs buildings, smartphones, movie characters and high-performance vehicles.\n\n“We’re thrilled about this partnership because it will allow students in our area to learn state-of-the-art application software while having fun with cutting-edge technology,” said Mike Harrell, chair of the TechTown Foundation board. “Autodesk software is used by professionals in STEAM fields globally, and bringing it to Chattanooga’s children will unlock a wealth of career opportunities for them as they move from school to the workforce. We are already in discussions with several local companies about building a technology curriculum that will meet company needs immediately upon graduation.”\n\nTechTown will utilize the software as part of their Learning Partnerships, where they currently serve over 400 students per month in during and after school programs in six schools.\n\n“Our partnership with Autodesk will be a game changer for students in our community. This partnership will allow TechTown to expose students to technologies and prepare them for jobs in industries where Autodesk products are highly desirable for their workforce of the future”, said Chris Ramsey, CEO of TechTown.\n\n“We were attracted to TechTown in part because of their Learning Partnership model that gives kids from all socioeconomic backgrounds access to hands-on STEAM learning and technology,\" said Kim Renshaw, AMER director, Technical Specialists. \"We’re perfectly paired to bring technology to young learners. We see the TechTown model as a benchmark for the nation in helping prepare a workforce for the future.”"
