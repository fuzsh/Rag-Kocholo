        "text": "Giving In Marin - 16th Annual Heart Of Marin Awards\n\nFriday, January 09, 2009\n\nLots of cheers, some tears and a sold-out crowd were on hand as Marin County volunteers were honored at the 16th annual Heart of Marin Awards ceremony luncheon at the Marin Civic Center.\n\nTake a look here at the photo album...story continues below-\n\nA record 750 attendees gathered under a magical, twinkie-light strung ceiling to honor and celebrate the work of 141 volunteer nominees in the annual event sponsored by the Center for Volunteer and Nonprofit Leadership of Marin (CVNL) along with Tamalpais Bank. As she has for the last several years, KRON4 television and KCBS radio film critic Jan Wahl, served as Mistress of Ceremonies.\n\nSeven award categories included the Champion Award, Excellence in Leadership, Excellence in Board Leadership, Volunteer of the Year, Youth Volunteer of the Year, Achievement in Non-Profit Excellence and Corporate Community Service.\n\n\"We have a crisis in confidence and we need to divert that crisis so that we can avoid a crisis in the community.\"\n\nMark Garwood CEO for Tamalpais Bank, made that reference to the gloomy economy in his opening remarks and reminded the crowd of the the challenges facing the nonprofit sector in the current climate.\n\nGarwood then followed that remark by announcing his bank would accelerate their financial donations and he encouraged others to do the same citing 'time, talent and treasure' as the mantra for giving. Tamalpais Bank created the Heart of Marin award sixteen years ago and has been a major sponsor every year.\n\nLinda Davis, CEO for CVNL followed Garwood to the podium and she also made reference to the economy-\n\n\"Transformations evolve from crisis,\" she said, \"Together we can be the transformation we await.\"\n\nDavis also lamented the lack of elected officials in attendance (many were represented by their staff instead) and then whooped it up for Marin County Supervisor Susan Adams who was there in person.\n\nThen the business of handing out the awards began with emcee Wahl keeping up an entertaining patter of quips and remarks in between the categories. Cash awards were provided by sponsors Autodesk, Marin Community Foundation, Bank of Marin, Bregante + Company, LLP and Woodlands Market.\n\nThere was a tie for the first award, Volunteer of the Year. Housing was the theme for both winners. Jean Taylor got the award for her work with Homeward Bound of Marin and the opening of Next Key Center, and 19 year-old Vincent Chew won for his work on creating housing connections for the homeless, gang intervention and community outreach with Ambassadors of Hope and Opportunity, an organization that helps young homeless adults.\n\nNext up was the Excellence in Board Leadership and Linda Tavaszi of Marin Community Clinics was honored for her work on the recent expansion of this important community medical program and facility.\n\nThe Bank of Marin garnered the award in the Corporate Community Service category for their contributions to volunteerism, including their practice of allowing employees time off to volunteer during work hours.\n\nYouth Volunteer of the Year category is always a draw and five were given out. The recipients list of accomplishments were impressive, especially given their ages.\n\nMiddle school student Lauren Grieve was lauded for her work towards improving health conditions in Marin and overseas in Monrovia, Japan and Chili with her organization, Meridian Health Foundation.\n\nHannah Bichkoff from Terra Linda High School was also honored for her efforts in health and safety issues both overseas and locally with the Rotary Interact Club. Bichkoff also helped a Burmese family acclimate to life in the U.S.\n\nCaroline Mulroy, a Temescal High student, got an award for her work in Mama Hope an organization that seeks to provide resources for developing countries. Mulroy's project; she raised enough money to fund and build a system that provides clean, safe water to a village in Kenya.\n\nSan Rafael High student Cindy Ku's work with Next Generation Scholars, an organization that seeks to help low-income student find their way into college, nabbed her an award. Ku's hard work to close the 'educational equity gap' in Marin earned her high praise, especially for the College Bound Club she started at SRHS.\n\nThe final recipient also from San Rafael High was Javier Espinoza. Espinoza drew on personal experience with his volunteerism efforts in helping victims of domestic abuse. Growing up in an abusive household, Espinoza and his mother endured beatings from his father. Espinoza channeled that harrowing experience into his work for Marin Abused Women's Services. He created something called \"Mothers Day In A Box\", a box package containing food and gifts that he supplied to the moms in the shelter on Mother's Day. He expanded it to \"Back to School In A Box\" with backpacks and school supplies for the children of abuse victims. Espinoza would like to create boxes for Holidays as well.\n\nAfter receiving their awards, the Youth Volunteers received a standing ovation from the entire room.\n\nExcellence In Leadership award was presented next to Cris Chater for her work with Senior Access, the only adult day services program available in Marin for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimers. Chater dedicated her award to the families of her clients.\n\nThis year, the Champion Award was awarded posthumously to Pam Hamilton for her outstanding work in the nonprofit sector. Pam was the founder of Hamilton PR a Marin-based publicity agency. She passed away last September from cancer and her husband, Pete Lewis, accepted the award on her behalf. He recalled Pam's passion and in a reference to the bad economy, he said she would want everyone to 'redouble' their efforts.\n\nThe last honor awarded was for Achievement in Nonprofit Excellence and that one went to a Marin favorite, Bread and Roses. Bread and Roses has been providing music to the incarcerated, the indigent, the impoverished and the isolated for 35 years.\n\nLinda Davis asked the winners to join her onstage and then the ceremony was over, at least for another year.\n\nPhoto Album with all the photos here\n\nFollowing are the complete list of nominees and sponsors-\n\nChampion Award\n\nThe Champion Award this year will be given posthumously to Pam Hamilton, a Marin-based publicist who was well known and respected for her work with the nonprofit sector.
