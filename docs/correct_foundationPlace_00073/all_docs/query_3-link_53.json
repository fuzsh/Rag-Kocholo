        "text": "How Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation Still Affects the Livelihood of Millions of Americans\n\nAlthough there has been great progress seen in the area of LGBTQ+ issues, there is still much work left to be done. In 2021, we experienced a wave of anti-transgender state legislation: 81 bills aimed to prevent transgender youth from playing school sports consistent with their gender identity, and 43 bills to prevent transgender youth from receiving gender-affirming healthcare. Additionally, two bathroom bills were passed in Tennessee and Arkansas passed the first-ever ban preventing transgender youth from accessing gender-affirming care. By the end of the 2021 legislative session, another record 13 bills attacking transgender youth passed into law.\n\nAlthough the transgender community received the brunt of discriminatory legislation, anti-LGBTQ+ bills took other forms as well, and one of the most notable trends was a resurgence of laws that carve all-new religious exemptions into existing laws that allows people to refuse to serve LGBTQ+ individuals. Across the country, 44 religious refusal bills were filed including about a dozen so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) bills and a dozen more bills that would allow for religious refusals, including against LGBTQ+ patients, in medical care. South Dakota and Montana passed RFRA legislation and Ohio passed a medical care refusal bill.\n\nWhile this historically bad year has been the backdrop of the 2021 legislative session, 44 new pro-equality laws were also passed. The equality bills range in topic from ensuring that utility companies allow consumers to change their names and pronouns; to streamlining adoption requirements for stepparents; to ensuring that places of public accommodation have gender-neutral bathrooms; to make it easier to update birth and death certificates with correct names and gender markers. All ensure that LGBTQ+ people are able to take one step closer to full legal and lived equality.\n\nEven as progress is made, as of the time of this report, only 22 states (and the District of Columbia) offer full LGBTQ+ non-discrimination protections to their residents. The remaining 28 states offer either no LGBTQ+ non-discrimination protections or in some way exclude a key group from their laws, leaving these groups without legislative protection.\n\nWhile discrimination can’t be prevented by legal protections alone, without federal or state legislation prohibiting it, millions of LGBTQ+ Americans and their families live in fear that the prejudice and hatred of others can, legally, destroy their livelihood. HRC, its partners, and supporters will continue to work toward the goal of all 50 states having LGBTQ+ non-discrimination protections written into law. We will also continue to advocate for passage of the Equality Act, federal legislation that would provide consistent and explicit anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people across key areas of life, including employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, federally funded programs, and jury service.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Foundation would also like to acknowledge that 2021 was the deadliest year in history for transgender and non-binary people. Over 50 persons who identified as transgender or non-binary are known to have experienced violent deaths in 2021, with more than 50% of those victims being Black or Latinx. It has become increasingly unsafe to be transgender, especially as a person of color or other minority, and HRC is committed to working towards a future where members of the LGBTQ+ community are not violently targeted due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nHRC’s dedication, focus, and drive to make workplaces and our broader society a more diverse, inclusive, and safe environment for the LGBTQ+ community is unwavering. The 20-year anniversary of the CEI merely marks the next chapter in our fight for equality.\n\nAccelerating Global Equality\n\nThe business case for equality knows no borders\n\nIn the 20-year history of the Corporate Equality Index, survey data has explicitly shown that having an inclusive workplace is beneficial to a company’s success. The data doesn’t lie - being an LGBTQ+ inclusive1 employer positively impacts recruitment, retention, engagement and, overall, total revenue. Although the push for LGBTQ+ inclusive workplaces began largely as an undertaking within the United States and Europe, the conversation around inclusivity is now pointedly more prominent among international stakeholders. The bottom line is undeniable – in a global marketplace, equality knows no borders.\n\nWorking hand-in-hand with both U.S.-based and international businesses, HRC made the case that inclusion efforts did not have to be contained to any one border. With many multinational companies employing persons outside of the United States, HRC encouraged CEI participants to consider how their adopted inclusive policies and practices could and would impact their workforces in countries with less tolerant legal and cultural stances towards LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nTo this effort, in 2016, the Corporate Equality Index criteria were expanded to require that companies with global operations extend their nondiscrimination policies across all their operations. This change helped drive more widespread adoption of nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation and gender identity protections. In 2016, 54% of CEI-rated companies had global operations and 95 percent of those companies extended their LGBTQ+ inclusive nondiscrimination policies globally. With the 2022 CEI, 56 percent of rated companies have global operations and over 99 percent extend those protections globally.\n\nThe process towards LGBTQ+ inclusion does not end with nondiscrimination policies. Companies continue to amplify their global LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts through the targeted expansion of equitable benefits and inclusive practices. Globally, companies are adopting critical benefits such as domestic partner recognition and transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits. These companies are also deepening employee engagement efforts by expanding employee resource groups for LGBTQ+ workers and their allies.\n\nIn the past, and for this 2022 edition, the CEI survey collected information on global efforts to provide domestic partner benefits and transgender-inclusive benefits, support for global chapters of employee resource groups, and whether companies engage externally with LGBTQ+ communities outside the U.S. Across all categories, a majority of companies report extending these benefits and inclusive practices beyond U.S. borders.\n\n1At the HRC Foundation, we use the acronym “LGBTQ+” to represent the diversity of the greater lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities. We recognize that this acronym is U.S.-centric and that communities around the world recognize different identities and acronyms. When working in different communities, we adjust our language to reflect local customs.\n\nCriteria 2: Inclusive Benefits\n\nIN THE U.S. EMPLOYER-PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE IS THE SINGLE LARGEST source of healthcare coverage. Competitive employer-provided benefits packages are critical to attracting and retaining talent. Widespread employer adoption of such packages helps to ensure that offering LGBTQ+ inclusive benefits to employees and their families is a low-cost, high-return proposition for businesses. In addition, equitable benefits structures align with the principle of equal compensation for equal work. Apart from actual wages paid, benefits can account, on average, for approximately 30 percent of employees’ overall compensation (BOL 2019). By amending their benefits structures, employers ensure that they extend this valuable bundle of benefits to their workforce equitably, irrespective of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nMost employers have reported an overall increase of less than 3.5 percent in total benefits costs when they implement partner benefits and marginal increases related to transgender-inclusive healthcare coverage (i.e., a fraction of a decimal point of cost calculations).\n\nThe HRC Foundation rates and gives guidance on two key components of equal health insurance benefits:\n\nParity between benefits available for employees’ spouses and partners; and,\n\nAffirmative transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits and removal of all broad exclusions to coverage across plan offerings.\n\nIn addition, employers are rated on having full parity across their entire suite of benefits – including non-healthcare benefits such as leave, retirement, and others – between spouses and partners.\n\nLGBTQ+-inclusive benefits packages are:\n\nNecessary for talent acquisition and retention and broader economic growth;\n\nEqual compensation for equal work;\n\nHelping employers keep pace with changing legal landscape and workforce expectations; and,\n\nMinimal upfront costs (on average 1% increase for corporate employers’ overall health insurance costs).\n\nThe premise of parity underlies the inclusive benefits section of the CEI criteria. In its CEI scoring, the HRC Foundation does not penalize an employer if a particular benefit is not offered to any employees but holds employers accountable to provide LGBTQ+ employees and their families with the same benefits available to other employees across available benefits packages. For example, where routine care, hormone therapies, and medically necessary surgeries are available to cisgender (non-transgender) people, these same healthcare benefits must also be extended to transgender people covered by the plan. Many employers have begun to comprehensively address health insurance coverage for transgender individuals, and most have experienced insignificant or no premium increases as a result.\n\nContinued Need for Partner Benefits\n\nSince 2002, the CEI has required parity between spousal and partner benefits. After the United States v. Windsor and before the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court rulings, HRC released a position paper cautioning against a marriage-only standard for accessing healthcare coverage, which is an unreasonable standard given the many other legal vulnerabilities that continue to affect LGBTQ+ individuals’ freedom beyond their right to marry.\n\nSince the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which brought marriage equality nationwide by ruling that marriage is a fundamental right to which same-sex couples should have the same access as opposite-sex couples, employers have sought to do the right thing in the name of equality and provide spousal benefits to both same- and different-sex married couples. Many employers assumed that the marriage ruling obviated the need for partner benefits; however, this is not true. While marriage equality is undoubtedly a monumental step toward full equality, LGBTQ+ individuals remain at risk for discrimination in many other aspects of daily life. These vulnerabilities continue to create barriers for many LGBTQ+ Americans to exercise their legal right to marry. In the absence of sexual orientation and gender identity protections through federal and consistent state law, LGBTQ+ individuals remain vulnerable to discrimination in housing, access to public places, federal funding, credit, education, jury service, and, in some cases, employment (for employees not covered under Title VII). For example, while LGBTQ+ Americans can get legally married, this lack of guaranteed protection in other domains means newly married LGBTQ+ couples are at risk for eviction from their home by a discriminatory landlord that sees their wedding photos on social media. Until LGBTQ+ Americans have full equality through the federal Equality Act, domestic partner benefits will remain an essential CEI standard that helps to fill the void left by federal and state law and ensure LGBTQ+ workers and their families receive equitable benefits whether married or partnered.\n\nDomestic partner benefits do not only serve same-sex couples. In fact, over the last decade, most businesses that have offered same-sex partner benefits also extended these to different-sex partners. In other words, businesses have increasingly recognized the value of decoupling benefits from the legal definition of marriage to meet the needs of their diverse workforces.\n\nWhile HRC never changed its partner benefits mandate, a small number of companies moved to spousal benefits-only policies in the middle of the 2016 CEI season. Out of an abundance of understanding for participating companies, credit was given for spousal equivalent benefits in the 2016-18 CEIs. After wide-scale education and outreach efforts, the 2019 CEI resumed enforcement of the standard for both same- and different-sex domestic partner benefits. In total, 732 businesses met the standard in 2019, 836 in 2020, 892 in 2021, and 975 in 2022. The CEI continues to reflect best practices for LGBTQ+ workers and their families.\n\nHRC is proud to partner with leading employers on corporate initiatives that drive equality. These corporate initiatives include the Business Statement on Anti-LGBTQ+ State Legislation, the LGBTQ+ Refugees Mentorship Initiative, and Working Positively, which invites employers to commit to being visible role models in support of HIV-positive employees and other chronic illnesses.\n\nOne of the largest coalition initiatives is the Business Coalition for the Equality Act.\n\nHRC’s Business Coalition for the Equality Act is a group of 503 leading U.S. employers that support the Equality Act, federal legislation that would provide the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people that are provided to other federally protected groups. Coalition member companies represent nearly every industry, employ over 15.3 million people in the U.S., command over $7.2 trillion in revenue, and have operations in all 50 states.\n\nThe Equality Act creates clear, consistent protections to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment ensuring that LGBTQ+ employees are hired, fired, and promoted based on their performance. In addition, the bill provides protections from discrimination in housing, credit, and jury service for LGBTQ+ people. The bill also prohibits discrimination in public spaces and services and protects against discrimination in the receipt of federal funding on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n\nThe historic Obergefell v. Hodges case in 2015 gave same-sex couples the right to marriage, and, since then, state legislators across the country have responded by proposing hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills. However, companies opposed (and still oppose) these discriminatory bills. Over the last seven years, countless companies in all 50 states have spoken out against attempts to undermine LGBTQ+ civil rights. Discriminatory bills that attempt to curb access to public services for transgender people, deny basic services to LGBTQ+ families, or preempt local nondiscrimination ordinances put company employees, employee families, and customers at risk.\n\nCEI-rated employers are on record supporting broad issues of LGBTQ+ equality at the local, state, and federal levels, including through amicus briefs that are submitted during court cases to support pro-LGBTQ+ legislation and rulings.\n\nCorporate Equality Index 2022\n\nThe HRC Foundation’s CEI rating system is designed for mid- to large-sized businesses (500 full-time employees and above) and divided into three key categories of criteria:\n\nNondiscrimination policies across business entities;\n\nEquitable benefits for LGBTQ+ workers and their families;\n\nSupporting an inclusive culture and corporate social responsibility.\n\nLaunched in 2002, the CEI is the first internationally recognized benchmarking report for businesses to gauge their level of LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion against competitors. In addition to seeing a growth in the number of highly-rated employers, the CEI has also seen great success in the reach of the survey. The number of employers officially rated has expanded from 319 original participants to a current participant count of 1,271, encompassing all major industry sectors.\n\nInvitations and Participation\n\nThe largest and most successful U.S. employers are invited to participate in the CEI and are identified through the following lists*:\n\nFortune magazine’s 1,000 largest publicly traded businesses (2019 Fortune 1000) and\n\nAmerican Lawyer magazine’s top 200 revenue grossing law firms (2020 AmLaw 200).\n\nAdditionally, any private-sector, for-profit employer with 500 or more full-time U.S. employees can request to participate, including those that are privately held.\n\n*Note: Due to the staggered timelines of the ranking lists and when contact lists are made available, the ranking year lags the CEI survey year by one year and the CEI publication year by up to two years.\n\nHow We Obtain the Information\n\nThe primary source of information for the Corporate Equality Index rating each business received is the CEI survey sent every year to previous and prospective respondents. The web-based survey included links to sample policies and other guidance, found on the HRC Foundation website.\n\nHRC Foundation staff provided additional assistance and direct consultation throughout the process and reviewed submitted documentation (required within each section) for appropriate language and consistency with survey answers.\n\nInvitations for the CEI 2022 survey were emailed and mailed in May of 2021 and responses were due back in August of 2021. If a business had previously participated in the CEI, surveys were first sent to the individual(s) responsible for prior submissions. If a business had not previously participated in the CEI, surveys were sent to the chief executive officer or managing partner of the firm, as well as the highest-level executive(s) responsible for human resources, diversity, communications, or community engagement, if obtaining the contact information for these executives was possible.\n\nThe information required to generate CEI ratings for businesses is difficult to ascertain from public records alone. In addition to the self-reporting provided through the CEI survey, we investigated and cross-checked the policies and practices of the rated businesses, any connections with organizations that engage in anti-LGBTQ+ activities, and news accounts of efforts that undermine LGBTQ+ equality writ large (e.g., through case law efforts or public policy lobbying actions). Employers were not rated until all appropriate information had been gathered and verified to the greatest extent possible. Businesses were invited to provide HRC Foundation staff with any additional information or updates before this report went to print.\n\nIn total, the sources used include:\n\nThe HRC Foundation’s CEI survey;\n\nInternal Revenue Service 990 tax filings reviewed for any business foundation’s gifts to anti-LGBTQ+ groups;\n\nCase law and news accounts regarding findings of discrimination and corporate responsibility and the LGBTQ+ community at-large; and,\n\nIndividuals that report information to HRC Foundation.\n\nIf a business was found to have a connection with an anti-LGBTQ+ organization or activity, the HRC Foundation contacted the business and provided it with an opportunity to respond and, to the best of its ability, to mitigate the harm done and ensure that no such action would occur in the future. Businesses unwilling to do so would have been penalized 25 points from their overall rating through Criterion 4.\n\nOfficial and Unofficial Ratings\n\nThe HRC Foundation may have rated businesses that did not submit a survey for a 2022 rating if the business has submitted a survey in previous years and the information is determined to be accurate, or, if the HRC Foundation has obtained sufficient information to provide an individual rating. In both cases, the HRC Foundation notified the business of the official rating and gave them an opportunity to provide updates or clarification prior to the report release.\n\nFortune 500-ranked businesses that, after multiple invitations, have never responded to the CEI survey were evaluated independently and have designated unofficial ratings listed in gray in Appendix A. The HRC Foundation proactively evaluates these 112 Fortune-ranked companies for two key reasons:\n\nTo provide the public with accurate information on these key employers; and\n\nTo ensure the CEI is truly a benchmarking report among peers.\n\nBecause LGBTQ+ workers and prospective employees must navigate the gaps in federal and state protections that affect their employment decisions, our staff assesses the research on these non-surveyed businesses through this same lens, ascertaining what we can from publicly available information and applying those findings to our CEI criteria.\n\nNo matter the rating, any business that participates in the CEI is taking on a transparent, credible process of LGBTQ+ inclusion. The HRC Foundation commends the employers that have committed to the public and transparent process of the CEI survey and we invite these 112 companies to do the same.\n\nIn total, the CEI 2022 contains official ratings for 379 Fortune 500 businesses, 573 Fortune 1000 businesses, 166 law firms and 726 additional major businesses. With the additional 112 Fortune 500 businesses that have unofficial ratings, the total number of rated businesses is 1,383. Findings in the 2022 CEI report are based on the 1,271 officially rated businesses."
