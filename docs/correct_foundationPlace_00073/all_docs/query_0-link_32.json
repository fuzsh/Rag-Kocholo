        "text": "Prepare to be bewitched by August Wilson's lyrical 1940s entry into his Pittsburgh Cycle, a remarkable decade-by-decade exploration of the African-American experience in the 20th century. Kent Gash, director of the musical theater and acting studio at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, directs this moving epic that finds abundant spirit in the everyday and overflows with music, mystery and humor.\n\nReleased from the workhouse, Floyd \"Schoolboy\" Barton returns to the Hill District to discover that he has a hit record! Even though the bluesman does not have two nickels to rub together, nothing is going to stop him from taking advantage of this opportunity... until he is found dead. Schoolboy's story becomes the bass line to the many melodies - lively, menacing, brooding - that rise from this vibrant community.\n\nLENGTH OF SHOW\n\n2 hours 50 minutes (includes one intermission)\n\nFor All Events Blog\n\n\"Dynamite... The strength of Seven Guitars is in the superb pitch-perfect acting of the ensemble with each having their turn in the spotlight... Marin Theatre Company has again come up with a winner in the total production.\"\n\nMarin Independant Journal\n\n\"Beautifully executed... all that time we spend with the gang pays off; when the end comes, it packs a wallop. Gash and the superb cast handle the play deftly... it plays out magnificently.\"\n\nMill Valley Patch/Bay Area News Service\n\n\"The show is vibrant, colorful... [with] uniformly powerful cast, staging and design.\"\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"Dynamic and compelling... The lyrical cadences of Wilson's blues-driven words soar and thrill as delivered by, yes, seven pitch-perfect actors.\"\n\nSan Francisco Examiner\n\n\"Insightful... It's a brilliant ensemble, but Wilson's 'Guitars' demands nothing less. He wrote the blues like a 20th century Shakespeare, and Marin's cast makes every word sing.\"\n\nStage and Cinema Blog\n\n\"Late playwright August Wilson's reputed knack for capturing time, place, and character crystallizes unforgettably in the Marin Theatre Company's production of Seven Guitars... Visually stunning and psychically rich, this quirkily enchanting production succeeds in bringing Wilson's vision of the black American experience to life.\"\n\nTheater Dogs Blog\n\n\"Beautiful productionâ€¦ you leave the theater fully convinced that words and music can combine in powerfully emotional ways both in and out of songs, in the cadence of poetry and in the rhythm of everyday language... [Director Kent] Gash's ensemble is fantastic: Margo Hall, L. Peter Callender, Marc Damon Johnson, Omoze Idehenre, Charles Branklyn, Tobie Windham and Shinelle Azoroh. Each actor has at least one moment of transcendence, and that fact alone makes this show worth seeing.\""
