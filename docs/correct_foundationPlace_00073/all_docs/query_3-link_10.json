        "text": "Welcome!\n\nWelcome to this Systems Thinking Marin “About” web page. My name is Felicia Chavez, and I’m the founder of Systems Thinking Marin (STM). (You can read a bit about me in my bio further down this page.)\n\nSTM was active August 2017 to August 2022, and officially closed in December of 2023. This website remains active as an educational resource.\n\nI’d like you to take two things away from this website.\n\nOne: clarity about importance of shifting our dominant default worldview here in Marin County from linear to cyclical; from short-term to long-term; from mono-cultural to multi-cultural; from an extractive economic system to a regenerative economic system.\n\nTwo: a clear idea of where to start, and how to help. If this last one is not clear to you after poking around, watching the Systems Thinking Mini-Course, and checking out the SDG initiative page, I am here to clarify next steps for you and / or your organization. (I do actually have very specific steps available.) Contact page.\n\nAnn Blake\n\nAdvisory Committee Member\n\nAnn Blake, Ph.D., is an Environmental and Public Health consultant with over 25 years of experience finding safer alternatives to industrial chemicals in global manufacturing. Ann was born in Singapore and grew up in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia, graduating from high school at the International School Bangkok. The systems worldview is key in Ann’s work, which spans creating criteria for environmentally preferable purchasing, ecolabels and product rating systems, to local, national and international chemicals policy reform, among a variety of other pursuits. She has a B.A. from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, and a Ph.D. in molecular genetics and neural development from the University of Oregon.\n\nAnn has consulted with organizations such as the Garfield Foundation’s Cancer-Free Economy Network, the City of San Francisco’s Department of Environment, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Blue-Green Alliance, a national strategic partnership between labor unions and environmental organizations.\n\nDr. Blake is a member of the Green Ribbon Science Panel created by the California legislature to advise California EPA on the implementation of California’s Safer Consumer Product regulations. She currently co-chairs the board of Women’s Voices for the Earth in Missoula, Montana, and the board of the UC Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry.\n\nPrior to consulting, Ann worked for the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Department of Toxic Substances Control as a hazardous waste inspector and Pollution Prevention Coordinator.\n\nAnn’s consulting company, Environmental & Public Health Consulting, is proud to be a certified B Corp and a 2015 and 2016 B Corp Best for the Environment awardee.\n\nAdditional Background\n\nAnn’s career path was informed by her parent’s work at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP). Her parents were also university professors, her father a professor of economics at the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang, Malaysia, and several other universities in Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. Her mother was a professor of sociology and social work at the National University of Singapore.\n\nAnn came early to an awareness of community and worker impacts of manufacturing of consumer products while assisting her mother’s Ph.D. research on female electronics workers in the free-trade zone in Penang, Malaysia in the 1970s. She has continued this work with predominantly female immigrant populations in the US who take low barrier to entry employment (hotel room cleaning, house cleaning, garment cleaning, nail salons, etc.) that include disproportionate exposures to chemicals in the workplace.\n\nAnn and her husband currently reside in Alameda, CA, and is active in local climate change mitigation and adaptation work, among other issue areas.\n\nwww.annblake.com"
