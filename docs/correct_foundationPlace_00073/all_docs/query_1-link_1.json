        "text": "American software company\n\nAutodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that provides software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Francisco, California,[2] and has offices worldwide. Its U.S. offices are located in the states of California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Its Canada offices are located in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.\n\nThe company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, who was a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD. AutoCAD is the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software and, along with its 3D design software Revit, is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, and on projects from the One World Trade Center[3] to Tesla electric cars.[4]\n\nAutodesk became best known for AutoCAD, but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment—and a line of software for consumers. The manufacturing industry uses Autodesk's digital prototyping software—including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite—to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model in the design process.[5] The company's Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[6]\n\nAutodesk's Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[7] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development\n\nThe company was founded by John Walker and a team of programmers in 1982.[8] Walker founded the company after acquiring Interact, a computer-aided design program that operated on microcomputers running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool provided made it affordable for smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies to create detailed technical drawings. The program had been developed by Michael Riddle in 1979. Riddle had struggled to sell the program, and agreed to sell it to Walker in exchange for royalties. The program was further developed and renamed AutoCAD.[9][10]\n\nAutodesk became a public company in 1985. John Walker did not enjoy the process of writing the prospectus, relating the process to \"lying on the beach or juggling chainsaws\".[11]\n\nRelease 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP.[12] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.\n\nSubsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS & Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.\n\nAutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[13] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.\n\nIn 1989, Autodesk's sales grew to over $100,000,000 after just four operational years.[9]\n\nWalker remained a programmer at Autodesk until 1994, when he left due to disagreements with changes at the company.[8] With the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added several significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.\n\nIn 2007, Timothy Vernor sued Autodesk (Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.), alleging that he was entitled to resell \"used\" copies of AutoCAD software on eBay. He had obtained the software from an Autodesk licensee at an office liquidation sale.[14] A federal district judge in Washington denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[15] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a \"sale with restrictions on use\"[16] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. Autodesk appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[17] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[18]\n\nAutodesk introduced a new logo at the TED conference in Long Beach, California, on February 26, 2013.[19][20][21]\n\nAutodesk announced the largest lay off in its history on November 27, 2017, with the lay off of 1,150 jobs. This was in addition to the almost 1,000 job cuts announced in January 2016. The number of Autodesk employees decreased from approximately 9,200 to 7,200 in less than 2 years.[22]\n\nAutodesk updated to its current logo in September 2021.[23]\n\nIn 2022, Autodesk moved their headquarters to San Francisco from San Rafael, California — which served as their headquarters since 1994.[2][24]\n\nIn 1992 Autodesk acquired Micro Engineering Solutions (MES) Inc., a developer and marketer of manufacturing CAD / CAM software.[25][26][27]\n\nIn 1993 Autodesk acquired Ithaca Software, a 3D computer graphics company founded by Autodesk's former CEO Carl Bass and Garry Wiegand.[28][29]\n\nIn December 1996, Autodesk announced its plan to acquire Softdesk, a developer of architecture, engineering and construction software.[30]\n\nIn 1998 Autodesk acquired assets of Genius CAD-Software to strengthen the functionality of its core mechanical products.[31]\n\nIn August 1998, Autodesk agreed to acquire Discreet Logic Inc. for about $520 million in stock.[32]\n\nIn 1999, Autodesk acquired VISION* Solutions, a vendor of enterprise automated mapping/facilities management/geographic information systems (AM/FM/GIS) from MCI Systemhouse Corp.[33]\n\nIn January 2001, Autodesk acquired Gentry Systems, a supplier of specialized software tools and services in the electric utility industry.

The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally, the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, while existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped.[citation needed]\n\nVolo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.\n\nAutodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cel-based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.\n\nCyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in \"realtime\". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles.\n\nCAD Camera\n\nAutoSketch\n\nAutoShade\n\nAutoCAD Survey (Autodesk Survey)\n\nCivil Design\n\nAutoCAD Civil 3D Land Desktop Companion (AutoCAD Land Desktop)\n\nAutodesk Mechanical Desktop\n\nAutoCAD Freestyle, released on April 26, 2010, and discontinued January 31, 2011.\n\nAutodesk Fluid FX\n\nAutodesk Time FX\n\nInventor Fusion was discontinued August 23, 2014 due to redundancies with Fusion 360.[113]\n\nSketchbook designer has been discontinued as of November 1, 2012[114]\n\nSoftimage was discontinued after the release of Softimage 2015 on April 14, 2014.\n\nFace Robot\n\nLagoa Multiphysics\n\nAutodesk Stitcher Unlimited\n\nAutodesk ImageModeler\n\nAutodesk Movimento (formerly Realviz Movimento)\n\nAutodesk Combustion\n\nDiscreet Effect (formerly Illuminaire Composition)\n\nDiscreet Paint (formerly Illuminaire Paint)\n\nCleaner Streaming Studio\n\nCleaner Live\n\nCleaner\n\nCinestream (formerly EditDV)\n\n3D software for game modification\n\ngmax\n\nMaya PLE[115]\n\nXSI Mod Tool\n\nAutodesk Topobase Client - its feature was merged into AutoCAD Map 3D.[116]\n\nAutodesk Topobase Web - its feature was merged into Autodesk Infrastructure Map Server.[116]\n\nAutodesk Opticore Realizer (formerly Opus Realizer)\n\nAutodesk Opticore Studio (formerly Opus Studio)\n\nAutodesk AutoCAD ecscad - the product was replaced by AutoCAD Electrical.[117]\n\nAutodesk Smoke Advanced\n\nAutodesk Flint\n\nAutodesk Inferno\n\nAutoCAD Structural Detailing[119]\n\ntsElements for SolidWorks[120]\n\nFBX Converter\n\nFBX QuickTime Viewer\n\nAutodesk Scaleform Unity Integration[121]\n\nRevit variants\n\nAutodesk Revit Architecture - its features were merged into Revit itself.[122]\n\nAutodesk Revit Structure - its features were merged into Revit itself.[122]\n\nAutodesk Revit MEP - its features were merged into Revit itself.[122]\n\nAutodesk Ecotect Analysis[123]\n\nBuzzsaw[124] - the service was replaced by BIM 360 Docs.[124]\n\nMockup 360[125] - the tool was replaced by A360 Viewer.[125]\n\nAutodesk Remote[126]\n\nInventor Engineer-to-Order[127]\n\nAutodesk Advance Concrete[128]\n\nAutodesk Quantity Takeoff - some features of the product were merged into Autodesk Navisworks Simulate.[129]\n\nAutodesk 123D\n\nAutodesk 3D Print Utility - its features were merged into the Meshmixer.[130]\n\nAutodesk 123D CNC Utility\n\nAutodesk 123D Sculpt+ (formerly 123D Sculpt and Sculpt 123D)\n\nAutodesk 123D Make - its slice feature was introduced in \"Slicer for Fusion 360\" add-in.[131][132]\n\nAutodesk 123D Catch (formerly Project Photofly)\n\nAutodesk 123D Circuits (a.k.a.

Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[213][214] Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company's gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk's C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company's global GDP contribution.[215] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.\n\nIn 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e² Design,[216] which focused on green building design around the world, describing the leaders and technologies that drive sustainable design.\n\nIn November 2021, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.[217]\n\nDigital prototyping"
