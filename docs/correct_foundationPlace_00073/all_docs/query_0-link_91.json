        "text": "Happy Monday!\n\nAn historic climate summit in Nairobi last week underscored the need for drastic changes in climate finance and clean energy development. Leaders sought to position the continent‚Äôs renewables potential and mineral resources as climate investment opportunities and get nations on the same page ahead of COP28.\n\nMeanwhile, an auction in the UK highlights ongoing offshore wind challenges. The Biden administration is canceling drilling leases, and the Texas grid is once again facing emergency conditions.\n\nIn deals this week, decarbonized steel secures $1.6B. Battery recycling attracts another big check with a $542M Series D, and food recycling attracts $70M.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nNot a subscriber yet?\n\nüì© Submit deals, announcements, events & opportunities, or general curiosities for the newsletter at [email protected].\n\nüíº Find or share roles on our job board here.\n\nAfrican leaders assemble on climate\n\nDiplomats, investors, and heads of state gathered in Nairobi, Kenya for the first-ever African Climate Summit last week.\n\nSetting the scene: The goal of the event, which drew ~25,000 attendees, was to bring together national leaders to establish a shared position on climate priorities ahead of COP28 in November.\n\nThe summit also sought to highlight Africa as a destination for climate investments, rather than viewing the continent as predominantly a victim of droughts, famines, and floods. Africa is home to vast thermal, wind, solar, and hydro energy resources (some 60% of the world‚Äôs renewable energy potential) as well as mineral deposits essential for the global energy transition.\n\nIn his remarks, Kenyan President William Ruto framed the moment as an opportunity to align on a vision of sustainable development across the continent, and particularly in Kenya, which has already drawn some investments in carbon removal and green ammonia. ‚ÄúWe must go green fast, before industrializing, and not vice versa,‚Äù he said.\n\nDisproportionate impacts: Home to 1.3 billion people and set to double in population by 2050, Africa is already experiencing some of the most extreme effects of climate change, despite accounting for ~4% of global annual GHG emissions and contributing a minuscule fraction of historic emissions.\n\nLenders still see projects in African nations as too risky, and only 2% of global renewable energy investment has been in Africa, even as nearly a billion people have little or no access to electricity.\n\nSo far, the continent has received just 12% of the funding it needs to adapt to climate change and rich nations have failed to follow through on their 2009 pledge to provide $100B annually to help poorer countries reach climate goals.\n\nThe gathering underscored the need for changes to climate finance to avoid leaving the world‚Äôs most vulnerable nations unprepared and increasingly on the brink of debt crises as they face a future they did not create.\n\nWhile African leaders remain somewhat divided on transitioning away from fossil fuels, the inaugural summit ended with a declaration signed by participating nations that included calls for:\n\nA global carbon tax on fossil fuels, aviation, and maritime transport in order to help poorer nations invest in renewable energy.\n\nMore domestic refining and processing of the raw materials for batteries and other critical mineral deposits located in Africa.\n\nWorld Bank reforms that would funnel hundreds of billions of dollars toward climate investments in the Global South.\n\nPrecarious pledges\n\nInvestors made announcements during the event totalling nearly $26B in capital to fund initiatives like solar microgrids, reforestation, and carbon credit purchases, but it‚Äôs still unclear how much of that intended money will actually be committed to projects on the continent.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), host of this year‚Äôs UN climate summit, pledged $4.5B toward clean energy investments and $450M for carbon credits.\n\nMuch of the interest is in carbon credits, though African projects often draw less than 10% of the price per ton of carbon compared with other regions, and the voluntary carbon market has faced a slew of verification challenges.\n\nOther foreign government and private sector announcements included:\n\nThe EU and Kenya teamed up on a green hydrogen strategy that was unveiled during the summit.\n\nGermany announced and Portugal reaffirmed debt-for-nature swaps with Kenya and Cabo Verde, respectively.\n\nThe US announced $161M in new investments, including $75M for African climate solutions from the US International Development Finance Corporation.\n\nClimate finance figures\n\nAfrica, along with much of the Global South, needs a lot more money in order to develop clean energy infrastructure and adapt to a changing climate. It would take some $277B each year to meet Africa‚Äôs 2030 climate goals, according to The Climate Policy Initiative, but annual climate finance to the continent today totals just $30B.\n\nThe deficit in climate funding is made worse by rising interest rates, which make it even more expensive for poorer countries to borrow money. The African Union became a permanent member of the G20 at the summit of the world‚Äôs 20 largest economies in New Delhi over the weekend, but so far G20 leaders have not made reforms to the World Bank recommended by their own independent expert group this year that could free up hundreds of billions of dollars for low- and middle-income countries to make urgently needed climate investments. Eyes are now on the World Bank/IMF meetings in Morocco in October for further progress.\n\nDeals of the Week (9/4-9/10)\n\nVenture Fundings\n\nüè≠ H2 Green Steel, a Stockholm, Sweden-based

The UK energy auction secured zero offshore wind farms, almost ensuring a miss of the nation‚Äôs clean energy targets. In the US, Orsted announced a need for further government funding to invest in their offshore wind projects due to creeping inflation increasing project costs.\n\nPop-up\n\nWhy annual clean-energy matching =/= hourly matching.\n\nYou‚Äôve heard of glaciers melting, but what about glaciers mating?\n\nTennis matches aren‚Äôt as quiet as they used to be. Climate activists interrupted play between Coco Gauff and Karolina Muchova at the US Open Semifinal.\n\nFor the first time, keeping the lights on is using less energy than refrigeration in the US.\n\nBeing pregnant during sweltering summers is obviously uncomfortable, but hot weather also increases severe health complications, according to a new study.\n\nGrid storage gets the NIMBY treatment.\n\nA new material shows promise harvesting CO2 and water from the air using very little energy.\n\nOpportunities & Events:\n\nüóìÔ∏èHarvard Innovation Labs: Register to join Harvard Innovation Labs‚Äô virtual classes starting Sept 8th regarding creating successful climate ventures.\n\nüóìÔ∏èOut in Climate: Register to join Out in Climate‚Äôs Boston meetup on Sept 12th to meet other LGBTQ+ individuals in the sustainability space.\n\nüóìÔ∏èThe Edge: Infrastructure: Register to virtually join Keep Cool‚Äôs event on Sept 12th to discuss the future of infrastructure, ranging from deployment to monitoring.\n\nüóìÔ∏èMaRS Discovery District: Virtually join MaRS Discovery District on Sept 20th as they announce their six carbon dioxide removal companies in their newest startup accelerator.\n\nüí° Designer Fund Partnership: Apply by Sept 22nd to the Design Fund Partnership to receive investments and support from experts for your early stage startup.\n\nJobs\n\nFounder in Residence - Zero Emission Shipping, Founder - Industrial-scale Heat Pumps (Engineer), Founder - Decarbonizing Industrial Heat (Engineer), Associate - New Venture Creation in Climate @Deep Science Ventures\n\nProduct Manager - API Platform @Octopus Energy\n\nInvestment Associate @Scale Microgrids\n\nSustainability Manager @Statkraft\n\nDirector of Innovation, Senior Investment Manager @Elemental Excelerator\n\nCommunity Solar Associate @Sunwealth Power\n\nSenior Product Engineer - R&D @Crusoe\n\nSenior Associate, Investment Analytics @Cypress Creek Renewables\n\nEnergy Business Analyst @Honda\n\nClimate and Sustainability Leader @Arup\n\nInvestment Director (Venture Capital) @Robert Bosch Venture Capital"
