        "text": "How does it work?\n\nUsing the CNC Mill requires that you either create a design in vector software such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. Or you can create a design in 3D modeling software such as Fusion360, or Solidworks. You may use the CNC Mill computer to create your design but this will reduce the amount of time you have to actually use the mill. Your designs will then be be imported into the Bantam Tools software where you will specify the dimensions of your material and the bit that will be used to engrave it.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe equipment, software, and tools needed to do a CNC milling project are absolutely free. However, you will need to purchase your own project materials.\n\nWhat do I need to bring?\n\nIn order to use the CNC Mill, you will need to provide your own material. Not all materials can, or should be used on the CNC Mill. So all materials must be approved by lab staff.\n\nThe following materials may be used for cutting:\n\nFR-1 Printed Circuit Board Blanks\n\nMachining Wax\n\nLinoleum\n\nMachinable Foam\n\nABS\n\nAcrylic\n\nThe following materials may be used for engraving only:\n\nBrass\n\nAluminum\n\nSilver\n\nIf you have questions regarding any material that is not on this list, give us a call at (213) 228-7150 before purchasing. We wouldn't want you to purchase material that can't be used."
