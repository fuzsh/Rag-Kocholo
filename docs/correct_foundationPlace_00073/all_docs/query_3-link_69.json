        "text": "Alex,\n\nThere is a world of free Elevation Data available. I don't know of any source of vectorized topo maps in DWG format. More details please on what you'd like to put together.\n\nFor a quick, richly detailed topo map of wilderness areas, I use >>>CalTopo<<<. Instuctions on how to use >>>Here<<<.\n\nDave\n\nDave Stoll\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\n64GB DDR4 2400MHz ECC SoDIMM / 1TB SSD\n\nNVIDIA Quadro P5000 16GB\n\nWindows 10 Pro 64 / Civil 3D 2024\n\nTopographic data can be found online. You can download either raster or vector format (gdb or shapefile) at no charge from The National Map (TNM). Topographic data can be downloaded on a quadrangle-by-quadrangle basis. To go to the TNM website, click >>HERE<<\n\nIt's not likely you'll be able to find topo maps in dwg format. As an alternative, download shapefile then use MAPIMPORT command to bring in the shapefile geometry. The MAPIMPORT command will convert the shapefile entities into AutoCAD entities, e.g. points, lines or polygons, during the execution of the command.\n\nThe data you download will be a zip file. When extracted, the contour data will appear in the unzipped folder like this:\n\nMap with Elev_Contour, NHDFlowline and Trans_RoadSegment.\n\nChicagolooper\n\nThis is very helpful, thanks!\n\nIt works so far except I can't import the data into autocad... The MAPIMPORT command didn't seem to show up. So I tried just importing the .shx and .shp and neither showed up in model space...\n\nSounds like a coordinate system issue.\n\nHave you assigned a proper coordinate system to modelspace (you must be exact, no guessing on the correct State Plane and Zone)?\n\nAre you using the native coordinate system of the shapefile? Do not impose your coordinate system on the shapefile. Inherit, accept and tolerate the original coordinate system established the shapefile's author.\n\nChicagolooper\n\nOK. Our troubleshooting is inching forward at a snail's pace.\n\nAre you running Macbook? Can you possibly try opening in Windows? Or have someone in your office who is running Windows? If it opens in Windows, then it's not the zip file and must be the workflow you're using to import the shapefile. Or your operating system, maybe?\n\nChicagolooper\n\nIt works so far except I can't import the data into autocad... The MAPIMPORT command didn't seem to show up\n\nOP is using AUTOCAD. look at the top of the png. MAPIMPORT is not available in vanilla autocad.\n\nProvide the name of topoquad you want and maybe some kind soul can send you the dwg which will be lines without object data so if you need it in 3D say so.\n\ntis the season to be generous\n\ndave\n\nI see... so I need a different version of autocad? I'm a grad student so mine is the student version. I went to the school to try this on the PCs but still didn't see the MAPIMPORT command.\n\nI'm trying to learn how to make 3D contour models, and I was planning on putting my autocad drawing into rhino to do so. Just as a place to start I was looking at the El Capitan, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and Tamarack Flat quadrants so I could build a 3D model of Yosemite Valley. So that's the current project, but I'm also trying to learn how this process works...\n\nAlex\n\nHi, so I'm just getting back to this after the holidays... I have MAP3D downloaded and I used the MAPIMPORT command to import the .shp file for Elev_Contour. It seemed to import well - the contours are visible - but there isn't any elevation data attached to the contour lines - either in the elevation property tab or the z axis. Is there a way to import that data as well? The goal from here is to make an accurate 3D version of the contours...\n\nYes. Excellent info provided by@Pointdump.\n\nJust out of curiosity, when you say you want to create ‘an accurate 3D version’ of the contours, what is your expectation? A surface created by M3D is different from a surface created in C3D. The surface you are expecting to achieve may be either one of those or an entirely different one altogether.\n\nChicagolooper\n\nThis has all been a huge help so far... So I correctly assigned the elevation data by following the first link, and now my challenge is that somehow the x and y axes aren't to scale. The 2D top view of the drawing is only a few square inches. So if you looked at in 3D it is thousands of feet tall (which is accurate) and only a few inches wide (which is not accurate). Does that have something to do with how it was imported? Any suggestions on how to keep the x and y axis in the correct scale while adding the elevation data?\n\nThanks!\n\nAlex"
