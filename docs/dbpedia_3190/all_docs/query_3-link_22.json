        "text": "The weekend of 24-26 May played host to a special stage in the calendar: the third edition of the Ferrari Tour - Women’s Edition, an exclusive event solely for female Ferrari enthusiasts.\n\nThe destination of the journey was Forte dei Marmi, but there were many other highlights. The fortunate Ferrari fans embarked on a tour that saw them admire magical views over the sea, glamourous resorts and country roads as they discovered the area’s traditions and famous culinary arts.\n\nIt was three days of relaxation and enjoyment at the wheel of their Ferraris.\n\nThe tour presentation and welcome took place at Maranello in front of the factory, at the Cavallino Restaurant, housed in the original walls of the first company canteen established by Enzo Ferrari – a symbolic location for the Maranello-based company, steeped in the spirit and values of the Cavallino Rampante.\n\nThe stages of this one-of-a-kind trip were not short of stops in Forte dei Marmi’s most exclusive locations, framed by one of Italy’s most famous coastlines and set of beaches. But it also featured panoramic routes along country roads and unmissable stops. These included a visit to Carrara’s marble quarries, situated in the Apuan Alps, which for centuries have been synonymous with the extraction of the famous white marble – an inspiration for artists all over the world.\n\nThe third and final day of the itinerary saw the Ferrari enthusiasts enjoy the peace and tranquilly of Paradis Agricole, an oasis surrounded by nature.\n\nIn this typical Tuscan farmhouse, both charming and environmentally sustainable, they had the opportunity to admire the extensive olive oil crop used to produce the excellent local oil. They then took part in a tasting of the oil itself, as well as sampling the farm’s most popular products."
