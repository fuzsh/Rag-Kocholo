        "text": "No photo I'm afraid but story fro F1 site 1995;\n\nHow Gerhard Berger's Ferrari was stolen.\n\nYou might have heard through mass media that Gerhard Berger's private Ferrari (not the Formula 1 car) was stolen in Imola. Jean Alesi's Ferrari was stolen, too. On Monday after the San Marino GP Berger was in Munich (Germany) as a guest in the sport-magazine called \"Blickpunkt Sport\" on the Bavarian TV. There he told in a funny way how his Ferrari was stolen:\n\nGerhard left the hotel in the evening to drive to dinner. As he was about 30 metres away from his car, he saw someone driving his Testarossa out of the parking space and so he thought: \"Maybe someone needs the parking place and so the hotel stuff moves away my car.\" But a few seconds later another thought flashed through his mind: \"How can they drive with my car when I've got the key in my hand now?!?\" (What a surprise!) Gerhard didn't know what to do and so he stood in front of his car but the person at the steering wheel stepped on the gas and so Gerhard had to jump aside not to get driven over. It was like a scene in a film!\n\nTHis thread got me reading about him and found the following about his friendship with Senna worth sharing:\n\nDuring the years that Berger was at McLaren (1990&#8211;1992), he became most famous for his humorous side. Popular accounts tell of many ingenious practical jokes thought up by the Austrian to break through his serious, focused and unyielding teammate Ayrton Senna. Senna accepted the challenge and as both were spurred on by team manager Ron Dennis, the practical joking escalated.\n\nAccounts tell of an incident at Monza where in a joint helicopter ride Senna had been showing off his new tailor-made briefcase. Having been made of carbon fibre composite, Senna argued that it was virtually indestructible. Berger opened the door of the helicopter and threw the briefcase out, to Senna's disbelief. Berger asserted innocently that he only sought to test the hypothesis.[6]\n\nBerger later recounted further events before the 1990 Australian Grand Prix. \"After dinner, we started to throw people in the swimming pool, all dressed. As I was good at defending myself, I escaped from the bath, but many people got wet. Senna ran away to avoid us from getting him, however, later, I went to his room and he awkwardly threw a glass of water at me. For a Tyrolean, that was nothing, but it did mean that the game was now on. With a hose, we improvised an extension to the fire extinguisher and we put it under his room door at three in the morning. We invited some people to watch and when we pushed the lever, Senna flew out of the window like a rocket. It looked like a bomb had exploded inside the room. The confusion woke many people up, who started to scream at Senna for making so much noise. He was terribly embarrassed.\"[7]\n\nIn an Australian hotel room Berger filled Senna's bed with animals. Senna understandably infuriated, confronted Berger, who replied, \"Did you find the snake?\" This incident prompted retaliation by Senna, who then proceeded to put a strong smelling French cheese in the air conditioning unit of Berger's room.[6]\n\nOn another occasion, Senna and Brazilian compatriot Maurício Gugelmin decided to fill Berger's shoes with shaving foam on a fast train ride to a dinner in Japan. The Austrian was forced to attend the dinner wearing a tuxedo with running shoes. A further incident followed in which Berger replaced Senna's passport photo with what Ron Dennis described as \"an equivalent-sized piece of male genitalia\". Senna's fame meant he rarely had his passport checked, but on a later trip to Argentina Berger's prank resulted in officials holding the Brazilian for 24 hours. As a response to this gag, Senna superglued all of Berger's credit cards together.[6]\n\nAnother incident occurred years later at Ferrari, when Berger and fellow F1 driver Jean Alesi were taking a ride with team director Jean Todt's new special made Lancia roadcar at the very first testing day of the 1995 Formula One season. Arriving at the test track, Jean Alesi lost control of the car when Berger unexpectedly pulled the handbrake. The car flipped, skidding upside down to a halt in front of the entrance. Alesi was sent to the hospital. Later when Todt enquired about his roadcar, Berger conceded the two had put some \"slight curb marks on the roof\".[7]\n\n\"A Ferrari stolen from former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger 28 years ago has been recovered by the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThe red Ferrari F512M was one of two of the Italian sports cars taken while their drivers were at the San Marino Grand Prix held at Imola in Italy in April 1995.\n\nThe Met said officers received a report from the car maker in January this year after the firm had carried out checks on a car being bought by a US buyer through a UK broker last year.\n\nThe Organised Vehicle Crime Unit discovered the car had been shipped to Japan shortly after being stolen until it was brought to the UK in late 2023, and they swooped to take possession and prevent it from being exported.\n\nThe second car remains missing and no arrests have yet been made, the force added.\n\nPc Mike Pilbeam, who led the investigation, said: \"The stolen Ferrari - close to the value of £350,000 - was missing for more than 28 years before we managed to track it down in just four days.\n\n\"Our inquiries were painstaking and included contacting authorities from around the world.\n\n\"We worked quickly with partners including the National Crime Agency, as well as Ferrari and international car dealerships, and this collaboration was instrumental in understanding the vehicle's background and stopping it from leaving the country.\"\n\nThis might be the \"feel good\" story of the day but.... Where the hell was this car for 28 years when they were able to track it down in 4 days?\n\nOrganised Vehicle Crime Unit recover Ferrari stolen in Italy 28 years ago\n\nhttps://news.met.police.uk/news/organised-vehicle-crime-unit-recover-ferrari-stolen-in-italy-28-years-ago-480340\n\nA Ferrari stolen from Gerhard Berger in Italy in 1995 has been recovered after a four-day investigation led by the Met.\n\nIn April 1995, the San Marino Grand Prix was held in Imola, Italy. While in the city for the race, two Formula One drivers had their Ferraris stolen. One of these was a red Ferrari F512M and despite being reported missing, the cars were never found until the Met started an investigation.\n\nIn January this year, the Met received a report from Ferrari, who had carried out checks on a car being bought by a US buyer via a UK broker in 2023, which revealed it was a stolen vehicle.\n\nOfficers from the Organised Vehicle Crime Unit carried out extensive enquiries across the world which revealed the car’s background, including that it had been shipped to Japan shortly after being stolen until it was brought to the UK in late 2023.\n\nEstablishing the history of the vehicle in just four days, Gerhard Berger’s Ferrari was tracked down and was moved to the Met’s possession to prevent the car from being exported from the UK.\n\nPC Mike Pilbeam, who led the investigation, said: “The stolen Ferrari – close to the value of £350,000 – was missing for more than 28 years before we managed to track it down in just four days.\n\n“Our enquiries were painstaking and included contacting authorities from around the world. We worked quickly with partners including the National Crime Agency, as well as Ferrari and international car dealerships, and this collaboration was instrumental in understanding the vehicle’s background and stopping it from leaving the country.”\n\nEnquiries remain ongoing and no arrests have been made. The second car remains missing.\n\nThe Met’s Organised Vehicle Crime Unit is a small team of experienced vehicle examiners, police officers and staff with a wealth of knowledge. In 2023, the unit recovered 418 vehicles, with a combined value of £31m. Of these, 326 have been linked to organised criminal gangs, making up £21m of the total value of vehicles seized.\n\nThread already exists here:\n\nhttps://www.ferrarichat.com/forum/threads/gerhard-berger-photo-with-his-testarossa.446747/#post-149547202\n\nThe S/N is 99806.\n\nMarcel Massini\n\nhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a60073385/ferrari-testarossa-stolen-from-gerhard-berger-recovered-after-28-years/\n\n\"The theft itself came at the culmination of a thrilling weekend for both Ferrari and its drivers at the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix. Berger qualified his Ferrari 412 T2 - the last V12-powered Formula 1 car - just 0.008 seconds behind pole-sitter Michael Schumacher’s Benetton. The race was in wet conditions and Berger took the lead after Schumacher crashed out, but then dropped down the order after stalling in the pits. The Austrian ultimately finished in third place, behind teammate Jean Alesi and winner Damon Hill, driving the Adrian Newey-designed Williams FW17.\n\nBut action off the track was even more exciting. Berger’s F512 M was stolen from the hotel he was staying at in Imola, a contemporary report from grandprix.com says that he attempted to stop the thieves by standing in front of the car, and then gave chase in a friend’s Volkswagen Golf. At around the same time, Jean Alesi’s grey Ferrari 355 was stolen from the parking garage at his hotel. That car remains missing.\"\n\nFWIW - I met Gerhard Berger in 1986 at the Detroit Grand Prix 5 and got his autograph. Then again on my honeymoon at Reethi Rah in the Maldives in 2005. He was shocked that I recognized him and confessed to not remembering me at the Detroit Grand Prix... I asked him, \"Of all the places you have been to in the world, where is the nicest?\" He said \"Here!\" He was really nice! I always like him. I never heard of this story before.\n\nSo what will happen to the car next? - Who is the actual owner of the car now?\n\nDoes Gerhard Berger have a claim to the car? - Or was it a Ferrari \"company car\" that they simply lent him at the time, and do Ferrari claim the car back?\n\nThen there's the person who was attempting to sell the car - Do they have a legal claim to it (assuming they bought it in \"good faith\") ?\n\nAnd finally: Is this now the most valuable F512M in the World, due to it's \"colourful\" past?\n\nNormally the insurance company paid for the loss. If said insurance company still exists today they now own the car.\n\nAnd no, I don't think this is now the most valuable F512 M in the world. Would you really want a stolen car, one that has a gap of 28 years in its history?\n\nMarcel Massini"
