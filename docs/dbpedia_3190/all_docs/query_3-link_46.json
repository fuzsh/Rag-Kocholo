        "text": "Launched last month in celebration of Ferrari’s first fashion collection, Sybarite has created a sensory retail environment with a strong narrative that reflects the craftsmanship, human innovation and inspiration that is inherent in the brand’s car making history, whilst delivering energy and vibrancy to the space as Ferrari evolves in this new direction.\n\nSituated in an open-plan 1980s building in Ferrari’s Italian HQ, Sybarite’s design acknowledges Ferrari’s Italian legacy, whilst bringing Sybarite’s signature contemporary sleek style with sweeping curves that are the perfect synergy for Ferrari’s automotive creations and echo the brand’s Fiorano Circuit track.\n\nSpecialists in storytelling, Sybarite looked to the location, company history and materials of the supercars themselves as inspiration for the store’s design. The result is a combination of classic influences – such as the colonnaded terracotta façade and mahogany - with contemporary lines and textures – ripples of ribboned glass paired with backlit smoked acrylic, brushed metal, poured concrete and white clay bricks - to create a flow between both the store’s interior and exterior. In a distinctive twist, pops of Ferrari’s ‘race red’ (Rosso Corsa) and bright yellow contrast with the curved white walls, giving definition and depth to the space. The unmistakable Ferrari Cavallino (prancing horse) logo made from suspended black metal sheets is given prominence at the store’s entrance. All combines to provide a definitive sense of place and origin.\n\nFor Simon Mitchell, Sybarite’s co-founder, working on this project has satisfied a lifelong passion; a Formula 1 fan from a young age, working with Ferrari has been a dream for him. He says: “I first became aware of Ferrari in 1976 when I was five years old, I watched the F1 on the BBC – I remember seeing the cars line up for the start of the race and I caught a glimpse of Niki Lauda driving a Ferrari 312T. What struck me was that it was a sport where design was the winner. I have followed Ferrari forever as a hobby. Our design for Maranello was inspired by the sense of kinetic energy derived from the sheer velocity of a high-performance car gliding around the Fiorano circuit. Ferrari is first and foremost design-led – an aspirational embodiment of speed, strategy and beauty. Their ability to continually reinvent is why I wanted to work on this project. We wanted to create a uniquely dynamic and resonating experiential destination with a strong sense of longevity reflecting Ferrari’s own values and story.”\n\nAs Ferrari Chief Brand Diversification Officer, Nicola Boari commented to Dezeen: \"This is part of a broad strategy for Ferrari – we have created a new shopping experience and a new design concept which embodies the values of innovation, style and performance of the Ferrari. The space has been completely renovated and redesigned according to the company's plan to develop and expand into the lifestyle segment, becoming the first venue for the debut of the new clothing and accessories collections under the creative direction of Rocco Iannone.\"\n\nFollowing this first in Maranello, a new outpost in Milan – for which Sybarite is also creative design partner - will be opening in August.\n\nsybarite.com\n\nImages courtesy of Ferrari Maranello Store by Paola Pansini."
