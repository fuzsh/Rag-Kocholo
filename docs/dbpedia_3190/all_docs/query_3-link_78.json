        "text": "Ferrari has re-opened the doors of its Cavallino restaurant with a Michelin-starred chef taking over what was once the works canteen.\n\nCavallino, positioned opposite the famous factory gates in Maranello, was formerly a farmhouse, but Enzo Ferrari turned it into an eatery, changing area and training centre for his workers in 1942. By 1950 it had become Cavallino, where Enzo entertained royalty and racing drivers with a cold bottle of local Lambrusco.\n\nHaving closed in late 2019 Cavallino now has a new lease of life under three-star Michelin chef Massimo Bottura. Bottura became friends with Il Commendatore’s granddaughter Antonella who was a regular customer at his renowned Osteria Francescana and the revived Cavallino has been developed with her son Enzo Mattioli Ferrari along with French architect India Mahdavi.\n\nBottura describes the Modena area where he grew up as the “home of fast cars and slow food,” telling the Wall Street Journal: “When you are a kid, going to the circuit in downtown Modena and checking out all the motorcycle drivers, Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Maseratis… you grow up with a sense of speed in your body, in your DNA.”"
