        "text": "October 2022. As we wanted to test Trenitalia‘s Frecciarossa 1000 service from Paris to Milan, we planned a rail trip around it. From Antwerp to Paris with Thalys, the ‘Red Arrow’ to Milan and once in Italy continuing to Trieste and Bologna. The return trip took us to Basel in Switzerland to enjoy SBB‘s panoramic coach and Germany‘s Rhine route to Cologne. From there we got back to Belgium.\n\nAfter visiting Palazzo Poggi in Bologna, we wanted to visit the Museo Memoriale della Libertà or Freedom Memorial Museum, which promised to be interactive. But we were caught out by opening hours. That museum was only open before 1PM.\n\nSo we decided to take a train to nearby Modena for the Museo Enzo Ferrari Modena or Enzo Ferrari Museum. Located at Ferrari’s first workshop, it focuses on Enzo Ferrari‘s life and road cars. For racing cars you need to go to the Ferrari Museum in Maranello.\n\n75 years\n\nAs 2022 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the brand, a visit was extra appropriate.\n\nFirst we had lunch and then we bought our tickets. A whopping 22 euros per person. Combining it with Maranello would have been 30 or 35, but that wasn’t an option time and mobility wise.\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari House Museum has two two areas. In the old workshop, there was an exhibition on the 10th anniversary of the museum. Texts are of secondary importance, one wants to see cars. Still, a section explained Enzo’s life and the evolution of the brand.\n\nIn the new building, one – yes, one – hall showcases maybe thirty cars from the olden days and more recently. There’s also a section with V8 and V12 engines.\n\nIf you wait long enough you get to see a mini documentary on Enzo’s achievements. I expect these films to be overly positive, but this was next level propaganda. Claiming the world thanks Enzo Ferrari is quite ludicrous.\n\nA third section is the driving simulator, which costs an extra 20 euros.\n\nSo?\n\nWell, I’m afraid this was a big let-down. 22 euros is too much for what you get. Accepting you pay the name and the fandom, 15 euros should be the very maximum. We were finished in maybe 45 minutes and I’m being very generous here.\n\nI suppose combining Modena with Maranello and the circuit at Fiorano is better value for money. We’ve seen so many better car manufacturer’s museums.\n\nCar (related) museums\n\nREVIEW | Porsche Museum in Stuttgart.\n\nREVIEW | Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart.\n\nDAF Museum in Eindhoven.\n\nBMW Museum & BMW Welt in Munich.\n\nPHOTOS | Swiss Museum of Transport Verkehrshaus in Lucerne.\n\nDeutsches Museum’s Verkehrszentrum or Transport Centre in Munich.\n\nSALZBURG | Formula 1 cars and the Flying Bulls at Red Bull’s Hangar-7.\n\nParis – Italy – Basel 2022"
