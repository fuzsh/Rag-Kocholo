        "text": "I am going to Maranello in October so I am interested in this question as well. The research I have done suggests that it is very difficult to tour the factory. Anyone out there know more about this? I would like to schedule a tour as a surprise for my husband, who does not read this board, by the way.\n\nGreg -\n\nI was there in October '07. It was a worthwhile experience. The displays are very well done and you can get right up to the cars. The gift shop is (as you might imagine) beautiful and very pricey! We were there for about an hour and a half and felt like we saw everything. If you are in the area I would recommend it. Also, instead of staying in Modena or Maranello - you might try the little nearby (9km away) village of Castelvetro - we loved it. Quiet out of the way town. The hotel - Locanda del Feudo was wonderful - the rooms are all suites and the dining room was out of this world. Have fun.\n\nHello Greg,\n\nApparently one needs a significant connection to gain access to the factory. As an example, from what I've been told, after purchasing a new Ferrari your friendly Ferrari dealer will make arrangements for a visit.\n\nUnfortunately vintage Alfa Romeo owners like myself and my family dont qualify. So we were more than happy to visit the Ferrari Museum. The museum is excellent with F1 engines, Enzos office circa 1960 plus lots of historical cars. We were lucky to hop on a multi lingual tour. We fulfilled my 12 year old sons dream. One word of caution, I was taking pictures of the entry to the Ferrari factory when a security guard accosted me and told me no pictures (No signs were present). Reminded me of the old Check Point Charlie in Berlin.\n\nSaluti,\n\nDavid\n\nMy husband and I visited the factory a few years ago. I would not recommend staying in Maranello. We did and felt it took up a precious night. We thought that staying in Milan or Bologna with this as a side trip would be ideal. No chance of factory tour but the museum has a lot of things to see. Apparently there is a much-lauded restaurant nearby that Micheal Shumacher really liked. Those so inclinded will be impressed by this:)\n\nI tried for months to figure out a way to get a factory tour for my husband and son. My son works for a car care company and the president owns a Ferrari. He called but couldn't get us in. My husband called and begged but couldn't get us in. We heard even if you own a Ferrari it is hard to get a tour.\n\nWe went to Monza for the Italian Grand Prix last September. After the race on Sunday, we drove to Maranello and stayed at Planet Hotel right across the parking lot from the Ferrari factory. Great Hotel. We were hoping to hear the bells ringing in Maranello but Italy lost the race. We could hear and see Ferrari's zooming around the test track from our balcony. The next morning we awoke to a zillion employees dressed in red and yellow walking to the factory to go to work. We went to the museum, which my husband and son loved. Then we went to the test track and stood next to the fence to watch the cars fly by. We ate at the famed Il Cavallino for lunch. Great Pizza!!"
