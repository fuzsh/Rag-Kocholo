        "text": "Seen from above, Modena’s futuristic Enzo Ferrari Home Museum is said to bring to mind the hood of a sleek, buttercup-yellow roadster.\n\nAt ground level, the sparkling-glass gallery is a state-of-the-art showroom – one that contrasts with its Old World, red-brick neighbor, the building in which Ferrari was born in 1898.\n\nAdmittedly, despite having maneuvered a Bavarian driving machine on Germany’s famed Autobahn for a decade, I am not by nature, an automobile aficionado. When Shawn and I embarked on our Southeast Asian, North American and Southeastern European adventures in 2011, we sold our cars, and have embraced slower-paced bus and train travel ever since. Nevertheless, we appreciate good design – and since Modena is as well known for its automotive makers, as its mouth-watering cuisine, and classic architecture, we found that the Ferrari Home Museum foray gave us a more complete picture of life in the Northern Italian city.\n\nThe museum’s modern gallery showcases classic Ferrari racecars which highlight Ferrari’s penchant for masterful design and technology. The cars are rotated every six months. A multimedia presentation projected on the showroom’s walls tells the Ferrari story, while upholding Modena’s automotive legacy. Supercar manufacturers Maserati, Pagani and De Tomaso also have roots in Modena.\n\nAdjacent to the gallery is Ferrari’s childhood home, which houses life artifacts ranging from photographs and trophies to film snippets, even Ferrari’s birth certificate and his trademark dark sunglasses. Another display explains the inspiration behind Ferrari’s prancing horse logo, as well as the symbol’s various incarnations.\n\nWhere in the World?\n\nPlanning Pointers:\n\nThe Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari is located at Via Paolo Ferrari 85, in Modena.\n\nWhile in Modena, we spent 3 nights at the elegant, historic, and centrally-located Hotel Canalgrande. One of our favorite memories from Modena, in fact, was sitting out on our hotel room balcony just before sunset, looking out over Modena’s rooftops, while enjoying goodies that we’d procured at the Albinelli Market earlier in the day.\n\nPeruse the Emilia-Romagna Tourist Board and Modena websites for more details about Modena’s and the region’s rich offerings. The tourist board just recently released a free e-book that chronicles Emilia-Romagna’s Art Cities. I wish it’d been published when we were in the region, yet it’s since presented even more excuses to return to this stunning part of Italy.\n\nIf you’d also like to “eat, feel and live local in Italy” as we did in Modena, check out the BlogVille project website.\n\nNeed more inspiration? This link contains an index of all my posts from Italy.\n\nThanks & Disclosure:\n\nThe Emilia-Romagna Tourist Board hosted us during our time in Modena.\n\nWe’d like to extend an extra special thank you – or grazie mille – to Nick and Francesca for coordinating all the details and making us feel so welcome in Emilia-Romagna. For this excursion, we also thank our guide, Elena, for giving us much insight into local culture.\n\nPhotography & text © Tricia A. Mitchell. All Rights Reserved."
