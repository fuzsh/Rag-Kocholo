        "text": "Some of the best things to do in Maranello\n\nFerrari Museum and Factory Tour\n\nThe Ferrari Museum gives visitors a good account of the company's history. It contains some of the most iconic cars ever built. Museum guests can also try a Ferrari F1 car simulator for a virtual race. It may be the closest you'll get to sitting behind the wheel of a Formula One car on race day.\n\nThe museum features rotating exhibits, each telling a fascinating story. Be sure to watch our video tour of the museum to get an idea of what to expect. But note that what you see during your visit will be a little different.\n\nAfter learning about the company, visitors can enjoy an espresso at the café or search for a souvenir from the shop. You can also embark on the factory tour. The shuttle bus tour will take you to the Fiorano race track and into the heart of the factory. Visitors will remain on the shuttle during the tour as a guide talks about the history of the Italian car maker.\n\nLamborghini Museum\n\nLocated in the nearby town of Sant’Agata Bolognese, the Lamborghini museum is about 30 minutes away from the Ferrari Museum. The museum was only opened in 2016, so it is relatively new.\n\nAs the museum's website states, the experience takes you to the heart of the brand. Lamborghini fans will be delighted at all the iconic models on display. These include legendary cars like the Sesto Elemento, Veneno, Reventón, and the Countach.\n\nYou can also take a factory tour during your visit, but note that this has strict rules. The museum is relatively small, so the visit should be quick unless you're a superfan. Don't leave without picking up merchandise from the museum's store.\n\nBologna\n\nIf you need a break from viewing iconic sports cars, visit the beautiful city of Bologna. Strolling through Bologna is like walking into the past. Piazzas, markets, and street side cafés dot the city. The Piazza Maggiore and the Piazza del Nettuno are two must-see squares. Bologna's famous Neptune Fountain (Fontana del Nettuno) is located in Piazza del Nettuno.\n\nTorre Degli Asinelli, one of Bologna's leaning towers, is a short walk from Piazza Maggiore. You can climb to the top for a bird's eye view of the city. Bologna is also home to some of Italy's best museums and galleries. These include the National Art Gallery and the Carpigiani Gelato Museum.\n\nModena\n\nWhile Modena isn’t as well-known as Bologna, it is gorgeous in its own right. Just 20 minutes away from Maranello, the city has many UNESCO World Heritage Sites. However, Modena is far more famous because it is the birthplace of Enzo Ferrari.\n\nOne of the most popular destinations in Modena is Torre Ghirlandina, the bell tower of the Modena Cathedral. The tower rises 88 meters into the sky and overlooks Piazza del Torre, where a statue of poet Alessandro Tassoni stands. The interior is open to visitors; you can climb 200 steps to the top for incredible panoramic views of the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\nModena is also home to the Enzo Ferrari Museum (Museo Enzo Ferrari). It includes the house where Enzo was born and a modern exhibition building. You can learn about Enzo's life through the exhibits on display. You can also take the shuttle bus to the Ferrari Museum in Maranello.\n\nAutodromo Di Modena\n\nAnyone curious about driving on a track should visit Autodromo Di Modena. There, you can rent a GT car and drive on the circuit. You can also take your own car or motorbike and test it out on the circuit. It is a great way to experience a real race track, even if you are only a novice driver. You can take a specialized sports driving course at the track to take things further. It will teach you the secrets used by elite race car drivers.\n\nHoracio Pagani Museum\n\nLocated in San Cesario Sul Panaro, the Pagani Museum (Horacio Pagani Museo) is a 30-minute drive away from the heart of Maranello. Fans of the hypercar company can visit the museum to learn more about the iconic cars as they explore the exhibits.\n\nWhile the name Pagani may not be familiar to people who are not hypercar fans, the museum offers an opportunity to learn more about the brand and the iconic cars they built. Many consider the cars to be art on wheels.\n\nThe museum also has plenty of information about its founder, Horacio Pagani. Any fan of the combustion engine should consider stopping by the museum. Something worth noting is that the Pagani factory is in the same location. You may be fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of an unannounced hypercar returning to the factory after a test drive. We certainly did during our visit.\n\nSalse di Nirano\n\nIf you're interested in a geological expedition, the town of Fiorano Modenese has something for you. Just 8 minutes away from Maranello, between the Chianca and Fossa rivers, is the quiet Riserva Naturale Salse di Nirano nature reserve. It hosts a set of intriguing mud volcanos known as Salse di Nirano.\n\nThe 200-hectare reserve established in 1982 protects these volcanos from unauthorized activity. It is along the 'Mud Volcanoes Path', a 60km path with mud volcanoes at certain spots going through six towns. If this intrigues you, use the Mud Volcanoes Path app to access maps and information on each site. Each town has other interesting attractions to explore.\n\nCastello di Levizzano\n\nCastello di Levizzano (Levizzano Castle) is located on a walled elevation in Levizzano Rangone, 14 minutes away from Maranello. Initially used as a military fortress, it was later converted into a residence. This happened after the Bishop of Modena gave it to the Marquis Bonifacio of Tuscany. Subsequent renovations and restoration efforts resulted in a mix of different architectural styles.\n\nToday, Levizzano Castle attracts tourists curious to learn about its past. The main attraction is the Matildic Tower. It served as a chapel before it was deconsecrated.\n\nThe castle also has other interesting parts to explore. These include the courtyard, the gardens, and Stanze dei Vescovi on the ground floor. Stanze dei Vescovi has an elaborate fresco ceiling dating back to the 16th century.\n\nAlso present in the castle is the Rosso Graspa Museum of Wine and Rural Society. The museum displays various ancient agricultural tools, many of which were used for grape processing.\n\nCasa Museo Luciano Pavarotti\n\nIf you're an opera fan or appreciate a great voice, you'll likely know Luciano Pavarotti. The late operatic tenor captivated worldwide opera fans with his voice. Pavarotti was a Modena native, and after he passed away in 2007, his home became a museum. Here, you can learn more about the man with the iconic voice.\n\nThe Pavarotti Home Museum (Casa Museo Luciano Pavarotti) is only 15 minutes away from the center of Maranello. It offers visitors information about the maestro's life. The building was designed according to Pavarotti's instructions and has a collection of his opera costumes on display.\n\nOther exhibits include photographs, videos, and numerous awards. While visiting, you should stop by Ristorante Pavarotti next door for some exquisite Italian cuisine.\n\nImola Circuit\n\nJust one hour from Maranello is a must-visit attraction for all motorsport fans: Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari. Known simply to most people as the Imola Circuit, it hosted a F1 race for the first time in 1963. It was the site of the accident that claimed F1 legend Ayrton Senna's life during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.\n\nAfter many safety updates, the track is now a regular circuit on the F1 calendar. It also hosts world superbikes and GT racing. Despite being modernized, Imola maintains most of its classic features.\n\nOsteria Francescana\n\nYou can't complete your visit to Maranello without stopping for lunch or dinner at Osteria Francescana. Located in Modena, the restaurant has an elegant yet understated ambiance designed to complement the presentation of the dishes. It is one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the World, helmed by the visionary chef Massimo Bottura.\n\nKnown for its innovative approach to traditional Italian cuisine, the restaurant blends contemporary techniques with classic flavors, creating a wonderful dining experience. The three Michelin-starred restaurant has been repeatedly ranked among the World's 50 Best Restaurants.\n\nThe tasting menus at Osteria Francescana often feature dishes inspired by the chef's personal memories and cultural heritage."
