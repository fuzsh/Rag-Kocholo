        "text": "Ferrari is expanding its Maranello factory as a tribute to its late founder, Enzo Ferrari, who passed away 35 years ago.\n\nWhile their recent on-track performances show promise, Ferrari's 2023 season hasn't met expectations, standing in contrast to their closer competition with Red Bull in 2022.\n\nListen To The Latest Driven Mad Podcast Episode\n\nEnzo's influence in both Formula 1 and the luxury sports car industry remains unparalleled, and this expansion serves as a testament to his pioneering vision. On Twitter, Scuderia Ferrari commemorated their founder's legacy writing:\n\n\"Enzo Ferrari left us on 14 August 1988, but his legacy certainly hasn’t.\n\n\"People, technologies, buildings. Our Maranello factory's expansion stands testament to his vision, enabling us to push boundaries and shape the future of automotive innovation.\"\n\nBesides being the linchpin behind Ferrari, Enzo was a motor racing driver. Although he's primarily celebrated for founding the luxury sports car brand and its F1 team, his legacy is far-reaching.\n\nHis passing on 14th August 1988, at the age of 90, marked the end of an era, but his influence persists within the brand. With this factory expansion, Ferrari not only aims to enhance their F1 performances but also looks to the future of automotive technology.\n\nThey're gearing up to make their mark in the hybrid and electric vehicle (EV) sectors as well. The team detailed in the Ferrari Magazine:\n\n\"And now, the most awaited event is the launch of the e-building in about a year, where we'll make our unique electric engines – exclusively available in Ferraris.\n\n\"The new space will include vital buildings for production, like a Paint Shop, allowing us to provide greater personalization, a key trend in the luxury market.\""
