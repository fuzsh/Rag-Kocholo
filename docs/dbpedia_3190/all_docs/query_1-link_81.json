        "text": "Thanks to SuffolkBen for this info to Maranello.\n\nThe letters on the map correspond to the following.\n\na. Galleria Ferrari. There is quite a bit of parking outside the Galleria but if not you can pull up on the road in various places along the road Via D Ferrari that the Galleria is on. Its not a huge museum but you do get up close to a good number of Ferrari road and race cars from various decades. Plus you can see engines, sometimes prototypes etc. They change the display from time to time so you never know what you will see exactly. There is also a café inside. Its open at 9.30 until 6 although I think thats extended to 7 in the summer months.\n\nb. Formula 1 factory. Again its not a massive impressive building but its worth a look. Often on the right as you get to the factory entrance you will see the Ferrari transporters that are used to take the cars and equipment to the races in Europe. They are very impressive and you can just about see through and over the fences. No one seems to mind anyone taking a look or taking pictures.\n\nc. Main gates for the Fiorano test track. You cant really see any of the track from here buts its worth hanging around for a while as new cars and prototypes are driven round to hear, often on the back of a truck so they can be tested on the track. Not F1 cars though. These are built in a different factory and have direct access to the track. See b on the map.\n\nd. Original Ferrari Factory entrance. This is the entrance to the factory and it is still very much used today. Not much to look at but as its the original buildings its a major part of the history. All the factory workers still use this entrance and I believe if you turn up to collect your new Ferrari, this is where you go in and out. (One day I wish!!!)\n\ne. Cavallino Restaurant. The famous place that anyone that is in anyway connected to Ferrari has eaten in (plus myself!). Not cheap but its great if you get a chance. All the plates, glasses etc have the Ferrari logos on and the memorabilia on the wall is an incredible collection.\n\nf. Modern road car factory. This is the massive and impressive buildings that road cars are built in. Its not that old. Another good place to hand around and spot cars going out for test drives, especially ones covered is disguise. Get the camera ready! Also, just to the left of the entrance is the wind tunnel. This is massive. You simply cannot miss it. Its well worth a look. You cant get that close but its a very impressive building.\n\ng. This is a good spot to watch cars going round the Fiorano test track. You can stand and watch through a mesh fence but there are normally barrels or rubbish bins left around which you can use for getting up higher and looking over the top. You only see a small section of the track but is a good place as the cars approach at speed and have to brake very hard, they then go round a fairly tight left hander and the accelerate hard out of the corner often getting the back end out if they are road cars.\n\nh. This is the small monument to Gilles Villeneuve. Its not very impressive buts its significant for all Tifosi for obvious reasons. Its actually placed in a hedge which is carefully cut around it. However this means a lot of people miss it.\n\ni. Red Café. A great place to eat either indoors or outdoors in the Piazza. Across the Piazza just near the entrance to the Hotel Domus is the Enzo Ferrari Statue. The Hotel Domus is a good place to stay. Its a Best Western so the quality is good although not flash."
