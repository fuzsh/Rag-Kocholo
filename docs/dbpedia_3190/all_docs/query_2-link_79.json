        "meta_description": "Ferrari and Lamborghini!… Italy means also sports cars, so take the opportunity to visit the prestigious stomping ground of some of the best-known sports car manufacturers in the world on this private full-day tour. Join us in this very special day tour to Emilia Romagna, the region above Tuscany, known as the land of engines, to discover the production facilities and fascinating museums celebrating the history and technology of Ferrari and Lamborghini. From Florence, we will travel 1 hour and 45 minutes to reach Maranello, where the Ferrari factory is located. There you can visit the famous Galleria Ferrari, the museum which exhibits all the famous competition cars and road cars built by the prestigious company over the years. Start then an exclusive guided minibus tour inside the Fiorano test-track proving grounds and Viale Enzo Ferrari, an avenue which runs through the cluster of new production and other buildings making up the Ferrari “Cittadella”. A guide will introduce visitors to the various characteristics and features of the circuit where Ferrari has done its road and competition car testing since 1972, and to part of the Ferrari Factory where the Prancing Horse cars are built. For those who are interested in a unique experience we offer the chance to drive a Ferrari F430! Enjoy a 30 minutes drive on the roads around Maranello where Ferrari usually test his cars…not to be missed! In the early afternoon, we will move to Sant’Agata Bolognese, home to the Lamborghini factory. You can visit the Lamborghini museum, the Excellence Center and start the amazing factory guided tour: you will then see the assembly line of the Gallardo LP 560-4 and follow, step-by-step, the making of a super sportscar: from the bodyshell to the interior and the mounting of Lamborghini’s acclaimed V10 engine. Depending on the day productions schedule, though, visitors can instead witness the handcrafted creation of an Aventador LP 700-4 and its awesome V12 powerplant. The main hallway houses the actual production line of the engines, which are assembled by highly specialized and skilled workers completely by hand. Visitors will then walk along the upholstery department, displaying a vast amount of colored hide sheets. Here, according to customer specification, all leather used for the interiors is cut by a high-tech, computer-aided machine which sorts it according to three different levels of quality, avoiding waste of material; the leather is then manually stitched together. All areas such as seats, dashboards, tunnel and interior panels will be then covered by hand, ready to be positioned accordingly inside the brand new cars waiting on the assembly line….amazing!! Return to Florence in the late afternoon.     Some Tips…   If you want is possible to exchange Ferrari or Lamborghini with Pagani, other producer of Italian’s dreams cars! Want to add a stop at a top rated Balsamic Vinegar producer in Modena? Ask to our booking office.",
