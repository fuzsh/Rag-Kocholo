        "text": "You can arrange an owner's tour to the factory through your / nearest Official dealer. Depending on your business relationship with them it can be free to $500 each.\n\nthe official Factory tour is good, you start at the old entrance, check in, get offered coffee, gelato etc.. watch a video and then board a small bus in the old courtyard. They take you to the engine assembly bldg, the main assembly bldg, where they do the leather work and finally join the top and bottom of the cars. then you go to Clienti area - not sure what this is now with the new building at Foriano, then you go to the F 1 shop, and then to the Official Maranello museum finally end up at the Ferrari shop - usually they give you a Ferrari magazine book, and 10 - or 20% discount for that day at the store.\n\nif you are not an owner then you can buy the museum package in Modena, start at Enzo Ferrari museum, then bus to Maranello - drive through the factory and end up at the museum.\n\nThe track tour? I don't know anything about. I've visited Fiorano track & house but that was a special deal. see your Ferrari contact for that. the Simulator at the store ... is Asseto Corsa, kind of fun, but not all that.... But its all worth a visit.\n\nAt Pagani, you just show up, they let you in - small store and showroom, and I got a personal walk tour of the \"factory\" - which is a workshop. At the time someone was driving a Porsche 918 spyder in and out I'm assuming evaluating it compared to the Hurayra? Horacio was not there the day I visited, but i understand if you are there, when he is the chances of meeting him are good.\n\nLamborghini - kind of forgettable - I don't know about a factory tour, the Museum is right in the front of the factory - its just like in the pics, kind of old looking I've been once - lucky to see their Senna display - they had the car that McLaren used to evaluate the Lamborghini engine ...it was a bit macabre as they had a mannequin in there that looked like him.... It is literally in the middle of no where - about 30 Min drive from Ferrari through tiny farm roads... that was kind of fun.\n\nhope you have a great time.\n\nOh cool. The Reality is the Factory is interesting, but after about an hour... it's just a car factory ... ( I've been to several ) so it loses its appeal. the Museum in Modena is actually way better than I ever thought it would be. the one in Maranello is great as can be expected. the exhibits change routinely, I have not been since the beginning of COVID. The cool thing to get in Maranello is the special edition T Shirt you can only get there. I usually get one in each color since I don't know when I'll be back. in the Ferrari world that is the gold card.\n\nShopping Formula One right next to Cavallino is my favorite shop to go to ... and there is one in downtown Maranello that is good as well.\n\nBalsamic Vinegar - Casa Cavadoni was great, so friendly, and they really took care of us. I'm sure your family will have a Ham maker to take you to or Cheese maker as well... recommend. Lataria Cagnola in Castelnovo ... its a nice drive over the mountains close to where Ferrari's test drivers would drive. but the roads can be a bit pitted - and cyclist are everywhere.\n\nagain great information! Thank you. I will be at Galloni for the prosciutto, have not set anything for Parmigiano cheese.\n\nlooking forward to this, wife is being a trooper about this...LOL then off to Rimini for a week of beach (for her), then back to Milano and the Alfa Museum and the Villa Serbelloni for a nice luncheon.\n\nThe highlight of Ferrari for me was when I was in France actually. Cartier had an incredible exhibit of the Ferrari race cars was pretty amazing.\n\ngreat sounds like fun. Modena and Maranello are actually really nice towns, I'd love living there.. a bit hot in the summer but they are vibrant. I liked the Maranello Palace hotel - its across the street from Ferrari - pretty clean - not fancy in any way - more of a Hilton garden inn type place... but perfect for a visit. the roads around the Factory can be a bit confusing at first, but pretty easy once you get all the one ways figured out.\n\nEach time I'm in Maranello, I walk through.\n\nI don't think I've seen the same presentation twice, it seems to always be changing.\n\nIMO, its worth it to walk through, see at least one if not a dozen Ferrari you have never seen in person before.\n\nFactory tour, probably a bus tour, where you don't actually get off, but it's a nice overview of the inside the gate workings. The track tour is a bus tour as well, hear some stories, see inside the gates kind of thing, but it didn't actually go ON track when I did it.\n\nAs for the SIM, I'm not a video games guy, some enjoy it, but ok if you miss it.\n\nHave a great trip! Safe travels.\n\nSteve\n\np.s. two of my technicians and I will be in Italy Sept 7-14th , we have a Dynamic driving event during that time. We're starting in Rome, then Bologna, Maranello, Parma, back to Rome, and everything in between!\n\nYes. Shopping Formula 1 is now called Maranello Collection. The proprietor is Luca Fornetti. Across from the museum is Warm-Up, another great store.\n\nhttps://www.maranellocollection.com/\n\nThank you Spirot for this information. My daughter and I are planning to go this April. I live in Washington and have had my 355 serviced exclusively by Competizione and not FoW. Do you think they (an independent but certified shop) would be able to arrange for the “owner’s” tour or should I see what FoW would do? Happy to pay the fee either way.\n\nSent from my iPhone using FerrariChat.com mobile app\n\nHi, an independent will NOT be able to arrange a Factory Tour ( unless they do it on your behalf through the Ferrari web site - which you can do on your own). You have to go through Ferrari North America - or the local Dealer. Even if you are not a Dealer customer, they should be able to put you in contact with Ferrari's Concierge - or you can do it through the My Ferrari app - you need your serial Number and they take some time to approve you. either way - you will pay the cost of the factory tour - it is worth it."
