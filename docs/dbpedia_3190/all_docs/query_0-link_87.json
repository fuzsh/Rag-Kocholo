        "text": "A close look at the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena and the Ferrari Museum and Factory in Maranello, an honest review of both, and help in deciding which one to visit on your trip to Italy’s Motor Valley!\n\nIf you’re like me and have car enthusiasts in your family, you’ll want to make a stop at one (or both) of the Ferrari Museums in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region.\n\nWe recently visited the area and my boys had a blast visiting the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena and the Ferrari Museum in Maranello. We hadn’t planned on visiting both, but based on the information we had, we couldn’t decide which one was best. So, we decided to check both of them out and report back so you can make the best decision for you and your group!\n\nSee our list of the Top 10 Car Museums in Italy\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum vs Ferrari Museum Maranello\n\nWant a quick look so you can decide which museum is best for you?\n\nGood To Know: You can visit both Ferrari museums (Ferrari Museums Pass – Museo Ferrari Pass) at a discounted price. An adult pays 34€ to visit both (instead of 44€). You must enter both museums in a 48-hour period.\n\nWhich Ferrari Museum is Better?\n\nOverall, we think the Ferrari Museum in Maranello is the better of the two museums. It has more Ferraris on display, there is more variety in the museum displays, and it’s entertaining for all levels of car enthusiasts – from die-hard Ferrari fans to those with only a basic interest in cars.\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari Museum is best for those interested in the history of the Ferrari company and brand and the personality behind it (Enzo Ferrari).\n\nThe Ferrari Museum in Maranello is the best choice for families and F1 enthusiasts.\n\nWe think our visit to the Ferrari Museum in Maranello was worth it and we’d happily return but would skip a second visit to the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena.\n\nIf you’re planning on visiting both Ferrari Museums, we recommend visiting the Enzo Ferrari Museum first, followed by the Ferrari Museum in Maranello.\n\nGood To Know: Although we loved visiting the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, we were all disappointed in the Ferrari Factory Tour. You don’t actually get to go into the factory (more below).\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari Museum (Museo Enzo Ferrari) is in the center of Modena, and the museum is composed of two parts:\n\nA modern, yellow, spacious pavilion (designed to look like the hood of a car from the outside) that showcases Ferrari models through the years and shows a short film on the life of Enzo Ferrari (displayed on one of the huge walls).\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s birth home and his father Alfredo’s workshop, which contains exhibitions and exhibits on Ferrari motors, logos, and the life of Enzo.\n\nGood To Know: The museum was formerly called Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – Getting There\n\nEasy to access by train. It’s a quick 10-minute walk from the Modena train station (Stazione di Modena). You can also drive your own car and park in the free parking lot in front of the museum.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – First Impression\n\nIt’s got a futuristic, unique look and the building style makes you want to go in right away.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – Buying Tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets online or purchase them on-site. The museum doesn’t usually have long lines at the ticket counter.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – What’s Inside?\n\nSpacious display of Ferraris through the ages\n\nWall with printed Ferrari models\n\nSpecial exhibit in Alfredo Ferrari’s workshop\n\nExhibits on engines, logos, the Ferrari brand, and Enzo Ferrari\n\nFilm about Enzo Ferrari\n\nFerrari you can sit in, and have your photo taken (extra cost)\n\nArchives\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – Time to Visit\n\nWe spent about 45 minutes visiting both sites, but those more interested in Enzo’s life will want to spend more time.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – GT Simulators\n\nFerrari fans can see and feel what it’s like to drive a Ferrari! This is a thrilling experience but know that there are restrictions. Our four-year-old was so disappointed, even though we’d already warned him he needed to be 150 cm tall.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum – Visiting with Kids\n\nStrollers – You can bring your stroller in and access all parts of the museum. Strollers are a great way to keep walking babies and toddlers contained!\n\nDiaper Changes – There is a changing table in the bathroom.\n\nSnacks – You can get snacks in the cafe inside the museum building.\n\nTouching Vehicles – The museum has a strict ‘no touching the Ferraris’ policy, so you’ll need to watch small kids closely. There are no barriers, just lines on the floor.\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello\n\nThe Ferrari Museum in Maranello is in the center of Maranello, which seems to be dedicated to the prancing horse. The town is full of Ferrari shops, restaurants, and test-drive centers.\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – Getting There\n\nEasy to access by train. It’s a quick 10-minute walk from the Modena train station (Stazione di Modena). You can also drive your own car and park in the free parking lot in front of the museum.\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – First Impression\n\nBeautiful building with glass windows and a large prancing horse on the wall at the front entrance. It’s not as impressive as the bright yellow ‘car hood’ of the Enzo Ferrari Museum, but we like our photos here better (taken with the Ferrari logo at the front).\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – Buying Tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets online or purchase them on-site. It’s best to purchase your tickets online because this museum gets more crowded and the ticket line is long.\n\nWe had our combo tickets, so we were able to ‘skip the line’ and head right in to see the museum.\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – What’s Inside?\n\nHistorical timeline of Ferrari cars\n\nFerraris through history, up to present-day\n\nScuderia Ferrari exhibits (F1 Ferraris, F1 trophies, F1 driver bios like Michael Schumacher)\n\nToy models of annual Ferraris (this was one of our favorite parts!)\n\nLife-size models of steps in the frame-making process (like hand-pounding the metal to the desired shape)\n\nLarge video screen of the Fiorano racetrack from a driver’s point-of-view.\n\nMaterials and colors for personalized Ferraris – design your dream Ferrari!\n\nF1 racing simulators\n\nFerraris you can sit in. You can also have your photo taken (for a fee)\n\nLarge gift shop at the exit, but you can also exit without going to the gift shop.\n\nAmenities: Small café with coffee and panini, toilets.\n\nGood To Know: You can go to Giorgio Giochi (a toy store) for die-cast Ferraris and other Ferrari souvenirs.\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – Time to Visit\n\nWe spent a little over one hour visiting the Maranello museum. I can see spending even more time if you like reading all the panels and really taking in the exhibits (and you don’t have kids with you).\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – Ferrari Factory Tour\n\nYou can take a ‘factory tour’ of the Ferrari Factory in Maranello, which has been Ferrari’s main factory since 1947. It’s a 45-minute tour on a bus and you drive in and around the Ferrari factory campus. We saw:\n\nthe Formula 1 sport center (the most secretive building for Ferrari)\n\nthe Ferrari-themed ‘Il Cavallino’ restaurant (by acclaimed chef Massimo Bottura)\n\nthe prancing horse statue at a roundabout\n\nthe entrance to the Ferrari factory (the only place you can get out, to take a photo)\n\nthe Fiorano racetrack; we were fortunate to see a Ferrari driving on the track\n\na few new Ferraris driving around campus\n\nWe were disappointed in the factory tour, as we thought we’d see some of the inside of the factory (even through a window). We were able to stop in front of the building where they add the engines to the frames, and that was by far the most interesting part of the tour for all of us.\n\nWas it worth an extra 15€ – for us, no.\n\nGood To Know: If you can, avoid going on the factory tour on Sunday – there’s not much happening on the Ferrari campus.\n\nGood To Know: You can reserve car seats for the bus. The bus has seatbelts.\n\nGood To Know: The right side of the bus gets the best views in general, but the left side gets the best view of the place where the frames are added to the engines.\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – F1 Simulators\n\nThe simulators in the Maranello museum are different from those in the Enzo Ferrari Museum. Maranello has F1 simulators, and the Enzo Ferrari Museum has GT. The F1 simulators look much more exciting – you sit in a racecar body and the video screens wrap around you more than the GT simulators at the Enzo Ferrari Museum.\n\nWe saw people using both and my boys wanted to try them out! Unfortunately, they aren’t anywhere close to tall enough (see the official website for restrictions).\n\nTo give you an idea of the difference between GT (left side) and F1 (right side):\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – Seeing Ferraris Outside the Museum\n\nOur kids loved seeing the many Ferraris around town:\n\nVisitors who drive their own Ferraris to the museum and around town\n\nFerraris available for test drives for a fee\n\nFerraris that have been assembled and are being tested before being delivered to the client. These were our favorites because they’re the newest and the test drivers rev the engines!\n\nFerrari Museum Maranello – Visiting with Kids\n\nStrollers – You can access everything with your stroller. There are stairs but you can use the elevator.\n\nChanging Diapers – There is a changing table in the gift shop bathroom (but not in the bathroom inside the museum).\n\nSnacks – You can get sandwiches and light snacks in the cafe attached to the museum.\n\nPlayground – There is a small but nice playground across the street from the museum, next to the parking lot.\n\nTouching Vehicles – The museum has a strict ‘no touching the Ferraris’ policy, so you’ll need to watch small kids closely. There are no barriers, just lines on the floor.\n\nYou may want to read about Visiting Italy’s Car Museums with Kids\n\nWe love visiting the Ferrari Museums in Italy’s Motor Valley – it’s one of our favorite things to do in Italy with kids. We hope this info has helped you decide which one (or both) you want to see!\n\nIf you’re visiting the area, you may want to check out:\n\nModena with Kids\n\nBest Things to Do in Parma\n\nParma with Kids\n\nEmilia-Romagna with Kids"
