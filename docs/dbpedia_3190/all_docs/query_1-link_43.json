        "text": "As factory tour my suggestion go to do Lamborghini and Pagani factories. Ducati factory tour hasn't started yet (due to Covid reasons) and Ferrari factory tour don't show you the production line.\n\nI suggest to contact Italygate ( [email protected] ) to ask for a quotation for a tour for your boys: is a little TO located in Modena specialized in tailor made tour about cars, food and art.\n\nLamborghini factory tour: is probably the most interesting. The group is leaded inside the production chains and are shown all the steps. Is located in Sant'Agata, difficult to be reached by public transport. After the factory there is the museum where are shown the modern models produced by Lamborghini.\n\nDucati factory (when available again..): is another interesting tour because the chain is arranged in another way than Lamborghini. Are shown all production steps and there is the tour of the museum too. Is located in the suburb of Bologna.\n\nMaserati factory: is an interesting tour when the factory is working, but sometimes the production is stopped for FCA economical problems. There isn't a museum, but only a showroom with the model in production. Is located in the center of Modena.\n\nFerrari factory tour: the last interesting, because you visit the factory without leaving the shuttle, so you don't watch the production chains but only the buildings from the exterior. Is interesting mainly if you visit Maranello by your own, because the guide provide several details about factory and Enzo Ferrari life and history. Is located in Maranello, difficult to be reached by public transport.\n\nFerrari museum. Located in Maranello is the bigger of the several car museums of the area.\n\nEnzo Ferrari museum. Is located in the center of Modena (very close to the Maserati factory). Is smaller than the one in Maranello but sometimes are exposed very interesting cars.\n\nFerruccio Lamborghini museum. Is located in Funo, not so easy to be reached by public transport. For lovers of old car is very interesting because is dedicated to the history of the Lamborghini family, so sport cars but even other things produced along the years: of course tractors!\n\nMaserati collection: is located in the suburb of Modena, not easy to be reached by public transport. Is a small car and motorbike collection (not only Maserati) owned by the Panini family. Mainly old cars.\n\nDallara museum and factory: is located in Varano de Melegari, near Parma, not so easy to be reached. They produce mainly Formula cars, at the moment specialized on the Indicar. Can be visited the small museum and on request the factory where the cars are produced.\n\nPagani factory: is a small producer of very exclusive cars (around 30 per years) located in San Cesario, not so easy by public transport. More an atelier than a real factory, cause all cars are hand made. Can be visited the factory and the collection/museum.\n\nTest drive: can be done on normal road and on racetrack (at Modena racetrack). With not so expensive models on road is affordable for a special gift and the cost depends by the length (and the model). On a racetrack is safer and much funnier, but even much more expensive (you can estimate 100â‚¬/lap!) Almost all the Ferrari (and Lamborghini) rentals are located in Maranello, so is much more cost effective go there for the test drive. For insurance reason they require a valid driving license older than 1 or 3 years and be over 19 or 21 years old. For non EU citizen the Internatinal Driving License is required. On racetrack is enough a valid driving license and 18 years old.\n\nIn Maranello is plenty of controls on Ferrari rentals, so they are 100% legal and usually is impossible to do a test drive without fulfill the legal requirements."
