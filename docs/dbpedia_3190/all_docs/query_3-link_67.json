        "text": "It is the best known Italian brand in the world, with millions of fans.\n\nInternational leaders, the cars of the powerful brand of the prancing horse are produced in Maranello, between history and continuous development.\n\nFerrari is the Italian symbol most popular in the world of “Made in Italy excellence”.\n\nAccording to its founder Enzo Ferrari, born in 1898, all his engines have a soul: a soul that is the result of dedication, passion and determination through the pilot's entire life. In the beginning of its history, Ferrari took part in several motor races, resulting in victories and official recognition. With the birth of the Scuderia Ferrari, a sports club with the aim of allowing its members to participate in racing competitions, a good team was built, that competed mainly with Alfa Romeo, created by them. And Enzo, aside from being the dominant driver, also became the sports director (Alfa Corse). But constrained by not being able to associate in any way with the name Ferrari, he decided to leave Alfa Romeo with the ambition of creating a car superior to those built to date at that time;\n\nHe then changed from a pilot to an entrepreneur and constructed the first Ferrari in 1947: the 125 S, ambitious 12V cylinders, which should mark the entire automotive history in its multiple uses: sport, single-seater and GT. In the sixties, Ferrari turned into a joint stock company, and a few years later it joined the Fiat group.\n\nIn 1972, at the will of Enzo Ferrari the Fiorano Circuit was built. Being situated very close to the factory in Maranello, it is still considered an experimental and testing facility of racing and GT Ferrari cars for pilots, mechanics and the sport team. His last car, the fast Ferrari F40 Berlinetta, was the first supercar of the modern era; with 478 horsepower, refined mechanics and high performance, it was presented in 1987, a year before his death."
