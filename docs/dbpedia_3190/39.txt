Immerse yourself in the Ferrari story past and present, and top off the experience with a bit of time travel to the future too, at the Ferrari Museum in Maranello. The Maranello Museum tells the Ferrari story by delving deep into the Prancing Horse s extraordinary roots and taking visitors on a magnificent journey via its most famous and successful F1 cars, legendary sports prototypes and GTs, and, of course, the road cars that have set the benchmark for the entire car industry. It is a Ferrari company exhibition dedicated to the Ferrari sports car marque. Previously known as Galleria Ferrari, Museo Ferrari is not for cars only but also for trophies, photographs and other historical objects concerning the Italian motor racing industry. The museum, located just 300 meters from the Ferrari factory, also shows some of technological innovations that made the transition from racing cars to road cars. The exhibition, first opened in February 1990, with a current total surface area of 2,500 square metres and a number of annual visitors of around 300.000 (344.000 in 2016), was run by Ferrari itself since 1995; a new wing was added in October 2004. It displays exhibits that are mostly a mix of Ferrari road and track cars, including plenty of Ferrari s most iconic cars from throughout its history. The Museo Ferrari in Maranello, along with the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena, is one of the two exhibitions dedicated to the history of the famous Italian carmaker Ferrari. While the museum in Maranello is dedicated mainly to the racing history of Ferrari, the museum of Modena is mostly focused on the brand s overall history and the personal life of Enzo Ferrari. Museo Ferrari Maranello is sure to leave all automotive enthusiasts and fans on the marque with an unforgettable Ferrari experience.
