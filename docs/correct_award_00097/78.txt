The 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the American playwright Eugene O'Neill (1888â€“1953) "for the power, honesty and deep-felt emotions of his dramatic works, which embody an original concept of tragedy". The prize was awarded in 1937.[1] He is the second American to become a literature laureate after Sinclair Lewis in 1930.
