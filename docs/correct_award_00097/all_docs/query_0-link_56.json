        "text": "The Eugene O’Neill Theater Center, founded in 1964 in honor of Eugene O’Neill, four-time Pulitzer Prize Winner and America’s only playwright to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, is the recipient of two Tony Awards, in 2010 for Regional Theatre, and in 1979 for Theatrical Excellence. The O’Neill is the country’s preeminent organization dedicated to the development of new works and new voices for the American theater. The O’Neill has been home to more than 1,000 new works for the stage and 2,500 emerging artists. Scores of projects developed at the O’Neill have gone on to full production at other theaters around the world, including Broadway, Off-Broadway and major regional theaters.\n\nO’Neill programs include the National Playwrights Conference, National Music Theater Conference, National Critics Institute, National Puppetry Conference, the Cabaret & Performance Conference, and the National Theater Institute, which conducts semester-long intensive theater training programs, and Theatermakers – a six-week summer program. In addition, the O’Neill owns and operates the Monte Cristo Cottage, boyhood summer home of Eugene O’Neill. The museum is a registered National Historic Landmark and is open to the public."
