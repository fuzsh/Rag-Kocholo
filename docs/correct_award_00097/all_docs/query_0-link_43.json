O’Neill received the news that he had won while he was briefly living in Seattle, WA.  O’Neill did not attend the ceremony in Stockholm the following month due to ill health, and just two weeks later he was admitted to Merritt Hospital in Oakland, CA with a burst appendix, where he remained for 10 weeks. \n\nO’Neill dedicated much of his acceptance speech to the profound influence on his work by Swedish writer August Strindberg.  The money awarded to O’Neill for his Nobel Prize was used to purchase the Tao House property in Danville, CA, now the site of the Eugene O’Neill National Historic Site.
