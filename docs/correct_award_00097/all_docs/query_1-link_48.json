        "meta_description": "Eugene O’Neill (1888-1953) is one of the most important American playwrights of the twentieth century. He was awarded four Pulitzer Prizes and the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature. The son of an actor in a touring company and the morphine-addicted daughter of a pastor, he grew up in an extremely confrontational family environment. He loved long sea voyages, and actually worked at sea for a time until he contracted tuberculosis in 1913, and had to enter a sanatorium. During his convalescence, he decided to take up playwriting. He was the first American dramatist to adopt the techniques of realism, as his contemporaries in Europe had already done, revolutionising the theatre of his homeland by introducing the American vernacular onto the stage, spoken by fully rounded characters with an inner life and psychological depth. His works show a genuine acceptance of marginalised characters who strive to achieve their dreams and ambitions but never succeed, ending up in stagnation and despair. His depression, alcoholism, and pessimism are all reflected in his plays, as is the redemptive symbolism of the sea.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA short list of his plays:\r\nAnna Christie, Marco millions, Desire under the elms, Mourning becomes Electra, The iceman cometh, Long day's Journey into night, A moon for the misbegotten.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nDon't cry. The damned don't cry. (Mourning becomes Electra)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThey's no peace in houses, they's no rest livin' with folks. Somethin's always livin' with ye. ( Desire under the elms)",

        "text": "Theatre unites people. It recognises no restrictions, and has no borders or geographical, political or economic limitations. It erases the distance of time and space – and even of language. A play is the fastest way of discovering new words eras, and cultures. Even when everything had to stop temporarily, art continued to take us on journeys and connect us with one another.\n\nTravel Through Theatre started as an exhibition at Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos” in September 2022 and is a journey about the dramatists who bring us together, from antiquity to the present day. It is a tour of the lives and works of writers whose endless flights of the imagination dissolve every frontier, because culture is not the preserve of a select few - it belongs to all of us. Art reminds us that we are all passengers on a single planet, “the great globe itself”, as Shakespeare callet it, on a journey that will continue as long as humankind exists.\n\nThe greatest writers have always raised fundamental questions about life. Regardless of where they were born and what language they wrote in, they speak to all of us. We present a theatre map (by no means exhaustive) of influential playwrights who constantly show us a world outside our window and encourage us to look beyond the narrow confines of the here and now.\n\nDr Irene Moundraki\n\nCurator – Head of Drama Department of the National Theatre of Greece\n\nTravel Through Theatre was an exhibition designed and held at Athens International Airport \"Eleftherios Venizelos\" as part of the wider cooperation between the National Theatre of Greece and the Airport. The exhibition was presented in the \"Art and Culture\" area on the Arrivals Level (Exit 1) and ran from September 12, 2022 to May 11, 2023.\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nNATIONAL THEATRE OF GREECE\n\nCURATOR\n\nIrene Moundraki\n\nCOORDINATOR\n\nMaria Karananou\n\nNETWORKING LIAISON – COMMUNICATION OFFICER\n\nSassa Papachristopoulou\n\nATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT S.A.\n\nSUPERVISOR - COORDINATOR\n\nChara-Helene Mitsotakis\n\nArts and Culture Senior Advisor of Athens International Airport\n\nEXHIBITION DESIGN\n\nRe-two Design\n\nDRAMATURGS\n\nAspasia-Maria Alexiou\n\nGeorgia Polichronidou\n\nEva Saraga\n\nVivi Spathoula\n\nEftichia Charalambaki\n\nCOOPERATION\n\nEri Kyrgia\n\nCOOPERATION IN PHOTO SELECTION\n\nEvi Aggelopoulou\n\nQR CODES\n\nGravity, Custom Web\n\nENGLISH TRANSLATION\n\nPaul Edwards"
