        "text": "Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, the American playwright Eugene O’Neill was the first to introduce into the U.S. the drama techniques of realism, associated with Chekhov, Ibsen and Strindberg. His masterpiece, ‘Long Day’s Journey into Night’, is regarded as one of the greatest works of American drama. O’Neill saw the theatre as a valid forum for the presentation of serious ideas. Imbued with the tragic sense of life, he produced a contemporary drama that had its roots in powerful ancient Greek tragedies.
