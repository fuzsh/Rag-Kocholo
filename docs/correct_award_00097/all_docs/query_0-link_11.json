        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Literature 1936 was awarded to Eugene Gladstone O'Neill \"for the power, honesty and deep-felt emotions of his dramatic works, which embody an original concept of tragedy.\"\n\nEugene O'Neill received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1937. During the selection process in 1936, the Nobel Committee for Literature decided that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied. Eugene O'Neill therefore received his Nobel Prize for 1936 one year later, in 1937.\n\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1936/summary/\n\nThe mission of the Eugene O'Neill Foundation, Tao House, is to celebrate and promote the vision and legacy of Eugene O'Neill, America's foremost playwright.\n\nhttp://www.eugeneoneill.org/\n\nThe Home of Playwright Eugene O'Neill\n\nOf all the places Eugene O'Neill called home during his restless life, Tao (pronounced \"Dow\") House was the one that held him longest, the refuge where he wrote his last plays. In early 1937, he and Carlotta were living in a San Francisco Hotel. \"No roots. No home,\" Carlotta wrote as they searched for a place to live. Drawn to the privacy and climate of the San Ramon Valley, they purchased a 158-acre ranch near Danville and planned what O'Neill hoped would be his final home.\n\nHow to Visit this Unique National Park\n\nThe Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site must be accessed through a private, gated road owned by a community of neighboring residents. In order to experience the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site, therefore, visitors need to make reservations and willl be driven by a park shuttle from the Town of Danville, California. You'll receive a tour through Eugene O'Neill's \"Tao House\", and have time to explore the grounds before returning to Danville on the shuttle.\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/euon/planyourvisit/index.htm\n\nI have been to the Eugene O’Neil National Historic Site many times. I love to help in the gardens.\n\nOdd how dark our playwrights. Always enjoy Realism in fiction. O'Neill, his politics and political milieu came alive for me after watching Warren Beatty's film \"Reds\". Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Eugene O'Neill dominates the New England scenes.\n\nAfter watching the director's cut of \"Reds\", I read Jack Reed's books and some of Louise Bryant's prose but found them dated and difficult. Watching or reading O'Neill's tragedies shed more light on the common people Reed tried to reach and describe.\n\nWithout rancor I consider Arthur Miller the equal of O'Neill as an American playwright; though no doubt O'Neill really captures classical forms and structure. Cultural proximity also helps Miller as post-WWII America seems more accessible to modern audiences.\n\nThanks for describing Danville. I miss the rolling brown hills and cool climate.\n\njedishrfu said:\n\nNice place, I never knew that there was a place dedicated to Mr O'Neil. It seems from the website though that any visit will have to wait for COVID-19 to pass on by.\n\nIn NY state, there's the Roosevelt mansion that one can visit and admire how the wealthy Roosevelt family lived in the early 1900's just a hundred miles north of New York City in the town of Hyde Park NY.\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/hofr/index.htm\n\nWell, I have the combination to the gate and get into the garden!\n\nUrinating in Figurine Alley\n\nby Mary Conrads Sanburn\n\nIn my garden\n\nElaborate arrays of new bulbs break ground.\n\nWhat carefully planned maze of intricate beauties\n\ncan better showcase my extended family\n\nof chipped ceramic, salt and pepper cat shakers\n\nthat grace rolling flowerbeds,\n\nknown by my homebody cats as Figurine Alley.\n\nThey purrr-fectly laugh\n\nwhile urinating in the adjacent raised bed\n\nunder my handmade, tin can man\n\nwho is the watchdog of Veggieland.\n\nIn my backyard\n\ngigantic, pastel chalk butterflies sleep on sidewalks.\n\nA squirrel raises hell in a tree.\n\nI have a personal relationship with an owl.\n\nWe who who near the same time every day.\n\nI’ve pitched a snail or two\n\nover the fence. Clorox bleached a weed.\n\nIn my backyard\n\nI faithfully remain the Water Girl. Let the ceremony begin!\n\nWater trees: English laurel mimosa, sequoia,\n\nMaple, birch and magnolia.\n\nWater pots and yard filled with flowers grown in\n\nCalifornia.\n\nWater the cat bowl.\n\nWater the birdbath for the lovey doves.\n\nSugar water the hummers’ feeder.\n\nThere are holy water jars filled with tea and tears\n\nto feed the tree fern, azaleas, and hibiscus.\n\nHard earned tears after replanting thorny JFK Perkins.\n\nIn my backyard\n\nThe world is made of peculiar things:\n\nPlastic flamingos and slugs.\n\nA bottle of Mr. Bubbles.\n\nFeather droppings from angels.\n\nInterviews with ladybugs.\n\nA red wagon decorated with horseshoes.\n\nCDs with glued-on aquarium marbles,\n\nwhich spin from a cherry tree,\n\ngive a spectacular kaleidoscopic aquatic show,\n\nbouncing into windows, boomeranging off eaves.\n\nIn my backyard\n\nof wisteria, roses, and passionflowers,\n\nrabbits under the arbor at dawn,\n\nthere is a shine that rests in the hidden places.\n\nWhere those who happen upon it find it.\n\nNo one before or after can describe it.\n\nIt just comes and leaves comes and leaves.\n\nMary Conrads Sanburn said:\n\nThank you dear Klystron and atyy Today is a beautiful day ~\n\nLove and hugs to you both ~\n\nPoems about gardens capture the essence of both forms of human creativity. Trees, bushes, flowers, stones, pottery, sand, insects, bark, birds, reptiles, soil, wood combine with natural light and shade to tell a story that we visit, traverse and inhabit. Gardens provide a system of paths, a balanced sensorium under the guiding tutelage of the planner; the planter.\n\nThe gardens grows where the water flows.\n\nPoetry and thoughtful prose combine familiar words into shape, form and path that touch our feelings, feed our imagination and provide a mental abode that we inhabit for a brief time. The sun swings across the sky; the day journeys into night where the garden rests within the promise that the sun still shines."
