        "text": "<p>It has been a while since the resident idiot savant (yours truly) started a thread, and this one should be as useless as most of them!</p>\n\n<p>Many throw around Nobel Prize affiliations as proof of quality of education. So I decided to compile a list of colleges and universities according to where Nobel Prize winners completed their undergraduate education. </p>\n\n<p>First, the ground rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>I only included winners of the prize for Chemistry, Economics, Literature, Medicine and Physics. I did not include winners of the Peace prize.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>I decided to add Fields Medalists since their is no Prize for Mathematics and the Fields medal is extremely prestigious.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Most of the results were expected, although I was surprised at how few prize winners had graduated from several elite universities (especially Brown, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Northwestern, Princeton and Stanford). </p>\n\n<p>The conclusion, I think most will agree after seeing the numbers, is that one cannot rely on the production of Nobel Prize winners as an indicator of quality of undergraduate education because only 7 universities have produced more than 5!</p>\n\n<p>The summarized list of universities according to the number of Nobel Prize winners (unergraduate degree only):</p>\n\n<p>Harvard University: 21\n\nColumbia University: 16\n\nUniversity of Chicago: 13\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology: 11\n\nUniversity of California-Berkeley: 11\n\nYale University: 11\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology: 8\n\nCornell University: 5\n\nSwarthmore College: 5\n\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles: 5\n\nUniversity of Illinois-Urbana Champaign: 5\n\nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor: 5\n\nAmherst College: 4\n\nCarnegie Mellon University: 3\n\nCase Western Reserve University: 3\n\nDartmouth College: 3\n\nPrinceton University: 3\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania: 3\n\nUniversity of Rochester: 3\n\nUniversity of Washington: 3\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison 3\n\nBrandeis University: 2\n\nHaverford College: 2\n\nJohns Hopkins University: 2\n\nOberlin College: 2\n\nPurdue University-West Lafayette: 2\n\nRice University: 2\n\nRutgers University: 2\n\nStanford University: 2\n\nUniversity of Minnesota-Twin Cities: 2\n\nWilliams College: 2\n\nBrown University: 1\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross: 1\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology: 1\n\nGrinnell College: 1\n\nHamilton College: 1\n\nMichigan state University: 1\n\nNew York University: 1\n\nNorthwestern University: 1\n\nOhio State University: 1\n\nUnited States Naval Academy: 1\n\nUniversity of California-Riverside: 1\n\nUniversity of California-San Diego: 1\n\nUniversity of California-Santa Barbara: 1\n\nUniversity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill: 1\n\nUniversity of Texas-Austin: 1\n\nVanderbilt University: 1</p>\n\n<p>^^ The first University of Chicago alumnus to win the prize, in any field, did not win it until 1923 (that was Robert A. Millikan for Physics). The next one after that did not win it until 1937. All 11 Chicago alumni who have won it in Economics did so in 1970 or later. Ditto for 3 of the 4 in Chemistry, the 1 in Literature, 2 out of 4 in Medicine, and 6 of 13 in Physics.\n\n([Nobel</a> Laureates | The University of Chicago](<a href=“Page Not Found | University of Chicago”>Page Not Found | University of Chicago))</p>\n\n<p>More Chicago alumni have won the Nobel in Economics since 1970 alone than the number of Duke affiliates (alumni, professors, staff) who have won it in any field, ever.</p>\n\n<p>^ To really do the per capita adjustment correctly, I think you’d need to assess the populations only for the fields in which the prize is awarded. How many Nobels per capita only for the Physics community at Caltech? etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are about 50 professors in Caltech’s current Physics department ([The</a> Physics Faculty and Their Research](<a href=“http://www.pma.caltech.edu/GSR/facresearch.html]The”>http://www.pma.caltech.edu/GSR/facresearch.html)). Columbia (a much larger institution overall) lists about the same number of Physics faculty ([Faculty</a> Directory](<a href=“Department of Physics”>Department of Physics)). That’s without adjusting for full-time v. part-time, joint appointments and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, 25% of Caltech’s graduating class majored in physical sciences. That’s what, 50 students? Only 5% of graduating Harvard students majored in physical sciences. That must have been about 80 students (assuming ~1600 graduating seniors).</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Columbia also has twice the student:faculty ratio as Cal Tech. I’m not trying to knock Columbia (it’s a great school). But I think Cal Tech is really an exceptional school that often gets overlooked because it’s so small.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>But then consider that Harvard graduates more economics majors each year than the entire size of the graduating class at Cal Tech. </p>\n\n<p>You could try to break this down in different ways, and I’m sure the results would be interesting. You’re right in that this list is a function of </p>\n\n<p>1) Quality of instruction,\n\n2) Quality of incoming students,\n\n3) The total number of undergraduate degrees awarded in the relevant fields in the Nobel era. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I don’t know if anyone has the data for the last two factors, which makes it tricky to try to use this list as a measure of the first.</p>\n\n<p>But we’re probably over-analyzing. This is a fun list to read, and I’m sure it will provide lots of material for ridiculous flame wars on this site.</p>"
