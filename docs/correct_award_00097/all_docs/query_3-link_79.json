        "text": "Eugene Oâ€™Neill National Historic Site preserves the home and legacy of Eugene O'Neill, the first American playwright to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. O'Neill's most famous works include The Ice Man Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and Anna Christie.\n\nThe park sits on 13 acres among the rolling oak foothills of the eastern Bay Area, and includes O'Neill's home, Tao House, as well as a historic barn that is now used for educational programming with local students and to showcase O'Neill's works in live theater productions. The barn experience lacked adequate theater lighting, making the productions difficult to appreciate and engage with.\n\nThe Fund for People in Parks, in collaboration with the Eugene O'Neill Foundation, provided a grant for a lighting system that now gives visitors and students a more authentic theater experience at the park to engage with O'Neill's masterpieces for many years to come.\n\nProject Cost: $34,397 Project Completed: 2021\n\nThe Fund for People in Parks: $18,397\n\nNational Park Service: $10,000\n\nEugene O'Neill Foundation: $6,000\n\nNext to talented actors, I believe lighting is the second most important component of live theater. The new lighting system will greatly enhance the theatrical experience of seeing a play at Tao House, which is crucial to keeping Eugene O'Neill's plays alive in the imagination of audiences.\"\n\n-Eric Fraisher Hayes, Artistic Director, Eugene O'Neill Foundation"
