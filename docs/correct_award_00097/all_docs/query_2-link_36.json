        "text": "The Long Journey of a Restless Genius\n\nBorn in New York City in 1888, O’Neill grew up touring the country with his actor father. Disillusioned with his parents’ addictions and his father’s commercial success, O’Neill rebelled. He went on adventures at sea and in gold fields, and battled alcoholism and depression. At 24, tuberculosis forced O’Neill to pause. During recovery, he began writing groundbreaking plays like Beyond the Horizon and Anna Christie.\n\nAfter winning early acclaim, O’Neill worked with singular focus on an epic 11-play cycle about an American family. Plagued by health issues, he abandoned the project, but triumphed with masterpieces like Long Day’s Journey Into Night. In 1936, he became the first American playwright awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, O’Neill wanted solitude to focus on writing. In 1937, he and wife Carlotta built Tao House in Danville, California as a refuge. The home’s name reflects their desire for serenity. At Tao House, O’Neill wrote his late career classics including The Iceman Cometh and A Moon for the Misbegotten.\n\nTao House sheltered the fragile playwright during his last great creative period.\n\nGetting There and Reservations\n\nTo reach the site, visitors must take the free park shuttle from the Museum of the San Ramon Valley in Danville, as private vehicles are prohibited. Secure your spot by reserving in advance—email or call at least two weeks ahead. Tours run Wednesday through Sunday at 10 AM and 2 PM and last about two hours. Let them know if you have accessibility needs."
