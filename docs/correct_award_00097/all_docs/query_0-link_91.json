        "text": "The Assembled Playwright exhibition presents highlights from the Harley Hammerman Collection on Eugene O’Neill. The exhibition includes manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, playbills, posters, inscribed books, and other unique and rare materials by and pertinent to the Nobel Prize-winning playwright.\n\nBy placing his impressive collection at Washington University, alumni Harley Hammerman has made the Julian Edison Department of Special Collections an important center for O’Neill studies.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Modern Literature Collection and Manuscripts Curator Joel Minor.\n\nThe University Libraries honored Hammerman and celebrated the collection with a Eugene O’Neill symposium on October 6, 2023. This symposium constituted the first day of the 2023 Conference for Irish Studies Midwest Regional Conference (ACIS) and included an exhibition tour presented by Hammerman and Minor. On December 10, 2023, Hammerman and Minor led another exhibition tour, which was video recorded:\n\nThe exhibition catalog is available online as a PDF; please contact Joel Minor if you would like a printed version mailed to you.\n\nHeader Image Credit: Carlotta and Eugene O’Neill in Le Plessis, France, 1930. The photographer is unknown."
