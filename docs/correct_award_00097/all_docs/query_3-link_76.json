        "text": "The Eugene O’Neill Foundation, Tao House, was established in 1974 for the purposes of acquiring O’Neill’s former residence in Danville, California and establishing it as a historic monument. Since then the Foundation has devoted itself to developing the site into a center that promotes the vision and legacy of America’s first great playwright, Eugene O’Neill, through numerous educational, artistic, and research programs.\n\nIrish-American playwright Eugene O'Neill is the only American playwright to have been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and also four Pulitzer prizes. O’Neill wrote nearly 60 plays in a career spanning three decades. During his time at Tao House in Danville, California, O'Neill wrote his most famous plays that rank among the highest achievements of the English-speaking theatre: The Iceman Cometh, Hughie, A Moon for the Misbegotten, and Long Day's Journey Into Night."
