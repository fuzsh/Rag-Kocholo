        "text": "O'Neill is also the USA's greatest Irish-American author, son of an Irish Immigrant and an Irish-American mother.\n\nO'Neill's father was James O'Neill, a popular American actor who in the years before motion pictures toured widely in the title role of the romantic drama The Count of Monte Cristo.\n\nO'Neill's childhood was troubled by his mother's addiction to morphine following complications from his birth, and by his father's and elder brother's alcoholism.\n\nHis father's work as an actor kept the family on the road and Eugene and his elder brother James in boarding schools. O'Neill attended Princeton University but was suspended, after which he traveled as a sailor on tramp steamers. As a young man O'Neill suffered from alcoholism, depression, and tuberculosis.\n\nJames O'Neill as Hamlet\n\nJames O'Neill (1847-1920) in\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\n\nLate in his career O'Neill dramatized his early family life in what is now known as his greatest (and most widely performed play, Long Day's Journey into Night (1956).\n\nThe play depicts the Tyrone family, who closely resemble the O'Neills including Eugene's elder brother Jamie, as the four interact in a single summer day from morning till midnight at their summer home near the New England seaside.\n\nThe Tyrones struggle to speak truthfully and helpfully to each other but eventually succumb to their chronic problems of addiction, illness, and their various painful memories and losses, even as they desperately love each other and cannot imagine turning to or caring as much for anyone else.\n\nThe crisis of the play centers around whether Mary, the mother of the family, has resumed her addiction to morphine, which she began taking after the difficult birth of her youngest son Eugene, who is called Edmond after a middle son in the family who died in childhood after being exposed to measles by the oldest son Jamie.\n\nEven in the depths of their anguish the members of their family remember to each other the \"dreams\" that still live in their hearts, minds, and memories. As in many plays by O'Neill, such dreams are increasingly, painfully exposed as illusions, yet these dreams are also redemptive of these individuals' finest potential and the beauty they have glimpsed and partly embodied in their powerfully felt lives.\n\nThe play is set in the summer of 1912 at the O'Neills' summer cottage in New London, Connecticutt, which is now a national landmark.\n\nThe timing of the play occurs at the point when Edmond-Eugene has returned from his years as a sailor who lived and nearly died as a sailor in various ports of call around the Atlantic. The character is now suffering from tuberculosis, which killed many people in the days before antibiotics.\n\nAnother significance to the play's timing is that Eugene O'Neill, himself sent to a sanitorium to recover from alcoholism and tuberculosis in 1912 at the age of 24, used this convalescence to write his first plays, which he never stopped doing until late in life when a mysterious disease paralyzed him and prevented him from writing."
