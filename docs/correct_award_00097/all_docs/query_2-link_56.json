        "text": "Description\n\nThis collection of thirty years of interviews with America's only Nobel Prize dramatist records his encounters with the press and gives a striking portrait of the man and the process of his public mythologizing.\n\nA profoundly private individual, O'Neill struggled throughout his life to overcome his intense discomfort with oral discourse as he responded to the probing of interviewers wishing him to discuss a wide range of social, political, literary, and theatrical issues.\n\nCollected in their entirety for the first time, these interviews begin in 1920, when O'Neill was thirty-two. Serious American drama, for many, began and, for many others, ended with Eugene O'Neill. This collection lends new testimony to the truth of that assertion."
