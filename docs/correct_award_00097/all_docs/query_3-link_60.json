        "text": "The Eugene O’Neill National Historic Site, located in Danville, California, preserves Tao House, the Monterey Colonial hillside home of America’s only Nobel Prize-winning playwright, Eugene O’Neill. It was here that he wrote some of his most famous plays, including The Iceman Cometh, Long Day’s Journey Into Night and A Moon for the Misbegotten.\n\nEach year between August and September, the Eugene O’Neill Foundation celebrates the Eugene O’Neill Festival by producing some of the playwright’s most famous works in the large barn located at the Eugene O’Neill National Historic Site. This popular event serves as a tribute to O’Neill’s contributions to American theater and literature."
