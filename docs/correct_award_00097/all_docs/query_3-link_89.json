        "text": "OâNeillâs love for drama was born when he attended a production of Henrik Ibsenâa âHedda Gablerâ. OâNeill later wrote âThat experience discovered an entire new world of drama for me, It gave me my first conception of a modern theater where truth might live.â\n\nOâNeillâs youth was an eventful one. He travelled the world, filling his time with alcohol and sex. Aged twenty-four, OâNeill was a patient at the Gaylord Farm sanatorium, recovering from tuberculosis. While at the sanitorium, he discovered the plays of Swedish expressionist writer August Strindberg. It was this discovery, he said, that inspired him to become a playwright.\n\nO'Neill's first published play, âBeyond the Horizonâ, opened on Broadway in 1920 to great acclaim, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. âAnna Christieâ, the story of a cynical, desperate ex-hooker from Minnesota won the Pulitzer Prize in 1922.\n\nThe loss of both his parents and his brother in the space of three years sent OâNeill into a deep depression during which he began working on âDesire Under the Elmsâ which premiered on Broadway in 1924. The play was described by critic Travis Bogard as âthe first important tragedy to be written in America.â\n\nâStrange Interludeâ (Pulitzer Prize 1928), OâNeillâs five-and-a-half-hour epic play, was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature eight years later.\n\nOâNeill didnât write another play from 1936 until 1946, although it is these later plays for which he is most often remembered: âThe Iceman Comethâ was produced in 1946 and the following year âA Moon for the Misbegottenâ. His harrowing exploration of his parentsâ embattled relationship, âA Long Dayâs Journey Into Nightâ was so deeply personal that OâNeill left instructions for the play to be withheld from publication and production for twenty-five years after his death. However, his wife eventually gave permission in 1956 and the play became a best-seller, winning OâNeill his fourth Pulitzer Prize and a lasting legacy as perhaps the finest American playwright."
