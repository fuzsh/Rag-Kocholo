        "text": "If you have a US Robotics router on your system, I can email you the procedure to get into the router from US Robotics.\n\nIf it's a US Robotics switch, then you could have network conflict.\n\nYou would only need the switch and router if you have a perspective pc on the system. If you don't have a perspective pc, then you would just plug straight to the system.\n\nIf you have more questions, please give us a call here at Conquest Imaging. 866-900-9404 and ask for technical support or Pracha.\n\nThanks,\n\nPracha\n\nThe older units were direct connect with a static IP. Then along came perspective PC for CD/DVD burning and some image enhancements (3D valve representations etc). These units originally used a switch and both the perspective PC and u/s unit had to have a static address for the subnet it was being set up to use. Last came the USR routing switch. The local side was set up using a private IP typically 192.168.1.xxx and the WAN side either static or DHCP. I always used DHCP because that simplifies many things if the unit goes portable.\n\nIf you know how to manipulate the Network settings in the 512, just create a new configuration, and set the unit up for a 192.168.xxx.xxx private net, set up the dicom destination with your PC IP and port (usually 104) and the U/S side should be good to go.\n\nNow for the internal router, you will need to get the book on your routing switch. Find out what its out of the box default is (USR 192.168.123.1 I think, guess that was why Siemens sets the U/S private side to this subnet) Probably should just use that value when you did the U/S setup. Set the router WAN side to either DHCP if you have that capability or an address of the same subnet your PC network port is set to. Be carefull if you are going from the router to your PC directly to use a crossover network cable. The USR router does not resolve cable conflicts and depending on the age of your PC it may not either. Newer routers and PC ports may adjust for cable incompatibilities. In fact you probably do not have to use the USR router. We have used some Cisco business grade (close enough to the home types with a few more bells and maybe half a whistle more features) to do the same thing.\n\nHave fun\n\nFF\n\nYou can always use wireshark to see what is happening if the network is at least able to ping or traceroute.\n\nIf you are in a system that has an active router, then your network will look like this from the Network Utility in SUI:\n\nsequoia 127.0.0.1 Network Host\n\nSEQ12345 192.168.123.200\n\nGateway 192.168.123.254\n\nPerspectivePC 192.168.254.201\n\nAll other destinations.\n\nNote: To tell if you have an active router, the router will have a cable plugged into the WAN IP Port and two cables plugged into the switch side of the router.\n\nThe static IP or DHCP will be set up inside the router.\n\nFor a procedure, call 866-900-9404.\n\nWe will work on getting the procedure posted here at Medwrench.\n\nNote: If setting up for DHCP, make sure you get IT involved. There have been instances of the system being configured for DHCP and it killing the DHCP server for the facility it was hooked up to. If your network will not work with the router, and you have a good router, just plug into the switch side of the router and configure everything through SUI."
