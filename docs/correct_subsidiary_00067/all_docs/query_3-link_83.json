        "text": "German medical technology company Siemens Healthineers has introduced a new general imaging ultrasound system called the Acuson Sequoia to enable imaging of different sized patients with consistent clarity.\n\nThe new device is equipped with a new high-powered architecture Deep Abdominal Transducer (DAX) and other upgrades to elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound.\n\n“The new Acuson Sequoia system is designed to adapt to the ‘BioAcoustic Variations’ of every patient with different tissue density, stiffness and absorption levels.”\n\nIt can produce penetration of up to 40cm to offer high-resolution imaging adapting to patients’ personal characteristics to enable better diagnosis.\n\nSiemens Healthineers Ultrasound head Robert Thompson said: “Ultrasound imaging has been plagued by variability. Patients’ varied physical characteristics and user-dependent variabilities can impact a clinician’s ability to deliver an accurate diagnosis.\n\n“With the new Acuson Sequoia, Siemens Healthineers provides users with a solution that enables real-time imaging for varying patient types, including those with high BMI, without sacrificing image quality and potentially reducing the need for repeat scans and unclear diagnoses.”\n\nThe new Acuson Sequoia system is designed to adapt to the ‘BioAcoustic Variations’ of every patient with different tissue density, stiffness and absorption levels.\n\nIt is capable of providing high-resolution InFocus imaging throughout the field of view in real-time, eliminating the need to adjust the focal point of the scan.\n\nAdditionally, the BioAcoustic technology also enhances Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) bubble longevity compared to ACUSON Sequoia 512.\n\nThis contrast-enhanced ultrasound utilises microbubble-based contrast agents to enhance lesions visualisation and subsequent assessment."
