        "text": "Smart design, thoughtful engineering, sturdy construction, feature-packed usability, easy maneuverability, and portability â€”Siemens Healthineersconsidered it all, then built it all in. ACUSON Maple is a reliable ultrasound system that stands up to the rigors of daily usage and mobility.\n\nPowerful imaging at your fingertips\n\nWith ACUSON Maple, you can be prepared for virtually every patient, regardless of physical characteristics or condition. Intuitive design minimizes the need for manual optimization with less interaction with the system. Yet it still delivers high-quality images with excellent penetration and resolution on every patient. This simplifies usability and is particularly helpful for clinicians with less training, which can increase efficiency and patient throughput.\n\nThe speed of sound varies significantly in normal human tissues and is adjusted to best match the tissue being scanned. This technology improves lateral resolution and boundary definition between tissues in an image.\n\nWith a large selection of ultrasound transducers and advanced features that provide more options and capabilities, ACUSON Maple is designed to maximize performance and enable a confident exam across clinical specialties."
