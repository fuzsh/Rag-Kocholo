        "text": "The ACUSON Sequoia system’s InTune transducer technology was developed to produce the best acoustics for each clinical use case. With advanced materials, simulation, manufacturing and testing, the acoustic matching between transducer and patient were optimized; this, together with the electrical signal path between transducer and system, results in the highest signal fidelity throughout.​\n\nAdditionally, several of the ACUSON Sequoia system’s transducers feature a unique sensor technology called gesture-detection. This allows users to tap anywhere on the transducer to quickly activate and start scanning.​\n\nVector Transducer"
