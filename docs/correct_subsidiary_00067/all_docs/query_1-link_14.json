        "text": "Siemens Healthineers has launched an ultrasound system, Acuson Redwood, which offers a medical imaging solution for clinical departments including, radiology, cardiology and obstetrics / gynaecology.\n\nAcuson Redwood holds the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and European CE-Mark. It expands the company’s Acuson portfolio, which consists of Sequoia and Juniper systems.\n\nThe system is portable and lightweight with multiple artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for smart workflows and cardiology features.\n\nTransducers integrated into the device include micro-pinless technology and single crystal transducers for improved image quality.\n\nAcuson Redwood also comprises coherent image formation (CIF) technology for image quality and UltraArt Universal Image Processing for image choices.\n\nSiemens Healthineers ultrasound head Robert Thompson said: “Chronic diseases often require more imaging and additional follow up which drives costs. To meet this challenge, we worked together with input from users to transform care delivery with the Acuson Redwood.\n\n“This system is designed to deliver premium image quality, exceptional performance, and greater workflow efficiency within the constraints of limited resources and tightening budgets.”\n\nAcuson Redwood comes with Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and Shear wave Elastography applications for accurate detection and characterisation of lesions.\n\nThe applications are also said to minimise the need for invasive procedures.\n\nMoreover, the system has been designed to provide a variety of cardiac assessments. It has a 2D quantitative tool, Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI), to examine global and regional myocardial motion and mechanics.\n\nAdditionally, the ultrasound device includes stress echo, along with wall motion scoring analysis and Left Ventricular Opacification (LVO) capability for cardiac contrast agent imaging."
