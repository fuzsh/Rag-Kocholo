        "text": "March 29, 2022—Siemens Healthineers announced the market introduction of the next-generation AcuNav Volume four-dimensional (4D) intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheter in the United States. The new product expands the company’s portfolio of structural heart and electrophysiology imaging technology.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the AcuNav Volume ICE catheter enables treatment of patients who were previously not able to undergo structural heart procedures, including patients with transesophageal echo or general anesthesia contraindications, as well as patients experiencing tricuspid regurgitation. Additionally, the AcuNav Volume ICE catheter potentially improves hospital efficiency because of reduced catheterization lab turnaround time and shorter duration of hospital stay, while also eliminating the need of general anesthesia.\n\nThe company noted that the AcuNav Volume ICE catheter provides shortened articulation length of the distal tip that brings physicians closer to critical anatomy while enhancing maneuverability and control of the catheter during structural heart procedures.\n\nIn Siemens press release, Carlos Sanchez, MD, an interventional cardiologist of advanced structural heart disease at OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, commented on his first successful hands-on experience with the next-generation AcuNav Volume ICE catheter. Dr. Sanchez stated, “Shorter articulation length of the distal tip enables me to get closer to the anatomy of interest, especially for left heart procedures. This means better imaging outcomes and better care for my patients.”\n\nThe AcuNav Volume ICE catheter is now commercially available in the United States and offered exclusively on the Acuson SC2000 Prime ultrasound system, a complete structural heart disease solution that delivers advanced visualization and AI-powered quantification with two-dimensional and 4D transthoracic echocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiographic, ICE, and TrueFusion."
