        "text": "With ten facilities and five ‘centers of excellence’ in the South Florida region, Baptist Health South Florida purchased numerous Acuson Sequoia systems in order to enhance its imaging capabilities within the scope of gastroenterology, primary care, and bariatric specialties.\n\nWith its powerful architecture and innovative features, the new Acuson Sequoia expands precision medicine by enabling high-resolution imaging that adapts to patients’ size and personal physical characteristics, contributing to more confident diagnosis.\n\nSiemens Healthineers president and Americas head David Pacitti said: “The Acuson Sequoia enables our customers to image patients, regardless of size or body composition, with consistency and clarity.\n\n“Without sacrificing image quality and potentially reducing the need for repeat scans and unclear diagnoses, the Acuson Sequoia will allow Baptist Health South Florida to underscore its commitment to clinical and service excellence in its community by improving the experiences of the patients it serves.”\n\nSiemens Healthineers built the entirely new Acuson Sequoia system to adapt to the ‘BioAcoustic Variations’ of each patient, characteristics that include tissue density, stiffness, and absorption.\n\nWith its new Deep Abdominal Transducer (DAX), a new high-powered architecture, and innovative updates to elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, the new Acuson Sequoia produces penetration up to 40cm without image quality degradation often caused by attenuating echo signals, an industry first.\n\nThe Acuson Sequoia also improves the user experience by introducing user-friendly features, such as gesture detecting transducers, and a new ergonomically designed InTune transducer family that reduces operator stress while increasing comfort.\n\nA unique new capability among diagnostic ultrasound systems, ‘UltraArt’ provides several image choices automatically generated with a user’s preferred image parameter settings.\n\nThe Acuson Sequoia’s innovative features improve image quality, reduce variability, and enhance workflow to personalize medicine and improve patient experiences.\n\nSource: Company Press Release"
