        "text": "Siemens Healthineers recently donated an Acuson S200 Ultrasound Machine to Georgia Northwestern Technical College (GNTC) to provide real-world laboratory experience to students in the Adult Echocardiography, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, and Vascular programs.\n\n“I would really like for my students to experience working with a Siemens Healthineers Ultrasound Machine before they go out into the field,” said Nee Barnor, director of Ultrasound programs at GNTC. “It would broaden their knowledge and experience and enhance their technical skills making them ready for the job market.”\n\n“They will also never forget that experience of using a Siemens Healthineers Ultrasound Machine, because I did not,” continued Barnor.\n\nThe formal request to Siemens Healthineers was submitted through a coordinated effort between the Foundation at GNTC and Barnor.\n\nThe three Ultrasound programs at GNTC – Adult Echocardiography, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, and Vascular – are associate degree level programs and incoming students are accepted through a competitive admissions process. The programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) upon recommendation of the Joint Review Committee for Diagnostic Medical Sonography.\n\n“All three programs will be using this machine,” said Crista Resch, clinical coordinator at GNTC. “Siemens is one of the more popular platforms in the field and we are very fortunate to have a company as big as Siemens donate to our school and help with the future of students.”\n\nSiemens Healthineers develops innovations that support better patient outcomes with greater efficiencies, giving providers the confidence they need to meet the clinical, operational and financial challenges of a changing healthcare landscape. As a global leader in medical imaging, laboratory diagnostics, and healthcare information technology, Siemens Healthineers has a keen understanding of the entire patient care continuum – from prevention and early detection to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe Foundation at GNTC assists with purchasing equipment for programs, providing training for faculty and staff, and further marketing and public relations efforts. For information about the GNTC Foundation, contact Jason Gamel, director of GNTC’s Office of Institutional Advancement at (706) 764-3810.\n\nGeorgia Northwestern Technical College provides quality workforce education to the citizens of Northwest Georgia. Students have the opportunity to earn an associate degree, diploma, or certificate in business, health, industrial, or public service career paths. This past year, 13,734 people benefited from GNTC’s credit and noncredit programs. With an annual credit enrollment of 7,876 students, GNTC is the largest college in Northwest Georgia. GNTC has an additional enrollment of 5,858 people through adult education, continuing education, business and industry training, and Georgia Quick Start.\n\n# # #"
