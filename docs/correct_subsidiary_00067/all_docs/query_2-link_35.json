        "text": "Manufacture Description:\n\nSiemens Acuson S3000\n\nDesigned By You. Designed For You.\n\nDesigned to address today’s challenges in ultrasound imaging\n\nHealthcare professionals today are facing challenges on many levels: demanding caseloads, an expanding diversity of patients, and increasing severity of chronic diseases. At the same time, clinicians are tasked to deliver the highest quality of care at the lowest possible costs.\n\nExperts agree that a conventional one-size-fits-all approach to patient care falls short of addressing these challenges. What healthcare providers need today are advanced technologies and applications that intelligently respond to both patient- and user-specific needs. Tailoring diagnosis and therapies to each patient’s individual profile helps to improve clinical, financial and operational outcomes.\n\nThe ACUSON S Family of ultrasound systems were built to address today’s most difficult cases in ultrasound. They provide technologies and applications that offer personalized ultrasound solutions by delivering new levels of imaging performance, diagnostic confidence, and workflow efficiency.\n\nWorldwide 1.9 billion adults are overweight* and 600 million are obese*.\n\nUltrasound professionals are faced with a patient population that is increasingly harder to scan. Imaging at greater depths is needed to provide higher levels of diagnostic confidence.\n\n*World Health Organization (WHO), 2014\n\nGlobally, liver cirrhosis has increased by 20 percent in the last 10 years.**\n\nMillions of people are at risk of developing liver disease from obesity, alcohol abuse, and Hepatitis, however, patients usually show no symptoms until the very late stages. Using ultrasounds as a non-invasive test for liver disease can help assess liver tissue stiffness within minutes.\n\n**World Health Organization (WHO), 2010\n\nLiver biopsies are costly and carry potential complications.\n\nup to $2,700\n\nNon-invasive technologies, such as shear wave elastography, produce instant results and potentially reduce healthcare costs by avoiding possible complications from infections caused by interventional procedures.***\n\n***Franciscus, Alan, 2014. Hepatitis C Support Project,\n\nhcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/biopsy.pdf\n\nSee more, know more, do more – Powered by HELX\n\nWith patient-centric technology and applications at the core of its DNA, the ACUSON S Family systems offer the most advanced imaging performance ever.\n\nThey offer one of the widest portfolios of advanced applications in the industry that enables clinicians to personalize their diagnostic approach to each patient’s specific needs.\n\nUnique knowledge-based workflow solutions streamline processes and improve exam consistency and quality of care. Clinical and operational outcomes are further enhanced with intelligent service solutions that optimize system usability and performance.\n\nSee more – HELX image formation\n\nImprove your diagnostic confidence with beautiful images featuring exquisite detail and contrast resolution.\n\nKnow more – HELX advanced applications\n\nExpand your clinical information with advanced imaging technologies that improve patient outcomes.\n\nDo more – HELX knowledge-based workflow\n\nProtect your investment with upgradeable, easy-to-use ultrasound systems that address all your needs.\n\nDesigned to see more\n\nThe unique SieStream HD architecture of the ACUSON S Family ultrasound machines works to provide new levels of diagnostic information. Complex processing algorithms double pixel density to produce unparalleled signal fidelity. From transducer to display, advanced HD technologies have been carefully optimized. The result: beautiful, uniform images down to the pixel level that deliver excellent images – including at depth – to advance your diagnostic confidence.\n\nHD Transducer Technology\n\nThe unique, fine-pitched high-element density (HD) technology of ACUSON S Family HELX Evolution transducers delivers excellent image clarity and penetration. This improves exam workflow and imaging performance.\n\nHD transducers feature innovative ergonomic palmar or ridged grips to promote fine motion control, supporting delicate hand movements and reducing operator fatigue.\n\nHigh-density (HD) element transducers\n\nenable beam steering at greater angles to improve detail and contrast resolution\n\nachieve greater border definition\n\nimprove image quality and color sensitivity\n\nDesigned to know more\n\nThe powerful ultrasound engine that drives the ACUSON S Family ultrasound systems is the backbone for advanced clinical applications and technologies. They provide healthcare professionals with clinical information not available on conventional ultrasound systems.\n\nHELX advanced applications allow users to personalize the diagnostic pathway to a patients’ individual condition. This unique patient-centric approach to diagnosis leverages the comprehensive advanced applications toolbox offered by the ACUSON S Family ultrasound systems – from quantification and characterization of tissue to interventional procedures.\n\nPatient outcome and care are further enhanced with reproducible and quantifiable results.\n\nTissue characterization using shear wave elastography imaging can improve diagnostic results while reducing costs.\n\nThe ACUSON S2000 Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) helps to identify lesions efficiently. Its automated operation provides consistent, reproducible, operator-independent results with high-resolution full-field views of the entire breast.\n\neSie Touch elasticity imaging delivers additional clinical information to improve diagnostic confidence. Stiff fibroadenoma displayed in red using the 9L4 transducer.\n\nLarge stiff spiculated breast mass depicted with Virtual Touch IQ shear-wave elastography. Placing ROIs within the image helps to gain quantitative tissue stiffness assessment within the lesion.*\n\nLiver tissue stiffness assessment using Virtual Touch quantification shear wave elastography. Based on Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging, this unique application may potentially reduce biopsies for liver patients.*\n\neSie Touch™ elasticity imaging of biopsy-proven breast fibroadenoma provides real-time qualitative assessment of relative tissue stiffness to aid diagnosis.\n\neSieFusion imaging of a shoulder AC joint integrated into an MRI dataset using the 9L4 transducer.**\n\nImproved near-field and detail resolution in tumor vascular analysis for this liver metastasis using Cadence contrast harmonic imaging with the 6C1 HD transducer.\n\n*Not available on the ACUSON S1000 system.\n\n**Available on the ACUSON S3000 system\n\nDesigned to know more\n\nYour reputation as a healthcare provider and your financial success rely on best-in-class staff expertise, exceptional system performance and security as well as seamless clinical workflows.\n\nDesigned to adapt to the highest standards of care, the ACUSON S Family HELX Evolution provides a new solution to increase patient outcomes, improve standardization through eSieScan protocols and increase process efficiency with simplified workflow solutions.\n\nCompliance to the latest technical advancements lets you rest assured that the equipment you invest in today will be up-to-date and ready to integrate the most advanced technologies for years to come, allowing you to manage costs without compromising the quality of care.\n\neSieLink Remote Assistance Technology\n\nA new service tool for your ultrasound systems, eSieLink™ remote assistance technology supports your workflow staff with fast answers to technical and clinical questions. Secure remote desktop sharing allows them to communicate in real-time with technical experts from Siemens Healthineers to resolve issues right away and to receive additional training support. eSieLink helps to improve system uptime and promotes seamless clinical workflows.\n\nm a c a d a m i a n\n\nThe overall usability of ultrasound systems determines how well advanced technologies and diagnostic tools perform to expand the clinical capabilities of healthcare professionals.
