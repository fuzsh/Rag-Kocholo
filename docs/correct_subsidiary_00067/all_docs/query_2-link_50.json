        "text": "Siemens Healthineers has launched the ACUSON Redwood, a new ultrasound system built on the company’s new platform architecture and features advanced applications for greater clinical confidence, AI-powered tools for smart workflows and has shared services cardiology features used by different hospital departments. These features, along with a portable and lightweight design, offer clinicians an affordable and efficient high-performing imaging solution.\n\n“Globally, we are seeing an increased demand for cost-effective medical imaging services being driven by the growing healthcare needs of an aging population, particularly in regard to chronic diseases,” says Robert Thompson, Head of Ultrasound at Siemens Healthineers. “Chronic diseases often require more imaging and additional follow up which drives costs. To meet this challenge, we worked together with input from users to transform care delivery with the ACUSON Redwood. This system is designed to deliver premium image quality, exceptional performance, and greater workflow efficiency within the constraints of limited resources and tightening budgets.”\n\nThe ACUSON Redwood’s advanced applications, including Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and Shear wave Elastography, are available for the first time from the company in this segment and support precise lesion detection and characterization as well as potentially reduces the need for invasive procedures.\n\nA full portfolio of high-performance transducers including compact micro-pinless technology and single crystal transducers support superb image quality. With our coherent image formation (CIF) technology, the ACUSON Redwood maintains B-mode image quality performance even in complex modes and the system’s UltraArt Universal Image Processing provides several image choices right on the touch screen avoiding manual adjustment of multiple image parameters.\n\nWith a suite of AI-powered tools, the ACUSON Redwood delivers smart workflows for greater efficiency. Designed to go beyond the radiology department and bring precision imaging to more patients, lightweight and portable with 13 transducers, the ACUSON Redwood is easy to move and delivers premium imaging capabilities to the various clinical departments within an organization, such as radiology, cardiology and OB/Gyn.\n\nShared Services Cardiology Capabilities\n\nThe ACUSON Redwood is a comprehensive shared services cardiac solution. In this environment it is crucial to address the needs of a broad range of cardiac assessments which is why the system includes applications such as syngo Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) technology, an advanced 2D quantitative tool for assessment of global and regional myocardial motion and mechanics, stress echo with a complete wall motion scoring analysis package and Left Ventricular Opacification (LVO) mode to enable cardiac contrast agent imaging.\n\nWith the ACUSON Redwood, Siemens Healthineers enhances its portfolio of systems built on the new architecture platform, joining the flagship ACUSON Sequoia, and the high-performance ACUSON Juniper. The ACUSON Redwood has 510K clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European CE\n\nmark."
