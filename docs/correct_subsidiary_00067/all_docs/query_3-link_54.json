        "text": "Siemens EV9-4 Ultrasound Transducer Probe For Acuson X300, Acuson X150, Solonine G40 Ultrasound System Machine\n\nâºBrief Introduction\n\nThe Siemens EV9-4 Ultrasound Transducer Probe is a medical imaging device used in ultrasound examinations. It is a trans-vaginal probe that is specifically designed for gynecological and obstetric imaging applications. The EV9-4 probe has a frequency range of 4-9 MHz and produces high-resolution, detailed images of the pelvic region. It is commonly used for evaluating the reproductive organs, including the uterus, ovaries, and cervix, as well as for monitoring fetal development during pregnancy.\n\nCompatibility: Siemens Acuson X300, Siemens Acuson X300 PE 7.5, Siemens Acuson X150, Siemens Solonine G40\n\nâº Features\n\nBroadband frequency range: This probe offers a frequency range of 4 to 9 MHz, allowing for high-resolution imaging across a variety of clinical applications.\n\nErgonomic design: The EV9-4 probe is designed to provide optimal comfort and ease of use to the operator during exams, reducing fatigue and improving scanning efficiency.\n\nAdvanced imaging technologies: It incorporates advanced imaging technologies, such as Dynamic TCE™ tissue contrast enhancement, which helps enhance subtle tissue differences for improved diagnostics.\n\nWide field-of-view: The probe provides a wide field-of-view, allowing for comprehensive imaging of large anatomical regions, such as abdominal and obstetric regions.\n\nMultiplane imaging capabilities: It supports multiplane imaging, enabling the acquisition of multiple slices in a single scan, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of structures.\n\nColor Doppler capabilities: The EV9-4 probe allows for color Doppler imaging, enabling the assessment of blood flow dynamics in real-time.\n\nHigh-resolution imaging: The probe offers high-resolution imaging to visualize fine details and obtain detailed diagnostic information.\n\nCompatible with Siemens ultrasound systems: The EV9-4 probe is designed to be compatible with Siemens ultrasound systems, ensuring seamless integration and compatibility.\n\nâº How to use\n\nEnsure that the ultrasound system and transducer probe are properly connected to each other.\n\nApply a small amount of ultrasound gel to the patient's skin in the area that you want to scan.\n\nHold the transducer probe by the handle, making sure to keep your fingers away from the face of the probe.\n\nPlace the face of the probe directly on the area of the patient's body that is covered in ultrasound gel.\n\nApply a moderate amount of pressure to ensure good contact between the probe and the patient's skin.\n\nMove the probe slowly and steadily over the area you want to scan, maintaining good contact with the patient's skin.\n\nUse the controls on the ultrasound system to adjust the imaging settings, such as depth, gain, and focal points, to optimize the image quality.\n\nDuring the scan, you can freeze the frame and save an image if necessary.\n\nAfter completing the scan, wipe off the ultrasound gel from the patient's skin and clean the transducer probe using an approved cleaning solution and a soft cloth.\n\nSafely disconnect the transducer probe from the ultrasound system.\n\nâº Specification\n\nFrequency Bandwidth: 2.9 – 9.7 MHz Selectable 2D Frequencies: 5.0, 6.7, 8.0 MHz Selectable THI Frequencies: 2.9, 3.3 MHz Selectable Color Doppler Frequencies: 4.0, 5.3 MHz Selectable PW Doppler Frequencies: 4.0, 5.3 MHz Number of Elements: 128 Footprint: 28 mm Maximum Field of View: 126º Maximum Display Depth: 140 mm Biopsy Guide: Reusable Needle Guide set Biopsy Guide Angles: 1.7°"
