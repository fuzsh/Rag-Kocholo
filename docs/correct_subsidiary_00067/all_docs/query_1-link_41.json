        "text": "The Siemens Acuson S family is a popular ultrasound line and includes the Acuson S3000, S2000, and S1000.\n\nThese systems are quite similar, and thus, some people have difficulty telling them apart and deciding which one to get.\n\nLuckily, it is rather simple. At least it can be if you know what your needs are.\n\nIn this blog post, we outline the main similarities and differences of the models, including an explanation of HELX vs. non-HELX systems.\n\nAre you busy?\n\nThen just check the table at the end that explains the differences in options between the three systems.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about ultrasounds to prepare yourself for choosing a model, you can sign up for our mail course.\n\nYou will also receive an e-book: Guide to Ultrasounds\n\nJoin the Ultrasound mail course\n\nLearn how to pick the right ultrasound model in our e-mail guide – E-book included:\n\nThe Siemens Acuson S Family\n\nThe Siemens Acuson S family is at the top of the line of Siemens ultrasounds and it contains:\n\nS1000/S1000 HELX\n\nS2000/S2000 HELX\n\nS2000 ABVS\n\nS3000/S3000 HELX\n\nAll the members of the S family are high-quality, versatile systems that can be used for a wide range of examinations.\n\nMoreover, they have many features in common and are compatible with several of the same probes.\n\nThen, what sets them apart?\n\nThe main thing is that the number of options that are standard differ, and more advanced options are available on the S2000 and the S3000.\n\nAdditionally, they were launched in different years:\n\nS1000 in 2012\n\nS2000 in 2008\n\nS2000 ABVS in 2009\n\nS3000 in 2012\n\nTouchscreen-based S1000 HELX, S2000 HELX, and S3000 HELX in 2015\n\nSo, let us dig into the details a little bit.\n\nSiemens Acuson S1000\n\nThe S1000 HELX Touch provides state-of-the-art ultrasound technology and versatile applications at a low cost.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcuson S1000\n\nFirstly, the Acuson S1000 and S1000 HELX is an affordable entry-level ultrasound with a dedicated focus on vascular and shared-service operations.\n\nIf you need a solid system that can handle a range of exams but do not need anything too specialized, then the S1000 is for you.\n\nThis system produces images of great quality and its intelligent workflow technologies are designed to confidently meet your daily imaging needs.\n\nYou can expect an excellent performance from the system.\n\nSiemens Acuson S2000\n\nThe S2000 Helx Touch can be customized to a wide range of applications including abdominal, vascular, OB/GYN.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcuson S2000\n\nThe most popular member of the S family is the Acuson S2000 and Acuson S2000 HELX / HELX Touch.\n\nThis ultrasound machine focuses on general imaging and women’s healthcare and comes with automated protocols, Virtual Touch™ technologies, HD transducers, and 3D total breast ultrasound.\n\nAnd what does Virtual Touch do?\n\nThe Siemens Virtual Touch Technology provides an innovative way of evaluating tissue stiffness for the Shear Wave Elastography applications.\n\nYou can learn more about the clinical benefits of ultrasound elastography in Siemens’ video.\n\nIf you want to meet the increasing demands of dense breast imaging, consider the S2000 ABVS (Automated Breast Volume Scanner).\n\nIt is a 3D total breast ultrasound that helps healthcare professionals to be efficient.\n\nAnd it consistently identifies lesions or other areas of concern in fatty and dense breast tissue.\n\nSiemens Acuson S3000\n\nA premium general imaging ultrasound from the Siemens S-line with advanced features\n\nLearn more\n\nAcuson S3000\n\nThe last and most recent member of the S family is the Acuson S3000/S3000 HELX.\n\nIt is a premium system that has been designed for general imaging and interventional radiology.\n\nSo why is this a premium system?\n\nIt delivers excellent images, superior workflow, and new innovative technological solutions, such as eSieFusion™ Imaging, and eSieGuide™ Needle Tracking – none of these are available on the S1000 or the S2000.\n\nTherefore, the Acuson S3000 with the HELX upgrade is the most advanced system you can acquire from the S family.\n\nFor an easy overview of the standard and optional features we have referred to, see the table below:\n\nAnd what are the benefits of the HELX upgrade?\n\nFinally, we would like to determine the benefits that come with the touchscreen based ultrasounds Acuson S3000 HELX, S2000 HELX, and S1000 HELX.\n\nIn 2015, with the aim of improving the usability of high-end ultrasounds, Siemens Healthcare debuted the HELX Evolution with Touch Control upgrade for its Acuson S family of ultrasounds.\n\nThe systems have been designed with a dedicated focus on user experience, including workflow efficiency, imaging performance, and sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, the hardware and software upgrades for the Siemens Acuson S3000, S2000, and S1000 adds features, such as a simplified user interface, a touchscreen display, improved probes, image quality enhancements, and other configuration options.\n\nFrom the HELX systems you can expect:\n\nSieStream HD architecture\n\nWide screen HD monitor\n\nFull screen viewing mode\n\nWhat will this mean for you?\n\nMore detailed images as the SieStream HD architecture delivers high-definition imaging with high-density array transducers to the HD monitors.\n\nCombined with the full-screen viewing mode it offers a great overview of the high-quality images.\n\nYou can watch a short comparison of the S1000 and S2000 HELX Touch below.\n\nSum Up – Which One to Get\n\nAs stated, the most advanced system in the S family is the Acuson S3000 HELX.\n\nBut it is also the most expensive one.\n\nIf you do not need the extra, advanced options that the Acuson S3000 offers, it will be just as good to get either the S2000 or the S1000, depending on the needs you have.\n\nThe systems we have mentioned in this blog post are always in stock and now we also offer them fully refurbished.\n\nIf you would like more information, you
