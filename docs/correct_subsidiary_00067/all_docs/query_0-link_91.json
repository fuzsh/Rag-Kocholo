        "text": "LONDON (CNNfn) - German electronics and engineering powerhouse Siemens AG warned Wednesday it expected earnings growth to slow in the present fiscal year, putting its shares under pressure even as it reported a bigger-than-expected 81 percent rise in its latest annual profit.\n\nNet profit before exceptional items rose to 3.4 billion ($2.9 billion) in the 12 months ended Sep. 30, from 1.9 billion a year earlier, as meteoric growth in its semiconductor subsidiary spearheaded gains right across the company's wide range of activities, from power equipment to light bulbs. �\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had forecast net profit of 3.27 billion in. Revenue for the year rose 14 percent to 78.4 billion.\n\nBut Siemens shares fell 5 percent, or 7.45, to 140.75 in afternoon trade after the company said it wouldn't keep up the explosive growth rate of the past 12 months.\n\n�\"Due to developments in the world economy, growth in fiscal 2001 is not expected to be as dramatic as last year,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings before tax jumped 24 percent to 1.7 billion from 1.3 billion.\n\n\"The overall group numbers are a bit better than expected,\" said Schroder Salomon Smith Barney analyst Mark Davies-Jones.\n\n\"Two things are overhanging the stock -- there are loads of Infineon downgrades around today, and then there is the cautious statement on the outlook.\"\n\nThe German company has sold minority stakes in two businesses via initial public offerings in the past year - chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG (FIFX) and electronic component unit Epcos AG (FEPC) - to try to realize the value of businesses that had been buried within its diverse range of activities.\n\nInfineon, which continues to be 71 percent owned by Siemens, warned Wednesday it expects weaker demand and lower prices for DRAM chips used by the personal computer industry in the current fiscal quarter, as it unveiled a 16-fold jump in its most recent quarterly profit.�\n\n\"Although the market has already factored the weak DRAM pricing environment into the Infineon share, we do not see a significant upside potential for the time being,\" Juergen Wagner, an analyst at brokerage Sal. Oppenheim, wrote in a research note.\n\n--from staff and wire and reports"
