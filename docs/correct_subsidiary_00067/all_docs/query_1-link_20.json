        "text": "September 20, 2018 — Siemens Healthineers announced the first global installation of its newest ultrasound system, the Acuson Sequoia, at Baptist Health South Florida. With 10 facilities and five “centers of excellence” in the South Florida region, Baptist Health South Florida purchased numerous Acuson Sequoia systems in order to enhance its imaging capabilities within the scope of gastroenterology, primary care and bariatric specialties. The new ultrasound system expands precision medicine by enabling high-resolution imaging that adapts to patients’ size and personal physical characteristics, contributing to more confident diagnosis.\n\nSiemens Healthineers built the entirely new Acuson Sequoia system to adapt to the “BioAcoustic Variations” of each patient, characteristics that include tissue density, stiffness and absorption. With its new Deep Abdominal Transducer (DAX), a new high-powered architecture, and updates to elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, the Acuson Sequoia produces penetration up to 40cm without image quality degradation often caused by attenuating echo signals.\n\nThe Acuson Sequoia also improves the user experience by introducing user-friendly features such as gesture detecting transducers. A new ergonomically designed InTune transducer family reduces operator stress while increasing comfort. A new capability among diagnostic ultrasound systems, “UltraArt” provides several image choices automatically generated with a user’s preferred image parameter settings."
