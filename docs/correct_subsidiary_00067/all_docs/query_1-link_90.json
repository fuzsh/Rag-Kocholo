        "text": "The Siemens Acuson S1000 ultrasound machine is one of the most popular Siemens Acuson systems available today. The reason for this machine's popularity is simple: It combines quality, high tech ultrasound imaging with economic pricing. This blend is a recipe for both success for diagnosticians, and timeless popularity among administrators, private practicians, and university employees.\n\nThe S1000, while priced like an entry level ultrasound, is capable of producing 3D/4D (live 3D) ultrasound images for OB-GYN applications. This advanced capability for an entry level system is practically unheard of, making it popular amongst women's health specialists. Despite this popularity among this group of diagnosticians, the S1000 is also a shared service system, and is capable of producing abdominal, small parts (including breast, thyroid and testicular), musculoskeletal, vascular and urological images to name a few. This type of versatility is not particularly common for most entry level systems, especially is they are capable of providing specializes images of one specific application.\n\nOther image enhancing technologies that the S1000 uses includes THI (Tissue Harmonic Imaging), Tissue Contrast Imaging, Auto Gain Image Optimization, Pulse Wave, Continuous wave and Color Doppler. There are many other important technologies that this ultrasound machine employs, but these are just a few of the crucial ones to consider.\n\nThis ultrasound machine is also compatible with many ultrasound transducers, including multiple 3D/4D probes. This versatility regarding ultrasound probes speaks worlds about the S1000's adaptability and flexibility. It is also more economical for diagnosticians who purchase new systems, for the more probes that are compatible with other Siemens Acuson ultrasound machines, the less new probes that one must purchase. This can save you thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars when purchasing a new ultrasound machine.\n\nUltrasound Features and Specificities:\n\n3D/4D OB-GYN Imaging\n\nTissue Harmonic Imaging\n\nTissue Contrast Imaging\n\nCompound Imaging\n\nAuto-Gain Image Optimization\n\nPulse Wave\n\nM-Mode\n\nB-Mode\n\nContinuous Wave\n\nColor Doppler\n\nCompatible Ultrasound Probes / Transducers:"
