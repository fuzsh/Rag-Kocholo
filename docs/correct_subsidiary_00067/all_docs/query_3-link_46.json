        "text": "One key criterion for the long-term success of a healthcare institution is retention of highly qualified and proficient staff members that stay abreast with the ever evolving standards and technology. Because keeping professional competence on the highest level can have a direct impact on clinical performance, personal job satisfaction, and patient outcomes. For many hospitals and practices, however, it’s a challenge to send employees to training centers due to budget cuts. E-learning is an ideal solution because it involves no travel or accommodation costs, helping caregivers to train more efficiently while curbing costs.\n\nYour smarter connection to knowledge: PEPconnect\n\nOne of the greatest advantages of e-learning with PEPconnect is that the education plans can be personalized and delivered. Videos, webinars, interactive elements, and more turn continuing health education into a daily experience for every user. Learning activities can be paused and continued later on; or repeated until the participant has fully grasped its essential. And being accessible anytime, anywhere, and from any device, PEPconnect makes daily learning in a busy clinical environment easier than ever before.\n\nWhat’s more, having the entire course offering from laboratory diagnostics to diagnostic imaging in one place also facilitates education planning for the entire staff. PEPconnect currently encompasses 7,000 learning activities, available in seven different languages – with more modules and languages to come.\n\nAuthor:\n\nShannon Bellafiore\n\nManager, Virtual Education Solutions\n\nSiemens Healthineers\n\nSiemens Healthineers is the separately managed healthcare business of Siemens AG enabling healthcare providers worldwide to meet their current challenges and to excel in their respective environments.
