        "text": "In April 2021, it was announced that Siemens Healthineers is looking to sell its ultrasound business. One year later, in Jun 2022, Siemens announced that it is not selling its ultrasound business but investing in it instead.\n\nIt is unclear whether Siemens changed its mind, or did not find a buyer, but either way, the outcome remains the same. In this post, I will go through some of the reasonings behind Siemens’s decision-making process:\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐋𝐈$𝐓 𝐢𝐭\n\n- Small compared to the rest of the business: In 2023 Siemens Healthineers reported €22B in total revenue, €12B of which was coming from its Imaging division. Out of that €12B only €0.5B was coming from its ultrasound sales (~2% of revenue).\n\n- History of Decline: When it comes to all the other imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and X-ray, Siemens emerges as a dominant force. But ultrasound seems to be Siemen’s Achilles heel. Historically Siemens had 5% market share. In year 2000 Siemens acquired Acuson and became the biggest player in the ultrasound market with 20% market share. Over the years, Siemens has lost most of that market share. Today, Siemens is back to where it was prior to the acquisition.\n\n- Gaining back market share will be an uphill battle: Today, majority of the market is taken by other major players. In the current competitive landscape, it will be very difficult for Siemens to significantly increase its market share, given the fact that customers do not switch vendors easily.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐋𝐎𝐕𝐄 𝐢𝐭\n\n- Not a good look for Siemens: Siemens is one of the major players in medical imaging sector. But it is hard to imagine a major player who is missing one of the main imaging modalities.\n\n- Impact on other deals: One of the big advantages of major players in major deals, is their multi-modality offers. For example, it is very common to sell an MRI and bundle it with multiple ultrasound machines. Without ultrasound, Siemens multi-modality deals could suffer.\n\n- Ultrasound is a big market and is growing fast: Ultrasound is the 2nd biggest imaging modality after X-ray, it is also growing faster than other imaging modalities. Additional investment in ultrasound could help Siemens capture the market growth and perhaps increase its market share as well.\n\nWould be interesting to see if Siemens will continue to invest and grow its ultrasound division, either organically or by acquisition, or it will consider selling it again in the future."
