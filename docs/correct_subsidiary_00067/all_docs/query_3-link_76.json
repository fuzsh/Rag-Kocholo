        "text": "Siemens Healthineers has launched new artificial intelligence-enabled cardiology applications and a 4D transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) transducer for its Acuson Sequoia ultrasound system.\n\nThese additions position the Sequoia as a comprehensive cardiac imaging solution for regional hospitals and outpatient radiology/vascular clinics operating under a shared services model utilizing a single multipurpose ultrasound device.\n\n“We remain committed to pioneering ultrasound innovations that enhance clinical care and patient outcomes,” stated Daniel Frisch, Global Head of Radiology Ultrasound at Siemens Healthineers. “Integrating these AI-driven cardiology tools and our novel 4D TEE transducer into the Acuson Sequoia will provide clinicians with high-performance imaging capabilities across virtually all clinical scenarios.”\n\nNew feature: AI Measure\n\nA key new feature is AI Measure, which aims to streamline routine echocardiography by automating the tedious measurement tasks, generating up to 120 calculation outputs to reduce total exam time. The 2D HeartAI function leverages AI for efficient cardiac strain imaging workflows – automating view detection, contour tracing with or without ECG gating, and quantifying myocardial deformation. 2D HeartAI also supports streamlined ejection fraction analysis and strain evaluation, with or without contrast, potentially reducing unnecessary follow-ups.\n\nThe updated software suite includes tools for wall motion scoring during stress echocardiography, enabling assessment of cardiac function across varying stress levels to guide pre-surgical cardiac evaluations.\n\nNew Z6T 4D TEE transducer\n\nSiemens has also debuted the Z6T 4D TEE transducer, facilitating simultaneous biplane imaging to expedite diagnoses. This high volume rate, high resolution transducer enables preoperative assessment and intraprocedural guidance for advanced structural heart interventions requiring visualization of dynamic cardiac structures and anatomy.\n\nAdditionally, the redesigned 5V1 transthoracic transducer aims to overcome imaging challenges in patients with high body mass index, supporting comprehensive echo studies for detection and evaluation of cardiac pathologies."
