        "text": "CHICAGO, Nov. 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- At the 97th Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), from November 27 to December 2 in Chicago, Siemens Healthcare (NYSE: SI) (Booth #822, East Building/Lakeside Center at McCormick Place, Hall D) again leads the way in medical imaging innovation by offering industry-redefining advancements in computed tomography, molecular imaging, ultrasound technology and more – while demonstrating an increasing cost consciousness that expands the availability of its cutting-edge systems to a wider range of customers than ever before.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20070904/SIEMENSLOGO)\n\n\"This RSNA, Siemens underscores its commitment to the customer by continuing to deliver cutting-edge technology while demonstrating sensitivity to the increasing cost pressures of the international health care community,\" said Hermann Requardt, CEO, Siemens Healthcare. \"As an essential part of the new global initiative Agenda 2013, Siemens will further extend the portfolio of systems in the middle price segment, demonstrating how it leads the way in health care innovation by helping to manage price pressures without sacrificing optimal patient care.\"\n\nAt RSNA 2011, Siemens will showcase the following technologies:\n\nAngiography\n\nSiemens introduces new features to the Artis zeego, the only interventional imaging system on the market utilizing robotic technology. For the first time, an angiography system can rotate 360 degrees in just six seconds with the new syngo® DynaCT 360 application, which provides soft tissue images with a large (35 x 25 cm, 13.8 x 9.9 inches) field of view. The syngo DynaCT 360 enables visualization of the entire tumor anatomy and feeding vessels for chemoembolizations, radiofrequency ablations and chemoperfusions in interventional oncology as well as the entire abdomen to improve graft positioning, check endoleaks, etc. Possessing a shorter acquisition time than the regular and Large Volume syngo DynaCT, the syngo DynaCT 360 also facilitates less dose and contrast media than the Large Volume syngo DynaCT.\n\nAll new Artis zee systems now possess all dose reduction/reporting applications as a standard. Available at no extra cost to all existing Artis zee customers, Siemens CARE (Combined Applications to Reduce Exposure) package reduces radiation and simplifies the post-examination documentation of dose values. Applications such as radiation-free collimation and patient positioning, pulsed fluoroscopy and automated Cu-filtration reduce patient and physician exposure up to 75 percent. A new addition to Siemens already comprehensive dose-saving portfolio, the CARE Analytics dose analysis application enables medical staff to evaluate previously recorded dose data and make future improvements.\n\nSiemens is also showcasing new functions to its syngo Embolization Guidance imaging software to facilitate the minimally invasive embolization of tumors. An updated version of the software aids with treatment planning based on pre-intervention MR images and delivery, and allows the user to monitor treatment outcomes. Syngo Embolization Guidance can accelerate interventional procedures, helping to reduce contrast medium and dose.\n\nComputed Tomography\n\nThe ability to deliver outstanding images at low dose is central to innovations developed by Siemens CT. The groundbreaking technologies, which will be on display at RSNA '11, are designed with patient care in mind to help healthcare professionals perform CT examinations faster, safer and more efficiently. For example, the SOMATOM Definition Flash can perform pediatric examinations without the need for sedation and cardiac imaging without the need for beta-blockers. Additionally, FAST CARE – a technology platform for CT scanners – helps hospital staff perform CT examinations faster and more efficiently, while enabling doctors to keep the patient dose as low as possible.\n\nWith the SOMATOM line of Siemens CT scanners, patients benefit from lower radiation dose and shorter examination times because the system automates many operating procedures, suggests parameter settings for image quality and dose reduction, and standardizes processes, which makes results readily reproducible.\n\nHealthcare Policy and Clinical Affairs\n\nAt this year's RSNA, the Siemens Healthcare Policy and Clinical Affairs department will share information on \"Preparing for Tomorrow's Healthcare,\" detailing ways in which health care entities can deliver better, more cost-effective patient care. The booth presentation will examine future trends in healthcare, provide an overview of imaging reimbursement, chart global imaging trends, examine public perception vs. reality in U.S. imaging, and describe the ways in which Siemens will lead the way in the coming diagnostic revolution.\n\nImaging IT\n\nsyngo®.via(1) means efficiency and ease of use in advanced visualization, anywhere.(2) It automatically preselects the information and workflow, and provides insightful guidance on disease-specific requirements.
