        "meta_description": "Siemens Medical Solutions’ Ultrasound Division introduced the High Performance Imaging release for their ACUSON Sequoia echocardiography platform. The release adds two new transducers to the system: the 9L4 Multi-D and the 17L5 HD. Multi-D array transducer technology provides uniform elevation focusing for improved contrast and spatial resolution. The 17L5 HD transducer dramatically improves the vascular image detail, as well as overall resolution in imaging of the breast, small parts and complex masses. Its patent-pending ergonomic design allows users to easily grip the transducer in their palm, reducing hand strain while scanning. The ACUSON Sequoia High Performance Imaging release also includes Advanced SieClear spatial compounding with Dynamic TCE tissue contrast enhancement. Spatial compounding reduces acoustic noise by generating several frames of data with independent information and averaging those frames with the help of speckle patterns. It provides better detail and contrast resolution through more precise anatomical border definition, notably the carotid intima-media boundary. New to the Sequoia system is a high-definition 19-inch flat panel display with articulating arm that provides optimal positioning in all scanning environments and improves the ergonomic design of the system.",
