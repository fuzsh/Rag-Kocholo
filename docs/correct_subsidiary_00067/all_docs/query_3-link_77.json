I use the original probes I bought with Aspen Acuson from MIDES-Austria. Meanwhile, the Li-ion memory battery was checked, its voltage was 0.6V, then it was replaced with a new one, whose voltage is standard 3V. It still re-prints the same message on startup. '' Sono-Pac Software for Dis Transducer Software Not Licensed ''. I kindly ask for your help.
