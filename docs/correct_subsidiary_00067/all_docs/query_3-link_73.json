The Buyer must insure against all risks of loss, damage and personal injury caused by removing the Lots, repairing and restoring any loss or damage caused by removing the Lots from the fall of the hammer, and British Medical Auctions reserves the right to request a copy of the Buyer’s insurance policy to cover such risks at any time.\n\n7.3 If the Buyer:-\n\n7.3.1 being registered with a UK billing address does not pay for and collect a Lot within five Working Days of the Auction; or\n\n7.3.2 being registered with a non-UK billing address does not pay for and collect a lot within 10 Working Days of the Auction;\n\nthe Buyer may not be allowed to collect the Lot and the Lot may be placed in the next Auction.

If the Buyer does not collect all Lots within 20 Working Days of the Auction, any Lots not collected will be deemed abandoned and British Medical Auctions may either: -\n\n7.4.1 place the abandoned lots in the next Auction subject to a re-lotting fee equal to 30% of the Hammer Price plus VAT and, if sold, British Medical Auctions will pay the Buyer an amount equal to the Hammer Price less the re-lotting fee less any storage fees payable pursuant to clause 7.4, provide that if the Hammer Price is insufficient to cover these fees, British Medical Auctions may recover the balance of any unpaid fees from the Buyer; or\n\n7.4.2 otherwise dispose of the abandoned Lots and recover any fees, including storage fees, from the Buyer.\n\n7.5 The Buyer is responsible for checking the quantities of the Lots purchased at the time of collection. No adjustments in quantities will be made after the Lots are collected by the Buyer or the Buyer’s agent.\n\n7.6 If, for any reason whatsoever, British Medical Auctions fails to deliver an awarded Lot, British Medical Auction’s sole liability shall be the return of any deposit or monies paid for such Lot, and the Buyer shall have no further claim whatsoever including without limitation direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damages.\n\nPersonal Information\n\n8.1 Medical Auctions (BMA) Limited trading as British Medical Auctions will collect information from the Buyer before the Buyer is able to participate in any auction.
