Network properties required by the system and resulting risks 1-1 The device is connected via Ethernet cable or wireless protocol to the hospital using a TCP/IP network with 1Gb/s performance: â¢ If the network is down, the network services (see below) are not available which can lead to the risks stated below. â¢ If the network is unavailable, medical images cannot be transferred for remote consultation. â¢ If the wireless network is incorrectly protected (for example, open Wi-Fi configuration), the attack surface of all the connected devices is much larger, which can lead to the risks stated below. â¢ If the recommended network performance (1Gbit/s) is not provided, the transfer of images is extended, and availability of images at destinations (e.g., for consulting) is delayed. â¢ Only the protocols shown in the table of used ports are needed for communication. 1-2 PACS system for archiving images/results â¢ If the PACS is not available: images cannot be archived after the examination. In case of a system hardware failure, all non-archived â images can be lost. images cannot be archived after the examination. Examinations may no longer be possible because the â hard drive is full as non-archived images cannot be automatically removed. images cannot be archived after the examination. In case of manual deletion of images, unarchived images â can be lost. images are not available for remote consultation via PACS consoles. â prior images are not available. â â¢ If the recommended network performance (1Gbit/s) is not provided, the transfer time to PACS is extended, and the wait for switching off the system consecutive to the last transfer operations is prolonged. 1-3 DICOM printer â¢ If the DICOM printer is not available, film is not available for diagnosis/archive. 1-4 RIS system â¢ If the RIS system is not available: the modality worklist is not available. This can lead to data inconsistencies as well as unavailability of â images when sent to the PACS until they are manually coerced with the RIS data in the PACS. In case of a Worklist Query time-out due to poor network transfer, there is a possibility that non-actual RIS â data is used when registering a patient from the list of schedules on the system. 1-5 Network connection to the SRS server â¢ If the connection to the Smart Remote Services server is not available, then support from Siemens Healthineers service is limited. 1-6 Common medical protocol properties â¢ Protocols used in medical environments are typically unsecure, with the exception of secure Smart Remote Services (using HTTPS). siemens-healthineers.com/cybersecurity 45 Product and security white paper Â· ACUSON Sequoia VA20 Manufacturer Disclosure Statement According to IEC 60601-1 Statement according to IEC 60601-1, 3rd Edition, Chapter 14.13 2. Instructions for the responsible organization 2-1 Connection of the system to a network that includes other equipment could result in previously unidentified risks to patients, operators or third parties. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION should identify, evaluate and control these risks. 2-2 Subsequent changes to the network could introduce new RISKS and require additional analysis. 2-3 Changes to the network include: â¢ changes in network configuration â¢ connection to additional items to the network â¢ disconnecting items from the network â¢ update of equipment connected to the network â¢ upgrade of equipment connected to the network 2-4 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is fully responsible for the security of the network to which the device is connected. 2-5 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is fully responsible to ensure staff who have access to the device do not have the opportunity to provide any harm to the system. 2-6 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has to ensure that the internal network cannot be accessed physically by non-authorized persons. 2-7 Staff of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has to be trained in security. The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is responsible for providing this. 2-8 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is fully responsible to ensure that only authorized medical/administrative staff shall have access to the device. 2-9 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is fully responsible to ensure that visitors/patients do not have unsupervised physical access to the system. 2-10 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall provide access to the system for device administrators and device service engineers. 2-11 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION has at least one staff person with administrative rights who has access to the system. 2-12 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall ensure that neither access from the public internet or the organizationâs intranet to the device is possible. 2-13 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is responsible to ensure physical security for the device. 2-14 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION shall ensure that access to services for the device from other equipment is possible only on a need-to-do basis. An adequate network topology with appropriate firewall settings shall be used. 2-15 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is responsible for a secure infrastructure that makes it impossible to change, prevent, or tamper with data in transit in any way. 2-16 RECOMMENDATION: It is highly recommended that the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION monitors the network for unusual traffic. 2-17 The RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION is responsible for the hard drive encryption keys and for preventing the theft or loss of those keys. 46 siemens-healthineers.com/cybersecurity ACUSON Sequoia VA20 Â· Product and security white paper 3. Intended purpose of integrating the device into an IT network 3-1 To integrate the system into the clinical workflow, the whole ultrasound system will interact as a DICOM node in the clinical network. 3-2 The system is DICOM-compliant, allowing it to be connected to a network with other compliant devices for the exchange of images. Networking allows the transmission of images acquired to other DICOM-compatible review stations or PACS. A list of all patients ever imaged can be kept on the Radiology PACS making future retrievals fast and easy. 3-3 The system connects to the network through an Ethernet cable or a wireless protocol. The network interfaces allow DICOM connections to specific clinical systems such as a Radiology PACS or printer. Patient demographic data will be received via DICOM; acquired images will be sent to the Radiology PACS or DICOM workstations for detailed viewing and long-term storage. 4. Network properties required by the system and resulting risks 4-1 Unsuccessful data transfer not recognized Function: Archiving and Networking Hazard: Wrong diagnosis / loss of acquisition data Caution: Data transfers between systems are not verified automatically. Loss of data, if data is deleted locally before it has been successfully transferred to another system. Measure: Since not all systems support automatic storage commitment, verify the correctness of the data transfer at the remote system before deleting the local data. Effect on: Patient 4-2 Incorrect or incomplete data transfer Function: Data Exchange â Network Hazard: Wrong diagnosis, wrong examination / loss of acquisition data, loss of post processing results, corrupted data, inconsistent data Cause: DICOM objects are sent/received/retrieved. While objects are being prepared or during transfer, not all DICOM objects that are not considered are deleted, corrupted or unintentionally manipulated. Data on the sender and receiver side is not consistent. Failure of transfer not recognized. Measure: It has to be verified by testing, that there is no object loss during sending, which means: â¢ Verify that exception scenarios result in a failed job (and check for other exceptions in log files). â¢ Verify that error cases, which result in data not complying with the DICOM standard, are covered by exception scenarios.
