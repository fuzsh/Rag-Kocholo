This tutorial will cover the activation and usage of the contrast application. The ACUSON Sequoia ultrasound system was designed to provide ultrasound users with detailed and information-rich images that dramatically improve the way ultrasound is performed today. For CEUS, that means overcoming the technical barriers that are unique to this advanced application. The ACUSON Sequoia system has accomplished this feat by being built with enormous architectural power. This power, using InTuneâ¢ pulse formation, can provide visualization of contrast deeper, and with greater clarity, than even the original ACUSON Sequoia S512 ultrasound system. Prior to the start of this course, you should review the ACUSON Sequoia ultrasound system Major Modes tutorial and be familiar with the terms and functions associated with the ACUSON Sequoia system. Upon successful completion of this course you will be able to: Describe the contrast application features, options, and image optimization of the ACUSON Sequoia ultrasound system Discuss the contrast application touch screen controls and functions Modify the contrast application configuration options This module will familiarize you with this interactive training tool.
