        "text": "“Siemens Healthineers is committed to shaping the future of ultrasound imaging by empowering healthcare professionals with the latest cutting-edge tools,” said Ajay Gannerkote, president of Ultrasound, Siemens Healthineers. “The Acuson Origin is the latest example of that steadfast commitment, with its vast array of new AI features and its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, elevate patient care, and revolutionize the way we approach cardiovascular imaging.”\n\nThe system’s most distinguishing innovation is its suite of AI-powered features for measurements, view recognition, and imaging assistance.\n\nThese AI features build on the company’s rich history of AI innovation that dates back to the late 1990s, its holding of more than 900 AI-related patent families, and its portfolio of more than 80 products with AI elements. The Acuson Origin’s AI features have been trained on the world’s largest\n\ncardiac image database and can save the user time on diagnostic echo­cardio-graphy procedures by providing automated measurements that are accurate and reproducible. More than 500 AI-powered measurements on transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography are designed to enhance cardiovascular workflows and reduce variability.\n\nThe system also delivers automated contouring and quantification of all four cardiac chambers without the need for an ECG via the 2D and 4D HeartAI features.\n\nUsing the latest developments in AI, 2D HeartAI opens up auto tracking on contrast images, distinguishing the Acuson Origin as the only commercially available system with this capability.\n\n4D HeartAI is a dual modality advancement for 4D auto contouring of all four chambers in 4D TTE and both ventricles in 4D TEE, averaging up to five beats with or without ECG. Additionally, the system is the first in the industry to provide real-time cardiac view recognition. AI Assist, a new, AI-driven feature specific to transthoracic echocardio-graphy, recognizes cardiac structures the moment the transducer makes contact with the chest wall. The initial implementation of this cardiac view classification feature is Colour and Spectral Doppler placement.\n\nThe Acuson Origin is lightweight and easy to manoeuvre. Its ergonomic console is designed to require less repetitive motion, and its most frequently used controls are positioned closest to the user’s hand."
