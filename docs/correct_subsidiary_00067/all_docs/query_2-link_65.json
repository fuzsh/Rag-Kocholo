        "text": "July 1, 2009 – Siemens Healthcare today introduced a dedicated ultrasound solution for Obstetrics and Gynecology, the ACUSON X300 ultrasound system, Premium Edition (PE) – Women’s Imaging.\n\nThe system features 3D/4D imaging and new workflow tools such as automated biometry measurements of the fetus streamline the exam process for greater patient throughput. The compact system accommodates the needs of many clinical environments – from private practices to busy hospital settings.\n\nThe ACUSON X300 PE – Women’s Imaging system features syngo Auto OB measurements, a unique workflow tool that automates routine biometry measurements of the fetus.\n\nThe application also addresses the challenges related to user-dependence and variability as well as consistency and reproducibility in fetal biometry. Measurements are automatically saved into the patient’s report and include the biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL), and the humerus length (HL).\n\nThe ACUSON X300 PE – Women’s Imaging system also offers advanced fourSight volume imaging technology providing a complete 3D/4D solution. It delivers streamlined, intuitive workflow and advanced acquisition, data rendering and post-processing functionality for all examinations. In addition, the system offers syngo Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) for fetal echocardiography, a sophisticated 2D tracking algorithm which provides insight into fetal myocardial mechanics.\n\nTo complete the solution, the syngo fourSight ViewTool technology offers easy offline analysis, remote review, manipulation and storage of 3D/4D volumes, freeing the ultrasound system for additional patient exams.\n\nThe ACUSON X300 PE – Women’s Imaging features a suite of advanced imaging and transducer technologies to support breast, obstetrics and gynecological imaging. Key technologies include SieClear multi-view spatial compounding and Dynamic TCE tissue contrast enhancement technology for improved contrast resolution and border enhancement in subtle tissue textures such as the endometrium. Further image enhancement is achieved through TGO tissue grayscale optimization technology which provides one button optimization of B-mode images to shorten exam time, reduces repetitive motion and provides greater consistency between users.\n\nThe ErgoDynamic imaging system design of the ACUSON X300 PE — Women’s Imaging system includes a number of ergonomic features, including an adjustable control panel and articulating flat panel display, providing optimal positioning of the system in tight spaces. Its small, lightweight transducers offer advanced features such as Hanafy lens and MultiHertz multiple frequency imaging technologies, which provide excellent penetration with reduced scanning pressure. From a customizable patient entry screen to a 12-second system power-up for fast access, the system is engineered to easily address the day-to-day clinical challenges in Women’s Imaging. The ACUSON X300 PE — Women’s Imaging system is available as of July 1, 2009.\n\nFor more information: www.siemens.com/healthcare"
