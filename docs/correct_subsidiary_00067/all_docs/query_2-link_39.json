        "text": "The ACUSON P500 FROSK introduces two new premium technologies that continuously provide sharp ultrasound images, regardless of patient and probe motion:\n\nDynamic Persistence is associated with B-mode and Color. It prevents ghosting when probe or patient motion is detected, and enhances color sensitivity and\n\nreduces B-mode noise when no motion is detected\n\nPatent-pending Auto Flash Artifact Suppression ground-breaking technology detects and prevents motion artifacts associated with probe and patient movement, and enhances\n\ncolor imaging sensitivity when no motion detected\n\nHigh frequency imaging\n\nUp to 18.0 MHz bandwidth on linear transducers to provide detailed and precise imaging, especially in superficial investigations such as MSK application\n\nMultiple transmission frequency to scan deeper structures without changing probes TEI\n\nHarmonic imaging: dedicated hardware and software processing the second harmonic frequencies improving B-mode image quality, and diagnostic confidence in technically difficult patients\n\nAvailable on all imaging transducers\n\nThree selectable frequencies; General, Resolution, Penetration\n\nAvailable in combination with Color Doppler (C), M-mode, Power Doppler XView\n\nSpeckle reduction: elaborates pattern of single frame at the pixel level, eliminating speckle and noise artifacts, dynamically enhancing tissue margins, improving tissue conspicuity\n\nCustomizable presets (X Smooth, X Detail, X Enhancement) enable real-time optimization of the image process algorithm MView\n\nSpatial compounding: combined contributions of standard and steered ultrasound beams to optimize image quality and improve detection of anatomical structures\n\nUp to 15 angles of view within the same image TPView\n\nTrapezoid imaging: enlarged field of view on all linear probes, allowing scanning of extended structures without losing resolution\n\nSpecially suited for breast, vascular, musculoskeletal, and thyroid applications VPan\n\nPanoramic view: dedicated software merging multiple B-mode images into one panned image displayed on the screen in real-time; auto fit of composite, image zoom, merging level, frame marker, colorize, and distance measurement\n\nExtended f ield of view supports visualization of the entire organ. Areas of interest such as musculoskeletal and lesions associated with abdominal, breast and small parts can be more easily studied"
