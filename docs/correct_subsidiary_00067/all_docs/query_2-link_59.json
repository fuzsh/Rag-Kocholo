        "text": "The new ultrasound system offers efficient imaging on a premium level\n\nAt the 73rd Annual Conference of Indian Radiological & Imaging Association (IRIA) 2020, Gandhinagar, Siemens Healthineers launched the ACUSON Redwood Ultrasound System. The system is built on the company’s new platform architecture and features advanced applications for greater clinical confidence, AI-powered tools for smart workflows and has shared services cardiology features used by different hospital departments. These features, along with a portable and lightweight design, offer clinicians an affordable and efficient high-performing imaging solution.\n\n“We are seeing an increased demand for premium medical imaging services being driven by the growing healthcare needs of a population with varied requirements, particularly in regard to chronic diseases,” says Vivek Kanade, Executive Director, Siemens Healthineers India. We worked together with inputs from users to transform care delivery with the ACUSON Redwood and meet these challenges. This system is designed to deliver premium image quality, exceptional performance, and greater workflow efficiency.”\n\nThe ACUSON Redwood’s advanced applications, including Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and Shear wave Elastography, are available for the first time from the company in this segment and support precise lesion detection and characterization as well as potentially reduces the need for invasive procedures.\n\nA full portfolio of high-performance transducers including compact micro-pin less technology and single crystal transducers support superb image quality. With our coherent image formation (CIF) technology, the ACUSON Redwood maintains B-mode image quality performance even in complex modes and the system’s UltraArt Universal Image Processing provides several image choices right on the touch screen avoiding manual adjustment of multiple image parameters.\n\nWith a suite of AI-powered tools, the ACUSON Redwood delivers smart workflows for greater efficiency. Designed to go beyond the radiology department and bring precision imaging to more patients, lightweight and portable with 13 transducers, the ACUSON Redwood is easy to move and delivers premium imaging capabilities to the various clinical departments within an organization, such as radiology, cardiology and OB/Gyn.\n\nThe ACUSON Redwood is a comprehensive shared service cardiac solution. In this environment, it is crucial to address the needs of a broad range of cardiac assessments which is why the system includes applications such as syngo Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) technology, an advanced 2D quantitative tool for assessment of global and regional myocardial motion and mechanics, stress echo with a complete wall motion scoring analysis package and Left Ventricular Opacification (LVO) mode to enable cardiac contrast agent imaging."
