        "text": "With the Acuson X700 system, Siemens Healthcare has developed a powerful ultrasound system that offers exceptional image quality, robust technologies, and intelligent workflow\n\nsolutions at an excellent price/performance ratio. Many advanced imaging technologies that were previously available only on high-end, higher-cost systems are now standard on the Acuson X700 system.\n\nThe system also features workflow technologies that support high throughput and improve the total cost of ownership. The Acuson X700 system demonstrates Siemens’ competitiveness as part of the Sector initiative Agenda 2013 and will be introduced at the Medica 2012 in Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\nThe Acuson X700 system expands Siemens’ Acuson X family of ultrasound systems, which are\n\ndedicated to providing excellent performance and clinical efficiency across a range of clinical\n\nspecialties. Siemens migrated many of the technologies on the Acuson X700 system from its\n\nAcuson S family of premium ultrasound systems to enhance imaging performance.\n\nAdvanced SieClear spatial compounding, for example, enhances anatomic border definition and improves\n\ntissue contrast through electronic beam steering, allowing rapid acquisition of overlapping images\n\nfrom different view angles. The Dynamic TCE (tissue contrast enhancement) technology also\n\nimproves borders and reduces speckle/noise, facilitating subtle tissue differentiation. Moreover, the\n\nAcuson X700 system features intelligent workflow solutions to enable the high throughput required\n\nby various clinical departments that use the system.\n\nFor example, the TGO (tissue grayscale optimization) technology provides instantaneous one-button image optimization by automatically adjusting the image brightness to the tissue type being imaged.\n\nFurthermore, Siemens has migrated its patented MicroPinless (MP) transducer connectors from\n\npremium platforms to the Acuson X700 system. MP connectors offer the highest signal fidelity and\n\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio to enhance signal quality. The transducers are compatible with\n\nSiemens’ Acuson S Family, Acuson X Family, and Acuson Sequoia ultrasound systems to increase\n\nflexibility and investment value for the customer. The Acuson X700 system also features a new,\n\nsingle-solution, 50-millimeter aperture linear array transducer for superficial as well as deep imaging.\n\nThe proprietary Hanafy lens transducer technology provides continuous focusing and image\n\nuniformity while delivering superb contrast and detail resolution.\n\nThe Acuson X700 system offers many features and options to accommodate a broad range of\n\napplications and clinical environments. For instance, 3-Scape real-time 3D imaging and Advanced\n\nfourSight technology support 3D/4D imaging for fetal, abdominal, and gynecological examinations.\n\nMultiple knowledge-based workflow applications support the workflow to ensure consistency. The\n\nsoftware Syngo Auto OB Measurements, for example, draws on a large database of ultrasound\n\nimages to provide instant automated biometric measurements of the fetus without manual\n\ncalculations. Advanced cardiac imaging applications like intracardiac echocardiography imaging\n\nsupport physicians during procedure visualization and device placement monitoring. The system’s\n\noptions and features can be configured individually to support various clinical needs.\n\nMoreover, the Acuson X700 system features a new design for improved usability, including a 20-\n\ninch LED display. An integrated handle with articulating arm enables the user to easily position the\n\nmonitor for comfortable viewing. Two front-accessible USB ports allow easy, convenient data\n\ntransfer. The height-adjustable control panel swivels for maximum user comfort."
