        "text": "Kutay is Exoâ€™s Vice President of Imaging Systems and brings 30 years of experience in medical ultrasound imaging across every phase of R&D, strategy, roadmap and requirements, planning, integration, verification, and optimization of technologies, products and platforms. Earlier in his career at Acuson, Kutay led the ultrasound engineering team in charge of integration and clinical optimization of the Sequoia 512 ultrasound platform. After the successful introduction of Sequoia, he joined the Acuson Lab as a Research Fellow. There, he devised beam formation, image formation and image processing techniques to maximize information density and information rate, and to minimize acoustic clutter. When Siemens acquired Acuson in 2000, he joined the innovation team and continued research in core ultrasound technologies. Later, he managed the imaging systems team that developed the SC2000, a dedicated premium cardiology platform. Kutay is the inventor or co-inventor on more than 40 U.S. patents, many already implemented in commercial ultrasound systems. He earned his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Middle East Technical University in Turkey. Kutay was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to complete his graduate studies in the United States. He earned a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Irvine."
