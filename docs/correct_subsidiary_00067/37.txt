Siemens Healthineers has announced the launch of its new ultrasound system, the Acuson Sequoia. The new Acuson Sequoia, a general imaging ultrasound system, was developed to enable the imaging of different sized patients with consistency and clarity. The ultrasound systems powerful architecture and innovative features, according to the company, enhances precision medicine by enabling high-resolution imaging that adapts to patients’ size and personal characteristics, contributing to more confident diagnosis.

“Ultrasound imaging has been plagued by variability. Patients’ varied physical characteristics and user-dependent variabilities can impact a clinician’s ability to deliver an accurate diagnosis,” says Robert Thompson, head of utrasound at Siemens Healthineers. “With the new Acuson Sequoia, Siemens Healthineers provides users with a solution that enables real-time imaging for varying patient types, including those with high BMI, without sacrificing image quality and potentially reducing the need for repeat scans and unclear diagnoses.”

According to the World Health Organization, 1.9 billion people globally are reported as overweight with 650 million people classified as obese (with a BMI above 30). Because ultrasound imaging relies on the sending and receiving of echo signals to produce images, patients with more adipose tissue are more difficult to image. The deeper an echo signal needs to penetrate, the more attenuation occurs, resulting in image quality degradation. In attempting to overcome these challenges, clinicians have traditionally had to compromise on frame rates, resolution, or penetration of their ultrasound imaging.

In response, Siemens Healthineers built the entirely new Acuson Sequoia system to adapt to the “BioAcoustic Variations” of each patient, characteristics that include tissue density, stiffness, and absorption. The new Acuson Sequoia provides high-resolution InFocus imaging throughout the entire field of view, from the near field to the far field, in real-time. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the focal point of the scan, resulting in faster scan time without compromising frame rates and resolution. The new ultrasound system also offers high-resolution color flow, up to three times the sensitivity, and up to 20% deeper penetration.
