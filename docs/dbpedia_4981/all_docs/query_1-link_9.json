        "text": "‚úçÔ∏è\n\nThis article is updated in June 2024 to reflect the latest information.\n\nThis article reviews 5 eSIM services, carefully selected after extensive research, as the best prepaid options for staying connected during a trip to Hong Kong. Besides comparing plans and pricing, I personally tested multiple eSIMs on-site to evaluate their real-world performance.\n\nWhether you're traveling for leisure or business, this post should provide some useful insights if you're considering using an eSIM for internet access in Hong Kong (which I highly recommend!).\n\nBefore getting into the main topic, please note that there are many other prepaid eSIMs available for Hong Kong beyond the ones introduced here. So be sure to check out esimdb.com, the world's largest travel eSIM database, to explore and compare various options before making your final selection.\n\n*As an iPhone user, all my tests were conducted using an iPhone.\n\nMobile Carriers in Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong has several major mobile carriers such as China Mobile Hong Kong (CMHK), 3HK, SmarTone, and PCCW (including HKT & CSL). However, given the country's compact size, there isn't a huge difference in their coverage areas as far as I looked up.\n\nJust to be sure, I asked Perplexity (a large language model / AI similar to ChatGPT that can answer questions based on web information), and it provided a similar response.\n\nWhile it's best not to rely too heavily on data from Statista (in my own experience), sources like nPerf also indicate that there shouldn't be major issues with signal coverage on any network. While we can't speak for 5G in rural areas, 4G coverage should not be a problem regardless of which network you are connected to.\n\n(Note that this refers to the areas where signals are available. Actual network speeds are a different story...)\n\nOk, now on to the actual travel eSIM reviews üëâ\n\nAiralo\n\nArguably the most well-known travel eSIM service, Airalo offers best-in-class user experience with a wide range of data plans for various parts of the world.\n\nFor those who haven't used it yet, a comprehensive guide from purchasing to installing their eSIM, as well as how to use the 10% discount promo code \"ESIMDB10\", can be found in the article linked below.\n\nTheir eSIM can be installed directly from the app without a QR code, making it easy for people trying out a travel eSIM for the first time.\n\nAiralo's Hong Kong Data Plans\n\nWhile Airalo may have lost some of its price competitiveness in recent years, it still offers reasonably good value for Hong Kong in my opinion.\n\n*The following information is as of June 2024. Please check Airalo's official website for the latest information.\n\nAiralo's \"Hkmobile\" eSIM for Hong Kong comes in five plans. (Previously, there were four, but 2GB plan has been added.)\n\nData Validity Price Price/GB 1GB 7 Days $4.5 $4.5 2GB 15 Days $7 $3.5 3GB 30 Days $8.5 $2.83 5GB 30 Days $12 $2.4 10GB 30 Days $19 $1.9\n\nFor a short trip or business stay, the 5GB plan is likely a good sweet spot for most users' data needs. It only costs $10.80 with the 10% discount code, which isn't too pricey.\n\nHeavy data users or those staying multiple weeks may want to consider the 10GB option for extra peace of mind. At $17.10 with the discount, it works out to well under $2 per GB.\n\n*For the Hkmobile plans, the validity period starts as soon as you first connect to the network in Hong Kong.\n\nSpeeds & Performance in Hong Kong\n\n*Tested in: June 2024\n\n*Device Used: iPhone 15 Pro\n\nAfter arriving at Hong Kong International Airport, I enabled Data Roaming for the Airalo eSIM and set it for Cellular Data, and was able to connect to the internet almost immediately.\n\nIt connected to CSL 4G network.\n\nAlthough I didn't have time to visit outlying islands this time, the coverage from the airport to and within the city (including Kowloon and Hong Kong Island) was great, with no instances of losing signal even in the subway.\n\nNetwork Speed\n\nBelow are the speed test results for Airalo's eSIM in Hong Kong. The areas tested, from left to right, are Hong Kong International Airport, around Mong Kok, and around Central (in Hong Kong island).\n\nDownload speeds varied quite a lot, from tens to hundreds of Mbps, but it was mostly quite satisfactory. Upload speeds were relatively slower, about 5 - 30 Mbps, but considering that normal internet usage during travel primarily involves downloading, this shouldn't be much of an issue. (At least it was not in my case.)\n\nIt appears that this eSIM uses Singtel's roaming network via Singapore, with Ping of around 70 milliseconds. This latency level is actually better than average for a roaming network.\n\nAs far as my personal opinion goes, I found the connection \"reasonably satisfying\". The latency = response time wasn't too bad, the speed was decent, and I didn't encounter any major issues or downtime.\n\nTethering (Personal Hotspot) also works which is a plus.\n\nChecking Data Balance\n\nYou can check your data usage / balance, and buy additional data if needed through the Airalo mobile app (iOS, Android).\n\nThere are cheaper eSIMs out there but some of them don't come with a dedicated app. Keeping this in mind when choosing an eSIM may be helpful.\n\nSummary for Airalo eSIM\n\n‚úÖ User-friendly website and app interface, easy to buy and install eSIMs\n\n‚úÖ Fairly reasonable pricing for their 5 Hkmobile plans, plus 10% off with \"ESIMDB10\" code to make them even cheaper\n\n‚úÖ Connects to CSL's 4G network with satisfactory overall connectivity performance (for my needs)\n\nNomad\n\nNomad is another travel eSIM startup offering wallet-friendly pricing and a vast collection of plans covering 100+ destinations.\n\nOver the past year or so, they've released an Android app and increased their data plan offering quite significantly, making them one of the most evolving travel eSIM services out there.\n\nIf you haven't used Nomad eSIM yet, please refer to the article below for a detailed guide on purchasing and installing their eSIM (with screenshot images).\n\nAlso, don't forget to use the $3 discount code \"ESIMDB3\" if you decide to go with Nomad.\n\nNomad's eSIM Plans for Hong Kong\n\n*The following information is accurate as of the time of writing. Please check Nomad's official website for the most up-to-date information.\n\nNomad offers 6 data plans for Hong Kong.\n\nData Validity Price Price/GB 1GB 7 Days $4 $4 3GB 30 Days $9 $3 5GB 30 Days $12 $2.4 10GB 30 Days $18 $1.8 15GB 30 Days $20 $1.33 20GB 45 Days $25 $1.25\n\nFor plans with 10GB or more, the cost per GB drops below $2, making them very cost-effective. And using the \"ESIMDB3\" promo code saves you another $3 off, making them even better value.\n\nThe 3GB plan and below are a bit pricier, so I'd recommend opting for plans with 5GB or more.\n\nNetwork Quality\n\n*Tested in: April 2023\n\nWith Nomad, be sure to activate your data plan ahead of arriving in Hong Kong (you can do this e.g. a day before your departure). Without activating, the eSIM won't work.\n\nJust hit \"Activate Data Now\" on Nomad's website or app, that's all it takes. The plan validity period starts from this activation time.\n\nOnce activated and landed in Hong Kong, the steps are the same as Airalo eSIM:\n\nEnable Data Roaming\n\nSet it for Cellular Data\n\nThat's it.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Nomad's eSIM connected to CSL LTE.\n\nAlthough there is a slight difference of LTE vs 4G, Nomad eSIM uses the same CSL network as Airalo's, so the coverage and reception was perfectly fine. No congestion problems in crowded areas either.\n\nSpeeds\n\nBelow are the speed test results for Nomad eSIM connected to CSL. From left to right, the locations are Hong Kong International Airport, Mong Kok, and Central.\n\nBoth download and upload speeds are stable, although they're generally on the slower side. Still, perfectly usable for my internet use during my travel, such as Google Maps, Uber, social media, browsing, etc.\n\nThis eSIM gets a Hong Kong IP address, with a good Ping of around 40 milliseconds (IPS is PCCW Global).\n\nIn summary, compared to Airalo, Nomad has slightly slower speeds but better ping. In practice, there wasn't a significant difference between the two.\n\nTethering (Personal Hotspot) is also supported.\n\nManaging eSIM with Nomad App\n\nYou can check your real-time data usage and plan validity on Nomad's official web or mobile app. You can also purchase additional data plans when needed (for the same price as the original plans).\n\nTheir app is well-crafted and easy to use.\n\nSummary of Nomad's Hong Kong eSIM\n\n‚úÖ Excellent value especially on 5GB+ plans, plus $3 off with \"ESIMDB3\" code\n\n‚úÖ Connects to CSL's network, with decent speeds and good latency\n\n‚úÖ Polished, user-friendly design across website and mobile app\n\nMobiMatter (3HK eSIM)\n\nMobiMatter is an e-commerce wesite offering various affordable travel eSIM packages. Although the selection occasionally changes, it is one of the best sites for finding low-cost prepaid eSIMs.\n\nThe 3HK eSIM available on their website comes with a Hong Kong phone number and free calls, making it unique and useful. However, it requires ID verification (eKYC) before use, which might make it more suitable for experienced users.\n\n*3HK (or 3 Hong Kong) is a telecom carrier in Hong Kong operating under the \"3\" brand by Hutchison.\n\nFor detailed instructions on purchasing an eSIM from MobiMatter, please refer to the dedicated article below.\n\n3HK eSIMs from MobiMatter\n\n*Information as of June 2024.\n\nThe MobiMatter's Hong Kong eSIM page shows a list of eSIMs available for use in Hong Kong.\n\nSince there are many types of eSIMs listed, including those usable in multiple countries, it might be easier to check them on eSIMDB Hong Kong > MobiMatter page.\n\nAmong these eSIMs, the ones specifically for Hong Kong are as follows:\n\n2GB / 30 days: $7.99 (includes 1000 minutes of free calls)\n\n12GB / 30 days: $15.99 (includes 2000 minutes of free calls)\n\n120GB / 365 days: $43.99 (includes 10,000 minutes of free calls)\n\nAll of these are provided by 3HK and come with a +852 phone number.\n\nIn terms of value for money, the 12GB and 120GB plans are the obvious winners. But unless you're a frequent Hong Kong visitor, 120GB is likely overkill, so the 12GB option is probably the ideal pick for most.\n\nThe 12GB plan is priced at $15.99, but you can get an additional 3% discount by registering an account on MobiMatter, making it even cheaper.\n\nA few other key points about these 3HK eSIMs:\n\neKYC (ID registration) is required through 3's official site (*more on this later)\n\nMust be activated within 6 months from purchase\n\nValidity period starts when you install the eSIM\n\nTethering / Personal Hotspot supported\n\nüí°\n\nMobiMatter also offers tourist eSIMs for Hong Kong, China, and Macau. Those could be good options if you'll be visiting Macau or mainland cities like Shenzhen too.\n\nReal-name Registration for 3HK eSIM\n\nSince 3HK eSIMs come with a local Hong Kong phone number, online identity verification (eKYC) called Real-name Registration is required under the law.\n\nThe steps are outlined in the email from MobiMatter, but here‚Äôs a simple breakdown:\n\nAfter arriving in Hong Kong, enable your 3HK eSIM and set it for Cellular Data, then access the registration webpage (https://www.three.com.hk/prepaid/account/en/rnr-reg)\n\nThe eSIM phone number or ICCID (identification number) will be automatically read / entered (if not, manually check and copy the number from the device settings)\n\nScan your passport and upload it\n\nDone\n\nThe Registration Steps\n\nWhen using the 3HK eSIM to access the 3HK registration page, you will first see a screen asking for your email address. Enter your email address, and tap Next. On the following page, your eSIM phone number should be automatically detected, allowing you to proceed (log in).\n\n*At this stage, access to websites other than the 3HK page is restricted, so you cannot browse other webpages or use apps.\n\nIf You Cannot Access the Registration Page\n\n‚úèÔ∏è\n\nIf you cannot access the registration page via mobile data, connect to WiFi and manually copy and paste the ICCID. It‚Äôs quite a hassle but yo won't have any other choice.\n\n(On an iPhone, you can find the ICCID in Settings > General > About.)\n\nAccess the registration URL from a phone connected to WiFi. You will see a screen to choose between mobile number or ICCID login. For mobile number, enter the 8-digit number without the +852 prefix. For ICCID, copy and paste the full number. When successful, you wil receive an OTP (one-time password) via SMS to log in.\n\nUpload Passport Photo\n\nAfter logging in, you'll be asked to choose between Individual user or Organization user. Select Individual user, then scan your passport, verify the information, and press Confirm to complete the registration.\n\nThe verification process is automated, and once completed, you will immediately receive an SMS confirming the registration. You can then use your eSIM normally without any restrictions.\n\nAlthough the process is a bit cumbersome, it should not take more than a couple of minutes, and your eSIM will be activated right away.\n\nIt would be ideal if you could complete the whole registration process before going to Hong Kong, but currently it's only possible to do it in Hong Kong (physically).\n\nNetwork Quality of 3HK eSIM\n\n*Tested in: June 2024\n\n*Tested device: iPhone 15 Pro\n\nIn Hong Kong, the connection was mostly LTE, with occasional 5G coverage if I recall correctly.\n\nThe signal was strong and reliable in the airport, Kowloon Peninsula, and Hong Kong Island.\n\nInternet Speeds\n\nHere are the speed test results for the 3HK eSIM. From left to right, the locations are Kowloon Bay area, Mong Kok area, and Central area.\n\nSince it's not a roaming connection, Ping is around 20 ms which is great. The download speeds are also satisfactory.\n\nThis level of connectivity should be more than sufficient for normal internet use during travel.\n\nYou can check your remaining data balance by logging into MobiMatter's official website or mobile app.\n\n3HK eSIM (sold by MobiMatter) Rundown\n\n‚úÖ Unbeatable value as a local eSIM from a local Hong Kong network operator \"3\"\n\n‚úÖ The user registration process is, I have to say, cumbersome but can be completed online and fairly straightforward\n\n‚úÖ Low latency and satisfactory speeds for travelers\n\nOther Contenders\n\nWhile I haven't tested these myself in Hong Kong, here are some other prepaid eSIMs that are worth considering.\n\neSIMX\n\neSIMX, a newcomer in the travel eSIM market, has gained popularity lately mostly due to its aggressively low pricing and easy purchasing process.\n\neSIMX Hong Kong eSIM Plans\n\n*Pricing as of June 2024\n\neSIMX's Hong Kong eSIM comes in 9 options.\n\nData Validity Price Price/GB 1GB 7 Days $4.5 $4.5 3GB 30 Days $8 $2.67 5GB 30 Days $11 $2.2 10GB 7 Days $13.5 $1.35 10GB 15 Days $16 $1.6 10GB 30 Days $18 $1.8 20GB 7 Days $21 $1.05 20GB 15 Days $23 $1.15 20GB 30 Days $24.5 $1.23\n\nAs you can see in the Price/GB column in the table ablove, their plans are all extremely affordable, particularly the 10GB and 20GB options. The 10GB for 7 Days plan is just $13.50, or around $12 with the discount code applied.\n\nPlus, their website is super easy to use for browsing and buying.\"\n\nGlobaleSIM\n\nGlobaleSIM is another budget-friendly eSIM provider on par with, or sometimes even cheaper than eSIMX for certain destinations. They've been providing services for quite some time, making it a reliable and legit player in the market.\n\nHowever, sometimes their official website can be a bit slow to load.\n\nHong Kong Plan & Pricing\n\nGlobaleSIM currently offers 7 data plans for Hong Kong.\n\nData Validity Price Price/GB 1GB 7 Days $4 $4 2GB 15 Days $5 $2.5 3GB 30 Days $7 $2.33 5GB 30 Days $10 $2 10GB 30 Days $12 $1.2 20GB 30 Days $22 $1.1 50GB 30 Days $44 $0.88\n\nTypically, smaller data plans (1GB - 3GB) are more expensive, but GlobaleSIM offers relatively fair prices even for low data plans. For plans of 5GB or more, the cost per GB drops below $2, and it becomes even cheaper for plans over 10GB of data.\n\nWhile the website usability isn‚Äôt the best compared to other eSIM services mentioned in this article, GlobaleSIM's value proposition makes it worth including in your eSIM research for Hong Kong.\n\nTravel eSIMs Are Convenient\n\nPrices for typical Hong Kong tourist SIM cards usually fall between $10 and $20, depending on the data capacity. As you've seen from this article, there are multiple legit eSIM options for Hong Kong travelers offering similar data allowances and pricing as physical SIM cards.\n\nStrictly evaluating just cost-per-GB, physical SIM cards may still edge out eSIMs in some cases. However, the convenience of not having to swap SIM cards and avoiding the risk of losing a physical SIM makes eSIMs a very viable alternative when it comes traveling in my opinion.\n\nWhen you are considering eSIM for your trip, not just to Hong Kong but in general, be sure to compare various options on esimdb.com üëá\n\nSafe travels!"
