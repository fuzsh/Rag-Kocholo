        "text": "“Where to buy Apple products” is a question on many visitors’ mind when visiting Hong Kong. No only because Hong Kong is aways among the cities getting the latest models first, but also because Hong Kong has no sales tax (duty free). The price of Apple products is relatively cheaper in Hong Kong.\n\nNo matter where you are in the world Apple products are always hot items. With every new release of the iPhone, iPad, iPad Air or iPad Mini people queue up days in advance to be first one to own the latest edition resulting not only in endless lines, but sometimes even in quarrels and fights.\n\nHong Kong is crazy for Apple products, especially iPhone\n\nKnowing about how popular Apple products are helps you understand the market of Apple in Hong Kong. Hong Kong people are very trendy when it comes to technology and Apple products. The density of iPhone and iPad users in Hong Kong seems to be extremely high compared to other metropolitan cities and countries. When you take the MTR, it seems that almost every single Hong Kong person owns one of Apple products. When Apple releases new products people get crazy like everywhere else in the world.\n\nIt gives Hong Kong the convenience to purchase IT items as well as Apple products. Hundreds of electronic shops are throughout everywhere in Hong Kong.\n\nGo Back to Top\n\nHow to buy Apple products in Hong Kong?\n\nThe official prices of Apple products in Hong Kong are relatively lower than many countries as well as Mainland China. It makes Hong Kong an attractive place to purchase Apple products. However, not every product is immediately available or easily accessible on the market.\n\nDue to Apple’s strategy only to release a limited number of the new products at the launch, the Apple Online store usually sold out its latest releases literally within seconds or minutes in Hong Kong in the past. Even if you were opting to buy Apple products from Apple Hong Kong’s website, you were required to provide a Hong Kong address or personal identity. Trying to buy the latest iPhone or iPad equals was like playing a lottery.\n\nThe situation changed since iPhone 7 that fans didn’t need to stand in line overnight fighting for the latest products. However, the popular color and capacity is still very difficult to get on the launch day, even for iPhone 13.\n\nSpecial policy for iPhone and iPad in official Apple Stores in the past\n\nStarting from New iPad in 2012, official Apple Store stopped selling newly launched products to walk-in customers to prevent unauthorized resellers. Apple introduced “a lottery system” when iPhone 5 was released. Similar things happened when the iPhone 5s was release in 2013.\n\nWhen iPhone 6 was launched, Apple launched online store for reservation 8:00 am everyday and it was sold out within seconds. Many professional re-sellers used programmed codes and bots to beat normal customers. iPhone 6’s market price reached to HK$15,000 for the 16gb version (official price was around HK$ 5,588). For over a month, it was impossible to get iPhone 6 with a reasonable price.\n\nGo Back to Top\n\nAre there cheaper prices for Apple products?\n\nI often get the question if there are any places that sell Apple products cheaper than the official Apple store. Usually, you will have a very hard time finding Apple products at a cheaper price. If you really find them, you should be very alerted that these might be either parallel imports (without warranty and/or SIM-locked) and/or are counterfeits/fake.\n\nAs Hong Kong is crazy for Apple products that Apple products are too popular that will easily be out of stock. Having said this, there is always the option to ask for a discount if you pay cash. Especially small stores happily accept cash and will give you either some additional goodies or gadgets (such as webcam, mouse, USB keys, bag, etc.) or depending on the product you buy a cash discount (this can be up to HK$ 500 for a MacBook Pro).\n\nGo Back to Top\n\nWhere to buy Apple products in Hong Kong?\n\nThere are plenty of alternatives to buy Apple products such as e.g. the latest iPhone, iPhone Pro, iPhone SE, iPad Air, iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Mini with Retina Display, iPad Pro, iMac, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, MacBook, MacBook Pro with Retina Display, MacBook Air and/or Apple accessories in Hong Kong ranging from the official Apple stores, big electronic chain stores to authorized dealers and reliable small shops and importers.\n\nBefore you decide where to purchase, make sure you understand the following four terms first. There are four kinds of stores selling Apple products: Official Apple Store, Apple Shop, Apple Authorized Reseller and Apple Premium Reseller. Purchasing from these sources are safe and usually with same warranty included.\n\n– Official Apple Store: Hong Kong has 6 official Apple Stores : Central and Causeway Bay (Hong Kong Island), Festival Walk and Canton Road (Kowloon), New Town Plaza as well as Kwun Tong (New Territories).\n\n– Apple Shop: There are several shops in Hong Kong designed by Apple and located within selected Apple resellers and other retail shops. These retail shops also carry multi-brand electronics. You are able to spot the large backlit Apple logo of the Apple shop (sometimes looks like a counter). You also will find Apple-trained experts giving you suggestions and help. In Hong Kong, these shops are located in chain stores such as Broadway, Fortress as well as Suning Citicall.\n\n– Apple Authorized Reseller: Hong Kong has plenty of Authorized Resellers, which are official dealers where you can get formal warranty from the Apple company.\n\n– Apple Premium Reseller: Among the authorized resellers, some have been recognized by Apple for providing superior customer service with a focus on Apple solutions, service and support.\n\nThe official Apple Stores\n\nAuthorized Dealers and Resellers\n\nBefore Apple launched its flagship store in the IFC Mall, Apple products were (and still are) officially sold through Authorized Dealers and Reseller including electronic chain stores such as Broadway, Fortress or Suning. In the following we would like to introduce the main key players.\n\nPurchasing from authorized resellers can enjoy the same warranty from Apple. Usually authorized resellers offer the same prices with Apple official store. However, sometimes discounts will be applied to the displayed items.\n\nBuy From Other Ways\n\nBesides the above official Apple Stores and Apple authorized resellers, there are also other possibilities to purchase Apple products.\n\nDue to Hong Kong’s density it seems for outsiders that Hong Kong is “Apple Land”. Certainly, Hong Kong has a very high number of Authorized Apple Resellers, but it can be quite tough to hunt down the latest releases of the iPhone or iPads due to its popularity. As mentioned above, usually when the latest iPhone hits the (online) store it is sold out within seconds. Other products such as the MacBook or MacBook Air are commonly available.\n\nGo Back to Top\n\nWhere is the best place to buy Apple products in Hong Kong?\n\nFor convenience, we would recommend shopping in Mongkok or in Causeway Bay (especially if you are pressed for time). Especially in Causeway Bay, there are at least 4 or 5 of the above mentioned authorized dealers within walking distance (not including Fortress and Broadway stores). In case some items are sold out, you easily can walk to the next authorized shop and if this is not enough just stroll in at Fortress, Broadway or Suning as well as official Apple Store. Plus you have several shopping malls in close proximity. If this is not enough, Wan Chai and Central are just a few minutes away by MTR.\n\nThe other location we can recommend is Mongkok. The strength of Mongkok is the Sai Yeung Choi Street or better known as the Electronics Street. Basically, you just need to stroll along this street. There are numerous Fortress, Broadway and other electronic stores. Plus you have the Mongkok Computer Centre in close distance. And if this is not enough for you than you could have a look and try the luxury shopping mall of Langham Place."
