        "text": "Competition for new mobile subscribers is almost entirely at the cheap end of the market. That means owning a PCS network, where monthly tariffs have fallen as low as $68.\n\nThere are now only three big players. The difference is that Hongkong Telecom and Hutchison Telecommunications have three networks each, allowing services and tariffs to be differentiated.\n\nSmarTone has reportedly seen monthly subscriber growth slow to just a few thousand since August. Its response has been to slash air-time charges by 28 per cent.\n\nInvestors, having seen the network move up market over the past year, were confused, leading to this week's 10 per cent share-price decline.\n\nAfter phenomenal growth, the arrival of PCS was always going to hit Hong Kong's only pure mobile play hard. The double whammy was that it moved so quickly to slash prices, reducing monthly revenues from its 410,000 or so subscribers.\n\nSmarTone is now between $100 and $300 cheaper than the GSM (global systems for mobile telecoms) services of Hutchison and Hongkong Telcom.\n\nBoth are happy to make hay while the sun shines on GSM and chase new users through their other networks - Hutchison with code division multiple access and PCS; Hongkong Telecom using Pacific Link's established D-amps network and the marketing creation, One2Free.\n\nThey are betting on the apathy of high-end consumers happy to pay more rather than endure the hassle of changing networks and phone numbers. The price gap between competing services cannot last, but SmarTone was forced to cut first.\n\nWhile strong subscriber growth figures during the first half guarantees this year's earnings, 1998 is a different story. The obvious solution is to follow Hongkong Telecom and buy a PCS network.\n\nSmarTone has apparently held back in the belief that the asking price must fall as competition intensifies. Of the six PCS operators, only two seem likely to sell. Mandarin and P-plus are both thought to be taking offers, with Mandarin reportedly asking as much as $4 billion.\n\nThat seems way over the mark, considering Hongkong Telecom paid $4.8 billion for Pacific Link's PCS network plus its D-amps service with 275,000 subscribers.\n\nIt is far from clear who has the stronger negotiating hand. With only one likely buyer and two, possibly three, sellers, the odds seem to favour SmarTone. But, as networks are built out and capital expenditure mounts, the price is likely to rise.\n\nWhile the present strategy means Hutchison and Hongkong Telecom GSM customers will probably migrate its way, new users will choose cheaper PCS operators.\n\nInvestors want to see a clear strategy to deal with the new environment. So far that has not been evident.\n\nWithin three years, a handful of firms conceivably may offer a single PCS-GSM network for a flat charge. Before then, brutal competition will see a deeply fragmented market. Operators will chase subscribers in the expanding mass market and try to retain high-paying GSM customers.\n\nBeing caught in between is a predicament likely to confuse consumers and investors. SmarTone defied market expectations with extremely intelligent marketing over the past year. Now, the only option seems to be a PCS network. The question is who, when and how much?"
