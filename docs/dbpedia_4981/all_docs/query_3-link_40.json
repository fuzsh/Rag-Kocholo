Then again, we knew that the neople we wanted to suit were a wild- y diverse, independent lot: Mac users. So it made sense to let them tell us exactly what to put into Word. Which they did. First, there were some folks who didn’t like tabbing much. Fair enough. For them, we developed Ta¬ bles— an easier way to set up side-by- side paragraphs, columns of numbers, even forms. No tabs. No hassle. Then we heard from a few more people. “Love the Tables gig,” they said. “Now, about this text-numbers-graph- ics combo all in one document ...” We made that simple with “warm links.” Once you’ve linked Microsoft Excel data to a document, keeping that document updated with the lat¬ est Microsoft Excel figures is easy Just click your mouse. Then there were those senders of mail, who didn’t want to click-click- click-click-click-click So we built support for Microsoft Mail right into Word. Now, with just a click, everyone stays in the loop. And work in progress stays in progress. As it happens, listening to what Mac users want is a pretty good way to design software. How else can we explain Word version 4.0 being the most popular word processor in Mac history? And those cards and letters are still coming “Listen’,’ someone’ll say “In case youre working on the next Word ...” Which we are. In fact, if you’ve got some input for us, feel free to drop us a line. Or if you’d like to find out more about Word, call us at (800) 541- 1261, Department N24. Our goal is still simple: to make Word the best word processor around. With the latest technology— translated into human terms, of course. After all, we’re only making his¬ tory because we make word processor the way you like ’em. m Making it all make s Send those cards and letters to: Microsoft Word for Macintosh Development Team, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399.

The backlit Portable will replace the existing version, will cost about $1800 less, and will be able to ad¬ dress 8MB of RAM and work with third-party RAM boards. A model with 2MB of RAM and an internal 40MB hard drive will list for $4199, while a model with 4MB of RAM and the same hard drive will list for $46 99. Apple will charge owners of the original Mac Portable about $1050 to add the backlighting feature to their machines if they choose to upgrade. Mo Market for Lotus Marketplace Saying that Lotus Marketplace is “at the apex of an emotional fire storm of public concern about con¬ sumer privacy,” Lotus president Jim Manzi an¬ nounced plans to cancel publication of CD ROMs containing marketing information about 120 mil¬ lion U.S. consumers, and to discontinue a similar database of marketing information about 7 million U.S. businesses. The Marketplace information was to be supplied by Equifax and TRWJ two large credit bureaus that compile and sell information on businesses and consumers to private companies. Apple Seeks FCC Approval for Radio Networks Apple has filed a petition with the Federal Com¬ munications Commission asking it to allocate a part of the radio spectrum for high-speed computer communications. If this is approved, Macs could soon be using radio waves — instead of wire-based networks — to communicate. Radius, Fusion Introduce 68040-Based Accelerators With Motorola finally shipping production quanti¬ ties of its 68040 microprocessors, several vendors have announced accelerators using the new chip. Radius recently demonstrated a prototype 68040 accelerator for NuBus Macs and said it expects to announce a final version in the first quarter of 1991. The accelerator is designed to work with Radius’s line of graphics products, integrating with its ex¬ isting calibration, compression, and image-capture offerings. The price, ship date, and name of the product were not set at press time. Also, Fusion Data Systems announced the TokaMac LC, a 68040 accelerator that fits in the Processor Direct Slot of the Macintosh LC. Fusion is planning versions for the Ilsi, the Ilci, and the SE/30. The TokaMac LC lists for $2995 and was slated to ship in late Febru¬ ary. For more information, contact Radius at 408/ 434-1010, or Fusion’s distributor, Quantum Leap Systems, at 619/457-0781. At the ACIUS Supermarket ACIUS has grown from a one-product shop to one- stop shopping. Hard on the heels of 4DWrite, 4DCalc, and other 4th Dimension add-ons, ACIUS has announced a database server that it claims runs 30 to 100 times faster than multiuser 4D. Several people can modify a database structure simulta¬ neously, even while clients are changing the database’s contents. 4D Server has features com¬ mon on minicomputers, such as priority levels for clients. ACIUS is also developing a tool kit for us¬ ing MacroMind Director, RadiusTy Bright Star’s InterFACE, and several other multimedia products inside 4D, and externals to communicate with Northern Telecom digital telephone switches. Pric¬ ing was not set at press time. For more informa¬ tion, contact ACIUS at 408/252-4444. The Color of Control Astral Development’s first Mac product, the gray¬ scale image editing package Picture Publisher, em¬ phasizes scanner and output-device calibration, even providing calibrator strips to scan in and out¬ put files to test with a densitometer. Astral’s next product for the Mac, Picture Publisher Plus, is a color photo-editing package that will support color separation, blends, color masking, transparency, and other features appropriate for 32-bit color. It will provide tools for calibrating color scanners, and controls for four-color printing, including un¬ dercover removal, gray-component boost, and dot- gain and ink-contamination settings. Picture Publisher lists for $295, and Plus will list for $695 or $795. Astral Development is at 603/432-6800. Oracle Does Buttons Oracle has licensed the HyperCard work-alike Plus from Spinnaker Software to incorporate in Oracle Card, a point-and-click application-development system and front end to Oracle servers. Oracle Card will support standard Plus features such as color picture fields, buttons that trigger scripts, and (continues) MACWORLD • APRIL 1991 17 MAC BULLETIN XCMDs. Macintosh and Windows versions, which can share Oracle Card applications, will list for $299 (documentation for programmers will cost extra); Oracle plans to develop a similar product for OS/ 2, OpenLook, Motif, and Nextstep. For more infor¬ mation, call Oracle at 415/506-7000. New Master for the Finder Tactic Software is launching its first home-grown product, MasterFinder, which combines most fea¬ tures of DiskTop, On Cue, and HandOff. It can search for files by name, type and creator, and so on, and you can batch-catalog volumes and search them when they are offline. It can show four open vol¬ umes or folders in side-by-side scrolling windows, so you can move files around easily, and it can show an outline of all nodes on a network, even across bridges. You can assign frequently used folders or files to a launch menu, and specify an application to open files that were created by an application you don’t have. MasterFinder comes in both DA and application form and lists for $99. For more information, contact Tactic at 305/378-4110. New Vitamins for Virex Virex 3.0 users can key in codes supplied by Micro- corn each time a new virus is discovered, to update the utility’s detection capability. With previous versions you had to wait for Microcom to ship an update. Version 3.0’s INIT can now repair as well as detect virus-affected files, and the new version can batch-search folders and ignore nonexecutable files. Virex 3 0 lists for $99 95. For more informa¬ tion, contact Microcom at 919/490-1277. Worlds of Information Educational software developer PC Globe is pre¬ paring Mac USA, a collection of demographic, eco¬ nomic, and many other kinds of information about the United States that does simple thematic map¬ ping and bar charting. For example, you could chart average income in all the major cities in Texas, or create a colored map showing percent of voter turnout in the last election. Mac USA will list for $69. Future products will have data and maps for the whole world and provide a way to add your own data to the database. For more information, contact PC Globe at 602/730-9000. Reset Preferences Preferred Software appears to be emerging from its time of trouble, after passing through two man¬ agement purges. Preferred still publishes DAtabase, Vantage, Exposure (now Exposure Pro), and sev¬ eral other products, and is working on new prod¬ ucts. FlashCrypt is intended to be a convenient, high-speed encryption tool. DoubleTalk is a full- featured telecommunications program with a scripting language. DoubleTalk can be used to build a BBS, can be driven from inside HyperCard, and has a proprietary Zmodem protocol that Preferred claims is faster than standard Zmodem. Later, DoubleTalk will have a run-time and a Windows version, and support modemless communications over Ethernet (and maybe AppleTalk); the modemless version could be a platform to build an electronic-mail package on. DoubleTalk 1.1 is shipping now at $149. 95 ($249.95 for two copies). Pricing and ship dates for FlashCrypt and later ver¬ sions of DoubleTalk have not been set. For more information, call Preferred at 901/683-3383. 16-ppm Kodak Printer Is Also a Copier Eastman Kodak has begun shipping the Ektaplus 7016PS, a network printer that produces 16 pages per minute and can double as a 6-ppm convenience copier. The printer can also connect to as many as four networks. The Ektaplus 7016PS comes with one serial and one parallel port but can be up¬ graded to four ports, including a LocalTalk con¬ nector. It comes with a PostScript controller with 4MB of RAM and also includes IBM Proprinter, HP- PCL, HPGL, and Epson and Diablo printer emula¬ tions. The Ektaplus 7016PS lists for $6995. For more information, contact Kodak at 800/344-0006. NEC Ships Monitor with Reduced Magnetic Fields NEC Technologies is offering a 1 4-inch color moni¬ tor designed to reduce the emission of possibly hazardous VLF and ELF magnetic fields. The NEC MultiSync 3DS works with a wide variety of per¬ sonal computers, including the Mac II series. The monitor’s design includes extra shielding, a can¬ cellation yoke, and grounding wires to reduce the magnetic fields. Its suggested retail price is $1099. For more information, call NEC at 708/860-9500. The Virtual Vise SuperDisk, from new kid on the block Alysis, auto¬ matically compresses files every time you save to fit more files on a hard disk with no loss of data. SuperDisk is an INIT-cdev combo that compresses any file or the contents of any folder or volume that has .s following the name, and it has optional password-protection as well. Alysis claims that SuperDisk will run about four to five times faster than DiskDoubler, and about as fast as hardware- based DoubleUp. SuperDisk will list for $89. For more information, contact Alysis at 4 15/566-2263. Macintosh LC Supports VGA Monitors Apple recently revealed that the Macintosh LC can support the VGA monitors common in the IBM PC market, giving users access to less expensive color displays of somewhat lower than Macintosh qual¬ ity. Apple said that the LC supports the VGA standard’s different scan rate and that the only re¬ quirement is a cable specifically designed to make the connection. Apple said it expects such cables to be available from third-party vendors. □ 18 MACWORLD • APRIL 1991 Another model year. And Canvas is still miles ahead. Lucky you. With brand new models of both the world’s top-ranked drawing programs to choose from. Simultaneously. And MacDraw® Pro isn’t a bad try. In fact, it reminds us of another drawing program we’ve always had the utmost respect for : Canvas 2.1 . Unfortunately for Claris, our new Canvas 3.0 includes enough major enhancements to leave their latest effort idling somewhere back in the dust. Again. Let’s take a look under the hoods.Canvas 3.0 gives you more high-end text handling features. Like binding to curves. Slanted margins. Text¬ wrapping outside — and/or inside — irregular objects, and full kerning & tracking control. Even conversion of PostScript® Type 1 fonts to customizable Bezier outlines. MacDraw Pro doesn’t. Canvas 3.0 gives you more technical drawing features. Like custom dynamic hatching. Custom parallel lines & curves. Custom dashed lines, curves & borders. Automatic dimension lines. Area & perimeter calculations. And a Smart Mouse™ drawing aide. MacDraw Pro doesn’t. Canvas 3.0 gives you more design/illustration features. Including unparalleled Bezier curve editing power-from multi-point selection & editing to automatic object conversion, combining and blending. Magnetic guidelines. Center line auto tracing of scanned images. And full bitmap editing in 24- bit color. MacDraw Pro doesn’t. Canvas 3.0 also gives you new built-in translators for important multi-platform formats like CGM, IGES and DXFM. And Open Architecture technology — allowing new tools, effects and translators to be added with ease at anytime. MacDraw Pro doesn’t. You are what you drive.Like Canvas 2.1 before it, the new Canvas 3.0 was developed in direct response to the wish lists of thousands of CANVAS M drawing professionals. Its heritage of performance is proven. Its price is right. And its ease of use is legendary. Which leaves just one last question. If what you draw is important to you, why settle for Claris’s sedate sedan when you can get your hands on a dream machine? Note to Canvas Users: Registered users who purchase Canvas 2.1 between Jan 1,1991 and May 31, 1991 qualify for a free upgrade to Canvas 3.0. All Canvas 2.1 users who purchased prior to Jan 1,1991 can upgrade to the new version for only $99 US. Canvas 1.0 or 2.0 users may upgrade for only $129 US. Prices valid through Aug 1,1991. Allow 4-6 weeks for delivery. All orders add $10 shippings handling. International Users: Please contact your local authorized distributor for availability details. Trading up’s so easy to do. But only for a limited time.MacDraw users: Trade up now to the new Canvas 3.0 for just S149 US. Just call 1-305-594-6965 and ask for Dept M.

SOFTVIEW » Macworld Expo ’91 World’s Largest Computer Flea Market BY JERRY BORRELL or a week last January, San Francisco had the feeling of the world’s largest computer flea market. Not since the heyday of Jim Warren’s Computer Faire (where Steve and Steve first introduced the Apple 1 to the public) has the City by the Bay been so dominated by one event. There was no sign of an economic recession at the exposition as visitors thronged the two major exhibit halls, gawking at the latest products and purchasing enough computer equip¬ ment to outfit a small city. Through¬ out the four days there were lines at Dr. Mac, ComputerWare, Educorp, Computer Selection, and at other booths where Mac products were ac¬ tually sold. And no wonder — at ComputerWare you could buy a 100MB hard drive for $699, a 195MB model for $999, Adobe Photoshop for $475, T/Maker’s SmartBundle for $199. A festive atmosphere prevailed. People waddled out with shopping bags full of products. Marketeers barked carni¬ val style at passersby. Microsoft cheer¬ leaders had visitors chanting enthusi¬ astically for product giveaways. Several companies offered product training to groups of attendees on the show floor. There were even some Classics and LCs in evidence. Developers forgot to curse the exposition’s organizers. And Apple, once the center of the Mac¬ world exhibits, seemed lost in the crowd of developers seeking to sup¬ port the Macintosh. More people than we have ever seen at a Macworld. Video Products Lead Announcements made in San Fran¬ cisco, and those that will precede the August Macworld Expo, show that video is taking a dramatic lead in cut ting-edge technology for the Macin¬ tosh. Light Source demonstrated its video editing system. Electric Image was showing software (now shipping after kicking around for a couple of years) that’s designed to do titling in 3-D for video. Digital F/X announced its intention to produce a software- only version of its award-winning video software. Bravo — selling turnkey sys¬ tems for more than $20,000 is anti¬ thetical to current Mac trends. SuperMac showed SuperSqueeze, video compression based upon the C-Cube Microsystems microprocessor. E-Machines also announced real-time compression-decompression. A host of smaller developers, led by Com¬ motion, challenged larger companies’ leadership in this area with software that accomplishes the same result without a hardware assist. Apple was mum about its video software but demonstrated a Sony product with a built-in video interface that hinted at a future relationship in the video product arena. RasterOps pushed its technology further by introducing a $1000 24-bit board with acceleration and video overlay. The old pioneer, Mass Microsystems, introduced a 24- bit video overlay board with a really neat interface, but one that’s a little behind the technology of products from RasterOps and Radius. RasterOps also stole SuperMac’s thunder by showing a wall of Barco display monitors organized to act in¬ dividually or to work together in monolithic, single-display fashion. The first shipping products to expand the display capacity of the LC, Classic, and si were shown. Lapis, Mirror, and Ehman had monochrome displays for the Classic. NEC offered a color dis¬ play for the si. RasterOps, in another first, had a 24-bit board with built-in acceleration for the si — a real problem, given that machine’s poor power sup¬ ply. Radius offered a connection for the Pivot monitor to the LC, but no two-page displays for the newest Macs. SuperMac showed its 8-bit processor direct slot-based board. Dynamac showed a flat panel LCD screen for the si that, for some, makes that computer a portable (so did John Sculley, in a cheap shot at his own portable). In Focus Systems showed its latest LCD for overhead projectors. Vertical Markets One of the subtle but rewarding as¬ pects of the show was the richness of products — the breadth of the offerings (continues) MACWORLD • APRIL 1991 23 Tsunami, Silverlining, La Cie and the La Cie Ltd. logo are trademarks of La Cie, Ltd., a Plus Development Company.

Plus, they have an external termination switch, which means you'll never have to open the case for any reason! You don't win awards for these features, but you do win a loyal following. Rave Reviews from Critics and Customers. Frankly, there's been a lot of talk about La Cie hard drives. Leading Macintosh consumer magazines praise us. Customers write us fan letters.

On Technology and ASD Software showed multiuser calendaring products that work over networks that are the first generation of System 7.0-related products. Mitch Kapor’s (On) product looks like a real hit. Psybron and PMC Telesystems had new versions of their single-user calendars (CalenDAr, Rendezvous Plus) while Pastel Development showed a new calendar cum database (Manager). Ethernet Products Proliferate A reflection of the fact that almost all networked Macintosh users are be¬ ginning to suffer from network slow¬ downs is that many companies offered Ethernet connections to AppleTalk, including National Semiconductor, Asante, Tri-Data (with some of the first third-party Ethernet boards for the si and LC), Shiva, Dove, Everex, Dayna, and Cayman. These compa¬ nies rightfully divine that users are demanding more from a network, even if it is only an improvement in printing and sharing electronic mail. And speaking of mail, Microsoft took the lead at the show with a new version of Microsoft Mail that recap¬ tures some ground from QuickMail and adds a host of network-analysis features rivaled only by Farallon (in the LocalTalk world). I also saw two new network-analy¬ sis products for LocalTalk: LocalPeek from The AG Group and Network Supervisor from CSG Technologies. A related product from Pharos Tech¬ nologies is Status Mac, a software product that enables a network ad¬ ministrator to check, for example, all the version numbers of applications on those machines. It’s really useful. A lot of companies — Orchid, Dove, and Cypress Research, for ex¬ ample — are still trying to overcome the prejudice left in the market by Apple’s faulty entry into desktop fax (and subsequent abandonment of its product). Accelerators Aplenty Now that we have Macs with 68030s, naturally some people will want to have Motorola’s just-shipping 68040 processor. Radius, Quantum Leap Systems, and Total Systems are glad to oblige. Additional accelerators were shown by Newer Technology (RAM disks, caches), Atto (a SCSI II accel¬ erator for overworked printers and scanners), Rodime, and others. Laser and Color Printers It’s clear from the show that the price for color and PostScript is now $9995 or less. QMS, Seiko (showing products with both A- and B-size output), Tektronix, Lasergraphics, General Parametrics, and CalComp all have such offerings. Seiko’s product, at the lowest price, is reported to be back¬ ordered for several months. Kodak showed a 35mm-quality thermal printer for $25,000. Prices have also tumbled for laser printers.

Because Tektronix introduces the first color printer that is PostScript- compatible for less than $5000. The Phaser II SX is great for individuals or small groups. It works with Windows 3.0 or Macintosh QuickDraw and is software-based PostScript- compatible. It also delivers brilliant 300 dpi ther¬ mal-wax color as only Tektronix printers can. For bigger businesses, we offer the new Phaser II PX. This printer is hardware-based PostScript- compatible with HP-GL and is licensed by Pantone, Inc*. It also works with Macs, PCs, and UNIX workstations. All at once. Now, say you buy an SX, your business grows, and you end up wishing you'd gotten the PX. No jSBjBBWVt need to worry because all Tektronix printers are upgradable so you'll never outgrow them. And in case you didn't notice, this entire ad was created by one of our printers.

Dataproducts has a new product in the wings. Input of Color Images Howtek and Kodak showed reworked models of their 35mm scanners, while Abaton, Umax, XRS, and Howtek had new color flatbed scanners. Nisca showed a small color scanner similar to the small Sharp scanner. Koala an¬ nounced new technology for video¬ camera input via the SCSI port. Truvel has a new owner and a simplified product line. Utilities Capture from Mainstay is now in re¬ lease 4.0 (saves TIFF files). Markup (also from Mainstay) with voice an¬ notation is soon to ship.

Affinity Microsystems announced Tempo II +, and Central Point Software announced a new ver¬ sion of MacTools Deluxe. CAD Despite the somewhat disastrous ex¬ perience of both Autodesk and VersaCAD Corporation in the Mac market (and their absence from the show), other companies continue to forge ahead. In architectural CAD, Graphisoft has taken a strong lead in the United States. There’s a new ver¬ sion of Innovative Data Design’s MacDraft. Schlumberger’s MacBravo looks ever better. VIDI’s Presenter Professional makes Pixar’s Mac- RenderMan rendering routines easily usable — a boon to all of us who would like to make use of RenderMan’s ex¬ quisite rendering techniques. Virtus showed 3-D modeling soft¬ ware aimed at architectural markets. DesignCAD, GraphSoft, and Engi¬ neered Software presented new ver¬ sions of their CAD products. Moda- CAD was showing a stereo 3-D version of its product for garment fabrication and design. 3-D Design Swivel 3-D Professional 2.0 has be¬ come the dominant 3-D product for the Mac. Byte by Byte’s Sculpt 3D, a perennial favorite (and nonshipping product) of mine at trade shows, is finally shipping at the price of (groan) $2500. Levco has been sitting on a 3- D modeler written by Duane Maxwell for too long — there is a question as to whether that company will be able to publish the product. Specular Inter¬ national officially announced Infini-D, a 3-D modeler.

And because of that little extra dedication, what started in my garage six years ago, has mushroomed into the largest third party producer of Macintosh mass storage. Today I honestly believe no one makes a better hard drive than Ehman. Our newest E-series products have all the “bells and whistles” of drives costing several hundred dollars more. Features like two extra power outlets for single switch, system bootup and dual fuse circuitry for added protection in the event of an electrical power surge. Ehman drives are fast and quiet, but it’s our commitment to your total satisfaction that separates us from the pack. All our drives come with a 30 day money back guarantee and a two year limited warranty as well as my own personal commitment to giving Ehman customers the best. If you’re not happy with an Ehman drive I want to hear from you and I’ll make it right. After all it’s not just a hard drive you’re getting, it’s an Ehman.

Deneba’s Canvas, which has taken over the realm of SuperPaint and MacDraw, was shown in version 3.0, a great improvement. Claris announced MacDraw Pro, with many new features, intended to retake its traditional market. MediaLab Technologies an¬ nounced PictureAccess, which the company says competes effectively with Photoshop and has unique fea¬ tures, such as compression and com¬ munications functions. Animation FilmMaker, the French product at last brought to the U.S. market by Para- comp, is the leader on the Macintosh. Two other animation entries were at the show: Motion Works’ AddMotion for FlyperCard users, and Gold Disk’s Animation Works, a more powerful general-purpose animation package. Image Compression There is a race between several ven¬ dors for image-compression products. Storm Technology has a software- hardware combination that leads the available solutions. But if Radius suc¬ ceeds with its Impresslt software-only product, Storm may suffer the usual slings of a pioneer. Pinnacle Micro was also showing a hardware compression/ decompression board, but no software interface. Kodak showed Color- squeeze, another software image- compression product. One of the greatest problems we have is how to access the various types of graphics files. Computer Friends and Radius both have software that works with their hardware systems that present viewers of various file formats with thumbnail-size represen¬ tations of files, software that should be rewritten as stand-alone applica¬ tions. Alternatively, Adobe should write this ability into the next version of Photoshop. Symmetry demon¬ strated Mariah, a picture database with a similar capability, off the show floor.

I've watched as each person wages their own personal, private battle to master the computer and the most popular Macintosh programs. I've seen their frustration, have empa¬ thized with their confusion, and understood their computer fears. I've talked to workers who have had new computers and new programs simply dropped on their desk with the directive to, \"leam this.\" I've listened to people who have struggled night after night trying to read and understand a computer manual. Can you imagine trying to under¬ stand and master 4th Dimension from the manual? You would be surprised at the number of people who have confided with me the fact that they've literally given up ever learning some of the programs. They simply put the box on the shelf and wrote the expenditure off as a bad investment. Hard Earned Money Wasted Can you imagine how much money has been wasted on programs and computers that are sitting abandoned? Right now think of the people working on Macs in your office. Do they really understand the ma¬ chine? Do they know what to do when it goes down? How many programs are each of your people using? Have they really mastered the programs they're using? Do they know the short-cuts and valuable tech¬ niques that will save you time, money, and increase your professionalism? An Excellent, Low Cost Training Answer Four years ago I founded Mac Academy. My purpose was to create a training orga¬ nization that provided training similar in nature to the Macintosh itself - simple, easy to use, and effective. Now, four years later the concept has proven to be a great success. Right now people are benefiting from MacAcademy training in over 100 cities in the U.S., in Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and 22 additional countries throughout the world. MacAcademy training is successful for one reason - it works! WING 7 juptiwm oili-niv The Video Answer Two years ago we introduced the MacA¬ cademy Video Training Library. This li¬ brary now includes over 45 different titles. Each video is 2 hours long and offers clear, concise, effective training for the Macintosh and over 20 popular programs. In many cases you can purchase up to 6 hours of training for one program. MacAcademy has resisted the temptation to follow competitive training programs who have recently implemented large price in¬ creases. Our videos started out at $49 each and are still only $49. The best training in the business for less than $50. This low cost training alternative has proven to be the Macintosh training choice of over 10,000 companies. Guaranteed Results The MacAcademy reputation is excellent. Our guarantee is simple: If you're not happy we'll give your money back. No hassles or problems.
