        "text": "The mobile and internet business decided on TBWA for its strength in innovation, according to Josephine Lam, head of marketing and sales at SmarTone.\n\n“Throughout the pitch, TBWA showed their strength beyond a creative agency, establishing themselves as a strategic partner by providing 360° communication solutions to meet our business needs. As we always innovate to better meet customer needs, it is important for us to find an agency partner who shares the same spirit,” she said.\n\nThe brand has taken on a more digital approach to customer experience recently, launching its first online store in February this year in recognition of the changing behaviours of Hong Kong’s shoppers.\n\nSpeaking at the time, Stephen Chau, interim chief executive officer at SmarTone, said selling international products and customer service was at the heart of its first foray into ecommerce.\n\n“SmarTone has always focused on delivering outstanding experience to our customers. In recent years, we have observed the trend of Hong Kong consumers shopping online. To better serve customer needs, our new online store focuses on bringing products from quality brands internationally to customers, and they also enjoy our renowned customer care such as gift wrapping service and 24/7 Web Chat,” he said."
