        "text": "Telcom SmarTone has launched a new network master video campaign featuring cross-generational celebrities Lo Mang (羅莽) and Fan Pui Ka (Ah Gi) to promote its 5G network quality and user experience.\n\nThe video, which is directed by Mihiel Wong, strategically showcases the effort of SmarTone’s engineering team who is committed to building unique mobile network with heart for Hong Kong people to enjoy unrivalled mobile experience anytime anywhere.\n\nIn the video, Lo was seen as a “real network master (No.1 網絡真師傅)” demonstrating three special martial arts moves, namely “All round testing” (左測右測), “clever allocation” (四兩撥千斤) and “united as one” (上下一心). These moves aim to show how SmarTone builds the seamless and smooth network for the convenience of HongKongers.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/smartone/videos/799453534760966/\n\nFan was featured as an online dating app user and encountered network issues when speaking to her crush virtually. The introduction of SmarTone’s 5G network then makes her ease into the convenience and comfort of being able to video call her ideal date at anytime anywhere.\n\nA SmarTone’s spokesperson said: “SmarTone builds network with heart and is chosen by consumers as No.1 Best Preferred 5G Network. We will continue to invest in the digital infrastructure and deliver the world-class 5G network in Hong Kong. Through this Network Master video campaign, we showcase our commitment to offering the best 5G network experience in Hong Kong.”\n\nBack in September last year, SmarTone launched a new TVC featuring actor Nick Cheung to showcase the capability of its 5G network.\n\nCheung, who has been a SmarTone customer for more than 20 years, stars in the TVC Trust the Best. The video starts with people suffering from slow speed internet connection due to a poor mobile network. Symbolising the 5G network of SmarTone, Cheung appears in the scenes, and with a flick of magic, he leverages the company's newly launched 5G MAX technology to bring forward the brand's 5G internet experience to everyone, telling the strengths of SmarTone’s 5G network coverage, real-time AI technology and Ericsson’s spectrum sharing that enables sharing of spectrum between 4G and 5G and more efficient use of its existing spectrum.\n\nThe TVC will be launched on TV channels, online platforms, as well as various OOH channels.\n\nSpeaking of the reasons for choosing Cheung as the main character of the new TVC, Josephine Lam, head of marketing and sales of SmarTone said, “SmarTone and Nick Cheung share the same belief of always striving for the best, as well as the daring mentality to make a commitment and take action.\"\n\nRelated articles:"
