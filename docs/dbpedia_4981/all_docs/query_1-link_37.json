        "text": "Soft earnings didn't appear to concern SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Limited's ( ) shareholders over the last week. Our analysis suggests that while the profits are soft, the foundations of the business are strong.\n\nExamining Cashflow Against SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings' Earnings\n\nMany investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow, but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nThat means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nFor the year to December 2023, SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings had an accrual ratio of -0.18. That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit. In fact, it had free cash flow of HK$953m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of HK$258.8m. SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings' free cash flow actually declined over the last year, which is disappointing, like non-biodegradable balloons.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings' Profit Performance\n\nHappily for shareholders, SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Because of this, we think SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings' underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Case in point: We've spotted you should be mindful of and 1 of them can't be ignored.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings' profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. So you may wish to see this free , or ."
