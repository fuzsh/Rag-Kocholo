We are thrilled to announce India’s pioneering solution in the realm of liquid oleoresin processing. Our state-of-the-art system integrates cutting-edge technology to revolutionize the production process, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and scalability like never before. 🤖 Powered by a 6-axis servo-based articulated arm system, our robotic marvel operates seamlessly on a linear rail, granting unprecedented control and precision through a robotic controller. With robotic movement and gripper assembly controlled by a PLC (Rockwell Automation) system, safety and reliability are at the forefront, with fail-safe mechanisms in place. 🔧 The operational sequence is seamlessly orchestrated, thanks to an interlock structure that ensures repetitive and uniform accuracy up to 99.7%. With the assistance of the SCADA (VISCON AUTOMATION) system, the robot can work on advanced modules, allowing for multi-recipe automation, empowering operators to take up to three recipes at a time, even during ongoing cycles. 🖥️ Our Human-Machine Interface (Exor India Pvt Ltd), the central hub through which all operations are managed, provides operators with intuitive control over the entire system. Coupled with Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology, which orchestrates commands to the robotic arm and all stations, our system ensures seamless integration and precise execution of tasks. 💡 Our modern SCADA architecture, complemented by interactive P&ID layouts and multiple screens, provides operators with real-time data insights, facilitating informed decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency.

Hier unsere Antwort: 💡 The buzzwords on the market presently are “#smart #production” and “#sustainability” – at least for us. Smart products are intended to increase the flexibility of production and thus achieve greater success in terms of productivity and delivery readiness. #Manufacturing is also becoming more efficient and productive. This also includes the production of individual parts. De facto, our products perfectly meet these requirements as they can be connected to various communication and operating schemes. Developers see great chances in the vision of cyber-physical systems to realize the factory of the future. With regards to supporting #sustainable #manufacturing systems of the future, we intend to replace high power consumption pneumatic actuators and valves with high-power density #integrated #motion #control solutions from esitron. ➡ Der Artikel mit dem ganzen Interview vom Easy Engineering Magazine erscheint demnächst. Wir freuen uns drauf! #smartproduction #automation #BLDC #Servomotors #drivetechnology #esitron\n\nNew world record made by Siemens Energy and GEFERTEC – From a supply chain crisis to groundbreaking innovation. Crafting steam turbines demands high quality, especially for guide vanes at Siemens Energy. In 2018, a supplier delay triggered a crisis, pushing delivery beyond turbine completion. This resulted in a rethink towards additive manufacturing, especially in the WAAM technology. The immediate availability of parts and the newfound independence from traditional supply chains marked a significant shift in strategy. Siemens Energy became the first company in the world to use the WAAM process in series production – with our arc machine series. The highlight? In fall 2023 the 1000th guide vane was printed – a real-world record! The power of collaboration in engineering excellence! Be independent of supply chains – choose WAAM – choose GEFERTEC! #additivemanufacturing #3dmetalprinting #waam #innovation #supplychain\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗘𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 Electric Linear Actuator Market was valued at USD 16.13 Billion in 2018 and is expected to witness a growth of 6.41% from 2019-2026 and reach USD 26.26 Billion by 2026.
