Annual Account Fee must be paid in full within 55 days or it will attract interest. Minimum monthly repayment required. Interest at the Standard Interest Rate is payable on outstanding balances after the expiry of any Start-up Interest Period. The indicative repayments are only an estimate and figures should be used as an indication only. They do not represent either a quote or pre-qualification or approval. To take advantage of the Start-up Interest Free Period, the indicative monthly repayments stated would need to be made by the due date for each statement period. Therefore, you repay the purchase amount on your Q Mastercard or Q Card (as applicable) in full within the Start-up Interest Period. In this instance, the indicative monthly repayment is the finance amount divided by the Start-up Interest Period. The indicative repayments assume there are no additional purchases, cash withdrawals, fees or charges are incurred. If there is a Payment holiday in addition to the Start-up Interest Period, you will be required to make the minimum monthly payments upon expiry of such Payment Holiday.\n\n**12/24/36 Months Interest Free - Available on Long Term Finance (LTF) for online only.

Min payments of 3% of the monthly closing balance or $10 (whichever is greater) are required throughout interest free period. Paying only the minimum monthly payments will not fully repay the loan before the end of the interest free period. Standard Interest Rate of 28.50% p.a. applies to outstanding balance at the end of LTF Interest Free Period. Rates and fees subject to change.
