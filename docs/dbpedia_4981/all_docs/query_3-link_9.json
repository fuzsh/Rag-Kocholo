        "text": "A.D. Vision was an American international multimedia entertainment company headquartered in Houston, Texas, prior to its collapse and distress sale to four other Houston-based companies in 2009. The company was active in home video production and distribution, broadcast television, theatrical film distribution, merchandising, original productions, magazine and comic book publishing. It was the largest anime distributor in North America and the United Kingdom before its demise. It was founded in 1992 by John Ledford and Matt Greenfield. Since then, the company had grown immensely in size and diversified with several subsidiary companies, handling an array of properties and original content. Perhaps their most popular property was Gainax's post-apocalyptic anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, originally released by ADV in the U.S. in 1996 and re-released several times since. The company maintained offices in North America, Europe and Asia. It served the United States, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. On September 1, 2009, ADV announced it was selling off its assets, including intellectual properties, to several companies.\n\nAC Propulsion is a San Dimas, California, USA company founded in 1992 by Alan Cocconi and Wally Rippel that specializes in alternating current-based drivetrain systems for electric vehicles. It offers AC-induction traction motors. The company produces electric vehicle drive systems featuring high performance, high efficiency induction motors and integrated high power battery charging. Previously, they built an electric sports car, the tzero and the eBox, an electric conversion based on the Scion XB. They also develop prototype electric vehicles for OEM customers. Founder Alan Cocconi designed and built the controller used in the original GM Impact, which later became the GM EV1. ACP introduced the first AC-100 in 1992 and the AC-150 150 kW integrated drive system in 1994. The AC-150 has been used in a variety of applications such as the BMW MINI-E, Yulon Luxgen van, Foton Midi taxi and a USPS LLV demo vehicle. AC Propulsion is a leader in Vehicle to grid or V2G systems, with their second generation AC-150 drivetrain offering a bidirectional grid power connection."
