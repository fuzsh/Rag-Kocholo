Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 1 Dear Friends Bilateral relations between Canada and India - both fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations - has been on the rise as there has been a 60% increase in two- way trade between the two countries in the last five years. India is now Canada’s 10th largest trading partner. Both countries plan to explore investment opportunities through India's flagship programmes such as Make in India, Start-Up India, Digital India and Smart Cities, as well as Canadian programs such as the Innovation and Skills Plan, the Canadian Technology Accelerators, the Start-Up VISA Program and the Global Skills Strategy. Priority sector collaboration are in these fields – agriculture, civil aviation, energy, rail, transportation, higher education and information and communications technologies (ICT). In this issue our cover story focuses on Indo-Canada Trade. We have interviewed the dynamic Nadira Hamid, CEO, Indo - Canadian Business Chamber (ICBC). Bombardier, one of the oldest Canadian company to have made its presence in India, has been quite successful. We spoke with Sudhir Rao, Managing Director, Transportation India, Bombardier. As Canada promotes action on climate change Alberta’s oil sands can be a nuisance. The climate impacts of oil sands are significant but an Indian company has found out an excellent solution. eSmart Energy Solutions Private Limited has come up with a technology that can purify tar at an effective price. The man behind this innovation is 75 year old Suresh Shah who highlights on the technology and how it can make a difference. Pankaj Jain, Director, Career Plus Services and a study abroad advisor has contributed an article on why migrating to Canada is far more attractive and the rapid growth of Indian students seeking education in Canada. D K Sareen, Executive Director, ESC, examines the pay offs of India in the hardware space if there is a strain in the pattern of trading in the hardware sector between the US and China. The 16th HKTDC Hong Kong Electronics Fair (Spring Edition) and HKTDC International ICT Expo welcomed more than 100,000 buyers from 153 countries and regions. There was a significant increase in the number of buyers from several markets. The ICT Expo saw again a substantial Indian presence as exhibitors displayed a variety of software products and innovations. With India becoming an economic power house thanks to its excellence in the field of ICT many Indian IT companies exhibit at major events across the globe. This year again 27 Indian exhibitors are participating under the aegis of Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC). This year’s ICT Expo adopted the theme of Smart City. Smart Living and featured a broad range of technologies and applications. As with every year IFA held again their IFA Global Press Conference 2019 in an exotic location this time Andalusia, Spain. The largest hosted press event again attracted 300+ journalists from 50+ countries whose thirst for knowledge was quite visible as most were quite excited catching up on the latest tech trends and products from renowned speakers and some globally well-known companies. The best part of IFA GPC that I have noticed over the years has been apart from the usual update of industry data from research firms and a chance to get an early sneak peek of some of the products - you get an opportunity to engage with the speakers spread over a couple of days. IFA GPC this year was no exception as it gives a sneak peek what to look out at one of the world’s top tech show IFA, Berlin. We have also featured Batoi Systems. Headquartered in Bhubaneswar, India, Batoi Systems range of products include Batoi Cloud Platform, Business Solutions and Hosting Services. Batoi provides an easy-to-use cloud platform for creating, using and managing software applications, websites, and e-commerce storefronts.

With so little time to relax between one meeting and the next, the travelers expect hotels to offer more than just a place to sleep. Together with hoteliers and industrial partners researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO created the FutureHotel network, in which they aim to make the hotel experience as comfortable and pleasant as possible. They are focusing their research not only on the bedrooms but also on public areas such as the lobby and reception. A study by the German Travel Association (DRV) revealed that 53 percent of business travelers find this aspect of their work particularly stressful. Long hours on the road, bad connections between flights, being separated from family and friends – these are just some of the negative factors that enter into the equation. Even having to stay in a hotel is often seen as a source of stress. This was the starting point of research in the project work of FutureHotel led by Vanessa Borkmann, a researcher at Fraunhofer IAO. As a professional architect, she gathered together partners from industry and the hospitality sector to study concepts and solutions in which hotels could be better designed. The FutureHotel project includes research on topics like interior design, personal services, mobile check-in and check-out processes, public spaces and leisure facilities, all with a view to creating that essential feel-good factor and a calming environment. The results of this specific research are published in her doctoral thesis with the title “A model to determine psychological stress levels based on the experience of business travelers when staying in a hotel.” As Borkmann says, “Especially in times of increased travel and high pressure of performance, it is crucial for business travelers to find a relaxing atmosphere during their stay in the hotel.” This isn’t always the case, as surveys of hotel guests conducted as part of the project revealed. The most frequent complaints included poor hygiene – for example, disagreeable smells in hotel rooms or insufficient cleanliness – and poor or non-existent acoustics that lets in noise from the street below or the room next door. Other negative factors mentioned were having to grapple with the intricate controls of lighting systems and showers, and long waiting times at the checkout desk. Hotel rooms with a feel- good factor So, which shifters provide more relaxation and comfort? How can hotel managers ensure that guests enjoy their stay and will come back again? How can mood lighting, heating levels and background music be used to create a stress-free ambiance? The one most important requirement for a good night’s rest is the quality of the bed, according to the results of the research project. There are smart hotel beds available that are equipped with a massage function and temperature- regulating mattresses of different firmnesses, which can be adjusted according to the individual guest’s preference. Another important aspect is the cleanliness of the hotel room and the availability of modern services: at a minimum, guests expect reliable, high-speed Internet access and sufficient power outlets. New technologies will enable hotel guests to connect numerous mobile and wearable devices to room management systems. In this way, the environment in the room can be adapted to the guest’s vital parameters such as blood pressure or body temperature. Sensor systems could be used to adapt lighting levels and other factors that influence the ambience of the room to the business travelers’ needs. “Light temperatures could be varied from warm (calming) to cool (stimulating), depending on whether the occupant wishes to relax or work,” says the researcher, describing possible digital solutions. Even bathrooms can be designed to enhance the feel-good factor – starting with plenty of shelf space for toiletries and well- lit mirrors. In the future, digitization will be increasingly used, according to the authors of the FutureHotel study. Augmented Reality techniques will enable guests to imagine themselves bathing in the dappled light of a woodland pool. “Environmental psychologists have proven that a view of trees can reduce stress levels within as little as 15 minutes,” explains Borkmann. Ahotel’s public spaces play an equally important role. Being able to socialize with other hotel guests in pleasant surroundings is an added stress-relief factor, according to the results of the research project. “In the future, hotels catering to the business-travel market will have to customize their services in order to stay ahead of the competition,” says Borkmann.

Global Technologies July - Aug 20196 T he US imports from China in the electronics hardware sector are mainly Mobile phones, telecom equipment, Data processing machines parts, machines for printing and copying, Storage units for automatic data processing machines, Static Converters, television sets, LCD. For the year, 2018, the total US electrical and electronics machinery and components imports from China aggregated to US$ 290 billion. In the same way, China depends heavily on the US for telecom components part. Corporations like Qualcomm, Apple, ARM, Intel etc are suppliers of chips, digital platforms of various configurations to China. For the year, 2018, this trade had aggregated to US$ 51 billion of electrical and electronics machinery and components. Before, assessing the probable gains that can accrue to India, it is important to have an idea about India’s electronics hardware sector. For the year 2018, the total production of hardware amounted to US$ 60 billion: of that close to US$ 8.4 billion was exported to over 200 countries. YEAR EXPORT RS. CR.

World production for electronic equipment and components during 2018 is estimated to be US$ 2 trillion. India’s Electronics Hardware potential Will US – China trade war catalyze that? V i e w p o i n t The US-China trade war is escalating and every passing day reveals a new dimension to the precipitating stand-off. Whatever may be the final outcome of the war, which is also euphemistically referred as a technology or digital war, it would redefine the trading patterns and structures.

A case in point is India’s export of PCB’s to both US and China. US imported US$ 534 million of various types of PCBs from China in 2018. It is important to see how India can take advantage of the increased prices of Chinese products on account of higher tariff. For instance, India can export to the US market, hardware products like PCB which has become price uncompetitive because of the increased tariff. Similarly, a parallel exercise has to be done as to how much market India can gain in the hardware space when the Chinese retaliate the imposition of tariff, particularly on the IT related goods. As per an analysis India has a good opportunity to enhance its exports of Inverter, parts of ballasts, Static Converters, other inductors and telecom products/parts. to China. Can India emerge as an alternate market for both the US and China for sourcing their hardware goods. The scope and range may be limited now. But it is important to extrapolate the gains of India in the future, having regard to the fact that the technology relationship between US and China would not be the same as it was. Both countries would try to reduce the exposure in each other’s country. The early signs of that scenario are already being played out. Corporations like Qualcomm, Intel, Apple etc are cagey about their continued relationship with China mainly out of the fear that their products may be plagiarized. Can these companies be wooed to India? It is possible. A few chip making and tech companies like Foxconn, Qualcomm, Apple etc have set their footprints in India. It is quite likely that they may be more interested in relocating to India from China rather than going to Vietnam and Philippines because of India’s good track record as a quality manpower provider. Of course, there should be a focused attention on ease of doing business, creating sound infrastructure including uninterrupted power supply since the hardware units consume more power and evolving a pragmatic labor policy, where the compliance are made easy and pragmatic. India should have a well laid out technology policy including a foolproof security system. The main grouse against Chinese investments in India in the hardware and software sector is apprehension about the malware and spyware. This happens mostly because of the inadequate arrangement for testing the equipment. Of late, India has made considerable breakthrough and investments in the testing space. Once a super structure is created and properly monitored, investments from Chinese technology companies like Huewai and ZTE can be promoted. There are other imperatives like formulation of a sound hardware policy, incentives for R&D and incubation in hardware sector, incentives for innovation, and specialized hardware parks with world standards, a sound market intelligence system to track pockets of high demand and importantly focus on disruption to evolve newer products. Conclusion / Recommendations: The Indian electronic manufacturing has been at the back foot due to lack of level playing field vis a vis competing nations. High cost of Finance, Power and Logistics/ Regulatory and Procedural problems add to disabilities estimated at 7-8%. Further, signing of ITA 1 and other FTA agreements have lowered tariffs on products below those applicable to inputs used in them making domestically manufactured goods uncompetitive. To make electronics products manufacturing in India viable, it is important to provide the manufacturers loans at lower interest rates, increased MEIS (7- 9%). To attract new investments incentives such as reduced CIT and faster clearances under MSIPS will act like a catalyst. To support manufacturing of ITA 1 covered products being imported into India duty free, sale of domestically manufactured goods should be treated as export. It would be a good idea to assist group of exporters by supporting their marketing offices in US and China. Bulk business in America demands that we stock our components/ goods in warehouses located within USA. This is often handled/ arranged by distributors who stock and supply components on a “consignment basis”. The payments are tied to the date on which the final customer buys the components and are not related to the date of export from India.Also, the US customers require that components that are not priced up within 6 months, be re-exported to the country of origin. This requires: a) Policy changes and interest subvention support to allow longer (than current 6 months) for payments to be received and goods to be re-imported in case they are not sold. b) Part support for the warehousing charges. Ideally a tie up with a few key warehouses would work well. The window may not remain open for good. It is time to act fast and make the best use of this opportunity to diversify exports. V i e w p o i n t Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 9 R esearchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS in Dresden have developed a new production process with the aim of efficient and environmentally friendly future battery production. They coat the electrodes of the energy storage cells with a dry film instead of liquid chemicals. This simplified process saves energy and eliminates toxic solvents. A Finnish company is currently successfully testing the new IWS technology in practice. Better and more cost-efficient production methods for energy storage are increasingly in demand, especially in Germany: All major automobile manufacturers have launched ambitious electric vehicle programs that will ensure a sharp rise in demand for batteries. So far, German companies have been purchasing the cells for this purpose in Asia. There are two main reasons driving this trend: Asian technology groups have many years of experience in the mass production of battery cells and a lot of energy is consumed in these processes. Production at locations with high electricity prices, such as Germany, is, therefore, very high-cost. No more toxic solvents – lower electricity costs It is exactly this fact the Saxon Fraunhofer engineers want to change: “Our dry transfer coating process aims to noticeably reduce the process costs in electrode coating,” emphasizes IWS project manager Dr. Benjamin Schumm. “Manufacturers can eliminate toxic and expensive solvents and save energy costs during drying. In addition, our technology also facilitates the use of electrode materials that are difficult or even impossible to process wet-chemically.” But exactly these materials are needed for future batteries with higher energy density. “For all these reasons, we think that our technology can help to achieve internationally competitive battery cell production in Germany and Europe.” Pilot plant successfully started in Finland This potential is also seen by Fraunhofer's Nordic partners: The Finnish battery company \"BroadBit Batteries\", together with IWS, has commissioned a pilot plant in its Espoo factory, which coats electrodes with dry electrode material instead of wet pastes, as has been common in industry up to now. BroadBit uses it to produce new types of sodium ion batteries. \"The demand for our technology is high, even in Germany,\" reports Benjamin Schumm. On a laboratory scale, the IWS can already coat electrode foil with a remarkable production speed of several meters per minute. In this respect the Dresden engineers can show the potential for transferring the technology to the production scale. Limits of classic wet chemistry Until now, cell producers have mostly coated their battery electrodes in a complex wet-chemical process. First, they mix the active materials, intended later to release the stored energy, with additives to create a paste. In this process they add organic solvents, which are expensive and usually toxic. In order to protect operators and the environment, elaborate precautions for occupational safety and reprocessing are necessary. Once the paste has been applied to thin metal foils, a further expensive process step begins: Dozens of meter long heating sections dry the coated films before they can be further processed. This drying procedure usually causes high electricity costs. Binding molecules form a cobweb Thenewfilmtransfertechnologyfordryelectrodecoating,onthe other hand, operates without these ecologically damaging and expensive process steps: The IWS engineers mix their active material with binding polymers. They process this dry mixture in a rolling mill known as \"calender\". The shear forces in this system tear entire molecular chains out of the binder polymers. These \"fibrils\" join with the electrode particles as in a spider web. This provides the electrode material with stability. The result is a flexible dry electrode material layer. In the next step, the calender laminates the 100 micrometer thick film directly onto an aluminum foil, thus creating the battery electrode. On the way to the solid state fireproof battery \"In this way, we are also able to process materials for new battery generations where classical processes fail,\" says Benjamin Schumm. These include, for example, energy storage systems that use sulfur as active material or solid-state batteries which employ ion-conducting solids instead of flammable liquid electrolytes. \"These batteries will be able to store more energy in the same volume than today's lithium-ion batteries,\" says the IWS scientist with a view to the future. \"However, these solid electrolytes can lose their functional properties in contact with solvents. A solvent- free coating process is significantly better qualified to produce these storage media.\" On the way of processing electrodes for all solid state batteries the researchers have reached one important milestone by applying their dry film technology using extremely low binder contents. They have recently published their results in ScienceDirect. This is what the electrodes coated with the new dry transfer coating technology look like. Fraunhofer IWS process enables battery electrodes to be produced on a pilot scale without using toxic solvents. © Fraunhofer IWS E l e c t r i c V e h i c l e s Economical energy storage for the electric car of tomorrow\n\n7. Global Technologies July - Aug 201910 C o v e r S t o r y T he recent BJP victory and PM Narendra Modi returning to power is viewed by many as positive signs for further growth. “Canada and India share tremendous people-to- people ties, with over one million people of Indian descent calling Canada home. I look forward to continuing to work with PM Modi to improve the lives of Canadians and Indians alike through education and innovation, investing in trade and investment, and fighting climate change,” said Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. Echoing the same views Canadian High Commissioner to India Nadir Patel said the win with such a majority signals that the pace of reforms, the pace of momentum, change is expected to continue. 2018 was a record year for two-way trade and level of exchange have been on an upward trajectory. The Canada-India economic relationship provides a small but important illustration of India’s evolution under PM Modi. Two- way trade in goods between Canada and India have reached $9.8 billion — a modest sum in the big scheme of things, perhaps, but it represents a billion-dollar increase over 2017, and is 60 per cent higher than five years ago, according to Nadir Patel, quoted in the Financial Post. India is now Canada’s 10th largest trading partner. A few years ago, it was 14th. Canadian investments into India have primarily come into the services sector which accounts for 36% of the total inwards FDI from Canada between April 2000 and Dec 2017, while investment in the infrastructure sector has been 12%. Indian companies on the other hand have invested especially in the IT, software, steel and natural resources sectors of Canada. Priority sector collaboration are in these fields – agriculture, civil aviation, energy, rail, transportation, higher education and information and communications technologies (ICT). Both countries plan to explore investment opportunities through India's flagship programmes such as Make in India, Start-Up India, Digital India and Smart Cities, as well as Canadian programs such as the Innovation and Skills Plan, the Canadian Technology Accelerators, the Start-Up VISA Program and the Global Skills Strategy. The launch of the Canada-India Accelerator Program for Women Tech Entrepreneurs, as well as the decision to convene a Canada-India Track 1.5 Dialogue on Innovation, Growth and Prosperity has been appreciated. Stress has been put on the importance of ensuring access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for all and advancing the food security goals of both countries. Climate change is a global issue both countries have taken on priority to secure a clean energy future. An initiative to establish the International Solar Alliance to promote renewable energy for sustainable development has been taken. Now research institutions and industry in both countries need to collaborate to promote greater use of solar technology. Both countries agree that renewable energy is a pathway to a low- carbon and more sustainable energy system and the need of the hour is to work together to explore opportunities to use innovative financing mechanisms. Indo-Canada Trade: On an upward trajectory Bilateral relations between Canada and India - both fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations - has been on the rise as there has been a 60% increase in two-way trade between the two countries in the last five years. Chandragupta Amritkar focuses on various aspects related to the priority sectors.

Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 11 C o v e r S t o r y What is this all about oil sands? Oil sands, also known as tar sands or crude bitumen are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit, which can be upgraded to synthetic crude oil.These occur naturally and are composed of a mixture of sand, clay and water that is saturated with an extremely viscous and dense form of petroleum. In layman terms wastage in oil is nothing but hydrocarbon where carbon is waste. Its important that we separate hydrogen and carbon as hydrogen has a lot of power. As my background is in capacitors I thought of making a carbon capacitor that can work as a battery. This would not only make charging very fast but also increase the storage power. We have developed a technology to convert sludge into high calorific value fluid with minimum value of diesel and pure carbon from which a rechargeable battery could be made to run the vehicle. We have converted a problem (pollution) into a solution (profit). That’s great but why has it not been invented orimplemented by anyone? Anybody can invent anything but at what cost is very important. To get pure carbon (without impurities) is not an easy process and is quite expensive. I have put in 11 years of efforts, R&D, couple of accidents, a litigation and millions of dollars to get the product with the right price and combination. Our pure carbon is ideal for automobiles. To give you an example – a 5KVA capacitor could run a rickshaw for 160KM with single charge and the charging time is hardly 30 sec at 50V. The rickshaw can run 160KM in 24 hours with a single charge of 30 sec. This is really a clean fuel and totally pollution free. So do you plan to set up a refinery? Yes but not those huge ones we will be making micro refineries which will be just 20 feet in length. At one end we put the sludge and at the other end we get hydrogen which is a pure refined oil produce. The oil does not have any carbon and now has multiple uses. Now our aim is to mass produce with number of micro refineries spread across mainly India, Canada and Venezuela. Why so much thrust on Canada and Venezuela? Canada and Venezuela are the major hubs for tar sand. In smaller quantities they are also found in Kazakhstan and Russia. In Canada tar sand is available at a fraction of a cent/ liter. Unfortunately it is not useable as the cost of cleaning is more than the cost of the finished product. But with our technology, we can utilize this tar sand and the stock millions of barrels – ideal for these countries governments who are looking for a solution. So what’s the strategy? Our first step is to work with the Canadian government, look out for a suitable partner and set up micro refineries. Each refinery will produce approximately 12 ton of fuel and 12 ton of carbon. Considering great profitability with a unique technology without pollution and green technology we are confident of getting the ministries attention as well as private partners. “We have converted a problem (pollution) into a solution (profit)” As Canada promotes action on climate changeAlberta’s oil sands can be a nuisance. The climate impacts of oil sands are significant, and the greenhouse gas emissions for oil sands extraction and processing are significantly larger than for conventional crude oil.While the oil sands industry continues to make technological advances, annual production growth presents challenges to land, water, and air impacts, and energy conservation. But an Indian company has found out an excellent solution. eSmart Energy Solutions Private Limited has come up with a technology that can purify tar at an effective price.The man behind this innovation is 75 year old Suresh Shah who has been successful in several ventures both in India, USA and Europe.Chandragupta Amritkar spoke with Suresh Shah,CEO,eSmart Energy Solutions on the technology and how it can make a difference.

As the business relationship between the two countries expanded it was necessary to have a chamber to facilitate the growth. So the Indo - Canadian Business Chamber (ICBC) was created to strengthen, promote and foster bilateral trade, commerce, and economic relations between the two countries. With our pan India presence we are able to cater to most business houses. Our efforts have always been to increase trade between the two countries. One of our major focus areas is the SME sector. Because of distance and time taken to commute there has been limited interaction between SME in both countries. We have put in efforts to connect them through delegations. Infact this June we had taken a delegation to Canada and it was quite successful. That’s great. What was the main focus? We went to Ontario. The objective was to explore and avail economic opportunities in Ontario and build partnerships in order to increase the two-way trade of goods and services between Canada and India and to actively participate in attracting foreign direct investment. It was organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Development Job Creation and International Trade, Government of Ontario; London Chamber of Commerce; City of Tillsonburg and Toronto Business Development Centre. The delegation comprised prominent trade and industry heads, representatives from Indian companies across the focus sectors - advanced manufacturing and technology; agriculture, information and communication technology, education and investments – as well as organisations and investors. The focus was on Ontario as an investment destination, immigration policies and programmes, tax policies and implications as well as business incubation programmes and Start-up Visa Induction. The business mission also presented the opportunities India offers to Canadian exporters. How do you view the current trade relationship between India and Canada? There is a lot of potential for growth. The major sectors are Energy, Infrastructure, Education, Agro and Food processing. Oil and gas is a very important sector. The recent Petrotech 2019 - the Oil and gas conference and exhibit - provided an excellent platform to promote technology and services from Alberta and to connect with the Indian oil and gas industry. There were 24 companies from Alberta. On the manufacturing front its more of partnership. We are using Canadian technology to enhance Indian manufacturing facilities. ICT has also great potential. Waste, water management, clean technologies have been gaining prominence. Another sector that we are exploring is hospitality. How is the immigration scenario? There is huge demand as global currents are favourable to Indians. Indian diaspora looking to obtain permanent residency in Canada is on the rise. According to recently released statistics, in 2018 Canada admitted more than 92,000 new permanent entry residents (similar to green card in the US) through its express entry system, which is a rise of 41% over the previous year. The number of Indian citizens (39,500) to be awarded permanent residency in 2018 has increased by 51% from 2017. What are your plans and forthcoming delegations from both sides? We have strong plans to help our members in their endeavour to grow, do suitable tie-ups and tap innovative ideas. A major focus will be the SME sector. We plan to take sectorial delegations to Canada and also get Canadian delegations to visit India and at select Indian trade shows. “One of our major focus areas is the SME sector” One of the pillars for fostering bilateral trade between Canada and India has been The Indo - Canadian Business Chamber (ICBC). Headed by the dynamic Nadira Hamid, CEO, ICBC, who has vast experience right from hospitality industry to corporate affairs and dealing with top level Government and Industry players. Responsible for facilitating trade promotion between India and Canada, nationally and on international forums we thought it the right time to interview her. Excerpts Nadira Hamid London - Mayor Ed Holder welcoming ICBC Deloitte Canada - ICBC Delegation Mayor Patrick Brown of Brampton with ICBC delegates Nadira in talks with Kirk Westgard, Deputy Minister, Government of Saskatchewan Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 13 C o v e r S t o r y O ver the last 15 years Canada has been the place of study for many Indian students and the numbers started picking from 2005. This was the time when USA, UK and Australia were the 1st choice for Indian Students. It all started with the popular four colleges of Toronto (Ontario) investing and aggressively marketing their colleges and courses in India. As the Canada student numbers started picking up more universities and colleges started looking at the Indian market in a big way. Presently Canada hosts more than 1.5 lakh Indian students. The biggest attraction is that Canada offers students Post Study Work Rights – meaning after you finish your studies – you can work and get practical exposure in a company based in Canada. To push International students & Indian student’s recruitment into Canada, the Govt. introduced a new scheme which was called SPP – Student Partner Programme. This became popular among both Indian students and career counsellors as it started to offer a faster route to getting Visa and minimum documentation. The SPP scheme become a big hit in India and Indian student numbers started growing from 10,000 in 2010 to 30,000- 35,000 by year 2015, a massive growth of 350% in 5 years. This SPP scheme became so popular that it was rechristened as SDS (Student Direct Stream) in 2018 by IRCC (Immigration, Refugees & Citizenship Canada) and is being now run in 4 countries – India, China, Vietnam, Philippines. Indian students grew by 40% in 2018. Work Permits There were around 40 institutions in SPP scheme and mostly were Skill Based Vocational colleges. These colleges were offering courses which were in big demand in the job market and so student could easily get jobs of CAD 35,000 - 45,000. The official rule of CIC for Work Permit was - 1 year course gives you 1 year Work Permit and 2 years course gives you 3 years Work Permit. After Class 12th, the following options are there - For 1 year study – you get Certificate; for 2 years study – you get Diploma; for 3 years study – you get Advance Diploma; for 4 years study – you get Degree. At PG Level – University offers 2 years MA/ MSc./ MBA Degree, while colleges offer 1 or 2 years – Certificate/ Diploma Postgraduate courses. IELTS English Exam is a must for Visa under SPP scheme and ideally the requirements are: UG – 6.0 overall (with no band less than 5.5) and PG – 6.5 overall (with no band less than 6.0). The tuition fee ranges from: Universities – CAD 15,000 – 40,000 p.a., Colleges – CAD 13,500 – 30,000 p.a. and Living Costs is fixed by CIC – CAD 10,000 per year. Canadian colleges offer very few scholarships. (1CAD = Rs. 53) PR Options PR (Permanent Residency)isanoption which is being easily offered by Canadian Govt. to overseas students. Student after finishing studies can file for PR and it can take 1-2 years in Toronto (Ontario) area to get PR. Some other states like British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba offer PNP (Provisional Nominee Programmes) in which PR is granted faster in 6-10 months, but you have to stay in that Province (State). Most of the time for UG student PR has happened in 6-7 years. Students can stay on PR status for lifelong or can apply for Canadian Citizenship also after 2 years or so. PR is the big point which has been attracting loads of Indian students to Canada. Finally students choose Canada as it is very safe place for them and there is hardly any discrimination. Add to this Canada is English speaking country. Canada an attractive option for Indian students Though USA and UK are the destination for Indian students,America seems to be losing its sheen with diminishing job prospects after post-graduation.This makes migrating to Canada far more attractive as Permanent Residency options are favourable to Indians feels Pankaj Jain, Director, Career Plus Services and a study abroad advisor. Top Universities are: 1. University of Toronto 2. Mc Hill University 3. University of British Columbia 4. Lakehead University 5. University of Waterloo Top Colleges are: 1. George Brown College 2. Seneca College 3. Centennial College 4. Conestoga College 5. Niagara College 6. Sheridan College\n\n9. Global Technologies July - Aug 201914 What role do you thing Bombardier has played for better Indo-Canadian relationships? I think we have been playing a pivotal role in the Indo-Canadian relationship investing in India for over 50 years.We are in a segment that has been critical in India i.e., transportation be it rail or aviation. We recently celebrated 10 years of successful partnership with Delhi Metro with more than USD 1.25 BN worth of orders placed on Bombardier since 2007. We are one of the largest rolling stock suppliers to Delhi Metro having delivered 776 metro coaches (or cars). We are also the largest signalling supplier to Delhi Metro with over 120 track kms delivered. Bombardier has been supporting Mumbai’s rail ecosystem from 2002. We have installed and maintained the Traffic Management System (TMS) on Mumbai’s Western and Central lines. Currently, Bombardier is moving around 5 million people daily in Mumbai and Delhi and our propulsion equipped locomotives travel around 300,000 kms on Indian Railways network. Infact it wouldn’t be wrong to say that we have been one of the flag bearers for Canada in India and are very integrated into India. So you have been quite successful with Delhi and Mumbai metros. With more metros in the pipeline across the country what is your strategy? We are confident that our level of penetration can be extended beyond these two metro cities. We already have a very strong manufacturing and supplier base. Indian rail transportation market is very, very strong and we have a key role to play. I want to capture more market share for Bombardier Transportation in India across business segments. But for that we need to understand smaller orders to participate in tier 2 and 3 cities. There is a growing market for public transit driven by urbanization, environmental concerns and, most importantly, infrastructure spending by cities and governments. With Indian government, we’re seeing clarity on modes of transport ideal for a particular city with major focus on integration, creating mobility ecosystem keeping safety in mind. With Indian PM Narendra Modi talking of digital India, smart cities, bullet trains – what role do you foresee your company playing in Indian PMs vision? The main purpose of smart cities is to improve quality of life and one of the lifelines is good transportation - one that is non- polluting and for this mass transit expansion is required. The bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will bolster the economy, create new jobs, improve connectivity, and enhance infrastructure and manufacturing in India. While we are not involved in this project the Indian government is planning more routes for the very high-speed (VHS) trains, and Bombardier already has its presence in a big way in Europe – an estimated 95 per cent of Europe's VHS trains and helped deliver 1000 trains in this segment. Our very-high-speed trains are already setting the benchmark in very high performance in the range of 250 kms – 380kms/ph. So we are sure we will be able to contribute to create a high-speed network with our world-class ZEFIRO High speed trains. Can you elaborate on your manufacturing set up in India? That’s one of our biggest plus points. We have a large industrial presence in India - a well-established manufacturing operation, engineering capabilities, supplier base and over 2200 highly skilled employees in India. We have two factories in Vadodara. The high degree of localization executed in the project at Bombardier’s Savli and Maneja sites fulfils the requirements of the Indian government’s ‘Make in India’ campaign. Vadodara is one of the few cities in the world with the capacity to deliver all key electrical and mechanical components for the manufacturing of railway vehicles. \"Bombardier offers the broadest portfolio of rail vehicles and technologies in the industry\" Bombardier, one of the oldest Canadian company to have made its presence in India, has been quite successful.With huge investments in two factories and two engineering centers its playing a vital role in the railway infrastructure of the country.To get an insight into the company and its activities we spoke with Sudhir Rao, Managing Director, India, BombardierTransportation. Excerpts C o v e r S t o r y Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 15 Currently, Bombardier is the first foreign multinational company to set up a wholly- owned railway vehicle manufacturing facility in India; first rail company to use robotic welding in India; delivered India’s first indigenously produced metro train in India for India, delivering India’s first rolling stock project by a multinational company for exports; first multinational rail manufacturing site to be accredited with International Railway Industry Standard (IRIS) certification amongst many other achievements. Our Savli site has a demonstrated capacity of manufacturing one car per day and we have built capacity to manufacture 35 metro cars per month. Our Maneja site is also supplying propulsion equipment to Indian Railways for locomotives and EMU’s for over 2 decades. Apart from this we have two engineering set ups – one in Hyderabad and another in Gurugram. Both these centers are not limited to the Indian market but serve the global market. Our Hyderabad engineering centre supports product development and design activities. This facility expands Bombardier's global network of specialised centres with a particular focus on the development of metro and electrical multiple unit (EMU) product platforms and engineering design for transportation projects locally and globally. A new rail control facility for Engineering and Product Development (EAPD) was created in Gurugram Delhi NCR. With such a set up what about exports from India? We are currently manufacturing 450 commuter cars for the Queensland New Generation Rollingstock (QNGR) project for Australia. Vehicle assembly and bogie manufacure is taking place at Vadodara, is supplying a portion of the propulsion equipment. These trains travel more than 10,500 km by road and sea from Vadodara to the Port of Brisbane. More than 430 commuter cars have been delivered to Australia and are gradually entering passenger service post rigorous testing. These trains supported mobility during 2018 Common Wealth Games in Gold Coast. We are also supplying bogie components for export projects to Australia, Brazil, Hungary and Saudi Arabia. What type of new technologies/innovations do you plan to bring into India? We are the cutting edge of technology and have a state of the art manufacturing plants. In terms of new technologies, Bombardier offers the broadest portfolio of rail vehicles and technologies in the industry and can offer individual solutions for all Indian cities. Focusing on the most pressing public transport challenges in India, Bombardier offers all products needed for a comprehensive transport system – from metros and Light rail vehicles (LRV) as well as APM and Monorails to regional commuter and high- speed trains along with rail components, signalling systems and maintaining the asset. Expertise, creativity, market knowledge and vision are just some of the reasons why Bombardier is setting the industry pace in providing the most innovative and cost-effective rail solutions in today’s market. We strive continuously to improve reliability, availability, maintainability and safety while supporting and strengthening sustainable rail transport. How do you view the mobility challenges in India? Its multidimensional. The amount of road accidents in India is huge. On the other hand, I believe safety record of railways has improved over last 4 years. Railways globally are much safer, cleaner with better mobility. I think Government should focus on introducing new rail solutions like Airport People Movers, Light Rail Vehicles, Monorails also for Indian cities. In addition, with government’s strong focus on e-mobility vehicles, PRIMOVE is Bombardier’s complete e-mobility portfolio allowing cities and the transportation industry to easily incorporate electric mobility. It includes wireless charging, compact battery and efficient propulsion systems for electric rail and road vehicles. PRIMOVE makes sustainable mobility a reality by reducing local CO2 emissions to zero. It eliminates noise pollution and integrates seamlessly into the environment. Where do you see the Indian subsidiary in next 3 years? Bombardier aims at investing in India with a long-term perspective in manufacturing facilities, local talent, developing local supplier base, enhancing engineering capabilities and new technologies in the projects which are strategic to our growth in India. We are focused on projects which we consider as strategic and have long term prospects for our operations in India. We are closely pursuing various metro projects around India. Mass Transit systems in over 50 cities by 2020, modernization of Indian Railways network, plans for semi-high speed and high- speed trains offer a huge potential to further optimize the Indian transport system. Bombardier Transportation is committed to the growth of rail transportation industry in India and as we grow in the coming years, if deemed necessary we will also look at increasing our presence in India.

Global Technologies July - Aug 201918 E v e n t R e v i e w U nder the aegis of ESC and the Ministry of Commerce, India the ICT Expo saw again a substantial Indian presence as exhibitors displayed a variety of software products and innovations. With India becoming an economic power house thanks to its excellence in the field of ICT many Indian IT companies exhibit at major events across the globe - one such important show is the HKTDC ICT Expo. This year again 27 Indian exhibitors are participating under the aegis of Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC). “It was quite a successful event for us and next year we hope to bring in more Indian exhibitors especially for the smart city section, “said D. K Sareen, Executive Director, ESC. Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the 16th HKTDC Hong Kong Electronics Fair (Spring Edition) and HKTDC International ICT Expo welcomed more than 100,000 buyers from 153 countries and regions, up 3.6% year on year. There was a significant increase in the number of buyers from several markets, including Mainland China, Macau, Japan, Korea, Thailand, South Africa, Brazil, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Russia and the United Kingdom. The Spring Electronics Fair received a total of over 67,000 buyers, while the ICT Expo saw over 34,000 buyers in attendance. Benjamin Chau, HKTDC Deputy Executive Director, said: “In the digital era, innovation and technology have become mega trends and smart cities are beginning to change the way people live, work and play. To meet the demand from buyers globally, this year’s ICT Expo and Spring Electronics Fair put the spotlight on smart city solutions and cutting-edge electronic products. Sourcing and business discussions were brisk throughout both events.” Independent on-site survey: Respondent’s positive about sales prospects in 2019 To gauge the industry’s views on market prospects, product trends and hot issues, the HKTDC commissioned an independent on-site survey during the fairs that interviewed a total of 903 buyers and exhibitors. The survey found that most respondents (96%) expect overall sales to rise (50%) or remain steady (46%) in 2019. In terms of growth prospects in major sales markets, respondents view Korea (85%) as being the most promising among traditional markets over the next two years, followed by Western Europe (79%) and North America (77%). As for emerging markets, Mainland China (77%), ASEAN (71%) and Latin America (70%) are the most favoured by survey respondents. Regarding product trends, the survey showed that electronic/electrical accessories (27%), digital imaging (13%) and audio-visual products (12%) have the highest growth potential in their major sales or export markets in 2019. Asked about current global issues, 59% expect that the ongoing trade friction between the United States and Mainland China will have no impact on the sector’s export performance, while 65% of respondents believe Brexit will have no impact. The survey also showed that 86% of respondents are either neutral or optimistic about smart city development in Hong Kong, thanks to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government’s push to launch smart city initiatives. Smart city solutions in the spotlight This year’s ICT Expo adopted the theme of Smart City • Smart Living and featured a broad range of technologies and applications. Key exhibitors included Cyberport,AirportAuthority Hong Kong, Microsoft, NEC, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, SenseTime, the Smart City Consortium and Xiao-i. In addition, the expo featured several pavilions including those of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) of the HKSAR Government and the Hangzhou Government. One of the prominent company in the smart city section was Prodigy Electronics. “We have been participating annually for the last several years. This year we participated as part of the \"Smart City\" platform and apart from connecting with potential new customers it helped us build our brand image among the visitors and exhibitors,” said Karunakaran, President, Prodigy Electronics The company displayed their IOT city car parking management system that integrates with Smart city applications. It included intelligent road studs that detect presence of car in a carpark bay Smart city and ICT solutions gain prominence Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 19 E v e n t P r e v i e w C M Y CM MY CY CMY K\n\n12.

When asked about his views on the Indian market Karunakaran was quite upbeat, “Our company Prodigy Electronics is impressed with the explosive growth in India internal consumer base with the strong leadership of the government. We are presently doing B2B exports into India market. We are working with local partners and system integrators to expand our business in the Indian smart city market. As we foresee a great potential we plan to expand our network soon.” Latest high-tech products on show A highlight at the Spring Electronics Fair was the new AI & Voice Recognition zone, set up in the Tech Hall to meet the market’s demand for products and solutions related to these emerging technologies. The fair also hosted multiple seminars and networking events to help participants get a better understanding of the latest technological trends and opportunities, including the anchor conference, “Tech Trends Symposium 2019 – Roadmap to the Future”. Using AR to excel at sports In 2018, the global market for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) was Rmb 70 million, or roughly US$10.4 billion. That number looks set to grow exponentially, and is expected to exceed Rmb 200 billion by 2020, according to Kenny Cheung, General Manager and Vice President of Kopin Asia, who spoke on the topic of AR/VR. The practical applications of these technologies outside of gaming, enterprise or military applications might not seem obvious, but much of that has to do with finding the right fit – literally. “Every time I try VR, I find it is really not easy,” said Mr Cheung, explaining that the weight and cumbersome nature of the headset commonly used in VR gaming makes it impractical to wear for very long. “A lot of people think display is one of the major roadblocks to make VR and AR widely popular,” he explained. How the cloud can relieve snoring Around 80% of people affected by sleep apnea, or irregular breathing patterns during sleep, aren’t aware they suffer from the problem. What might seem like an annoying snoring issue could actually be a medical condition that can develop into more serious ailments such as depression, heart disease and diabetes. Crystal Fok, Associate Director of the MPE Cluster & Robotics Platform at Hong Kong Science andTechnology Parks Corporation (HKSTP), took to the stage to detail how advancements in biomedical technology could help physicians to diagnose and treat patients more effectively. Ms Fok spoke about Belun Technology Company, a Hong Kong-based start-up that developed a medical- grade wearable ring to help diagnose sufferers of sleep apnea in their homes. Media Breakfast Meeting An annual affair – it’s one of the best ways to connect with smart, innovative and upcoming companies. This year again HKTDC presented 14 companies to the media. Of these I felt there were two products that have great potential for the Indian market if promoted properly and with good dealers. Revsmart Wearable presented a module that fits into any helmet and makes it smart and connected. “Safety is priority for us. While most helmets have wires for communication, we have successfully made a wireless helmet,” said Sundar Jagannathan, CEO, Revsmart Wearable. Adding Open Ear Audio using Piezo technology they have created an experience platform to help rider’s access communication, navigation and music effectively. Powered with a rechargeable lithium ion battery that can last up to 8 hours. The other company is IP3 Concept. Their CEO, Nicolas Salah is quite dynamic as well as innovative. They have come out with a smart industrial manufacturing concept - Pallet blocks feet made of corrugated cardboard. They are light in weight but can take substantial weight (Nicolas Salah showcased it by standing on one such pallet). With a selected quality cardboard they can be 100% waterproof and up to 600 kg resistance per plot. Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 21 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K\n\n13.

The next CES Asia is scheduled from June 10-12, 2020 in Shanghai, China Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 25 C l o u d C o m p u t i n g I t was during Indiasoft 2018 that I had the opportunity to interact with the soft spoken but dynamic Ashwini Kumar Rath, Founder Director & CEO, Batoi Systems Pvt Ltd. While there was a problem with his stall he patiently tried to solve the issue with the organisers as well as the stall constructor but not to much avail. I was impressed by his control on temper. Again at Indiasoft 2019 when I visited his stall – it was probably one of the best stall designed at the event. “It’s a lesson learned and this time I personally looked into it and got the best designer. We are one of the best in our field and at any expo the stand reflects your company especially to International buyers/visitors,” said a smiling Ashwini Rath. And how true. Batoi Systems Pvt Ltd has created a reputation for itself and is well known globally as a leader in its field with a recent expansion to USA.

Global Technologies July - Aug 201926 I n n o v a t i o n s Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 27\n\n16. Global Technologies July - Aug 201928 C u r t a i n R a i s e r A s with every year IFA held again their IFA Global Press Conference 2019 in an exotic location this timeAndalusia, Spain. The venue was the beautiful Barceló Punta Umbría Beach Resort that featured two large outdoor swimming pools, a spa and four restaurants. The dynamic Duarte Vasconcelos, Director, Barceló Punta Umbría Beach Resort and his team including Jenifer Glez made sure that the event went off well. The largest hosted press event again attracted 300+ journalists from 50+ countries whose thirst for knowledge was quite visible as most were quite excited catching up on the latest tech trends and products from renowned speakers and some globally well- known companies. IFA GPC this year was no exception as it gives a sneak peek what to look out at one of the world’s top tech show IFA, Berlin. While we witnessed Sennheiser’s 3D audio AMBEO sound bars original prototype at CES in January the final retail version was showcased at IFA GPC ahead of its release. Packed with 13 separate drivers including two 3.5” top-firing speakers, the AMBEO delivers 5.1.4 immersive sound with compatibility with the three main 3D audio formats (Dolby Atmos, MPEG-H and DTS:X). The 3D audio system uses proprietary virtualization technology and is jointly developedwithFraunhoferin order to create an immersive listening experience from a single box. The system takes advantage of any wall reflections and comes with a microphone and stand for bespoke calibration. The bar itself is considerably larger than most competitors - 126.56 x 17.1 x 13.44cm (L/D/H), and weighing 18.5kg. The Sennheiser Ambeo comes at a huge price - £2,200 (Rs. 2 lakh). An interesting announcement made at the press meet was that Sennheiser, the audio specialist will become the official IFA Global Audio Partner to IFA 2019 and will provide a perfect platform for Sennheiser to demonstrate its ambition to shape the future of audio. Sennheiser will support key IFA events with its range of professional audio gear and support journalists with equipment and technical support. “After many years as part of the IFA community, we are delighted to become the global Audio Partner of IFA,” said Dr. Andreas Sennheiser, Co-CEO, Sennheiser Electronic GmbH & Co. KG. “This partnership is particularly exciting as we will not only participate in IFA Berlin but will also be proud to support the international activities of IFA. With a fast-growing market in China, we are especially looking forward to participating in CE China and its Retail University, as these provide outstanding opportunities to get closer to our customers in this vibrant marketplace, build ever stronger relationships and leverage exciting new opportunities.” Jens Heithecker, IFA Executive Director: “We are pleased to bring our longstanding partnership with Sennheiser to a new global level. For both partners, measurable positive effects are created.” While AI is taking the tech world by storm, I was surprised when at the Power Briefing Philips, Marlies Gebetsberger, Personal Health Leader Philips Market DACH announced that it will be releasing a new AI-powered Co-innovation: At the heart of the IFA experience Sennheiser’s first foray in to the world of consumer speakers; Philips releasing a new AI-powered razor, a belt-like SmartSleep Snoring Relief Band; Safera Sense, a smart sensor unit for cooking; Hisense showed off its yet to be launched 75” LED display new 8K TV and many more firsts were announced, unveiled, displayed and demonstrated for the global media at IFA Global Press Conference 2019 in Andalusia, Spain. Jens Heithecker, IFA Executive Director; Dr. Andreas Sennheiser, CEO, Sennheiser; Keita NISHIYAMA, Director-General, Commerce and Information Policy Bureau, METI; Margot Edelman, Vice President, Edelman; Miss IFA; Hans-Joachim Kamp, Chairman of the supervisory board gfu Consumer & Home Electronics; Melinda Crane, Moderator; Dr. Christian Göke, CEO, Messe Berlin (l.t.r.) Global TechnologiesJuly - Aug 2019 29 razor – the Philips S7000 Smart Shaver. The new S7000 is far more advanced, featuring its own dedicated app which helps to prevent skin irritation. The app works in conjunction with the S7000’s built-in Beard Adapt Sensor, which records dozens of measurements per second of hair density and direction and adjusts the blade accordingly to optimise shaving for each area of the face. Again a big part of focus was sleep-related issues including insomnia and sleep apnea. A new anti-snoring wearable which aims to tackle the problem which, according to Philips, affects around 40% of the world’s population. The belt-like SmartSleep Snoring Relief Band works using “positional training”, with its built-in sensor first monitoring the user’s sleep positions over a period of a few nights. There is a small sensor you wear across your body that uses gentle vibrations to “promote a favourable sleeping position.” This is supposed to let you fall asleep in the position that’s most comfortable for you, and ostensibly should help keep you in that position. Philips claim the vibrations will be light enough not to break your sleep, unlike the sharp kick in the shins most suffers no doubt normally experience from their partners. It seems the belt will also provide feedback based on your sleep habits, thus helping to promote a good sleep position. Philips Sonicare Teledentistry app will act as a virtual dental care and RFID chips in the toothbrush and head will be used so the app can remind you when to replace the head. The toothbrush will also automatically be set to the right setting so you’re always getting the best clean. The app will also have a Direct Care feature which gets you to take a photo of your teeth and sends it to a remote Teledentist who will return personalized feedback within 6 to 24 hours. Hisense showcased its new 8K TV, the Hisense 74U9E. The 75” LED display has an impressive 5,376 local dimming zones for improved contrast and it seemed to perform very well during an encouraging demo session with what appeared to be upscaled 4K content. Yannick Fierling, CEO, Haier Europe stressed that their aim is not just being the biggest, but the most innovative company in the market. Its new line of Candy RapidO washing machines will tell the user through an app how to exactly wash your clothes, whatever the color or material. The accompanying app offers a magical feature wherein it tells you the perfect settings to use, based on a photo of your unclean clothes. Simply put, it makes your kitchen a smart one by alerting you if there are temperature changes, especially if the stove’s on but no one’s there. You can even connect it to your stove and turn it off via the app. It’s also compatible with various home assistants.. Take a picture of your laundry pile and Haier claim the app’s sophisticated built-in algorithm will magically recognise the material of each item and then automatically set the appropriate program and maximum water temperature for the wash. One product that caught a lot of attention was Safera Sense a Sense smart cooking sensor - a tiny sensor that you attach to your kitchen which will monitor heat, movement, activity, and even air quality. Manufactured by Finish firm Safera - Sense smart cooking sensor will help eradicate cooking-related fires. When placed above the stove it can recognise different cooking events, set timers automatically (shuts off electricity to the stove should the sensor detect dangerous heat levels) and act as an alarm should it notice irregularities. Safera Sense also monitors the air quality, humidity and temperature in real time. A power control unit is said to be in development so the sensor can shut off your electric stove remotely. Connectivity is key Hans-Joachim Kamp, Chairman of the supervisory board of gfu Consumer & Home Electronics, the organiser of IFA, said that “the consumer electronics and home appliance industries are continuously focusing on connectivity. More and more products use artificial intelligence which enables them to improve their performance over time. In addition, voice controlled systems upgrade the devices’ skills and expand their possible use cases. Thus, both industries are highly innovative as IFA in Berlin will show once again. At the world’s most important trade show for C u r t a i n R a i s e r\n\n17. Global Technologies July - Aug 201930 C u r t a i n R a i s e r consumer electronics and home appliances all innovation is on display. Furthermore, IFA is the perfect common platform for the industries, the trade, visitors and media as the outstanding order volume of more than €4.7bn indicates.” “In 2018 the global market of Technical Consumer Goods (TGC) generated a turnover of more than one trillion Euros for the first time, an increase of 3.3%. For 2019 we again expect an increase in turnover of 1% up to €1.052tn. Especially Europe, North America, Middle East and Africa are growth markets. For consumer electronics, we forecast a stable development, while home appliances are expected to grow again”,Kamp concluded. The Press Conference There were a slew of announcements at IFA GPC - IFA Next announced Japan as its first official Global Innovation Partner. IFAalso released the names of its first two keynote speakers at IFA Berlin 2019: Richard Yu, the Chief Executive Officer of Huawei, and Cristiano Amon, the President of Qualcomm. Margot Edelman, who presented the findings of the Edelman Trust Barometer at the IFA GPC said “The technology industry, however, has not been without challenges during the past year. Despite this “techlash”, the technology sector continues to be the most trusted industry, even though consumers are deeply concerned about how new technologies will affect their future.” Messe Berlin CEO Dr Christian Göke highlighted the reasons for IFA’s unrivalled international success. More than ever before, “co-innovation” was at the heart of the IFA experience, he said: “No industry operates in isolation, but only at IFA can you see the true breadth of it, because co- innovation is not just electronics companies competing with each other. Tomorrow’s Smart Homes are being innovated today by companies from the consumer electronics sector, health and wellness, white goods and many more … and the only place where you can see them all come together is IFA Berlin.” Innovation, said Dr Göke, needs a platform as a showcase, to be trusted, to inspire others, to be inspired by others, and to be seen by people who would otherwise never encounter a company and its innovation: “And that’s exactly what IFA is and does: we are a trusted platform, that grows with and powers the growth of all our partners.” “IFABerlin is now part of a global network connecting retailers, media and consumers like no other convention in our industry,” said Dr Göke. A showcase for Japan’s technological excellence On 28th and 29th of June 2019, the leaders of the G20 will gather in Osaka, as Japan hosts its first ever G20 Summit. During its presidency of the G20 Summit, the Japanese government is determined to carry out strong leadership in advancing discussions toward resolving the myriad issues now facing the international community. Underlining this renewed dynamism, Japan will be the first IFA NEXT Global Innovation Partner in its history. “Japan is a country that was the main driver to create the world of consumer electronics as we know it today, and that – once again – has become an incredible hub for industry research, thought leadership and start-up innovation,” said Dr Christian Göke. Keita Nishiyama, the Director-General of the Commerce and Information Policy Bureau at Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), addressed the media on the key issues at stake heading into the future, in particular when it comes to new data governance models. He was accompanied by Genichiro Shimada, Director Cross Value Innovation Project External Relations Department, Panasonic Corporation, and Takashi Sato, Managing Director, Unipos Europe. “The Osaka G20 will, I believe, and as stated by our Prime Minister, long be remembered as the summit that started world- wide data governance”, said Mr Nishiyama. “The time to do so is ripe, as it will be digital data that drives our economy forward.” With more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of digital information circulating each day, Mr Nishiyama called for the establishment of “DFFT” – or Data Free Flow with Trust, for non-personal data. He said that while personal data and intellectual property need to remain under careful protection, on the other hand, the free flow of medical, industrial, traffic and other highly useful non-personal data must be allowed to flow freely across borders. The result will, he says, be “Society 5.0”, which this fourth industrial revolution will bring about, thanks, in part to new collaboration between entities such as the OECD, WEF and G20.
