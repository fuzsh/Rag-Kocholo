Which is one reason why we’re pretty good at making both routine and complex spreadsheet tasks simpler. The other reason is that since the introduction of Microsoft Excel, we’ve been listening to you. And con¬ sistently adding all the features you need to get your job done easier. Take our new Microsoft Excel 4,0 for instance. We have just added floating Toolbars. Including six new ones which sensibly relate to a set of tasks, such as charting. You can move them around, resize them, and cus¬ tomize them with very little effort. With Drag and Drop, you can “grab” any piece of information with your mouse and drop it in wherever you’d like to see it on-screen. No need to cut-and-paste. Unless you want to. Autofill intelligently helps you build a worksheet.Type JAN in a cell, for instance, and Autofill enters FEB, MAR-as many months as you need. It will even replicate formulas. And now wed like you to meet Wizards, step-by-step guides that are designed to walk you through com¬ plex tasks. The CrosstabWizard, for example, creates summary tables from lists of infor¬ mation for you. It prompts you, takes all the information you’ll give it, and constructs the per¬ fect report. See, it really is that easy. Speaking of easy, we’ve added a feature to help you manage and organ¬ ize your work a lot more efficiently They’re called Workbooks, and with them you’ll be able to group all of your related work¬ sheets under a sin- The bottom tine is simple. ft r s never been easier for you to create smart, mpm$ive*lQvking spreadsheets in no time fiat © 1992 Mtcrowfl Corporation.

About MacUser Glasnost Man I t seems like only yesterday: DOS was the cornerstone of an Evil Empire, bent on world domination, shackling brain¬ washed subjects to an inhumane system. Bui today, Seulley and Gates are having their pictures taken together and those brainwashed DOS users have become a market opportunity. Apple's new openness toward Microsoft, Windows, DOS, and PCs is more than just political rhetoric, Apple has taken several steps to make it real: * Releasing Macintosh PC Exchange, software that lets Macs recog n izc DO S - form at ted disks. * Designing VITAL, a scheme for integrating Macs into enterprise wide systems of Macs, PCs, and mainframes. * Developing OCE, a cross-platform mes¬ saging system, * Writing, through its software subsidiary, Claris, Windows ver- s ton s of applications. * Entering into a joint venture with IBM to develop a brand new operating system that will run on multiple platforms. For John Rizzo, the author of our new ‘'Mac to PC\" column, this gittsnost comes none loo soon. As Mac User's technical editor for the past four years. John has learned every' trick in the book for gelling PCs and Macs to talk to one another. In fact, John wrote the book [MacUser Guide to Connectivity, Emeryville, Ca I i fo rn i a: Z i ff-D av i s Press, 1992; $2 7.95), N o w he' s loo k i ng ahead to a future when tricks won't be necessary to gel Maes and PCs to communicate, A great deal still needs to he done before that future becomes a reality. An infrastructure needs to be put into place, but it’s gelling closer, ‘It's now easier than ev er to make Macs and PCs work together,” John says. And in the near future, not only will H be easier to justify bringing a Mac into a DOS-oriented office but it also wilt be easier to use it once if s there. John is quick to point out that he intends to treat platforms objectively in his new column, which, in addition to Mae-to- PC connectivity, will also cover UNIX and RISC platforms. \"I'm not a Mac bigot. Believe it or not. there are some things the PC is better suited for.'* For example, it may be possible to find DOS programs for highly specialized tasks when nothing Mac-based is available; also if s still a lot easier to program for DOS than for the Mac (or for Windows). But expect John to maintain a healthy skepticism about the very idea of cross-platform products. \"I hope to dispel some myths about cross-platform compatibility and point out when working across platforms is not the best solution to a problem. Sometimes using a separate product that connects platforms is the better way to go,\" ^ Mac User technical editor and connectivity columnist John Rizzo will be helping improve foreign relations with his detailed advice on how to get Macs and PCs talking to one another. 10 November 1992 MacUser rn™> Bring your graphics up to speed.

It looks like Latin, but where did it come from? Did software companies sit down and say/OK, we're alt going to use this Latin phrase in our ads/?\" Relax, Rob: the use of pseudo-Latin phrases to flesh out dummy layouts predates the computer industry. (Strangely, for reasons known Only to William Satire, it's known as greeking.) Meaningless text is used, presumably, so you won't be distracted by any actual content in the layout: we understand that software ads in the Vatican (and other Latin-speaking countries) use text from the speeches of Dan Quayle instead.

Many of us use word processors only to produce simple documents or enve¬ lopes. Whenever we want to do some¬ thing fancy with text, we feed the docu¬ ment into a page-layout program, where control of columns, leading, graphics, drop caps, and so forth, is far easier and more precise. This means that most of us use Microsoft Word, although we don't use 90 percent of its features, because it is the only word-processing program that converses fluently with the page-layout programs. I’d love to use a simpler word proces¬ sor, such as WriteNow, rather than a bloated behemoth such as Word. But WriteNow doesn’t work well with Quark¬ XPress, so I’m stuck. Allan S. Hjcrpe Sevierville, TN Whv can’t someone produce a modu¬ lar word-processing program so that each of us can buy just the features we need? I don’t need RAM-eating features such as tables, tables of contents, indexes, painting tools, and outliners. Those of us who write letters, poetry, or articles would like a simple word processor that pro¬ vides quality typography. We need an editable kerning table for each typeface, and the kerning values that are built in to typefaces should be used by the word- processing program. We should be able to select (in units) the word spacing we prefer and have a choice of fixed spaces, such as cm and cn. We should be able to letterspace a line and to indicate automatic hanging indents and hanging punctuation. These features, and many that are al¬ ready available, should be available as options, just as power brakes and air bags are options when you buy a car. It’s ridiculous that desktop publishers invest thousands of dollars in machines that are little better than a manual type¬ writer. With so many quality typefaces available, we should be able to send out a decent-looking letter. Walt Abbott Yamell, AZ Easy Does It I find it amusing that a Mac magazine would look at an icon-based environ¬ ment, namely Double Helix, and use the words “easier for beginners’’ several times in describing it (“Database Strate¬ gies: Relational Databases,” June ’92, Buyer’s Guide page 60). If something is easy for beginners, it’s usually easier for normal users, power users, and even programmers. That’s why I use the Mac instead of a PC. That’s why I use Think C instead of MPW. And that’s why I use Double Helix instead of 4th Dimension. With the Mac’s visual interface. I can learn an application once, not use it again for a year, and then pick it up again with little loss of capability. I can’t do that with a command-line interface such as DOS. I can’t do that with 4D*s proce¬ dural language, but I can do that with Double Helix. Dan Kuclita Brockport, NY Not-So-Easy Publishing I’d like to add a strong warning to your review of Publish It! Easy, which appeared in the June issue (page SI). I was unable to install the program and suspected IN1T conflicts. Sure enough. Timeworks’ technical support told me the program has major conflicts with at least nine INITs, and the only solution is to get rid of them permanently. If you reinstall the INITs, problems can crop up and cause you to lose saved data. I appreciate the honesty and straight¬ forward responses of the Timeworks technical people but question why this problem has never, at least to my knowl¬ edge, been documented. When you expect a good product — based on a four-and-a-half-mouse rating — and are disappointed, it’s like getting a Mc¬ Donald’s burger at The Four Seasons. Thomas A. Huebner Hillsdale, NY It's impossible to test every combina¬ tion of INITs yvitli a particular program. I had 15 INITs installed and encoun¬ tered no problems with Publish It!

The Sound and the Fury As a musician and MIDI evangelist, I was glad to see the three music-software reviews (Pro Tools [page 89] and SoundEdit Pro and AudioTrax [page 66]) in the September issue, but I was very disappointed after t read them. Your evaluation of Pro Tools was far too optimistic. Although the concept is very exciting, the software is not only inordinately buggy but much of the user interface is also very badly thought-out. The reviews of Sound Edit Pro and AudioTrax contained some factual er¬ rors. Although Sound Ed it Pro can open high-fidelity 16-bit Files, it can't play them on any existing 16-hit hardware, so they come out sounding just like old- fashioned 8-bit, 22-kilohertz files. Older versions of SoundEdit could do exactly the same thing. And the program's per¬ formance is quirkier than the reviewer would have us believe — the sound skips and jumps unacceptably under numer¬ ous circumstances, not just the one he describes. AudioTrax can play 64 — not just 16 — tracks at a time. I also disagree that 8- bit audio is \"barely acceptable” for voice¬ overs — from the Mac's speaker, yes, but with decent outboard speakers, it is more than acceptable not only for voice but also for sound effects and even back¬ ground music. Reviewing AudioTrax and SoundEdit Pro together was an excellent idea, be¬ cause they complement each other very well, but your reviewer seemed to miss the point of this synergy and merely com¬ plained that AudioTrax doesn't provide any effects. In my experience, they are highly complementary tools for creating low-budget audio for multimedia. Paul 1). Lehrman via ZiffNet/Mac Check Mate 1 have been using Check Free (“Cheek Ei Out,\" September '92. page 29) for three years and have had no problems with it. This service has become a groat tool for me. I travel extensively, and the ability to schedule payments ahead of time is wonderful Also, you should check out vour math: The $9 charge for every 20 transactions works out to $3.20 when you subtract the savings on postage. Try to find an ac¬ countant who will write 20 checks for $3.20 a month! Perhaps Andy Ihnatko needs to spend less time watching the Disney Channel and more on research. Kenneth O'Neill Bedford, TX C inon, Andy. If CheckFree'sourbig- gest problem as Mac consumers, maybe wc don’t need a consumer advocate. Andy's biggest hassle with CheckFree seems to be the cost; lie must have a deal with the postal service to deliver his mail free. By the time you add in postage and the cost of a check (my wallet checks, for instance, cost $20 for 200), 20 checks cost $7.80. That's only $1.20 less than what you describe as CheckFree s “phe¬ nomenally slick service.” That's if you write your checks by hand, which means you either waste a lot of time duplicating effort or you use your Mac as a hat rack. Laser checks are even more expensive, and you have to buy envelopes for them, so you probably would come out ahead using CheckFree. People who have had delayed posting of payments and other such problems probably didn't follow CheckFree’s ad¬ vice: During the first month or so, send your payments early and then check with the merchant to see when it gets pasted and use that information to time your payments. If Andy feels compelled to send all Ins checks at the last minute, you probably aren't paying him enough.

JON ZILBER The Winning Platform Two of the hottest issues of this political season — change and the economy — should be part of your own desktop- policy platform. N owhere in the Constitution does il say a word about computers: your Macintosh is not endowed with an inalienable right to democratic representa¬ tion. On the other hand, the person sitting in front of your Mac — that's you — is going to find life, liberty, and the pursuit of reliable backups a whole lot simpler if you make sure that the unelected officials in charge of your computer network are implementing policies that have your best interests in mind. And as in the presidential campaigns, the key issues are familiar themes: die need for change and improving the economy. Loose Change Several policy issues revolve around the issue of change. In most cases, users operate with what you might call a loose-change policy, both because change happens seren- dipitously and because nobody's willing to spend more than loose change k> tighten things up. How do you decide when it's lime to make changes in your Mac system? When is it lime to upgrade your CPU? Should you opt for the latest and greatest upgrade of your applica¬ tions? When should you switch to a compet¬ ing application? In a group of any size, there's bound to he some political friction. On 6m end of Jie political spectrum arc the liberal! icchnoc^ts, whose Macs arc in a constant Jtpvt of] flux— and chaos — thanks to a steady die i of bifggy new software and hardware. At the opposite end are the utiraconservaiive Luddites, who favor stable, tried, and true — but hopelessly antiquated — products such us the I28K Mac and MacWrile 1,0, The network manager — or whoever the involuntarily elected official is for your workgroup — has to manage the political rivalry between the different user parties. The most common solution to the schism between liberals and conservatives is the Jib- erinrian approach: If s your desk t tip; you con¬ trol your own destiny. But the libertarian approach fails on sev¬ eral counts. 11 fails to ensure that the conser¬ vative users will get the best possible use from an expensive investment. It fails to pre¬ vent wannabe power users from getting in over their heads to the point where they're losing data and overly taxing the technical- support crew. And it totally fails if your work requires collaborative input from all parties. Going for the Gold At MacUser, our solution is to use a \"Golden\" system and a folder of \"Golden 1 * applications. The Golden System folder con¬ tains the latest officially sanctioned version of the system, including all officially sanc¬ tioned extensions, fonts, INITs, and so on. Likewise, die Golden Application folder in¬ cludes the latest of Ileal ly sanctioned version of all officially sanctioned applications. All production-oriented work is done with Golden software only. Only problems that arise from Golden software are officially troubleshot by our tireless network manager, Stephan Somogyi, who also ensures that all software in the Golden folders is legit — that we have the appropriate site license for each new version of anything that goes into these folders. Nothing goes Golden until it's been thoroughly tested for compatibility with the rest of the Golden network at MacUser and at the various service bureaus to which we transfer files. Anyone on the network is free to install other applications or to run their system un¬ der alternative system software, but anything that's headed off their desktop has to be Golden. This isn't a perfect solution. After Micro¬ soft Word 5 w as released — hut before it had been certified Gold — many of our editors upgraded immediately. Before dropping files onto our production server, they diligently opened the documents and saved them from within Word 4. because Word 4 was the Golden version. Word thought those files were version 4 files. Unfortunately, Page¬ Maker knew the difference between a native Word 4 file and a pseudo-Word 4 file, giving our Golden system a severe case of hiccups uinti) wl finally upgraded the Golden sys¬ tem to accommodate Word 5), In Case of Emergency Tin;(network manager should also formu¬ late and communicate contingency plans for crisis management; What happens when things go wrong? Does your software entitle you to technical support from its publisher? Should users make the phone call, or should they mute it through the network manager? Do your users know the phone numbers? Do they know what kind of information they'll need to give the tech-support person on the other end ? Do they know their applications' names, versions, and serial numbers?

Until such devices are widely available (or until business cards routinely come with com¬ puter-readable magnetic stripes on them, like those of credit cards), the publishers of PIM (personaI-information manage¬ ment) software have an opportunity to bolster their business by providing such a service for you. The PIM publishers make the mistake of trying to sell you PIM software. You don’t buy PIM software because you like PIM software; you buy it because what you really want is data. But none of the software publishers are trying to sell you that. Instead of just selling you an empty da la base, they should bundle a ticket in with the software that entitles you to send them a shoe box of. say. 500 business cards and get them back on a floppy. Or they might include a coupon good for a discount when you call your local Kelly Temps service to scan or enter that shoe box of cards in your own office.

ANDY IHNATKO Performance Anxiety To make sure you actually get the performance you’re paying for, you’ve got to know what the computer- advertising gobbledygook really means. N o one warns to be slow. Throughout humanity's experience of selling things to itself, few phrases have caused consumers to whip out checkbooks and wallets faster than this one: ki 0urs is faster.\" It doesn't matter what you're trying to sell — ears, antacid tablets, sacks of wet peal moss — if you can somehow suggest that shoppers buying your product can go to bed half an hour earlier than those who bought Brand X, hang* you have a sale. So when someone in a school yard tries to use that magic phrase on you* be afraid Be very, very afraid. It’s usually that most in¬ sidious of lies, the lie that has a nugget of truth hidden inside it somewhere. The key to evaluating speed claims is in recognizing what kind or speed the manufacturer is talk¬ ing about and then deciding whether you can actually reap any benefit from it. 1 can think of at least three technologies where the faster- must-be-better argument tries to separate you from your sawhucks: modems, accelerators, and new CPUs* Let's look at them in the approximate order of the amount of money you could end up wasting. Probably the most blatant speed-we asel- ing is in advertisements Tor modems. With connect charges for some commercial on¬ line services running at $12.50 an hour and up, telecommunications is one area in which lime truly is money. The money you spend for a faster modem will almost certainly be absorbed by the money you save on your monthly bill eventually, hut be sure you're really buying a high-speed modem. If the modem features V.32 or V.32bis, it’s the real McCoy, Those are two internal tonal stan¬ dards for high-speed telecom, with V.32 of¬ fering speeds as high as 9,600 bps and V.32bis going all the way to 14,4 Kbps. If the ad reads f ’9,600 bps! $28! if\" without mention¬ ing these standards* though, hang on to your money. One popular dodge is to advertise a high-speed fax modem as being 9,600 bps, but the top speed applies only to fax trans¬ mission; as a standard data modem, it might give you a top speed of only 2,400 bps. The second weaselish technique is to advertise the phrase \"9,600 bps!\" in big letters and the word 'throughput\" in tiny type nearby. Don't be fooled by a modem that touts V.42bis dam compression (unless it also features the V.32 or V.32bis modulation protocol), which theoretically can transmit four times as much data at 2,400 bps as an ordinary modem can; in reality the speed increase is anywhere from nothing to two limes normal, and anyway* II Just Ain’t the Real Thing. Even if you do have the real thing, don't count on being able to use the higher speeds with commercial pay-as-you-play on-line ser¬ vices, As of this writing, America Online offers only 2,400-bps access and Compu¬ Serve's access *system makes any speed greater than 9,600 impossible* CompuServe also doubles its usual 2,400-bps hourly charges for 9,600-bps users. It's still a bar¬ gain — operate four limes as fast for only twice as much — but if you spend most of your time idly reading messages as opposed to downloading files, you could actually wind up paying more every month. With these modem-speed claims, it’s a simple situation; you recognize a company's blatant attempts to flimflam you, so you avoid 'em like glazed yams on Thanksgiving. When the subject is speed enhancements for your Mac, things get dicier. There’s a bewildering array of speed enhancements for any Mac — you can pay anywhere from tens to thou¬ sands of dollars for them, and about all of them actually work to some extern. The first thing a salesperson is likely to shove in your face — naturally, the most expensive of the lot—is an accelerator board. Whether you plug it in as an expansion board or clip it on as a daughterboard to an ancient Mac, i t 1 s a sel f-con tained m ic rop roces sor that takes the place of whatever brain was origi¬ nally installed in your computer. All too of¬ ten, salespeople tout the speed of the new microprocessor as the sole sledgehammer proof that you’d be a complete fool to stick with your old hardware. There’s a grain of truth to this. On a test bench, a 33-megahertz 68030 can work much faster than a 16-mega- hertz model, but to paraphrase a Vulcan prov¬ erb, “CPU speed is only the sian of enhanced performance, not the end.\" First of all, the speed of a CPU is only one component of The Big Picture; many other elements of your system can have a serious impact on your Mac’s performance. Second, you've got to take into account what I cull The Duhhh Factor, The Duhhh Factor For those who are into high-octane graph¬ ics processing, ninja-level number crunch¬ ing, and the like, an accelerator board (or a new Mac with a faster processor) will help Macdser November 1992 31 fti/i put dip art in it * U 4 f GtW I\\vt Script * Type 1 itm* Zrw Type */t mL* tin unuuifhj ikpth ,y dtftmctrr, automntuaihp It's about [imL\\ I n t roauc i ng Add De pt h. t he first program that adds depth to the same drawing technology used in Adobe I llustrator^and Aldus Freehand® Its last, its easy and, at only $179, it's a flat-out bargain, 800 ■248*0800 r RifOdlAM A$Datki*ii I ni A e mar kdUmun, Inc, .‘UT t'tbrr /rttlM fuitfw.r ,m (if /vjL'IffrJ mu btutdka ifibrir mptrtii* W- CtRCLE 73 OK READER SERVICE CARD. loads; otherwise. The Duhhh Factor will rob you of most of the benefits of the speed enhancement. For most of you, as you go about your business doing non- intensive word processing, dutahasing, spreadsheeting, and all those other things you promised your boss, spouse, or both you'd do with your computer, the Mac spends more time wailing for you than you spend waiting for the Mac, Overall system performance of your I lei will shoot into the stratosphere if you up¬ grade to a 50-megahertz 68030, but that gain can be completely annihilated when you spend two seconds at the end of a sentence trying to Figure out how you should finish the paragraph. Instead of waiting for you in 25-megahertz cycles, it's waiting for you in 50-megahertz cycles. Right here, trying for a good joke that never came, I would’ve wasted roughly $ 1,800 in upgrades. A variant of the faster-processor sale is the different processor. The 69000 chip begat the 68020, which fathered the 68030. and now we have the 68040. With new processors comes the usual rum¬ bling chant of \"More power! More power! More power!\" Generally, though, greater speed isn't the primary benefit of The Latest CPU, For instance, adding a 68030 to your Mac I I will probably speed things up, but the chip's true benefit will be your newfound ability to use 32-bit addressing and virtual memory under System 7. Equally confusing to some is the pros¬ pect of a malli coprocessor. Call it a floating-point unit, cal! it a 68882 chip — whatever its name, for those Macs that accept one, it'll be wonderfully cheap and powerful for a few people and only won de rfu 11 y dieap for e ve rvo no e I sc. It’s a processor dedicated lo the task of deep math operations, performing floating¬ point arithmetic much faster than your CPU can and freeing it up to work on other things while the 68882 chugs ai the a n s we r. Unlike an ace e le ra tor boa id o r a new processor, it doesn't uniformly en¬ hance system performance. As you might guess, the bene tits are striking if you’re doing lots of math-intensive stuff — working with spreadsheet programs comes to mind, but don't forget that graphics programs such as Illustrator, Free Hand, and especially Photoshop do extensive number twiddling — but the speed increase will be almost negligible if you're chiefly a database seareh-and- retrieve type. If you upgrade lo a faster processor or a different processor entirely, add a cache card and a math coprocessor, then surely you'll have all the bases covered, won't you? Negatory. The benefits of all that stuff you bought can be completely off¬ set by something as simple as having too little memory. Because most applications make up for low memory by keeping elements of themselves on your hard disk until needed, a Mac rocketed to Earth from the dying planet Krypton but con¬ taining only 4 megs of RAM is always in danger of having its doors blown off by a far less capable machine that has more memory. Always remember, then, that no matter how much you spend, no mai¬ ler how much junk you install and how powerful your final system is, any speed increase is wily hypothetical it mil vent do your daily business with the upgrades installed. It's vitally important to try' out a product with the exact same software you count on every day. working on the exact same documents w'ith the same amount of RAM. You'll read all kinds of boasts in a product's literature —a many dliry stones, that long for a sieve, so many MIPS — but these are just dry tests that may reveal nothing about how well the product performs iu real life. Further¬ more, a True to Life test may bring to light incompatibilities between the prod¬ uct and your software. It's a true bum¬ mer to get your Mac Classic back from the dealer after a permanent upgrade has been installed and then find that the only software you can run is the Finder and sometimes, maybe, the Calculator DA. My Two Cents' Worth The lesson to be learned from all this is that you should treat every speed claim with the utmost suspicion. Never pull om the checkbook or start reading off credit-card numbers until you've lested whatever it is with the software and Hies you use every day and. if applicable, on a hardware configuration similar Lo the one you use. It's just as important to recognize that a gizmo that makes your Mac work faster won’t necessarily make you work faster. You have to find out where the bottle¬ necks in your system are and crush them mercilessly. You can solve some prob¬ lems by upgrading to a Quadra 950, You can solve others more cheaply by buying a dorm fridge for your office so you won’t have to go downstairs to the kitchen every time you want a Coke. 32 November 1992 MacUser Compile and analyze feedback from among the 250,000 current users for a completely new version of MacProject'.
