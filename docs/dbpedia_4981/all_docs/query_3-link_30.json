        "text": "January 01, 2012 (Obertsdorf, Germany) – Marit Bjoergen (NOR) finally grabbed top step on the podium besting Justyna Kowalczyk (POL) in the women’s 10km Skiathlon (5CL+5FR) with a late afternoon start on New Year’s day. Therese Johaug (NOR) claimed third as she also wrestled with Kowalczyk during the race.\n\nFor USA’s Kikkan Randall is was another fabulous finish as she catapulted herself from 19th at the exchange to a stellar 7th at the finish and is now 4th overall.”I’m psyched with another good race today,” Randall told SkiTrax.”My strategy was to go out and try to hang in the top 10 on the classic and move up from there. The pace out of the start however was super hard and I was slipping on the climbs. So I think I drifted back a little farther than I wanted too.\n\n“I was feeling really good and just trying to move up. I had no idea where I was sitting in the pack and was just focused on catching the skiers ahead of me. There was a group of three way ahead, about 100m, going into the big climb on the final lap. I was initially more focused on skiing away from the pack I was with but ended up catching those 3 by the top of the hill.\n\n“Unfortunately I made a bad passing choice around Roponen at the top of the hill, going to the outside while Kalla and Sarasoja went on the inside. So I missed getting in their draft on the downhill and then didn’t have enough room to catch them on the home stretch.” Randall’s strong day moved her up one spot from 5th to 4th as skiers hit the first rest day.\n\nDuring the classic portion Kowalczyk and Johaug duked it out up front as Bjoergen dangled behind with Kristin Stoermer\n\nSteira as the four broke away from the pack and never looked back. Kowalczyk hit the exchange first but the others were all close behind. Bjoergen left her attack late in the game and by the 9.4km bonus Kowalczyk still looked strong and took the top spot with Johaug second and Bjoergen third as Steira got dropped.\n\nIt was now time for the Norwegian star to put up or take a backseat to her Polish rival again. As Bjoergen surged to victory Kowalczyk and Johaug battled for second with Kowalczyk edging out the Norwegian for the second spot on the podium.\n\nRandall’s teammates Liz Stephen and Holly Brooks finished 36th and 58th respectively – not at good as they both would have liked but they survived four gruelling days at the Tour.\n\n“I had a great start to the race and my skis were working wonderfully going up the first hill. Then, all of a sudden, all the girls in front of me started “power-plowing” and I felt like I was going to run directly into them. I felt like I had to plow too and then caught my ski in the slush. I think I did a somersault but am not sure.\n\n“I can’t believe I didn’t break anything… but the fall left me somewhat hopeless for the rest of the race. I kept fighting to catch back up to a pack but that’s tough when you’re trying to conserve energy. I’m excited to head to Italy tomorrow (it will be my first time) and it’s great to see Kikkan doing so well. Happy New Year…”\n\nKowalczyk continues to lead with a 26.6s margin over Bjoergen in second with Johaug in third at 1:06, Randall in 4th at 3:02 and Aino-Kaisa Saarinen (FIN) in 5th at 3:04. Stephen sits in 37th and Brooks is 58th overall.\n\nSo how will Randall spend her day off from the office? “We’re driving to Toblach in the morning and will settle into our hotel and then ski after lunch. Going to experiment with some intervals this year instead of just skiing easy. I felt like my body shut down a little bit on the rest days last year. Other than that, some coffee, and maybe a movie with my teammates and then back at it!”\n\nStay tuned for more action from the Tour de Ski…\n\nWomen’s Skiathlon results HERE.\n\nWomen’s Skiathlon results detail HERE.\n\nWomen’s TdS Overall HERE.\n\nJanuary 01, 2012 (Obertsdorf, Germany) – It was another tough day on Saturday for the classic sprints with rain and snow and slippery tracks as several top skiers took a tumble including the USA’s Kikkan Randall, Sweden’s Emil Joennson and Petter Northug (NOR). Here are more skier comments and some great photos from yesterday’s action…\n\nJustyna Kowalczyk (POL) © NordicFocus\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) © NordicFocus\n\n(l-r) Kalla (SWE) and Randall (USA) © NordicFocus\n\nMarit Bjoergen (NOR) © NordicFocus\n\nVesna Fabjan (SLO) © NordicFocus\n\nJustyna Kowalczyk (POL) © NordicFocus\n\nAurore Jean (FRA) © NordicFocus\n\nNatalia Korosteleva (RUS) © NordicFocus\n\n(l-r) Ingemarsdotter (SWE) and Bjoergen (NOR) © NordicFocus\n\nJustyna Kowalczyk (POL) © NordicFocus\n\nDevon Kershaw (CAN)\n\nI am feeling in great shape, and my skis were fast, but I was cut off on the second hill. Simple as that. I’m 11th and I’m not happy.\n\nAlex Harvey (CAN)\n\nI made a mistake on the far corner just before the last uphill where I had a bit of contact with a Russian skier that shot me wide and killed my speed. I passed one guy coming down the stretch which got me in a photofinish for third. It looks like I was only two centimetres from being the lucky loser, which is a bit of a bummer. I had to re-accelerate after that mistake in the corner and then it was too late.\n\nKris Freeman (USA)\n\nMy energy was good today. I wanted more but I was two seconds from qualifying which is not a bad day. The Tour has a bigger field this year with more pure sprinters competing which is making qualifying more difficult. The TdS is hard but it is hard for everyone. We have a great masseuse with us, Stephe, who is working wonders for us. In some ways my body feels better than when I started. My strategy tomorrow is to stay with the lead group in the classic and to pass it on the last lap of the skate.\n\nHolly Brooks (USA)\n\nThe wrist was better today than yesterday. Shorter race – the hills helped. Double poling is the worst… (Double poling along with slippery skis making yesterday really, really tough). Other than the injury, I really liked the course and the hills suit my classic sprinting strength well.\n\nI can honestly say that today was also one of the WETTEST days of skiing I’ve ever had. Probably wetter than most in Vancouver, even. Tomorrow is supposed to be warmer, with more precip. I’m curious to know what that will look like. We’ve been advised to bring every piece of dry clothing possible. I wish I could have gotten a picture of Chris Grover [US Head Coach] in his trash bag dress for you….\n\nEnergy-wise I’m feeling fine and looking forward to fatigue setting in on the field. After a rough start to the Tour I’m anxious for the opportunity to move up in the field.\n\nOur team had a small New Years celebration complete with bottle rockets. Today is also Kikkan’s birthday so it was a festive occasion! Tomorrow’s women’s race doesn’t start until 3:45pm – it might even be getting dark towards the finish, who knows.\n\nHappy New Year to everyone\n\nSimi Hamilton (USA)\n\nYeah, today was a bit frustrating, but it seems like I’ve had a couple of days like that this year so I’m really trying to focus on things that I can improve in my training so that I can consistently ski top-ten qualifers in both skate and classic. With that said, I think my classic sprinting has improved and I’m making gains in the right direction. To me that’s really encouraging and I am psyched to keep making the improvements that need to be made.\n\nToday was totally nuts. It rained super hard all day at about +2C and tomorrow is supposed to be even warmer and wetter. I really liked the course – very straight forward and smooth and both big uphills ski really well. I would have liked to have skied a little more relaxed and found some more speed in my glide today. I’m already looking forward to skiing this sprint course again next year. There’s a lot of racing left this week, so I am going to recover from today and hopefully string together some good racing in the next few days.\n\nI am fairly psyched with yesterday’s Pursuit and thought I skied the challenging course smart and climbed the uphills well. I’m really bummed that I crashed on the biggest downhill on my fourth lap – there was a track that had a huge wobble in it and it just fed one ski into the other when I had my head down in my tuck. I think I lost some pretty valubale time there, but all and all, I’m happy with the gains that I’ve made in my classic skiing and recognize there’s a lot more to be made.\n\nHappy New Year…\n\nDecember 30, 2011 (Obertsdorf, Germany) – Tough conditions greeted the worlds best xc skiers on Day Two at the Tour de Ski. Here’s a selection of quotes and photos as the USA’s Kikkan Randall nailed her best-ever classic result in the women’s 10km Classic Pursuit placing 6th as Poland’s Justyna Kowalcyzk strengthened her grip on the overall lead with her second consecutive win. In the men’s 15km CL it was local star Axel Teichmann from Germany who took over the series lead with his strategic victory on Stage 2 of the Tour while Devon Kershaw (CAN) lead the North American men in 15th.\n\n10km CL Pursuit Women’s PHOTOS\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) – 6th in the 10km CL Pursuit\n\nI knew I would be starting with a strong group of skiers that usually finish in the top ten so I wanted to try and hang with them as long as possible. At this point I’m more focused on testing my limits than skiing too conservatively early in the race.\n\nThe pace was pretty frantic from the start as usual and with big differences in skis, it felt like there were a lot of skiers going back and forth. It finally started to settle down going into the 2nd lap and I could still see the lead pack not too far in front. My skis were working well in some places and not in others so I just tried to stay in the group.\n\nSki selection was really tricky today. I was testing both zeros and hardwax and with 10 min until start I still couldn’t decide what to do. It seemed like the conditions were changing every few mins. The snow picked up again so Peter [Vordenberg – coach] and I decided on the zeros with 8 min to go. I didn’t have perfect skis out there but they were decent enough and relatively consistent through the race to allow me to use my fitness.\n\nI still felt pretty strong on the last lap and tried to move up in my group. We weren’t really working together but we weren’t fighting each other either. I made a move with 400m to go and just focused on staying ahead of the others to the finish. I had no idea we were fighting for 6th.\n\nHolly Brooks (USA) – 6th in the 10km CL Pursuit\n\nToday was really, really tough for me. Skis were tricky for everyone but I seemed to be slipping more than most. I was on zeros, like most of the field and they were kicking much better during warm up. Other girls commented that the conditions were different each lap we skied and I agree.\n\nI had hoped that my wrist was on the mend after it was feeling better yesterday but as it turns out, double poling and slipping on my skis (catching with arms) is pretty much the worst thing for it. The only thing I could do today was try to not loose too much ground – and hope for a better day tomorrow and the next.\n\nLiz Stephen (USA) – 29th in the 10km CL Pursuit\n\nI had a solid race today, got a good, clean start and then just began picking people off where I could. I love the pursuit style race starts, as it so often gives you a great mix of people to ski with. Some are better at the technique or race distance of the day and come back to you, others come past you and provide a good ride. It’s a really engaging kind of race.\n\nMy goal today was never to go so hard up a hill that I was totally smoked and couldn’t ski well over the top. Up the last hill under the bridge I went past Astrid Jacobsen and a German girl and knew from a split Chris Grover [head coach] had given me going into the last lap that I had been in 31st, so was now in 29th. I really wanted to be in the points, so I hammered under the bridge and then was pretty worked over all the way to the finish, but was able to hold the two girls off, so I was really psyched.\n\nThe skis were challenging today, especially in certain sections of the course, as the conditions were fairly variable throughout the course. Days like this are such good practice for me as an athlete, because I can get really stressed out when the skis during testing don’t come together right away. I have figured out how to stay calm and trust that the skis will be good.\n\nOur wax techs are really good at their jobs and even when it is a tough day and it is down to the wire to get good skis, it is rare when they don’t figure it out for us. I went into the start pen knowing there would be some slippery places, and I would just fight fight fight the whole race. So, that’s what I did and the result turned out really solid for me. Now for the classic sprint tomorrow!! Eeek!!\n\n15km CL Pursuit Men’s PHOTOS\n\nFIS world cup cross-country, tour de ski, pursuit women, Oberhof (GER)\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) © Nordic Focus\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) © Nordic Focus\n\n(l) Petter Northug (NOR) and Maurice Manificat (FRA) © Nordic Focus\n\nDevon Kershaw (CAN) © Nordic Focus\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) and Ilia Chernousov (RUS) © Nordic Focus\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) © Nordic Focus\n\nAlex Harvey (CAN) © Nordic Focus\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) © Nordic Focus\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) © Nordic Focus\n\nMaurice Manificat (FRA) leading © Nordic Focus\n\nDevon Kershaw (CAN) © Nordic Focus\n\nMaurice Manificat (FRA) © Nordic Focus\n\nAlexander Legkov (RUS) © Nordic Focus\n\nMen's field © Nordic Focus\n\nMarcus Hellner (SWE) © Nordic Focus\n\n(l) Alex Harvey (CAN) and Devon Kershaw (CAN) © Nordic Focus\n\nIlia Chernousov (RUS) © Nordic Focus\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) © Nordic Focus\n\nDevon Kershaw (Can) – 15th in the Men’s 15km CL Pursuit\n\nThe body felt so good again today, it was really tricky with the conditions and I had to rely solely on my upper body for the last six kilometres. It was a bit frustrating, but that is the game of cross-country skiing. Our guys tried their best, but the temperatures warmed up and there’s nothing you can do. We have the best wax techs in the business, and this will motivate them for sure. It is frustrating, but tomorrow will be similar conditions and I know we’ll get it right. There are lots of races to go.\n\nAlex Harvey (Can) – 27th in the Men’s 15km CL Pursuit\n\nI couldn’t kick the skis today. When you don’t have kick you just work your arms so hard and blow up. I had nothing for the final two laps.\n\nJustin Wadsworth (Can) – Head Coach of the Canadian Cross-Country Ski Team\n\nWhen you face conditions like this, it’s kind of like playing the lottery. Sometimes you get it right and sometimes you don’t. Today we didn’t get it right, but that doesn’t happen to our team very often because we have some of the best wax techs in the world. But you can see the country’s that nailed it today.\n\nWith files from Cross Country Canada\n\nDecember 29, 2011 (Oberhof, Germany) – Norway’s Petter Northug fired warning shots signaling his full intention to finally win the Tour de Ski overall this year with a win in the men’s 4.1km Prologue, beating TdS arch rival Dario Cologna of Switzerland by 0.7 seconds. Northug, current leader in the World Cup overall standings, has been runner up at the Tour for the last three years.\n\nCologna, the defending Tour de Ski champion, settled for second today while France’s Maurice Magnificat showed a strong hand as well finishing third in today’s race. For North American fans Canada’s Alex Harvey powered to a very solid 6th place finish underscoring that he’s in contention as well.\n\n“When I heard I was fighting for the victory it gave me more power,” said Northug in a FIS XC interview after the race. He cautioned not to place too much emphasis on today’s result however, and clearly has his sights fixed on winning the overall title: “I don’t think anyone will remember who won the Prologue in Oberhof when we’re standing at top of Alpe Cermis,” he added.\n\nCanada’s three-man team also had an excellent start to the Tour. On his way to 6th place Harvey was indeed challenging for a podium spot in the closing metres of the race before fading slightly prior to hitting the finishline. Harvey was pleased with his result nonetheless. “Any time you’re in the top 10 in the world you can’t allow yourself to be disappointed,” he told SkiTrax by phone earlier today, “so I’m really happy … it doesn’t mean much for the Tour in the overall, but it’s a good sign of where my shape is at.”\n\n“Pacing is important, you know, you don’t want to start too hard, because you don’t want to blow up near the end, but you have to start pretty fast and not give up time early on. For me I always tend to start a bit conservative, but today I tried to go a little bit harder and I was 13th at the first time check and for me that’s quite a fast start, usually I’m around 20th, so it was good aggressive start for me.”\n\nHarvey was leading, in fact, going into the final kilometre of the race, but with fatigue settling during the final metres he lost a second or two. “Coming into the finish I got a little tight and probably lost some time, I was just getting really tight and unstable because I was giving it everything I had.”\n\nHarvey’s teammate Devon Kershaw, meanwhile, finished a very solid 12th on the day. Kershaw started slowly and was skiing in 31st position at the 1.7km interval before accelerating on the 2nd lap and making up 19 positions to finish in 12th. While he was a little frustrated with his pacing Kershaw was still “…happy to have made up a lot of time in the last part of the course and obviously I’m super happy to be in 12th and happy with the way the body felt.”\n\nIn terms of strategy for the day Kershaw told SkiTrax: “I was just trying to keep a level head and ski ‘big’ and smooth and powerful and then in the latter part of the course really attack, attack, attack and push really hard into the downhills to carry my speed through.”\n\nIvan Babikov was further back, but still managed a personal best for the Prologue, finishing in 38th position.\n\nAndy Newell led the American men with a 29th place finish. “Maybe the hardest WC point I’ve ever scored today,” he later tweeted. Newell was skiing as high as 18th at the first interval, but lost time near the finish as he started to fatigue. “I felt ok today,” Newell told us, “and was having a pretty good race up until the last few hundred meters and then really blew up and lost a lot of time.”\n\n“Sometimes that’s just the way Prologues go,” he continued, “pacing is so important in these races and if you don’t nail it just right it can be tough. But I recovered pretty well after the race and I’m still feeling ready to go for tomorrow.”\n\nNewell was followed by teammates Simi Hamilton and Kris Freeman, who came in 63rd and 64th respectively. Hamilton, who finished 10th in the Rogla sprint race before Christmas, was a little disappointed after fighting somewhat with the icy conditions. “Today went alright, not great,” he commented by email post-race. “It was really fast and icy and although that has sometimes suited me well in the past, I struggled with balance and power application a bit today. It was a tough course for sure… one that will be helpful to be familiar with in the coming years.”\n\n“I’m definitely looking forward to the rest of the races,” he continued “especially the sprints, and know that if things go my way and my body is feeling good I have the potential to ski well.”\n\nFreeman, who is looking to regain his form following a lacklustre entry to this season, said he started out too slowly, which he attributed to the fact that he has been in a rest and recovery phase recently: “I felt strong but very flat. Not surprising since I have focused more on rest than training in the past few weeks.”\n\nAfter going through the 1.7km split in 81st position, Freeman was able to make up a lot of ground, moving up a whopping 17 positions! “My strategy was to accelerate throughout the race which I did. My initial speed was just too slow. The conditions were very fast and the downhills were icy and a bit sketchy. I will learn a lot more about where I am at tomorrow.”\n\nFriday’s race features a 15km handicap start classic race, with Cologna heading out 5.7 seconds behind Northug. It will be fascinating to see if Northug choses to work with Cologna to maintain a gap on the field, as they did in Kuusamo, or allow the rest of the field to catch up. Either way, count on Northug to launch his trademark devastating kick in the closing metres, unless Cologna or someone else can dish out a surprise.\n\nTdS Overall top three:\n\n1. Petter Northug (NOR) 7:58.3\n\n2. Dario Cologna (SUI) +5.7\n\n3. Maurice Manificat (FRA) +14.0\n\nFull men’s prologue results HERE.\n\nDecember 28, 2011 (Oberhof, Germany) – The Viessmann FIS Tour de Ski looks destined to live up to what many have predicted is the most-anticipated event of the FIS cross-country race season. Now in its sixth year the TdS kicks off in Oberhof, Germany on December 29th and concludes on January 8th in Val di Fiemme, Italy.\n\nWith no World Championships or Winter Olympics this year, the gruelling multi-stage ski event, styled after the Tour de France has attracted most of the top cross-country skiers in the world.\n\nTough Races\n\nThis year’s instalment of the Tour de Ski features a total of nine stages conducted over 11 days at five different venues in two countries – Germany and Italy. The women will race a total of 60km, with the men doing 110km. The event begins in Oberhof on December 29th with a prologue in free technique, followed the next day with a handicap start race in classic technique – 10km for the women and 15km for the men. The Tour then moves to Oberstdorf for a classic sprint race on December 31st and short pursuit races on New Year’s Day.\n\nAfter a rest and travel day the athletes will spend three days competing in and around Toblach, Italy, beginning with a short distance interval race on January 3rd, followed by skate sprints on January 4th. The final day in Toblach will see the athletes compete in a long distance free technique race, with the men racing on a 35km point-to-point course between Cortina d’Ampezzo and Toblach, while the women will race three laps of a 5km course starting in the stadium in Toblach.\n\nAfter a second rest day on January 6th, the Tour will conclude in Val of Fiemme, Italy, with a classic mass start race over 10km (women) and 20km (men) on the 7th, and the gruelling final stage on the 8th, featuring the infamous final 3.7km climb up Alpe Cermis, during which competitors gain almost 1,500ft in elevation.\n\nIn addition to bragging rights as the world’s best overall skier, the participants in this year’s tour will be battling for World Cup points and prize money. Up for grabs will be 50 points for the winner of each stage, along with a rich prize of 400 points for the overall victory, meaning that whoever wins the TdS overall stands a very good chance of winning the overall World Cup title as well. Participants will compete over a purse of cash prizes worth a total of 720,000 Swiss francs as well!\n\nTeams and Contenders\n\nTeams from a total of 21 countries will contest this year’s Tour de Ski, ranging from Great Britain’s one-man team of Andrew Musgrave to the large German and Russian teams of 19 and 22 members respectively. The Swedes, Finns and Norwegians will also be there in force. A total of 186 athletes are officially registered, but like its namesake event, the Tour de France, we can expect a fair amount of attrition due to exhaustion and illness by the time the Tour ends on the slopes of Alpe Cermis.\n\nWhile the Norwegian duo of Marit Bjoergen and Petter Northug have dominated the World Cup for the last few seasons, neither has ever won the Tour de Ski. Northug has finished second for the last three years in a row. In fact, a Norwegian has yet to stand on the top step of the Tour de Ski podium, so both national as well as individual pride are on the line.\n\nBoth Bjoergen and Northug have set their sights firmly on overall Tour de Ski victories this year. Bjoergen has stayed away from the Tour in recent years in order to prepare for other events like the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver and last year’s Nordic World Championships in Oslo, but this year that her main goal is a victory in the Tour de Ski, just about the only prize she has yet to win in the sport. “It inspires me that this is what’s missing from my victory list, and that no Norwegians have won the Tour de Ski before,” Bjoergen told FIS XC in an interview yesterday.\n\nA raft of the world’s other top all-around skiers are similarly focused on the Tour. On the women’s side, Poland’s Justyna Kowalczyk will return to defend last year’s crown against Bjoergen and her teammate Therese Johaug, runner-up to Kowalczyk last year. Also in the hunt will be rising U.S. star Kikkan Randall, and Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla, a past Tour winner who is coming off a recent illness.\n\nSwitzerland’s Dario Cologna will be aiming for a third overall victory in the men’s race, but will be chased by Northug and former winner Lukas Bauer of the Czech Republic, along with Canada’s Devon Kershaw and Alex Harvey, both of whom finished in the top ten last year.\n\nThree-time runner-up Northug admits to frustration with his previous results but feels in a better position to win this year than in the past: “I know what has happened in recent years. Everything has been my own fault. It was miserable to be number two last year when I felt so vigorous at the end but I think I’m stronger in the final stage now,” he told FIS Cross Country.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Czech Head Coach, Miroslav Petrasek, Bauer “…will be fighting for top results. He will be personally unhappy to miss the podium; I would be disappointed if he is outside the top five,” Petrasek was quoted in the press earlier this week.\n\nMeanwhile, illness continues to take its toll on athletes as three more have recently dropped out of the Tour, including Norway’s Vibeke Skofterud and Martin Johnsrud-Sunby and Sweden’s Calle Halfvarsson.\n\nThe North Americans Teams\n\nA total of nine athletes from North America will contest this year’s Tour, the most ever. Canada will field a trio of strong men – Devon Kershaw, Alex Harvey and Ivan Babikov – while the USA will send a squad of six athletes consisting of Kikkan Randall, Liz Stephen, Holly Brooks, Andy Newell, Kris Freeman and Simi Hamilton. SkiTrax caught up to the Canadian and US Head Coaches by phone yesterday to talk about their teams’ hopes and expectations for the Tour this year.\n\nJustin Wadsworth – Canada\n\nOn the Canadian side, all three team members are capable of stage wins and top ten overall finishes. Kershaw and Babikov already have Tour stage wins to their credit, in 2011 and 2009 respectively, and all three have placed in the top ten overall at least once in previous years.\n\nCanadian Head Coach Justin Wadsworth expects even more from them at this year’s Tour. “Even though none of them have had a final podium yet I think that we’re in a better overall position than we were last year. I think all the guys are in better shape, they’ve all had at least one very good race under their belts this year that shows their fitness and it’s all been pretty recent, so I’m pretty excited. I think our goals as a team are still three in the top ten, and we’d really like to have guys get on the podium.”\n\nWadsworth made no secret of the fact that much of their past dryland season training was geared to preparation for the Tour de Ski, particularly the latter stages like the Alpe Cermis, where athletes like Alex Harvey have lost ground in the past. “The Tour is kind of our World Championships this year and so during a lot of the camps this year we really focussed on a lot of offset and working on steep uphill technique, with that in the back of our minds,” Wadsworth explained.\n\n“Ivan is one of the best steep off-setters out there, but with Devon and Alex it’s something they needed to work on and I feel like it’s something they both really improved on,” he continued.\n\nWadsworth said the hours of gruelling uphill work helped both with the mental as well as physical dimension of the Tour: “We did a lot of those long uphill rollerski sessions up the volcano in Hawaii from sea level to 10,000ft and when we did those we had the Tour in mind. With both the mental as well as physical challenge that the TdS poses it really helps their confidence to know they’ve done that in training.”\n\nWadsworth expects Kershaw and Harvey to challenge for podium positions on any given day of the Tour that they feeling good, but the biggest prize is to grab a piece of the final podium pie in the overall standings, something he feels is well within reach for both skiers.\n\n“For guys like Devon and Alex, they can do well in any stage, and if like last year we can just keep getting lots of top fives then they can just keep chipping away at the overall that way. They have the possibility to score sprint or distance podiums in either technique and for those guys it’s just about picking those days when they feel good and trying to capitalize on those and trying to avoid having a bad day where you lose lots of time.”\n\nWhile great things are expected of Kershaw and Harvey at this year’s Tour given their top ten results last year, Wadsworth is equally excited about Babikov’s chances, despite coming off a poor season last year. “Ivan’s been in the top ten before in the Tour de Ski and he’s in better shape now than I’ve ever seen. I think he’s in a better position now with his classic skiing being much better. He just had a great classic race in Rogla where he was up in the lead group a lot of the race, and even led for a while.”\n\n“Last year in the Tour he struggled a bit in the classic races so I’m really excited to see what he can do this year. If he can be a little closer coming into the final stage and the climb up Alpe Cermis he can be a major threat because he’s had the fastest time on the climb before.” Babikov’s one and only World Cup victory was won on this final stage of the Tour de Ski, back in 2009.\n\nWadsworth also addressed the fact that no Canadian women will be racing in this year’s TdS, despite that fact that his American counterpart was sending three women to the Tour. Referring to Chandra Crawford, Dasha Gaiazova and Perianne Jones, Wadsworth said, “Their distance results just haven’t matched their sprint results, and the Tour de Ski is not a place to come and just dabble in a few sprints, it’s a lot of work.”\n\nWadsworth added that missing the Tour de Ski was the best way to set the three women up for greater success in the 2nd World Cup period, which features a number of back-to-back sprint events. “Even though there are two sprint races in the Tour,” he said, “they’re only half point races, and if you look at the races right after the Tour, those are very good races for our women’s team – the sprints in Milano, Moscow and Otepaa.”\n\n“A lot of the athletes they’re going to compete against in those races are going to be pretty fatigued from the Tour,” Wadsworth pointed out, “and they can hopefully garner some more podiums from those races. So that’s the decision we made and I think in the long run it will prove to be a smart one.”\n\nChris Grover – United States\n\nWith a mix of both distance specialists and sprinters capable of producing distance results, U.S. Head Coach Chris Grover has been planning all along to send a squad of men and women to the Tour. “Our initial thought all along this year was to race Kris, Andy, Kikkan, Liz and Simi,” Grover told SkiTtrax. “Since last spring they were the skiers in particular that we had planned to race, as we felt like they would be ready for the Tour if their training went well.”\n\nGrover said the decision to commit to a larger team was based on a number of factors, mostly to do with how the U.S. athletes were developing as more all around skiers: “The difference between this year and last year, where we only had three athletes, is that this year we feel we have athletes that are skiing at an all-round better level in terms of their fitness, strength and experience, and who can do well in multiple types of events.”\n\nHolly Brooks, meanwhile, was a late addition to the Tour de Ski team after a series of breakthrough performances on the World Cup: “Having Holly here is totally based on the fantastic skiing that she’s delivered during the first World cup period,” continued Grover.\n\nWhen asked about his performance expectations of the US athletes on the Tour, Grover dwells less on specific results targets and more on encouraging the team to continue building on the momentum established so far this season, one in which almost every member of the team has achieved a personal best.\n\n“Five of the six athletes have had a personal best of some kind or another during the fall World Cup period,” Grover points out, “whether it’s Andy in distance skiing, Simi in sprint, Liz in classic skiing, and Kikkan and Holly in pretty much everything. So I’d love to see those guys seize that type of opportunity again and have another personal best. And the thing about the Tour is that if you can stay healthy and really take care of yourself the opportunities almost become greater as you go along because there’s a lot of attrition.”\n\nHaving said that, Grover is certainly not ruling out the possibility of a podium finish or two: “This is also a year in which we have a few different athletes with the potential to score a podium – and since we’ve never had a Tour de Ski podium that would be exciting for us as well.”\n\nThe fireworks begin on Dec. 29 so stay tuned to skitrax.com for complete coverage of the 6th annual Tour de Ski.\n\nDecember 26, 2011 (Davos, Switzerland) – Apparently, life’s been good the last few weeks because I’ve been too busy eating stellar food, taking saunas, drinking cappuccinos, training hard and hitting up all the World Cup stops instead of reflecting on what’s been up. My bad.\n\nIf you need to use the restroom or if you’re hungry and/or thirsty I’d suggest taking care of that now – it’s been a busy three weeks and I’ve been accused of being “wordy.” Preposterous, I know.\n\nLet’s go through them as they happened.\n\nDusseldorf, GER – Skate Sprint\n\nFact. It was hard to peel myself away from the Bivio’s antipasti.\n\nJustin had been trying to convince me to give Dusseldorf a go for months, even booking me a plane ticket saying, “even if you don’t go, at least we have our bases covered.” So, when I describe it as a “snap decision” to go to Germany for less than 24hrs to race a sprint race – I’d be somewhat lying.\n\nSeriously though, I wasn’t convinced – especially after my bush-league outing in Kuusamo’s classic sprint.\n\nIt’s amazing what sun on the face, great food, and good vibes can do. By Friday I was stoked to giver, so off I went to give it a go.\n\nThe major characteristic of the short trip was this: It rained. And I don’t mean, “rained” so much as I mean a deluge of biblical proportions. I single-handily soaked three sets of boots, all the clothing I traveled with and most of (our wax tech’s) Joel’s. Damn, it was nasty. Warming up, my eyes constantly drifted to the swelling Rhine where I expected to see a robed man sporting a huge beard (which is how I imagine Noah to look. Now that you mention it, that’s how I depict everyone in the Bible: robed & bearded) aboard a great wooden ship – some would say Ark-like. I saw many a ship meandering by – yet none with Llamas, Chinchillas, Snow Leopards, Platypuses, Voles, Manatees, etc… two by two.\n\nThe other thing that wasn’t two-by-two was the race. It was tight and narrow! My race itself was unspectacular. I was really happy to qualify easily in 15th place, but in my quarterfinal I felt like a boarder-collie behind unorganized, massive, aggressive sheep. I kept going back and forth on the narrow course looking for a hole to sneak through – but found none. Therefore I was knocked out and ended my day in 18th. I felt so much better than that –but I learnt a valuable lesson. Mainly, Dusseldorf is incredibly narrow and full of right turns – making it hard to come from 6th around everyone. My starts need to improve.\n\nDavos, SUI – Skate sprint\n\nAfter a few more killer days in Italy and a long session in Pontresina, SUI it was time for us to move down to Davos for the World Cups there.\n\nAt first I was psyched. They changed the planned 30km individual start race to a 15km – which was good news for guys like me that like to sprint too.\n\nYet, the decision didn’t stick. Babs’ repeated strange sauna snow dances seemed to have worked – and from Thursday onwards it started puking (snow) and didn’t quit. The 30km was back on, and I was back on the bench – deciding (read: Justin repeatedly telling me: “dude – we talked about this. That 30km is NOT going to happen”) to skip the 30km to have some snap left for Sunday’s sprint.\n\nHow did the sprint go? Good thanks. Yet, it almost didn’t go at all. I got into the rounds by the skin on my teeth and I brush three times a day, floss and Listerine – so I imagine there’s not a ton of skin on them. 28th place. 0.1 seconds slower and I would have had a pretty lame weekend.\n\nBut, in is in, and thankfully the body was rocking. The heats went amazing. I made the final and aside from just embarrassingly slow starts – things were clicking well. Made the decision to skip the 30km seem pretty smart.\n\nIn the final itself I felt good but made some tactical errors late in the race – I finished 4th. I know right?!? 4th is just such a burn but I was 0.1sec from even getting a chance to race at all, so 4th isn’t SO bad.\n\nI felt now finally that the first two weeks of the season were behind me and I was back to feeling “normal.” We spent most of the week in Davos just skiing easy and drinking cappos before the show moved East to Slovenia.\n\nRogla, SLO – 15km mass start classic + skate sprint\n\nWe arrived late Wednesday evening and awoke to warm temperatures and rain. Man it was depressing. The venue had a sad little ribbon of rock/dirt/snow through the fields on Thursday and I was pretty convinced that no distance race was going to go down.\n\nThen – Petra or someone must have spoken to God – because Friday couldn’t have been any more different. It was heinous – snowing like crazy, North Shore of Maui-windy, and just an all around nasty, nasty, nasty day. I laughed up there testing skis – it was such a difference from Thursday!\n\nFirst up was the classic race. The day wasn’t exactly awesome. It was still snowing a bit and windy as’ too. In the race itself, I felt good – but skied like an idiot – going for an early preem, getting it (and the 15 WC points) before paying dearly for the effort the rest of the race.\n\nIt was a waste of good feelings, and I crossed the line disappointed. I should have known better, but I was feeling so good that I just went for it. Lesson learned.\n\nThe storm blew itself out by Sunday, and we were treated to sunny skies and very little/no wind too for the sprint, which was cool. I finally got to see what Rogla looked like – pretty nice terrain.\n\nI had an ok qualifier – better speed than the week before in Davos – and moved on to the heats. The course was short with a lot of corners – which didn’t exactly play into my snail-like starts. I felt amazing again – but ran out of time in the end, finishing 3rd in my heat – getting knocked out and finishing 15th on the day.\n\nSo, I wasn’t super happy with the weekend (but of course seeing Chandra crack the podium on Sunday was pretty awesome!! WOO!). I felt much better than the results board read – but so it goes. I was happy to have felt good body-wise and that gives me confidence as the Tour de Ski approaches.\n\nDavos…\n\nSometimes I wake up in the night with this reoccurring nightmare. I’m in a Swiss town nestled in the Alps. It starts dumping snow – like “ski movie” dumping – and it doesn’t ever stop.\n\nThe mountains are getting blasted – sick powder is there to be ripped – but I am a cross-country ski racer and the Tour de Ski is a little over a week away. Then, I wake up feeling crappy, like I’m fighting something – not quite healthy and I’m tired from travel and a heavy race schedule.\n\nThen I realize that’s me right now. I’m living that nightmare! I’m the guy who is a bit run down, and not out skiing big lines. Argh. Yes – Davos is beautiful, and yes it is getting hammered with snow – but I’m just chilling out trying to get my energy back and reload for the Tour, which starts in a shade over a week. No powder skiing for me it looks like, but that’s fine (is it?). Delay doesn’t mean denial – so boys get ready for the best-ever backcountry ski trip come spring. It’s so bad that I’m excited for something that is so far away – but all this powder is making crazy!!\n\nChristmas will be spent here with Alex, his girlfriend (Sophie), Hutchy, Babs and his family and Lenny. Going to be a chill scene, but that’s ok too. It’s my sixth year spending Christmas here in Davos – so I should be an old hand at it, but I still miss friends and family back home – as well as beautiful Canmore.\n\nThat’s the news. Told ya’ it was a doozy.\n\nMerry Christmas to everyone!\n\nDevon.\n\nDecember 19, 2011 (Rogla, Slovenia) – North Americans wrapped up a successful weekend of World Cup racing in Rogla, Slovenia with a slew of personal bests in Sunday’s skate sprint events. Canada’s Chandra Crawford scored her first ever World Cup silver medal in the women’s final, while her teammate, Dasha Gaiazova, placed 9th, a personal best in a skate sprint.\n\nWhile heavy favourite Kikkan Randall (USA) fell victim to a crash and a broken pole in the sprint final (ending up 6th), she and her US teammates still had something to celebrate. Randall scored her best classic distance result in the women’s 10k classic placing 11th on Saturday while Holly Brooks did the same placing a solid 19th, and Liz Stephen also celebrated a personal best finishing 22nd. Meanwhile Ida Sargent qualified for the sprint heats for her first time on the World Cup while earning her first WCup points.\n\nThe USA’s Simi Hamilton led the North American men, finishing 10th in the freestyle sprint, also a personal best World Cup result. Overall, Canada and the US placed five men in the top 21, with Devon Kershaw, Len Valjas, Alex Harvey and Andy Newell placing 15th, 18th, 19th and 21st respectively. Newell also notched his first ever World Cup points in a distance race after finishing 24th in the men’s 15km classic on Saturday.\n\nRead additional comments on the Rogla weekend from Simi Hamilton, Ivan Babikov, Noah Hoffman, Holly Brooks, Liz Stephen, Lenny Valjas and Kris Freeman below.\n\nSimi Hamilton on his sprint top-10\n\nA great day for sure… I’m pretty fired up. The course seemed to suit me really well. A lot of tight, technical corners that you really had work as well as a pretty short length and firm conditions.\n\nMy training was really quality this summer and fall, and even though I’ve been battling some bouts of illness recently, I knew that my preparation was good… it was just a matter of getting the energy and confidence back. My coach Pete and I designed a training plan that really focused on improvement of my weaknesses. I’m feeling a lot more comfortable in the last 200 meters of the race and I’m much better at calling on the flat-out speed that I have during that crucial time in the race.\n\nI had a really good start in my quarter- another thing that Pete and I worked on a lot on this summer- and I found myself about 1 meter ahead of everyone at the 30 meter point. I knew that with the nature of the course it was good to go into the corners section in the lead, so I decided to ski hard and stay ahead. It basically came down to drag race in the last 200 meters, and a good lunge got me into that lucky loser spot.\n\nIn the semi I wanted to go with a different strategy… there was a long slingshot downhill pretty early in the course that Gloersson passed me on in the quarters, so I wanted to be in 2nd or 3rd on that section. After that long downhill and the corners section, I tried to make a move over the steep climb but got boxed out by Gloersson on the right and got pinballed by Morilov on the right.\n\nEventually I found a lane on the climb, but I would have liked to have entered the lanes with a little more of an advantage over the other guys in my heat. Unfortunately, the lunge in the quarters didn’t get me as far in my semi, I think by about a centimetre or so. Oh well, it was still a great heat to have been a part of.\n\nI’m definitely satisfied with today. I’ve known all fall that this is where my fitness and speed are at, but just haven’t gotten a chance to prove that. I’m really looking forward to the Tour de Ski and the rest of the winter. Of course I’ll be most looking forward to the sprints, but I’m really excited to see how some of the distance races turn out, especially the ones on the shorter side.\n\nHolly Brooks on her 19th place in Saturday’s classic distance race\n\nIt was a solid day. Matt Whitcomb pointed out that it’s phenomenal to come in 19th and feel “luke warm” about the race. That said, I believe the entire women’s team has World Cup best classic distance races today! Plus, it was wonderful to see Andy Newell score his first distance points! Newell and Freeman have had a long going bet (maybe many years) about who will score points in the other person’s discipline first. I suppose it’s Freeman’s turn to score tomorrow in the sprint!\n\nThe conditions today were a LOT nicer than they were yesterday. Friday’s training day featured thick fog and snow that was constantly changing between hard wax, klister covered, and klister. We woke up this morning to snow down low and received an email that the venue got 20cm last night! That said, it wasn’t nearly as soft as it could have been.\n\nThe men’s race was first this morning which is extremely rare for the World Cup. Therefore, the tracks were even sloppier than they otherwise would have been due to the wind. They were washed out in places and there were big troughs for poling in the two middle tracks. The top of the course featured an out and back SUPER windy section where the snow was dirty, there were big chunks of ice and a strong headwind/cross wind to fight against. The skiing, in this section specifically, was ugly. I felt ugly and I’m sure it looked horrendous on TV. Luckily I wasn’t the only one fighting with it.\n\nFor the first two laps I was skiing a bit stronger – 13th and 10th and two of the respective intermediate check points. I felt strong for 2-3 laps and then fatigue set in like a load of bricks. I skied the entire second half of the race with Marthe Kristoffersen and my skis were slightly better but I couldn’t get around her, no matter what I did. I was hoping to have some energy left for the last herringbone hill into the long, gradual uphill finish but I was toast. There were certainly more girls collapsed in the finish line than usual – a testament to the tricky conditions, altitude, and mass start format.\n\nOn Monday I will head to Ramsau, Austria with the rest of the crew competing in the Tour. I’m excited for a bit of downtime and some easy skiing. Conditions in Ramsau as of a couple of days ago were really good – 30k groomed and I’m really hoping that’s held up! I’m over the gerbil loops for a while and long for some big tours where you cover a significant amount of terrain on the natural stuff!\n\nAs for confidence, I’m feeling good right now… I think I’ve scored points 6 times in period one which has exceeded my expectations. Although I’m not ecstatic about today, it was still a personal best which goes to show that my expectations are changing. I feel like I’ve established my baseline and I’m already looking forward to the next level!\n\nIvan Babikov on Saturday’s classic race, in which he placed 22nd\n\nI’m very happy with my race today, I have struggled with my classic in the past two seasons. I didn’t plan any early attacks, I just tried to stay at the front of the pack as long as possible, and there was an opportunity for bonus points, so I was very happy about that. Our skis worked very good today, and it was very exiting to ski with Devon and Alex at the front.\n\nI got a bit tired on the last lap and couldn’t go with the leaders but still satisfied with the overall.\n\nWe all looking forward to the Tour now, just have to stay healthy, that’s the goal for now.\n\nNoah Hoffman on Saturday’s race, plus plans going forward\n\nThe course today was much better than what we skied yesterday. We got a significant amount of snow last night. The organizers were able to spread some more manmade snow to add a hill to the course. The organizers did a great job.\n\nMy skis were fantastic. The techs did a great job. I also have a lot of confidence in the pair of skis I was on. It is the same pair I raced on in the 15km at World Championships last year.\n\nToday was a little disappointing [51st], but I feel I am set up for some success in the second half of the season.\n\nI love being on the World Cup and the whole scene. It is much less of a spectacle this year than last year for me. I still enjoy watching the logistics and everything that goes into putting on one of these races. It is a really cool series of races.\n\nI’m headed to Vermont on Monday to work on technique with Zach Caldwell. I’ll be in the East until US Nationals.\n\nLiz Stephen on her best ever finish (22nd) in a classic World Cup distance race\n\nIt was a PB Saturday and I was really excited, for sure. The race on Saturday went really well for me. After previewing the course the day before, I set my sights to a top 35 goal, as I thought getting into the top 30 would be pretty tough for me on a relatively flat course with tough snow.\n\nHowever, we woke up the next morning to fresh snow which helped the tracks a lot and the added part of the loop that had not been open the day before had another short climb in it, which all helped, for sure.\n\nHowever, I think most of what happened Saturday was me deciding to go for it. Courses are never all going to be perfect for any athlete, but the ones that can learn how to just go for it every time, have a much better chance to have a great race than the ones who only think they can ski to their potential on courses that were made for them. And on Friday night, I decided that was not going to be me.\n\nSo, I went for it, and every lap felt better than the one before it. I kept skiing up, tried to ski smart by tucking in behind girls where I could to block the gusting wind, rest where I could, hammer where I could, and just never count myself out. And it worked.\n\nLenny Valjas on battling sickness in the days before Sunday’s sprint race\n\nOn Friday I woke up achy with a sore throat. Not the feeling you want the day before a race. I knew starting the 15km race would be a mistake so I told Justin [Wadsworth] to take me out of the race. I didn’t feel any better on Saturday. I sat in bed all day and watched 4 movies. I really liked the course. It suited me very well with the gradual climbs and the tough finish. It would have been a fun course to try if I was feeling 100%. I told myself that I would race the sprint no matter how I felt. I kept telling myself that the cold would not affect me in the race.\n\nThis morning [Sunday] I woke up and was still congested, but my sore throat was much better. I didn’t feel nearly as crappy as the morning before. I can’t be any happier with how my day ended up. It felt surreal to be in the heats, considering that I was lying in bed for the past two days.\n\nThis year I will spend Christmas in Davos with the Tour de Ski boys. I will not be racing the Tour this year, the coaches and I agreed that it might be too much for me to handle with all the sprints coming up in the weeks following.\n\nKris Freeman reveals how a personal loss is affecting his racing\n\nThis has been a very disappointing period of racing for me. I have been dealing with a major loss in my personal life and it has a very negative impact. I haven’t slept like I normally do and my stress levels have been through the roof. When it has been time to push in races there has been nothing there. Stress always makes my sugar less predicable but I have had no major issues.\n\nThe course [on Saturday] was easy, the pace was on the slow side and my skis were good. The snow was an odd mix of natural and man-mae snow but I generally like snow that you have to finesse. Everything pointed to a good race for me except that I have let myself get exhausted from external factors.\n\nAndy’s race [on Saturday] was exciting. This is the first time since the 2002 season that three American men have scored World Cup points in distance racing. I have been suffering but my teammates are picking up the slack.\n\nDecember 18, 2011 (Rogla, Slovenia) – The USA’s Simi Hamilton turned heads qualifying 7th to lead the North Americans in 10th overall as Dario Cologna (SUI) scored the win in the men’s 1.2km freestyle sprint over Nikolay Morilov (RUS). Morilov attacked just before the final climb and tried to escape in the final but had to settle for second in the end as Cologna was too strong, with Norway’s Gloeersen in third.\n\nHamilton’s teammate Andy Newell qualified a strong 10th along with three Canadians including Len Valjas, Devon Kershaw and Alex Harvey, but all were disappointed with their showings in heats and were out quickly on the fast, tight and unforgiving Rogla course.\n\nFor Hamilton it was a breakthrough day as he was the lone North American to advance to the semis as a lucky loser, but then drew a very fast heat with Gloeersen and Morilov taking first and second to move on to the final. Hamilton’s semi also included both lucky losers – Paal Golberg and Erik Barndsal from Norway – as the speedy American ended up 10th.\n\n“The course seemed to suit me really well. A lot of tight, technical corners that you really had work as well as a pretty short length and firm conditions,” Hamilton wrote SkiTrax post-race. “My training was really quality this summer and fall, and even though I’ve been battling some bouts of illness recently, I knew that my preparation was good. My coach Pete [Vordenberg] and I designed a training plan that really focused on improving my weaknesses.\n\n“I had a really good start in my quarterfinal – another thing that Pete and I worked on a lot on this summer. It basically came down to drag race in the last 200 meters, and a good lunge got me into that lucky loser spot. In the semi I wanted to go with a different strategy… there was a long slingshot downhill pretty early in the course that Gloersson passed me on in the quarterfinal, so I wanted to be in 2nd or 3rd on that section. After that long downhill and the corner section, I tried to make a move over the steep climb but got boxed out by Gloersson and pinballed by Morilov on the right.\n\n“I’m definitely satisfied with today. I’ve known all fall that this is where my fitness and speed are at, but just haven’t gotten a chance to prove that. I’m really looking forward to the Tour de Ski and the rest of the winter.”\n\nFor Newell it was another day of frustration on the sprint course as he allowed others to control the race despite his better positioning. “The course in Rogla is a good one, perfect conditions today and lots of fun corners and stuff on the sprint loop. I tried to get out in front in my heat and control things which I did for a period of time but then managed to get pushed around and cut off too many times in the last portion of the heat.\n\n“It’s completely my fault I don’t know why I’m skiing like such a wimp. I need to hold my ground better and not allow myself to get boxed out on the hills or cut off in the finishing lanes – it’s just happening too often. I’m feeling pretty good so hopefully I can turn that around. I was a little tired after the classic race but I should still be able to sprint it out. I’m satisfied with the distance result but still haven’t had anything to be too stoked about on sprint side yet this year.”\n\nIn a phone interview Canada’s Kershaw echoed similar sentiments. While it was great to qualify three team members he wanted more. “It was busy out there and for sure a great day for Chandra. I’m disappointed that I didn’t get better positioning early on to make a go of it later in the sprint. It was tough to pass guys and having Cologna and Hattestad in the mix didn’t help.”\n\nKershaw was up against teammate Len Valjas as well – so what’s it like facing a teammate in an important race like this? “We’re getting more used to it which is good,” said Kershaw. “Lenny’s a really laid back guy and it’s all part of the game, plus it’s a chance for us work together and hopefully both advance.”\n\nHarvey was disappointed as well but on the short twisty course there was little chance to gain ground. “I tried but it’s not super wide and there are lots of turns so you’re chances are limited. Still we have lots to celebrate with Chandra’s podium and qualifying three guys… we’re ready for the Tour de Ski and more racing.”\n\nBoth coaches were pleased overall… “Today was filled with big ups and downs, but when the team is rolling the way it has in period one it’s easy to focus in on the positive,” said US Coach Matt Whitcomb. “Simi and Ida were the big hits of the day. Simi took his first World Cup top-10 and Ida her first World Cup points. Neither of them ever faded in their elimination heat. They had a lot to give today, and had good production right through to the finish.\n\n“These two have been a bit flat for parts of period 1, and today’s race indicated that training is being absorbed and good feelings are here. Ida goes home to Rumford now satisfied with a great result, and Simi heads into our Tour de Ski pre-camp feeling more confident. Andy and Kikkan each looked fit for the finals today, but standard course contact got the best of them. Still, we’ll take four in the top 25 any day. Plus the techs made great skis again today.”\n\nFor Canadian Coach Justin Wadsworth a podium finish in the bag as the first Euro campaign comes to an end feels good. “The team is doing really well. Chandra’s podium is icing on the cake of three top 20s in each race – that’s a solid start. Plus Dasha’s personal best in the skate sprint – it’s all adding up to solid training and a good mindset. We know they can all perform and the proof sets the stage for the Tour de Ski and races to come.”\n\nWadsworth is American so how does it feel to see success there as well? “We’re one big family, both teams, and we feed off each other and work hard together for overall success… I’m really pleased to see success there as well.”\n\nAccording to Wadsworth Harvey, Kershaw, Babikov and Valjas will head to Davos and prepare for the Tour de Ski – Valjas is not competing at the Tour but training with the three studs is “good for him overall.” Crawford and Gaiazova head back to Canmore to train and will rejoin the team in Jan. The US teamers are spending Xmas in Ramsau in their lead up to the Tour de Ski when the fireworks begin again.\n\nMen’s Qualifications.\n\nMen Final HERE.\n\nDecember 18, 2011 (Rogla, Slovenia) – Xmas came early for Canada’s Chandra Crawford as she scored World Cup silver in the women’s sprint while her American friend Kikkan Randall, the WCup Series leader who looked dialed for another top podium finish, suffered a crash just after the start in the final that ended her day. Fans were hoping for a North American podium but it was not to be.\n\nCrawford skied smart near the front staying out of trouble and powered up the final climb in a battle with Norway’s Maiken Caspersen Falla as the two began to pull away from the field on their own. As they crested the hill Falla surged down the finishing stretch ahead of Crawford to claim the gold as Ida Ingemarsdotter from Sweden, the top qualifier, took home the bronze.\n\n“There were some rough years,” said 28-year-old Crawford in a phone interview with SkiTrax post-race, “but my mental approach has always been positive and now the physical side is finally kicking in. The hard work through the summer and new initiatives like the great Women’s Alliance camp we had with the US team in Alaska are all paying off. I’m so excited for our team that has been pushing so hard – it’s great to see some personal bests for both teams.”\n\n“I’ve been working on having a stronger finish and the distance racing is also helping me build stamina and strength. Following Dusseldorf and Davos I’ve been feeling more confident and my plan today was to stay out to trouble and tuck in behind Kikkan. When she crashed out I kept near the front and attacked on the climb but couldn’t catch Falla in the end – I’m so happy with today’s result.”\n\nIt was the first silver medal of Crawford’s career. The 2010 Torino Olympic gold sprint medallist also has two World Cup gold medals and two bronze podium finishes to her credit.\n\nRandall, who handily won her quarter-final (over Saarinen) and her semi-final heat (over Falla), was disappointed but has already put it behind her. “Someone caught my ski and before I knew it I spun out and went down. Then as I tried to recover my pole broke – either I broke it or another skier did somehow. The good news is I feel strong and ready for the next challenge. I’m really happy for Chandra and it was a great day for Ida [Sargent] and Simi [Hamilton].”\n\nDaria Gaiazova had a super day as well for Canada as she ends the first part of the Euro campaign with a personal best of 9th in the skate sprint – her best result in the classic sprint is 8th. Gaiazova qualified 22nd and aced her quarter final with a strong push up the final hill and then a big kick at the finish to place second. In her semi the same strategy didn’t work but she was buoyant about her result.\n\n“I knew the uphill was a good place to attack and it worked well in my first heat but I had less snap in the semi. Still it’s my best skate sprint result and I’m happy to end the last Euro weekend before the holidays on a positive note which wasn’t the case last year,” commented Gaiazova.\n\nThe USA’s Ida Sargent had a breakthrough day as well placing 30th in the qualifications for her first crack at the quarter final sprint heats. Despite being eliminated early she gained all important points and excellent experience.\n\n“Last weekend in Davos I paced the qualifier and that didn’t work so today I just went for it from the start and it was awesome to squeak into the heats. In the quarterfinal I wasn’t aggressive enough out of the start and was boxed in when I tried to move up, but I’m super psyched with the race and it was a great confidence builder.”\n\nWomen Qualifications HERE.\n\nWomen’s Final HERE.\n\nVisnar leads Crawford in the quarterfinal. © Nordic Focus\n\nW Podium (l-r) Crawford, 2nd, Fall 1st, Ingemarsdotter 3rd. © Nordic Focus\n\nChandra Crawford (CAN) wins silver…© Nordic Focus\n\nChandra Crawford (CAN) © Nordic Focus\n\nVesna Fabjan (SLO) © Nordic Focus\n\nFalla, Crawford and Ingemarsdotter at the finish…© Nordic Focus\n\nRandall and Crawford at the finish…© Nordic Focus\n\nChandra Crawford (CAN) at Davos last weekend. © Nordic Focus file photo\n\nRandall gets tripped up just after the start.\n\nDaria Gaiazova (CAN) © Nordic Focus\n\nIda Sargent (USA) © Nordic Focus\n\nDecember 14, 2011 (Alaska) – After completing another “personal best” World Cup weekend in Davos, Switzerland the decision has been made – Holly Brooks will officially be joining the US Ski Team’s roster to participate in the 2012 edition of the Tour de Ski!\n\nThe idea arose after Brooks’ successful completion of the Kuusamo Mini-Tour where she finished 23rd overall amongst over 90 women. However, coaches and Brooks were waiting to see how the races in Davos went before making an official decision about her race schedule. Brooks proved that she belongs on the Tour de Ski roster without question. In Saturday’s distance event in Davos, after 50 starters Brooks was leading the race. Until approximately 10km (into the 15k event) she was as high as seventh place overall. While she faded towards the end of the race, Brooks finished 13th place, five seconds out of tenth to bring home the best result of the day for the USA. Aside from Kikkan Randall’s 8th place in Sjujsoen and an 11th place in the 2011 Lahti, Finland pursuit, Brooks’ 15km result in Davos might be one of the best female distance race results since Alison Kiesel in the mid 1980s!\n\nFollowing this weekend’s performance Holly has consistently scored points in five of seven individual race starts. World Cup points have come in both techniques, skate and classic as well as both racing styles, distance and sprint events. Brooks has proved that she is a well-rounded racer, capable of skiing well in any event, and any distance; a skill that will prove valuable in the 9-stage, 11- day Tour de Ski!\n\nBrooks’ enthusiasm for the Tour format matches her stellar, World Cup start. “I am really, really excited for the Tour and the opportunity to race day after day here in Europe. My favorite part of the World Cup are the race weekends and in the Tour, it’s like having five race weekends condensed into one event. I feel like my training with APU has prepared me with the fitness to race day in and day out.\n\n“I’ve gathered both mental and physical strength from my long days in the mountains growing up with my dad and at home, in Alaska with my husband Rob. I am excited for the challenge and cannot wait for the Tour to begin!”\n\nIn the overall World Cup standings Brooks currently sits in 26th place overall, and perhaps more notably, is ranked 19th in the World for distance skiing.\n\nThis year’s Tour will begin in Oberhof, Germany on December 29th with a 2.5km freestyle Prologue event. The Tour will then continue on to Obersdorf (Germany), Toblach (Italy), Cortina (Italy), and finally conclude in Val di Femme (Italy) where the final stage will take place in the form of a 9-kilometer uphill ski. (Val di Femme is also the site of the 2013 Nordic World Championships so racing at this venue will prove valuable in more ways than one!).\n\nThe full Tour de Ski schedule of events can be found in the attached World Cup Calendar document. For more information on the actual event, check the website HERE.\n\nThe first event of the Tour is scheduled to begin 10 days after the upcoming World Cup weekend in Rogla, Slovenia. This means Brook will spend Christmas in Ramsau, Austria with other members of the US Ski Team in order to participate in a pre-Tour training camp. Brooks, along with US Ski Team members Kikkan Randall and Liz Stephan, will miss the 2012 US Nationals being held in Rumford, Maine. The US Championships is scheduled in direct conflict with the Tour de Ski.\n\nThe 2012 Tour de Ski is the banner event for the 2011-2012 season; a year where there is no World Championships or Olympic Games. As such, many of the top athletes are gunning to have their best performances at the Tour.\n\nLast year’s Tour de Ski proved to be tough as close to two thirds of the field dropped out before the final hill climb. This year completion rates are expected to be higher as skiers aren’t worried about “saving themselves” for a Championship event. Still, the unique stage race will prove to be tough physically, mentally, logistically, and finally, financially.\n\nThe chance to participate in the Tour de Ski is a wonderful opportunity, one that Holly will not pass up. Unfortunately, the invitation for the Tour comes with no funding and Holly is responsible for paying her costs directly out of pocket. If she continues to turn in good results there may be an opportunity to finish out the entire World Cup season, through the end of March. What initially began as a six week trip has the likelihood of turning into a full, five month World Cup season!\n\nIn order to participate in the Tour and the remainder of the World Cup season Holly is faced with raising an additional $17,500. This sum pays for basic expenses (room & board + transportation) alone with no “in-pocket income.” Several fundraising campaigns are currently in the works to support Holly’s Tour de Ski and World Cup efforts. For more information or if you would like to participate, donations can be made via paypal on her blog or, contact Holly directly at brooksha@gmail.com.\n\nDecember 12, 2011 (Davos, Switzerland) – Kikkan Randall (USA) and Alexey Petukhov (RUS) completely dominated the Elite fields on Sunday at the Davos World Cup sprints, winning both of their final 1.5km matches by a healthy margin. Led by Devon Kershaw, who placed fourth in the men’s final, Canada had a good day as well with the men’s and women’s teams each firing in synch to put six skiers in the top 30, .\n\nRandall looked to have an extra gear today, attacking on the last climb during both her semi and final races to distance herself from the field, which chased in vain. So powerful was her acceleration in the semi-final that some wondered if she would have anything left in the tank for the final. But Randall, who qualified first, was in a league of her own in Davos as she executed the same move in the final with apparent ease. Following behind her in the final were Russia’s Natalia Matveeva and Norway’s Maiken Falla. World Cup overall leader Marit Bjoergen (NOR), who won in Davos last year, finished 7th on the day.\n\n“I was happy to have some good energy today,” Randall told SkiTrax in a post-race interview, and who felt no ill effects from yesterday’s 15k skate race. “Yesterday was definitely a hard race but if anything I think it just helped me for today.”\n\nRandall also talked about her race tactics and the way she exploited her power to accelerate away from the field on the final climb. “I didn’t expect the move to be quite as decisive as it was, but I knew that that’s usually a strong point for me so when I was in good position coming into the hill each time I took advantage of it.”\n\nSunday’s win was also a measure of redemption for Randall, who ended up 3rd here last year after being blocked in the final sprint to the line by Poland’s Justyna Kowalczyk – a move for which the Polish star was relegated by the race jury. Randall certainly learned from the experience and made sure no one was in a position to repeat such a move on her today: “I knew from last year that I had to take more initiative earlier in the race to get in a better position and I was just happy to be able to do that today.”\n\nWith her win Randall solidifies her grip on the World Cup sprint title with 240 points and sits 3rd in the World Cup overall standings, just 18 points out of second place.\n\nUSST women’s Coach, Matt Whitcomb, was ecstatic with the weekend’s results. “Our ladies certainly left their mark on Davos, finishing the weekend with 5 top 30s that included a huge win,” he told SkiTrax by email. “If you watched Kikkan’s final today you know what I mean. Over the top of the final climb Kikkan opened up a can and showed us what inspired skiing looks like.”\n\nCanada’s Chandra Crawford put in a strong performance today as well, qualifying 8th and winning her quarter final heat over Bjoergen, before running out of gas and being eliminated in the second semi-final. Crawford finished 9th on the day and now sits in 6th place in the World Cup sprint rankings.\n\nIn the men’s final, Petukhov attacked the field early during the second lap and held on to his advantage over the final hill and into the finish. Sweden’s Teodor Peterson out-stretched his teammate Emil Joenssen for second behind Petukhov. Joenssen, last year’s overall Sprint Cup winner, returned to action this weekend after recuperating from a thigh injury.\n\nAfter a slow start on the World Cup circuit so far, Canada’s Kershaw upped his game with his fourth place finish, and looked capable of a podium after winning his semi-final heat. Kershaw got off to a poor start in the final, however, and had to work to close down a gap right away. After rejoining the pack Kershaw stayed in the mix but couldn’t quite close and had to settle for 4th. Norway’s Petter Northug finished in 5th behind Kershaw.\n\n“For sure it stings being in fourth but it was an amazing result,” said Kershaw in a Cross Country Canada press release. “I felt so amazing in every round and in total control. I just couldn’t find any room in the finals. You can only do what you can do. Cross-country skiing is so hard so finishing fourth out here is amazing.”\n\nKershaw also commented on the strength of the Canadian team: “We have a super deep team and I think these results speak volumes of our program. Each weekend we have all had a top-five of our own. Hopefully one of us will break through.”\n\nKershaw’s teammate Alex Harvey also made it into the semi-finals, but was held up in traffic at the final hairpin turn going into the last climb and was eliminated. Harvey finished 9th on the day. “Good sprint day for me!,” Harvey tweeted afterward, “Body felt good after getting sick last weekend! Got tangled up in the semis but happy 9th place!”\n\nOther North Americans did well in Davos too. The USA’s Holly Brooks finished in 23rd in the women’s race, after qualifying in 16th. “We’re obviously fired up by Holly’s 16th place qualification,” said Whitcomb, “but with the way things have been going the word surprised no longer fits. It’s a true testament to hard and smart work done by Holly and her club. As we search the country for the next World Cup skier it’s comforting to know that APU is hard at work milling its current and future generation. We’ve constructed a very positive partnership between their program and our women’s team and we are only getting started.”\n\nAmericans Ida Sargent and Sadie Bjornsen were 50th and 52nd respectively in the qualifications. “While I know Sadie and Ida are disappointed to miss on the sprint qualification, there’s no question that these girls are fit for World Cup sprinting,” Whitcomb added, “it’s just going to take a lot of swings before they connect in the qualifications. They know this, and they know we believe in them. These tough days are time well spent.”\n\nAmong the other Canadian women racing both Perianne Jones and Dasha Gaiazova of Canada qualified to the quarterfinals but were eliminated in their heats and finished 29th and 30th, respectively.\n\nOn the men’s side, top sprinter Andy Newell of the USA qualified a very strong third, but did not advance thru the quarterfinals and finished 16th overall. “I’ve been feeling good so it was nice to see some speed come out in the qualification and to be back up toward the top again,” Newell told SkiTrax by email.\n\nHe also explained that he has been experimenting with his tactics in the heats lately: “The heats were similar to last weekend in that I tried to sit back and relax during the majority of the sprint and then attack at the finish. That’s something I’ve really been trying to improve on so I’ve been trying to work on that strategy – unfortunately it’s been close but not close enough at the finish line the last two weekends. I think in the next sprint I will have to go back to my normal type of skiing which is geared toward skiing at the front.”\n\nSimi Hamilton, who had been battling illness since arriving in Scandinavia last month, bounced back into action and missed qualifying by a mere 14 one hundredths of a second, to finish 33rd. US teammates Skylar Davis, Kris Freeman and Lars Flora finished 77th, 85th and 86th, failing to qualify for the heats.\n\nCanada’s Lenny Valjas qualified in 14th in the men’s sprint but was also eliminated in the quarterfinals. Valjas was skiing in a tight group when he went down in traffic at the hairpin turn leading up to the final hill. “Yesterday was a frustrating day,” Valjas told us. “All week, Devon, Alex, and I were feeling really good and knew we had a shot at having a couple of Canadians in the final. My qualifier went well. It was a lung burner because of the altitude and the layout of the course.\n\n“In the quarter final I was exactly where I wanted to be, behind Petukhov and Peterson. I was following them into the hill when a Finnish skier tried to take the corner on the inside where there was no room. His ski ended up tripping me up at a crucial point in the race and I was unable to catch them back.”\n\nFIS XC videos of the women’s final HERE.\n\nFIS XC videos of men’s final HERE.\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) in charge © Nordic Focus\n\nElite Women's final sprint podium (l-r) Matveeva 2nd, Randall 1st, Caspersen Falla 3rd © Nordic Focus\n\nDevon Kershaw (CAN) © NordicFocus\n\nFIS world cup cross-country, individual sprint, Davos (SUI)\n\nCanada's Crawford leads Norway's Bjoergen © Nordic Focus\n\nAlexey Petukov (RUS) © NordicFocus\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) © NordicFocus\n\nAlex Harvey (CAN) © NordicFocus\n\nMatveeva (RUS) leading Oestberg (NOR) © Nordic Focus\n\nChandra Crawford (CAN) © NordicFocus\n\n(l-r) Teodor Peterson (SWE), Alexey Petukov (RUS), Emil Joensson (SWE) © NordicFocus\n\nPetter Northug (NOR) © NordicFocus\n\nChandra Crawford (CAN) and Marit Bjoergen (NOR) © NordicFocus\n\nFIS world cup cross-country, individual sprint, Davos (SUI)\n\nMarit Bjoergen (NOR) © NordicFocus\n\nChandra Crawford (CAN) © NordicFocus\n\nPodium celebrations (l-r) Matveeva 2nd, Randall 1st, Caspersen Falla 3rd © Nordic Focus\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) © NordicFocus\n\nEmil Joensson (SWE) © NordicFocus\n\nAlexey Petukov (RUS) © NordicFocus\n\nAlex Harvey (CAN) and Dario Cologna (SUI) © NordicFocus\n\nKikkan Randall (USA) © NordicFocus\n\nFinal podium (l-r) Matveeva 2nd, Randall 1st, Caspersen Falla 3rd © Nordic Focus"
