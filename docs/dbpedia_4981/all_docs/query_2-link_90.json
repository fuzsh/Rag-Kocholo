        "text": "Dublin, Aug. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Asia Pacific Data Center Market Report By Absorption, Tier Type, Data Center Size, End User, Country and Company Analysis 2024-2032\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThe Asia Pacific Data Center Market will reach US$ 71.67 Billion by 2032, up from US$ 24.66 Billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 12.59% between 2024 and 2032.\n\nLarge volumes of digital information and data are processed, stored, and managed in a secure and dependable environment at a data center. Organizations may store and manage their IT infrastructure, which includes servers, storage systems, networking gear, and other hardware and software components, in one convenient area.\n\nExtensive and intricate, a data center has redundant cooling and power systems to keep equipment running even during a power outage or other disruption. Furthermore, advanced security protocols are implemented to safeguard against physical and virtual threats. Many contemporary businesses and organizations rely on data centers, especially those that depend on digital data and applications.\n\nIncreased Digitalization - Due to the growing use of digital technologies across numerous sectors in the Asia Pacific region, increased digitalization is a crucial development factor for the data center market in that region. There is an increase in the amount of data that needs to be generated, stored, and processed as organizations and governments embrace digital transformation. The emergence of e-commerce, mobile applications, social media platforms, and IoT devices drives this trend. They all require robust data infrastructures, especially for companies that depend on digital data and applications.\n\nChina continuously prioritizes the digital economy in its national development policy. China aims to improve knowledge in essential areas such as blockchain, integrated circuits, sensors, quantum information, and communications in line with the 14th Five-Year Plan. It also actively supports cutting-edge technologies like 6G. In addition, the Indian government launched the Digital India initiative, a multi-agency program designed to foster India's future growth and education.\n\nThe 5G network connectivity expansion is driving edge data center deployment- Many nations, including China, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, have adopted 5G technology extensively. The need for increased processing power and improved communication standards in data centers is driving the rollout of 5G in numerous regions. China Mobile Hong Kong Ltd., Hong Kong Ltd., SmarTone Mobile Communications Ltd., and Hutchison Telephone Company Ltd. are a few of the leading operators in Hong Kong.\n\nFurthermore, With Spark, 2Degrees, and One New Zealand, the three leading network providers in New Zealand, the government has reached a unique agreement. This agreement intends to expand mobile wireless coverage to additional remote locations that do not currently have acceptable service and expedite the introduction of 5G services in about 55 rural and regional towns nationwide. In the Asia Pacific region, more data centers are being built in close proximity to end users and their devices due to this demand, particularly in the urban areas where 5G development is concentrated.\n\nRise in adoption of artificial intelligence- AI is being used increasingly in the APAC region's industrial, retail, healthcare, and finance sectors to improve customer experiences, operational efficiency, and decision-making. Massive amounts of data are being generated by this adoption, which calls for effective management, processing, and storage.\n\nAs a result, there is an increasing need for sophisticated data center hardware, such as GPU-accelerated servers and specialist AI chips, that can handle AI workloads. Demand for data center services in Asia Pacific is predicted to rise sharply as businesses continue to use AI to innovate and obtain a competitive edge. This will encourage investments in AI-ready data center infrastructure and technology.\n\nIndia Data Center Market\n\nThe government of India's growing initiatives, such as Made in India and Digital India, foster the market's expansion. The actions are intended to enhance the country's digital infrastructure, provide digital services, and attract investments from diverse sectors. The need for data centers in India is also driven by government initiatives to construct data center parks and financial incentives for operators.\n\nFurthermore, the need for data centers to manage, process, and store data is growing as more businesses and industries embrace digitalization, fueling the expansion of the data center market in India. In addition, the sector is positively impacted by the growing use of cell phones, which produce massive amounts of data, and the expanding penetration of the internet.\n\nAs stated by TRAI (the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), there were 865.90 million internet users overall by the end of December 2022, up from 850.95 million at the end of September 2022. This is a gain of 1.76% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. In 2022, there will be 865.90 million internet users worldwide, of which 833.49 million will use wireless and 32.41 million will use wired.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages180Forecast Period2023 - 2032Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2023$24.66 BillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2032$71.67 BillionCompound Annual Growth Rate12.5%Regions CoveredAsia Pacific\n\nAsia Pacific Data Center Company News\n\nApril 2024: CTRLS Datacenters Ltd. intends to construct a new 130,000-square-foot, 13MW data center in Hyderabad's Gachibowli neighborhood.
