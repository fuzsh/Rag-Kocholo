The SmartOne C utilizes motion sensors, comparative GPS positions and custom-configured sensors to gather and transmit status information via the Globalstar satellite network. Reporting can take place every few hours, via motion-based reporting or in custom intervals, which Lasso can create to match your specific requirements. Heavy equipment, intermediate bulk containers, tanks and trailers are some of the many assets that may be tracked by this device.\n\nThe SmartOne C can be line-powered or, in the absence or interruption of external power, will automatically switch to AAA-battery back-up. Each device is configured to track its assets’ specific needs and provide intermediate and emergency alerts by email or text."
