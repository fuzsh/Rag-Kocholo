Visa requirements, laws, currency, culture and language have a heritage from the time of British rule, so for most tourists Hong Kong feels like a different country. However, some freedoms were curtailed when the National Security Law was imposed in 2020.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area of Hong Kong was incorporated into China during the Qin Dynasty in 214 BC, and largely remained under Chinese rule until it became a British colony in January 1841, as a result of the defeat of the Qing in the First Opium War. After the defeat of China in the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to Great Britain in 1860. The Opium War Museum is located across the border in Dongguan. The New Territories were leased to Great Britain in 1898 for a term of 99 years. Hong Kong was only a sparsely-populated backwater prior to the arrival of the British, but grew rapidly into one of the world's most densely populated areas following the establishment of a free port under British colonial rule.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that Hong Kong was an \"impregnable fortress\". However owing to Britain's main war effort in Europe, Hong Kong was not given sufficient resources for its defence. After two weeks of fighting, Hong Kong was surrendered to the Japanese on 25 December 1941, and subject to a brutal occupation that lasted until the end of the war. Upon the resumption of British control, Hong Kong experienced an astonishingly swift post-war recovery.\n\nAfter the communists took control of mainland China in 1949, many Chinese people, especially businessmen, fled to Hong Kong to escape persecution by the government. The British government took a hands-off approach in Hong Kong, and allowed a high degree of economic freedom. Social problems persisted during the 1950s and 1960s, including the continuation of Communist-Nationalist conflict among residents, labour disputes, and widespread corruption. These problems, when combined with effects of the Cultural Revolution, culminated in the 1967 riots by communist rioters, with an aim to subvert British rule. The riots were eventually suppressed by the authorities, but they forced the colonial government to take measures of reform, such as cracking down on corruption.\n\nUnder reforms, businesses flourished in Hong Kong and its economy grew rapidly, earning it a place as one of the East Asian Tigers. Today, Hong Kong is an industrialised and developed economy, and is one of the world's most important financial centres.\n\nIn 1984 the Chinese and British Governments signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain agreeing to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. On 1 July 1997 Hong Kong became a special administrative region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. As Hong Kong was the last remaining British colony with a significant population and economic importance, the handover was deemed by many to be the \"end of empire\". In theory, Hong Kong enjoys autonomy in most matters except foreign affairs and defence.\n\nIn 2014, the Umbrella Protest was held to demand free elections for Hong Kong's chief executive. The Chinese government had proposed elections for the position, but would only allow candidates they had vetted to stand for election. The proposed amendments to the Basic Law (Hong Kong's equivalent of a constitution) were voted down by the pro-democracy legislators, meaning that the chief executive is still elected by an election committee with limited representation. The protests eventually died down without concessions from China, though there remain demands for more political autonomy, and even for independence from China.\n\nSimmering tensions eventually led to the breakout of massive and violent protests in June 2019. The protests began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China to face criminal charges, but expanded into a wider anti-government movement, and continued even after the extradition bill was withdrawn. In response, the Chinese government imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in July 2020, outlawing many forms of speech and advocacy against the government. This crackdown has led to a massive brain drain, with many well-educated young professionals fleeing to Western countries, in particular the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nHong Kong participates in some international organisations that are normally restricted to sovereign states, such as the WTO, APEC and the IOC, and in international sports competitions under the name \"Hong Kong, China\" (中國香港).\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong Island (香港島) is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus. The parade of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart over the waters of Victoria Harbour. To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.\n\nThe great majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore. This is the place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past. Central (formerly Victoria) is where you will find the machinery of government grinding away much as it always has done, except that Beijing, not London, is the boss that keeps a watchful eye. Seek a glimpse of Government House (香港禮賓府), which had been home to 25 British governors, and is now the official residence of the Chief Executive. Nearby, the Legislative Council (LegCo) continues to make the laws that organise the territory.\n\nRising up from Central is the Escalator and the Peak Tram. The famous 800-metre escalator passes through the hip district of Soho and takes you into the residential neighbourhood known as the Mid-Levels because it is half-way up the mountain. Up top is Victoria Peak, the tallest point on the island,where foreign diplomats and business tycoons compete for the best views of the harbour from some of the most expensive homes to be found anywhere. Most tourists do not go much further than the Peak Tram, but take a short walk to the top and you will escape the crowds and be rewarded with some of the best harbour views. It is worth investing in a good map from a bookshop in Central if you want to enjoy some of the superb footpaths that crisscross the island.\n\nThe southern side of the island has developed into an upmarket residential area with many large houses and expensive apartments with views across the South China Sea. The island's best beaches, such as Repulse Bay, are found here and visitors can enjoy a more relaxed pace of life than on the bustling harbour side of the island. Wan Chai and Causeway Bay are the most visited neighbourhoods on the northern side of the island.\n\nKowloon (九龍) is the peninsula to the north of Hong Kong Island. With over 2.1 million people living in an area of less than 47 km², Kowloon is one of the most densely populated places on the planet, and has a matching array of places to shop, eat and sleep. Tsim Sha Tsui (尖沙咀), the tip of the peninsula, is Kowloon's main tourist drag and has a mix of backpacker and high-end hotels. Further north, Mong Kok (旺角) has a huge choice of shops and markets in an area of less than a square kilometre. Kowloon side, as it's often known, managed to escape some of the British influences that characterise the Hong Kong Island side. Kowloon real estate prices are the highest in the world, with multiple flats in West Kowloon setting world records with their multi-million dollar prices thanks to their panoramic views of Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe New Territories (新界), so named when the British leased more land from China in 1898, lie north of Kowloon. Largely rural and often ignored by travellers who have little time to spare, the New Territories offers a diverse landscape that takes time to get to know. Mountainous country parks overlook New Towns that have a clinical form of modernity that has attracted many to move here. Public transport and taxis make this offbeat place surprisingly accessible. You will not find many idyllic villages, but once you get over the stray dogs and the ramshackle buildings you will doubtlessly find something that will surprise you and cause you to reach for your camera.\n\nThe Outlying Islands (離島) are the islands (236 of them), islets and rocks in the seas around the territory. Lantau (大嶼山) is by far the largest of them and often considered its own district. The Hong Kong International Airport is built on landfill attached to Lantau. Lantau hosts some of the territory's most idyllic beaches, and major attractions such as Disneyland and the Ngong Ping cable car. Other islands include Lamma (南丫島), well known for its seafood, and Cheung Chau (長洲), a small island that used to be a pirates' den, but now attracts seafood aficionados, windsurfers and sunbathing day trippers.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nThe majority of Hong Kong's population are Han Chinese (92%), mostly of Cantonese ancestry, though there are also sizeable numbers of other Chinese groups such as Chiuchao (Teochews), Shanghainese and Hakkas. A significant number of Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalis live here too; some are immigrants, though many have families that have lived in Hong Kong for several generations. White people, some of them expatriates, and some descended from British colonists, make up just under 1% of the population. Other smaller communities whose presence in Hong Kong dates back to colonial times include the Parsis and the Baghdadi Jews, though the latter are now far outnumbered by expatriate Jews from Israel and Western countries.\n\nThe largest groups of non-Chinese immigrants are Filipinos, Indonesians and Thais, most of whom are employed as domestic helpers. On Sundays, being their day off, they congregate in their thousands — mostly Filipinas — in Central and Admiralty and spend the day there together, sitting talking, eating and drinking wherever there is free room.\n\nThe territory is also home to a significant number of people hailing from Australia, Europe, Japan and North America, making it a truly international metropolis.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the policy of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" arrangement, Hong Kong largely retains its governmental structure from colonial times, with separate executive, legislative and judicial branches.\n\nThe head of the executive branch is the chief executive, who leads an Executive Council composed of various cabinet secretaries. The legislative branch is the Legislative Council. The Court of Final Appeal, which is led by the Chief Justice, tops the judicial branch. Hong Kong retains a legal system based on English Common Law, as opposed to the Civil Law system used in mainland China.\n\nBoth the chief executive and 70 members of the legislature are elected by interest groups that are largely stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists. 20 members of the legislature are elected by popular vote, but nominations must be approved. The central government in Beijing is therefore effectively in control of the executive and legislative branches.\n\nMost pro-democracy legislators quit in November 2020 in protest against a decision made by Chinese authorities that authorises the Hong Kong government to take down and ban \"pro-independence\" legislators, and resulted in the instantaneous disqualification of four legislators. They were later rounded up by the police ostensibly for subversion after a primary election before the next legislative election. Another \"reform\" abolished the previous constitution of the Legislative Council, in which 35 members were elected by popular vote and the other 35 were elected by business interest groups, a move criticised by Western countries.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its history as part of that region, the local culture in Hong Kong is similar to that of Guangdong province. However, due to over a century of British rule, the British have also left their mark, as have the other non-Chinese minorities who came here during the colonial period. In addition, because the city escaped the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, Hong Kongers have maintained some aspects of traditional Chinese culture which have largely disappeared in the mainland.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong has a humid subtropical climate. Summers are usually hot, lasting from June to September, with temperatures usually exceeding 30 °C, while night-time summer temperatures do not drop below 25 °C . The area, with most of southern China, is affected by typhoons. Typhoons usually occur between June and September, though some typhoons may affect Hong Kong as late as October. These can bring a halt to local business for a day or less.\n\nWinters in Hong Kong are generally very mild, with temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 20 °C, and dropping further sometimes by about 1 to 2 °C in the New Territories and countryside. Christmas in Hong Kong is warm compared to European countries. Chinese New Year is notorious for cold wet weather, because winter in Hong Kong tends to start out mild and dry and then turn cooler and wetter later.\n\nSpring in Hong Kong is from March to May and autumn is from September to November with an average temperature of around 20 to 25 °C. Autumn is considered a more comfortable season as spring tends to be more humid and rainy.\n\nAlthough most buildings in Hong Kong have air conditioning to cope with the summer weather, winter heating is less common. During the coldest days, most locals wear more layers, even indoors. Some larger Chinese restaurants keep the air conditioning on during winter, though the temperature in air conditioned shopping malls stays the same regardless of season or weather outside.\n\nHolidays and festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nLunar New Year dates\n\nThe year of the Dragon began on 4 Feb 2024 at 16:25, and the Lunar New Year was on 10 Feb 2024\n\nThe year of the Snake will begin on 3 Feb 2025 at 22:10, and the Lunar New Year will be on 29 January 2025\n\nThe year of the Horse will begin on 4 Feb 2026 at 4:02, and the Lunar New Year will be on 17 Feb 2026\n\nContrary to popular belief, the change of the zodiac does not occur on the first day of the Lunar New Year, but instead occurs on Li Chun (立春 lì chūn), the traditional Chinese start of spring.\n\nChinese (Lunar) New Year (農曆新年). Many shops and restaurants are closed during the first 3 days of the Chinese New Year. However, department stores, supermarkets, and Western fast-food restaurants generally remain open. The week or two leading up to the Chinese New Year, and the period from the 4th to the 15th day are good times to soak up the festive mood and celebratory events such as lion dances, fireworks, and parades.\n\nSpring Lantern Festival (元宵節). This traditional Chinese festival in Victoria Park in Causeway Bay displays beautiful lanterns.\n\nChing Ming Festival (清明節). This festival in spring is also known as grave sweeping day. To show respect to the deceased, family members go to the grave of their ancestors to sweep away leaves and remove weeds around the grave area. Paper offerings are also burned, such as fake money.\n\nCheung Chau Bun Festival (長洲太平清醮). This festival on the tiny island of Cheung Chau features competitions with people climbing bun towers to snatch buns.\n\nTuen Ng Festival (端午節). This is a festival in memory of a national hero from the Spring and Autumn Period of Chinese history. Dragon boat races are typically held and glutinous rice dumplings, usually with pork fillings, are eaten by many.\n\nTin Hau Festival (天后誕). Celebrates the birthday of Tin Hau, a traditional Chinese goddess also known Mazu (媽祖) in Mandarin who is popular among fishermen and sailors. Celebrations are held the many Tin Hau temples throughout Hong Kong, with the most notable held at the temples in Yuen Long and Sai Kung.\n\nHungry Ghost Festival (中元節). This festival runs throughout the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. It is believed that the gates of hell open during this period and hungry ghosts are allowed to roam freely into our world. People perform various rites to appease the wandering ghosts, such as offering food and burning joss paper. You can also see traditional performances such as Chinese opera which are held to appease these ghosts.\n\nMid-Autumn Festival/Moon Festival (中秋節). This festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. Moon cakes which contain lotus seed paste and duck egg yolks are a popular delicacy. There is also an ice-cream version. Parts of Hong Kong will be festooned with decorative lanterns which set the night scene ablaze with colour.\n\nChung Yeung Festival (重陽節). It is a day also known as Autumn Remembrance, which is similar to Ching Ming in spring, where families visit the graves of their ancestors to perform cleansing rites and pay their respects. As the weather cools down during this part of the year, hiking is a good activity to do during this holiday.\n\nHalloween (萬聖節). Halloween has grown rapidly in popularity and many people dress up to party till late. Trick or treat is not common but most restaurants and shopping centres are decorated and have special programmes. For young adults and teenagers, Ocean Park and Disneyland are the places to be.\n\nChristmas (聖誕節). Christmas is celebrated Hong Kong style. The city is adorned using traditional Western decorations. Many shopping centres offer ample opportunities for children to meet Santa. Most shops and restaurants remain open. You should expect large crowds out shopping for the sales.\n\nNew Year's Eve (元旦除夕). Hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets to celebrate the New Year. There are all-night services on the MTR, night-buses, and many taxis. Fireworks go off on the harbour front, attracting large crowds on both sides: Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon side) and Central (Hong Kong Island). The party hot-spots are Causeway Bay, Lan Kwai Fong and Tsim Sha Tsui. Many people dress up and attend private parties and others flock to the streets. Hong Kong people are not great drinkers and most of them stay dry for the night. Drinking alcohol on the street is uncommon. Visitors who drink should moderate their behaviour or risk being singled out by the police.\n\nOther festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong Rugby Sevens. This annual event brings many visitors from around the world to celebrate the most entertaining installment in the IRB Sevens Series. It is a giant three-day sell-out event that takes place between the last days of March and the beginning of April.\n\nHong Kong Summer Spectacular. Dragon Boat Race, music festivals, summer sales, as well as book exhibitions, Anime Fair, all in the hottest summer parties and coolest carnival.\n\nHong Kong Summer Pop Music Festival Every summer, the Hong Kong Summer Pop Music Festival gathers top musicians who bring spectacular performances.\n\nHong Kong Arts Festival, a month-long festival of international performances, is held in February and March.\n\nMan Literary Festival, a two-week English language festival with international writers as guests, is held in March.\n\nHong Kong International Film Festival, a three-week event, is held in late March to early April.\n\nUnits of measure\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong's official system of measurement is metric, but both the traditional Chinese and British Imperial systems of measurements survive to limited extents. In particular, the traditional Chinese system of weights continues to be widely used in wet markets. While mainland China has recalibrated the traditional Chinese units to better align with the metric system, Hong Kong continues to use the traditional versions of those units, meaning that one jīn (斤, gān in Cantonese) is 604.8 g in Hong Kong, not 500g like in mainland China. While the jīn is now divided into 10 liǎng (兩, léuhng in Cantonese) in mainland China, it is still divided into 16 liǎng in Hong Kong, meaning that the Hong Kong liǎng is 37.8 g, and not 50 g like in mainland China. Public weighing scales in wet markets are required by law to display traditional Chinese, British Imperial and metric units side by side.\n\nRead\n\n[edit]\n\nIts quick rise as an economic power and unique mix of East and West has made Hong Kong an interesting destination to write about.\n\nMyself a Mandarin (Oxford in Asia), Austin Coates.

The Hong Kong variant is mostly the same as in Guangzhou across the border, but tends to incorporate some English words and slang, which frequently sounds strange to other Cantonese speakers (like \"我唔sure得唔得\", means \"I am not sure if it's okay\"). News broadcasts are in standard Cantonese. Like all Chinese languages, Cantonese is a tonal language and not easy for foreigners to master, although learning a few simple greetings will get you acquainted with locals much more easily.\n\nUnlike for Mandarin, there is no widely used romanisation system for phoneticising Cantonese. However, some accurate phonetics systems do exist for learners, such as the Yale system or Jyutping. These are rarely learnt by native speakers though, thus limiting their usefulness for written communication.\n\nEnglish is a common second language, and is spoken fluently by most white-collar professionals and business people. However, English proficiency tends to be more limited among the average working class person, particularly outside the main tourist areas. While many people can understand written English pretty well, they may not necessarily be comfortable speaking it.\n\nGovernment offices are required by law to have English-speaking staff on duty. There are three terrestrial English language TV stations: TVB Pearl, ViuTVsix, and HKIBC. English-language films in cinemas are almost always shown with the original soundtrack and Chinese subtitles, though children's films, especially animations, are often dubbed into Cantonese. English in Hong Kong generally follows British spelling and vocabulary choices.\n\nEnglish street names are seldom used among local people and taxi drivers. Even a local who speaks English fluently may not know the English name. Before you go anywhere, ask hotel staff to write down the street names using Chinese characters.\n\nMost locals are not fluent in Mandarin, but can understand it to some degree. Mandarin has been compulsory in all government schools since the handover, and with the huge influx of mainland tourists many people in the tourist industry will often speak Mandarin. Most shops in the main tourist areas, as well as all government offices, will have Mandarin-speaking staff on duty. Many locals are reluctant to communicate in Mandarin as it tends to be closely associated with perceptions of cultural domination and political interference, and some may even find it offensive to be addressed in Mandarin. If you don't speak Cantonese, it's generally better to try English first.\n\nAll official signs are bilingual in Chinese and English. Hong Kong continues to use traditional Chinese characters, and not the simplified Chinese characters used in the mainland. Similar to the use of Mandarin, some locals will be offended by the presence of simplified Chinese characters, and will insist that you use traditional Chinese characters.\n\nSome of Hong Kong's older residents may speak other dialects such as Hakka, Teochew and Shanghainese, but they are generally able to speak Cantonese as well. You may also hear other languages among Hong Kong's non-Chinese minorities, but people in these groups generally speak English, and often Cantonese as well.\n\nHong Kong Sign Language (HKSL, 香港手語) is the language of the deaf community. It is mutually intelligible with Macau Sign Language, and more distantly related to Chinese Sign Language used in the mainland, not mutually intelligible with it.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nImmigration\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong maintains a separate immigration system from that of Mainland China. Citizens of most Western countries do not need a visa to visit Hong Kong. The Hong Kong visa can be applied for at a Chinese diplomatic mission, but must be done so separately from the Mainland Chinese one; there is no single visa that serves both areas. A visa is required to enter Mainland China from Hong Kong and vice versa. Macau is also a separate jurisdiction with regards to visas. If you wish to re-enter Mainland China after visiting Hong Kong, make sure you have a multiple-entry Chinese visa.\n\nSee Entry requirements to Hong Kong for a list of visa requirements or visa-free stays by country of citizenship. All holders of an APEC Business Travel Card can use the counters for Hong Kong residents at immigration control and can stay for up to 60 days in Hong Kong visa-free if their card has 'HKG' printed on the reverse.\n\nForeign nationals who cannot enter visa-free, want to remain for longer than permitted by their visa exemption, or want to work, study or establish/join a business, can apply for one at a Chinese embassy or consulate, or directly through the Hong Kong Immigration Department. Those living in Macau can apply for a visa at the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Those living in Mainland China may apply at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai, or at the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR in Beijing.\n\nHolders of Chinese passports must apply for a appropriate entry permit (往來港澳通行證) to enter Hong Kong, except when transiting through Hong Kong, whereby visa-free access is granted for up to seven days. They do not need to use a PRC passport if using such an entry permit. Chinese passport holders may apply for an Entry Permit of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued by any overseas Chinese embassy/consulate.\n\nHolders of Macau permanent identity cards or Visit Permits with permanent resident status can enter Hong Kong visa-free for up to 180 days. Holders of Macao Visit Permits without permanent resident status can enter Hong Kong visa-free for up to 30 days. See Visit/Transit Arrangements to Hong Kong for Macao Residents for more details. Though they can be used when leaving Macau, Macau digital identity cards are not accepted by Hong Kong immigration, and the physical one must be presented when entering Hong Kong.\n\nCitizens of Taiwan are granted visa-free access to Hong Kong for 30 days if they have a Mainland Travel Permit/Taiwan Compatriot Pass (Taibaozheng, 台胞證). Otherwise, a pre-arrival registration is required which can be applied for through the Immigration Department. See Arrangements for Entry to Hong Kong for Overseas Chinese and Chinese residents of Taiwan for more details. \"Chinese residents of Taiwan\" refers to citizens of Taiwan.\n\nHolders of British National (Overseas) (BNO) passports cannot use these passports to enter Hong Kong and should instead use their Hong Kong passport, Hong Kong ID card, or Hong Kong document of identity when passing immigration and during their stay in Hong Kong.\n\nExpiry of the limit of stay is counted from the day after the date of entry. For example, if you have a 7-day visa and arrive on January 1, you are allowed to stay until January 8. If you are arriving late at night, you may want to wait until after midnight to clear immigration. Likewise, you may be able to clear immigration just before midnight on the last day that your visa is valid and then take a flight or boat in the middle of the night on the next day. For more information, see question #11 of the Visa FAQs.\n\nHong Kong no longer issues passport stamps, and visitors are instead given an entry slip with their terms of entry. All entries and exits are recorded electronically as well.\n\ne-Channel\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular visitors can register to use the e-Channel to avoid the queues by going through an automated barrier which uses fingerprint recognition technology. You may be eligible to use e-Channel if you are a Macau resident or have electronic travel documents issued from a list of over 100 countries. You can also enrol on the basis of membership in some frequent flyer programmes (some of which require you to possess status in their upper tiers).\n\nHong Kong permanent residents can use e-Channels labelled for visitors if the gates for permanent residents are congested.\n\nCustoms\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you are carrying goods that are banned or more than your allowance, you must declare them at the Red Channel when you enter Hong Kong — even when travelling from Mainland China, Macau or Taiwan:\n\nMeat and eggs, animal products, fish, rice (exceeding 15 kg)\n\nOzone depleting substances, items with forged trade marks, radio communication transmitting apparatus\n\nSmokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes, and herbal cigarettes\n\nA traveller aged 18 or above is allowed to bring into Hong Kong – for their own use – as part of their duty-free allowance:\n\n1 litre of alcoholic liquor with an alcoholic strength above 30% by volume measured at a temperature of 20 °C\n\n19 cigarettes or 1 cigar or 25 g of cigars or 25 g of other manufactured tobacco\n\nIf the traveller holds a Hong Kong Identity Card, they must have spent 24 hours or longer outside Hong Kong to benefit from the duty-free allowance relating to alcoholic liquor.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has restricted the amount of baby milk powder formula that may be taken out of the territory to no more than 1.8 kg. Violation of this restriction could lead to fines and imprisonment.\n\nFor more information, visit the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department website.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong International Airport\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hong Kong International Airport\n\nHong Kong International Airport (HKG IATA), also known as Chek Lap Kok 赤鱲角, is on Lantau Island in the west of Hong Kong. The airport's article provides details on airlines that fly here, and on transportation from the airport to the city by the MTR Airport Express train, public bus, taxis. Taxis are expensive for single travellers and pairs because of the distance and tollsand for harbour tunnel crossings. Taxis are often slow because of downtown traffic.\n\nShenzhen International Airport\n\n[edit]\n\nAs flights between Hong Kong and mainland China are treated as international flights, it is often cheaper to fly to Shenzhen Airport (SZX IATA), in the nearby mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.\n\nTo travel between Shenzhen Airport and Hong Kong:\n\nDirect buses operate between the airport and the Elements Shopping Mall, above the Kowloon MTR station. You can check-in and receive your boarding pass (except for China Southern Airlines passengers) at the check-in desk on the 1st floor of the shopping centre, opposite Starbucks. This in-town check-in is completely separate from the in-town check-in provided for Hong Kong International Airport. The cost of the service is $100 and the bus is advertised to take 75 minutes, but it usually takes 100 minutes. Buses run every 30 minutes from 6:30AM to 7PM from Hong Kong and from 10AM to 9PM from Shenzhen.\n\nFrom Fuyong Ferry Terminal at Shenzhen Airport one can buy ferry tickets to Hong Kong. Passengers who need to transfer between flights at Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports can use the ferry service to/from Hong Kong airport without having to pass through Hong Kong immigration.\n\nA cheaper way is to take Shenzhen Metro Line 11 from the airport to Futian in central Shenzhen (29 minutes, ¥7). From here, you can connect to the High Speed Rail direct to West Kowloon in downtown Hong Kong (15 minutes, $80). Even cheaper is taking Shenzhen Metro Line 10 to \"Futian Checkpoint\" (10 minutes, ¥2) (called Lok Ma Chau on the Hong Kong side) or Shenzhen Metro Line 1 to \"Luohu\" (20 minutes, ¥4) (Lo Wu on the Hong Kong side), then pass through a long corridor and an international border gate (have visa ready) and once in Hong Kong, hop on the East Rail suburban rail line to central Hong Kong (45 minutes, $35).\n\nGuangzhou Baiyun International Airport\n\n[edit]\n\nGuangzhou Baiyun International Airport is a bit further away than Shenzhen, but has more flights and with direct coach connections to Hong Kong.\n\nMacau International Airport\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is also often cheaper to fly out of Macau International Airport (MFM IATA). Air Asia has a hub at Macau from where it operates service to Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, and Chiang Mai, among other cities.\n\nTo travel between Macau Airport and Hong Kong:\n\nWith the Express Link service, you can transfer directly from airport to ferry (or vice versa) without going through Macau immigration. $70 from Hong Kong (with baggage being checked in there) or $50 to Hong Kong, excluding the ferry ticket cost.\n\nIf you don't need a visa for Macau, the cheaper way is to clear Macau immigration and to go yourself to Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal just to the north from the airport. Outside of the airport, take a bus MT1 or 26 from \"Rotunda de Aeroporto / Wai Long\" bus stop, and get out at the terminal (normally the next stop). The ticket price is HK$4.2 or MOP4.2. From the airport, it's wise to get some change before taking this bus, and both the ATMs normally dispense both Hong Kong dollars and and Macanese pataca, and the local shops accept the former in lieu of the latter (at 1:1 rate). You may get coins of both currencies as a change. It would take around 20 minutes to walk to the ferry terminal. If coming from Hong Kong, choose Cotai Water Jet ferry to get to Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal.\n\nthe AP1 bus will transport you to Macau Outer Ferry Terminal, but the bus trip will take longer as it will have to cross to the mainland part of Macau.\n\nThose having a few hours to spare in Macau and not much baggage may choose to take one of the buses going to one of the casinos (Venetian, Sands, etc.) waiting both near the airport and the Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal, spend some time there, then return to either ferry terminal or the airport using a similar bus. These buses are free of charge.\n\nBy helicopter\n\n[edit]\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Rail travel in China\n\nMultiple frequent high-speed trains connect Hong Kong with Shenzhen and Guangzhou every day, with one daily long-distance service each from Beijing and Shanghai. MTR High Speed runs some high-speed passenger services up to Guangzhou under the Vibrant Express brand, while CRH (the high-speed branch of China Railways) operates the remaining short-distance trains and all the long-distances ones. It takes 23 minutes from Shenzhen, 48 minutes from Guangzhou, 8½ hours from Shanghai and 9 hours from Beijing on the daytime trains. Overnight high-speed sleeper services from Shanghai and Beijing run four times a week, taking 11 hr 14 min and 12 hr 34 min respectively. The line runs underground in Hong Kong, so don't expect to see any sights. High-speed rail is now your only option for travelling by train directly from the mainland.\n\nServices on this line go to the . This station is huge, although most of its footprint is underground. There is a food court (important as many shorter services don't have a dining car, including all Vibrant Express trains), as well as other facilities such as a business lounge and public waiting spaces. It is connected to Austin station on Tuen Ma line and Kowloon station on the Tung Chung and Airport lines, and to a bus complex.\n\nThe station has several levels:\n\nL2 - Sky Corridor\n\nL1 - Various footbridge connections\n\nG - Station entrance, transport area, ground level\n\nB1 - Ticketing\n\nB2 - Arrival Concourse, Parking\n\nB3 - Departure Concourse\n\nB4 - Platforms\n\nThrough a joint checkpoint arrangement, both Mainland and Hong Kong immigration and customs are at this station. The station's Mainland Port Area is under Mainland China's legal jurisdiction, and is demarcated by a yellow line. When you clear immigration to board a train at West Kowloon, you are subject to Mainland Chinese law. Chinese Internet censorship doesn't apply to the Mainland Port Area, as mobile Internet service is provided by Hong Kong operators.\n\nYou can travel by a wider range of high-speed trains and overnight sleepers from many Chinese cities to Shenzhen, and then change to the Metro or another high-speed rail train to reach Hong Kong. Shenzhen railway station is adjacent to the Lo Wu/Luohu border crossing.\n\nBy ferry\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong is a one-hour hydrofoil ride away from Macau and there are also good connections from mainland China. If you plan to only visit Zhuhai, a visa-on-arrival is available at the Jiuzhou Ferry Terminal for up to 3 days. The main terminals are:\n\nOperating to , 202 Connaught Rd (Sheung Wan MTR exit D) in Central.\n\nTurboJet, every 5–30 minutes, 24 hours a day from Macau.\n\nCotai Jet, every 15–30 minutes, 24 hours a day from Taipa, Macau.\n\nOperating to , 33 Canton Rd (Tsim Sha Tsui MTR exit A1) in Kowloon.\n\nChu Kong Passenger Transport, from Zhuhai and various other points in mainland China's Guangdong Province.\n\nTurboJet, every 30 minutes from Macau.\n\nXunlong[dead link] from Shekou in Shenzhen, mainland China.\n\nIf you're flying into Hong Kong airport to reach Macau or other cities in the Pearl River Delta, see Hong Kong International Airport for direct ferry options that skip Hong Kong immigration.\n\nBy cruise ship\n\n[edit]\n\nis a cruise ship terminal that opened at the former Kai Tak Airport runway. The terminal supports two large ship berths. The terminal has free shuttle service to nearby shopping and public transit. Check with your cruise line before you travel to find out which terminal your ship berths at.\n\nBy bridge\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 50-km Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (HZMB), a bridge and tunnel opened in October 2018, was one of the largest construction projects in the world. The link makes it possible to travel quickly across the Pearl River Delta without taking the ferry.\n\nFrequent HZMBus shuttle buses departing up to every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day are available to cross the HZMB. They take around 40 minutes, and tickets can be purchased with Octopus or AliPay from ticket machines, as well as cash and credit cards at the ticket desk at the . The Hong Kong Port can be reached by taxis or various buses including CityFlyer airport (A number) routes, or the B5 shuttle bus from Sunny Bay MTR station, or the B6 bus from Tung Chung. Once arriving at the you can take taxis or the 101X bus, the 102X bus to St Paul's and Taipa, or the HZMB Integrated Resort Connection bus (free) to Taipa Ferry Terminal or the Exterior Ferry terminal to connect to the free casino shuttle buses. Once arriving at the HZMB Zhuhai Port, you can take taxis or the L1 bus which uses historic tourist vehicles, or the 12, 23 or 25 buses to continue your journey in the mainland.\n\nTo drive across the bridge, you must apply for a permit from the mainland government if travelling to Zhuhai or three separate permits (one from each of the Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland governments) to drive to Macau.\n\nBy other land crossings\n\n[edit]\n\nShenzhen is the Chinese city that borders Hong Kong. See China#Get in for information on visa requirements.\n\nThere are 8 land checkpoints between Hong Kong and mainland China. Be sure to note the opening hours of the border crossing before starting your journey. If you are driving across the border, you must have a set of plates issued by each of China and Hong Kong. You will have to change sides of the road at the border because people in Hong Kong drive on the left, and people in mainland China drive on the right.\n\nCross-boundary coaches travel to Hong Kong from several cities in mainland China and are usually easier than crossing the border via several transfers and several modes of transportation. For information on these bus services, see the website of each border crossing listed below. Other than the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, these crossings are within the Frontier Closed Area, meaning it's illegal to head there without a permit unless you are crossing the border.\n\n(train and pedestrian crossing): MTR trains from Hung Hom run to Lo Wu every 5–8 minutes. Luohu station on Shenzhen Metro Line 1 and Shenzhen Railway Station (for long-distance trains) lie just beyond the mainland China immigration checkpoint. This control point can only be accessed by the MTR East Rail Line and crossing the border can only be done on foot. It is often congested with travellers during weekends and holidays, so use other control points to avoid the long queues. Visa-on-arrival for up to 5 days can be obtained on the mainland Chinese side for certain nationalities if you only plan to visit Shenzhen.\n\n(pedestrian crossing): Some northbound East Rail Line trains terminate here. It can also be reached from Yuen Long by KMB bus B1[dead link] or by GMB minibus #75. After crossing the double-decked Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang pedestrian bridge, passengers will find themselves at the Futian immigration checkpoint of the mainland. On the Shenzhen side, Futian Checkpoint station on Shenzhen Metro Line 4 is just after the immigration checkpoint. This control point is less crowded than Lo Wu, and it's more convenient for travellers to central and western Shenzhen. Visa-on-arrival for up to 5 days can be obtained on the mainland Chinese side for some nationalities if you only plan to visit Shenzhen.\n\n(road, bus, and pedestrian crossing): This crossing consists of separate facilities for pedestrians arriving by bus and for road vehicles and is the only border control point which is open 24-hours per day. Lok Ma Chau Public Transport Interchange can be reached via KMB buses 76K, 276B and N73. Alternatively, you can take express buses from Hong Kong directly to the control point. After passing through Hong Kong Immigration control, you must board the same bus at the other side of the control point, where you will be taken to Huanggang port in Shenzhen to pass through mainland China immigration control, with connection to Huanggang Checkpoint station on Shenzhen Metro Line 7 . A shuttle service, known as the \"Yellow Bus\" operates between and Huanggang Port of the mainland side.\n\n(road and bus crossing): This crossing is mostly used by private vehicles and cross-border buses. See \"By bus\" section below.\n\n(road, bus, and pedestrian crossing): the furthest east control point, it can be accessed by taking cross-border coaches. Predominantly serving travellers towards Eastern Guangdong and Fujian, it is far from the centre of Shenzhen and is relatively quiet. There are no mainland visa-on-arrival facilities. See \"By bus\" section below.\n\n(road and bus crossing): This control point links Hong Kong directly with Shekou, Shenzhen. It can be used by private vehicles and cross-boundary buses. See \"By bus\" section below.\n\n(road and bus crossing): Also refer to Hong Kong#By bridge\n\n(road and bus crossing): This checkpoint is integrated with a bus terminal. Citybus route B7 and green minibus route 59S provides access to Sheung Shui and Fanling, while on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, Citybus route B8 and KMB route B9 connects the checkpoint with Tai Wai and Tuen Mun. A carpark is also available there, so drivers without Mainland plate or license can park there and connect to Mainland public transport. On the Mainland side, Liantang Checkpoint station on Shenzhen Metro Line 2/8 and bus services are available for travellers.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Hong Kong, bicycles are forbidden from all tunnels and most highways. Therefore, very few Hongkongers use a bike as a substitute for public transport. However, roads in the country parks, because of the hilly landscape, are ideal for mountain biking. See the information on cycling in 'Get around' below.\n\nYou are not permitted to cycle across the border into Hong Kong from mainland China. However, you can bring a bicycle from Shenzhen into Hong Kong by following the procedures below:\n\nYou can bring a bicycle across the border at Lo Wu Control Point, then board the MTR East Rail train. Bicycles are allowed on the train with a payment of between $20 and $40, depending upon the time of day, and provided that the front wheel is removed. You can alight at Sheung Shui station and continue the rest of your journey by bicycle if you wish.\n\nGMB minibus #75 operates between the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and Yuen Long for $7 and allows a folded bike with 50 cm wheels. While most passengers take a bus connecting to urban areas, it's possible for bikers to take the \"yellow bus\" ($7) just to the other side of the border. There is not much luggage space on this bus and you may be required to disassemble your bike.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong has an excellent and cheap public transport system. Unlike in mainland China, Google Maps can be used in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has the world's highest use of public transport, with over 90% preferring the mode. However, you cannot use China's China T-union card as a payment for public transport in Hong Kong: you must have an Octopus Card, a prepaid card to pay for public transport within Hong Kong. Joint Octopus-T-Union cards are also available, which allows you to use the card in most major mainland Chinese cities as well.\n\nOctopus card\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Octopus Card (八達通, Bat Dat Toong in Cantonese) is a prepaid card that can be used to pay for public transportation such as the MTR, trains, trams, buses, mini-buses, and ferries. Most taxis do not yet accept it although more will in future. Paying for public transport with an Octopus Card is usually at a discounted fare (not the case though for buying a return Airport Express ticket).\n\nIt can also be used to pay for items in convenience stores, supermarkets, fast food restaurant chains, many vending machines, all roadside parking and some car parks. It can also be used as a building access card. Some chain stores, such as Wellcome, offer discounts for paying with the Octopus Card. This is a great way to avoid carrying and counting coins.\n\nBasic Octopus cards cost $150 ($100 in credit plus a $50 refundable deposit). A $11 service charge applies if the card is redeemed for the deposit within 3 months. The maximum value an Octopus card can carry is $3,000. The credit on the card can go negative. For example, you may pay for a ride costing $5 with only $2 of remaining value on the card (bringing the stored value to −$3) but you cannot use the card again until the value is topped up. The value of an Octopus card can go as low as −$35. That isn't really \"negative\", meaning you don't have to pay MTR back, since your $50 deposit secures it.\n\nYour Octopus card's balance is displayed on the reader after each use. The balance can also be checked, along with the last nine transactions, using a small machine near regular ticket machines at MTR stations.\n\nIt is simple and convenient to top up your Octopus Card:\n\n\"Add Value\" machines, usually next to regular ticket machines in MTR stations.\n\nCustomer service centres at all MTR stations\n\nSome merchants that accept Octopus (e.g. 7-Eleven, McDonald's, Wellcome, etc.). This is the best way to avoid queues at the MTR station.\n\nOctopus for Tourists App\n\nTop-ups are generally possible in multiples of $50 only. The Octopus for Tourists app allows for top-up in multiples of $1 but with a higher minimum of $100.\n\nA joint Octopus-China T-Union Card can be used in most major cities across China (notable exceptions include Wuhan and Hohhot).\n\nMTR Fare Saver Machines\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several fare saver machines across the MTR system. By tapping your Octopus Card at the reader on one of such machines, you will receive a $1–2 discount on your same-day next MTR journey if such a journey originates from one of the stations indicated on that machine. However, only one such machine services many of the indicated stations, and are often far away from the indicated stations. Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui are tricky cases: the machine at The Gateway at Harbour City offers the discount for the former but not the latter, whilst the machine at the Peninsula Centre offers the discount for both.\n\nBy Mass Transit Railway\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is the fastest way to get around, but it does not offer the views of buses and trams. It is clean, safe, reliable and efficient. There are 5 underground lines, 4 suburban rail lines, the Airport Express, and a network of modern light rail lines in the Northwest New Territories.\n\nThe most important lines for many visitors are the busy Tsuen Wan Line (red), which runs from Central to Kowloon via tunnel and then down Nathan Road towards Tsuen Wan in the New Territories, and the Island Line (blue) which runs along the north coast of Hong Kong Island. The Tung Chung Line (orange) is the fastest ways to get to Lantau and one of the cheapest ways to/from the airport via the S1 shuttle bus from/to Tung Chung MTR station. This line can also be used to change to the Disneyland Resort Line (pink) at Sunny Bay, which is also the station catch a shuttle bus to take you to the Hong Kong port for those who want to travel by another bus to Macau. All signs are in both Chinese and English and all announcements are made in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Staff in the station control room usually speak enough English to be able to help lost tourists. The South Island Line can also be used to visit Ocean Park.\n\nIn Cantonese, the East Rail line is colloquially referred to as 火車 (fó chē), alluding to its origins as an intercity railway, while the other lines are referred to as 地鐵 (dei tit).\n\nConsiderations when using the MTR:\n\nHong Kong's suburban rail system is linked to two border crossings with mainland China, at Lo Wu Control Point and Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point, both on the East Rail Line. You pass through a short corridor and then through a large border gate before entering a long one-way corridor and emerging in mainland China, at a station for the Shenzhen Metro. As Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations are in a restricted area, it is illegal to take the train to these stations without a permit unless you are crossing the border.\n\nRides on East Rail line First Class, the Airport Express, and to/from Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau follow a separate fare structure. MTR system promotions (including the tourist day pass, and the fare saver machines) do not extend to these services.\n\nThe East Rail Line offers a first class car where the seats are wider and more comfortable. The fare is twice that of the regular cars on the same route, and you must buy a separate ticket at a station's ticketing office or validate your Octopus card before entering. Ticket inspectors conduct regular patrol in the carriage and passengers without a valid first class ticket or validated Octopus card may be fined up to $500.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the English name for the underground metro system is the 'MTR'. The term 'Subway' refers to underground walkways, as opposed to the metro system. 'Metro' or 'Underground' are not commonly understood by local people either.\n\nFares depend on distance. Credit cards cannot be used to buy tickets on most vending machines. However you can tap contactless Visa cards (or Apple or Android pay devices linked to Visa) at the MTR fare gates to pay fares. Visa and Mastercard may also be used to top up Octopus cards via the Octopus for Tourists App.\n\nTsim Sha Tsui on the Tsuen Wan line and East Tsim Sha Tsui on the Tuen Ma line are\n\nconsidered one station for purposes of fare calculation and transfers. But to transfer from one line to the other on those stations without incurring additional costs, you must tap out from one station and tap in within 30 minutes to the other.\n\nConsumption of food and drinks and smoking are strictly forbidden in the paid area of stations and in trains. Offenders are liable to a fine of up to $2,000.\n\nAlways stand on the right when using escalators to allow people to pass on the left. * Hong Kongers do not shove or jostle for seats as is common in mainland Chinese Metro systems.\n\nDisabled Access and Stroller Access is provided at the MTR stations, but you may have to walk a long way: the lift may be at one end of a platform at train level, whilst the lift to street level will be at the other end. There is usually one designated fare reader for wider (wheelchair/stroller) access, but often it is a long walk around the station or platform. Occasionally, there will be an MTR staff booth at a set of gates, but they may or may not tap your card on their terminal and let you through the goods entrance to the platform. It may be better to collapse your stroller, pick up your child and use the escalators and regular fare readers. A small, lightweight, upright folding stroller will be easier to use on transit.\n\nSome adjacent stations are served by the same two lines (e.g. Central and Admiralty on the Tsuen Wan and Island lines; Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Prince Edward on the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines). However some of these stations offer quicker and more convenient cross-platform interchanges than others depending on the direction of transfer. Watch the flashing system maps on the train and listen to the announcements to know which of the stations are convenient for the transfers you wish to make.\n\nBy tram\n\n[edit]\n\nOperated by Hong Kong Tramways, the narrow double-decker city trams (also known locally as \"ding ding\") trundling along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island have provided cheap transport for over a century. Riding the tram is a great and cheap way to sightsee. For an excursion lasting 1 hour, board at the Kennedy Town Terminus and get a good seat on the upper deck. As the tram travels eastward, you will have an elevated view of Hong Kong Island and its different flavours, from bustling Hong Kong street life to its glitzy financial and shopping districts and, finally, a taste of the local residential areas.\n\nTrams are not air conditioned. Summer months can be very uncomfortable even with the windows open.\n\nThey run 6AM-midnight.\n\nPassengers board at the rear and a flat $3 fare is paid when getting off at the front of the tram. The fare is paid for by Octopus Card, coins (no change given) or contactless Visa/Mastercard (including Apple Pay and Google Pay). Using a contactless Visa provides a $1 discount. There are two readers - one for Octopus Card and the other for contactless Visa/Mastercard, so if you are using Apple Pay with both an Octopus Card and Visa/Mastercard, be careful to tap your device on the correct reader.\n\nIt is the favourite means of transportation for Hong Kong's large foreign domestic helper community on Sundays (their normal day-off) and may get crowded on that day.\n\nPeak Tram\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Peak Tram, Hong Kong's first mechanised mode of transport, opened in 1888. The remarkably steep 1.7-km track from Central up to Victoria Peak is worth at least one trip despite the comparatively steep price ($62 one-way, $88 return; return tickets must be purchased in advance). The tram turnstiles take Octopus cards.\n\nThe Peak Tram is likely to be crowded at night when the view of the city's skyline is magic, and on public holidays. Queues can be very long (waiting an hour is common at busy times), and a lot of pushing has been reported.\n\nThe tram is not the only way to get to the Peak, and there are cheaper (but slower and still quite scenic) alternatives such as the #1 green minibus costing $10.2, and the #15 double-decker bus costing $10.3 from Exchange Square Bus Terminus. These buses will often give you great views of both sides of Hong Kong Island on the way up.\n\nLight rail\n\n[edit]\n\nMTR operates a tram system in the northwest New Territories called Light Rail. It is a modern and fast tram system connecting Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, and Tin Shui Wai. It uses a proof-of-payment fare system, in which passengers are required to buy a ticket or tap an Octopus card at the station entrance before boarding and there are no fare gates, but ticket inspection is random. The area is seldom visited by foreign tourists but various sights are nonetheless accessible via Light Rail, such as numerous ancient walled villages (highlighted by the Ping Shan Heritage Trail), the Hong Kong Wetland Park, the beaches of Tuen Mun New Town, Yuen Long Town Centre, and seafood towns like Lau Fau Shan and Sam Shing.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTip on bus routes\n\nAlphabets in bus routes represent the nature of the route. As a rule of thumb:\n\nBus routes start with A terminates at or stops at the airport.\n\nBus routes start with B terminates at land border crossings.\n\nBus routes start with E connects Lantau Island and the city centre. They may or may not stop at the airport.\n\nBus routes start with N are night routes.\n\nBus routes start with K are MTR feeder routes which terminates at MTR stations.\n\nBus routes start with W terminates at West Kowloon Station. Other bus routes also serve the station and neighbouring Kowloon Station, but may take longer time to reach your destination.\n\nBus routes end with M terminate at MTR stations.\n\nBus routes end with K terminate at East line or Tuen Ma line stations.\n\nBus routes end with P are commuter routes which only operate within rush hours.\n\nBus routes end with R are holiday and public activity routes, which only operate on holidays or immediately after the activity has ended.\n\nBus routes end with X are express routes.\n\n3-digit bus routes starting with 1, 6, 9 are cross-harbour routes that pass through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, Eastern Harbour Crossing and Western Harbour Crossing respectively.\n\n3-digit bus routes starting with 3 are commuter cross-harbour routes which only operate within rush hours.\n\n3-digit bus routes starting with 8 are horse-racing routes that departs from Sha Tin Racecourse. They only operate on horse-racing days and do not transport passengers to the racecourse.\n\nThere are three types of buses available in Hong Kong. In city centre, buses will get stuck in traffic and take much longer than the MTR. However, they cover many more destinations than the MTR. While generally easy to use, signs in English can be sparse and finding your bus stop can get difficult. Buses are also the only public option in some areas. Google Maps, Apple Maps, or City Mapper will let you know the best bus route to take from your current position to destination (if necessary, they will combine it with MTR rides too).\n\nDouble-decker buses are used on most routes and cover practically the entire territory, stop frequently and charge varying fares depending on the distance. The first seats of the upper deck offer great views.\n\nThe franchised bus operators in Hong Kong include Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) (and its subsidiary Long Win Bus), Citybus (CTB) and New Lantau Bus (NLB). Route and fare information can be found on their company websites. Alternatively it is also wise to install transportation apps such as \"App 1933\" and \"CitybusNWFB\" into your smartphone to check fares outdoors if you use mobile devices regularly during your stay.\n\nThe resort towns of Discovery Bay and Ma Wan have separate bus services provided by their real-estate developers, namely Discovery Bay Transportation Services[dead link] and Park Island Transport.\n\nFares depend more on where you board rather than where you get-off (except for the cross-boundary route B2 and a few overnight buses) which means it is more expensive to board at an earlier stop on a route rather than the later ones. Hence, the price of bus rides crossing the harbour between Kowloon and the Island exceeds $9 prior to the crossing. The fare is displayed on a digital display above the farebox - one may pay cash (but no change is given), an Octopus Card, a contactless VISA or Mastercard (on some routes; including those embedded on Apple Pay and Google Pay), or a ticket purchased from a bus travel centre (only applicable to a few routes found at major transit hubs such as Star Ferry or Central Bus Terminus) must be used. There are plenty of bus routes that provide a fare discount for transferring with a particular set of routes; they are often confusing for visitors, however instructions are written on bus stop timetable leaflets. There are also some bus routes (especially the routes going to Stanley) which offer discount if a passenger gets off early and taps the Octopus card again prior to alighting.\n\nThere are announcements in Cantonese, Mandarin and English except for most buses on New Lantau Bus. To catch your bus, go to the bus stop with the right number and when your bus approaches, raise your arm to hail the bus (like you would hail a taxi). Buses only stop when requested so press the red buzzer (by the exit doors and on the grab-rails) to signal to the driver that you want to alight. Always board at the front and alight from the centre door.\n\nThe MTR also maintains a fleet of feeder buses. MTR passengers can enjoy a free feeder service if the bus trip is paid for on an Octopus card along with a connecting railway journey (except for taking K12 on holidays).\n\nBy public light buses/minibuses\n\n[edit]\n\nVan-sized public light buses or minibuses serve both feeder and trunk routes, carry a maximum of 19 passengers (seats only) and come in two varieties, red minibuses and green minibuses (the red buses are also called maxicabs); the colour refers to a wide stripe painted on top of the vehicle.\n\nMost minibus station signs only offer Chinese description, and may have nothing more than the route number on the sign. Location markers of minibus stations on online maps are also spotty. Translation apps like Google Translate (including its camera function) and asking other passengers about the route are useful ways to determine whether the route serves your destination.\n\nRiding a minibus may not be easy for travellers, as it is required to call out the name of the stop and/or ask the driver to stop in Cantonese (shouting please stop loudly in English usually suffices), but more light buses are equipped with bells to notify the driver. Some station names used by minibuses may be outdated.\n\nIf a minibus station requires diversion from a green minibus' usual route and nobody on the minibus asked to stop, drivers may ignore the stop and take short cuts. The foolproof way for travellers is to inform the driver of your destination and remind the driver again when the minibus is approaching your destination.\n\nMinibuses sometimes depart from terminus only if they're full, so consider include waiting time if you're boarding a minibus at its terminus.\n\nSome red minibuses still do not accept Octopus but will give you change, while green minibuses accept Octopus payment but cannot give you change if you pay in cash. Prices on red minibuses are often displayed only in Chinese numbers. The price displayed on a red minibus can vary according to the market price, so one might need to pay more at busy times and on special occasions (such as during a typhoon or demonstration), though it is rare.\n\nMinibus drivers generally drive fast, especially at night. Always use minibus seatbelts where available, as it's against the law not to use them. All have a large digital speedometer in the cabin to discourage speeding and accidents. Dial ☏ to report dangerous driving practices by minibus drivers if you encounter them.\n\nSeatbelts are often ignored by minibus passengers, but the police occasionally have an annual or bi-annual crackdown where offenders may be fined. Faulty seatbelts may also be encountered even on newer minibuses: show it to the police officers, and they would likely to spare you from tickets.\n\nThe Hong Kong Island green minibus #1 down from the Peak to Central is particularly exhilarating. Red minibuses tend to have a more Chinese feel than green buses.\n\nThere are six independent route numbering systems, applying to: buses (i) on Hong Kong Island, (ii) in Kowloon and the New Territories, and (iii) on Lantau Island; green minibuses (iv) on Hong Kong Island, (v) in Kowloon, and (vi) in New Territories and several exceptional auxiliary bus routes. Red minibuses do not usually have a route number. This leads to duplication of routes in different regions.\n\nGenerally you need not mention which district the route belongs to when you are asking for directions (almost all people will assume you are asking for the route which runs in the district you are in), but you really need to mention whether the route is by bus or minibus when you ask, since in some cases both buses and minibuses can have the same route number in the same area which are different routes.\n\nBy ferry\n\n[edit]\n\nA large fleet of ferries sail between the many islands of Hong Kong. The granddaddy of them all and an attraction in itself is the Star Ferry, whose most popular line travels between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central from early morning until late at night, and offers amazing views (especially when coming from Tsim Sha Tsui). The Star Ferry is an icon of Hong Kong heritage and has carried passengers for over 120 years. Taking its 11-minute ride across the harbour and catching some misty breeze is considered a \"must do\" when visiting Hong Kong. Navigation enthusiasts will also not want to miss the sight of the crew using a billhook to catch the thrown rope as it moors at the pier, a practice unchanged since the first ferry ran in 1888.\n\nUpper deck seats cost $2.50 on weekdays and $3.40 on weekends while the lower deck costs $2.00 on weekdays and $2.80 on weekends, both payable with Octopus, cash (no change given) or by onsite vending machine. The Star Ferry also operates between Tsim Sha Tsui and Wanchai but only offers upper-deck seating. A 4-day tourist ticket is also available for $25.\n\nFerries to Lamma, Lantau and other islands depart from a variety of ports, but the largest and most important terminal is at Central adjacent to the Star Ferry. Ferries are usually divided into fast ferries and slow ferries, with fast ferries charging around twice the price for half the journey time, although not all destinations offer both kinds of service. Example fares for trips from Central to Yung Shue Wan (Lamma) are $10/15 slow/fast, and to Mui Wo (Lantau) $10.50/$21. All fares increase by around 50% on Sundays and public holidays. There is soemthimes an extra charge for seating in an air-conditioned area.\n\nFerry services known as kai-to (街渡/街艔) serve the city's most remote islands, in which some are also tourist attractions. These ferries are often operated by small motorised sampans. A list of these services can be found on the website of the Transport Department, and are listed on Apple Maps as proper ferries.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are plentiful and efficient. They are extremely cheap compared to many other large cities.\n\nThere are three types of taxi in Hong Kong, easily identified by their colours: red, green and blue, all of which serve the airport and Hong Kong Disneyland. When in doubt, just take a red taxi. Rates for each type of taxi are published online. Rates as of July 2024:\n\nName of taxi Taxi colour Service area Flag down (for first 2 km) Rate for extra 200 m or 2 minutes of waiting higher rate lower rate Urban Red Anywhere except Southern Lantau Island $29 $2.10 (up to $102.50) $1.40 (after $102.50) New Territories Green $25.50 $1.90 (up to $82.50) $1.40 (after $82.50) Lantau Blue Lantau Island, Hong Kong International Airport and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port. $24 $1.90 (up to $195) $1.60 (after $195)\n\nConsiderations when riding taxis:\n\nWearing of seat belts is required by law for the driver and all passengers. Drivers have the right to refuse carrying any passenger who refuses to comply, and will not carry more passengers than the number of seat belts.\n\nTipping is usually not required or expected, however the driver will sometimes round the fare up to the nearest dollar.\n\nDrivers are required to provide change for $100 notes, but not for higher denominations. If you only have a $500 or $1000 note and are going through a tunnel, let the driver know beforehand and he will change it when paying at the toll booth.\n\nSome taxis accept credit cards and Octopus cards to avoid hassles with small change; these are usually indicated by a sticker in the windshield.\n\nThere are no extra late-night charges nor peak-hour surcharges. No charges are levied for travel to/from the airport or within downtown but all toll charges for tunnels are added to the bill. The driver will normally pay on your behalf at the toll booth and you just need to reimburse him before alighting.\n\nBaggage carried in the boot (\"trunk\" if coming from North America) will cost you $5 per piece even if you lift it yourself, except for wheelchairs.\n\nHarbour crossing passengers (Hong Kong Island to Kowloon or vice versa) are expected to pay the return tolls. But you can use this to your advantage by picking a homebound taxi from a cross-harbour taxi rank in places like the Star Ferry pier or Hung Hom station. In these cross-harbour taxi stands only single toll charge will be applied to the taxi fare.\n\nTaxi drivers must display an official name card that includes the driver's photograph and the license plate number. Unless a taxi has an out of service sign displayed, they are legally required to take you to your destination. They must provide a receipt upon request. You may file a complaint to the Transport Complaints Unit Complaint Hotline at ☏ or via their online complaint form.\n\nAll taxis are radio equipped and can be reserved and requested via an operator for $5, payable to the driver. You are unlikely to need to call a taxi, though, as they are plentiful.\n\nTaxi drivers may know only basic English. Take your hotel's business card to show the driver the address in Chinese. Get a local person to write the name or address of your destination in Chinese. When using a maps app on a phone, your destination may also have a Chinese name which you can show to the driver.\n\nLearning some Cantonese pronunciation for your location will help (especially as some names don't sound in Cantonese like they are written in English). \"Do\" (said like \"Doe\" - a deer, a female deer, with a middle tone) and \"Gai\" (said more like \"Kai\" with a rising tone) are the Cantonese words for Road and Street respectively. If you can pronounce your suburb and local road correctly, this will help considerably.\n\nMobile taxi apps like eTaxi and HKTaxi are becoming widespread in Hong Kong. You always get a fair price, all payments are done by card, there's no need to call anyone, and you can get a taxi at any time in less than 10 minutes.\n\nUber, the global rideshare giant, continues to operate in Hong Kong despite a multi-year legal battle with the government on who is allowed to drive for them. Drivers without the appropriate permits run the risk of fines, but passengers don't.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nRenting a car is almost unheard of in densely populated Hong Kong. With heavy traffic, a complex road network, rare and expensive parking spaces, and well-connected public transportation, renting a car is very unappealing, and can be as expensive as over $600/day even for a small car. That said, there are parts of the New Territories, Lantau Island and southern Hong Kong Island that are poorly, or in some cases not at all served by public transport. Therefore, renting a car should not be ruled out if you intend to spend a significant amount of time hiking and camping in the countryside, particularly if you are staying in a suburban hotel. As a visitor to Hong Kong, you cannot drive to southern Lantau Island south of Shek Mun Kap (石門甲), eastern Sai Kung beyond Northeast of Pak Tam Chung (北潭涌) and some border areas. These boundaries are generally well-marked with warning signs and existing roadblocks.\n\nThe legal age for driving passenger cars in Hong Kong is 18, the same as the mainland. Hong Kong allows most foreigners to drive with an International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to 12 months. Anyone who drives for more than 12 months is required to get a Hong Kong licence issued by the Department of Transport. A license can be issued \"directly\"(without a test), to holders of driving licenses from certain countries.\n\nHong Kong uses traffic rules and signs similar to the United Kingdom (i.e. more or less according to the Vienna convention, although not a signatory). Directional signs are generally bilingual in traditional Chinese and English. The majority of Hongkongers will exceed the speed limit by around 10 km/h which is the tolerated threshold. There are many speed cameras on most major highways. Wearing a seatbelt is mandatory for every passenger who has a seatbelt provided. Many drivers will not signal before changing lanes.\n\nExpressways are not tolled, but most road tunnels, including the 3 cross harbour tunnels, are tolled. The Hong Kong Government is gradually implementing a new ETC system in tunnels named HKeToll. Vehicles must be equipped with a vehicle tag or class tag with sufficient value when driving through tunnels. They are most likely to be dealt by your car rental agency. Vehicles without a tag will be recognized, and driver must pay their toll within 14 days through Faster Payment System, at a 7-11 convenience store or at one of HKeToll's service centre. Failure to pay results in a maximum surcharge up to $525 along with the original tunnel toll.\n\nTraffic in Hong Kong moves on the left (the steering wheel is on the right-hand side), same as the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Thailand and Singapore, but opposite to mainland China.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nIn general, although cycling is possible, Hong Kong is not a bicycle-friendly place because of its hilly landscapes, government policies, air pollution and a general lack of consideration by many motorists. Locals sometimes cycle on the pavements if they are not crowded, although most of time, pavements are too crowded even for pushing your bike. If you plan to use busy urban roads you should be fit enough to keep up with the traffic, which moves surprisingly quickly.\n\nA network of tarmac cycle tracks sprawl across the New Territories making it relatively easy to bike for longer distances. Unlike cycling in urban areas, riding on these tracks is quite enjoyable for the rural views along the way. There are also several mountain-bike trails in the country parks, although a permit is necessary to bring your bicycle into the parks. Visitors should comply with the Road User's Code. Visit this page for maps of major cycle tracks.\n\nBike rental is available in several locations across the territory. Popular rental spots include Cheung Chau, Mui Wo (Lantau), Sha Tin, Tai Po Market, Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan. Rental fees are typically $40–60 a day for a standard entry-level mountain bike, or around $150 per day for a higher-spec mountain or road bike.\n\nBasic rules to follow:\n\nCyclists are prohibited from riding on highways and in tunnels, which are well patrolled.\n\nIt is an offence to be drunk while cycling.\n\nBy law, you're required to have a front and rear light.\n\nElectronic bike conversion systems are not allowed. The police have a strict enforcement policy on this offence.\n\nThe maximum penalty for riding on pedestrian roads is $500 or a three-month jail sentence. Usually offenders get a warning, but the police occasionally have an annual, or bi-annual crackdown.\n\nFor folding bike users, sometimes a bus driver will tell you that it's not allowed, but if you talk to them nicely they will usually let you board. A bicycle bag that makes your bike look like ordinary luggage can make your life a lot easier.\n\nBicycles on public transport\n\n[edit]\n\nFolding bicycles are permitted on all public transport, provided that they are folded.\n\nMTR: Non-folding bicycles are permitted to travel on the MTR system. Travel in the first or last carriage and remove the front wheel.\n\nFerries: Bicycles are permitted on board slow ferries including the Star Ferry, but are not permitted on the Fast Ferries.\n\nTaxis: Most taxi drivers will carry bikes in the boot if the front wheel is removed. Some drivers will carry your bike for free, others will legitimately charge extra for 'excess baggage'.\n\nBy escalator\n\n[edit]\n\nThe world's longest outdoor escalator system travels from Central through Soho to the residential developments of the Mid-levels. The escalator moves down in the morning rush hour but up the rest of the time, and using it is free — in fact, you can even get Octopus credits from machines along the way for being willing to use your feet! The escalator is covered, but still relatively exposed to the elements.\n\nThe escalator cuts through some of the oldest streets found anywhere in Hong Kong, so if you are happy to take a chance and just wander and explore the back streets you are likely to find something of interest that dates back to colonial times.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong doesn't have street benches to sit down. Whilst \"sitting out areas\" are around, these are generally infrequent. Additionally, restaurants (especially cheap and quick ones) will prefer quick table turnover. All this adds up to spending a considerable amount of time on your feet in any given day. Make sure you have a pair of comfortable shoes, as even a good pair of shoes will still leave your feet sore after a full day on your feet.\n\nItineraries\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong Culinary Tour — gives a short tour to discover the unique cuisine of Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong to Kunming overland — covers one route to or from Hong Kong\n\nGuided walks\n\n[edit]\n\nA list of guided tours is available on the website of the Hong Kong Tourism Board.\n\nVictoria Peak\n\n[edit]\n\nGet a stunning view of Hong Kong Island on Victoria Peak atop the giant, wok-shaped Peak Tower! Ever since the dawn of British colonisation, the Peak hosted the most exclusive neighbourhood for the territory's richest residents. Prior to World War II, non-white people weren't permitted to even set foot here (except for the servants of the resident white families). The Peak Tower has an observation platform and a shopping mall with shops, fine dining, and museums. Read more at Hong Kong/Central#Victoria Peak.\n\nHorse racing\n\n[edit]\n\nHorse racing was introduced by the British during the colonial period, and remains serious business in Hong Kong. There are live broadcasts over the radio and many people bet regularly. When people are listening to the races, expect no conversation or business to transpire for the 1-2 minute duration of the race.\n\nWith the exception of a summer break between mid-July and mid-September, horse races take place on Wednesdays and on weekends, at either Sha Tin Racecourse in the New Territories or Happy Valley Racecourse on Eastern Hong Kong Island. Both locations are easily accessible by MTR. Happy Valley is the more convenient, historic, and impressive location, though Sha Tin is larger and hosts more top-level international races.\n\nGet a local to explain the betting system to you. Read Racing Post by the South China Morning Post on race days for a guide to the race. A beer garden is at the finish line of Happy Valley. Bring your passport and get in at the tourist rate of just $1 (compared to $10 for locals).\n\nBetting can also be placed at any of the more than 100 branches of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Expect long lines and big crowds.\n\nTraditional heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many traditional heritage locations throughout Hong Kong.\n\nIn New Territories you will find Ping Shan Heritage Trail passing by some of the most important ancient sights, the walled Hakka village of Tsang Tai Uk, Fu Shin Street Traditional Bazaar as well as a number of temples including Che Kung Temple, Man Mo Temple and the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas. In Kowloon you will find the Kowloon Walled City Park at the location of the former Kowloon walled city, which has the remnants of the city's south gate, and a small open-air museum. And on Lantau you will find the Stilt houses in Tai O, Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tan Buddha Statue.\n\nHong Kong has traditionally been known for Cantonese opera (粵劇), which as the name suggests, originates in Guangdong province. This art form employs colourful props and costumes, with stories usually set in ancient China, and is a display of singing, martial arts, acting and acrobatics. It is, however, moribund these days, with modern audiences being primarily restricted to the elderly. The only surviving theatre still dedicated exclusively to Cantonese opera performances is the Sunbeam Theatre.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a variety of museums in Hong Kong with different themes. Arguably the best museum is the Hong Kong Museum of History in Kowloon, which gives an excellent overview of Hong Kong's fascinating past. Only an abridged version of the museum's permanent exhibit is available while the museum is renovated.\n\nKowloon also has a number of other interesting museums including Dialogue in the Dark, which is an exhibition in complete darkness where you should use your non-visual senses with the help of a visually impaired guide, Hong Kong Museum of Art, which is a fascinating, strange and elusive place exhibiting Chinese ceramics, terracotta, rhinoceros horn and Chinese paintings as well as contemporary art produced by Hong Kong artists, Hong Kong Science Museum, primarily aimed at children, and Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre.\n\nCentral also has its share of museums including Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum, Hong Kong Maritime Museum, Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences, which shows how the healthcare system evolved from traditional Chinese medicine to modern Western medicine, and Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. There is also a 3D museum from Korea called Trick Eye Museum Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Palace Museum in West Kowloon is a branch of the Palace Museum in Beijing's Forbidden City, and largely dedicated to displaying artifacts from the Forbidden City's collection.\n\nNature\n\n[edit]\n\nContrary to popular belief, Hong Kong is not all skyscrapers and it is worthwhile to go to the countryside (over 70% of Hong Kong), including the country parks and marine parks. Many are surprised to find that Hong Kong is actually home to some stunning landscapes and breathtaking scenery.\n\nLantau Island is twice as big as Hong Kong island and is well worth checking out if you want to get away from the bright lights and pollution of the city for a spell. Here you will find open countryside, traditional fishing villages, secluded beaches, monasteries and more. You can hike, camp, fish and mountain bike, among other activities.\n\nIn the waters just off Tung Chung on Lantau Island, live the Chinese White Dolphin These dolphins are naturally pink and live in the wild, but their status is threatened, with the population estimated to be between 100–200.\n\nThe Sai Kung Peninsula in New Territories is also a worthwhile place to visit. Its mountainous terrain and spectacular coastal scenery make this a special place. There are both challenging and more relaxed routes.\n\nHong Kong Wetland Park in New Territories is a relaxing park set amidst an ecological mitigation area. One can stroll along a network of board walks or explore the large visitors centre/museum.\n\nNorth East New Territories is also famous for its natural environment. Yan Chau Tong Marine Park is in the North East New Territories. A few traditional abandoned villages are connected with hiking trails in the territory. North East New Territories is a famous hiking hot spot for the locals.\n\nShort hiking trails (2 hours) can be found on Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. You can even hike up to the Victoria Peak.\n\nSome outlying islands are worth visiting, e.g., Lamma Island, Cheung Chau, Ping Chau, Tap Mun, Tung Lung Island.\n\nTheme parks\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong Disneyland Resort on Lantau Island features a Disneyland park, three resort hotels and a lake recreation centre. It offers some great attractions and short queues most of the year.\n\nOcean Park is on the southern side of Hong Kong island, and is the park that grew up with many local Hong Kong people. With roller coasters and large aquariums altogether, it is still packed on weekends with families and tourists. The cablecar is an icon. For many, the chance to see Hong Kong's pandas would be a deciding factor.\n\nNgong Ping 360 on Lantau Island is a Buddhist-themed park that features Imperial Chinese architecture, interactive shows, demonstrations, restaurants and coffee shops. The highlight of this trip is the longest cable car ride in Hong Kong that affords stunning views. The ride also takes you to the largest outdoor seated Buddha.\n\nSeeing Hong Kong by public transport\n\n[edit]\n\nTravelling on a bus or a tram is ideal for looking at different sides of Hong Kong. Not only is it cheap, it allows you to see completely different lifestyles in different districts in a short time. Below are some recommended routes.\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nCitybus Route 15 starts from Central (Exchange Square) to The Peak. It is an alternative way for getting to The Peak by bus rather than by Peak Tram. Your journey to Hong Kong will not be complete unless you have visited Victoria Peak. You can see the beautiful view of Hong Kong Island, Victoria Harbour and Kowloon Peninsula along the Stubbs Road during the journey. When you arrive, there are two shopping malls: The Peak Tower and The Peak Galleria, which provide restaurants, a supermarket, and souvenir shops for your convenience. In addition, you can visit Madame Tussauds Hong Kong and see if the mannequins look to be the real deal. Direction: you can take MTR and get off at Hong Kong station. You can approach Hong Kong station by the underpass from Central station. After that, follow the exit B1 to Exchange Square and you will see the bus terminus. You can also get off at Admiralty station. Then, follow the C1 exit towards Queensway Plaza. Make a right after you exit the station, and you will see the bus stop. After you get on the bus, just stay on until it arrives to The Peak bus terminus. The bus fare is $9.8 and it takes about 30 minutes for the journey.\n\nCitybus Route 973 starts from Tsim Sha Tsui East Bus Terminus at the Concordia Plaza, which is directly opposite the Science Museum at Science Museum Road. It goes along Salisbury Road, where the Avenue of Stars, The Space Museum and the Art Museum are. Later it goes to University of Hong Kong, which is the most prominent and the oldest university in Hong Kong after crossing the Western Harbour Crossing. It later passes through the countryside of the southern part of Hong Kong. It will reach the Hong Kong southern side in Aberdeen. Not long after, the bus passes by a football field, from which it is a 5–10 minutes walk to Ocean Park. Finally, the bus passes by the beautiful sandy beach of Repulse Bay, before it finally arrives at its terminus station at Stanley Village, where the famous Murray House and the Stanley Village Market are. The fare is $13.6 and it takes about 95 minutes for the journey.\n\nCitybus Route H1, H2 are two rickshaw-themed double-deckers going to main heritage spots on Hong Kong Island, such as the Court of Final Appeal (previously LegCo) in Central and the University of Hong Kong. A day pass costs $50, and you can hop on and hop off at any stop.\n\nTram\n\n[edit]\n\nTake a tram journey on Hong Kong Island.\n\nThe tram system refers to is Hong Kong Tramways, a slow yet special form of transport running on Hong Kong Island. It has been operating since 1904 and is an obvious relic of the British administration. A trip on a tram is a perfect way to have a leisurely tour around Hong Kong Island's major streets and to have a glimpse of the local life. Fares are relatively cheap, just $2.60 per trip for an adult and $1.20 for senior citizens (aged 65 or older) and children pay $1.30.\n\nThe low price makes it attractive to domestic helpers on their Sunday off, and it can be so crowded that it is very difficult to squeeze on or off. A relaxing tram journey would be better for a weekday. The tram is not air conditioned, while the open windows offer a nice breeze.\n\nStarting from the old district Kennedy Town, you can see the residential areas, followed by the Chinese herbal medicine and dried seafood wholesalers in Sai Ying Pun - Sheung Wan. Then the tram goes in the famous Central district with high rise commercial buildings and banks. Wan Chai and Causeway Bay are the districts popular with shoppers and are always crowded with people at all times. Travelling further east are North Point and Shau Kei Wan areas, which are of completely different styles from that in Central and Causeway Bay.\n\nIt is recommended to ride from as far as Kennedy Town in the west, to as far as Shau Kei Wan in the east, in order to get a strong contrast of \"East meets West\" and \"Old meets New\". Moreover, trams terminating at North Point will pass a wet market at Chun Yeung Street before reaching the terminus, creating a unique scene for both passengers on trams and shoppers on the street.\n\nThe Light Rail, a modern tram system, operates in the northwest New Territories and serves New Towns between Yuen Long and Tuen Mun. Few tourists will be inspired by these trams but they may appeal to enthusiasts, and are useful for getting to the famous Chinese bakeries in Yuen Long.\n\nAvenue of Stars and A Symphony of Lights\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong's version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Grauman's Chinese Theatre combined into one, the Avenue of Stars celebrates icons of Hong Kong cinema from the past century. The seaside promenade in Kowloon offers fantastic views, day and night, of Victoria Harbour and the skyline. This is also a great place to see A Symphony of Lights, a light and laser show synchronised to music and staged every night at 8PM.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nPop culture\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong was one of the main centres of Chinese pop culture from the communist revolution in 1949 until the 2010s, having given rise to many famous singers and actors. Hong Kong action cinema is legendary among Chinese people across the world. The city also played a key role in popularizing the genre of Cantopop, and some Cantopop songs have achieved cult status across the Chinese-speaking world, even among people who do not speak Cantonese. Television dramas by local station TVB also enjoyed loyal following among ethnic Chinese across the world.\n\nSince the 2010s, most of Hong Kong's top singers and actors have relocated to mainland China where they can make a lot more money. Nevertheless, the city continues to produce notable films on a regular basis, and Cantopop has experienced a revival of sorts in the 2020s, led by a new generation of local talent.\n\nMusic festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nClockenflap is Hong Kong's largest music festival, and includes popular artists, mainly from Europe and the US. It takes place in November on the Central Harbourfront Event Space.\n\nIndie events\n\n[edit]\n\nCantopop is by far the most popular genre in Hong Kong and receives an immense amount of support from the media. Independent musicians and are often harassed and evicted from their rehearsal rooms and concert venues by the government because they are forced to illegally rent warehouse spaces due to unaffordable rents. A few small venues are open for indie shows, such as Hidden Agenda and The Wanch.\n\nBeaches\n\n[edit]\n\nYou are never far from the sea in Hong Kong and going to a good beach is only a bus-ride away. However, if you want a really good beach, then it is worth making the effort to travel, possibly on foot, and seek out the beaches of the New Territories. With more than 200 outlying islands, as well as an extensive coastline that is jam-packed with impressive bays and beaches, you will surely come across some good looking beaches to while the whole day away. Hong Kong's urban beaches are usually well maintained and have services such as showers and changing rooms. Where beaches are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, shark nets and life guards are present. Dogs and smoking are not permitted on these beaches.\n\nThe best beaches to use include:\n\nRepulse Bay is a large urban beach on the south side of Hong Kong island that features a colourful Chinese temple. Money has been spent on its facilities and will appeal to those who have young children.\n\nMiddle Bay is popular with gay people and is a 20-minute walk from the crowds at Repulse Bay. Middle Bay has lifeguards, showers, changing rooms, shark nets and a decent cafe serving drinks and snacks.\n\nShek O is a beach popular with many young locals. It is away from the bustle of the city but is well served by restaurants and has a good bus service from the north side of the island. The Thai restaurant close to the beach is worth a try.\n\nBig Wave Bay is smaller than other beaches on Hong Kong Island, but has good services which include a number of small cafes close to the beach. Big Wave Bay has the sort of waves that appeal to surfers. From here it is possible to take the coastal footpath to Chai Wan where you can find the MTR and buses. The walk to Chai Wan is about one hour, or more if you are not used to the steep climb up the mountain.\n\nHung Shing Yeh Beach on Lamma Island is the most popular beach. This beach is Grade 1 and shows off powdery, fine sand and clear water. This beach has changing facilities, a barbecue area, and a refreshment kiosk. Take the ferryboat from Central Pier to Yung Shue Wan; expect to walk around 20 minutes from the ferry terminal to the beach (buses and taxis are not an option on Lamma).\n\nSwimming pools\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to pools in many hotels, there are several public swimming pools scattered across the territory. Entrance costs $19 on weekends/$17 on weekdays for adults and $9 on weekends/$8 on weekdays for children, usually only payable by Octopus Card or by coins. Swimming pools are child-friendly with shallow pools and fountains. All swimming pool complexes are well maintained and offer swimming lanes, hot showers, lockers ($5 coin deposit or your own lock required), both family and same-sex changing rooms (limited privacy), and most have swimming clubs for serious swimmers. Swimmers are expected to provide their own towels and toiletries. The Kowloon Park Swimming Pool Complex in Tsim Sha Tsui is centrally located and offers visitors a wide range of services and includes an indoor Olympic-sized pool.\n\nMost pools open at 6:30AM and close at 10PM. They generally close for lunch noon-1PM and then again from 5-6PM.\n\nSailing\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can rent a Junk Boat for a sailing trip. A typical junk boat can accommodate more than 30 people and can be rented for the day to take you on a tour of your choice. Sai Kung is a popular spot for the trip to start and you can sail to nearby beaches for a more secluded time. A cheaper alternative is to hire a much smaller water taxi (水道) to take you to where you want to go.\n\nThere are a few boats that operate \"sunset cruises\" on the harbour.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sports landscape in Hong Kong generally reflects its legacy of British colonial rule. Hong Kong sends its own team to international sports competitions, separate from the Chinese team. Hong Kong also sends a team to China's National Games. It will host the fencing, track cycling, golf, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, triathlon, tenpin bowling, men's handball and men's U22 basketball events for the 2025 National Games, to be held on 9-21 November.\n\nThe most popular sport in Hong Kong is football (soccer), and while the local league and national team are not of a high standard, it has the highest participation rate among all team sports in Hong Kong. The main home stadium of the Hong Kong national team is the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, but some home games may be played at the Mong Kok Stadium instead.\n\nRugby union is also popular, with the territory hosting the Hong Kong Sevens, the world's most prestigious rugby sevens tournament, every year at Hong Kong Stadium. Hong Kong also has a respectable rugby union national team, which is the second strongest in Asia after Japan.\n\nCricket is most popular among the South Asian and Eurasian (European and Asian mixed-race) communities, and membership in the Hong Kong Cricket Club or Kowloon Cricket Club is somewhat of a status symbol for Hongkongers. Due to Hong Kong's mild climate, cricket is generally played in the winter months (Sept-April). Hong Kong is a third-tier ICC team, occasionally entering qualifying rounds for major tournaments but not routinely facing the stronger nations. The Hong Kong national cricket team plays at Tin Kwong Road (formerly Mission Road) in Kowloon.\n\nThe Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course, on the eponymous island, is Hong Kong's only public golf course.\n\nHiking and camping\n\n[edit]\n\nHiking is the best kept secret in Hong Kong, it is a great way to appreciate Hong Kong's beautiful landscapes that include mountains, beaches and breathtaking cityscapes. The starting points for many hiking trails are accessible by bus or taxi.\n\nHiking in Hong Kong can be strenuous because of the steep trails, and during the summer months, mosquitos and the hot, humid, weather combine to make even the easiest trek a workout. Wear suitable clothes, and bring plenty of water and mosquito repellent. It is fairly unlikely that you will have a close encounter with venomous snakes, although they are present in most rural areas. Most local people choose the winter months to undertake the more demanding hiking trails. If you are not especially fit you might plan your route so that you take a bus or taxi to the highest point of the trail and then walk downhill.\n\nCampsites in Hong Kong are plentiful and free of charge. Most are in country parks and range from basic sites serviced with only with a pit toilet, to those that provide campers with modern toilet blocks and cold showers. Some sites have running water and sinks for washing dishes. A few campsites have places to buy drinking water and food. Whilst many are serenely remote, weekends and public holidays are predictably busy, especially in the more accessible places close to roads. Hongkongers who camp like to do so in large groups, talk loudly, and stay awake late into the night. If you are noise sensitive try to find a remote campsite or pack some good earplugs.\n\nThere are four major trails in Hong Kong:\n\nLantau Trail on"
