        "meta_description": "(March 19, 2012) Leonard Susskind concludes the course by wrapping up the major concepts that were covered throughout the quarter and discussing some of the limits of the field of quantum physics. In this course world renowned physicist, Leonard Susskind, dives into the fundamentals of classical mechanics and quantum physics. He discovers the link between the two branches of physics and ultimately shows how quantum mechanics grew out of the classical structure.",
