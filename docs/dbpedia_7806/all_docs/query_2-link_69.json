        "text": "I am a huge advocate of adult learning, and I like to keep myself abreast with different things I find interesting. Science has been a key part of that. A while back I came across The Theoretical Minimum, which is a series of courses taught by Professor Leonard Susskind at Stanford. Lenny is a great science communicator and educator. His ability to break down difficult concepts into easy-to-understand things is something I appreciate and aspire to develop in me.\n\nA good example of this is his course on Quantum Mechanics (QM). It is very different from what you see in undergraduate studies — there is no mention of the Hydrogen atom at all, for instance. He uses the idea of a single spin and a measurement device to illustrate how quantum mechanics is fundamentally different from classical mechanics.\n\nThe Anatomy of a Single-Spin Experiment\n\nThe experimental setup he describes involves a single spin which can be in either an “up” or a “down” state. We also have a detector — a measuring device that gives a measurement of “+1” if it detected the spin in the up state, or “-1” if it detected the spin in the down state.\n\nIn the simplest scenario, we start with the spin in the up state and we do a measurement. In this case, we will always get a measurement of +1. Similarly, if we start with the spin in the down state, we will always get a measurement of -1.\n\nWe can extend the experiment by allowing both the spin and the detector to be in different directions in space (as opposed to being only up and down), while still only having two states for simplicity (up and down for the spin, +1 and -1 for the detector). The simplest scenario of this extension is when the detector is pointed in the opposite direction to the direction of spin. In this case, we will get a measurement of -1 every time. In this sense, what the detector is measuring is whether the spin is along the direction of measurement (+1) or opposite to the direction of measurement (-1).\n\nBoth the above scenarios produce deterministic results — no matter how many times you repeat the experiment — assuming you always start with the spin in the up state (or any fixed state)— you will always get the same measurement. Things become interesting when you point the detector at an angle to the spin vector. The detector cannot measure the angle, it can only produce a +1 or a -1. When you run this experiment multiple times — again, assuming you always start with the spin in the up state— you will find that you get a +1 sometimes and a -1 at other times. Once you do a measurement though, you will find that the spin vector is now parallel to the detector — along the measurement direction if you measured +1, and opposite to the direction if you measured a -1. So any subsequent measurements you do will always give the same answer. If you reset your experimental setup and start again with the spin in the up state, you will find a random answer again.\n\nIf this setup feels contrived to you, that’s because it is. It is a simple analogy meant to emulate quantum mechanics for a single particle with two states. The spin aligning parallel to the detector after measurement is equivalent to the collapse of the wave function that you may have come across before. To be able to come up with a simple analogy to explain this complex concept is why I have a huge respect for Lenny as a science communicator.\n\nIf you can visualize it, you can truly understand it\n\nWhile the experiment itself is quite simple, and he does a good job of explaining things by drawing on the board, I still found myself struggling to visualize things. In addition, I remember him mentioning at one point during the course how it would be nice if someone had the time to create a computer program for this. I looked around and found none, that motivated me to create a set of visualizations to explain the experiment. Which is what this blog post is about.\n\nBelow I show visualizations for three different versions of the experiment. They should load as interactive widgets on your browser, but if they don’t then please visit the URL given in the corresponding caption to load the visualization in a new webpage. Please note that these are designed to be viewed on a desktop. I am not a UI expert and didn’t have the time to make things mobile-friendly. Also, although these visualizations are reasonably tested, they may still have bugs. If you have the time to improve these, please file an issue or submit a pull request to this repository on GitHub.\n\nExperiment #1\n\nIn each of the three experiments, we start with the spin in the up state, more specifically along the +Z direction in a cartesian coordinate system. The first experiment allows you to orient the detector in any direction and do a measurement. For simplicity, both the spin and the measurement vectors are assumed to be unit vectors. I find that an intuitive way to specify a direction in 3 dimensions is to provide two angles — for instance, one from X-axis towards Y-axis and another from Y-axis towards Z-axis. The interface allows you to specify these two angles in degrees. To set a measurement direction, use the “Set Direction” button. The “Reset Direction” button allows you to set the measurement direction to its default value, which is along the +X axis in this case. When you perform a measurement using the “Do Measurement” button, you will get a +1 or a -1 result, and the spin will be respectively aligned along or opposite to the measurement direction. The “Reset Measurement” allows you to set the spin direction back to along the +Z axis."
