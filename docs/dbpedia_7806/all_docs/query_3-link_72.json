        "text": "This is a model personal statement of a successful Oxbridge Physics applicant.\n\nAged six, I attended a general science exhibition at the Science Museum, where the concept of kinetic energy was introduced, and my interest in Physics was sparked. While studying for my GCSEs, I found that Physics and Mathematics inspired me, so I chose both as my Higher Level IB subjects. Over the last year, I have concluded that I want to study Physics as I have a strong curiosity to understand the workings and origins of our universe.\n\nAt the end of last year, I won the Maths Merit Prize for my year group. I see myself entering a research role in the future, potentially working towards a PhD in a theoretical field. Having read \"Seven Brief Lessons on Physics\", an introduction to key concepts in modern Physics which aided my decision on Physics instead of Engineering, \"Relativity\" by Albert Einstein, and \"Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction\", I have become more interested in theoretical physics and enjoy the mathematical aspect (having encountered some in \"Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics\"). It has been particularly interesting to learn about methods used to discover new particles, through recreating conditions following the Big Bang in accelerators.\n\nHowever, Classical Physics also interests me, having read \"Classical Mechanics\" (Leonard Susskind) and read/watched some of Richard Feynman's lectures. I also participate in both Physics Forum and Engineering Society weekly, as well as Maths Extension classes. During the summer, I took part in a course on Modern Physics and an internship. The course visited a number of new topics, and areas I had read about but not fully grasped. We explored the Maths of oscillations and vibrations, providing a toolkit to explore areas ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Relativity (supplementing Einstein's work, and looking more deeply at General Relativity), to the Standard Model (aiding my wider reading) and String Theory. Our exploration included using the Schwarzschild Metricto learn about Blackholes, deriving Minkowski's Metric and the Uncertainty Principle.\n\nI was also lucky enough to attain an internship at McLaren Automotive this summer, working in the Engineering department, where I met various applied physical concepts, such as how vortices are used to maximise performance in Formula 1, and how torques affect the working of a four-stroke engine. I was also exposed to various software, including CAD.I have written my Maths Extended Essay (EE), modelling the motion of a cylinder missing a section of its body and seeing the effect on its motion of this change, which expanded my knowledge on moments of inertia, differential equations and mathematical methods, learning Latex in the process.\n\nDuring year 12, I participated in the CERN Physics essay competition with an essay about Baryon Asymmetry in our universe. Despite no prize, in October I will visit CERN, and I am particularly excited to see the Antiproton Decelerator. In autumn, as part of a school science fair I will demonstrate Lenz's Law, then explain the phenomena.I will continue Mandarin studies; I have been fascinated by the culture since I started learning in 2016, and last year I placed third in the Intermediate Plus category of the British Mandarin Speaking Competition.\n\nAside from academics, my hobbies are varied; my passion is powerlifting, and I will compete in the South East Regional with a six-times-bodyweight total (sum of weight lifted for one repetition on squat, deadlift and bench press). I also work in a local pizzeria as a waiter, enjoying the social aspect as well as the teamwork, which is supplementary to my role as a sergeant in the Combined Cadet Force, where I run a section of seven. On a more creative side, I am an Honorary Art Scholar, and enjoy singing. The combination of skills such as persistence and hard work, team working and leadership, creativity and imagination are all things I want to continue to cultivate and will be useful for working in a research environment."
