        "text": "While spending most of my time procrastinating on why I should be revising for my physics exam in two days, I thought why not write a short blog on a physicist which has inspired me to go deeper into the field of physics, so without further ado here are the reasons why Leonard Susskind is in my opinion the genius of our generation for modern physics.\n\nLeonard Susskind is an American physicist who has made huge contributions to theories such as string theory, quantum field theory and quantum cosmology. He, along with Yoichiro Nambu and Holger Bech Nielsen are seen as the fathers of string theory, and Leonard Susskind independently introduced the concept that particles could be states of excitation of a relativistic string. He also introduced the idea of string theory landscape which refers to the large number of possible false vacua in string theory.\n\nLeonard Susskind, and Juan Maldacena also introduced a new idea in the field of quantum gravity called ER = EPR, which proposed the idea that an Einstein-Rosen bridge is the same as quantum entangled black holes. This proposal was introduced to try and resolve the AMPS firewall paradox. This made a large contribution in trying to relate quantum gravity with black holes.\n\nLeonard Susskind was awarded the 1998 J. J. Sakurai Price for his contributions to Quantum Chromodynamics, Lattice Gauge Theory and Dynamical Symmetry Breaking. He was seen to have applied brilliant imagination and originality to the theoretical study in the nature of elementary particles and forces that make up our physical world.\n\nLeonard Susskind also published some popular science books on his war with Steven Hawking which is called The Black Hole War in which he tries to explain what would happen to information and matter if it was stored in a black hole when it evaporates. Steven Hawking stated that if information is stored in a black hole, it will be lost forever as the black hole evaporates. Leonard Susskind disagreed with this and spent 28 years to formulate a theory in which he could prove Hawking wrong. He is also working on a new series of books called The Theoretical Minimum in which he attempts to explain what you will need to know to start doing physics, and he explores the quantum world by include theories such as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Princple and the Schrödinger Equation. The next book to be expected in the series is going to focus on Special Relativity.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why I think Leonard Susskind is great, I will stop myself from writing anymore as I really need to do some study for my physics exam.\n\nThanks for the read, I will likely be doing more blogs on inspirational people."
