        "text": "This second paper focuses on the claim that the United States Constitution of 1789 seems to be modeled on Isaac Newton's mechanistic cosmology of 1687, and that it should be updated to account for the sweeping evolution of physics and psychology over the past three-and-third-centuries. This whole series of papers explains why and how we need to update the Constitution to unite the Right and Left, in order to achieve for our nation what Carl Jung called individuation: the ultimate state of psychic wholeness through the union of opposites. After describing the telling parallels between Leonard Susskind's holographic string theory and Jung's archetypal psychology, including his near-death experience, the Introduction ended with two proposals: add an amendment to serve as a Preface to the Preamble explaining why We the People now identify each individual self with the central singularity and surrounding horizon of the cosmos; add a fourth branch of government tasked with helping the other three branches harmonize their decisions with this central organizing principle, Psyche = Singularity, specifically by guiding them through the process of imagining ways to help future generations realize this individuating equation ever more perfectly. In this paper, after an examination of the parallels between the political laws of the Constitution and Newton's mechanistic laws of physics-which will include a look at President Woodrow Wilson's comments on the topic-I will briefly describe the evolution of physics after Newton: from the discovery of the electromagnetic force (mid-1860s), and the absolute speed of light (1887), to special relativity (1905), general relativity (1915), quantum mechanics (1927), and, finally, holographic string theory (early 1990s). I will then analyze Federalist Paper No. 10, and explain how the synthesis of Susskind and Jung provides a way to control the cause of faction, by demonstrating that each of us is one with the same archetypal Self.\n\nLike the Federalist Papers that urged New York to ratify our Constitution, this is the first in a series of papers aimed at individuating it. According to the psychologist Carl Jung, “individuation” is the ultimate state of psychic wholeness through the union of opposites. He furthermore worked with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli to develop a theory according to which the laws of physics and psychology mirror each other because mind and matter both emerge from the same archetypes of the collective unconscious, all of which radiate from the ultimate archetype of wholeness through the union of opposites, the Unus Mundus, or Self. I argue that the psychic mandala images that emerge from the Unus Mundus to compensate an ego that is pulled by opposing demands are mirrored in the material world by black holes (including the inside-out black hole universe). I also argue that the succinct parallels between Jung’s psychology (especially his near-death experience of the cosmic horizon) and Leonard Susskind’s holographic string theory indicate that each psyche is rooted in the central singularity and holographic horizon of the cosmos. With that foundation in place I ask: What is the fewest number of updates we can give our Constitution in order to least disruptively achieve its primary goal of forming a more perfect Union? First, add an Amendment to serve as a Preface to the Preamble explaining why We the People now identify each individual self with the central singularity and surrounding horizon of the cosmos. Second, add a fourth branch of government dedicated to helping the other three branches harmonize their decision-making processes with this central organizing principle, Psyche = Singularity, specifically by creating alternative futures scenarios aimed at enabling our Posterity to assimilate it ever more perfectly.\n\nThe existence of consciousness in the universe as a consequent dimension of reality and a force able to shape material reality has to be integrated in cosmological physics theories whose stated aim is to describe the whole universe. General Systems Theory is a substantial global systemic framework that, blended with hyperdimensional physics, can ground such modeling. It is a fact that only by positing hyperdimensions can actual physics succeeds in reaching a near-unification of the four forces by blending the frameworks of Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics (such as in Witten’s 11-dimensional M-Theory). This paper argues that the only way to integrate the dimension of consciousness in a theory of the universe is by modeling a complex hyperdimension of consciousness (or ‘syg hyperdimension’) consisting in complex semantic fields (operating at all levels, from the cosmic to the biosystems levels), and entwined with a hyperspace and hypertime. The well substantiated ‘nonlocal’ dynamics of consciousness, experimentally evidenced, show mind processes constantly violating Newtonian-Einsteinian space and time constraints, and following instead complex systems dynamics based on connectivity and meaning. The Infinite Spiral Staircase theory (ISST) postulates that this triune hyperdimension operates at a sub-quantum scale, at the origin of the universe before the very Planck scale that allows the existence of particles (matter), as well as space and time. It is a Kaluza-Klein compact 5th dimension with a bulk pervading and encompassing our universe; the virtual particles of tachyonic speed populating it, the sygons, instantiate the very meaning-driven dynamics of our minds and allow for instant connectivity at a distance and two-way influences between semantic fields or minds and bio- and matter- systems.\n\nThe Infinite-Spiral-Staircase Theory (ISST) posits a hyperdimension of consciousness populated by faster-than-light, high-energy, sub-Planckian sygons pervading the pluriverse. This HD is in fact triune, a braid of hyperspace (Center, C), hypertime (Rhythm, R) and consciousness (Syg, S), topologically organized as a double phi-based golden spiral set on a double BlackHole-WhiteHole Kerr system. Within the Terminal Black Hole of a parent universe, all matter-systems are translated into pure CSR information or syg-fields steered by the sub-quantum sygons; and through the White Hole at the origin, these syg-fields are translated back from virtual sygons into post-Planck particles and matter systems, still retaining the sygons as a 5 th dimension at their core. ISST builds on the Semantic Fields Theory (SFT) in modeling a semantic layer of organization in all systems—their syg-fields (semantic fields) ranging from proto-consciousness to self-consciousness. As human beings, our mind or consciousness is our global syg-field, organized in dynamical networks and steered by syg-energy—the sygons (Hardy 1998, 2001, 2003). The ensemble of all syg-fields form the cosmic CSR hyperdimension of consciousness, as a gigantic hologram, self-conscious and evolving. Positing a consciousness-HD layer in the universe leads to envision a new paradigmatic stand in philosophy as well as in physics. The syg-HD operates clearly beyond-spacetime and is a beyond-matter layer (thus in accord with dualism); yet, given that consciousness-as-process is steered by the sub-quantum sygon particles, the syg-HD is definitely a blend of energy and mind (as in monism/materialism). Thus ISST reframes the mind-body split in a complex dynamical network systems' framework, as a consciousness HD existing at a sub-quantum scale in all matter systems (thus setting a type of panpsychism), and also as a bulk in its own CSR-HD region. At the scale of the pluriverse, the spacetime regions of specific universe-bubbles are constantly birthed and then die. The HD preexists and survives to these matter regions in the BH-WH double spiral, and pervades them during the life of a universe. In a consciousness-HD (syg-HD) framework, consciousness and our mind—the syg-field— operate mostly via the HD, and only a small part of our syg-field is branching into the brain's neuronal networks. It is because the Self and the mind belong to the syg-HD that they instantiate psi capacities, high meditation states, and some independence from spacetime. In this framework, death is just the severing of links to the brain-body and the Self, at death, becomes fully independent from the body and enjoy (in the HD layer) the same intelligent, creative, and individualized capacities as when embodied, yet with greater psi capacities.\n\nABSTRACT Published 2019 with Atropos Press and Edited in 2021 The upload is a sample, and the full dissertation can be purchased from Barnes and Noble, Amazon, or other vendors online. Golden Lab Bookstore in Queens, New York carries this book. Cosmophenomenology, a term coined by Danish religious philosopher K.E. Løgstrup, is used to describe an approach that extends the traditional phenomenology of Edmund Husserl to include an interrelation between human beings and reality as a whole (nature or Greek Physis) from the standpoint of the universe, rather than simply human-to-human inter-relation. As such, it extends beyond anthropocentric and speciesist views of consciousness. My thesis hinges upon the primordial form of consciousness as quantum energy which has a continuation of existence after a person’s bodily or physical death. The First Thermodynamic Law states that energy neither goes out of being nor comes into being. Consciousness is not dependent on the existence of matter, space, or time, although it interacts with these variables. As a fundamental force, dark energy would retain its form regardless of space or time. I compare the continuation of consciousness after death in the Orch-OR theory of Sir Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff with that of the monadology in Leibniz. Both theories concern the inscribing of consciousness as quantum information into small structures called microtubules/monads, which allows this information to pass on into different realms after death. In an infinitely expanding universe not confined by space or time, there would potentially be an infinity of such multiple universes and their included dimensions. I have preceded the discussion of these theories with an explanation of quantum mechanics and the interaction between the dark energy of consciousness and matter in the universe. My thesis is primarily about metaphysics: the ontology of consciousness. I theorize that consciousness, otherwise known as the soul, is an uncategorized form of quantum energy and life force that is polymorphous, expressible as biophotons as well as waves. The wave is the form consciousness takes up as dark energy or Brahman, while biophotons are atman, the form consciousness takes on in neurons. Dark energy is surmised by physicists to be Einstein’s cosmological constant because it shapes the relativity of spacetime, dictating the behavior of atoms and light photons and also existing in a void. The mistake of materialists is to equate the 4% of the universe that dark energy literally moves about, to the force itself which constitutes over 70% of the universe. Dark energy and ordinary matter are highly different in constitution, but curiously interact psycho-kinetically. Dark energy is responsible for the very expansion of space between galaxies and smaller objects like brain neurons. In place of classical physics which cannot be used to study quantum energy, I use the approach of cosmophenomenology (cosmological physics and phenomenology) to study the ontology of consciousness.\n\nFive types of processes display a 'beyond spacetime' property—or nonlocality as evidenced in the quantum entanglement—, including psi, proven to operate beyond-brain and beyond-spacetime. Together, these five anomalies are not only at odds with Relativity but also with the indeterminacy of Quantum Mechanics. However, in the same way as the four forces can only be unified via a hyperdimension, a hyperdimension that includes a cosmic consciousness (together with hyperspace and hypertime) may give a cogent foundation for all five nonlocal anomalies. The Infinite-Spiral-Staircase Theory (ISST) posits such triune hyperdimension (HD) as all-encompassing in the universe, pre-existing to and pervading the spacetime region because it dwells at a sub-Planckian scale—both at the origin and at any spacetime coordinates in all systems. ISST accommodates the double-nature of consciousness, mostly nonlocal and operating through the hyperdimension, and partly embodied. The HD of a system is its dynamical meaningful organizational layer, its semantic field (syg-field), more or less evolved, from a proto-consciousness to a mind. The framework of ISST is panpsychist—with the hyperdimensional sygons (syg energy) pervading any atom, cell, biosystem and mind—, and is thus based on a deep, multilevel and distributed, mind-matter coupling. The sygons, pure semantic (syg) energy, create instant nonlocal connections between resonant semantic fields, thus explaining telepathy and psi at large. All semantic interconnections imply an inter-influence between syg-fields, the control variable of influence being the intensity of syg energy. Once the syg-field of a system has been reorganized, the change takes place within the matter-or bio-system.\n\nFive types of processes display a 'beyond spacetime' property—or nonlocality as evidenced in the quantum entanglement—, including psi, proven to operate beyond-brain and beyond-spacetime.
