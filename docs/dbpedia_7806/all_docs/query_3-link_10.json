        "text": "Hey guys just wanted some advice. I am an aspiring physicist. My main topics of interest are Particle Physics, Cosmology and Black Hole Physics. I have been planning to listen and study these lectures by prof and great physicist Leonard Susskind.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind#Lectures\n\nSo right now my exams are over and college will start in october. So i got 6 free months with me. So i thought i will start with them. So i have 2 questions :\n\n1. Should i do the old core sequence or the repeated and new one? I am thinking of the new one as it will also probably have the new developments of all these years. I don't think doing both will be right.\n\n2. I am starting with quantum mechanis. I really don't like classical and quantum mechanics both. But i need to get a grip on quantum mechanics to understand the rest of lectures on particle physics string theory and cosmology. So i am leaving it out classical mechanics. Am i making a mistake? Or can i leave out quantum also. Will i need quantum to understand the rest of the lectures?\n\nPlease don't use the lectures as your primary source of information. You will regret this and you will have very shaky fundamentals.\n\nI highly suggest you to get a good book and to study from it. This will be way better than simply to watch some internet lectures. And be sure to do a lot of exercises!\n\nAnd please do not leave out classical mechanics. To get a good understanding if quantum physics, you need to know quite some classical mechanics. Leaving it out is a very bad idea.\n\nmicromass said:\n\nPlease don't use the lectures as your primary source of information.

Leaving it out is a very bad idea.\n\nYes i understand. But i am going to attend college this year for the same. I will be joining Lancaster University this year for the course Physics with Particle Physics and Cosmology.\n\nSo i'll do the excercises and books at that time. They will make me do it. Right now i was just looking to you know get a deeper insight into the subjects and also cauz i love to study this.\n\nShailank said:\n\nHey guys the overview of the courses say that he will give lectures on black holes also. But i couldn't find those lectures. Can anyone help?\n\nI would would offer one caveat and suggest that you don't view Susskind's lectures as a didactic tool. They are best viewed, IMO, as entertainment and somewhat of a review if you are already familiar with the material. I went into these lectures last year with the same enthusiasm you have now, as I mentioned in another thread recently. In fact, that thread is right next to yours in this section!\n\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=688247\n\nI would recommend reading that thread before thinking your going to do some one stop shopping at Lenny's supermarket. That's not to put down Lenny, I'd watch all his stuff regardless, its great. I just wish these guys, not just Lenny but most of them, would be more realistic with what background you need in order to understand their lectures. Lenny states at various introductory lectures that you should be able to follow the class just fine knowing some basic algebra and calculus. Not so.\n\nDiracPool said:\n\nI would would offer one caveat and suggest that you don't view Susskind's lectures as a didactic tool.

So my maths is still fresh. And I am going to a university this year which is going to teach me this stuff anyway so I'm watching this videos just to get an insight as to what i am going to doing for the rest of my life and also for entertainment. And of course to learn stuff. So what do you say now? Still a bad idea?\n\nShailank said:\n\nI have just passed high school. So my maths is still fresh.

You can use your time much better by reading some parts of the Feynman lectures or some actual physics textbook. Watching Susskind won't be very beneficial to you. But it's your time, so you should decide\n\nsmodak said:\n\nI do not really understand this advice against susskind lectures. Are they bad? Do they just touch the surface? What exactly is wrong with them?\n\nThey're not bad. They can be confusing at times though, but that's not my point.\n\nThe thing is that the OP wishes to invest time in something. While Susskind isn't bad, I think there are far better things to invest your time in. Reading a textbook or Feynman's lecture is waaaay better than watching the video's. The videos are entertaining and easy to watch though, so if you're looking for that, then go for it. But there are better ways to learn physics.\n\nShailank said:\n\nI have just passed high school.

And of course to learn stuff. So what do you say now? Still a bad idea?\n\nNo, go for it. I still watch his lectures from time to time. All I'm saying is that don't get overoptimistic about what you're going to get out of it, and don't feel stupid when he says all you need to know to follow the lecture is some basic algebra and calculus, and then your stumped half way into the lecture. Because you're led by the spirit of the course description to think that this is kind of a \"physics appreciation\" series, and that the maths will either be strightforward, simplified, or explained in detail, and that is not the case. It's also not very well organized--sometimes he goes off on tangents for long periods of time and I just tuned out. But that's also part of his charm, his tangential pontificating. Entertaining, but not always instructive.\n\nSo again, go for it. There's probably over 100 hours of material there. My guess is that you'll get no further than half a dozen hours through and move on to something else. Let us know, keep us posted!\n\nShailank said:\n\nI have watch three of his lectures and i didnt find anything wrong with it. But still where can i find the feymann lectures?\n\nIf you're doing well with the Susskind lectures, keep at it. I figured if it was really going that well you wouldn't have started a thread asking for advice on it. Both the old and the new series are pretty much the same. When I was watching them, I would use one to supplement the other if I got stuck on a given concept.\n\nSo, if it continues to work out, great. If not, I'd recommend checking out the NPTEL site:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC5E4E56893588CBA8\n\nI got a lot more out of those classes than Lenny's. Balakrishnan teaches Classical and QM, and does a great job actually teaching the subject, rather than just talking about or discussing it, like I feel Susskind does. There's a difference, but you be the judge.\n\nDiracPool said:\n\nNo, go for it. I still watch his lectures from time to time.

I mean they can't be a complete waste can they? And till now i have watched three lectures and there was nothing mathematically that stunned me. I'll see later n if it does. Then i can take help from some reference book. And yeah he does sometimes goes of the track but no harm in that. And yeah there is around 175 hours of it that i want to watch.\n\nDiracPool said:\n\nIf you're doing well with the Susskind lectures, keep at it.

And if k should watch classical or not which now i have started. Thankx for the link. I will watch susskind then i will watch them also."
