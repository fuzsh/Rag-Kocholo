He lives in Palo Alto, California.\n\nAndré Cabannes holds a PhD in statistics from Stanford University. He was a lecturer in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before turning to management consultancy and entrepreneurship, where among other things he was the translator of the Theoretical Minimum series into French. He lives in France."
