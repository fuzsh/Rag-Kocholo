        "text": "American directors have always been divided between the greats film studios in Hollywood and from work in small productions of independent films. American filmmakers have had a major impact on the international film market since the early 20th century. The dominant style of American cinema is the classic Hollywood cinema, and is still common to many films made to date. While the French Auguste and Louis Lumière are usually credited with birthing modern cinema, American filmmakers became a dominant force in the market.\n\nActually most of the innovations, inventors and artists were in Europe, mainly in France. The productions of the United States have been able to import what already existed in an industrial system, in which cinema has lost the inclination to become art to become a product of mass entertainment, capable of creating fashions and lifestyles, entertainment and forms of thought guided by careful commercial planning where the producer and the studio are the ones who have the decision-making power.\n\nIn mainstream cinema, the American director is just a cog in a large production machine, comparable to a simple employee executing the project. Even directors who have had great commercial success and great decision-making autonomy are unable to realize their most personal projects that are not in line with the logic of profit, as for example happened to Alfred Hitchcock for the film Psycho.\n\nAs a reaction to the dominant film industry, American directors who have worked in independent cinema have been and continue to be very numerous. Independent films play an important part and enjoy the possibility of having budgets that in other countries would be considered impossible. Most of these independent films, however, have only an independence and are produced by subsidiary companies of the big studios dedicated to creating products for the niche audience of moviegoers.\n\nAmerican Directors and Hollywood\n\nHollywood has produced the third-largest variety of films of any domestic cinema, after India and China, with more than 600 English-language films typically released each year. Even though the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand produce films in the same language, they are not part of the Hollywood system. Hollywood was conceived as a multinational cinema, and has produced numerous linguistic variations of some titles, often in French or Spanish. Contemporary Hollywood often outsources production to Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nHollywood is thought to have been the first film market, in the sense of being where the first film studios and production businesses emerged. It is the birthplace of numerous genres of cinema – including comedy, drama, action, music, romance, horror, sci-fi and warfare – and has effectively set the example for other national film markets.\n\nThe United States produced the world’s first synchronized sound musical film, The Jazz Singer, in 1927, and for the next several years has been at the forefront of the progress of sound film. In the early 20th century, the US film market was mainly based in the Hollywood area, Los Angeles, California. American director DW Griffith developed the film language. Citizen Kane (1941) by the American director Orson Welles is often referred to in critics’ polls as the best movie of all time. The major studios in Hollywood are the main source of the most commercial films in the world. Most Hollywood films that have grossed more at the box office outside the United States than films made in other places.\n\nThe most famous filmmakers who were not born in the United States, or who did not have their childhood in the United States, are not included in this list. Many filmmakers considered “American” were actually immigrants from other countries in their youth or adulthood. They were able to carry out large and expensive projects in America that were not feasible in their home countries. They had the opportunity to work with famous actors, receiving large fees for each film, but most of them soon came into conflict with the Hollywood production system, returning to their home country where they had made their arthouse films. The avant-garde films made with low budgets in Europe, in fact, remain their most important and considered fundamental works in the history of cinema. Standard production procedures and an all-star cast often created commercial successes but were not sufficient to make meaningful films.\n\nEdwin S. Porter\n\nEdwin Stanton Porter, born in 1870, was an American director, also very popular as a producer and director of photography with the Edison Manufacturing Company and the Famous Players Film Company. Of the more than 250 films produced by Porter, his essential film consists of: What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City, (1901); Jack and the Beanstalk (1902); Life of an American Fireman (1903); The Great Train Robbery (1903); The European Rest Cure (1904); The Kleptomaniac (1905); Life of a Cowboy (1906); Rescued from an Eagle’s Nest (1908); The Prisoner of Zenda (1913).\n\nDW Griffith\n\nDavid Griffith, born January 22, 1875, was an American film director considered among the most important figures of the history of cinema, gave rise to many elements of film montage and expanded the art of narrative film. Griffith is best known to modern audiences for directing the film The Birth of a Nation (1915), which earned its producers huge profits, but also attracted much debate for its anti-Semitic views and degrading depictions of African Americans, its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its racist perspective. The film caused riots in a number of major cities across the United States, and the NAACP sought to have the film banned. Griffith made his next film Intolerance (1916) as a response to critics, who he felt unfairly insulted his work.\n\nFred Niblo\n\nFred Niblo, born January 6, 1874, was an American director, producer and actor. He began his career in show business performing in vaudeville and live theater. After more than 20 years of live monologue performances, during which he traveled extensively around the world, he worked in Australia from 1912 to 1915, where he relied on the burgeoning film industry and made his first films 2.\n\nRobert J. Flaherty\n\nRobert Flaherty, born February 16, 1884, was an American filmmaker who directed and produced the first commercially effective feature-length documentary, Nanook of the North (1922). He continued to create new narrative documentaries with Moana (1926), set in the South Seas, and Man of Aran (1934), shot in Ireland’s Aran Islands.
