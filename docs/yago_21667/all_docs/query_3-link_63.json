        "text": "In her most memorable performance and the one for which she earned her special juvenile Oscar, Margaret played Judy Garland's youngest sister \"Tootie\" in Vincente Minnelli's turn-of-the-century mid-western musical MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944).\n\nThis still is from her big dramatic scene with Garland in the film, where young Tootie cries in heartache at the idea of moving away from her home and friends.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Tootie sings a delightful little song for her older sisters' guests:\n\nI was drunk last night, dear Mother.\n\nI was drunk the night before.\n\nBut if you'll forgive me, Mother,\n\nI'll never get drunk anymore.\n\nAnd in the still below, Margaret and Judy entertain together with a song and dance called \"Under the Bamboo Tree.\" (Note in the film how O'Brien's slippers change color from pink to blue during the course of this number. Whoops!)\n\nMargaret continued her success in tailor-made starring roles with THE CANTERVILLE GHOST (1944), her fourth film of the year and one which re-teamed her with JOURNEY FOR MARGARET co-star Robert Young. As Lady Jessica de Canterville, O'Brien loans her castle to a group of American soldiers in need of shelter, but there's a catch -- the castle is haunted by a 300-year-old ghost (played by Charles Laughton). The film as a whole is a bit muddled (it's a tongue-in-cheek satire of courage in war), and though her attempts at an English accent detract somewhat from her performance, Margaret still manages to hold her own in her scenes opposite Laughton -- a worthy accomplishment for an actress of any age."
