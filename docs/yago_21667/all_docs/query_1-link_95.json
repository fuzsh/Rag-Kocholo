        "text": "U.S. works from 1928 and earlier have entered the Public Domain.\n\nJanuary 1 is the day when works published in the U.S. 95 years ago enter the public domain making them free from copyright protection. This means they can be legally shared, without permission or fee. In addition to books, there are scores of silent films, famous Broadway songs, and well-known jazz standards. This year recordings from 1923 will become open for legal reuse.\n\nTo find more material from 1928 and earlier you can visit the Catalogue of Copyright Entries.\n\nFor more information on Public Domain Day see the Center for the Study of the Public Domain.\n\nYou can read more about the public domain in Professor James Boyle's book The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind (Yale University Press, 2008) — the full text is available for free here.\n\nLast updated January 2nd 2024.\n\nWorks going into the public domain are the specific works from 1928 as are sound recordings from 1923. This does not include the later books, movies, or translations based on the original books, or all of the other work by that author. For example, while you are free to use Hemingway’s short stories in Men without Women (including Hills Like White Elephants and In Another Country), later books such as A Farewell to Arms (1929) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940) are still copyrighted.\n\nHere are just a few of the books that are now freely usable:\n\nVirginia Woolf, Orlando\n\nErich Maria Remarque, All Quiet on the Western Front (in the original German, Im Westen nichts Neues)\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois, Dark Princess\n\nClaude McKay, Home to Harlem\n\nA. A. Milne, illustrations by E. H. Shepard, House at Pooh Corner (introducing the Tigger character)\n\nJ. M. Barrie, Peter Pan; or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (because the play’s script was not “published” for copyright purposes until 1928; note that Barrie’s 1911 novel “Peter and Wendy” has been public domain since 1967)\n\nRadclyffe Hall, The Well of Loneliness\n\nEvelyn Waugh, Decline and Fall\n\nAgatha Christie, The Mystery of the Blue Train\n\nWanda Gág, Millions of Cats (the oldest American picture book still in print)\n\nRobert Frost, West-Running Brook\n\nBen Hecht and Charles MacArthur, The Front Page\n\nPublic Domain Day 2024 by Jennifer Jenkins, Director of Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.\n\nIn 2022, under a new law called the Music Modernization Act, decades of sound recordings made from the advent of recording technology through the end of 1922 went into the public domain. In 2023 there was a pause, with no sound recordings entering the public domain. Now, in 2024, recordings from 1923 are open for legal reuse. You can download, remix, or use them in a soundtrack. Please note that only the 1923 recordings made by these artists are entering the public domain, not their later recordings.\n\nTo listen to old recordings, go to the Library of Congress National Jukebox—in 2024 the Library of Congress will make all of the 1923 recordings in its collection available for download from this site, while recordings from 1924 forward will be streaming-only until they are in the public domain.\n\nCharleston (recorded by James P. Johnson)\n\nYes! We Have No Bananas (recorded by Billy Jones; Furman and Nash; Eddie Cantor; Belle Baker; The Lanin Orchestra)\n\nWho’s Sorry Now (recorded by Lewis James; The Happy Six; the Original Memphis Five)\n\nDown Hearted Blues (recorded by Bessie Smith; Tennessee Ten)\n\nLawdy, Lawdy Blues (recorded by Ida Cox)\n\nSouthern Blues and Moonshine Blues (recorded by Ma Rainey)\n\nDown South Blues (recorded by Hannah Sylvester; The Virginians)\n\nWolverine Blues (recorded by the Benson Orchestra of Chicago)\n\nTin Roof Blues (recorded by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings)\n\nThat American Boy of Mine and Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (recorded by Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra)\n\nDipper Mouth Blues and Froggie More (recorded by King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, featuring Louis Armstrong)\n\nBambalina (recorded by the Ray Miller Orchestra)\n\nSwingin’ Down the Lane (recorded by the Isham Jones Orchestra; The Shannon Four; The Columbians)\n\nPublic Domain Day 2024 by Jennifer Jenkins, Director of Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.\n\nOnly the musical compositions—the music and lyrics that you might see on a piece of sheet music—are entering the public domain, not the recordings of those songs, which are covered by a separate copyright. The lyrics and music to Cole Porter’s Let’s Do It (Let’s Fall In Love) were published in 1928 and will be free for anyone to copy, perform, record, adapt, or interpolate into their own song. But the later recordings by Eartha Kitt, Lady Gaga, and others are still copyrighted. Note, however, that sound recording rights are more limited than composition rights—you can legally imitate a sound recording, even if your imitation sounds exactly the same, you just cannot copy from the actual recording. To hear some great adaptations of public domain songs and other material, visit WNYC’s Public Domain Song Project.\n\nAnimal Crackers (musical starring the Marx Brothers; book by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind and lyrics and music by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby)\n\nMack the Knife (original German lyrics by Bertolt Brecht and music by Kurt Weill; from The Threepenny Opera)\n\nLet’s Do It (Let’s Fall in Love) (Cole Porter; from the musical Paris)\n\nSonny Boy (George Gard DeSylva, Lew Brown & Ray Henderson; from the film The Singing Fool starring Al Jolson)\n\nWhen You're Smiling (lyrics by Mark Fisher and Joe Goodwin and music by Larry Shay)\n\nEmpty Bed Blues (J. C. Johnson)\n\nI Wanna Be Loved By You (lyrics by Bert Kalmar and music by Herbert Stothart and Harry Ruby; from the musical Good Boy)\n\nMakin’ Whoopee! (lyrics by Gus Khan and music by Walter Donaldson)\n\nYou’re My Necessity, You’re The Cream in My Coffee (George Gard DeSylva, Lew Brown & Ray Henderson; from the musical Hold Everything!)\n\nI Can’t Give You Anything But Love, Baby (lyrics by Dorothy Fields and music by James Francis)\n\nRamona (lyrics by L. Wolfe Gilbert and music by Mabel Wayne)\n\nThere’s a Rainbow ‘Round My Shoulder (Al Jolson, Billy Rose, Dave Dreyer; from the film The Singing Fool)\n\nBeau Koo Jack (lyrics by Walter Melrose and music by Alex Hill and Louis Armstrong)\n\nPick Pocket Blues (Bessie Smith)\n\nPublic Domain Day 2024 by Jennifer Jenkins, Director of Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.\n\n1928 was part of the transitional period from silent films to “talkies,” and it brought some of the last great silent pictures as well as the “first ‘all-talking’ picture.” There are features from comedic giants such as Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Laurel and Hardy. There are films chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry because they are “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” There are winners of some of the first Academy Awards. Please note that while the original footage from the listed films will be in the public domain, newly added material such as musical accompaniment might still be copyrighted.\n\nSteamboat Willie and Plane Crazy (the silent version) (directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks)\n\nThe Cameraman (directed by Edward Sedgwick and Buster Keaton)\n\nLights of New York (directed by Bryan Foy; billed as “the first ‘all-talking’ picture”)\n\nThe Circus (directed by Charlie Chaplin)\n\nThe Passion of Joan of Arc (directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer)\n\nThe Singing Fool (directed by Lloyd Bacon; follow-up to The Jazz Singer)\n\nSpeedy (directed by Ted Wilde; Harold Lloyd’s last silent theatrical release)\n\nIn Old Arizona (“100% all talking” film featuring singing cowboys)\n\nThe Man Who Laughs (directed by Paul Leni; features a character who inspired the appearance of the Joker from Batman)\n\nShould Married Men Go Home? (directed by Leo McCarey and James Parrott; the first Laurel and Hardy film to bill them as a team)\n\nThe Wind (directed by Victor Sjöström)\n\nThe Wedding March (directed by Erich von Stroheim)\n\nThe Crowd (directed by King Vidor)\n\nThe Last Command (directed by Josef von Sternberg; Emil Jannings won the first Academy Award for Best Actor)\n\nStreet Angel (directed by Frank Borzage; Janet Gaynor won the first Academy Award for Best Actress)\n\nDisney’s remaining Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons (created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks; Oswald was an inspiration for Mickey Mouse)\n\nPublic Domain Day 2024 by Jennifer Jenkins, Director of Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License."
