        "text": "Legendary child star Margaret O'Brien\n\nA gifted dramatic actress became one of the most popular movie stars of the 1940's. At age three she expressed a serious desire to pursue acting and posed for magazine covers for photographer Paul Hesse.\n\nHer film debut came with a one-minute shot in M.G.M.'s \"Babes on Broadway\"(1941). It was producer Dorey Schary who then cast her in \"Journey for Margaret\" (1942) as the orphaned little girl during the war. Overnight Margaret O'Brien soared to stardom! She was Heralded as a \"sensation,\" a \"child marvel\" and M.G.M. signed her to a long-term contract.\n\nMargaret remained the major child star throughout the 1940's, becoming a number one box office attraction. Her unforgettable performance as \"Tootie\" in Vincente Minnelli's \"Meet Me In St. Louis\" (1944) won her an Academy Award and earned her the position of \"America's Favorite Sweetheart.\"\n\nShe Held tight to her crown, turning out amazing performances in such classics as \"The Canterville Gliost\" (1944), \"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes\" (I 945), \"Lost Angel\" (I 946) and \"Unfinished Dance\" (I 947). Her brilliant work in \"The Secret Garden\" (I 948) and \"Little Women\" (I 949) immortalized her in the tear-filled eyes of audiences world wide. Additional movie successes (more than twenty in all) included \"Three Wise Fools, Tenth Avenue Angel\" and \"Music For Millions.\"\n\nBy the early 1950's Margaret had made a mint for M.G.M. and earned a personal fortune. Her star-status kept her working in films sporadically, and she did a great deal of stage and television work.\n\nHer acting ability strong, she continues to accept occasional acting assignments today.\n\nhttp://www.missmargaretobrien.com/"
