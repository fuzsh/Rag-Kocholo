        "text": "Souls for Sale is a 1923 American silent comedy drama film written, directed, and produced by Rupert Hughes based on the novel of the same name by Hughes. The film stars Eleanor Broadman in her first leading role, having won a contract with Goldwyn Pictures through their highly publicized \"New Faces of 1922\" contest just two years earlier.\n\nThe film is notable for its insights into the early film industry. Among the significant cameos in the film are appearances by directors King Vidor, Fred Niblor, Marshall Neilan & Charlie Chaplin and Erich von Stroheim as well as a number of actors, producers, and other filmmakers. Souls for Sale includes rare behind-the-scenes footage of Chaplin and von Stroheim directing the films A Woman of Paris and Greed, respectively.\n\nSouls for Sale was previously thought to have been lost until incomplete prints of the film were discovered. The film was later restored and aired on Turner Classic Movies and was released on DVD in June 2009. Souls for Sale is one of many works from 1923 that entered the public domain in the United States in 2019.\n\nDoors and bar open 11am. Coffee tea and refreshments available. $15 adults and free for kids 13 and under. No need to book get your tickets at the door."
