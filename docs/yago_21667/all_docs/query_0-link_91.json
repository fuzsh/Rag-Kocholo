Cparamount (pictures That's what he's looking for- THE wise exhibitor doesn't think about pictures just for today, tomorrow, and next week. He looks ahead to the coming months. To next year. He's got to be assured of a continuous supply of superfine box- office material over a long period of time if he expects to keep up with the procession in these days of strenuous competition. That's why a prominent exhibitor, having read Paramount's announcement of 11 big specials (one a week) for the first three months of 1923-24, having seen \"Hollywood,\" \"Bluebeard's 8th Wife,\" \"The Cheat\" and several others of the 11 and assured himself that they are exactly as promised, pointed to the remaining 9 months of 1923-24 and said: \"That's what I'm interested in.

They will be, we truly believe, the finest group of pictures ever released by Paramount or any other company in the whole history of the industry. They are emphatically worth waiting for.

J. — There were almost as many exchangemen on hand as exhibitors at the annual meeting of the M. P. T. O., of New Jersey, which closed its session here Thursday night. But the lack of numbers did not check enthusiasm. The meeting was well handled, and the closing night Marcus Loew brought a party of stars including Zena Keefe, Raymond Hitchcock and a dozen or so more, to enliven the event. At the business session the follow- ing officers were elected: President. R. S. Woodhull, Dover; First Vice-, president, W. C. Hunt, of Wildwood; ' Second Vice-president, Peter Adams,1 of Paterson; Treasurer, Louis Bal- j linger, of West Hoboken; Secretary, H. P. Nelson, of Elizabeth; National!

(Continued on Page I) e real problem of the business. Is it wise? Should it be done? Is that the answer to the usual summer slump? Or can something be done to offset the usual condition? It all depends where you sit as to how you see it. There are a lot of exhibitors who feel that the answer to the red hot summer weather is to close their doors. But there is another army of exhibitors who say that this isn't the answer. Some of the smarter men of this group insist that going to see pictures is, on the part of the public, a habit; that they come regularly when they can see good pictures, and once they drop off and lose the habit that it will take a lot to rebuild them into the habit. And these men say that the answer is that distributors and pro- ducers give them the right kind of pictures to show during the summer — the bigger and better ones, to make sure that the public will come in, as usual. Then they say— \"try and get 'em.\" And they are right. It is practically impossible for average big pictures to be secured for summer months showing. They Just cannot be had. This, of course, does not apply to New York, or even Chicago where special pre-views are occasionally tried out — as for instance this summer. Here is a real problem. One that a decent understand mg between a national exhibitor organization of the right kind and the Hays office might well discuss, and try to work out intelli- gently. It means, in the aggregate, hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is worth working on. THE 40 WEEK OVERHEAD One of the largest circuits in this country has solved, to an extent the summer season problem. They figure the year as of 40 weeks instead of 52, and pro rate their expenditures on a 40 week basis rather than a 52 week basis. Then if the weather becomes too hot and their houses go into \"the red in the summer they are closed. This basis of figuring has made it possible for the circuit indicated to work out their problem. In this the over- head does not include the advertising, because if any house Remains open over 40 weeks the additional advertising mi, be taken care of. Certain other trifling expenditures are also not ifncluded on this 40 week overhead basis. But generally speaking film rental, and other large charges are all included. And thow operating this circuit say this has solved their problem to a marked degree. ^^ Mike Levee has stepped out of his character aga.n.

You watch the little details that make or mar the success of your program. If you were running a \"legitimate\" house you'd keep a careful eye on the painting of scenery, the technical effects, and the choice of costumes. You would realize that these things are nearly as important as the production itself. S motion picture exhibitors, your production comes ready made. You can't supervise the details. But you can insist that you get a production properly presented photographically. You have a right to expect a first class print, on 3 that shows all the producer has put into the picture. A poor print of a good picture is an injustice to the producer, to you, and to your patrons. OME of the foremost producers of the West have learned that the best results are obtained, when the laboratory developing the negative also makes the release prints; when all this is done under the direct supervision of the men who ceated the picture. These producers are profiting by the camera-to-screen service of STANDARD FILM LABO- RATORIES. The exhibitors showing their pictures are profiting by the superiority of STANDARD PRINTS. The name, STANDARD PRINTS, is the exhibitor's guarantee of satisfaction. TOJJlWA J) Standard .Film Jfa/toraforie/s Phone Hollywood ■4366 Seward and Jiomaine.

Star. . .Seems very sincere in her por- trayal and secures full sympathy for her work. Cast James Kirkwood does splendidly in role that might easily have been overdone; Bessie Love offers excellent emotional bit; others include George Hackathorne, Claire McDowell and Robert Mc- Kim. Type of Story. . .Drama intended as propaganda to present to the public the dangers of drug forming habits with Mrs. Reid's presence lending considerable force through her fight to save the late Wallace Reid, story deals with fight of wife to save her husband, a district attorney, from a drug and her eventual sucess. Box Office Angle.... On account of the widespread notoriety given the death of Wallace Reid and the en- suing fight against narcotics by the Pacific Coast authorities, it is more than likely that this expose will have an excellent drawing power; besides its association with the late popular screen star, the more or less sensational trend of \"Hu- man Wreckage\" will also interest many. Exploitation Exhibitors should boost the picture for its value as propaganda against narcotics. It would be much better to go after business from this standpoint than to play it up as a sensational affair to attract the morbidly curious. Of course there will be those of this type that will want to see it for tiie ghastly human wrecks that it shows, but your appeal should be based on its danger pointing angle, if you would carry out the picture's intent. Mrs. Wallace Reid's appearance is essentially one of your biggest talking points. Let them know that Mrs. Reid has made the picture to show the evils of the thing that caused her husband's death, in the hope that its warning will be a means of saving others. Direction by John Griffith Wray has provided very vivid picture, secured splendid sympathy and gets message over rather forcibly; double exposure of hyena, symboli- cal of drug evil, slightly over- done. Author C. Gardner Sullivan Scenario C. Gardner Sullivan Cameraman Henry Sharp Photography Very good Locale Any city Length 7,000 feet Emil Jannings in \"Peter the Great\" Producer: Hamilton Theatrical Corp. Distributor: Paramount As a Whole ANOTHER STRIK- ING PHOTOPLAY FROM THE GERMAN STUDIOS; SUPERB- LY ACTED AND AN ABSORB- ING HISTORICAL THEME. Star Almost incomparable in his dramatic ability; always compelling and convincing in his portrayal and forceful without overacting. Cast Includes several very capable foreign players whose performances are well worth seeing, especially Dagny Servaes, Bernhard Goetzke and Walter Janssen. Type of Story Deals with the reign of Peter the Great through the period preceding his death through remorse for having killed his own son; a historical pageant exceptionally well performed, care- fully directed and thoroughly worth while from an entertainment view- point. Box Office Angle Decidedly best suited to an appreciative clientele that is capable of understanding the excellent acting and dramatic val- ues; probably would fail to arouse lower grade of picture patrons. Exploitation On \"Peter the Great\" you might interest any local Rus- sian society or organization in staging a pageant to help exploit the picture. Whether or not you should incur the expense that put- ting this one over properly would incur, depends entirely upon its suitability to your particular cli- entele. If you think they would ap- preciate the really worth while achievement which Dimitri Bucho- wetzki, the director who was also responsible for \"All For a Woman\" and \"Othello\", has accomplished, it should be well worth your while getting them in. Use Emil Jannings' name prom- inently and recall his appearance in the pictures mentioned above as well as in \"Passion\", \"One Arab- ian Night\" and \"Deception\". Refer to the historical value of the theme and let them know that it deals with that great historic character of which the title tells. Have your ushers attired in Rus- sian costumes and stage a prologue \"Revue Russe\" as the Rivoli did which included vocal numbers and a dance number with appropriate music and settings. Direction by Dimitri Buchowetski ; very fine in every sense; injects splendid dramatic values and pres- entation is excellent; handles play- ers capably; continuity occasion- ally choppy but the picture has been cut considerably which is probably the reason. Author Sada Oowen Scenario Sada Cowen Cameraman Not credited Photography Usually very good. Locale Russia. Length 6,042 feet. \"The Fog\" Producer: Max Graf Distributor: Metro As a Whole RATHER GOOD MATERIAL AND A FIRST RATE CAST BUT POOR CON- TINUITY AND DIRECTION KEEP IT FROM BECOMING MORE THAN AVERAGE EN- TERTAINMENT. Players Cast contains some popular favorites and capable per- formers such as Cullen Landis, Ralph Lewis and Louise Dresser, all of whom do very good work; Mildred Harris pleasing but not pretty enough for the numerous closeups they give her; others Lou ise Fazenda, Marjorie Prevost, Ann May, Ethel Wales, David Butler, Frank Currier, and Edward Phillips. Type of Story Drama of small town ethics greatly exaggerated and quite episodic; far too long and embracing over abundance of complications that stretch it to tedious length; small town poet- hero goes through a lifetime of hardships with the eventual hap- py ending with the girl he loves. Box office Angle If this was cut, and thus sustain the interest in better fashion, there will be a possibility of satisfying patrons with it. They will hardly be pleased with the picture as it is. It cannot hold them for the nearly seven reels that it offers. Exploitation Should the pic- ture be cut and you think it will be favorably received you can use the names of the players prominent- ly, especially Cullen Landis, Mil- dred Harris, Ralph Lewis and probably Louise Fazenda. The story contains elements of appeal, that with proper editing, can be brought out to better ad- vantage. There is a triple romance for you to talk about and the ad- ventures of the small town hero whose life is one continual battle against his straight-laced, narrow- minded father. You can make promises for Cullen Landis' work as the hero. Program readers, lobby display and liberal use of posters will be about the most extensive exploit- ation you can supply since there is little in the way of unusual stunts. Play up the title in the form of a teaser campaign.

Cast Robert Frazer good as the over-sure lover; cast is satisfactory on the whole and includes William Norris. Carl Gerrard, Betty Fran- cisco. Mayme Kelso and others. Type of Story Romance; rather slight in situations and at times too slow moving; rich girl, engaged to poor fellow, is on the verge of breaking the engagement when she meets his pipe-smoking father but at the last minute realizes how snobbish she is. reforms, and the marriage takes place. Box Office Angle Business likely to vary, depending upon the people you cater to; not big enough to draw particularly strong business under any circumstances. Exploitation Y our presentation and musical accompaniment should help considerably to put this one over. The picture can be made quite a bit more attractive by a tuneful and bright musical program. Of course if you recall Anita Stewart as a drawing card with your patrons, you can make an extra fuss about her appearance after a short absence. The title can be exploited in a teaser campaign in which you can distribute throw-aways reading: \"Are you a piker?\" and follow these later with others reading: \"Do you know 'The Love Piker?'\" This is another picture in con- junction with which a fashion show should serve to exploit it nicely. You might see the picture yourself, however, to judge exactly how much you would want to spend on a stunt of this kind. Unless you know pretty well that the picture will take, it might be too expensive to go in for anything as extensive in the way of exploitation. Display plenty of stills in the lobby and for the benefit of your women admirers you might make special mention of the attractive gowns worn by Miss Stewart. Since she appears in a beautiful bridal costume, and it being the season of brides, you might ar- range a tie-up with some store to display a bridal outfit with mention of the bridal party to be seen in \"The Love Piker' at your theater.

Type of Story Comedy-romance; deals with the modern craze for jazz and wild parties; old fashioned father keeps up daughter's pace until she tires of jazz and is willing to marry the fellow who really loves her. Box Office Angle Will undoubted- ly offer first rate diversion for the majority; should be a suitable sum- mer entertainment and is not over long which will allow you to use a variety of accompanying short reels. Exploitation You should be able to exploit this one very nicely with tie-up arrangements with dress stores, victrola shops and the like. Secure permission to place a show card in the window of a shop dis- playing the latest in womens' gowns saying: \"What the modern girl craves — clothes.\" The same idea can be worked out in the music shop which shows various musical instruments favored by the popular jazz bands. A fashion show at your theatre with local girls contesting for prizes for the prettiest girl, the best dressed, etc., should stir up considerable interest in \"Wander- ing Daughters\". You might also promise prizes for the holders of lucky numbers on the admission tickets with the awards consisting of a free marcel wave at some local beauty shop, a pair of stockings at a hose shop, etc. This should stir up business both for your theater and the shops. There is an elaborately staged country club partly in the picture in which there is a pool and a bathing suit display. This can be exploited and promises made for the entertainment afforded through the heroine's search for jazz. Direction by James Young; has been fairly conservative except for jazz party that has been rather lavishly staged; handled story very well for the most part and supplied well suited cast.

Length 5,619 feet \"The Mysterious Witness\" Film Booking Office As a Whole.... HAS FAIR AUDI- ENCE APPEAL ALTHOUGH IT IS A PRETTY CONVEN- TIONAL ORDER OF MELO- DRAMA. Players. . .Robert Gordon and Elinor Fair featured; Gordon has a good deal to do and contributes a couple of corking good fights. The re- mainder of the cast composed of regulation western types and Nan- nie Wright, a sweet old lady, as Gordon's mother. Type of Story. .Western melodrama; situations all quite familiar with villain plotting against hero at every turn, but with the usual vic- torious outcome for hero; tells about boy who clears his name and turns guilt upon accusers. Box Office Angle All right on a program with good short reels or with the average second or third run house audience: they probably won't mind the familiar story. Exploitation. .This is about the aver- age western so you know pretty well just to what extent it is worth your while boosting it. If you know your crowd likes this type of entertainment, \"The Mysterious Witness\" will undoubtedly satisfy- Better use plenty of stills in the lobby to let them know it isn't a mystery story as the title might suggest. Since the actual mysterious wit- ness is hero's horse you might have a man dressed as a cowboy ride about on horseback with a sign reading: \"This horse saved his master's life when he was accused of a murder he did not commit. Come to the blank theater and see 'The Mysterious Witness.' \" A trailer of the fight between Robert Gordon and Jack Connolly, hero and villain respectively, will give them an idea of the action they can expect and a shot of the rescue when Gordon saves Elinor Fair from falling to her death over the cliff, should let them know the fea- ture contains a bit of suspense. For the men folks talk about the action, especially the first rate fight that is staged, and for the women play up the romance between Gor- don and Elinor Fair.

The title is an attractive one anc that, together with the name of the star will, in all probability, b( sufficient to let them know whal sort of an entertainment to expect Laura La Plante makes an at tractive opposite for Gibson anc the rest of the cast is adequate Let your folks know that the here is a victim of shell-shock who is perfectly normal when quiet, but who goes to pieces at the sound ot a gun. Tell them that he proves he is not a coward, and is cured by another shock. Throwaways writh the slogan. \"When you go Gunning for Enter tainment See Hoot Gibson in \"Shootin' for Love,\" would be at- tractive. Another means of in teresting them would be a trailer of Hoot galloping to the girl's rescue, or of the explosion of the flood-gate. You might be able to interest the local chapter of the American Legion and invite the boys to see the picture. That could be used for a newspaper story.

Short Subjects \"Where's My Wandering Boy This Evening?\" — Mack Sennett — Pathe — Typical Turpin Type of production 2 reel comedy This is the first of a series of six or eight two-reel comedies that Ben Turpin is making for Pathe. Pre- sented by Mack Sennett, it is directed by J. A. Waldron with a supporting cast that includes Priscilla Bonner, Madeleine Hurlock, Dot Farley and James Finlayson. The cross-eyed comedian's followers will be well pleased with this one, and in view of its coming so close on the heels of his recent feature, \"The Shreik,\" it should have plenty of drawing power. The titles are clever, and while much of the action is slapstick, and even a bit sloppy, such as the bit in which the vamp who is wear- ing a dinner-gown with no back to speak of, gets a plateful of hot beans where her gown should be, it will nevertheless bring forth many laughs. Production values however, are not particularly high. \"The Homeward Trail\"— Universal Mediocre Western Plot Type of production 2 reel western drama Pete Morrison is the star of this Universal western and does as well as he can with the material offered. The plot is a variation of the time- worn theme of the widowed mother who is being dispossessed by the vil- lain who wishes to get possession of the land, and who finding that the widow's son is due with his ten years' savings has him shot. A stranger, Pete, finds the wounded man and is given the money with instructions to give it to Mrs. Davis. After various mix-ups in which Pete has to imper- sonate the son, etc., things smooth themselves out. The action is quick and there is some good riding but the titles are quite trite. \"Steel Shod Evidence\"— Range Rider — Pathe — Good, Snappy Western Type of production. .2 reel western drama Leo Maloney and Josephine Hill again score with this two-reel western of the Range Rider series. It deals with the actions of a couple of crooks who plot to keep a certain horse out of a coming cowpuncher's race. A very clever pup helps the action which is kept moving swiftly all the way through the picture. For those who like this sort of thing, \"Steel Shod Evidence\" contains full measure of first-class entertainment. \"The Uncovered Wagon\"— Hal Roach — Pathe — Amusing Burlesque Type of production. . . .1 reel comedy In this Hal Roach 1 reeler, which purports to be a burlesque on the much talked of Cruze picture, Paul Parrott is the featured player. There is of course much rough-and-tumble stuff, but several bits are extremely funny. The prairie-schooners are flivvers with canopies attached and the attacking Indians ride on bicycles of all descriptions and vintages. One bit in particular is sure to get a laugh. The cavalcade fords a river — with the accent on the \"fords\" which are en- tirely submerged as they cross but come up on the other bank. This sequence is very well done. It's a good one-reeler and the title alone will bring a smile. \"Bum Slickers\" — Universal — Amusing Tramp Comedy Type of production. . . .1 reel comedy In this, as the title would suggest, Neely Edwards and Bert Roach do their stuff as the two \"gentlemen of the road\" to pretty good advantage. The two members of the Army of Unoccupation are mixed up in a stock-swindle, come out way ahead of the game and finally are forced to give the money to a man who is drinking poison because he is broke. There are one or two good gags and the team is very likeable. Pathe Review No. 27 — Interesting Short Reel Type of production. . 1 reel magazine The opening subject of this Pathe Review presents some fine snow scenes which will be very welcome at this season; next comes a glimpse into a theater in China where a native drama is in progress. The entire performance takes eight hours, you arc told. A clever silhouette entitled \"The Classic Centaur,\" deals with the manner in which that imaginative being might have passed his days. The Popular Science subject deals with the manner in which sap is cir- culated through flowers and affords some interesting miscroscopic views. The Pathe-color travel picture shows the oasis of Nefta in Tunis. \"Snooky's Treasure Island\" — Ham- mons — Educational — Kids Will Love it Type of production. .2 reel animal comedy Snooky, the Humanzee, has been most appropriately named. He is a marvelous monk. This time they have him dressed as a Chink and working for an ex-pirate, also a Chink, who runs a laundry in his spare time. Snooky is the fast friend of the ship's cook, a lad who is bitterly treated by the Skipper. It is, however, the wonderful facial ex- pressions of Snooky and his \"human- ness\" that holds the attention rather than the little story. Full credit should go to M. S. Peebles, who directed, under the supervision of John Rounan. There is slightly too much footage, but kid's won't mind that, and will thoroughly enjoy this one. A lion and his family have also been used to excellent advantage. Move to Boom Italian Films (Special to THE FILM DAILY) London — The Cinema describes \"a new strenuous effort\" by a group of Italian producers headed by Carmine Gallone to place Italian productions \"once more on the pedestal they formerly occupied.\" Other members of the group in- clude the well-known directors, Rig- helli, Genina, and Palermi. Several leading foreign directors, including Abel Gance, who made \"J'Accuse,\" are to be invited to join the group. Few Pictures in China (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Washington — Lansing W. Hoyt, American Trade Commissioner at Shanghai says in \"Commerce Re- ports\" that, outside of Peking and Manchuria there are only 30 picture theaters in China as follows: Shang- hai, 12; Tienstin, 6; Canton, 6; King- kong, 5; and Hankow, 1. The largest is the Olympic in Shanghai which seats 400 and the newest is the Carl- ton at Shanghai which is leased by China Theaters, Ltd. for $4,000 per month. Caplan Back From The Coast (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Detroit — Maurice Caplan, of Metro- politan Films, is back from an ex- tended trip to the coast and Van- couver. Many Minnesota Houses Close (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Minneapolis — Over 30% of the theaters in this state will be closed for the summer, according to a re- cent survey made by the exchanges.. 160 Free Government Films (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Washington — The Department ot Agriculture has over 160 educational films listed, dealing with plants and insets. These films run mostly in one-reel length although some are in two and a few in three reels. The films can be had free of charge, the only cost being for transportation. Second Attempt to Rob Newman Theater (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Kansas City — The same robber that beat the Newman theater out of $10,000 last March, again held up Milton Field, the manager. The bandit was forced away by a ruse of Fields.

It all depends whether you look up for inspiration, or keep your head down in the dirt.\" And this is based on actual experience. Many of the houses taken over by Comerford were \"in the red'- or barely profitable when they were put in the chain. Then O'Todle was sent around to bolster up. \"It's surprising,\" said O'Toole, \"how little you have to do — how few changes you have to make, to turn a losing house into a paying- venture. Just a matter of looking up and doing things different.\" And he's right. \"LAB\" DEVELOPMENT Important man in the business talking. \"Do you know.\" he said, said he, \"that the most important development that has occurred in the industry in the past ten years is where no one thinks about?\" And when the head shaking was oxer he went on: \"In the laboratories. That's the spot. And no one ever thinks about it. Direction has improved a bit; the sets are finer and bigger — I don't know whether the acting has improved much — of course the stories are better. But it's in the little old 'lab's' — the factory end of the business, that the real development has taken place. Laboratory work today is so much finer, so much better, so far advanced, over what existed five or ten years ago, that there is no comparison. Fine prints are bringing in more business at the box office than any other given cause. The dis- tributor who isn't on to his job, and keeps his prints fresh and right, deservedly should be out of business.\" Something to think about, gentlemen. KEEP OPEN TIME Once again the warning. For the 'steenth time. But still worth harping about. Any exhibitor who fails to keep a lot of time open this coming season deserves all that's coming to him. And this, despite that some of the larger companies — and for that matter the smaller ones as well — are trying harder than ever before to book in blocks. It may be that the coming season will prove disappointing — some of the many big pictures may be just pictures — and that will be a pity. But regardless of how good they are, stick to the idea — keep some time open. As much as you can, and more if you dare. Because the bigger and better the pictures are the more you will need them. Let the other fellow block book. And you will be smiling. When he has his \"tzoras.\" LOOK AT 'EM How many pictures shown by Mister Average Exhibitor are seen by him before he plays them, or even books them? How many? It is to laugh. \"How few\" should be the question. It's a remarkable situation. This is probably the only business in the world where a man buys, sight unseen, that which he has to sell again. This, despite that the hazard of not seeing wdiat they buy is greater in this than in any other business. When the exhibitors of this country learn that to operate profitably they cannot stand pat and offer what the bigger and other fellow \"cleaned up\" with, and instead put on something their own clientele favors, not only will exhibition values come down, but there will be less \"flops.\" Very often it isn't the fault of the picture that a \"flop\" develops. It's the fault of the ex- hibitor. Remember every picture, even the best, isn't good every- where. There are some towns where Chaplin has \"flopped.\" \"THE SPOILERS\" Years ago it was a great story. And a great picture. Today, it's still a great story but a far greater picture. The old picture made a lot of money. For everybody. So will the new one. It's a real box office. Don't worry about that. And the direction of Hillyer is fine while the work of Milton Sills and Anne Nillson, together with a lot of others, makes it stand out. And the fight between Sills and Noah Beery ! What a fight ! After seeing that this is certain — no leading man stuff for yours truly. Not on your life. Nix. DANNY.

In part it reads. \"The projector utilizes the old plan of a water cooler, but possesses, it is claimed, several new advantages. The cost of the machine is low enough for any school or church, and moreover it is absolutely safe for these institutions. The chief feature is the condenser, which is filled with water and forms the two concave mirrors concentrating the lights upon it, a single condenser. The two ends of the condenser are convex glass of unequal diameter. When the light rays reach the film after passing throogh aboot 12 inches of water they have a temperature of 90 degrees, thereby eliminating all dangers of fire.

In this connection it is understood that aomng the early releases plan- ned in which Corrine Griffith would be starred was \"Lilies of the Field,\" and while officials of the First Na- tional refuse to discuss the matter and while the same attitude was tak- en by Charles R. Rogers who has been handling Miss Griffith's business matters it is reported that when First National releases \"Lilies of the Field\" Corinne Griffith will be found in the production. Relative to this matter some re- ports go so far as to say that prob- ably Miss Griffith's forthcoming ser- ies will be released through First Na- tional rather than another distribu- ting company which was expected to handle her productions. Suggest Confab A conference of all distributors to discuss the many prob- lems facing members of that branch of the business is suggested by Al Lichtman following a reading of \"The Golden Bubble\" in which Alexander Aronson expounded his ideas on distribution. Lichtman's remarks on the Aronson article are interesting. He says : \"To be perfectly candid, I am not familiar with such pro- duction methods as described in Mr. Aronson's article. No doubt, Mr. Aronson based his statement on actual knowledge. How- ever, such methods, in my opinion, do not exist in well regulated studios, and I can happily state that our studios are not operated in that careless fashion. As a matter of fact, for the eleven pic- tures produced by us during the past year, each averaging about 6500 feet, there never was more than 11,000 feet of negative shot on any one subject, proving that if a studio is properly conduct- ed, productions well planned and carefully worked out, and the (Continued on Page 4) Increase Capital (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Dover — Fitzpatrick & McElroy have increased their capitalization to $1,200,000.

Good Will Words' of wisdom are written under this heading in a weeklv magazine published by the Astor theater, St. Paul, one of the Finkelstein and Ruben chain of theaters. the article is decidedly worth while, and says: Seneca wrote: \"He that does good to another, does good to himself.\" 'A motion picture theater without the good will of its patrons is not built upon a foundation of security. A motion picture theater needs the good will of its patrons as much as it needs its screen if it is to establish itself as a definite, usetul, and successful institution in a community. \"Abraham Lincoln said: 'Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment nothing can fail, without it nothing can succeed. Consequently, he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces de- cisions.' . . , \"The motion picture theater is a resourceful institution, and its manager has at his command a great medium through which good will and public sentiment may be created, nurtured, and sustained. \"To those who are interested in the progress of the motion picture, the many fine examples of activities tending toward the creating of good will which are observed from day _to day are indeed gratifying and encouraging. From flood sicken areas we read of benefit performances to aid the homeless fn the decent case of a St. Paul church being destroyed by fire we learn with pleasure of the theater manager donating his theater for church services; charitable orga nations benevolent societies, welfare leagues, newsboys clubs Y.

Many Big Pictures Will Give Exhibitor a Better Chance Next Season Says Williams Just back from the Coast where he saw a number of large pictures which will be released next season, J. D. Williams declared on Saturday that the big pictures for the coming year will give many exhibitors a chance to more than break even next season. \"The average exhibitor has 26 bad weeks out of 52,\" said he, \"but with the type of picture scheduled for next year he will have a greater op- portunity to make money. Exhibitors rarely lose money on big pictures — ■ they go into the red with the little ones. \"I saw Fairbanks' new one and it's bigger than 'Robin Hood.' I saw Norma's Ashes of Vengeance' and it is a fine, magnificent picture. And many others.

The suit of Orrin Johnson against Goldwyn to recover under a contract by which he was engaged to take a leading part in a film, has been set- tled by the parties and discontinued by an order of Supreme Court Justice Wasservogel. The second default judgment to be filed against Glenn Hunter in the City Court within a few days has been filed by Lewis Buxton for $1,828 as the balance on a claim for $2,485 for automobile transportation furn- ished to Hunter between New York and other points from June to Decem- ber, 1922. The other judgment was filed by Abraham Libman on a note. An answer has been filed in the Su- preme Court by Associated Produ- cers in a suit of Nathan & Semerad. over the film. \"A Pasteboard Crown,\" the complaint in which has not been filed. The answer admits that the defendant took over the dis- tribution of the film which has an exhibition value fixed at $200,000. The contract provided that the cost would not exceed $37,000, and that until the plaintiffs had been reim- burted that sum the defendants would only get 35%, later the par- ties to the contract would get 50% each. The suit of Alexander Gordin against Fox Film and Virginia Tracy to recover for services in connection with the film, \"Queen of Sheba,\" was settled when it came before Su- preme Court Justice Cohalan by the payment by Fox of $600 cash and an agreement to publish an announce- ment as to Gordin's services in con- nection with the film, \"making public announcement of the valuable ser- vices rendered by Mr. Gordin in the preparation of the Biblical,, historical, and legendary data, and the prepa- ration of a story and synopsis based on same.\" Fox agreed that Gordin was entitled to this \"screen and credit and recognition which he has not heretofore received.\" Victor Sutherland has returned to New York for the finishing scenes of \"The Love Bandit.\" Marking Time (Continued from Page 1) Bernard T.

I believe that waste in production only exists in organizations headed by men who do not know their business. While on the subject, we might mention that a great many people are still of the belief — all that is required to make motion pictures is to possess the raw film, a camera, a group of actors with a man wearing puttees directing them, and a good megaphone voice. But when you analyze motion pictures from the artistic as well as the commercial angle, one comes to the conclusion that there are few real creators of motion pictures who can be relied upon from year to year to produce consistent, intelligent and entertaining pictures. When one looks further, one finds that these producers of good pictures have made a real study of motion pictures. In a great part of their work, they are innovators and origina- tors. When you look still further and you analyze the productions that are not fit to show to the public, you will find they were made by a great number of incompetent imitators who have been a parasitic strain upon this industry for many years and who have merely gained an outlet for their pictures because of the unsound economic factors still governing the distributing methods in vogue. \"Distribution: As to Mr. Aronson's view of distribution, I am in thorough accord and in full sympathy. The terrific cost of distribution and the lack of standardization as to prices, is the one big blot upon this industry which must be effaced, if this industry is to continue to build. As to Mr. Aronson's plan, there is no doubt as to its feasibility, but its success depends entirely upon the willingness of the producers and dis- tributors in this country to co-operate. \"I would like to put Mr. Aronson's suggestion to a practical test by inviting all the distributors in this country to a joint conference for the purpose of discussing freely the great many problems confronting us, or of common interest to all. I would like to broach the proposition with the idea that whether we like it or not, everybody in the motion picture business is dependent di- rectly or indirectly upon one another for success. There is no organiza- tion nor individual that can navigate alone in this industry. For one thing, it takes the good-will of the whole world to support a motion picture organization. No organization can consider itself too big to stoop to co-operate with its fellow distributors, who are confronted with the identical problems to a proportionate degree. \"Therefore, if the distributors. in this country are not too egotistical to consider themselves above all of their competitors, let us get together. Perhaps there is a way of meeting on some common ground, to eliminate the waste in distribution and above all create some standard form of values — fair to the big as well as the little. It has always been my theory that this industry can only continue to build and maintain the continued support of the masses by creating a standardization of values as between renter and exhibitor, thereby promoting the greatest possible outlet for all motion pictures throughout the world. \"The present methods employed are not conducive to the above, and it is my firm belief that all factors big and little can benefit by the joint conference suggested herein for the purposes outlined. \"Mr. Aronson deserves the congratulations of the industry for hav- ing the courage to speak his mind on this vital subject.\" if.

Grainger states that every important exhibitor in the country has not only expressed opti- mism in personal conversation, but al- so in the number of contracts already signed for Fall showing. \"North, East, South and West are out to pick the best and back the best,\" said Grainger. \"Made keen by the knowledge that the producers in general are out to do bigger things in the way of production, exhibitors in turn are determined to present these pictures on a scale that is not only beautiful and impressive but also showmanly. Next season will see ex- ploitation as it really should be. Bar- numism of the twentieth century will come to light. \"I look forward to a really pros- perous year all around. The big the- aters are going after the big produc- tions, and through long years they have become experienced judges. In this day of screening first, it's the pic- ture with the goods that counts. I have heard some talk about paper promises, but it seems to me that there's nothing to that sort of thing if the distributor is willing at all times to show the product that he is going to sell.\" Laemmle Off To Europe Carl Laemmle sails on the Aqua- tania for Europe.

O. (Special to THE FILM DAILY) Detroit — Members of the F. I. L. M. Club of Michigan, independent exchange operators and others in- terested in distribution claim that in various cities exhibitors, members of the M. P. T. O. of Michigan, are operating in a manner which makes it difficult to obtain what they claim are \"decent values\" for pictures. This includes all productions from the ordinary five-reeler to the super- specials. They contend that the M. P. T. O. of Michigan has completed a system by which all members forward to the Secretary's office a complete list of all prices which they pay for film service. Those prices it is said are tabulated and before a member con- summates the purchase of this pic- ture, he communicates with the De- troit office and then determines from the information received whether or not he should pay the price asked. In some sections, notably Bay City and Saginaw, exhibitors are charged with dividing up film service regard- less of the desires of the distributor who shall pay which line of service and what they shall pay. In this connection it is said that a certain distributor forwarded to an exhibitor in Bay City, who for the purpose of distinction shall be called Jones, a print of a new special. When the salesman arrived in Bay City he dis- covered that the print was not in Jones's theater but in \"Smith's.\" Sur- prised at this he later learned from Jones that the film service of his company had been allotcd to Smith and that he Jones, said he wasn't in- terested. When the salesman tried to explain that after all the print belonged to his company and they might have something to say about who was going to use it. Joins said he wasn't interested. It later vcloped that the only way that JO could break in on the print was tq have Smith put in writing that he didn't want this particular service, in which event Jones would be m :< position to deal for it. It is said that tactics of this type have become so annoying that mem- (Continued on Page 2) Tomorrow, July 4, being In- dependence Day and a legal holiday, there will be no issue of THE FILM DAILY pub- lished.
