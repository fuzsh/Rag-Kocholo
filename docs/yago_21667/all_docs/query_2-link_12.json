        "text": "Hotchka Movies by the Decade feature #160 :: August 16•22\n\nThis week’s new movie releases include many classic and popular films, along with several award winners and nominees. Of note, two films this week brought first Oscar wins 20 years apart to two actresses who share the same last name. This week also gave us the film that introduced an iconic horror actor to the US film industry. One 1933 film was the first to feature the total destruction of a large American city. 1963 gave us a classic — and the best — haunted house film ever made. 1973 produced a popular film in the martial arts genre that was the last for its iconic star. 1983 gave a future Batman his first lead role, and brought two popular TV characters to the big screen. 1993 brought a Chinese director to the US for the first time, and gave his Belgian star one of his most popular films. 2013 took a real person and fictionalized his life, botched up a novel adaptation, and gave us a creative film in the horror genre. All of these and more are celebrating milestone anniversaries this week, but are any of your favorites on the list? Sound off in the comments section below!\n\n1923\n\nAugust 17 – Blinky (USA)\n\nCast: Hoot Gibson, Esther Ralston, Mathilde Brundage, DeWitt Jennings, Elinor Field, D.R.O. Hatswell, Charles K.

The film was remade in 1929 as a musical, directed by 1923 cast member Mervyn LeRoy.\n\nAugust 19 – The Broken Wing (USA)\n\nCast: Kenneth Harlan, Miriam Cooper, Walter Long, Miss DuPont, Richard Tucker, Edwin J. Brady, Ferdinand Munier, Evelyn Selbie\n\nDirector: Tom Forman\n\nProduction Company: B. P. Schulberg Productions, distributed by Preferred Pictures, Al Lichtman Corp.\n\nTrivia: Based on the play The Broken Wing by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard. Cinematographer Harry Perry devised a camera mount that allowed him to film from a Curtiss JN-4 biplane. Using a camera mounted on the fuselage behind the rear cockpit, Perry was able to shoot the pilot in the front cockpit. Unfortunately the film is considered lost.\n\nAugust 19 – The Destroying Angel (USA)\n\nCast: Leah Baird, John Bowers, Noah Beery, Ford Sterling, Mitchell Lewis\n\nDirector: W.S.

Gordon Edwards\n\nProduction Company: Fox Film Corporation\n\nTrivia: The film was produced in cooperation with the Navy and was intended as a propaganda film to encourage support for a larger navy. This film was Bela Lugosi’s entry into American cinema, although his name is misspelled as ‘Belo’ in the credits. Lugosi once commented on the irony of appearing in a film about the navy while he comes from a landlocked country that has no need for a navy. The film used a technique of showing Lugosi’s eyes in extreme close-up, a device employed in several of his following films including Dracula. The film does survive and is in the public domain. The film premiered with a 91-minute run time in New York City, but the Chicago version ran 18 minutes shorter and was the version used for subsequent releases. Some prints also included color tinted scenes. The film was retitled His Country in France.\n\nAugust 19 – Three Wise Fools (USA)\n\nCast: Claude Gillingwater, Eleanor Boardman, William H. Crane, Alec B. Francis, John Sainpolis, William Haines, Lucien Littlefield, ZaSu Pitts, Martha Mattox , Creighton Hale, Raymond Hatton\n\nDirector: King Vidor\n\nProduction Company: Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, distributed by Goldwyn Distributing Company\n\nTrivia: A print of the film exists at the Cinematheque Royale de Belgique. Adapted from the play by Austin Strong and Winchell Smith. The film gave a high profile role to up-and-coming actor William Haines, who felt his top hat distracted his acting making his performance terrible, but he received positive notices and was offered a choice of four roles in new films.\n\nAugust 20 – The Huntress (USA)\n\nCast: Colleen Moore, Lloyd Hughes, Russell Simpson, Walter Long, C.E. Anderson, Snitz Edwards, Wilfrid North, Helen Raymond\n\nDirector: Lynn Reynolds\n\nProduction Company: John McCormick Productions, distributed by Associated First National Pictures\n\nTrivia: Based on the 1922 novel The Huntress by Hulbert Footner. The film is considered lost.\n\n1933\n\nAugust 17 – Sing Sinner Sing (USA)\n\nCast: Paul Lukas, Leila Hyams, Don Dillaway, Ruth Donnelly, George E. Stone, Joyce Compton, Jill Dennett, Arthur Hoyt\n\nDirector: Howard Christie\n\nProduction Company: Larry Darmour Productions, distributed by Majestic Pictures\n\nTrivia: Loosely based on the 1932 Libby Holman-Zachary Smith Reynolds case.\n\nAugust 17 – The Private Life of Henry VIII (UK)\n\nCast: Charles Laughton, Merle Oberon, Wendy Barrie, Elsa Lanchester, Binnie Barnes, Everley Gregg, Robert Donat, Franklin Dyall, Miles Mander, Laurence Hanray\n\nDirector: Alexander Korda\n\nProduction Company: London Film Productions, distributed by United Artists\n\nTrivia: Released in the US on September 21, 1933. The film was originally intended as a vehicle for Charles Laughton and his wife Elsa Lanchester, focusing just on Henry VIII’s fourth wife Anne of Cleves. As the project grew, the story was modified to focus on five of his six wives, omitting the first, Catherine of Aragon, because no one involved had any particular interest in her. She was simply described in the film’s opening intertitles as a ‘respectable woman’. Director Alexander Korda ignored the religious and political aspects of Henry’s reign to concentrate on his relationship with his wives. This was the first foreign film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, and the first to win an Oscar (Best Actor for Laughton).\n\nAugust 18 – Blind Adventure (USA)\n\nCast: Robert Armstrong, Helen Mack, Roland Young, Ralph Bellamy, John Miljan, Beryl Mercer, Tyrell Davis, Henry Stephenson, Laura Hope Crews\n\nDirector: Ernest B. Schoedsack\n\nProduction Company: RKO Radio Pictures\n\nTrivia: Director Ernest B. Schoedsack and actors Robert Armstrong and Helen Mack were also involved in RKO’s Son of Kong which was filming at the same time as Blind Adventure. All three had also been part of King Kong.\n\nAugust 18 – Deluge (USA)\n\nCast: Peggy Shannon, Sidney Blackmer, Lois Wilson, Matt Moore, Fred Kohler, Ralf Harolde, Edward Van Sloan, Samuel Hinds\n\nDirector: Felix E. Feist\n\nProduction Company: Admiral Productions, distributed by RKO Radio Pictures\n\nTrivia: Very loosely based on the 1928 novel of the same name by S. Fowler Wright, with the setting changed from the UK to the US. Wright was disappointed the ending of the book was changed for the film and said the finished film was ‘ghastly’ and advised his children not to see it. This is the first film to depict the total destruction of New York City (although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles). Part of the stock footage of ships and planes returning to port under severe storm warnings includes actual footage of the large U.S. Navy rigid airship USS Macon (ZRS-5), which would later be lost at sea in 1935. Republic Pictures later bought the film for just its special effects footage, using some of the scenes of destruction in S.O.S. Tidal Wave (1939), Dick Tracy vs Crime Inc (1941), and King of the Rocket Men (1949). The film was thought lost for many years until an Italian dubbed print was discovered in 1981. A preservation dupe was made and was released with English subtitles. A 35mm negative with the original English dialogue was discovered in 2016, restored and released on Blu-ray in 2017.\n\nAugust 18 – Morning Glory (USA)\n\nCast: Katharine Hepburn, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Adolphe Menjou, Mary Duncan, C. Aubrey Smith, Don Alvarado, Fredric Santley, Richard Carle, Tyler Brooke, Geneva Mitchell, Helen Ware\n\nDirector: Lowell Sherman\n\nProduction Company: RKO Radio Pictures\n\nTrivia: Katharine Hepburn won her first Best Actress Oscar for this film, a role that had been tailored for RKO’s biggest star at the time, Constance Bennett. Hepburn read the script and convinced the producers that she was born to play the part, and Bennett was instead cast in Bed of Roses. The film was shot in sequence, unusual for the time. It was remade in 1958 as Stage Struck.\n\nAugust 18 – Pilgrimage (USA)\n\nCast: Henrietta Crosman, Heather Angel, Norman Foster, Lucille La Verne, Maurice Murphy, Marian Nixon, Robert Warwick, Louise Carter, Betty Blythe, Francis Ford, Charley Grapewin, Hedda Hopper\n\nDirector: John Ford\n\nProduction Company: Fox Film Corporation\n\nAugust 18 – The Girl from Maxim’s (UK)\n\nCast: Leslie Henson, Frances Day, George Grossmith, Jr., Lady Tree, Stanley Holloway, Gertrude Musgrove, Evan Thomas, Desmond Jeans\n\nDirector: Alexander Korda\n\nProduction Company: London Film Productions, distributed by United Artists (UK), J.H. Hoffberg Company (USA)\n\nTrivia: Opened in the US on October 1, 1936. Adaptation of the 1899 play La Dame de chez Maxim by Georges Feydeau. A French version was filmed at the same time and released under the original title.\n\nAugust 19 – Captured!

Seiter\n\nProduction Company: Frank Ross Productions, distributed by RKO Radio Pictures\n\nTrivia: Jean Arthur is noticeably filmed from her left side, which cinematographers had determined was her most favorable angle.\n\nAugust 19 – Black Marketing (USA, short)\n\nDirector: William Castle\n\nProduction Company: Office of War Information, distributed by RKO Radio Pictures, War Activities Committee of the Motion Picture Industry\n\nTrivia: An educational film warning American civilians against buying unrationed foodstuffs and materials.\n\nAugust 19 – Destroyer (USA)\n\nCast: Edward G.

A colorized version of the cartoon was released as part of Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5, while the original version is included on Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3.\n\nAugust 21 – The Seventh Victim (USA)\n\nCast: Tom Conway, Jean Brooks, Kim Hunter, Isabel Jewell, Evelyn Brent, Erford Gage, Ben Bard, Mary Newton, Hugh Beaumont\n\nDirector: Mark Robson\n\nProduction Company: RKO Radio Pictures\n\nTrivia: Mark Robson’s directorial debut and Kim Hunter’s first film appearance. The film was originally a murder mystery set in California, but the script was rewritten as a prequel to Cat People set in New York City, with Tom Conway reprising his role as Dr. Louis Judd. Critics found the film incoherent, and it was later discovered that Robson and his editor removed four substantial sequences from the film including an extended conclusion. The film has been noted for its homoerotic undertones. The opening scene at the boarding school used the set featured in RKO’s The Magnificent Ambersons, released the year before.\n\n1953\n\nAugust 19 – Big Leaguer (USA)\n\nCast: Edward G. Robinson, Vera-Ellen, Jeff Richards, Richard Jaeckel, William Campbell, Carl Hubbell, Paul Langton, Lalo Rios\n\nDirector: Robert Aldrich\n\nProduction Company: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distributed by Loew’s, Inc.\n\nTrivia: The story is fictional but Edward G.

The film was announced in 1952 but production was delayed until March 1953 to take advantage of the Spring Training season, with filming conducted in Melbourne, Florida with the New York Giants. The rest of the film was shot in Cape Canaveral in 17 days.\n\nAugust 19 – The Frightened Bride (USA)\n\nCast: Mai Zetterling, Michael Denison, Flora Robson, Dennis Price, André Morell, Jane Hylton, Naunton Wayne, Mervyn Johns, Celia Lipton\n\nDirector: Terence Young\n\nProduction Company: Raymond Stross Productions, distributed by Screenbound International Pictures\n\nTrivia: Released in the UK as The Tall Headlines, and based on the 1950 novel of the same title by Audrey Erskine Lindop.\n\nAugust 21 – Roman Holiday (UK)\n\nCast: Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power, Harcourt Williams, Margaret Rawlings, Tullio Carminati, Paolo Carlini, Claudio Ermelli\n\nDirector: William Wyler\n\nProduction Company: Paramount Pictures, distributed by Paramount British Pictures (UK), Paramount Pictures (USA)\n\nTrivia: Premiered in New York City on August 27, 1953 and entered general US release on September 2. The screenplay was co-written by Dalton Trumbo, however he received no screen credit as he was on the Hollywood Blacklist at the time. His credit was finally restored in 2011. Blacklisted director Bernard Vorhaus worked on the film as an assistant director under a pseudonym. Selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1999. Cary Grant turned down the lead because he felt he was too old to play Audrey Hepburn’s love interest … although he would do just that ten years later in Charade. Some suggest he turned down the role because he knew Hepburn would get all the attention. Gregory Peck accepted the role and was contractually given sole star billing with Hepburn listed much less prominently in the credits. Midway through filming, Peck suggested that Hepburn get equal billing. Elizabeth Taylor and Jean Simmons were considered for her role, but both were unavailable. This was Hepburn’s first major film role after a career in British and Dutch films that began in 1948. The Italian Ministry of Tourism had originally refused permission for the movie to be filmed in Rome on the grounds that it would ‘degrade Italians’, but once that issue was resolved filming began in Rome. It was originally planned to be filmed in color, but shooting outdoors was prohibitively expensive so it was done in black-and-white. The film earned ten Oscar nominations including Best Picture, winning Best Story (Trumbo), Best Costume Design – Black-and-White (Edith Head), and Best Actress (Hepburn). Hepburn also won the BAFTA for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.\n\nAugust 21 – Sky Commando (USA)\n\nCast: Dan Duryea, Frances Gifford, Touch Conners, Michael Fox, Will R. Klein, Morris Ankrum\n\nDirector: Fred F. Sears\n\nProduction Company: Clover Productions, Inc., distributed by Columbia Pictures\n\nTrivia: Touch Conners was the early screen name of Mike Connors. Frances Gifford’s last major film appearance. Principal photography took place over eight days, with most of the remaining prodcution work involving combining stock footage into the film, sometimes jarringly spliced together resulting in major continuity issues. Connors was told that the last two days of filming with him and Dan Duryea was unusable, and he expected to earn an extra two days pay to reshoot their scenes. Instead the director just inserted more stock footage.\n\n1963\n\nAugust 18 – A Ticklish Affair (USA)\n\nCast: Shirley Jones, Gig Young, Red Buttons, Carolyn Jones, Edgar Buchanan, Peter Robbins, Bill Mumy, Edward Platt\n\nDirector: George Sidney\n\nProduction Company: Euterpe, Inc., distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nTrivia: Also known as Moon Walk, the title of a story upon it was based by Barbara Luther, which appeared in Ladies Home Journal in 1962. The film was originally intended for Jean Simmons, but Shirley Jones was cast due to contractual obligations. Jones’ performance was characterized as ‘dull’ and she soon left Hollywood to appear on Broadway before returning as the matriarch of TV’s The Partridge Family.\n\nAugust 21 – The Caretakers (USA)\n\nCast: Robert Stack, Polly Bergen, Diane McBain, Joan Crawford, Virginia Munshin, Ellen Corby, Barbara Barrie, Herbert Marshall, Sharon Hugueny, Robert Vaughn, Susan Oliver\n\nDirector: Hall Bartlett\n\nProduction Company: Hall Bartlett Productions, Inc., distributed by United Artists\n\nTrivia: Based on the 1959 novel The Caretakers by Dariel Telfer. Released in the UK as Borderlines. Co-writer/co-producer Jerry Paris appears as a passerby Lorna (Polly Bergen) bumps into on the street. Joan Crawford arranged for each day’s scenes with veteran actor Herbert Marshall, an old friend who was in frail health, to be shot first thus allowing him to finish his work early in the day. Crawford was on the board of directors of PepsiCo, and product placements for Pepsi-Cola include a scene at the hospital picnic, which features a wagon that is dispensing the soft drink. Oscar nominated for its black-and-white cinematography. Golden Globe nominated in the Drama category for Best Picture, Best Actress (Bergen) and Best Director.\n\nAugust 21 – The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze (USA)\n\nCast: Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Joe DeRita, Jay Sheffield, Joan Freeman, Walter Burke, Peter Forster’ Maurice Dallimore, Richard Devon, Anthony Eustrel, Iau Kea\n\nDirector: Norman Maurer\n\nProduction Company: Normandy Productions, distributed by Columbia Pictures\n\nTrivia: Loosely based on the Jules Verne classic Around the World in Eighty Days.

The film’s sets were designed to be brightly lit with no dark corners or recesses, and all the rooms had ceilings to give a claustrophobic effect on film. Robert Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Screenwriter Nelson Gidding read the novel and believed it to be about the mental breakdown of the main character, but a meeting with Jackson confirmed the story was definitely about the supernatural. Elements of the insanity remained in the script to leave the audience wondering if the ghosts were real or in Eleanor’s mind. Jackson approved the shortened film title, as it was the same one she considered for the novel. To take advantage of film credits offered in the UK, Claire Bloom and Richard Johnson were cast as part of the obligation that the cast had to be partly British. Fashion designer Mary Quant was brought in to give Bloom’s Theo a more bohemian look. Russ Tamblyn, under contract to MGM, liked the script but initially turned down the role of Luke because he felt the character was a jerk. The studio threatened him with suspension if he didn’t reconsider. He said he found the character much more interesting upon a second reading of the script, and it became one of his favorites of his films. Ettington Park, now the Ettington Park Hotel, was used for exterior shots, and housed some of the cast and crew during filming, which unsettled both Harris and Bloom who found the location ‘scary looking’. Robert Wise’s contract specified the film could only be shot in black-and-white. To give the exterior a more sinister look, Wise used infrared film which brought out more detail in the stone, making it look like a ‘monster house’. The exterior was also filmed in a way as to make the windows look like eyes to give the impression that the house was alive. Harris was said to suffer from depression during filming and did not interact with Bloom at all, which puzzled the actress. Harris later told her it helped develop her character and the two reconciled. To enhance the actors’ performances during scenes in which they react to off-stage voices or sounds, Wise and his sound editors created a ‘pre-scored’ soundtrack of voices and noises that were played during filming. While some sounds were replaced in post-production, the ‘pre-scored’ sounds were left on the soundtrack just as the actors heard them. Sound editors collected and created sounds in an empty manor house for a week to create the pre-score. Subtle special effects were employed at times. A door that appears to ‘breathe’ left audiences believing it was made of rubber, however it was laminated wood pushed from behind by a very strong crewman. A specially constructed spiral staircase was used to give the impression that it was about to collapse while Luke, and later Eleanor, were ascending it. The effect disturbed the actors so much that Wise had to walk on it himself to prove it was completely safe. Wise used a number of rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer’s sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. The film is also known for depicting the lesbian character Theo as feminine and not predatory, but censors demanded she never be shown touching Eleanor to keep the lesbianism less obvious. Ted Turner announced he was planning to have the film colorized in 1990, but Wise pointed out his contract specifying the film could only be in black-and-white.\n\n1973\n\nAugust 17 – Cops and Robbers (USA)\n\nCast: Cliff Gorman, Joseph Bologna, Delphi Lawrence, Charlene Dallas, John P. Ryan, Dolph Sweet, Joe Spinell, Shepperd Strudwick\n\nDirector: Aram Avakian\n\nProduction Company: Elliott Kastner Productions, distributed by United Artists\n\nTrivia: The original screenplay by Donald Westlake was expanded by the author into a novel.\n\nAugust 17 – Happy Mother’s Day, Love George (USA)\n\nCast: Patricia Neal, Cloris Leachman, Bobby Darin, Tessa Dahl, Ron Howard, Kathie Browne, Joe Mascolo, Simon Oakland, Thayer David\n\nDirector: Darren McGavin\n\nProduction Company: Taurean, distributed by Cinema 5 Distributing\n\nTrivia: Also known Run Stranger, Run.

Guercio took a salary of $1.00 to have the budget to secure the services of cinematographers Conrad Hall. A majority of the film was shot without permits, because the Arizona Highway Patrol did not cooperate with production. Filming ran several days behind schedule due to first time director Guercio’s inexperience. Robert Blake later wrote that he and Hall basically co-directed the film while Guercio stood around. The role drew attention to Blake which led to his being cast in the TV series Baretta. Blake also received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.\n\nAugust 19 – Enter the Dragon (USA/Canada)\n\nCast: Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Jim Kelly, Ahna Capri, Shih Kien, Bob Wall, Angela Mao Ying, Betty Chung, Geoffrey Weeks, Yang Sze, Peter Archer\n\nDirector: Robert Clouse\n\nProduction Company: Sequoia Pictures, Concord Production Inc., Warner Bros. Pictures, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nTrivia: Bruce Lee’s final completed film, premiering in Los Angeles one month after his death. One of the most successful martial arts films of all time, regarded as one of the greatest martial arts films of all time, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004. Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan appear in uncredited roles. The original screenplay title was Blood and Steel. Rod Taylor was the original choice for the role of Roper, but Lee deemed him too tall, so John Saxon was the preferred choice. Saxon would only agree to the role if the script was changed so Roper lived and Williams is killed. Rockne Tarkington was originally cast as Williams but dropped out days before filming, so producers hastily arranged a meeting with karate world champion Jim Kelly, and he was immediately cast, the role launching his film career. Chuck Norris turned down the role of O’Hara stating that one cinematic loss to Lee was enough for him. Scenes were filmed on location in Hong Kong and without sound, dialogue and sound effects were added in post-production.\n\n1983\n\nAugust 16 – Wavelength (USA)\n\nCast: Robert Carradine, Cherie Currie, Keenan Wynn\n\nDirector: Mike Gray\n\nProduction Company: Rosenfield Company, Wavelength Film Company, distributed by New World Pictures\n\nTrivia: Mike Gray developed the film after his deal with Columbia Pictures to direct The China Syndrome fell through. Wavelength was being developed at Warner Bros. but the studio dropped the film after the release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which the studio deemed too similar. The film was to be released before E.T the Extra-Terrestrial, but was delayed due to the film’s extensive special effects. John Carpenter’s 1984 Starman has been accused of plagiarizing Wavelength.\n\nAugust 19 – Easy Money (USA)\n\nCast: Rodney Dangerfield, Joe Pesci, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Candy Azzara, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jeffrey Jones, Taylor Negron, Tom Noonan, Val Avery, Tom Ewell\n\nDirector: James Signorelli\n\nProduction Company: Easy Money Associates, distributed by Orion Pictures\n\nTrivia: Bill Murray was originally cast as Paddy but dropped out and was replaced with Tom Noonan.

Jeffrey Byron, Richard Moll and some vehicles seen in the film also appeared in Charles Band’s The Dungeonmaster (1985). Moll shaved his head for the movie, and the producers of Night Court liked the look so much he kept shaving his head for the show.\n\nAugust 19 – Mr. Mom (USA)\n\nCast: Michael Keaton, Teri Garr, Frederick Koehler, Taliesin Jaffe, Courtney & Brittany White, Martin Mull, Ann Jillian, Jeffrey Tambor, Christopher Lloyd, Graham Jarvis, Carolyn Seymour, Miriam Flynn\n\nDirector: Stan Dragoti\n\nProduction Company: Sherwood Productions, distributed by 20th Century-Fox\n\nTrivia: Michael Keaton’s first lead role, which he was offered after producers saw his screen debut in Night Shift. John Hughes wrote the film based on his own disastrous experience looking after his kids in the absence of his wife. The project was originally conceived as a TV movie. Hughes had a TV deal with Aaron Spelling and brought him on as an executive producer. Universal execs didn’t like that Hughes worked in Chicago, so he was fired and a group of TV writers was brought in to rework the script. Ron Howard turned the film down to direct Splash, and the studio decided to turn it into a theatrical film.\n\nAugust 19 – Strange Brew (Canada)\n\nCast: Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis, Max von Sydow, Lynne Griffin, Angus MacInnes, Paul Dooley, Brian McConnachie, Mel Blanc, Tom Harvey, Douglas Campbell\n\nDirector: Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas\n\nProduction Company: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distributed by MGM/UA Entertainment Co.\n\nTrivia: Opened in the US on August 26, 1983. Also known as The Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew. The film’s story elements are loosely based on Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The film was developed after the success of Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis’ comedy album The Great White North, which sold a million copies. SCTV exec producer Andrew Alexander warned the pair that he owned the characters and if they attempted to write a script they would be sued. MGM made a deal for the film based on album sales, not the script.\n\nAugust 19 – The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez (USA)\n\nCast: Edward James Olmos, Victoria Plata, James Gammon, Tom Bower, Bruce McGill, Brion James, Alan Vint, Timothy Scott, Pepe Serna, Michael McGuire, William Sanderson, Barry Corbin, Jack Kehoe, Rosanna DeSoto, Ned Beatty\n\nDirector: Robert M.

Carpenter, Wilford Brimley, Sven-Ole Thorsen, Jules Sylvester, Robert Apisa\n\nDirector: John Woo\n\nProduction Company: Alphaville Films, Renaissance Pictures, distributed by Universal Pictures\n\nTrivia: John Woo’s US film debut. The film is based on the 1932 film adaptation of Richard Connell’s 1924 short story ‘The Most Dangerous Game’. Universal was nervous about Woo and sent Sam Raimi to oversee things to fill in if needed. Woo wanted Kurt Russell for the lead, but the actor was too busy at the time to accept. Woo was obligated to deliver an R-rated film but the MPAA gave it an NC-17 rating for the extreme violence. Woo had to re-edit the film six times because the MPAA never specified what they found objectionable. Woo made 20 cuts to the film, including cuts to the opening chase scene and the Mardi Gras warehouse scene.
