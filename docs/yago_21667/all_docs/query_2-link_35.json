        "text": "APRIL IS EARLY LUBITSCH MONTH\n\nTo acknowledge Ernst Lubitsch as one of the masters of cinema is a given. A BIG, wonderful given. And although (nearly eighty years after his passing) we still enjoy, praise, and laugh copiously at such classics as Trouble in Paradise, Ninotchka, and Heaven Can Wait (the 1943 one, of course), there’s a veritable cinematic goldmine to be mined from years before he even set foot on American soil.\n\nIt is, thus, with great pleasure to therefore announce the High Definition releases of up-to-now rare Lubitsch titles, that the writer-director made in Germany during the teens, immediately after The Great War (and one during!). While certainly rougher technically than the smooth, sophisticated gems he is rightfully known for, these unusual looks at the battle of the sexes definitely display primitive stirrings of his genius, what we now call The Lubitsch Touch. Two such supreme examples have been double-billed in a recent Blu-Ray release from The Ernst Lubitsch Collection: 1918’s I DON’T WANT TO BE A MAN (Ich mochte kein Mann sein) and 1919’s THE DOLL (Die Poppe). Both titles reside on one Kino Classics 1080p disc, and hail from restorations via the F.W. Murnau Stiftung/Bundesarchiv Filmarchiv.\n\nAside from the director’s already apparent sly style, MAN and DOLL are photographed and cowritten by a pair of his exemplary collaborators, d.p. Theodore Sparkuhl and scripter Hanns Kraly (both of whom would follow him to America).\n\nEqually important, in relation to these titles is the participation of their sensational star, Ossi Oswalda (1899-1947), who, on the mere basis of this pair of pips, should be propelled into the pantheon of delightful and important silent screen actresses.\n\nOswalda, though, did have a decent following during her prime – enough so, that she was dubbed The Bavarian Pickford. This is ironic, as Ossi actually played her age – late teens-early twenties – as opposed to Pickford, who continually and disturbingly played little girls well into her thirties. Furthermore, Oswalda, in spite of her movies’s weird storylines, realistically portrayed young, intelligent, independent women – playfully enjoying her awakening sexuality. Absolutely not so with the oft seemingly “tetched” Mary. The director’s pictures with and following Oswalda were nevertheless enough of a happy jaw-dropper to encourage Pickford to woo Lubitsch to the States for his American debut. For this alone, she deserves praise – although the ultimate working relationship between the pair was a tumultuous oil-and-water (hate at second sight) experience (Rosita, 1923). As far as I’m concerned, another reason to further rally to Ernst in earnest.\n\nThe Lubitsch magic is already blossoming in 1918’s I DON’T WANT TO BE A MAN (Ich mochte kein Mann sein), and still “shocks” more than a century later. To fathom it immediately coming out of post-Great War Germany is practically unbelievable. Yet, here it is.\n\nYoung, comely Ossi (why argue with a perfect moniker?) comes from a wealthy family. She is everything a perfect daughter could be…NOT. Snarky Ossi is a feminist on steroids. She dares to question her “place,” and strives to live her life as an independent woman. More “alarmingly,” Ossi hangs with important figures (i.e. powerful men), engages in political discourse, jokes, smokes, and gambles with them; in polite circles, she’s referred to as a tomboy.\n\nThis so enrages her family that they hire Dr. Kersten, a professional handler to keep her in line. The idea of a man showing Ossi how to be a woman amuses her to no end.\n\nShe dumbs it, girlies it, and then decides to take it to the next level. Ossi assumes the identity/disguise of a man, and follows Kersten into his exclusive men’s club (women are only allowed in as dates/escorts). She shamelessly flirts with the doctor’s squeeze, effectively breaking up their…liaison, then begins to comfort him during his loss. It’s here – with his barriers down (and hers up) that she begins to fall for him.\n\nWorse, he’s beginning to fall for her, a “man”! A passionate show of affection nearly sends him over the edge, as Ossi works on smoothing out this gender bender.\n\nStar Oswalda is captivating – sexy, funny, and genuinely likeable. Curt Goetz as Kersten also delivers in a performance of someone – once assured, but now questioning his urges. Other cast members nicely fill out the remainder of this early Lubitsch triumph, and include Ferry Sikla, Margarete Kupfer, and Victor Janson.\n\nLubitsch’s direction (from his script) is as lively as his leading lady. The excellent camerawork by his favorite d.p. Theodor Sparkuhl perfectly captures the fun and hilarious frustration of the eyebrow-raising situations.\n\nThe Kino Classics Blu-Ray of I DON’T WANT TO BE A MAN looks pretty good. It’s culled from existing materials, and runs about 45 minutes. A recent (2005) score by Neil Brand is in perfect tune with the riotous narrative.\n\n1919’s THE DOLL (Die Puppe) takes Lubitsch and Oswalda to the next rung up the surreal ladder. Based on a composition by E.T.A. Hoffman and an operetta by A.E. Willner, Lubitsch’s and Hanns Kraly’s screenplay follows the unremarkable exploits of Lancelot, a decadent young man who has absolutely no luck when it comes to women. This takes a dire turn when he discovers that in order to lay claim to a sizable inheritance, he must wed. What to do, what to do…?\n\nWith time running out, Lancelot hatches a bizarre plan. He approaches a renowned doll maker, whose expertise is creating lifelike toys for children. Lance engages him to build him a woman to scale that he can pass off as his spouse.\n\nThe toymaker and his assistant agree, but not before their devious plot is overheard by Ossi (again, using her actual name because why argue with success?), the manufacturer’s beautiful daughter. In a crazed twist, she takes the place of the toy, and proceeds to drive her “owner” crazy. Lancelot’s desire for riches become freakishly sidetracked as he finds himself sexually aroused by a toy.\n\nThe climactic deviltry reveal Lubitsch (who appears in a prologue) at his lip-biting best. Oswalda, once again, proves herself one of the screen’s most underrated comediennes, and has fine support from Hermann Thimig (as Lancelot), Victor Janson (as Ossi’s puppet master father), Max Kronert, Marga Kohler, Gerhard Ritterband, Jakob Tiedke, and Josephine Dora.\n\nAs superbly photographed by Sparkuhl and Kurt Waschneck (enhanced by the original color tints), and with a new (2023) score by Meg Morley, this authentically strange, erotic but oft hilarious adventure is worthy of rediscovering for all fans of classic cinema and/or the director. An informative supplement comprises audio commentary from famed film historian and Lubitsch scholar Joseph McBride (who, does likewise on MAN).\n\nFunnier than M3GAN, and almost as destructive, THE DOLL is likely Chucky’s favorite silent comedy.\n\nTHE DOLL/I DON’T WANT TO BE A MAN.

Apparently, Kino-Lorber Studio Classics (in conjunction with Universal Studios) has likewise realized this strong connection, and, as if further proof is needed, k.o.s the fans into ring noir-vana with an entire set of lurid boxing thrillers via their FILM NOIR: THE DARK SIDE OF CINEMA, VOLUME X collection, now available on Blu-Ray.\n\nWhy Kino-Lorber opted to give us TWO Tony Curtis fight dramas in a boxing trilogy (rather than simply pairing them together as a double-feature disc), instead of getting a bit more diverse is a head-scratcher. The 1951 sock-er-roony, The Iron Man, starring Rock Hudson (in one of his first leads) would have been a better, diverse choice (it was a remake of a 1931 Universal pre-Code pic with Lew Ayres). Maybe they didn’t know, maybe it wasn’t available…Rights probs…quality deterioration…Oh, well. The two Curtis punch-ups comprise 1952’s FLESH AND FURY and 1955’s THE SQUARE JUNGLE, and they certainly are of varying quality.\n\nFURY was one of Curtis’s initial stabs at being taken seriously, and not merely as beefcake. In the pic, he portrays Paul Callan, a deaf mute from the ghetto, doomed to be a “dummy” gofer for the lowlife thug contingent. Until he finally gets pissed over the physical and mental abuse, and punches out some creep. A wily promoter sees a buck to be made, and begins to groom the grateful human pinata for prizefighting stardom. Curtis is genuinely good in this movie, having learned sign language for the part, and uses his face and body to express a myriad of emotions.\n\nNatch, there are women who want to teach him other things, primarily bad girl Jan Sterling, who is truly skanktabulous (the good babe is Mona Freeman).\n\nAs Callan’s star rises, and he tastes the good life, he becomes aware of a school for the deaf – supporting it, and, much to his delight, learning that his disability is curable. This is a movie that we Boomers loved when it played The Early Show here in New York City during the mid-1960s. The next day at school, we all discussed it with our vast ten-year-old knowledge of the human condition. It was a classic. FLESH AND FURY is nicely directed by Joseph Pevney (a former actor-turned-filmmaker, who costarred with John Garfield in Body and Soul), with some good monochrome photography by Irving Glassberg. Bernard Gordon’s script (from a story by William Alland, another actor who switched hats to work as a writer-producer) goes beyond the usual U-I direct-to-the-nabe fare. An unobtrusive score (or culling of one) by Hans J. Salter accompanies the above-and-below the belt histrionics. And there’s a nifty supporting cast of pros: Wallace Ford, Connie Gilchrist, Katherine Locke, Harry Shannon, Louis Jean Heydt, Tom Powers, Nella Walker, and, as Curtis’s brother Harry Guardino. Daniel Kremer, director of documentaries on Lenny Bruce, Sidney Lumet, and Marlon Brando offers audio commentary.\n\nThe same ‘A’-for-effort good stuff can’t be said for THE SQUARE JUNGLE, a 1955 potboiler, riding on the moniker tails of that year’s Blackboard Jungle, and 1950’s asphalt one. It’s also a vain attempt to cash in on the likes of Body and Soul, minus the heart and vitality. To quote Mamie Van Doren’s brilliant comment (from her excellent memoir, Playing the Field), at Universal-International, everything was “their answer to,” not having an original idea on the lot (she was one of the last U-I contracted actresses groomed for stardom). JUNGLE concerns another barrio tough, Eddie Quaid, who knows he’s better than the rest.\n\nHis violent streak is tamed and honed by ex-con promoter Bernie Brown and former beat cop Jim McBride. With his needy alcoholic pop in tow, Eddie ascends to celebrity stardom, grabbing all the perks that go with it – including vengeance on the local girl who’s family originally spurned him. Soon, his head becomes as swollen as his mitts, and the movie becomes a parody of itself that could be subtitled, The Scum Also Rises.\n\nA maudlin final act is pure Monogram – surprising, as the script is by George Zuckerman (99 River Street, The Tarnished Angels, Written on the Wind), with the pic’s producer being the usually savvy Albert Zugsmith (The Incredible Shrinking Man, Touch of Evil, Written on the Wind). Jerry Hopper’s direction defines “labored,” although the top-flight supporting cast tries hard (Ernest Borgnine, Jim Backus, Paul Kelly, Pat Crowley, Leigh Snowden, John Marley, Barney Phillips, David Janssen, Carmen McRae, and even Joe Louis).\n\nTepid screenplay aside, the slick widescreen camera of the great George Robinson attempts to save it, but is further compromised by the usual schlock U-I treacly library music. Sidebar: in the 1960s, Castle Films (a home movie Universal subsidiary) released a ten minute 8MM sound excerpt of THE SQUARE JUNGLE. It played far better than the complete 86-minute version.\n\nOn the surface, 1956’s WORLD IN MY CORNER looks like another boxing shoo-in for Tony Curtis; whether the star (now in a growing position of power) rejected the project, or the studio decided the genre was Tony-ed out remains a riddle of the sands (the desert, not the Las Vegas casino). The strange choice of putting the likes of Audie Murphy in the role (as opposed to someone like William Campbell) is truly a fascinating asterisk to the Western star’s career. Once again, I evoke the inspired words of Mamie Van Doren. In this case, WORLD becomes Universal’s “answer to” Champion, the flick that put Kirk Douglas on the A-list map. Murphy portrays tough tenement tenant Tommy Shea, who takes no bs from anyone – an immediate popcorn tell that he may have a future in the ring. This sounds pretty good to Tommy – getting paid for beating people up. What few morals he has as quickly eschewed for fame, money, and vampy women. Casting aside the decent folk who believe in him (former down-and-out manager Dave Bernstein and good woman Dorothy, daughter of a sleazoid Musk-eqsue exploiter/promoter out to corrupt the pug-thug), Tommy learns the hard way about what happens when you’re an SOB. But is it too late?\n\nTruth be told, Murphy is quite good in the part – another marker that he was a better actor than most Hollywood wags gave him credit for. That said, he was soon back in the saddle (his next pic was Walk the Proud Land). The remaining cast is quite game, with John McIntire as Bernstein, Barbara Rush as Dorothy, Jeff Morrow as his shameless exploiter, plus Tommy Rall, Howard St. John, Art Aragon, and Myrna Hansen. House talent Maury Gertsman does an excellent job with the monochrome widescreen visuals, while a gumbo of stock music cues (from the creative minds of no less than Heinz Roemheld and Henry Mancini) comprise the patch quilt score. Although the screenplay by Jack Sher doesn’t even try for originality, it does take a dual baton from the aforementioned Douglas pic and On the Waterfront – the most unusual aspect here being the Jewish mob involvement in the nasty proceedings.\n\nJesse Hibbs once again proves that he could get a direct-to-the-nabe/drive-in pic done quickly and professionally – with entertainment trumping innovation. Supplements include film historian Eddy Von Mueller’s audio discussion (he likewise provides same for SQUARE JUNGLE) and a theme-related trailer gallery.\n\nBoxing fans will no doubt go ga-ga over this three-round canvas-kisser while noiristas will enjoy any one of its entries as a genre co-feature (no main bouts here).\n\nFLESH AND FURY [1.37:1]\n\nTHE SQUARE JUNGLE [1.78:1]\n\nWORLD IN MY CORNER [1.85:1]\n\nAll black-and-white; 1080p High Definition.

SRP: $49.95.\n\nMARCH IS PUGILIST NOIR MONTH\n\nPerhaps the most successful boxing pic ever made pre-Raging Bull, 1949’s CHAMPION, available on restored Blu-Ray from Olive Films/Paramount Home Entertainment, certainly lived up to its title with the critics, audiences, and the motion-picture Academy (with six Oscar nominations).\n\nThe title itself is ironic, as its protagonist, while proving himself in the ring, is more relevantly a champion scumbag.\n\nWhile often compared to The Set-Up, released the same year, and brought into a plagiarism suit stupidly initiated by Howard Hughes, CHAMPION more closely resembles 1947’s Body and Soul. Both come from liberal roots: Soul scripted by Abraham Polonsky, CHAMPION by Carl Foreman (each man would sadly be blacklisted). In addition, both narratives’ main characters have better-half underlings: Charley Davis’s BFF Shorty in Soul, Midge Kelly’s disabled brother Connie in CHAMPION. An especially snarky Foreman dig was having the he-men Kelly boys christened with feminine forenames.\n\nBut who is Midge Kelly? Again, like Davis, he’s a ghetto tough guy – we’d say diamond in the rough, but he ain’t no diamond. Kelly is take-no-prisoners sociopath, who figures the world owes him – and will grab everything he can, deservedly or not.\n\nMost prominently, this refers to women. While many movies previously told tales of cads, ladies men, love ’em and leave ’em types, etc., CHAMPION‘s Kelly built upon that dubious legacy – with ferocious brutality. As long as they’re desirable to him, he’ll one-night-stand any female in his path. This not only includes the prerequisite “bad girl” mob-connected ho, but the innocent beauty he meets at a highway diner, and the sensitive stunning artist (married to his one of his bosses). There was never such an adult portrayal of a womanizing bastard on the post-Code screen before Midge Kelly. That said, he not only ruins women’s lives, but pretty much everyone else’s he comes in contact with. Not since Erich von Stroheim tossed a newborn out a window has there been a key movie character that audiences loved to hate more than Midge. The lion’s share of CHAMPION‘s success is thus owed to its lead, Kirk Douglas. While Douglas had been around for several years, he usually played second-string weaklings (Strange Love of Martha Ivers), slimy erudite gang bosses (Out of the Past), and even sophisticates (Letter to Three Wives). This is the pic that made him a superstar. It put him in the Widmark-Mitchum arena of being able to effortlessly switch from to good to bad guys; with Douglas, however, there was always an untrustworthy element, even to his so-called heroes. The supporting cast in this powerhouse action-drama is perfect: Arthur Kennedy as Midge’s bro earned (like Douglas did) an Oscar nom, as did the extraordinary cinematography of Franz Planer and the excellent score by Dimitri Tiomkin (Harry Gerstad did take home a statuette for Best Editing). Mark Robson (like The Set-Up‘s Robert Wise) began directing at RKO with the Val Lewton horror unit, and his expertise at creating atmospheric suspense definitely carried over to CHAMPION‘s depiction of a human monster.\n\nBut back to the cast. Paul Stewart (as Midge’s betrayed manager), Luis Van Rooten, Harry Shannon, Ralph Sanford, John Daheim, Esther Howard, Don Brodie, Paul Dubov, Tim Ryan and Hal March do their jobs well, with the lead triad of ladies, Marilyn Maxwell (as trampy Grace Diamond), Ruth Roman (as the deflowered waitress), and Lola Albright (as the artist) being particularly effective.\n\nDouglas and Roman each scored Warner Bros. contracts because of this movie; Roman prospered, while Douglas early-on felt suffocated by the studio system and bought his way out to go independent.\n\nWhile not nearly as good as The Set-Up, CHAMPION became a box-office smash (while its competitor did only marginally well), due to UA’s and liberal producer Stanley Kramer’s faith in the project. It should be noted that any of the few RKO titles that turned a large profit during this period did so in spite of Howard Hughes, and not because of him; by 1957, the company was dust.\n\nThe Blu-Ray High Definition platter of CHAMPION is yet another superb 1080p transfer.\n\nThe 35MM black-and-white elements look and sound aces, and should delight all classic/noir collectors.\n\nIt’s to Douglas’s credit that the ending – a guaranteed downer in any other kind of flick – never fails to have viewers smirking “Good!” for its generous helping of just desserts.\n\nCHAMPION.

SRP: $19.99.\n\nMARCH IS PUGILIST NOIR MONTH\n\nMy pick for the greatest fight flick ever made, Robert Wise’s uncompromising 1949 triumph THE SET-UP, k.o.s the platter competition via a recent Blu-Ray remaster from the Warner Archive Collection.\n\nActually, uncompromising should be in quotes because while the events on-screen are realistically ugly, the behind-the-scene politics were not seamlessly in tune with the creators of this extraordinary piece.\n\nYet, for fight and noir fans, it all seems perfect. And, I guess it is. After all, nothing in Hollywood ever really goes to plan: what with egos, greed, racism, etc. playing major/minor/collaborative parts. All the more to cheer about what did end up on the screen.\n\nRobert Ryan, in the role of his life (his personal favorite, BTW) plays his age (or roughly thereabouts), as 39-year-old Stoker Thompson, a once promising contender, now an over-the-hill pugilist, desperately looking to score that last big bout. It’s rough going because the pots they talk about in this small-time mirror of big-time sports hover around the $50 range (or about $650 today). Worse, his manager and trainer are two lowlife scumbags, who, unbeknownst to Stoke, have sold him out to the local crime boss (another small fish, perfectly christened Little Boy). They didn’t bother to tell him, since they figure their used up meal ticket will get creamed anyway. Well, that and he has that thing in the Sweet Smell of Success chided as “integrity.” In short, he won’t take a fall (so why ask him?).\n\nJulie, Stoker’s wife, a still young and attractive, but worn weary spouse loves him to death; however, she can’t take the heartbreak of this final bout, as she too suspects he might not make it.\n\nIt all unfolds in the ironically dubbed hamlet of Paradise City – the worst of the worst America has to offer (and that’s saying plenty). Julie, determined to wait it out elsewhere can’t even walk down the sidewalk without being hit on. Fortunately, she can verbally pummel a dirt bag as well as Stoke can have an opponent kiss the canvas (or once could have).\n\nStoke’s discovery of being betrayed by his so-called friends is gut-wrenching. It’s a psychological tour de force performance by Ryan. And it matches that final and surprising brutal ring battle. His climactic facing the thugs who bet against him is as ferocious a capper as any noir title could hope for.\n\nMany consider this Wise’s best work. He certainly was (rightly) proud of it. RKO was in upheaval at the time, being raped and ravaged by new owner Howard Hughes. THE SET-UP was Wise’s final movie on his nine pic RKO contract; he was champing at the bit to bolt, and was determined that this last project turn out right (“All I wanted to do was get that picture made and get out of RKO…I got the chance…and then I escaped.”). Helping the director run interference was nominal producer Dore Schary (uncredited), who, likewise scrammed after THE SET-UP wrapped.\n\nHughes, in fact, never helped a picture get what it deserved, and, often ruined the chances his studio had to make it a winner. Think of Tesla as a movie company.\n\nWhat he did do was antagonize the competition. The same year as THE SET-UP, UA released Champion. Both movies were well received, but the latter went through the roof, box-office-wise. Hughes poked the bear by suing for plagiarism. Armed with a battalion of high-priced mouthpieces, he won, but UA turned the tables and out-promoted the picture – ultimately losing the battle but winning the war. Insult to injury: THE SET-UP should have made Ryan an A-list top thesp; it didn’t, but Champion transformed Kirk Douglas into a post-war superstar.\n\nThe screenplay by Art Cohn (a former sports writer, who knew and incorporated all the jargon; SET-UP is the first time I ever heard the word “fink.”) was based on a 1928 poem by Joseph Moncure March. In the poem, the Stoker character, named Pansy Jones, is Black. He’s also not the loyal husband, but a bigamist. The bigamist angle was immediately eschewed, then the ethnicity. Hughes’s camp raged that there wasn’t a Black name who could carry a major motion-picture. Some RKO wags suggested newbie James Edwards, but Wise knew that Edwards was too young (he does appear in the pic as an up-and-comer, along with Darryl Hickman).\n\nWise thought Canada Lee, who actually was a former boxer, would be ideal, but Hughes nixed it (Lee is superb in 1947’s Body and Soul, reviewed in the previous column). Non-negotiable: the protagonist had to be white. This caused March to disassociate himself from the project. Even the sensational Audrey Totter (perhaps her best performance) was a second choice. Joan Blondell was originally thought to be the ideal Julie. Truth be told, her blowsy presence would have worked, but Totter’s old-before-her-time persona is (IMO) the far better choice.\n\nThe remainder of the cast comprises a veritable rogues gallery of noir essentials, including George Tobias and Percy Helton (as Stoker’s disreputable handlers), Alan Baxter (creepily slimy as Little Boy),\n\nWallace Ford, Phillip Pine, Herbert Anderson, Paul Dubov, Tommy Noonan, Harold J. Stone, and Bernard Gorcey. The accuracy and lip-biting violence of the ring sequences are greatly due to Ryan’s past as a boxer (undisputed champ at Dartmouth University) along with antagonist Hal Fieberling (later Hal Baylor); Baylor, too, was a former fighter\n\nIn fact, many of the bit parts and extra roles were filled by past “golden boys” (some now punch drunk). John Indrisano, who also chalked up many arena bouts, not only likewise appears in THE SET-UP, but served as the movie’s fight consultant.\n\nIt’s 100% Ryan’s and Wise’s show, the former bringing humanity to a character who would have been deemed “pathetic” in other less capable hands. Wise wisely utilized his past skills as an editor to guide the movie to victory. At 72 minutes (played out in real time – a rarity during this period with Hitchcock’s Rope, released a year earlier, being the only recent example), THE SET-UP is a textbook example of how a feature film should be cut (Wise began as an editor, and filmed the fights from numerous angles. Unsatisfied with the studio’s cutters, the director put on his former hat, and cut the pic himself – his final editing gig). Add the magnificent camerawork by Milton Krasner, and you have all the ingredients for stunning cinema verse (albeit a tarnished tawdry one). Further accentuating the pragmatic feel of THE SET-UP is lack of a background score. The titles and action unspool over audio of crowds screaming for blood, round bells, and grubby city sounds.\n\nThe Warner Archive High Definition remaster of THE SET-UP is (dare I say?) a knockout. It never looked or sounded better than in this near-pristine 35MM transfer. As a nifty extra, Warners has included vintage audio commentary by Wise and Martin Scorsese (apt, as THE SET-UP is one of the Raging Bull director’s cherished screen favorites).\n\nA must-have for all noir fans, let alone anyone who wants to experience one of the movies’s most brilliant lead performances, plus overall expert filmmaking by artists at the top of their game.\n\nTHE SET-UP.

Additionally, more than any other genre, noir has had the greatest number of offshoots; indeed, there is show biz noir, romance noir – even horror and western noir. But perhaps the winner of this contest is sports noir, specifically in the arena of boxing. Likely due to the fisticuffs world’s penchant for lowlifes, losers, slinky babes, and evil fixers this sub-genre took off during the post-war years, and continued well into the early 1960s. While there had been a plethora of boxing pics prior to WWII, none had the adult punch of mean street cynicism that leeched on to blood and sweat stained inhabitants until the mid-late 1940s. The pic that started it all was 1947’s BODY AND SOUL, now on restored High Definition Blu-Ray, from the promoters at Olive Films/Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nLike the characters on-screen, the off-screen machinations of those involved matched the narrative’s residents for pure adrenalin and sheer determination and enthusiasm (the shady aspect may have been not as apparent, although nefarious factions were certainly in play, and would soon rear their ugly heads).\n\nThe story/screenplay, as written by Abraham Polonsky (featuring some knockout dialog exchanges like this one: “What are you going to do, kill me? EVERYBODY dies!”), and directed by Robert Rossen, chronicles the rise of ghetto denizen Charley Davis. Charley, a fairly decent guy, lives with and supports his widowed mom (his father being a collateral damage victim of gangland violence), and is blessed with the companionship of Peg Born, the kind of girl next door every serious dude dreams of. Charley’s also no fool, and while not a rocket scientist does possess an over-abundance of street wisdom…and a temper. This proves to be his way out – and, ultimately, his downfall. Spotted by the mob contingent, Charley is groomed for the big time as a boxer. His personality, looks, and what they used to call “moxie” has him soaring to the top of his game – at a great cost.\n\nSuccess goes to his head with more devastating results than a hammer punch to the skull. And the pug-turned-thug loves it. The money, the power, the ability to intimidate and strike fear…all of this melds with his handlers’s agenda. Even Peg becomes a victim when replaced by smoking hot reptilian Alice.\n\nBut, as Charley eventually learns, selling your body and soul has a gruesome price. And his final gasp to regain his decency is one of the most riveting and lip-biting last acts in cinema history.\n\nThe movie, of course, stars John Garfield, in what many consider his most iconic role. Garfield is genuinely terrific, but his participation didn’t end on-camera. BODY AND SOUL was the actor’s first starring movie produced for his new independent company, Enterprise Studios (co-founded with David Loew and Charles Einfeld). While the outfit lasted a mere three years, it nevertheless produced an amazing array of great motion-pictures; LSS, there’s rarely a dud in the bunch.\n\nPractically all involved with Enterprise were liberal progressives – a congregation that earned disdain from the many Hollywood moguls. Ironically, the one who hated the company (and its projects) most was Louis B. Mayer – ironic, as MGM became the distributor for the Enterprise output (once UA ditched the company, after the failure of the rather expensive 1948 drama Arch of Triumph). Mayer cringed but was unable to do much, due to his diminishing authority at the studio – plus the fact that the pics were receiving major critical kudos, and (often) doing smash box-office. So, FU, LB!\n\nIt all came tumbling down when HUAC invaded the industry with a vengeance. As an example of what I’m talking about, Garfield, Rossen, Polonsky, and costars Anne Revere and Lloyd Gough (here billed as “Goff”) were all blacklisted. The traumatic effect undoubtedly led to the young star’s death in 1951, at age 39.\n\nGarfield was very careful and quite brilliant in choosing his collaborators. Polonsky, who would soon helm an even greater Garfield noir for Enterprise (Force of Evil), pulled out all the script stops, boldly going where no man (post-Code) had gone before. A sly gay liaison is inserted when the vicious mob kingpin, Roberts, introduces his slimy bodyguard. “He’s with me,” proudly mouths the gang boss…to which Charley nuzzles Peg and responds, “She’s with me.” Aside from those mentioned, BODY AND SOUL features the phenomenal James Wong Howe as cinematographer (the d.p. had earlier done a Metro boxing flick with Robert Taylor, where he filmed the fight scenes with a hand-held rig on roller skates – a feat repeated here !) appended by an excellent score from Hugo Friedhofer. Other noir participants flexed their muscles on BODY AND SOUL including future directors Robert Aldrich (as a.d), and Joseph Pevney (as a costar). Supporting Garfield up on the big screen were Lilli Palmer (outstanding as Peg), William Conrad (another top noir alumnus), Canada Lee, James Burke, Virginia Gregg, Milton Kibbee, Sid Melton, Cyril Ring, Tim Ryan, Art Smith, George Tyne, and the drop-dead gorgeous Hazel Brooks as slithery Alice (who does everything but shed her skin on-camera).\n\nThe recent 1080p platter of BODY AND SOUL looks and sounds sensational. It’s nice to know that the Enterprise library has been kept in fine condition.\n\nBODY AND SOUL. Black and white. Full frame [1.33:1; 1080p High Definition]; 2.0 DTS-HD MA.

Truth be told, THE PARADINE CASE is not a bad movie, just not a great one. Hitchcock certainly did disown it for a variety of reasons. It was the last picture on his Selznick contract, a servitude he was particularly anxious to be rid of (Hitch had already begun proceedings with Sidney Bernstein to partner in their own production company, the initial title to be Rope). What made the picture a special kind of Hell was the fact that the oft intolerable David O. Selznick (who thought his very being as God’s gift to humanity) ultimately deigned his psyche the only one who could do justice to Robert Hichens’s scandalous novel (after rejecting James Bridie’s initial draft). Screenplay by the Producer heralds an especially bold in-your-face main credit. Selznick may have been many things, but a writer wasn’t one of them; the fact that his memos oft equaled the page numbers of Gone with the Wind doesn’t count. Hitchcock knew his name would be associated with the pic’s failings, so he and wife Alma (Reville) did work on the adaptation (and, reportedly, first draft). Even at the eleventh hour, it still didn’t pass muster, and an uncredited Ben Hecht (likely demanded by Hitchcock) was brought in to do a dialog touch-up.\n\nThe project itself was one of Hitch’s no-nos: a trial movie (albeit a lascivious one). Recent widow Maddalene Anna Paradine, an unabashed beauty, is arrested for the murder of her older, blind and fabulously wealthy husband – a British war hero. Her famed attorney, Sir Simon Flaquer, feels ill equipped to handle such a task, and suggests to her that she engage Anthony Keane, an iconic criminal trial barrister. Engage she does, as does he. The middle-aged master of his game, with full support of his stunning spouse, begins to do background checks on the lady and possible suspects – soon falling head over heels in love with her. The Hitchcock obsession theme surfaces here, as does his fear of police, depicted via Ms. Paradine’s first night in stir – an iron jail door clanging shut with a sound boost rivaling a bomb burst.\n\nAs Keane falls deeper into the darkness of forbidden love (along with some disturbing revelations about his client), he fights his anguish over the traumatic situation (he still loves his wife, and she him). Insult to injury, a mean girl verbal bitch slap by the accused to the smitten defense attorney in public court is genuinely devastating (for him and for viewers).\n\nThe production – one Hitchcock wanted to glide through – unfortunately, due to Selznick’s constant interference, seemed to go on forever (92 days!). Fans often display stills of Hitch’s frustration on-set, looking totally bored as underlining proof of his displeasure with the project. In actuality, Hitchcock often looked unimpressed during filming, considering it a mere formality; for him, the creative fun was in pre-production – planning out the shots in storyboard, and devising interesting (if not landmark) techniques for picture and sound.\n\nBut a constant hands-on Selznick involvement just made it worse. It began with the casting. Hitchcock and Selznick did agree on either Laurence Olivier or Ronald Colman for Keane, and Ingrid Bergman for the widow Paradine. Olivier and Colman were both busy on other pictures (Hamlet, A Double Life), and Bergman – at last free of her Selznick contract – rightly wanted nothing more to do with him. The producer decided to “discover” a new Bergman, and cast Italian actress Alida Valli in the role. A decent thesp, she nonetheless exhibited nothing of the passion Bergman could bring to the part. She’s a total ice princess – a demeanor that apparently spilled off screen into real life. LSS, she never caught on with Anglo audiences (save memorably in The Third Man, where, like in PARADINE, the cold detached persona sort of worked).\n\nAs for Keane, they went with gray-temple dyed Gregory Peck. Peck always chided this pic as a misfire, claiming he was way too young, even with the midlife crisis makeup. Plus, his lack of a British accent stuck out like a sore thumb. That said, he’s really very good in the part – enough so that these Peckish bumps rarely deter the narrative. Another no-show was Robert Newton, whom Hitchcock requested as the accused murderess’s illicit lover – a stable master, whom the director thought would immediately convince audiences of “a man [who] really reeked of manure.” This didn’t sit well with Selznick and Newton proved unavailable anyway, so the part was rewritten as a French-Canadian personal valet to Mr. Paradine, and became the debut of Louis Jourdan (who’s excellent in it).\n\nThe remainder of the cast is top line, and comprises Charles Coburn (as Sir Simon), Charles Laughton (as a sex pervert judge, salivating at Keane’s wife’s bare shoulders!),\n\nEthel Barrymore, Leo G. Carroll, Isabel Elsom, John Williams, Lumsden Hare, Lester Matthews, Edgar Norton, Joan Tetzel, and Ann Todd (the latter two deservedly capturing the plethora of the positive reviews in the overall lukewarm received final product).\n\nThat said, Selznick’s famous quote that there’s only “first class and no class” rings true as well. All the additional key positions on the pic are primo, including cinematography (Lee Garmes) and music (Franz Waxman). The producer, furthermore, pulled out all the promotional stops, primarily utilizing simultaneous big city first-run playdates (an unusual move at the time), and having the principals hawking an exceptionally large amount of movie tie-in consumer items.\n\nReaders may be stunned to know that the flop result of THE PARADINE CASE didn’t entirely hover over poor attendance (actually, movie fans did turn out…just not enough). Amazingly, it ultimately cost as much to make as the producer’s Gone with the Wind. This encompassed a full-scale replica of the Old Bailey, at a 1947 cost of over $400,000.00 alone!\n\nA lot of film was shot. A LOT. The first cut ran over three hours; Selznick chopped out a half-hour, then another twenty minutes, before finally releasing the general release 110-minute version. Viewers were a bit confused by preview cut critics who thought Ethel Barrymore warranted an Oscar (she received a nomination). Her finest moments, including drunken and psychotic emoting ended up on the editing room floor (reducing her total screen time to about three minutes). The chance of ever seeing the complete version literally sunk – a celluloid victim of a 1980 vault flood.\n\nIt’s, thus, astounding that any of THE PARADINE CASE makes sense, but it miraculously does. If one didn’t know it was a Hitchcock pic, one would hail it as a fairly entertaining racy highbrow post-war crime drama. Of course, as far as I’m concerned, there IS no such thing as a bad Hitchcock movie, with even the lesser examples being superior to most anything else out there.\n\nThis recently restored 1080p rendition of THE PARADINE CASE is wonderful, audio and video-wise. Even better, this is a 125-minute cut, and not the usual hour and fifty minute version that played in most theaters since 1947 (and then on television). A number of great audio extras include commentaries by Hitchcock authors Stephen Rebello and Bill Krohn, clips from the director’s 1966 interview with Francois Truffaut, plus a conversation between the director and Peter Bogdanovich. There’s also a 1949 radio adaptation featuring Valli, Jourdan, with Joseph Cotten, in the Peck role.\n\nA “hey, why does everybody say this is so bad?” rediscovery, this edition of THE PARADINE CASE certainly at least rates an “oh, yeah, that one” spot on your Hitchcock/classic movie shelf.\n\nTHE PARADINE CASE.

SRP: $29.95.\n\nFEBRUARY IS ALFRED HITCHCOCK MONTH\n\nOne of the most bizarre comedies ever made, 1931’s RICH AND STRANGE certainly lives up to its title. Cherry on top: it’s directed by someone (whom at first glance) you’d least expect: Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nWe said “at first glance,” as, once one becomes acquainted with the leads and the plot, it’s very much a Hitchcock picture. Indeed, the director’s comedies are certainly weird enough to be categorized as Hitch and Strange, and we offer up as proof of evidence 1928’s The Farmer’s Wife and 1955’s The Trouble with Harry (with 1941’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith as the most sane of the bunch). This pic, scripted by the director, wife Alma Reville, and Val Valentine (from a novel by Dale Collins) provides viewers with an overview of the failing (due to boredom) marriage of the The Hills. He’s stuck in a mundane office job that the opening montage correctly pegs as lethally dull (think Vidor’s The Crowd as a wicked comedy). She’s trying to make ends meet by doing freelance seamstress work out of their barely middle-class digs. “The best place for us is the gas oven,” quips Fred to spouse Emily, quite seriously. She informs him that this might not be possible as the bill is past due.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, news arrives that for a change is good. A cool, wealthy relative has decided that his nephew shouldn’t have to wait until he’s dead to enjoy a considerable inheritance.\n\nWith a hefty cash flow, the Hills kiss Britain goodbye, and embark on a posh vacation around the world. Where many pics would happily end here, this one begins – a freakish visual interpretation of the famed cliché “Don’t wish so hard for something.”\n\nA cruise aboard a luxury liner is a delight for Em, but a nightmare for Fred, who spends most of the voyage cabin-bound with the worst case ever of mal de mer.\n\nWhilst biding her time, Emily chances upon decent, upright (and up tight) Commander Gordon. Soon, her presence (and desires) unravel his veddy British values (you can practically hear the steel rod fall out of his butt and clank on deck). And an adulterous shipboard romance commences.\n\nFred, meantime, hasn’t been idle. Now over his seasickness, he becomes enamored of and with a vampy package of royalty, known only as The Princess. And an adulterous shipboard romance commences.\n\nHow each relationship progresses, rises, falls, and rises…makes up the remainder of RICH AND STRANGE in numerous adult ways (even a contemporary U.S. pre-Code would have difficulty competing with these protagonists and antagonists), some shocking, most of them witty. Hitchcock himself stated that the more humorous events of the trip, including the eccentrics encountered, often resembled his and Alma’s honeymoon (leave us not forget that “Fred” is not that far distanced from “Alfred”). The upshot is that RICH AND STRANGE became one of the director’s personal favorite works (along with The Trouble with Harry and Shadow of a Doubt). The sexual adventures perfectly meld with the big action set pieces – notably a jaw-dropping shipwreck that prefigures the finale of Foreign Correspondent. Did we mention Chinese pirates? They’re here, too. In fact, their participation in the narrative became one of Hitch’s snarky private beloved cinema moments: the hungry Hills scarfing down local cuisine, followed by a tanker’s captain stretching the skin of their adopted cat on the steamer’s wall.\n\nThe movie itself was a lavish affair, filmed in part on location in Port Said, Egypt. Two d.p.s, Jack Cox and Charles Martin handled the camerawork, with Adolph Hallis supplying the score. The cast is uniformly excellent, and features Henry Kendall as Fred, Joan Barry (who “dubbed” Anny Ondra in Blackmail) as Emily, Percy Marmont (as Commander Gordon), Betty Amann (as The Princess), and Elsie Randolph, Arty Ash, Aubrey Dexter, Hannah Jones, and Bill Shine completing the thesp lineup.\n\nThe unanticipated surprise of RICH AND STRANGE was its disastrous performance at the box-office, reportedly almost bankrupting BIP. Even the American release, publicizing the action over the comedy and sexual shenanigans, under the title East of Shanghai didn’t help. It tanked in the U.S. as well. British International, who praised the young director to the soundstage rafters now condemned him. His next assignment was Number 17, a sixty-minute potboiler done on the cheap. Hitch was then let go, a dumb move on BIP’s part, as he resounded with a bang via 1934’s The Man Who Knew Too Much, a mammoth hit for Gaumont-British that paved the way for his brilliant and phenomenally successful future.\n\nI first saw RICH AND STRANGE in the 1970s on my local PBS station. I couldn’t understand the flak, as I loved it. Nice to know that, like Vertigo and Marnie – two other pics originally sloughed off in the States – it is now gaining momentum.\n\nThe Kino-Lorber Studio Classics/Studio Canal rendition of RICH AND STRANGE is another of their terrific recent re-masters – this one hailing from a 4K restoration by the BFI. Extras include an audio interview with Hitch and Francois Truffaut, and a trailer gallery of other Hitchcock Kino releases.\n\nAn underrated black comedic travelogue, RICH AND STRANGE provides a superb movie experience for those who like their humor with a plethora of macabre twists.\n\nRICH AND STRANGE.

Police arrive, one woman is dead, the other in a trance and covered in blood Easy-peasy, case closed, right? Hell, no! This is Hitchcock month, so you know there’s gonna be a tantalizing labyrinth of movie thriller detours. And, so there are – beautifully restored in the recent Kino-Lorber/Studio Canal Blu-ray remaster of MURDER!\n\nReleased in 1930, shortly after the Master of Suspense made movie history with Blackmail, MURDER! arrived via a script by no less than Alma Reville (Mrs. Hitchcock), adapted by Walter Mycroft and Mr. Hitchcock from the play Enter Sir John by Clemence Dane (aka, Winifred Ashton) and Helen Simpson.\n\nDiana Baring, the traumatized thesp in question, is holed up in the gaol whilst the conflicted jury decide her fate. Key amongst the twelve men and women is Sir John Menier, a celebrated actor/writer/producer. Although arguing for her acquittal, he is goaded by the group to vote “guilty,” a sequence that serves as a mini-12 Angry Men precursor…in reverse.\n\nNo sooner is Baring sentenced to death than Sir John has second thoughts. To rectify his haunting remorse, the knighted board-trodder initiates his own investigation, utilizing other members of theater companies, including the one the “murderess” was part of.\n\nAs indicated, the twisty narrative takes more turns than the L.A. freeway, as Sir John’s unorthodox methods reveal some lurid details about all involved, including multiple sexual liaisons and transvestism – which prove key to solving the mystery.\n\nTaking the technical baton from Blackmail, Hitchcock further raises filmsound to a new level; MURDER! becomes the first movie to use stream of consciousness – not merely as a gimmick, but to guide its protagonist, ably portrayed by Herbert Marshall (his second talkie after costarring in the 1929 version of The Letter, opposite Jeanne Eagels; fun fact: he would also appear in the more famous 1940 Bette Davis remake, but in a different role), to the truth.\n\nA number of eccentric characters (typical of Hitchcockian society) are sprinkled throughout the excellent cast, comprising Edward Chapman, Phyllis Konstam, Miles Mander, Esme Percy, Donald Calthrop, Esme V. Chaplin, Amy Brandon Thomas, Joynson Powell, S.J. Warmington, Marie Wright, Hannah Jones, Una O’Connor, and Norah Baring (as Diana…Baring)\n\nWhile MURDER! is another fine restoration, especially in regard to the visuals of Jack Cox, the audio – so long nearly inaudible (thanks to decades of lousy pd copies) still tends to lean toward occasional muffled bass. It is nevertheless superior to any version yet made available (with the bacon-frying crackle all removed).\n\nAdmittedly not top-drawer Hitchcock, MURDER!, after more than 90 years, continues to fascinate due to its adult narrative, fine acting, and innovative cinematic expertise. Hitchcock admitted the lofty pic’s failings to Francois Truffaut in the French director’s landmark book-length interview: “…it was an interesting film and was quite successful in London. But it was too sophisticated for the provinces.” It also violated his preference for suspense over surprise; he actually hated whodunits (a la Agatha Christie), championing the “how” and “why” factors instead.\n\nExtras include an alternate ending, and a Hitchcock/Truffaut audio clip. But the best supplement remains the rarest. Before dubbing and bottom-frame subtitles were a common thing, early talkies were filmed in a variety of languages, each encompassing an appropriate country cast. The general rule for this brief, expensive period was to shoot an English-language pic in German, French, Italian, and Spanish. Only one copy of the German version is known to exist. Entitled MARY, it is included on this disc with new English subtitles. What makes it important is that is was also directed by Hitchcock. Featuring an A-list Teutonic cast, MARY, made a year later, is actually more fluid in camera movement (also by Cox), demonstrating how quickly talking picture technology was improving. It is also more streamlined, coming in at 78 minutes, as opposed to MURDER!‘s 102 minute duration. Since this is likely the only surviving print, it is understandably nowhere near as pristine as MURDER! That said, it’s a unique and amazing experience in its own right.\n\nThe wonderful actor Alfred Abel essays the role of Sir John, with Paul Graetz, Lotte Stein, Ekkhard Arendt, John Mylong, Louis Ralph, Hermine Sterler, Frtiz Alberti, Else Schnunzel, and Julius Brandt in support; Anglos Esme Chaplin and Miles Mander reprise their roles from the 1930 pic. The title character, here called Mary Baring, while certainly a crucial part of the scenario, is not exactly a demanding part; this mirrors the British rendition by Norah Baring. She basically has to look shell-shocked, then quietly polite during her brief subsequent scenes in stir.\n\nWhat makes the German interpretation of Baring stand out in MARY is the fact that the actress playing her is far more intriguing than the fictional woman. Olga Tschechowa portrays Mary, and she is not only one of cinema’s most notorious denizens, but world history’s. A liar, cheat, scoundrel, definitive femme fatale and possible spy, Tschechowa made Mata Hari look like Ma Perkins. Fleeing the Russian Revolution with her family in 1917 (after supposed teenage trysts with none other than Rasputin), Tschechowa landed in Berlin less than two years after the end of the Great War. Tschechowa’s gorgeous looks immediately found her work as a model, then an actress. She proved sensational in both, becoming famous in pictures like Murneau’s Haunted Castle (1921). Seemingly every man (and likely several women) wanted to bed her, most prominently rising political figure Adolf Hitler. After 1933, Hitler, Goering, and Goebbels were all romantically linked to her, with Der Fuhrer, not suprisingly, winning out (she became Queen of Reichstag film or what ever farkakte title they chose to bestow upon her). The fact that the true love of her life was ex-husband and iconic supporting actor/teacher Michael Chekhov (who ran off with another ravishing actress) proved problematic, as he was Jewish (he would play Ingrid Bergman’s mentor in Hitchcock’s 1945 classic Spellbound). While Tschechowa moved heaven and earth to keep their daughter safe, she nevertheless did little to prevent her other family members from being interred in concentration camps. Footage of her cavorting with Hitler at parties and theater galas became nauseatingly prevalent throughout the late 1930s. After the war, she claimed she was a double agent, an out given credence by her safe brief relocation into Berlin’s Russian zone. Still later, she was rumored to be Stalin’s lover before finally (after his demise) moving back to Germany, where she filmed movies and television shows sporadically up until her death in 1980. Her final words, uttered with a Cheshire cat smile on her face, were: Life is beautiful. Her beauty in MARY is undeniable, her story incredible. Hate to digress in a piece devoted to Hitchcock, but, truly, WTF!?\n\nMURDER!/MARY. Black and white. Full frame [1.37: 1]; 2.0 DTS-HD MA. English and German w/English subtitles.

SRP: $29.95.\n\nFEBRUARY IS ALFRED HITCHCOCK MONTH\n\nAs has been the case during the past few years, I hereby give myself a month-long birthday gift by celebrating Blu-Ray releases of my favorite director Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nSome terrific choices on view for ’24, starting off with 1929’s BLACKMAIL (available through Kino-Lorber Studio Classics/Studio Canal), Hitch’s first sound flick, and, equally important, the UK’s initial talking picture. So, yeah, a big prestige project for the British film industry, and (as usual) the already famed director didn’t disappoint.\n\nWith few ways to film a sound feature at his disposal, Hitchcock nevertheless discovered a myriad of methods to NOT make it a stodgy, stilted affair. There are many innovative and inventive uses of sound that work with the visuals, as opposed to the (then) rival output where image and audio seemingly competed against each other.\n\nIn BLACKMAIL, as scripted by the director along with Benn Levy and flicker fledgling Michael Powell (from a play by soon-to-be Hitchcock favorite Charles Bennett), we have an adult-themed story that could play virtually intact nearly a century later.\n\nAlice White, a fun-loving young woman from a family of shopkeepers is dating the decent, but often dull police detective Frank Webber. She’s obviously striving for a more “hands on” relationship (and we mean that in every sense of the word); in 1920’s speak, she’d definitely be pegged as “a modern.”\n\nUnbeknownst to Webber, Alice has caught the eye of a bohemian artist (he is never named). She fakes illness at a restaurant to cut a date short, then skips off with the bad boy…to see his etchings. Unbeknownst to Ms. White, Frank sees his gf and her “pal” happily vanish into the night.\n\nAt his flat, the artist convinces Alice to model for him in a sexy rig, which she does. The true intentions soon boil to a frenzy when the liaison rapidly turns into a rape. All does not go to plan for the sleazy painter, however, as the defiant woman grabs a convenient bread knife and just-as-conveniently puts a permanent end to the dirt bag’s predatory ways.\n\nUnbeknownst (a key word in this movie) to her, Tracy, a cohort of the deceased’s, has been watching the events unfold from outside the artist’s digs, and quickly realizes a way to turn his voyeurism into an unending payday.\n\nTraumatized by the events, the sexual assault victim staggers home, and retreats to bed – only to be awakened by the news of the brutal, local murder. Worse, boyfriend Frank has been assigned to the case – a bad situation made more unbearable by his discovery of one of Alice’s gloves at the crime scene.\n\nHis visitation to the White’s shop/apartment coincides with the blackmailer’s, and, thus, begins a riveting game of cat-and-mice. A smashing climax using the director’s penchant for landmark locations prefigures the Statue of Liberty in Saboteur and Mount Rushmore in North by Northwest, as BLACKMAIL wraps up during a thrilling chase through and atop the British Museum.\n\nBLACKMAIL was a triumph on all counts, when released on October 6, 1929. The use of sound was prominently hailed as some of the best yet in cinema. And indeed it is. An opening wherein the detectives, led by Frank, capture and book a thief is a perfect, gripping intro.\n\nMusic and background sound is layered over the action footage, shot as a silent for fluidity. A bigger audio breakthrough comes later when a devastated Alice attempts to have a normal meal with her family. The usual small talk is muffled, with the exception of the oft repeated word “knife.”\n\nPerhaps the most ingenious use of sound was done behind-the-scenes. Polish-French-Czech-Austrian-German actress/singer Anny Ondra (who had already proved herself admirably in the director’s 1928 stunner The Manxman) was cast as the veddy British Alice, but couldn’t get the proper linguistics right, hampered by her thick foreign accent. Contrary to Singin’ in the Rain‘s Debbie Reynolds or Downton Abbey: A New Era‘s Michelle Dockery, it was Hitch who came up with the first on-set dubbing session. Ondra mouthed English phonetically while British thesp Joan Barry spoke off camera into a mike. Crude by today’s standards, but a technical milestone in 1929.\n\nThe cast, supporting Ondra is quite wonderful, and comprises John Longden (as Frank), Cyril Ritchard (Broadway’s future celebrated Captain Hook, as the artist), Donald Calthrop (as Tracy), Percy Parsons (as the opening sequence’s crook), plus Charles Paton and Sara Allgood (as Alice’s parents), Hannah Jones, Harvey Braben, and actual ex-Det. Sgt. Bishop.\n\nWe must note that this recent 1080p restoration is another knockout – one of a series of outstanding UK Hitchcock remasters that Kino-Lorber has magnanimously bestowed upon us collectors. It looks and sounds aces. Top BIP cameraman Jack Cox (whom the director used frequently) would be proud. There’s even an original score (a rarity in this for a non-musical), composed by Jimmy Campbell, Reginald Connelly and Hubert Bath.\n\nNumerous extras are accessible in this must-have two-disc set, including commentary by Tim Lucas, an audio Hitchcock interview with Francois Truffaut, and Ms. Ondra’s very inappropriate sound screen test, wherein Hitchcock quizzes the giggling actress about her sexual proclivities.\n\nBest of all, however, are TWO additional cuts of the movie – one an intermediary version, and, another, the concurrently filmed shorter (78 minutes vs. 85 minutes) silent version – sadly maligned and ignored.\n\nNaturally, on the outset, one would have little interest in a silent version of the first Hitchcock talking picture. But this is an incorrect assumption. It is, in many ways (other than the obvious), an entirely different experience. Of course, the iconic “knife” audio segment is absent, relying far more on Alice’s imagining London’s moving neon tableau of poured champagne transformed into stabbing kitchen ware. Most of all, without the prime factor of sound (save the new excellent score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra), we focus more on the performances – specifically that of Ondra, whose psychological breakdown as a sexual assault victim is nothing short of realistic and first-rate. Without the silent version, one might wonder why they just didn’t cast a British performer, even with Ondra’s then-considerable credits. With the silent edition, it’s easy to see why. She’s a great actress, whose harrowing, touching, and deservedly angry portrayal remains a towering achievement that (IMO) few actresses could have ascended to in 1929, let alone 2024.\n\nA peak example of dual silent and silent-to-sound transition filmmaking, BLACKMAIL merits a key spot on every collector’s shelf.\n\nBLACKMAIL.

SRP: $29.95.\n\nThe complete Nazi takeover, kicking what was left of the reasonable German populace in the teeth after the 1933 elections, prompted many a local astute observer of the human condition to realize that it was time to get out of Dodge. Young Billy Wilder, who had already proven himself as a rising UFA talent to be reckoned with, more than saw the writing on the wall – especially since it was written in blood. Desperately trying in vain to convince his parents to flee with him to safety (they pooh-poohed him, choosing not to believe the most severe of the horror stories floating through Deutschland and/or thinking the extremities of the new Party in power would boil over; both perished in the Holocaust), Wilder high-tailed it to France – a detour stopping off point for emigres seeking asylum in America. While awaiting for his ship passage to the States (it would take more than a year, and then he would be detoured again – this time in Mexico – until proper or improper channels could be convinced/connived for entry into the U.S.; a lion’s share of these experiences would be chronicled in his excellent 1941 screenplay, Hold Back the Dawn), Wilder hooked up with a plethora of other young filmmakers – writers, directors, composers, cinematographers, mostly, like himself, of German-Jewish origin…and they began a creative kaffeeklatsch. For Billy, this comprised his first official directing credit – the remarkable 1934 “action-comedy,” MAUVAISE GRAINE (Bad Seed), now part of a two-feature homage to the brilliant director/writer: FRENCH REVELATIONS, available in exceptional Blu-Ray restorations from Flicker Alley/Blackhawk Films.\n\nAs indicated, Billy Wilder did not spend his layover time in France idling around, MAUVAISE GRAINE being the physical result. Wilder, who shared codirecting duties with Alexander Esway, and, coscripting credits with Jan Lustig, Max Kolpe, and Claude-Andre Puget is nevertheless the one who truly shines here. Anyone familiar with his later, more celebrated work, will instantly identify the many Wilderisms liberally painted across this fetching cinematic canvas.\n\nThe plot focuses on Henri Pasquier, a pampered, rich kid (in his twenties), who pisses away money like a night in a beer garden. His one true love (well, aside from himself) is his custom-made deluxe automobile. And, yes, truth be told, it IS a doozy – a 1934 Doozy. Suffice to say, like anything else he touches, he carelessly wrecks it. He and his drunken buddies pull into a posh repair station and while there, the spoiled brat eyes another customer – the gorgeous Jeannette, who has likewise pulled up in a fancy-schmanzy ride with her sugar daddy. Henri immediately sidles up to her, and hits on the woman. “Is that your car?,” she asks. Yep, and there’s plenty more where that came from. They make a date, and M. Pasquier happily staggers home to get papa to write a check for the damage.\n\nAlas, pater has had enough, and is cutting off junior from any further unnecessary expenditures. No repair money, in fact – no car. “Sell it!,” demands papa. “And think about getting a job.” This near-coronary-inducing turnabout causes the spoiled manchild to think about his future. Well, his future that afternoon. He wants to “date” Jeanette, and can’t show up without wheels – and glam wheels at that. So he decides to steal a car. Unfortunately, the luxurious sedan he chooses has been staked out by a professional den of auto-thieves, who track him to the romantic rendezvous. Jeanette is quite excited, until the gang descends upon them. Then, she’s ecstatic! You see, she’s part of the crook cartel – stealing high-priced cars and re-selling them. That sugar daddy Henri initially eyed the hottie with was her latest score. And the garage is their headquarters.\n\nRather than kill the schmuck, they weigh the pros and cons…especially the cons. Seems like he’s a good gang prospect, so the wily leader offers him a job. And the bum takes it.\n\nRooming with another young scoundrel – who turns out to be his Jeanette’s brother – makes him curb his lascivious verbal lust for the femme fatale whom he nonetheless now wants more than ever.\n\nDo Henri and Jeanette ever get together? Will they see the light of their evil ways? And, if so, can they possibly escape the clutches of the greedy, villainous gang? These pressing questions and more are answered throughout the duration of this fast-moving delight’s 78-minute duration.\n\nThe early surprise of Jeanette’s identity is a moment that undoubtedly Phylllis Dietrichson would savor. It’s key Billy. Throughout his career, a Wilder rule on creating female characters was eloquently chiseled in his snarky mind: If She’s Not a Whore, She’s a Bore! He (reportedly) even had a banner heralding the phrase over his office desk.\n\nThe cast is perfect, and features Pierre Mingand (as Henri), and, in one of her first starring roles (in a career spanning nearly eighty years, until her death in 2017!), 17-year-old Danielle Darrieux. Supporting the two leads are Raymond Galle, Paul Escoffier, Michel Duran, Jean Wall, Marcel Maupi, Paul Vesla, and Gaby Hertier.\n\nThe dialog is often wonderful, the overall direction inventive and even unique. Critics rediscovering this gem have correctly pegged the POV moving camera in actual locations (including Paris and Marseille) a twenty-five-year precursor to the French New Wave movement. The cinematography itself is often stunning, a nod being in order to Paul Cotteret, Maurice Delattre, and Fritz Mandl. Add a sprightly score by Allan Gray and future maestro Franz Waxman (the latter also waiting for a visa) and all the ingredients for a fun movie ride are in place.\n\nAlthough a disclaimer precedes the program apologizing for the quality of some of the 16MM dupe footage, there is really no need. The new 1080p High Definition master of MAUVAIS GRAINE is tiptop, in picture and sound. Audio commentary by UCLA Film Professor Jan-Christopher Horak is accessible as an extra, but die hard Wilder buffs will be more than elated to discover the joys of this diamond-in-the-rough for themselves.\n\nAs mentioned above while awaiting safe passage to America, Wilder was constantly keeping busy. When not actually working on a movie, he was enthusiastically checking out the competition – a practice also fervently utilized by Alfred Hitchcock. What was hot, what was selling, what was the next big thing?\n\nKey to this strategic research was the 1935 French farce, FANFARE D’AMOUR (Fanfare of Love), an immensely popular musical comedy. The plot: two down and out musicians, on the verge of starving to death, make a drastic move by disguising themselves as women, and joining an all-girl orchestra. Sound familiar? The movie is a stunner, to be sure – and while certainly nowhere near the classic status of Some Like it Hot, does follow the Wilder mantra: take a good idea, make it better, and roll with it. Indeed, the plot and memory of this movie was reverberating in Wilder’s head since his early Paramount directing days, when he energetically pondered reworking this scenario for Hope and Crosby. But is Some Like it Hot an actual remake? Ardent film buffs who quizzed Wilder on it were met with verbal hostility. He seethed that he took a basic theme, and went entirely in a different direction. Outside of the gender bender, there were no similarities whatsoever. While not questioning Billy’s genius, he’s not exactly being honest.\n\nThe Hot segment where the orchestra travels to Florida by train is also in FANFARE (when the girls are booked at a more climate-friendly resort). While not as funny, there are some other Hot comparisons.\n\nThe Osgood character doesn’t exist in the French version; however, the male hotel booking agent does get the passion vibes for the Lemmon character, here called Pierre. It should also be mentioned that Pierre is a more vicious, vengeful and unpleasant reluctant drag queen. While he also wants to romance the Sugar character (aka Gaby), Pierre is also being pursued by her BFF, Poupette. Also Sugar herself (sorry, Gaby) has no real function, except to be beautiful (which, arguably, she is). There is no quirkiness, funny or endearing kooky quality about her. In short, she’s a bland mannequin. Most prominently, the great “danger” subplot – where the boys aren’t merely hungry – but targeted by murderous gangsters is totally absent, removing much of the comedic suspense, thrills, and entertainment.\n\nThe one main plus of FANFARE is additionally making the Tony Curtis character, Jean, a composer. This leads to an early montage, where before cross-dressing, the boys join various other combos, including a gypsy band, a Latin band, and a Black jazz band – all featuring ethnic variations of a tune he penned. Other than that, FANFARE can’t come anywhere close to Hot. And, at 115 minutes, it really does go on too long – another example where the gangster sidebar could have moved the narrative.\n\nFANFARE D’AMOUR is breezily directed by Richard Poittier, and scripted by Robert Thoeren, Michael Logan, Max Bronnet, Pierre Prevert, and Rene Punjol. The stars were definitely engaging and comprised Fernand Gravey (as Jean), Betty Stockfeld (as Gaby), Julien Carette (as Pierre), Gaby Basset (as Poupette), and Madeleine Guitty, Pierre Larquey, Jacques Louvigny, Palau, Henri Vilbert, Jane Lamy, Adrienne Trenkel, and Irene De Strozzi. The sensation this pic made internationally put its male lead briefly on the Gravey train. His timing is excellent, both physically and in dialog delivery. He was snapped up by Hollywood, and tossed into dreary vehicles (The King and the Chorus Girl, Fools for Scandal) that gave him no opportunity to display either of these traits (his best known American appearance is probably in the bloated 1938 MGM musical bio-pic The Great Waltz, where he plays Johann Strauss).\n\nOnce again, the visual quality of FANFARE gets a disclaimer from Flicker Alley/Blackhawk Films. Once again, it really is unnecessary, as it looks and sounds (in French with English subtitles), just fine – giving Jean Bachelet’s photography and Joe Hajos’s score a nice picture-and-sound treat for Anglo viewers. Filmmaker August Ventura offers audio commentary, but again, I suggest checking this out for oneself to do the Billy pluses and minuses. I must once more reiterate that the legendary writer/director became apoplectic whenever this title was mentioned: “The genesis of the idea was a very low-budget, very third-class German picture, FANFARE OF LOVE…[The two male leads] dress up to go into a female band. But there was not one other thing that came from this terrible picture…Absolutely terrible. Deliriously bad.” A strange reaction, as Wilder isn’t even crediting the 1935 French original, but a 1951 German remake. LSS, the ’35 FANFARE is a pleasant diversion, while Hot remains an hilarious all-time masterpiece.\n\nBut don’t go by me, see for yourself. After all, nobody’s perfect.\n\nFRENCH REVELATIONS.
