        "text": "THIS LIST IS NOW SUPERSEDED BY THE 2.0 VERSION OF THE LIST, WHICH YOU CAN FIND HERE.\n\nWith only one director left to go (and if you haven’t figured out who it is, you’re not paying attention), this is a good time to throw up the complete list. I’ve gone ahead and provided links to all the directors, as well as listing what particular film I decided to focus on. It was not always necessarily their best film, but rather the one I wanted to write about.\n\nThe first thing is, if there is a director here you were expecting to see and didn’t see them, you can go back to my Introduction, where I mention various directors who didn’t make the list and why.\n\nSecond, I will probably do a revision of this list sometime after the Oscars. Because cumulative awards points are one of the categories I have used to make this list, I will re-calculate everyone after the awards season has concluded. Also, in December, TSPDT re-does their list (they do it annually) and I will also be changing some point totals based on those re-calculations.\n\nThird, almost certainly at some point, some younger directors will start to make the list. Sofia Coppola finally has a fourth film in post-production, and unless it’s a complete disaster, she will be making a future version of the list. Several other directors who were mentioned in the Intro still haven’t made a fourth film and at least three of them have just come out with their third films this year, but they will probably make a future version (those include Joe Wright, Stephen Daldry, Rob Marshall and Spike Jonze). If I have someone who moves up the list, I will do an individual post for that director, with whatever rank they have acheived, and then will re-list all the ranks in the next February re-calculation.\n\nBut that’s it for now.
