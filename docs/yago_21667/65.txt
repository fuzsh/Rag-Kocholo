Three Wise Fools is notable as an early high-profile role for the then-up and coming William Haines. Haines would later recall that he felt distracted by the top hat he wears in the film and, as a result, felt that his performance was terrible. However, his performance received positive notices in contemporary reviews, and Haines was offered a choice of four new film roles after the film's success. Claude Gillingwater was the only cast member from the original 1918 Broadway play.

It showed in Germany at the Union-Theater Nollendorf, Berlin, on 10 November 1924. The cinema was built in 1913 by Joe Goldsoll, who was president of Goldwyn Pictures from 1922-1924.
