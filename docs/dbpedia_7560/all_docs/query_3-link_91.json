In ÃerkezkÃ¶y, the chance of a wet day over the course of May is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 17% and ending it at 15%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 28% on December 20, and its lowest chance is 6% on July 29.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during May in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is essentially constant, remaining about 1.1 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.1 inches or falling below 0.2 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of May in ÃerkezkÃ¶y, the length of the day is increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 56 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 1 minute, 52 seconds, and weekly increase of 13 minutes, 7 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is May 1, with 14 hours, 1 minute of daylight and the longest day is May 31, with 14 hours, 57 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is 6:05 AM on May 1 and the earliest sunrise is 28 minutes earlier at 5:37 AM on May 31.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 8:05 PM on May 1 and the latest sunset is 29 minutes later at 8:34 PM on May 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in ÃerkezkÃ¶y during 2024.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:34 AM and sets 15 hours, 10 minutes later, at 8:44 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:30 AM and sets 9 hours, 12 minutes later, at 5:42 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in May in ÃerkezkÃ¶y\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in May in ÃerkezkÃ¶yMay112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMAprJunApr 89:22 PMApr 89:22 PMApr 242:50 AMApr 242:50 AMMay 86:23 AMMay 86:23 AMMay 234:54 PMMay 234:54 PMJun 63:38 PMJun 63:38 PMJun 224:09 AMJun 224:09 AM6:25 AM6:25 AM7:31 PM7:31 PM7:38 PM7:38 PM6:14 AM6:14 AM5:46 AM5:46 AM9:01 PM9:01 PM8:46 PM8:46 PM5:47 AM5:47 AM4:57 AM4:57 AM9:07 PM9:07 PM8:45 PM8:45 PM5:19 AM5:19 AM\n\nMay 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 50%2:35 AMESE12:00 PMWSW-7:17 AMS232,866 mi 2 42%3:09 AMESE1:16 PMWSW-8:12 AMS230,474 mi 3 30%3:37 AMESE2:33 PMWSW-9:04 AMS228,368 mi 4 20%4:02 AME3:49 PMW-9:54 AMS226,746 mi 5 11%4:26 AME5:05 PMW-10:43 AMS225,814 mi 6 4%4:50 AME6:22 PMWNW-11:32 AMS225,744 mi 7 1%5:16 AMENE7:41 PMWNW-12:24 PMS226,636 mi 8 0%5:46 AMENE9:01 PMWNW-1:18 PMS228,485 mi 9 2%6:22 AMENE10:17 PMNW-2:15 PMS231,169 mi 10 7%7:07 AMNE11:27 PMNW-3:14 PMS234,461 mi 11 14%8:00 AMNE--4:13 PMS238,063 mi 12 23%-12:25 AMNW9:02 AMNE5:10 PMS241,657 mi 13 32%-1:12 AMNW10:08 AMNE6:02 PMS244,948 mi 14 42%-1:48 AMWNW11:15 AMENE6:50 PMS247,700 mi 15 50%-2:17 AMWNW12:20 PMENE7:34 PMS249,747 mi 16 62%-2:41 AMWNW1:23 PMENE8:15 PMS250,997 mi 17 71%-3:01 AMWNW2:24 PME8:54 PMS251,430 mi 18 79%-3:20 AMW3:24 PME9:33 PMS251,088 mi 19 87%-3:38 AMW4:24 PME10:12 PMS250,063 mi 20 93%-3:57 AMW5:26 PMESE10:53 PMS248,484 mi 21 97%-4:18 AMWSW6:30 PMESE11:36 PMS246,503 mi 22 99%-4:41 AMWSW7:37 PMESE-- 23 100%-5:10 AMWSW8:46 PMSE12:24 AMS244,277 mi 24 100%-5:47 AMSW9:54 PMSE1:16 AMS241,952 mi 25 98%-6:33 AMSW10:56 PMSE2:13 AMS239,655 mi 26 94%-7:30 AMSW11:51 PMSE3:13 AMS237,478 mi 27 87%-8:37 AMSW-4:14 AMS235,478 mi 28 78%12:35 AMSE9:51 AMWSW-5:13 AMS233,683 mi 29 68%1:11 AMESE11:06 AMWSW-6:08 AMS232,108 mi 30 50%1:41 AMESE12:21 PMWSW-7:00 AMS230,772 mi 31 45%2:06 AMESE1:36 PMW-7:50 AMS229,713 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is essentially constant during May, remaining within 1% of 1% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 4, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 34% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is gradually decreasing during May, decreasing from 8.1 miles per hour to 7.4 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on February 3, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.0 miles per hour, while on June 1, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.4 miles per hour.\n\nThe wind direction in ÃerkezkÃ¶y during May is predominantly out of the north from May 1 to May 2 and the east from May 2 to May 31.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nÃerkezkÃ¶y is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is rapidly increasing during May, rising by 10Â°F, from 55Â°F to 66Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in ÃerkezkÃ¶y typically lasts for 8.1 months (247 days), from around March 24 to around November 26, rarely starting before March 3 or after April 13, and rarely ending before November 3 or after December 21.\n\nThe month of May in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in May in ÃerkezkÃ¶y\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in ÃerkezkÃ¶y are increasing during May, increasing by 305Â°F, from 175Â°F to 480Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in ÃerkezkÃ¶y is gradually increasing during May, rising by 0.9 kWh, from 6.2 kWh to 7.1 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of ÃerkezkÃ¶y are 41.286 deg latitude, 27.999 deg longitude, and 538 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of ÃerkezkÃ¶y contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 292 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 555 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (696 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (3,471 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of ÃerkezkÃ¶y is covered by artificial surfaces (45%) and cropland (40%), within 10 miles by cropland (50%) and trees (38%), and within 50 miles by water (42%) and cropland (31%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in ÃerkezkÃ¶y, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in ÃerkezkÃ¶y.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and ÃerkezkÃ¶y according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at ÃerkezkÃ¶y is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between ÃerkezkÃ¶y and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nIstanbul AtatÃ¼rk Airport (LTBA, 50%, 48 mi, southeast, -377 ft elevation change)\n\nBandÄ±rma Airport (LTBG, 31%, 67 mi, south, -371 ft elevation change)\n\nBurgas Airport (LBBG, 19%, 92 mi, north, -404 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of ÃerkezkÃ¶y and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
