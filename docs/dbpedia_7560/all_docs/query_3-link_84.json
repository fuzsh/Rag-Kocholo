        "text": "Our 29th President of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Prof. Dr. Mustafa Şentop, Tekirdağ Governor Recep Soytürk, Tekirdağ Members of Parliament Nurten Yontar, İlhami Özcan Aygun and Cem Avşar, Çerkezköy District Governor Nazmi Günlü, Çerkezköy Mayor Vahap Akay, TOBB Board Member and Tekirdağ TSO Board Chairman Cengiz Günay, our Chamber's Board Chairman Ahmet Çetin, Çerkezköy Organized Industrial Zone Board Chairman Eyüp Sözdinler, our Assembly Chairman Hacı Mehmet Erdoğan, Board Members, Chamber, Exchange and OSB Presidents of our provinces and districts, Institution Managers, NGO Representatives, Industrialists, our Members and Invited Guests attended our Opening Ceremony with great enthusiasm.\n\nOur Industrial Fair, which was held with a high level of participation, is an important platform for exhibiting innovative technologies, products, and services by bringing together leading companies in our region and country's industrial and commercial world. Many sectors such as automotive, machinery, electronics, cosmetics, textiles, services, food, pharmaceuticals, energy, and technology are represented here. This shows that the Çerkezköy Industrial Fair appeals to businesses and visitors in a wide range. The Çerkezköy Industrial Fair brings you together to support economic growth, nationalization of intermediate products, companies in the region to get to know each other and establish a strong supply chain, and create new business agreements. Many of our companies have signed new business agreements during the time spent at our fair. Being instrumental in this is a source of pride and happiness for us. Our fair, which contributes to the development of companies with new business agreements, also contributes to the development of the region and the increase in employment.\n\nReferring to the activities of our Chamber, our Chairman Ahmet Çetin said, \"Since the first day we took office, we have always set goals that can be achieved for the development of our region, especially for our members. We said that the tradesman, industrialist, and merchant will win together. As the Çerkezköy Chamber of Commerce and Industry, we have increased the number of trainings that will contribute to our members' personal and business lives. We hosted foreign business people in our Chamber and enabled them to communicate with our companies in the region. We laid the foundations of our education foundation. One of our goals here is to bring a 4-year technical university that is worthy of this great production base. We have included many innovations in our Chamber within the scope of digital transformation. We have created a system where all our members can obtain the documents they need in the digital environment from Saray to Veliköy. We have enabled our members and tradesmen to get K-type authorization certificates and digital licenses from our Chamber, relieving them of a great burden. After Namık Kemal University, we also signed a cooperation protocol with Marmara University. We are confident that we will sign successful projects with both of our universities for the development of our region. Success is not the final destination but an ongoing journey. We are working and will continue to work for the development of our region, the increase in our members' earnings, and a sustainable and more livable city.\"\n\nStating that the border lines drawn for Çerkezköy are now too narrow for itself, our Chairman Ahmet Çetin said, \"Our region, which is a production base, is an important part of the economic growth in our country and Çerkezköy, which is the preferred destination of foreign business people and the center of attraction of the country, must reach the level to respond to the demands with new investments. The most effective and clear solution to this is for Çerkezköy to become a province. Tekirdağ ranks 6th in terms of contribution to gross national product. Our members of the Çerkezköy Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Çerkezköy, Kapaklı, and Saray constitute 53% of this contribution. 48% of the 183,039 people working in industry in Tekirdağ are employed by the industry in our region, which is the production base of our country. And again, Çerkezköy, Kapaklı, and Saray are among the top ranks in this field with a growth rate of 5% not only in Tekirdağ but also in the country. The rise that will be achieved with the district's becoming a province will add value upon value to our country's economy and industry. Our region, which hosts dozens of leading companies from many different sectors, whose brand value goes beyond the borders of our country and is talked about in the international arena, is also among us today.\"\n\nOur Chairman Ahmet Çetin, who expressed his pride in our companies that are members of the Turkish Exporters Assembly, which is among the first 1000 companies, said, \"Another source of pride for us here today is our member companies that continue their investments, provide development and employment, and most importantly, add value to our country's economy, which are among Turkey's largest exporters. We are proud of all our companies that are among Turkey's largest exporters and thank them.\" After Chairman Ahmet Çetin's speech, Çerkezköy Mayor Vahap Akay, Çerkezköy OSB Board Chairman Eyüp Sözdinler, TOBB Board Member and Tekirdağ TSO Chairman Cengiz Günay, our 29th President of the Turkish Grand National Assembly Mustafa Şentop, and Tekirdağ Governor Recep Soytürk made their speeches in turn. After the opening speeches, our Chairman Ahmet Çetin presented the Kanuni Cam Sword gift to our 29th President of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Prof. Dr. Mustafa Şentop. Then, our members who are among the first 1000 companies of the Turkish Exporters Assembly were awarded by our Protocol. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, our visitors visited the booths of our participating companies."
