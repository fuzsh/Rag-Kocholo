        "text": "5 Minutes\n\nManagement systems are essential in business, evident from the documents companies share on their websites, showcasing certifications such as Quality Management System (ISO 9001), Information Security Management System (ISO 27001), Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001), Business Continuity Management System (ISO 22301), etc. These documents, prepared with international standard codes and logos of auditing organizations, serve as the public face of companies, demonstrating that their work is carried out in accordance with international standards, sometimes to prove compliance with legal obligations. The Energy Management System (EnMS), referred to as ISO 50001 with its main standard and subcategories, is a management system that has emerged with a similar concept. Essentially, it is the documented form of saying, \"We track, control, and report our energy consumption within a standard.\" Similar to other management systems, the Energy Management System follows a systematic structure called the \"PDCA\" cycle, where Planning, Doing, Checking, and Acting steps are applied in sequence, bringing together all processes related to energy in our facilities. The Energy Management System, ISO 50001, like all other management systems, starts with commitment from the top executives of companies, systematically addressing the current situation, making business shares according to the goals set, taking actions or measures based on the defined goals, collecting results, evaluating them, and continuously applying this cycle until it is internalized by each employee and turned into a routine. While the goal of management systems is continuous monitoring, control, and improvement, in practical applications, apart from audit times that occur once or twice a year, we cannot see a real working systematic. The main reasons for this are that the relevant responsible employees primarily have other duties in different operations, the intensity of their routine tasks, and their duties in management systems essentially remain on paper. There is some validity to these reasons. Not fulfilling the requirements of the job or only meeting them during audit times has a cost in other management systems, but in the case of an Energy Management System, there are heavy costs such as high bills, penalties, and wasted resources every second the system is not in operation. For this reason, ISO 50001 Energy Management System consultants recommend Digital Energy Management Systems that go beyond static monitoring, providing the opportunity to control real-time energy consumption, allowing for instant comparisons with machines themselves or similar machines, departments, floors, sections, and/or other similar facilities, creating limits and alarms that provide a proactive approach, and allowing predictions for machine health, product quality, or energy consumption in the future. While your factory, office, shopping mall, or hospital employees perform their essential operational activities, Digital Energy Management Systems handle real-time energy management on their behalf. These systems automatically send reports to the top management at hourly, weekly, monthly, yearly, or three-year intervals and detect anomalies if a machine or device has consumed electricity or energy outside the normal operation during the past period, notifying the relevant parties and even shutting down the machine if desired. Taking a step further, Digital Energy Management Systems: • Continuously query the tariff for the electricity you purchase, providing suggestions for more cost-effective purchases. • Control the energy consumption of all the machines and devices in your entire inventory, starting from transformers, and provide warnings and suggestions regarding their efficiency. • Solve problems such as compensation; identify the machine causing reactive consumption, take preventive measures on the machine long before the panel, and maximize your facility's energy quality. • Create statistical models with energy consumption, temperature, pressure, etc., and production parameters affecting production, providing benefits to find production parameters that will consume less energy while maintaining the same quality. • Simultaneously manage renewable energy production systems such as solar power plants on the same platform. • Manage many applications such as indoor air quality, predictive maintenance, etc., on the same platform. • Calculate your carbon footprint per product or box, clearly show the energy cost of the order, provide warnings for carbon taxation, and give you a competitive advantage by calculating the energy costs of the product accurately. We don't know the competitor digital energy management systems, but Lumian Internet of Things Energy Platform is a platform that lightens the load of its users, is open to continuous development, and allows you to quickly develop any application you need on it without writing code. You can track and report all processes related to energy in your facilities through a single software. We will continue to keep you informed.

Here are some common types of electricity tariffs widely used in Turkey: 1. Standard Tariff: Consumers receiving energy from the assigned Distribution Company as Transmission System Users use the standard tariff, which is the most basic electricity consumption tariff. Consumers pay for the consumed electricity at a specific unit price. This tariff is applicable to both residential users and businesses. Terms like \"night\", \"day\" and \"peak\" in electricity purchasing refer to hours of electricity consumption and different unit prices applied during these hours. These terms are associated with tariffs offered by electricity suppliers or distribution companies. Night (Off-Peak): \"Night\" or \"off-peak\" hours typically refer to the time between midnight and early morning. Electricity demand during these hours is generally lower due to most people sleeping and minimal industrial production activities. Therefore, consumers using electricity during these hours pay a lower unit price. Peak (Puant): \"Puant\" hours usually represent the hours with the highest electricity demand during the day, indicating intense demand on the electricity grid. Electricity costs are highest during these hours, especially for large industrial facilities and businesses consuming energy intensively. These terms aim to explain time-based pricing within electricity tariffs, offering consumers the opportunity to manage their electricity consumption at a lower cost. Electricity suppliers can encourage energy savings and demand management by offering different unit prices during different time intervals. 2. Distribution System Users: Users of the distribution system pay bills based on two different tariffs. Customers who own transformers and those without transformers are billed according to the medium voltage (Orta Gerilim) and low voltage (Alçak Gerilim) tariffs, respectively. The subscriber groups are as follows: A. Industrial B. Public and Other Services Sector C. Residential D. Agricultural Activities E. Lighting Consumers Receiving Energy from Private Suppliers System Usage Tariffs Users with medium voltage connections can adjust their electricity bills by choosing between double-term or single-term subscriptions, paying power fees, excess power fees, and distribution fees at different unit prices. Users with low voltage connections can calculate their bills based on a single term only, depending on their appropriate subscriber group: J. Industrial K. Public and Other Services Sector (30 kWh/day and below) L. Public and Other Services Sector (30 kWh/day and above) M. Residential (8 kWh/day and below) N. Residential (8 kWh/day and above) O. Families of Martyrs and Combatant Disabled Veterans P. Agricultural Activities Q. Lighting R. General Lighting 3. Renewable Energy Tariffs: Some suppliers offer special tariffs for consumers who prefer electricity generated from renewable energy sources. These tariffs aim to support environmentally friendly energy sources. 4. Business-Specific Tariffs: There are tariffs specifically designed for businesses. Various tariffs are offered based on the consumption habits and needs of businesses. Lumian supply agreements offer customers very special tariff and unit price advantages. All these tariffs are offered by electricity suppliers and distribution companies and can be chosen based on consumer preferences. Consumers can select the most suitable electricity tariff by considering their consumption habits and budgets. Since electricity tariffs and prices can change from time to time, it is important for consumers to have regular access to updated information. In Turkey, energy consumption and bill calculation occur as follows: 1. Consumption Amount (kWh): The most significant component of energy consumption is the amount of electricity consumed by the consumer. Electricity meters are read at specified intervals, determining the amount of electricity used in kilowatt-hours (kWh). 2. Tariff: The consumer selects a tariff offered by the energy supplier. Tariffs may vary based on consumer consumption habits and preferences. Tariffs may include different unit prices based on hours and consumption amounts. 3. Unit Prices: Within the selected tariff, unit prices for each consumed kilowatt-hour (kWh) are determined. These unit prices can vary depending on the features of the tariff and the consumption hours. For example, if electricity consumption is done during off-peak hours, lower unit prices may apply, while higher unit prices may be charged during peak hours. 4. Subscription Fee: Subscribers pay a subscription fee to benefit from energy supply services. The subscription fee is collected to cover the costs of providing the service and maintaining the infrastructure. 5. Distribution Fee: There is a distribution fee paid to the distribution company for the maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure used for electricity distribution. This fee is calculated based on the consumption amount. 6. Taxes and Funds: Turkey Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) fee, municipal fund, etc., are taxes or fees that make up a portion of electricity bills. 7. VAT (Value Added Tax): Value Added Tax (VAT) is added to electricity bills. The VAT rate is subject to the tax laws in effect in Turkey and is generally the standard VAT rate. The sum of all these components constitutes the consumer's electricity bill. Consumers can choose the most suitable tariff by considering their consumption habits and budgets. Tariff and pricing policies can vary depending on the energy supplier and region, so it is important for consumers to have access to up-to-date information regularly.\"\n\n12 Minutes\n\nIn Turkey, natural gas bills can vary based on consumption quantity and distribution region. Generally, the following components are essential in calculating natural gas bills: 1. Consumption Quantity (Sm³): The main component of the natural gas bill is the amount of natural gas consumed by the user. Natural gas meters are read at specific intervals, and the consumed amount of natural gas is determined in cubic meters (Sm³) based on these readings. 2. Natural Gas Unit Price: The unit price of natural gas represents the price the user has to pay for each cubic meter (Sm³) consumed. This price is determined by the natural gas supplier or distribution company. The price may vary based on the distribution region and consumption tier. 3. Subscription Fee: Subscribers pay a subscription fee to benefit from natural gas services. The subscription fee is collected to cover the costs of service provision and infrastructure maintenance. 4. Distribution Fee: There is a distribution fee paid to the distribution company for maintaining and servicing the infrastructure used for natural gas distribution. This fee is calculated based on the consumption quantity. 5. VAT (Value Added Tax): Value Added Tax is added to natural gas bills. The VAT rate is subject to the tax laws in effect in Turkey, and typically, the standard VAT rate is applied. The natural gas bill is the sum of these components. Your natural gas bill may vary depending on your consumption habits and distribution company. Pricing policies are determined by your natural gas supplier or distribution company, so it is important for consumers to have access to up-to-date information. Monitoring your natural gas usage carefully is essential to understand your bill and to practice energy conservation. Free Consumer Sales Free Consumer: All consumers, excluding residential consumers, are considered free consumers. The threshold for becoming a free consumer for residential consumers is 75,000 Sm³. * The consumption quantity measured from a single meter will be considered for the free consumer limit. ** Billing will be done according to the consumption tiers mentioned above. 1.10.2023 itibariyle Kademe Birim Fiyatlar ₺/KWh ₺/m³ ST Çatalca1 İbadethane-Cemevi Kademe-1 Fiyatı 0,45594004 4,851202 ST Kademe-1 Konaklama (0-100.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,07688544 11,458061 ST Çatalca2 İbadethane-Cemevi Kademe-1 Fiyatı 0,40835705 4,344919 ST Kademe-1 Konaklama (100.001-300.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,02930245 10,951778 ST Kademe-2 GRF (300.000 Sm³ üzeri) Çatalca 1,0884501 11,581109 ST Kademe-1 (0-100.000 Sm³) Çatalca 0,87599267 9,320562 ST Kademe-1 (100.001-300.000 Sm³) Çatalca 0,82840968 8,814279 ST Kademe-2 (300.001-800.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,08685123 11,564097 ST Kademe-2 (800.000 Sm³ üzeri) Çatalca 1,08360583 11,529566 ST CNG (0-300 bin Sm³) 1,14205649 12,151481 ST CNG (300.000-800.000 Sm³) 1,0944735 11,645198 ST CNG (800.000 Sm³ üzeri) 1,0874907 11,570901 ST CNG (0-100.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,14205649 12,151481 ST CNG (100.001-300.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,0944735 11,645198 ST CNG (300.000 Sm³ üzeri) Çatalca 1,0874907 11,570901 ST Elektrik (0-100.000 Sm³) 1,20024136 12,770568 ST Elektrik (100.001-300.000 Sm³) 1,15265837 12,264285 ST Elektrik (300.001-800.000 Sm³) 1,14567557 12,189988 ST Elektrik (800.000 Sm³ üzeri) 1,14243017 12,155457 ST Elektrik (0-100.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,20024136 12,770568 ST Elektrik (100.001-300.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,15265837 12,264285 ST Elektrik (300.001-800.000 Sm³) Çatalca 1,14567557 12,189988 ST Elektrik (800.000 Sm³ üzeri) Çatalca 1,14243017 12,155457 ST Kademe-1 (0-300.000 Sm³) 0,87599267 9,320562 ST İbadethane-Cemevi Kademe-1 Fiyatı 0,45594004 4,851202 ST Kademe-1 Konaklama (0-300.000 Sm³) 1,07688544 11,458061 ST Kademe-2 (300.001-800.000 Sm³) 1,09383403 11,638394 ST Kademe-2 GRF (300.000 Sm³ üzeri) 1,0954329 11,655406 ST Kademe-2 (800.000 Sm³ üzeri) 1,08685123 11,564097 ST Abone[Konut] (75.001-800.000 Sm³) 0,45594004 4,851202 ST Abone[Konut] (800.000 Sm³ üzeri) 0,40137425 4,270622 ST Abone[Konut] Çatalca (75.001-100.000 Sm³) 0,45594004 4,851202 ST Abone[Konut] Çatalca (100.000 Sm³ üzeri) 0,40835705 4,344919 Excluding VAT Amount 1.

Independent consumers are individuals or legal entities with annual consumption exceeding the value determined by the Authority each year, allowing them to choose their suppliers. In the early years, a limited number of consumers gained the status of independent consumers. Over the years, as the freedom in the electricity market increased and the limit for independent consumers decreased, the number of independent consumers rapidly increased, and making all consumers independent is set as the ultimate goal. As the number of independent consumers has increased, the number of supply companies established to trade electricity and licensed by our Authority for this activity has also rapidly increased. The limit for independent consumers for the year 2022 was determined as an annual consumption of 1100 kWh and above by the Electricity Market Regulatory Board. This figure is reevaluated by the EMRA at the beginning of each year and is reduced as deemed appropriate. Residential subscribers who consume electricity exceeding the independent consumer limit in the previous calendar year or the current year can exercise their right to become independent consumers. Independent consumers, upon termination of their bilateral agreements or upon request, can purchase electricity and/or capacity within the scope of the last resort supply from the authorized supply company in their region (a company that sells electricity at approved tariffs to non-independent consumers/non-users of their right in the relevant distribution region, as approved by the Board). If consumers within the scope of independent consumers choose to exercise their right to select their supplier, it is mandatory to install electronic meters capable of performing multi-time measurements in compliance with the regulations published by the Authority. Meters that are not suitable for consumers are replaced by the distribution company within the relevant month, and the unsuitability of the meter does not prevent the exercise of the right to choose a supplier. Consumers can see whether they are independent consumers or not on the payment notification or invoices sent/left by the authorized supply company. The payment notification or invoices include the current year and the previous calendar year's consumption amounts for the subscription. If this amount exceeds the independent consumer limit determined by the Board for that year, it means you have the right to become an independent consumer. A residential consumer who has the right to become an independent consumer and wishes to exercise this right must sign a bilateral agreement with any of the licensed supply companies approved by our Authority. Bilateral agreements are commercial agreements made between individuals or legal entities according to private law provisions, regarding the purchase and sale of electricity and/or capacity, and are not subject to the approval of the Board. Licensed supply companies are listed on the EPDK website. These companies operate without any regional restrictions and engage in wholesale or retail sales activities to independent consumers. Consumers who want to exercise the right to become independent consumers should first check whether the company that wants to sell electricity is a licensed company. A contract proposal meeting the minimum conditions specified within the scope of the Subscription Agreements Regulation (ASY) in force under the Consumer Protection Law (TKHK) should be offered to residential subscribers. If there are issues not regulated in this contract, the regulations under the Electricity Market Consumer Services Regulation are applied. Subscription agreements with residential subscriber suppliers are signed based on the Subscription Agreements Regulation (ASY), which is based on the Consumer Protection Law (TKHK). When signing the Subscription Agreement, the Energy Procurement-Sale Notification Form/Information Form and, if any, the Commitment Form must be presented to the consumer for signature. The current retail sales contract can be terminated by the consumer by submitting the form in the form filled out by the consumer to the authorized supply company during the relevant month, as stated in the Subscription Agreement Form (ASY) te. The electricity of the consumer is not cut off due to the change of the supplier and the termination of the existing contract.
