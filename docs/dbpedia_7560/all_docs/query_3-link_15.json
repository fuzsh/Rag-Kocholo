        "text": "Important Note for the Drivers of Vehicles with Foreign Licence Plates that Will Use Tollways\n\nThe vehicles with foreign licence plates must register to OGS or HGS before using the tollways and must have sufficient credit in the account for pass. Turkish Custom Authorities will not allow the vehicles with foreign licence plates to leave the country if they have unpaid toll fines. Therefore, drivers should question if they have any unpaid toll fee, violation or toll fine from the Tollway Pass Violation Query section on the webpage www.kgm.gov.tr and pay the debts before arriving in the Customs to leave. For your further questions and complaints, apply to info@kgm.gov.tr\n\nWhat are the advantages of registering to OGS (Automatic Toll Collection System)?\n\nVehicle Classes\n\nVehicles are charged over 5 vehicle classes on bridges and motorways. Motorcycles can register to OGS as Class 1 vehicles. The users must have the OGS label compatible with their vehicle classes. Otherwise, OGS accounts of the users who do not have compatible labels with their vehicle classes will be blacklisted.\n\nClass 1 Vehicles\n\nClass 2 Vehicles\n\nClass 3 Vehicles\n\nClass 4 Vehicles\n\nClass 5 Vehicles\n\nOGS Registration of Heavy Vehicles\n\nOGS Registration of Heavy Vehicles such as Truck Tractor and Trailers\n\nBanks Providing OGS Service\n\nIs it necessary to have sufficient amount of money in OGS account?\n\nOGS Electronic (Active) Label (In-vehicle device)\n\nWhere should the OGS Electronic Label be attached in Various Vehicles?\n\nAudible Signals and Their Significations?\n\nWhere the auto-pass lanes are located?\n\nToll Plazas and Station Code Numbers?\n\nCan the OGS Label be used by more than one vehicles?\n\nHow to distinguish the Auto-Pass (OGS) Lanes?\n\nWhat are the significations of OGS toll side indicator messages?\n\nWhat is the signification of traffic pass lights in OGS?\n\nWhat is a standard OGS pass?\n\nWhich message appears on side indicators if OGS cannot read the electronic label?\n\nIn which cases the electronic label cannot be read/detected?\n\nWhich procedure is applied in case the OGS Label cannot be read at the entry toll gate?\n\nWhich procedure is applied to the drivers that use an electronic label that is not compatible with their vehicle class?\n\nWhere can the OGS labels be tested?\n\nCan the OGS lanes be used without an electronic label or with a label giving continuous pass violation warning?\n\nHow will the charging be if the passes are continuous when the electronic label is not attached to the vehicle or gives pass violation warning?\n\nWould having more than OGS labels in vehicle cause any problem?\n\nWhich procedure is applied if the user claims no responsibility for pass violation?\n\nWhich procedure is applied if the registration number formatted in the label and the number on the label are not identical?\n\nWhich procedure is applied to the users who pass without an electronic label or with a label that belongs to another vehicle?\n\nWhat is the blacklist?\n\nIn which cases the vehicle licence plate is photographed?\n\nWhich procedure is applied in case of OGS violation (pass violation)?\n\nHow can the users pay the toll fine (pass violation toll fine)?\n\nWhat are the issues to be taken into account when reporting OGS problems?\n\nWhat are the advantages of registering to OGS (Automatic Toll Collection System)? Top\n\nWith OGS, the pass is enabled without stopping. Toll collection on motorways and bridges is made through OGS (Automatic Toll Collection system/ Auto-Pass System) or HGS (Fast Pass System/High-Speed Toll System), cash payment is not accepted.\n\nClass 1 Vehicles Top\n\nVehicles with a wheelbase shorter than 3.20 metre are Class 1 vehicles.\n\nClass 2 Vehicles Top\n\nAll vehicles with 3.20 metre or longer wheelbase and 2 axles are Class 2 vehicles.\n\nClass 3 Vehicles Top\n\nAll vehicles with 3 axles are Class 3 vehicles.\n\nClass 4 Vehicles Top\n\nAll vehicles with 4 and 5 axles are Class 4 vehicles.\n\nClass 5 Vehicles Top\n\nVehicles such as lorries, trailers etc. With 6 or more axles are Class 5 vehicles.\n\nOGS Registration of Heavy Vehicles Top\n\nHeavy vehicles will obtain only one OGS label according to the maximum number of axles. If one of the axles is lifted during the pass, \"Smart Classification\" system will be activated and charging will be automatic according to the number of axles touching the ground.\n\nThe lorry in illustration must request a Class 3 OGS label from banks. If one of the axles is lifted during the pass, although the vehicle is Class 3, it will be charged as Class 2.\n\nOGS Registration of Heavy Vehicles such as Truck Tractor and Trailers Top\n\nAs OGS labels for vehicles such as lorries can be used with trailers and truck tractors, OGS labels for the total maximum number of axles of trailer and truck tractor must be requested from banks. In necessary situations, when axles are lifted during the pass, \"Smart Classification\" system will be activated, and charging will be automatic according to the number of axles touching the ground. Therefore, OGS users who obtain their labels according to the number of axles in their vehicles will not be in any financial loss.\n\nOGS labels of all truck tractors must be activated, read by toll collection systems at bridge-motorway entries and exit toll gates and give a beep signal. If the label cannot be read during entries and exits, drivers should not continue the passes.\n\nFor the vehicles consisting of trailers and truck tractors, only one OGS label will be obtained according to the maximum number of axles and the label will be registered on the licence plate of the trailer.\n\nA separate OGS label for the truck tractors will not be obtained, the licence plates of truck tractors will be registered by online accounts created by banks separately for the licence plates of truck tractors. These online accounts are necessary in case the OGS label is not detected by the system, in order for the truck tractors not to be charged with toll fine.\n\nIt is compulsory for all the truck tractors attached to trailers to be registered to the system and have an online account. KGM is not responsible for the toll fines caused by OGS passes of the trailers that does not have an online account.\n\nThe vehicle in illustration must request a Class 4 OGS label from banks. If one of the axles is lifted during the pass, although the vehicle is Class 4, it will be charged Class 3. If two axles are lifted, it will be charged as Class 2.\n\nThe vehicle in illustration must request a Class 4 OGS label from banks. If two axles are lifted during the pass, although the vehicle is Class 4, it will be charged as Class 3. If the lorry passes as trailer only, it will be charged as Class 2.\n\nA vehicle of this kind will be registered only on the trailer. Banks must create online OGS accounts for truck tractor licence plates and these plates must be registered in the account's licence plate section. In this case, as the licence plates are already registered in the system, there will not be any violation toll fine for the truck tractors and trailers if OGS labels are not detected by the system.\n\nBanks Providing OGS Service Top\n\nTo register to OGS, applications can be made through authorized bank branches or online banking.\n\nZiraat Bankası http://www.ziraatbank.com.tr\n\nVakıfbank http://www.vakifbank.com.tr\n\nİş Bankası http://www.isbank.com.tr\n\nDenizbank http://www.denizbank.com.tr\n\nGaranti Bankası http://www.garanti.com.tr\n\nBanks sell OGS labels for 40-60 Turkish Liras, which is determined by them. Guarantee period of the labels is also determined by banks. Guarantee period for OGS electronic labels of Garanti Bankası and Ziraat Bankası is 3 years, 4 years for İş Bankası and 5 years for Vakıfbank and Denizbank. Banks change labels that break down within guarantee period without any cost. If the warranty for broken labels is expired, a new label must be obtained.\n\nIs it necessary to have sufficient amount of money in OGS account? Top\n\nIt is compulsory to have sufficient amount of credit in OGS account to cover the toll. Therefore, giving an automatic payment order with credit cards for OGS accounts is highly important. Otherwise, the balance in OGS accounts has to be constantly followed. In the case of having insufficient or zero balance for the toll, the account will be suspended and blacklisted by the bank. After the account is suspended, toll fine for passes will be 5 times more than the toll amount.\n\nOGS Electronic (Active) Label (In-vehicle device) Top\n\nOGS electronic label is the most important component of the electronic toll collection system. Drivers who want to use auto-pass lanes must have a functioning electronic OGS label with a sufficient credit balance on the inner surface of their windshield.\n\nOGS electronic label works with a battery inside the device and it sends and receives information via antenna while passing the auto-pass lane. It records the entry information while passing the entry toll gates and charging is made by reading this information while passing the exit toll station. Electronic labels can read and record information and have an audible warning signal. While single beep usually means a successful pass, multiple beeps serve as a warning. If the device does not give a beep signal, it means it is broken or may be used falsely.\n\nOGS Electronic Label\n\nWhere should the OGS Electronic Label be attached in Various Vehicles Top\n\nOn non-athermic glass, the label can work everywhere and should be attached on the glass as shown in Figure-a:\n\nFigure-a\n\nThermal insulated windshields, which are called athermic glass, have been used with air-conditioned models of RENAULT Twingo, Clio, Megane serie (Sedan, Scenic, Coupe, Wagon), Laguna, Kangoo, BMW, Peugeot 206, 307, 406, OPEL Zafira, Vectra, CITROEN and MERCEDES starting from 98 models.\n\nIf your vehicle is one of these brands or models with athermic windshield, the label must be attached to the indicated parts of the glass. Otherwise, a pass violation warning will be received and drivers should avoid any pass violation.\n\nVehicle Brands and Models in which the OGS Label should be attached to the black area behind the rear view mirror (Figure 1 and Figure 2):\n\nRENAULT MEGANE SERIES, RENAULT SAFRANE, RENAULT LAGUNA, RENAULT SCENIC, RENAULT FLUENCE, RENAULT TWINGO, PEUGEOT 206, PEUGEOT 307, PEUGEOT 406, PEUGEOT PARTNER (2003 MODEL AND AFTER), FORD S-MAX, OPEL ZAFIRA, OPEL VECTRA, OPEL OMEGA, OPEL INSIGNIA, CITROEN PICASSO, CITROEN C1, CITROEN C3, CITROEN C4, CITROEN C5, CITROEN SAXO, FIAT SCUDO\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nVehicle Brands and Models in which the OGS Label should be attached to the transparent rectangular area at middle lower part of the windshield (Figure 3)\n\nRENAULT CLIO HB, RENAULT MASTER (2005 model and before), OPEL MOVANO MINIBUS (2003 model and after)\n\nFigure 3\n\nIn RENAULT KANGOO model vehicles (Figure 4- 2006 model and before) the label will be placed on one of the transparent square areas on the right and left side of the black spotted area, which is placed on the upper-middle part of the windshield. In 2007 model and after, the label can be placed on any side of the windshield.\n\nFigure 4\n\nMERCEDES 2006 MODEL AND AFTER: With Mercedes brand, the label can be attached to different parts of the windshield depending on the model and equipment of the vehicle. In some models, there are particular spots allocated for the label on the right side of the lower part of the windshield. Therefore, if the label cannot be read by the system, drivers should apply to the Main Control Center Chief Engineering Information Unit with their vehicles.\n\nLAND ROVER, RANGE ROVER, BMW (2006 MODEL AND AFTER), AND JEEP: The label will be attached to the transparent area on the upper-middle part of the windshield.\n\nNEOPLAN BUSES: The label can be attached to anywhere on the upper panoramic windscreen.\n\nMERCEDES VANEO AND AUDI A8: Some of these vehicles' windshields are completely covered with metal film. Driver should hold the label outside the vehicle.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The place to attach the OGS label may change according to the brand and model of the vehicle. Therefore, if the label cannot be read by the system from the place that it is attached, the driver should stop passes and apply to the Main Control Center Chief Engineering Information Unit as soon as possible.\n\nAudible Signals and Their Significations Top\n\nA single beep means that the pass is successful and four beeps mean that the credit in OGS account is insufficient. If the label does not give any voice signal while passing it indicates that the device is broken or misused. In this case, the label must be tested. Drivers should avoid passing with the broken label more than 10 times.\n\nWhere the auto-pass lanes are located?

Top\n\nElectronic label should be used only with the registered vehicle; namely, every vehicle must have its own/an individual OGS Label. Otherwise, if the label cannot be read/scanned by the system during the pass, a toll fine 4 times the toll will be charged along with the standard toll. In the case of vehicle change, the OGS account transfer transaction to the new vehicle must be made through bank branches, online banking or call centres of the bank that the old vehicle is registered (Ziraat Bankası, İş Bankası, Garanti Bankası, Denizbank, Vakıfbank or other banks that provide service for OGS registration).\n\nHow to distinguish the Auto-Pass (OGS) Lanes? Top\n\nIn order to benefit from the OGS system, the Auto-Pass lanes must be used for entering and exiting the motorway. The flashlight (flaşör) on the working Auto-Pass lane tollbooth fringes continuously flashes on and off in green colour. The OGS logo is at the top of the flashlight (Figure-5) Drivers should follow the rules about changing lanes for driving safety and 30km/h maximum speed limit indicated on the warning signs while coming close to the tollbooths. Drivers should remember that there may be vehicles stopping at the toll lanes, that these lanes are wide enough only for a single vehicle to pass, that they may have to change lanes or stop, and that there may be an automatic barrier.\n\nFigure 5\n\nWhat are the significations of OGS toll side indicator messages? Top\n\nGÜLE GÜLE (GOODBYE): Standard pass.\n\nKREDİ AZ! (INSUFFICIENT CREDIT!) : Credit amount in OGS account is insufficient. Driver has to put money into the OGS bank account.\n\nKAÇIŞ (PASS VIOLATION): Vehicle with an unreadable/non-detectable label or without a label. Do not continue the pass!\n\nKARA LST (BLACKLISTED): Blacklisted electronic label. Do not continue the pass!\n\nS. FARKLI (DIFFERENT CLASS): Vehicle class on the electronic label and detected by the Smart Classification System (OST) is different. Do not continue the pass!\n\nU DÖNÜŞÜ (U TURN): U Turn is made on the toll highway. If the entry and exit is made on the same highway, the longest distance toll will be charged.\n\nGİRİŞ YOK (NO ENTRY): Your electronic label has no entry toll gate information.\n\nSÜRE DOLU (TIME OUT): Allowed time on the toll highway is exceeded and the longest distance toll will be charged.\n\nTANIMSIZ (UNIDENTIFIED): Electronic label does not belong to OGS or broken. Do not continue the pass!\n\nWhat is the signification of traffic pass lights in OGS? Top\n\nYellow light means pass violation. Drivers should pay attention to this warning.\n\nGreen light means standard pass.\n\nWhat is a standard OGS pass? Top\n\n- If the electronic label and OGS has communicated normally and the label has recorded the entry toll gate information while passing, the label will give a single 'beep' signal. The traffic light on the left side of the exit toll gate will turn green.\n\n- OGS reads the recorded information by scanning the electronic label. If the scan is successful, the label gives a single 'beep' signal.\n\n- The class of the vehicle is defined.\n\n- Unlit traffic light turns green for a short period."
