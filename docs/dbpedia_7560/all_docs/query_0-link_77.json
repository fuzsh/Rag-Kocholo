Packaging gives the information required by the regulations.\n\nPublished in Chapter:\n\nPhysical Distribution Problems of Textile Companies in Turkey\n\nMurat Selim Selvi (Namik Kemal University, Turkey)\n\nCopyright: © 2016 |Pages: 19\n\nDOI: 10.4018/978-1-4666-9723-2.ch017\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this study is to discover what sort of similar and different problems textile companies face in physical distribution process and provide suggestions. The research includes only six textile companies operating in the Thrace region, Tekirdag province, Çorlu and Çerkezköy districts. This research is an exploratory study. The interview guide used in the paper includes open-ended questions focusing on certain issues. The data are coded systematically and direct quotations were provided in the descriptive analysis. The participants' own words were the units for analysis. Data triangulation and a chain of evidence can be mentioned in this regard. These points ensure the reliability and construct validity of the research. Findings indicate that companies make mistakes and errors in product stacking, product codification, and product description. In addition, storage spaces of companies are insufficient; warehouses cannot be managed well. Companies face many problems such as the imbalance arising from working on minimum-maximum stock, faulty orders, and packaging materials."
