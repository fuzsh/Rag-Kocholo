        "text": "For other places with the same name, see Turkey (disambiguation).\n\nTurkey (Turkish: Türkiye), officially the Republic of Türkiye (Türkiye Cumhuriyeti), is a bi-continental country: an oft-repeated cliché about Turkey is that it is the bridge between Europe and Asia. This is true not only geographically, but also culturally, and many Turks value their European and Asian identities equally. Therefore, Turkey is the ultimate \"exotic — but with a twist\" destination for many: plenty of travellers to the country will find a charming novelty in every corner, yet at the same time, will have a feel of comforting familiarity, regardless of which direction or how far they are arriving from. Add the Turks' legendary warmth towards the visitors to the mix, and you get the idea.\n\nFrom the dome-and-minaret filled skyline of Istanbul to the ancient ruins alongside the western and southern coasts, heavily indented against a craggy backdrop in Lycia and wide and sunny in Pamphylia, to the cold and remote mountains of the East, Turkey offers a wealth of destinations. Crazy \"foam parties\" in Bodrum running wild find their place with the Middle Eastern-flavoured cities of Southeastern Anatolia in the same country. The lush and misty mountains of the Eastern Black Sea are only a few hours away from the vast steppe landscapes of Central Anatolia. So there is something for everyone's taste — whether they are travelling on an extreme budget by hitchhiking or by a multi-million yacht.\n\nRegions\n\n[edit]\n\nAegean Turkey\n\nGreek and Roman ruins between the azure sea on one side and silvery olive groves on the other\n\nBlack Sea Turkey\n\nHeavily forested mountains offering great outdoor sports such as trekking and rafting\n\nCentral Anatolia\n\nTree-poor central steppes with the national capital, Hittite and Phrygian ruins, and moon-like Cappadocia\n\nEastern Anatolia\n\nHigh and mountainous eastern part with harsh winters.

Primarily Kurdish inhabited.\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\n— the capital of Turkey and its second largest city\n\n— the fastest growing city, hub to an array of beach resorts\n\n— a trendy coastal town in Southern Aegean which turns into a crowded city in season when it serves as a playground for Turkish and international holidaymakers alike, featuring a citadel, Roman ruins, trendy clubs and a number of villages surrounding the peninsula each with a different character from classy to rustic\n\n— the second capital of the Ottoman Empire\n\n— Turkey's largest city, the former capital of both the Ottoman and Byzantine Empires, and the only major city in the world to straddle two continents\n\n— Turkey's third largest city, hub to an array of beach resorts\n\n— a quite large city that is the heartland of mystic Sufi order, the site of Rumi's tomb, and with some elegant Seljuq architecture, all surrounded by vast steppes\n\n— the wonderful Sumela Monastery is just outside the city and it is a great gateway to exploring the Turkish Northeast\n\n— a city with beautiful architecture and extremely friendly locals at the gates of Eastern World; where Turkish, Kurdish, Arabic, and Assyrian cultures mingle\n\nOther destinations\n\n[edit]\n\n— the impressive ruins of the medieval Armenian capital, known as the city of a thousand churches\n\n— an area in the central highlands best known for its unique moon-like landscape (the \"fairy chimneys\"), underground cities, cave churches and houses carved in the rocks\n\n— the well-preserved ruins of a Graeco-Roman city on the west coast\n\n— the site of the 1915 Anzac landing and many WWI memorials\n\n— a UNESCO World Heritage site with ancient statues on its summit, affording a great panorama of its rugged surroundings\n\n— the incomparable postcard beauty of the \"Blue Lagoon\", perhaps the most iconic beach of Turkey\n\n— \"the Cotton Castle\", a white world of travertines cascading down in a series of shallow pools filled with thermal waters\n\n— a stunning monastery clinging on cliffs; a must-see on any trip to the northeast\n\n— a national park featuring school textbook belts of different types of forests varying with altitude, and the major winter sports resort of the country\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nCapital Ankara Currency Turkish lira (TRY) Population 85.3 million (2023) Electricity 230 volt / 50 hertz (Schuko, Europlug) Country code +90, +36 Time zone UTC+03:00, Europe/Istanbul, Asia/Istanbul Emergencies 112 (police, firefighter, gendarmerie, Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, Turkish Coast Guard, General Directorate of Forestry, traffic police), +212-177 (wildfire) Driving side right\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Hittites, Ancient Greece, Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Ottoman Empire\n\nThere is evidence that the bed of the Black Sea was once an inhabited plain before it was flooded in prehistoric times by rising sea levels. Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı), at 5,165 m (16,946 ft), is Turkey's highest point and the legendary landing place of Noah's Ark on the far eastern edge of the country. The area that is now Turkey has been part of many of the world's greatest empires throughout history. The city of Troy, famously destroyed by the Greeks in Homer's Illiad, has always been associated with the entrance to the Dardanelles strait in northwestern Anatolia. Subsequently, the area was to become part of the Roman Empire, and subsequently, the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the Roman Empire split into two, with the city of Constantinople (now Istanbul) as the regional capital, as well as the Eastern Roman capital after the split. The Ottoman Empire subsequently defeated the Eastern Roman Empire, and dominated the eastern Mediterranean, until its defeat by the Allies in World War I.\n\nThe Turkish Republic (Türkiye Cumhuriyeti) was founded in 1923 from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. Soon thereafter the country instituted secular laws to replace traditional religious fiats and instigated many other radical reforms to rapidly modernise the state. Changing from Arabic script to the 29-letter Turkish alphabet, based on the Roman alphabet, was one of many personal initiatives of the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Atatürk continues to be revered, and you can see his face gazing down on you or up into the distance in a fatherly, visionary or determined manner in many, many places around Turkey. Atatürk died in 1938 and was succeeded by his right-hand man, İsmet İnönü, who had been the first prime minister of the new republic. It was Inönü that boosted the cult of personality around Atatürk and who led Turkey for a longer time than his larger-than-life predecessor. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and became a member of NATO in 1952. In 2022, the Government of Turkey began using the Turkish spelling of the country's name, Türkiye, as the name of the country in English.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkey occupies a landmass just over 750,000 km2 (290,000 sq mi), more than double that of Germany and slightly more than Texas. In terms of the variety of terrain and particularly the diversity of its plant life, Turkey exhibits the characteristics of a small continent. There are, for example, some 10,000 plant species in the country (compared with some 13,000 in all of Europe) — one in three of which is endemic to Turkey. Indeed, there are more native plant species within Istanbul city limits (2,000) than in the whole of the United Kingdom. While many people know of Turkey's rich archaeological heritage, it possesses an equally valuable array of ecosystems — peat bogs, heathlands, steppes, and coastal plains. Turkey possesses many forests (about a quarter of the land) but, as importantly, some half of the country is a semi-natural landscape that has not been entirely remodelled by man.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile it may sound like a tourism brochure cliché, Turkey is really a curious mix of the west and the east — you may swear you were in a Balkan country or in Greece when in the northwestern and western parts of the country (except that Byzantine-influenced churches are substituted with equally Byzantine-influenced mosques), which are indeed partly inhabited by people originating from the Balkan countries, arriving in waves during the turmoil before, during, and after World War I, while the southeastern reaches of the country exhibit little if any cultural differences from Turkey's southern and eastern neighbours. Influences from the Caucasus add to the mix in the northeast. It can be simply put that Turkey is the most oriental of the western nations, or, depending on the point of view, the most occidental of the eastern nations.\n\nPerhaps one thing common to all of the country is Islam, the faith of the bulk of the population. However, interpretation of it varies vastly across the country: many people in the northwestern and western coasts are fairly liberal about the religion (being nominal Muslims sometimes to the point of being irreligious), while the folk of the central steppes and the east are far more conservative (don't expect to find a Saudi Arabia or an Afghanistan even there, though). The rest of the country falls somewhere in between, with the coastal regions being relatively liberal while the inland regions are relatively conservative as a general rule. The largest religious minority in the country are the Alevites, who constitute up to 20% of the population and subscribe to a form of Islam closer to that of the Shiite version, and whose rituals draw heavily from the shamanistic ceremonies of ancient Turks. The other religious minorities (the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Jews, Syriac Oriental Orthodox, and Roman Catholics, the latter of whom mainly settled in Turkey within the last 500 years from Western European countries) were once numerous across the country, but are now mostly confined to the large cities of Istanbul and Izmir, or parts of Southeastern Anatolia in the case of the Syriac Oriental Orthodox. Despite its large Muslim majority population, Turkey officially remains a secular country, with no declared state religion.\n\nPan-Turkism is also a popular ideology in Turkey, and many Turks consider their country to be the voice of all the Turkic peoples of the world.\n\nHolidays\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several holidays that can cause delays in travel, traffic congestion, booked up accommodations and crowded venues. Banks, offices and businesses are closed during official holidays and traffic intensifies during all of the following holidays so do your research before you visit. Do not be put off by these holidays, it is not that difficult and often quite interesting to travel during Turkish holidays; plan ahead as much as possible.\n\nOfficial holidays\n\n[edit]\n\n1 January: New Year's Day (Yılbaşı)\n\n23 April: National Sovereignty and Children's Day (Ulusal Egemenlik ve Çocuk Bayramı) — the anniversary of the establishment of the Turkish Grand National Assembly rallies, Turkish flags and Atatürk portraits everywhere, all modes of travel busy.\n\n1 May: Labour and Solidarity Day (Emek ve Dayanışma Günü, also unofficially known as İşçi Bayramı, i.e. Worker's Day) was long banned as a holiday for almost 40 years and only restarted as a national holiday in 2009 because in years past it usually degenerated into violence. Don't get caught in the middle of a May Day parade or gathering.\n\n19 May: Atatürk Commemoration and Youth & Sports Holiday (Atatürk'ü Anma Gençlik ve Spor Bayramı) — the arrival of Atatürk in Samsun, and the beginning of the War of Independence\n\n30 August: Victory Day (Zafer Bayramı) — Celebration of the end of the war for Turkish Independence over invasion forces. A big Armed Forces day and display of military might by huge military parades.\n\n29 October: Republic Day (Cumhuriyet Bayramı or Yirmi dokuz Ekim) is the anniversary of the declaration of the Turkish Republic. If it falls on a Thursday for example, Friday and the weekend should be considered in your travel plans. October 29 is the official end of the tourist season in many resorts in Mediterranean Turkey and usually, there is a huge celebration at the town squares.\n\n10 November, 09:05 — Traffic usually stops and sirens blare for two minutes starting at 09:05, the time when Atatürk, founder of the Turkish Republic, died in Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul in 1938. That moment in time is officially observed throughout the country but businesses and official places are not closed for the day. However, do not be surprised if you are on the street, you hear a loud boom and all of a sudden people and traffic stop on the sidewalks and streets for a moment of silence in observance of this event.\n\nReligious holidays\n\n[edit]\n\nRamadan\n\nRamadan is the 9th and holiest month in the Islamic calendar and lasts 29–30 days. Muslims fast every day for its duration and most restaurants will be closed until the fast breaks at dusk. Nothing (including water and cigarettes) is supposed to pass through the lips from dawn to sunset. Non-Muslims are exempt from this, but should still refrain from eating or drinking in public as this is considered very impolite. Working hours are decreased as well in the corporate world. Exact dates of Ramadan depend on local astronomical observations and may vary somewhat from country to country. Ramadan concludes with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which may last several days, usually three in most countries.\n\n11 March – 9 April 2024 (1445 AH)\n\n1 March – 29 March 2025 (1446 AH)\n\n18 February – 19 March 2026 (1447 AH)\n\n8 February – 8 March 2027 (1448 AH)\n\nIf you're planning to travel to Turkey during Ramadan, consider reading Travelling during Ramadan.\n\nRamadan (Ramazan in Turkish) is a month-long time of fasting, prayer and celebration during which pious Muslims neither eat nor drink anything, even water, from sun up to sun down. Businesses, banks and official places are not closed during this time. In some parts of Turkey, such as the interior and the east where locals are more conservative, it is considered to be bad taste to eat snacks or drink sodas in public places or transport — best to observe locals and act like them — but restaurants are usually open and it is no problem to eat in them as usual, although some restaurant owners use it as an opportunity for a much-needed vacation (or renovation) and shut their business completely for 30 days. On the other hand, in large urban centres and the coastal resorts, Ramadan is barely noticeable. At sunset, the call for prayer and a cannon boom declare it's time for iftar, the first meal of the day for those fasting.\n\nDuring Ramadan, many city councils offer free iftar meals in public squares to any passer-by. This is considered a charity, and anyone is welcome to join.\n\nImmediately following Ramazan is the Eid-ul Fitr, or the three-day national holiday of Ramazan Bayramı, also called Şeker Bayramı (\"Candy Festival\") during which banks, offices and businesses are closed and travel will be heavy. However, many restaurants, cafés and bars will be open.\n\nKurban Bayramı (pronounced koor-BAHN bahy-rah-muh), often known by its Arabic name of Eid el-Adha or sacrifice holiday is the most important Islamic religious festival of the year. It lasts for four days (but is usually extended weekend to weekend if it falls midweek) and is a public holiday in Turkey. Almost everything will be closed during that time (many restaurants, cafes, bars and some small shops will be open, though). Kurban Bayramı is also the time of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, so both domestic and international travel is intense in Turkey at this time. If you are in smaller towns or villages you may even observe an animal, usually a goat but sometimes a cow, being slaughtered in a public place. The Turkish government has cracked down on these unofficial slaughterings so it is not as common as it once was.\n\nThe dates of these religious festivals change according to the Muslim lunar calendar and thus occur 10-11 days earlier each year.\n\nDuring both religious holidays, some cities may provide public transport for free (this does not include privately owned minibuses, dolmuşes, taxis, or inter-city buses).\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate in Turkey is often (rather simplistically and inaccurately) described as Mediterranean, and this brings to mind the imagery of sunny, hot summers and warm seas. The reality is a bit more complicated than this, however. While most of the southern and western coasts of Turkey fit this description quite well, most of Turkey does not. In fact, the northern coasts are rainy enough to feature temperate rainforests, with the lush Euxine-Colchic forests stretching all the way from northern Istanbul (see Belgrad Forest) to Georgia. Meanwhile, the continental inland regions, especially in the east, can get brutally cold with temperatures approaching -40°C during the coldest nights of winter.\n\nKeeping this information in mind, it is very important to plan accordingly.\n\nBlack Sea coast\n\n[edit]\n\nAreas on the Black Sea coastline experience an oceanic climate, similar to Western Europe, albeit the Black Sea coastline is quite a bit rainier.\n\nSummers are warm, but they feature regular heavy showers and therefore risk of floods and mudslides.\n\nWinter ranges from mild to cold but is generally chilly with lengthy periods of rain and brief breaks of sunshine.\n\nSnow in the region is occasional and falls most winters. Watch out if you decide to climb the mountains, they can feature intense snowfalls.\n\nMarmara region\n\n[edit]\n\nAreas on the coast of the Marmara Sea, including Istanbul, have an oceanic climate as well, however it might be more accurate to call it a dry-summer oceanic climate, similar to areas like the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMarmara's winters are possibly the hardest vacation sales pitch in the country, except perhaps continental locations in Eastern Turkey. While not brutally cold by any means, it is utterly miserable, as it experiences -although most locals might find the term suffers through more accurate- almost 20 days of rain a month.\n\nSummers are very warm in Istanbul and hot in southern Marmara, but unlike the Black Sea region, all of the region is relatively less rainy during summer, nevertheless with high levels of humidity.\n\nSnow in this region is occasional, but falls every winter, and is likely to affect road conditions, especially in relatively highland locations.\n\nAegean and Mediterranean coasts\n\n[edit]\n\nAreas on the Mediterranean and Aegean coastlines have a typical Mediterranean climate, similar to the Central Valley in California, Adelaide in Australia, and of course the rest of the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nSummers are hot and dry, with temperatures reaching 35°C very regularly.\n\nWinters are mild with occasional rainstorms, which can get quite heavy.\n\nSnow in this region is rare, except in Gallipoli, where a few snowy periods are typical.\n\nInland regions\n\n[edit]\n\nInland regions generally have a continental climate, with hot, dry summers (expect around 30°C during the day, unless mentioned below) and cold, snowy winters (expect around 0°C during the day, unless mentioned below). The individual differences inside these regions are too many and too complicated to talk about here; however, there are general warnings that are useful.\n\nSummers in the southeastern part of the country and near valleys inland from the Aegean coast can get very hot, with daytime averages near or above 35°C (95°F)\n\nWinters in the eastern part of the country can get very cold as well, with nighttime temperatures regularly plunging below -18°C (0°F)\n\nSpring is thunderstorm season in inland locations, and severe storms can definitely be a problem.\n\nVisitor information\n\n[edit]\n\nGo Türkiye\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nEntry requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkey is one of the few Middle Eastern countries that accept Israeli passport holders in their country.\n\nUPDATE: since December 22, 2023, a visa will no longer be required for holders of passports from Bahrain, Canada, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and the United States for stays of up to 90 days.\n\nVisa-free\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkish visa requirements were relaxed in 2020. Ordinary passport holders of the countries below can enter Turkey visa-free for tourism and commerce, for up to 90 days unless a shorter period is stated. Your passport must be valid for 60 days beyond your maximum stay, so for most visitors that is 150 days beyond entry. That is just under five months: they politely ask for six months validity on entry but it is not a requirement. (Be prepared to argue this point with airline clerks.) So, no visa needed if you're from:\n\nall EU and EEA countries except the Republic of Cyprus. For Latvia, entry is only for 30 days. The EU/EEA visa regime also applies to Andorra, Monaco, the United Kingdom, and the Vatican.\n\nOther European countries: Albania (90 days), Bosnia and Herzegovina (90), Kosovo (90), Moldova (90), Montenegro (90), North Macedonia (90), Serbia (90), Ukraine (90), and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (no limit).\n\nCIS countries: Russia (60), Belarus (30), Azerbaijan (30), Georgia (90), Kazakhstan (30), Kyrgyzstan (30), Mongolia (30), Tajikistan (30) and Uzbekistan (30); but not Armenia and Turkmenistan.\n\nCentral and South America and the Caribbean: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica (30), Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, St Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nOthers: Bahrain, Brunei, Canada, Hong Kong (SAR Passports only), Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya (depends on age), Macau (30), Malaysia, Morocco, New Zealand, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, Syria, Thailand (30), Tunisia, the U.A.E. and the United States.\n\nA national ID card is acceptable instead of a passport from the EU and EEA countries of Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, plus Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, TR Northern Cyprus, and Ukraine. For Poles and Ukrainians (and perhaps others), this is only possible if they are arriving directly from their home countries. Often only the newer, biometric versions of the ID cards are accepted in lieu of passports. It is ambiguous whether the card needs 90+60 days remaining validity on entry.\n\nFor some of those countries, you may even enter on a passport/ID that is expired within the last five years. Never plan on doing this, as it is unlikely you would be allowed to leave the previous country or to board a flight or boat. There would have to be some special reason. \"Fighting in Syria this last ten years\" will not do, as the waiver specifically excludes arrivals from Iran, Iraq or Syria.\n\nThe visa-free regime is only for tourist and commercial visits. Employment or study requires a visa from the Turkish consulate; e-visas are not available for this.\n\nE-Visa\n\n[edit]\n\nOther citizens need a visa, but most can get an e-visa online. Official prices are quoted in US dollars; for instance, it is US$20 for the US, US$60 for Australia and Canada, and no fee for Mexico, Malta and Kuwait. These rates (correct as of June 2022) are only for prior application. Beware third-party websites scalping you for more.\n\nAn e-visa is valid for three months for passport holders of Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Hong Kong (BNO Passport), Jamaica, Maldives, Mexico, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is valid for one month from Armenia, China, Cyprus, East Timor, Fiji, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Suriname, Taiwan, and Zambia.\n\nA longer list of nationalities can get an e-visa valid for one month, with a big catch: you must already hold some other valid visa such as an EU Schengen, British or Irish visa. Those people will have jumped through various official hoops to get such a visa, so it is as if Turkey has expatriated its consular processes and doesn't need to closely vet such applicants. The rules vary - for some there is an age restriction, or even a requirement to arrive on Turkish Airlines. These additional countries are Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Botswana, Burkino Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Iraq, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Vietnam, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.\n\nVisa on arrival\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can also get your visa on arrival at a Turkish airport, generally for $10-20 USD beyond what you would have paid for an e-Visa. Due to the way that Visas on arrival are priced, it is possible that the visa on arrival may cost less than an e-Visa if you pay in a currency other than US Dollars. For example, a visa on arrival for a Canadian citizen is $60 USD, but if you pay in Euro banknotes, it would cost $53 USD (as of June 2022 pricing and foreign exchange rates). The Visa on arrival is not a formal printed visa but stamps applied within your passport.\n\nThe same conditions as for the e-visa apply. However, you may have to face down airline gate agents saying you cannot check-in without a visa when leaving for Turkey from another country.\n\nUse a bank card in the airport machines to avoid grief over acceptable bank notes.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkey's chief international gateway by air is Istanbul Airport (IST IATA), opened in 2018. This has excellent global connections, as the flag carrier Turkish Airlines is vying with the Gulf carriers to capture traffic between Europe and Asia; it also serves all major Turkish cities. It is 40 km northwest of downtown, reach the city by metro or a variety of public buses.\n\nThe former main airport Atatürk closed in 2019. Beware out-of-date road signage & maps, and crooked taxi drivers who may try to take you to what is now a demolition site.\n\nAnother gateway is Istanbul's second airport, Sabiha Gökçen Airport (SAW IATA), 50 km east of central Istanbul on the Asian side. It is particularly used by budget airlines such as Pegasus. The flight connections are not as extensive as Istanbul's, but they include the main Turkish cities, Ercan in Northern Cyprus, and several Gulf States. This airport is also convenient for Pendik railway station, for fast trains to Eskişehir, Ankara and Konya. There are shuttle buses from the airport to Taksim square and a metro line to Kadıköy.\n\nBeach resorts such as Antalya, Bodrum and Dalaman have direct package-tour flights from Europe, including from minor and secondary airports. You may be able to book these as flight-only.\n\nThere are occasional summer international flights direct to other Turkish cities such as Ankara, Adana and Izmir. But normally, reaching these means changing planes in Istanbul and clearing immigration, security and customs there. You need to allow the best part of two hours for this. Ask at your departure airport whether your bags are being checked through to your destination, or whether you need to pick them up in Istanbul.\n\nYou can enter Turkey coming from airports near the border in Kutaisi (KUT IATA), Batumi (BUS IATA) and Burgas (BOJ IATA). From the island of Kos (KGS IATA) it's just a short ferry ride.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nWikivoyage has an article on Rail travel in Turkey\n\nFrom Western Europe to Turkey by train, the route goes through Budapest then overnight from either Bucharest or Sofia to Istanbul. A sleeper train departs Sofia around 21:00 nightly, running via Plovdiv, Kapikule on the border, and Edirne, to terminate at Istanbul Halkali by 08:00. From June to Sept another sleeper, the Bosphor Express, departs Bucharest around noon, running via Ruse to Kapikule, where it's coupled to the train from Sofia. All passengers have to get out in the middle of the night for border procedures before continuing to Halkali. That terminus is 25 km from city centre, change to the frequent Marmaray cross-city train to get downtown. From June to Sept another sleeper, the Bosphor Express, departs Bucharest at 12:45, running via Ruse to Kapikule. The westbound train leaves Halkali at 21:40 to reach Sofia by 09:00 and Bucharest by 19:00 next day. From October to May the through-train from Bucharest doesn't run, so you change trains at Ruse then again at Kapikule, with a similar timetable. Trains from Budapest and Belgrade don't connect with those to Turkey, so you need to spend a night in either Sofia or Bucharest. See Istanbul#Get in for more detail.\n\nOptima Express is a car-train between Villach in Austria and Edirne twice a week April-Nov, taking 33 hours. It enables motorists to avoid the tricky, tiring roads through the Balkans, and is also open for passengers without cars. Optima don't offer tickets from intermediate stations such as Zagreb.\n\nThe Budapest-Belgrade and Belgrade-Sofia lines are disrupted by engineering works, probably until 2024, so it's better to reach Turkey via Bucharest.\n\nThe railway between Turkey and Georgia only carries freight. Passenger trains between Ankara, Kars, Tbilisi and Baku have been promised since its completion in 2017.\n\nThe weekly train from Tehran and Tabriz in Iran remains suspended.\n\nDon't count on receiving a visa on arrival on the rail border crossings — see the section on visas above.\n\nThere are no cross-border trains to any other country. For Greece, travel either to Edirne to catch a Greek domestic train in Kastanies 9 km southwest across the border or to Sofia then change for Thessaloniki. There is no foreseeable prospect of services to Armenia, Iraq, Syria, or the Azerbaijan exclave of Nakhchivan.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Central Europe, getting to Turkey is not too difficult. In any case you'll need your International Insurance Card (Green Card). Pay attention to \"TR\" not being cancelled and be sure your insurance is valid for the Asian part of Turkey, too. Otherwise you will have to buy Turkish car insurance separately.\n\nA carnet de passage is not required (but some of the neighbouring countries to the east do, so check in advance if they are on your itinerary). There are conditions attached:\n\nYou either have to be the owner of the vehicle you're driving into Turkey or have a notarized permit from the owner.\n\nAnyone other than the driver on entry or their family members can't drive it within the country.\n\nThe vehicle can't stay longer than 90 days within any 180 days in Turkey.\n\nThe driver is subject to a hefty penalty if they leave the country without the vehicle, or without handing it temporarily over to the customs administration first.\n\nSee the official guide for temporarily importing vehicles for further details.\n\nForeign driver's licences are valid for up to 6 months beyond the date of entry. The regulations aren't entirely clear on the validity of licences from which countries, but it's safe to assume those issued by the parties to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (most of the European countries and many others elsewhere; check the list at the end of this official webpage) are acceptable, at the very least. If unsure, obtain an international driving permit before setting out.\n\nMajor roads from Europe are:\n\nE80 enters Turkey at Kapıkule border gate (west of Edirne, east of Svilengrad) from Bulgaria\n\nE87 enters Turkey at Dereköy border gate (north of Kırklareli, south of Malko Tarnovo) from Bulgaria\n\nE90 enters Turkey at İpsala border gate (west of Keşan, east of Alexandroupolis) from Greece\n\nAnd see \"By train\" above for the car-train between Villach in Austria and Edirne. The former EuroTurk car-train from Bonn no longer runs.\n\nMajor roads from the Middle East enter Turkey at numerous border gates around Antakya (Antioch), from Syrian cities such as Aleppo and Latakia, Habur border gate (south of Silopi, north of Zakho) from Iraq, and Gürbulak/Bazergan border gate (east of Doğubayazıt, west of Maku) from Iran.\n\nMajor roads from the Caucasus enter Turkey at Sarp/Sarpi border gate (south of Batumi) and Türkgözü border gate (north of Ardahan, south of Akhaltsikhe) from Georgia. Since 1993, the border with Armenia has been closed, thus it's impossible to cross into Turkey through Armenia.\n\nVarious smaller border posts with nearly all of the neighbouring countries also exist; they might be closed at night, or have connecting roads not in an as good condition as those listed above.\n\nDuring holidays these border gates, particularly those linking to the European countries, may be extremely congested at times. Especially during the summer many Turks who live in Germany drive back home and this creates huge lines at the border.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Bucharest there is a daily bus to Istanbul at 16:00 for RON125. There are also several daily buses from Constanta, Romania and from Sofia, Bulgaria and from there you can get connections to the major cities of Europe. Another possibility is the bus from Athens in Greece via Thessaloniki. You may also find smaller bus companies offering connections to other countries in the Balkans.\n\nA couple of Turkish bus companies operate buses between Sofia and Istanbul. These buses typically stop at various cities along the way. A direct bus service connects Odesa, Ukraine with Istanbul once a week for 1,000 грн (about €40) (2015).\n\nGeorgia\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several border points between Turkey and Georgia, in particular in Batumi and Tbilisi. You may have to change at the border, but should be able to find direct buses from Istanbul to Batumi, Tbilisi and Baku in Azerbaijan.\n\nThere is also a dolmuş/marshrutka service from Batumi to Ankara. Contact them via the Facebook group Работа Грузии / Армении, but the communication is in Russian, Georgian or Turkish only.\n\nIraq\n\n[edit]\n\nBus companies also connect Erbil to the Turkish cities of Diyarbakır (10–15 hours) and Istanbul (36–48 hours). The list of companies here is incomplete; there are at least two other Turkish companies running buses from Erbil to cities in Turkey - look around for flyers on Iskan Road in Erbil. Arrival time depends on border formalities; on entry to Turkey waits of up to several hours when the officers are manually checking every single hole in the bus while all the passengers are disembarked aren't unheard of.\n\nCizre Nuh (Tel Erbil: 0750 340 47 73) runs everyday at 15:30 from the New City Mall, 60m Road to Istanbul ($100) via Silopi ($40) Diyarbakır and other cities in between. Tickets can be bought at the New City Mall, Flyaway on Barzani Namir and at a phone shop on Shekhi Choly close to the Bazaar.\n\nCan Diyarbakir (Tel Erbil: 0750 895 62 17-18-19) leaves daily from Family Mall on 100mt Road to Istanbul via Ankara, Diyarbakır and other cities in between.\n\nBest Van runs from Ainkawa Road in Erbil to Istanbul via Adana, Aksaray, Ankara (departure at 14:00) and Diyarbakır (departure at 16:00, via Hasankeyf and Batman). The bus back from Diyarbakır to Erbil departs at 11:00.\n\nIran\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a direct bus to Istanbul from Teheran in Iran which takes approx 48hr and costs USD$35 for a one-way ticket between Istanbul or Ankara and Tehran.\n\nDogubeyazit/Bazerghan This Turkey/Iran border crossing is easily (and quickly) done by public transport. Take a bus to Bazerghan and a shared taxi to the border (US$2-3). Cross the border stretch per pedes and catch a frequent minibus (~5 TL, 15 minutes) to Dogubeyazit. Check the security situation in the region, due to the unsolved PKK conflict.\n\nThere are also buses from Van to Urmia crossing the Turkey/Iran border at Esendere/Sero. The buses cost ~€13 and it takes more than 6 hr to finish the 300 km path. This is because of the poor roads, harsh snowy conditions during the winter and also many military checkpoints because of security reasons concerning the PKK.\n\nThis southern route is less frequent than the northern Dogubeyazit/Bazerghan, as it is much slower but therefore a scenic mountainous route.\n\nMake sure you get a clear idea about exchange rates if you want to change Turkish lira or rial as the official bank at the border does not exchange these currencies and you have to deal with the plentiful black market.\n\nSyria\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you're sure you want to go . . . assume it'll be a change of bus at the border. The through-buses for Damascus and Beirut haven't run for years.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ferries in the Mediterranean\n\nTo Karasu (northeast of Istanbul, near Adapazarı) there are ferries several times a week across the Black Sea from Chornomorske, the main port for Odesa in Ukraine. They run all year and take vehicles. In bygone years ferries sailed between Istanbul and other Black Sea ports, and elsewhere in the Med, but they no longer do so.\n\nCruise ships usually dock on Istanbul's European side, around Karaköy / Galataport close to the historic centre. These ships are on cruise itineraries, which usually include the Aegean resort of Kuşadası. Check with the operator whether a point-to-point journey ending in Istanbul is possible.\n\nSeveral Greek islands lie close to the Turkish Aegean coast and are linked by hydrofoil fast ferries, and also have westward ferries that ultimately reach Piraeus the port for Athens. Routes (some seasonal) include Bodrum-Kos, Çeşme-Chios, Datça-Rhodes & Symi, Kuşadası-Samos and Marmaris-Rhodes.\n\nAs of 2023 there is no direct ferry between Turkey and mainland Greece.\n\nThere are ferry connections from Kyrenia in Northern Cyprus to Taşucu, Mersin (near Adana) and Alanya. A year-round truckers ferry goes to Taşucu, while seasonal fast ferries depart to both Taşucu and Mersin. There is also a passenger line to Hatay.\n\nTaşucu is also served by a line from Tripoli in Lebanon.\n\nRo-ros operated by DFDS transfer cars and motorbikes from Western Europe, more specifically from the Italian port of Trieste to the Istanbul area and Mersin, and from the French port of Sète to Yalova (on the Sea of Marmara south of Istanbul). The passage takes three days, but you need to arrange your own travel between the said harbours.\n\nArriving by own boat, one needs to go to one of the designated Ports of Entry and one may need to hire an agent to interface towards the authorities – in some ports it's by now impossible to check in without an agent, in others one should expect significant headwind if trying to do things without an agent. The check-in procedure may cost around €200–400 (and same for check-out); most of this money goes into the pocket of the agent, but there are also document fees (which should be zero when leaving) and the mooring fee while going through the process. In some check-in points it will be possible to visit the tax-free shop while entering or leaving Turkey. It's forbidden to release any waste-water in Turkey, even including grey water. It's not mandatory to have a grey water tank, but one may have to pay a hefty fine if someone observes dish washing foam etc leaving your boat in a popular anchorage. Your agent will give you a \"blue card\" document / QR-code which should be used to register visits to the pump-out stations. Possession of such a \"blue card\" is mandatory while sailing in Turkey. The rules seems to change frequently, but as of May 2024, there seems to be no rules on how often the pump-out stations should be visited – one may be able to check out from Turkey without any questions asked on this, but one may have to have some explanations to do if one has stayed for three months without pumping out. While one may anchor up pretty much anywhere, apparently one is not supposed to visit harbours other than marinas licensed to serve tourists (as of May 2024, those cost like €150/night for a 13 meter monohull yacht). On entry one gets a \"voyage permission\" document (transit log with crew list) which allegedly is valid for one year, but as a tourist one may only stay in Turkey for 90 days. Expect to be checked up regularly by the coast guard, both while sailing and anchoring up.\n\nTransit by boat\n\n[edit]\n\nGreece and Turkey has a long and disputed sea border, luckily according to the \"innocent passage\"-rules one may quite freely cross the sea border between Greece and Turkey without any declaration while sailing (but possibly the guest flag should be taken down) as long as the source and destination port is in the same country and as long as you don't anchor up in the wrong country. Some forum posts indicates that one may anchor up in the wrong waters and just change the guest flag. It may work in practice, all until one is checked - and beware that Turkey has a lot of coast guard vessels actively checking up on boat tourists.\n\nAccording to the Montreaux convention, you can pass the Bosporus, Sea of Marmara and Dardanelles without checking into Turkey. If the boat is less than 20 meters long, one can do so freely without notifying any Turkish authorities. When going from one Schengen country to another (like Bulgaria - Greece), one can in theory do it freely without notifying any authorities at all. It's a long way, and in order to sail safely it may be needed to anchor up on the way. This can probably be done legally if notifying the relevant authorities and/or using the dedicated anchorage areas (meant for bigger ships). In practice one may anchor up in more suitable anchorages with a low risk of problems as long as one drops anchor late evening and hoist it in the early morning.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nBy European standards, Turkey is a huge country, with mountains impeding the highways and railways, so domestic air travel is well-developed. Especially on routes to Istanbul it's also very competitive, with Turkish Airlines, and low-cost companies Anadolujet (part of Turkish Airlines), Pegasus Airlines and Sunexpress Airlines fighting for your custom. They operate flights from Izmir and Antalya regions to the Eastern and Black Sea regions. There are flights between Istanbul and Ankara hourly; Izmir and Adana have several flights a day to Istanbul (both IST and SAW) and Ankara, and every city has at least a daily flight.\n\nRegional airports usually have a connecting Havaş bus to the city centre, which will wait, within reason, for incoming flights. Buses and minibuses also fan out from the airports to other nearby towns.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkey has a very good long-distance bus network with air-conditioned buses, reserved seats and generally good-quality service, at least with the major operators. There are now quite a number of companies providing more comfortable buses with 2 + 1 seats per row. Standard buses, however, have seats narrower than those of economy class on aircraft. Buses are often crowded and smoking is prohibited.\n\nGo to the Otogar (bus station) in any of the major cities and you can find a bus to almost any destination departing within half an hour, or a couple of hours at the most. Buses are staffed by drivers and a number of assistants. During the ride you will be offered free drinks, a bite or two, and stops will be made every 2½ hr or so at well-stocked road restaurants. The further east you travel, the less frequent buses will be, but even places as far as Dogubeyazit or Van will have regular services to many places hundreds of kilometres away. Only the smallest towns do not have a bus straight to Istanbul or Izmir at least once every two days.\n\nThe four biggest bus companies are:\n\nMetro Bus\n\nPamukkale\n\nUlusoy\n\nKamil Koç\n\nAlthough, even the smallest company can nowadays be booked via a streamlined website of that bus company. All of them demand a Turkish phone number, but you might just fill in a fake one starting with \"539\" or so. But the email address should work, to get the ticket. All companies accept foreign passengers and passports. In high season it might make sense to book ahead—just check out the situation a couple of days ahead online. You can also use websites that accumulate all the connections, like obilet or busbud—check both, they have different companies. Buses are reliable and will pick you up—remember Istanbul has at least 3 bus stations.\n\nOtherwise, bus tickets can also be bought inside of bus terminals. Often checking out several ticket booths will give you a better price, since some specialize on certain bus companies and others do not.\n\nBe careful, scammers will be waiting for you in and before bus stations, and some may assist you in buying a ticket to a bus that won't depart in the next two hours. Sometimes there simply is no other bus, but on other occasions you will be sitting there while other buses with the same destination start well ahead. If you have some time to spare: check the departure (and arrival) times of other companies, that may save you time overall. Still, if you indicate you really want to leave now (use phrases like \"hemen\" or \"şimdi\", or \"acelem var\" - I am in a hurry ), people will realize you are in hurry, and off you go on the next bus departing for your destination.\n\nIf you have several operators to choose from, ask for the number of seats in the buses you compare. Roughly, a larger capacity implies a greater comfort (all bus-seats have approximately the same leg-room, but larger 48-seat buses are certainly more comfortable than a 15-seat Dolmuş, which may be considered a 'bus' by the company selling the seat). Also, the bus company with the largest sign is usually the one with the most buses and routes. If possible, ask other travellers you meet about their experiences with different operators: even big operators have different standards of service, and even with the same operator the standards may vary from region to region.\n\nDon't be surprised if halfway to some strange and far-off destination you are asked out of the bus (your luggage will often be already standing next to it) and transferred to another. The other bus will \"buy\" you, and will bring you to the destination. This may even happen for 'direct' or 'non-stop' tickets.\n\nSometimes long-haul bus lines will leave you stranded on some ring-road around a city, rather than bringing you to the center. That can be annoying. Inquire ahead (and hope they don't lie). On the other hand, many companies will have \"servis aracı\" or service vehicles to the center, when the Otogar is on the periphery of a city, as they nowadays often are. In some cities these service vehicles are used by many companies combined, and a fleet of them, to different parts of the metropolis, will be waiting. The company may also choose to combine the passengers of multiple buses; meaning that you may have to wait until another bus or two arrives before departing. Keep your ticket ready as proof you were on a bus (though most of these services are run on good faith). In some cities (including Ankara, excluding Istanbul), the municipality have prohibited the use of service buses due to their effect on traffic. In that case, you might have to take a public bus or metro to get to your destination. One should probably avoid using taxis (at least departing from the Otogar) since they usually tend to abuse their monopolistic position by refusing to go to closer destinations, behaving rudely towards the passenger, charging on the night tariff, etc. If you have to take a taxi, it is usually suggested that you do it from outside the bus terminal.\n\nSeating within buses is partly directed by the \"koltuk numarası\" or seat number on your ticket, partly by the ritualistic seating of women next to women, couples together and so forth. So don't be too annoyed if you are required to give up your seat. In general, as a foreigner, you will have the better seat much of the time. It is often easiest to take a seat in the back, whatever the number of your koltuk, and not be bothered for much of the ride. This is particularly true if you travel alone, and want to keep it that way, even though the last row may be reserved for the driver-off-duty, who wants to sleep. And remember: many buses pick up short-track fare along the ride, and park them in the last two or three rows. The back of the bus may be more noisy than the front, since that is where the engine is located.\n\nIf you have a bicycle it will be transported free of extra charge. In most buses it fits in the luggage area of the bus. Make sure you have the tools to fold your bike as small as possible (height matters most)\n\nFez Bus. This is another alternative, a Hop on hop off travel network that links Istanbul to the most popular tourist destinations in western Turkey, and a few other destinations. The buses runs hostel to hostel and have an English speaking tour leader on board. The pass can be purchased for a few days or all summer. Departures are every other day. More expensive than local buses, but could be far less hassle, and offers a different experience. The main office in Istanbul is in Sultanahmet next to the Orient Youth Hostel on Yeni Akbiyik Cd.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rail travel in Turkey\n\nMainline train services in Turkey fall into three categories: very fast and modern, slow and scenic; and suspended long-term for rebuilding or for other reasons. The train operator is TCDD, Turkish Republic State Railways, visit their website[dead link] for timetables, fares and reservations. The trains are inexpensive, but they often sell out.\n\nMost cities in Turkey have a rail connection of some sort, but not the Mediterranean and Aegean holiday resorts, which have been built from the late 20th century and are hemmed in by mountains. For some destinations, connecting buses meet the trains, e.g. at Eskişehir for Bursa.\n\nThe very fast, modern trains are called YHT: yüksek hızlı tren. These serve a trunk line from Istanbul via Eskişehir and Ankara to Sivas, and a branch line via Konya to Karaman, and the network is gradually extending. They are clean, comfortable and modern and keep to time. Thus, from Istanbul it’s under 5 hours to Ankara or Konya. Because journey times are short, YHT trains only run daytime, and have only snack-catering.\n\nBut where the YHT services terminate, the line closures and disruptions immediately begin, as Turkey’s Ottoman-era railways are upgraded for the 21st century.\n\nConventional trains are slow and scenic, with the emphasis on slow: they often are diesel-hauled and run on single track, so they generally start on time but become delayed along the route — often for several hours on long-haul routes; settle on a relaxed schedule for the successive steps of your trip. Most run overnight, with journeys from Ankara to eastern cities taking 24 hours. They are infrequent, at best daily. The typical train set includes a sleeping or a couchette car, and open saloons, plus a buffet that may or may not have any food and may or may not honour your payment card, so plan on bringing cash and your own food. How clean and comfortable the trains are depends on how busy. They are difficult for anyone with impaired mobility to use, and station re-building makes access worse. Nominally these trains are non-smoking, but there’s often a smell of tobacco smoke aboard.\n\nTourist trains operated by TCDD run several long-distance routes, e.g. Ankara to Kars. These cost about twice the normal fare; they make a few 2-3 hour stops for tourist excursions, so the total running time is a little longer. You're tied to the tourist itinerary without flexibility of stopover. The accommodation is the same as on conventional trains: indeed the rolling stock has been provided by pulling sleeping cars off the conventional trains, so the travel experience on these has been degraded.\n\nBuying tickets: Reservations are essential for YHT trains and recommended for other mainline services. YHT and standard mainline (anahat) trains are best booked via the TCDD website[dead link] , but this only opens 15 to 30 days in advance. International trains (uluslararası) can be booked by other methods (below) but not via the website; and regional (bölgesel) trains are not bookable.\n\nThe Inter Rail Global Pass and Balkan Flexipass are valid for all trains within Turkey and the trains to & from Europe, but you may still need a seat reservation. There are discounts for those under 26 and for those over 60.\n\nTickets can also be bought from the stations, from travel agents, or from PTT post offices. The main stations (including Sirkeci) accept credit cards and can book you onto any bookable train, but they’re unlikely to accept non-Turkish cash.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nLike all of its neighbours, except Cyprus off its southern coast, driving is on the right side of the road in Turkey.\n\nDriving in Turkey is usually a tense experience. The local drivers are often badly trained and sometimes reckless, particularly near and within the larger cities and in the southeast. However, the road manners are not entirely different than in the Balkans or parts of Mediterranean Europe, and are a whole lot easier to negotiate than in, say, South Asia. Regardless, never assume the next driver will stick to any rules you would expect, e.g. use blinkers when they are about to change the lane or turn, or give way when they really should. So, always drive defensively.\n\nHaving received generous funding from the government in the first two decades of the 2000s, most highways in the country are of quite good quality, often dual carriageways with wide alignments and hard shoulders. Also smaller roads can be expected to be free of pot holes. Hence, driving at night is not an issue like in many eastern European countries where corruption prevents proper road quality.\n\nIt is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving. Maximum permitted amount of alcohol in blood for drivers is 0.05 mg per ml (0.05%), similar to most European countries. A pint of beer enjoyed right before driving might get your licence temporarily confiscated in case of police checks. A 2019 law has made smoking inside a car by any of the occupants a fineable offence, but enforcement is sporadic. The use of seat belts both at the front and back line is obligatory, but, although failing to use one carries a penalty, this is not always adhered to by locals, including the drivers themselves.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the speed limit for automobiles is 50 km/h and 70 km/h on single and dual carriageways, respectively, within inhabited locations, 90 km/h and 110 km/h on single and dual carriageways elsewhere, and 130 km/h on motorways, except O-5, O-6, O-7, O-21 (Ankara–Niğde section), and O-33, where it is 140 km/h. Speed traps, both stationary and mobile concealed within police cars, are common, particularly in the northwest. By law, they are always indicated within the last kilometre or so, but these signs are sometimes tiny and easy to miss.\n\nWatch out for speed bumps as they might not always be indicated, especially around cities. Also, pay attention to one way lanes or prohibited road access—Turkey uses traffic spikes which block a certain direction.\n\nIt's best to refrain from pulling up in signposted no parking zones. Not that the fines are very hefty, but towing is possible. In case that happens, expect little official information to whereabouts of your car, and be ready for a lot of searching in dismal parking lots, usually out in the suburbs.\n\nTurning right at the red light is forbidden unless there is an additional red or yellow flashing arrow, in which case you should stop, give way to any oncoming traffic, including pedestrians, and then proceed carefully. Even when turning right at a green, be mindful of pedestrians, who may also be given a green light at the same time; such junctions are often indicated by signage.\n\nSince the refugee crisis started in 2015, and the coup attempt in 2016, any significant Turkish city has checkpoints on the approaching highways, where cars may be indiscriminately stopped for document checks (IDs, driver licenses, car registration & insurance); these might be accompanied by sobriety checks especially during weekend nights. Getting stopped by law enforcement every so often apparently without any wrongdoing can be off-putting but is the general procedure.\n\nUnless instructed to do so over the loudspeaker, a police car tailing you with the emergency lights on does not mean you are expected to pull over.\n\nTurkish road signs are almost identical to the ones used in Europe, and differences are often insignificant. The place names written on green background lead to motorways (which you should pay a toll, unless it is a ring road around or within a city); on blue background means other highways; on white background means rural roads (or a road inside a city under the responsibility of city councils); and on brown background indicates the road leads to a place of tourist interest, such as an ancient site (these signs used to be on yellow background previously, so still there is a chance of unreplaced yellow signs existing here and there). These signs are sometimes not standardized.\n\nRoundabouts as understood internationally have started to appear in the latter half of the 2010s or so. As such, most Turkish drivers are yet to have a grasp of how to use them (with the remarkable exception of those in the most of Aegean Turkey), despite the (often huge) signs reminding them of the basic \"give way to those already within\" rule, and act on assumptions on which approach should have priority — always proceed with caution.\n\nMost intercity highways avoid city centres by circling around them. If you'd like to drive into the centre for shopping, dining, and the like, follow the signposts saying Şehir Merkezi, which are usually on white background, and are accompanied by no further translations though you can still spot some old signs saying \"Centrum\" besides Şehir Merkezi. City centres typically have two or more entrances/exits from the ringroads that surround them.\n\nAs Turkey uses the metric system, all distances on the signboards are in kilometres, unless otherwise stated (such as metres, but never in miles).\n\nIn winter, it's not uncommon that many roads, including the major motorways near the sea level, are subject to closures due to heavy snow, which may take hours to clear – or days, particularly in the east.\n\nSee also the #Driving and road safety section below.\n\nMotorways\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are no fees to use the highways except intercity motorways (otoyol). While Turkish highways vary widely in quality and size, the toll motorways mostly have three or four lanes and are very smooth and fast. Motorways are explicitly signed with distinct green signs and given road numbers prefixed with the letter O. The motorway network consists of the routes stretching out from Istanbul to the west (towards Edirne), south (via Bursa to Izmir) and east (via Ankara and Adana all the way to Urfa in Southeastern Anatolia), and an isolated stretch in Eastern Thrace, crossing the Straits of Dardanelles by the Çanakkale 1915 Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in the world, to the east of Çanakkale. There are also regional mini-networks connected to the main one in the Istanbul metropolitan area, in Central Aegean fanning out of Izmir, and in the Eastern Mediterranean around Adana.\n\nMany motorways no longer have toll booths (although some of the newer parts of the network, e.g. O-7 the third beltway of Istanbul and O-6 crossing the Dardanelles, are exceptions that you can still pay in cash to a booth attendant) and instead have lanes automatically scanning the windowpane for the RFID stickers (HGS) while accessing and again exiting the motorway. They are easy to use and allow you to install as much liras as you need. To buy an HGS sticker, look for the service buildings at the major toll stations. They are also available in postoffices.\n\nKGS and OGS, systems respectively using prepaid cards and tags, have been phased out.\n\nIn addition to the distance driven, motorway tolls also depend on the type of your vehicle. For example, the 212-km Edirne–Istanbul motorway — the main entry point to Istanbul from Europe — costs 23.25 TL for a car (2023). The newest additions to the network, such as the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge and the Osman Gazi Bridge (crossing the Bosphorus and the Gulf of İzmit, respectively) tend to be much more expensive per km. Check the up-to-date rates from the website of the General Directorate of Highways.\n\nFuel and charging\n\n[edit]\n\nExpect fuel prices to be about a third cheaper than the Western European average, a little less than that of the Balkans, and much higher than the Middle Eastern. In Oct 2023, the average stands at about €1.30/L.\n\nPetrol stations (benzin istasyonu) are frequent along the highways; virtually all are open round the clock and accept cards (go to the service building after placing your order, as swipe machines are almost always there). Self-service is practically nonexistent. Almost all stations offer unleaded gasoline (kurşunsuz benzin), diesel (dizel or motorin), and LPG (liquid petroleum gas, LPG or otogaz). However the rare fuel stations in the backcountry often only have diesel, used for running agricultural machinery. So keep your gas tank topped up if you are going to stray away from the main roads. Also the petrol stations along the toll motorways are less frequent than the other highways, usually only about every 40-50 km or even further apart at places (the distance to the next station is usually indicated at the associated signage), so don't get too low on these roads either.\n\nBiofuels are very hard to come by for the casual driver. As of 2022 there are few electric vehicle charging stations, although covering the main intercity routes without running out of range, especially if you don't stray too far into the east, seems possible. Eşarj, ZES, Voltrun, CV Charging Vehicles and DMA maintain relatively wide networks of charging stations; see their websites for the associated maps. You'll need company-issued charge cards which may not be compatible with each other.\n\nFuel stations will have free toilets and sometimes free çay.\n\nRepair shops\n\n[edit]\n\nIn any significant community, you can expect to find repair shops, usually clustered together in the areas called sanayi sitesi (\"industrial zone\") or oto sanayi sitesi in the outskirts of the towns. The shops are specialized in parts of the vehicle (e.g., engine, electrical system or bodywork) and the level of skill in solving the problem varies, but the service is often quick with the caveat that, without Turkish language skills, you are almost certain to need a translation app or to use a lot of body language.\n\nIn cities and major towns, there are also big 3S businesses (sales, service, spare parts). These are more corporate than sanayi sitesi and are called oto plaza, but may entail getting lined up in a queue, which may take days to process.\n\nRenting a car\n\n[edit]\n\nYou may rent a car to get around Turkey from an international or local car rental agent. The main airports all have car rental desks.\n\nIt is a good idea to rent a car locally to explore the region for a couple of days. However, doing all the kilometers of Turkey in a rental, can be exhausting and also expensive if you rent at one place and give it back at another one.\n\nInstead of wasting money on the common big car rental companies, local rental companies can be trusted and found through Google Maps. Contact them via WhatsApp. They will speak sufficient English to get the deal done. It is important to rely on their online rating and reviews (at Google Maps) to make sure to avoid the bad sheep—they will not want to jeopardise a good rating. Sometimes they will not even demand a deposit for their rental. However, make sure to understand whether the is a mileage limit, cleaning necessity or restriction on any roads. Contracts will usually be in Turkish with local companies.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are plentiful in cities and resort towns. Unless you have your own wheels, they are often the only way to reach remote sites – best to negotiate a price for a return trip and waiting time before hopping on to avoid unpleasant situations later.\n\nPerhaps not all of them deserve this kind of \"recognition\", but taxi drivers in larger cities are notorious for taking their passengers along a route longer than needed, especially when they see you are new to town; see Istanbul#Taxi drivers for some tips to cope with potential scams.\n\nThe major ride-hailing companies are Uber (you may need to use VPN as their website gets banned on and off in Turkey due to a long-standing legal disagreement with the Taxi Drivers Association), Bitaksi, Istanbul metropolitan council-associated iTaksi (website not working as of Oct 2023; download a mobile app), and Russian Yandex Taxi, which is available only in Ankara.\n\nBy dolmuş/minibus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe minibüs is a small bus (sometimes a car) that will ride near-fixed routes. The ride may be from the periphery of a major city to the centre or within a city, but may also take three to four hours from one city to the next, when demand along the route is not sufficient to justify large buses. They sometimes make a detour to bring some old folks home or collect some extra heavy luggage. All during the journey people will get in and out (shout inecek var — “someone to get off” — to have it stop if you’re in). The driver tends to be named kaptan (\"captain\"), and some behave accordingly. The fare is collected all through the ride. In some, by a specially appointed passenger who will get a reduction, in others by a steward, who may get off halfway down the journey to pick up a dolmuş of the same company heading back, but mostly by the driver. If the driver collects, people hand money on from the back rows to the front, getting change back by the same route. On some stretches tickets are sold in advance, and things can get complicated if some of the passengers bought a ticket and others just sat inside waiting, for maybe half an hour, but without a ticket.\n\nThe concept of dolmuş in Istanbul is different than the rest of Turkey. The vehicles are different and they take a maximum of 7 sitting passengers, with no standing. They do not tend to take passengers along the way, they depart immediately when they are full, and many of them operate 24 hours a day. The name derives from dolmak, the verb for “to fill”, as they usually depart only when they are full, though they sometimes start at fixed hours, whatever the number.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nFast ferries (hızlı feribot) are fast (50-60km/hour) catamaran-type ferryboats that connect for instance Istanbul to the other side of the Marmara Sea. They can cut travel time dramatically. Again for instance leaving from the Yenikapı jetty in Istanbul (just a bit southwest of the Blue Mosque) you can be at the Bursa otogar in two hours, with less than an hour for the actual boat ride to Yalova. Similar services are operated to connect several parts of Istanbul with the Asian side, or places farther up the Bosporus. This type of fast ferry is increasingly seen all over the country wherever there is sufficient water.\n\nAll inhabited Turkish islands have at least one daily sailing to the nearest mainland city or town during summer. During winter, expect less frequent departures, and disruptions in the schedule, due to the bad weather.\n\nPerhaps one of the best cruising grounds in the world, Turkey offers thousands of years of history, culture and civilization set against a stunning mountainous backdrop. The coastline is a mixture of wide gulfs, peaceful coves, shady beaches, uninhabited islands, small villages and bustling towns. Many of these locations are still only accessible by boat. Rare in the Mediterranean, one can still find some seclusion on a private charter in Turkey. Turkey has more coastline than any other Mediterranean country. The best way to see Turkey is from your own private yacht on your own schedule. Turkey offers some of the most exquisite yachts in the world, known as gulets.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nSimply put, long distance cycling in Turkey is burdensome, mainly for two reasons: most of the country's terrain is hilly, and intercity bike paths are basically non-existent, albeit with some noteworthy exceptions (such as a section of EuroVelo 8 across Izmir Province or the lane down from Arsuz towards the Syrian border). That being said, many cities nowadays have cycling lanes of varying shapes, lengths and interconnectedness (often along the esplanades of the coastal cities; these were mostly built with the purpose of a leisurely ride in mind than serious transportation) and most highways built after the turn of this century or so have quite wide and well surfaced shoulders, which can double as bicycle lanes.\n\nEven so, if you have already decided to give cycling a try in your Turkey trip, always stay as much on the right side of the roads as possible, avoid night cycling out of cities or along unlit roads, do not be surprised by drivers hooting at you, and do not go on the motorway, as it is forbidden. You might prefer rural roads with much less traffic, but then there is the problem of freely roaming sheepdogs, which can sometimes be quite dangerous. The signage on the rural roads is also much more erratic, turning them into a labyrinth, in which it is easy to get lost even for non-local Turkish people without a detailed map.\n\nAir can be pumped into tyres at any petrol station without charge. Bicycle repair-shops are rare in cities and often in hard-to-locate places; you could try a motorcycle repair shop, however they are very reluctant to repair a bicycle if they are already busy with their specialization.\n\nMany towns operate bike sharing programs, but they might be hard to use without Turkish language skills, or without a Turkish mobile number.\n\nCycling in areas where motor vehicles are restricted is enjoyable, but there are few: Istanbul's Princes' Islands are a prime example.\n\nEbikes with removable batteries are manufactured and sold at reasonable prices, but check first with your airline if you plan to fly with it. As elsewhere, ebikes with non-removable batteries are strictly forbidden on all flights.\n\nBy thumb\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Thumb up\" is the hitchhiking gesture universally understood by the Turkish drivers. Avoid using any other signal which might be understood to be indicating a danger ahead. In addition to the thumb, having a signboard with the destination name certainly helps. Waiting for a ride generally doesn't exceed half an hour, though this dramatically varies depending on the density of traffic (like elsewhere) and the region; for example, it usually takes much longer to attract a ride in Mediterranean Turkey than in the Marmara Region. The best hitchhiking spots are the crossroads with traffic lights, where bypass roads around a city and the road coming from the center intersect. Don’t be so away from the traffic lights so drivers would be slow enough to see you, make up their minds and stop, but be sufficiently away for traffic safety. Hitchhiking along the motorways is useless; no one will be slow enough to stop, and the pedestrians are forbidden anyway. Don’t start to hitchhike until you are well clear out of the city traffic which has the tendency to spread over the suburbs, and if not in hurry, avoid hitchhiking after nightfall, especially if you are a lone female traveler.\n\nAlthough most drivers have little if any intentions beyond having a chat during their long journey, always watch out and avoid sleeping.\n\nOn some occasions, you may not be able to attract a ride directly to your destination, so don’t refuse anyone offering a ride, which may come across as impolite, unless they are going down only a few kilometres away and are branching off into a road different from your destination in a coming fork. You may have to change several cars even on a route barely 100 km long, in each town after town. However, because of the enormous numbers of trucks carrying goods for the foreign markets, you may also score surprisingly long-haul trips.\n\nSome drivers may ask for money (“fee”) from you. Refuse and tell them that if you had money to waste, you would be on a bus, and not standing on the side of the road fully exposed to the elements.\n\nDrivers staying in the area may point downwards (to the road surface) or towards the direction they’re driving or flash their headlights while passing, indicating that they wouldn't make a good long-haul ride. Smile and/or wave your hand to return the courtesy.\n\nTrail blazing is on the rise in Turkey lately and nowadays all Turkish regions have waymarked hiking trails of various lengths and shapes. Most of them follow a theme, such as connecting to the sites of an ancient civilization, retracing the footsteps of a historical figure or chasing the treats of a specific regional cuisine. The oldest, and the most popular trail is the Lycian Way, which snakes its way over the mountains backing the Turquoise Coast in the southwest. The website of the Culture Routes Society maintains an up-to-date list of the major hiking trails in the country. Guided tours along some of these trails, often involving hiking the most scenic sections and homestays in the villages, are offered by local travel agencies as well as those based in major cities.\n\nInside the cities, there are white-, or rarely yellow-painted pedestrian crossings (zebra crossing) on the main streets, which are legally pedestrian-priority spots. However, for many drivers, they are little more than ornamental drawings on the road surface, so it is better to cross the streets at the traffic lights. Still, be sure all the cars stopped, because it is not unusual to see the drivers running the first few seconds of the red light. As a safer option, on wide avenues, there are also pedestrian overpasses and underground passages available. In narrow streets during the rush hour, you can cross the street anywhere and anytime, since the traffic moves only intermittently. Also along alleys in the old districts, you need not to worry about keeping on the sidewalk (which is usually too narrow and uneven to be of use anyway); you can walk well in the middle of the street, only to step aside when a car is coming.\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Turkish phrasebook\n\nThe sole official language of Turkey is Turkish.\n\nTurkish is a Turkic language and its closest living relatives are other Turkic languages, which are spoken in southwestern, central and northern Asia, and to a lesser degree by significant communities in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Turkish is an agglutinative language (forming words by adding suffixes to the roots), and the native speakers of the non-agglutinative ones, such as those in the Indo-European family, generally find it difficult to learn. Speakers of Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Manchu and other Turkic languages typically have an easier time picking it up due to their similar grammatical structures. For many centuries, Turkish was written in the Arabic script, evident in many historical texts and documents, but it has been written in the Latin alphabet since 1928. This means that Turkish is now written using the same letters as English, albeit with the addition of Çç, Ğğ, Iı, İi, Öö, Şş and Üü and the exclusions of Qq, Ww and Xx.\n\nKurdish is also spoken by an estimated 7-10% of the population, particularly in the southeast and the east. Language policy towards Kurdish has varied from brutal suppression to government-funded broadcasts, and speaking Kurdish can be seen as a political statement. Several other languages exist, like Laz in the northeast (also spoken in adjacent Georgia), and in general people living near borders will often speak the language of the other side too. For example, many people in Hatay province, bordering Syria, are ethnic Arabs and speak the Syrian dialect of Arabic.\n\nThanks to migration, even in rural areas most villages will have at least one person who has worked in Germany and can thus speak German. The same goes for other Western European languages like Dutch/Flemish or French. Several waves of immigration from the Balkans mean there is also the possibility of coming across native Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, and Albanian speakers mainly in western Turkey. English is also increasingly popular among the younger generation. The \"universities\" that train pupils for a job in tourism pour out thousands of youngsters who want to practice their knowledge on the tourist, with varying degrees of fluency. Language universities produce students that nowadays are pretty good at their chosen language.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Turkish TV series tourism\n\nMany museums and ancient sites in Turkey are closed on Mondays, although there are as many exceptions. The Turkish government offers a museum pass for many sights and museums in Turkey for 2500 TL (Jul 2023); there are also regional passes. Check out what is included, as they don't cover some sights and numerous others can still be seen for free.\n\nAncient ruins and architectural heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the crossroads of civilizations, all parts of Turkey are full of a mindblowing number of ancient ruins.\n\nAlthough Çatalhöyük and Göbekli Tepe, respectively the earliest settlement and the earliest temple ever found to the date in Turkey precede them, the Hittites were the first indigenous people that rose to found a state in Anatolia. They left the proof of their existence at the ruins of Hattuşaş, their capital. The Hittites spoke an Indoeuropean language (the oldest one attested in writing) and were contemporaries of the \"New Kingdom\" of Ancient Egypt, engaged in extensive correspondence and diplomacy with the eastern Mediterranean world.\n\nThe ancient Greeks and the following Romans left their mark mostly in the Aegean and Mediterranean Regions, leaving behind the marble ruins of hundreds of cities, temples, and monuments. Some such as Ephesus and many others along the Aegean are largely restored to their former glory — many of these are on the checklist of most travellers to Turkey. Some more obscure ones off the beaten path such as Aphrodisias and Aizanoi are also well worth visiting.\n\nIn the meantime, some other indigenous peoples, such as the Lycians, were carving beautiful tombs for their dearly departed ones onto the rocky hillsides. Many are fairly well preserved and can be seen all around Lycia.\n\nLegendary Troy stands out as an example of different civilizations literally living on the top of each other. While what is visible today is clearly Hellenistic, the place has its roots as Hittite Wilusa, and later re-built many times over by the ancient Greeks.\n\nPerhaps the most unique \"architectural\" heritage in the country, some of the Cappadocian cave houses and churches carved into \"fairy chimneys\" and underground cities (in a literal sense!) date back to early Christians hiding from persecution.\n\nThe successors of the Romans, the Byzantines broke new ground with more ambitious projects, culminating in grand Hagia Sophia of Istanbul, built in 537 and had the distinction of being the largest cathedral in the world for almost a thousand years. While a stray monastery or two dating back to the era can be found in almost any part of the country, most of the Byzantine heritage intact today is found in the Marmara Region, especially in Istanbul, and in the area around Trabzon in the far northeast, which was the domain of the Empire of Trebizond, a rump Byzantine state that survived the Fall of Constantinople for about a decade.\n\nThe Seljuks found the first Turkish state in Asia Minor and built most of their monuments, which incorporate large majestic portals and heavily delicate stonework reminiscent of some landmarks in parts of Asia, in the major centres of the time in Eastern and Central Anatolia, especially in Konya, their capital.\n\nThe Ottomans, who had considered themselves as a Balkan state until their demise, built most of their landmarks in the Balkans and that region's extension within present-day Turkey, the Marmara Region, just like the Byzantines, whom the Ottomans inspired to in so many ways. Most of the earlier Ottoman monuments were built in Bursa, which have little Byzantine and comperatively large Seljuk influences. Later, the dynasty moved over to Europe — the major landmarks in Edirne exhibit some kind of \"transitional\" and fairly experimental style. However, it wasn't until the Fall of Constantinople that the Ottomans adopted Byzantine architecture almost full scale with some adjustments. Contrary to what may be assumed, though, the Ottoman imperial architecture possibly reached its zenith not in Istanbul, but in Edirne—in the form of Selimiye Mosque, a work of Sinan, the great Ottoman architect of the 16th century.\n\nThe 19th century brought back the Greek and Roman taste of architectural styles, so there was a huge explosion of neo-classical architecture, as much fashionable in Turkey as in the much of the rest of the world at that time. The Galata side of Istanbul, Izmir (though unfortunately most of which was lost to the big fire of 1922), and numerous towns along the coasts, one most prominent and well preserved example being Ayvalık, quickly filled with elegant neo-classical buildings. At the same time, people in the inland locations were favouring pleasant, more traditional, and less pretentious half-timbered whitewashed houses, which form picturesque towns such as Safranbolu, Beypazarı, and Şirince in the northern, central, and western part of the country respectively. It was also this time beautiful and impressive wooden mansions of Istanbul's seaside neighbourhoods and islands were built. Other contemporary trends of the epoch, such as Baroque and Rococo, didn't make much inroads in Turkey, although there were some experiments of combining them into Islamic architecture, as can be seen at Ortaköy Mosque on the banks of the Bosphorus along with some others.\n\nAs the landscapes change the further east you go, so does the architectural heritage. The remote valleys and hilltops of Eastern Karadeniz and Eastern Anatolia are dotted with numerous medieval Georgian and Armenian churches and castles—some of which are nicely well preserved but not all were that lucky. The Armenian cathedral on Akdamar Island of Lake Van and medieval Ani are two that lay somewhere on the midway between perfectly preserved and undergone total destruction, but both are absolutely must-sees if you've made your way to the east. For a change, Southeastern Anatolia features more Middle East-influenced architecture, with arched courtyards and heavy usage of yellow stones with highly exquisite masonry. It's best seen in Urfa, and especially in Mardin and nearby Midyat.\n\nBeing on the crossroads of civilizations more often than not also means being their battleground. So it's no wonder why so many castles and citadels dot the landscape, both in towns and the countryside, coastal or inland. Most of the castles built throughout history are today the main attractions of the towns they are in.\n\nThe 20th century wasn't kind on Turkish cities. Due to the pressure caused by the high rates of rural to urban immigration, many historical neighbourhoods in the cities were knocked down in favour of soulless (and usually, drab ugly) apartment blocks, and the outskirts of the major cities transformed to shantytowns. Examples of modern architecture that could be considered a gem is rather few in Turkey. Steel-and-glass skyscrapers, on the other hand, now steadily rise higher and higher in the major cities, one place where they form a distinctive skyline being the business district of Istanbul, although hardly impressive or unique compared with the traditional skyline of Istanbul's Old City.\n\nItineraries\n\n[edit]\n\nAlong the Troad Coast — ancient legends intertwine with beautiful landscapes and the deep blue Aegean Sea\n\nIstanbul to Izmir — different options to travel between two of Turkey's major cities\n\nLycian Way — walk along the remotest section of the country's Mediterranean coast, past ancient cities, forgotten hamlets, and balmy pine forests\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nBeaches line the entire Mediterranean coast, but those with well-developed resorts are between Alanya to the east and Kuşadası on the Aegean coast to the west. There are scores more small places that only locals head for, such as the Gulf of Saros, handy for Istanbul. The Marmara and Black Sea beaches are not worth seeking out.\n\nNargile (hooka or water pipe) – Once upon a time, the nargile, or Turkish water pipe, was the centre of Istanbul’s social and political life. Today some of the locals still consider it one of life’s great pleasures and is something interesting to try.\n\nHamams and geothermal spas – A visit to a hamam or Turkish bath is an essential part of any trip to Turkey and is something you'll be sure to repeat before leaving. There is at least one historical hamam in each neighborhood of Istanbul and other large cities. Take care in selecting a hamam, as they can vary greatly in cleanliness. Most places will offer a scrubbing and/or a massage. Just being in the Hamam (as a sauna), is enough for seeing and experiencing the place, but the scrubbing is a great experience. The massage is not necessarily better than those found in western countries. Many hamams cater for tourists nowadays and are widely overpriced, mind them. A traditional and authentic hamam does not have to be expensive and certainly you would not pay in euros there. If you are doing a long road trip with your own wheels check whether there is a geothermal spa near your route, as these can be good for a relaxing break or overnight stop.\n\nWinter sports – Not what you might expect here, but the mountainous interior of Turkey has bitter-cold winters with reliable snow cover. Some popular resorts in the northwest are Uludağ near Bursa, Kartepe near Izmit, Kartalkaya near Bolu and Ilgaz near Kastamonu; in the northeast are Palandöken near Erzurum and Sarıkamış near Kars; and central is Erciyes near Kayseri. At Saklıkent near Antalya you're supposed to be able to ski in the morning then reach the Med for a swim in the afternoon, but its snow cover is brief and unreliable.\n\nWatch football – Süper Lig is soccer's top tier in Turkey, with 16 teams playing August to May. Istanbul has six teams at this level and Ankara has two. The national team usually play home games at Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul.\n\nCycling – The premier race is the President's Tour of Turkey, held over a week in April.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Turkey has a long standing problem with inflation and as of 2023 any prices quoted in the Turkish lira might have gone outdated already, so take them with a grain of salt, especially if there is any doubt that they might not have been updated for a while. Some Wikivoyage articles provide additional rough estimates in hard currencies, usually in euros, alongside the lira. These provide a better indication of the actual costs, but it shouldn't be taken as a suggestion whether non-Turkish currency will be accepted as a form of payment.\n\nMoney\n\n[edit]\n\nExchange rates for Turkish lira\n\nAs of January 2024:\n\nUS$1 ≈ 30 TL\n\n€1 ≈ 32 TL\n\nUK£1 ≈ 38 TL\n\nAU$1 ≈ 20 TL\n\nCA$1 ≈ 22 TL\n\nJapanese ¥100 ≈ 20 TL\n\nExchange rates fluctuate. Current rates for these and other currencies are available from XE.com\n\nThe currency of the country is the Turkish lira, denoted by the symbol \"₺\" or \"TL\" (ISO code: TRY). Wikivoyage articles will use TL to denote the currency. The lira is divided into 100 kuruş (abbreviated kr).\n\nIn 2005, Turkey dropped six zeroes from its currency, thus making each post-2005 lira worth one million pre-2005 lira (or so called \"old lira\"). Don't be confused if you see the currency symbolised YTL or ytl, standing for yeni lira). Pre-2009 banknotes and coins (those bearing yeni lira and yeni kuruş) are not legal tender, and can no longer be exchanged at banks.\n\nThe new Turkish lira symbol, , was created by the Central Bank in 2012 after a country-wide contest.\n\nBanknotes of Turkey are issued in denominations of ₺5, ₺10, ₺20, ₺50, ₺100 and ₺200. Coins of Turkey are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 kuruş (silver ring with yellow center), ₺1 (yellow ring with silver center) and ₺5 (yellowish ring with silver center).\n\nVisitors may not export more than 25,000 TL or its equivalent in foreign currencies.\n\nCurrency exchange\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are legal exchange offices in all cities and almost any town. Banks also exchange money, but they are not worth the hassle as they are usually crowded and do not give better rates than exchange offices. It can seem that Turkey has more currency exchange offices per-capita than anywhere else in the world, leading to fierce competition for exchange rates. This is due to uncertainty in the value of the Turkish lira, which results in residents regularly exchanging Turkish lira into more stable stores of values such as US Dollars and Euros.\n\nYou can see the rates an office offers on the (usually electronic) boards located somewhere near its gate. To get the best rate, look for shops with the smallest difference between their buy and sell rates for a given currency pair (buy-sell spread). Euros and US dollars are the most useful currencies, with often less than a 1% buy-sell spread. But pounds sterling (good luck with getting any non-Bank of England notes deemed higher value than Monopoly money), Canadian dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen, Saudi riyals, and a number of other currencies are also not very hard to exchange for a good rate. Currency exchange offices typically do not charge a commission (unlike ATMs with Dynamic Currency Conversion services), with the notable exception of offices in airports.\n\nIt is important to remember that most exchangers accept only banknotes, it can be very hard to exchange foreign coins. In some places, where there is a meaningful explanation for it, more uncommon currencies may also be exchanged, e.g. Australian dollars in Çanakkale where the annual Anzac WWI commemorations take place. As a general rule, if a place attracts many visitors from a country, then it is usually possible to exchange that country’s currency there.\n\nTourism-oriented industries in tourism-oriented towns, as well as shops where big amounts of money change hands, like supermarkets, in most parts of the country, generally accept foreign currency (usually limited to Euro and American dollars only), but the rates they accept the currency are usually worse than those of exchange offices. Ask if they accept foreign currency.\n\nCredit cards\n\n[edit]\n\nVisa and MasterCard are widely accepted, American Express much less so. Most credit card users have to enter their PIN codes when using their cards if above a certain amount (250 TL). Older, magnetic card holders are excepted from this, but remember that, unlike some other places in Europe, salespeople have the legal right to ask you to show a valid ID with a photo on to prove that you are the owner of the card.\n\nATMs\n\n[edit]\n\nCash machines are scattered throughout the cities, concentrated in central parts. It is possible to draw Turkish lira (and sometimes US dollars or/and euros) from these ATMs with your foreign Visa, Mastercard or Maestro card (not necessarily a credit card). Any major town has at least one ATM.\n\nATMs ask whether to provide instructions in English or in Turkish (and sometimes some other languages, too) as soon as you insert a foreign card (or a Turkish card which is not the operating bank’s own).\n\nIn Turkey, two types of ATMs exist: dynamic currency conversion (DCC ATMs) advertising that they offer multiple currencies, and regular ATMs without DCC (only offering Turkish Lira and generally located next to a bank branch). DCC ATMs will charge extortionate currency exchange rates (markups of 5-10% or an excessive ATM fee) that are generally impossible to decline. Whenever possible, you should only use a regular ATM without DCC, as they will usually default back to your bank's currency conversion rate and markup (which is virtually always more favourable) and in many cases, will not even incur an ATM use surcharge. If a screen pops up offering you a currency conversion rate/markup, decline it.\n\nIn central locations, you may encounter standalone buildings housing many ATMs, marketing themselves (using a logo) as being DCC ATMs or offering euros. These ATMs offer a direct currency conversion (DCC) into your home currency (€, US$, etc.), so you will then be charged in your home currency and not in Turkish Lira. This is best to avoid since the rates offered are considerably far worse than what your bank would charge you for the Turkish Lira you're about to withdraw. Wherever possible, you should use ATMs connected to bank branches that do not have a DCC logo, as these often do not charge commission or force DCC. Non-DCC ATMs for some banks may not even charge an ATM fee.\n\nSpecific costs for ATM withdrawals depend on your foreign bank, but many ATMs in Turkey add a commission / fee on-top of the dispensed amount (even for US dollar and euro withdrawals), which is then together charged to you bank. In the following an overview of banks and charges:\n\nZiraat, HSBC: no ATM fee (as of 2021)\n\nHalkbank: no ATM fee\n\nodeabank: no ATM fee nor DCC offered\n\nSekerbank: no ATM fee\n\nTEB: 2.1%\n\nTürkiye Bankasi: 2.9%\n\nDenizBank and VakifBank: 3%\n\nGaranti BBVA: 5% (as of 2021)\n\nAKBank: 7.95%\n\nQNB: US$5\n\nShopping\n\n[edit]\n\nBeware: Always ask for the price ahead if it is not displayed anywhere, even if it is just for a çay. It is an extremely common practice to overcharge tourists, oftentimes 5 to 10 times the price. Furthermore, it seems a common scheme to give the wrong change, especially to the absent-minded tourist. So, always have in mind what you are supposed to receive as change and double-check immediately. Besides that never hand over a large note just like that; sometimes the change is then given on a supposedly obtained smaller note and the merchant will insist on having just received a small note. Paying by credit card will not render you immune to short-change scams, as some vendors are often set up to charge in Euros and US Dollars in addition to Turkish liras, and some vendors will go as far as to charge you the price quoted in a different currency (i.e. by entering 100 EUR rather than 100 TL into the credit card terminal). Do your best to only use large banknotes at established, reputable businesses, and to pay in near-exact change where possible.\n\nApart from classical tourist souvenirs like postcards and trinkets, here are a few of what you can bring back home from Turkey.\n\nLeather clothing — Turkey is the biggest leather producer in the world, so the leather clothing is cheaper than elsewhere. Many shops in Laleli, Beyazıt, Mahmutpaşa districts of Istanbul (all around the tram line which goes through Sultanahmet Square) are specialized on leather.\n\nCarpets and kilims — Many regions in Turkey produce handmade kilims and carpets. Though the symbols and figures differentiate depending on the region in which the carpet is produced, they are generally symbolic expressions based on ancient Anatolian religions and/or nomadic Turkic life which takes shape around shamanic beliefs more than 1,000 years ago. You can find shops specialized on handmade carpets and kilims in any major city, tourist spot and Sultanahmet Area.\n\nYou seriously cannot go anywhere in Turkey without someone trying to sell you a carpet. People will approach you on the street, engage in a little friendly conversation about where you're from, how do you like Turkey, and \"would you like to come with me to my uncle's shop? It's just around the corner, and has the best authentic kilims.\" It can be irritating if you let it get to you, but remember that a large part of these people's economy comes from tourist's wallets so you can't blame them for trying.\n\nSilk — Dresses and scarves. Although can be found in many parts of the country, silk fans should head for Bursa and before that, pick up basics of bargaining.\n\nEarthenware — Handmade Cappadocian pottery (amphoras, old-style plates, flowerpots etc.) are made of local salty clay. Salt content of clay, thanks to salt spray produced by the Salt Lake –which is the second largest lake in Turkey- in the heartland of Central Anatolia, is what makes local earthenware top quality. In some Cappadocian towns, it is possible to see how these artifacts are produced, or even to experience producing one, at the dedicated workshops. Tiles with classical Ottoman motives that are produced in Kütahya are also famous.\n\nTurkish delight and Turkish coffee — If you like these during your Turkey trip, don’t forget to take a few packages back home. Available everywhere. Turkish coffee is best purchased from a local grocery store with listed prices; grocery stores and tourist-oriented stores generally use the same suppliers, but the latter charges a significant mark-up for the boutique experience and nicer packaging.\n\nHoney — The pine honey (çam balı) of Marmaris is famous and has a much stronger taste and consistency than regular flower honeys. Although not easily available, if you can get your hands on it, don't miss the honey of Macahel valley, made out of flowers of a temperate rainforest almost completely out of human impact in the far northeastern Black Sea Region. Nearby Anzer in the highlands is also famous for its honey, perhaps easier to obtain. The same region also features deli bal (\"mad honey\"), from the toxic rhododendron flowers, with hallucinogenic effects — overindulging in it may cause serious health complications.\n\nCheck your country's import regulations for agricultural products if you intend to take any amount of Turkish honey home.\n\nChestnut dessert — Made out of syrup and chestnuts grown on the foothills of Mt. Uludağ, chestnut dessert (kestane şekeri) is a famous and tasty product of Bursa. There are many variations, such as chocolate coated ones. Chestnut dessert can be found in elsewhere, too, but relatively more expensive and in smaller packages.\n\nMeerschaum souvenirs — Despite its name meaning “sea foam” which it resembles, meerschaum (lületaşı) is extracted only in one place in the world: landlocked Eskişehir province in the extreme northwest part of Central Anatolia Region. This rock, similar to gypsum at sight, is carved into smoking pipes and cigarette holders. It has a soft and creamy texture and makes for a great decorative item. Available at some shops in Eskişehir.\n\nCastile (olive oil) soap — Natural, a silky touch on your skin, and a warm Mediterranean atmosphere in your bathroom. Absolutely cheaper than those to be found in Northern and Western Europe. Street markets in the Aegean Region and southern Marmara Region is full of olive oil soap, almost all of which are handmade. Even some old folk in the Aegean Region is producing their castile soaps in the traditional way: during or just after the olive harvest, neighbours gather in yards around large boilers heated by wood fire, then lye derived from the wood ash is added to hot water and olive oil mix. Outside of the Aegean region, note that many tourist/souvenir shops are selling the same Olive oil s"
