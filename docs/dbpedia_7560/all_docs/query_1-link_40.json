        "text": "French company Thales has secured a contract from Armco for the delivery of track circuits for different lines in Turkey.\n\nUnder the contract, Thales will supply, install and commission TTC track circuits on the Çerkezköy-Kapıkule section.\n\nThe TTC track circuit will deliver information for predictive maintenance of the system, as well as help detect the occupation, presence, and departure of a train in a given area to make rail operations safe.\n\nThe Çerkezköy-Kapıkule section is said to be the first phase of the Halkalı-Kapıkule railway project.\n\nHalkalı-Kapıkule project is being constructed to link the country’s railway network with the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) via Bulgaria.\n\nThales is also upgrading the Isparta-Burdur-Denizli line with the installation of signalling and telecommunications systems.\n\nThales TTC track circuit will also be deployed on a 234km stretch of conventional single track.\n\nIsparta-Burdur-Denizli line, which has 21 stations, is being prepared to achieve speeds of up to 160km/h.\n\nLast month, Thales won a long-term services (LTSS) contract from Singapore-based SMRT Trains to continue the availability of its SelTrac communication-based train control (CBTC) signalling system on the North-South and East-West lines in the country."
