        "text": "As a global player in the paints and coatings industry, Jotun's R&D initiatives are tied to the latest trends in the different corners of the world. Quite often, a new Jotun innovation will arise at a local level and then go through several stages of development and testing before being implemented on a local, regional, or global scale.\n\nTo support these processes and our operations throughout the world, Jotun's R&D network has a truly global presence with several regional laboratories. Our regional R&D hubs include Europe, East Europe and Central Asia, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia and the Americas.\n\nEurope\n\nJotun's European R&D team is anchored by the new main facility in Sandefjord, Norway and complemented by the facility in the UK.\n\nNorway\n\nThe heart of our R&D initiative lies in our new central facility located in Sandefjord, Norway. The state of the art R&D centre opened in 2020 and is home to one of the most advanced analytical laboratories in Norway. Here, you'll find the latest and most innovative research equipment in the field such as heavy centrifuges, heating furnaces, seawater test tanks, and Scanning Electron Microscopes. Approximately 270 scientists work out of this facility, which is the regional lab for Jotun in Scandinavia and Western Europe.\n\nOur main R&D centre in Norway is where we develop technology platforms and global formulations for our four main product segments. These technologies will often be modified in the regional laboratories to meet specific local needs. The Sandefjord R&D facility also actively supports and controls the development work done in the regional labs.\n\nOne of our largest initiatives in Sandefjord focuses on the development of antifouling for ships. To stay ahead of the competition in the marine market, we are continually looking at ways to improve both the antifouling polymer and the final coating, both of which pose very demanding technical challenges. Amongst the other important strategic technologies developed at Sandefjord are polymers for decorative paints and tinting colourants for Jotun Multicolor systems.\n\nTo further support product development both in Sandefjord and regionally, the R&D centre houses several teams of experts within the fields of:\n\nPigment and colour technology\n\nChemical analysis\n\nBiology\n\nHSE issues\n\nProduct testing\n\nPatenting\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn March of 2017, we opened a brand-new dedicated intumescent R&D facility in Flixborough, UK. This facility was specifically designed to support and develop the two main intumescent product ranges of Jotachar and SteelMaster, as well as the insulation product, Jotatherm TB550. This facility works closely with the previously established intumescent R&D facility in Dubai, UAE, the central R&D centre in Sandefjord, as well as selected regional labs.\n\nThe Flixborough facility boasts two large fire testing furnaces designed to house specimens of up to five meters in length. Beyond exhaustive fire testing, this location also has the capability to test resistance to cryogenic spills as well as testing environmental durability to all key standards down to temperatures of -40°C.\n\nThe UK centre enables easy access for extensive 3rd party testing, classification societies and safety specialists.\n\nEast Europe and Central Asia\n\nTurkey\n\nThe Jotun R&D centre in Turkey was opened in January 2017 at the Jotun Cerkezkoy factory location. The centre’s R&D activities focus on three key segments: Decorative paints and powder and protective coatings.\n\nThe development work conducted here is vitally important in supporting the East Europe and Central Asia region. The proximity to the market provides excellent market understanding and opportunities to ensure the development is tailored to our customers’ needs.\n\nAmongst the main roles and responsibilities at our facility in Turkey are:\n\nResponsible for developing new products mainly for the region\n\nMaintain, modify and/or make improvements to existing products\n\nTesting alternative raw materials for cost saving/logistic improvements\n\nTechnical support to all segments\n\nColour support, formulations work\n\nMiddle East\n\nThrough our R&D centres in the UAE and India, we're able to stay connected to the Middle East markets and quickly respond to evolving local market trends.\n\nDubai\n\nFirst opened in 1992, the Jotun regional laboratory in Dubai focuses on R&D initiatives for decorative, protective, intumescent and floor coating products. A new regional headquarter including a state-of-the-art R&D centre will open in early 2022.\n\nApart from its core functions, the regional laboratory in Dubai serves as a valuable support system in a few ways - such as providing technical support, product information and troubleshooting services to sales staff across the region.\n\nResponsible for developing new products for the region\n\nMaintain, modify and/or make improvements to existing products\n\nTesting alternative raw materials for cost saving/logistic improvements\n\nProvide technical support to local quality control labs and production, also to local sales and marketing in the region, including solving complaints where needed\n\nProvide training on product knowledge to all support functions (sales, marketing and lab staff) and new employees\n\nColour support, formulations work\n\nIndia\n\nThe regional laboratory in Pune, India was established in 2012 and primarily focuses on decorative paints, performance coatings, and powder coatings. Future development plans for the lab will see increased operations and staff for all three areas.\n\nThe main responsibilities at this facility include:\n\nProduct adjustments to meet local requests and cost\n\nTesting and introduction of local raw materials\n\nTechnology cooperation with UICT (Mumbai University Institute of Chemical Technology) and IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)\n\nSouth East Asia\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe R&D centre in Malaysia was established in 1994 and is currently located at the Jotun factory in Shah Alam. The centre houses over 20 R&D staff members who are dedicated to enhancing both decorative and protective coatings products. They also provide valuable support to companies in the SEAP region.\n\nTheir primary roles and responsibilities include:\n\nResponsible for developing new products for the region\n\nMaintain, modify and/or make improvements to existing products\n\nTesting alternative raw materials for cost saving/logistic improvements\n\nProvide technical support to local quality control labs and production, also to local sales and marketing in the region, including solving complaints where needed\n\nProvide training on product knowledge to all support functions (sales, marketing and lab staff) and new employees\n\nColour support, formulations work\n\nThailand\n\nJotun's R&D efforts in Thailand are housed in the regional laboratory, which first opened in 1999. This laboratory is responsible for the R&D initiatives in the powder coatings units in Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nThe laboratory is closely connected to commercial activity in the region by researching and evaluating raw materials to determine if they are suitable for the SEAP region. It also offers support for customers’ projects and performs product development initiatives. It also organizes and implements global product launches throughout the SEAP region.\n\nNorth East Asia\n\nOur R&D centres in China and South Korea perform a multitude of functions including product development and testing, colour support, and technical support in the area.\n\nChina\n\nThe largest R&D centre outside Norway is located at the coatings factory in Zhangjiagang. First opened in 2006, this facility houses 58 highly trained and dedicated staff members who cover four key segments: Decorative, Marine, Powder, and Protective Coatings.\n\nTheir work encompasses developing and enhancing existing product lines and providing support throughout the North East Asia region. Their proximity to the market gives them an excellent insight into evolving market trends and opportunities to adapt to meet customer-specific needs.\n\nTheir primary role and responsibilities include:\n\nDeveloping new global and regional products\n\nMaintain, modify and/or make improvements to existing products\n\nColour support, formulations work\n\nRegional Process Engineer and Testing and Documentation Specialist\n\nTechnical support to all segments\n\nSouth Korea\n\nFirst opened in 1992, the regional laboratory in Busan, South Korea was designed as a centre for product modifications and technical support. A formal laboratory was later established in 1998, followed soon after by the Far East regional laboratory for product development in 1999.\n\nCentrally located, less than a two-hour drive from all major South Korean shipyards, this facility lends itself to fast and responsive customer support. And like the other Jotun centres in the region, its closeness to the markets provides excellent opportunities to stay on top of regional market trends.\n\nThe main role and responsibilities include:\n\nFocus on product development, product adjustments and technical customer support\n\nAll product development focus on the areas of marine and protective coatings\n\nAmericas\n\nOur only R&D presence in the Americas is the facility in the United States. Here we focus on marine and protective coatings as well as assisting with monitoring legislative changes in the region.\n\nUSA\n\nThe Jotun US regional laboratory was established in Louisiana in 2001. The lab develops marine and protective coatings for the North American region in addition to assisting with processing the Brazilian factory. Early 2022 the regional laboratory will be relocated to Houston where the rest of the core US/Americas team is located.\n\nDue to the stringent VOC (volatile organic compounds) regulations in the US and Canada, this laboratory plays a vital role in monitoring legislative changes in the US and ensuring all coatings in the region comply with those requirements."
