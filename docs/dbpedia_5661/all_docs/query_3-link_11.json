        "text": "Over the past 15 years, HRH Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan has established himself as a leading figure in the international sports movement. He is currently a Member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), President of the Jordan Olympic Committee (JOC), Chair of the IOC’s Prevention of Harassment and Abuse in Sport Working Group, Vice-Chair of the IOC’s Women in Sport Commission and a member of several other IOC commissions. He is also Founder and Chairman of the peace-building NGO, Generations For Peace.\n\nPrince Feisal’s stellar sports administration career began as Chair of the Pan Arab Games Organising Committee in 1999. He was then elected as President of the JOC in 2003, helping lead the organisation’s independence from the government. His dedication to promoting and improving sport in Jordan over the past 15 years was richly rewarded when the Kingdom secured its first-ever Olympic medal with Ahmad Abughaush’s taekwondo gold at the Olympic Games Rio 2016. This landmark event was the catalyst for the introduction of the new National Strategy for Sport in January 2017, which is already having a significant impact on the development of grassroots and elite sport in Jordan.\n\nIn 2007, Prince Feisal launched Generations For Peace (GFP). GFP was founded as a peace-through-sport initiative, using sport as a tool to promote a sense of understanding and unity in high-conflict areas. The impact its work has made in the last decade has been remarkable, and this was acknowledged in January 2018 when GFP was ranked 30th in the global NGO Advisor Top 500 NGOs list, and second in the overall peace-building list.\n\nPrince Feisal was elected an IOC Member in 2010, which served to accelerate and increase his commitment to serving the wider Olympic Movement. He was appointed to the IOC’s Public Affairs and Social Development through Sport Commission in 2015, giving him the opportunity to use his success with Generations For Peace on a global scale. The Commission advises the IOC on strategies to promote the role of sport and Olympism in society beyond the Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2006, Prince Feisal was appointed to the IOC’s Women in Sport Commission, which advises the IOC on the development and implementation of the IOC women and sport policy and promotes equal opportunities for girls and women to participate in, and benefit from sport and physical activity. As a leading advocate for gender equality and empowerment of girls and women in Jordan, the Middle East and worldwide, he was appointed Vice-Chair in 2015.\n\nPrince Feisal is also on the IOC’s Coordination Commission for the upcoming Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, as well as the IOC Broadcast Rights Commission for the MENA region. In 2017, he was also appointed to the IOC’s Digital and Technology Commission.\n\nPrince Feisal’s innate understanding about the role of sport to help drive social development and peace is matched by his compassion surrounding deep-rooted and sensitive issues in sport. In 2014, he was appointed Chair of the new IOC Prevention of Harassment and Abuse in Sport Working Group. At the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) General Assembly in November 2017, Prince Feisal launched the IOC toolkit for safeguarding athletes from harassment and abuse in sport. The toolkit aims to provide solutions and guidance for sporting organisations based on experience and expertise from all over the world. Prince Feisal has since spoken passionately on this topic at Olympic Movement gatherings, including the Global Association of International Sport Federations (GAISF) General Assembly in April 2018, inspiring International Sports Federations to adopt the toolkit themselves.\n\nPrince Feisal also serves on the Executive Board of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and is Chairman of the OCA’s Peace Through Sport Committee. Over the past decade, Prince Feisal has been committed to fostering the use of sport for peace and development across the diverse Asian continent.\n\nOutside his work with the JOC and Generations For Peace, Prince Feisal is a motorsport enthusiast. Since 2004, he has served as Chairman of Jordan Motorsport. In the past 30 years, he has helped its development throughout the country. The growth of motorsport was boosted significantly by the successful bid, led by Prince Feisal, for Jordan to be included as a stage on the prestigious Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) World Rally Championships calendar in 2008. Prince Feisal was elected a member of the FIA Senate in 2013 as a mobility candidate and was re-elected in 2017 as a sports candidate.\n\nPrince Feisal’s holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Brown University and a Masters in Management degree from the esteemed London Business School."
