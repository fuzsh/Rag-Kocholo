        "text": "Poor Legitimacy\n\nState legitimacy was undermined by three critical factors, including flawed political participation, sectarian politics, and the regional power’s intervention in Iraq. These factors provided a condition that brought all three elements of Iraq’s insurgency—the Baathists, domestic jihadis, and foreign jihadi fighters—together, facilitating their interaction and evolution into IS.\n\nPolitical participation in post-Saddam Iraq can be examined in three phases: the pre-2005 election phase, the 2005 election phase, and the post-election phase. The pre-election phase consists of the period from the U.S. invasion in March 2003 until the transitional election in January 2005. The election phase includes a time frame between the transitional election in January and the first general election in December 2005. The post-election phase encompasses a time frame from 2006 to the end of Noori al-Maliki’s second term in office in 2014.\n\nAccording to the three fundamental sources of legitimacy, including tradition, charisma, and rational law (Weber 1958), Iraq lacked both the traditional and charismatic sources of legitimation and, meanwhile, failed to develop a rational-legal legitimacy in the three phases of state-building. The Coalition force’s initial state-building agenda was the establishment of a rational-legal state grounded in modern laws and procedures, rather Page 130 →than building a political system in which the obedience of people would be based on the capacity of a leader or an established tradition or religious system (Azeez 2010). In other words, the Coalition took a policy of improving political participation as the main force of enhancing the state legitimacy (Rothstein 2009; Weatherford 1992, 150).\n\nPolitical participation relates to a power-sharing mechanism that reinforces the legitimacy of the state as a recognized property of state-society relations and political order (Brinkerhoff et al. 2012, 274). Political participation, in this sense, provides a condition under which the citizens voluntarily accept state authority and obey laws, which in turn enables the state to exercise power through consent rather than coercion (Brinkerhoff et al. 2012, 274; OECD 2010, 7). A low level of political participation disrupts state-society relations, making the exercise of state power difficult if not impossible. In the absence of meaningful state-society relations, the dissatisfied communities stop obeying the law and rebel (Brinkerhoff et al. 2012, 275–76; Rothstein 2009, 319–23). While the legitimation of the political system in Iraq through political participation and good governance was a priority, in theory, the Coalition failed to develop such legitimizing bases in practice.\n\nIn the pre-election phase, the main decisions were made on the sectarian basis that mostly led to the marginalization of Sunni Arabs, on the one hand, and the exacerbation of the sectarian divide, on the other. Therefore elections, which were presumed as an effective tool of political participation, resulted in the polarization of the society, sectarian-based voting, and eventually ineffective government (al-Tamimi and Grisham 2013; Stansfield 2007, 182–91). In this phase of state-building, the CPA created the IGC parallel to enforcing the policy of the de-Baathification of Iraq’s military and civil services. The IGC was comprised of 25 members, including 16 Shiites, 5 Kurds, 5 Sunnis, 1 Assyrian, and 1 Turkmen. Meanwhile, it was a coalition of six parties, including two Shiite (Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim’s SCIRI and Ibrahim al-Jafari’s Dawa), two Kurdish (Massoud Barani’s KDP and Jalal Talabani’s PUK), and two pro-American (Ayad Alawi’s INA and Ahmed Chalabi’s INC) parties (Stansfield 2007, 169). The Shiite and Kurd members of the IGC were influential politicians, while the Sunni members included individuals like Naseer Chderchi and Adnan Pachachi that were disconnected from the society and were viewed by Sunnis as elements of the process of “disempowering Sunni Arabs for the benefit of Shiites and Kurds” (Stansfield 2007, 170). This means the IGC as the first domestic Page 131 →governing body was exclusively dominated by Shiites and Kurds, while the Sunni members were added to the council to only give it a national face.\n\nThe marginalization of Sunni Arabs in the first phase of state-building extended with the formation of the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) in June 2004. The IIG, which replaced both the CPA and IGC, was stacked from top to bottom with politicians from IGC (Stansfield 2007, 175). Shiites and Kurds were placed in leading positions, with only “the celebratory position of the President given to a Sunni Arab returnee from London, Ghazi al-Yawer” (Stansfield 2007, 175). This process, which was designed by the CPA, led to the further polarization of politics and eroded any legitimacy of the new state in the eyes of Sunni Arabs. In all, the CPA’s legacy to Iraq was to move the country from being ideological under Saddam to become divided along ethnic and sectarian lines after his removal (Stansfield 2007, 169).\n\nThe exclusion of Sunnis from politics became more evident in the second phase of state-building from the transitional election to the conclusion of the general election (January to December 2005). During the two elections, the electoral system was designed with the presumption of sectarian voting, all electoral camps were formed along sectarian lines, and the people voted based on their sectarian ties (Dawisha 2009, 252–53; Stansfield 2007, 182–91). The January 2005 election to form a transitional government was boycotted by the Sunni Arab parties because they claimed that they were marginalized “in the pre-election political process,” and therefore did “not have equal access to resources to compete with the opposition groups” (Arvanitis 2006, 531). The outcome of the boycott was a low turnout in Sunni areas. For example, the turnout in Mosul was as low as 10 percent, and most of those were Kurds (Stansfield 2007, 182–91). The pattern was repeated in Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Fallujah, and parts of Baghdad. In contrast, the turnout in Kurd areas was as high as 90 percent and in Shiite areas around 80 percent (Stansfield 2007, 182–91). The election result was far from satisfying for the Sunni Arab communities that used to rule the country since its creation in the 1920s (Stansfield 2007, 182–91). While the Iraqi List, the major Sunni Arab party in the elections, won only 13 percent of the votes, the Shiites and Kurds won 48 and 25 percent, respectively (Stansfield 2007, 182–91). As a result, the transitional parliament and government were largely polarized, with Sunni Arabs being isolated in both.\n\nThe sectarian divide was also present in the general election in December.Page 132 → During the campaigns, the Shiite UIA hardly bothered electioneering in the Kurdish areas, and Kurd candidates avoided campaigning in the southern Shiite or the central Sunni Arab provinces. The election results show that Kurdish parties captured 100 percent of the vote in Kurdish areas, Sunni parties garnered 88 percent of the vote in Sunni areas, and Shiite parties received 86 percent of the vote in Shiite areas (Dawisha and Diamond 2006, 100). As a result, the Shiite UIA formed the government after they won 46.5 percent of the parliamentary seats and the Kurdish Alliance received more than 19 percent, while the Concord Front of Sunnis received only 16 percent of the seats (Dawisha and Diamond 2006, 99).\n\nRegardless of violent threats by AQI, which denounced the elections as a “satanic project that violates God’s law,” Sunni participation in the general election showed a remarkable increase, with a turnout of 70 percent of registered voters (Pan 2005; White and Neuman 2005). The Sunnis’ cooperation and high turnout raised hopes that they would join the political process to build a new political system and diminish the insurgency (Pan 2005). Nevertheless, Maliki’s sectarian agenda and the Sunnis’ minimal role under his premiership challenged the formation of an inclusive and legitimate government in Baghdad. The marginalization of Sunnis in democratic institutions increased their demand for alternative measures in Sunni communities (Arvanitis 2006, 549–50). Joining the insurgency was a difficult but straightforward option.\n\nFinally, in the post-election phase, state legitimacy eroded more than before in Sunni areas because of the Sunnis’ further marginalization from the political participation processes (O’Driscoll 2015). In the general election, the Accord Front of Sunni Arabs had won 44 of the parliament’s 275 seats, which allowed it to secure the position of the deputy prime minister and six cabinet ministries in Maliki’s coalition government that was announced on May 20, 2006 (Tran 2007; With the New Government 2006). However, the Accord withdrew from the government in August 2007, accusing Maliki’s party of not consulting the Accord ministers on key issues (Tran 2007). Following its withdrawal from the government, the head of the Accord, Adnan al-Dulaimi, announced that they “don’t want to take part in a government which claims it is a national unity one, but instead is sectarian rather than Iraqi” (Tran 2007). Although the Accord rejoined the government a year later, sectarianism and sectarian-based decision-making in the government were prevalent during Maliki’s terms in office.\n\nPage 133 →During his first term in office (2006–2010), for instance, Maliki concentrated on the marginalization of his Sunni and Kurd opponents from power. During his second term, the prime minister invested heavily in the personalization of power and the elimination of his opponents more intensely (2010–2014). In this period, he occupied the positions of the minister of defense, the minister of interior, the minister of state for national security, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, all besides his role as prime minister (O’Driscoll 2015, 7). In his second term in office, Maliki not only used the official sources of coercion for controlling his opponents but also mounted undemocratic attacks like terrorism and treason accusations against them. His campaign of excluding and eliminating his opponents started with the trial of the Sunni vice president, Tariq al-Hashimi, who was charged with “running death squads” and sentenced to death in absence after fleeing to Turkey (O’Driscoll 2015, 7). Similar accusations and arrests were followed by the arrest of many staff and bodyguards of the Sunni finance minister, Rafie al-Issawi, and the arrest of the al-Iraqiya MP, Ahmed al-Alwani, on terrorism charges (O’Driscoll 2015, 7). Maliki’s sectarian campaign and amalgamation of power under his command led to further intensification of Sunni extremism, Kurd separatism, and the shrinking of his government legitimacy beyond Shiite communities (O’Driscoll 2015, 1–18).\n\nDue to the lack of broad-based political participation, state legitimacy in the three phases of the post-Saddam state-building could not solidify in all corners of Iraq’s society. State-society relations, particularly the relationship between the Sunni society and the Shiite-led government, remained highly fragile. This process created a political atmosphere that made Sunnis receptive to the Sunni insurgency and allowed the insurgency to expand in Sunni areas against a government that they did not recognize as legitimate (Boot 2014).\n\nIn this environment, when “Sunnis saw that their only chance of surviving in Iraq was to fight as Sunnis against a US-sponsored Shiite-led government,” the insurgency played a far more prominent role than any of the Iraqi governmental or military organizations in the Sunni Triangle (Cockburn 2014, 69; O’Driscoll 2015, 1). This situation facilitated the recruitment of jihadi organizations from the Sunni communities and, meanwhile, increased the desire for unification as a requirement for success. Thus the failure in building a broad-based and legitimate state in all three phases of political development in post-Saddam Iraq provided a condition highly favorable to Islamist insurgency and its transformation into IS.\n\nPage 134 →Taken together, the pre-election phase reinforced Zarqawi’s so-called anti-Crusader-Safavid campaign and contributed to his Iraqification of AQI. The term Safavid or Safawi originally refers to the Iranian Safawi dynasty (1501–1722), which was used by Zarqawi to describe the alleged Iranian influence and to discredit Iraq’s Shiite citizens as aliens. By using the term Crusader-Safavid alliance, Zarqawi referred to the alliance between the allied force and the post-Saddam Shiite-led Iraqi government (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 15–16; Graham 2005; Miller and Marshall 2005, 1). In this period, Zarqawi successfully sunk roots in the Sunni Triangle by interacting with and intensively recruiting from the dissatisfied Sunni communities.\n\nLikewise, the second phase of state-building contributed to further radicalization of Sunnis and increased their sympathy to the insurgency as an alternative means of politics, compared to the democratic process that was only capable of producing a sectarian-based regime in favor of the Shiite parties. Finally, the Iraqi state’s legitimacy was gravely deteriorated during the third phase of the political process due to Maliki’s personalization of power and his usage of military force and political accusations against Sunni politicians. In this phase, the scattered insurgent and jihadi organizations were motivated to unify under a religious banner that could operate more effectively. The unification of AQI with five other insurgent groups, including Jaish al-Taifa al-Mansurah, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah, Saray al-Jihad Group, al-Ghuraba Brigades, and al-Ahwal Brigades under the MSM umbrella organization in January 2006, was an outcome of this situation (Lister 2014, 8). MSM was rebranded as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in October 2006. Thus in the face of the Coalition’s failure in building a state through democratic participation, the Sunni insurgency expanded as an alternative force to create a state based on religious legitimacy.\n\nBesides the failed political participation process, the exacerbation of sectarian politics in this period also had its roots in the Coalition’s de-Baathification policy, which put an estimated 400,000 employees of the security and 100,000 employees of the civil sector out of work (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 3; Galbraith 2006, 119; Sly 2015). This policy helped Shiites and Kurds replace the traditional Sunni rulers, which escalated group grievance in Sunni communities in which both the newly established government and its security force hardly found support. According to U.S. army trainers in Iraq, only people in the Shiite-dominated greater Page 135 →Baghdad supported the ISF, whereas in the surrounding Baghdad belt that had a Sunni majority the ISF could not function without the help of Shiite militiamen (Zucchino 2014). The ISF’s reliance on the Shiite militia groups increased communal disputes between Sunnis and Shiites instead of helping improve the security of the country. Sunnis viewed the activities of the Shiite-led ISF and its supplementary militia in their neighborhoods as a Shiite scheme for dominating their areas (Recknagel 2014).\n\nStories and observations from years after the invasion provide a clearer picture of the sectarian politics that led to a discriminatory environment throughout the country. The story of Ismail Muhammad Juwara, a former mid-level employee of Iraq’s intelligence service, the Mukhabarat, who was humiliated by his Shiite countrymen, is an example in this regard (Baram 2005). A clerk at one bank where Juwara held an account called him a dog when he went to withdraw funds. The clerk told him: “he should go to Saddam to ask for his money” (Baram 2005). In an interview with the Washington Post in January 2004, Juwara expressed his situation as follows: “We had dreams. . . . Now we are the losers. We lost our positions, our status, the [economic] security of our families, and stability. Curse on the Americans. Curse on them” (Baram 2005).\n\nOther observations indicate more frightening pictures of the country when sectarian attacks on Sunni communities increased in the coming years. For example, by 2005, the Mahdi Army of Moqtada al-Sadr, a major Shiite militia group, initiated a total cleansing of Baghdad’s Sunni and mixed neighborhoods (Hagan et al. 2015, 680). By the end of 2006, the Mahdi Army gained dominance over the traditionally advantageous Sunnis in multiple areas of the capital city. As a result, by 2006 and 2007, Sunnis living in Baghdad were driven out of much of the city by the Shiite security forces (Cockburn 2014, 70).\n\nAccording to a U.S. embassy cable in September 2007, Sunnis had largely fled to outlying areas of Baghdad or were “concentrated into small enclaves surrounded by Shia neighborhoods” (Cockburn 2014, 70). As a result, Baghdad’s neighborhoods that were mixed in 2003 became exclusively under the occupation of Shiite militia by 2008 (Hagan et al. 2015, 681). Reports by international organizations, including the UN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others, show that Sunni communities increasingly became a target of forced displacement, kidnapping, abduction, killing, and looting by Shiite militia groups during this period (Country Information 2016, 23–24; Higel 2016; Iraq 2016; Joint Page 136 →Written 2016; Security Situation 2015; The State of the World’s 2015). The increasing communal disputes were further intensified by the government’s sectarian policies during Maliki’s two terms in office.\n\nThe communal disputes and the government’s sectarian agenda together created an environment of fear in Sunni communities. In this environment, Sunnis found themselves without an effective voice in the government (Reid 2005). Under this condition, the Sunni insurgency emerged and expanded as an alternative force, claiming to represent the community and fight the occupation that had imposed the suppressive status quo. The rough environment made the Sunni population receptive to the insurgency as they increasingly supported and joined insurgent and jihadi groups (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 17–18; Stansfield 2007, 168).\n\nSome local elements of the insurgency, particularly the ex-Baathists and neo-Baathists that had initially created independent underground resistance groups, soon integrated into the jihadist camp to fight more effectively against a common enemy. For example, the Baathist insurgent groups like Kata’ib Salah al-Din, or the Saladin Phalanx; Kataib al-Mujahidin, or the Jihad Warriors Phalanx; Hizb al-Baaath al-Arabi al-Ishtiraki, or the Baath Arab Socialist Party; and the like soon became providers of training, weapons, and finances to jihadi elements and groups (Baram 2005, 6; Eisenstadt and White 2005, 3; Eisenstadt 2004, 101–6). Moreover, high-ranking Baathists such as Sib’awi Ibrahim Hasan (Saddam’s half-brother) and General Tahir Jalil Habush (ex-chief of the Mukhabarat) became important providers of financial and strategic support to jihadis while lower-ranking Baathists were actively joining jihadi operations in the early years after the American occupation (Baram 2005, 6).\n\nAs the insurgency expanded, the Baathists played a far more significant role in the evolution of the insurgency to IS. When IS was officially launched in 2014, its caliph’s two immediate deputies were former ranking officers in Iraq’s military (Abu Ali al-Anbari, IS’s chief of Syria operations, was a major general in the Iraqi Army, and Fadl Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, IS’s chief of Iraq operations, was a lieutenant colonel in Iraq’s Military Intelligence and a former officer in the Iraqi Special Forces) (Lister 2015, 76–77; Sherlock 2014). Furthermore, two of the four members of IS’s military council, Abu Aiman al-Iraqi and Abu Ahmad al-Alwani, were former officers in the Iraqi Army (Exclusive 2014). IS also maintained 1,000 “medium-and-top-level field commanders of the very Iraqi army which was disbanded by Americans” (Lister 2015, 35, 76–77; Sherlock 2014).\n\nPage 137 →Besides the ex-Baathists, there were thousands of so-called angry Iraqis, including citizens that had lost family members in the war or were humiliated, treated roughly, and wrongly detained at the hands of the Coalition and the Shiite-led forces, that were ready to join the resistance (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 10). While the ex-Baathists provided the insurgency with their expertise in such areas as strategic planning, military operations, and finance, the “angry Iraqis” provided effective manpower to the insurgent groups. The combination of jihadis and Baathists with ordinary Sunnis developed the insurgency into a multilayered and flexible force that was able to interact with multiple segments of the society and operate broadly.\n\nAnother sectarian factor that motivated Sunnis to join the insurgency was the formation of independent Shiite and Kurdish militia brigades that freely operated in Sunni neighborhoods. Some of those militia groups, particularly the larger and more established ones including the Shiite Badr Organization and the Kurdish Peshmerga units, were tied to Iraq’s leading political parties and supported by the government (Beehner 2005). These militia groups were initially created to fill in the security gap left by an ineffective ISF. They were mobilized to fight alongside the official troops of the ministries of Interior and Defense against the Sunni insurgency (Beehner 2005). However, some of these groups gradually set up their operations independently in Sunni areas, which resulted in violent reactions (Beehner 2005).\n\nThe Shiite militia groups’ sectarian affiliation, structure, and independent operations undermined the idea of a national security force and a unified government in Iraq. It also increased skepticism toward the government’s security policies in the Sunni communities (Beehner 2005). In general, the Shiite militia operations, whether independently or alongside the ISF, were highly unwelcomed and exacerbated the antigovernment sentiments in the Sunni Triangle. In this environment, the jihadis easily moved and maneuvered throughout the Sunni areas by self-advertising as a Sunni resistance army against the foreign occupation and the Shiite domination. The expansion of the anti-Shiite sentiments in Sunni communities, which was fueled by both the government’s sectarian policies and the insurgency’s propaganda, contributed to the insurgency’s recruitment and its evolution to a jihadi Salfi organization.\n\nInterviews with captured IS fighters show that the organization broadly used the anti-Shiite rhetoric and the Sunni grievances in its recruitment campaigns. For example, Walid Ismail, a 20-year-old IS fighter who was Page 138 →captured by the Kurdish forces in November 2016, joined IS because Sunni leaders told him he will be a member of freedom fighters to rescue Iraq from the Shiite domination. Walid, the former bakery worker, expressed his feelings as follows: “We loved [IS] because they relieved us from the oppression of the Shiites who branded all Sunnis as terrorists” (Barnes 2016). Other evidence shows that even the well-disciplined fighters of the Sahwa Movement, which emerged as a Sunni tribal force against the insurgency in 2007, switched sides because of Maliki’s Shiafication of ISF and his unwillingness to integrate the Sahwa members into the security force structure due to their sectarian differences. As a result, while hundreds of Sahwa fighters directly joined ISI, thousands of those fighters who were still on the government payroll covertly aided the insurgency (Williams and Adnan 2010). The sectarian politics also put the Sunni tribal sheikhs that initially resisted the insurgency in favor of IS. When these sheikhs’ requests to arm their tribes against the insurgency were refused by Baghdad for sectarian reasons, they pledged allegiance to IS (ISIL Wins Support 2015).\n\nTaken together, the legitimacy of the new Iraqi state and its armed forces dramatically dropped in Sunni areas because of the Shiite and Kurd militias’ intervention and operations in Sunni areas, the Shiafication of Iraq’s armed forces, and the government’s sectarian policies that increased group grievance in Sunni communities. The sectarian environment that remarkably intensified the divide between us and the other in Iraqi society made the Sunni communities receptive to the insurgency as part of the us. This environment not only eased the insurgency’s recruitment from Sunni communities but also provided the insurgency with a broad sanctuary and support basis in Sunni areas. The expansion of the insurgency and its evolution to IS benefited greatly from this condition.\n\nIn addition to the failed political participation and the government’s sectarian policies, regional politics also undermined the legitimacy of the Iraqi state, providing another state fragility condition for the rise of IS. In the absence of a legitimate and effective government in Baghdad, regional powers, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia, intervened in the country to support their proxies in the sectarian war. The defeat of Saddam, hostile to both the Iranian ayatollahs and the Saudi sheikhs, upended the regional balance of power, opening Iraq’s doors to regional rivals (Fisher 2016b). Following Saddam’s defeat, Iran increased its influence in Baghdad and also wielded Shiite militias to control Iraqi streets (Fisher 2016b). Saudi Page 139 →Arabia, by contrast, sought to match Iran’s reach by fostering sectarianism and allying itself with ex-Baathist and Sunni militants (Fisher 2016b).\n\nIran increased its influence in Iraq through the Shiite-led government, the major Shiite militia groups, and the pro-Iranian Shiite religious figures such as Moqtada al-Sadr (Fisher 2016b; Krohley 2014). The two leading Shiite parties including the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), which was renamed the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) in 2007, and the Islamic Da’wa Party were deeply influenced by the Iranian establishment. ISCI was founded in Iran and the Da’wa is headquartered in Tehran since 1979. Both parties received huge amounts of support from Iran during their campaign against Saddam in 1980 (Bakhash 1984, 233; Wright 2001, 124). Following the fall of Saddam’s regime, the two parties became Iran’s great source of influence in Iraq. In addition to its official influence through the two ruling parties, Iran also controlled the Shiite militia groups. The major Shiite rebellion groups including the Mahdi Army and the Badr Organization were pro-Iranian (Al-Marashi 2016; Profile 2012; Simon and Takeyh 2006; Stansfield 2007, 176–78). Iran also funded and mobilized many other Iraqi Shiite militia groups like the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which was created against ISIS in 2014.\n\nOverall, the regional intelligence agencies report that Iran trained and armed as many as 40,000 Iraqis to prevent a retreat of Shiite control in the early years after the U.S. invasion (Simon and Takeyh 2006). Moreover, Tehran deployed a large number of the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force besides officers from the Ministry of Intelligence, the National Security, and the Lebanese Hezbollah in the first three years following the U.S. invasion in Iraq (Simon and Takeyh 2006). The Iranian personnel in Iraq monitored the movement of the Coalition forces, looked after weapons caches, facilitated cross-border travel of Shiite clerics, smuggled munitions into Iraq, and recruited locals as intelligence sources (Simon and Takeyh 2006).\n\nBy having Iraq under its control, Iran followed a regional agenda to dominate a Shiite coalition in the region against Saudi Arabia and its allies. The agenda was perceived by King Abdullah of Jordan as Iran’s attempt to form a Shiite Crescent that expanded from Iran to Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon (Cordesman and Davies 2007, 131). Iran’s multilayered activities in Iraq not only led to the increasing influence of the Ayatollahs in Baghdad but also turned Iran into a key player in Iraqi politics, giving Tehran leverage Page 140 →at the international level. For example, Iran used its Iraqi card openly in its nuclear stalemate game with the United States (Simon and Takeyh 2006).\n\nWith the establishment of a Shiite-dominated government in Iraq that was profoundly influenced by Iran, Saudi Arabia found itself isolated in the country. Before the U.S. invasion, the Saudi government had invested in a regime change agenda in Baghdad, which was supposed to replace the anti-Saudi Baathist regime with a government led by pro-Saudi Iraqi generals (MacLeod 2003). The rise of the Shiite-led government in Baghdad caused a political shock in Riyadh. Therefore, from the beginning of the political development in post-Saddam Iraq, Saudi politicians designed both formal and informal approaches to balance Iran’s growing influence in Iraq.\n\nThe Saudis’ formal approach was based on diplomatic measures directed at pressuring the Americans to bring Sunnis together by giving them leadership roles in Baghdad (Cordesman and Davies 2007, 211). The kingdom’s purpose, in this context, was to keep the ex-Baathists involvement in a power-sharing arrangement (Keynoush 2016, 178). In contrast to its formal policy, the Saudi state’s informal approach to Iraq included the promotion of the jihadist ideology in Sunni communities as a response to the Iranian government’s efforts of projecting an ideological war in the region (Tisdall 2010). The U.S. officials’ communications suggest that the Saudi government provided financial and logistic support to ISIS and other extremist groups through its informal policy in Iraq. For example, an email by the United States secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, shows her deep concern with the Saudi support of Sunni jihadi groups including ISIS:\n\nWe need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isil and other radical Sunni groups in the region. (Samuel 2016)\n\nMoreover, the emergence of the Sunni jihadi movement in Iraq was completely in line with the Saudi Wahhabi agenda that sought to expand Wahhabi influence in the Islamic world by mobilizing and legitimizing jihadi organizations. For this reason, the Saudi powerful clergy provided religious justification in support of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq and beyond. The Iraq-based insurgency was publicly announced as jihad by several Saudi Page 141 →clerics in October 2004, and a month later 26 prominent Saudi clerics, including Sheikh Salman al-Audah and Sheikh Nasser al-Omar, signed a fatwa calling upon Iraqis to rise against the occupation (Bender 2005; Obaid and Cordesman 2005). Young Saudis perceived the fatwa as a religious call for jihad in Iraq. Therefore the fatwa motivated thousands of Saudi citizens to join the insurgency (Hegghammer 2008b, 11). Although the real figures of Saudi fighters in Iraq are somewhat disputed, official sources suggest that 2,000 to 3,000 Saudi citizens join the insurgency in the early years following the U.S. invasion (Hegghammer 2008b, 11).\n\nOverall, the intervention of Iran and Saudi Arabia in post-Saddam Iraq fueled the sectarian conflict, aiding the development of the Sunni insurgency as a response to the growing Shiite domination in the country. While Iran was attempting to form its Shiite Crescent by controlling Baghdad and Saudi Arabia was trying to counter Iran by expanding influence in the Sunni communities, the evolution of the Sunni insurgency remarkably benefited from the sectarian competition between the two regional powers. Although the Saudi government has constantly rejected any links to JSGs in Iraq, no informed observer can ignore the Saudi and the Iranian hand in a fueling sectarian competition between Shiites and Sunnis that facilitated the formation of the most aggressive JSG of the modern age, IS. In this hostile environment, IS climbed on the shoulders of the states that competed in the Sunni versus Shiite battle in Iraq and beyond (Gerges 2016, 4, 20).\n\nWeak Authority\n\nWeak authority, in terms of the lack of a legitimate and effective security and law enforcement apparatus, created a favorable condition for the emergence of IS. Before the U.S. invasion, the state authority was consolidated and performed in the country by Iraq’s 400,000 armed force, which was known as the most effective force in the Gulf region (Otterman 2003). The key components of the armed forces including its army, police, and intelligence were destroyed after the invasion, leading to a severe security vacuum that was not possible to fill immediately. Therefore the CPA designed a step-by-step plan to rebuild Iraq’s armed forces by fulfilling three major tasks: the neutralization of the insurgency through direct operations until an Iraqi force was able to assume responsibility, the rebuilding of ISF, and Page 142 →the reconstruction and reformation of defense and security institutions (Rathmell et al. 2005, 1).\n\nTo accomplish the first task, the Coalition forces launched a nationwide military operation to confront the situation directly. However, the operation was largely ineffective because when areas were cleaned by the Coalition force the newly built ISF failed to maintain them (Rubin 2004). As a result, disputed areas in the Sunni Triangle remained unstable and ungoverned, which provided safe havens to both the insurgency and the international jihadis. Security assessment reports show when the CPA handed authority over to the Iraqi Interim Government on June 28, 2004, it was clear that the Coalition forces had made little progress in its first task of restoring order and neutralizing the insurgency. By this time, the number of domestic members of the insurgency grew from 12,000 to 20,000 and its foreign members totaled 3,000 (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 7–8; Obaid and Cordesman 2005, 4–7). The ISF remained ineffective in restoring order for many years to come. Even by the time ISI grew stronger in 2012, the ISF was still a “brittle force which could neither control Iraq nor resist any major blow” (Knights 2016, 20–21).\n\nThe Coalition’s failure in fulfilling the first task of neutralization slowed down its ability to accomplish the second and third tasks, including rebuilding the ISF and the reconstruction of its defense and security institutions. The two tasks, in general, consisted of building four major security sectors including a national security committee to coordinate various security-related activities, the defense sector that included the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the armed forces, the security sector that included the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the police force, and the justice sector that included judicial and prison systems (Rathmell et al. 2005). The plan excluded the restoration of the intelligence system. The process and flaws of building these four security sectors are discussed next.\n\n(1) National Security Committee. In June 2004, CPA established Iraq’s national security committee, called the Ministerial Committee on National Security (MCNS). This committee was comprised of the Iraqi politicians and the military-security leaders and meant to engage in the policy development of the security sector and consult Iraq’s security with the IGC (Rathmell et al. 2005). However, because of the lack of a sufficient and effective domestic force when almost all military operations were planned and conducted directly by the Coalition, the MCNS remained a ceremonial body until it was entirely dissolved (Rathmell et al. 2005).\n\nPage 143 →(2) Defense Sector. The rebuilding of the defense sector, which included the MoD and the armed forces, suffered from three managerial, political, and contextual miscalculations. In terms of management, the CPA failed to balance the development of MoD institutions and the armed forces, with the latter being developed much faster than the former (Barton and Croker 2004, 27; Rathmell et al. 2005, 1). The unbalanced development made the civil management of the armed force extremely difficult, if not impossible.\n\nPolitically, a weak MoD paved the way for sectarian-based recruitment in the army’s separate divisions that were largely commanded by Shiite officers. This in turn challenged the creation of a national army that was expected to reflect the ethnic, religious, and sectarian mosaic of the country.\n\nContextually, the initial plan to rebuild Iraq’s armed forces did not take the real security problems in the country seriously. The Coalition force’s initial plan was to create a classical army for external defense, yet the main problem in the country was internal, including sectarian violence and insurgency (Rathmell et al. 2005, 36). Therefore, while the Iraqi armed force was trained to fight an external enemy, it failed to execute key military functions when called upon to fight the insurgency (Rathmell et al. 2005, 41). The Coalition revised the plan by adding counterinsurgency lessons in the training of the armed forces in spring 2004, but it was too late to respond to the insurgency that was already expanding in the security vacuum (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 7–8; Hoffman 2004).\n\nTo fill the security vacuum and face the insurgency more effectively, the Coalition force created an extra military force named the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) in early 2004. The ICDC operations created more security challenges than it helped resolve. The corps’ operations overlapped the police functions, even though its personnel were trained as soldiers instead of policemen (Rathmell et al. 2005, 41). As a result of the Coalition’s managerial, political, and contextual miscalculations and its failure to effectively respond to the security problem, the security vacuum in the country grew wider, which a JSG like IS was preparing to fill.\n\n(3) Security Sector. The reconstruction of the MoI and the police force had a mixed result. Unlike the defense sector, the MoI was not entirely dissolved through the CPA’s de-Baathification because the Coalition initially planned to hand over responsibility for policing to domestic institutions as soon as feasible (Rathmell et al. 2005, 42). Police recruitment, equipment, Page 144 →training, and infrastructure development programs had made significant progress by July 2004 with the actual number of serving police personnel reaching 120,000 (Rathmell et al. 2005, 46).\n\nNonetheless, the development of the police force suffered from the Coalition’s incoherent vision about Iraq’s security priorities and the lack of state capacity in providing a national security agenda. The main reason for these shortcomings was the Coalition’s interference in managing the day-to-day operations of the MoI and the police instead of developing a national agenda for institutional development and capacity-building in the security section (Rathmell et al. 2005, 53–54). The MoI’s failure in delivering urban and rural policing, controlling the borders, and managing the population and weapons were the outcome of both the poor support system and the underqualified police force (2005, 53–56).\n\nThe police force’s inability in conducting basic tasks allowed foreign jihadis to infiltrate Iraq and interact with domestic elements of the insurgency in ungoverned areas. The lack of an effective border control force was evident from the widespread smuggling, infiltration of transnational jihadis, and cross-border traffickings (Negus 2004; Rathmell et al. 2005, 55). To deter arms smugglers and foreign militants, the Coalition increased patrols along Iraq’s borders in 2004, which did not provide a permanent solution (Schmitt 2004). Iraq’s borders remained outside effective state control even after the formation of IS in 2014 (al-Mukhtar 2015).\n\nThe Coalition force and the MoI also failed to guard Iraq’s 2,700 identified munitions sites. Parts of those sites were initially looted by elements of the former regime that supported the insurgency. Reports show that most explosives and weapons used in attacks against the American force and the Iraqi troops were supplied by those elements (Schmitt and Bergman 2003). Regardless of their vulnerability to the insurgency, the munitions sites remained poorly secured for years. The MoI’s weapons control section that was assigned to manage the vast ammunition storage sites did not have the necessary force and resources to secure those sites (Rathmell et al. 2005, 56). In the absence of effective policing and the Coalition’s failure in developing the MoI properly, thousands of foreign fighters from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan, Chechnya, and elsewhere infiltrated Iraq unchecked, finding shelter and support in ungoverned areas of the Sunni Triangle, where all elements of the insurgency interacted and cooperated freely (Hawramany 2004; Schmitt 2004).\n\nPage 145 →(4) Intelligence Sector. The rebuilding of Iraq’s intelligence apparatus was initially excluded from the Coalition’s state-building agenda in Iraq. When coordinated intelligence was critical to the success of both the counterinsurgency and the fight against organized crime, the CPA assigned the establishment of domestic intelligence to future governments (Rathmell et al. 2005, 62). The CPA officials believed that the MoI and MoD intelligence had enough capability in collecting the needed information and the American 1st Armored Division in Baghdad’s intelligence cell was also capable of providing enough support for the Coalition’s intelligence efforts (Rathmell et al. 2005, 62). This means that the CPA did not see an immediate need to reconstruct Iraq’s intelligence sector. This assumption caused an intelligence gap that was easily and immediately filled with the intelligence networks and operational cells of the insurgency. A typical insurgent cell in Iraq consisted of 5 to 10 informants and fighters. However, the CIA used the term cell in Iraq interchangeably, with the unit consisting of 20 to 100 combatants (Nance 2015, 108).\n\nWhile the domestic insurgent cells were homogenous, the jihadi cells were multinational. The latter functioned as the nuclei of a transnational organization that brought all elements of the Iraq-based insurgency under a unifying and sense-making ideology and agenda (Partlow 2006). In the intelligence gap, the remnants of Saddam’s intelligence apparatus also expanded their underground networks and activities that further facilitated the jihadi operations. The ex-Baathist intelligence was far ahead of the Coalition in its ability in gathering information, networking, and mobilizing the population in favor of the insurgency and the jihadi groups (Rathmell et al. 2005, 62).\n\nContribution of Weak Authority to the Rise of IS\n\nIn the absence of an effective ISF in the early years after the invasion, the Coalition force policed Iraq in ways that were unpleasant to the public (Rathmell et al. 2005, 3). Lack of a sufficient domestic force and the Coalition’s direct operations created a condition of fear and chaos in which the seeds of the Iraq-based insurgency as forebears of IS were planted.\n\nThe emergence of IS’s predecessors and their long journey toward the formation of a transnational jihadi organization were done in three phases. Page 146 →First, the infiltration of foreign jihadi groups, particularly Zarqawi’s JTJ, into Iraq. Second, the emergence of an anti-occupation and anti-Shiite domestic insurgency and their interaction with trained ex-Baathists. Third, the interaction of the domestic and foreign elements of the insurgency and their integration in a uniform jihadi organization in security vacuums left by the weak state authority.\n\nAs early as May 2003, foreign jihadis and jihadi groups moved into the Sunni Triangle and quickly interacted and cooperated with domestic jihadis and ex-Baathists (Weaver 2006). The Sunni Triangle including parts of Baghdad very soon became a physical safe haven for the jihadi and the insurgent groups in 2003 and 2004. The physical safe haven refers to an ungoverned area “in which terrorist groups, because of inadequate governance capacity and security force, could freely organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both” (Terrorist Safe Havens 2015, chap. 5). All three elements of the Iraq-based insurgency including foreign and domestic jihadis and the ex-Baathists mostly grouped, regrouped, interacted, and cooperated freely in ungoverned spaces of Falluja, Ramadi, Samarra, Balad, Mosul, and Tal Afar, all located in the Sunni Triangle. These ungoverned areas were self-controlled by Sunni tribes that for sectarian reasons facilitated and supported the activities of the insurgency.\n\nIn addition to ISF’s inability to control the Sunni Triangle, the evolution of the insurgency also benefited from the support of discontent Sunni tribes that looked at the insurgency as a defensive and resistance force during Iraq’s sectarian war. According to some tribal leaders, the people who supported the insurgency included both ex-Baathists and ordinary people that were harmed [by Americans and Shiites]. Some tribal leaders that did not cooperate with the insurgency even received death threats from their tribesmen. Sheikh Gazi al-Essawi, the leader of the Bu-Essa tribe in Falluja, for example, stated in an interview in November 2003 that he and other tribal sheikhs that regularly met the Coalition commanders received death threats from their tribesmen:\n\nEvery week we meet with the [Coalition] commander, as sheiks and religious leaders, and I am one of them. Every week we meet with him. We are looked at as collaborators. Some say, “You go and meet with the Americans. What did you achieve?” We did get death threats. (Al-Essawi 2003)\n\nPage 147 →Therefore most tribal leaders preferred the insurgency to the Americans and the government. The alliance between tribes and the insurgency was broad and intense. The alliance between Ansar al-Sunnah Army and the Army of Muslims, two al-Qaeda affiliates, with Al-Janabi and al-Jbour, the two biggest and most loyal tribes to Saddam Hussein, in Latifiyah is an example (Abdullah 2008). The concentration and activities of the two jihadi organizations in Latifiyah were so intense that the locals assimilated the town to the famous tribal-insurgent alliance in Afghanistan, describing it as a Taliban republic (Abdullah 2008).\n\nAlthough the Coalition operations in this area pushed the insurgency center to the border between Iraq and Syria in 2004, the jihadi cells and networks were too complex and multilayered to be eradicated by ephemeral operations in the absence of effective domestic force to control the area permanently (Owens 2009, 151). Therefore jihadis easily returned to their strongholds after surviving the Coalition’s heavy military operations. For example, a joint Coalition and Iraqi operation in November-December 2004 removed jihadis from Fallujah, but due to the lack of sufficient and effective ISF to keep the city out of the jihadis’ reach, jihadi groups returned and continued their attacks on the city and towns around it until ISIS completely captured the city in early 2014 (Hashim 2006, 40–46).\n\nThere are numerous examples of the ISF’s quantitative and qualitative weakness in keeping the Tringle out of the jihadis’ reach. The growth of jihadi operations and attacks in al-Anbar, for instance, was the outcome of a low number of ISF in the province. Until July 2006, there were only 200 uniformed Iraqi police officers and provincial troops in Ramadi, the capital of the province, that were supposed to protect the city against thousands of insurgents and jihadi militants (Caul 2007). When the number increased to 6,700 in mid-2007, insurgent attacks dramatically dropped (Caul 2007).\n\nIn addition to the lack of a sufficient number of security forces in specific areas, the qualitative ineffectiveness of the ISF was another problem. A remarkable example, in this regard is the fall of Fallujah and Mosul to ISIS in 2014. In Mosul, an estimated 30,000 Iraqi soldiers could not defend the city and fled after a quick confrontation with as few as 800 jihadis under the command of Baghdadi (Islamic State 2015). Even in areas under governmental control, the ISF was not able to provide basic security to its citizens and governmental authorities. In a famous case, the governor of al-Anbar province, Abdul Karim Barjas, resigned on August 5, 2004, following the kidnapping of his three sons by jihadis. In return Page 148 →for the release of his sons, Barjas appeared on a videotape, announcing his resignation and apologizing for his cooperation with the Coalition force (Fierce Fighting 2004).\n\nIn the absence of an effective domestic force and despite numerous Coalition operations in the Sunni Triangle, the area remained out of effective government control for years. In this circumstance, Zarqawi and his lieutenants managed to absorb both the foreign fighters and the domestic elements of the insurgency into his organization, developing it to AQI in 2004 (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 15–16; Graham 2005; Miller and Marshall 2005). AQI was the outcome of Zarqawi’s interaction with al-Qaeda cells and safe houses located in tiny villages and towns around Baghdad and other parts of the Sunni Triangle where all other jihadi commanders and operatives were also sheltered (Filkins et al. 2006; Gordon and Cave 2007; Hawramany 2004). This area was key to the evolution of the insurgency to IS.\n\nThe Sunni Triangle was home to large numbers of the former regime military and security personnel that was motivated and prepared to support the insurgency against the Coalition and the Shiite-dominated government (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 11). This situation facilitated the gathering and interaction of the scattered jihadi and Baathist groups in the area (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 5). The AQI’s incorporation with five other groups in MSM in January 2006 and MSM’s transformation into ISI in October of the same year greatly benefited from this condition (Lister 2014, 8).\n\nBefore the establishment of ISI as a centralized and hierarchical organization, the Iraq-based insurgency was made up of a “web of networks” linked by personal, tribal, and group ties (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 15). Each group was involved in a range of activities, including recruitment, training, financing, developing propaganda, and conducting guerrilla and terrorist attacks. Most of these activities were supported by former elements of the regime who, in addition to providing other supports, supplied the insurgency with arms and ammunition (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 15). With the help of elements from the former regime, the insurgency obtained a very large supply of arms, explosives, and munitions (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 10; Schmitt and Bergman 2003; Graham and Ricks 2004). Moreover, former army officers and soldiers equipped the insurgent and jihadi groups with intelligence and trained them in military skills that demonstrably improved their operational effectiveness and Page 149 →organizational capacity (Eisenstadt and White 2005, 5). The insurgent and jihadi groups’ quick interaction and their incorporation with ex-Baathists facilitated their incorporation into ISI.\n\nThe formation of ISI marked a new phase in Iraq’s war. With the rise of ISI, all insurgent groups and jihadi organizations integrated into a hierarchical and centralized jihadi organization with a religious leader, a fully structured cabinet, a sense-making ideology, and a common goal (Lister 2014, 8). ISI combined all domestic and international elements of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq under a jihadi Salafi command that followed a caliphate-based objective (Lister 2014, 9).\n\nThe ISI evolved into ISIS by expanding its operational domain to Syria on April 9, 2013, and ultimately transformed into IS a year later when the caliph announced the establishment of a pan-Islamic state (Lister 2014, 13). As such, weak state authority, in terms of the lack of an effective and legitimate ISF, provided the condition necessary for the gradual evolution of the insurgency into a transnational jihadi organization that captured territory, operated beyond sovereign boundaries, created mini-states throughout the Muslim world, and expanded terrorist cells in Western countries.\n\nBeing aware of ISF’s ineffectiveness and relying on its organized and motivated militants, ISIS attacked and captured Mosul on June 10, 2014. This was a turning point in the evolution of the jihadi organization into a state-like structure that not only took control of a major political and economic center with a population of 1.8 million but also acquired huge amounts of U.S.-made weaponry that included armored vehicles (Islamic State 2015). Mosul was entirely out of state control when most domestic and international jihadis freely entered the city to pledge allegiance to the self-declared caliph.\n\nAs such, in the absence of an effective ISF, a huge ungoverned area as large as Mosul was created to accommodate the establishment of the caliphate. Following the emergence of IS, both American and Iraqi officials admitted that the favorable condition for the evolution of the insurgency to IS was provided by Iraq’s weak security apparatus, on the one hand, and the slow process of creating a professional ISF to fill the security gap, on the other. Some experts describe the slow process of creating an effective domestic force as “a huge strategic mistake” that greatly benefited the emergence of IS from the post-invasion chaotic situation (Thompson 2015)."
