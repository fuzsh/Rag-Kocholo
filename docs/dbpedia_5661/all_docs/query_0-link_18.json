        "text": "BAGHDAD/LONDON: With Iraq facing its latest security challenge amid growing protests over unemployment, Iraqis could be forgiven for harking back nostalgically to an era of rising prosperity when the country appeared to be on the cusp of a gilded age.\n\nSixty years ago, Iraq’s monarchy came to an end with a bloody coup that killed the young King Faisal II. Many Iraqis still believe it was the start of a catastrophic slide downhill.\n\nWhile it lasted less than four decades, the constitutional monarchy is viewed by many as a golden period in the country’s history. That the king’s execution gave way to a tumultuous republic and, ultimately, the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, only adds to the sense of nostalgia.\n\nOn the anniversary of the July 14 revolution, Iraqis on Saturday reflected on what might have been had the king managed to survive the swirling and explosive political forces tearing through the Middle East at the time.\n\nBut some also said the era of the monarchy is too often seen through rose-tinted spectacles, and that the reality was a deeply polarized country divided between the elites and the mostly rural poor.\n\nSadaih Khalid, 45, a Baghdad businessman, described Brig. Abdul Karim Qassim, the nationalist Iraqi army officer who led the coup, as a “crazy man” who killed the king and other royal family members in “cold blood.”\n\nQassim “opened the gates of blood and released the killing, torturing and looting, since the dawn of that black July 14 until now,” Khalid told Arab News.\n\n“We wouldn’t have passed through all these tragedies if the royal family was still here.”\n\nThis sentiment is common in Baghdad, even among those born decades after the dynasty ended. It is not only that the demise of the monarchy was the start of the country’s descent toward dictatorship and years of war, but also that the coup — with no mercy shown toward the royal family — set a precedent for how the country’s most powerful figures would come to deal with political opponents.\n\nThat precedent came back to haunt Qassim less than five years later when he, too, was killed during a 1963 coup by the Baath party during Ramadan.\n\nThe kingdom of Iraq was founded in 1932 under Faisal I after the fall of the Ottoman empire. Faisal, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was a member of the Hashemite dynasty and fought alongside T.E. Lawrence during World War I.\n\nFaisal ruled for 12 years under a constitutional monarchy imposed by the British until his death from a heart attack, aged 48.\n\nFaisal’s son, King Ghazi, took the throne, but died six years later in a car crash in Baghdad. The title of king fell to Faisal II, who was just 3 years old, and his reign began under the regency of his uncle Crown Prince Abdallah.\n\nFaisal II was educated in Britain at Harrow, along with his cousin, King Hussein of Jordan.\n\nHighly intelligent, and leading a country blessed with a wealth of natural resources, Faisal seemed destined to build on his father and grandfather’s foundations when he took the throne, aged 18, in 1953.\n\nIraq at the time was prospering. Oil revenues were flowing in and the country was undergoing rapid industrialization.\n\nThe kingdom was also gaining prominence on the world stage.\n\nIraq then was “more democratic and cleaner than today,” Saad Mohsen, a professor of modern history at the University of Baghdad, told AFP recently.\n\n“We were far from the blood and fighting that we have come to know,” he said.\n\nBut it was also a country of social polarization. While the wealthy and well-connected enjoyed the good life in a thriving capital, resentment was building among the country’s poor, who were more conservative and receptive to complaints that the monarchy was too compliant to the needs of the West.\n\n“The royal system was not as good as people think,” Abdallah Jawad, 53, told Arab News in Baghdad on Sunday. “People are just tired (of insecurity) and because of this they are willing to go back and live under the royal system.\n\n“They don’t know that most policies adopted by the royal family at that time were sectarian and discriminatory.”\n\nThe tide would soon start to turn against the kingdom. Iraq’s close relationship with Britain — a policy Faisal II continued from his grandfather — became the source of increasing hostility that was exacerbated by the Suez crisis in 1956.\n\nOn July 13, 1958, when two army brigades were ordered to go to Jordan to help quell a crisis in Lebanon, Qassim, a disaffected officer leading one of the units, saw his chance and sent troops to the Qasr Al Rihab palace. By early the following morning, they had surrounded the palace with tanks and opened fire.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., King Faisal II, his uncle the crown prince, and other members of the royal family and their staff were ordered from the rear entrance and killed.\n\nThe 23-year-old king was engaged to marry.\n\nSaddam Hussein, who became president in 1979, setting the country on its calamitous course of foreign wars and brutal dictatorship, was fascinated by the young king.\n\nHe even restored the royal mausoleum where Faisal II’s marble tomb is located next to his father’s.\n\nTheir resting place has survived some of the darkest episodes of the nation’s history. But as Iraq looks to recover from its latest calamity — Daesh’s occupation of large parts of the country — many Iraqis will quietly mourn the 60 years since the monarchy’s downfall.\n\n* * *\n\nBorn to rule against a backdrop of turmoil\n\nFaisal II was born as the world prepared for a devastating war, lived through an era of Middle East turmoil and growing pan-Arab nationalism, and died in a revolution that also ended Iraq’s monarchy.\n\nHe became king of Iraq when he was only 3 years old, in April 1939, after his father, King Ghazi, died in a car crash. Faisal’s lineage crossed borders — his mother, Queen Aliya, was the daughter of Ali bin Hussein, King of the Hijaz and Grand Sharif of Makkah, who had fled to Iraq when he was deposed by Ibn Saud in 1925.\n\nDuring World War II, when Iraq was allied with Britain and the US, the young Faisal lived with his mother in Berkshire. Later, as a teenager, he was educated at Harrow school, along with the future King Hussein of Jordan, his cousin. The two became close friends, and may have considered merging their kingdoms. Before he became king, Faisal also visited the US in 1952, and met President Harry Truman.\n\nUntil Faisal reached the age of 18 in 1953, Iraq was ruled by a regent — his uncle, Abd Al-Ilah. Faisal was an inexperienced boy, plagued by poor health — he suffered from asthma — and his uncle continued to advise him from the sidelines. His advice was that Iraq should continue to have a close relationship with the UK, which resulted in the Baghdad Pact of 1955 — an ill-fated military alliance of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and the UK, which the US joined in 1958.\n\nFaisal’s turbulent life came to an end on July 14, 1958, during the revolution that deposed the monarchy. He and other members of his family were rounded up in the palace courtyard in Baghdad, and ordered to face a wall as a machinegun opened fire. The king died on the way to hospital and his body was strung from a lamppost.\n\nAs if that were not undignified enough, Faisal attained an immortality of sorts; he was the model for Prince Abdullah of Khemed, a character in “The Adventures of Tintin” by the Belgian comic writer Herge.\n\nNEW YORK CITY: The UN’s high commissioner for human rights on Thursday lamented the loss of Palestinian lives in Gaza, after reports that the death toll in the conflict between Israel and Hamas has reached 40,000, most of them women and children.\n\nThis “unimaginable” toll, reported by the Gazan Health Ministry, is “overwhelmingly” the result of the failure of the Israeli Defense Forces to respect the rules of war, Volker Turk added.\n\n“Today marks a grim milestone for the world,” he said. “On average, about 130 people have been killed every day in Gaza over the past 10 months.\n\n“The scale of the Israeli military’s destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and places of worship is deeply shocking.”\n\nUN spokesperson Farhan Haq said UN officials are aware “this number is an approximation” and “given the large number, and disturbing number, of people who remain unaccounted for, who may be trapped or dead under the rubble, this number may if anything be an undercount.”\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Thursday that grieving Palestinian families have no time to mourn their dead, as survivors face “death, pain, hunger and thirst on a daily basis.”\n\nThe hostilities and recurrent Israeli evacuation orders are driving a “seemingly endless cycle of displacement” that is making it difficult for people in Gaza to access the humanitarian assistance they need to survive.\n\nA humanitarian team that was able to reach two sites in Khan Younis on Thursday and talk with displaced families found that in addition to shortages of food and high prices for what little is available, a lack of cleaning and hygiene products is causing cases of skin infections to spread, with children particularly badly affected.\n\nDisplaced families have to construct their own shelters “with whatever fabric, pieces of wood, cartons they find,” the team said. “Children are attacked by rodents and insects at night due to poor shelter conditions. And yet they might have to leave again and start it all over again.”\n\nTurk said: “International humanitarian law is very clear on the paramount importance of the protection of civilians, and civilian property and infrastructure.”\n\nHis office has documented serious violations of these laws by both the Israeli military and armed Palestinian groups, including Hamas, he added.\n\n“As the world reflects on and considers its inability to prevent this carnage, I urge all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire, lay down their arms and stop the killing once and for all,” Turk said.\n\n“The hostages must be released. Palestinians arbitrarily detained must be freed. Israel’s illegal occupation must end and the internationally agreed two-state solution must become a reality.”\n\nBEIRUT: France’s Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne on Thursday expressed appreciation for Lebanon’s “self-restraint in this difficult period” in the region.\n\nSejourne reiterated that France “supports Lebanon amid the concerning situation.”\n\nHe stressed that France was keen on extending UNIFIL’s mandate during the UN Security Council’s session at the end of this month for another 12 months.\n\nSejourne arrived in Beirut for a short visit to Lebanon that lasted several hours.\n\nHis trip to the region includes Egypt, Jordan, and Israel.\n\nIn his meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Sejourne also said he hopes for continued non-escalation from Lebanon.\n\n“We can only be silent, patient, and praying in this difficult period,” Mikati said following the meeting\n\nSejourne’s visit came a day after US mediator Amos Hochstein’s visit to Lebanon and a day before the expected visit of the Egyptian foreign minister to Beirut.\n\nThe visits are part of the intense efforts aiming to reach a diplomatic solution that would achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and de-escalate the situation on the southern front between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe French foreign minister also met with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.\n\nFollowing the meeting, he affirmed that his message “reiterates France’s support to Lebanon amid the concerning regional situation.”\n\nHe said: “What matters to us is working on de-escalating the situation. This message was addressed to Lebanese authorities and will also be addressed to other countries in the region, hoping things will calm down during these highly sensitive times.”\n\nHe added: “Our message is one of support, solidarity and responsibility. France will always support Lebanon in achieving peace in the region. Above all, a ceasefire in Gaza is an essential and indispensable element if we are to discuss peace in the region.”\n\nAccording to his media office, Berri affirmed “Lebanon’s commitment to the rules of engagement and its right to self-defense against the Israeli aggression.”\n\nIsrael “targets civilians, media personalities and paramedics, in addition to using internationally forbidden weapons, including phosphorus bombs, to target agricultural fields and forests,” Berri said.\n\nHe emphasized Lebanon’s dedication to “the necessity to extend UNIFIL’s mandate in southern Lebanon for a new term under the French proposal and UN Resolution 1701.”\n\nSejourne also met with Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib.\n\nAccording to statements by people he had met, US mediator Hochstein had warned the Lebanese officials during his visits on Wednesday against “the risks of a full-scale war.”\n\nHe added that “the current Doha negotiations are a final and precious opportunity that can be used to stop the war in southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.”\n\nThe region is still waiting for the Iranian response to Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month, in addition to Hezbollah’s response to the killing of its senior military commander Fouad Shukur, in Beirut’s southern suburbs hours before Haniyeh’s death.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement on Thursday that “it will unwaveringly continue to defend Lebanon and its people with courage and full strength, employing all its capabilities and surprises.”\n\nIn commemoration of what Hezbollah calls the “July 2006 War Victory,” the group reaffirmed “its commitment to resistance and its unwavering support for the Palestinian people.”\n\nHezbollah on Thursday targeted the Shamir settlement for the first time with Katyusha rockets.\n\nThe group said that the attack was in response to “the Israeli enemy’s hostilities against Jdeidet Marjayoun Wednesday night, which caused casualties.”\n\nAccording to the updated toll of the Health Ministry’s emergency operations center, the unprecedented Israeli attack on the Jdeidet Marjayoun village “killed one person and severely injured another, who suffered a cardiac arrest.”\n\nThe center added that “upon the patient’s arrival to the hospital, he underwent a very critical surgery following the CPR performed by the medical staff.”\n\nAround eight people — including a three-year-old boy — were also injured as a result of the attack.\n\nThe child underwent surgery in the Marjayoun Governmental Hospital.\n\nHe was subsequently transferred to the Saint George Hospital University Medical Center in Beirut due to his critical condition.\n\nHis father, whose condition was also critical, was transferred to the same hospital.\n\nThree other people were moderately injured, while two women and a Syrian national were treated in the hospital.\n\nIsraeli artillery on Thursday targeted the town of Khiam with internationally banned phosphorus bombs, as well as the town of Qabrikha, resulting in the injury of two members of the Islamic Risala Scout Association in Khiam, as well as injuring a 10-year-old child in Qabrikha.\n\nThe Israeli shelling also reached the outskirts of the towns of Naqoura and Deir Mimas, which were targeted with incendiary shells.\n\nHezbollah, according to its statements on Thursday, “targeted the Ma’ayan Baruch site with artillery shells” and “a positioning point for Israeli soldiers at the Al-Malikiyah site.”\n\nIt also launched “an air attack with a squadron of assault drones on the Khirbet Ma'ar site, targeting the positions of enemy officers and soldiers.”\n\nHezbollah mourned two of its members: Mohammed Ali Jihad Badr Al-Din, aged 30, from the town of Harouf in southern Lebanon, and Hussein Yassin Sheito, aged 29, from the town of At Tiri in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli military, in anticipation of the visit of the US envoy Hochstein to Lebanon, used bunker-busting bombs for the first time in Kfarkela.\n\nIt also announced the crashing of an assault drone in an open area near Arab Al-Aramshe on the border with Lebanon without causing any injuries.\n\nIsraeli media reported that a settler was injured in Kiryat Shmona.\n\nAL-MUKALLA: The UN’s special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, on Thursday criticized the Houthis for their assaults on human rights organizations and their treatment of aid workers in Yemen, and condemned the continuing assaults by the militia on international shipping in the Red Sea and other waters off the country’s coasts.\n\nHe told the UN Security Council that the Houthis have been cracking down on humanitarian workers and civil society groups in Yemen. He urged the militia to halt its raids on the offices of UN agencies and other foreign organizations, and to free workers and other individuals that have been imprisoned.\n\nGrundberg called on the Houthis “to act responsibly and compassionately toward its fellow countrymen and women, and immediately and unconditionally release all UN, NGO (nongovernmental organization), civil society, diplomatic mission and private-sector employees, as well as members of religious minorities.”\n\nHe said that a Saudi-brokered deal between the Yemeni government and the Houthis had resulted in a significant deescalation of an economic battle between the warring sides that had threatened to plunge the country into renewed violence.\n\n“Last month, with the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the parties were able to halt a dangerous cycle of escalation that was negatively impacting Yemen’s banking and transport sectors and threatened to ignite renewed military conflict,” Grundberg said.\n\nUK, US and EU authorities have similarly denounced the Houthis for assaults on humanitarian efforts and civil society in the parts of Yemen the militia controls. They also denounced the group for seizing the offices of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sanaa this week, and demanded the release of all abducted Yemenis who work for foreign organizations, including UN agencies.\n\nThe UN said on Tuesday that the Houthis stormed its office in Sanaa and seized papers, vehicles and furniture as the militia intensified its crackdown on UN agencies, diplomatic missions and other international organizations.\n\nIn a message posted on social media platform X on Thursday, Hamish Falconer, the UK minister for the Middle East and North Africa, called on the Houthis to halt the harassment of workers from the UN and other organizations, and for the release of all abducted employees.\n\n“We call on the Houthis to allow the UN and all NGOs to continue their critical work for the Yemeni people and to release all detained staff immediately,” Falconer said.\n\nUS State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel on Wednesday condemned the Houthis for the takeover of the UN office, accusing the militia of breaching international norms and derailing humanitarian efforts in the war-torn country.\n\nHe said the assaults on rights groups and aid organizations in Yemen, as well as attacks on shipping and threats to the Yemeni people and neighboring countries, obstruct peace efforts to end the war in the country.\n\n“This is just one more step in an aggressive series of Houthi actions, including detentions of the UN, international organizations’ and diplomatic personnel working to help the Yemeni people,” Patel said.\n\n“These actions will further obstruct the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Yemenis who have endured crisis conditions for far too long.”\n\nThe EU diplomatic mission in Yemen on Wednesday reiterated a plea from UN human rights chief Volker Turk for the Houthis to respect the status granted to the UN and its workers, leave the occupied office, and return seized documents and equipment.\n\n“It is of fundamental importance to maintain the human rights monitoring and reporting capacity of the (office’s) field presence in Yemen,” the EU mission said."
